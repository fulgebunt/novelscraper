This is a novel by the same author as Keyboard Immortal and it\u2019s also the first novel written by him. This is a very good novel and will be a satisfying read especially for those who like Harem, Intelligent Protagonists, Kingdom Building, and all the Ecchi stuff that comes along with it.This is my first time translating a web novel. So please feel free to point out any mistakes. For now I will be translating in my own pace, but it may change depending on the situation.That\u2019s all from me! Enjoy~\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Song Qing was full of hatred. He was an orphan since he was a child. He worked very hard to survive in the society, and built a big family business at a young age. He entered the upper-class society and there he met that woman.She was beautiful and elegant, and there were many excellent young suitors around her. But Song Qingshu never regarded them as his opponents, until that man appeared.His family has a huge background, and he is also handsome and extraordinary. What\u2019s more important is that the two of them grew up together. They got together more than ten years later, and they were pleasantly surprised to find that the other had grown into such an outstanding character.The goddess hesitated between the two. In order to bring the beauty back, Song Qingshu meticulously designed a lot of small tricks and coincidences. He constantly won the goddess\u2019s favour, and the balance of victory gradually tilted towards Song Qingshu.During the whole process, the man just looked at everything indifferently, until finally at a suitable time, he pretended to accidentally reveal everything Song Qingshu had done before.When the goddess realized that the previous meetings were all scams, and she turned away without hesitation. Song Qingshu would never forget the disgusted look in her eyes when she left, and her word before leaving, \u201cNo matter how much you do, compared to him you are nothing. \u201cCompared to him you are nothing\u201d These words echoed in his ears for a long time.The man maintained his gentlemanly demeanor and treated Song Qingshu with courtesy until after he married the goddess.On the second day of marriage, Song Qingshu\u2019s company ushered in tragic revenge. At that moment, Song Qingshu learned about the power of a really big family, how terrifying a monster was hidden under the water.Looking up, he thought of the words the goddess spoke at the beginning, and he felt pain again, \u201cYou are all born nobles, of course, you don\u2019t need to do anything. If I am not a successful person, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have the qualifications to even talk to you. Haha\u2026 I have grown from a small person at the bottom of the society to a man with a net worth of billions. Can I get the things I want without the means of blood and tears? I am used to calculations and methods, but in the end, you think that there is a problem with my character.\u201dAt that moment, Song Qingshu didn\u2019t know why he thought of Duan Yu and Murong Fu. Song Qingshu has always disliked Duan Yu. He doesn\u2019t have to do anything all day. He only needs to travel around the mountains to play with his sister. He didn\u2019t need to practice internal skills, but just suck in others\u2019 hard work for a lifetime. Internal force; he doesn\u2019t want to learn martial arts, but all kinds of peerless cheats are automatically delivered to his front door; It\u2019s like everything was destined to be his!On the other hand, Murong Fu was forced to work hard, bearing the hatred of the country and the family. He practiced martial arts diligently since he was a child. He lived for the great cause of restoring the country. He didn\u2019t have the time to take care of his own personal affairs. In the end, his end was so miserable.Song Qingshu felt that he was very much like that Murong Fu, and that man was like Duan Yu. They could do nothing but wait for their opponent to make a mistake, because they were born with everything. But similar to Murong Fu, he couldn\u2019t do anything, because everything needed to be won by himself\u2026Suddenly feeling something was wrong, Song Qingshu turned his head and collided head-on with a large truck, and he was directly sent flying. He felt his bones cracking and breaking under the impact. Before he landed, he seemed to hear the driver say \u201cEnd him!\u201dThen Song Qingshu\u2019s consciousness plunged into endless darkness.Afterward, the traffic police identified the incident as an accident. Song Qingshu was under heavy debt and couldn\u2019t think clearly for a while. He was drunk and ran into the big truck. The driver\u2019s only fault was driving too fast. He was released, after 15 days of detention. Of course, it was impossible for Song Qingshu to know all this.Pain! Unbearable pain!Song Qingshu gradually regained consciousness, he felt as if all the bones in his body seemed to be broken, and he couldn\u2019t even lift a finger. As he thought about the oncoming truck just before losing consciousness, Song Qingshu felt a bone-chilling cold, \u2018Could it be that I lived, but now I can only live as paralyzed for the rest of my life?\u2019However, he quickly calmed down his feelings of agitation and fear. One must know that this billion dollar debt was nothing foreign to him. He was able to make billions in the past, and he will still be able to make money back in the future. The biggest difference between humans and animals is that they can decide for themselves whether they have been defeated or not.\u2018Is this in the hospital?\u2019 Song Qing opened his eyes and began to slowly look at the surrounding environment. There was no wind around the green yarn, a white candle was flickering on the table in the middle of the room, a graceful woman was sitting there with her back facing him, staring at the darkness in a daze.The woman\u2019s face couldn\u2019t be seen clearly, but the dim candlelight on her plain black dress was a little scary. Song Qing wondered what the hell was going on in this hospital, no one was speaking to him, and they even arranged the ward like a mourning hall. The nurse was sitting there like a ghost. Any timid person would have been scared shitless!The woman in the black dress seemed to be thinking about something in her heart and did not notice that the man on the bed had woken up. At this time, a nun knocked on the door and walked in to report: \u201cMaster, the Ming Cult representative is seeking an audience.\u201dThe woman in black clothes trembled visibly, but she quickly calmed down: \u201cThere is a decorum between men and women. It is inconvenient to see each other at night, let him go back.\u201d The indifference of her tone can hardly conceal the elegance of the woman in black dress\u2019s rigid voice. It\u2019s really pleasant to hear.At this time, a calm and clear male voice was heard: \u201cI am quite familiar with medical skills, and I am willing to heal young hero Song Qingshu. I have no other intentions.\u201d\u2026Song Qingshu, who has always been very familiar with the plots of Jin Yong\u2019s novels, only felt a chill running down from head to toe. He almost thought that this was the set of a film, then this Ming Cult\u2019s representative appeared. If you connect that with this situation, could it be that he is that person from \u201cThe Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber\u201d?That idiotic Song Qingshu?How scary was this!His chaotic mind finally cleared after waking up from the previous comatose state. Song Qingshu slowly recalled the details of the car accident, his expression turned ugly realizing that he was dead. but he didn\u2019t know why he was lying here, listening to this bullshit. From their conversation, it really seems that this is the world of \u201cThe Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber\u201d.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At that time, he was proud and confident. He just laughed at it. He didn\u2019t expect that it might become a reality like this. Song Qingshu, the spare tire of that tragedy.\u201cCome in.\u201d The woman in black dress at the table was silent for a while and said lightly.Song Qingshu has already pretty much confirmed that this was the world of The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber. No one would be so bored to deliberately set up these scenes to deceive him, the key point is that he clearly remembered that he was dead at that time.According to their conversation, it was supposed to be the Shaolin Lion Slaughter Assembly at this time. Song Qingshu was seriously injured. Naturally, the woman in the black dress was his nominal wife Zhou Zhiruo.Song Qingshu subconsciously pretended to remain unconscious. In the original work, the marriage of Song Qingshu and Zhou Zhiruo was in name only and fake. Zhou Zhiruo did not have much affection for Song Qingshu, and after various versions of TV dramas, Song Qingshu was deeply impressed by Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s black belly. If she found out that the real Song Qingshu had been replaced by him, she would definitely not hesitate to send him to the underworld with a \u2018Nine Yin White Bone Claw\u2019.Song Qingshu has already died once, and he didn\u2019t want to taste that feeling again. Zhang Wuji also walked in at this time, \u201cSong, how is Brother Song\u2019s injury, take me to see him.\u201dZhou Zhiruo didn\u2019t look back when she saw him coming in. She just said coldly: \u201cThe bones all over his body were shattered, and his injuries were extremely serious. Most people wouldn\u2019t survive. I don\u2019t know if he can survive tonight.\u201dSong Qingshu listened to her with a bitter smile: \u201cThis little girl has no conscience. The original owner of this body is also her nominal husband. Now that he is dying. She actually doesn\u2019t care. Does she want to become a pretty widow after his death? Throw herself into Zhang Wuji\u2019s arms again?\u201dZhang Wuji said, \u201cYou know that my medical skills are not bad, and I am willing to try my best to treat him.\u201dHis words ignited some hope in Song Qingshu\u2019s heart. Zhang Wuji received the true method of the Butterfly Valley Medical Immortal, and with his treatment, Song Qingshu could be saved.Zhou Zhiruo asked: \u201cWhy do you want to save him?\u201dSong Qingshu was stunned while listening to her in his bed, and he secretly pitied the original owner of this body: \u2018It seems that you are not that close my friend, and your wife is wishing you to die sooner.\u2019Zhang Wuji was stunned and said, \u201cI feel sorry for you, and I am extremely ashamed. What\u2019s more, today you were merciful and spared my life. Brother Song was injured, and I will do my best to cure him.\u201dZhou Zhiruo faintly said: \u201cYou showed mercy first, you think I don\u2019t know that? If you can save Brother Song, how can I repay you?\u201dThis situation is not right, why are you talking to each other like a couple? How can you ask a man about repayment in such a bitter way, what if the other party wants you to do this and that?Song Qingshu seemed to see a green light flashing on the forehead of the original owner of this body. Although Zhou Zhirou was not his wife, he was still worried.Zhang Wuji said: \u201cOne life for another, please be merciful to my foster father.\u201dZhang Wuji\u2019s words made Song Qingshu relieved. Fortunately, this guy is emotionally indecisive. If he has a personality like Wei Xiaobao, he just needs to be shameless at this time. Just a little push, Zhou Zhiruo is sure to give in to him.Zhou Zhiruo pointed to the inner hall and faintly said, \u201cHe is inside.\u201dZhang Wuji came to the bed, observed Song Qingshu\u2019s injuries, and said, \u201cMrs. Song, can I save Brother Song\u2019s life? I can hardly say whether I can give it a try?\u201dAs soon as the word \u201cMrs. Song\u201d came out, the more Song Qing looked at Zhang Wuji, the more pleasing to the eye he became, \u201cIf I am cured, I won\u2019t care about the eyebrows between you and Zhou Zhiruo.\u201d Song Qingshu secretly thought in his heart.Indeed, the original Song Qingshu had a reason to hate Zhang Wuji, but he only inherited Song Qingshu\u2019s body, there is no need to inherit the hatred in his heart at the same time. As for the unhappiness in his heart before, it was entirely because Zhou Zhiruo was a recognized beauty in the martial arts world, and Song Qingshu wasn\u2019t immune to man\u2019s possessive psychology.Now that Song Qingshu knew that the woman had a problem with her character, and it wasn\u2019t as if she was completely wrong. This is the case in this society. Unless you are a second-generation who just wants to eat and waits to die or a mediocre person, otherwise, as long as you fight, you will always be tainted by the big dye tank of society.There is no difference between good people and bad people in the world. The unfortunate thing for bad people is that they let most people see their bad side. Good people, perhaps intentionally or unintentionally, let everyone see only the good side.Song Qingshu is the former of the tragedy. His dark side was shown to the woman by the rival, so he became a bad person; the dark side of the rival, the woman did not see at all. So even if he was killed by the rival the woman felt that the rival was a gentleman.While Song Qingshu was in deep contemplation, Zhang Wuji had already begun to help him connect his bones. It was so painful that he thought he would die, but now that he still couldn\u2019t be sure about his safety, he only dared to pretend to be unconscious instead of crying out of pain.Zhang Wuji straightened his broken bones, picked out the Black Jade Intermittent Ointment, and used Nine Sun energy to put the power of the medicine into the broken bones in Song Qingshu\u2019s body. After a stick of incense time, he took a long breath and said to Zhou Zhiruo: \u201cSong Brother\u2019s life is no longer in serious danger, it\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026\u201dZhou Zhiruo didn\u2019t show a hint of joy on her face, and asked faintly: \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that Brother Song\u2019s meridians are completely broken, and I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t be able to practice martial arts again in the future.\u201d Zhang Wuji\u2019s words were like five thunderbolts, and Song Qingshu was dumbfounded. In the world of martial arts, the meaning of becoming a useless person is self-explanatory.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to blame yourself, it\u2019s not easy to save him.\u201d Zhou Zhiruo was still indifferent. To Song Qingshu\u2019s ear, it sounded very strange. As if they were husband and wife, and he was just an outsider\u2026uh, he was indeed an outsider.Then Zhang Wuji was worried that Zhou Zhiruo would not be able to beat Shaolin\u2019s Sandu, and spoke very tactfully about the power of King Kong\u2019s magic circle, hoping to work with her to break the truth.Zhou Zhiruo categorically refused: \u201cWe used to have a marriage agreement, but my husband is dying at the moment, and I don\u2019t hurt your reputation today. Others might say that I still have my old love for you. If I invite you to help, everyone in the world will talk. I don\u2019t want the reputation of being a shameless and profane woman.\u201dZhang Wuji said anxiously: \u201cWe only need to have a clear conscience and just ignore whatever people say, why should we care about them?\u201d\u201cWhat if I have a guilty conscience?\u201d Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s rhetorical question filled the room with an ambiguous atmosphere.Song Qing smiled bitterly and expressed deep condolences to the original owner of this body, \u2018This naked seduction is simply the rebirth of Pan Jinlian and the rebirth of Yan Poxi. Oh, poor brother Qingshu, what kind of sin did your ancestors commit? Don\u2019t tell me that I was reborn after taking this body, now I will have to lose my \u201cwife\u201d in this way.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even the original Song Qingshu had to admit that Zhang Wuji was indeed a gentleman. According to the plot of the original story, the two quickly regain their senses here, and Zhang Wuji will leave soon.But what surprised Song Qingshu was that Zhang Wuji sighed and affectionately said, \u201cZhi Ruo!\u201d Taking advantage of Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s shock, he stepped forward and grabbed her waist, bowed his head, and wanted to kiss her small cherry lips.Not to mention the still pretending Song Qingshu, even Zhou Zhiruo was shocked, but she quickly reacted, and she broke away from Zhang Wuji\u2019s embrace and hid away.Fu*k, this script is wrong!On the bed, Song Qingshu stared at Zhang Wuji with wide eyes. Did he get drunk and came here to seduce a married woman in the middle of the night? Is this Zhang Wuji still the kind-hearted gentleman in the original book? If I remember correctly, there is still Princess Shaomin at home waiting for him to go back, but ultimately it depends on Zhang Wuji who he ends up with.The footsteps of the patrolling disciples came from outside the house, and Zhou Zhiruo was ashamed and angry, \u201cZhang Wuji! You\u2026you\u2026\u201d She stuttered for a while, not knowing what to say.\u201cZhiruo, you have treated me very well since childhood. How dare I forget your affection for me? If it wasn\u2019t for saving my foster father last time in Haozhou City, you would already be my wife at this moment.\u201d Zhang Wuji sighed. He looked at Zhou Zhiruo affectionately.Zhou Zhiruo was upset for a while, and when she saw him mention the incident at the Haozhou wedding, her heart was full of hatred: \u201cYou followed Zhao Min in the presence of heroes in the world, and when did you care about my affection? Now you and Zhao Min live together, and I have become Mrs. Song, but you have come to talk about your old love!\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Zhang Wuji was shocked all of a sudden, he froze there, lost for words.Seeing his appearance, Zhou Zhiruo became angry for no reason and raised her voice: \u201cMaster Zhang, the two of us are a lone man and married woman. We are here together late at night. It is inevitable that this will provoke discussions. Please stop!Zhang Wuji was stunned on the spot and whispered: \u201cAfter that, I avoided your doorman when I came here. Let\u2019s talk slowly. I have a lot to say to you.\u201dSeeing Zhang Wuji\u2019s figure disappearing into the dark night, Zhou Zhiruo looked a little confused. She sat on the chair with her mind in a daze, an unknown shyness appeared on her face for a moment, and then a hint of anger rose up again.Song Qingshu had the opportunity to look at this cheap and sweet wife. She was as beautiful as Zhilan, elegant and refined. It really condensed the spirit of the Han River and the beauty of Emei, which can be worthy of the evaluation of \u201cclean and elegant, beautiful in appearance\u201d in the original book.In the previous versions of the TV series \u201cThe Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber\u201d, the actress who played Zhou Zhiruo were all rare beauties, but the woman in front of him seems to be a little bit more brilliant, a little more feminine than Gao Yuanyuan, and a little colder than Zhou Haimei. It is no wonder that Song Qingshu in the original book fancied her. But thinking about it, Zhang Wuji here is still reluctant to give up on Zhao Min, the first beauty of Mongolia.Thinking of the wedding night of the two, Zhou Zhiruo saw that Zhang Wuji had not come to attend the marriage. In a heartbroken situation, she decided to choose Song Qingshu. The owner of this body had the opportunity to pick Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s red flower. The current Song Qingshu was unwilling to take advantage of this out of jealousy and the self-esteem of a man.\u201cIt\u2019s really second-hand stuff!\u201d Song Qing admired her but also gave her his own evaluation with a bit of justified hatred. You must know that when a woman has another man in her heart, and you want to start from feelings again. It\u2019s almost impossible, to begin with. If you want to dispel the shadow of that man, the best way is to first get her body, then the heart. Only by becoming her first man will you be able to dilute that feeling of nostalgia for the first love in the her heart.\u201cOnly being able to watch and not eat, now the benefit goes to other men, and it makes me feel uncomfortable.\u201d Song Qingshu complained to the extreme and secretly said, \u201cI took your body, I\u2019m extremely sorry, but according to the plot, you would have died. The only compensation I can make is to try my best to protect your sweet wife from being abused by other men and use your name to make you world-renowned\u2026\u201dIn the next few days, the normal plot development of the original work started. Zhou Zhiruo joined hands with Zhang Wuji to break through the magic circle of Shaolin Sandu. Zhang Wuji went into trouble in the middle, and the madness was still spreading.Zhou Zhiruo originally planned to kill Xie Xun before returning to Emei, but Zhang Wuji confided in her affection that night, which made her temporarily give up on the idea.After the Lion Slaughter Meeting, Zhou Zhiruo was seriously injured and it inconvenient to go on the road with Song Qingshu. She stayed at Shaolin Temple and sent most of the disciples back to Emei, leaving only one or two to serve.Song Qingshu watched coldly, he could roughly guess Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s subconscious intention. However, after that night, Zhang Wuji never came here again. Watching Song Qingshu getting better day by day, Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s expression became a little anxious.Black Jade Intermittent Ointmentis the holy product for bones. In addition, Zhang Wuji used Jiuyang Divine Art to force the medicinal power directly to the bone marrow. Therefore, Song Qingshu could get out of bed and walk in a few days. Except for some weakness, he was no different from ordinary people.\u201cZhiruo, why don\u2019t we return to Emei?\u201d Song Qingshu hesitantly asked Zhou Zhiruo.\u201cThe soldiers are in chaos along the way, we will be on the road when you are completely healed.\u201d Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s voice was unfamiliar and cold.Song Qingshu has been an old player in modern high society and has long learned to judge the situation and be cheeky. Now he is a useless person, and the vicious image of Zhou Zhiruo in the previous TV series is too deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.Considering that Zhou Zhiruo can send him to see the King of Hades with just her fingers, all the initiative here lies in her hands.\u2018I\u2019m not so stupid to showdown with her. In case I annoy her, she will heartlessly kill me. Then she can live with Zhang Wuji in private and then declare that he was seriously injured and died. Because of Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s appearance as a virtuous wife during this period, no one will doubt it then.Thinking of the previous promise to the original owner of this body, Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but smile. He has to guard against a thief for a thousand days. How can it be easy to guard against thieves for a thousand days?If I want to keep Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s purity, I have to take her virginity first, but\u2026 Seeing that he doesn\u2019t even have the power to toss up a chicken now, Song Qingshu let out a bitter smile. He can now be regarded as an earthling with a fighting strength of five. Zhou Zhiruo is simply a super Saiyan in front of him, and pushing her down is definitely impossible.In the past few days, Song Qingshu has been looking for a topic to chat with Zhou Zhiruo, and the other party\u2019s reaction was extremely cold. Only when it comes to matters in the martial arts, her reaction is slightly better.Originally, Song Qingshu was only planning to get acquainted with her, but the two of them hadn\u2019t made any progress in their relationship, but this chat let him unintentionally re-recognize the world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This chapter was not easy to translate. It contained a ton of historical information, names and terms. I think I may have become an expert at Mongolian history. Yah~ This was a good old info dump chapter, but trust me this chapter is important. This chapter is important for world building.Now\u2026enjoy!It turned out that this was not the world of \u2018The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber\u2019 that Song Qingshu originally thought, but a strange world.Hearing Zhou Zhiruo mention Guo Jing and his wife Huang Rong who guarded Xiangyang, as well as the Undefeated East Dongfang Bubai, and the great king of Khitan Nanyuan who once set off a bloody storm in the Central Plains martial arts\u2026Song Qingshu\u2019s face showed clear bewilderment.After a number of beating around the bush, Song Qingshu finally confirmed with a strange expression that this is a world jointly framed by Jin Yong\u2019s 14 novels.In this world, Song and Liao competed for more than a hundred years, at war with each other. As a result, two Jurchen tribes emerged in the rear of the Liao Kingdom, one Heishui Jurchen tribe, and the Jianzhou Jurchen tribe. Heishui Jurchen established the Jin State. After the battle, it directly invaded the hinterland of the Liao State, and the Liao State was almost destroyed. Fortunately, another nomadic Mongolian race on the grassland rose up and began to attack the rear of the Jin State. Only then did the Jin State stop its attack on the Liao and turn its main force against Mongolia.Now that the two countries are in the Yellow River Basin and Chang\u2019an Tongguan is on the front line, the Liao Kingdom has the opportunity to take a breather and be trapped between Shanxi and Inner Mongolia. The Mongolian alliance gradually showed signs of revival.Jianzhou Jurchen established the Manchu Kingdom, defeated the Great Ming Kingdom, which had internal and external troubles, and occupied the vast land of Liaodong, Hebei, Shandong, and Yangzhou.Currently, the only country established by the Han people is the Song Kingdom south of the Yangtze River, which relies on natural obstacles to resist the nomadic cavalry from going south.At present, Mongolia is the strongest, but the battle to unify the various divisions of Mongolia is extremely fierce. All of the great Khan Temujin died in battle, and all there\u2019s left are a few generals of the same generation and nephews.Fortunately, the third generation of grandchildren are extremely competent. One of the Six Emperors, Xuliewu followed the great Khan Temujin, and led the main force of Mongolia to march west. They divided into two troops, one attacking Khwarazmo and the Eastern European Federation, and the other attacking the powerful Persia and Arab countries.Before Temuzhen\u2019s Western Expedition, he left behind the Prince of Ruyang, Chaghan Tem\u00fcr; the son of his late brother Muhuali. Prince of Ruyang was Zhao Min\u2019s father who led an army through the Western Regions, suppressed Ming Cult and Hui tribes, and appropriately contained Xixia so that Xixia had no time to expand.Another one of the four Emperors, Kublai, led an army to attack the Kingdom of Jin on the front line of Tongguan, Chang\u2019an. The emperor Sun Meng Ge led an army to attack the southern Song Kingdom from Sichuan. After the death of Meng Ge, Kublai took his troops.Now Nanyang Wancheng first attacked the Jin State of Chang\u2019an Luoyang in the north and Xiangyang in the Song Dynasty in the south. It was similar to the Mongolian kings.The Seventh Emperor\u2019s grandson Ariq B\u00f6ke left his army to stay on the Mongolian prairie and put his eyes towards the Manchus. However, Kangxi, the young Emperor of the Manchus, was also a talented strategist. He guarded Yanjing himself.His subordinate Prince of Pingxi, Wu Sangui guarded Shanhai Pass and Prince of Bao Hongli guarded Shanhaiguan. Shengjing formed an alliance with Heishui Jurchen of Jin Country, forming a horn-cutting trend, and that momentum even faintly overwhelmed the coalition forces of Ariq B\u00f6ke and Liao.Of course, Tubo and the small frontier countries of the Duan clan in Dali are just grasping for breath in Go\u2019an, so there\u2019s no need to make a detailed list.After digesting all this in shock, Song Qingshu wondered whether this was still a fusion of the world of Jin Yong\u2019s 14 novels. He suddenly remembered that there was a person in the Shaolin Temple who would definitely be able to help him.Song Qingshu said that he would go for a walk, Zhou Zhiruo nodded indifferently. Song Qingshu smiled at the fact and spoke to himself while on the road: \u201cThis woman\u2019s feelings for her husband are really weak. It seems that only Zhang Wuji can cause her emotions to fluctuate\u2026\u201dAfter a long time, he remembered that now his first priority was to heal his meridians, and then to survive in this chaotic world instead of feeling unfounded jealousy towards Zhang Wuji.After reaching the Buddhist Scriptures Pavilion of Shaolin Temple, he expressed his intention to the scholarly monk. The other party knew that Song Qingshu was the husband of Emei\u2019s head, so he didn\u2019t dare to neglect. Seeing that he just wanted to read the Buddhist scriptures, Song Qingshu was led in after registration: \u201cYoung Hero Song, this temple always welcomes people with predestined to read Buddhist scriptures. The first floor contains various versions of the scriptures, and Young Hero Song can read them at will. However, the second floor of the Buddhist Scripture Pavilion is where the martial arts classics of this temple are located. Please, don\u2019t make the little monk embarrassed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m grateful for Sir\u2019s considerations, please rest assured.\u201d Song Qingshu knew that the Monk was already very polite. The second floor of the Buddhist scriptures pavilion was a forbidden area of the Shaolin Temple. He naturally can\u2019t go up there.Song Qingshu aimlessly flipped through the scriptures, he didn\u2019t intend to read anything at all. While casually flipping, he was looking for a person somewhere around here.After looking around for a long time, he didn\u2019t find the person he was looking for. Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t hide his disappointment, wondering if he had guessed wrong.\u201cHuh!\u201d Suddenly, he glanced at a dark corner and saw the two words \u201cLanga Sutra\u201d. Thinking that \u201cNine Suns True Scripture\u201d was hidden in it, Song Qingshu stretched out his hand excitedly and opened it.Although he knew that Zhang Wuji had learned the Nine Suns Scriptures, which proved that the scriptures may not be the Buddhist Scripture Pavilion anymore, he still held a trace of anticipation. As expected, it was empty inside. Song Qingshu sighed in disappointment.\u201cAmitabha Buddha!\u201d Song Qingshu was taken aback by the sound of the Buddha\u2019s name behind him. He turned around and found that unknown to him a monk in grey clothes quietly stood behind him.The other party was wearing the lowest-level attire of Shaolin Temple and holding a tattered broom. His body was thin and dry. He could be described as haggard and sparse and his long beards were completely white. In the eyes of anyone, he was just an old man who was about to die, but to Song Qingshu he was different.The Sweeping Monk! Song Qingshu did not expect that this unknown monk really existed.\u201cThis junior Song Qingshu has seen the respected master.\u201d Song Qingshu respectfully bowed.\u201cHuh?\u201d Old Monk didn\u2019t expect Song Qingshu to be so respectful to him, and he was curious, \u201cThis old monk is not a master, but I saw Young Hero Song walking around the Buddhist Scripture Pavilion, and he just scanned the other scriptures roughly until he saw this \u201cLanga Sutra.\u201d However, Young Hero Song did not hesitate to take it up, and after seeing the contents clearly, he looked disappointed. This old monk appeared to meet you out of curiosity.\u201d\u201cThis junior was just trying my luck, but found out that it was just a dream, so I seemed a little disappointed.\u201d Song Qingshu hesitated for a while and politely spoke.\u201cOld monk has been in the Buddhist Scripture Pavilion for more than forty years. If I remember correctly, this \u201cLanga Sutra\u201d used to have a copy of \u201cNine Suns True Scripture\u201d in it, but it was later taken away. I dare to ask Young Hero Song what he was looking for. Is that it?\u201d The Old Monk was indeed very curious. Song Qingshu was young, how could he know of the secrets in here, and he seemed to know it quite well.When he said that, Song Qingshu was also a little embarrassed: \u201cI don\u2019t want to hide it from the master, I really wanted to see if the \u201cNine Suns True Scripture\u201d is still there.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d The Old Monk laughed heartily and did not ask him why he knew such secrets. Instead, he asked with concern, \u201cIf Old monk is not wrong, Young Hero Song has all his meridians broken now, even if you find the Nine Suns Scripture Cultivation, will it be useful?\u201d\u201cI also hope that the master will help.\u201d When he thought that this person may be the only person in the world who could save him, Song Qingshu felt a little gloomy.\u201cYoung Hero Song\u2019s life is fine now, why do I need to save him?\u201d The Old Monk helped him up, \u201cIf you want to resume martial arts, please forgive this old monk\u2019s bluntness, Young Hero Song\u2019s meridian is completely broken, it is no longer under human power to restore it, and this old monk can also do nothing.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Sweeping Monk was almost a god-like existence in Jin Yong\u2019s book. If he said that he couldn\u2019t save him. It was really hopeless.Seeing that Song Qingshu had almost despaired, the Sweeping Monk silently chanted the Buddha\u2019s name and slowly said: \u201cMartial arts is something outside of the body, so why should the Young Hero be so persistent. Today, martial arts are performed and many murders are committed. Although there are occasional chivalrous people who have saved one or two people\u2019s lives, how can it be compared with Buddhism in saving sentient beings? Why not study Buddhism\u2026\u201dThe voice of the Sweeping Monk seemed to have a calming effect. Song Qingshu slowly calmed down, but when he heard the other party persuading him to convert to Buddhism, he was quite disapproving and quickly refused: \u201cThis junior gratefully accept Master\u2019s kindness, but this junior still has too much in his heart. Many suspicions need to be confirmed one by one, and it is really impossible to escape into the spiritual world.\u201d\u201cWell, if you are unwilling, I won\u2019t force you.\u201d Holy Monk shook his head, but he suddenly stretched out his fingers and poked a few places on Song Qingshu\u2019s body. Song Qingshu only felt a few warm currents spreading inside his body, and after doing this Holy Monk had already turned and left. His voice came from afar, \u201cOld Monk protected the Young Hero\u2019s meridians with true energy so that it will not shrink for the time being. Currently, I am afraid there are only four great doctors left, and maybe they have ways to deal with the Young Hero\u2019s injury\u2026\u201d\u201cFour genius doctors?\u201d Hearing Song Qingshu\u2019s question, Zhou Zhiruo wrinkled her delicate eyebrows and thought about it carefully. There is the genius doctor Xue of Zhoucheng, and, there is also the legendary Poisonous Hand Medicine King.\u201dSeeing her husband\u2019s expectant eyes, Zhou Zhiruo felt a little uncomfortable in her heart. She advised: \u201cQingshu, Zhang Wuji has obtained the true inheritance of Hu Qingniu. It can be said that he is an expert, and even he was helpless. The other Genius Doctor\u2019s medical skills are equal to Hu Qingniu. I don\u2019t think they can be of much help\u2026\u201dSong Qingshu thought she wanted to stay here and wait for Zhang Wuji, and didn\u2019t want to accompany him. He felt upset, and cried out \u201cDon\u2019t mention that person!\u201dBut, he regretted it as soon as he finished speaking.Zhou Zhiruo didn\u2019t expect him to react this way, but she knew very well that Song Qingshu had always hated Zhang Wuji because of her sake. Thinking that he had always had a deep affection for her. Zhou Zhirou\u2019s heart softened and she persuaded him softly, \u201cQingshu, there is nothing wrong with not having martial arts. It\u2019s not that important. Let\u2019s go back to Emei together, and don\u2019t care about the grievances in the outside world. Then, there won\u2019t be any difference between having or not having martial arts. Isn\u2019t that good enough?\u201dHe had never seen Zhou Zhiruo so tender and soft-spoken. Song Qingshu looked at her bright and moving eyes, and felt a little silly for a while.Seeing that he was staring at her in a daze, even if the two were already husband and wife in name, Zhou Zhiruo couldn\u2019t help being a little bit shy, and gave him an angry look: \u201cHaven\u2019t you seen enough for so long!\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen enough for a lifetime\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu replied subconsciously, he suddenly wondered how much her attitude had changed, and looked at her with uncertainty: \u201cAre you really willing to go back to Emei with me?\u201d\u201cYou are my husband, why won\u2019t I go back to Emei with you?\u201d Zhou Zhiruo said softly, but she couldn\u2019t hide a trace of loneliness deep in the corner of her eyes. Zhang Wuji took the initiative to hug her that night. Although Zhou Zhiruo refused, there was still a hint of joy in her heart.Knowing that Zhang Wuji always had a strong affection for her. It\u2019s a pity that after so many days, she didn\u2019t see what Zhang Wuji thought about her. She knew that the other party might still be thinking about the princess more. She was disappointed, thinking that Zhang Wuji was not as good as Song Qingshu. He wasn\u2019t able to do one-tenth of what Song Qingshu had done for her. She was a little frustrated that Song Qingshu had become a cripple. But Zhou Zhiruo just wanted to return to Emei as soon as possible to spend the rest of her life with him.Song Qingshu was overjoyed and couldn\u2019t help holding Zhou Zhiruo in his arms, thinking about his troubled times and martial arts. It would be worthwhile to have such a stunning beauty with him.Zhou Zhiruo was hugged in his arms without any warning, and her body couldn\u2019t help but become stiff, but thinking that he was, after all her husband, her body slowly softened.There was a fragrant body in his arms, and the exquisite curve quickly made Song Qingshu feel enthusiastic, and he lowered his head and kissed her face.Zhou Zhiruo wanted to dodge subconsciously, but suddenly remembered everything he had done for her, and felt a little dazed for a while.Song Qingshu was not the idiot who could only argue about emotions like before. Taking advantage of Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s hesitation, he successfully kissed her little cherry lips.Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s eyes widened suddenly, and Song Qingshu took the opportunity to knock her teeth open when she was shocked, and savor the taste of her sweet little tongue.Her breath had the aroma of orchids, her lips and teeth were sweet, at this moment Song Qingshu felt that his whole body experienced bliss. After the initial astonishment, Zhou Zhiruo closed her eyes as if surrendering to her fate, but her heart became a mess.Even if it was that brief hug with Zhang Wuji before, Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s heart beat so fast. But now, when she is kissing Song Qingshu, Zhou Zhiruo felt no special feelings. She just passively allowed him to do things. Only the girl\u2019s instinct is in her heart made her feel shyness and endless hesitation.Song Qingshu didn\u2019t know the thoughts in her heart. At this moment, he felt so happy. He wrapped her slender waist with one hand, and instinctively reached into her dress with the other hand, sneaking into the softness of her chest.\u201cPop!\u201d Feeling the coldness at her chest, Zhou Zhiruo suddenly reacted. She subconsciously slapped his hand away and broke free from Song Qingshu\u2019s embrace. She turned around and looked at him with a wave of slight anger on her face.Song Qingshu secretly screamed that this was bad, and he subconsciously used one of those modern flirting touch methods. How could he know that the other party is still a chaste girl from ancient times, how can she stand this kind of behavior? But being slapped in the face by a woman, although not that hard, he still felt a little bit awkward. He felt embarrassed for a while.Seeing the faint red mark on his face, Zhou Zhiruo thought that he was her husband after all, and felt a little apologetic, so she explained: \u201cNow this is a quiet place in Shaolin, and in broad daylight. You are embarrassing your family.\u201dSong Qingshu was overjoyed at what she said, \u201cCould it be that somewhere else, I can treat you like this at night?\u201dOf course, he didn\u2019t dare to say this out loud, so he said, \u201cNow my injury is almost healed, when will we return to Emei?\u201d He just wants to leave here as soon as possible, and stay as far away from Zhang Wuji as possible. Only then can he be at ease, plus with this legal husband and wife identity, won\u2019t he truly get her sooner or later?\u201cIt\u2019s too late today, let\u2019s take a rest and set off tomorrow morning.\u201d After Zhou Zhiruo finished speaking, she ran out, touching her hot face.Song Qingshu stayed in the room thinking about the wonderful feeling just now, sitting on the bed and giggling, thinking that God was really good to him. Not only did he make him a human again, but he also gave him such a beautiful fairy for nothing. Let\u2019s wake up! Does it really matter if he won\u2019t be able to practice martial arts in this life?When it got dark, Zhou Zhiruo returned to the house. After all, to outsiders, they were husband and wife, and they must sleep in a room. After helping Song Qingshu to lie down, Zhou Zhiruo lay down on another opposite bed.Song Qingshu kept drooling after staring at the graceful curves of Zhou Zhiruo on the opposite bed. It was a pity that such a peerless beauty was placed in front of him, but he could only see and couldn\u2019t eat.Slowly, his sleepiness surged, and at the moment Song Qingshu closed his eyes, a masked figure came in from the window and quickly tapped a few major acupuncture points all over his body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She immediately sat up and stared at the back of the opponent, using the Nine Yin White Bone Claw, her hands were ready to attack.\u201cZhiruo, it\u2019s me.\u201d The masked man turned around and pulled down his mask. It was the Ming Cult\u2019s leader Zhang Wuji.\u201cI don\u2019t know what Master Zhang intends to do by breaking into our bedroom in the middle of the night!\u201d Although Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s tone was cold, her force behind it slowly dissipated. She really didn\u2019t need to take precautions against Zhang Wuji.\u201cZhiruo, other people don\u2019t know about you husband and wife, but I know the truth.\u201d Zhang Wuji said softly while looking at the two sleeping in separate beds.Seeing that he knew that she and Song Qingshu were not married, Zhou Zhiruo couldn\u2019t tell whether she was happy or angry for a while, so she coldly said: \u201cMaster Zhang doesn\u2019t need to bother about the matter between us husband and wife.\u201dZhang Wuji slowly walked over and bitterly smiled: \u201cZhiruo, I know you must be angry with me for not coming to see you for so many days, but after the first battle with Sandu, I\u2019ve faced some troubles, and I\u2019ve been sorting things out these days. The true spirit is\u2026\u201d\u201cOh? How are you doing now~\u201d Zhou Zhiruo raised her eyebrows and didn\u2019t wait for him to answer, she anxiously grabbed his wrist to test his pulse.\u201cBarely okay now, The Holy Flame Tablets and the Heaven and Earth Great Shift are indeed strange martial arts from the Western Regions. If one is not careful, it is easy to get into trouble.\u201d In front of Zhou Zhiruo, Zhang Wuji did not have the slightest bit of distrust and let her check his meridians.\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that your breath is much weaker now.\u201d Zhou Zhiruo felt that Zhang Wuji was a little different from before, but she thought it was a side effect of the Seven Injuries Fist, so she didn\u2019t take it too seriously.\u201cZhiruo, you still care about me as much as you did when you were young.\u201d Zhang Wuji was moved and held her hands affectionately.Thinking of the time when they first met on the bank of the Han river, Zhou Zhiruo also seemed to be in a daze. When she looked up, she saw Zhang Wuji looking at her with his eyes full of affection.They never expected that Song Qingshu, who was supposed to be unconscious, was coldly Giwatching all this. It turned out that after he was tapped, the few True Qi left on him by the Nameless Monk reacted and made him come out from the lethargic condition. After all, It was just a bit of residual True Qi the Nameless Monk left behind in his meridians, and it was only enough to wake him up. Zhang Wuji was one of the great masters in the world. Would it the that easy to unlock all the acupuncture points sealed by him?Song Qingshu is now conscious, but completely unable to move.Looking affectionately at Zhou Zhiruo, Zhang Wuji couldn\u2019t help but lower his head for a kiss.Seeing Zhang Wuji\u2019s face getting closer and closer to her, Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s heart started beating rapidly. At this moment, she knew that her unforgettable love for Zhang Wuji might not be forgotten in this life.Suddenly thinking that she had become someone else\u2019s wife, Zhou Zhiruo felt a violent pain in her heart. She turned her head aside, pushed Wuji\u2019s chest, taking the opportunity to move back three steps. Tears glittering in her eyes, she angrily looked ahead and said: \u201cYou already have your princess, and I am married as someone\u2019s wife. What do you want to do?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Zhang Wuji shook his head in pain, \u201cI really love you so much, I can\u2019t bear to go on separate roads from this day and become strangers with you.\u201dHearing Zhang Wuji saying that he loved her, Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s heart skipped a beat and she bit her lips: \u201cWhat about Zhao Min?\u201d\u201cI love her too!\u201dSong Qingshu didn\u2019t expect that Zhang Wuji, who has always been emotionally indecisive, to be so straightforward this time. Zhou Zhiruo also sneered and said, \u201cThen what have you come to me for!\u201dZhang Wuji tore off his garb, revealing the scar on his chest that was left by the Heavenly Sword: \u201cZhiruo, your figure, like the Heavenly Sword, is always engraved on my heart. My heart beats for you, it hasn\u2019t changed. When I heard the news that you and Song\u2026Senior Brother Song were married, I wanted to die.\u201dSeeing the faint scar on his chest, Zhou Zhiruo recalled the feeling of heartbreak on the top of Guangming when she stabbed the sword. For a while, she was full of emotions and sighed quietly, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you come to claim your love? You knew. You knew that I used marriage as a bet with Qingshu. I bet you would come to claim your love, but I lost.\u201d After speaking, she smiled sadly.\u201cI was so stupid at the time, thinking that Brother Song loves you so much, you will be very happy after you get married.\u201d Zhang Wuji reached out and wanted to hug Zhou Zhiruo in his arms, but when she subconsciously stepped back, he could not help but speak in distress, \u201cAfter you got married, It cut my heart like a knife every day, only then I realized that I can\u2019t let you go, I can\u2019t let go of our love.\u201dZhang Wuji had never confided his heart in front of her like today. Zhou Zhiruo thought about it for a moment. She was delighted, but again thought of her current identity, and couldn\u2019t help but bitterly say: \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of saying this now, I am already Mrs. Song.\u201d\u201cThat name doesn\u2019t matter at all!\u201d Zhang Wuji angrily said, \u201cIn my heart, you will always be the kind and pure girl by the Han River.\u201d He stretched out his hand to brush the tears on her cheek, but Zhou Zhiruo took another step back.Zhang Wuji continued to move forward. Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s eyes were blurred for a moment, she bit her teeth and took a step back resolutely. As her mind was confused, she didn\u2019t notice her feet, and she stumbled on something. She lost her balance and fell on the bed behind her.\u201cBe careful!\u201d Zhang Wuji whispered and quickly rushed over to hold her, but Zhou Zhiruo subconsciously blocked him, and the two lost their balance together and fell onto the bed.Because the table in the room was blocking the view, Song Qingshu didn\u2019t know what happened just now. He only saw Zhou Zhiruo falling onto the bed as if she had accepted the development and lie down on the pillow. Zhang Wuji immediately pressed above her. Due to extreme anger, a mouthful of blood poured up his throat. As he just recovered from a serious injury, he couldn\u2019t endure it and suddenly fainted.The two fell on the bed and looked at each other, and a silent ambiguity spread.Seeing Zhang Wuji\u2019s hand slowly approaching the ribbon on her waist, Zhou Zhiruo suddenly became sober, she suddenly blocked him with her hand and sat up, hesitated, and said, \u201cNo, Qingshu\u2026\u201d She wanted to look at the one lying on the other bed, her husband. But was blocked by Zhang Wuji, unable to see him at all.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I sealed the acupuncture points of his whole body, he won\u2019t know.\u201d Zhang Wuji was confident in his skill and didn\u2019t mean to look back at all. He didn\u2019t know that the behavior of the two had fallen into Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes.After hearing Zhang Wuji\u2019s words, Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s mind went into a daze. When she saw Zhang Wuji put her hand aside, grab the bow of her belt, and was about to pull it gently, Zhou Zhiruo suddenly recovered and jumped out of the bed.Grabbing the teacup on the table, a splash of water was poured directly on Zhang Wuji\u2019s face. Zhou Zhiruo glanced back at her husband who was unconscious on the bed, and bit her silvery teeth: \u201cZhang Wuji, I hope you will respect yourself.\u201dZhang Wuji was startled, the tea slipped from his cheek, dripping onto the bedding, looking at Zhou Zhiruo in embarrassment.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you dodge?\u201d Zhou Zhiruo felt it was too much when she turned around to see his embarrassed appearance and softly asked.\u201cI have offended you. This cup of tea is well deserved.\u201d Zhang Wuji wiped the tea leaves off his face and bitterly smiled.Translator: Do you hate Zhou Zhirou?

If you really love me, as long as you promise to marry me, I will leave my current husband even if I have to face the ridicule of the world. Once we are married. On the night of our bridal chamber, you\u2026you can do what your heart desires.\u201d After saying this, Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s face turned red hot.Zhang Wuji\u2019s mind was agitated, and he stood up and thought about the pink future, \u201cZhiruo, I will definitely marry you!\u201dZhou Zhiruo subconsciously took a step back, clutching her collar, and said, \u201cI said that after getting married, you can do what you want\u2026but not now, I am still Mrs. Song, and I hope Master Zhang will respect me until then.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, I was abrupt.\u201d Zhang Wuji hurriedly nodded.\u201cBrother Wuji, are you really willing to marry me?\u201d Zhou Zhiruo was pleased and shyly asked again.\u201cOf course! I am willing to marry you.\u201d Zhang Wuji walked to her and looked at her affectionately.Zhou Zhiruo softly sighed, \u201cBrother Wuji\u2026\u201d At this sweet moment, both of them subconsciously avoided mentioning Zhao Min.The two stayed quiet for a while, when Zhou Zhiruo suddenly saw Song Qingshu lying on the opposite bed, thinking that she was now Mrs. Song, she felt a pain in her heart, and faintly sighed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Qingshu.\u201dZhang Wuji comforted her, \u201cZhiruo, we were originally a couple. You have never loved him, so why should you feel sorry for him.\u201d\u201cBut we can\u2019t always hide like this.\u201d Zhou Zhiruo rolled her eyes and looked at Song Qingshu\u2019s face, her eyes turning cold, \u201cOr I will kill him, you go back and kill Zhao Min, so no one can hinder us from meeting each other from now on.\u201d\u201cHow can I do that?\u201d Zhang Wuji was scoffed. Although he liked Zhou Zhiruo, it would be impossible for him to abandon Zhao Min.\u201cBrother Wuji, I deliberately tested you.\u201d Zhou Zhiruo slyly smiled, \u201cI am already very sorry for my husband. If I kill him, what is the difference between me and those bad women in history? If you really agreed just now. When the time comes, I don\u2019t dare to associate with you anymore. You want to be Ximenqing, but I don\u2019t want to be Pan Jinlian.\u201dAfter Zhang Wuji was stunned, he smiled and said, \u201cMy little Zhiruo is indeed the kindest\u2026\u201dThe next day the sun shone into the room, Song Qingshu woke up to find that the room was empty, and the bed opposite was also neat and tidy, leaving no traces at all. He breathed a long sigh of relief, wondering: \u201cCould it be that it was just a dream last night?\u201dSuddenly Song Qingshu\u2019s face sank. He noticed that the sheets on the opposite bed had been changed. Although the difference was not that noticeable, Song Qingshu clearly remembered that this was not the one from yesterday. Why would you change the sheets? Song Qingshu looked up at the sky, and muttered to the air: \u201cIf you are alive in the sky, you should know that it\u2019s not as if your brother didn\u2019t work hard, but it was your beloved wife, who actually rolled on the same bed with Zhang Wuji.\u201dHow could Song Qingshu know that the bedsheet was wet with tea last night, and Zhou Zhiruo deliberately changed it to a clean one?\u201cQingshu, are you awake?\u201d Zhou Zhiruo walked in with a basin of hot water and saw Song Qingshu wake up, squeezed the towel dry, and handed it over.Song Qingshu glanced at her with disgust, thinking that this woman had done something to feel guilty towards her husband last night, and now out of that guilt, she showed tenderness and consideration she never showed before.\u201cWhy have the bed sheets changed?\u201d Song Qingshu quietly took the towel and asked knowingly.Zhou Zhiruo glanced behind her with a guilty conscience, then said: \u201cIt was accidentally soiled, so I changed it.\u201d\u201cOh~\u201d Song Qingshu stopped asking, he didn\u2019t dare to press too hard.When Zhou Zhiruo went out to pour water, he didn\u2019t know if it was a psychological suggestion or not. As Song Qingshu watched her walking around, her face seemed to have lost a young girl\u2019s youthfulness, and a young woman\u2019s charmingness appeared, and his heart was irritated for no reason.\u201cYou unlucky ghost, brother, I will avenge you.\u201d Now that it has happened, there\u2019s no choice but to face it. Song Qingshu has never been an evader but considering that he can\u2019t even beat a disciple of Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s school, let alone Zhang Wuji, who is famous for martial arts. And, in the original book, what lied beneath Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s gentle appearance was not a weak and kind heart. If something goes wrong, not only the grudge would not be reported but he will be killed instead.While he was thinking, a burst of hearty laughter came in, \u201cBrother Song is looking much better now, it seems that his injury is almost healed.\u201dSong Qingshu looked up and found that Zhang Wuji had walked straight in. The blood vessels in the corners of his eyes couldn\u2019t help beating for a while, and he coldly said, \u201cWhat are you here for?\u201dEveryone at the scene knew that Song Qingshu had a grudge against Zhang Wuji, and he was not surprised by Song Qingshu\u2019s tone of voice. Zhang Wuji didn\u2019t care about his attitude. Instead, he smiled graciously: \u201cI heard that Brother Song was worrying about his meridians, so I came here to take a look. I hope to do my best.\u201d\u201cBrother Wuji, it seems that some people doesn\u2019t appreciate your good will.\u201d At this time, a sweet and crisp female voice came over.Song Qingshu was full of anger just now, and did not notice Zhang Wuji\u2019s companion. Only now did he find out, the eyes of the woman that spoke just now were as clear as water, and her face shining like jade, faintly red and rosy, just like the first bloom of a flower, beautiful and gorgeous. It made people unconsciously feel a sense of inferiority; not daring to look at it.It turned out that Zhao Min was angry because her sweetheart was being ridiculed by Song Qingshu\u2019s words, and came up to retort for him. Song Qingshu gave Zhao Min a fierce look.She was born with an aura of dignity because of her noble birth. People would feel respect when looking at her, but Song Qingshu was a traverser, coupled with the hostility towards Zhang Wuji in his heart, of course, he would feel no such things. He felt no pressure as he stared and withdrew his gaze only after he had finished looking. There was no need for a serious fight for now.This Zhang Wuji really had all the blessings of god, having the hearts of two such beautiful women, but Song Qingshu was even angrier when he thought that this guy already had such a beautiful princess and he still came to provoke Zhou Zhiruo.Zhao Min glanced at him, and felt as if her body had been seen through without clothes. She was very uncomfortable. She flashed behind Zhang Wuji and had a bad impression of Song Qingshu in her heart.\u201cQingshu, yesterday I heard that you mentioned that the four great physicians in the world might be able to treat your meridians. I thought that Master Zhang had the true inheritance of Hu Qingniu, and I specially asked him to come over to see if it is possible to renew your meridians.\u201d Zhou Zhiruo said. She didn\u2019t even look at Zhang Wuji. Her words while mentioning his name were also extremely cold. Zhao Min and others thought that Zhou Zhiruo still harbored resentment towards Zhang Wuji in her heart, only Song Qingshu secretly sneered.\u201cDidn\u2019t he say that there is no way to cure it last time?\u201d Song Qingshu glanced at the two with disdain.\u201cBrother Song, there really was no way when I came last time. Later, I went back and searched through the medical books of the past. Then I found a method, maybe I could try it.\u201d Zhang Wuji didn\u2019t show the slightest anger, his demeanor made everyone think, \u201cWhat a gentleman!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Song Qingshu was a little moved. Since he was sure that this was Jin Yong\u2019s martial arts world, he was a bit smug for a while. He was familiar with the plot, so many treasures and martial arts secrets in the world seemed easily available to him, but now his meridians werecrippled. He was weak, all of his plans were nothing but a dream. In today\u2019s troubled times, if he couldn\u2019t even go and find those treasures, then he won\u2019t be able to practice using cheat methods. Now that he heard Zhang Wuji has a way to cure him. At that moment, Song Qingshu even felt that as long as he was cured, he could even forget about the affairs with Zhou Zhiruo. Anyway, the one who will suffer is that unlucky ghost, not him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can only try my best. The probability of success is only 10 or 20 percent. I wonder if Brother Song is willing to try again?\u201d Zhang Wuji thought carefully, then he spoke with a frown.\u201c10 or 20 percent chances are enough, you do your best.\u201d For the desperate Song Qingshu, 10 or 20 percent is indeed very high. If Zhang Wuji came and said that he had more than half of the hope that he could be cured, Song Qingshu would not believe him. After all, even the Sweeping Monk was helpless, and now that Zhang Wuji said this, a glimmer of hope suddenly rose in Song Qingshu\u2019s heart.\u201cBrother Wuji, I don\u2019t think you should try it anymore, so that you won\u2019t be blamed as a villain if it fails.\u201d Zhao Min felt that her sweetheart\u2019s actions this time were a bit abrupt, and this Song Qingshu would not be grateful even if he was cured. If he is not cured, she was afraid of what Song Qingshu would do afterward. At that time, all kinds of rumors will spread.\u201cRelax, I know it in my heart.\u201d Zhang Wuji said in a deep voice. Zhao Min thought he wanted to heal Song Qingshu\u2019s injury to make up for his debt to Zhou Zhiruo, so she didn\u2019t say any more.\u201cMiss Zhao, please rest assured, if I am not cured, that means this Song is destined to not escape this disaster. I will not blame anyone.\u201d Song Qingshu assured her.Zhao Min thought in her heart, \u201cWhen did Song Qingshu become so open-minded?\u201dZhou Zhiruo was also felt a little strange, but she felt ashamed in her heart and didn\u2019t think too much about it.Song Qingshu was a little worried at first that Zhang Wuji wanted to take the opportunity to kill him, but then he thought that Zhang Wuji promised to treat him in front of so many people today. If he can\u2019t get a good treatment, it\u2019s fine.If he is treated to death, considering that everyone already knew about the relationship between Zhou Zhiruo and Zhang Wuji from back then. Everyone in the martial arts will think that Zhang Wuji is a shameless villain who kills the husband and seizes his wife.In the next period of time, Zhang Wuji often came to give Song Qingshu acupuncture and moxibustion, administering medicine, and exercise therapy to heal his injuries. After a few days, his internal strength was exhausted.On the contrary, Song Qingshu was a little bit upset, thinking that how could Zhang Wuji be so benevolent even to his rival in love.\u201cTake medicine, Qingshu.\u201d Zhou Zhiruo brought a bowl of black Chinese medicine over and raised his head to feed him a couple of mouthfuls.Snuggling against Zhou Zhiruo, feeling the elasticity of her body, as well as the faint fragrance, Song Qingshu was a little worried for a while. During this period of time, he did not relax his vigilance at all. Every night he was on guard against Zhang Wuji coming to steal the fragrant jade, just like he did last time.After a few days, there was nothing unusual, and no one came to point his acupuncture points, and he thought of Shaomin. The princess is also not an ordinary character, she was both wise and intelligent. This time she knew that Zhang Wuji often came into contact with Zhou Zhiruo. If he could come to private meetings every night without telling her, Zhao Min would not be able to hold the title of Crafty Princess.Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s twin mountains seem to have grown bigger again. While drinking the medicine, Song Qingshu\u2019s gaze lightly swept across the chest of the beautiful woman beside him, and he smiled evilly. Suddenly Song Qingshu thought of a terrible possibility, and his smile came to an abrupt stop.\u201cZhiruo, I don\u2019t feel well in my stomach, so have to go out and relieve myself.\u201d Song Qingshu pretended to be in pain with a very contorted expression on his face.Zhou Zhiruo pursed her lips and stood up, tidying up her dress, and letting go. Song Qingshu ran all the way out of the hut, took a close look to check if anyone was around, and quickly stretched out his finger to his throat and scratched, and immediately vomited all the potion he had just drunk.It turned out that Song Qingshu had just noticed that Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s chest was getting fuller and fuller, and suddenly remembered that a girl\u2019s place would only become fuller when it was often moisturized by rain and dew. He had been guarding against the two of them cheating at night, and suddenly realized that, what if they were cheating during the day?Song Qingshu relaxed his vigilance in the past because it was broad daylight. Now, in retrospect, after every time he took the medicine, he would be unconscious for a while. At that time, he thought that the drowsiness he felt was similar to the side effects of taking certain western medicines in his previous life. He didn\u2019t think too deeply into it.Not long after returning to the room, Song Qingshu pretended to be fatigued, his eyelids seemed to open and closed, and soon he fell asleep.\u201cQingshu\u2026Qingshu?\u201d Zhou Zhiruo gently pushed him a few times, wondering in her heart: \u201cWhy do you fall asleep so quickly every time you take medicine?\u201d\u201cNo need to shout, after the ten fragrances and loose tendons went through my improvement, he won\u2019t wake up within an hour.\u201d At this moment, Zhang Wuji\u2019s voice came over, and Song Qingshu was shocked, and then his body lost all strength, his eyes losing focus.Hearing what the two said, Song Qingshu finally understood that the two were really hooking up after he was made to sleep, and the anger in his heart was like a volcano waiting to erupt. \u2018Hehehe, I was really naive, thinking that they were trying to save me. This was a disguise all along! It was all so that it would be convenient for them to cheat.\u2019\u201cZhang Wuji, what do you mean?\u201d Seeing Song Qingshu\u2019s tilted head, Zhou Zhiruo hurriedly stretched out her finger to probe his nose, and she breathed a sigh of relief when she felt his breath. Turning her head to look at Zhang Wuji, Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s face suddenly sank.\u201cOtherwise, how can we have the opportunity to say something between ourselves if he is awake? It is always inconvenient.\u201d Zhang Wuji said as he looked at the sleeping Song Qingshu.\u201cMaster Zhang, I hope you will respect my dignity!\u201d Zhou Zhiruo stood up, speaking with a hint of chill in her tone, \u201cI did promise to reunite with you before, but to Song Qingshu, I owe him, you must heal him. Otherwise, there will always be a thorn in my heart, and it will be impossible to live with myself.\u201dZhang Wuji was silent for a while, and replied, \u201cThat is natural.\u201d\u201cAre you\u2026really able to cure Qingshu?\u201d Zhou Zhiruo noticed the uncertainty in his tone and asked suspiciously.Zhang Wuji hesitated for a moment, and still said, \u201cBrother Song\u2019s meridians are completely broken, it is no longer in a state where it can be healed by medicine. I have a certain degree of certainty, but in fact, it is not that much.\u201d\u201cIt turns out that you just wanted to take the opportunity to approach me for the treatment of Qingshu!\u201d Zhou Zhiruo glared at him angrily, \u201cI wondered why Qingshu fell asleep as soon as he drank the medicine during this period. It turns out that everything was caused by you.\u201d\u201cIt is inevitable that there will be some rumors if I didn\u2019t do this, and they are not very good for both you and me.\u201d Zhang Wuji bitterly smiled.\u201cI will not pursue this matter from before, but you must cure Qingshu.\u201d Zhou Zhiruo said matter of factly.\u201cThat condition again. Why\u2026 why do you care about him so much?\u201d Zhang Wuji was jealous.\u201cPerhaps this is just a reason to persuade me to leave my husband and be devoted to you\u2026\u201d Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s tone was full of sadness, \u201cBrother Wuji, you don\u2019t have any problems, but I am a married woman and always have my own concerns.\u201d\u201cI was wrong, forgive me, little sister Zhiruo.\u201d Zhang Wuji quickly apologized.\u201cYou obviously have superb medical skills, how can you not be able to cure Qingshu\u2019s injuries?\u201d Zhou Zhiruo suddenly flashed an idea, she stared at him, and asked, \u201cIt won\u2019t be because Qingshu is my husband, and you are feeling jealous. So, you want to kill him on purpose.\u201d\u201cHow can that be?\u201d Zhang Wuji waved his hand quickly, \u201cI tried my best.\u201dZhou Zhiruo kept staring at him intently until he looked a little unnatural, and then said lightly, \u201cWell, I believe you for the time being. But this kind of treatment can\u2019t continue, I will take Qingshu back to Emei to recover. When you think of a cure for Qingshu, only then you can come to me again.\u201dZhang Wuji opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but Zhou Zhiruo didn\u2019t give him a chance, and coldly said, \u201cSomeone, send Master Zhang out.\u201dSeeing Zhang Wuji leaving helplessly, Zhou Zhiruo muttered to herself, \u201cBrother Wuji, I know you can save him. It only depends on whether you are willing to pay such a high price for me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He suddenly felt a sense of disgust. His thoughts began to spin in his mind, and thought about how to take revenge. He also thought of Zhang Wuji\u2019s martial arts and his status as the leader of the Ming Cult. The Ming Cult can fight against Mongolia in the Western Regions. It can be seen that his strength is enormous.Song Qingshu himself, on the other hand, is now a cripple, and he has no martial arts and no power. So how can he get revenge? A sense of powerlessness spread throughout his already weak body.Inadvertently, he glanced at Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s beautiful face again, and Song Qingshu\u2019s fighting spirit burned with a newfound hatred.His meridians are broken? So what?He just has to find a way to fix it. He can roughly remember the Jiuyin Scripture and the Eighteen Palms of the Dragon Slaying Sword from \u2018The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber\u2019, and coupled with the familiarity with secrets in this world, it\u2019s not so difficult to practice certain peerless martial arts, and then find those treasures. With how chaotic this world is, it will be easy to build up a force, and finally fight against Zhang Wuji.When his thoughts became clearer and clearer, Song Qingshu\u2019s mood gradually calmed down. He also thought about secretly informing Zhao Min to come over and catch the adultery, but Zhao Min is a terribly smart woman, it is hard to guarantee that she will not expose him to Zhang Wuji for some reason, and then he will be in trouble instead, and then the three of them will definitely not allow him to continue living. He would die a miserable death\u2026his body shuddered when he thought about it.The next day, in front of everyone, when Zhang Wuji regretfully announced that he could not do anything about the broken meridians, Zhou Zhiruo was still a little worried that Song Qingshu would lose his temper. But she did not expect that Song Qingshu just calmly took a sip of tea, and flatly said, \u201cIt\u2019s God\u2019s will. So, this Song can\u2019t blame anyone. I feel sorry for having troubled Master Zhang during this period of time.\u201dNow when even Zhao Min looked at him in surprise, Song Qingshu responded with a faint smile, but the storm in his heart kept developing his future revenge plan.This ability was the result of his bitter experience from his previous life in the society. Unless victory is determined, he will never expose his resentment in advance. Otherwise, his opponent will prepare early and guard against it.After chatting for a while, because of the intense war in the Western Regions, Zhang Wuji had to lead his group to leave early. Zhou Zhiruo ordered her disciples to pack up and set off on the road back to Emei.\u201cThe Master seems to have become more and more beautiful recently.\u201d The two young female disciples sincerely flattered Zhou Zhiruo along the way.Zhou Zhiruo was beautiful before, but there was always a gloomy color between her eyebrows, which made people feel a little scared. Now there was a slight smile on the corner of her lips at all times. In contrast, she was indeed a bit brighter than before.\u201cZhiruo is naturally beautiful. Of course, she will become more and more beautiful.\u201d Song Qingshu gently took Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s little hand, and looked at her affectionately. Feeling her smooth and tender skin, he sneered in his heart.The disciples didn\u2019t know the reason, but he knew it clearly!For the past few days, Zhou Zhiruo was irrigated with the essence of Zhang Wuji\u2019s Nine Suns\u2019 True Qi every day, of course, she was even more charming and moving.Because a disciple was watching, Zhou Zhiruo was too embarrassed to directly withdraw her hand. After all, Song Qingshu was her husband, but she was a little impatient in her heart, and her eyes gradually became cold. Although she regarded herself as Mrs. Song in front of Zhang Wuji, it did not mean that She really allowed Song Qingshu to do some intimate things between husband and wife.Song Qingshu felt that it was enough, so he let go of her hands and leisurely sat on the carriage.After a lot of probing over the past two days, he already has some plans in his mind. Although there is little hope of renewing his meridians, he still has to try something before he is reconciled. The four great physicians in the world, Ping Yizhi, Xue of Zhoucheng, Huang Yaoshi, and Hu Qingniu. Since Zhang Wuji couldn\u2019t do anything, there\u2019s not much hope they can do anything either. The only one left is the most mysterious Poisonous Hand Medicine King, and there is a possibility where he will be at White Horse Temple near Dongting Lake. After giving it a lot of thought, Song Qingshu determined that only this way he has the greatest hope.If everything goes well and his meridians are cured, then not only will he be able to practice martial arts on his own, but also go and acquire all the magical secrets and treasures in this world.That is only if everything goes according to his plan. If unfortunately, it\u2019s really impossible to heal, then it\u2019s not a major problem to not learn martial arts. Wei Xiaobao was not a martial arts expert. Yes, there is always a way, and he was a person who climbed up step by step in his previous life. There was no reason he could not do the same in this life!Song Qingshu is the type of person who will continue to persevere unless he is dead, otherwise, he will not give up even if there is the smallest of hope.\u2018I was ready to leave without saying goodbye, but before I leave, I have to charge some interest on some people.\u2019 Thinking of this, Song Qingshu squinted his eyes and looked at Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s back. Zhou Zhiruo, who was sitting in front, suddenly felt a trace of goosebumps all over her body, and couldn\u2019t help tightening her clothes tightly.After nightfall, the group of four found an inn in a small town. After dinner, the two female disciples cleverly went back to their room to rest. Zhou Zhiruo frowned and followed Song Qingshu into his room. Seeing only one bed, her expression turned a bit ugly.Song Qingshu followed her gaze, quickly understood what was going on, and said with a smile: \u201cZhiruo, you sleep on the bed tonight.\u201d\u201cThen what about you?\u201d Zhou Zhiruo didn\u2019t expect Song Qingshu to be so thoughtful, and her heart warmed. Suddenly her face flushed with a trace of red.\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep on the floor.\u201d Song Qingshu glanced at her cheek strangely.\u201cHow can you do that? You hurt your bones, and the ground is too cold, it can make you ill.\u201d Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s words warmed Song Qingshu. It seems that she is not completely without conscience.\u201cWhat will we do if I don\u2019t.\u201d Song Qingshu glanced at the only bed in the room, and his meaning was obvious, \u201cShould we sleep on one bed?\u201d\u201cHow can we do that?\u201d Zhou Zhiruo immediately shook her head. If she didn\u2019t make a future agreement with Zhang Wuji, maybe Zhou Zhiruo would agree to it considering they were a couple. Anyway, now she needed a quilt in order to stay in the same room. As she was stronger than him, she wasn\u2019t afraid that he would have any bad thoughts.Song Qingshu gave a wry smile: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll go to the store to get a few more mattresses and spread them on the floor.\u201dThinking that one day she would abandon him and become the wife of the person he hates most, Zhou Zhiruo felt a little guilty. Hearing this, she quickly got up: \u201cYour injury is not healed. Sit and rest. I will get it.\u201d After that, she hurried out.Seeing that a fairy-like girl came to borrow the mattress, the inn owner was ecstatic and enthusiastically got her a few. Before leaving, he looked at Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s back and asked, \u201cFairy, do you need a quilt?\u201dZhou Zhiruo was still a little happy until she returned to the room. Which woman didn\u2019t like being praised by men for her beauty? She happily helped Song Qingshu tidy up the floor as well. It was inconvenient for the disciples to know that the two had no husband and wife relationship, so she had to do everything herself.When the work was finally finished, Zhou Zhiruo raised her hand and wiped the fine sweat from her forehead. Song Qingshu poured a cup of tea and handed it over: \u201cZhiruo, you have worked hard, drink some tea.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Belated\u00a0revengeZhou Zhiruo happened to be a little thirsty, so she picked it up and drank it all. Then the two spoke a few customary words and became silent again. So, Zhou Zhiruo had to say: \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, let\u2019s rest.\u201dAfter saying that, she came to the bed and sat down, but was surprised to find Song Qingshu was also behind her, and she said with a slightly unhappy face: \u201cWhat are you doing here? Your bed is over there.\u201dSong Qingshu had a weird smile on his face, and sat down on the bed: \u201cI want to sleep in this bed.\u201dZhou Zhiruo became angry in her heart, but she remained composed, and stood up, \u201cThen I will go to sleep on the ground.\u201d\u201cNo need, I want to sleep with you.\u201d Song Qingshu merrily laughed.\u201cYou!\u201d Zhou Zhiruo suspected if there was a problem in his head. She raised her hand and tried to slap him, but suddenly her eyes went dark and she fell weakly on the bed.Song Qingshu smiled and looked at the bed. He gazed at Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s eyes which blinked with surprise and said \u201cMiss, how does it feel to be weaker than your husband?\u201dZhou Zhiruo was startled, then she thought of the cup of tea he had just handed over, and whispered, \u201cSong Qingshu, are you crazy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m crazy?\u201d Song Qingshu laughed strangely, \u201cI\u2019m indeed crazy. I watched you and Zhang Wuji dancing up and down in front of me, but I still had to pretend to not know anything.\u201d\u201cWhat dancing?\u201d Zhou Zhiruo was shocked and thought that Song Qingshu had found out about the agreement between her and Zhang Wuji. So she said with a guilty conscience: \u201cYou knew? Impossible, were you not\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I get my acupuncture points sealed?\u201d Song Qingshu touched her smooth face and slowly said, \u201cFortunately, the heavens have eyes. I woke up by a coincidence and saw everything. I also vomited out all the medicine, and only then did I know the ugliness of you two adulterous couple.\u201dIf it wasn\u2019t for these two people pretending to heal him, while secretly having their lovers rendezvous, Song Qingshu would not be so angry. He would have left peacefully. But, their act of cheating made him decide to take revenge.\u201cSong Qingshu! What do you want?\u201d Zhou Zhiruo felt her scalp turn numb after being touched on her face.\u201cSuch a beautiful night, you and I are lying on the same bed, and we are also husband and wife. What do you think I want?\u201d Song Qingshu began to unbutton the buttons on her collar, one after another, and he deliberately did it very, very slowly.\u201cSong Qingshu, how dare you!\u201d As her clothes were untied little by little, Zhou Zhiruo blushed and she scolded with raised eyebrows.\u201cI\u2019m your husband, what\u2019s wrong with asking you to do your wife\u2019s responsibilities?\u201d Song Qingshu finally released the restraints on the outside of the dress, admiring the pale pink coat inside, \u201cOh, the embroidered mandarin duck!\u201d\u201cSong Qingshu, I will definitely kill you!\u201d Feeling a chill in her chest, Zhou Zhiruo was trembling with anger as she thought of the nightmare that was about to come.\u201cDying under such a beautiful flower, I will be a happy ghost. Also, I think it\u2019ll be worth it to be able to enjoy a good night with such a famous beauty of this world.\u201d Song Qingshu held her fragrant shoulders, helped her up, and slid his hand through the hair on her head. The bun on Zhou Zhirou\u2019s head was loosened, and the blue silk was scattered on the snow-white skin of her shoulders. Her beauty made Song Qingshu\u2019s breath stop for a moment.\u201cQingshu, can you please let me go, you used to be so good to me, why are you doing this now?\u201d Zhou Zhiruo saw that Song Qingshu was not threatened at all, and her heart became more and more flustered, and she couldn\u2019t help whispering and pleading.\u201cWhen I saw you lying under Zhang Wuji, not refusing\u2026that was the moment when the previous Song Qingshu died.\u201d Song Qingshu said coldly, his fingers pulling on the knot on the back of her neck, Zhou Zhirou\u2019s pink coat Silently slipped down to her waist.\u201cYou misunderstood\u2026\u201d Zhou Zhiruo had thought that Song Qingshu was so angry because he knew of her promise to be together with Zhang Wuji, but now she knew that was not the case at all.\u201cMisunderstanding?\u201d Song Qingshu smiled coldly, \u201cWill there be any misunderstanding when I\u2019ve seen everything with my own eyes? Stop spouting nonsense! It will only make me look down on you even more.\u201d\u201cI have done nothing wrong with him!\u201d Knowing that all explanations were in vain, Zhou Zhiruo closed her eyes in pain, and a drop of clear tear fell from the corner of her eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s so fragrant!\u201d Song Qingshu raised his head, feeling that the time was almost right, he lowered his body\u2026Goblinslate: So what are your thoughts about this type of revenge?

Don\u2019t worry, your internal strength will slowly recover after dawn. .\u201dNo matter how great her anger was, she was tossed about so many times, and Zhou Zhiruo felt her body was almost destroyed.

When he went out, he seemed to remember something, and turning back he said, \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for reminding you now, except you and me, no one knows what happened tonight. You wouldn\u2019t be so stupid to tell Zhang Wuji the truth, would you?\u201d After speaking, he laughed and went away.As time passed slowly, the sun began to rise. Zhou Zhiruo opened her eyes and sat up from the bed. The numbness and pain coming from below made her almost lie down again, watching the fair-skinned body full of love bite everywhere. Zhou Zhiruo grabbed the traces on the bed from last night and smashed the bed with her hands. She gritted her teeth and said, \u201cSong Qingshu, I will make sure you die a gruesome death!\u201d\u201cAchoo!\u201d Song Qingshu, who was dozens of miles away, sneezed, looked up at the sky, and smiled bitterly: \u201d I\u2019m afraid that woman is already awake. Was my behavior a little bit too extreme?\u201dSong Qingshu learned at that moment that she was actually still a virgin, and the reason why he continued to humiliate her like that later was actually to arouse Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s hatred towards him, so as not to make her commit suicide in sadness and despair.Although he knew that if Zhou Zhiruo caught him, that would be a dead-end for him. If she really had done anything with Zhang Wuji, Song Qingshu might have really got rid of her cruelly to end his troubles. But, now that Song Qingshu knew he was her first man, he had confidence it\u2019ll work out in the end\u2026probably.Besides, even if he was a cruel person, he was not stupid. He clearly considered that killing Zhou Zhiruo would do more harm than good. So, he let her live.For example, Zhou Zhiruo will quietly pursue and try to kill him the next day, but she won\u2019t dare to say anything to anyone. On the contrary, if Zhou Zhiruo is killed and she goes missing, then he will become the biggest suspect, and everyone in the world will think that he killed her. Not to mention Zhang Wuji and the Emei faction\u2019s endless pursuit and killing, people all over the world will spurn him, and then his reputation will be completely rotten.Don\u2019t underestimate the word \u2018fame\u2019. In this ancient world, if there was bad fame stuck on his back. He\u2019s afraid he won\u2019t be able to stand up for a lifetime. Everyone knows that no matter what the\u00a0 King of Pingxi Wu Sangui did, there were a lot of people who would jump out and pull him by his legs to take him down. That was the inevitable result of notoriety. Song Qingshu still wanted to make a name for himself in these troubled times, thus how could he be so unwise to bear the notoriety of killing his wife?Song Qingshu estimated that Zhou Zhiruo was already on the way to kill him. He had mentioned the four great genius physicians in the world, and Zhou Zhiruo should have guessed that he was going to seek them to treat his meridians.Hu Qingniu was dead; of the remaining three great doctors, Kaifeng\u2019s Ping Yizhi was the nearest from here, and Songzhou city\u2019s Xue was the next best doctor. The King of Venoms\u2019s whereabouts is the most secretive. Ordinary people don\u2019t know where to find him, but for Song Qingshu, it\u2019s not that difficult.Song Qingshu, as a modern person, was very familiar with the plot of Jin Yong\u2019s novels. He knew very well that King of Venoms was probably staying in the White Horse Temple, which was located at Wuchang-Yueyang areas in the Dongting Lake basin.If there are no accidents, Zhou Zhiruo will surely go to Kaifeng and Songzhou first, and finally, find the mysterious Poisonous Hand Medicine King. He should be safe for the time being. Song Qingshu was determined in his heart and strode towards Dongting Lake.After half a month of rushing, Song Qingshu finally came to the vicinity of the Dongting Lake basin. He began inquiring about the location of the White Horse Temple in many cities, and people who were asked said that they had never heard of this place.Hungry and thirsty along the way, Song Qingshu found a restaurant in the town, ordered wine and food, and drank the wine while thinking about his future.It was no wonder that he was depressed, not to mention whether the King of Venoms could heal his meridians. Now he couldn\u2019t even find the White Horse Temple. In addition, who knew where the plot of \u201cFlying Fox of Snowy Mountain\u201d was going. If the King of Venoms was already dead, then he really will have nowhere else left to cry.He felt no pleasure of being a tourist. Since Song Qingshu had transmigrated into this chaotic world, the only fortunate thing was that he was alive. But he had no intimate feelings for this world, the heaven was vast, and he was like a stranger, all alone. He has never regarded Song Yuanqiao as his father, not to mention that the Wudang Sect had already severed their ties with Song Qingshu because of Mo Shenggu\u2019s affairs, and his meridians were also given by the Wudang Sect.Thinking about it, the person closest to him was his nominal wife Zhou Zhiruo, but she was now chasing him all over the world to kill him.With a wry smile, Song Qingshu suddenly felt that life was full of gloom and gray.\u201cGet up, give your seat to this uncle!\u201d With a bang, a foot stepped on the bench next to Song Qingshu, and a knife was also thrown on the table as a demonstration.In the world of martial arts, a restaurant was indeed a troubled place. Song Qingshu was depressed enough, but he didn\u2019t expect this kind of thing to happen to him. After looking at the other empty tables, Song Qingshu stared strangely at the three big and five thick men around him, \u2018Wasn\u2019t there many empty seats around him? They want to sit only in this particular location?\u2019\u201cOld Master here wants to sit in your position.\u201d It was obviously the boss who spoke, \u201cYou have a good view here. If you know better, get out of Old Master\u2019s way and save yourself a beating.\u201dThe other guys laughed in unison and said: \u201cOur boss hates this kind of fresh face, this guy is unlucky today.\u201d\u201cThis kid has the face of a white rabbit, he must have just walked out of his rabbit hole.\u201dSong Qingshu laughed, he was in dire straits, so it was all right to be bullied by great figures like Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo, and now even some local ruffians came to pee on his head.From the experience of his previous life, in this situation, he had at least four or five ways to avoid conflicts, and not look so helpless. However, ever since he came over to this world, he has always had a surreal feeling in his heart, and after discovering that this was the world constituted by Jin Yong\u2019s novels, he had a vague sense of uncertainty. In his opinion, the characters in this world were just low-level creatures. That was it.As soon as he woke up, he found that his meridians were all broken, and then his nominal wife was in love with another man, and when he touched her body, she began to chase him all over the world, hell-bent on killing him. Now if he bows his head and it was to this kind of passerby NPC, then he could truly be regarded as the shame of all the transmigrators out there.Song Qingshu smiled lightly, ignored the ruffians around him, and took a slow sip of the wine before him.\u201cOh!\u201d The ruffian leader smirked and slapped his wine glass away to the ground with a slap. Song Qingshu didn\u2019t get angry, picked up the chopsticks, picked up a shrimp, and slowly delivered it to his mouth.\u201cFuck!\u201d The ruffian leader before him realized that he was ignored, his face twitched, and he picked up the staff of the person next to him and hit Song Qingshu on the back.\u201cPuff!\u201d Song Qingshu staggered, and the sip of wine he had just drunk was also sprayed out, colored with a trace of blood. He made this decision just now and was ready to be beaten. Some things may seem ridiculous to others, but he has to persist.Of course, he was not a fool, if he was still north of the Yangtze River, he would not dare to be so rash. It was fortunate that now he was in the prosperous area of the Song Dynasty. Unlike the war-torn North, the deterrent power of the government still existed here. These small fries will at most beat him up, but they don\u2019t have the courage to kill him in front of the public.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: A much older Xiao Long\u00a0Nu?Song Qingshu endured every punch and kick that hit his body, calmly holding the vegetables as usual and drinking wine. Although he could hardly take a mouthful of the food under his opponent\u2019s fist, he even managed to deliver a glass of wine to his mouth in a relatively smooth manner.\u201cGood man!\u201d A boy who was about seven or eight years old stood up at a table not far away, he turned his head and spoke to a beautiful woman wrapped in snow-white fur, \u201cMother, I want to save him.\u201dThis group of paltry ruffians were also tired from the fight. The main point was that Song Qingshu already looked like a dead person. He was not that responsive. At that moment, he heard someone coming up and stopped, then found that it was a seven or eight year old boy. He burst into laughter and waited to see. After clearly seeing the face of the woman next to the boy, his lust suddenly rose.The ruffian leader opened his mouth and harassed, \u201cOh, if it isn\u2019t a beautiful little lady, if you come and have a drink with this uncle, then uncle will not mind your baby boy.\u201d\u201cImpudent, how dare you insult my mother!\u201d The boy was immediately furious, he grabbed the bench beside him, and threw it over.The leader of the ruffian didn\u2019t expect that the boy would make a move. He was smashed by the bench due to his moment of carelessness, and called out to his brothers in a furious manner, \u201cBeat that boy to death, don\u2019t touch that little lady.\u201d\u201cBe careful!\u201d Song Qingshu was beaten with a bruised nose and swollen face. He didn\u2019t know what was going on there. He only saw that a few angry men rushed towards a child.Watching these people rushing toward him, the boy was not flustered. He took action and brought down a ruffian, and then stood in the middle, letting everyone surround him, and fought against them, many to one. They exchanged several blows but none could take advantage of him.\u201cHuh?\u201d Song Qingshu took a closer look and saw that the boy had an unusually close fighting range, he raised his hand and kicked with his foot, and he couldn\u2019t hit longer than that. But his techniques were so precise that he never showed any flaws on his body, so these few ruffians could not land an attack at all.Song Qingshu discovered that this boy\u2019s mastery was mainly defensive, and he had the essence of Taiji Gong, and he wondered if he was related to Wudang. Considering his identity as an abandoned Wudang apprentice, he planned to leave first, so as not to have an embarrassing conversation.However, he noticed that although the boy was quite decent in his movements, but after all, he was young and too weak in strength, and he gradually fell into a disadvantage.As a result, he didn\u2019t have the composure to end the fight. Those few ruffians saw that they couldn\u2019t defeat a child after so long, and their faces were a little bit awkward as well. One of them made a ruthless move, drawing a knife, he slashed at the boy.\u201cBe careful!\u201d Song Qingshu was shocked, he grabbed a bench, and rushed over. If the kid died while saving him, he might feel guilty for a lifetime.The woman wrapped in white fur also made a move and a white ribbon flew out, entangled the boy in a circle, and pulled him back out of the encirclement.Seeing that Song Qingshu was now trapped instead, she hesitated, then lightly stepped on the table next to her, and flew over. Others only saw a flash of white light, and the woman rushed into the encirclement. Song Qingshu suddenly felt light on his feet, and he was sent to the boy\u2019s side by a wave of tender touch.Song Qingshu hurriedly looked up and saw that the white silk ribbon in the woman\u2019s hand was like a white dragon, circling and dancing vertically and horizontally, and what followed was the screams of several men. In no time at all, the few ruffian\u2019s weapons were all captured by the woman with the silk ribbon, and all of them fell downstairs.Song Qingshu was stunned and stared at everything in front of him. He didn\u2019t expect this delicate-looking woman to be such a powerful martial artist. Then he began thinking in his heart, a woman in white, who uses white silk ribbon as a weapon, wasn\u2019t that Xiao Long Nu?Looking at the boy who was so arrogant and fierce, Song Qingshu felt a little uncomfortable. Originally, he was full of sweet dreams about Xiao Long Nu, but he didn\u2019t expect her son to be so old.The woman nodded politely to Song Qingshu, and then took the boy\u2019s hand and walked downstairs. Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but gulp a little.The boy turned his head and made a grimace at him, then shrugged his shoulders with a helpless expression. This amused Song Qingshu quite a bit.After hesitating, Song Qingshu decided to catch up. Xiao Long Nu can be said to be the dream lover of all men. So what if she has a baby now, Song Qingshu does not want to miss the great opportunity to meet her.\u201cMiss Long, wait\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu chased while panting all the way.Hearing him obviously calling herself, the woman stopped, and turned her wonderful back: \u201cDid the young hero mistake me for another person? I don\u2019t know any Miss Long.\u201d\u201cWhy do you call my mother a \u2018Miss\u2019?\u201d The boy with the attitude stared at him angrily.Song Qingshu was taken aback, wasn\u2019t she Xiao Long Nu?But he quickly apologized, \u201cI saw the lady\u2019s outfit and weapons, which are very similar to someone in my impression. I hope that the lady will forgive me. I am Song Qingshu, I want to thank the lady for her life-saving grace.\u201dThe little boy interrupted at this moment and said: \u201cObviously I saved you. You didn\u2019t thank me, but thanked my mother. It must be that seeing my mother\u2019s beauty has caused bad thoughts in your heart. Just now I thought you were a decent guy, now it seems to be just a mediocre person.\u201dHis words made both adults very embarrassed. The white-clothed woman glared at her son, \u201cFei\u2019er, don\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d After speaking, she cast an apologetic look at Song Qingshu, \u201cThis kid is not sensible, don\u2019t mind my son. \u201cListening to the woman calling him Fei\u2019er, Song Qingshu\u2019s mind flashed, and he blurted out, \u201cCould it be that you are Mrs. Hu?\u201dThe woman glanced at him warily, \u201cI don\u2019t seem to have seen this young hero before.\u201dSong Qingshu was very excited. He squatted down and grabbed the boy\u2019s shoulders and asked, \u201cAre you the Flying Fox of Snowy Mountain Hu Fei?\u201dThe boy looked at him in surprise, \u201cI\u2019m Hu Fei, but not the Flying Fox of Snowy Mountain. Hey, this name seems quite prestigious. I will use it as a nickname in the future!\u201dMrs. Hu quietly pulled Hu Fei over, and asked in a deep voice, \u201cI wonder why the young hero recognizes us, mother and son?\u201d\u201cI respected the heroes and righteous people ever since I was a child, and under my deliberate attention, I have a deep understanding of some things in the Jianghu\u201d Song Qingshu arrogantly proclaimed, then suddenly frowned, he looked at the crystalline beauty in front of him, hesitatingly asked, \u201cBut from what I heard. In that year, when Master Hu unfortunately died, Madam Hu also died in the name of love\u2026\u201dMadam Hu smiled slightly and glanced at Hu Fei dotingly, \u201cBack then, I was indeed going to follow Big Brother Hu, but when I drew the sword, Fei\u2019er burst into tears. I suddenly thought that although Master Miao is a gentleman, it is hard to guarantee what will happen in the future. A villain was also making trouble, so I decided to raise Brother Hu\u2019s only blood.\u201dSong Qingshu didn\u2019t expect that the plot had changed. It seemed that the butterfly effect of his world travel was beginning to appear. When he was suffering from gains and losses, Hu Fei excitedly pulled his sleeves and looked at him expectantly: \u201cDo you know my dad? \u201cSong Qingshu came back to his senses, heard his question, and looked at the sky with fascination, \u201cIf he makes a stab, it is a stab to end the evil. He was a great hero and a hero that this Song has always admired. It is a pity that his life was fated to end short.\u201dSeeing him admiring her husband, Mrs. Hu couldn\u2019t help but relax a little, as if recalling the days when she was still traveling with her husband, a sweet smile appeared on the corner of her lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Brother-in-law and\u00a0Sister-in-lawHu Fei was also very happy to hear that Song Qingshu admired his father so much, but when he saw his mother\u2019s smile, his eyes rolled, \u201cWho knows if you deliberately said those kind words about my father after seeing us, lone mother and son.\u201d\u201cNever!\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s expression was solemn, and his tone of voice was natural, \u201cNowadays, the title of \u2018hero\u2019 seems to be littered on the streets. But there are only a handful of people in the whole of Jianghu, who can truly be called a hero.\u201d\u201cOh, are there so many heroes in the world? Can I know who are these handfuls of people to have this honor?\u201d Mrs. Hu was also interested in this, so she asked while changing to her cold expression from before.\u201cGuo Jing, who guards Xiangyang, serves the country and the people, and a hero deserving the name.\u201d Song Qingshu then thought in his heart, but unfortunately, Gou Jing\u2019s energy was all spent on national affairs, and he was somewhat neglectful of duty to his family.\u201cMaster Guo is indeed a once-in-a-generation hero.\u201d The mother and son nodded one after another.\u201cAnother one would be,\u201d Song Qingshu deliberately sold out Guanzi and said, \u201cIt is Wu Liuqi, the beggar in the snow, who if once received the favor of others, will never forget it. He is also an extraordinary person.\u201d As for the reason why. Half of it was because Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t tell whether Wu Liuqi of this world was the Wu Liuqi in Jin Yong\u2019s writing or the Wu Liuqi from history.\u201cAlthough I have never heard of this person, it\u2019s as you have said, he is indeed a hero.\u201d Madam Hu usually admired this kind of heroic person the most, and her eyes couldn\u2019t help but show a slight twinkle.\u201cIs there another one?\u201d The child couldn\u2019t wait to hear more. So, when Song Qingshu didn\u2019t continue speaking, Hu Fei asked quickly.Song Qingshu didn\u2019t speak clearly. Instead, he recited a poem,\u201cThere is a hero in Liaodong,The hero wields a sword.His martial arts known in the world,and his heroic spirit reaching the sky.With loyalty, as much as heaven and earth,and full tenderness is in his heart.It arouses the envy of scholars,and respect of the millions.\u201d(Goblinslate: Translating a poem is never easy, but I tried)Mrs. Hu\u2019s beautiful eyes expressed her joy. She looked at Song Qingshu deeply, \u201cThis one is thankful to the young hero for offering a poem to my husband.\u201d Now she really felt relieved about the matter of whether the other party was really familiar with and admired\u00a0 Hu Yidao\u2019s life or not. If he was deceiving them, it would be impossible to make such an appropriate poem. With just a few lines, Madam Hu seemed to hear her husband\u2019s heroic laughter again, and she couldn\u2019t help but feel sore in her heart.Now Song Qingshu looked more and more pleasing to Hu Fei\u2019s eyes. Hearing his poems full of fateful regrets, Hu Fei\u2019s heart burst with pride. He pulled on Song Qingshu\u2019s sleeves and solemnly said: \u201cI admired your self-respect in the restaurant just now. Although you don\u2019t even have the power to hit a chicken, but there is an iron will in your bone. If father saw you, he would want to be your friend. But alas it\u2019s too late for that. After feeling the regret in your tone, I am willing to form a friendship with you on behalf of my father. I wonder if you are willing?\u201dMadam Hu was shocked and quickly tried to cover her son\u2019s mouth: \u201cFei\u2019er, don\u2019t go fooling around!\u201dSure enough, he\u2019s the Flying Fox of Snowy Mountain. He\u2019s already so arrogant and solemn since childhood. Song Qingshu smiled heartily: \u201cSure enough, as expected of the son of Master Hu! I am more than willing.\u201d After speaking, he pulled up Hu Fei and knelt down towards the northeast. He even grabbed a bundle of yellow grass as a joss stick.\u201cI am Song Qingshu from the Song Dynasty, I admire the character of Hu Yidao from Liaodong, and I am willing to form the pact of the sworn brothers with him. Heaven and earth as witness, a friendship as great as mountains and rivers, and the emperor of heaven and earth will know my heart.\u201dHu Fei also knelt down, solemnly spoke, \u201cI, Hu Fei, the son of Hu Yidao hereby proclaim that from this day onwards my father and Song Qingshu are sworn, as brothers. And well\u2026 they both will live and die together from now on\u2026\u201d Hu Fei was still young after all, and couldn\u2019t think of anything to say for a while. Taking an oath is not an easy matter, it\u2019s not like what you hear in the drama, where they just open their mouth and it comes out.\u201cYou naughty boy, your dad\u2026\u201d Madam Hu couldn\u2019t hold him back a while ago, and now that she saw that his oath was really inappropriate, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little embarrassed.\u201cSister-in-law, don\u2019t get in the way. This younger brother of the past died long ago, and now I just want to live a new life.\u201d Song Qingshu didn\u2019t lie, the real Song Qingshu was indeed dead.Seeing him suddenly call her sister-in-law, Madam Hu\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but jump a little, and she spoke in an unnatural tone, \u201cFei\u2019er is too foolish.\u201d\u201cI really admire that he has such a heroic spirit from childhood. If it hadn\u2019t been for the elder brother, I would worship him as a sworn brother instead.\u201d Song Qingshu said with a smile, \u201cFei\u2019er, we\u2019ll talk about the things among similar generation privately.\u201dHu Fei used his father\u2019s name to worship him as a sworn brother on a whim. And now, out of thin air, he was suddenly a younger generation. Hu Fei felt depressed. But he was overjoyed when he heard what Song Qingshu said later, and he stepped forward and shouted, \u201cGood brother!\u201dSeeing a big man and one small boy playing around like that, Madam Hu also closed her eyes in pain and had to change the subject: \u201cBrother\u2026Brother-in-law, I see that you seem to be short of breath. With your young physique, this shouldn\u2019t be the case. .\u201dSong Qingshu was a little dazed by her \u2018Brother-in-law\u2019 shout, and quickly replied: \u201cSister-in-law is observant. I was severely injured before, and now my meridians are all broken\u2026\u201dMrs. Hu was startled when she heard the words: \u201cCan brother-in-law let me check his pulse?\u201d Seeing that he had already bowed to her husband as a brother, she didn\u2019t care so much about the difference between men and women.Although he knew that it wouldn\u2019t help, Song Qingshu politely reached out his hand. When Madam Hu\u2019s soft and white fingers touched his wrist, Song Qingshu only felt a smooth and icy touch, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a tremor in his heart.\u201cWho gave such a cruel blow to brother-in-law?\u201d Not long after, Madam Hu\u2019s face changed drastically.Song Qingshu reluctantly retracted his arm, and smiled bitterly: \u201cI committed a big mistake before, so I deserved it, and sister-in-law doesn\u2019t need to take it to heart.\u201d\u201cYou know it clearly.\u201d Seeing Song Qingshu\u2019s open-mindedness, Madam Hu glanced at him in surprise. Then her eyes lit up as if she had suddenly thought of something, \u201cBy the way, we are going to visit the King of Venoms. He is also adept at healing people. Maybe he can heal brother-in-law\u2019s injury.\u201d\u201cWhat a coincidence, I also came to Dongting Lake to find him.\u201d Song Qingshu sighed thinking that it was really fate.\u201cIf brother-in-law doesn\u2019t dislike it, we can travel on the road together.\u201d Madam Hu said softly.\u201cI dare not refuse!\u201d Song Qingshu was overjoyed. How could he dislike it? But, realizing that he was a little too much happy, and he quickly added, \u201cI wonder if sister-in-law knows where the King of Venoms is at now?\u201d\u201cUs mother and son have been searching for him for many years. We only found out a few months ago that he was in the Dongting Lake basin area, but the exact location is still unknown.\u201d Madam Hu raised her pair of delicate eyebrows and helplessly said.\u201cI know that he is in the White Horse Temple near Dongting Lake, but where exactly is this White Horse Temple, I have asked many people but no one knew.\u201d Song Qingshu was also troubled.\u201cMother, when we were passing by a small town a month ago, wasn\u2019t there a place called White Horse Temple?\u201d Little Hu Fei suddenly exclaimed.Her many years of doubts were about to be answered. Madam Hu couldn\u2019t help but smile a bit. Song Qingshu also let out a long sigh of relief and ran to the lake to freshen up. After wiping off the bloodstains from all the kicking on his face, Madam Hu looked at him in surprise. \u2018Very handsome\u2019, she thought to herself, \u2018Brother-in-law is such a handsome man, but I did not expect that his heart would be as arrogant as my elder brother as well.\u2019\u201cSister-in-law, why are you two looking for the King of Venoms?\u201d Song Qingshu wiped the water on his head, looked at Madam Hu, and asked.\u201cAt that time, Brother Hu died of poisoning. I later found out that the poison in him was the secret medicine of the King of Venoms, the \u201cBlack Evil Cold Ice\u201d. However, we never had any direct enmity with him, and so there is no reason for me to harm him. I just want to meet him. It\u2019s very likely that medicine was taken away by others, so I want to ask him in person to find out who else has this highly toxic substance.\u201d Recalling her husband, Madam Hu\u2019s pretty face could not conceal the sadness in her heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: Clear as ice and\u00a0jadeSong Qingshu knew that Tian Guinong was the main culprit behind that tragedy, but when he saw this beautiful sister-in-law, he was moved in his heart and subconsciously wanted to stay with her for a while, so he decided not to tell her the truth.The three came to the vicinity of the White Horse Temple and saw a thin Scholar sitting on the side of the road with leisure. Madam Hu went ahead and asked, \u201cHello, how can I get to King of Venoms?\u201dAs soon as the scholar looked up, his eyes lit up, and he praised: \u201cWhat a beautiful little lady!\u201dLittle Hu Fei couldn\u2019t stand other men looking at his mother like this the most. He squinted at his mother, and angrily said, \u201cYou are a scholar, yet you\u2019re so frivolous!\u201dWhen the Scholar saw Hu Fei, he snorted, \u201cYou have strong bones and your martial art is also not bad, you are a good specimen to try that medicine.\u201d After saying that, he reached out and grabbed at Hu Fei.Hu Fei had a good foundation in martial arts and he stretched out his hand to block him using the Spring Silkworm Palm. But it was useless before the Scholar\u2019s grasp and he was immediately restrained.\u201cFei\u2019er!\u201d Madam Hu was shocked, and a piece of white silk swiftly flew over.\u201cHuh?\u201d Seeing that the white silk was quick, precise, and its angle also really tricky, the Scholer quickly stretched out his finger and cleverly tapped a few inches from the front of the silk.When Madam Hu saw this, her expression changed, her wrist shook, and the white silk made a big circle, creating a big hole on the ground behind the scholar.The scholar grabbed Hu Fei\u2019s shoulders, sealed his acupuncture points, and his footsteps began to speed up. Song Qingshu only saw a blur, and the scholar jumped out of Madame Hu\u2019s ribbon attack circle.\u201cYour Excellency, why do you know my martial arts techniques?\u201d Madam Hu looked at the Scholar before her.\u201cThe Silver Bell and Golden Lock of the Ancient Tomb Sect specializes in hitting the enemy\u2019s acupuncture points. It really deserves its name, but it\u2019s a pity that your opponent is me.\u201d The Scholar touched his mustache and smiled triumphantly.\u201cSister-in-law is from the Ancient Tomb Sect?\u201d Song Qingshu was shocked. He glanced at Madam Hu who was the definition of ice and snow. He then thought in his heart that her appearance and temperament did meet the criteria for accepting disciples of the Ancient Tomb Sect. Wait a moment\u2026since when did the Ancient Tomb Sect have another disciple?Madam Hu looked more solemn, \u201cThere are very few people in the world who know about the Ancient Tomb Sect, and your Excellency actually knows the method to counter the martial arts of the Ancient Tomb Sect?\u201dBut the Scholar shook his head, \u201cI only know some bit and pieces about the most profound martial arts of your sect, the \u2018Jade Maiden Heart Manual\u2019 and the sword technique \u2018Jade Maiden Swordplay\u2019. It wouldn\u2019t be so easy to counter otherwise.\u201d\u201cLooking at your demeanor, you must be a master, why are you bullying a child?\u201d Song Qingshu said after watching all this.The scholar took a look at Song Qingshu, and a lewd smile appeared at the corner of his lips, \u201cWonderful\u2026wonderful! A pretty widow who is as beautiful as a fairy, traveling with a handsome young man. A man,\u00a0 a widow, and they are alone. Where there is dry wood, there will be burning fire, really wonderful! Ah\u2026\u201d\u201cImpudent!\u201d Madam Hu\u2019s pretty face flushed red, and she scolded him before attacking.\u201cBe careful!\u201d Song Qingshu saw through the Scholar\u2019s intentions at a glance. He clearly did that in order to make Madam Hu angry and expose her flaws.Sure enough, Madam Hu only fought him more than ten strokes, and she suddenly screamed, she was hit with a palm strike on her chest. She quickly backed away, and the corners of her mouth were already soaked with blood.The scholar did not chase, just squeezed his palm and sniffed deeply after bringing it to his nose, saying with a look of fascination, \u201cIt feels really good, and it smells even better~\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Madame Hu was so angry that she planned to attack again, but she couldn\u2019t help but frown because of the wound.\u201cSister-in-law, don\u2019t fall for his cunning methods.\u201d Song Qingshu hurriedly went to support her, only to smell a sweet fragrance, even if the current situation was dire, this was unavoidable.\u201cHehe, you are lucky today. If I met such a beautiful little widow twenty years ago, hehe, I would have enjoyed first and then killed you, but now I have a big event planned in my mind, so let\u2019s just use your son for that first!\u201d After speaking, he grabbed Hu Fei, and with a flash, he disappeared in the distance.Little Hu Fei\u2019s scared voice was heard from afar, \u201cYou are a pervert, and you actually like men. If you dare to defile me, I will bite my tongue and kill myself\u2026\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s expression turned black, and Madam Hu was seething with extreme anger. It affected her chest injury and she suddenly fainted.Song Qingshu was shocked when he saw this, and he worried that the scholar would change his mind and return, so he quickly picked up Madam Hu and left the place.Madam Hu was tall, but he did not expect her body to be as soft as boneless, she seemed to have no weight at all. Song Qingshu smelled the faint scent of her body along the way, and sometimes unintentionally touched her skin, only feeling a piece of snowy and tenderness. What a sin! He suddenly thought that he had already bowed to Hu Yidao as a brother, and secretly despised himself, calmed his mind, and looked for a refuge everywhere.Finally seeing an abandoned dilapidated house, Song Qingshu spread a thick layer of hay on the ground before gently putting Madam Hu on it.\u201cUrghh~\u201d Madam Hu snorted with a painful expression, probably due to the wound.Song Qingshu didn\u2019t know exactly where she was injured or how serious the injury was. He wanted to check for her. But, when he reached out and saw Madam Hu\u2019s icy jade-like visage, with a holy aura on her face. He didn\u2019t dare to offend.Song Qingshu vigorously slapped himself, checking her injury was just an excuse. She was clearly injured on her chest, and he just wanted to find a fair and honest reason to take advantage of her.But then he thought about it again, \u2018As a transmigrator, why do I need to follow the etiquette of this world? Haven\u2019t I seen the body of a woman in my previous life? What\u2019s wrong if I take a look now\u2026\u2019When Song Qingshu was struggling, Madam Hu quietly woke up, and when she woke up to see only Song Qingshu, she quickly asked, \u201cWhere is Fei\u2019er?\u201d\u201cThat Scholar took him away. I saw that sister-in-law was seriously injured, so I had to find a place to heal you.\u201d Song Qingshu was a little embarrassed, because he was obviously afraid that the scholar would return. At that moment, he suddenly felt a little annoyed about why he was such useless now. No, he was totally a burden.\u201cI\u2019m going to save Fei\u2019er!\u201d Madam Hu struggled to get up, cried out in pain, and sat down again.\u201cSister-in-law, how is your injury? It was not convenient for me to probe just now.\u201d Song Qingshu supported her with his arms, and felt that the place where he touched was as warm as nephrite jade.Madam Hu blushed, and calmly left his embrace, she frowned and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid my ribs may be broken.\u201d\u201cSister-in-law, let\u2019s heal your injury first, and then save Fei\u2019er, otherwise it will be useless to catch up with him now.\u201d Song Qingshu helped Madam Hu to sit down.\u201cNo, let\u2019s chase the scholar directly.\u201d Madam Hu flushed and shook her head. Apparently, she was thinking in her heart that this place was far away from the locality, and she also didn\u2019t know how much time will be lost once again. Besides, as all the doctors in this era were all generally men, how can she let a man touch her\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: The ribs are\u00a0belowThis kind of drama was seen a lot in TV dramas. Seeing the twisted expression on her face, Song Qingshu immediately understood it, but he pretended to not know, \u201cIs sister-in-law worried about delaying for too long? I have been ill for a long time, and I also know how to fix broken bones. If my sister-in-law has no revulsion, I can help you fix the broken bone, and then we can go after the Scholar.\u201d\u201cHow can we do that!\u201d Madam Hu cried out, with her pretty face suddenly turning beet red, \u201cYou and I\u2026there is a decorum between men and women, it is not convenient\u2026\u201d\u201cNow Fei\u2019er is in danger, but because my meridians are crippled now, I can\u2019t rescue him by myself. So I can only rely on my sister-in-law. Humans should have a sense of courtesy and gratitude, and I can only return the help you\u2019ve given me this way. If my help can make my sister-in-law regain her strength. Brother Hu in heaven, definitely won\u2019t blame you.\u201d Song Qingshu sternly said.Madam Hu suddenly looked a little weird when she saw him being so righteous. She thought that Big Brother Hu was a hero of Wulin. Of course, he wouldn\u2019t mind such a situation, but she, on the other hand, was a woman. It was normal for her to be very concerned.\u201cThat Scholar just now seemed to say he wants to use Fei\u2019er to test a medicine\u2026\u201d Seeing that she was still hesitating, Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but add another wood to the fire.Madam Hu\u2019s heart jumped, and finally, her maternal instincts overcame the shyness of being a woman, and she bit her silver-white teeth, \u201cBrother\u2026brother-in-law, please promise me that after we are done, you will completely forget what happened today.\u201d\u201cThat is natural,\u201d Song Qingshu said with a straight look, \u201cSister-in-law, I will cover my eyes with a cloth strip later, and I won\u2019t see anything that I shouldn\u2019t see.\u201dMadam Hu finally let out a sigh of relief and weakly nodded, \u201cAll right then.\u201dAn imperceptible smile appeared at the corner of Song Qingshu\u2019s mouth. He tore off a piece of cloth and blindfolded his eyes. When Madam Hu saw this, she began to shyly untie her clothes one by one.Hearing the sound of the falling clothes in his ears, Song Qingshu tried to imagine the beautiful scenery in front of him, but it was a pity that he could not see, and he also did not dare to tear off the cloth strip on his eyes.\u201cBrother-in-law\u2026 it\u2019s alright now\u2026\u201d Madam Hu said timidly.\u201cSister-in-law, bear with me.\u201d Song Qingshu reached out and tried to touch.\u201cAh! What are you doing, the ribs are below that\u2026\u201d Madam Hu felt bitter, and feeling insulted tears almost flowed out from her eyes.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Song Qingshu hastily apologized, but in his heart, he recalled the delicate and elastic feeling of touch that came from the palm of his hand just now. He had to try this trick now that he got the chance.Just now he proposed to cover his eyes with cloth strips. It looked gentlemanly. But in fact, Song Qingshu had already made some plans. If his eyes could not see, then even if he touched something that shouldn\u2019t be touched, his sister-in-law could not blame himIt felt really good, and the touch from his fingers made Song Qingshu\u2019s heart shake, but he didn\u2019t dare to go too far, and finally successfully connected Madam Hu\u2019s ribs.After she put on her clothes, Song Qingshu tore off the cloth strips, and he saw a pretty face dripping with red in front of his eyes. Madam Hu pretended to be calm and said, \u201cLet\u2019s set off quickly, we must save Fei\u2019er.\u201dSong Qingshu smiled contentedly, \u201cSister-in-law, that Scholar mentioned testing some sort of medicine just now, so it must have something to do with the King of Venoms.\u201dMadam Hu\u2019s tightened her fists, and she said with a worried expression on her face, \u201cEven I was injured in the fight just now and was at a disadvantage, that Scholar\u2019s martial arts are indeed superior to me. Now I have to go look for the King of Venoms. I am afraid it will be too late to catch up. I won\u2019t be able to save Feier.\u201d The more she talked, the sadder she became, and almost burst into tears.\u201cSister-in-law, I was just about to say, although I am now seriously injured and have no strength to hit a chicken, but I can teach you a martial arts technique. After learning, you should not be weaker than that Scholar.\u201d When Song Qingshu saw her feeling sad, he felt a little distressed for no reason.\u201cBrother-in-law knows martial arts?\u201d Madam Hu glanced at Song Qingshu in surprise. Seeing his fragile appearance, she always thought he was just a scholar.\u201cI used to know a little bit,\u201d Song Qingshu nodded slightly, not wanting to explain more about this issue.\u201cSister-in-law, what I have here is called the White Python Whip Technique\u2026\u201dMadam Hu\u2019s face lit up, and the more she listened, the more she felt that this set of whip techniques was magical. In addition, she originally used long silk ribbons as weapons, and after comparing the two techniques, she had a glimpse of comprehending the White Python Whip Technique after a short time.\u201cBrother-in-law, your whip technique is so exquisite, it must be one of the most excellent martial arts in the Wulin. Receiving this kind of gift, sister-in-law cannot thank you enough.\u201d Madam Hu\u2019s confidence in rescuing Hu Fei had now increased a bit, and she looked at him gratefully.\u201cSister-in-law, my eldest brother and I are righteous brothers, and his son is my son. As long as we can save Fei\u2019er, a mere martial arts technique can be regarded as nothing.\u201d Song Qingshu righteously spoke, \u201cIf sister-in-law really wants to thank me, you can help me practice this technique together later.\u201dMadam Hu\u2019s ears blushed, but she didn\u2019t understand the deeper meaning in the second half of his sentence. She secretly said to herself, \u2018Brother-in-law is good at everything, but he doesn\u2019t pay attention to his words. What is with this \u201celdest brother\u2019s son is his son\u201d, then according to that logic won\u2019t I\u2026as his eldest brother\u2019s wife will be his wife?\u201dCompared to aimlessly looking for the Scholar, Song Qingshu discussed with Madam Hu and decided to find King of Venoms first. After all, after listening to the circumstances, it seemed that he had a strong connection with the King of Venoms, and they may be able to find him if they could find the King of Venoms.After riding for more than ten miles, they came to a place where no grass grew. Madam Hu looked solemn, but Song Qingshu was overjoyed: \u201cSister-in-law, the King of Venoms must be nearby.\u201dMadam Hu nodded, jumped off the horse, and tied the horse to a tree by the road. \u201cWhen we arrive at King of Venom\u2019s place, there will be danger everywhere, so why let these two horses be killed in vain?\u201dSong Qingshu laughed and said, \u201cSister-in-law not only looks as beautiful as a fairy maiden, but also has such a compassionate heart. She is simply the reincarnation of Guanyin.\u201dMadam Hu gave him charming a look, and said, \u201cBrother-in-law is making fun of me again~\u201dSong Qingshu was accustomed to her cold appearance, and her sudden tenderness made him almost lose his soul.Noticing Song Qingshu\u2019s look, Madam Hu\u2019s neck turned a little red. She took out a silk scarf, tied it on her face, covering her mouth and nose, and then gave Song Qingshu a piece, \u201cBrother-in-law, this place is full of poisons, so cover your nose and mouth carefully.\u201dSong Qingshu caught the silk scarf, put it on his nose, and smelled it. An elegant fragrance made him feel relaxed and happy, but he didn\u2019t tie it to his face like Madame Hu, but smiled slightly, \u201cThe King of Venoms is an old monster, and this is his home. If you can prevent his poison by just blocking your nose and mouth, then his nickname will be worthless.\u201dSeeing that Song Qingshu didn\u2019t cover his face, and also didn\u2019t return the silk scarf to her. Instead, he squeezed it into his arms after smelling it. Although Madam Hu felt humiliated in her heart, it was not appropriate to retaliate now.\u201cUnexpectedly, you are quite knowledgeable, not as useless as you look.\u201d A little girl who was passing by at this time stopped and stared at him.Song Qingshu observed that this little girl was very skinny, her hair was thin and yellow, but her eyes were extremely bright. He suddenly had a clue in his heart, \u201cWe have come to visit Old Master for something, and I hope that little girl can give us some advice.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: Promise me a\u00a0condition\u201cHuh?\u201d The little girl glanced at Song Qingshu in surprise, \u201cThe world only knows the King of Venoms, and very few people know about Master Wu\u2019ao. You have such deep knowledge at such a young age, not bad, not bad\u2026\u201dSeeing her pretending to be old, Song Qingshu suppressed his smile, \u201cI think the experience of this junior is not as good as the lady, so I need to ask the lady for advice.\u201dThe little girl\u2019s eyes turned slits, and she smiled sweetly, \u201cAlthough I know you are flattering, it still made me happy. Well, if you want to meet the King of Venoms, follow me.\u201dSong Qingshu was overjoyed, and hurriedly pulled Madam Hu\u2019s hands to follow. Madam Hu tried to retract her hand in a hurry, but she couldn\u2019t, and felt angry and anxious in her heart, \u201cI don\u2019t know if my brother-in-law did it on purpose\u2026\u201d\u201cThis one below is Song Qingshu, and this is my sister-in-law, Madam Hu. May I know the lady\u2019s name?\u201d Song Qingshu knowingly asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know that way of polite greetings, but my surname is Cheng, and my name is Lingsu.\u201d The little girl quickly said, apparently a little embarrassed.\u201c\u2018Lingshu\u2019\u2026 and \u2018Cheng\u2019, is it possible that the young lady is the disciple of the King of Venoms?\u201d Song Qingshu asked, pretending to be surprised.\u201cYou are dishonest. You obviously guessed it from the beginning, but you are now just pretending to be surprised.\u201d Cheng Lingsu coldly snorted.Song Qingshu smiled wryly. He didn\u2019t expect that, although Cheng Lingsu was still so young, but, her mind was so sharp.\u201cHere.\u201d Cheng Lingsu threw over two blue flowers. \u201cBlood Chestnuts are planted all around the house. They are extremely poisonous. This blue flower happens to be its nemesis.\u201dWhen the two hurriedly pinned the blue flowers to their chests, Cheng Lingsu spoke again, \u201cWait a moment, my master is busy dealing with a tough opponent. After you enter the house, don\u2019t talk or ask anything no matter what you see.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s natural.\u201d Madam Hu said softly.Cheng Lingsu glanced at her in surprise, then looked down at her own shriveled chest, her mouth pouted, and became a little irritated for no reason. Song Qingshu looked aside and laughed a little, thinking that Cheng Lingsu was actually feeling jealous of her future mother-in-law.\u201cMaster, I\u2019m back.\u201d Cheng Lingsu put down the medicine basket and bounced through the door.\u201cFei\u2019er!\u201d Madam Hu looked at the hall and suddenly became excited. Hu Fei stared at the two with opened eyes and he was sitting in the middle of the hall like a statue. Beside him was the Scholar. Sitting before them was a Monk with a white beard and hair.\u201cHehe, you guys found this place unscathed,\u201d the Scholar glanced at the two of them, as if a little surprised, and saw Madam Hu\u2019s anxious expression, \u201cI advise you not to move, your son is already poisoned, even if you want to save him. You can\u2019t.\u201dMadam Hu\u2019s body shook as if it was struck by thunder. She was about to rush up to fight him. But, Cheng Lingsu quickly grabbed her, \u201cAuntie, they are comparing drugs, and this little brother will be fine in a while.\u201dHaving been living in the Wulin for so many years, Madam Hu knew that when two poison masters compared their poison skills, one poisoned, while the other detoxified, and then change the order until a winner was determined.Thinking that Hu Fei was going to suffer so much, Madam Hu suddenly felt desperate, but she didn\u2019t dare to rush forward to cause trouble. If the poison in Hu Fei\u2019s body was not cured, then he would definitely die.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my master will not harm this little brother.\u201d Cheng Lingsu quickly comforted her.\u201cMaster, this is the personal disciple you accepted\u2026 she looks really ugly.\u201d The scholar paused for a moment, but his words made Cheng Lingsu a bit angry.\u201cI think you old man should give me the Poison God-King Chapter.\u201d The scholar threatened impatiently, \u201cYour martial arts skills are no longer my match. Is there any need for bloodshed between a master and apprentice?\u201dThe white-haired old monk smiled slightly and faintly said, \u201cSince when did the King of Venoms rely on martial arts to protect himself?\u201dThe Scholar\u2019s face changed slightly. This obviously hurt his ego a lot, and he coldly snorted, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be proud. I have come to challenge you once a year during the past few years. Although you have been able to detoxify my poisons before, but this time I don\u2019t think you can cure the poison.\u201dSeeing that the King of Venoms was carefully examining Hu Fei\u2019s body, the Scholar smiled, \u201cMaster, you see how nice I am to you. I originally planned to use the poison on your beloved disciple, but I was worried that Master, you would not be able to cure the poison. Then junior sister would lose her life, and you would be so furious that you will refuse to give it to me, so I deliberately found an irrelevant child.\u201dMadam Hu felt cold in her heart, thinking that after Fei\u2019er was fine, she would chase him to the ends of the world.\u201cIt\u2019s a really treacherous poison. What you have used on this child is the \u2018Seven Insects and Seven Flowers Ointment.\u2019\u201d The King of Venoms frowned, and upon seeing that Madam Hu and Song Qingshu\u2019s hearts trembled.\u201cIn the past, I looked for some rare poisons, but those have never proved difficult for you. This time I changed my strategy. This poison is not difficult to solve. The key is to know which seven insects and which seven flowers have been used. Hey, if I don\u2019t tell you, and when you try them out one by one, this child will have been poisoned to death. I think you should hand in \u201cPoison God-King Chapter\u201d earlier so that you can save this child\u2019s life.\u201d He seemed very proud, with thousands of combinations, no one could solve this poison in a short time.The King of Venoms hesitated for a moment, then he took out two things and fed them to Hu Fei. The Scholar\u2019s pupils shrank and exclaimed, \u201cCrane Innards and Peacock Gallbladder!\u201dMadam Hu was also taken aback. These two were highly toxic. Seeing the two things entering her son\u2019s throat, she was about to step forward but was caught by Song Qingshu. He shook his head, \u201cI believe in the King of Venoms.\u201dThe King of Venoms quickly put dozens of needles on Hu Fei, and finally heaved a sigh of relief. The Scholer\u2019s face turned ugly, \u201cUsing poison to fight poison, I didn\u2019t expect you to detoxify by conventional methods. Well, I accept defeat, but I don\u2019t understand why you used two kinds of poison instead of one kind of poison.\u201dThe King of Venoms smiled slightly, \u201cIt is possible to achieve a balance between the two toxins in this little child\u2019s body. Although it is possible in theory, it is too risky in practice. If it deviates slightly, he will die. But the three poisons check and balance each other. It is for control.\u201dThe Scholar suddenly realized something, he let out a cold snort and disappeared into the distance. His voice came from far away: \u201cI will come back to challenge you again next year.\u201dMadam Hu cried with joy and hurriedly ran over to Hu Fei, giving him a hug. Then she repeatedly thanked the King of Venoms.\u201cDon\u2019t thank me too early,\u201d the King of Venoms frowned, \u201cAlthough I temporarily used two other highly toxic substances to suppress the toxicity of the seven insects and seven flowers ointment in his body, this balance is destined to wane over time. If it is broken and is not treated, I am afraid he will not survive more than three years.\u201d\u201cI hope that the old master will help us.\u201d Song Qingshu also went forward and asked.\u201cYou two\u2026you usually look smart and clever. Why are you so stupid now? Since my master said so, he will definitely be saved.\u201d Cheng Lingsu flashed out from behind the King of Venoms, revealing a pair of bright black eyes.The King of Venoms looked at her with a smile and said, \u201cIt may take three to five years to deal with the poison on his body. It takes so much effort from me, so you must promise me one condition.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: Don\u2019t bully my\u00a0mother\u201cWhat are the conditions?\u201d Madam Hu asked anxiously, thinking in her heart that she could agree to any conditions for her son.\u201cI want him to worship me as a teacher.\u201d The King of Venoms pointed at Hu Fei, but he sighed in his heart. He was getting old, If he only relied on Lingsu in the future, he was afraid that he would not be able to control that rebel.Madam Hu and Song Qingshu looked at each other, and secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Unexpectedly, it was such a simple condition, but Hu Fei suddenly said, \u201cBefore I become your apprentice, there is one thing that must be figured out.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d The King of Venoms glanced at him in surprise.\u201cIs the Black Evil Ice, King of Venom\u2019s creation?\u201d Hu Fei asked softly, word by word.\u201cYes, it is something I refined in my early years, but since it is too insidious, I have never used it.\u201d The King of Venoms thought for a while and gave the answer.\u201cThen why did my father die from the Black Evil Ice?\u201d Hu Fei asked angrily. Madam Hu had mixed feelings in her heart, and she didn\u2019t want him to be the murderer. If that were to happen then Hu Fei\u2019s life\u2026The Poisonous Pill King showed regret, \u201cI did not consider the moral character in choosing my disciples in my early years, as a result, my first three disciples all betrayed their master. The one just now was my very first disciple Murong Jingyue. I gave him a copy of the refinement method.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d As soon as Mrs. Hu heard that, she clenched her teeth, she thought that this mysterious case finally had a clue, \u201cFei\u2019er, follow the King of Venoms to learn his skills, and then add your father\u2019s family martial arts. Don\u2019t be afraid. Mother will first go and look for Murong Jingyue to track down the real murderer, and we will take revenge together in the future.\u201dHu Fei nodded vigorously. Seeing her as if she was about to rush, Song Qingshu quickly said, \u201cSister-in-law, you are recovering from a serious injury, and the other party is strong in martial arts and is also good at poisoning. I can also help if I go with you.\u201dRecently, Madam Hu has always been a little uncomfortable with Song Qingshu, always feeling that he seems to have other thoughts in his eyes. However, the other party did help them, mother and son, a lot. He was Brother Hu\u2019s brother. She couldn\u2019t refuse directly. Suddenly, she thought of a way to justly refusing his company without hurting his face.\u201cSenior Venom King, my brother-in-law was badly injured before and his meridians were severed. We thought that only the King of Venoms could heal his body in the world. He traveled through thousands of mountains and rivers looking for Senior, and he hoped that Senior would help him.\u201d Madam Hu leaned slightly and pushed Song Qingshu to the King of Venoms.\u201cUh, the disciple of the Butterfly Valley\u2019s Medical Immortal Hu Qingniu\u2019s true inheritor once diagnosed this junior, and he couldn\u2019t do anything. After thinking about it, I am afraid that only Senior Venom King can heal my injuries under the heavens.\u201d Song Qingshu felt really uneasy at the moment, if the King of Venoms is also helpless, he was afraid that he was destined to be a useless person for the rest of his life.\u201cThis old man has always admired the medical skills of the Ming Cults Master Zhang.\u201d Commented the King of Venoms as he probed Song Qingshu\u2019s pulse, and then looked around on his body, later he shook his head slightly, \u201cThis young mans\u2019 meridians are completely broken, it is no longer something I can save.\u201dMadam Hu\u2019s face changed, and she looked at Song Qingshu with some worry. But Song Qingshu smiled frankly, \u201cBefore, I was worried about my injuries because I still had illusions. Now that Senior Venom King cleared my doubts, I don\u2019t need to worry anymore. A true man can live with honor between heaven and earth and he doesn\u2019t need martial arts for that.\u201cThis young hero has a good mindset!\u201d The King of Venoms praised, \u201cBut you do not need to be desperate. Although it is impossible to renew the meridians with medical skills, have the young hero considered practicing internal techniques to heal himself?\u201dSong Qingshu glanced at him suspiciously, \u201cMy meridians are crippled, I can\u2019t practice even if all the top internal techniques in the world are placed in front of me.\u201d He still remembered the best martial arts in the world, the Nine Yang Divine Art and Dragon Claw Hand, but with his broken meridians, there was no way to practice.The King of Venoms fell into deep thought and slowly said, \u201cAlthough there are many martial arts today, most of them are for ordinary people. However, the Sunflower Treasures of Heimuya, the Dou Zhuan Xingyi of the Murong family, and the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters of the South China Sea. Maybe some old people have records of these martial arts.\u00a0 These martial arts have surpassed the scope of being just strictly martial arts, and have become closer to the ancient cultivation methods, and you may be able to find a way to heal your meridians from them.\u201d\u201cThis junior has also heard of these martial arts, but didn\u2019t know that they have such magical powers? Dare I ask the senior how you know about this\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu subconsciously didn\u2019t believe it.\u201cI feel ashamed to speak of it\u201d the King of Venoms smiled bitterly. \u201cOld man\u2019s rebel apprentice Murong Jingyue is a descendant of the Murong family. Because of his identity, he is not qualified to practice Dou Zhuan Xingyi. He tried his best to learn martial arts from various schools and coveted it. The reason he wants this old man\u2019s \u201cMedicine God-king Chapter\u201d is to one day be able to take charge of Yanziwu, take charge of the Murong family, and get a glimpse of the mystery in the Dou Zhuan Xingyi. In our early years, he inadvertently complained to me that the ancestor Kunlun Sword Fairy Murong Ziying relied on the Dou Zhuan Xingyi to move even the stars. In Murong Fu\u2019s generation, he can\u2019t even win against Qiao Feng. He also kept\u00a0 criticizing Murong Fu for his poor aptitude.\u201d\u201cOh~ Is it so wonderful?\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s heart moved.The King of Venoms then said to Madam Hu, \u201cMurong Jingyue\u2019s martial arts is very high, coupled with his mysterious whereabouts, it may not be easy for Madam to find him. The old man suggests that Madam should accompany young hero Song to Gusu Yanziwu, so that you can ask the Murong family for some clues. Secondly, you can see if there is a chance to treat young hero Song\u2019s meridians.\u201dSong Qingshu was so excited that he almost wanted to kiss the King of Venoms. He really was the reincarnation of a saint!Madam Hu thought for a moment and nodded, \u201cOkay, I will go to Yanziwu with my brother-in-law.\u201dDuring the next few days, Madam Hu waited until Hu Fei\u2019s body stabilized before preparing to set off. In these few days, Hu Fei and Cheng Lingsu, the two children, were like a pair of happy friends. One scolded each other as ugly and stupid. Hu Fei couldn\u2019t bear it. He wanted to give her a beating, but was poisoned by Cheng Lingsu\u2019s red scorpion powder.Madam Hu sat on the stool and looked at all this with a smile, her heart full of warmth, Song Qingshu leaned over and teased, \u201cYour expression seems as if you are looking at your daughter-in-law.\u201d\u201cStop the nonsense!\u201d Madam Hu gave him a blank look. The two were now more and more familiar with each other, and their interactions were becoming more and more natural.\u201cIt seems that you dislike girls who look ugly.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled.\u201cBah!\u201d Madam Hu hissed inwardly, \u201cLingsu doesn\u2019t look very good, but her whole person is full of pure aura. She is charming, and full of energy\u2026\u201d She said while looking at his face. She didn\u2019t want to say it aloud, but she would be quite satisfied if Cheng Lingsu really became her daughter-in-law.On the next day, the two bid farewell to the King of Venoms. Before parting, Hu Fei held Song Qingshu back, and said with a weird tone, \u201cBig Brother Song, take care of my mother, but you must not have any bad ideas, or bully her.\u201dSong Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but laugh when he heard it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: One\u00a0room\u201cWhat is brother-in-law laughing about?\u201d Madam Hu gave him a strange look.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Song Qingshu didn\u2019t have the guts to tell her. After the topic changed, he asked, \u201cSister-in-law, when you fought against Murong Jingyue before. I think I heard that you seem to belong to the Ancient Tomb Sect?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s correct\u201d Madam Hu nodded slightly, \u201cI met my master by chance when I was young. She lived in my house for more than half a year and taught me a lot of things.\u201d\u201cDoes sister-in-law knows what her name is? Is it Lin Chaoying?\u201d Song Qingshu hurriedly asked.Madam Hu shook her head, secretly wondering why her brother-in-law knew so much about the Ancient Tomb Sect, \u201cLin Chaoying is my grandmaster. I don\u2019t know what my master\u2019s name is.\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s expression suddenly became really strange, and he wanted to know that if Xiao Longnu and Li Mochou knew that they had such a senior sister. If they didn\u2019t know, then how they would react?The two of them traveled all the way to Gusu City. Seeing that it was getting late, they decided to rest in a small town outside the city and go to Yanziwu the next morning.\u201cBoss, two rooms.\u201d Hearing Song Qingshu\u2019s call, the innkeeper looked up at the two of them and made a smile, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, there is only one room left here now. How about you two share that room? \u201cMadam Hu frowned and shook her head, \u201cNo, let\u2019s go to another inn.\u201d\u201cYoung Lady, we have only one inn in this town. Now the gate of Gusu City is closed, and other inns are only available in neighboring towns a hundred miles away.\u201d said one of the innkeeper\u2019s employees.\u201cLet\u2019s go look for another inn.\u201d Song Qingshu felt that the innkeeper\u2019s words were inaccurate, and he suddenly felt that all this was a little bit suspicious.\u201cForget it, we\u2019ll stay here.\u201d Madam Hu said absentmindedly.\u201cXiao Er, send this lady up first.\u201d The innkeeper grabbed Song Qingshu and said quietly, \u201cYoung Master, please stay for a while, let me tell you something important.\u201dSeeing that Madam Hu had disappeared in the corridor, the innkeeper spread his hands and smiled, \u201cYoung Master, the room will cost you ten taels of silver, thank you.\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s eyes went wide, \u201cYou are robbing my money, it is clearly written here that one room is one or two silver.\u201dThe shopkeeper did not get angry, and gave a sly smile, \u201cYoung Master, do you really think that we have only one room in such a big inn? Didn\u2019t you see that I noticed you two were traveling alone on the road together and am trying to help you create opportunities? As for if you can grasp it? It entirely depends on your own ability.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d Song Qingshu was shocked immediately.\u201cHey\u2026\u201d the innkeeper smiled strangely, \u201cOtherwise why do you think that so many inns in the world say there is only one room left when it comes to lone men and women? This is our rule, Young Master. You will be able to make more money if you don\u2019t have money, but beautiful women will be hard to find again.\u201dSong Qingshu started to admire the man, and readily handed over a dozen silver coins, \u201cThe person who came up with this marketing strategy is really a genius!\u201d\u201cWhat did the innkeeper say to you just now?\u201d Madam Hu asked suspiciously when Song Qingshu returned to the room.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, just settling the money for the room.\u201d Song Qingshu replied casually, \u201cSister-in-law, you sleep on the bed, I will sleep on the floor.\u201d\u201cYour meridians are damaged, the ground is too cold, how can you sleep on the floor?\u201d Madam Hu frowned, feeling embarrassed, there was just one bed in the room.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m a man, I will be able to endure this much.\u201d Song Qingshu wanted to sleep on the bed but he knew that it was impossible. So he had to bite the bullet and lay a cushion on the ground and soon fell asleep.Madam Hu stared at him for a while, turned around silently, and layed down on the bed in usual her clothes.In the middle of the night, Madam Hu was suddenly awakened by some whistling sounds. She opened her eyes and saw that Song Qingshu was lying on the ground and his body shrunken, trembling; his arms were bruised, and he was clutching the quilt.Madam Hu knew that people who had been injured before would have sore and painful wounds. What\u2019s more, Song Qingshu\u2019s meridians all over his body were severed. Seeing that he was in so much pain, but he still bit his lip and didn\u2019t want to make a sound. Madam Hu thought with emotion, \u2018My brother-in-law is indeed a decent gentleman.\u2019Song Qingshu really hurts because of the intrusion of the cold on the ground, but there was a trace of stubbornness in his heart.Who cared about what Madam Hu thought? He just wanted to bear it silently like a man.\u201cBrother-in-law, come to bed and sleep.\u201d Madam Hu\u2019s soft voice came from the bed.Song Qingshu stared at her blankly, \u201cHow can that be! Sister-in-law, leave me alone, I can stand it.\u201d\u201cHow are you going to travel tomorrow like this?\u201d Madam Hu calmed down her nerves and spoke with a slightly angry tone, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, I am not afraid as a woman, then what are you afraid of? As long as we are not guilty in our hearts, won\u2019t it be fine?\u201dAlthough Song Qingshu was arrogant, he was not a fool.Trembling all the way, Song Qingshu got into the bed. A sweet fragrance entered his nose, and his body felt warm again. After a while, even the pain in his body was gone.When Madam Hu saw him entering straight into the quilt she had just slept in, her pretty face flushed, and after hesitating for a moment, she spoke with a mosquito-like voice, \u201cBrother-in-law, you are sleeping in my quilt.\u201dSong Qingshu was embarrassed to find that his quilt was still on the ground. He quickly realized that Madam Hu letting him sleep on the same bed was already the greatest gift for him. How could she also agree to sleep in the same quilt as him?With an embarrassed smile, when Song Qingshu ran down to take the quilt back. Madam Hu was already wrapped in her quilt, and she fell asleep with her back facing him. Song Qingshu slowly layed down beside her, touching her body several times in the process. Madam Hu\u2019s body just trembled slightly.Unlike Zhou Zhiruo who betrayed him, Madam Hu was as clear and clean as a White Lotus, and she was also very good to him. So, Song Qingshu did not dare to cause any trouble and use those nasty methods to take advantage of her.Smelling the faint fragrance coming from the beautiful woman\u2019s hair, Song Qingshu\u2019s spirit slowly relaxed. All the painful feelings in his body gradually calmed down, and it didn\u2019t take long for him to fall asleep.Song Qingshu woke up the next day. He touched the spot beside him and found the beautiful woman was no longer there. He quickly sat up in surprise, only to see Madam Hu looking at him with a smile.\u201cGood morning, sister-in-law.\u201d Song Qingshu awkwardly smiled.Madam Hu nodded gently. When she noticed the movement he had made just now, she was secretly annoyed. This guy put his hand on her body and touched it many times last night. If she hadn\u2019t used her true energy to detect that it was just an unconscious behavior after falling asleep, she would have left a long time ago.Seeing Madam Hu\u2019s angry eyes, Song Qingshu felt guilty. He lowered his head and recalled the beautiful dream he had seen last night. In the dream, Madam Hu was naked and lying shyly under him.Early in the morning, the two went looking for Yanziwu. Song Qingshu knew that Shenhe District was probably dozens of miles west of Gusu City, and he took Madam Hu to search for it, but unfortunately, they never found the place even after asking dozens of people. Madam Hu was doubtful in her heart, thinking they had gone in the wrong direction, but Song Qingshu confidently stated that he was right.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: The girl in green\u00a0clothes\u201cBrother-in-law seems to be aware of various secrets from many martial arts\u2026\u201d Madam Hu gave him a suspicious look.Song Qingshu smiled slightly, \u201cThere has been a time when I had a nickname called \u2018Jianghu\u2019s All-knowing\u2019. Well\u2026that part was a joke, don\u2019t take it seriously.\u201d\u201cOh, since this young master knows about everything in the world, do you know who this young lady is?\u201d Her voice was extremely sweet and clear, and it created an indescribably comfortable feeling in Song Qingshu and Madam Hu\u2019s hearts. They both were shocked and turned to look back. The owner of the voice was a girl in a green dress, about sixteen or seventeen years old, with slender hands and skin like jade, her face was gentle and her body was delicate.Song Qingshu thought that although her appearance was not as clean and beautiful as Madam Hu, she still looked very moving with her aura of gentleness. When he saw her green dress, a thought flashed in his mind, \u201cWhat if I can tell you your name?\u201dThe girl in green dress pursed her lips. She shook her head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m right, I won\u2019t ask for anything else. I just need you to take us to Yanzi Wu.\u201d Noticing that the girl in green was still expressionless, Song Qingshu became more assured in his heart. \u201cThis Song has long heard that Gusu has two fairy maidens. One is called Azhu, who is as beautiful as the clouds, and with the grace of the south of the Yangtze River. Then there is young lady Abi, you are as gentle as water, which is really rare in the world.\u201dAbi was a little embarrassed by his praise, and shyly said, \u201cYou would not be saying that if you met Miss Wang before.\u201dSong Qingshu only smiled and said nothing. Abi looked up and asked, \u201cMay I know what plans the young master has after going to Yanzi Wu?\u201d\u201cMy sister-in-law and I absolutely mean no harm, and we just want to ask something important to Master Murong. So, I hope young lady Abi will help us.\u201d Hearing Song Qingshu\u2019s introduction, Madam Hu also nodded slightly.Seeing the handsome young man and the beautiful lady, Abi subconsciously did not regard them as bad people, and smiled sweetly, \u201cThe Master happened to be at home today. Come with me.\u201dMadam Hu secretly smiled in her heart. Brother-in-law, this person is very handsome, but he has a clever mouth that can really please girls. This little girl was really inexperienced in the ways of the world.Abi untied the rope on the side and invited the two to come on the boat. Madam Hu\u2019s smile abruptly stopped. She grew up in the lands of ice and snow and didn\u2019t have the slightest experience with water. She felt an inexplicable sense of fear when she saw the lake.\u201cSister-in-law, be careful.\u201d Seeing her shaking a little, Song Qingshu quickly helped her to get on the boat. Along the way, Madam Hu\u2019s forehead was sweaty, and her heart was upset and sick, and she didn\u2019t even realize that Song Qingshu had been holding her in his arms.Instead, it was Abi who glanced at the two strangely, thinking that young master Song clearly called her sister-in-law, then why are they now hugging each other like a couple. But her cautious nature as a maid made her suppress the doubts in her heart.After landing, Madam Hu realized that she was too close to Song Qingshu, and quickly broke free from his arms, and directly flew to the shore. Song Qingshu gave a wry smile and disembarked with Abi.\u201cI will tell Master Murong about the arrival of young master Song and Madam Hu.\u201d After Abi went in, Murong Fu entered and greeted the two in the hall.\u201cYou are the young hero Song who is related to the leaders of the two schools of Wudang and Emei? And Madam Hu\u2026 Is it the widow of the Liaodong hero Hu Yidao?\u201d Murong Fu was quite handsome. He looked at the two guests for a moment, and asked in surprise.\u201cAs expected of someone from the Murong household, your knowledge is as vast as the world and knew our backgrounds just from a glance.\u201d Song Qingshu and Madam Hu looked at each other, thinking that the fame of the Murong family of Gugu was quite well deserved.\u201cMay I know the reason behind the two of you visiting today, what can I help you with?\u201d Murong Fu was a person devoted to his great cause of restoring the country. He was very enthusiastic about making friends when he met people from around the world.\u201cIt\u2019s like this\u2026\u201d Madam Hu began speaking and told him about Murong Jingyue.\u201cMurong Jingyue?\u201d Murong Fu was shocked. He had never heard of this collateral relative of his before. \u201cI have to check our family records carefully to see if I can find something.\u201dBut, what he thought in his mind was that there are very few members in the Murong family line. Now maybe there was an extra helper.Seeing his joy, Song Qingshu roughly guessed what he was thinking, and quickly said, \u201cMaster Murong, please forgive me for being too blunt. This Murong Jingyue does not seem to be under you in terms of martial arts . Moreover, he has many auxiliary skills and is also good at poisoning. If he suddenly wanted to have the ownership of the family, and has many descendants, you might not be able to accommodate his direct line when the time comes.\u201dMurong Fu felt a little disapproving in his heart, thinking that if Murong Jingyue\u2019s martial arts really were higher than him, then he would have killed him a long time ago. How could he still run around learning various martial arts in the world\u2026Wait, was it possible that he didn\u2019t do anything, because he feared his father? Thinking about this possibility, Murong Fu\u2019s face gradually became dignified.\u201cWe can help Young Master Murong regarding this matter, after all, Murong Jingyue is probably the murderer who poisoned my husband back then.\u201d Madam Hu offered her help. She came to seek help from the Murong family, but she didn\u2019t want to just sit back and do nothing.\u201cMadan Hu, please relax\u2026\u201d Murong Fu motioned her to sit. \u201cI am grateful to the two of you for telling me such an important news. How dare I bother you to take action. If our Murong family can\u2019t clean up our own mess, what would the people of the world think? They would surely laugh at us. Madam Hu, don\u2019t worry, after we capture Murong Jingyue, we will definitely invite Madam to come over.\u201dUnderstanding that his words were reasonable, Madam Hu didn\u2019t know what to say for a while. It was indeed a taboo in the Wulin to intervene in other people\u2019s internal affairs, but she couldn\u2019t relax if she just let him go.\u201cIf Madam Hu doesn\u2019t dislike it, you can stay in Yanzi Wu for a while. As soon as we find Murong Jingyue, Madam can investigate what happened to Master Hu back then. How about it?\u201d Murong Fu carefully asked, but he had other thoughts in his heart. There was a rumor in the Wulin a year ago that Hu Yidao was guarding a big treasure. He didn\u2019t know if it was true or false. But, now that his wife is here, he has to find a chance to investigate.Madam Hu was obviously a little moved, but she was worried about her being a widow, and living here was a bit unpleasant.After taking a look at Song Qingshu next to her, she suddenly had an idea, and smiled at Murong Fu, \u201cThank you, Master Murong, for your kindness. But, I will have to decline your offer. It\u2019s just that when we came here to visit this time, there was also another request. My brother-in-law was severely injured and his meridians all over his body were severed. After receiving the advice of the Senior Venom King, we heard that the Dou Zhuan Xing Yi belonging to Gusu\u2019s Murong family is extremely mysterious. We were hoping it could treat my brother-in-laws damaged meridians.\u201dMurong Fu subconsciously frowned. Dou Zhuan Xing Yi was the foundation of the Murong family, how could it be given away to outsiders? However, he was worried about Hu Yidao\u2019s treasure. If he could get the treasure and use it to recruit troops. He might be able to accomplish something that many generations of ancestors could not accomplish. His heart suddenly became a little hot.\u201cYoung hero Song, can you let me check your pulse?\u201d Murong Fu motioned as he looked at Song Qingshu.Song Qingshu reached out his hands with a little anxiety in his heart. Although he sympathized with Murong Fu, he had always disdained his ability, and it was really unreliable to put his own destiny in his hands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: The internal art that can repair\u00a0meridiansSure enough, Murong Fu frowned and said, \u201cYoung hero Song\u2019s meridian has really been\u2026greatly damaged.Did Venom King, that old man, really say that Dou Zhuan Xing Yi can heal young hero Song? Maybe it is because of my dull aptitude, but I have been practicing Dou Zhuan Xing Yi for twenty years, and I didn\u2019t know that Dou Zhuan Xing Yi has the effect of reviving the meridians.\u201dSong Qingshu immediately felt disappointed, and Madam Hu couldn\u2019t bear to see it. So, she couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cSince Master. Murong can\u2019t help us, then I will have to accompany my brother-in-law to search for other places, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t stay here.\u201d\u201cMy sister-in-law, it doesn\u2019t have to be like this. Since this last hope is broken, my desire to be healed is also completely dead. If my sister-in-law wants to investigate Murong Jingyue, then it is more convenient for you to stay here.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s tone was full of sadness and dismay. He could not find treatment even after coming to Yanzi Wu. He had to leave here and survive with his injuries.Although he could live a stable life with Madam Hu, when he thought about Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s sword of execution hanging over his head, he still had to accumulate a little bit of strength before she arrived at his door.Now that there was no hope of learning martial arts, it seems that there was no other way than to enter the court. Song Qingshu\u2019s mind quickly began to work. Out of all the forces in the present world, which one will he defect to\u2026Seeing that Madam Hu was about to go with Song Qingshu, Murong Fu felt anxious, and suddenly thought of a way, and quickly said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I just thought of a way to treat young hero Song\u2019s meridians.\u201dSong Qingshu gave him a fleeting look. To tell the truth, during this period of time, the matter of treating his meridians was from hope to disappointment, to hope, and then despair. He gradually began to feel that the ups and downs of life were really exciting, and now he thought that everything was possible. His feelings had become numb about all the different treatment methods.\u201cI really hope that Master Murong will give us some advice.\u201d Madam Hu, on the other hand, was obviously much more enthusiastic than him.\u201cI have a cousin who knows about all the martial arts from all over the world,\u201d Murong Fu\u2019s eyes flashed with tenderness, but it was quickly replaced by determination. \u201cA few years ago, when I was discussing the internal arts of various factions with her, she seemed to mention an internal art. It has the effect of healing wounds and mending bones, and it must be able to heal young hero Song\u2019s injury\u2026\u201d\u201cWang Yuyan?\u201d Song Qingshu suddenly became interested. Why did he forget that there was still a beautiful girl martial arts master who did not know the slightest bit of martial arts? If it really was something that she said, there might be real hope. So he suddenly asked a little excitedly, \u201cMaster Murong, do you know what kind of internal art it is?\u201dMurongfu\u2019s expression suddenly became a little embarrassed \u201cI forgot\u2026\u201dIt turned out that when Murong Fu heard of this martial art, he didn\u2019t believe it in his heart and sneered at it. So how could he remember its name carefully? This time, if it weren\u2019t for being reminded by Song Qingshu\u2019s symptoms, and his desire to keep Madam Hu, he had to desperately seek out a treatment. And so, he suddenly remembered this particular information.Seeing the strange expressions of the two sitting before him, Murong Fu quickly added, \u201cBut my cousin must remember.\u201d\u201cIs Master Murong\u2019s cousin currently in the house?\u201d Madam Hu looked more nervous than Song Qingshu at the moment.\u201cMy cousin\u2026she is in Manduo Mountain Villa, a little bit away from here. But it\u2019s too late to go there today, why not stay here for the night, and tomorrow we will go to see my cousin together.\u201d In his heart, Murong Fu kept thinking about how to make Madam Hu stay at this place.\u201cYou have my sincerest gratitude.\u201d Madam Hu couldn\u2019t urge too much, so she said a few words to thank him.\u201cAbi, go inside and prepare a drink. Where\u2019s Azhu?\u201d Murong Fu turned around and ordered.\u201cSister Azhu heard that the Master was coming, and she had already gone to the kitchen to prepare wine and food.\u201d Abi smiled softly and bowed her head, \u201cThis servant will now go to help sister Azhu.\u201d\u201cMaster Murong is really lucky to have such a beautiful pair of maids.\u201d Song Qingshu sighed heartily.Murong Fu smiled slightly, and did not answer. Madam Hu gave him a blank look, thinking that her brother-in-law did not cover up his words, how could he praise the people belonging to another house like this.Seeing the strange expressions of the two of them, Song Qingshu realized something was wrong. He was a modern person. At that time, it was common to joke about men\u2019s tastes in women. Complimenting people about being beautiful was a common way to deepen relationships. It was, however, not applicable in ancient times.\u201cMaster has distinguished guests here today. It\u2019s a matter of celebration!\u201d A burst of hearty laughter came from outside, and four people in similar attire came in together.\u201cIt turns out that it\u2019s none other than the four masters of Gusu\u2019s Murong Family, I have been quite disrespectful!\u201d Song Qingshu stood up and saluted a few of them, but wondered whether these martial artists were as cowardly as shown in the TV series, or in the books.Seeing that Song Qingshu didn\u2019t call them Murong family guards, the four of them felt good in their hearts, and they began to have hearty conversations.\u201cMaster, the wine and food are ready, you can come to the table.\u201d While Song Qingshu was dealing with these few rowdy men, he suddenly smelled a sweet scent. At that moment, he thought that a modern woman had also transmigrated from his home world. That familiar smell of perfume made him almost burst into tears.He looked back and saw a red-robed, exquisite, petite and pretty girl. Song Qingshu excitedly asked, \u201cDo you know Jin Yong?\u201dThe girl in the red dress was obviously taken aback by this question. She quietly glanced at Murong Fu and then replied, \u201cYoung master, did you mistake me for the wrong person?\u201dSeeing her blank look, Song Qingshu knew that he was thinking too much, and couldn\u2019t help but smile, \u201cThis young lady sprinkled rose perfume on her body?\u201dThe girl in the red dress\u2019 eyes lit up and she looked like she saw a close friend, \u201cYes, yes, does this young master also study flower extracts? This is my homemade rose dew\u2026\u201d\u201cAzhu, stop causing trouble.\u201d Murong Fu gently coughed from the side.Azhu happily poked out her tongue, and hurriedly arranged the dinner table with Abi.Song Qingshu was in a daze. Just how far did the story of Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils develop? It seemed that the main plot hadn\u2019t started yet, so why did Qiao Feng become the Nanyuan King of Liao Kingdom? But thinking about the fact that he could travel here from modern times, those deviations were not so difficult to swallow.After dinner, Azhu and Abi led the two to rest in their respective guest rooms. Azhu was hesitant to talk on the way. So, Song Qingshu amusingly asked, \u201cYoung lady Azhu, do you want to say something?\u201dAzhu rolled her black eyes. She giggled and said, \u201cYoung master is a genuine man, but why is he so familiar with the accessoires of women?\u201d\u201cDo you mean the rose perfume?\u201d Song Qingshu gave a blank laugh. Before all this, he was even familiar with the smell of Chanel and Dior perfumes. It could be said that\u00a0 he knew more than enough to deal with a little girl\u2019s perfume.\u201cHmm~\u201d Azhu kept nodding.\u201cYoung lady Azhu, I think your rose dew is elegant and refined, but the smell doesn\u2019t seem to last long.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s heart moved when he thought of Azhu\u2019s heaven defying abilities, so he suddenly became quite motivated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Surrounded by halo of\u00a0light\u201cYeah,\u201d Azhu pouted, \u201cI tried many ways to make the fragrance last.\u201dSong Qingshu noticed that the skin on her face was soft, smooth and crystal clear, and smelled the sweet smell of her body. She was really a sweet and beautiful girl. He also thought that she was very obedient. He had seen many versions of her in the Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils, and he had always been impressed by the character of Azhu. He didn\u2019t dare to compliment her too much, and he also didn\u2019t expect her to be so sweet and lovely.\u201cYoung master?\u201d Seeing Song Qingshu staring at her in a daze, Azhu\u2019s face became flushing red.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu came back to his senses, and he also felt a little embarrassed, \u201cYoung lady Azhu, I have a way to make your fragrance last longer\u2026\u201d After speaking, he deliberately stopped speaking and looked at her with a smile.Azhu was also a clever girl. Seeing this, she realized that the other party wanted something. She became cautious in her heart, fearing that he would ask something unfavorable to Murong Fu, but on the surface she smiled like a flower, \u201cMay I know what the young master wants from this servant in exchange for this method?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t I plead with Mr. Murong, let him promise to give you to me.\u201d Seeing her charming appearance, Song Qingshu suddenly got bad thoughts and deliberately teased her.\u201cYoung master, don\u2019t joke with me.\u201d Azhu maintained her smile.\u201cHaha, I was just teasing you\u201d Song Qingshu laughed, \u201cI can teach you how to make your fragrance long lasting, but in return you have to teach me how to change appearance.\u201dAzhu made a shocked expression as soon as she heard this condition. Song Qingshu thought she would not agree, and secretly regretted that he was too anxious. He should\u2019ve waited until their relationship became more familiar. But he might have to leave Yanzi Wu tomorrow, so he had no other choice.\u201cOh, it was only that?\u201d Ah Zhu chuckled. \u201cI have liked to pretend to be someone else ever since I was a child. The more I pretended, the more I learned, and gradually I figured out a set of methods. It\u2019s not something that precious or unusual. Since the young master likes it, I\u2019ll teach it to you.\u201dAs she was speaking, Azhu suddenly realised something, and looked at Song Qingshu curiously, \u201cWhy does the young master know that this servant can disguise herself?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Abi tell you that I used to be called the \u2018Wulin\u2019s All-knowing\u2019 in the past, and I know many things regarding many people.\u201d Song Qingshu raised his eyebrows and spoke with an air of mystery.Azhu thought that Abi had indeed quietly talked about this to her before, and gave him a dubious look.\u201cI, as a man, can\u2019t let a young lady suffer\u201d Song Qingshu knew that the people in ancient era put great importance on their promise, so he directly said, \u201cI will teach you the method of fixing your fragrance first.\u201d\u201cYoung master Song, you are such a good person.\u201d Azhu stared at him with a smile.A beautiful girl sent a good person card towards him for no reason. Song Qingshu dejectedly said, \u201cTo make the fragrance of the flower perfume long lasting, you must add a fixative. The fixative can be ambergris, sandalwood, musk, Orris root\u2026whatever is convenient for you. Use of each raw material is different, so the effect on the perfume will also be different\u2026\u201d After speaking, Song Qingshu remembered that when he chased that woman in his previous life, he deliberately supplemented his knowledge of perfume. He didn\u2019t expect it to be so useful now.Azhu\u2019s beautiful eyes showed brilliance, and she looked at Song Qingshu with admiration, \u201cYoung master Song is really knowledgeable and talented, and you even understand these accessories belonging to women.\u201dAs the two of them were speaking, they had arrived before the room, Song Qingshu stopped and asked, \u201cMay I know when Miss Azhu will teach her disguise technique to me?\u201d\u201cHow about tomorrow?\u201d Azhu was a little embarrassed. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late today\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I will leave Yanzi Wu tomorrow\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s meaning was also obvious.Azhu thought that Song Qingshu was quite open minded. He taught her the method first, and she also couldn\u2019t take her own promise lightly. She gritted her teeth and pulled Song Qingshu, then she walked into the room, \u201cYoung master, it\u2019s not convenient to do that outside. It will not be good to be seen by anyone in the family. Now, let\u2019s go into the room and talk quietly.\u201dAs a young maiden entering a man\u2019s room in the middle of the night, Azhu would naturally feel a little uncomfortable. She cautiously sat far away from Song Qingshu, and explained the method of Yi Rong Shu, \u201cThe key to Yi Rong Shu lies in the mask making and the target\u2019s behaviour. The material of the leather mask\u2026\u201dAt first, Azhu was teaching from a distance, but it was impossible to teach disguise technique this way, so she took out a bottle of ointment from her pocket and came closer to demonstrate it on Song Qingshu\u2019s face.Feeling the icy cold feeling of Azhu\u2019s fingers on his face, and then smelling the bursts of sweet scent from her body, he felt that Murong Fu had two such good maids and a cousin who can be called a master of martial arts. But his end result was so miserable.Although he admires Murong Fu\u2019s fighting spirit, he had never been a fan of his IQ. If he were Murong Fu, wouldn\u2019t it be easy to restore the dynasty?The principal wife of one of the princes of Xixia and him were relatives, and due to that he often mingled in Xixia\u2019s high level social circles. Such unique conditions gave him a huge advantage if he participated in the public husband selection event of the Princess of Yinchuan of the Xixia dynasty.Even if he didn\u2019t take the path of Xixia, it would be even better with Wang Yuyan. If he had her, wouldn\u2019t all the martial arts of the Xiaoyao Faction belong to him?Even if he didn\u2019t follow the martial arts route, Murong Fu still had a hidden expert like Azhu at home. To be honest, Song Qingshu thought that Azhu\u2019s art of disguise was really more precious than most top tier martial arts. If it was used well, it could create miracles. How could its effect be comparable to that of a martial artist? If Murong Fu took necessary actions, got the support of a few ministers and eunuchs, and then transformed himself into the appearance of an emperor or a prince. By occupying the magpie\u2019s nest, he could become the emperor without any effort.Seeing Murong Fu\u2019s vivid look in the mirror, Song Qingshu exclaimed, \u201cYoung lady Azhu, you are really amazing.\u201d\u201cThe young master is praising me a little too much.\u201d Azhu bowed, as if she was facing the real Murong Fu.\u201cAzhu, it\u2019s getting quite late, so you can warm the bed for your master.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes turned clever, and with his heart full of naughty thoughts, he ordered while in Murongfu\u2019s appearance.\u201cBah!\u201d Azhu cried out with a blushing face, \u201cSince young master Song has learned almost everything, this servant will now take her leave.\u201d After speaking, she fled and disappeared outside the door.The next day, Murong Fu led the group to Manduo Mountain Villa. At first, Song Qingshu was also looking forward to seeing how beautiful this fairy maiden was. But as he walked, that thought in his heart gradually faded. He had no strength or power now. No matter how beautiful a woman was, it didn\u2019t really matter to him. Even if there was a chance, he couldn\u2019t grab it. His heart slowly became as still as water.\u201cCousin~\u201d A\u00a0 dreamy voice came from far away, and Song Qingshu was startled when he heard it. It\u2019s no wonder that just a mere sigh from Wang Yuyan overwhelmed Duan Yu\u2019s mind.\u201cCousin, you came to see me, I\u2026 I\u2019m so happy.\u201d Wang Yuyan\u2019s white and tender face had a hint of girlish blush, which was really pretty.Song Qingshu now had the opportunity to clearly look at her. What he saw was a young girl in a red-colored gauze dress, and her long hair was gently tied with a silver ribbon. There seemed to be a soft light surrounding her body, and this gave her a dream-like aura.Song Qingshu was shocked. When she saw Zhao Min that day, her whole body seemed to be shrouded in the radiant beauty of the scorching sun. Then, when he first saw Madam Hu, her whole body seemed to be enveloped in a piece of pure jade. This time he witnessed Wang Yuyan, and she also had something surrounding her body. It was similar to a halo of soft light, could this be the aura of a peerless beauty?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: The beautiful Master of Martial\u00a0ArtsAfter looking carefully, Wang Yuyan was truly stunning. But Song Qingshu was after all, not Duan Yu. Due to the blessings of many high resolution cameras in modern society, he had seen many beautiful women, and his immunity was naturally higher.How much more beautiful was Wang Yuyan compared to Azhu or Abi? Song Qingshu shook his head in his heart. They were all beautiful women. Once they reached a certain level, it was not so easy to distinguish between them. It was just like Fan Bingbing and Gao Yuanyuan, can you say who is more beautiful? Some people thought that Miss Fan looked better, and some people thought that Gao Yuanyuan was more of a goddess. It depended on personal taste.There was a reason why people in this world generally thought that Wang Yuyan was more beautiful than Azhu and Abi. It\u2019s not that Wang Yuyan was really better than Azhu or Abi. What made her superior was her dazzling temperament, which made ordinary men feel inferior and dare not keep looking after a glance. And the impression left by that glance would leave a deep mark in their mind. Being influenced by this thought, of course, they would feel that Wang Yuyan was much prettier than Azhu and Abi, who felt more like girls from next door.Song Qingshu, a modern person, was soon able to watch her face with a calm heart after his initial surprise.\u201cCousin, who are these?\u201d Subconsciously noticing Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes staring at her, Wang Yuyan\u2019s long eyelashes trembled slightly. She was a little bit shy in her heart, but she was worried that he was a good friend of her cousin. Therefore, she did not dare to express her emotions.\u201cThese two are my friends,\u201d Murong Fu helped Wang Yuyan walk in. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Let\u2019s talk as we walk.\u201d\u201cThe internal energy for treating damaged meridians?\u201d The crowd sat down in a nearby pavilion. After listening to Murong Fu\u2019s explanation of Song Qingshu\u2019s situation, Wang Yuyan wrinkled her beautiful eyebrows and began to think.\u201cThere are so many kinds of martial arts today. If I had to say, then the best cure for internal injuries would be the Nine Yin Scripture, which was robbed by the Wu Jue of Central Plains in the past,\u201d Wang Yuyan\u2019s words made Song Qingshu\u2019s heart sink. His meridians were completely broken, and it was impossible to circulate any true qi to heal them according to that method. Could it be that Murong Fu was referring to that internal energy\u2026\u201cBut\u2026\u201d The change in Wang Yuyan\u2019s tone almost caused Song Qingshu\u2019s heart to come to his throat, \u201cYoung master Song\u2019s meridians are now damaged, I\u2019m afraid that the Nine Yin Scripture is not suitable for that.\u201dSong Qingshu secretly admired the fact that Wang Yuyan didn\u2019t know the slightest bit of martial arts, but she still knew everything there was to know about almost all the martial arts in the world. Not only that but she had a thorough understanding as well. He couldn\u2019t comprehend how Murong Fu\u2019s mind worked. Every time Wang Yuyan tried to give him advice, he would get angry due to his narrow mindedness.\u201cI wonder if Miss Wang has other ways?\u201d Madam Hu asked softly.Wang Yuyan also marveled at the beauty of this big sister, she nodded slightly, and continued, \u201cI once read the following words in an worn-out ancient book: \u2018The Nine Yin Scripture treats the withering and blockage of the meridian, and the Divine Brilliance Scripture repairs meridians and mends bones.\u2019 As for the actual effect of these two methods, since I have not read the two scriptures, I dare not jump to any conclusions\u2026\u201dSong Qingshu felt his body tremble uncontrollably. At this moment, his heart was really agitated. The Divine Brilliance Scripture could give him a chance at rebirth. He would have the strength of dragons and tigers, and he could even save people who were at death\u2019s door with that scripture\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you, Miss Wang, for your guidance.\u201d Song Qingshu stood up excitedly, and his heart had already flown out on the road, and he wished to go immediately to find the scripture.Seeing Song Qingshu\u2019s excitement, Madam Hu knew that this time they might have found what they were looking for. She looked at Wang Yuyan and asked, \u201cDoes Ms. Wang know where to find the Divine Brilliance Scripture?\u201dWang Yuyan frowned her eyebrows, tilted her head, and thought about it carefully, \u201cIt is rumored that Mei Niansheng, a famous figure in the Central Hunan province, knows this mystical skill. But he has never stayed in one place for long, and I don\u2019t know where to find him.\u201dSong Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but be dazed, wondering whether Mei Niansheng was poisoned by his three disciples by this time. If he was dead, Song Qingshu could only start from Ding Dian and Di Yun.\u201cThis Song will remember the grace of Master Murong and Miss Wang for days to come.\u201d Song Qingshu stood up and thanked them sincerely.\u201cI just read a few words from the book, and I don\u2019t know if it will work.\u201d Wang Yuyan was so passionately thanked by him. It was unavoidable that she felt a little bit shy.\u201cEveryone here belongs to the Wulin, so young hero Song does not have to be so polite.\u201d Murong Fu quickly got up and responded.Song Qingshu secretly sighed, Murong Fu was really an impeccable young talent on the surface. They helped him this time, and he will definitely return the favor in the future\u2026\u201cI plan to go to Central Hunan and find Mei Niansheng. My sister-in-law should stay here for a few more days. It is important to find Murong Jingyue.\u201d Song Qingshu turned to look at Madam Hu while intentionally saying this.\u201cYes, if Madam Hu finds it inconvenient to live in Yanzi Wu, she can live with my cousin. Manduo Villa is full of women, so Madam Hu can rest assured.\u201d Murong Fu also added oil to the fire when he saw the opportunity.Madam Hu embarrassedly glanced at Song Qingshu, thinking that now the world was in turmoil, her brother-in-law had lost all of his martial arts, and he had a rigid temper that was unwilling to bend the knee. She was afraid that he would not be able to safely reach Central Hunan\u2026\u201cMurong Jingyue has the Murong family to track him down, so it\u2019s useless for me to stay here. My brother-in-law has lost all martial arts now, and it\u2019s not peaceful on the road. I still want to accompany my brother-in-law to Central Hunan.\u201d Madam Hu finally made a decision.As soon as this remark came out, the expressions of everyone present turned a bit strange. They were a young man and a widow, alone on the road, there was a good possibility that something might happen between their brother-in-law and sister-in-law.Abi on the side thought back to the intimacy the two people showed on the boat last time, and her thoughts became even more complicated.Madam Hu quickly perceived the weird atmosphere. As soon as she thought about it, she understood what everyone was thinking, and her ears turned a little hot. But there was no way to explain this kind of thing. She thought about the harmonious relationship between herself and her brother-in-law. Then she calmed down.Song Qingshu was now completely racing against time. He didn\u2019t know when Zhou Zhiruo would find him. And once she does, if he was still half-dead before, he was afraid he would be completely doomed then.Although there was a touching fairy maiden here, and there was also the gentle Abi as well as the sweet Azhu, Song Qingshu still decided to set off immediately.Facing his farewell, Wang Yuyan just nodded slightly, her thoughts were all on her cousin. She only looked at Murong Fu\u2019s eyes, full of tenderness and love.This was the end of the matter. Murong Fu knew that if he tried to make them stay again, it might look suspicious, so he had to order Azhu to prepare a package of food and send it to the two of them, \u201cFriends, you have to travel to a place thousands of miles away. I have prepared something for the journey. If you two regard this Murong Fu as a friend, I hope you won\u2019t refuse. I wish for young hero Song\u2019s injury to heal as soon as possible. The door of Yanzi Wu will always stay open for both of you at any time\u2026\u201dSong Qingshu had no reason to refuse, he accepted the package, and thanked him, \u201cYour kind intentions today will be repaid in the future!\u201d\u201cBrother-in-law, don\u2019t you think that Young Master Murong seemed to be a little too much enthusiastic about me?\u201d After leaving the Manduo Villa, Madam Hu stopped to think for a bit, and finally couldn\u2019t help but ask.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: The great oracle Jin\u00a0Yong\u201cA gentleman will always give attention to a fair lady. My sister-in-law has a jade-like figure, it\u2019s not that surprising for Master Murong to be enthusiastic.\u201d Song Qingshu turned his head and laughed.\u201cBrother-in-law~\u201d Madam Hu groaned, her voice was delicate and soft, and it made Song Qingshu\u2019s bones turn soft, \u201cYou are laughing again. I am like Pu Liu, and that Miss Wang is much more beautiful than me, how can Master Murong take a liking to me?\u201d\u201cIn my heart, my sister-in-law is much more beautiful than Miss Wang.\u201d Song Qingshu saw that Madam Hu raised her eyebrows, and was about to launch an attack, so he quickly changed the subject. \u201cIf my guess is not wrong then that Young Master Murong has the plan to acquire the King\u2019s Treasure.\u201d\u201cBrother-in-law also knows about the King\u2019s Treasure?\u201d Madam Hu was surprised. This was the biggest secret in her heart, and she didn\u2019t have the time to care about his previous frivolous words.\u201cMy sister-in-law forgets that I was known to be \u2018All-knowing\u2019. There are really few events in this world that I don\u2019t know about.\u201d Song Qingshu pretended to smile mysteriously.\u201cDoes brother-in-law also have the desire to acquire the King\u2019s Treasure?\u201d Madame Hu felt a little uncomfortable, and for a while, she doubted his true purpose behind approaching her.\u201cOf course!\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s answer made Madam Hu\u2019s heart turn cold, \u201cI can use this treasure to do a lot of things in the future.\u201dNoting that Madam Hu\u2019s face was turning ugly and he knew what she was thinking at the moment. So, Song Qingshu laughed and said, \u201cSister-in-law, don\u2019t worry, the reason we met was purely an act of fate. And I already know where the treasure is, so you don\u2019t have to worry about my motives.\u201d\u201cYou know where the treasure is?\u201d Madam Hu exclaimed, \u201cThat is impossible.\u201dIt was rare to see Madam Hu, who always smiled with a low voice, make such a wonderful expression. Song Qingshu glanced at her face and said with a smile but not a smile, \u201cEveryone said that I am \u2018Wulin\u2019s All-knowing\u2019. Although I am not yet clear about the specific location, I still know about the general direction. I should be able to find it when I get there. Why\u2026 was my sister-in-law planning to kill me?\u201dMadam Hu sighed quietly, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you know so much at such a young age.\u201d\u201cOne day when I was a child, I met a wandering Taoist. He saw that my bones were amazing and my knowledge was extraordinary\u2026 so he couldn\u2019t help but chat with me,\u201d Song Qingshu pretended to be forced, shook his head and continued, \u201che said. I am blessed by God, and he told me many stories so that I can remember them well.\u201dMadam Hu looked as if she obviously didn\u2019t believe him, and asked, \u201cDid he say what his name was?\u201d\u201cHe\u2026 he seemed to be called Jin Yong.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s look became a little weird.\u201cJin Yong?\u201d Madam Hu thought carefully, \u201cI have never heard of this person in the Wulin.\u201d She thought that Song Qingshu didn\u2019t want to tell her the truth, and it would not be appropriate for her to ask too much.\u201cCentral Hunan is so big, where should we go first?\u201d Madam Hu didn\u2019t want to continue talking about the King\u2019s Treasure. She was also getting a headache from why Song Qingshu knew about it, so she had to change the subject and think about other things.\u201cNaturally it is Jingzhou!\u201d Song Qingshu said confidently.With her previous experience, Madam Hu believed Song Qingshu\u2019s judgment from the bottom of her heart, and she didn\u2019t say anything. During the time the two of them travelled all the way to Jingzhou, Song Qingshu was thinking about how to find the Divine Brilliance Scripture.\u201cFirst of all, I must find out how far the plot of \u201cA Deadly Secret\u201d has developed.\u201d Song Qingshu thought about it carefully. The best way to judge was to see if Ding Dian was in jail in Jingzhou, and whether or not he was locked up for several years.When Song Qingshu told Madam Hu about the idea of visiting the Jingzhou prison, Madam Hu looked embarrassed, \u201cBrother-in-law, you probably don\u2019t know. Now Mongolia and Song Dynasty are battling on the front line of Xiangyang. Jingzhou is related to the logistics of Xiangyang City. As the lifeline of a major military town, with no fewer than 100,000 troops stationed nearby. I am afraid that the jail in Jingzhou Mansion is not so easy to break into.\u201dNow it was Song Qingshu\u2019s turn to be stunned. In his impression of the martial arts masters in the novel, let alone a prison cell, they could even come and go freely in the royal palace. Now it seemed that that was not the case at all.\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look, just in case the defense is not as strict as we imagined.\u201d Song Qingshu urged unwillingly.Madam Hu couldn\u2019t refuse him, so she had to promise, \u201cOkay, but brother-in-law has to promise me not to be impulsive at that time. Now that you are not in good health, if something really were to happen, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t protect you.\u201d\u201cI know, I\u2019m not a fool.\u201d Song Qingshu nodded his head like a chicken pecking at rice.The two went all the way to explore the jail in Jingzhou Mansion. While looking at it from a distance, both of their expressions changed. They saw soldiers patrolling everywhere, the prison was guarded extremely tightly.Madam Hu was worried about Song Qingshu\u2019s injury. Hearing that someone there knew the whereabouts of the Divine Brilliance Scripture, she secretly made up her mind. She turned back and said to Song Qingshu, \u201cBrother-in-law stay here for a while, I\u2019ll go check it out.\u201dThe two were very close now, and smelling the faint fragrance coming from the beautiful woman next to him, Song Qingshu felt a little lost in his heart, and he quickly said, \u201cSister-in-law, don\u2019t take risks!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I just want to investigate.\u201d Madam Hu turned her head and smiled charmingly, and in a blink of an eye, she approached the prison like a wisp of smoke.Song Qingshu was a little fascinated by the smile that appeared at that moment, thinking what was wrong with him. He was used to seeing beautiful women, so why could she shake his mind with just a smile?Madam Hu was as light as a swallow, and she slipped through the gap between the patrolling soldiers and approached step by step. And soon, Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t even see her.\u201cThe movement technique of the Ancient Tomb Sect is really extraordinary.\u201d Song Qingshu secretly sighed. Not long after, there was a tearing sound in the air, and Madam Hu had already returned to his side.\u201cHow was it?\u201d Seeing her ugly expression, Song Qingshu knew that it might not be good news.There was a hint of worry on Madam Hu\u2019s beautiful face, \u201cI just checked carefully. It\u2019s possible to bypass the prison\u2019s outer line of defense, but the prison itself is designed to have only one entrance, and the entire cell is hidden underground. I\u2019m afraid it was designed to guard against us the people of Wulin. The entrance is also tightly guarded, it is impossible to get inside unless you rush in.\u201dSong Qingshu knew that it was unrealistic to break into using force. This was the real world. The government here was not as non-existent as in the novel, and Jingzhou Mansion was a major military town. The security here was usually very tight. If something went wrong in the prison, the nearby garrison could rush at any time to provide help. Although Madam Hu\u2019s martial arts was not weak, it was still impossible to try to break into such a big prison and save an individual.But if he doesn\u2019t enter the cell, he won\u2019t be able to know if Ding Dian was there or not. And he also wouldn\u2019t know how far the story of \u201cA Deadly Secret\u201d had developed.\u201cWait, if I just want to know the development of the plot, then I don\u2019t need to start from the prison.\u201d an Idea suddenly flashed in Song Qingshu\u2019s head, he pulled Madam Hu and turned away to leave the place.Madam Hu was annoyed for a moment, thinking about how this brother-in-law of hers always liked to do things. Fortunately, after staying together for such a long period of time, she had long understood that Song Qingshu\u2019s behavior was different from that of ordinary people. He didn\u2019t seem to have any idea about the decorum between men and women. Coupled with several times of suffering, Madam Hu also knew that his actions were only natural. He didn\u2019t hold any evil thoughts, so she just let him hold on to her snow-white wrist and did not attack.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 The embarrassing situation on the\u00a0roofSong Qingshu finally stopped after arriving before a magnificent mansion.\u201cI heard that this Wan family is one of the big families in Jingzhou. What does my brother-in-law want to do here?\u201d Madam Hu calmly withdrew her hand, looked at Song Qingshu and asked.\u201cSister-in-law, we are visiting the Wan family at night today.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes were bright, and he triumphantly thought, as long as he found out whether Qi Fang had become Wan family\u2019s young matriarch, wouldn\u2019t everything be clear?\u201cIt\u2019s not proper to invade someone\u2019s house in the middle of the night.\u201d At the moment, Madam Hu was holding Song Qingshu by his shoulder, and the two of them were lying on the roof of a bedroom, so Madam Hu spoke with some embarrassment.\u201cI have quite an understanding regarding this person surnamed Wan, although his martial arts is nothing to speak of, but he has a stomach full of bad ideas. It will be better for us if they are in the light, and we are in the dark. If we visit them honestly and openly, they will become our enemy in the dark. I will feel much safer if we are the ones that remain in the dark. I feel uncomfortable when I think about being the target of their schemes all the time.\u201d Song Qingshu spoke frankly, while leaning against the beautiful woman, without feeling any pressure. It was unknown if it was intentional or unintentional.Madam Hu stretched out her jade-like finger and gently tapped Song Qingshu\u2019s waist, so that he could no longer move closer, \u201cBe quiet, someone is coming.\u201dSong Qingshu also looked down, and saw a man and a woman walk in. The man was handsome, with a beard on his mouth that gave him a mature atmosphere, and the woman was dressed as a young wife.What a delicate and beautiful little woman! Song Qingshu secretly admired her. In fact, the woman\u2019s figure was voluptuous, and her body may not really be weak, but her feeble and timid temperament made people subconsciously regard her as a weak maiden.This scene answered all his doubts, and Song Qingshu secretly sighed. It seemed that Qi Fang was already married to Wan Gui, and Di Yun was probably suffering with Ding Dian in prison.What happened next made the two on the roof really embarrassed. It turned out that as soon as the young couple returned to the bedroom, Wan Gui began to get busy. He pushed Qi Fang down and they both fell onto the bed.Madam Hu took a deep breath and turned her head. Seeing Song Qingshu eagerly watching the show, she couldn\u2019t help but get angry. She wanted to take Song Qingshu away, but that would surely alarm the two people below them. She fell into a dilemma.Song Qingshu suddenly felt a pain in his waist. Turning around, he saw Madam Hu looking at him with a sullen face. Her lips seemed to warn him, \u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201dSo, he had to reluctantly turn his head.The roof was quiet, and only noise came from the two in the room below them. Madam Hu and Song Qingshu were even more embarrassed when they imagined what was happening in the room. When she thought about the fact that she was listening to the matters between a husband and wife with another man, Madam Hu felt regret in her intestines.Song Qingshu was different. Although he couldn\u2019t watch the live movie below, it was really refreshing to watch the beautiful woman with light anger and blushing cheeks next to him.\u201cWan Zhenshan, get out here!\u201d It was a pity that the Heavens were unwilling to let him enjoy the moment. Suddenly, there was a sound of fierce fighting from outside. Wan Gui and Qi Fang didn\u2019t have the time to be affectionate anymore, so they hurriedly dressed and ran out.Madam Hu secretly sighed in relief, she took the opportunity to grab Song Qingshu and flew out.\u201cWait, let\u2019s see which hero came to find Wan Zhenshan that villain. Maybe he is a potential ally\u2026\u201d Madam Hu couldn\u2019t refuse him, so she had to grab Song Qingshu\u2019s waist, and after a few skips, she landed on a suitable place. They watched the movement of the Wan family from the courtyard wall.The soft and full feeling coming from near his ribs startled Song Qingshu. This, coupled with their experience with the noise from before, made his face turn a little red.Madam Hu did not notice that she was holding Song Qingshu\u2019s waist, which caused him to take advantage of her, and her attention was all on the man wearing tattered clothes in the courtyard.Dozens of people from the Wan family besieged him together, but couldn\u2019t hurt him at all. Instead, they were punched, kicked and thrown all around.Wan Zhenshan could no longer sit still, and drew his sword to attack.\u201cLiancheng Swordplay?\u201d The visitor smiled coldly, grabbed a sword, and countered him with the same moves.\u201cWait a minute!\u201d After fighting for a few rounds, Wan Zhenshan quickly jumped out of the battle circle, \u201cWho is your Excellency, why do you know my master\u2019s sword technique?\u201d He was a little bit embarrassed in his heart. After a few moves, he realized that his opponent\u2019s martial arts was much higher than him. This guy also knew the Liancheng Swordplay, it was very likely that he would lose his life if this continued.\u201cMei Niansheng is my senior, who do you think I am?\u201d The man sneered.\u201cWu Liuqi, the beggar in the snow!\u201d Wan Zhenshan finally remembered that his master had once mentioned that he had a junior brother, and he couldn\u2019t help being shocked. He hurriedly clasped his fist with his hand and said, \u201cThis junior has seen the Martial Uncle. What are you still doing? Get up, this is your Uncle Master.\u201dWu Liuqi frowned. He raised his hand to stop them and said, \u201cNo need, I\u2019m here to investigate the murder of my senior brother. There are rumors that his three apprentices betrayed their teacher, and killed him to obtain a treasure. Yan Daping and Qi Changfa\u2019s whereabouts are unknown. So, I have to start with you first.\u201d\u201cI was framed!\u201d Wan Zhenshan cried out. When he noticed the loopholes in Wu Liuqi\u2019s words just now, he thought he might as well try. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t seen my martial arts just now. Do you really think the three of us have the ability to hurt our Master?\u201d\u201cMy Senior brother\u2019s martial arts was famous around the world and he also practiced that magical scripture. It is indeed unreasonable for him to be hurt in your hands.\u201d Now Wu Liuqi became puzzled as well. He also didn\u2019t know the truth. He just heard that Mei Niansheng died at the hands of his three apprentices, so he came to investigate and find out the truth. Just now he saw that Wan Zhenshan\u2019s martial arts was really poor, and he began to doubt in his heart, \u201cThen how did your master die?\u201dWan Zhenshan became happy in his heart, he looked around, and quickly feigned a look of embarrassment: \u201cUncle Master, this is not the right place to talk. Would you kindly follow me inside the house?\u201dWu Liuqi was a bold man, he was not afraid of his tricks, and nodded.\u201cLet\u2019s follow!\u201d Song Qingshu said subconsciously, and Madam Hu gave him a look, thinking that he really thought of her as a maid, but she still took him around to the back of the house and listened.\u201cThere is no need for tea, come on, tell me how my brother died?\u201d Wu Liuqi impatiently waved his hands.\u201cAh, ah, ah~\u201d Wan Zhenshan sighed three times, and watching how impatient Wu Liuqi was, he quickly said, \u201cI wonder if Uncle Master knows about the Liancheng Swordplay Manual?\u201dWu Liuqi glanced at him vigilantly, \u201cI heard about it from my senior brother. But isn\u2019t it just the sword technique of Liancheng Swordplay? What\u2019s wrong, how is it related with the murder?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Wan Zhenshan slapped his thigh, \u201cI don\u2019t know how the prefect of Jingzhou found out about the treasure hidden in the Liancheng Swordplay Manual. After he was discovered, the Master was killed by him.\u201d He even squeezed out a few drops of turbid tears from the corner of his eyes.\u201cLing Tuisi, the prefect of Jingzhou?\u201d Wu Liuqi was taken aback. He was a powerful figure in the separatist side. But Wu Liuqi didn\u2019t completely believe in Wan Zhenshan\u2019s words. Instead, he asked: \u201cAlthough Ling Tuisi has a lot of soldiers, he can\u2019t face my Senior brother\u2019s martial arts. It\u2019s impossible for him to defeat my Senior brother. So how did he die?\u201d\u201cUncle Master, have you ever heard of the Golden Devil Flower?\u201d Wan Zhenshan looked at Wu Liuqi\u2019s expression cautiously.\u201cGolden Devil Flower, which is known for having no cure?\u201d Wu Liuqi was from the older generation, and he also knew about some rare poisons.\u201cExactly!\u201d Wan Zhenshan faintly sighed, \u201cLing Tuisi invited our Master to a banquet that day. Master was then poisoned by him. He lost 70% to 80% of his martial arts and was finally captured by that villain. However, our master would rather die than surrender. He refused to reveal the secret of Liancheng Swordplay Manual. This made Ling Tuisi so angry that he killed him\u2026\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d Wu Liuqi slapped the table, \u201cHow do you know these things so clearly if you were not on the scene? And if you were on the scene, why did Ling Tuisi let you get away with your life?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: Going\u00a0aloneWan Zhenshan secretly squeezed out a few drops of sweat. This Uncle Master was not that old, not much older than his Gui\u2019er but, his experience in the Wulin was very rich. Luckily, he had already thought out a plan and said, \u201cThe three of us apprentice brothers went with Master at that time. We were at that banquet, but it\u2019s a pity that our martial arts was low and we couldn\u2019t save Master. After Ling Tuisi killed Master, he thought we might know the secret of Liancheng Swordplay Manual, so he kept us alive, and spread rumors to the Wulin that it was the three of us brothers who killed Master. He obtained the Liancheng Swordplay Manual, but the people in the Wulin have been blaming the three of us. He has been hiding behind the scenes waiting to get all the benefits like a fisherman.\u201dWu Liuqi saw that he was sensible and reasonable, and that the people in the Wulin usually found the matter of killing their own teacher very appalling. So he subconsciously somewhat believed in Wan Zhenshan words, and snorted, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about today\u2019s matter. As for the credibility of your words. I will find out after I go to the prefectural office.\u201d After speaking, he stood up and left straight away.Looking at his back, Wan Zhenshan sneered, \u201cJingzhou City has a hundred thousand soldiers. As a prefect, how can Ling Tuisi\u2019s mansion be so easy to enter? You will be able to get in but I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t get out.\u201d\u201cThat person is the great hero Wu Liuqi that brother-in-law mentioned before?\u201d Madam Hu asked curiously.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu secretly thought that Wu Liuqi was obviously fooled by the old fox Wan Zhenshan, but it would not do him any good to divulge this at the moment. He was concerned that Wu Liuqi\u2019s power would be needed to deal with Ling Tuisi.In the early morning of the second day, at a roadside food stall, Madam Hu suddenly said to Song Qingshu, \u201cBrother-in-law, we have been trying to break into the prison to save someone so that we can get information. But, isn\u2019t there an easier way?\u201d\u201cAn easier way?\u201d Song Qingshu felt a flash in his mind, but he couldn\u2019t grasp the specific ideas.\u201cAccording to my brother-in-law, there is a prisoner in the jail who knows about the Divine Brilliance Scripture. Then, all we need is to be able to contact him. Why do we need to rescue him?\u201d Madam Hu smiled lightly.Song Qingshu suddenly became enlightened, and he got the urge to hug and kiss the beautiful woman in front of him,\u00a0 \u201cSister-in-law is really a female Zhuge Liang. Yes, he can\u2019t get out, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t get in!\u201dThe more they thought about it, the more excited they got, constantly improving their plans about entering the prison.At noon that day, a young scholar came in front of the prefect\u2019s mansion, and handed a greeting card for Ling Tuisi. The servant saw that the other party was well-groomed, and under the effect of silver, he turned around and went in to report.Before long, Song Qingshu was greeted inside.\u201cYoung Master Song, why did you want to meet this official in the mansion?\u201d Ling Tuisi glanced at Song Qingshu a little irritably. He couldn\u2019t avoid being irritated. The battle on the front line in Xiangyang was unfavorable. As the principal officer at the rear, he was under a lot of pressure. He was also unwilling to talk about the secret of Liancheng Swordplay Manual.\u201cThe purpose of my visit is to solve a worry in senior\u2019s heart.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled mysteriously.These scholars loved to act this way, and Ling Tuisi immediately felt unhappy. If it hadn\u2019t been for the official document processing today, he would have kicked this person out. Hearing Song Qingshu\u2019s words, Ling Tuisi just gave a faint \u201cOh~\u201d and remained expressionless.\u201cSenior must be thinking that I am just a poor scholar, what can I do to solve his troubles,\u201d Song Qingshu smiled slightly, \u201cIndeed, if it is about the major issue in the country today, I really can do nothing. But if it\u2019s regarding seniors\u2019 personal business\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu suddenly stopped speaking.Ling Tuisi\u2019s heart jumped, and he took a closer look at Song Qingshu, \u201cMay I know what the young scholar is talking about?\u201dSong Qingshu smiled faintly, \u201cI don\u2019t have any other skills, but I am best at prying open the mouths of hard-bone prisoners\u2026\u201dLing Tuisi\u2019s face suddenly turned blue, and he asked with a vicious tone, \u201cHow much do you know about the Liancheng Swordplay Manual?\u201dSong Qingshu was shocked at his outburst, but he pretended to be calm and said, \u201cNothing more, nothing less, there is a way to get the person in the prison to speak, but the information needs to be divided in half.\u201d\u201cYou have a big appetite,\u201d Ling Tuisipi snorted without a smile, \u201cI\u2019m afraid your stomach won\u2019t be able to handle such a thing.\u201d He was surprised in his heart, how could this person know everything so clearly.\u201cI am young, I have a good appetite.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled, \u201cAfter so many years, does Master Ling still feel confident to pry open that person\u2019s mouth?\u201dLing Tuisi thought to himself that after so many years of torture, he hadn\u2019t gotten anything. Ding Dian probably wouldn\u2019t say anything until he died, and he also couldn\u2019t really kill him. Recently, he has become increasingly impatient. In the dead of night, he even came up with an extremely vicious plan, but he was not sure whether it would work. If he failed, Ding Dian\u2019s clue would be broken, so he was still hesitating.\u201cCan you really make him tell the secret of Liancheng Swordplay Manual?\u201d Ling Tuisi looked at him suspiciously.\u201cLet me try, you don\u2019t have anything to lose. If it doesn\u2019t work, the senior can do whatever he wants.\u201d Song Qingshu said confidently.\u201cOkay,\u201d Ling Tuisi was overjoyed, \u201cIf you can really make him tell that secret, after finding the treasure, I will have 70% and you will get 30%. Young man, don\u2019t be too greedy.\u201dBut, he thought in his heart, if I really found the treasure, would I let you walk away your life? The reason he said this was just to reduce his opponent\u2019s vigilance. To make the young scholar think that he was really sincere about sharing the treasure with him.Song Qing showed signs of internal struggle on his face, and finally let out a long sigh, \u201cNever mind, 30% is enough. It\u2019s just that this matter should be handed over to me entirely, and it may take some time, as short as half a month and as long as one month. If that person notices any flaw, our scheme will be over.\u201d\u201cAgreed!\u201d Ling Tuisi hesitated for a while, then nodded in agreement, \u201cYou can use whatever means you want. I will order the relevant people to do their best to cooperate with you. But if you want to eat the entire meal. Think clearly if you have the ability to stomach it. hehe\u2026\u201dSong Qingshu gave a bow and spoke with a wry smile, \u201cI don\u2019t want to become like that person, being severely tortured by the senior for several years in prison.\u201dLing Tuisi\u2019s people secretly monitored Song Qingshu. Although he moved freely in the mansion during this period, he couldn\u2019t move out of the mansion.Song Qingshu didn\u2019t care, and went straight to the cell where Ding Dian was being held. He moved a stool to sit on the side and didn\u2019t speak, but silently looked at the two poor people in the cell.Di Yun was afraid of being beaten by Ding Dian a long time ago. At this time, he quietly hid in the corner without making a sound. Ding Dian saw a new face sitting on the other side, staring at him without saying a word, and angrily said, \u201cWhat are you looking at, you scum!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking at two poor bugs.\u201d Song Qingshu didn\u2019t seem to mind, and said with a faint smile.Ding Dian was fine, but Di Yun was so sad that he started crying. \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d Ding Dian went up to give him another hard beating. Di Yun already had experience in this field. He knew that the more he screamed, the harder he would be beaten. So, he had to bite his teeth and hold on.\u201cDon\u2019t fight, he is not a spy.\u201d Song Qingshu looked at the two who would become good brothers in the future.\u201cIf you say that\u2019s not the case, then he must be a spy. I will kill him.\u201d Ding Dian started hitting harder with his fists.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: SchemingSong Qingshu was stunned and speechless, \u201cWell, then you can treat him as a spy.\u201d\u201cSure enough, he\u2019s a spy!\u201d Ding Dian\u2019s eyes lit up, and Di Yun received another round of beating.\u201cMiss Ling is dying!\u201d Seeing that he accidentally caused Di Yun to get a beating, he felt a little sorry, so he had to sacrifice a big killer move.\u201cWhat!\u201d Ding Dian really stopped, and rushed over with a grim face, \u201cWhat did you just say!\u201d\u201cHow about you let him go first?\u201d There was a cell in between them, so Song Qingshu was not afraid of him rushing out. \u201cThis stupid boy is indeed an unlucky person. He was just thrown here because Ling Tuisi thought that maybe you will tell him the secret in your heart. Ling Tuisi thinks this stupid boy is easier to deal with than you.\u201dIn fact, after many years of staying together, Ding Dian had already figured this out in his mind. Seeing him directly calling Ling Tuisi\u2019s name, he coldly snorted, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cI am a great, kind person who saves people from suffering. You two are suffering so much, so I\u2019m here to give you some respite.\u201d Song Qingshu glanced at the tragic conditions the two were in. Their clothes were worn out, and their bodies were dirty. Thinking of their fate, he felt a little embarrassed to do this.\u201cHuh! What tricks did Ling Tuisi come up with this time?\u201d Ding Dian was full of caution at the moment.\u201cLing Tuisi?\u201d Song Qingshu smiled disdainfully, \u201cHero Ding, how about we make a deal?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want!\u201d Ding Dian didn\u2019t stop him, after knowing that Miss Ling was still all right, he sat back indifferently.\u201cDo you really think I\u2019m here for your Liancheng Swordplay Manual?\u201d Song Qingshu smiled, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t want to hide it from you, I already know the secret of the Liancheng Swordplay Manual that you people have been fighting for.\u201d\u201cHey, go tell these lies to children?\u201d Ding Dian gave a dry laugh.\u201cYou don\u2019t believe it?\u201d Song Qingshu stood up, \u201cI can tell you the secret of Liancheng Swordplay Manual, and see if there is any difference from what you know.\u201d\u201cYou are just talking random shit.\u201d Ding Dian glanced at him suspiciously.Song Qingshu laughed bitterly, and said in a low voice, \u201cHero Ding, I know that your martial arts is not lost, so please listen carefully, are there anyone else within a radius of several meters? If the Ling Tuisi\u2019s men hear it, I am afraid I will not escape a fate similar to yours. My meridians are all broken, and I have no martial arts, so I have to trouble you to listen carefully.\u201dDing Dian also wanted to know the truth, so he closed his eyes and carefully checked, \u201cLet\u2019s talk, within a radius of ten feet, there are no other people except you and me.\u201dSong Qingshu stared at Di Yun, \u201cHe should not know some things to protect his life.\u201d Ding Dian frowned, and then touched Di Yun\u2019s sleeping acupoint.Song Qingshu breathed a sigh of relief and revealed the secret of Liancheng Swordplay Manual. As expected, Ding Dian\u2019s expression changed drastically, he spoke while staring at Song Qingshu, \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not important.\u201d Song Qing said, \u201cNow you should believe that I don\u2019t belong to Ling Tuisi\u2019s group?\u201d\u201cThen why are you looking for me?\u201d Ding Dian was very puzzled.\u201cDidn\u2019t I say that I want to make a deal with you?\u201d Song Qingshu stretched out his hand, \u201cHurry up and check my pulse, and see if your Divine Brilliance Scripture can fix it?\u201dHearing what he said just now, Ding Dian was clear in his heart, and he probed his pulse slightly, and uttered a few words, \u201cIt can be fixed.\u201dSong Qingshu finally calmed down and said, \u201cI really have to say this. Ling Tuisi is really a fool. If he directly made his daughter come here and ask you for the Liancheng Swordplay Manual as a betrothal gift, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201dLing Tuisi thought that everyone in the world was like him. So, he offended Ding Dian, who had a defensive mentality. But he didn\u2019t know that his daughter was far more important than any treasure in Ding Dian\u2019s eyes.Hearing Song Qingshu\u2019s words, Ding Dian suddenly felt a sense of confidence, and his face eased. How could he know that Song Qingshu deliberately said this to make him feel at ease?\u201cIt\u2019s just that I now know his true face. I absolutely refuse to tell him the secret of the Liancheng Swordplay Manual.\u201d Ding Dian said bitterly, with a suffocating anger hidden in his heart for so many years.\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to hand over the Liancheng Swordplay Manual.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled, \u201cThe deal between us is not about Ling Tuisi\u2019s matter.\u201d\u201cWhat deal?\u201d Ding Dian finally got a little interested.\u201cI am responsible for making you and Miss Ling finally get married, and you are responsible for curing my meridians, how about it?\u201d Song Qingshu stared at him with scorching eyes.However, Ding Dian\u2019s face did not show the joy that he imagined, but he sighed, \u201cDo you know why I have been stuck in here willingly for so many years?\u201dSong Qingshu asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBefore I came here, I still hadn\u2019t achieved my current level of martial arts. Also, I can\u2019t bypass the iron wall security of the prison even if I wanted to escape.\u201d Ding Dian smiled bitterly. \u201cSecondly, it\u2019s useless for me to escape. Shuanghua won\u2019t go with me. So, I might as well stay here. Here, I can also look at the Chrysanthemums she placed on the windowsill from a distance to dispel my loneliness.\u201d Ding Dian\u2019s eyes looked affectionately at the small building in the distance through the small window of the cell.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she want to follow you?\u201d Although Song Qingshu knew the general plot, these small details were unknown to him.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Ding Dian showed a gentle expression on his face. \u201cShe is a virtuous lady, and it is normal for her to not elope with a man in obscurity. Moreover, Ling Tuisi forced her to make such a vicious oath.\u201d While speaking about the oath, Ding Dian\u2019s expression became savage.\u201cWhat oath?\u201d Song Qingshu felt a little disapproving of this, it was just a vow. Why are the people in ancient time so stupid?\u201cHer father threatened her with my life and made her vow: She can\u2019t see me again in his lifetime, otherwise her mother\u2019s soul will be tortured day and night in the afterlife.\u201d Ding Dian\u2019s teeth almost broke while he said this.\u201cUsed your life?\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s expression turned strange, \u201cEven if she doesn\u2019t agree, Ling Tuisi won\u2019t kill you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why he is so vicious!\u201d Ding Dianyi took a look at the wall, and suddenly a handprint appeared there.Song Qingshu murmured in his heart, it will be a bit difficult now.As if he knew what Song Qingshu was thinking, Ding Dian said, \u201cIf you can really persuade Shuanghua to run away with me, I can teach you the Divine Brilliance Scripture.\u201dSong Qingshu happily patted his chest, \u201cOkay, leave it to me, I will go to check Miss Ling\u2019s state of mind first, and then we can discuss the matter of the Divine Brilliance Scripture.\u201d Thinking that he finally had the hope of turning over a new leaf, Song Qingshu was delighted for a moment. He hurriedly ran out like a madman.As he looked at Song Qingshu\u2019s somewhat maddened back, Ding Dian coldly smiled, and thought to himself, \u201cHow can anyone possibly hope to learn the Divine Brilliance Scripture in such a short time?\u201dIn fact, Ding Dian couldn\u2019t really be blamed for his deception, he was just really fed up with other humans. Because of his experience with the sinister nature of humanity, he didn\u2019t believe in anyone anymore.When Song Qingshu came to Miss Ling\u2019s small building, he was stopped by the guards, \u201cMaster Ling has an order. No one except him can see Miss Ling.\u201dAfter showing a token, Song Qingshu said, \u201cMaster Ling gave me the permission to do anything\u00a0 in the mansion. Everyone must cooperate with me. I think you should have received the news.\u201dThe two guards looked at each other for a while, still hesitating.\u00a0 Song Qingshu was too excited to care about them, and he directly pushed away the Pudao blocking the front, and went upstairs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: As pale as a\u00a0ChrysanthemumWhen he got to the upper floor, he felt as if there were specks of light dancing everywhere, and there was a vague figure in the depths of the room. The figure had the shape of a woman. Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t enter a lady\u2019s room so abruptly, therefore he had to cough lightly to let her know that someone was coming up.\u201cWho?\u201d Although Ling Shuanghua was alarmed, she didn\u2019t show any other reactions, and just casually asked.Feeling the indifference in her tone, Song Qingshu secretly sighed, this was a beautiful woman who was devastated to death.\u201cUnder the entrustment of Master Ding, I have come to visit Miss Ling.\u201d Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t think of anything better than this. It was the best way to attract her attention.He then heard a thump, which seemed to be the sound of a stool hitting the ground. Sure enough, when Ling Shuanghua heard the news of Ding Dian, she hurried out, opened the gauze curtain, and looked at Song Qingshu anxiously, \u201cWhich Master Ding?\u201dHe saw a young woman in a light yellow dress run up to him. Although her face was covered by light gauze, it couldn\u2019t hide the anxiety on her face. When he looked closely, he noticed some red scars on the edge of the looming veil. Song Qingshu secretly sighed when saw this woman with such a graceful figure. What a beauty she must have been before her disfigurement!\u201cMaster Ding has ordered me to come here and ask Miss Ling a few words.\u201d Song Qingshu respectfully bowed.\u201cIs he\u2026is he doing well these days?\u201d Ling Shuanghua\u2019s voice trembled a little.\u201cUh\u2026 I\u2019m afraid his situation is not so good.\u201d Song Qingshu thought to himself, if their bone was pierced, the tendons were picked, and then tortured in prison for several years, no one would be considered living a good life. \u201cBut he won\u2019t die for the time being.\u201dLing Shuanghua smiled sadly, \u201cI am to blame for all the suffering of Big Brother Ding\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss Ling, since these things have already happened, it\u2019s no use talking about this,\u201d Song Qingshu remembered his intentions for coming here and hurriedly asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want to run away with Master Ding?\u201d\u201cYoung master must have seen it too. My shameful appearance. I pray to God and worship Buddha every day, and I only hope that Big Brother Ding can be safe and live a peaceful life.\u201d Ling Shuanghua gently lifted a corner of the veil, and a few hideous lines lay across her snow-white face.\u201cMiss Ling, I have always admired the love between you and Master Ding. Do you really think Master Ding cares about your appearance?\u201d Song Qingshu frowned. The scars were a bit\u2026somewhat eye-catching, but this shouldn\u2019t be the reason.\u201cOf course I know he will not despise me\u201d Ling Shuanghua sat down slowly at the table, and fiddled with the pot of flowers in front of her, with a gentle smile on her lips, \u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t want him to marry such an ugly wife.\u201dShe was obviously not speaking from her heart, and Song Qingshu was too lazy to initiate a debate with these foolish men and women, so he directly asked, \u201cI heard that Lord Ling forced you to make a poisonous oath, saying that if you see Ding Dian again in this life, your mother\u2019s soul will suffer in the afterlife. Did Miss Ling know that even if you didn\u2019t make this vow, your father wouldn\u2019t kill Master Ding for the sake of Liancheng Swordplay Manual?\u201dSurprisingly, Ling Shuanghua\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change much, but she just turned around and stared at Song Qingshu, \u201cJust now, this lady was anxious, and I haven\u2019t asked the young master\u2019s name\u2026\u201d\u201cThis lowly one is Song Qingshu\u201d This scheme of his put all the scheming Song Qingshu performed in his previous life to shame. Seeing her look, he knew that she had doubts in her heart, so he confessed his plan to work with Ling Tuisi on the surface, but actually secretly reached an agreement with Ding Dian and came to speak to her.After listening to the secret codes that only Ding Dian and she knew, Ling Shuanghua finally let go of her reservations and softly sighed, \u201cI won\u2019t hide it from Young Master Song, when I learned about Liancheng Swordplay Manual, I had already realized my error.\u201d\u201cSwearing such a solemn thing, since it was caused by a lie, naturally it can\u2019t be true.\u201d Song Qingshu comforted her.Ling Shuanghua smiled slightly. Although her appearance was ruined, Song Qingshu still felt the remnants of her beauty from her gestures, \u201cBut when I made that oath, I really did that with utmost sincerity. I don\u2019t want to take the risk of making my mother suffer in the afterlife.\u201dSeeing that Song Qingshu was about to open his mouth to speak again, Ling Shuanghua raised her hand to stop him, and continued, \u201cIn fact, there is another very important reason, I also haven\u2019t spoken of this to Big Brother Ding. At the beginning, the person my father betrothed me was to his immediate superior, the prefect of Xiangyang and the governor of Xi\u2019an in the capital. But, because I fell in love with Big Brother Ding and refused the marriage, I have embarrassed both my father and the Lu family. If I really leave with Big Brother Ding, I am afraid that I will really offend the Lu family to death. No matter how cruel my father is, he is still my father after all. I don\u2019t want to get him into such a big trouble.\u201d\u201cLu Wenhuan?\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s heart jumped, this was something really troublesome. He had been traveling around in this world for a while now, and he had slowly figured out many situations. Xiangyang had been fighting against the Mongolian army for many years. Although it held on with the help of Guo Jing and his wife Huang Rong, the prefect Lu Wenhuan was also a huge contributor. Lu Wenhuan currently managed Jingxiang and was in control of heavy armoured soldiers. His brother Lu Wende guarded the two Huaihe Rivers. These two brothers, together with the Sichuan Xuanyu envoy Yu Jie, were known as the three biggest vassals in the Song Dynasty.Although Ling Tuisi could be regarded as a member of the same faction, compared with Lu Wenhuan, he was still not at the same level. If he offended the Lu family, Ling Tuisi would be finished without a doubt.She really was a filial daughter. Her father was so vicious, but she was still thinking about his safety. Song Qingshu shook his head, it seemed that in order to untie the knot in Ling Shuanghua\u2019s heart, he still had to start from her father.\u201cMay I know if Miss Ling is a believer of Buddhism or Taoism?\u201d Song Qingshu suddenly asked.\u201cWell\u2026 I believe in Buddhism.\u201d Ling Shuanghua didn\u2019t know his intentions for suddenly asking this, and answered questioningly.\u201cThen Miss Ling must be clear about the concept \u2018Six Reincarnations\u2019, can you explain one or two of them for this lowly one?\u201dSeeing Song Qingshu humbly asking for advice, Ling Shuanghua hesitated for a moment, but still softly spoke, \u201cAll beings are drawn to the Six Realms of the cycle of life and death, being bound by karma, just like the turning of a wheel. If you don\u2019t seek liberation, you will always be in the Six Realms. Life and death are perpetual, and never ending\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Six Realms are divided into three higher realms and three lower realms. Then what determines whether one will enter the higher realms or the lower realms during reincarnation?\u201d Song Qingshu suddenly asked.Ling Shuanghua already understood what Song Qingshu was trying to imply a little bit, she slightly smiled, and continued, \u201cFor committing the ten evil karma, you will fall into the three lower realms of Hell, Hungry ghosts, and Animals. On the other hand, by performing the ten good karma you shall be born into the three higher realms of Gods, Asura and Human world.\u201dSong Qingshu gave a look of praise and said, \u201cI heard that Miss Ling\u2019s mother was well-known for her virtue in the city during her lifetime. She must have been doing good deeds her whole life, and it should be impossible for her to fall into the three lower realms. I have never heard of someone virtuous falling to the lower realms. If she doesn\u2019t receive the Shura realm, the only ones remaining can be the Human realm and the God realm. No matter which realm, her soul won\u2019t be suffering. Miss Ling\u2019s oath was, \u2018If I meet with Big Brother Ding again, my mother\u2019s soul will surely suffer in the afterlife day and night\u2019. Therefore, may I ask Miss Ling, do you think she will suffer in the afterlife for the good deeds she had done before or after she was alive?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: The Divine Brilliance\u00a0Scripture\u201cOf course not!\u201d Even without any opinions from the Gods and Buddhas, Ling Shuanghua could never think that her mother would enter the lower three realms.\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu stretched his hands, \u201cMiss Ling, you don\u2019t have to worry about that poisonous oath anymore.\u201d\u201cThank you Song Gongzi for your guidance.\u201d As soon as he enlightened him, Ling Shuanghua felt that her heart suddenly became clear, and a big rock was put down. In the past, she was confused and didn\u2019t realize this. Ding Dian was more of a rough person, and he didn\u2019t have such a delicate mind, which led to the two people being haunted by an unnecessarily poisonous oath for several years.\u201cMiss Ling, don\u2019t worry, there is a way to make you and Master Ding finally get married.\u201d Song Qingshu finally figured out the problem between the two, and felt confident that he was almost done with this drama, and stood up to say goodbye.\u201cWe will have to trouble you with this matter, young master Song.\u201d Ling Shuanghua stood up and replied. Even though her face was ruined, her gestures exuded an elegant and refined temperament. Song Qingshu smiled kindly and turned to leave.\u201cHave you seen Shuanghua?\u201d In the prison Ding Dian stood up in excitement. He stared at Song Qingshu and asked, \u201cHow is she doing?\u201dSong Qingshu shook his head, feeling a little bitter, \u201cYou two love birds say the same thing in the first sentence you utter. Everything is fine for her, but she is a little thin because of excessive worry.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good\u2026\u201d Ding Dian smiled as if he was relieved.\u201cDon\u2019t be too happy.\u201d Song Qingshu coughed lightly, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the Divine Brilliance Scripture.\u201dDing Dian suddenly became vigilant, \u201cAfter Shuanghua and I leave Jingzhou City, we will naturally give you the Divine Brilliance Scripture.\u201dSong Qingshu said with a smile but not a smile, \u201cI don\u2019t even have the power to catch a chicken. What will I do if I can\u2019t keep up and get left behind?\u201d\u201cYou will get it when your task is complete.\u201d Ding Dian crossed his arms and snorted coldly. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for me to teach you now.\u201d\u201cWell, even if your words are creditable. But I don\u2019t know whether your Divine Brilliance Scripture can really heal my meridians\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu said with a skeptical look, \u201cIf I take a risk to complete your task, and then it turns out that the Scriptures were of no use to my injury, so who should I go cry to?\u201d\u201cMy meridians were broken by Ling Tuisi\u2019s men before, but aren\u2019t I still alive?\u201d Ding Dian stretched out his foot to enforce his claim.\u201cEverything is what you said, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the truth or not. So\u2026.no, no, no.\u201d Song Qingshu frowned and walked back and forth. Suddenly his eyes lit up and he clapped his palms. Pass only half of it to me, then wait until I finish the good deed between you and Miss Ling, and then give me the remaining half, how about it? Master Ding, I have made such a concession only because I trust both you and Miss Ling\u2019s character\u2026\u201dDing Dian hesitated for a while, then he realized that a bad payment couldn\u2019t make the sly ghost in front of him work hard, \u201cWell, Shuanghua is the person I love most in this life. What is a mere scripture compared to that? Listen carefully. \u201cDi Yun on the side noticed that Ding Dian was going to teach martial arts, and he was really frustrated, he didn\u2019t dare to take any interest at all. Afraid that he was going to get beaten again, he covered his ears and shrank to the corner of the wall.Ding Dian glanced at him guiltily, \u201cHey, idiot Di Yun, you listen too.\u201dDi Yun shook his head like a rattlesnake, so Ding Dian gave him a fierce look, \u201cYou want to be beaten again, don\u2019t you?\u201dDi Yun was so frightened that he quickly let go of his hands covering his ears and listened while trembling.\u201cI think you seem to be in a hurry, but I still have to remind you.\u201d Seeing Song Qingshu\u2019s expectant look, Ding Dian hesitated for a while, and said, \u201cIt is important to practice martial arts diligently. But if you make haste, there is a chance that you won\u2019t be able to comprehend it. So it must be done step by step. It is necessary to connect with nature and follow the scriptures, and especially, you have to be calm, without any distracting thoughts.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s natural.\u201d Even though he said that, Song Qingshu still sighed in his heart. But he couldn\u2019t help but be in a hurry, lest he might be hunted down at any time.Seeing his pretence, Ding Dian sneered coldly. Regardless of this, he directly recited the contents of the Divine Brilliance Scripture, \u201cA being who is connected with mother nature achieved the root of life, which is based on Yin and Yang. Between heaven and earth, within the six directions, true Qi follows through the nine orifices, stored within the human body, and all will be connected to heaven\u2026\u201d\u201cThe heavenly Qi is pure, follow the will of heaven, harness it, and your yang will be strong. Therefore, a sage illuminates the spirit with heavenly Qi, and aspires to be the divine\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if it was the transmigration that caused his soul to be extraordinarily strong or something, Song Qingshu found that his memory had improved by leaps and bounds, and he had reached the state of unforgettable. He silently read the last few sentences of the first half of the Divine Brilliance Scripture to make sure that he had it all remembered.Then he carefully thought about the contents of the scripture. The core of the Divine Brilliance Scripture is to absorb the qi from the heavens. This cultivation method was quite different from the common way of martial arts, which required meridians and luck. After training, it would continue to nourish the reborn meridians. It was indeed a miraculous skill between heaven and earth.Song Qingshu was overjoyed and said, \u201cThe Divine Brilliance Scripture is really extraordinary. Don\u2019t worry, Master Ding. Although I often ignore proper etiquette, I always value promises and will do my best to help you and Miss Ling elope successfully.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Ding Dian gave him a surprised look. He didn\u2019t even guide this guy in the practice. He only listened to him reciting the scriptures, and he actually managed to produce the aura of the Divine Brilliance Scripture! The rest of the cultivation only needed time, accumulation and refining of the heavenly Qi. Now look at that Di Yun; he, on the other hand, was left in the dust. Ding Dian was shocked. Could this man be a martial arts genius who could be found only once in a century?Song Qingshu also noticed the changes in his body, and was shocked in his heart. How could he pick up such a cheat ability like the video games in his previous life? He would immediately be able to reach the full level just by clicking on the learn button!Was he really a legendary genius who could be seen only once in a hundred years?\u201cScholar Song, Lord Ling has asked you to visit the mansion.\u201d A guard shouted from a distance.\u201cI know, I\u2019ll come right away.\u201d Song Qingshu shouted a reply, then turned around and said to Ding Dian, \u201cMaster Ding, solving most matters between you and Miss Ling have to begin with Ling Tuisi. I will deal with him first.\u201d\u201cIndeed!\u201d Ding Dian nodded expressionlessly, turned around, and stared at the silly boy Di Yun, thinking that a rotten egg couldn\u2019t be put in a basket. Although this silly boy was a bit clumsy, he was better at being loyal and honest. If anything went wrong, he might have to rely on this guy to bury himself and Shuanghua together.\u201cMaster Ling is looking for me in such a hurry! May I know what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Along the way, Song Qingshu felt a faint energy in his body slowly wandering around. Wherever the energy passed, there was a hint of cool and soothing feeling throughout his meridian and acupoints.It slowly lessened the soreness and pain he felt before. Although it didn\u2019t heal his meridians and practicing martial arts still seemed to be out of reach, he was sure it was only because the Divine Brilliance Scripture he had learned was incomplete. And when he gets the complete Divine Brilliance Scripture in the future, it would no longer be a problem to heal himself completely.\u201cThe young Scholar seems to be unusually happy. Did you find something?\u201d Ling Tuisi asked with a gloomy expression while holding a cup of tea.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: Madam Guo, Huang\u00a0RongSong Qingshu\u2019s heart tightened, and he quickly spoke up to deal with the situation, \u201cI have found a way.\u201d\u201cReally? I would like to hear about it then.\u201d Ling Tuisi put down the tea cup and stared carefully at his eyes. \u201cI heard that young scholar Song ran into my daughter\u2019s room during this period, and later went to the cell to have a chat with Ding Dian. What is your plan?\u201dAs a member of the ruling faction, Ling Tuisi exuded a trace of majesty and oppressive force, which made Song Qingshu feel uncomfortable. He thought with hatred in his heart, \u2018I built a business empire with my own two hands, walked above who knows how many people and here you are trying to intimidate me with such a weak domineering spirit. No matter, you should enjoy it while you have the chance.\u2019Of course, he never dared to say that out loud, and explained in a slightly humble tone, \u201cI don\u2019t dare hide anything from the lord. When I saw that the various tortures you put him through for so many years had no effect, I simply changed my mind.\u00a0 Although I had no such intention before, when I learned that Ding Dian seemed to have been coveting your beloved daughter for a long time. I decided to start from this aspect. I used Miss Ling as bait and pretended to help them run away. Ding Dian really agreed to the plan, and his tone began to soften \u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got guts! You actually used my daughter\u2019s reputation to make a deal.\u201d Ling Tuisi once again picked up the tea cup on the table. His words shocked Song Qingshu, and maligned himself, \u2018Old man, you are a person who would be willing to kill his own daughter for getting his hands on the treasure. But now, you are sitting here, showing false nobility.\u2019\u201cDid he say anything?\u201d Ling Tuisi asked indifferently, changing his tone.\u201cHe promised to tell the secret of Liancheng Swordplay Manual after the matter is done.\u201d Song Qingshu said while paying attention to Ling Tuisi\u2019s expression.Ling Tuisi angrily said, \u201cCould it be that you want this Official to give him my daughter in exchange for some Sword Manual?\u201d\u201cNaturally not,\u201d Song Qingshu said with a smile. \u201cThe Lord holds a lot of power in his hand and has many masters. After that guy tells the secret, it will be just a matter of killing him or letting him go. Isn\u2019t it an easy matter for the Lord?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Ling Tuisi looked at him and smiled, but he snorted coldly in his heart, \u2018and by the way, even you will be killed.\u2019Ding Dian, who was hiding in the dark, was furious when he heard them having such a conversation, and he even had the impulse to just rush out and kill this shameless villain Song Qingshu. It turned out that, after Ding Dian had experienced the dangers of the world, he would not believe in what anyone said that easily. Now that his martial arts were in the realm of great accomplishment, it was not difficult for him to quietly slip out of the cell. When he saw Ling Tuisi summoning Song Qingshu, he quietly followed him as soon as he had a feeling of being tricked.But, Ding Dian suddenly frowned, and glanced in the distance. He felt the arrival of a master. At this moment, he was concerned about how to run away with Ling Shuanghua. So, he didn\u2019t want to cause any unnecessary trouble. He turned his head and took a deep look at the two people in the house before turning around to leave.\u201cEsteemed Lord, Master Lu\u2019s messenger from Xiangyang City has arrived in Jingzhou City and is asking for an audience outside the mansion.\u201d A government officer hurried to the door to report.\u201cI shall take my leave first.\u201d Song Qingshu knew that they had military plans to discuss and prepared to leave without showing any interest.Looking at Song Qingshu\u2019s back, Ling Tuisi had thought in his heart, and said, \u201cYou might as well stay to accompany this Official to meet them. It\u2019s a pity that scholar Song is young, and his talents are wasted in the wilderness of Wulin. You should stay with me more from now on, maybe in the future you can become the right hand man of this Official.\u201dSong Qingshu heard his soft approach, and he was surprised. But he quickly realized that Ling Tuisi was trying to reassure him under the guise of solicitation. In fact, he was trying to make him lower his defense. After understanding, Song Qingshu snorted in his heart, and followed Ling Tuisi to greet the guests.Not long after, they saw a group of several people walk in. They were headed by a beautiful young married woman. The woman was truly pretty as a spring flower, beautiful as a morning sunshine. There was a faint smile on her exquisite red lips. There seems to be a hint of amorousness hidden between her eyebrows.Song Qingshu only glanced at her for a moment, and quickly lowered his head and dared not to look at her again. His heart was pounding, and he cried out in his heart, \u201cOh my god, there is such a beautiful woman in the world!\u201dAfter a while, he was a little annoyed when he thought about the fact that he was not some inexperienced shy virgin, so he raised his head to carefully appreciate this great beauty in front of him.Ling Tuisi\u2019s next words quickly solved all the doubts in Song Qingshu\u2019s heart, \u201cMay I know why Leader Huang of the Beggars\u2019 Sect will come to Jiangling in person.\u201dShe turned out to be Huang Rong! Song Qingshu suddenly realized that she was the only one in the world who could have such a heroic aura and mature charm.\u201cI have seen Master Ling. This little sister came this time mainly for two reasons. Firstly, Master Lu in Xiangyang came to urge the rations for next month. As for the second reason\u2026\u201d Huang Rong smiled lightly, her smile charmed those around, including Ling Tuisui, \u201cWe got an important news from the Beggars\u2019 Sect. Recently, someone in the Wulin is preparing to assassinate the Lord. Senior is important for the safety of the rear of Xiangyang City. After discussing it with my husband and Master Lu. It was decided that little sister would immediately bring some people to protect him. I hope Lord Ling will understand.\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s expression changed drastically, and he was shocked. Could it be that Huang Rong was referring to him? It didn\u2019t make any sense, how could she get that news in advance.Ling Tuisi glanced at Song Qingshu without him noticing, then smiled, \u201cI thank Master Lu and Master Guo, for their concern. Does Leader Huang know the origin of the assassin?\u201d\u201cAfter many investigations, our Beggars\u2019 Sect finally figured out their identity.\u201d Huang Rong gestured with a slight bow, \u201cThey seem to be from the Snowy Mountain Sect of the Western Regions.\u201d\u201cSnowy Mountain Sect?\u201d Although Ling Tuisi was a prefect, he was also considered a half martial artist, and he knew a little bit about the Snowy Mountain Sect. \u201cBai Zizai\u2019s Snowy Mountain Sect?\u201d\u201cNot bad!\u201d Huang Rong nodded, then a worried look appeared on her pretty face, \u201cThe Snowy Mountain Swordsmanship of the Snowy Mountain Sect is well-known all over the world. They also have many masters. This time you must prepare a good defensive force.\u201d\u201cThere is no enmity between this Official and the Snowy Mountain Sect, why would they come to assassinate me?\u201d Ling Tuisi asked suspiciously, wondering if Lu Wenhuan wanted to take this opportunity to plant his cronies in Jingzhou?Huang Rong had a clever mind. When she noticed Ling Tuisi\u2019s skeptical look, she was concerned that he would not fully cooperate. She was afraid that everything would go wrong if that were to happen, and so she quickly explained, \u201cLord Ling probably doesn\u2019t know this. The Snowy Mountain Sect is located in the Western Regions. The Western Regions are now under the control of Mongolia. The various tribes there now stand in a three-pronged position, and various small forces have chosen their own camps. The Snowy Mountain Sect\u00a0 recently decided to join the Mongolian country, but was worried that they would not be taken seriously after their refuge, and planned to earn a big credit for promotion. I don\u2019t know why the Snowy Mountain Sect did not seek refuge from the Prince of Ruyang, who was in charge of the Western Regions. Instead, they turned to Kublai Khan. When they heard that Kublai had been attacking Xiangyang for a long time, they decided to start with you, Esteemed Lord.\u201d\u201cThis is really unreasonable!\u201d Ling Tuisi snorted coldly, \u201cAn insignificant Snowy Mountain Sect dares to bully this Official?\u201d\u201cLord Ling must not be careless,\u201d Huang Rong advised, \u201cThe Snowy Mountain Sect deployed all of its masters this time. The Beggars\u2019 Sect found out that they seemed to have mixed into Jingzhou City in batches. It is better to take precautions.\u201d\u201cCall the guards!\u201d Ling Tuisi thought for a while and called for his subordinates to go select a hundred people with high martial arts from the army and ordered them to join the Prefect Guards. He instructed the city guards to intensify their inspections inside the city, and then wait for the opportunity. When the Prefect Manson had an accident they could arrive to help as soon as possible.After Ling Tuisi arranged everything, he saw that Huang Rong was expressionless, so he quickly asked, \u201cLeader Huang is famous for being resourceful, I wonder if this arrangement is appropriate?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: The jealous Madam\u00a0Hu\u201cThe Lord\u2019s strategy is superb, and the arrangement is well-organized. When I think that the Senior is from Hanlin Imperial Academy, this younger sister can only sincerely admire you.\u201d Huang Rong\u2019s flattery made the schemer Ling Tuisi feel a little satisfied with himself. After all, he was being praised by such a bright woman in person. No man could avoid feeling a little proud.\u201cIt\u2019s just that there will inevitably be flaws and gaps when the soldiers are patrolling. It will be better if this younger sister and the members of the Beggar\u2019s Sect stays in the mansion, just in case our help is needed.\u201d Huang Rong\u2019s soft voice made Ling Tuisi thoughtful and lifted up his mood.\u201cGood, good,\u201d Ling Tuisi smiled cheerfully, then looked at the people behind Huang Rong and asked, \u201cWho are these people?\u201d\u201cThese two are my husband\u2019s disciples, Wu Xiuwen and Wu Dunru. These are the brothers of our Beggars\u2019 Sect,\u201d Huang Rong introduced them in turn.The two rotten woods that Yang Guo evaluated as \u201cKing of the pigs\u201d? Song Qingshu looked at the two curiously, their appearance was pretty good, and they seemed to have decent martial arts, so they shouldn\u2019t be that bad.The next few hours were the two sides chatting about the battle on the front line in Xiangyang. Song Qingshu was so bored that he found a gap and took the opportunity to retreat.Even the famous Huang Rong was now here, coupled with the Snowy Mountain Sect with bad intentions, and Wu Liuqi who was hiding in the dark. The waters of the Jingzhou City were really surging. So it seemed that it would be easier to send Ding Dian and Ling Shuanghua out of Jingzhou.When he came to a secluded place in the mansion, Song Qingshu stretched his waist and sat down under a big tree. After a while, there were two soft hums behind him. Song Qingshu\u2019s lips showed a slight smile, but he did not open his eyes. He opened his mouth and softly spoke, \u201cYou are here~\u201d\u201cAre you too lazy to even call me Sister-in-law now?\u201d Madam Hu angrily groaned and flashed out from the dark.When the beauty arrived, all the gloom cleared away. Song Qingshu stood up, \u201cWho makes my Sister-in-law look so young and delicate? From the outside, you are still young enough to be my little sister. I am afraid that by calling you sister-in-law, I might make you seem old.\u201dEven though she knew that he was teasing her, Madam Hu found that she couldn\u2019t get angry from the bottom of her heart, so she could only comfort herself by thinking, \u2018Brother-in-law is a careless and informal person.\u2019\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d Madam Hu deliberately made her face look stern, \u201cQuickly tell me if there is anything for me to do. The Prefect\u2019s Mansion is now heavily guarded, and I must leave as soon as possible to avoid being discovered.\u201dIt turned out that Song Qingshu had anticipated that it would be difficult for him to communicate with the outside world before entering the Mansion, so he made an agreement with Madam Hu to meet here at this tree every evening.Madam Hu would secretly monitor the situation from outside the mansion. If Song Qingshu didn\u2019t come, that meant there was nothing wrong. But, if he came, it meant that he had something to tell her. So she sneaked into the mansion using her movement technique, and spotted two people who were secretly monitoring Song Qingshu. She knocked the two of them unconscious, then came out to meet him.While talking Song Qingshu brought up Huang Rong and told Madam Hu about the assassination plans of the Snowy Mountain Sect. When Madam Hu heard him talking about Huang Rong, her eyes lit up, and she felt a little uncomfortable. She softly asked, \u201cRumors say that Huang Rong was previously the number one beauty in the world. Ah, is she really so beautiful?\u201dSong Qingshu didn\u2019t expect that she would actually ask about this matter after being informed about the overall situation. He hesitated, and excitedly spoke, \u201cShe is indeed stunning. Although she does not have the youthful innocence of a young girl anymore. She has become a mature woman. Full of mature charm\u2026\u201dWhile talking he noticed that Madam Hu\u2019s face was getting colder and colder. Song Qingshu suddenly realized something and he patted his head in secret. Then he changed the topic of the conversation, \u201cBut, she is much older than I expected. She is old and declining. I am afraid that her title of a top beauty has long been misplaced. I think my sister-in-law is more beautiful than her.\u201dMadam Hu blushed and inwardly hissed, \u201cLeader Huang of the Beggars\u2019 Sect is only in her early thirties, so she is not as old as you speak. I know that you are only saying this to make me happy. Will you talk ill about your sister-in-law like this as well in front of other women in the future? \u201c\u201cHow do I dare!\u201d Song Qingshu was speechless, and quickly changed the subject, \u201cSister-in-law, let\u2019s talk about business. You can inform the Snowy Mountain Sect about the situation here and let them know that they can initiate on the fifteenth day of this month. Ling Tuisi wants to interrogate Ding Dian on that day, and as he doesn\u2019t want other people to know about Liancheng Swordplay Manual, the guards will be relatively weaker.\u201d\u201cWell, I recently ran into a group of people on the outskirts of the city. At that time, they still wanted to kill me to leave no evidence. Now it seems that they should be the members of the Snowy Mountain Sect.\u201d Madam Hu recalled, \u201cI know their faces. It won\u2019t be difficult to find them. I will definitely make sure they receive this information.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Song Qingshu was greatly surprised. Although he knew that Madam Hu was standing in front of him now, he was still shocked, so he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cIs my sister-in-law hurt anywhere?\u201dShe didn\u2019t know why, but Madam Hu suddenly thought of the last time she hurt her ribs and was taken advantage of by him. A blush appeared below her neck, and she quickly said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, and my own martial arts is still passable. Additionally, with the White Python Whip you taught me last time, self-protection is more than enough.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good,\u201d Song Qingshu said with a smirk, \u201cThen my sister-in-law must be careful this time, and it will be best if you don\u2019t show yourself.\u201dNoticing his show of deep concern, the lonely and helpless Madam Hu, who had been dependent on Fei\u2019er for many years, felt a trace of warmth in her heart, and replied softly, \u201cBrother-in-law you can rest assured, I will be careful.\u201dGazing at the moving figure when Madam Hu left, Song Qingshu felt particularly comfortable. He came to the side to awake the two people who had been knocked out, and directly left the place.The two government officials were left wondering, they looked at each other and said, \u201cDid something happen just now?\u201d\u201cWould you like to inform the lord of the mansion?\u201d\u201cAre you stupid, can we afford to tell this to the lord? No one knows about this anyway. Song Qingshu is still here, and nothing bad has happened.\u201d\u201cThe senior brother has experience, this junior one admires you!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. I have been in this mansion for so many years and I have learned a few things.\u201dIn the next few days, Song Qingshu came across Huang Rong several times in the mansion. Although he couldn\u2019t stare at her enough, he knew well that currently the difference between the two of them was like heaven and earth, without the slightest chance of forming any connection. So, each time he\u00a0 just walked away after a slight nod.On the other hand, Huang Rong had a good impression of him. Over the years, from Ouyang Ke in the past, to many people from the Wulin, to the officials of Xiangyang City, and even the prefect Lu Wenhuan, every time they saw her, although it had been disguised, the longing in their eyes was clear.This was the first time she saw such a clear-eyed young man in Jingzhou City. He had a calm temperament and scholarly aura. When she learned that he was the staff member Ling Tuisi recently appointed, she frowned and looked at his leaving back. She began to think.Time flew, and soon it was the fifteenth day.Because Huang Rong and others were here, Ling Tuisi wanted to suspend the interrogation of Ding Dian this month. But Song Qingshu claimed that he was now at the critical stage of his plans. If Ling Tuisi suspended the interrogation, Ding Dian would become suspicious and he might think that the two were in collusion. Then all of their previous efforts will go to waste.Ling Tuisi thought it was logical, so he found a reason to dismiss Huang Rong and the others, set up a punishment hall in the inner room, and sent someone to escort Ding Dian there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Snowy Mountain Sword Art vs Shadowless\u00a0Fist\u201cI say Master Ding, you have been suffering here for so many years, even if you are not tired, the lord has gotten quite tired of all this.\u201d Song Qingshu looked at Ding Dian in the hall and deliberately said, \u201cJust say it and get it all over with.\u201d\u201cBah!\u201d Ding Dian gave Song Qingshu a vicious look.The look in Ding Dian\u2019s eyes made Song Qingshu\u2019s heart tremble. He gave him a thumbs up in his head and thought, \u2018Great work! This guy could win an Oscar for his acting skills.\u2019\u201cBeat him.\u201d Ling Tuisi sneered a few times. All that torture for so many years was proving to be useless. Now he was losing his patience. He ordered the execution of the punishment out of habit.\u201cPuff puff puff!\u201d The stick fiercely fell on Ding Dian\u2019s body without stopping, and the sound of flesh getting hit filled the room. Ding Dian did not say a word, he just silently endured it. He also didn\u2019t dare to resist it with his strength, for fear of being found out by Ling Tuisi. This kind of normal skin trauma was nothing to him. If he circulated some true Qi for a few moments after going back to the cell, the injury would heal naturally.\u201cFather, please don\u2019t force Big Brother Ding!\u201d At this time, a female voice came from behind. It made Ding Dian tremble all over, and he swiftly turned his head in excitement. It was indeed Ling Shuanghua that he had been thinking about day and night.In the hall, Ling Tuisi was shocked and angry. He raised his finger to point at Ling Shuanghua and said, \u201cWhy are you here? Have you forgotten the vow you made at that time!\u201d\u201cThis daughter has never forgotten.\u201d Ling Shuanghua walked over to help Ding Dian and turned around. \u201cFortunately, this daughter has been enlightened by an expert and realized that my mother has done good all her life, and now I am certain that she has reached the Western Paradise (Sukhavati), so she will naturally not suffer in the afterlife.\u201dLing Tuisi\u2019s expression changed drastically, and he stared fiercely at Song Qingshu. At this moment, there was a loud bang, the door was knocked apart, and a soldier vomited blood and was thrown in.\u201cThere are assassins!\u201d The stern voice coming from outside made the hearts of everyone in the room jump.There were sounds of fighting and blades, Ling Tuisi\u2019s guards couldn\u2019t resist for long, and were steadily getting forced back. Soon a few men dressed as swordsmen rushed in, when they noticed Ling Tuisi on the main seat, their eyes brightened. And one of them rushed over.The guards on the left and right of Ling Tuisi pulled out their weapons and faced their assault, which initiated a\u00a0 bitter fight. Song Qingshu noticed that the swordsmanship of these people were complicated and varied, and Ling Tuisi\u2019s guards fell one by one.\u201cFather!\u201d Ling Shuanghua anxiously cried out when she saw one of the swordsmen leaping high, and stabbing at Ling Tuisi with a sword.Ding Dian really loved Ling Shuanghua to the extreme. And, he couldn\u2019t bear her slight grievance. When he saw this, he was shocked. The iron chain on his body broke to pieces. He kicked the ground with his feet, and arrived in front of Ling Tuisi in a hair\u2019s breadth.The swordsman was taken aback and hurried back to save himself. Regardless of his complicated swordsmanship, Ding Dian aimed straight to the man\u2019s body, changed his fists to claws, and grabbed the opponent\u2019s chest at once. The opponent was caught by him and immediately went limp all over.Song Qingshu hid behind a pillar and stretched out his head to look, only to see that the person had no breath, he was dead! He took a breath of cold air, and quickly retracted his head, while muttering in his heart, \u201cOne dead daoist is better than two live daoist. You can fight all you want. The more chaotic the fight will be, the better. Don\u2019t mind me. Brothers, I haven\u2019t even got to try what martial arts feels like, so I don\u2019t want to die before my wish is fulfilled.\u201d\u201cDivine Brilliance Scripture and Shadowless Fist? You are Ding Dian!\u201d Several swordsmen in the hall had already cleaned up the remaining guards. When they turned around to see that scene, their leader exclaimed.It turned out that the Snowy Mountain Sect had specifically investigated all the masters in Jingxiang before coming for this mission, so naturally they also knew about Ding Dian, a powerful martial artist.The arrow had been shot, and this matter had to end. Now the Snowy Mountain Sect could only hope for a quick fight, otherwise, if the guards outside the mansion reacted, they were afraid that their whole forces would be wiped out. Their leader also understood this quite clearly, \u201cJunior Brother Feng, Uncle Master and the others are almost unable to hold on outside the door. So I will hold him back first, you go and kill Ling Tuisi, then we will retreat.\u201d After speaking, we swung his sword and attacked Ding Dian.\u201cHuh?\u201d Ding Dian jumped into the air when he saw the sword strike. He immediately noticed that there was a faint chill coming from the blade of that sword, and he realized that this man\u2019s martial arts was much higher than the one just now.\u00a0 He spotted several other Snowy Mountain Sect members from the corner of his eyes. Their aim was the concealed Ling Tuisi. Ding Dian became anxious in his heart, and kicked a chair over,\u00a0 temporarily obstructing the way of those few people, and took the opportunity to jump over and stop them.Ding Dian stopped all four Snow Mountain Sect swordsmen by himself, found a few flaws in their martial art, and sent two of them to their afterlife. As a result, the Snowy Mountain Sect had only two strong martial artists struggling to support them.Ding Dian knew that the martial arts of these two men were much higher than that of the other Snowy Mountain Sect disciples, and he realized that he couldn\u2019t beat them in a short time. He thought in his heart, and opened his mouth to ask, \u201cAre the two of you called Bai Wanjian and Feng Wanli?\u201dBai Wanjian and Feng Wanli became more and more frightened as the battle progressed. This Ding Dian\u2019s martial arts was probably better than their father\u2019s (master). Hearing the constant shouts from a distance, they knew that the mission was impossible to succeed. They glanced at each other, hurriedly attacked with a few sword strikes to force Ding Dian away, and both leaped outside the mansion, \u201cDing Dian, today\u2019s hatred, the Snowy Mountain Sect will remember it.\u201dDing Dian also had no intention of pursuing, and silently returned to Ling Shuanghua. Seeing the painful groaning of the men in the room, Ling Tuisi looked at the two men in the hall with a sullen expression on his face.Before he could even open his mouth, suddenly all the roof tiles above his head shattered. A black shadow fell from the air, and immediately arrived in front of Ling Tuisi. His left hand grabbed Ling Tuisi\u2019s throat like a tong, and the right hand pressed on his chest. Even if there was a slight movement from the strong palm, it could kill Ling Tuisi.Song Qingshu, who was hiding behind the pillar, secretly cried out. Wu Liuqi\u2019s arrival at this time might ruin his plan.Wu Liuqi yelled out loud, \u201cDing Dian, you have learned my senior brother\u2019s martial skills, then why did you help and protect this enemy who killed my senior brother. Is it because you were fascinated by his daughter\u2019s beauty?\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s expression on the side suddenly became a little strange. What beauty does Ling Shuanghua have now? Wu Liuqi had only looked at her graceful figure, and he assumed that she was a great beauty.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Ding Dian was also taken aback. He and Mei Niansheng spent a very short time together. He didn\u2019t know that he still had a little Uncle Master.\u201cMei Niansheng is my senior, who do you think I am?\u201d Wu Liuqi said angrily when he realized that Ding Dian didn\u2019t even know him.\u201cWu Liuqi, the beggar in the snow, it\u2019s normal for Master Ding to not know you.\u201d With a nice female voice, Huang Rong slowly walked in. It turned out that Huang Rong and her party quickly realized that something was wrong with the sound of fighting coming from the prefect\u2019s mansion. When they swiftly ran over, they happened to encounter Wu Liuqi grabbing Ling Tuisi.\u201cLeader Huang\u2026\u201d Wu Liuqi\u2019s expression turned a little ugly when he saw Huang Rong\u2019s figure.\u201cElder Wu, it was excusable for you to leave the Beggar Gang that day, but why are you now helping the Mongol to assassinate our Song court official?\u201d Huang Rong asked indifferently.It turned out that when Huang Rong followed her husband in Xiangyang for many years, she treated the Beggars\u2019 Sect only as a tool. She neglected its management, and during the years of the Song-Mongolian war, the Beggars\u2019 Sect was made to help and suffered heavy casualties. This caused dissatisfaction with some members. They felt that Huang Rong was selfish and dragged them into the struggle between countries. Many people were also really worried about the future. In addition, Huang Rong was a female leader, so there were more and more complaints among the members.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Flower Stealing MasterCH 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Beggars\u2019 Sect was known as one of the largest sects in the world. But, although they had a large number of members, the organization was very loose in its structure. Huang Rong soon realized that there were many people with varied intentions, and it was only a matter of time before the Beggars\u2019 Sect split up. In order to avoid the devastation caused by the great turmoil, Huang Rong took the initiative to propose a method of divide and conquer.She led a part of the force to guard Xiangyang. Many of the Beggars were from the Yanzhao area. They had always been homesick. Some of them wanted to participate in the national struggle and another just wanted to be in the Wulin. Huang Rong simply appointed Wang Jiantong, the leader of one group, as the leader of the first faction. On the other hand, she appointed Shi Huolong as the leader of another faction and let them wander the Wulin as they pleased.Everyone was greatly satisfied with this action. Wang Jiantong and Shi Huolong got the name of the sect leader. Since they got what they wanted, they wouldn\u2019t have any dissatisfaction and naturally won\u2019t cause trouble.For Huang Rong,\u00a0 the situation where the sect would split was a foregone conclusion, so she made a decisive decision. Rather than let the two of them rise up, and let both sides tear their faces, it was better to personally give them the name of the sect leader. In this way, the positions of the two sect leaders would be given by her. Although the three of them would be sect leaders, and they seemed to be equal, but In the hearts of everyone in the Beggar\u2019s Sect, her status had suddenly become lofty, and her prestige had risen instead of decreasing.Moreover, after this division, her strength did not decrease that much, instead she eliminated some of her confidential problems over the years, and was able to help her husband guard Xiangyang more steadily.In addition, the two branches that were divided worked hard for years to come. Specifically, the Hebei branch had produced the hero, Qiao Feng. Under his leadership, the reputation of the Beggar\u2019s Sect of the Hebei branch had become one of the best in Wulin. He became the rudder of the Beggar\u2019s Sect. But unfortunately, for various reasons, Qiao Feng left the Beggar\u2019s Sect and became the king of the southern courtyard of the Khitan. Due to his departure the Hebei line was never as strong as it was before.With the assistance of the elder Chen Youliang, Shi Huolong, the sect leader of the other branch, recruited many martial artists from the Wulin, and now his reputation in the Jiangnan Wulin even surpassed that of the Xiangyang headquarters.Wu Liuqi belonged to the Jiangnan branch, but due to a dispute of opinion, he injured another elder and was expelled from the sect. Although Huang Rong was no longer their direct leader, he had seen her in Xiangyang before. Huang Rong had also paid attention to matters in the Beggar\u2019s Sect, so she knew that Wu Liuqi was expelled from the sect.Wu Liuqi was frightened by Huang Rong\u2019s prestige, he hesitated immediately, but when he thought of his senior brother, he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cLeader Huang, this subordinate also knows that Ling Tuisi is related to the logistics of Xiangyang, but this person killed my senior brother for a treasure. So, this subordinate must take revenge for him!\u201d After he finished speaking, he prepared to break Ling Tuisi\u2019s neck.Ling Shuanghua exclaimed, and at this time an urgent voice came from behind the pillar, \u201cMei Niansheng was killed by the traitor Wan Zhenshan!\u201dWu Liuqi looked back and saw Song Qingshu helplessly walk out.There was no other option for him but to come out. If Ling Tuisi was killed by Wu Liuqi, no one knew what Ling Shuanghua would do, and his chance of acquiring the Divine Brilliance Scripture could be ruined. Even if Ling Shuanghua was discouraged and followed Ding Dian to go far away. In Dian Dian\u2019s opinion, he didn\u2019t play any role in it at all, so why should he give him the Divine Brilliance Scripture?Song Qingshu sorted out his thoughts and spread out his hands, \u201cHero, be merciful and see clearly. I don\u2019t have any martial arts, and my weak arms and legs can\u2019t stand even a weak slap from anyone present here. Please don\u2019t try to attack on a whim. That\u2019s great.\u201dHuang Rong smiled sweetly, but Wu Liuqi was a little impatient to hear his bullshit, \u201cIf you have something to say, then quickly speak!\u201dSong Qingshu was not worried, and quickly said, \u201cMei Niansheng was killed by his three apprentices Wan Zhenshan, Yan Daping, and Qi Changfa. You must be wondering how the insignificant martial arts of the three of them hurt your senior? I will tell you, it was Qi Changfa who pretended to be loyal to the master, he went behind Mei Niansheng and stabbed him with a sword. Mei Niansheng was seriously injured, and the three of them succeeded in their vile plot.\u201dWu Liuqi was a little dizzy after hearing all the info dump, but he finally understood, and looked at Ding Dian suspiciously, \u201cIs that really the case?\u201dDing Dian glanced at Song Qingshu and nodded, \u201cAll that he said is true, I saved my master who fell into the water and got the true details from the master himself.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe him, you can take a look at the appearance of this lady.\u201d At this time, Ling Shuanghua also spoke up and unwrapped her veil. The scarlet scars on her face made everyone in the hall take a deep breath, and Ling Shuanghua smiled sadly, \u201cDo you think Big Brother Ding will be fascinated by my \u2018beauty\u2019?\u201dDing Dian felt a pain in his heart and gently held her hands, \u201cShuanghua, no matter what you become, in my heart you will always be the beautiful girl I met at the Chrysanthemum Festival.\u201dHuang Rong glanced at the two in surprise. She did hear before that Miss Ling refused to marry Master Lu in Xiangyang for another man, and even disfigured herself to show her determination. Today, when she saw them, she realized just how deep their love was.At that time, Wu Liuqi didn\u2019t know that Song Qingshu was present when he attacked Wan Zhenshan. For a while, he did not know how to face Huang Rong, his former sect leader. He let out a loud cry, released Ling Tuisi, and flew out through the window.Ling Tuisi sat down with a dark face, touched his neck with one hand, and pointed at Ding Dian with the other, \u201cCapture this felon down to me.\u201d The soldiers who came drew out their sabers and surrounded Ding Dian.Huang Rong couldn\u2019t figure out the grievances between the two for a while. She guessed whether the reason for Ling Tuisi\u2019s deep hatred was that his daughter was ruined by Ding Dian, so he wanted to deal with him. With a conflicted mind, Huang Rong had to stand aside and watch the changes.Song Qingshu took a long sigh and finally had the chance to act according to his own script. Now was the perfect time for him to appear on the stage.\u201cMaster Ling, I have something to tell you.\u201d Song Qingshu bowed respectfully.Thinking of being saved by him just now, Ling Tuisi\u2019s expression calmed down, \u201cScholar Song, please say.\u201d\u201cAlthough this Ding Dian is hateful, he saved the lord\u2019s life from the hands of the Snowy Mountain Sect just now.\u201d Song Qingshu laughed a little strangely. \u201cHis attitude just now shows that he and Miss Ling really love each other. I dare to suggest here, why don\u2019t you make the right decision and allow them to be together?\u201dDing Dian couldn\u2019t help but sneer. If Ling Tuisi was that easy to convince, would he and Shuanghua suffer for so many years.But what made everyone\u2019s eyes fall to the ground was that Ling Tuisi hesitated for a moment before actually saying, \u201cOkay!\u201dDing Dian and Ling Shuanghua looked at each other in disbelief, and Ling Tuisi continued to say, \u201cDing Dian, this official will betroth Shuanghua to you today, and you must treat her well in the future. The grievances between us are really hard to forget. So, I never want to see you anymore. Go away. The farther you go, the better!\u201dSong Qingshu noticed that Ding Dian was stunned, and angrily said, \u201cWon\u2019t you pay respect to your father-in-law?\u201dDing Dian knelt down with great joy, and stubbornly kowtowed a few times,\u201dThis son-in-law thanks my father-in-law.\u201d At that moment, he only felt that all the torture he had suffered over the years was worth it.Ling Shuanghua also cried with joy, and then knelt down and reverently kowtowed a few times in order to thank him for his many years of nurturing.\u201cHurry up, or I might change my mind at any time. Maybe I will regret it and come to chase you tomorrow.\u201d Ling Tuisi touched his forehead and waved his other hand impatiently.\u201cBig Brother Ding, take Miss Ling away quickly.\u201d Song Qingshu came over to help Ding Dian, whispered in his ear, and pinched him on his shoulders.Ding Dian immediately woke up, this Ling Tuisi had too much contrast in character before and after. So something weird must be happening here. He hurriedly pulled Ling Shuanghua and ran out.Huang Rong on the side looked suspicious and looked up in the hall. When she noticed Ling Tuisi\u2019s muddy eyes and numb expression, her heart jumped, \u2018Could it be\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Similar to the Bewitching Technique of the \u201cNine Yin Scriptures\u201d?\u201d She was planning to step forward to find out, but when she saw Ding Dian and Ling Shuanghua\u2019s happiness, she hesitated for a moment.But soon after Huang Rong had this thought, she had another idea. She remembered the incident of Ling Shuanghua\u2019s marriage with the son of the Lu family. It caused a rift between the Lu Ling family and the Ling family. Her brother Jing was focused on national affairs and never considered the affairs of the family, thus she had to make more plans for the family. Their daughter Fu\u2019er had grown up. That son of Lu family was talented in both civil and military, if they were to be married, Lu Wenhuan would definitely not restrict or guard against her brother Jing.Making up her mind, Huang Rong faintly smiled, and let these few people leave. When Song Qingshu passed by her, Huang Rong lowered her voice and said with a smile, \u201cScholar Song\u2019s Nine Yin Scripture is well practiced.\u201dMadame Hu was waiting outside the residence, and their group of four left Jingzhou City overnight. It wasn\u2019t until they stopped at a ruined temple on the outskirts of the city that Song Qingshu breathed a sigh of relief. His back was already soaked in cold sweat. His plan was a great one, but he forgot that Huang Rong had also practiced the Nine Yin Scripture. He didn\u2019t know why she didn\u2019t stop him. \u2018It\u2019s all because of my good karma\u2019, Song Qingshu cried out in his heart.With a light cough, Song Qingshu approached Ding Dian and\u00a0 Ling Shuanghua, \u201cMaster Ding, as promised I have made it possible for you lovers to finally get married. I wish you two a long and happy married life. But I hope you will keep your part of the\u00a0 promise and will teach me the remaining half of the Divine Brilliance Scripture.\u201dDing Dian smiled, \u201cOkay, listen carefully.\u201dSong Qingshu concentrated his attention and leaned forward, but Ding Dian suddenly struck him with a fist.Madame Hu felt something was wrong when she noticed that Ding Dian was laughing, so she kept her attention on him. But Ding Dian\u2019s strike was too fast, she had no time to counter, so she could only jump and stand in front of Song Qingshu.Ding Dian\u2019s fist strike hit Madame Hu on the back, and she snorted and sprayed out a mouthful of blood.Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes turned bloodshot and he hugged Madame Hu in his arms, only to feel that her body had no strength, as if she had no bones. He didn\u2019t know how badly she was hurt, and then yelled at Ding Dian, \u201cAre you crazy?\u201dDing Dian blankly looked at his fist and secretly regretted it, but after hearing the question from Song Qingshu, he couldn\u2019t help but sneer,\u201dHuh, did you really think that you and that villain can conceal your plot from me. I knew about it long ago!\u201dSong Qingshu was almost dizzy, \u201cWas your brain hit by the door on the way out? I convinced Ling Tuisi to personally marry Miss Ling to you, what else do you want?\u201d\u201cYes, Brother Ding, is there any misunderstanding in this?\u201d Ling Shuanghua on the side was also dumbfounded at the current turn of events.\u201cShuanghua, you don\u2019t know this man\u2019s sinister heart. That day, when he said that he had a way to unite the two of us, I became suspicious, so I secretly followed him, and found out that all this was indeed a plot cooked up by him and your father. If I let their plan succeed. Once we are out of Jingzhou City, they will stab us in the back!\u201d Ding Dian followed Song Qingshu that day and heard their plan to backstab him and Ling Shuanghua.Song Qingshu sneered, \u201cAre you an idiot? I went into the Ling Mansion by myself and how else would I succeed if I didn\u2019t make up some lies. How else could Ling Tuisi, that old fox, be fooled by me? Besides, Ling Tuisi wants your Liancheng Swordplay Manual, but I don\u2019t care about that, so why would I need to scheme together with him?\u201dDing Dian was taken aback, and then he remembered that Song Qingshu already knew the secret of \u201cLiancheng Swordplay Manual\u201d, so he really had no motive to cooperate with Ling Tuisi. Recalling the whole thing calmly, he couldn\u2019t help but suddenly realize that he hated himself for being corrupted by Ling Tuisi. After experiencing people\u2019s tricks, he regarded all the people in the world as villains. When he saw Song Qingshu, he subconsciously classified him as having ulterior motives and judged as a villain when he found a little evidence. He didn\u2019t even consider verifying the information.When Ling Shuanghua saw her lover\u2019s expression, she realized that he had blamed the good guy, so she couldn\u2019t help but squat down to check Madam Hu\u2019s injuries. She saw her pale face and she became so angry that she couldn\u2019t help but cry out, \u201cBig Brother Ding, sister, she\u2019s going to die soon, hurry up! Find a way to save her!\u201dAt this moment Song Qingshu had already gritted his teeth, and his eyes were staring at the two of them with hatred. He also blamed himself. If it wasn\u2019t for him, then his sister-in-law would not be dying now.As he looked at Ling Shuanghua\u2019s snow-white neck with bloodshot eyes, Song Qingshu\u2019s mind went blank for a moment, and a crazy smile appeared at the corner of his lips. He quietly took out a dagger from his sleeves, and was about to slash at her pink neck as a farewell to his sister-in-law. Kill her\u2026make Ding Dian regret his whole life! As for the retaliation from Ding Dian afterwards, that was no longer important.\u201cThere is a way!\u201d Ding Dian quickly said after hearing Ling Shuanghua\u2019s voice.Song Qingshu\u2019s heart jumped, he raised his head to look at Ding Dian, his pupils slowly returning to a touch of sanity.\u201cThen why are you not hurrying to save her?\u201d Ling Shuanghua bitterly said, wondering why her Big Brother Ding suddenly became so slow-witted.Ding Dian looked hesitant, and finally spoke, \u201cI can save her with the help of the Divine Brilliance Scripture, but Madame Hu was injured very badly. I am afraid that I will need to take off my clothes, and then I will have to inject my true qi into her acupuncture points. This\u2026 between a man and woman\u2026it\u2019s not appropriate, I\u2026I\u2026\u201dLing Shuanghua flushed when she saw his anxious face. She knew that her lover was a gentleman, and he certainly didn\u2019t want to take advantage of another woman. But, if that was the only way, then it would ruin Madame Hu\u2019s reputation\u2026 so she glanced at Song Qingshu with embarrassment.When Song Qingshu heard that he could save Madame Hu\u2019s life, he was immediately ecstatic. He didn\u2019t care about anything else, he quietly put away the dagger, and quickly shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t be so muddled, hurry up and save her!\u201d Song Qingshu was from modern society, and he didn\u2019t care much about these decorums of ancient times. He wouldn\u2019t care even if\u00a0 Madame Hu had a full-body checkup!Song Qingshu then noticed that his sleeves were being pulled slightly, and when he looked down, Madame Hu opened her eyes slightly and spoke in a weak but firm tone, \u201cQingshu, forget it, I will never let other men see my body. Promise me, don\u2019t let other men touch me!\u201dWhen she saw Song Qingshu nodding hesitantly, Madame Hu smiled, her eyes began to loosen, and her mouth murmured, \u201cYou must take care of Fei\u2019er for me in the future. He will be alone. He has no father, and now there is no mother. He is really pitiful\u2026\u201dFeeling her voice getting weaker and weaker, Song Qingshu\u2019s vision gradually became hazy. When he thought that she was the first and only person in this world that showed him unconditional kindness, he couldn\u2019t contain his grief any longer, he hugged her and burst into tears.Standing aside, Ding Dian looked at Song Qingshu who was crying in front of him at a loss, with regret in his heart. Ling Shuanghua was also heartbroken, and she even began to think about whether this was her sin. It was so hard for her to finally be with her Big Brother Ding. And, such a thing happened immediately after that. Could it be that because she violated the vow of Heaven and now God was punishing them?The two suddenly noticed that the sound of crying had disappeared. After coming out of their daze, they found that Song Qingshu had slowly raised his head and he said in a chilling voice, \u201cRecite the contents of the other half of the \u201cDivine Brilliance Scripture\u201d, hurry up!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you want to learn it in a moment, it is absolutely impossible.\u201d\u201cI told you to just recite it, why are you spouting so much nonsense, hurry up and speak!\u201d Song Qingshu said coldly.Ding Dian saw his crazed look and realized that talking would not help the situation, and he was the one that hurt them first. Out of guilt, Ding Dian began to recite the remaining part of the Divine Brilliance Scripture, \u201cThe heaven is vast, and the beginning of everything. The earth begets Yin in Yin; those who are fostered by the earth beget Yang in Yin\u2026\u201dAs Ding Dian recited faster and faster, Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes started to brighten. When Ding Dian finished the last sentence, Song Qingshu waved his hand, \u201cYou two, get out!\u201d\u201cHow is this possible!\u201d When Ding Dian went out, he couldn\u2019t help but look back again and again. Song Qingshu clearly had broken meridians before. But when he finished listening to the \u201cDivine Brilliance Scripture\u201d, the light in his eyes changed, and the elementary true Qi of the \u201cDivine Brilliance Scripture\u201d could be clearly felt from his aura.\u201cI must be going crazy!\u201d Ding Dian vigorously pinched his thigh, and the pain that came from that let him know that he was not dreaming. However, he was quite proud of his talent in martial arts. Even without any guidance from his master, he comprehended the scripture on his own, and he did it in only five years. But, never in his wildest dreams did he expect to encounter something more freakish this time around. That guy just listened to him reciting the scripture. And suddenly he comprehended it all. What\u2019s more, he did that with crippled meridians!\u201cIt seems that this is just like a game!\u201d Inside the house Song Qingshu felt that his meridians were all healed, his body was full of energy, and he could only smile bitterly. He could practice martial arts by only listening to its techniques. Song Qingshu thought hard about it. He had only seen this type of thing in the game from his previous life. When the \u2018Players\u2019 obtained a certain technique, as long as they cleared the necessary conditions, with just a click, their martial arts would be at max level in an instant.Even after waiting for a while, there was still no cold system NPC\u2019s voice in his ear. Song Qingshu looked at the beautiful woman in his arms and smiled, \u201cWhether this is a game or not, I am real and my sister-in-law is real. That is enough.\u201dAs a well-informed earthling, he had been observing this chaotic world ever since his transmigration. Song Qingshu had always been skeptical of everything and secretly made several speculations. Among them, the most believable one was that he was caught by scientists after his car accident. They took him back to their lab and did a secret experiment. His thoughts were manipulated by technologies similar to virtual reality and put into this designed game world.Actually, Song Qingshu was thinking too much. The universe was so vast and the earth\u2019s scientific system was only a drop in the ocean. It couldn\u2019t explain many wonderful phenomena at all. Unfortunately or fortunately, transmigration was one of them, and how this familiar and chaotic world came into being. It was definitely one of them.Because Song Qingshu\u2019s soul went through a transmigration, his soul power was several times stronger than that of the natives of this world. Don\u2019t underestimate this gap of several times. It brings a qualitative difference. It takes several years for others to learn something, but he could instantly learn things just by listening due to that qualitative difference.\u201cSister-in-law, forgive my offense.\u201d He had promised not to let other men touch her, but he himself was not another man. When she was injured, he had touched everything that should or shouldn\u2019t be touched. Song Qingshu silently apologized, and gently unbuttoned her dress.Madame Hu originally felt her body getting colder and lighter, drifting slowly in the endless darkness\u2026 Suddenly a light appeared in the sky, and the sun slowly came out.When the sun shined on her body, Madame Hu felt warm, full of energy, and she thought to herself, \u2018Where am I?\u2019Madame Hu slowly opened her eyes, and her mind slowly recovered. Suddenly, her face paled and she realized that there wasn\u2019t even thread on her body. At this time, Song Qingshu\u2019s voice came over from behind her, \u201cSister-in-law, don\u2019t be excited. I am healing you, your injury is too serious, don\u2019t ruin all my efforts.\u201dMadame Hu sighed in her heart, \u2018He really is my bane. It wasn\u2019t enough when I was touched by him last time. But, this time\u2026there is nothing left\u2026\u201dFeeling the heat coming from the palm on her chest, Madame Hu\u2019s heart trembled, she bit her silver white teeth, and closed her eyes in resignation.After a night of treatment, Song Qingshu finally pulled Madame Hu back from the death\u2019s gate. When the two opened the gate of the ruined temple, they were greeted by Ling Shuanghua\u2019s kind smile and Ding Dian\u2019s stunned expression.Ding Dian didn\u2019t have the time to notice the blushing Madame Hu. Instead, he pulled Song Qingshu over to the side to ask questions. After knowing that Song Qingshu had really learned the entire \u201cDivine Brilliance Scripture\u201d, he looked at him with a complicated expression for a good while, \u201cI\u2019m hesitant to take advantage of you. I won\u2019t fight you during your growth period\u2026\u201dSong Qingshu was shocked. After one night of treatment, his true Qi was completely exhausted at this time, and he had no energy to fight back.Ling Shuanghua grinned and scolded him, \u201cBig Brother Ding, don\u2019t scare Master Song. If you weren\u2019t so reckless last night, there wouldn\u2019t have been so many incidents.\u201dDing Dian awkwardly smiled, and bowed while holding his fist, \u201cBrother Song, last night, I harmed the hand that fed me. I returned enmity instead of gratitude and caused\u2026Miss Hu to almost die. I am here to make amends with you \u201dHe didn\u2019t know Madame Hu\u2019s original surname, and only knew that they greeted each other as in-laws. But, after seeing the intimacy between them, and then thinking that Song Qinghsu would have to take off his clothes while healing. Ding Dian\u2019s expression turned weird and he changed it to Miss Hu in a hurry.In his mind, Song Qingshu had stabbed this man\u2019s heart with thousands of swords yesterday, but fortunately, in the end, Madame Hu was safe, and he got a miraculous technique which healed his meridians. When everything was all right, this guy seemed more pleasing to his eyes and he quickly helped him up.All night, it seemed like a lot happened in such a short time, and the four people sighed. After a period of greetings, when Ding Dian and Ling Shuanghua saw that Madam Hu was all right, they took their leave.During this period, Song Qingshu hesitated whether to remind them not to return to Jingzhou again. Then he saw Madam Hu\u2019s weak expression, and suddenly felt cruel, \u2018I will leave it to fate. If you run back to Jingzhou again and are killed by Ling Tuisi, then you deserve it too! Who made you hurt my sister-in-law?\u2019Only two people were left alone in silence. Madame Hu was feeling quite uncomfortable, and neither of them knew how to break this calm.Song Qingshu, a modern person, didn\u2019t care about what happened last night, but he was afraid that Madame Hu\u2019s skin was too thin and it would be bad if he accidentally irritated her.In the end, it was Madam Hu who couldn\u2019t bear this ambiguous silence, and she opened her mouth to ask, \u201cHow did you make Ling Tuisi agree to the marriage of the two that day?\u201dSong Qingshu almost laughed when he heard it. He didn\u2019t expect that she would hold on to such an irrelevant question for so long, but he forced down his smile and explained, \u201cI used the \u2018Nine Yin Scripture\u2019 when I was alone with Ling Tuisi. The Bewitching Technique hypnotized him, and when he heard the specific instructions from me, he would say every word according to what I taught him.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because of his broken meridians, he was unable to practice anything even though he was sitting on treasures like the Nine Yin Scripture. He was unwilling to give up, and tried to study the scriptures over and over again. Finally, he was delighted to discover that the cultivation of the Bewitching Technique did not require the circulation of internal energy at all, and was completely dependent on spiritual energy. It was at that time, Song Qingshu knew that as long as the cultivation conditions were met, he might be able to learn martial arts instantly.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it, you just don\u2019t want to tell me the truth.\u201d Madame Hu\u2019s voice became extremely delicate.\u201cThen do you want to try experiencing it?\u201d Song Qingshu felt that his heartbeat suddenly sped up, and he stared at her without blinking.Madame Hu glanced at him, her heart swayed under his scorching gaze, and she replied in a mysterious manner, \u201cTry it, if you can.\u201d\u201cSister-in-law, look into my eyes\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t be polite anymore when he got the approval of the beautiful lady.When Madame Hu\u2019s eyes came into contact with his, she suddenly felt trapped in a huge whirlpool, and she began to lose control over her mind.\u201cSister-in-law, come and hug me.\u201d Although he could do so much more, Song Qingshu was still sensible and did not dare to give any radical instructions.\u201cYes~\u201d Madame Hu spoke in an unusually charming voice, and she walked over step by step, stretched out her jade white arms, hugged Song Qingshu tightly, and gently leaned her head against his chest.With the jade-like beauty in his arms, Song Qingshu thought that the gain was big enough this time, and hurriedly snapped her fingers. Madame Hu woke up to find their current situation and pushed Song Qingshu away with shame and anger.\u201cMistake, it was all a mistake!\u201d Song Qingshu explained with embarrassment, \u201cI forgot that I had just practiced a miraculous technique, and my internal strength might be a little bit higher than my sister-in-law\u2026\u201dMadame Hu sighed faintly, and looked at him with a complicated expression, \u201cQingshu, you are very skilled in the use of Bewitching Technique. It is really an evil art. If you\u2026really wanted to, I don\u2019t know how many beautiful flowers would be tarnished.\u201d\u201cSister-in-law, don\u2019t misunderstand, I\u2019m not that kind of person.\u201d Song Qingshu quickly tried to prove his innocence, \u201cMartial arts itself is not evil, only those who use martial arts have good and evil qualities. Even the righteous Guo Jing, and Huang Rong\u2019s couple uses this technique.\u201d\u201cWell, I know that you won\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d Madame Hu smiled faintly, \u201cBut you have to promise me that you can\u2019t use this method on your sister-in-law in the future.\u201d There was a wave of shame in her heart, \u2018If he really couldn\u2019t control himself, made me warm his bed, what am I going to do\u2026\u2019\u201cSister-in-law, don\u2019t worry, I will never use it on you again.\u201d Song Qingshu said with a serious expression and solemnly agreed.\u201cThen this sister-in-law, won\u2019t worry.\u201d Madame Hu smiled, and the rising sun shone on her delicate cheeks, and Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.Noting his sincere gaze, Madame Hu decided on something in her heart, \u201cQingshu, I\u2019m afraid this sister-in-law is going to leave.\u201dThose few brisk and melodious words sounded like thunder in Song Qingshu\u2019s ears, \u201cSister-in-law, I was wrong. I shouldn\u2019t have done that evil deed to tease you.\u201d\u201cIt has nothing to do with that.\u201d Madame Hu sighed faintly. \u201cI am a widow. I promised to help you find a cure for your meridians. It was necessary to travel together with you. Now your meridians have been cured, I have no reason to stay with you any longer.\u201d\u201cThen I would rather prefer my cripled meridian than curing it.\u201d Song Qingshu said in an angry manner.\u201cWhy are you getting angry\u2026\u201d Madame Hu also felt a little funny seeing him acting like a child. After hesitating, she persuaded, \u201cQingshu, during this period, for various reasons, between us\u2026 Our relationship has gotten more intimate than the average brother-in-law and sister-in-law.\u201d\u201cWe are as bright as the sun and as clear as the moon, and there is nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d Song Qingshu said anxiously.\u201cWhat if I have a guilty conscience?\u201d Madame Hu\u2019s words gave Song Qingshu a feeling of Deja vu and he was startled. \u201cWhich brother-in-law and sister-in-law have seen each other naked?\u201d The following words made both of them feel stunned, and both fell silent.\u201cQingshu, your thoughts, sister-in-law can also guess one or two points\u2026\u201d After a while, Madame Hu continued.Song Qingshu opened his mouth in a hurry, but it was gently pressed by Madame Hu with a slender finger on his lips, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, just listen to me.\u201d Song Qingshu had a thousand words to say, but it was suddenly pressed back into his belly by that slender finger.\u201cQingshu, it is impossible between us. I am a widow. You have a great future and a destined girl is waiting for you.\u201d Madame Hu\u2019s voice was still as soft and pleasant as usual, but it frightened Song Qingshu. He felt a deep fear, knowing that he might lose her forever.\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Song Qingshu roared.\u201cBut I care!\u201d Madame Hu\u2019s face became extremely calm at the moment, and she spoke word by word, \u201cI am Hu Yidao\u2019s wife, even if he dies, I will still be his wife, forever!\u201dMadame Hu had never dared to face the recent changes in her heart. This time she was alarmed by the Bewitching Technique, forcing her to make a final decision.Song Qingshu remained silent. For modern people, the status of a widow was nothing. As long as the two loved each other, everything else was not a problem. However, in this world, rituals and traditions were something that everyone valued, and he also could not ask Madame Hu to be as open-minded as himself.He had always subconsciously avoided thinking about this problem before. But now that he thought about it, even if Madame Hu agreed to be with him, the social resistance that both sides would face at that time was not something they could afford.In order to take a small advantage on that day, Song Qingshu and the dead Hu Yidao became brothers. If he finally got together with his widow, not only Madame Hu, but Song Qingshu himself would be ruined, and the two would be spurned by the world.Song Qingshu was a mature man, although sometimes impulsive, he never lacked reason, and quickly understood the reason behind Madam Hu\u2019s decision.Now he regretted very much why he had to bow his head and become sworn brothers!\u201cDo you finally understand?\u201d Madame Hu saw his expression gradually returning to calm. Although it was painful, she still hardened her heart and asked.\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu nodded with a wry smile, \u201cNow I can\u2019t even deal with minor storms, let alone shelter you from the wind and rain. But don\u2019t worry, sister-in-law, one day I will make sure that the world will be unable to oppose us. \u201c\u201cWhat nonsense~\u201d Madame Hu snorted, \u201cI don\u2019t care what you think, since you understand, then I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\u201cSister-in-law, I regret it, and I wish to use the Bewitching Technique on you again.\u201d Song Qingshu suddenly raised his head and smiled.Madame Hu was shocked and quickly closed her eyes, \u201cQingshu, what are you trying to do?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m joking with you,\u201d Song Qingshu sighed, \u201cI just think that I don\u2019t know the name of my sister-in-law even though we have been together for so long. I\u2019m really a bit regretful, and I want to ask about it through the Bewitching Technique.Madame Hu gave him an angry look, \u201cDo you know that except for the closest relatives, a woman\u2019s name is usually only told to her husband?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s smile almost caused Madame Hu to suffocate, and she gave him a blank look, \u201cI don\u2019t want to care about you.\u201d She then turned and left.After walking quite far, she turned around and saw that Song Qingshu was still staring at her, standing in the same place. Madame Hu softened her heart and put her hands to her mouth and shouted, \u201cBrother Hu called me Bing Xue\u2019er back then.\u201d Then using her movement technique she disappeared as if running away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Flower Stealing MasterCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBing Xue\u2019er?\u201d Song Qingshu muttered to himself, carving the name on his heart.He was hesitating whether to follow her and catch up. After taking a few steps, he finally took it back. What was the use of catching up?At this moment, Song Qingshu had an intense urge to become stronger. Previously, it was because of Zhou Zhiruo\u2019s pursuit and impending death. But now, he had a new reason, it was to be able to be with Bing Xue\u2019er smoothly in the future.He clearly remembered how much resistance Yang Guo and Xiao Longnu faced at the beginning. Yang Guo was almost killed by Guo Jing with a single palm strike, which caused a series of tragedies for the two of them.What was the cause of all this? It could be said that the secular social rituals killed people without seeing any blood, or it could also be said that Yang Guo\u2019s early strength was insufficient.Later, when Yang Guo became almost invincible in the world. He used the Jade Maiden Swordplay and alongside with Xiao Longnu he fought and forced the King of Jin dynasty into an embarrassing defeat. Who would dare to criticise the two of them after that? Did Guo Jing and Huang Rong dare to use social norms as an excuse to attack them again?Song Qingshu didn\u2019t want to repeat the same mistakes of Yang Guo and Xiao Longnu. He knew that Madam Hu would either go to the King of Venoms to find Hu Fei or go back to Liaodong Villa. It would not be difficult for him to find her. Instead, the top priority for him right now was to strengthen himself.Coming to a big rock on the top of a nearby mountain, Song Qingshu sat cross-legged and meditated on some martial arts he remembered. Although his meridians were all broken, he deliberately wrote down many skills like the \u201cNine Yin Scripture\u201d, \u201cEighteen Dragon Subduing Palms\u201d, \u201cDragon Slaughtering Heavenly Sword\u201d, \u201cDragon Capturing Hand\u201d, \u201cPalm of Infinity Web\u201d and more. He didn\u2019t expect it to be really useful now. After half a day, when Song Qingshu opened his eyes, his internal energy became thick and strong again.Although he had learned the Nine Yin Scriptures and the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms in a short period of time, Song Qingshu was a little bit unhappy. His ability to practice martial arts techniques in an instant was indeed heaven defying. But now he discovered that what the ability brought him was only the ability to practice it.A martial arts technique is a thing that has to be compatible with the practitioner. Only the proper synergy between the temperament of the martial artist and the style of martial arts can bring out the maximum power of martial arts.For example, Song Qingshu now could perform both the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms and the Nine Yin White Bone Claw, but these two martial arts were not very compatible with his own temperament. Therefore, while performing the same Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms, Song Qingshu\u2019s power would be far inferior to those of Qiao Feng and Guo Jing. And it was the same for the Nine Yin White Bone Claw, Song Qingshu\u2019s power would not be as powerful as Zhou Zhiruo and Mei Chaofeng.There were many martial arts techniques in the Nine Yin Scripture such as the Nine Yin White Bone Claw, the White Boa Whip Skill, the Heart Shattering Palm\u2026Wasn\u2019t there anything that matched the temperament of Song Qingshu? Of course there was, it was the great Bewitching Technique.Song Qingshu\u2019s expression turned a little weird. How could he be so compatible with that particular martial arts technique? Could it be that his temperament really was that much flowery? Did he really have the destiny of a womanizer?Now, he was really confident when it came to that particular technique. He was pretty sure that no one else in the world had cultivated it more profoundly than him. Even if it was Guo Jing and Huang Rong, who practiced the same technique. If he caught them unprepared, they would be controlled by him, mind and soul.In addition to the matter of compatibility with martial arts, Song Qingshu still had a big problem, that was, he had too little actual combat experience. Although he knew every move, he had to choose which one was more appropriate to parry in the face of an enemy attack, and then which one he should use next as a counterattack. All of this made him really confused.\u201cWang Yuyan and I are two extreme existences,\u201d Song Qingshu spoke to himself with a wry smile, \u201cShe has a vast amount of experience, but she doesn\u2019t know how to practice martial arts. I know how to practice martial arts, but my experience is way too low.\u201d\u201cI will create my own path, anyway, martial arts fighting will ultimately rely on speed and strength, and I will work harder on this to come up with some clever tricks! That\u2019ll be fun, haha~\u201d Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but raise his head towards the sky and laugh out loud for having such a great idea.On the way down the mountain, Song Qingshu practised the Divine Brilliance Scripture for a while, and the Nine Yin Scripture for another while, and finally his complexion became more and more ugly. One of the two internal strengths was of the strong yang element, and the other belonged to the gentle yin element. They were completely incompatible. If he didn\u2019t want to explode and die at the end, he could only choose one martial art to practice.\u201cDamn!\u201d Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but curse out loud. The two internal arts had their own advantages, and it was really difficult to choose between them.After struggling for half a day, he finally gave up thinking, and temporarily let go of the two kinds of techniques. Anyway, he won\u2019t reach any critical points for a while.While walking down the mountain, he was actually thinking about where to go next. By the time he reached the foot of the mountain, Song Qingshu had made a decision in his heart. He would first go to the \u201cBoundless Jade Cave\u201d he had seen in a post on the forum in his previous life.Now that he was certain about his ability to learn at a glance like a game bug, it would be really a waste of God\u2019s gift if he didn\u2019t sweep the world of martial arts.The \u201cNorthern Darkness Divine Scriptures\u201d in the Boundless Jade Cave would be just one of many. After all, Song Qing\u2019s body had the Divine Brilliance Scripture and Nine Yin Scripture, and his internal energy was already very strong. The \u201cNorthern Darkness Divine Scripture\u201d needed one to empty one\u2019s body first, so it had little to no use for him. The \u201cMinute Ice Ripple Step\u201d, however, was different, it was the best choice to save one\u2019s life.If he wanted to live in this violent world, Song Qingshu had to be extremely cautious, no matter how many life-saving skills he had, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough.The more he thought about it, the more excited he became, and Song Qingshu immediately embarked on the road to Dali. Along the way, he kept thinking that there were so many martial arts secrets in the world just waiting for him to go and find them one by one. There was the Kunlun Mountains \u201cNine Yang Divine Art\u201d, \u201cTomb of Swords\u201d, Mount Hua\u2019s \u201cThinking Over the Cliff\u201d, \u201cNine Swords of Dugu\u201d, \u201cGolden Snake Scripture\u201d of Golden Snake Cave, Fujian\u2019s Demon Vanquishing Sword Art\u2026ah, yeah, he couldn\u2019t even count them all!While he thought about all this, Song Qingshu\u2019s sad mood due to the departure of Bing Xue\u2019er gradually became brighter.Traveling all the way through the mountains, rivers and deep into the barren land, he finally found out the location of the Limitless Sword Sect. Although Song Qingshu knew that the Boundless Jade Cave was near the Limitless Sword Sect, he didn\u2019t know the specific location, so he had to use that piece of jade as a clue and searched around.It took more than half a month to finally find the Boundless Jade Cave, \u201cSister Goddess, I\u2019m coming~\u201d Song Qingshu happily ran in. At this time, if someone else heard his hungry and thirsty voice, they wouldn\u2019t know what to think.When he saw the jade statue from a distance, it really looked like a living person. The light yellow silk dress on her body trembled slightly. Her pair of eyes were shining brightly, and the texture of the white jade also revealed a faint red color, which was similar to the skin of real humans. There was virtually no difference.Staring at those deep dark eyes, Song Qingshu felt as if it actually had a heartbeat, \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that dumb Duan Yu was captivated by this, and couldn\u2019t let it go.\u201dThinking of the purpose of his trip, Song Qingshu didn\u2019t have the time to appreciate any beauty. He hurriedly picked up the skirt of the jade statue and carefully looked down.When he finally found the mat, Song Qingshu noticed a hole on it and his expression turned a little ugly. He stretched out his hand to dig in the hole for a while, and finally gave up after he found nothing.It seemed that Duan Yu in this world had already made his first appearance. He had already noticed that the plot flow of this world was somewhat different from the original. But, Song Qingshu still hoped for the best, in case Duan Yu hasn\u2019t come here yet. Now it seemed that everything was just his pipe dream.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This Duan Yu, on the other hand, likes to eat the plate clean. So stingy!\u201d Song Qing slandered, and thinking about Zhang Wuji, his mood got even worse.\u201cI seem to remember that there was a drawing of the naked sister Goddess in the scroll, demonstrating the direction of each acupuncture point.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s lips suddenly revealed a smile of understanding when he thought of that possibility. They were men, and they all had the tendency to monopolise the things they liked when they got them. That Duan Yu probably couldn\u2019t bear to leave it here for other people to watch.Now that Duan Yu had learned \u201cNorthern Darkness Divine Scripture\u201d and \u201cMinute Ice Ripple Step\u201d, Song Quingshu didn\u2019t know if he had also learned the Six Meridian Divine Sword. Song Qingshu was unwilling to run all the way there in vain. But in the end he still followed his plan to go to Heavenly Dragon Monastery.The Bone Forging Chapter of the \u201cNine Yin Scripture\u201d allowed people to practice internal strength much faster than ordinary people. Now that Song Qingshu was equipped with the \u201cNine Yin Scripture\u201d and \u201cDivine Brilliance Scripture\u201d, he thought that his internal strength should be enough to use the Six Meridian Divine Sword.There were many followers of Buddhism in Dali, and when they heard that he was going to Heavenly Dragon Monastery, they were eager to show the way. When Song Qingshu finally arrived outside the Heavenly Dragon Monastery, the sky was already dark.\u201cThese days, the various schools of martial arts are very self-conscious. This \u201cSix Meridian Divine Sword\u201d is not even passed on to any normal disciples. It would be impossible if I wanted to borrow it.\u201d Song Qingshu thought for a while. He wasn\u2019t some righteous gentleman. So, he didn\u2019t have the psychological aversion to stealing. Anyway, he wasn\u2019t exactly going to steal it. He just wanted to read it once. Could that be counted as stealing?He walked around the outer wall of the Heavenly Dragon Monastery, looked for a secluded place, and with a light leap, Song Qingshu silently landed inside. He hid his tracks all the way as he searched, passing by Qingdu Yaotai, Wu Tian Jing, and Sanyuan Palace. He also passed by the Dusita Academy, Yuhua Academy, Prajna Terrace, and finally came before a few pine huts. The feeling of magnificence and splendor along the way felt very different to Song Qingshu. And he thought in his heart, \u2018I bet that this is the place where they keep all the books.\u2019As he cautiously jumped to the roof and gently uncovered a tile, Song Qingshu\u2019s brows suddenly wrinkled.There were six monks in the hut sitting on the mats in a circle. They all had a calm expression and long breathing.\u2018It won\u2019t be easy now.\u2019 Song Qingshu unconsciously sighed. \u2018The Six Monks of the Heavenly Dragon Monastery are all here, and even if Jiumozhi himself came here, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything. I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s even more impossible for me.\u2019\u201cSince you are already here, why don\u2019t you show yourself for us to see?\u201d The monk inside the hut facing the wall spoke up, raised his thumb, and a scorching sword qi rushed towards Song Qingshu. This sudden attack shocked Song Qingshu and he lost the support under his feet. The roof broke as a result, then he spun around a few times and landed safely into the hut.\u201cI have committed a great offense by visiting your temple late at night, and I hope a few seniors will have a forgiving mind.\u201d After Song Qingshufu landed, he respectfully bowed.The monks in the room had already opened their eyes and looked at him with interest. Zen Master Kurong was still facing the wall and sneered, \u201cEven though your words are respectful, your deeds are devious. May we know the reason behind your late night visit.\u201dSong Qingshu hesitated a little. It seemed that there was no hope of quietly taking the manual. So, he decided to imitate Jiumozhi, and made up some nonsense, \u201cThis humble one heard that the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019 of Heavenly Dragon Monastery is the world\u2019s number one sword technique. But, by chance this junior had the good fortune of witnessing Senior Feng Qingyang\u2019s \u2018Nine Swords of Dugu\u2019 before. It truly was a good fortune and I really can\u2019t imagine that there is a more powerful sword technique than the \u2018Nine Swords of Dugu\u2019. I came to Heavenly Dragon Monastery this time to see the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019 with my own eyes. I wanted to compare it with the \u2018Nine Swords of Dugu\u2019 in my memory to see which is the best sword art in the world.\u201dSeveral monks in the hut heard his words and began to discuss the Sword Sage of the Mount Hua Sect. He had a clear reputation and was famous in the Wulin. He was known as the world\u2019s number one swordsman. The monks here have been fascinated by his \u2018Nine Swords of Dugu\u2019 for a long time. Today when they heard Song Qingshu mention it. Many people began to think.Kurong remained motionless, and spoke with a hoarse and cold voice, \u201cYour Excellency wants to see the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019, then why do you need to read the sword manual? This poor monk, although low in martial arts, can also perform the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019.\u201dIt seemed that Jiumozhi had already paid a visit to the Heavenly Dragon Monastery. Song Qingshu sighed in his heart. He was still behind the plot this time. The monks secretly stood in the field, surrounded themselves in the center, and hurriedly smiled bitterly. \u201cDuan Yu has already visited your Heavenly Dragon Monastery, and the rumor that the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019 manual was burned is true. Although there were many misunderstandings during my visit, there were no evil intentions. The Senior Monks should exercise compassion and let this junior leave peacefully.\u201dEveryone in the hut looked at each other, and felt uncertain in their hearts. How did he know such a secret? The former king of Dali, Benchen was worried about the safety of his nephew Duan Yu, and anxiously said, \u201cSince you know such a secret thing so clearly, we must not let you come into contact with Kumozhi, so please stay.\u201d After talking he stretched out his ring finger, and scorching sword qi shot out.At the moment Song Qingshu wanted to slap himself for having such a big mouth. All he had to do was to pretend and follow the plot. But no, he just had to open his mouth and create trouble!Although he was upset in his heart, his reaction was not slow, and he dodged the sword qi with swift movement. Seeing that Benchen had attacked, the other monks in the hut also joined him. For a time, the hut was full of scattered sword qi flying around in every direction, and the sound was like wind and thunder in the stormy sky.Song Qingshu was forced to be in an embarrassing situation. Although the strike of the \u201cSix Meridians Divine Sword\u201d was invisible, it was fortunate that it could be predicted by observing the motion of the fingers of the attackers.The sword qi always followed a straight line. Song Qingshu noticed the angle of each person\u2019s finger when they used the sword qi, and he could roughly guess where the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019 attack would shoot from. So, even though he was embarrassingly rolling on the ground, it was still a surprise to the attackers. He secretly thanked his junior high school physics teacher.\u201cGood form!\u201d The Senior Monk Kurong, who had not yet attacked, gave a compliment. Then he raised his fingers, and \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019 qi immediately appeared.The cultivation base of Senior Monk Kurong was indeed a lot higher than the other five monks. Although the other five monks were attacking with sword qi, they couldn\u2019t really hurt Song Qingshu, who was performing the \u201cSlithering Snake Jumping Raccoon Technique\u201d from the Nine Yin Scripture. Although Kurong still didn\u2019t look back, the two sword qi\u2019s he sent pinpointed the gap when Song Qingshu\u2019s body changed shape while dodging.Because he had to dodge the sword qi of the other five monks, Song Qingshu\u2019s angle of movement on the ground was blocked by the two sword qi from Kurong. So he had no choice but to venture into the air.Kurong smiled slightly. He had been expecting this when he attacked with those two sword qi. At the moment, Song Qingshu was in the air, and there was no room to change his angle. So, he would be severely injured and captured with a single sword qi from Kurong.Song Qingshu\u2019s expression became dignified, he did panic for a moment but it did not confuse him. He stepped on the instep of his right foot with the tip of his left foot, and then rose a few feet out of thin air, just enough to avoid the two sword qi of Kurong. He knew that if everyone kept shooting, it would be a matter of time before he got hit by these sword qi. So, he quickly launched a counterattack.He drew a semicircle with his left hand and pushed out with the palm of his right hand. It was the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms. Kurong immediately felt a surge of vigorous aura targeting him. He had just released the sword qi and had not fully adjusted his breath. So, he did not dare to insist, and quickly got up and flashed aside. Then he looked back to see that the mat in the original place was blown away by the wind from the palm strike, and was shocked, \u201cEighteen Dragon Subduing Palms?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Flower Stealing MasterCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWith the help of the counter-shock force of his palm, Song Qingshu moved a few feet aside in mid-air. He used \u201cThe Dragon Soars in the Sky\u201d to avoid the sword aura of the five monks below him, and took advantage of the gap of their breath adjustment to use \u201cThe Proud Dragon Repents\u201d of the \u201cEighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms\u201d to counter attack. The monks hurriedly blocked it with their palms, and suffered serious internal injuries as soon as they made contact.Song Qingshu thanked his good luck inside his heart. Fortunately, these people lacked internal energy. Every time they shot a sword qi, they needed a few seconds to adjust their breath. Although they could cover for each other with a sword formation, but they werehaughty, and their individual strength was not as powerful. All five people were severely injured by the gap that he had found, but Song Qinghsu was not unscathed either. The clash disrupted his blood flow and he hurriedly adjusted his breath without letting them notice.\u201cStop!\u201d Senior Monk Kurong finally turned around, his face was the same as it was described in the book, his head was as smooth as a baby, and his expression a bit haggard, \u201cWhat an excellent mastery of the \u2018Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms\u2019, is your Excellency Master Qiao Feng (Xiao Feng)?\u201d\u201cThis lowly one has always admired the demeanor of King Xiao in the South. With my meagre skills, I wouldn\u2019t dare to compare myself with him.\u201d Song Qingshu spoke the truth. If it was Xiao Feng performing the same \u201cThe Proud Dragon Repents\u201d just now, he would have created at least three-fold waves of attack. Moreover, with the speed and strength of his palm, he would have given the monks no way out. If Xiao Feng had the same kind of opportunity, and attacked with \u201cThe Dragon Soars in the Sky\u201d, the five monks would have additional broken bones instead of just suffering a serious internal injury.\u201cThat\u2019s right, your excellency stepped up a few feet while in mid-air. It should be Wudang\u2019s unique \u2018Cloud-Ascending Ladder\u2019. And you should have used the \u2018Slithering Snake Jumping Raccoon Technique\u2019 from the legendary Nine Yin Scripture when you were dodging on the ground.\u201d Kurong spoke with a solemn expression, with his palms folded together, \u201cYour Excellency is so young, yet he has so many unique skills. That is truly rare in the world.\u201d\u201cThe Great Monk really has a wide range of knowledge.\u201d Song Qingshu said admiringly. \u201cThere is no malice in this visit. I just want to see Dali\u2019s \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019.\u201d Then he sneered in his heart. If they hadn\u2019t seen his martial arts, he might have been captured at this very moment. This was the way of the world, the weak would be humiliated, and the strong would be respected.\u201cSince your Excellency has gotten what you wanted, please take your leave.\u201d Senior Monk Kurong\u2019s expression remained calm as he sent off this uninvited guest.\u201cThe Great Monk already knows that this junior was using the \u201cNine Yin Scriptures\u201d, and you must have heard of the legend of the \u2018Nine Yin Scriptures\u2019. Don\u2019t take offence, but the status of the \u201cNine Yin Scriptures\u201d in the Wulin may be slightly higher than that of your noble Sword Manual. If the Masters are willing, then I am willing to exchange the \u2018Nine Yin Scriptures\u2019 for the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019 manual. Don\u2019t worry, I will not take it away from you. I just want to take a look at it, and fulfill a long-cherished wish. \u201d Song Qingshu spoke in a voice that was full of temptation. He was different from the martial artists of this world, he did not want to short-sightedly monopolise any particular techniques. Besides, the \u2018Nine Yin Scriptures\u2019 didn\u2019t originally belong to him, so he didn\u2019t feel any distress from exchanging it.The monks glanced at each other, and they all saw the heart\u2019s desire in each other\u2019s eyes. The \u201cNine Yin Scriptures\u201d, Shaolin School\u2019s \u201cYi Jin Jing (Tendon Refining Method)\u201d, \u201cNine Yang Divine Art\u201d, and Sun Moon Holy Cult\u2019s \u201cSunflower Manual\u201d were known as the four great martial arts manuals of the current age.In the past, the \u201cNine Yin Scriptures\u201d was the cause of much bloodshed, as martial artists of the Central Plains competed fiercely with each other to seize possession of it. In the end, after an intense competition on Mount Hua that lasted seven days, it was won by Wang Chongyang, and he took it to his Quanzhen Sect.It is said that when Jiumozhi offered to exchange his \u201cFlower Pinching Finger\u201d, \u201cPattra Finger\u201d, and \u201cThe Maha Finger\u201d, the monks showed no emotion, but now Song Qingshu\u2019s proposal had caused ripples in the heart of even the Great Monk Kurong.\u201cMaybe your Excellency is not aware of it. Recently, the \u2018Maha Cakra Vajra\u2019 Jiumozhi came here with bad intentions. This Old Monk had to burn the sword manual to prevent the sword art from being taken away. Your Excellency is probably going to be disappointed.\u201d This Great Monk practiced Buddhism for so many years, it was not for nothing, and he quickly calmed his mind, and refused to say anything more.\u201cI also know that .\u201d Song Qingshu said with a smile, not surprised, \u201cBut didn\u2019t all the monks present here also learn the sword art? I think you can easily rewrite the sword manual if you wanted to.\u201dWhen he saw that the monks were still hesitating, Song Qingshu decided to add oil to the fire, and asked, \u201cHow do you think my internal energy compares to the masters present here?\u201dOne of the abbots hesitated for a while, but he still told the truth, \u201cYour internal strength is much higher than mine. Other than the Great Master and the Grand Master, I am afraid none of us will be your match.\u201dKurong shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t need to hide this for you because this young man\u2019s internal strength is slightly better than mine.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t all the Masters think that is weird?\u201d Song Qingshu smiled, \u201cAt such a young age, my time to practice internal energy will definitely not be as good as that of everyone present. Why does my internal strength outperform all the masters now?\u201d\u201cCould it be the effect of the \u2018Nine Yin Scriptures\u2019?\u201d The monks couldn\u2019t help asking.\u201cYes, the \u2018Nine Yin Scriptures\u2019 contains a \u2018Tendons Reforging Method\u2019, which allows the learner to practice internal skills much faster than ordinary people, and that is the reason behind this junior\u2019s superior internal strength.\u201d Song Qingshu deliberately paused and looked at the faces around him. After judging the expressions of the people he continued, \u201cJust now I noticed that each of the masters here had practiced a different sword art. And I speculated that your internal strength is insufficient and it is not enough to cultivate the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019 all at once. May I know if my conjecture is correct?\u201d\u201cYes, the internal energy required to use the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019 is beyond the reach of humans, so we decided to practice each vein separately.\u201d Kurong calmly said.\u201cObviously, the full power of the \u2018Six Meridian Divine Sword\u2019 can only be fully achieved by the simultaneous use of the six meridians. Although the sword formations of the masters are exquisite, it is inevitable that they will be obscure and create gaps during each rotation. It means the opponent can take advantage of that, and can counter attack during that gap. But with the \u2018Nine Yin Scriptures\u2019, you will be able to cultivate supreme internal strength, and when the time comes to use the \u2018Six Meridian Divine Sword\u2019, it will surely be perfect. I only ask that you allow me to take look at the sword manual, and after the time it takes to burn a stick of incense, I will definitely return it to the original owner.\u201d Song Qingshu spoke earnestly, and it certainly sounded like a good proposal among the monks as well.\u201cUncle Master, since this young man is so sincere, why not let him see it for time it takes to burn a stick of incense?\u201d Abbot Bencai turned around and asked Great Monk Kurong for his opinion. The other four monks in the scene also had the same idea. Although there were many mysteries in this world. There were few people capable of memorizing things in such a short amount of time. And to remember the complex \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019 in just a stick of incense time, they were sure it was beyond the reach of humans.Kurong remained silent for a long time, and finally looked up at Song Qingshu and asked, \u201cYour Excellency is clearly a master of martial arts, and you have very few rivals in your peers. Why do you need our Dali\u2019s the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019?\u201d He actually didn\u2019t think Song Qingshu could memorize the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019 in such a short time, but he knew well enough that there was no free lunch in the world. The other party was in possession of a legendary technique such as the \u201cNine Yin Scriptures\u201d, so although it seemed impossible to learn something with just a look, he must have a way to acquire the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019.Song Qingshu gave a wry smile and sighed, \u201cNot to mention you martial arts seniors, even among the same generation, how does the Great Monk think my martial arts compare to the great King Xiao Feng of the Khitan?\u201dGreat Monk Kurong hesitated for a moment, and shook his head slightly, \u201cThe great King Xiao swept through the martial arts circle in the Central Plains and set off a bloody storm in the Wulin. He used the \u2018Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms\u2019 and dominated with one palm. Although your martial arts is good, compared to King Xiao, I am afraid that there is still a way to go.\u201d\u201cWhat about Zhang Wuji, the Ming Cult leader?\u201d When Song Qingshu said that name, he couldn\u2019t help but think of Zhou Zhiruo, his murderous wife, and he felt very upset.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Flower Stealing MasterCH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cMaster Zhang is a master of miraculous martial arts, and he is full of magnificence. At that time, he fought against the masters of the six major \u201corthodox\u201d sects, and helped to resolve the conflict between them and the Ming Cult. Your Excellency\u2019s martial arts may still be slightly lacking compared to the great master Zhang.\u201d Great Monk Kurong thought for a long time, and made his own judgment.\u201cNow, the great master knows why I still covet the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019 of your noble monastery?\u201d Song Qingshu smiled bitterly. As soon as he said this, he knew that he lost any chance of getting the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019 anymore. But at his core he was this kind of person, although sometimes he acted evil, he always had his own pride and arrogance. Sometimes he felt reluctant to be too wretched, and disdained to lie.Sure enough, when he heard his words, Kurong chanted the Buddha\u2019s name in silence, \u201cYour Excellency is straightforward and speaks frankly, it shows that you are an honest and upright person. It is just that the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019 of this monastery has never been passed on to outsiders, and this poor monk does not want to be the sinner in hundreds of years. I hope that Your Excellency will forgive me.\u201d\u201cI understand. I disturbed the masters tonight, and I hope you forgive my offence.\u201d After speaking, Song Qingshu let out a loud laugh and turned to leave.The Great Monk didn\u2019t stop him, looking at Song Qingshu\u2019s leaving figure, he thought to himself, \u2018There may be a great upheaval in the Wulin in the future.\u2019After leaving Heavenly Dragon Monastery, Song Qingshu also secretly regretted it in his heart, \u2018I already had the old monks in a corner, but why did I bother to pretend to be so righteous?\u2019But this thought was fleeting. It was impossible to turn back time, and get the \u2018Six Meridians Divine Sword\u2019. What\u2019s the use of regretting now? He secretly comforted himself with a few words, \u2018Anyway, there are so many wonderful martial arts in the world, why should I settle for only one?Thinking of this, Song Qingshu became happy again, and immediately embarked on the road of searching for other martial arts secrets.Acquiring the \u201cNorthern Darkness Divine Scripture\u201d, \u201cMinute Ice Ripple Step\u201d, and that damn \u201cSix Meridians Divine Sword\u201d ended in failure. Now he had to think about the rest of the treasures. The \u201cNine Yang Divine Scripture\u201d was hidden in the dangerous Kunlun Mountains, and it won\u2019t be easy to find it. And now that he had both the \u201cDivine Brilliance Scripture\u201d and the \u201cNine Yin Scriptures\u201d, the \u201cNine Yang Divine Scripture\u201d was of not much help to him anyways. Besides, that was Zhang Wuji\u2019s martial arts, and he felt disgusted when he thought about it. Song Qingshu quickly denied the idea of going to Kunlun Mountains.The \u201cSupreme Mysteries Scripture\u201d of the South China Sea was too illusory, and it would be foolish to go search for it in the vast sea. He was afraid that would be buried in the belly of the sea by people from the Xia Ke Island (Heroes\u2019 Island) before he even found it. He shook his head and denied that plan as well.Evil Warding Sword Art\u2026Uh, next one!It seemed that there was something called the \u201cSmall Phaseless Power\u201d in the Shishui Pavilion of Manduo Mountain Villa. But even the \u201cNine Yang Divine Art\u201d was not helpful to him. Then what would he do with a \u201cSmall Phaseless Power\u201d? It was quickly denied again.How about learning the sword technique of the Ancient Tomb Sect, the \u201cJade Maiden Swordplay\u201d? Well, to do that he had to be able to draw a circle with his left hand and a square with his right hand. Song Qingshu tried several times and looked at the two shapes on the sand that were not round nor square. No matter how intelligent he was, this seemed quite impossible to do. It seemed that the \u201cJade Maiden Swordplay\u201d could not be practiced, so let\u2019s look for something else. This twisted sword technique was not in line with his own personality and temperament anyways.White clothes like the snow, accompanied by a sword, flying immortal soaring in the sky, that was the heroic posture that all men yearned for!It seemed that the only one remaining was the \u201cTomb of Swords\u201d in the Shendiao Valley and the \u201cNine Swords of Dugu\u201d of the Mount Hua Sect. When he thought about the legendary sword art, Song Qingshu became enthusiastic and embarked on the journey overnight.Somewhere in the deep valley outside Xiangyang, Hubei. Song Qingshu looked at the pile of bird droppings with a blue face and accidentally stepped on some as well. He spit out from the severe stench, \u201cThat stupid big eagle can really let it out!\u201dWith this reference object, Song Qingshu quickly found the place where Dugu wanted to bury his bones. Looking at the pile of rocks and a few domineering words on the wall, Song Qingshu remained silent for a long time, and finally cursed out loud, \u201cMotherfu*ker! What\u2019s the use of just bragging on? You could\u2019ve written some secret skills here!\u201dWhat kind of luck did Yang Gou have to become so strong in such a short time and defeat so many powerful enemies such as Jinlun Guoshi the \u2018Golden Wheel Imperial Adviser\u2019?Searching through the sword tomb, but not finding any martial arts secrets, Song Qingshu suddenly felt a sense of frustration from being abused.\u201cA thief doesn\u2019t go empty handed, otherwise there will be more bad luck next time.\u201d Song Qingshu picked up a wooden sword and put it on his back. He suddenly thought of something and took a deep breath. \u201cIt seems that I used up all my good luck from that incident with Duan Yu that day. After she left me, I am coming out empty time and time again!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe that I won\u2019t get anything from Mount Hua!\u201d Song Qingshu sternly remarked and embarked on the road to Mount Hua.Now, let\u2019s talk about the White Horse Temple, the abode of the King of Venoms on the bank of Dongting Lake thousands of miles away. Hu Fei and Cheng Lingsu were looking at the beautiful woman in front of them with their eyes wide open, \u201cThis beautiful aunt, are you really Brother Song\u2019s wife?\u201dZhou Zhiruo\u2019s face twitched, but she still said with a smile, \u201cYes, little brother, Qingshu is indeed this auntie\u2019s husband. Because he was seriously injured, he was unwilling to drag me down. I visited Songzhou\u2019s Godly Doctor Xue of Zhoucheng and Ping Yizhi of Kaifeng. Then I heard that Qingshu appeared near this village a few days ago. Auntie thought that she finally found him. Can my younger brother and younger sister tell auntie where he went?\u201dZhou Zhiruo was searching around to find Song Qingshu all this time, and finally found his whereabouts, but she was deeply afraid of the reputation of the King of Venoms, so she did not dare to use strong words, that\u2019s why she had to cheat.\u201cHmph, I thought Big Brother Song was a gentleman, he already had a wife in his family, so why did he come to provoke my mother!\u201d Little Hu Fei snorted coldly.\u201cThat\u2019s right, when I saw his eyes staring at me, I knew he was not a good thing.\u201d Cheng Lingsu clapped her hands and said in agreement.\u201cThen can you tell Auntie where he went?\u201d For some reason, Zhou Zhiruo couldn\u2019t help but feel happy when she heard the two children scold Song Qingshu.\u201cHe\u2026he heard my Master say that the Millennium Ginseng can revive even dead bones, then he stupidly ran to Changbai Mountain to dig for ginseng.\u201d Hu Fei said with a smile.Cheng Lingsu\u2019s eyes lit up, and she spoke in perfect cooperation, \u201cMy master said at the time that Millennium Ginseng only exists in the legend, so as to not let him have a false hope. But, after hearing this, he rushed to the northeast overnight.\u201dAfter discovering Song Qingshu\u2019s whereabouts, Zhou Zhiruo was overjoyed, and quickly thanked the two children, stepped on the horse beside her, and hurried to the northeast. She imagined in her heart that after she finds Song Qingshu, he must be tortured to death.After Zhou Zhiruo had gone far enough, Cheng Lingsu looked back at Hu Fei with a smile but not a smile, \u201cBrother Hu Fei, why did you lie to that woman?\u201dLittle Hu Fei put his hands behind his back, pretending to look like an adult, \u201cShe thought we were children and cheated. Although she kept saying that she was Brother Song\u2019s wife, the hatred in her heart could not be hidden from my eyes. So, how dare I really tell her Brother Song\u2019s whereabouts.\u201dOut of a woman\u2019s sympathy, Cheng Lingsu frowned and asked, \u201cWhat if what she said is true, what if Uncle Song was the one in the wrong, and she just wants revenge?\u201dHu Fei chuckled, \u201cWho made Brother Song and my mother be together? If this woman really has malicious thoughts, my mother would be in danger, so I must protect Brother Song. What would I do if a fight breaks out and it hurts my mother? It\u2019s better to have one less problem, so I might as well lie to her and lead her to go to the completely opposite northeast, hehe\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother Hu Fei, you have gone astray.\u201d Cheng Lingsu sullenly smiled.\u201cUh\u2026didn\u2019t I learn it all from you?\u201dOur poor leader of Emei was fooled by two little kids and was travelling to the snowy land in the northeast.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s first look for the \u2018Golden Serpent Secret Manual\u2019 in Mount Hua. The \u201cGolden Serpent Gentleman\u201d Xia Xueyi is a character I admire very much, he is much more likable than Yuan Chengzhi.\u201d Song Qingshu muttered to himself.But Mount Hua was very vast. Was it really so easy to find the Golden Serpent Cave?Song Qingshu racked his brains to recall the plot of the original book, but still couldn\u2019t remember where the Golden Serpent Cave was located.\u201cYuan Chengzhi was studying sword art at Chaoyang Peak in Mount Hua. The Golden Serpent Cave was discovered nearby by his pet orangutan. So according to that, the Golden Serpent Cave should be near Chaoyang Peak.\u201d Song Qingshu paced back and forth while arranging his thoughts. \u201cHowever, after the internal conflict of the Mount Hua Sect, it was divided into two factions, the Sword faction and the Qi faction. The Qi faction was headed by Yue Buqun and he basically took over the sect. After they were exiled, many Sword faction masters gathered at Chaoyang Peak. From the beginning, they also called themselves a part of the Quanzhen School. This Chaoyang Peak became the site of the Mount Hua Sect\u2019s Sword faction, and they had many masters. The \u201cGolden Serpent Gentleman\u201d had many issues with them. Thus, It is impossible for the cave to be too close to Chaoyang Peak.\u201dIn the next few days, Song Qingshu centered on Chaoyang Peak and began to search outside ten miles away, paying attention to any straight cliffs. He now had powerful internal strength, and with the \u201cCloud-Ascending Ladder\u201d of Wudang he became even better at jumping up and down. Song Qingshu leapt back and forth between the mountain walls. All that leaping, although thrilling, was also very dangerous.\u201cWow haha, I finally found it!\u201d After a few days, a burst of exaggerated laughter echoed in the mountains. Song Qingshu looked at the secret cave in front of him and touched his chin, his expression was quite triumphant, \u201cThe Binary search algorithm that our company\u2019s software engineer told me is quite efficient. I am also quite talented, and I still remember when he just mentioned it casually.\u201dBut when he got into the cave and found an already buried tomb. There was a stone tablet on it, which read \u201cThe Tomb of \u201cGolden Serpent Gentleman\u201d Xia Xueyi, Yuan Chengzhi and Xia Qingqing pays their respects\u201d, and he couldn\u2019t laugh anymore.I am late again. Song Qingshu sullenly sat on the ground, and didn\u2019t even have the thought of looking around. He knew that \u201cGolden Serpent Gentleman\u201d left a highly poisonous fake secret manual, and now Yuan Chengzhi has obviously taken away the real secret manual. Then what was there left for him to find there anymore?\u201cSometimes things have to be fated, and follow the flow of fate. Being forceful just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Song Qingshu turned around and looked at the tomb of \u201cGolden Serpent Gentleman\u201d reluctantly. He sighed and came to the entrance of the cave. He leaped up and finally stood on the edge of the cliff. He climbed on a big tree, found a sturdy branch to lie down on, rested his hands behind his head, and stared at the white clouds in the blue sky in a daze.\u201cI am so stupid and naive.\u201d Song Qingshu laughed at himself. \u201cThese treasured secrets were originally arranged by fate for the original protagonist, but I foolishly wished to compete with the original protagonist for luck. The reality is too cruel, and life is so hard.\u201dAt this time Song Qingshu finally understood that the idea of searching for hidden treasures in the world was unrealistic. Although destiny was an illusory thing, you can choose to not believe it, but you also can\u2019t attempt to control or challenge it either.\u201cI hope I won\u2019t become a villain destined to be a stepping stone for the protagonist.\u201d Song Qingshu felt a deep sense of powerlessness at this moment, and even felt a little at a loss about the future.\u201cYun Zhonghe, even if I have to jump off the cliff, I won\u2019t let you succeed.\u201d Suddenly an angry woman\u2019s voice came from under the tree, even if the voice was full of anger and panic, it was sublime and clear.Song Qingshu curiously looked down, and saw a curvaceous and slender girl dressed in black, stepping back to the cliff step by step. The wind on the edge of the cliff was so strong that her hair was blowing all around. She\u2026was really pretty.Opposite of the beauty was a thin middle-aged man in black clothing, holding a rotten silver crane claw, and touching two moustaches at the corners of his mouth with one hand, he looked at the girl with a smile, \u201cMu Wanqing, are you searching for you dear lover Duan Yu?\u201d He stared at Mu Wanqing\u2019s crystal clear eyes. But, sure enough, Yun Zhonghe continued to taunt, \u201cOh, I almost forgot, your lover Duan has become your brother Duan!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d After being repeatedly taunted by Yun Zhonghe, Mu Wanqing finally drew her sword and attacked in fury.Seeing that his treacherous trick had succeeded, a smug smile appeared at the corner of Yun Zhonghe\u2019s mouth, and he greeted her with his silver claw. Song Qingshu looked at that lively figure, and noticed that Mu Wanqing\u2019s swordsmanship had some foundation, but unfortunately she was still not the opponent of Yun Zhonghe nicknamed \u201cThoroughly Cruel, Utterly Evil\u201d. In addition, Yun Zhonghe was holding back in his moves, and he continued to attack some hidden places of the girl. All this was making her angry to the extreme, and she was being restrained by his every move.Song Qingshu finally got to see her face clearly. Her face was beautiful and unblemished, like a crescent moon, like a flower covered with snow. Especially her small and delicate chin, with the slim and delicate cherry lips, her beauty was beyond words.\u201cIs Duan Yu a fool? Mu Wanqing\u2019s appearance is no worse than that of Wang Yuyan!\u201d This was Song Qingshu\u2019s first reaction after seeing her appearance.Then the thought of the fact that he was stained with bad luck ever since reaching the Boundless Jade Cave. Song Qingshu got an idea about how to get back at Duan Yu, and produced a wicked smile on the corner of his lips, \u201cThen I shall tease your lover to relieve the hatred in my heart!\u201dOn the ground, Yun Zhonghe\u2019s heart became more and more excited. He realized that Mu Wanqing was about to be captured, and after that he was allowed to do whatever he wanted. And, when he thought that he had never touched such a beautiful woman in his life, his heart suddenly became hot.\u201cWho is making so much noise? You\u2019re disturbing my beauty sleep.\u201d Suddenly the sound coming from the tree made the two of them startled. When they looked up, they saw a ragged, messy-haired farmer boy sitting on a branch. He was stretching up his lazy waist, and his sleepy eyes looked like he had just been awakened.\u201cSmelly boy, go away, don\u2019t disturb this uncle\u2019s good deed.\u201d Yun Zhonghe was terribly annoyed. It turned out that during this period, Song Qingshu had been eating and sleeping on the road, and his clothes had become very dirty and messy. What\u2019s more, the weather has been getting a lot hot recently. Song Qingshu was used to air conditioning in his previous life. How could he stand this extreme heat? So, he also unconsciously rolled up his trousers, and now he looked like a young woodcutter from the countryside.Song Qingshu pretended to stare at Yun Zhonghe in a dazed manner, and exclaimed, \u201cSo you are Jin Yong\u2019s cousin.\u201d\u201cWho is Jin Yong?\u201d Yun Zhonghe was confused, but he hadn\u2019t noticed the existence of other people at all just now, and he was here for a while too! So, he couldn\u2019t figure out the identity of this weird boy.And, he certainly didn\u2019t know that Yun Zhonghe was the pen name of Jin Yong\u2019s cousin Xu Zhimo. Reminiscing about Xu Zhimo\u2019s unfortunate behavior in his previous life, Song Qingshu secretly praised, \u201cOld man Jin has a good hand at writing!\u201d\u201cWhy do you put on a veil in broad daylight? You look weird.\u201d Mu Wanqing looked at Song Qingshu\u2019s appearance strangely.\u201cMy mother said that I was too ugly, so she covered my face ever since I was a child, and said that the first woman to unveil my veil and see my appearance, I will marry\u2026 Oh no, I will have to marry her to be my wife.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled stupidly at Mu Wanqing, and stared at her.\u201cIt turns out to be a fool.\u201d Yun Zhonghe sighed in secret.Mu Wanqing saw him staring at her, and angrily said, \u201cWhat are you looking at!\u201d\u201cSister, sister, you are so beautiful. Why don\u2019t you come and lift my veil? I will marry you as my wife.\u201d Song Qingshu said in a naive voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: The third best in the worldWhen Mu Wanqing heard his words, there was a sense of confusion and absurdity in her heart. How could this conversation be so familiar? The expression on her face turned frosty and she raised her arms, \u201cGo away, or I will shoot you with a poisoned arrow!\u201d\u201cThis sister is so fierce! I feel so scared\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu hurriedly stepped aside, muttering in his mouth, \u201cSo fierce, she\u2019s definitely not suitable to be my wife.\u201dAlthough Song Qingshu lowered his voice, he deliberately made the content of his words audible to Mu Wanqing, and she couldn\u2019t help but grit her teeth with hatred. However, thinking that there was Yun Zhonghe here, she hurriedly shifted her attention to guard against him.\u201cMu Wanqing, what\u2019s wrong with you following me? This brother is an expert at taking good care of people.\u201d Yun Zhonghe spoke with raised eyebrows, and an obscene tone.\u201cShameless!\u201d Mu Wanqing raised her hand and shot a \u201cButterfly Sleeve Arrow\u201d. Yun Zhonghe had been prepared for this for a long time, and he swiftly drew close to her.Song Qingshu on the side was shocked when he saw it. This Yun Zhonghe\u2019s martial arts was nothing to speak of, but his movement technique (Qinggong) was superb. Even if it was him who wanted to catch him, he would have to rely on endurance to win.Mu Wanqing was barely hanging on. Suddenly, her face turned pale, and she quickly swung her sword to protect herself, but Yun Zhonghe shot forward like lightning, hitting the acupuncture point on her waist with one finger. She was heartbroken when Duan Yu turned out to be her own brother. Now she was caught by Yun Zhonghe. Thinking of the incoming nightmare, she was so anxious that she fainted.\u201cWhat a great beauty, she fainted so beautifully. She\u2019s pretty even when she passed out.\u201d Yun Zhonghe rubbed his own hands together and looked at the beautiful woman lying on the ground. His saliva almost came out, \u201cShould I wake her up and do the happy deed, or just do the happy deed before waking her up?\u201d\u201cIf she wakes up, she might commit suicide, and that scenery will be terrible, but now she is like a piece of dead wood, she lacks strength.\u201d Yun Zhonghe was caught in a dilemma for a while.\u201cSigh, the reputation of all the flower thieves in the world is corrupted by a scum like you.\u201d At this time, a voice sounded next to him, which frightened Yun Zhonghe.When he looked up, he saw that the foolish boy was standing there looking at him with disdain, and Yun Zhonghe fiercely glared at him, \u201cSmelly boy, it turns out that you were pretending to be foolish and teasing this senior.\u201d\u201cPrince Duan Yu is top grade even among all the playboys. He steals the women\u2019s hearts first, then leaves after deceiving them. Those women are also willing to let him go, and in the end, he ends up with a good reputation as romantic and suave. How can he have a notorious reputation like you? Everyone will spurn you after hearing your name.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s calm expression startled Yun Zhonghe.However, his words stung Yun Zhonghe\u2019s nerves, and he angrily said, \u201cDuan Zhengchun\u2019s little brat is a dignified prince of Dali. As soon as this identity is revealed, many women would willingly throw themselves into his arms. Besides, he is good looking. His martial arts is good, and there is a lot of gold in his pockets. How can we, the common people, be compared with him?\u201d\u201cSo you are jealous?\u201d Song Qingshu raised his eyebrows, and suddenly asked with curiosity, \u201cAmong the women you harmed, did any of them look like any one of Duan Zhengchun\u2019s lovers?\u201dYun Zhonghe looked a little embarrassed, so he had to tell the truth: \u201cNo\u2026\u201d\u201cLet me tell you the truth, you never really thought about improving your own situation, but chose the evil path. You have no meat on your face, and your body is like a bamboo pole, and it\u2019s obvious that your body is hollowed out by debauchery and wine. With your notoriety, women will only look at you if they are blind.\u201d Song Qingshu curled his lips and spoke with disdain.\u201cI don\u2019t need a woman to look at me!\u201d As he woke up from his daze, Yun Zhonghe couldn\u2019t help being furious at the word aimed at him.Song Qingshu shook his head, \u201cI told you as much to make you aware of your failure in this life. I hope you will reincarnate in your next life and reflect on it.\u201dYun Zhonghe laughed twice, he waved the rotten silver crane claws and attacked. Song Qingshu turned at a superb angle on the spot, just enough to create a gap between them, and pointed a finger under his opponent\u2019s armpit.Yun Zhonghe felt his whole body go numb. He couldn\u2019t move, and was shocked, \u201cHow did you know that my weakness is under my armpit?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s beneficial to be cultured and educated. \u2018When Crane and Snake fight, look under its armpit\u2019, this is common sense.\u201d Song Qingshu calmly said, but he thanked Wang Yuyan ten thousand times in his heart. In the original novel, it was she who pointed out the weak spot of Yun Zhonghe. With this information it was easy to defeat him, and it would be impossible to capture him otherwise.Yun Zhonghe was very evil, and he had a very clever mind. With his eyes turned, he began to look for a way out, \u201cThis little brother, I heard your high opinion just now, and I noticed that you are also a fellow man on the same path. Since you have fallen in love with this beauty, I will respect your decision. Please feel free to let me go.\u201d\u201cBah! Who is the same as you?\u201d Song Qingshu viciously stepped on his foot, and he jumped up in pain, \u201cBesides, now you are under my mercy, and if I really want this girl. Why would I need your permission?\u201d\u201cYes, yes\u2026Your Excellency is a proud hero. You are majestic and handsome. Your demeanor is like the autumn wind, romantic and suave\u2026\u201d Yun Zhonghe\u2019s words made Song Qingshu irritated, and he waved his hand to stop him from continuing his flattery, \u201cNo matter what you say, it\u2019s of no use today. You cannot escape death, I will send you on your way to the afterlife and avenge the women whose lives you have ruined.\u201dYun Zhonghe panicked, but he noticed the intent in his tone and quickly said, \u201cAs long as the hero promises to let me go, I can give you my martial arts techniques.\u201d\u201cWhat will I do with your useless martial arts?\u201d Song Qingshu said with disdain.\u201cOf course, the martial art of this lowly one is not worth mentioning in the eyes of this hero.\u201d Yun Zhonghe smiled awkwardly, \u201cBut, my movement technique (Qinggong) can be ranked third among all of Wulin.\u201d His tone couldn\u2019t hide his pride.\u201cOh? Then who are the top two?\u201d Song Qingshu suddenly became interested, as he didn\u2019t have any martial arts techniques that were in the top ten in the world.\u201cThe first in terms of movement technique (Qinggong) is naturally Ming Cult\u2019s Wei Yixiao, the \u201cGreen Winged Bat King\u201d. He is actually god gifted in terms of movement technique (Qinggong).\u201d Yun Zhonghe said with admiration, \u201cAs for the title second best in movement technique (Qinggong), that goes to Dongfang Bubai of the Sun Moon Holy Cult, that ghostly abnormality should also far exceed me.\u201d Yun Zhonghe\u2019s tone was full of dread.\u201cAnd the third is you?\u201d Song Qingshu sneered, \u201cDo you feel no shame?\u201dYun Zhonghe awkwardly smiled, \u201cThe hero is wise, there are indeed many people in the world who are not weaker than me, but there is no one notably better than me. So, I can only shamelessly claim to be the third.\u201d Noticing that Song Qingshu still showed no interest. He panicked and hurriedly added, \u201cThis lowly one and Wei Yixiao\u2019s movement technique (Qinggong) have the same origin. I am only inferior due to aptitude and internal strength issues, so I can\u2019t achieve the same great results.\u201d\u201cOh? What\u2019s the name of the movement technique (Qinggong)?\u201d Song Qingshu was really excited now.\u201cTraceless Sand Treading Steps!\u201d Finally seeing him show interest, Yun Zhonghe hurriedly repiled, \u201cAs long as Young Hero lets this villain go, this villain promises to repent and never harm any good women again.\u201d\u201cOkay! Tell me the movement technique\u2019s (Qinggong) formula. After I check it, I will naturally let you go.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s heart was pounding at this moment. It would be great if he learned the \u201cTraceless Sand Treading Steps\u201d. It was really not much weaker than the \u201cMinute Ice Ripple Step\u201d.When he saw that his opponent promised so easily, Yun Zhonghe began to doubt in his heart and he sneered, \u201cIf I tell the movement technique\u2019s (Qinggong) formula, and then the Young Hero decides to kill me. Then I won\u2019t have any chance to regret.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: A sweet smile\u201cAlthough I usually disregard the rules of etiquette, but, I am a man of my words.\u201d Song Qingshu saw that Yun Zhonghe didn\u2019t believe his words, so he had to say, \u201cI can take a poisonous oath, but you must also take a poisonous oath. If you harm women in the future\u2026\u201dAt the moment, Yun Zhonghe was under his knife, like a fish ready to be chopped up, so he couldn\u2019t find any other way out. He nodded and agreed. After listening to Song Qingshu\u2019s poisonous oath, he also swore a poisonous oath, \u201cIf I continue to harm any good women in the future, I will be struck by heavenly lightning to death in the future.\u201d But he sneered in his heart, the heavenly lightning? Was there such a way of death in the world?Song Qingshu noticed the tricks in his oath, and didn\u2019t care, because he knew that in all of Jin Yong\u2019s martial arts novels, there was an iron rule, that was, the violation of the oath would be punished in the end. Since Yun Zhonghe made the oath of heavenly lightning, if he does evil in the future, it would be hard to escape the eyes of the heavenly lightning.The two made their vows, and Yun Zhonghe hesitated for a while and then said the formula of Traceless Sand Treading Steps,\u201dThe one who scatters, the emissary of the divine. To utilize and harness its power, one must follow the instance between the moments\u2026\u201dAs he listened to it, Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes started to brighten. When Yun Zhonghe finished speaking the last word, Song Qingshu felt that his body suddenly became much lighter. He looked at the mountain slopes dozens of meters away from the cliff. His heart moved, and he kicked the ground with his feet. He leaped out like a sharp sword, by the time Yun Zhonghe blinked his eyes, Song Qingshu had reached the opposite mountain slope. Then he turned around, and with a light tap of the toe, quickly flew back like lightning.\u201cAre you a man or a ghost!\u201d Yun Zhonghe looked at Song Qingshu in horror. How could he have thought that this guy would be able to learn the \u201cTraceless Sand Treading Steps\u201d so quickly. And his movement technique (Qinggong) also greatly surpassed his own!\u201cWell, I\u2019m in a good mood this time, so I will let you live.\u201d Song Qingshu unsealed Yun Zhonghe\u2019s acupuncture point and waved his hand, \u201cRemember your vow.\u201dYun Zhonghe picked up the rotten silver crane claws on the ground and glanced at Song Qingshu with a complicated expression, \u201cYou are very talented, it is rare. Given time, you have the ability to become the best in the world.\u201d His expression was rather lonely, and he swiftly left the mountain.Song Qingshu also didn\u2019t expect that he would be this talented in movement technique (Qinggong). This \u201cTraceless Sand Treading Steps\u201d was very compatible with him, and in time, he will definitely be able to reach the realm of great perfection.Thinking about his lack of talent in other martial arts, but his strange compatibility with movement techniques (Qinggong) and Bewitching Technique, Song Qing\u2019s expression couldn\u2019t help but become weird. Could it be that he was destined to be a flower thief?On the side, the unconscious Mu Wanqing woke up with a soft cry. Song Qingshu\u2019s face instantly returned to that silly look again, he squatted beside her and stared at her with a grin.As soon as Mu Wanqing regained consciousness, she remembered that her acupuncture points were sealed by Yun Zhonghe before she fainted, and her heart sank. If she failed to protect her chastity, she could only choose to take her own life to requite her love for Duan Yu.When she opened her eyes, what welcomed her was Song Qingshu\u2019s silly smiling face, and she screamed in fright. Song Qingshu seemed to be taken aback by her too, so he fell back on his butt three feet away.Mu Wanqing finally reacted, she looked at the familiar clothes on his body, and asked with uncertainty, \u201cAre you that Little Fool?\u201d\u201cYes, yes, pretty sister, do you remember me?\u201d Song Qingshu suddenly became excited, and leaned over again.\u201cAh~ Don\u2019t come close to me!\u201d Mu Wanqing exclaimed, suddenly remembered Yun Zhonghe, and secretly looked at her whole body. She was neatly dressed, and it seemed that nothing dishonorable had happened. She asked strangely, \u201cThat thin bamboo pole just now. What happened to him?\u201d She thought that Song Qingshu was really a trivial man from the wild, and he didn\u2019t know Yun Zhonghe, so she described his appearance instead.\u201cOh, the one you are talking about was beaten away by me.\u201d Song Qingshu gave an honest smile.\u201cYou?\u201d Mu Wanqing glanced at him with suspicion. This guy was obviously unkempt and stupid, so she didn\u2019t believe him in her heart.\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d Song Qingshu seemed to have guessed her mind and raised his fist, \u201cI have great strength. I grew up in the mountains and often fought with bears and gorillas. I can knock out a buffalo with a punch!\u201d He raised chin, like a child who loved to show off.\u201cYou are just bragging!\u201d Mu Wanqing snorted coldly, turned her head, and stopped looking at him.\u201cThen I\u2019ll let you see for yourself.\u201d Song Qingshu seemed to feel insulted, his expression a little anxious, he rolled up his sleeves with irritation, and hit the big tree beside him with a punch.In front of Mu Wanqing\u2019s disbelieving eyes, that large and thick tree was split from the waist, and she turned her head to look at the fool in front of her in horror.Song Qingshu sighed in his heart. Just now, that punch was the \u201cGreat Devil Eradicating Fist\u201d from the \u201cNine Yin Scripture\u201d. Although it was stronger than most masters in wulin, but when Zhang Wuji used his \u201cSeven Injuries Fist\u201d in Guangming, he also hit a tree of the same thickness, it became a pile of fine powder. He, on the other hand, could only split the tree, so the gap was obvious.But he was satisfied with the result for now, so Song Qingshu turned his head and looked at Mu Wanqing with a smile, \u201cHow about it, aren\u2019t I very strong?\u201dAfter Mu Wanqing came out of her daze, she noticed that the veil on his face had been removed. Although there were many dirt stains on his face, she could still make out the fine face behind it, and she softly asked, \u201cWhy did you take off your veil? \u201c\u201cDidn\u2019t my mother say that the first woman who took off my veil, I will marry her?\u201d Song Qingshu paused deliberately. To Mu Wanqing his smile looked a little shameless, \u201cBut then I remembered that my mother once said that girls are all very shy, they are all\u2026 uh, what was that word again? What was the word she used\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu deliberately made an expression of contemplation.\u201cReserved!\u201d Mu Wanqing on the ground said irritably.Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cYes, that! My mother was talking about them being reserved! So I thought, this sister is so beautiful, and she also seems to be a very reserved woman. Maybe she likes me in her heart, but she must be too embarrassed to take the initiative to lift my veil. Therefore, as a man, I have to take the initiative to make things easier for you.\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d Mu Wanqing was trembling with anger, \u201cWho likes you in her heart?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the case?\u201d Song Qingshu showed a puzzled look. \u201cI saw it in a play, a beautiful girl was kidnapped by bad guys in the wilderness. At that time, a young knight appeared, just like me! The bad guy ran away and the girl was rescued. Then shouldn\u2019t that girl dedicate herself to him?\u201d\u201cWho said that if a woman is rescued, she must dedicate herself!\u201d Mu Wanqing was ashamed and angry. She lived alone with her master her whole life. Except for Duan Yu, she had never seen any other young man. Facing Song Qingshu\u2019s endless teasing. She didn\u2019t even know how to refute, \u201cBesides\u2026besides, what kind of young knight are you!\u201d\u201cWow!\u201d Song Qingshu rolled on the ground and cried, \u201cMom was right, you must think I am ugly, not as good-looking as the young knights in the play.\u201dMu Wanqing turned her head and looked at him. When she saw Song Qingshu crying and heartbroken, she felt it was a little unbearable and comforted him, \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201dHearing her words, Song Qingshu whizzed and stood up, \u201cThen are you willing to be my wife?\u201dMu Wanqing was almost choked to death by that sentence, but she realized that the day was almost over, and it was gradually getting dark. In this wilderness, one man and a woman alone, and her acupuncture points were sealed, so she couldn\u2019t move. If this fool had any evil intentions, she would surely suffer. So she smiled and softly said, \u201cLittle Fool, can you unseal my acupuncture points for me first, and then we can discuss this issue.\u201dMu Wanqing\u2019s expression has been as cold as ice since till now. This sudden smile was like the first melting of ice and snow, and it was like a hundred flowers blooming. Song Qingshu felt like he was hit by a heavy hammer in his chest, and he secretly regretted, \u201cI wanted to just tease her. But, if I fall into this trap instead, I will probably lose more than I gain.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Born in different places, but dying togetherSong Qingshu smiled, he rubbed his hands, and his fingertips slowly moved towards the upper parts of Mu Wanqing\u2019s body, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to unseal the acupoints. Should I tap here or here?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d Mu Wanqing exclaimed, and quickly closed her eyes, her face turning pale.\u201cYou are going to be my wife anyways. What does it matter if I touch you or not?\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s fingers were getting closer and closer to Mu Wanqing\u2019s body.\u201cIf you dare to touch me, I will bite my tongue and kill myself!\u201d Mu Wanqing glared with her beautiful eyes and bit her red lips with her teeth.\u201cBut how can I unseal your acupuncture points without touching you?\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s expression looked very innocent.\u201cYou go find a tree branch from nearby, bring it over and I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d Mu Wanqing was almost crying.\u201cGood!\u201d Song Qingshu ran to the side happily, and after a few breaths, he came back again, \u201cMadame, do you think my stick is thick enough?\u201dBefore Mu Wanqing even had time to get angry when she heard him calling her his wife, she saw Song Qingshu standing aside holding a branch with the thickness of a thigh. She felt that she would go crazy!\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be so thick, change to the thickness similar to your fingers.\u201d Mu Wanqing almost couldn\u2019t wait for a chance to shoot this wicked person to death.\u201cOh, your body can\u2019t bear such a thick stick, you should\u2019ve told me earlier.\u201d Song Qingshu muttered while turning around.Mu Wanqing was so angry that she almost broke through her acupuncture points. She looked at him suspiciously and found that he was still that same stupid young man. So, she could only speak to him fiercely, \u201cLittle Fool, if I find out that you are doing all this on purpose to tease me, I will definitely kill you.\u201d\u201cLady, what is teasing?\u201d Song Qingshu turned around and looked at her in confusion.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Mu Wanqing almost felt suffocated, and impatiently said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, go look for a branch.\u201d\u201cOh~\u201d Song Qingshu looked and looked, and finally found a suitable stick, \u201cLady, what should I do now?\u201d\u201cI was tapped on the Yaoshu (weist) acupoint. You can hit my lower acupoint with a branch to unseal that acupuncture point.\u201d Mu Wanqing said that while the roots of her ears turned red.\u201cWhat\u2026Where is the lower acupoint?\u201d Song Qingshu asked with a pair of wide open eyes that knew no evils of this world. In fact, there was a special technique for acupuncture in the \u201cNine Yin Scripture\u201d. So, how could he not know this? He just wanted to tease this beautiful lady, so he asked about it even though he knew.Mu Wanqing hesitated for a moment, but still said, \u201cInner thigh\u2026\u201dHer voice became lower and lower, and turned her head away in embarrassment after she finished speaking.\u201cThat\u2019s it~\u201d Song Qingshu thoughtfully spoke up. But, just as Mu Wanqing wanted to speak some more, she found that he was poking around her inner thigh with a wooden stick.\u201cThat place is wrong!\u201d Mu Wanqing cried out, \u201cIt\u2019s three inches above the knee.\u201dWhen Song Qingshu noticed Mu Wanqing\u2019s tears falling like broken pearls one by one on the grass beside her, his heart felt stuffed, and his movements slowed down.Any man wouldn\u2019t bear to tease her anymore when she looked like a pear flower in the rain. Song Qingshu was a man, so he also was no exception to that.After he tapped her lower acupuncture point with the branch, Mu Wanqing finally regained control of her body. She turned over and jumped up, raising her sleeve arrow to shoot Song Qingshu to death.She had already planned out how to fix this stinky boy who made her so miserable, but at this moment, when she saw him looking up at with his innocent and silly look, she couldn\u2019t bear to do it.A layer of mist appeared on her beautiful eyes again. Mu Wanqing squatted down, buried her head between her thighs and started crying.\u201cLady, why are you crying?\u201d Song Qingshu asked cluelessly from the side.\u201cGo away! Auuuoo~\u201d Mu Wanqing continued to cry and became more sad. At first, she was only sad about the grievances she received today. Later, when she thought that she and Duan Yu were not fated to be together, she couldn\u2019t help but feel even more sad and felt that God was too cruel.Finally, her crying gradually subsided. Mu Wanqing\u2019s eyes were red and swollen, and she raised her head to see that Song Qingshu hadn\u2019t left, but fell asleep under the big tree beside her.\u201cPuff!\u201d Seeing his drooling look, Mu Wanqing couldn\u2019t hold back and laughed for a moment.\u201cLady, you\u2019re awake~\u201d Song Qingshu quickly opened his eyes and giggled.She didn\u2019t know why, but Mu Wanqing didn\u2019t feel that angry this time. She was introverted by nature. Because of the environment she was in while growing up, she had no friends. After learning that Duan Yu was her own brother, she collapsed completely, and had no one she could talk to. It made her feel even more lonely in the world. This fool, although looked stupid, it seemed that he really cared about her.\u201cLittle Fool, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Mu Wanqing asked, wiping the tears on her cheek with the back of her hand.\u201cYou already know that my name is Little Fool, and you still ask me what is it? You are so stupid.\u201d Song Qingshu grinned.\u201cYour name is really Little Fool?\u201d Mu Wanqing was feeling quite surprised. How could a parent give a child such a name?\u201cYes, my mother gave it to me, but unfortunately she is not here anymore.\u201d Song Qingshu thought of his mother from his previous life, and felt sad.She originally wanted to comfort him, but the inexperienced Mu Wanqing realized that she didn\u2019t know how to comfort him, her Tsundere attributes suddenly kicked in, and she remained silent.\u201cBy the way, where is your home?\u201d After a while, Mu Wanqing realized that it was getting late. She was afraid that she wouldn\u2019t be able to go down the mountain today. She was also worried that she would run into Yun Zhonghe again and decided to stay with this fool. He would act as her free bodyguard. As for the issue of him being a man, Mu Wanqing glanced at him and automatically excluded him from the category of men.\u201cHome\u2026after my mother was gone, I have no home,\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s nose felt sour, \u201cLater, any place under the heavens became my home. Wherever there is a cave, there is my home.\u201dMu Wanqing looked at him sympathetically. No wonder this fool was so stupid, he had been living like a savage, so of course his IQ was abnormal.\u201cThen where did you live during these few days?\u201d The cold wind blew, Mu Wanqing looked at the sky, and estimated that there would be heavy rain in a while. But at the moment she just wanted to quickly find a shelter, otherwise she would get wet when it rains. It would be troublesome if she got sick.Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes lit up, and his hand pointed to the side of the cliff, where he had been living these few days.Mu Wanqing came to the edge of the cliff with suspicion, grabbed the big tree on the side, stretched her head to look down, and only saw the clouds and mist. His home was nowhere to be seen. And she angrily said, \u201cYou lied to me!\u201d\u201cNo no,\u201d Song Qingshu hurriedly waved his hands, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019ll take you to see it with your own eyes.\u201d\u201cHow will you take me there?\u201d Mu Wanqing stared at him blankly.\u201cYou just have to hold on and jump down with me.\u201d Song Qingshu grinned.Mu Wanqing felt angry again, but quickly recovered her calm. She no longer had a fate with her beloved Duan Yu in this life. She felt as if she was already dead, so she didn\u2019t think much even if she jumped and fell to her death with him. However, if the future generations found their remains, wouldn\u2019t they think that they were a pair of lovers who died in the name of love?Song Qingshu noticed Mu Wanqing\u2019s face turning blue and white, and then she shuddered all over her body, so he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cMiss, are you going?\u201dMu Wanqing smiled sadly, thinking to herself that she could imagine so much even when she was about to die, so she nodded very simply.Song Qingshu laughed and came closer to her, wrapped his left hand around her soft waist, and hugged Mu Wanqing tightly in his arms.Mu Wanqing finally came to her senses and was about to resist, but Song Qingshu leaped and jumped off the cliff.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: The Five Sacred Mountain Sword ArtMu Wanqing closed her eyes in resignation, but the imaginary fall did not happen. She opened her eyes in doubt and found the two of them standing on a platform protruding from the cliff wall. The mountains were often surrounded by rain and mist, so naturally no one knew that there was another mystery hidden here.Realizing that she was in the arms of another man, Mu Wanqing quickly pushed Song Qingshu away, and awkwardly looked for something to say, \u201cThis is where you live?\u201dReminiscing about the unique scent of the girl which resembled the distinct fragrance of orchids, a smile appeared at the corner of Song Qingshu\u2019s mouth, \u201cYes. It\u2019s going to rain, come with me.\u201dMu Wanqing cautiously followed behind him. When she found the tombstone of the \u201cGolden Serpent Gentleman\u201d, she was startled, and her voice trembled, \u201cHere\u2026 why is there a grave here?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s all the fuss about?\u201d Song Qingshu glanced at her strangely, and nonchalantly said, \u201cHis grave is so fresh and refined, I am sure that this \u201cGolden Serpent Gentleman\u201d must have been a hermit expert.\u201d\u201cCome in, no misfortune, no resentment.\u201d Mu Wanqing read the writing on the wall and said with a strange expression, \u201cFrom what it says, this senior seems to have left some martial arts secrets\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I found this place, there were not even a few bird feathers here.\u201d Song Qingshu said angrily, and handed the dry food in the parcel to Mu Wanqing.Looking at the big pie in her hand, she hesitated to eat it. Out of her woman\u2019s precaution, Mu Wanqing subconsciously worried that there might be questionable medicine in it. But then she thought, even when she had her acupuncture point sealed, this Little Fool didn\u2019t do anything. So, she just raised it to her lips and started eating it bit by bit.Alone and silent, Mu Wanqing felt very uncomfortable. She was unwilling to continue eating in silence, so she started asking one question after another, \u201cLittle Fool, what are you going to do tomorrow?\u201d\u201cSearching for treasures.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s answer was completely beyond Mu Wanqing\u2019s expectation.\u201cWhat kind of treasure do you want to search for?\u201d Mu Wanqing looked at him in surprise.\u201cI heard that there are treasures on Mount Hua, so I came to search for treasures. I just found this place a few days ago.\u201d Song Qingshu thought for a while and replied.\u201cIs the treasure you\u2019re talking about martial arts secrets or gold and silver treasures?\u201d Mu Wanqing recalled the scene in the cave, and suddenly realized.\u201cCan you eat those martial arts secrets or gold and silver treasures?\u201d Song Qingshu said stupidly, \u201cI\u2019m here to look for my wife. I heard that there are fairies on Mount Hua. Although you are very beautiful, I still want to look for some again. See if I can find a more beautiful little fairy wife.\u201dMu Wanqing gave him a silent glance, and was too lazy to pay attention to him, so she just closed her eyes and rested, holding the hilt of the sword tightly with her right hand, and quietly guarding.After a long time, Mu Wanqing opened her eyes and saw that the other party was already lying on the ground and fell asleep, she couldn\u2019t help but smile, and fell asleep with confidence.When she woke up the next day, Mu Wanqing looked at the cliff that was several feet high, and felt a little troubled about how to get back up. Song Qingshu came to her, \u201cHey, leave it to me.\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, he naturally took hold of Mu Wanqing\u2019s slender waist, and Mu Wanqing\u2019s body stiffened, but she gradually softened. Song Qingshu hugged her, and using both hands and feet, began vigorously climbing up.Originally, Mu Wanqing had always suspected that he was a martial arts master pretending to be dumb, but noticed that his climbing posture was terrible, like a monkey. So she suddenly smiled comfortably, thinking that he might have grown up in the mountains since childhood. And he learned these physical abilities from the mountain beasts.Stepping on the flat ground, Mu Wanqing swiftly pushed Song Qingshu away as usual. She was originally planning to leave, but thinking that she didn\u2019t have a place to go, and wondering what the treasure Song Qingshu was talking about, she followed him step by step.Song Qingshu saw that she didn\u2019t mean to leave, his eyes lit up, and he teased, \u201cWife, you really can\u2019t bear to leave me.\u201d\u201cIf you talk more nonsense, I\u2019ll shoot you with a poisoned arrow!\u201d Mu Wanqing warned with a sullen eye. \u201cYou are not allowed to call me your wife in the future.\u201d\u201cOkay, wife~\u201d Song Qingshu agreed with a grin.\u201cyou!\u201dThe two of them fought and made a ruckus all the way to Mount Hua of the Five Sacred Mountains.Although Mount Hua Sect\u2019s Qi Faction was a decent and upright sect in the past, their pool of talents were now withered, and it was not as powerful as the Sword Faction of the Chaoyang Peak. The two travelled all the way in while hiding their presence, and none of the Qi Faction disciples found them.\u201cAre you going to trespass there? I think that cliff is right in front of Mount Hua Sect.\u201d Mu Wanqing looked at the steep mountain road in front of her, and hesitantly said.\u201cWe will find the treasure there! Are you feeling scared, my wife?\u201d Song Qingshu asked while winking his eyebrows.\u201cHuh, what is this girl afraid of!\u201d Mu Wanqing was originally a reckless girl from the start. She was feeling a little hesitant due to the name of Mount Hua before, but when Song Qingshu provoked her, she didn\u2019t care about it anymore.The two walked through the long wooden steps, and finally came to the top of the Cogitation Cliff. The Cogitation Cliff had three sides, on one side was a mountain wall, and there was a cave on the mountain wall. This place seemed very deserted.\u201cThe last one to visit here should have been Linghu Chong.\u201d Song Qingshu thought, \u201cLinghu Chong is quite good among the many protagonists. Although he has already learned the \u201cNine Swords of Dugu\u201d, the \u201cFive Sacred Mountain Sword Art\u201d should remain in the cave intact.\u201dSong Qingshu had already figured out that he couldn\u2019t compete with the original protagonists in terms of luck. Therefore, he had given up on acquiring all the unique skills of the original protagonists. However, there were still many martial arts in the original work that the protagonists had never monopolized, and the \u201cFive Sacred Mountain Sword Art\u201d was one of them.\u201cLittle Fool, what do you do with a wooden sword all day long?\u201d Mu Wanqing wondered very early on about the thin wooden sword on Song Qingshu\u2019s back. With her knowledge, of course, she knew that it was possible to fight with a wooden sword. But, that required a higher realm of attainment in the way of the sword, so she purely thought it was just a toy.\u201cThis husband doesn\u2019t want to hurt my wife, so I disdained the use of sharp swords from a long time ago.\u201d Song Qingshu looked intoxicated.\u201cToo lazy to care about your words.\u201d Mu Wanqing had long become accustomed to his bragging hobbies in the past few days, so she didn\u2019t even bother to give him a look of contempt.Although Song Qingshu was quite sure of his speculation in his heart, he didn\u2019t see those sword moves with his own eyes. So, everything was unknown. As soon as he entered the cave, he paid special attention to the traces on the wall, and soon found a faint crack on the wall behind a tree vine.With a light palm strike, Song Qingshu knocked down the rock covering it and bent down to get in.\u201cAh!\u201d When she looked at the bones all over the floor, Mu Wanqing\u2019s heart became tense, and she held the sword firmly in her hand.\u201cI thought it was some kind of treasure, but it turned out to be some crappy paintings.\u201d Although Song Qingshu seemed disappointed, his eyes quickly swept across the various sword moves on the wall.\u201cYou stupid ghost, this is clearly a superb sword technique.\u201d Hearing his voice, Mu Wanqing looked up and saw the \u201cFive Sacred Mountain Sword Art\u201d technique on the wall, as well as a detailed description of various evasion techniques.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: Fighting with Feng QingyangSong Qingshu didn\u2019t listen to what Mu Wanqing was saying. He just continued to observe. He had already comprehended the \u201cFive Sacred Mountain Sword Art\u201d and the expert description of the evasion techniques by the ten senior elders of the Sun Moon Holy Cult. Then he closed his eyes, and his mind swiftly began to work.After reading the original novels, he had long understood that having more tricks up his sleeve would give him a better chance of staying alive. If these sword techniques are used as usual, they would most probably be easily countered by the opponents. But as long as they are performed along with the evasion methods, it would be easy to avoid being dragged in by the enemy and then break through.In theory, Song Qingshu should have a high level of combat power, but he lacked the vision for actual combat. Now these murals gave him a vivid demonstration of the methods used by the masters.The angle, timing, strength of the move, as well as its synergy with the next move, and the enemy\u2019s response\u2026 Song Qingshu felt that his thoughts became clearer and clearer.Suddenly he was alarmed. He turned back and looked behind him. Mu Wanqing noticed his movements, then also turned around, and found an old man with white beard and hair, quietly standing there.\u201cYoung people these days are very alert.\u201d The old man smiled slightly, looking at the sword moves on the wall, he got lost in reminiscence, and finally let out a long sigh, \u201cIt\u2019s been so many years, the people of the Sun Moon Holy Cult still found this place.\u201dNaturally, this person was Feng Qingyang from the original novel. Song Qingshu was discovered by him as soon as he set his foot on the cliff. He was surprised to find that Song Qingshu didn\u2019t stop at all, and went straight into the hidden cave here.Except for Linghu Chong, who accidentally crashed into this place, no one else knew about the secret hidden here. Song Qingshu\u2019s behavior was similar to someone who obviously knew about the secret here in advance. He noticed that this young man\u2019s internal strength seemed to be quite decent, unlike his martial arts, so Feng Qingyang calmly speculated. \u2018He is probably a member of the Demon Cult, and found out about the secret here from the notes of his predecessors.\u2019The technique of the Five Mountain Sword Sects must not fall into the hands of the Demon Cult. Feng Qingyang\u2019s thoughts flashed, and he slowly said, \u201cYoung man, this old man can\u2019t let you go down the mountain with the \u201cFive Sacred Mountain Sword Art\u201d. You should stay here to accompany me. This old man will probably live for another twenty or thirty years.\u201dHow could Song Qingshu know that he had been misunderstood by Feng Qingyang as a member of the Demon Cult, and couldn\u2019t help but secretly groan. He just came here to pick up some leftovers that the original protagonist did not fancy. But now this happened!Mu Wanqing on the side clearly felt the mysterious aura of the old man. She felt anxious when she heard what he said, and quickly explained, \u201cWe just happened to break into the forbidden area of your sect unintentionally. We didn\u2019t understand the rules and looked at the technique of the sect. But this guy is just a fool, he won\u2019t remember if he sees it. So, I hope that the Senior will be benevolent, and let him go.\u201dWhen he saw that Mu Wanqing was begging for him, Song Qingshu\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but warm up and he glanced at her gratefully.Hearing Mu Wanqing\u2019s words, Feng Qingyang\u2019s expression suddenly became a little weird, \u201cIs he really a fool?\u201d Suddenly he realized something, his expression became more severe, and he looked at Song Qingshu, \u201cIt is even more unforgivable to deceive a woman using untruthful words.\u201dSong Qingshu originally respected this master of sword arts quite a lot, but when he saw that after this guy came in, he just selfishly decided everything by himself without even talking to him. Then he conveniently placed himself on the moral high ground and severely criticized him.Suddenly, Song Qingshu\u2019s heart surged with anger. And his self-esteem made him smile proudly, \u201cHaha, it sounds like you think that your martial arts is higher than mine.\u201dMu Wanqing turned pale and looked at Song Qingshu anxiously, \u201cLittle Fool, you should admit your mistake to this senior.\u201dFeng Qingyang\u2019s heart was usually like an ancient pond that has been tranquil for many years, but he still felt a rush of fire in his heart, and snorted, \u201cThis youngster is too arrogant.\u201d\u201cYou can try.\u201d Song Qingshu stood there silently, watching him with contempt.\u201cYou make a move first, otherwise there will be no chance. This old man can let you have three moves first.\u201d Feng Qingyang held his hands behind his back, considering his identity, he refused to make a move first.\u201cThat\u2019s what you said.\u201d A wicked smile appeared on Song Qingshu\u2019s mouth. With a movement that propelled him to the extreme, he passed by Feng Qingyang like lightning, and a blood line appeared on his neck. As Feng Qingyang slowly fell, Song Qingshu wiped the blood stains on the wooden sword, and disdainfully said, \u201cDon\u2019t pretend to be a master, you might be struck by lightning.\u201dOf course, the scene above was just Song Qingshu\u2019s fantasy.Feng Qingyang glanced at his weird smile strangely, and coldly snorted, \u201cJust now you were lost in a daze. If I acted, you would have been dead.\u201dSong Qingshu wiped the saliva from his mouth and smiled in embarrassment. How could he make such an elementary mistake? If it hadn\u2019t been for his opponent giving him three opportunities, that daze just now would have cost him his life.\u201cAlright, I will humbly ask seniors for his advice.\u201d Song Qingshu cheered up, and changed the stance of his feet, his palms implied the defensive position of the Wudang\u2019s \u201cSilky Palm\u201d, mixed with the heaviness of the Emei\u2019s \u201cGolden Top Cotton Palm\u201d and the intensity of the \u201cHeaven Shaking Iron Palm\u201d.\u201cHuh!\u201d Feng Qingyang glanced at him in surprise, and thought in his heart that this kid could blend several different palm techniques with varying temperament so appropriately, he was really a martial arts genius. It is a pity that he was a member of the evil cult, and he was full of hostility toward him, which was really unfortunate.Feng Qingyang steadied his mind, performed a sword technique with his fingers, and greeted his opponent with one finger. Song Qingshu was shocked to find that a sharp and fierce sword qi tore apart his fist wind. If he did not withdraw his palm and move aside, his palm would be pierced. He quickly blasted the opponent\u2019s sword qi using the Great Devil Eradicating Fist with his left hand. With one step, he quickly retreated a few meters away.\u201cThe Palm-defeating Stance, from the Nine Swords of Dugu. It really deserves its reputation.\u201d Song Qingshu looked at Feng Qingyang with a heavy expression, and it would be hard to defeat the enemy who knew the Nine Swords of Dugu.Feng Qingyang had long since escaped the shackles of the Nine Swords of Dugu. Just now, that finger strike was only a watered down palm-breaking sword intent. When he saw that his opponent mistakenly thought it was the Nine Swords of Dugu, he didn\u2019t explain it to him, \u201cThis young man\u2019s martial arts is already foremost in the younger generation. How rare.\u201d\u201cOld Feng really deserves to be the number one swordsman in the current era.\u201d Song Qingshu sincerely expressed his admiration.\u201cThe first opportunity is over. Now make the second move.\u201d Feng Qingyang smiled faintly, and continued to stand with his hand behind his back.\u201cDamn, when will I be able to pose like that and pretend to be mighty in front of the enemy.\u201d Song Qingshu angrily thought, and then sent a well executed Tiger Claw Ending Hand straight toward the opponent\u2019s middle section of the body.\u201cHuh!\u201d Feng Qingyang was shocked again. Just now, his palm strike was mixed with the essence of several sets of palm techniques, but this second move was so mediocre. Anticipating that he must have a backup move, he didn\u2019t make any movements.Sure enough, when the attack reached in front of him, it changed from a vicious Tiger Claw Ending Hand to a sinister Nine Yin White Bone Claw. Feng Qingyang observed the swift change of his techniques, but he didn\u2019t rush or hurry, and calmly used a finger to touch the Nine Yin White Bone Claw.Mu Wanqing looked annoyed and repulsed. Song Qingshu\u2019s Nine Yin White Bone Claw attacked very quickly, but Feng Qingyang\u2019s fingers seemed to move in slow motion, and he precisely used the sword qi on his fingers to disperse every claw strike!After a few breaths, Song Qingshu returned to his original place, and his hands felt numb. Feng Qingyang glanced at him in surprise, \u2018I didn\u2019t expect him to counter my sword energy with a frontal attack, and it didn\u2019t hurt him that much as well.\u201d\u201cThere is one last move left.\u201d The more this happened, the more alert Feng Qingyang became. The appearance of such a person in the Demon Cult was by no means a blessing for the Five Mountain Sword Sects, and he unconsciously attacked with the intention to kill.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: A slap of shameNoting the killing intent in Feng Qingyang\u2019s eyes, Song Qingshu realized that the situation was not good, but he was not afraid of it in his heart, instead he became even more eager to fight him.With a stroke of his left hand and a palm of his right hand, he swiftly attacked Feng Qingyang. It was the \u201cThe Proud Dragon Repents\u201d of the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms.Feng Qingyang saw that his opponent chose to do another frontal attack, and his previous use of techniques were too treacherous and unpredictable, so he decided to cope with all changes without changing anything, and secretly condensed the innate sword qi to his fingers.Song Qingshu didn\u2019t wait for his moves to get cold. He drew a circle again with his left hand and another palm with his right hand.The power of the two palms were stacked upon each other, and it was like a raging wave, unstoppable, like an invisible wall of air blasting forward behind the calm wind.Feng Qingyang felt that it was becoming hard to breathe, and he quickly changed the sword tactics, and greeted the attack with a burst of energy.Song Qingshu leaped into the air with the help of the recoiling force, and used the \u201cThe Dragon Soars in the Sky\u201d from the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms, and once again attacked with the third wave of \u201cThe Proud Dragon Repents\u201d.The expression on Feng Qingyang\u2019s face finally changed. He realized that he had underestimated Song Qingshu\u2019s strength. The innate sword qi of his right hand finger was more than enough to break through Song Qingshu\u2019s first two palms. What he didn\u2019t expect was that Song Qingshu would deliver the third palm when the first two were over, and the three palms overlapped. As a result, the strength of palm wind increased exponentially. Feng Qingyang was able to break through his opponents first two waves, but his innate sword qi was blown away by Song Qingshu\u2019s third palm. In desperation, he had no choice but to dodge and move back several feet away.Feng Qingyang\u2019s expression was a little embarrassing. After all, this was the first time he was forced to defend while using the sword by an enemy in so many years. And the opponent was still a wet behind the ears young man, \u201cEighteen Dragon Subduing Palms! Your Excellency is Master Xiao Feng?\u201d\u201cIf King Xiao was here, Old Feng might not be having such a good time compared to when he is facing me.\u201d Song Qing gave a negative answer in his words, and secretly thanked his luck. He knew the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms and also knew the tactics Xiao Feng was best at. He understood the overall principle of the tactic, tried his best to emulate it, and actually managed to perform it. Of course, there was still a big gap when it came to the power, the angle of execution and the timing of the attack.\u201cThen who are you? You are able to perform techniques of authentic sects such as Wudang and Emei Sect, and you also have the sinister martial arts from the Nine Yin Scripture, the Nine Yin White Bone Claw. I\u2019m afraid even Xiao Feng and Guo Jing can be considered barely superior to you, and the other elders are far inferior to you.\u201d Feng Qingyang\u2019s eyesight was very sharp, he quickly saw through his martial arts skills.\u201cYou can call me Little Fool.\u201d Song Qingshu looked back at the dumbfounded Mu Wanqing, revealing a mischievous smile. But he thought in his heart, \u2018I have a few more achievements on my belt, and I had also done something bad to Zhou Zhiruo, the leader of Emei Sect.\u2019\u201cYour three moves are over. If you don\u2019t want to speak the truth, then I\u2019ll have you remain here.\u201d Feng Qingyang was slightly angry, he grabbed his sword and attacked.The speed of the sword qi made Song Qingshu click his tongue, and he hurriedly used the Slithering Snake Jumping Raccoon Technique and rolled on the ground, avoiding Feng Qingyang\u2019s fierce sword strike.However, even though he missed the first time, Feng Qingyang continued to attack with one sword qi after another. Song Qingshu could only dodge with all his strength, and had no chance to fight back. The space of movement was deliberately being shortened by his opponent to become smaller and smaller.Song Qingshu knew that if he continued like this, it would be game over for him within the next ten moves. But he still did not easily counterattack with the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms. Through their exchange of attacks just now, he understood that his palm waves were not too effective against the opponent\u2019s sword qi. Coupled with the Palm-defeating Stance from the Nine Swords of Dugu, no matter how strong the palm wave was, it was no better than paper.A given force can have a significantly different effect depending on the area over which the force is exerted. With the same application of strength, the force- bearing area of a palm strike was much larger than the innate sword qi of the opponent\u2019s fingertips. Damn you pressure formula!Song Qingshu fiercely cursed physics. The gap between them continued to close as his opponent countered his palm strikes with his sword qi.Song Qingshu constantly paid attention to the gap. Then finally urged by his internal force, the wooden sword on his back shot out, and he grabbed it with his right hand. He swiped a few sword strikes and started to counterattack.Feng Qingyang had noticed his wooden sword a long time ago, and thought it was just an ornament. But he did not expect that this guy had reached the state of \u201cNo Sword\u201d at such a young age. He observed the thin layer of sword qi that appeared on the surface of the wooden sword. What\u2019s even more surprising was that his sword moves were exactly like the engravings on the wall. The only difference was that they had not been completely methodically applied. A couple of sword techniques from the Five Sacred Mountain Sword Art were used, but their strength was not the same, it implied that the opponent could swap it at will, and was waiting to see his reaction. And, change tactics at a moment\u2019s notice.Feng Qingyang stepped on the ground and quickly retreated a few meters away. Although Song Qingshu\u2019s first three moves were amazing enough, they were not as shocking as this time. He stared at Song Qingshu in utter shock and asked, \u201cYou just watched it casually. How can you comprehend these sword techniques on the wall with just a few glances?\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s expression turned a bit red in shame, and he shyly replied, \u201cIt seems like\u2026 that\u2019s what happened.\u201dAfter listening to his words, Feng Qingyang almost spit out a mouthful of old blood. He has been called a sword-wielding genius that was seen once in hundreds of years. Only with his decades of cultivation on the way of the sword, he could comprehend the moves on the wall, and then integrate them with his sword intent. This young man, on the other hand, had probably practiced the sword for not more than a year, and he had attained such a realm! How could Feng Qingyang not be surprised if this youth attained something equal to himself.\u201cWhether it is true or not, I will just have to try and see it for myself.\u201d Feng Qingyang still didn\u2019t believe it, and decided to attack again.Song Qingshu quickly focused and parried his attack with the wooden sword.For a time, the cave became full sword qi. Feng Qingyang was basically attacking Song Qingshu\u2019s defense, and he was often forced into embarrassing situations. Song Qingshu was like a lonely boat in the storm, always able to stay afloat. He used the technique of the Five Sacred Mountain Sword Art, and remained undefeated against Feng Qingyang\u2019s Nine Swords of Dugu. Sometimes he even attacked with a few sword strikes so that Feng Qingyang had to use his sword to defend.However, Song Qingshu soon came to a bitter self-realization. Although he could fight Feng Qingyang for a hundred moves without being defeated, he knew that if he continued fighting like this Feng Qingyang would no longer show any mercy. And if the sword qi invades his body, he would die without a doubt.After he had this thought, he no longer had any will to fight again. And decided to resort to a weird sword technique, while shouting out its name, \u201cHave a taste of my ultimate move, Ten Thousand Swords Return to the Sect!!!\u201dFeng Qingyang became confused. This young man gave him too many surprises. He was really afraid that he would lose his concentration and be injured by his weird moves. So, he tightly held his sword in his hands and waited for him.When he saw that his opponent fell for his trick, Song Qingshu no longer dared to hesitate, he pushed the Traceless Sand Treading Steps to the extreme, and picked up Mu Wanqing, who was dumbly standing next to him.After Feng Qingyang came out of his daze, he couldn\u2019t help but get furious, and he hurriedly used his movement technique (Qinggong) to chase him, but he had lost his first opportunity. Song Qingshu was performing the super movement technique (Qinggong) the Traceless Sand Treading Steps, and was able to swiftly run away, even if he still had a person in his arms. Feng Qingyang had no choice but to watch the distance between the two of them get farther and farther.Sensing that Feng Qingyang was finally thrown off, Song Qingshu gently put Mu Wanqing down, and said fortunately, \u201cMiss, fortunately you are soft as a cotton and light as a feather, otherwise we really wouldn\u2019t be able to run away.\u201dBut what answered him was Mu Wanqing\u2019s clear and resounding slap.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: The beauty wakes up and shows her wrath\u201cMiss, you\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu looked at Mu Wanqing in amazement.\u201cAre you a fool, or are you a master of martial arts!\u201d Mu Wanqing pointed at him and trembled with anger, thinking that she was deceived by him for the past two days, and he took advantage of her.\u201cMiss Mu, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d This was the end of the matter, and there was no need to pretend anymore, so Song Qingshu bitterly smiled.\u201cIs it fun for you, a master, teasing ordinary people like me?\u201d Mu Wanqing\u2019s voice became colder and colder.\u2018I think it\u2019s quite fun.\u2019 Song Qingshu thought in his heart, but of course he never dared to say so out loud, \u201cI just noticed that young miss was heartbroken. You also seemed to have thoughts of suicide. There was not a lot of time. I only wanted to persuade you and was afraid that you would reject strangers. So, the only way I could think was to make this bad decision.\u201dWhen Mu Wanqing\u2019s sorrowful matter was mentioned again, her small mouth slumped, and a trace of mist appeared in her beautiful eyes.Although Mu Wanqing was cold and fierce on the surface, she was only a young girl in the end. If it was in his previous world, she might not have gone to college at this age. Song Qingshu had these thoughts flashing in his mind, but he didn\u2019t know how to coax her at the moment.After a while, Mu Wanqing turned her head, quietly wiped her cheek with her fingertips, and asked in a deep voice, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201dNoting her jade-like fingers, Song Qingshu\u2019s throat suddenly got a little dry, and quickly replied, \u201cMiss Mu, this humble one is Song Qingshu.\u201d\u201cThank you Master Song for helping me a few days ago, and this lowly girl will be forever grateful.\u201d Mu Wanqing said coldly, and turned to leave. Although she was extremely angry, according to her old temperament, after encountering such a stinky man she would naturally kill him with a poison arrow. But considering the incredible martial arts she had just seen with her own eyes, she gave up on this idea.\u201cNow she is leaving too.\u201d Song Qingshu muttered to himself, his reluctance was very obvious. After being exposed to this beautiful woman, he didn\u2019t know what to say to make her stay. And according to his personality, he also couldn\u2019t do something like that pretty boy Duan Yu.Hearing Song Qingshu talking to himself, Mu Wanqing\u2019s ears blushed, she suddenly stopped, turned around and stared at Song Qingshu, \u201cGo and wash your face, I don\u2019t want to leave without even knowing what my saviour looks like.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s no trouble at all!\u201d Song Qingshu was aware of Mu Wanqing\u2019s arrogant and unusual personality, and couldn\u2019t figure out her thoughts for a while, so he ran to a nearby stream to wash off the stains on his face, and then fixed his wild hairstyle. Then he tied it up with a cloth strip.Looking at the renewed Song Qingshu, an invisible blush appeared on Mu Wanqing\u2019s fair face, \u201cOkay, I have seen it clearly.\u201d After speaking, she simply turned around and left.Could it be that she was fascinated by the handsomeness of the \u201cJade-Faced Mengchang\u201d? Song Qingshu was surprised. The original Song Qingshu was a well-known handsome young hero in the wulin. Now that he has achieved great accomplishments. His reserved and calm temperament added a few levels of charms. Now, every time he woke up in the morning and looked in the mirror, the first sentence that came out of his mouth was,\u00a0 \u201cI woke up handsome today too.\u201dSeeing Mu Wanqing go further and further, Song Qingshu shook his head and smiled bitterly in his heart, \u2018Mu Wanqing is a well-known infatuated woman in the original book, who loved her brother Duan Yu all her life, how can she be moved by other men.\u2019However, looking at her slender figure, Song Qingshu still shouted out, \u201cAfter this, I will go back to Jiangnan.\u201dSeeing Mu Wanqing walking far away as always, without any fluctuations in her body, Song Qingshu became anxious and quickly added, \u201cDuan Yu was taken away by Tibetan Empire\u2019s master Jiumozhi, his intention is to go to Murong Bo\u2019s grave at Gusu. Before his cremation.\u201dMu Wanqing really trembled, stopped for a moment, and continued to walk, finally disappearing from Song Qingshu\u2019s sight.\u2018It seems that my position in her heart is still not as good as that pretty boy Duan Yu!\u2019 Song Qingshu was full of complex emotion, without realizing that he was also a true pretty boy through and through.However, he was sure that Mu Wanqing would go to Jiangnan to save Duan Yu. Song Qingshu was not worried about her safety at all. Although Jiumozhi was a little bit despicable at times, fundamentally he was still a virtuous monk, unlike Yun Zhonghe who had the hobby of attacking a weak girl like Mu Wanqing.The reason he was sending her to Jiangnan was that Song Qingshu had already made plans to go to Jiangnan.In these two days of free time, he had been planning his future. The search for treasures that he planned before seemed very unrealistic now. But now, his martial arts was actually powerful enough, especially today in the battle with Feng Qingyang, which filled him with overwhelming confidence. He knew that as long as he didn\u2019t provoke those famous murderers in the wulin, his current strength was more than enough to protect himself anywhere.Moreover, as his martial arts realm became higher and higher, Song Qingshu\u2019s ambitions became greater and greater. The rich experience from his previous life made him understand very early that in this troubled world, no matter how high realm he achieved in pure martial arts, he would only be a chess piece for someone superior. Similar to that Guo Jing.Relatively speaking, he envied the Ming Cult\u2019s advocacy of unscrupulousness. It has hundreds and thousands of followers, who could become its vassals. Along with its strong soldiers and sturdy horses, it even has the possibility of dominating the world.But thinking of the inexplicable relationship between Zhang Wuji and his nominal wife, he felt disgusted. He didn\u2019t want to be Li Yu\u2019s kind of unlucky ghost. If Zhang Wuji ruled the world, he would summon Zhou Zhiruo to the imperial harem whenever he wanted. And when that time comes, he really wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to stop it.Besides, Song Qingshu created a business empire in his previous life. He had become accustomed to the feeling of being in control and holding the fate of many people in his hands. But now he was just a nobody, and he was not used to this kind of role change, so he wanted to plan early. He wanted to slowly climb up the social ladder.The current world was really chaotic, it was a good time to make contributions. Song Qingshu was not the kind of political speculator like Murong Bo and his sons, who had good eyes but poor methods. He had already planned out a blueprint.What is the essence of power? One is military power, and the other is personnel power. In fact, the most important thing is financial power. When many people depend on you for food, you will naturally have tremendous power. Of course, if you don\u2019t have the strength to ensure that your wealth will not be taken away. The concept of power is just a ridiculous circle.Realizing that searching for the martial arts secrets were hopeless, Song Qingshu immediately shifted his focus to finding other treasures of the world. The kind which included gold and silver.All the martial arts secrets hidden in the world were exclusively owned by the original protagonists, so he couldn\u2019t compete with the original protagonist in terms of luck. But the original novel had one thing more or less in common, that is, none of the protagonists get involved with the treasures that appear in the novel!It was most likely that Old Man Jin wanted to show that the protagonist regarded money as shit, but this was exactly what Song Qingshu was after.There was no need to compete for the martial arts treasure with the protagonist of the original book. Song Qingshu felt that his thoughts were correct. So, he began to make a mental list of available treasures in the current world. The treasure of the Gaochang maze was far in the Western Regions. It was Zhang Wuji\u2019s domain and could not be considered for the time being; the Chuangwang treasure near the Yubi Villa was also out of the consideration. It was far away and located in the hinterland of the Qing Dynasty. It would be difficult to take it even if he found it. The treasure of the \u201cSutra in Forty-two Chapters\u201d was even more difficult. Not to mention the difficulty of collecting the eight sections and the forty-two chapters, it was impossible to secretly take out the treasure without alerting the Man Qing Dynasty\u2019s eyes and ears.The treasure of Tianning Temple in Jingzhou was easy to find, but it was Ling Tuisi\u2019s domain, and it was located in a war zone, so Song Qingshu didn\u2019t want to get involved.After much deliberation, Song Qingshu finally fixed his gaze on the treasure of Dagong Lane in Jinling City!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: The hero meets a bullyThe treasure of Dagong Lane in Jinling City was easy to find, and unlike other treasures, it was not even natural born. The treasure of Dagong Lane was very likely to be discovered by other minor plot characters.In order to avoid the treasure falling into the hands of others, Song Qingshu decided to go to Jinling immediately, so just now he deliberately fooled Mu Wanqing to come to Jiangnan, maybe there would be a possibility of them seeing each other soon.\u201cThe cool breeze is changeless, the autumn moon is ceaseless, and my melancholy seems to never end\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu remembered Zhou Botong and Qiu Qianren fighting all the way and rushing for thousands of miles. Now he also had his own movement technique, so on a whim, he decided to cross thousands of miles from Huashan to Jinling. He didn\u2019t even ride a horse or ride a carriage, but only relied on his pair of legs to perform his movement technique. (Yah, translating a poem is quite hard, but I think I did a good job here. I enjoyed the poem though.)At the beginning, he ran quickly with the movement technique of Traceless Sand Treading Steps. After running for dozens of miles, he became too tired to continue. Song Qingshu was quite shocked. He knew that his internal strength was already considered to be quite strong and abundant. It was not a problem to travel a hundred and eighty li, but he could not go further than that with the Traceless Sand Treading Steps. It seemed that Wei Yixiao was only good at short-distance running.After running for a few days, Song Qingshu suddenly had enlightenment in his heart, and began to pay attention to the efficiency of his internal energy utilization. Due his meticulous planning, the limit of a rapid rush broke through a hundred miles.Later, Song Qingshu only continued to improve. After running with the Traceless Sand Treading Steps, he often took a stick of incense time to change to ordinary movement technique, and used that opportunity to adjust his internal energy. After that, he continued to use Traceless Sand Treading Steps again. The level of his stamina began to get longer and longer.And after many days of extreme movement technique challenges, Song Qingshu\u2019s internal strength had also greatly improved, even faster than the growth rate of his usual martial arts practice. Song Qingshu was aware of the surging true qi in his body, and knew that he had reached its limit. Once he solved the problem of coexistence of Divine Brilliance True Qi and Nine Yin True Qi, he would be able to achieve a state of blending water and milk. His inner strength will surge, and it will never be exhausted.After five or six days, Song Qingshu finally reached the foot of Jinling City and secretly sighed, \u2018Two thousand miles, it took five or six days by myself, which is much slower than the train in my previous life.\u2019In fact he didn\u2019t have any idea about his own speed. He didn\u2019t realize just how terrifying this kind of traveling speed was in this world. Lu Yi, the world\u2019s fastest circulator of information, used all the power of a country to let their men ride the best horses, ring bells during the day, raise fires at night, and kill people. They had to shop for horses from several shops for their people, and travel in rain or sunshine, day and night. But even then the fastest transmission of the so-called one hundred thousand urgent information was only five hundred miles a day. But Song Qingshu had reached nearly four hundred miles a day with just his own two legs!\u2018If I can harmonize the yin and yang in my body, and always maintain the ultimate speed of Traceless Sand Treading Steps, I am afraid it will not be much slower than the plane from my previous life.\u2019 Song Qingshu dragged his tired legs into the city, secretly thinking about his speed. The more he thought, the more excited he became, \u201cThis is quite good considering it is in ancient times, but this travel speed is still too slow. And I don\u2019t even want to think about riding a carriage. It\u2019s so slow that it can make people vomit blood.\u201dAfter staying in an inn in the city, he quietly asked about the location of the Dagong Lane from an inn\u2019s employee. After a full meal, washing and cleaning up, when it was late at night, Song Qingshu quietly slipped out of the inn and walked through the secluded and dark places, and soon came to Dagong Lane.\u201cHuh, why is it deserted?\u201d Song Qingshu had a bad feeling in his heart, and he hurriedly jumped inside the building and walked to the firewood room where the treasure was located.After carefully searching, he quickly found the entrance to the cellar from the pyre. He pulled the plank aside, covered his whole body with true qi, and quietly jumped in while being on\u00a0 guard.With the help of the light from the torch, Song Qingshu discovered that the entire room was empty. He thought there could be another hidden room, so he looked around, but found that the surrounding walls were solid. Song Qingshu sat down on the ground with a dejected expression, and finally noticed some clues left on the floor. There were a lot of marks left from wooden boxes. At first glance it was clear that the boxes were filled with heavy objects and placed on the ground for a long time.\u201cWho moved these treasures?\u201d Song Qingshu finally gave up and returned to the inn with a heart full of doubts.The next day he ran to the lobby of the inn and ordered a few dishes, pricked his ears and listened carefully to the conversations of the surrounding guests. This place was a mixture of fish and dragons. The inn had always been one of the fastest circulators of information. Maybe he could get to hear some useful news from the conversations of drunk guests.Sure enough, he suddenly noticed a table where some people were talking,\u201cI heard that Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s Golden Serpent Camp has become so powerful in Shandong recently that even the Manchu emperor can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cMaster Yuan really brought honor for us Han people. Now that the Han people have fallen to the north of the Yangtze River, it is really rare to have such a great hero bravely resisting the Qing Dynasty.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t the Manchu and Qing Dynasty send envoys to form an alliance with our Song Dynasty? Will this affect the relationship between the two countries?\u201d\u201cYuan Chengzhi is a survivor of the Ming Dynasty, and he is not the son of the Great Song Dynasty. How could it affect the relations between the two countries? Speaking of this alliance, I am angry. We have shed a sea of blood and are filled with hatred. But, I really can\u2019t figure out why the emperor would form an alliance with the Manchus.\u201d\u201cBrother, this is what you don\u2019t understand. Now Mongolia is strong and has the potential to sweep through the world. We fought fiercely with Mongolia in Xiangyang and Sichuan. The Manchu\u2019s also fought Mongolia for a long time. The enemy of an enemy is a friend. Of course, the emperor must seize this opportunity to form an alliance against Mongolia.\u201d\u201cHmph, I still feel unhappy in my heart. I don\u2019t know when my Han people will be able to recover the past glory. The saints are currently blindly guarding the city. Instead, I feel that Yuan Chengzhi is more discerning and the hope of the Han people may fall on him!\u201d\u201cShhh! Your words are a crime of decapitation\u2026\u201d The speaker deliberately lowered his voice, and suddenly asked curiously, \u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cYuan Chengzhi led the Golden Serpent Camp and repelled the encirclement and suppression of the Qing soldiers several times, which shows his talent as a strategist. He is the number one in the wulin of Shandong, which shows his reputation and charm. Last time he used tricks and schemes to make great achievements. He even managed to acquire the treasure of Jinling city. This shows his wisdom and it also made the prefect of Jinling really angry, haha\u2026\u201dHearing this, Song Qingshu\u2019s heart felt cold. The treasure of Dagong Lane has been taken away by Yuan Chengzhi! That\u2019s right, his military expenditures at the Golden Serpent Camp are huge, and he created such a mighty force in Shandong in such a short period of time. It would definitely not work without astronomical military expenditures.Song Qingshu became very depressed, and was no longer interested in listening. He dropped a few pieces of silver and walked out dejectedly.\u201cAm I destined to not be the protagonist of this world?\u201d Song Qingshu was wandering blindly on the street, thinking that his plan was failing everywhere and he also failed to get the treasures here. From this, it was easy to infer that other treasures might also be taken due to various reasons. He was coming out empty handed for all kinds of strange reasons, and the more he thought about it, the more frustrated he became.\u201cGet out of the way!\u201d Accompanied by the crisp sound of bells, two horses galloped past him.Usually, Song Qingshu would stop to teach the people who came to the city center with horses to cause trouble, but he was very sad at this time, and he was not in the mood to be a chivalrous man. With a few quick steps, he barely managed to escape the two galloping horses.It\u2019s a pity that the people in front of him didn\u2019t have this good luck. \u201cFu*k! Who the hell dares to hit this Grandaddy?\u201d Hearing this arrogant voice, Song Qingshu thought that he would have a good show to watch. So he looked up with interest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: The thickest thigh in the bookOn the two horses, one white and one yellow, sat a pair of young man and woman. The young man was dressed in a yellow shirt, he was slender and tall. The young woman was elegant and beautiful. She had a dark complexion and was pretty, and her white dress was fluttering in the wind.\u201cWhat a well matched couple!\u201d Song Qingshu secretly admired them, but when he thought that these two were riding horses on the streets, he felt a little unhappy. Then he noticed that the two of their expressions suddenly turned a little dignified, so he followed their gazes curiously.It turned out that the person they collided with was also a young man, but with a big braid and wearing a full-fledged official uniform. He was probably still a high official in the Qing Dynasty. So Song Qingshu watched him shout and throw his arms about in all directions with interest.\u201cYou fu*kers, arrest them for me!\u201d Although the young man was not really hit just now, but it gave him a nasty fright. He looked back, and wanted to teach the culprit a hard lesson.\u201cWait!\u201d The young man looked back and saw a beautiful and energetic girl sitting on the horse. He became happy in his heart, \u2018I would be smiling in my sleep if I could be tangled by this girl\u2019s legs once.\u2019After making up his mind, the young man suddenly changed his tone and snapped his fingers left and right to stop his men, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you all? If there was an assassin doing the assassination just now, this young lord would have just kicked the bucket and go to see King Yama and my old man. Now look here! I was saved thanks to this little lady kindly reminding you stupid people to raise your vigilance.\u201d\u201cMaster Wei is wise\u2026\u201d The guards around the young man nodded and bowed, and quickly confessed their mistakes.\u201cWei Xiaobao?\u201d Song Qing gave him a weird look. At a young age, this young man was in an important position in the Qing Dynasty. If it wasn\u2019t Wei Xiaobao then who? He thought in his heart that this guy might be the Manchu-Qing alliance messenger mentioned by the dunkards in the inn just now.Wei Xiaobao finished teaching his subordinates, wiped saliva from his mouth and turned his head back to smile at the white-clothed girl, \u201cLittle lady, in order to thank you for your life-saving grace, this lord would like to invite the two of you to the restaurant in front of us.\u201dThe white-clothed woman had a bewildered expression. It was clear that she ran into him just now\u2026 But after hearing his words full of sincerity, she almost had the illusion that she really seemed to have saved his life.When the young man on the other horse saw Wei Xiaobao talking and staring straight at his cousin with questionable eyes, his heart surged in anger.Just now when he saw this young official shouting and scolding him, his identity seemed not small, and he became worried that today\u2019s affairs would not end well for them. But after seeing that this official didn\u2019t pursue the incident, instead he had ulterior motives about his cousin. He suddenly gave a cold reply, \u201cNo need.\u201dAlthough Wei Xiaobao still had a smile on his face, he had already begun to scold this guy in his heart, \u2018All my life I hated people more handsome than me. This little pretty boy and the little lady are sneaking glances at each other, I am afraid they have already hooked up and become an adulterous couple. If that\u2019s the case, then I guess it\u2019s time to use some extraordinary methods.\u2019Hearing the words of her companion, the woman in white also scolded, \u201cWe \u2018Twin Sword Heroes\u2019 hate sick perverts who lust after flowers the most, even more so for the dog officials of the Qing Court. If it weren\u2019t for us worrying about breaking the covenant between the Song Dynasty and you, we might have bestowed justice on behalf of heaven today.\u201d\u201cShui Sheng and Wang Xiaofeng?\u201d Song Qingshu remembered the identity of the two when she mentioned her family title. It seems that because of the influence of his deeds at Jingzhou, they had not met the Blood Saber Elder yet.\u201cI agree that I\u2019m really lustful, but where is this flower you speak of? Zhang Kangnian, have you seen any beautiful dark flowers in this world?\u201d When Wei Xiaobao said this, Zhang Kangnian and others had already roared with a wave of tacit laughter. \u201cIndeed. I have never seen any beautiful flowers that are dark.\u201dYes, as Wei Xiaobao said, Shui Sheng\u2019s skin tone was dark, but Song Qingshu smiled slightly at the notion. Shui Sheng was a bit dark, but her skin was even and delicate, and it didn\u2019t make people feel unsightly. What\u2019s more, that skin tone added a touch of healthy vitality to her charm. She was most certainly a beautiful girl.The \u2018Twin Sword Heroes\u2019 were young and vigorous. How could they take such insults lying down? Moreover, Shui Sheng was a young lady, and she directly swung her horse whip at Wei Xiaobao.\u201cBold! How dare you assassinate the envoy of the Qing Dynasty in broad daylight.\u201d In fact, just now Wei Xiaobao said all those things on purpose. He wanted to irritate the two of them and let them act first. Zhang Kangnian, his subordinate, had been working with him for a long time, so how could he fail to understand his intentions? He immediately drew out his sword and his people surrounded the \u2018Twin Sword Heroes\u2019.When Wang Xiaofeng saw that this matter was not going to end well, he quickly drew his sword and stepped forward to cover for Shui Sheng.The two groups clashed and fought for half a day, and Song Qingshu yawned in boredom from the sidelines. Now he has become one of the top masters in terms of martial arts in the world. How could this kind of little quarrel arouse his interest?The Kangxi Emperor sent Wei Xiaobao as an envoy to the Song Dynasty to discuss their alliance, and was worried about his safety, so he chose a large number of martial artists and powerful imperial guards from the palace to protect Wei Xiaobao.In normal circumstances, \u2018Twin Sword Heroes\u2019 were more than enough to punish some local ruffians and martial artists. But at this moment, they were facing a group of wolves and tigers, and the Imperial Guards showed their might.It didn\u2019t take long for the two to be subdued by the guards and pressed down in front of Wei Xiaobao, \u201cNow that the assassin has been caught on the spot, we seek the command of Lord Wei on how to deal with them.\u201dWei Xiaobao circled the two of them a few times, and wryly smiled, \u201cIn broad daylight, you two were going to assassinate the envoys of the two countries. There must be some conspiracy behind it. There must be a ring leader! Well, that\u2019s it. In order to prevent the two of them from colluding while confessing, I decide to separate the two for trial. Zhang Kangnian\u2026this man, tie him up and send him to the prefect of Song State and order them to strictly interrogate him. As for this woman, she will be tried by the Qing Dynasty. Who on earth wants to destroy the diplomatic relations between the two countries? We must find out!\u201d\u201cMy lord really is wise, it fills us with awe\u2026\u201d Zhang Kangnian led the guards and gave another flattery.The veins on Wang Xiaofeng\u2019s eyes almost burst open. As long as one was not a fool, it wasn\u2019t too difficult to figure out the scheme of his opponent. If his cousin were to be taken away by this beast, she would lose her innocence for sure!Song Qingshu knew that this guy was quite shameless. But he didn\u2019t expect this Wei Xiaobao to be more shameless and more direct than he was portrayed in the original book. But, it actually was more to his liking.There was a classic question on a website in his previous life. If you want to choose between Guo Jing and Wei Xiaobao as a friend, who would you choose?He didn\u2019t know how others would choose, but Song Qingshu was very clear, he would definitely choose Wei Xiaobao. The reason was simple, it\u2019s because Wei Xiaobao was a smart person.If you were his enemy, then you would end up miserable for sure. Just look at Liu Yizhou, his sweetheart was taken, and his life was also ruined. Another good example was Zheng Keshuang; the woman who loved him left him and he finally became a prisoner.But being his friend had many benefits, so there wasn\u2019t a need to list them all here.Does Guo Jing have friends? Except for that \u201cOld Imp\u201d Zhou Botong, he was sure that there were no real friends. But, Wei Xiaobao was different. When he needed help, he just had to raise his arms and waves of fox and dog-like friends would come to help one after another. This could be seen from the incident of \u201cTurtle Vanquishing Conference\u201d and Zheng Keshuang\u2019s evil rectification.In Song Qingshu\u2019s opinion, Wei Xiaobao is the thickest thigh in Jin Yong\u2019s fourteen books, so he must hug it tightly.It\u2019s just that this act of bullying men and women was a bit unpleasant. Song Qingshu frowned, and after all, he couldn\u2019t just come out and talk to the guy out of the blue. At that moment, when he was distressed about the possible ways of establishing relations with him, he saw a few bald monks waving a shining cold light. The saber rushed towards Wei Xiaobao from the dark without any warning!And Song Qingshu was overjoyed, \u2018God is helping me!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: No. 1 fighting master in Jin Yong\u2019s bookAlthough these monks were wearing robes, they couldn\u2019t conceal the ferocity of their faces. Coupled with the strange sabers in his hands, Song Qingshu immediately realized that these should be disciples of the Blood Saber Sect.\u201cWhy did the \u2018Blood Saber Elder\u2019 come to assassinate Wei Xiaobao?\u201d Song Qingshu was very puzzled. These two should have nothing to do with each other.However, Song Qingshu didn\u2019t plan to save these people now. It was not the right time to save them yet. The reason was, Wei Xiaobao\u2019s guards were full of combat power at the moment. Only when one was in a desperate situation, the effect of saving people could be maximized.You want to talk about chivalry and righteousness? Sorry, Song Qingshu had never been such a person.The martial arts of the monks in the Blood Saber Sect were far higher than the short sword welding guards, and Wei Xiaobao\u2019s imperial guards were finding it quite difficult to deal with them. Only relying on their numerical advantage would they be able to defeat the assassins.\u201cYoung Master Wei really has a knack for finding good companions during this trip to Jiangnan.\u201d With a long laugh, a middle-aged monk with a valiant face appeared on the roof, and he slowly swept across his shiny bald head with the back of a saber while speaking.Seeing that iconic action, and then hearing his way of speaking, Song Qingshu wondered if he was the Blood Saber Elder who was a heaven defying fighting master?In Jin Yong\u2019s novels, the Blood Saber Elder was certainly not the highest in terms of martial arts, but he had the most brilliant record. Faced with four masters of the same level as himself, he killed three of them and captured one, which made him gain the reputation of the number one fighter in wulin.Wei Xiaobao didn\u2019t know the name of the Blood Saber Elder, but when he saw him appear on the roof, he rubbed his ears that were sore from the sound of his laughter, and thought in his heart, \u2018Motherfu*ker, now this granddaddy\u2019s subordinates have to fight him too. We were at a tie even when fighting with the little monks. Now this new old monk has a \u2018I\u2019m a master\u2019 label on his forehead. As soon as he takes action, this poor Wei Xiaobao is going to lose his life.\u2019But, almost Immediately he pasted his trademark smile on his face, and he laughed, \u201cThis senior has a mighty and majestic temperament. At first glance, it is apparent that you are a man who appreciates flowers. This lowly junior loves making friends the most in his life. I just met a beautiful young lady today. If you fancy her, just take her away, you don\u2019t have to mind me.\u201dShui Sheng on the side made a strong voice of indignation, but it was a pity that her small mouth had already been blocked, and in the end it all turned into a whining sound.The Blood Saber Elder glanced at Shui Sheng with surprise, he unconsciously touched his chin back and forth with his hand, then nodded and said, \u201cWell, she\u2019s indeed a beauty! Hmm, her eyebrows are not open, and she is still a big girl with yellow flowers, not bad, this elder likes her.\u201dWei Xiaobao looked at him with admiration, \u201cSure enough, an expert is an expert. From such a distance, you can see that this little lady still has a pure body. Xiaobao\u2019s admiration for you is like a surging river, endless\u2026 \u201cThe Blood Saber Elder laughed again, \u201cIt is said that the Great Qing Dynasty\u2019s Lord Wei is a hero who could sell justice for money, and he really deserves his reputation when I saw him today. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that we serve different masters, this elder would really want to make friends with you, it\u2019s a pity. It is a pity.\u201dHearing what he said, Wei Xiaobao broke out in cold sweat, and he secretly regretted that he didn\u2019t bring that fathead, Lu Gaoxuan, or the brothers from the Heaven and Earth Society when he came here, otherwise he would not be so vulnerable. This Zhang Kangnian usually boasted so much, but was useless at the critical moment. \u2018If I can escape this time, I will definitely let Xiao Xuanzi drive you all back to your hometown\u2026\u2019While Wei Xiaobao was thinking about how to escape, his men had already been defeated by the Blood Saber Monks.Zhang Kangnian and Zhao Qixian led a few remaining guards in front of Wei Xiaobao, and their voices were a little trembling, \u201cWei\u2026Master Wei, the situation is\u2026somewhat bad.\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s not good, you moron, I can see it myself.\u201d Wei Xiaobao was speechless and cursed, \u201cThe others are all dead, why didn\u2019t you two suffer any injuries?\u201dZhang Kangnian and Zhao Qixian looked at each other and could only smile awkwardly.Song Qingshu saw that it was almost time. With Wei Xiaobao\u2019s wily nature, who knew whether he would suddenly be able to use his own skills to escape. At that time, his wishful thinking might just vanish in smoke.With a light cough, Song Qingshu walked out of the dark, looked at the group from Blood Saber Sect, shook his head and sighed, \u201cThe monks should be compassionate, and the masters here actually committed the killing precepts. It is really sinful.\u201dWhen Wei Xiaobao saw Song Qingshu, his eyes lit up. His ability to observe words and qualities were unmatched in the world. If he claimed to be second in the world, and no one would dare to say they are first.Mu Wanqing and even Feng Qingyang thought that the wooden sword on his back was a decoration, but Wei Xiaobao saw through it at a glance. \u2018Judging from his indifferent expression, it is obviously not a decoration!\u2019\u201cThis hero carries a wooden sword and looks like a master in the midst of masters. These evil monks have no Buddhist mercy at all. They want to kill us and I hope that the hero can save us.\u201d Wei Xiaobao gained confidence, and his attitude immediately took a 180-degree turn.\u201cHuh, quitting killing is a thing of your Central Plains Zen Buddhism, we don\u2019t have so many rules in the Tibetan Buddhism,\u201d The Blood Saber Elder hesitated, he looked at the wooden sword on Song Qingshu\u2019s back, and still asked, \u201cI say, this little brother, can you really hurt people with this wooden sword?\u201d Although he had never heard of a wooden sword used as a weapon, his instinct still made him subconsciously wary of Song Qingshu.\u201cYour Blood Saber can hurt people, but why can\u2019t my wooden sword hurt people as well?\u201d Song Qingshu faintly smiled, but he screamed in his heart. \u2018This kind of feeling of pretending to be an expert is really not bad!\u2019The Blood Saber Elder hesitated for a moment, but still ordered his disciples to attack. In these chaotic times, many sects in the Western Regions were looking for a powerful leader in their hearts. Most of them were interested in the stronger Mongolia, but it was a daunting task to take refuge in the domain of the monarch of Mongolia. Some people had taken refuge in the Ruyang King Cha Khan, who managed the Western Regions, while others had taken refuge in the more popular Kublai Khan. Tem\u00fcjin loved his seventh son, Ali Buge, and he would surely pass his position to him in the future.Currently, Ali Buge was staying in the Mongolian steppe and was at odds with the Manchus. This time they discovered that Kangxi Emperor sent his most trusted confidant, Wei Xiaobao, to the Southern Song State to discuss alliance matters.Ali Buge was worried that the alliance between the Manchus and the Song State would go smoothly, and his situation would become even more difficult. Knowing this, the Blood Saber Elder volunteered and led his disciples to go south and planned to intercept Wei Xiaobao in the Great Song Dynasty. As a result, not only would the Manchu and Song states fail to form an alliance, they might even start a war because of Wei Xiaobao\u2019s death. .Although his instinct told him that the eccentric young man in front of him was not an easy opponent, but time was running out, and he must finish the fight quickly and kill Wei Xiaobao before the Song Dynasty court could react. So he let the disciples take the lead and gauge Song Qingshu\u2019s abilities.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Birds of a featherThe second-generation disciples of the Blood Saber Sect, headed by Bao Xiang, were not weak in martial arts. In the original book, Ding Dian thought he would suffer if he had a head-on clash with the few of them. So he deliberately adopted a sneak attack tactic to gain victory.Song Qingshu didn\u2019t dare to be careless, the wooden sword flew out from his back under the shock of his internal strength, accompanied by a trace of inner qi.Bao Xiang and the others were taken aback. Song Qingshu took advantage of their dazed state, and lightly stepped on the ground, leaving only an afterimage, \u201cPop\u2026pop\u2026pop\u2026papa!\u201d After a few crisp noises, Bao Xiang and others only felt a pain on their wrist. Due to the intense pain, the blood sabers in their hands fell on the ground one after another, and when they looked up in amazement, Song Qingshu had already returned to his original place, and the wooden sword had been put in the sheath again.The truth of the matter was that Song Qingshu, as a modern person, was not used to taking lives yet. Just now, he just shot a few people\u2019s acupoints on their wrists with his sword, making them unable to regain their combat power in a short period of time.\u201cFu*k, it\u2019s a big shot!\u201d The Blood Saber Elder was baffled. \u201cThis little brat has higher martial arts than this granddaddy! Things won\u2019t be so easy to handle this time.\u201dWei Xiaobao on the side was even more dumbfounded and shocked, \u201cThis is a master. If I have his support, then I won\u2019t have to worry about Empress Dowager, that old witch, or the Mystic Dragon Cult leader Hong Antong, or Chengguan\u2026that old fart.\u201dSong Qingshu was very satisfied with Wei Xiaobao\u2019s reaction, because he originally planned to take advantage of Wei Xiaobao\u2019s momentum, and naturally needed to make him feel shocked by his strength.The Blood Saber Elder was caught in a dilemma. He was determined to succeed in this mission, but the opponent\u2019s martial arts was clearly higher than his own. He looked down and saw the expectant eyes of the disciples, and he was shocked, \u201cIf I retreat without a fight, then my prestige is sure to roll in the mud. It will be a big loss, and who knows what these wolves would do then.\u201dAfter making up his mind, the Blood Saber Elder stabbed down with his toe, and several tiles quickly flew towards Wei Xiaobao, who was watching the play. The tiles flew with the sound of splitting wind. If he was hit, even if Wei Xiaobao had a treasure armor on his body, he would at least be seriously injured if not dead.Song Qingshu was shocked. Wei Xiaobao was of great use to him now. He couldn\u2019t let him be injured here. He hastened his qi from the dantian to the acupoints on the shoulders, as the qi traveled through his arms, he put out his hands and performed a technique from the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms. It was \u201cThe Twin Dragons Fetch Water\u201d and the tiles flying in the air were sucked towards his palms.\u201cThis kid\u2019s internal strength is really terrifying.\u201d Thought the Blood Saber Elder, and taking advantage of the opportunity when Song Qingshu was saving Wei Xiaobao, he took a leap, brandishing the blood saber in his hand and slashed towards the immobilized Shui Sheng.Everyone on the scene thought that he would take the opportunity to assassinate Wei Xiaobao, who knew that he would attack a charming little lady with such a fierce strike!Song Qingshu was also shocked, and hurriedly jumped up, using The Dragon Soars in the Sky he hit the Blood Saber Elder\u2019s back while in the air.The Blood Saber Elder showed a sly smile. In fact he attacked Shui Sheng with a slash that looked fatal, but in truth, he held back the majority of his strength. He calculated that a young man like Song Qingshu would not bear to see a beautiful girl split into two. And he would definitely come to rescue in a haste, but the flaws caused by that hasty movement gave the Blood Saber Elder a chance.With a flip of his wrist, the blood saber in his hand moved from down to top and back. This gave Song Qingshu a serious fright. He was afraid that the Blood Saber Elder would hack Shui Sheng with his saber, and he would be too late to rescue her. So he unleashed an all-out attack on the Blood Saber Elder. He thought he only had to turn left and right to avoid him, but who knew that this old monk had reserved his strength from the start and was waiting for him to show a flaw. This backhand strike aimed at the lower part of his abdomen in an instant.Song Qingshu could only resort to performing the Cloud-Ascending Ladder with haste, allowing his figure to move up a few feet out in thin air. This allowed him to barely avoid the strike and his feet fell on the ground. He felt a chill in the place between his legs, and he thanked his luck in his heart. \u2019I was almost forced to perform the Devil Warding Sword Art.\u2019The Blood Saber Elder secretly cried out in his heart that it was a pity did not manage to hurt his opponent despite having such a great opportunity. He looked at the officers and soldiers of the Song Dynasty who were hurrying from a distance, and realized that it was no longer possible to succeed today. So he turned around and smiled, \u201cYour Excellency is a great martial artist. I hope to have a proper showdown in the future.\u201d After speaking, he performed his movement technique and ran away.The blood saber monks followed, and admired him as they ran away as well. Their master was able to fight this person to a tie, even gaining the upper hand!Song Qingshu was annoyed at the fact that his actual combat experience was still too bad. This Blood Saber Elder really deserved his reputation. Watching the Blood Saber Elder\u2019s figure going farther and farther away, he didn\u2019t want to chase him down. If he pressed the Blood Saber Elder into a corner, then it would most likely turn into a life and death fight.\u201cXiaobao thanks the mountain and waves hero for his life-saving grace.\u201d Wei Xiaobao casually dealt with the officials of Song State who came to provide aid, and hurriedly ran up to Song Qingshu.\u201cWhy call me that?\u201d Song Qing\u2019s expression turned extremely strange.\u201cYour martial arts is as high as a mountain. You can defeat those martial artists with just three punches and two kicks from the air. If this is not what a mountain and waves hero is, then I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d Wei Xiaobao continued to flatter him.Song Qingshu was dumbfounded by his level of flattery. Although he knew that this guy was full of lies, and he usually hated flatterers the most, but when this guy flattered him, the feeling he got while listening to him\u2026 seemed pretty good.\u201cI am not a mountain and waves hero. My surname is Song, and my name is Qingshu.\u201d He quickly calmed his mind and decided to introduce himself first. Then asked, \u201cMay I know your name?\u201d\u201cOh, the respected hero asked me for my surname,\u201d Wei Xiaobao didn\u2019t have contact with this tradition for many years, and Shui Sheng who was listening from the side secretly clicked her tongue, \u201cMy surname is Wei and my name is Xiaobao.\u201d\u201cIt turned out to be Lord Wei, the number one hero of the Qing Dynasty who captured Obai. I thought you were a young hero, when I first saw you today. It seems I was right.\u201d Song Qingshu made an expression of surprise and admiration.In fact, Song Qingshu\u2019s ability in flattery was really infamous as well. Over the years, even if Wei Xiaobao had not heard the same praise a thousand times, he had at least heard it hundreds of times.If this same praise had come from any other guy, Wei Xiaobao wouldn\u2019t care much about it at all. But the effect from the super expert in front of him was very different, and Wei Xiaobao was exhilarated when he heard it. The more he looked at Song Qingshu, the more pleasing he became.Rejecting the escort of the officials and soldiers of the Song State, Wei Xiaobao kindly invited Song Qingshu to the nearby Yuhua Pavilion for a drink. Song Qingshu pretended to refuse at first, but followed the group to the Yuhua Pavilion after a bout of half pushing.As soon as he took the seat, he heard a female voice full of disgust, saying, \u201cA pack of dirty dogs!\u201dIt turned out that Shui Sheng was also brought over by Wei Xiaobao\u2019s men. In order to look good, they released her shackles, but of course they still sealed her acupuncture points. Except for sitting at the wine table by herself, she didn\u2019t have any strength to do anything at the moment.\u201cWho is this girl?\u201d Song Qingshu asked while pretending to be ignorant.Wei Xiaobao chuckled and said, \u201cJust now this woman intended to assassinate this official, which led to the Blood Saber Sect\u2019s subsequent actions. This official suspects that she is a spy sent by Mongolia to disturb our mission.\u201d\u201cShameless!\u201d Shui Sheng was so angry that she became speechless.\u201cReally?\u201d Song Qingshu seemed to smile, \u201cThose Mongolian\u2019s sent such a beauty over, but don\u2019t you think she\u2019s a bit violent.\u201dEveryone at the banquet burst into laughter, and those laughter\u2019s were full of obscenities.\u201cSmelly thief!\u201d Shui Sheng gave Song Qingshu a fierce look. She was a little grateful that Song Qingshu had saved her life just now, but when she saw him praising Wei Xiaobao as a brother and eating on the same table, all her good impressions disappeared.Song Qingshu stopped what he was doing. He sat next to Shui Sheng with a glass of wine, and weirdly laughed, \u201cBeauty, you keep calling me a thief, but what did I steal from you? Or are you hoping for something lewd?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: The princess turns into a maid\u201cBah! You are full of foul language, and you said that you were not a thief.\u201d Shui Sheng spit at him, and Song Qingshu dodged and avoided it. \u201cAre you so anxious to let me taste your fragrance? Come, drink this cup first. Let\u2019s talk about wine.\u201d After talking to Shui Sheng, he filled her mouth with a glass of wine in his hand as she opened her lips.Wei Xiaobao on the side looked excited, thinking in his heart, \u2018I\u2019m not afraid that you have any strange hobbies, but I\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t have a hobby at all! Now it seems that this guy likes beauties, this is going to be easy!\u2019\u201cBig Brother Song, you and I seem to match quite well, do you want to become sworn brothers?\u201d Wei Xiaobao talked with Song Qingshu more and more, and opened his mouth to apply his usual tactics of wooing people.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu hesitated. Wei Xiaobao thought he would not agree, but Song Qingshu changed his tone. \u201cOfficial Wei is an extremely capable minister, and he can talk to me as a friend. It shows that he is brave and bold. How dare I refuse?\u201dWei Xiaobao was overjoyed. Kangxi asked him to recruit experts from the wulin some time ago. This time, by chance, he ran into Song Qingshu. Since they became brothers, wasn\u2019t that the same as getting a helper?He got up quickly and pulled Song Qingshu to the side, asked him about his age, and vowed, \u201cI, Wei Xiaobao, today became brothers with Song Qingshu. In the future, we will share blessings and difficulties together\u201dSong Qingshu noticed that he hadn\u2019t played any tricks in the oath, so he did the same,\u00a0 \u201cI, Song Qingshu, today I became brothers with Wei Xiaobao. In the future, we will share blessings and difficulties together!\u201dWei Xiaobao has always had a talent for fooling people, but this time he was afraid that the other party would notice some flaws, which would cause dissatisfaction and affect the relationship between the two. The truth was that the Kangxi Emperor was in urgent need of martial arts talents from the wulin. Kangxi wished for it, so how could he be willing to offend a master just because of some details? Besides, if he had such a powerful martial artist as big brother, no matter what he thought, it would not be considered a disadvantage.Of course, he was not entirely honest. He didn\u2019t dare to say in his oath that they would die in the same year, the same month, and the same day. In a flash, Wei Xiaobao smiled again and began to chat with Song Qingshu.This was also in line with Song Qingshu\u2019s wishes, \u2018Wei Xiaobao is obsessed with drinking all the time, but I practice authentic internal skills. He is destined to die earlier than me\u2026\u2019\u201cBig Brother Song, I think you were very interested in this woman just now. So let\u2019s give her to my elder brother as a gift from this younger brother.\u201d Although Wei Xiaobao felt a little distressed, he had always been generous while attracting people. Although Shui Sheng was beautiful, he was not that fascinated by her. Of course, if it was a great beauty or something, he would definitely not give up.\u201cBastard, you should die!\u201d Shui Sheng cursed excitedly when she heard it.\u201cOh,\u201d Song Qingshu raised his eyebrows and glanced at Shui Sheng with disgust, \u201cThank you, Brother Wei, but this lady has a bad temper. It would be impossible for her to be a concubine, well, I\u2019ll just barely accept her. I\u2019ll let her be a girl who does rough work.\u201dSong Qingshu frowned and looked at Wei Xiaobao as he spoke. Our Lord Wei was a perceptive person. He immediately knew that the other party had said this deliberately, and was afraid that he would accidentally offend him, so he laughed and said in cooperation, \u201cWell, she does have long hands and feet. Her body is also quite strong, she should be suitable to be a maid.\u201dSong Qingshu secretly breathed a sigh of relief. It was convenient to deal with smart people. It was Shui Sheng, on the other hand, who yelled at him. He could only shake his head in secret.She was also a human being. But why was she so stupid? He was obviously trying to save her. Otherwise if she was caught by Wei Xiaobao, it was inevitable that she would lose her innocence.\u201cWhy did I have to go and save her?\u201d Song Qingshu felt that Shui Sheng was too noisy, and sealed her mute acupoints, and started to have a headache.\u201cIf you stop scolding, I will unseal your acupuncture points. If I unseal the acupuncture points and you still curse, don\u2019t blame me for blocking your mouth with rags. If you agree, just blink.\u201d Song Qingshu suddenly got a clever idea. After thinking about it, he turned around and said to Shui Sheng.When Wei Xiaobao saw Shui Sheng blinking her big watery eyes, he was about to have a cramp. He thought Brother Song really had a way with women. It was exactly the same as when I dealt with a small princess in the palace.While thinking about this and that, Wei Xiaobao had a sudden realization. Looking at Song Qingshu\u2019s handsome face, he muttered in his heart, \u2018Oh fu*k! Brother Song, why would you have to be a pretty boy? And so good at picking up girls as well. If my wives get wooed by him and put many different green hats on my head, won\u2019t I, Wei Xiaobao, become the most ridiculous big turtle egg in the world?\u00a0(In Mandarin Chinese, calling someone a turtle egg is a very serious insult. The suggestion is that turtles do not know who their fathers are, so it is a slight towards the mother\u2019s honour.)Song Qingshu didn\u2019t know that Wei Xiaobao had so many thoughts in his mind in such a short period of time. He let out a cold snort and moved his finger to unseal Shui Sheng\u2019s acupuncture point. Shui Sheng immediately turned her face to another side.\u201cNow that you belong to me, I don\u2019t know your name yet.\u201d Song Qingshu didn\u2019t get annoyed, picked up a glass of wine and looked at her with a smile, and asked.\u201cBah, shameless, who belongs to you!\u201d Shui Sheng turned her head and glared at him. She thought that this guy was even more hateful than the dog official of the Qing Dynasty.\u201cBrother Wei has given you to me, then you are naturally my people.\u201d Song Qingshu drank the wine in his hand and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t say your name. I\u2019ll just have to choose a new name, what should I call you? Lovely\u2026kitty or doggy.\u201d\u00a0(Chun\u2026Ama or Agou.)Song Qingshu let out a cold sweat, and secretly applauded his wit. He almost used Wei Xiaobao\u2019s name just now!\u201cHuh, your name is kitty and doggy!,\u201d Shui Sheng hesitated for a while, a little worried that this guy would really give her such a bad name, and said, \u201cMy name is Shui Sheng.\u201dWei Xiaobao didn\u2019t say anything yet, but Song Qingshu was waiting for these words, he pretended to be shocked, and said, \u201cIs Shui Dai, one of the four wonders of the South, your father?\u201dSeeing Song Qingshu mention her father\u2019s prestige, Shui Sheng became proud, and she said while raising her small face, \u201cI advise you to release me quickly. As soon as my dad gets the news, he will chase after you with my uncles. Then you several dog thieves will die without a place to bury your corpses.\u201d\u201cIs her father very famous?\u201d Wei Xiaobao looked at Song Qingshu suspiciously.In order to make him nervous, Song Qingshu deliberately exaggerated his words, \u201cHer father and his few brothers are very famous in Jiangnan, and they are called \u2018Luohua Liushui\u2019\u00a0(falling petals and flowing water).\u00a0They are a group of four martial artists from orthodox sects. They are all powerful martial artists, not under the Blood Saber Elder we saw just now. I think we\u2019d better let her go to avoid unnecessary trouble.\u201d\u201cA group of martial artists called Luohua Liushui?\u201d Wei Xiaobao thought to himself, \u2018I gave this woman to Brother Song. If we were to send her back, Brother Song would definitely be upset even if he doesn\u2019t say anything on the surface. It\u2019s a good opportunity to show good will.\u2019Thinking of this, Wei Xiaobao immediately smiled and said, \u201cBig Brother Song should not worry, isn\u2019t it just a few unimportant men in Jinling City? His daughter is suspected of assassinating this Qing Dynasty envoy. I will send someone to inform the Jinling prefect to catch him. Lock him up and be tortured to see if there are any other comrades.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: The goddess from the moonShui Sheng was so scared that her flower-like face turned deathly pale. As the so-called prefect had a higher status than a mere country magistrate. Her father, on the other hand, was just a somewhat famous martial artist, and if the imperial court really wanted to deal with the Shui family, then it may really be exterminated.Song Qingshu was also dumbfounded. He originally thought that Wei Xiaobao was greedy and fearful of death, so he wanted to push the boat along the river and let Shui Sheng go, but he didn\u2019t expect that it would play out like this.Noticing that Shui Sheng was sufficiently scared, Wei Xiaobao chuckled, and changed his words, \u201cBut, if you become the maidservant of Brother Song, then this official will not hold you and the Shui family accountable for this matter due to the face of Brother Song. You have been given a way out, now it is up to you to decide what to choose.\u201dShui Sheng\u2019s expression looked uncertain, and finally she bit her silver teeth and unwillingly spoke up, \u201cI will be his maid!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more like it\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao spoke to Song Qingshu with satisfaction, \u201cBrother Song, come, let\u2019s continue drinking.\u201dSong Qingshu glanced at Shui Sheng with a wry smile, and then began to drink with Wei Xiaobao.That night, the group rested in Yuhua Pavilion. The local prefect was worried that Wei Xiaobao would have an accident on his own domain, so the Yuhua Pavilion was reserved for the mission to rest at night, and a platoon of heavy armored soldiers were sent to guard the Yuhua Pavilion to prevent the assassins from coming again.When Song Qingshu returned to the room while slightly drunk, he found Shui Sheng, who had her acupuncture points sealed. She was sitting quietly on the bed, then she hurriedly raised her head and looked over, her eyes full of fear and weakness.\u201cThat Zhang Kangnian\u2019s martial arts is nothing to speak of but he is really considerate.\u201d After Song Qingshu was slightly surprised, he soon realized that this must be the masterpiece of Zhang Kangnian and Zhao Qixian.\u201cOh\u2026how sweet, did you take the initiative to warm up my bed?\u201d Song Qingshu sat down at the table in the middle of the room, picked up the teapot and poured a cup of tea. After drinking it all at once, his expression suddenly became clear.\u201cSmelly thief!\u201d Shui Sheng glared at him bitterly.Song Qingshu smiled, got up, and came close to Shui Sheng. When he sat down, he clearly felt her body tremble slightly, \u201cYou women are so stupid. If you stupidly curse like this. It will only provoke a man\u2019s desire to conquer.\u201dUnder the effect of wine, Song Qingshu reached out and touched her cheek, feeling a smooth and soft texture. She was very attractive.\u201cAh!\u201d Shui Sheng exclaimed, her tone full of panic, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201dSong Qingshu was taken aback, then became conscious and thought what was wrong with him, was this happening because he hadn\u2019t tasted meat for a long time?But watching a beautiful woman sitting on her bed without resistance, especially those slender legs. Shui Sheng was used to riding a horse, but it didn\u2019t cause any issues with her legs, instead it made her thighs round and full. Song Qingshu felt that there seemed to be an evil little devil constantly shouting in his heart,\u00a0\u2018Pounce on her, press her down, tear up her dress, enjoy her\u2026\u2019Song Qingshu felt that a certain thing of his body seemed to have raised its head, so he quickly jumped up, and sat back on the chair in the middle of the room.He didn\u2019t want to do anything he would regret. Also, he sensed that there seemed to be a master breaking through the layers of blockades of officers and soldiers outside and entering inside the Yuhua Pavilion.In order to calm down his body\u2019s excitement and deal with the coming enemy, Song Qingshu drank another cup of tea. Helooked back at Shui Sheng, who seemed grateful for escaping this disaster, and said, \u201cMiss Shui, in fact, you don\u2019t need to be so afraid of me.\u201dShui Sheng turned her head and ignored him, but she felt very angry. She saw the lust in his eyes just now, so as a girl, how could she not be afraid of him?\u201cMiss Shui, I am in a good mood today. I will teach you an effective way to guard your innocence. Will you listen?\u201d Feeling that the little dragon between his legs was still quite aggressive, Song Qingshu sighed and had no choice but to make a unique move.Although she didn\u2019t believe that he would be so kind, Shui Sheng still turned her head curiously, \u201cWhat method?\u201d\u201cWhen a bad guy tries to take off your dress next time, you just have to wait for the right time to discharge some waste material\u00a0(shit\u2026literally), and it is expected that no one with a sane mind will have any desires for you.\u201d As soon as these words came out, Song Qingshu breathed a sigh of relief, and the little dragon finally became tame.Shui Sheng felt nauseated in her stomach, opened her mouth to vomit, and stared at Song Qingshu bitterly, \u201cDisgusting, nasty, shameless\u2026\u201d\u201cI just wanted to give some valuable advice, whether Miss Shui values her image more than her innocence is completely up to her own choice.\u201d Song Qingshu laughed, picked up the wooden sword. He came to the window, and pushed it open to look out.He discovered a graceful figure in the dark night, and Song Qingshu immediately knew that this person must be a young woman from her beautiful and slender curves.\u201cA young lady, who is so good at martial arts. Who could she be?\u201d Song Qingshu took a look and thought about it in his mind.He noticed that the woman\u2019s movement technique was very polished, and she didn\u2019t make the slightest sound while traveling through the air or landing on the ground. If Song Qingshu\u2019s internal strength wasn\u2019t so strong as it is now, he wouldn\u2019t be able to detect her subtle movement.Suddenly the dark clouds dispersed, and a ray of moonlight shone on half of the woman\u2019s face. To Song Qingshu, it felt like her eyes were bright and shining, her complexion was white and her face was bright and innocent.\u201cUnder heaven, above the earth!\u201d Song Qing dumbly looked at her and muttered to himself, \u201cCould it be that a goddess descended on this earth?\u201dBut Song Qingshu soon dispelled that notion, and discovered that the goddess-like figure quietly headed towards Wei Xiaobao\u2019s resting place, and along the way, her attacks were extremely vicious. Before the guards had time to snort, they were taken down by her with a sword slash.\u201cShe\u2019s quite cruel!\u201d Song Qingshu secretly smacked his tongue. Seeing that she was about to rush into Wei Xiaobao\u2019s room, Song Qingshu quickly activated his internal energy and slapped on the hilt of the wooden sword.The woman was about to break in, when she heard a sharp sound of breaking through the air, she quickly turned back and retreated three feet away.She looked at Song Qingshu who came out of the house, and then at the wooden sword that was three inches deep into the pillar, the woman\u2019s expression suddenly became solemn.\u201cThis lady who came down from the moon, like a goddess, with unparalleled beauty, but how come you are sneaking around like this\u2026.\u201d As Song Qingshu was talking, he shockingly discovered that a poisonous needle had been shot right towards him, so he quickly jumped up, rising up in thin air. And barely escaped a catastrophe.Before Song Qingshu even had the time to take a breath of relief, the woman had already attacked again, with a sword as thin as an iron needle. It shot towards Song Qingshu\u2019s lower body, attempting to make several fatal holes.After integrating the Five Sacred Mountain Sword Art with his martial arts, he was able to fight against the sword sage Feng Qingyang. So, Song Qingshu\u2019s swordsmanship could be said to have reached the realm of a master. He immediately knew that her swordsmanship was extremely powerful, it was not something he could take lightly.His true qi shot out from his dantian, and his whole body twisted in the air using the \u201cThe Divine Dragon Swishes its Tail\u201d from the Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms. Song Qingshu could not bear to harm such a beauty who seemed to have come out of a painting, so he kicked at the woman\u2019s arms with his toes. It seemed like a ruthless attack, but he deliberately held back quite a bit of strength.The woman was also shocked. At the exact moment when her left hand came in contact with Song Qingshu\u2019s toes, she barely managed to dodge it from an incredible angle.Song Qingshu was greatly surprised. With his knowledge of swordsmanship, the timing and strength of his kicks were just right. He thought that his opponent would only have to give up the sword in her hand, but he did not expect that the opponent would have the ability to escape.However, although the woman was able to counter Song Qingshu\u2019s offensive, she was also forced back into the courtyard by the counter-shock force. At that moment, the guards had already been alarmed and pulled out their sword to surround the woman.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: The beauty and her swordThe woman was trapped, with swords in all directions, but she was not flustered at all, with graceful footwork, all the sword strikes of the guards smashed into empty air. But each movement of her sword would take away the life of a guard.Wei Xiaobao had already been alarmed by this time. Zhang Kangnian and Zhao Qixian drew their swords to protect him. Wei Xiaobao watched with trepidation, \u201cFu*k, it\u2019s a woman! This girl surely came aiming for this Xiaobao\u2019s life. Zhang Kangnian is only good at flattering. If he were to fight against her for real, then he won\u2019t stand a chance.\u201dLooking back, Wei Xiaobao felt a little relieved when he saw that Song Qingshu had come to him. After this terrible shock, the woman\u2019s stunning appearance did not leave any ripples in Wei Xiaobao\u2019s heart. It will be a blessing for him if he is able to protect his precious life.As the moment passed by, more and more guards arrived and the woman knew that she couldn\u2019t do anything anymore, so she decided to leave while she had the chance. He had already seen through her intentions from her movements, so Song Qingshu knowingly smiled . When he was about to help her, his eyes glanced at a pair of archers coming over.Song Qingshu was shocked. He didn\u2019t expect that the Jinling prefecture would have so much money. One must know that the sharpest and the most effective weapon for officers and soldiers to deal with martial arts masters was bows and crossbows. Using these weapons they could shoot and turn their opponents into hedgehogs.Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t bear to see this fairy-like character die like Xiang Xiaoyu here. So, he quickly raised his hand and sucked the wooden sword inserted on the pillar into his hand, \u201cThe assassin is getting away!\u201d He yelled and rushed forward.The woman also noticed that the archer was coming over, and was anxious. When she saw the young man with unpredictable martial arts rushing over just now, her heart sank, and she knew that today, there would be no good end for her.Originally, she had many adventures during this time, and made great progress in her martial arts. This time, she discovered that Wei Xiaobao did not have any top masters. When something happened, he just ran away and hid behind others. But, she didn\u2019t know that she would meet Song Qingshu and would be trapped here.Song Qingshu was holding a wooden sword, but his swordsmanship was so exquisite. The officers and soldiers around looked at him with admiration. Zhang Kangnian and Zhao Qixian were also watching and explained to Wei Xiaobao,\u201cMaster Wei, this Master Song\u2019s swordsmanship is really tricky and mysterious, no ordinary swordsmanship can match up to him.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, the sword in the woman\u2019s hand is extraordinary, but it can\u2019t hurt the wooden sword in Master Song\u2019s hand. It shows just how shocking Master Song\u2019s internal strength is.\u201d\u201cObviously it is due to Master Song\u2019s exquisite swordsmanship, the wooden sword does not touch the woman\u2019s sharp sword at all, and he looks for flaws every time and stabs the woman\u2019s body in key points!\u201dWei Xiaobao secretly wiped his sweat, \u201cFu*k my rotten luck, this time\u2019s trip as an envoy is really proving to be unfavorable for me. After I\u2019m done with this, I have to go to the temple to donate a little more and pray for good fortune. Fortunately, this Xiaobao\u2019s life is strong and I got acquainted with Brother Song.\u201dThe chat between Zhang Kangnian and Zhao Qixian reached the ears of the soldiers in the courtyard, and they nodded secretly, admiring Song Qingshu, who only used a wooden sword to confront the enemy.However, the woman in the confrontation had a different feeling. At first, she had the same thoughts as the others in the scene, but later she noticed that when the opponent was about to stab her, his sword strikes suddenly changed. Due to the speed being too fast, Song Qingshu\u2019s clever swordsmanship, and the low martial art level of the rest of the people in the scene, no one actually noticed this flaw.The woman didn\u2019t understand the reason behind her opponent\u2019s show of mercy. Then she remembered that when the archer had just rushed in, he immediately jumped out to fight with her, so he did that to protect her!Sure enough, Song Qingshu took advantage of this fight, and sent a secret message, \u201cMiss, wait a while and do your best to use your movement technique to run out of here. I will help you.\u201dAfter speaking, Song Qingshu looked at her for a flaw, parried her sharp sword with his wooden sword, did a few complicated gestures with his left hand, and a palm strike struck her shoulder like thunder.To the woman, this palm seemed as fast as lightning, and she was struck with a tricky energy. She felt her body was slammed against the courtyard wall by a strong force. She would be a fool if she didn\u2019t understand the other party\u2019s intentions. So, she had an idea, and she deliberately forced out a mouthful of blood. Her blood sprayed in the air as she turned around and bitterly spoke, \u201cYour deed today will be repaid in full in the future.\u201d After speaking, she disappeared into the night with her movement technique.\u201cHurry up!\u201d Wei Xiaobao yelled anxiously, and thought in his heart, \u2018Brother Song can\u2019t protect me day and night. It would be really bad if such a martial artist woman is always after this Xiaobao\u2019s life. What should I do!\u2019The world was so big, a goodbye today was probably a goodbye forever. Song Qingshu also wanted to take this opportunity to catch up and have a chat with the beauty. After hearing Wei Xiaobao\u2019s voice, he volunteered and said, \u201cBrother Wei, I will chase her.\u201d After speaking, he chased the woman in the direction she disappeared.The woman had travelled quite far. With a touch of her toe, she lightly flew out a few feet, it was similar to the Minute Ice Ripple Steps. Her posture was also very graceful, like a snow speck devoid of dust.Suddenly, the woman stopped and looked back at the man behind her with alertness. She was quite shocked in her heart,\u00a0\u2018My Hundred Divine Steps have very few equals in the world, and I was still overtaken by this man.\u2019\u201cThis girl\u2019s movement technique is truly otherworldly. I have encountered many people in this world, but this girl\u2019s movement technique is the fastest of them all.\u201d At the moment, Song Qingshu had put the wooden sword behind his back to show that he had no hostility.\u201cThank you for your help just now.\u201d The expression on the woman\u2019s face eased, and a small smile appeared at the corners of her lips. \u201cMay I know why you are chasing me?\u201d\u201cMay I know if this Miss wants to hear the truth or lies?\u201d Song Qingshu didn\u2019t wait for her to respond, and then said, \u201cThe lie is that Wei Xiaobao wants to catch you, the assassin who makes him lose his sleep, so I volunteered to chase her. \u201c\u201cWhat about the truth?\u201d The woman smiled slightly and stared at Song Qingshu with a scorching gaze.\u201cNaturally, the truth is that I don\u2019t even know this lady\u2019s name, and I\u2019m not content to remain as a stranger.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s words made the woman\u2019s heart jump. She didn\u2019t expect that he would express his favor to herf so directly.The woman remained silent for a moment and did not answer directly. Instead, she asked, \u201cYour martial arts attainment is so high that you have few opponents in the wulin, and in terms of swordsmanship you can be regarded as a master of this generation. Why would you take refuge in a Manchu Dog Official? Why not other forces?\u201d\u201cAlthough I personally don\u2019t like the Qing Empire, but for now they have some part to play in my plans, and I personally like Wei Xiaobao, that slippery little bastard.\u201d Song Qingshu has always been clear about his plan, and he was willing to use Wei Xiaobao\u2019s influence. Apparently, he was thinking of the treasure in the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters.The woman stared at him for a long time, as if she was searching for the truth in his words. Song Qingshu deliberately broke the silence and asked, \u201cWhy did the young lady want to assassinate Wei Xiaobao? As far as I know, although he is a bit cunning and shameless, he has never done any great evil, so it shouldn\u2019t take an expert like this young Miss to come personally and assassinate him.\u201dAfter saying that Song Qingshu\u2019s heart suddenly clenched,\u00a0\u2018Could it be that this woman was also harmed by Wei Xiaobao\u2019s sinister methods?\u2019\u00a0 But he subconsciously shook his head , unwilling to think about this cruel possibility anymore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Love triangle\u201cI personally have no grudges against him.\u201d The woman slowly spoke her words, her expression became cold, \u201cIt\u2019s just that Manchu and I have an irredeemable hatred. He is Kangxi\u2019s right-hand man, who accepts bribes and abuses his power. Even if it is not personal, killing him would be a just cause.\u201dThe woman secretly added a sentence in her heart, \u2018This is probably the last time I will be able to help \u201chim\u201d before I leave. From now on, the two of us will be separated from each other, and there is a high possibility that we will not see each other again.\u2019\u201cA young, beautiful, and powerful woman who has enmity with the Manchu Qing Dynasty?\u201d Song Qingshu searched through the characters from the original book in his heart. Suddenly, there was a flash of inspiration in his heart, and he leaned slightly to whisper something.The woman frowned and looked at Song Qingshu vigilantly, \u201cWho is your Excellency and why do you know who I am?\u201dSong Qingshu calmly glanced at the beautiful woman in front of him, with his eyes full of pity.Ajiu was a very pitiful character in the original book. She was born in the family of the last emperor, her country was lost and her family was destroyed. Her own father cut off her arm and she herself fell in love with Yuan Chengzhi. It was a pity that Yuan Chengzhi had already made an alliance with Xia Qingqing. After Chaoyang Peak, she agreed with Yuan Chengzhi to stay on the Tibetan border and waited for him for ten years.Everyone knows the ending. After ten years, whether it was because of Xia Qingqing or not, Yuan Chengzhi had never gone to look for her anyway. In the end, she became a Buddhist nun.Ajiu felt that Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes were full of strange emotion when he looked at her, and she felt extremely uncomfortable for a moment, so she coughed slightly.Song Qingshu returned to his senses and awkwardly smiled, \u201cLady Ajiu must not be suspicious. This one has always been familiar with the happenings of wulin, so I can guess who you are.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t asked your surname yet. May I know your name?\u201d Ajiu felt that her background and circumstances were clearly known by the other party, but she didn\u2019t know anything about him, so she couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cThis humble is surnamed Song, and my given name is Qingshu.\u201d Song Qingshu gave a slight salute and asked to clear the doubts in his heart, \u201cLady Ajiu and the Manchu Qing dynasty have hatred of spanning the country and family. But now she is risking a war between the Song and Qing Dynasties by assassinating the envoy of the Qing court in the territory of the Song Dynasty. I wonder if she has any other agendas?\u201dAjiu noticed his dissatisfaction with her actions in his words, she then assumed that he was a citizen of the Song State, and couldn\u2019t help but explain, \u201cMaster Song misunderstood. Ajiu had rushed this matter and lacked consideration before, but I had no intention to start a war. Just a few days ago, I inadvertently discovered that Wei Xiaobao had a second mission. His main purpose was actually to deal with Golden Serpent Camp. I was worried\u2026 I was worried that the last banner against the Manchu Qing Dynasty would also fall, so I planned to assassinate Wei Xiaobao and contribute to our people.\u201d\u201cLady Ajiu is probably doing this for Yuan Chengzhi, the current leader of the Golden Serpent Camp.\u201d Song Qingshu looked at her with a smile. Although he had never seen Xia Qingqing, he determined that her talent and appearance would definitely not be better than Ajiu. How much determination Yuan Chengzhi had to make when he finally gave up on Ajiu. Although this was unfortunate for Ajiu, but for other men, it was extremely lucky.After he saw through the intentions of the young lady, Ajiu felt a little embarrassed and shy. After all, she was a loser in the love triangle between Yuan Chengzhi, Xia Qingqing and her.\u201cI have tried my best, and the rest is up to Brother Yuan. So I can only wish him good luck.\u201d Ajiu smiled sorrowfully, then raised her head and said to Song Qingshu, \u201cThank you for your mercy today, Master Song. Ajiu has important things and needs to rush to Western Regions as soon as possible. I must bid my farewell. If fate decides, we will meet again in the future.\u201d\u201d If fate decides\u2026we will meet again.\u201d Song Qingshu didn\u2019t have any reason to keep her, so he could only reluctantly watch her fluttering figure slowly disappear into the night sky.He went back to Yuhua Pavilion, and Wei Xiaobao noticed that Song Qingshu had come back alone. He knew that he hadn\u2019t caught the assassin, but he didn\u2019t show any dissatisfaction. Instead, he cared about his health and warmly asked him, \u201cIs Brother Song injured?\u201dSong Qingshu casually replied, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brother Wei, this brother failed to catch the assassin.\u201dWei Xiaobao\u2019s expression turned weird, and he thought in his heart,\u00a0\u2018Your martial arts is obviously higher than that of that woman. Maybe you were obsessed with lust, and you secretly let her run away.\u2019Noting Wei Xiaobao\u2019s expression, Song Qingshu knew that he was suspecting his words in his heart, and ordinary lies might not be able to deceive him, so he had to tell him the half-truth, \u201cI had already restrained the assassin, but it was a pity that a black masked martial artist suddenly jumped out to help her. And the assassin ran away. The man had superb internal strength, strange and clever swordsmanship. By the way, judging from his martial arts skills and weapons, he should be Yuan Chengzhi, the famous \u2018Golden Serpent King\u2019.\u201d\u201cYuan Chengzhi?\u201d Wei Xiaobao took a deep breath. He somewhat believed this explanation in his heart. He thought to himself,\u00a0\u2018I had a secret mission to deal with the Golden Serpent Camp by the Emperor\u2019s secret decree. Did that information get leaked?\u2019\u201cSo how does Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s martial arts compare to Brother Song?\u201d This was Wei Xiaobao\u2019s biggest concern. The reason why Kangxi Emperor and him were so eager to recruit masters from the wulin was to deal with Yuan Chengzhi, a martial artist who was so powerful.\u201cWhy\u2026is Brother Wei going to deal with Yuan Chengzhi?\u201d Song Qingshu was not in a hurry to answer, but looked at him curiously.Wei Xiaobao wanted to rely on him to deal with Yuan Chengzhi anyway, and sooner or later Song Qingshu had to know about this, so he led Song Qingshu to the house and whispered Kangxi Emperor\u2019s secret order to him.\u201cHey, Brother Song, you and I have become brothers. We will enjoy blessings and endure hardships together, so I do not want to hide from you.\u201d Wei Xiaobao deliberately sighed several times, with a sincere expression on his face. \u201d After I helped the Emperor get rid of Obai, I thought the emperor could sit back and relax, but I didn\u2019t know why the Emperor was still frowning all day long. Onc day, I had the courage to ask him what was wrong along with another old man, and then I learned about the Emperor\u2019s four secret troubles.\u201dWei Xiaobao paused after speaking and deliberately asked, \u201cBig Brother Song, can you guess the Emperor\u2019s four troubles?\u201d\u201cThe Manchu Qing Dynasty is at a stalemate with Mongolia, and Mongolia should be one of them.\u201d Song Qingshu could only think of this one.\u201cBig Brother Song is really smart,\u201d Wei Xiaobao gave a thumbs up, and then said, \u201cHowever, Mongolia is ultimately an external trouble, and the other three are all internal troubles. One of them is Wu Sangui, the king of Pingxi who is stationed in Shanhai Pass. He is quite capricious. The emperor has been worried about him. He worries that he would betray the Ming Dynasty, and hand the Shanhai Pass over to Mongolia. Now he holds hundreds of thousands of elite soldiers, including 10,000 of the most elite cavalry troops in the world today, the Guanning Iron Cavalry. So, it is not easy for the Emperor to make a move against him for a while.\u201d\u201cThe other problem is Hongli, Prince Sheng Jingbao. The first emperor handed down the throne, he and the current Emperor were the\u00a0 most qualified princes to be crowned. Finally, with the help of the Queen Mother, the Kangxi Emperor became the Emperor. But Prince Bao has been coveting the throne. He never gave up. He now holds hundreds of thousands of Eight Banners Soldiers, and his son Fu Kang\u2019an is also a good fighter. Those father and son have fought against the Mongolian army on the front line of Liaodong for many years, and their prestige in the army is very high. The emperor is afraid of the possibility\u2026what if they decide to take action? It will be a huge problem.\u201d\u201cThis world is really chaotic. Prince Sheng actually became brothers with Kangxi, and they were still fighting for the throne\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu was stunned as if struck by thunder, but what abnormality hadn\u2019t he seen during his time here? He quickly accepted all this, joined the conversation and said,\u201cThe third problem must be the Golden Serpent Camp in Shandong. The Shandong rebel forces are very powerful under the leadership of Yuan Chengzhi. The emperor certainly has no worries about Wu Sangui and Hongli for now, so he chose to deal with him first.\u201d\u201cNot bad!\u201d Wei Xiaobao nodded. \u201cThe emperor has been trying to suppress the rebels in Shandong for many years. Unfortunately, when the officers and soldiers arrived, they all retreated into the vast mountains. When the officers and soldiers retreated, they came out like mountain rats.\u201dWei Xiaobao took up a cup of tea to moisturize his throat, and continued, \u201cThis motherfu*ker is a huge pain in the ass! Yuan Chengzhi even seized the opportunity to severely inflict losses during the imperial court\u2019s actions against the rebel army several times, making the court very angry. They became even more arrogant after that. Then the emperor gave up on the idea of encirclement and suppression of the rebel army and considered using the method of wulin to deal with Yuan Chengzhi.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that Yuan Chengzhi is also a disciple of the Mount Hua Sect. He is the leader of the Golden Serpent Camp and comes from a famous family. Moreover, His martial arts skills are so high that it is rare in the world. That\u2019s why brother Wei and the Emperor are so eager to recruit masters in the wulin.\u201d Song Qingshu added.\u201cHehe, I can\u2019t hide anything from Big Brother Song,\u201d Wei Xiaobao smiled, \u201cMay I know what happened between Big Brother Song and Yuan Chengzhi just then?\u201dSong Qingshu didn\u2019t actually fight against Yuan Chengzhi. He could only roughly evaluate Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s martial arts from the original book and Ajiu, and said indifferently, \u201cIt was a tie.\u201dHe knew that if he said that Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s martial arts was higher, it would make Wei Xiaobao look down on him. On the other hand, if he said that his own martial arts is higher, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to explain the matter of how Ajiu was rescued. In the end, he could only give a moderate answer.Wei Xiaobao was overjoyed and said, \u201cYes, not bad. With Brother Song, a master who can match Yuan Chengzhi, it is worth it to be brothers with you.\u201dSong Qingshu was moved in his heart and took the opportunity to persuade him, \u201cBrother Wei, although my martial arts is equal to Yuan Chengzhi, but now the news that you have to deal with him has been leaked. What\u2019s more, you must pass through the Shandong boundary on the way back to the Capital, and there is also the Blood Saber Sect. Brothers, I am afraid that it will be hard to compete with four hands with my two fists, and I will not be able to protect the safety of my brother.\u201dWei Xiaobao was taken aback, then he cried out with a look of horror, \u201cThis is bad! This time it is clear that the enemies will attack. So, the only solution is to call the army for escort. But this way, the Emperor will definitely be unhappy.\u201dWhen Song Qingshu saw that it was almost time, he pretended to hesitate and said, \u201cI have a plan. Will my brother listen to it?\u201d\u201cBig Brother Song, just say it and I will listen.\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s eyes lit up and expectantly looked at him.\u201cBrother Wei can make Zhang and Zhao escort the envoy to the north with great fanfare and attract the enemy\u2019s attention, and we two will go down to the south.\u201dBefore Song Qingshu could finish speaking, Wei Xiaobao interrupted him and asked, \u201cWhy go south?\u201d Wei Xiaobao wondered,\u00a0\u2018Is this little pretty boy hiding some agenda?\u2019Song Qingshu was not in a hurry, and slowly explained with a faint smile, \u201cAt the moment, Gusu has a peerless master. If you can convince him to take refuge in the Qing Dynasty, we will be accompanied by another martial arts master. Then you won\u2019t have to fear anyone, let alone the Shandong\u2019s Golden Serpent Camp.\u201d\u201cHow does his martial arts skill compare to Brother Song?\u201d Wei Xiaobao asked with half-belief.\u201cNot inferior to me.\u201d Song Qingshu said with a calm manner.Wei Xiaobao couldn\u2019t help but feel his heart move. If he could find such two masters who have such a high level of martial arts, the Emperor would definitely want them.\u00a0\u2018Then he might reward me, with a title of high nobility, and as for entertainment\u2026\u2019\u00a0\u00a0Thinking of all the beauties, Wei Xiaobao didn\u2019t hesitate and laughed loudly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: The wrong bed in darkness\u201cOkay, I will travel with Brother Song and go to Gusu. Zhang Kangnian, Zhao Qixian?\u201d Wei Xiaobao raised his head and shouted.\u201cThis humble one is here, what is the order of Lord Wei?\u201d When the two heard Wei Xiaobao\u2019s call, they opened the door and spoke with a flattering smile.\u201cYou find someone to pretend to be me, make a big fanfare, and travel as usual. Brother Song and I will go to Suzhou first.\u201d Wei Xiaobao took out a handful of cash and divided it among the two. \u201cGet the brothers to cheer up. This time the situation is very dangerous. Be careful about everything.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really a blessing for us to have such a compassionate superior as lord Wei.\u201d Zhao Qixian said with a smile.\u201cIsn\u2019t it! With the Duke, life is so easy\u2026\u201d Zhang Kangnian suddenly gave himself a slap on the mouth, \u201cLook at my memory, it\u2019s lord Wei now.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, stop flattering, you can go and get ready.\u201d Wei Xiaobao waved his hand to let the two of them go prepare first.After seeing the two closing the door, Song Qingshu\u2019s expression seemed as if he just remembered something, and suddenly spoke up, \u201cBy the way, Brother Wei, this time we should travel lightly. If we take that chick from the Shui family with us, it would be a bit of a hindrance\u2026\u201dBefore Song Qingshu even finished speaking, Wei Xiaobao looked at him as if he was looking at a monster, \u201cBig Brother Song, you are willing to kill such a beautiful and pretty woman?\u201dSeeing that he had misunderstood what he meant, Song Qingshu said with a black line on his forehead, \u201cI mean it\u2019s better to let her go\u2026\u201dWei Xiaobao thought to himself,\u00a0\u2018If only a big man accompanied me along the way, the journey would be so boring.\u2019\u00a0And he subconsciously refused the notion, \u201cAren\u2019t we trying to hide from people\u2019s eyes and ears? The people in Golden Serpent Camp shouldn\u2019t know that there is a woman in the mission. On the other hand, she will be useful to hide our identity even better. Besides, if we are in a hopeless situation, we can still take that girl as a hostage. Isn\u2019t that Yuan Chengzhi full of benevolence and righteousness? If an innocent woman dies and he does nothing, his prestige would be greatly damaged\u2026\u201dSong Qingshu glanced at him in surprise. He used to think that Wei Xiaobao was just clever and a profiteer, but after meeting him he realized just how clever he really was. This guy\u2019s thoughts moved much faster than ordinary people.\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll just follow Brother Wei\u2019s intention and take her with us.\u201d Song Qingshu thought that what he said was reasonable, and now that Wei Xiaobao expressed this thought himself, then he couldn\u2019t outright disagree with it.*****Back in the room, when Song Qingshu wanted to unseal Shuisheng\u2019s acupuncture points, the corner of her lips showed a sly smile, and stretched out her delicate hands, in a blink of an eye, she tapped a few major acupoints on Song Qingshu\u2019s chest .\u201cHow did you unseal your acupuncture points?\u201d Song Qingshu was thinking about other things at the time, and didn\u2019t realize that Shui Sheng was just pretending to be weak.\u201cHuh!\u201d Shui Sheng wrinkled her pretty nose, jumped off the bed, tidied up her clothes, and proudly said, \u201cTheir acupuncture skills are nothing special, plus this lady\u2019s martial arts is very strong. I just opened the acupuncture points with force.\u201dSeeing that the situation was not good, Song Qingshu chuckled, \u201cMiss Shui, since you are free, please leave by yourself. If you are discovered by them later, you won\u2019t be able to leave.\u201d\u201cWhy would this lady leave?\u201d Shui Sheng sat down with a big grin, and poured a cup of tea to quench her thirst just like Song Qingshu did before. As soon as the tea entered her mouth, she suddenly remembered that Song Qingshu had also drunk from this cup, and with a \u201cBah, baah\u2026\u201d She quickly spit it out.\u201cWhy won\u2019t you leave?\u201d Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t figure out the reason behind her actions, and a thought came up in his heart, \u2018Could it be that this girl developed Stockholm syndrome after being kidnapped?\u2019Of course Shui Sheng had hidden the fact that she planned to escape as soon as she unsealed her acupuncture points, but after just walking two steps, she found officers and soldiers everywhere. With her average level martial arts, how could she escape? So, she had to go back to the room and think about a solution. But before she could think of anything, she heard the voice of a guard greeting Song Qingshu not far away. Then she had an idea, she lay back on the bed, pretending that she was still immobile.When she noticed Song Qingshu staring at her with a weird expression, Shui Sheng thought of his disgusting appearance from before, so she stopped hitting him, and stretched out her dainty little foot to kick and cursed, \u201cYou dirty thief you bullied me. Now, I\u2019ll teach you what happens if you bully me.\u201d\u201cMiss Shui, you are calling me bad names one by one. If this is heard by someone who doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. I\u2019ll be fine, but what will people think of you, as a girl?\u201d Song Qingshu said with a smile.\u201cYou dead turtle, rotten turtle, big bastard, smelly dog\u2026 you are the cause of it all.\u201d Shui Sheng was taken aback, thought that it actually made sense, and became even more angry, she used her hands and feet to hit Song Qingshu again.Although being hit by the fists of a flower-like girl was enjoyable rather than painful, but Song Qingshu didn\u2019t want to leave her shoe prints all over his body. How could he have the face to see people tomorrow if that happened? Song Qingshu turned his head, and deliberately coughed, \u201cBeauty, don\u2019t blame me for not reminding you. A master like me can easily unseal my acupuncture points. If you continue to hit me, maybe my acupoints will be unsealed.\u201dShui Sheng was really bluffed by him. She quickly stopped her hand, and was shocked, \u2018If he really unsealed his acupuncture points, it would be bad.\u2019 The more she thought about it, the more uneasy she became. She clicked a few acupoints on his leg, and then got up and thought.\u00a0\u2018I have to find a rope in the room to tie him up.\u2019But she didn\u2019t find anything that could be used to tie after looking around. So, she sat back on the bed and was secretly sulking. Suddenly, her eyes lit up and she turned around and started to untie her waistband.\u201cBeauty, do you want to be violent to me?\u201d Song Qingshu made a frightened look, \u201cIyada! I don\u2019t want my first time to be like this?\u201d\u201cBah!\u201d Although Shui Sheng didn\u2019t understand what he was yelling, she knew it was definitely not a good thing, so she glared at him viciously, \u201cIf you yell again, I will take off your socks and stuff them into your mouth.\u201d\u201cMy socks are sour and smelly. It really doesn\u2019t have a good taste. But, you are a beautiful woman, if you take off your socks and put them in my mouth. I promise you that I will not talk again.\u201d Song Qingshu stared at Shui Sheng with a sleazy pair of eyes.\u201cDisgusting, shameless!\u201d Shui Sheng was trembling with anger, and quickly tied his hands behind his back with her untied waistband, and finally tied him tightly around the head of the bed twice.\u201cWell, it smells so good~\u201d When Shui Sheng bound him, her hair inevitably brushed over Song Qingshu\u2019s face, and Song Qingshu seemed intoxicated.Seeing that Song Qingshu had been properly\u00a0 tied up by the waistband, and his acupuncture points had also been sealed by her before, Shui Sheng finally felt relieved and looked back at him bitterly, \u201cIf you talk nonsense again, I will really put your socks in your mouth! \u201cThe fact was, a proper lady such as Shui Sheng didn\u2019t want to take off a man\u2019s shoes and touch his stinky socks with her hands. If she couldn\u2019t do that|; then she would have to use her own socks to gag him. But, she felt sick when she even thought about it. So Shui Sheng threat was just to scare him.\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t talk, I won\u2019t talk!\u201d Song Qingshu quickly closed his mouth tightly, as if he was very obedient.Shui Sheng finally patted the dust on her hands with satisfaction. Her nerves were tense for the whole day. Now that she could relax, she felt sleepy. She turned around and confirmed that Song Qingshu was firmly tied to the shelf beside the bed. She then planned to rest for a while, replenish her energy and find a way to escape when the guards were most sleepy at dawn.Song Qingshu saw her take off her boots and set up the quilt on the bed. He couldn\u2019t help but give her a weird look, \u201cBeauty, it is very dark here, be careful while sleeping on the bed. Don\u2019t forget that this is my room.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: The events before the beauties meet\u201cIf you don\u2019t speak, no one will think you are dumb.\u201d Shui Sheng snorted. \u201cThis lady will sleep for a while. Don\u2019t blame me for not warning you. If you yell and call the guards over, then I would be dead anyway, but I will definitely stab you to death first. At worst we will both die.\u201d Shui Sheng raised the knife she had just taken out of her boots.Looking at the bright dagger in front of him, Song Qingshu asked strangely, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you stab me to death just now? Aren\u2019t you more afraid that I will reveal your plot?\u201dShui Sheng blushed, and she thought to herself,\u00a0\u2018Although this person\u2019s mouth is a bit dirty, he didn\u2019t do anything bad to me after all. So how can I kill him?\u2019\u201cAh, I see,\u201d Song Qingshu cried out in surprise, \u201cYou must have seen that I am young and handsome, with a high level of martial arts, and you secretly fell in love with me\u2026heh\u2026eh.\u201dShui Sheng was startled by his fake surprise and she didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry when she heard his nonsense. She couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and took out her embroidered cloth from her arms and put it into Song Qingshu\u2019s mouth.\u201cFinally calm\u2026\u201d Shui Sheng took a long breath, lying on the soft bed, she wrapped her body with the quilt, and closed her eyes with a peaceful expression on her face.In her sleep, Shui Sheng felt a little bit cold, and she unconsciously leaned back to a place that seemed warm. She felt that it was warm like a bearskin coat, so she shrank into a ball and let it cover her whole body.Early in the next morning, a scream broke the tranquility of dawn. It turned out that Shui Sheng woke up and found that unbeknown to her Song Qingshu was sleeping behind her back. What\u2019s more, her head was resting on his arm, and her body was shrinking in his embrace like a little bird, which made her almost collapse. What was even more shameful was her own hand was pulling his big hand, allowing it to cover her soft mounds.Pushing away his thigh that was on her waist, Shui Sheng pointed to Song Qingshu with a pale face, \u201cYou\u2026you\u2026you\u2026\u201d At the moment, she couldn\u2019t even speak a complete sentence.\u201cMiss Shui, I did remind you, to be careful of getting on the wrong bed.\u201d Song Qingshu opened his eyes and looked at her with an innocent expression.\u201cDidn\u2019t I seal your acupuncture point? I also tied you up\u2026\u201d Shui Sheng looked around with disbelief.\u201cAre you looking for this?\u201d Song Qingshu took out a light blue ribbon from his arms. It was the same one from yesterday; the one that Shui Sheng untied from her dress and tied his hands. He then took it to the tip of his nose and smelled it, \u201cI am a master. So, naturally there is a way.\u201dWatching as Shui Sheng grabbed it in a panic, and tidying up her messy dresses, Song Qingshu rested his head on his hands, lay on his side on the bed. He looked at her, and spoke in a leisurely manner, \u201cMiss Shui, in fact, you don\u2019t need to be so nervous at all. Last night, I was better than Liu Xiahui. I didn\u2019t do anything, just\u2026\u201d\u201cJust what?\u201d Shui Sheng\u2019s eyes were cold, staring at him nervously.\u201cIt\u2019s just that someone rubbed my arms desperately last night and took the initiative to guide my hand to hold her breast\u2026\u201d\u201cStop talking!\u201d Shui Sheng felt extremely embarrassed, her teeth clenched, and tears fell.Shui Sheng\u2019s big eyes turned red with tears, Song Qingshu still couldn\u2019t bear to watch her continue to feel sad, \u201cCrap, what\u2019s the big deal about a maid warming the bed for her master? Hurry up, come here and help your master change clothes.\u201dShui Sheng glanced at him bitterly, she jumped out of the bed, turned her back, and didn\u2019t want to talk to him again.Song Qingshu was not worried, and after finishing wearing his clothes, he said, \u201cMiss Shui, thank you for not killing me last night, so I decided\u2026\u201d\u201cTo let me go?\u201d Shui Sheng looked back in surprise.\u201cAlthough I do have the idea of letting you go, but now I really want to experience what it\u2019s like to be served by a very charming maid. So, to create a balance between the two, I decided that, if you will serve me well for some time, then I will let you go free.\u201d Song Qingshu looked at her with a smile.\u201cShameless!\u201d Another layer of frost shrouded Shui Sheng\u2019s face.\u201cYou really have a dirty mind.\u201d Song Qingshu cried injustice, \u201cListen up, being a maid is a sacred profession, OK? In the Western Continent, there is a nice alias for it, that is, a maidservant\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu was lost in his memory for a moment, but soon came to his senses and continued to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you to be a lowly servant, so what are you worried about?\u201dShui Sheng thought about it carefully, and realized that although Song Qingshu was tied up with his acupuncture point sealed last night; he was probably just acting to cooperate with her. The difference of strength between the two was too great, and it seemed unlikely that he wanted to let her escape. \u201cYou want me to serve you? You expect me to just believe your words. But, if you are a man without conscience, wouldn\u2019t this lady be serving you for a lifetime?\u201d Shui Sheng suddenly raised her head and said coldly.Song Qingshu was not at all affected by her cold voice, but instead he noticed the change of her tone, and said cheerfully, \u201cI have always been an honest and righteous young man\u2026 Uh, what is with your expression, don\u2019t roll your eyes! Alright, since you don\u2019t believe me, then I will set another deadline. After almost half a year, I will let you go. Of course, if you serve me very well and let me enjoy some intimate comfort, then I can also let you go in advance.\u201d\u201cOkay, it\u2019s a deal!\u201d Shui Sheng said indifferently.\u201cYou\u2019re like a cute puppy.\u201d Song Qingshu swaggered into the chair and patted his arm, \u201cHere, come and squeeze it for your master.\u00a0 Last night, I was used as a pillow by someone all night long, and now my arm is sore and painful.\u201dThinking about the soft and warm pillow last night, Shui Sheng blushed, she twisted her body, walked over, and said, \u201cOh, is it here?\u201d\u201cA little bit down, yes\u2026 yes\u2026 a little bit less strength, oh~\u201d Song Qingshu felt that his arms were ironed with an iron, and nothing was improper; It was far from comfortable. But, still he felt great.Of course, it was not because of how brilliant Shui Sheng\u2019s technique was. After all, no matter how much she tried, she couldn\u2019t compare to the experts that Song Qingshu had been to in his previous life.The source of all the pleasure lay in the identity of Shui Sheng. It felt really refreshing to think that she, a young miss who had never done any rough work since she was a child, had to now massage his shoulders.\u201cI don\u2019t know how it would feel if any noble lady or princess gave me a massage.\u201d At this moment Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but ponder the possibility.*****When Wei Xiaobao saw Shui Sheng standing obediently behind Song Qingshu, his pair of eyeballs almost fell off. He pulled Song Qingshu to a side and smiled, \u201cBig Brother Song is really a master, and he managed to tame this little hot pepper in a single night!\u201dWei Xiaobao didn\u2019t know any martial arts, and he deliberately didn\u2019t avoid Shui Sheng, so all his words were heard by her. Shui Sheng glanced at the gloating Wei Xiaobao, and she really wished to beat him to death.After breakfast, Zhang Kangnian, Zhao Qixian and all the envoys embarked on the road to the Capital with great fanfare, but Wei Xiaobao quietly followed Song Qingshu out of the back door and rushed towards Gusu.\u201cHey, there are no carriages and no horses. How far can we go like this! Shuang\u2019er, I miss you so much.\u201d After a while, Wei Xiaobao bitterly complained.\u201cHow useless!\u201d Shui Sheng grumbled disdainfully. He was the cause of all of her current misfortune. Of course Shui Sheng wouldn\u2019t give him a favorable look.\u201cSmelly girl, what are you talking about?\u201d Wei Xiaobao glared at her fiercely, and then began a fierce scolding war.Those hundreds of words are omitted here.Shui Sheng was a big girl with little experience, she was no match for Wei Xiaobao, who came from the streets. Soon, her cheeks were flushed with anger, and her eyes were tearful, wishing to kill him with a sword.Song Qingshu secretly smacked his tongue when he heard it all from the sidelines. It was embarrassing to walk in front of Wei Xiaobao with all this farce going on.With a light cough, he interrupted their scolding war. Song Qingshu deliberately showed off in front of them. For Wei Xiaobao, he wanted to increase his weight in the other party\u2019s heart. For Shui Sheng, it was a matter between man and woman. It was all instinctive.\u201cIt\u2019s too slow to walk like this, you get closer, and I will take you to Gusu.\u201d Song Qingshu spoke up.The two came over suspiciously, Song Qingshu\u2019s left hand grabbed Shuisheng\u2019s waist, and his right hand lifted Wei Xiaobao by his shoulder, then he used the Traceless Sand Treading Steps while carrying them. The three of them quickly disappeared into the distance like a wisp of blue smoke.She was hugged by Song Qingshu and before Shui Sheng could say something, she screamed. She realized the terrifying speed they were traveling. Looking at the trees that quickly disappeared behind her, Shui Sheng looked up and stared at Song Qingshu\u2019s profile with a complicated expression, \u2018Cousin is far worse than him in terms of talent, appearance and martial arts\u2026Oh, Shui Sheng, what are you thinking about\u2026\u2019Unlike Shui Sheng\u2019s complicated thoughts on the side, Wei Xiaobao shouted out with a \u201cyoo\u2026hoooo\u201d. He looked very excited and thought in his heart,\u00a0\u2018If I had such a good movement technique, who could stop me in the future?\u2019Wei Xiaobao was someone who would do it if he thought of it, and immediately asked, \u201cBig Brother Song, can you teach me this movement technique?\u201dSong Qingshu smiled bitterly and said, \u201cThis movement technique is extremely labor intensive. Brother Wei, you don\u2019t have the slightest foundation for internal arts, so you can\u2019t learn it.\u201d\u201cOh~\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s disappointment was overwhelming. He turned around and noticed that Song Qingshu was gently holding Shui Sheng in his arms, but he was holding him by his shoulders, and he couldn\u2019t help but angrily think, \u2018This pretty boy just doesn\u2019t want to share the goods, so you don\u2019t want to teach me.\u2019Song Qingshu was also a master at observing words in his previous life. As soon as he spoke, he was worried about hidden grudges. So, he quickly added, \u201cActually, I know that there is a superb martial skill in the wulin, which can be performed without any internal force. It is very suitable for Brother Wei.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s spirits revived all of a sudden.\u201cGod really works in mysterious ways.\u201d Song Qingshu faintly spat out a few words, \u201cIt\u2019s the Iron Sword Sect\u2019s martial skill, and even more coincidentally, the Yuan Chengzhi we are going to deal with just happens to be in possession of it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good, then it won\u2019t take much effort.\u201d Wei Xiaobao smiled, \u201cIf we catch him in the future, he will be severely tortured and asked about this movement technique.\u201d\u201cBrother Wei is really smart by nature. Every word that comes out of his mouth is worthy of quoting.\u201d\u201cBig Brother Song, many of those words just naturally come to me. Some of them are from what I read from a book in the past.\u201d*****After a long time on the road, Song Qingshu was still halfway away from Gusu territory. After all, Song Qingshu was carrying two people with him. So, suddenly he felt a little tired and stopped to take a break.\u201cShouldn\u2019t we enjoy a little while travelling?\u201d Wei Xiaobao took out a thick stack of silver bills. \u201cBig Brother Song is good at martial arts, but your money is definitely not as much as mine. Don\u2019t be polite with me today. Pick the most expensive things. Waiter, bring out your best tea and snacks one by one.\u201dThe three of them sat down in the private room on the second floor, and Shui Sheng muttered, \u201cVulgarians.\u201dSong Qingshu admired Wei Xiaobao\u2019s arrogance and generosity. He was about to compliment him when he heard a loud voice from downstairs, \u201cMiss Mu, I have already spared your life several times. You should be grateful to this monk.\u201dGoblin: Please consider becoming a patron at\u00a0Patreon\u00a0if you enjoy reading my translation. The amount doesn\u2019t matter, your gesture does.

I specially like Frosts way of writing.Anyway, I write poems of my own when I get inspired, or affected by something. They are nothing special, but they contain how I felt at that particular moment in time. I decided to share some of them with you. You can find them in the projects menu.

    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: The gathering of the four giantsSong Qingshu\u2019s heart skipped a beat, and when he looked downstairs, he saw two men and two women walking in.A monk of about fifty years of age, with commoner shoes. He seemed to have bright brilliance on his face, and he had the gait of a high level master.The other one was a young man, who looked like a prince of a dynasty. He had a\u00a0 jade crown and a gentle temperament. He was looking at the side profile of the girl in red clothes next to him with an awed expression on his face.The girl lightly frowned with a timid look. It was Wang Yuyan, who he had met at Manduo Mountain Villa some time ago.Not far away from them, a girl in black dress clasped the hilt of her sword tightly, and followed him in an unhurried manner. It was Mu Wanqing, who he met at Mount Hua before.\u201cMaha Cakra Vajra, as a consummate Buddhist please be merciful and exercise tolerance. Why should the great sage be angry with a little girl, why not come up and have a glass of water and wine?\u201d In Song Qingshu\u2019s previous life, he often encountered arty business partners who believed in Buddhism. So he had to expend effort to study some Buddhist knowledge, that\u2019s why he could tell the origin of Maha Cakra Vajra in just one word.\u00a0(Goblin: Maha Cakra Vajra is Jiumozhi\u2019s title.)\u201cD\u00e0l\u00fan M\u00edngw\u00e1ng\u2019\u201d was\u00a0the transliteration of the Sanskrit \u201cMaha Cakra Vajra\u201d. Jiumozhi did not expect that someone in Jiangnan would recognize him at a glance. When he looked up, he saw that it was just a youth. With a heart full of doubt, he brought Wang Yuyan and Duan Yu upstairs. Behind them was Mu Wanqing. When she saw Song Qingshu, there was a hint of joy in her eyes, but soon, as if she had thought of something unpleasant, her expression darkened, and her thoughts became complicated.\u2018What\u2019s this! Where did such a beautiful woman come from? If this beautiful woman was given to me as a wife, I would disagree even if the Emperor offered me his position. I, Wei Xiaobao, will go to hell and back, bear wind and rain. But, no matter what, I have to marry this girl as my wife!\u2019 As soon as Wang Yuyan arrived upstairs, Wei Xiaobao felt as if he was hit hard on the chest by an invisible heavy hammer. His mouth turned dry and he became dumbfounded for a while.A man\u2019s instinct made Duan Yu immediately realize the covetous meaning in Wei Xiaobao\u2019s eyes, and he subconsciously put himself before Wang Yuyan, blocking her from the other party\u2019s heated gaze.Noting his behavior, Mu Wanqing felt a pain in her heart, and sat down next to Song Qingshu in a fit of anger.\u201cAfter our farewell at Mount Hua, I didn\u2019t expect that we would meet again so soon.\u201d Song Qingshu turned and looked at Mu Wanqing. The beauty of this girl was not diminished, except that flower-like face seemed a bit tired.\u201cSister Wan, does this man know you?\u201d Duan Yu noticed that the relationship between the two seemed a little unusual. Although Mu Wanqing was now his own sister, he still felt uncomfortable in his heart.\u201cHe is my husband!\u201d Mu Wanqing even shocked herself when she said this.It turned out that her beloved became a real brother, and Mu Wanqing\u2019s heart was broken. When she heard that Duan Yu was captured by Jiumozhi at Mount Hua, she hurried to rescue him. How could she know that her former lover was so fast to change his heart? He was obsessed with that Wang girl.Duan Yu\u2019s change of heart and its quickness made Mu Wanqing\u2019s heart turn cold. At this time, seeing Song Qingshu, Mu Wanqing felt a little warmth in her heart. Of course, these words were more deliberately spoken to Duan Yu and the aim was to anger him.Just now due to his sight being blocked, Wei Xiaobao didn\u2019t have the opportunity to look at Mu Wanqing, and when he saw her, he couldn\u2019t help but start comparing the two women back and forth. He couldn\u2019t help but praise her beauty and said, \u201cBig Brother Song, sister-in-law. She\u2019s really beautiful!\u201d But in his heart, he thought that it was a pity. Being a brother meant you have to be loyal as well,\u00a0\u2018She looks so beautiful. If she was not my elder brother\u2019s woman, I would get her no matter what.\u2019Jiumozhi had no time to watch a group of obsessive men and women vying for favor and being jealous. So he decided to speak up with his palms folded together, \u201cI wonder if this young noble has some things to say?\u201d\u201cThe great monk used his \u2018Flame Blade\u2019 technique to wipe out the Dark Cult in Tubo. He shocked the West. What is even more rare is that he has great wisdom, is proficient in Buddhism. He is a person who has been respected by many for a long time. How can I dare to talk about anything disrespectful?\u201d Song Qingshu smiled modestly.\u00a0(Goblin: Tubo is the ancient name of Tibet.)Jiumozhi\u2019s face lit up. If this young man just praised his martial arts, he would not feel anything. After all, there are not many people who have seen him in action in the Central Plains wulin. Although he praised his martial arts for the most part, he respected him for his knowledge of Buddhism as well, and that could not be faked.When Wang Yuyan saw Song Qingshu, her eyes lit up, and she happily asked, \u201cYoung master Song, have your injuries been healed?\u201d\u201cThank you Miss Wang for your directions that day. I have indeed recovered my broken meridian.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled kindly at her.\u201cSo you know each other.\u201d Kumazhi snorted, but was not worried. Among the people in the audience, it was easy to notice at first glance that the braided person didn\u2019t know any martial arts. The woman standing behind him has limited martial arts, and he did not put Mu Wanqing in his eyes. The young man opposite of him is probably a bit tricky, but considering his young age, his martial arts would not be that high no matter what.\u201cThis Song once received great kindness from Miss Wang. Now that I am witnessing Miss Wang in crisis today, although I am inferior in terms of martial arts, I have no reason to stand by. If there is any offense, I hope that the great monk will forgive me.\u201d This was not actually Song Qingshu\u2019s true thought. In fact, he wanted to fight him, and take the opportunity to let Wei Xiaobao see Jiumozhi\u2019s martial arts level. But, a part of what he had said before was also true. If he could return Wang Yuyan\u2019s favor in the process, then why not do it.\u201cBenefactor Song is talented and handsome, and he has the gait of a righteous hero. This poor monk cannot help but admire it. It\u2019s a pity that this poor monk needs to ask the girl Wang for something important, so I will have to offend you.\u201d Jiumozhi talked elegantly, as if he was the model of a true Taoist monk. .\u201cBrother Wei, this is the master I mentioned to you before. Take a closer look. It will be up to you later to convince him to join us.\u201d Song Qingshu softly whispered in Wei Xiaobao\u2019s ear before standing up.When the two masters confronted each other, their clothes rustled in the wind. While the fight was commencing here, somewhere a thousand miles away, there was a major event happening that would affect the life and death of Song Qingshu and Wei Xiaobao.*****Deep in the mountains of Shandong, the leader of the Golden Serpent Camp, Yuan Chengzhi, watched the three people in the camp as if facing an enemy, \u201cEveryone gathered here are from the Golden Serpent Camp. May I know what you people are doing here?\u201dNo wonder he was nervous. One of the people opposite him was the leader of the Liaodong\u2019s Heavenly Dragon Sect, another one was the leader of the Qinghai\u2019s Blood Saber Sect, and the last one was from one of the four major Tibetan Tantric Sects. These martial arts masters had already issued a greeting message in advance. It seemed that they were not malicious, but the three of them came together, so it was still making Yuan Chengzhi feel vigilant.\u201cWhy should the Golden Serpent King be so aversive against us? Now we have a common enemy. We should be friends and not enemies.\u201d The Great Master Shangjie was white and fat, and he always had a smile that seemed like it wasn\u2019t really a smile.\u201cPlease forgive Yuan for his ignorance, I don\u2019t understand your meaning.\u201d Yuan Chengzhi said calmly, but his heart skipped.\u201cWhy should the Golden Serpent King pretend to be confused?\u201d Heavenly Dragon Sect leader Hong Antong solemnly said, \u201cWe are here for the matter of Wei Xiaobao. I heard that Wei Xiaobao\u2019s mission at the southward alliance is false, and his true goal is to deal with your Excellency.\u201d\u201cTo deal with only Wei Xiaobao, it shouldn\u2019t take so many masters to join forces.\u201d The blood saber elder suddenly spoke up, looked at the faces around him and said with a smile, \u201cIn my opinion, I am afraid that individually, none of you in this room is the opponent of that young man. So, I went through much hardship and wanted to unite everyone to deal with this matter together.\u201dGoblin: Please consider becoming a patron at\u00a0Patreon\u00a0if you enjoy reading my translation. The amount doesn\u2019t matter, your gesture does. It keeps me motivated. Also, if you like the novel, please rate the it on Novel Updates.Here\u2019s your chapter! Now I gotta go study.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: Flame blade Vs wooden sword\u201cI\u2019m afraid the blood saber sect master is exaggerating, that young man is not Xiao Feng, or Zhang Wuji.\u201d Hong Antong smiled, showing a clear disbelief.Yuan Chengzhi also smiled faintly in his heart. Over the past few years, he has successfully integrated the martial arts techniques of the Mount Hua Sect, the Golden Serpent Gentleman, and the Iron Sword Sect.\u201cLeader Hong only has to ask himself if his martial arts is better than mine. If he thinks so, then we should have a sparring match to make it clear.\u201d The blood saber elder narrowed his eyes, and his hand holding the blood saber tightened.Hong Antong faintly smiled, his white hair fluttered in the wind, and he disappeared from his place. His fist aiming to put a hole in the chest of the blood saber elder with a punch. Although the blood saber elder was surprised at his speed, he himself was experienced and well prepared, so he received the attack with the swing of his saber.In the blink of an eye, the two of them exchanged a dozen attacks. Hong Antong\u2019s original martial arts skills were slightly higher than that of the blood saber elder, but in actual fights, it didn\u2019t go as well as he expected, and this fact made him extremely depressed.Shangjie on the side noticed that the fight between the two was getting out of hand, and he quickly jumped into the fight. With a few palm strikes with both hands, he immediately separated the two.\u201cHeh!\u201d Hong Antong snorted, turned around and sat down, \u201cThe great mudra of Tantric Buddhism is indeed well-deserved.\u201dThe blood saber elder also put the blood saber on his waist and slowly sat down.Yuan Chengzhi was taken aback after witnessing this, and he secretly calculated if he would have a chance to win against any one of the three. If any two of them teamed up to fight him, then he could manage a narrow victory at most. But, if all three of them attacked together, then he was afraid that he could only rely on God\u2019s will to keep his life.Blood saber elder. Is that young man really so good?\u201d Yuan Chengzhi originally wanted to deal with Wei Xiaobao. Seeing several people with the same goal as himself, he thought that he and them had no prior hatred, so there was nothing wrong with joining forces once.There was a horrified expression on the face of the blood saber elder, \u201cI dare to say that I have seen many masters of martial arts in the wulin, but it is the first time I have seen anyone who can use an ordinary wooden sword to perform such exquisite swordsmanship.\u201d After saying this, he continued to narrate the situation of that day in detail.The other three people were amazed. Yuan Chengzhi was also surprised, thinking that half of his strength came from his golden serpent sword. If it was changed to an ordinary wooden sword, he was afraid he couldn\u2019t even beat one of these three.After witnessing the blood saber elder\u2019s martial arts, everyone believed his judgment. Yuan Chengzhi was also interested, but he still had to ask about some things to clear the doubts in his mind, \u201cEveryone present here is the overlord of an organization, why would you work together to deal with a weakling like Wei Xiaobao?\u201dShangjie glanced at the blood saber elder, folded his palms, and said, \u201cGolden Serpent King, we do not wish to hide it from you. The Blood Saber Sect master and I are now dependent on the seventh prince of Mongolia. Those of us who are his subordinates are thinking about how we can lessen worries for him. So we decided to get rid of the Emperor Kangxi\u2019s right-hand man. As for leader Hong, he also intends to take refuge under our Prince.\u201dHong Antong nodded slightly, but secretly calculated in his heart,\u00a0\u2018When I find Wei Xiaobao and force him to tell the secrets of the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters, wouldn\u2019t it be better to establish an independent kingdom overseas? Who would join you and become a slave.\u2019\u201cAccording to our many investigations, Wei Xiaobao seems to be traveling separately from the army. Now he should be in the territory of Gusu in Song State. We will ambush him on the way back to Yanjing, Yangzhou!\u201d As soon as the big four decided to join forces, they quickly started planning.\u201cWe must make him stay in Yangzhou for a period of time before we have enough time to reel in the net.\u201d\u201cWhat weakness does Wei Xiaobao have?\u201d\u201cMerry making, gambling, money.\u201d\u201cYangzhou has always been a land of pleasure, so we might as well use beauty as a bait.\u201d\u201cBut Wei Xiaobao is an official of the Qing Dynasty. He is used to enjoying stunning beauties, I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t even care to glance at the average low quality flower.\u201d\u201cThe lady of this seat can be considered as an exceptional beauty. She could be considered a suitable candidate, but it is a pity that the little thief has already met her, and it would be bad if he was suspicious in advance.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that Mrs. Hong\u2019s fame has spread far and wide. What a pity.\u201dThe group of men were looking at each other, worrying about the bait. At this time, the flap of the big tent was opened, and a beautiful young woman came in. Although she was not very old, her hair was already in a bun, which indicated that she was already a married woman.\u201dBrother Yuan, I heard that some guests have come to visit?\u201dThe several people in the tent looked at each other one after another, and cried out in their hearts,\u00a0\u2018I went everywhere, even broke my iron shoes for the truth but still got nothing, who knew, it was just under my eyes!\u2019\u00a0\u00a0[A line from a poem by Xia Yuanding (\u590f\u5143\u9f0e). I also loved the whole poem. Read it if you like reading poetry.]Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s face was full of black lines, \u2018Qingqing, you couldn\u2019t come earlier or late, but you had to come at this time!\u2019Who knew that when Xia Qingqing heard their plan, she became very interested, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun and exciting! Just let me go, I don\u2019t believe Wei Xiaobao, that smelly thief, will not fall under this lady\u2026madam\u2019s skirt.\u201d*****Looking back at the confrontation between Song Qingshu and Jiumozhi.Jiumozhi didn\u2019t put Song Qingshu in his eyes at first, but when the two faced off from a distance. Jiumozhi soon realized his mistake, and understood that his opponent was a master. His martials arts attainments were not inferior to him.Song Qingshu knew that his opponent was afraid of losing face and would not make the first move, so he used the \u201cDark Clouds but No Rain\u201d of the Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms.\u201cEighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms?\u201d Jiumozhi was extremely knowledgeable, and he recognized Song Qingshu\u2019s martial arts technique at a glance. \u2018Apart from Guo Jing, I\u2019ve never heard of anyone mastering it the younger generation of Beggars\u2019 Sect.\u2019This was more exciting, so Jiumozhi used one of Shaolin\u2019s 72 Styles, the \u201cPrajna Palm\u201d to greet this attack. They exchanged blows and fought each other for dozens of moves. Pranja Palm was one the most fierce and powerful techniques in the world. It was among the Shaolin Temple\u2019s core techniques and was difficult to grasp. But, it was also true that every technique was destined to meet a talented person.It\u2019s a pity that Song Qingshu has not been able to reach the advanced realm of Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms. Therefore, he could only bring out a fraction of its power. Jiumozhi also relied on tricks to perform the Prajna Palm; he could only bring out its form, not its essence. That\u2019s why it was taking so long to get a clear winner.If it was Xiao Feng or Guo Jing who performed the Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms at this moment, and Jiumozhi simply used the Prajna Palm to receive it, he would have surely been defeated. In the same way, if the Prajna Palm were to be used by the Sweeping Monks, then Song Qingshu\u2019s Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms would not be able to stop it.Nonetheless, the two master\u2019s moves were exquisite, and the surrounding tables and chairs were swept away by their force.\u201cThis group of damn martial artists, what should I do with all this damage and loss of property?\u201d The boss of the restaurant went upstairs, and when he\u00a0 saw this mess, he couldn\u2019t help but feel sad, and started crying.\u201cShut up, don\u2019t disturb this grandpa\u2019s interest in watching.\u201d Wei Xiaobao was eagerly watching, and threw out a handful of money towards the boss, \u201cI have paid for your loss. This should be enough!\u201d\u201cEnough, it is enough! These masters should fight as long as you want, and I will go make a pot of tea for you.\u201d After counting the amount of the money, the boss suddenly smiled and ran down.After being interrupted by this, the two took the opportunity to separate, and Jiumozhi looked at Song Qingshu in amazement, \u201cMaster Song is the highest level martial artist this monk encountered since this poor monk entered the Central Plains.\u201d\u201cIt takes thirty-four years for one to master the Prajna Palm of Shaolin Temple. This monk must have learned it only a few years ago. It is really puzzling that he is able to practice to such an extent.\u201d Wang Yuyan muttered to herself, while lowering her head. She was thinking hard, and seemed puzzled.\u201cThe great monk is really amazing, and his one year of cultivation is worth ten years compared to other Shaolin monks!\u201d Song Qing praised sincerely. Although he knew that the other party would not be moved by pretty words, just a flattery won\u2019t cause any harm.Although Jiumozhi was one of the eminent monks in this generation, he could not break out of his obsession with his martial arts fame in the end. He heard his opponents\u2019 admiration. Although he felt ashamed, he showed a faint smile on his face and accepted the praise.However, Song Qingshu was shocked when he saw his smile, and he hurriedly dodged to the side. Only then could everyone see that there were a few deep holes in the position Song Qingshu was standing just now. If he did not dodge, he might have been seriously injured at this moment.\u201cThe ability to easily escape the finger attack of the poor monk shows that the benefactor has a profound knowledge of Buddhism. Ordinary people don\u2019t know the essence of the Buddha\u2019s gesture of holding flowers, and the essence of Venerable Kassapa\u2019s smiling gestures, so naturally they don\u2019t realize the timing of the Flower Pinching Finger.\u201d Jiumozhi slowly retracted his fingers one by one, admiring the young man in front of him more and more.\u201cThen this one is not going to hold back. Please pardon the offence.\u201d The expression on Song Qingshu\u2019s face was suddenly full of hostility, he changed his palms into claws, and fiercely attacked.When Wei Xiaobao saw that the marble floor of the room had several deep holes due to the force of Song Qingshu\u2019s claws, he couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cBig Brother Song is awesome!\u201dWang Yuyan frowned. She sighed softly after watching these sets of attacks, \u201cAlthough the Nine Yin White Bone Claw is very powerful, Master Song doesn\u2019t seem to have achieved great success in the technique itself. Now he is only relying on the power of his martial arts, and it wont do him any good for long. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s inevitable that he will fall into a disadvantage.\u201dHearing her soft voice, Duan Yu couldn\u2019t help being stunned. In his mind, the confrontation between two stinky men in the room was nothing compared to staring at Miss Wang.Mu Wanqing had half of her attention on him, and immediately noticed Duan Yu\u2019s dreamy appearance. She felt uncomfortable in her heart and started paying attention to the situation of the fight with all her heart.Sure enough, after Song Qingshu\u2019s energy was exhausted, Jiumozhi used Shaolin\u2019s Dragon Claw, and countered the claw with claws, forcing Song Qingshu to a hasty retreat.Jiumozhi smiled faintly, \u201cThis poor monk is very curious about the wooden sword benefactor Song has on his back. Over the past few months, all the way from the east, to the Central Plains this poor monk has seen a lot of wonderful swordsmanship, such as the Six Meridians Divine Sword. But, I have never seen anyone use a wooden sword. Could it be that benefactor Song thinks that this poor monk is not worthy of your sword?\u201d\u201cI heard that the most famous technique of the great monk is the \u2018Flame Blade\u2019. May I have the honor of witnessing it.\u201d Song Qingshu drew out his wooden sword, and sent a deadly chain of sword slashes.\u201cGood swordsmanship!\u201d Jiumozhi gave a secret compliment, and he countered it with his own sword technique.Wei Xiaobao saw the two dancing swords in the air, and repeatedly splitting their palms at their opponents. He understood nothing. He scratched his head and his ears. Then he had an idea in his heart and spoke to Wang Yuyan with a smile, \u201cMiss Wang, can you explain what they are doing?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: The four major Tibetan Tantric SectsSeeing that he couldn\u2019t understand, Wang Yuyan couldn\u2019t help but smile, and explained softly, \u201cThat monk used the Tubo\u2019s Ningma Temple\u2019s unique \u2018Flame Blade\u2019. Every time he slashes with the palm of his hand, it will form a sharp and hot blade slash. As for the sword technique used by Young Master Song, it should be based on the Five Sacred Mountain Sect swordsmanship. But when one move is just used, it immediately becomes another one. Although I know every move, it is constantly changing and it has become an exquisite sword technique I haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d\u00a0(Goblin: Ningma Temple means Tranquil Agate Temple.)Hearing Wang Yuyan\u2019s voice, the wise experienced Jiumozhi\u2019s gaze turned even more intense. His opponent used some fairly standard and unremarkable swordsmanship, but together they were extremely exquisite. Only a master of his vision could understand the truth. The other party was no longer performing swordsmanship, but sword intent.\u201cBut the two of them are attacking from a distance, can they really defeat each other like that?\u201d Wei Xiaobao asked suspiciously, but he was happy in his heart:\u00a0\u2018Ah, such a nice voice! If you called me husband with that voice in the future, I would be willing to sacrifice ten years of my\u2026 Oh no, I would like to live for many more years.\u2019\u201cThat monk\u2019s sword aura can reach its target from several feet away. Young Master Song is using his exquisite swordsmanship to find the weakest place of the opponent\u2019s sword aura. Therefore, every time he is attacked, he can disperse that monk\u2019s sword aura.\u201d Wang Yuyan\u2019s face was shining brightly, the duel between the two top masters brought her knowledge of martial arts to a higher level, and she thought that she must tell her cousin about this the next time they meet.In the room, Song Qingshu jumped out of Jiumozhi\u2019s attack circle, and immediately said, \u201cI concede.\u201dJiumozhi had a puzzled expression, \u201cThe young benefactor\u2019s swordsmanship is great, and the poor monk hasn\u2019t taken the slightest advantage. How can he admit defeat?\u201dSong Qingshu showed the wooden sword in front of him with a wry smile, looked at the slightly scorched marks on the sword\u2019s surface, and sighed,\u00a0 \u201cGreat monk\u2019s Flame Blade is extremely hot, and I am afraid that my wooden sword will get burned if I use it again.\u201dSong Qingshu knew very well in his heart that his skill was not as good as his opponent\u2019s, otherwise it would be impossible for the sword to be damaged by the heat of the opponent\u2019s sword. If he was strong enough even real flames couldn\u2019t hurt the wooden sword at all, so he could only sigh secretly,\u00a0\u2018Wooden sword, you are so pitiful! You met a master like me.\u2019\u201cHahaha~\u201d Jiumozhi let out a long laugh, \u201cBenefactor Song\u2019s swordsmanship is superb, and he is upright and honest. It\u2019s really rare.\u201dAt this time, Wei Xiaobao had an idea, he realized that it was the right time to intervene, and he immediately jumped out, \u201cSince you two masters cherish each other, then what is the use of fighting? We are all brothers from different corners of the world. You two should sit down and enjoy a refreshing glass of water. Owner, come here! Bring me the best vegetarian dishes you have.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dHearing the acceptance from the owner, Jiumozhi felt very comfortable in his heart. He couldn\u2019t help but glance at Wei Xiaobao, \u201cFrom the style of this little brother\u2019s costume, you should be from the Qing Dynasty, right?\u201d\u201cA master is really a master, I haven\u2019t even introduced myself yet, but you can tell at a glance.\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s expression of exaggerated admiration was very effective on Jiumozhi.At this time, Song Qingshu on their side explained Wei Xiaobao\u2019s identity to Jiumozhi. Jiumozhi\u2019s eyes lit up and he glanced at Wei Xiaobao in surprise, \u201cThe little brother is so young, but he can be in a high position in the Qing court. This poor monk admires him.\u201d\u201cAs the Tubo national teacher, the great monk is really polite. May I know the purpose behind the great monk\u2019s visit?\u201d Song Qingshu had already explained the identity of Jiumozhi to Wei Xiaobao on the road before.\u201cThis smelly monk coveted our Dali\u2019s Six Meridians Divine Sword. He went to the Heavenly Dragon Monastery to show off his power and was repelled by the monks in the temple. So he caught me in Jiangnan and discovered that Miss Wang knew all about martial arts in the world. He became even more greedy and caught her too. He is really not a good person.\u201d Duan Yu on the side angrily said.\u201cYoung Master Duan\u2019s words are wrong, and there must be a misunderstanding.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled faintly, \u201cI have visited the Heavenly Dragon Monastery before coming here. Although the Six Meridians Divine Sword formation of the Six Monks is magical, but there are many flaws in it as well. The great monk\u2019s martial arts level is higher than mine, he could take it if he wanted, but he didn\u2019t. So naturally he is not as you have accused.\u201d\u201cAlso\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu paused, turned his head and deeply looked at Mu Wanqing, \u201cMiss Mu, in order to save your Excellency, has pestered the great monk for so long along the way, but he didn\u2019t do anything cruel to her. This also proves that his character is good.\u201dDuan Yu was choked by his words and couldn\u2019t speak, so he sullenly turned his head. Jiumozhi was even more overjoyed when he heard Song Qingshu\u2019s words, \u201cBenefactor Song is really this poor monk\u2019s predestined friend, he understands my intentions. The main reason this poor monk came here is to meet the masters of the central plains wulin, and secondly, I wanted to meet the Emperor of Song. And discuss an alliance.\u201dWei Xiaobao and Song Qingshu looked at each other, \u201cTibetan Empire wants to form an alliance with Song State?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Jiumozhi said with a wry smile, \u201cNow the Mongolian power is getting bigger and bigger, and our Tibetan Empire has been coveted by them for a long time. Our Zanpu is very worried about this.\u201d\u00a0(Goblin: Zanpu is the title of Tibetan rulers.)\u2018What kind of thing is Zanpu?\u2019\u00a0Wei Xiaobao was puzzled, but he was afraid that Wang Yuyan would look down upon him, so he continued to listen patiently.Song Qingshu hesitated for a while, and asked, \u201cGreat monk, as far as I know, your Tibetan tantric master Basipa came under a Mongolian prince, and another master Golden Wheel Dharma King was also canonized as the Mongolian national teacher. I thought that Mongolia and your Tubo had a good relationship.\u201dA trace of anger flashed across Kumazhi\u2019s face, and he bitterly said, \u201cThe benefactor knows many things. Our Tibetan Tantric Buddhism is the collective name of the various sects. The four largest branches are Ningma Temple, Nalanda Temple, Vajra Sect, and Shingon Sect.\u201d\u00a0[Author\u2019s note: The four major schools of true Tibetan Buddhism are Ningma, Kagyu, Sakya, and Gelug (the Panchen and Dalai are in this system). For religious reasons, I will replace them and use other names.]\u201cThe Ningma Temple which this poor monk belongs to is the oldest sect of Tantric Buddhism.\u00a0 We have alway had a good relationship with the Tubo Zanpu of each generation. It is because the people from the Ningma Temple\u00a0 were named the Tubo national teacher in every generation, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the other three sects.\u201d\u201cIf it was in the past, under the combined strength of Ningma Temple and Zanpu, other sects would not dare to change sides. However, the rise of Mongolia has allowed the other three sects to see hope, and they have sent spokesmen to Mongolia. The situation is that bad. The master-level figures sent by those Temples were named the state teacher by Temujin.\u201d\u201cOne is the most outstanding master of the Vajra Sect. He has been named the Mongolian national teacher. He is now assisting Kublai Khan in attacking Xiangyang.\u201d\u201cShangjie, the leader of the second generation of Shingon sect disciples, was conferred the title of Master Changqi, and now he is the guest of the Seventh prince of Mongolia.\u201dKumozhi\u2019s tone was full of worry, \u201cThese three factions plans to let Mongolia invade Tibet and destroy Tibetan Empire, so that they can become the master of Tibet.\u201dWhat an unexpected surprise! Song Qingshu and Wei Xiaobao looked at each other after hearing what he said, and felt ecstatic in their hearts, \u201cI went everywhere, even broke my iron shoes for the truth but still got nothing, who knew, it was just under my eyes!\u201d\u00a0[Goblin: Again, a line from a poem by Xia Yuanding (\u590f\u5143\u9f0e)]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: The legendary courtesan\u201cMy sworn brother is now the person most trusted by Emperor Kangxi of the Manchu Qing dynasty.\u201d Song Qingshu said while pulling Wei Xiaobao over. \u201cCome back to Yanjing with us, and Xiaobao will recommend you to him. The Emperor will definitely treat the great sage with courtesy as a guest. With the strong support of the Manchu Court, the great sage would not have to worry about the other three sects.\u201dJiumozhi\u2019s heart moved, and he really wanted to be able to form an alliance with the Manchu and Qing dynasties. With their help and support fighting against the\u00a0 Mongols would be easier. If he joins this party and discusses with the Emperor of Song, then the three kingdoms will be united.\u201cIn that case, this poor monk will rely on the two to say something favorable to the emperor.\u201d After making up his mind, Jiumozhi put his palms together and bowed respectfully.\u201cGreat monk, since you are busy with your country\u2019s major affairs, what do you wish to do by holding me and Miss Wang?\u201d Duan Yu on the side has been waiting to get out of this place, but it was a pity that he had a strong internal force but a shallow foundation. He could not use it, and if he did, it made his whole body numb.\u201cI heard that this weird young man knows the world\u2019s number one swordsmanship, the Six Meridians Divine Sword, and this Miss Wang is also familiar with all the martial arts in the world. I think the Emperor will welcome you very much.\u201d Wei Xiaobao was reluctant to let go of Wang Yuyan, and ruthlessly said to himself, \u2018Do you think you have a big face just because you are some prince of Dali? Just wait until we go back to the capital. When you arrive at this grandpa\u2019s domain, I will deal with you accordingly!\u2019Jiumozhi didn\u2019t plan to let them go either, and Wei Xiaobao\u2019s words were in agreement with him, \u201cWhat is the opinion of Benefactor Song?\u201d\u201cI have no objection.\u201d Song Qingshu turned around and glanced at Wang Yuyan, \u201cMiss Wang, don\u2019t worry, you have performed great kindness towards me, and I will definitely protect you.\u201dWang Yuyan smiled reluctantly, she knew that Song Qingshu and Wei Xiaobao were companions, and his martial arts attainment was inferior to Jiumozhi, so he was already doing his best to help.\u201cA few days ago, this poor monk heard that Lord Wei had already negotiated an alliance with the Song Dynasty. Your mission was a success. Now you should be on your way back to Yanjing. Why did you show up near Gusu?\u201dWei Xiaobao looked embarrassed, then he told him about the matter of Song Qingshu fending off the blood saber elder, and his mission about Shandong\u2019s Yuan Chengzhi.After hearing this, Jiumozhi smiled confidently, \u201cNow with this poor monk and Master Song around, you can even walk through a Tiger\u2019s cave. Don\u2019t worry, Master Wei.\u201dSong Qingshu felt the same way. He was confident that with his current level of strength he would be able to fend off anyone, unless a master of the rank as that nameless holy monk personally came to assassinate him. And now, he also has the thick thigh of Jiumozhi, so he really doesn\u2019t have to be afraid of anyone.At this moment, Wei Xiaobao\u2019s spirit suddenly lifted up, and he was secretly proud, \u2018Although I, Xiaobao, is not good at martial arts, but fortunately, I have many friends with strong martial arts, hahahaha\u2026\u2019Mu Wanqing noticed the beautiful woman standing behind Song Qingshu a long time ago, and couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cLittle Foo\u2026 Brother Song, who is this?\u201dJust now, she heard this girl claimed to be Song Qingshu\u2019s wife. Shui Sheng rolled her eyes and suddenly got an idea. She timidly took Song Qingshu\u2019s arm and said in a sweet voice, \u201cSong Dear, who is this girl?\u201dThe truth was, Shui Sheng actually believed that these two were husband and wife. So she deliberately planned this situation. This way, this woman would definitely not spare Song Qingshu. He would be in a difficult situation, and the best way to prove his innocence was to drive her away.Sure enough, Mu Wanqing\u2019s face turned livid, she quickly stood up, and turned her head to leave regardless of everyone\u2019s opinion.Duan Yu stared at her slender back when she left, and felt uncomfortable in his heart, \u201cSister Wan, seems to have changed a little\u2026\u201d\u00a0(Goblin: Yes\u2026yes she did.)Everyone turned their heads and looked at Song Qingshu, wondering why he didn\u2019t chase her. Song Qingshu shook his head and picked up the wine glass, \u201cSheng\u2019er, pour your master some wine.\u201dShui Sheng and the people at the scene looked at each other. They never expected that he didn\u2019t seem to be angry at all. He looked like\u2026 as if he was quite happy.Song Qingshu was naturally very happy. Thanks to Shui Sheng\u2019s mistake, he now found out that Mu Wanqing had his place in her heart. Maybe she hadn\u2019t even realized it yet.As for why he didn\u2019t chase, he had his own thoughts.Song Qingshu\u2019s experience in his previous life taught him that if you coax a woman when she is throwing a tantrum, it would only double her arrogance. The current Song Qingshu had enough of coaxing women and catering to their every need. He knew that after Mu Wanqing calms down, she will realize her own heart.*****The group embarked on a journey to the north. When entering the Manchu border, they met Duo Long, the chief guard, who had been waiting for them for a long time.\u201cBrother Duo, why are you here?\u201d Wei Xiaobao asked in surprise when he saw his old friend.\u201cBrother Wei, not long after you began your journey, the emperor was worried that there were not enough guards by your side. I was sent to greet you with three thousand elite riding cavalry.\u201d Duo Long clasped his fists and respectfully greeted him.\u00a0 \u201cSo I was waiting for you at the border of the country to receive you.\u201d\u201cLord Wei\u2026\u201d At this moment two familiar voices came from Zhang Kangnian and Zhao Qixian.\u201cYou?\u201d Wei Xiaobao looked at the two in surprise. Although the two have no real abilities, and were only good at slacking off, but Wei Xiaobao regarded the two as friends. So he was always worried that the mission of the two would go wrong.\u201cWe followed the lord\u2019s order and went all the way north. Just after crossing the river, we ran into the imperial guard commander. After he learned that there was an assassination attempt on the lord, he specifically ordered us not to say anything, and pretend that the lord was in the mission team, so as to confuse the enemies and provide cover for your safe return.\u201d Zhang Kangnian and Zhao Qixian looked at each other, and they both were rejoicing in their hearts.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to Brother Song and Tubo\u2019s Master Jiumozhi for escorting me all the way.\u201d Wei Xiaobao introduced the two to Duo Long. \u201cThey are among the best martial artists in the world. The Emperor will definitely be very happy to see them.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about this monk, but is this little pretty boy also a master?\u201d Duo Long muttered to himself and decided to test him.\u201cThank you Master Song for taking care of our brother Wei during this trip.\u201d Duo Long smiled and stretched out his hand to Song Qingshu.Song Qingshu felt it was strange, but he still shook his hand. Duo Long\u2019s expression suddenly changed. It turned out that no matter how much force he put on his hand, the other party just looked at him with a smile, and Duo Long finally realized that he had kicked the iron sheet. He withdrew his hand with a sullen expression, \u201cMaster Song is really strong in martial arts.\u201d\u201cOh, I finally have the feeling of being home after seeing you guys,\u201d Wei Xiaobao did not notice the surging undercurrent, and took a long sigh of relief. \u201cIs there any fun place around here? During this period of time, it was only sleeping in the wind and bland meals. It made me bored.\u201d Although Wei Xiaobao had been protected by Song Qingshu and others on the way, after all, he had not been in contact with his acquaintances for a long time, and he was always a little worried. Now seeing old friends like Duo Long, his heart finally relaxed.\u201cBrother Wei, now that you reminded me, I really remembered something.\u201d Duo Long raised his eyebrows and smiled. \u201cA stunning courtesan recently came to a brothel in Yangzhou City. She came under the pretense of being a performer and is not selling himself. All the men in the whole Yangzhou city dream of having a night with her, but I heard that no one could be her guest so far, and I\u2019m certain that Brother Wei will definitely be able to get her.\u201d\u201cA courtesan who sells art and does not sell herself?\u201d Wei Xiaobao muttered, but he cursed out\u00a0 in his heart. \u2018This grandpa here was born in this brothel. Do you think I don\u2019t know the activities inside? Isn\u2019t it because those people want to increase her value? Which bi*ch doesn\u2019t love money\u2026 Hmph, then you just have to talk some sweet nothings and fill her with a few glasses of fine spring wine. I don\u2019t believe she won\u2019t spread her legs after that!\u2019\u00a0(Goblin: Wei Xiaobao\u2019s mother was a prostitute. Spring Wine is a kind of aphrodisiac.)Wei Xiaobao secretly regretted it, but it was a pity that he had already taken his mother to the capital.\u201cBut this courtesan seems to be different from the ordinary prostitutes.\u201d When Duo Long saw that Wei Xiaobao didn\u2019t believe it, he quickly explained. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even meet any customers. She has some strange conditions\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother, let me hear what those conditions are\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao was screaming in his heart. She was just a bit*h in the brothel, so what was the reason behind all the hypocrisy.\u00a0\u2018This grandpa hates being forced to do things. I will definitely get her.\u2019\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Duo Long looked embarrassed, \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go and have a look.\u201d Wei Xiaobao wanted to take everyone to the Brothel.\u201cMiss Wang is an innocent lady, how can you take her with you to such a filthy place?\u201d Duan Yu on the side immediately protested, and jumped out to stop him. Wang Yuyan on the side blushed and was very unwilling to go there as well.Shui Sheng also looked at Song Qingshu aggrievedly, Song Qingshu laughed, turned his head and deliberately stopped looking at her.Jiumozhi\u2019s expression was also a bit ridiculous. No matter what, he was in the end, a monk. So, it would not be appropriate for him to visit a brothel.Wei Xiaobao gave a \u201cha ha ha\u201d laugh and glanced at Duan Yu, \u201cIf I leave you outside, what would I do if you run away? As for Miss Wang, it\u2019s an easy thing to do, just let her pretend to be a man, who can tell the difference.\u201d\u201cWill it be inconvenient for the great monk?\u201d Song Qingshu noticed the hesitation on Jiumozhi\u2019s face.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, a clean heart need not be weary of filth. This poor monk can bear this.\u201d In fact, it was Jiumozhi who wanted to use Wei Xiaobao to convince the Kangxi Emperor, and he was afraid that if he didn\u2019t go, it would create some dissatisfaction.\u201cCome, prepare a set of clean clothes for the two girls.\u201d Seeing this, Duo Long hurriedly ordered the soldiers to take action.Wang Yuyan\u00a0 lightly bit her teeth, hesitated for a while, took a deep look at Duan Yu, but still followed the soldiers. Duan Yu was shaken by her look, and felt regret. \u2018At the beginning, uncle and dad asked me to learn martial arts, I didn\u2019t learn. And now I can\u2019t save Miss Wang from suffering this kind of grievance.\u2019Shui Sheng raised her head to see Song Qingshu making no expression. Her teeth were itchy with hatred. She really wanted to kick him and ran into the tent with her mouth pouting.After some time, the two women raised the tent flap and walked out. They watched as the group of men quietly swallowed their saliva. Song Qingshu saw the two beautiful and charming\u00a0 women dressed as scholars, and his heart jumped,\u00a0\u2018I finally understand why some people were so into crossdressing in my previous life.\u2019The group of people went to the brothel in a grandiose way. Duo Long originally planned to reserve the whole place, but Wei Xiaobao raised his hand to stop him, saying, \u201cA man goes to a brothel to enjoy a lively atmosphere. If it\u2019s deserted, what fun is there?\u201d\u201cIt is exactly as Brother Wei says!\u201d Duo Long was taken aback, and soon revealed a knowing smile.As he walked, Wei Xiaobao\u2019s rolled eyes and turned to Song Qingshu and said, \u201cBig Brother Song, let\u2019s exchange our attire and identity.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: The first questionSong Qingshu looked at him in confusion, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t there many enemies thinking about assassinating me? The brothel is a public place, so they will surely try something and when they do, they would never think that the target is a powerful martial artist Brother Song instead. And that would be the end of them.\u201d Wei Xiaobao calmly said. But he had a different thought in his heart,\u00a0\u2018It will be inconvenient to move while wearing this official uniform. When I go to that brothel and give that courtesan some tough love with some spring wine, isn\u2019t it going to be ruined?\u2019\u201cLord Wei is really brilliant, I admire him.\u201d Zhang Kangnian and Zhao Qixian would never let go of any chance of flattering.\u201cBenefactor Wei\u2019s words are not unreasonable.\u201d Jiumozhi looked at Song Qingshu and nodded, \u201cWe only have Master Song and Wei Xiaobao who are similar in age.\u201d\u2018Isn\u2019t Duan Yu also here? It would be better if he was killed by an assassin.\u2019\u00a0Song Qingshu cursed in his heart. And as if he could guess what he was thinking, Duan Yu subconsciously shrank back.However, reason told him that he was the best candidate, and Duan Yu was the prince of Dali, so no matter what, if something really happened, Kangxi would have cursed Wei Xiaobao to death.\u00a0\u2018Fortunately, my martial arts skills are above average, even if I encounter an assassin, it should be more than enough for self-protection.\u2019Song Qingshu put away his thoughts, nodded and replied, \u201cOkay!\u201dIf you ask where is the best place for drunkards today, ten out of ten men will answer you with excitement, Yangzhou!If you ask where is the most filthy place today, ten out of ten women will answer you with contempt, Yangzhou!Thousands of rich people came to Yangzhou for the pleasures of tangled flesh. To them, there was nothing more joyful in life than this.Every evening, various pleasure houses in Yangzhou City became lively, and the most lively among them all was the Spring Beauty Pavilion.\u201cHuh, isn\u2019t it because of that young girl who came recently. Everyone was enchanted by her as soon as she came here. I don\u2019t think she has such a great charm.\u201d An old codger watched as a group of young masters in fresh clothes went straight to the Spring Beauty Pavilion. And he spit on the ground, and bitterly spoke.Naturally, this group of fresh-clothed energetic young masters were Wei Xiaobao and Song Qingshu and his entourage. Just when they stepped into the doors of Spring Beauty Pavilion, the owner\u2019s eyes lit up and he quickly greeted them with enthusiasm.Wei Xiaobao threw an ingot of silver towards him and pointed to Song Qingshu and said, \u201cIt is a reward from our Lord Wei and go find us the best seat in the house.\u201dThe owner glanced at Song Qingshu, and nodded quickly, \u201cOkay, please come with me, Young Master.\u201d After speaking, he led everyone to an elegant and quiet place and requested them to sit down. Then he ordered the little servant to arrange melons, fruits, wine and dishes, and spoke with a flattering smile, \u201cYoung Masters drink a glass of water and wine first, and Miss Youyou will come out in a moment. Whether you can get her favor depends on the Young Masters ability.\u201d\u201cYou can go take your leave first.\u201d Wei Xiaobao impatiently waved his hand and drove him off. After a while, he quietly said to Song Qingshu, \u201cBrother Song, I\u2019ll go and relieve myself first.\u201d\u201cThe courtesan is coming out soon.\u201d Song Qingshu said in amazement. He didn\u2019t expect him to go there at this time.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll see her when I come back, you don\u2019t need to send someone to follow me, so as not to reveal our identity.\u201d After Wei Xiaobao finished speaking, he quickly ran to the corridor, clutching his stomach.Running out of everyone\u2019s sight, Wei Xiaobao straightened up and slyly smiled, \u201cI have to first go to the warehouse and get some Spring wine out.\u201dNot long after Wei Xiaobao left, the hall exploded with people\u2019s excited voices and exclamations.\u201cMiss Youyou is here.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know which man will be so lucky to be her guest today.\u201d\u201cMiss Youyou is so alluring with a frown or a smile.\u201dSong Qingshu looked up, and saw a few maidservants coming down from upstairs with a beauty in a palace dress. Taking small elegant steps, her charm and gestures made Song Qingshu\u2019s heart sway.As if noticing Song Qingshu\u2019s gaze, the beauty glanced back at him, her features were picturesque, especially those beautiful eyes, which seemed to have crystals flowing on the surface, it gave her a charming and alluring aura.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that a woman of such quality is in such a dirty place.\u201d Song Qingshu quickly lowered his head, his heart kept beating wildly. She was really a young woman, and she is able to use the charm of a woman to the extreme with ease. As if she was naturally born with it.Before he knew it, the beauty had already walked into the lobby and sat slowly down behind a curtain of gauze. Seeing the opportunity, the old announcer hurriedly began to yell, \u201cMasters, young Miss Youyou has already sat down. And the rules are the same as always, whoever can answer her three questions, will be invited by Miss Youyou into her fragrant boudoir.\u201d\u00a0(Goblin: Boudoir is a woman\u2019s bedroom or small private room.)\u201cFor so many days, no one could even answer the first question. Isn\u2019t your Spring Beauty Pavilion dishonest and cheating?\u201d A chubby wealthy businessman called out, and a group of people around him nodded secretly.\u201cIf you can\u2019t answer it, it doesn\u2019t mean that other people can\u2019t answer it. If you can answer the question of Miss Youyou so easily, wouldn\u2019t it be a joke?\u201d Another speaker heard his words and replied. It was from a young man who was sitting nearby. He was a gifted scholar, and\u00a0 a large number of people who are here for the first time also agreed with his words.\u201cHey, if you guys think you are so great, then why don\u2019t you go try it?\u201d The fat businessman sneered, his expression very disdainful.\u201cI also hope that Miss Youyou will write a question.\u201d Shi Shiran, the person who spoke just now, saluted towards the curtain.Miss Youyou leaned slightly and gave a nod, but she did not speak. At that moment, a maid beside her stood up and opened her mouth and said, \u201cListen well, the first question of our miss is neither the test of music, chess, calligraphy, nor the knowledge of Scriptures and History. She only wants to test your skills in arithmetic. The Miss wants to use a knife to divide her beloved brocade handkerchief into several pieces. As we all know, one cut can divide the handkerchief into two pieces, two cuts can divide it into four pieces at most, and with three cuts it can be divided into eight pieces. May I ask, how many pieces will Miss Youyou\u2019s handkerchief be divided into at most, after one hundred cuts?\u201dAs soon as this question came out, everyone in the scene began to bury their heads in thinking. Duo Long\u2019s eyes lit up, and he took out a square scarf and a knife to separate it. After cutting it for seven or eight times, some parts of the square scarf was so finely cut that it couldn\u2019t be cut anymore, and he threw away the knife with anger, \u201cFu*k, this is so hard. What a clever problem.\u201dDuan Yu was a person who had studied mainly poetry and classics. If he examined the meaning of these subtle words with the help of Buddhist scriptures, he would be able to give the answer. But it was a pity that he didn\u2019t know anything about the skills required for this test.Unlike Duan Yu, Wang Yuyan read a wide range of books. It was not limited to martial arts classics or Confucian classics. She had also studied a lot of books on mathematics, such as \u201cNine Chapters of Arithmetic\u201d and \u201cZhoubi Suanjing\u201d. Hearing this question, her mind began to calculate at extreme speed, and she soon figured out the answer, and she couldn\u2019t help but show a smile on her lips.Duan Yu was always staring at Wang Yuyan, and when he saw her smile, he was surprised and said,\u00a0 \u201cMiss Wang has already figured it out?\u201d\u00a0 Her knowledge of martial arts was superb, and she was obviously a literary talent, but Duan Yu lost in all of these fields compared to his sweetheart. He truly had nothing to be proud of, and suddenly felt very depressed.Hearing Duan Yu\u2019s words, Duo Long, Zhang Kangnian, Zhao Qixian and others surrounded her at once, and said with a flattering smile, \u201cMiss Wang, can you tell us the answer.\u201dWang Yuyan blushed and firmly shook her head. She was very angry after she was arrested by them, how could she be willing to help them to harm other girls.Song Qingshu was very calm, he was sitting on the main seat, and leisurely sipping his tea. Shui Sheng saw his appearance, and the corner of her eyes curled up, and asked curiously, \u201cYou also figured out the answer?\u201d\u201cIn the future, remember to call the master first. It\u2019s no rules.\u201d Song Qingshu glared at her, but didn\u2019t answer her directly.Shui Sheng felt suffocated and hated Song Qingshu. She turned her head and looked at the girl behind the gauze curtain, a sly smile bloomed at the corner of her lips, and she suddenly shouted, \u201cMy master has already figured it out!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: Shui Sheng wins the contestIt turned out that Shui Sheng was sure that Song Qingshu was just pretending to be a master to save face.Sure enough, everyone in the audience looked back at Song Qingshu after hearing her words.\u201cDon\u2019t just randomly guess a number.\u201d\u201cThis kid is just delusional. Everyone guessed so much before, but they didn\u2019t guess right in the end.\u201d*****The presenter\u2019s eyes lit up and he quietly winked. The old codger said with a smile, \u201cSo it is Master Wei, he is really talented, please tell me the answer, Miss Youyou will judge whether it is right or wrong.\u201dHearing the cold words of the crowd, Wang Yuyan worriedly glanced at Song Qingshu. After having several contacts, she had a good impression of him. She couldn\u2019t bear to see him embarrass himself. She was about to open her mouth and quietly tell him the answer, but Shui Sheng saw through her thoughts and didn\u2019t give her that opportunity. She blocked between the two and said, \u201cMiss Wang doesn\u2019t have to worry about my master. He is very learned. He naturally knows about such simple topics.\u201dShui Sheng sneered triumphantly in her heart, and the higher she held him up now, the heavier he would fall later. Wang Yuyan didn\u2019t know the relationship between the two. Seeing Shui Sheng say this, she gave up the idea of telling him.\u201cThis little demoness seems to be lacking proper training.\u201d Song Qingshu stared at Shui Sheng fiercely.Duo Long glanced at Song Qingshu enviously, winked his eyes and said, \u201cMaster Song, they treat you so well. This is a rare opportunity for you to impress these beautiful women.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say it already! Don\u2019t waste everyone\u2019s time.\u201d The crowd below was already very impatient, and Shui Sheng also smiled and waited for the good show.\u201cAfter one hundred cuts, Miss Youyou\u2019s embroidered handkerchief should be divided into five thousand and fifty pieces at most.\u201d Song Qingshu said, looking at the lady in the palace dress behind the gauze curtain.Wang Yuyan secretly nodded, thinking that Young Master Song was not only good at martial arts, but also capable of the mysterious arithmetic skills. He really was different from the ordinary people, and he was truly a scholarly man.Miss Youyou finally spoke, her voice soft and sweet, and each syllable seemed to have a fascinating magical power, \u201cMaster Wei is really talented, may I know how he calculated it.\u201d She was puzzled in her heart. Everyone knew that Wei Xiaobao was not an educated person and his looks were wretched. So, why is this person handsome and learned? He can even figure out this problem!This charming woman was naturally Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s wife Xia Qingqing. Many years ago, she was still a bit young, a tomboy, but for some reason, she became more and more beautiful after marriage, and it radiated in her every gesture. Her charm as a woman was truly glamorous nowadays.If Song Qingshu knew her identity at the moment, he would definitely sigh,\u00a0\u2018No wonder Yuan Chengzhi was reluctant to go find Ajiu later. It turns out that Xia Qingqing has become so overwhelmingly beautiful!\u2019This particular question was found in an ancient book by historians. It was originally used to deliberately make things difficult for the scholars who were looking for fame and asking for fortune, so that they would retreat. She had been waiting for Wei Xiaobao. After Wei Xiaobao came, she had her own way to let him pass the test. Only she knew the answers, so Wei Xiaobao just had to guess a number and she would say he was right. Wasn\u2019t it easy?She didn\u2019t expect\u00a0 that Wei Xiaobao actually got the answer right when he opened his mouth. Xia Qingqing was surprised. Then she noticed the men and women behind him, and her heart moved,\u00a0\u2018Wei Xiaobao is a person in a high position. It is likely that his subordinates helped him figure it out.\u2019Even though Xia Qingqing thought so much, to outsiders it seemed to be in the blink of an eye, and they were still waiting for Song Qingshu\u2019s answer.Song Qingshu hesitated for a while, still said, \u201cI guessed it.\u201d And all the people in the hall suddenly cursed in their hearts.Song Qingshu gave a wry smile in his heart, only he knew that this matter was truly accidental. In his previous life, when his company was recruiting, he accidentally saw the interview topic prepared by the personnel department, which also included this topic.At that time, Song Qingshu was embarrassed to find that he couldn\u2019t solve it, and he was too embarrassed to ask his subordinates. After going back, he quietly researched on Baidu for a while, and then he was deeply impressed by this topic.As for the solution\u2026\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s Mathematical induction, will you be able to understand it?\u2019 Song Qingshu looked at everyone with contempt, and was too lazy to say anything.\u201cSince Young Master Wei is unwilling to reveal his method, Youyou will not make things difficult for him.\u201d Xia Qingqing quickly opened her mouth to help him out. After hearing her words, everyone thought that Song Qingshu had some unique skills, and he was unwilling to say it and share it with everyone, so they were relieved.\u201cMaster, please listen to the next question. If you can answer it, please come to the boudoir with Youyou.\u201d Xia Qingqing smiled charmingly, her voice full of temptation.This time, her words seemed have an effect of a bomb,\u201cDidn\u2019t you say three questions, why are you letting him in with two?\u201d\u201cMiss Youyou, do you fancy him?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be deceived just because he is handsome, young and refined. That pretty boy\u2019s face is his only worth, it is not useful. If you want a good companion who can pleasure women, you should have a man like this uncle, who is wealthy and rugged.\u201dHearing the foul language in the scene, Xia Qingqing\u2019s ears turned a little hot, and she bitterly thought,\u00a0\u2018If it hadn\u2019t been for the purpose of catching Wei Xiaobao, how would this grand aunt be sweetly smiling here. If this group of stinky men dared to speak to me like this a few years ago, I would have killed them all with one sword slash.\u2019Xia Qingqing put aside her smile, her voice was a little more detached, \u201cListen well, Youyou once met a wandering expert and got an eternal absolute vow from him. It is said that a master\u2019s vow lasts a thousand years. The masters here should be careful.\u201dAs soon as she said this, everyone in the scene stopped talking. The scholars have always been lingering in the pleasure houses. The first question just now was out of their reach, but this time they wanted to show their strength. So, they asked her impatiently, \u201cMiss Youyou hurry up and ask the next question. See if we can answer it, please give us another chance.\u201dXia Qingqing smiled sweetly, and said, \u201cSmoke locks the pond with willows!\u201d\u00a0(Goblin: It\u2019s called Qianlong\u2019s upper couplet. The beauty of this absolute is lost in translation. But it is a work of genius.)Song Qingshu was startled to hear this couplet here. When he was bored in his previous life, he saw a novel \u201cFinest Servant\u201d on the Internet, and he was very addicted to it. The theme of the couplets in it impressed him, and he felt that it was a powerful weapon in wooing girls. So, he specially added up some knowledge in this area. The line \u201cSmoke locks the pond with willows\u201d from Miss Youyou was the most famous absolute in history, and it was the one he was most impressed with.He greatly admired the talent of the author of \u201cFinest Servant\u201d, so he personally visited and recruited the author of the book to his company, so that the author would never be able to write a novel again, making other Internet readers regret it. This is something better left unsaid.During the time when Song Qingshu was in a trance, someone in the scene already came up with something, \u201cCannon on the Zhenhai tower!\u201d\u00a0(Goblin: Again lost in translation. In fact the essence of the next few lines will also be lost in translation. Chinese characters are fundamentally different from English words.)Sure enough, the brothel has always been a gathering place for melancholic literatos and poets. There really were some hidden dragons and crouching tigers here. It was very difficult to imply the five elements of \u201cgold (metal), wood, water, fire and earth\u201d in the form of a couplet in a poem, while maintaining that exquisite artistic conception.This person\u2019s \u201cCannon on the Zhenhai tower\u201d just now also implied \u201cGold, Wood, Water, Fire and Earth\u201d, but it was a pity that its artistic conception was slightly worse.Sure enough, someone quickly criticized it, \u201cIt is far-fetched, although it barely matched, but the artistic conception is too far behind the upper couplet. It is not good.\u201d\u201cHmph, I\u2019m right anyway. Then can you do better?\u201d The first man looked very disdainful, and looked around, \u201cIf no one else will try, then I win.\u201dAlthough he was a little arrogant, he did have real talent, and he was absolutely right to do this in such a short time. While the others were still thinking hard.\u201cThis poor monk also has a line, please listen.\u201d Jiumozhi\u2019s heart was moved and he was unable to restrain the desire to perform in his heart, and slowly said, \u201cDengshen village\u2019s temple bell.\u201dWhen everyone heard it, they applauded. It also contained the five elements, but it was much better in terms of artistic conception, and the \u201cTemple Bell\u201d was also very consistent with his identity as a monk.The first person who spoke out just now said with a weird tone, \u201cCould it be that monks are now coming to find flowers and drink dew?\u201dHearing what he said, the people in the scene roared with laughter, making Jiumozhi\u2019s face become hot and he muttered to himself, \u201cThis couplet is so wonderful, this poor monk is just happy to join the exchange.\u201d\u201cRed phoenix soars the heaven, all in earth acclaim.\u201d Duan Yu said with a smile, and compared Jiumozhi\u2019s wisdom\u00a0 to that of Buddha. But seeing his fierce expression, he quickly said, \u201cThere is also another couplet, and I hope the master will comment on it. \u2014\u2014 Boiling tea leaves and chiseling the spring wall.\u201d\u00a0(Author: There is a gold character in the traditional Chinese character for chiseling.)The drunkards in the scene were not all illiterate people. Although many people could not make good couplets themselves, it did not mean that they would not appreciate it. They praised this as better than Jiumozhi, although Jiumozhi\u2019s artistic conception was lofty, but it was flat and different. Duan Yu\u2019s artistic conception was not inferior to him, and the contrast was neat, which was really top-grade.\u201cYoung Master Duan is also interested in Miss Youyou?\u201d Wang Yuyan blankly glanced at Duan Yu, no mood swings could be felt in her tone.To Duan Yu her words struck like thunder, and he hurriedly explained, \u201cMiss Wang, you have misunderstood, how can I be tempted by other women\u2026 It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s just on a whim\u2026Miss Wang, you must believe me!\u201dAs Song Qingshu watched Duan Yu speak incoherently in front of his sweetheart, and a note was suddenly handed to him by the guard, \u201cIt seems that it was passed on by a girl from the Spring Beauty Pavilion.\u201dHe opened it curiously, and saw that something was written in it consisting of five neat little characters, \u201cA row of lanterns on the Yinhan Bridge.\u201d Song Qingshu thoughtfully raised his head and glanced at the girl behind the curtain. She was also staring at him with her raised head, pursed lips, and with a hint of shyness on her lips. Song Qingshu wondered what it meant and he read it all once more.Shui Sheng had been standing by his side, the words on the note and the flirting between the two was not hidden from her ears and eyes, and she couldn\u2019t help but\u00a0 sourly say, \u201cIt seems that this Miss Youyou fell in love with you at first sight. She was afraid that you could not answer. So she sent the answer for you.\u201dDuo Long and the others couldn\u2019t help being taken aback, and they gathered around to look at it, even Duan Yu stared at it with slanted eyes. After reading the note in Song Qingshu\u2019s hand, the group of men sighed, \u201cHey, we are out of luck! Brother Song, this Miss Youyou obviously likes you. Don\u2019t disappoint her.\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s expression remained calm, but the pride in his heart was hard to conceal . After all, men had a natural tendency to compare in this aspect.At that moment,\u00a0 Miss Youyou\u2019s voice was heard, \u201cMay I know if Master Wei has the answer?\u201d\u201cI know!\u201d Shui Sheng didn\u2019t know what she was thinking. And she quickly shouted, \u201cA row of lanterns on the Yinhan Bridge!\u201d .Xia Qingqing\u2019s heart jumped, and she managed to maintain her calmness without changing her expression, and reluctantly smiled, \u201cThis Young Master spoke the best couplet so far.\u201dEveryone in the scene nodded and agreed. They began to inquire about which Young Master this was. Not only did he look handsome, but his literary talents were amazing. Who was this genius?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let\u2019s thank Someone for sponsoring this chapter.Warning! This is a steamy chapter!One of the two came from modern times and knew nothing about poetry, and the other was born in the wulin, and didn\u2019t like poetry at all. In the end, their flirting at the beginning turned into a casual chat.After a few cups of wine, Song Qingshu\u2019s whole body suddenly became a little hot, and he felt that the woman on the opposite side seemed more and more charming.Xia Qingqing also felt hot and uncomfortable, and she inadvertently pulled her neckline apart, and her snowy skin was seen, as if the looming moon came out behind the clouds.\u201cYoung Master is gentle and kind. Today\u2019s weather is so hot, and he keeps on persuading Youyou to drink more.\u201d Xia Qingqing\u2019s eyes opened slightly, and her voice seemed to be complaining and acting like a child. At the moment, she completely took over the role of the famous courtesan Youyou of Yangzhou.It turns out that Spring Beauty Pavilion recently introduced a batch of medicinal liquors from the Western Regions. Unlike previous medicines, this type of liquor didn\u2019t make people unconscious, but only magnified the lust hidden in the subject\u2019s heart by several times, and could make people sink without even realizing. Afterwards, they will think that everything they did was from their volition.This wine was a very precious thing. But, not many people knew that Wei Xiaobao grew up in Spring Beauty Pavilion. He knew where the best goods were. He quietly took it out to replace the bottle that was going to be sent to the courtesan\u2019s room. Then he wanted to quietly sneak in and enjoy the flower and dew. Who knew that after all his hard work, it was Song Qingshu who benefited by mistake.\u201cSuch a good wine, it is so boring to drink this way.\u201d With the help of the wine, Song Qingshu had gradually relaxed, and gave a naughty look.\u201cMay I know what I should do to make it interesting?\u201d Xia Qingqing looked confused and looked at him with a smile.\u201cEveryone knows that wine can be enjoyed with two things: money and martial arts. But they often don\u2019t know that the most wonderful way to drink is with a warm fragrant beauty in their arms, and slowly drinking the wine from the beautiful woman\u2019s red lips.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes were full of evil charm, and he looked at her with a heated gaze.\u201cYoung Master knows that Youyou does not sell herself~\u201d Xia Qingqing didn\u2019t know why. Although she heard the other party\u2019s blatant teasing, she couldn\u2019t feel a trace of anger. She looked at Song Qingshu with her gentle and moist eyes. She suddenly felt a little silly, and her voice changed, getting more and more flirtatious, a lot more charming.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that because you didn\u2019t meet that destined person.\u201d Song Qingshu got up and came to Xia Qingqing\u2019s side, gently touched her smooth chin, and smiled slightly, \u201cI would like to be that person, and stay together until our hair turns white.\u201dXia Qingqing let him touch her chin, a trace of shyness flashed across her face, and her heart thumped like a deer. She felt like she had forgotten something important, and subconsciously felt this was wrong, but now was feeling lazy, without a trace of strength, and there was really no extra energy to think about anything else.Xia Qingqing turned around and bit her teeth. Her swaying skirt left Song Qingshu dazzled. She stretched out her slender hand, gently pressed Song Qingshu on the nearby stool, and took a drink with her right hand. She softly fell into Song Qingshu\u2019s arms, as if her body was without bones, and hooked her arms around his neck. She pasted her soft red lips on his, while Song Qingshu was in a daze.Song Qingshu felt that his teeth had been pried open by a flexible and soft object, and then he tasted the sweet wine that was delivered into his mouth from her sultry lips.After a long time, Xia Qingqing rested her hands on Song Qingshu\u2019s shoulders, her cheeks were flushed, and she looked at him with her heart in her eyes, \u201cIs it this way?\u201dFeeling her energetic and elastic figure sitting on his lap, Song Qingshu suddenly felt the heat three inches below his navel, and he couldn\u2019t resist bending over and kissed her.With a soft \u201cAh!\u201d, Xia Qingqing slowly closed her eyes, letting him continue his frivolous acts.\u201cThere are assassins!\u201d\u00a0[Goblin: (-_-)\u2026don\u2019t worry such interruptions almost doesn\u2019t happen in the future.]\u201cProtect Lord Wei!\u201dAt this time, a stern cry was heard from outside. Xia Qingqing seemed to have been awakened from a deep dream. She was shocked to find that she was in a really dangerous situation. As her thoughts cleared up, she was shocked and pushed Song Qingshu away. Along with a loud slap.\u201cMiss Youyou, you\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu touched his burning cheek, and he didn\u2019t expect that the woman who was still so affectionate a moment before suddenly changed her attitude and didn\u2019t recognize him anymore.As the scenes before now came back to her mind, Xia Qingqing wailed in her heart,\u00a0\u2018What is going on!\u2019She was awakened by all the screams from outside just now. She came down with a cold sweat, and the medicinal properties of the wine in her body had already been detoxified by more than half. She felt that her whole body was soft, and picked up the bottle on the table and smelled it. And, Xia Qingqing\u2019s face turned pale.She saw that Yuan Chengzhi was attacking a young man with braids from the gap in the window. It didn\u2019t take her very long to know that she had trapped the wrong person. She turned around, gritted her teeth and looked at Song Qingshu, \u201cYou\u2019re not Wei Xiaobao, who are you?\u201d\u201cUh, this humble one is Song Qingshu.\u201d Just what is it that went wrong, Song Qingshu still hadn\u2019t fully woken up from his daze, and subconsciously replied.Feeling cold on her chest, Xia Qingqing looked down and found that her dress was messy, and her nose turned sour. She was thinking out of a playful mentality, and despite her husband\u2019s objections, she volunteered to act as this famous courtesan. But, now\u2026Xia Qingqing couldn\u2019t help but shudder at the thought of letting her Big Brother Yuan see what she looked like at this moment, and she didn\u2019t care about finding Song Qingshu to settle the account. She clutched her neckline tightly, jumped out in the opposite direction, and disappeared into the night sky.Seeing her extremely brilliant movement technique, Song finally woke up. What kind of weak brothel courtesan was she? She was clearly a high level female martial artist!\u201cBrother Song, help!\u201d At this time Wei Xiaobao\u2019s stern cry came from outside.It turned out that after Yuan Chengzhi and other masters quietly dealt with the defense line that Duo Long deployed on the periphery, they led their men to rush in, and were preparing to catch turtles in the urn.Jiumozhi was worthy of being the highest level martial artist in the scene. The moment he perceived a trace of murderous intent, he pushed Wei Xiaobao a few meters away. With some sparks and flints, Wei Xiaobao avoided Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s one-hit-killing move that fell from the sky.The Blood Saber Elder and Shangjie seemed to have been waiting for this chance for a long time ago, and reached out their hands to grab Wei Xiaobao from both sides.Jiumozhi\u2019s plan was to reinvigorate Tubo, so he urgently needed to rely on Wei Xiaobao. How could he let him die here, so he hurriedly performed two flame blades and slashed them at the two assailants.The Blood Saber Elder and Shangje were shocked. If they continued to reach out to grab Wei Xiaobao, they wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid their arms being chopped off, so they had to choose defense.The Blood Saber Elder grabbed his Blood Saber, and slashed at the sword energy that was aiming at him. After a sound that seemed like a collision between fire and iron, the blood saber elder looked at the blood saber in his hand in a daze. That energy from the opponent that struck him a few feet away resulted in a tie!On the other side, Shangjie performed several big palm strikes in succession before blasting away the sword energy that struck him, but there was no more power left in them to counter attack the opponent. He was astonished in his heart. Although he was the number one master of the Shingon sect, Jiumozhi has been travelling the whole world for many years. He thought he was the number one person among the sects of Tantric Buddhism. But in this fight, he realized that his opponent\u2019s martial arts was much higher than his own.At the same time, Duo Long had already reacted, and quickly drew out his saber to guard in front of Wei Xiaobao. He blocked the Heavenly Dragon Sect leader Hong Antong who was waiting for an opportunity to attack.As the head of the Imperial Guard, Duo Long\u2019s martial arts was naturally not weak, but his martial arts was more suited for the battlefield. He was at a big disadvantage at this kind of one to one fighting. After a few moves, Hong Antong\u2019s palm strike drew blood. And Dou Long was sent falling down between tables and chairs on the side.Fortunately, his act of struggle managed to buy enough time. And, Wei Xiaobao finally reacted and ran to the side quickly, crying and howling, \u201cBrother Song, help!\u201dHong Antong grinned, then he jumped ahead like an eagle catching its prey. He was about to grab Wei Xiaobao\u2019s neck.At that moment, Hong Antong heard a sharp sound ripping through the air. That lightning-like momentum caused Hong Antong\u2019s expression to change drastically. With the help of his waist strength, he quickly turned over and avoided it, but it was a pity that although he used old tricks, he still was not enough to dodge it completely.Touching the newly punctured hole in his arm, Hong Antong looked back with a gloomy face and saw a wooden sword inserted in a pillar not far away, and the hilt of the sword was still trembling.\u201cAs an old master of martial arts, you actually attacked someone who doesn\u2019t know martial arts at all.\u201d Song Qingshu fluttered down from the second floor with a little movement of the tiptoe and stood in front of Wei Xiaobao.\u201cBig Brother Song, he is the sect leader Hong of the Mystic Dragon Cult. He is a powerful martial artist. You have to be careful.\u201d Wei Xiaobao hid behind Song Qingshu and finally felt relieved.\u201cSo you are the young man the blood saber elder talked so much about, and you really have some ability.\u201d As soon as his voice fell, Hong Antong disappeared from the place, attempting to smash Song Qingshu\u2019s face with a palm strike.When there were still a few feet to reach Song Qingshu, the expression on Hong Antong\u2019s face drastically changed, and he hurriedly withdrew his palm and jumped to the side. Unfortunately, it was still a little late, and his shoulder was wounded by a sword strike.Looking at the empty pillar, and then at the wooden sword that had returned to Song Qingshu\u2019s hand, Hong Antong said in shock, \u201cDragon Capturing Hand!\u201d\u00a0(Goblin: Imagine a Jedi master retrieving his lightsaber from a distance. Yes, our protagonist was also secretly a Jedi master. We\u2019ll be seeing a lot of this one.)Song Qingshu remained expressionless, but he was secretly proud of this move, this was actually just the \u201cThe Twin Dragons Fetch Water\u201d from the Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms. He improved it a bit, but it could achieve the same effect as the Dragon Capturing Hand. It was inspired by a kind of swordsmanship that he saw in fantasy movies in his previous life. Of course it was impossible to perform it to a fantastical extent, but it was very possible within a hundred meters.Hong Antong was very angry. Now he was injured twice by the opponent\u2019s wooden sword. The first sword strike was just fine, it was just a little skin trauma, but the second one injured his shoulder and left sword energy in his bones. He was afraid that he could now only perform at most seventy percent of his original martial arts.It wasn\u2019t that Hong Antong\u2019s martial arts was too low. The first sword attack happened suddenly, and Song Qingshu\u2019s time to release the sword was too clever. It happened when Hong Antong rose to the highest point and used his strength to gain momentum.As for the second sword strike, in Hong Antong\u2019s decades-long time as a martial artist he had never seen a long sword which after being shot a few meters away could fly back automatically. Without any precautions, it caused a flaw to open on his back. And he was wounded by the wooden sword that Song Qingshu had sucked back.Although Jiumozhi was busy fighting, he always paid attention to the scene on the field, and his expression improved when he saw this happen.Yuan Chengzhi, who was fighting against him, secretly complained. Today\u2019s matter was simply going through a set of twists and turns. First of all, Xia Qingqing mistook the wrong person and invited Song Qingshu into the room, causing everyone to be unable to capture Wei Xiaobao in secret.Later, when he thought about it again. It was not too bad that she took away Song Qingshu, the one with the highest level of martial arts. So they\u00a0 took this opportunity and wanted to quickly deal with Wei Xiaobao. They thought it would be foolproof, but there was another monk with higher martial arts!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His opponent\u2019s weapon was a snake-like long sword, with fierce and treacherous swordsmanship, as well as profound internal skills. In the blink of an eye, the two exchanged a dozen blows, and they didn\u2019t see a clear outcome.\u2018Why are there so many young martial arts masters in the central plains wulin?\u2019\u00a0Jiumozhi was surprised in his heart. That young master from the Murong clan was fine. Although his martial arts was good, it was actually a far cry from his reputation spread in the world. When Jiumozhi met Song Qingshu before, he dared not underestimate the young heroes of the wulin. He didn\u2019t expect to meet another one again today. The martial arts of this young man was not inferior to him.\u201cThe Golden Serpent King, Yuan Chengzhi?\u201d As his opponent\u2019s weapon was too distinctive, Jiumozhi\u2019s thoughts flashed, and finally remembered who his opponent was.\u201cMay I know who your excellency is?\u201d Yuan Chengzhi was a little embarrassed. In the past few years, he had made great progress in his martial arts.\u201cThe national master of the Tibetan Empire, Maha Cakra Vajra Jiumozhi greets the Golden Serpent King.\u201d Jiumozhi folded his palms together and secretly prepared the Ningma Temple\u2019s unique Flame Blade.Yuan Chengzhi was master in the art of sword, and the Golden Serpent Sword made a slight dragon-like sound, waiting for the opportunity to find the flaws exposed by his opponent.\u201cThis monk is too powerful. I will hold him back. You two join hands and make it a quick fight. It will be bad if the officers and soldiers of the Qing court react.\u201d Yuan Chengzhi said in a deep voice, but he did not dare to look at them. He kept his eyes on Jiumozhi.Seeing that he opened his mouth to talk, Jiumozhi thought that his opponent\u2019s attention was divided, so his eyes lit up, and he took this opportunity to deceive him and launch an attack.Yuan Chengzhi was weary of his unpredictable Flame Blade, and Jiumozhi was also a little spooked by his weird swordsmanship. Therefore, although Yuan Chengzhi missed the first opportunity, he was still able to secure the upper hand.Jiumozhi was feeling anxious in his heart, and he was dragged into the flow of his opponent. If he wanted to reach a clear victory or defeat, he probably had to fight for hundreds or more moves. The three on the other side were all martial arts masters. Under their combined attack, Song Qingshu might not be able to last that long.Seeing that the situation was not good, Duo Long on the side slipped out from the door and summoned the soldiers of the Qing Camp.The blood saber elder and Shangjie slowly walked around Song Qingshu, and together with Hong Antong, the three of them firmly surrounded Song Qingshu.\u201cThe three of you all have a lot of background in the martial arts. You all together are more than ten times older than our Young Master. And here you are attacking him together, don\u2019t you feel any shame!\u201d Shui Sheng was about to run away in the chaos, but when she saw Song Qingshu being surrounded by three people, she couldn\u2019t help but sneer.\u201cThis little lady is so pretty, she seems really appetizing to this elder.\u201d The Bood Saber Elder had destroyed the purity of countless ladies, and there was no way he wouldn\u2019t realize that this was a woman disguised as a man. He glanced at Shui Sheng, his eyes full of greed.Shangjie just touched his nose in embarrassment, and felt indignant. Noticing that the two of them didn\u2019t want to make the first move, he decided to save some face in front of the other two. He performed gestures as if he was holding a ball in the middle of both palms. It was his most powerful palm technique, the Great Luminous Palm.Facing this attack at such a close distance, Song Qingshu felt that the air around him seemed to turn cold and his face changed. He quickly pointed his sword above and stabbed a few imaginary points in the air.Shangjie\u00a0was horrified. This young man was so young, but his martial art attainment was like an old master. The few points he stabbed just now happened to be on the weak nodes of the aura he created, and they were the biggest weakness of his palm technique. His technique created a force field of a few meters in advance to create an advantage. The stronger the force field, the more it will affect the opponent\u2019s judgement and the ability to counterattack.Who knew that before the formation of the Great Luminous Palm could be completed, the force field was suddenly scattered by the opponent\u2019s fierce sword aura!Sang Jie snorted, with a trace of blood showing at the corner of his mouth. It was clear that he had suffered serious internal injuries.Song Qingshu was also not unscathed. Although he broke his opponents\u2019 major palm attack with little effort, but Shangjie was after all a master from one of the four major sects of Tibetan Empire.\u201cYoung Master Song, be careful!\u201d Wang Yuyan subconsciously exclaimed.Duan Yu gave her a complicated look and sourly said, \u201cMiss Wang, let\u2019s take advantage of this chaos, otherwise we won\u2019t be able to leave anytime soon, no matter which side wins.\u201d\u201cBut Young Master Song was so kind to me, how can I leave him at such a critical moment?\u201d Wang Yuyan replied with a frown. She watched the several people fighting fiercely in the field, and simulated a few tactics in her mind.\u00a0\u2018What should I do to help Song Qingshu?\u2019\u201cWhat kind of kindness did he show to Miss Wang,\u201d Duan\u00a0 Yu murmured, \u201cDidn\u2019t you see that he, Wei Xiaobao and Jiumozhi were acting like brothers?\u201d\u201cYoung Master Duan\u2019s words are quite true.\u201d With a loud voice, a handsome young man walked in.Looking at the incoming person, Duan Yu spoke in a nonchalant manner, \u201cGood to see you Master Murong.\u201d\u201cCousin!\u201d Wang Yuyan turned her head in surprise and saw her cousin who had come to rescue her. She couldn\u2019t help but feel sore in her nose and almost cried.It turned out that after knowing that Wang Yuyan had been captured by Jiumozhi, Murong Fu hurriedly followed him with his family forces, and they finally caught up today.Wang Yuyan\u2019s affectionate way of calling her \u201cCousin\u201d really stung Duan Yu\u2019s heart, but he was helpless, so he picked up the wine glass on the table and poured himself a glass of wine.\u201cCousin, Young Master Duan was captured by the monk Jiumozhi in order to save me, and now his acupoints have been sealed.\u201d Wang Yuyan woke up from her bliss and quickly said.\u201cThank you Young Master Duan for your help.\u201d Murong Fu slightly smiled, and he unsealed Jiumozhi\u2019s restrictions with a few gestures of his hand.\u201cYoung Master Duan, why don\u2019t we catch that evil monk Jiumozhi together and demand some justice for my cousin?\u201d Murong Fu looked around the scene, and the situation was immediately clear in his heart.\u201cI dare not decline your offer!\u201d Duan Yu was tortured by Jiumozhi along the way. But he had to suppress his resentment. Seeing that Kumazhi was fighting a young man with a serpent sword in his hand, he didn\u2019t even think twice about it. He just directly jumped into the fray.Jiumozhi now had the upper hand in the fight. And he had long been paying attention to the surrounding movements. So, when he noticed Duan Yu\u2019s Six Meridians Divine Sword, he quickly dodged.However, because of this, the advantage that had been established with great difficulty just now was lost. Yuan Chengzhi finally had the chance to show his skills, and suddenly sent a fierce offensive. With this the offensive and defensive situation between the two immediately reversed.\u201cThis humble one is Murong Fu of Gusu. I\u2019m here to help your Excellency.\u201d Murong Fu knew that he definitely was not Kumazhi\u2019s opponent in a one on one match. So, how could he miss such a good opportunity? He jumped ahead and immediately drew his sword to launch an attack.Of course, if he fought Jiumozhi alone, Murong Fu didn\u2019t have any chance to win, but at this moment he had the help of two young martial arts masters. Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s swordsmanship was strange and weird. Murong Fu\u2019s swordsmanship, on the other hand, combined the strengths of several experts and was also incomparably exquisite and dangerous.Shui Sheng glanced at the scene with a complicated expression, her eyes kept wandering, and her heart became irritated when she thought that Song Qingshu and that courtesan had done some unspeakable deeds in that room just now.Hearing Wang Yuyan\u2019s \u201ccousin\u201d again, she couldn\u2019t help but think of her childhood sweetheart. It was the cousin she was infatuated with for so long. So, Shui Sheng fiercely stomped, turned around and ran away.Now let\u2019s talk about the other side of the hall. Song Qingshu felt his right hand go numb, and at that moment the blood saber elder launched an attack. Originally, Song Qingshu had a way to escape alone, but when he remembered that Wei Xiaobao, who had no resistance was behind him. That guy would meet a gruesome end if he was caught. Many of his future plans were dependent on him, and he couldn\u2019t let it all go to waste.He pulled Wei Xiaobao by his shoulders, and jumped to the second floor. He was planning to jump out of the three-person encirclement and then deal with them separately.What he didn\u2019t know was that Hong Antong had been gathering momentum for a long time, and it was at this moment that he rushed out like lightning, hitting on Song Qingshu back with a palm strike.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At this moment, she didn\u2019t radiate that charm of an enchantress. She had a very dignified expression.Shangjie tapped Song Qingshu\u2019s major acupoints with his fingers and restrained him. Then he raised his head and wondered, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Madam Yuan let me kill him?\u201d\u201cThis Madame still has important things to ask him, thank you all for helping me catch him.\u201d Xia Qingqing put her hands on her right waist, bowed a little by bending her knees, and was really polite.Shangjie and Hong Antong were not that affected. The former is a monk, and had not been close to any member of the opposite sex for many years. The latter had a sweet wife at home and didn\u2019t have any spare time to irrigate foreign fields. Therefore, although the two admired her beauty, they didn\u2019t have any other thoughts.The Blood Saber Elder, however, was different. Looking at Xia Qingqing\u2019s slim willow waist, he couldn\u2019t resist stepping forward to help her up. There was a fleeting greed in his eyes . But when he thought of the martial arts level of her husband, he secretly sighed,\u00a0\u2018This little lady is quite the beauty, and that girl who pretended to be a man just now was also not bad.\u2019Song Qingshu bitterly smiled. He didn\u2019t expect that she saved his life in the end. Thinking of the tenderness between the two in that room, he couldn\u2019t help but feel his heart sway.Noting his gaze, Xia Qingqing knew what he was thinking, and her pretty face couldn\u2019t help but flush red. She pretended to turn her head to observe the situation on the other side, and stopped looking at him.Although Jiumozhi was at a disadvantage, he still managed to parry, but when he noticed that Song Qingshu was badly wounded and captured from the corner of his eye, he couldn\u2019t help but feel chills in his heart. Thinking that he would really go to see the Buddha if he stayed here to fight any longer.He quickly performed a Flame Blade to force Yuan Chengzhi and Murong Fu away, and jumped towards Song Qingshu, \u201cMaster Song, this poor monk is here to save you!\u201dShangjie and Hong Antong were shocked, and both preprader themselves to receive Jiumozhi\u2019s attack in the air. However, this in fact was originally an act from Jiumozhi. His palm strike looked terrifying, but in fact, he used no more than half of his strength. When his attack connected with Shangjie and Hong Antong, with the help of the repelling force, his body smashed through the side window of the pavilion like lightning, disappearing in the night sky. No one thought of this kind of development, Yuan Chengzhi and others feared his martial arts, and no one wanted to continue chasing him.\u201cLord Wei, Master Song, this poor monk will go ahead to invite more masters. I will come back to rescue you.\u201d Jiumozhi\u2019s voice floated far away.\u201cYour companion is really loyal.\u201d Xia Qingqing stood beside Song Qingshu with a sneer.\u201cUnexpectedly, traveling with him together on the road for many days is not as good as a moments friendship with the Miss.\u201d Song Qingshu sighed, \u201cLady Qingqing cares about me in her heart, what a kind woman. I should have thought about this a long time ago.\u201dWhen Wei Xiaobao saw that the situation was not good, he quickly changed his face, \u201cMaster Hong, we are good friends! We shall enjoy eternal good fortune, and longevity under the heavens!\u201d\u201cBlood Saber Elder is virtuous, with a kind heart!\u201d\u201cGreat Monk, you have the heart of Buddha, your kindness towards all living things is as great as the ocean!\u201dSeeing his string of incoherent flattery, everyone just sneered, which caused Wei Xiaobao to sigh, \u201cShi*t, this grandpa is done for. If you spare my life today, I promise to visit temples and listen to scriptures. I will be a good person after 16 years!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you people from the Central Plains say, \u2018I will be a good person after 18 years!?\u201d Shangjie thought he had remembered it wrong, and looked at his companion suspiciously.\u201cThis grandpa thinks that eighteen years is too long. I want to come out two years early.\u201d Wei Xiaobao glared, he realized that there was no way to escape today, so he didn\u2019t sugarcoat his words.\u201cEveryone, the officers and soldiers outside the city will arrive in a moment. It\u2019s better for us to leave early.\u201d Yuan Chengzhi walked over and reminded them.\u201cSince I have rescued my cousin, I won\u2019t bother you anymore. Let\u2019s part our ways here.\u201d Murong Fu clasped his fists in his hands, but thought differently in his heart.\u00a0\u2018The Golden Serpent King, Great Monk Shangjie and the sect masters of the Heavenly Dragon Sect and Blood Saber Sest were all influential and powerful. They might have been helpful to our plan. It\u2019s a pity that they attacked and detained Wei Xiaobao, the most favored official of the Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. I am afraid that they will usher in a tragic revenge. I still don\u2019t want to swim in this muddy water. It is unwise to offend the Qing Dynasty.\u2019\u201cThe reputation of Master Murong is indeed well-deserved. This Yuan is honored to fight side by side with Master Murong.\u201d Just now the two teamed up to deal with Jiumozhi. Yuan Chengzhi really admired the profoundness and subtleness of his martial arts .\u201cCousin, Young Master Song\u2026\u201d Wang Yuyan pulled Murong Fu\u2019s sleeves and looked at Song Qingshu, who looked languid, with worry in her eyes.\u201cThank you Miss Wang for your concern. This Song won\u2019t die for a while. You don\u2019t have to care about me. I believe that since the Heavens got me into this world, it won\u2019t let me die so easily, hahaha\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu spit out some blood, and his laughter was full of desolation.Song Qingshu knew Murong Fu\u2019s true nature of favouring advantages and avoidance of disadvantages. With so many masters on the scene, it was impossible for him to rescue him. He reckoned that Murong Fu would come up with a large set of high-sounding reasons and tactfully refuse him.\u2018Why should I listen to some hypocritical words and be disgusted when I\u2019m about to die?\u2019\u201cWe haven\u2019t met for so long, Young Master Song is still so open-minded. Cousin, this is not a place to stay for a long time, let\u2019s go.\u201d Murong Fu took Wang Yuyan and disappeared at the entrance of the pavilion.\u201cMiss Wang, wait for me.\u201d Duan Yu hurried to catch up.After Song Qingshu and Wei Xiaobao were tied up, they were thrown into a carriage, and their group of people hurried out of the city.When Duo Long finally led the soldiers to the Spring Beauty Pavilion and looked at the guards lying on the ground, Wei Xiaobao had disappeared, and his face went pale. He gave an urgent order, \u201cQuickly go out of the city to chase them!\u201dYuan Chengzhi and his party were well prepared. They were in disguise, their escape route was very tricky, and the chasing troops were quickly thrown away.When stopping to rest at noon one day, the Blood Saber Elder gave Wei Xiaobao a fierce look, then turned his head and said to Yuan Chengzhi, \u201cGolden Serpent King, why didn\u2019t you kill this kid with a single slash, and take him with us to escape?\u201dThe Blood Saber Elder and Shangjie would have to leave Yangzhou, and they were afraid that Wei Xiaobao will be rescued again, causing the mission to fail. So they followed Yuan Chengzhi and his party all the way. But they have been very impatient about the situation in Tibet these days and the blood saber elder finally asked out loud.\u201cThis Yuan intends to bring this dog official back to the Golden SerpentCamp and invite the leaders of the rebel army in Shandong to come and kill him as a sacrifice to the flag together. So as to strengthen the momentum of the rebel army in Shandong.\u201d Yuan Chengzhi thought of the situation of the rebel army since the Kangxi Emperor came to power. His heart felt sad, the morale of the rebels in recent years has been somewhat low, and they have long lost the spirit they had in the beginning. He hoped that by killing the Emperor\u2019s dear friend and beloved official, he could cheer up the hearts of the people.Wei Xiaobao felt a chill in his heart when he listened to him, and thought,\u00a0\u2018Fu*k! This little shit looks loyal and honest, how can he be so cruel? If I go back with him, I will be beheaded. On the contrary, this fierce looking blood saber elder\u2026\u2019With a sharp look in his eyes, he immediately made up his mind and shouted, \u201cOh, I want to urinate.\u201dThe Blood Saber Elder just walked up to him and said impatiently, \u201cJust pee where you are!\u201dWei Xiaobao showed a flattering smile, \u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t matter to me. It\u2019s just that the urine underneath will have a fishy and nasty smell, which inevitably affects this elder\u2019s appetite in eating.\u201d\u201cHow unlucky!\u201d The Blood Saber Elder threw the biscuits aside, lifted him to a place ten meters away, and untied the rope on his body, \u201cHey, hurry up, if you dare to run, this elder will break your legs.\u201d\u201cHey, how dare I! In fact, Xiaobao just wants to talk to you, elder.\u201d Wei Xiaobao smiled and looked at him, he didn\u2019t have the appearance of urgency from before.\u201cWhy should I listen to you?\u201d The Blood Saber Elder disdainfully turned his head.\u201cElder, do you think that your task will be completed even if I die?\u201d Wei Xiaobao asked instead, disregarding his show of disdain.\u201cNaturally, so you should hurry up and die.\u201d The Blood Saber Elder glared at him fiercely.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, how ridiculous!\u201d Wei Xiaobao shook his head while laughing and looked at him with pity.The Blood Saber Elder stared straight at him and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhat are you laughing at.\u201d\u201cI laughed at you because you are a silly monk and good for nothing. You are so stupit that you don\u2019t even realize the situation you are in.\u201d Wei Xiaobao glanced at him contemptuously.\u201cKid, you don\u2019t have to provoke discord.\u201d the Blood Saber Elder smiled, \u201cThis elder has eaten more salt than a kid like you.\u201d\u201cThat Yuan Chengzhi is very cunning. He will kill me to get the support of the Shandong Rebels and increase his prestige. What kind of benefits will you get if I die?\u201d Wei Xiaobao asked with a sneer.\u201cHow could it not be beneficial for us?\u201d said the blood saber elder. \u201cThe Seventh Prince wanted you dead. We have the same purpose as Yuan Chengzhi, and we will get what we need.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good as long as you get what you need, is it?\u201d Wei Xiaobao sneered. \u201cWhat is the purpose of your prince behind wanting me dead? Now, tell me, what is our current location?\u201d\u201cNaturally, he wants to get rid of Kangxi\u2019s right hand man, hey!\u2026No!\u201d The Blood Saber Elder was shocked, and realized that the Seventh Prince was actually mainly wanted to destroy the alliance between the Manchus and the Song Dynasty. In order to achieve that he had to kill Wei Xiaobao inside the domain of the Song Dynasty. That condition was a must!If the envoys all die in the host\u2019s domain, then the alliance will naturally be impossible to talk about. Then due to the anger of Kangxi, there may even be a war with the Song Court in the name of justice.But now Wei Xiaobao has already left the Song domain and he is in the Manchu Qing Dynasty!\u201cHmph, it is still enough to break Kangxi\u2019s arm.\u201d The Blood Saber Elder still insisted on his decision.\u201cHey, although it is a bit embarrassing to say, I still have to confess. I, Wei Xiaobao, besides combing his beard and horses, and embezzling and accepting bribes, what else can I actually do? How can I be regarded as the right arm of the Emperor?\u201d Wei Xiaobao said with a bitter face, \u201cIf you really let me die, you won\u2019t have a chance to join the forces of the Seventh Prince in the future.\u201dThe Blood Saber Elder huffed, \u201cHow is that possible!\u201d\u201cThink about it, in the eyes of the Seven Princes, you failed to kill me in Song Kingdom. This is nothing but incompetence. Later, you managed to catch me, but didn\u2019t bring me back to Mongolia, and used the opportunity to threaten our Emperor. You even let other people kill me, this is stupidity! Such an incompetent and brainless person, how can the Seventh Prince rest assured to use you again?\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s smile became more and more treacherous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then he tied up Wei Xiaobao and returned to the camp.Wei Xiaobao knew that his words worked, because he saw that the Blood Saber Elder immediately found Shangjie, then the two pointed and whispered to each other.\u201cElder, I think what that kid said is reasonable.\u201d Shangjie\u2019s expression was full of uncertainty.\u201cThen how about we take him back to the Mongolian grassland?\u201d The Blood Saber Elder\u2019s eyes flashed.\u201cIt\u2019s just that Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s martial arts is too high, and now I\u2019m also hurt by Song Qingshu\u2019s sword qi. I\u2019m afraid you and I will not be able to escape.\u201d In the last battle, Song Qingshu pierced his principal mudra with his sword, so Shangjie had already suffered a lot. His internal injuries were really severe.\u201cWhat about this old man?\u201d With a long laugh, Hong Antong came out from the shadows. It turned out that he had been coveting the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters in Wei Xiaobao\u2019s possession, so he didn\u2019t want to watch him die.It\u2019s a pity that he was alone here. Neither the Blood Saber Elder nor Shangjie was inferior to him, and Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s martial arts was significantly higher than him. So he dared not to act rashly for a while. Due to that he had to pay attention to the movement of the Blood Saber Elder and Shangjie. And when he heard the content of their conversation, he couldn\u2019t resist jumping out of joy.Seeing the three old foxes whispering to each other in the distance, Wei Xiaobao breathed a sigh of relief, thinking that his little life was finally saved. If they were to take him to Mongolia, he might not die. Maybe he will be able to survive for a while in Mongolia with his gift of the gab. It was also not impossible for the Seventh Prince to let himself go. Thinking of his future, Wei Xiaobao couldn\u2019t resist giggling on his own.On the other side, Song Qingshu was tied to a temporary pillar, and on the surface his face looked wilted. But in fact, he was secretly circulating his true qi and hitting the acupoints all over his body according to the method of unsealing the acupoints in the Nine Yin Scripture.Suddenly a sweet scent wafted to his nose. Feeling his rapidly beating heart, Song Qingshu opened his eyes and saw a light green skirt dangling in front of him. He looked up and said, \u201cIt turns out that it is Miss Youyo\u2026 Ah no, Madame Yuan.\u201d\u201cHow is your injury?\u201d Xia Qingqing frowned lightly, thinking that he was hit by Hong Antong\u2019s hand before and was also injured in the hands of the other two, so she couldn\u2019t help but look worried.\u201cThank you Madame Yuan for your concern. I\u2019m just feeling a little faint and won\u2019t die for a while.\u201d Song Qingshu leaned back on the pillar and looked at Xia Qingqing with a playful expression, \u201cMay I know why Miss Youyou didn\u2019t come to see me?\u201dHer face blushed with a shade of red. But she felt relieved that he didn\u2019t pierce that layer of barirer, so Xia Qingqing took the opportunity to pretend to be dumb, \u201cMiss Youyou hates you so much, how could it be possible for her to see you again.\u201d\u201cHaah, after saying goodbye that day, I\u2019m afraid there will be no time for this Song and Youyou to see each other again.\u201d Song Qingshu understood that that day it was only Xia Qingqing acting as a courtesan in order to lure Wei Xiaobao. Looking at Xia Qingqing, who was now dignified and generous, Song Qingshu realized that the famous courtesan of Spring Beauty Pavilion, who was naturally charming and enchanting had disappeared forever.\u201cHumph!\u201d During the two days she was alone, Xia Qingqing couldn\u2019t help but feel stunned every time she recalled the scene of her intimate actions with him in her mind. Although the two of them did not cross that final barrier, the feeling of mingling with each other, body and soul made that experience unforgettable forever.In addition, she quite liked Song Qingshu\u2019s image of a graceful and suave scholarly young master. So, although she was angry that he had taken advantage of her, she still had a lot of affection for him in her heart.Therefore, afterwards, when she realized that there was something in the wine, she didn\u2019t suspect that it was his doing. She inferred that it was a mischievous trick the Spring Beauty Pavilion used to service their guests.\u201cI couldn\u2019t finish some snacks, and I feel that it\u2019s a pity to throw them away. Seeing that you are being so pitiful here, I will treat you as a little cat and puppy. You are benefitting here.\u201d Xia Qingqing put a wooden box full of snacks beside him. Then turned around to leave.\u201cMadame, please stay.\u201d Looking at Xia Qingqing who turned around in amazement, Song Qingshu gestured with a wry smile, \u201cLook at my situation. I am now tied up and can\u2019t move a muscle.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to loosen the rope for you?\u201d Xia Qingqing was not a fool either, and shook her head, \u201cYour martial arts is too high, I don\u2019t want to risk it.\u201d\u201cHow can I embarrass Madame?\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes were full of reminiscence, \u201cI just thought that if Miss Youyou was by my side, she would definitely feed me gently.\u201dXia Qingqing\u2019s complexion was fluctuating, but this ambiguous stimulus made her feel excited. After hesitating for a moment, she squatted down beside him, and picked up a piece of sweet-scented osmanthus cake with her two green jade-like fingers. When Song Qingshu\u2019s lips came closer, she murmured, \u201cThis lady is just worried that you will starve to death, so don\u2019t think too much.\u201dSong Qingshu smiled knowingly, opened his mouth and bit the soft sweet-scented osmanthus cake.Xia Qingqing\u2019s fingers were quickly taken back as if they were scalded, without giving him a chance to do anything.Turning his eyes, Song Qingshu pretended to inadvertently ask, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the Madame accompany the Golden Serpent King, but came here to chat with a lowly prisoner?\u201d\u201cA middle-aged scholar came to see Brother Yuan. They are having a secret meeting in the main tent. I don\u2019t understand the discussion. I felt bored, so I just went outside to get some fresh air.\u201d Xia Qingqing\u2019s face flushed. In fact, she took the opportunity to give Song Qingshu something to eat. She didn\u2019t know why she did it, she just subconsciously wanted to get close to Song Qingshu.Of course, it wasn\u2019t that Xia Qingqing was fascinated by Song Qingshu\u2019s shocking domineering spirit, and mindlessly fell in love with him.She was doing it just out of a playful mentality. She enjoyed the feeling of speeding up her heart, it was like walking on a steel wire. If Song Qingshu really wanted to do anything to her, she would never let him succeed.\u201cAh!\u201d As Xia Qingqing was lost in her thoughts, her two fingers were caught by the man before her. The moist sucking sensation coming from her fingertips shocked her, she quickly stood up and glared at Song Qingshu with her ears burning in shame.\u201cNo matter how sweet the sweet-scented osmanthus cake is, it can never taste better than Madame\u2019s slender hands.\u201d Song Qingshu stared at her without showing any weakness, his voice full of flirtation.\u2018Xia Qingqing, you are really crazy!\u2019\u00a0Shaking her head fiercely, and\u00a0 looking at the hateful appearance of this man, Xia Qingqing suddenly stretched out her leg to kick Song Qingshu\u2019s waist. Then she lifted her fragrant skirt and ran away.\u201cOh, you can\u2019t kick a man around that place. If Madame\u2019s kick harms the happiness of certain people, you will have to take responsibility.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s ridiculous laughter came from behind her.Watching Xia Qingqing\u2019s disappearing back, Song Qingshu said with a wry smile, \u201cI still can\u2019t get rid of my flirting problem.\u201dHe thought of his previous life in his company. He used to flirt with beautiful subordinates in this way. Song Qingshu looked at the majestic mountains in the distance, leaned back on the pillar behind him, and sighed,\u00a0\u2018I have been in this world for so long. My new lifestyle and habits make me more and more afraid. I fear that when I wake up, I will only treat the memory of my previous life as a dream. Only in this way, I will not forget who I am.\u2019In the main tent, Yuan Chengzhi looked at a man of great prestige in the wulin with a shocked expression, \u201cWhat! Wei Xiaobao is a member of the Heaven and Earth Society?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Flower Stealing MasterCH 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69: The Heaven and Earth Society - Goblinslate\u201cYes, Xiaobao is my disciple. He has been undercover in the Qing court and has made a lot of contributions to the Heaven and Earth Society. If it weren\u2019t for this critical situation, I wouldn\u2019t want to reveal his identity. I hope that Master Yuan will keep this a secret.\u201d This middle-aged schooler was none other than the leader of the\u00a0 Heaven and Earth Society who is described as, \u201cif you don\u2019t know Chen Jinnan, then you are not a man of wulin.\u201dIt turned out that the Heaven and Earth Society followers were scattered across the world and discovered that Shandong Wulin was plotting to assassinate Wei Xiaobao. Chen Jinnan was shocked when he received the news, and spent day and night mobilizing all connections to investigate the news, and finally caught up with Yuan Chengzhi and others today.\u201cMaster Chen, your Heaven and Earth Society aims to oppose the Qing Dynasty and restore the Ming Dynasty, and I am also against the Qing Dynasty, but the former Ming Emperor and I have some enmity, you and I are not on the same side.\u201d Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s words made Chen Jinnan\u2019s heart turn cold. But, before Chen Jinnan could speak he continued, \u201cBut this Yuan has always admired Chen\u2019s master\u2019s demeanor, and doesn\u2019t want to be mortal enemies with each other. I can let Wei Xiaobao go, but I will need something in return. I need to give an explanation to my brothers.\u201dChen Jinnan also understood his difficulties. After planning for so long, if they saw that it was all a useless effort in the end, anyone would feel resentful in their heart. So, he smiled slightly, \u201cChen is willing to go to Shandong with Brother Yuan to discuss the matter of forming an alliance. In the future, the forces in Shandong and the Heaven and Earth Society will be working together. We are looking forward to working with the Golden Serpent Camp.\u201dYuan Chengzhi was overjoyed. Chen Jinnan has great prestige in the wulin. He personally went to Shandong to form an alliance with the Golden Serpent Camp. This news would definitely boost the morale of the volunteers, not to mention the future activities of the Golden Serpent Camp in Shandong. In the face of such great support, a single Wei Xiaobao was irrelevant.\u201cIn this case, this Yuan will arrange someone to rescue Wei Xiaobao secretly so as not to expose his identity.\u201d Yuan Chengzhi suddenly thought of something, and frowned, \u201cIt\u2019s just that there is some difficulty now.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the difficulty?\u201d Chen Jinnan was startled, and asked in a hurry.\u201cThere are three great foreign sect leaders who are acting with me this time, the sect leader of the Heavenly Dragon Sect, the Blood Saber Elder, and the number one master of Shingon Sect, Shangjie. If they find out, and join forces, this Yuan alone may not be their opponent.\u201d Yuan Chengzhi secretly thought,\u00a0\u2018Fortunately, both of them are injured now, so I think I can barely win.\u2019\u201cAlthough this Chen is not talented, I have some accomplishments in martial arts. I have long heard that the leader of Heavenly Dragon Sect Hong Antong is an extremely talented martial artist, and I have always wanted to exchange some pointers. If necessary, this Chen can at least deal with Hong Antong, and everything else depends on the Golden Serpent King.\u201d Chen Jinnan had recently practiced the Divine Blood Clotting Claws to kill people while undetected, so even if he couldn\u2019t win against his opponent, he won\u2019t lose that easily.\u201cMaster Chen is being polite\u2026\u201d Before Yuan Chengzhi finished speaking, he suddenly heard a scream from outside. He quickly moved and rushed out of the tent like a light smoke. Chen Jinnan looked at it with endless admiration. He also realized that this young man\u2019s martial arts might be much better than him.Yuan Chengzhi rushed out of the tent and found that the Blood Saber Elder was carrying Wei Xiaobao, he had already killed two Golden Serpent Camp disciples who were blocking the road, and was about to flee down the mountain. Yuan Chengzi raised his hand, and three Golden Serpent Darts flew out from his cuffs, sealing the escape path of the Blood Saber Elder. Then he jumped and arrived a few feets behind the Blood Saber Elder.\u201cBlood Saber Elder, what are you doing!\u201d Yuan Chengzhi looked at him in shock and anger.\u201cHey, is there anything wrong if this elder wants to capture this little rabbit? You want to kill him anyway. So, Golden Serpent King, why don\u2019t you push the boat along the river and let me take this trash off your hands and use it for something productive?\u201d The Blood Saber Elder grinned, holding the Blood Saber in his right hand. His internal energy covered his whole body, secretly guarding against any sudden attacks.\u2018You old shi*t, you are a trash, and your whole family is trash!\u2019\u00a0Wei Xiaobao was being carried on his shoulders, his eyes rolled, and he was screaming in his heart.\u201cThis Yuan brought Wei Xiaobao to Shandong for his own use, and didn\u2019t bother to discuss it with the Elder. But, Your Excellency killed my brothers, and now\u00a0 if you want to leave, it would be too whimsical.\u201d A golden light flashed, and the Golden Serpent Sword was already in his hands.Seeing that the atmosphere was tense and a fight was on the verge of breaking out, Shangjie hurried over to persuade him, \u201cWhy are two fighting? The Qing army is still chasing us. If you fight each other here wouldn\u2019t it only benefit our enemies, and Blood Saber Elder, you said yourself that the Seventh Prince asked us to assassinate Wei Xiaobao, what use is there if you catch him now\u2026\u201dShangjie spoke as he walked over. At the very moment he was closer to Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s side, his eyes flashed, and he performed a palm strike. In addition to the Tantric Deity Yoga, he performed the powerful Heavenly Secret Mudra from the Major Mudras and landed a palm strike on Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s ribs.Yuan Chengzhi had just learned a shocking huge secret from Chen Jinnan, and discovered that the Blood Saber Elder had suddenly abandoned the alliance. His heart was unstable at the moment, and he was firmly hit by Shangjie\u2019s sneak attack, and blood spurted wildly from his mouth.After landing a hit, Shangjie hurriedly backed away, but he was not fast enough. He only saw a flash of golden light, and let out a scream. He retreated several feet, cold sweat poured down from his shivering back and his arm was severed by that Golden Serpent Sword on the ground. He felt very regretful in his heart,\u00a0\u2018If only I could practice to the second realm of the Yoga Tantra, the Great Yoga Tantra, or even to a higher incomparable realm of Yoga Tantra. Then that palm strike just now would have been enough to kill Yuan Chengzhi, and he would not have had to have his arms almost cut off by his counterattack.\u2019At this stage of the confrontation, Hong Antong also decided to launch an attack. Among the three masters, he had the highest internal strength. If he was slapped by his palm strike, Yuan Chengzhi would lose his life on the spot.At that moment, a person jumped out and stood in front of Hong Antong.\u201cDivine Blood Clotting Claw!\u201d Feeling a few strands of dark energy cascading up along the meridians of his arm, Hong Antong\u2019s heart tightened, and he immediately used his internal energy to force it out of his body.The three of them wanted to quietly take Wei Xiaobao away, but they were afraid of Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s high martial arts, and feared that they would be chased down, so they simply decided to attack first.The Blood Saber Elder realized that this man who suddenly appeared was not weaker in martial arts than them, and knew that the situation was not good, so he hurriedly carried Wei Xiaobao and ran away.\u201cIt turned out to be Master Chen of the Heaven and Earth Society. Today I have some important matters to attend to, and I shall continue our discussion on a later day.\u201d Looking at the seriously injured Yuan Chengzhi, Hong Antong thought that his goal had been achieved, so he no longer wanted to fight, and he turned and left.Shangjie sealed the big hole in his arm, and staggered away to the other side. He was seriously injured, and feared that he would be attacked by the other two old foxes, so he dared not follow them in the same direction.When Chen Jinnan saw the injured Yuan Chengzhi, he didn\u2019t go to stop him, and quickly came to Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s side to help him heal his injuries.\u201cThank you, Master Chen, now I have no serious problems. I can take care of it within a few days, but it is a pity that Wei Xiaobao was taken away by them.\u201d Yuan Chengzhi was really frightened this time around. If it weren\u2019t for Chen Jinnan blocking the attack by Hong Antong, he would\u2019ve been sent to the underworld. The qi from the Major Mudra didn\u2019t weaken, and it was really not possible to force it out on the spot. Those savage sect leaders believe in the strong, and their internal strengths were fierce. Each of them firmly stood on the top of their respective sects. Their vision and ability to grasp opportunities to attack were really not to be underestimated.\u201cBrother Yuan was conspired by those villains because he was worrying about the life of my apprentice. How could this Chen watch you get into a dangerous situation?\u201d Chen Jinnan restrained his anger, stood up and said, \u201cSince Brother Yuan is okay, Chen wants to save him. I will go to Shandong afterwards.\u201d*****In the distance, Song Qingshu watched the fierce battle between the two sides, and turned his head to smile at a soldier of the Golden Serpent Camp who was passing by him, \u201cLittle brother, I can see that you are very talented and was surprised by the quality of your bones. You are definitely a martial arts genius who is seen only once in a century. Come, come. I have a great fortune for you!\u201d\u00a0(Goblin: Song Qingshu is a troll. This is my all time favorite line from any movie, right next to \u201cI am your father!\u201d.)The soldier was about to turn his head and scold him, but when he met Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes, he felt dizzy in his mind. He only felt that the opponent\u2019s eyes seemed to be an endless black hole, and he involuntarily walked over to him.\u201cLittle brother, stretch out your finger, tap this spot on my shoulder.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s words were full of magnetism.The truth was that, although he circulated his true qi to continuously hit the acupuncture points according to the method of Nine Yin Scriptures, because his acupoints were sealed by several masters at the same time, he couldn\u2019t simply force it open even after trying for a long time. When he saw that the two sides were fighting not far away and didn\u2019t have any time to pay attention here. He knew that this opportunity could not be lost, and he hurriedly performed the \u2018Bewitching Technique\u2019 and unsealed all the acupuncture points all over his body with the help of this soldier\u2019s external force.As soon as his acupoints were unsealed, Song Qingshu got back his strength, and the rope that tied to his body turned to shreds. He rose up into the sky with a long scream, \u201cThe gift I received a few days ago should have been repaid in double, but considering the face of Miss Youyou, I won\u2019t kick a man when he is down and will let the little shit surnamed Yuan go.\u201dSong Qingshu laughed like a maniac for a while, and disappeared in the depths of the woods with a flash.Chen Jinnan\u2019s expression changed drastically and looked at the direction Song Qingshu disappeared, \u201cThis young man\u2019s internal strength is really rare in the world.\u201dYuan Chengzhi was also terrified, thinking that guy was besieged by the three old monsters a few days ago and suffered such a serious injury. He did not expect him to recover so quickly. The man didn\u2019t seem to be injured at all. If he was in Song Qingshu\u2019s place, he would have required at least two months of rest.It turns out that both the Nine Yin Scripture and Divine Brilliance Scripture were the best healing techniques in the world. The Nine Yin Scripture healed internal injuries, and the Divine Brilliance Scripture continued to repair his bones and the meridians. They really cooperated seamlessly, and resulted in Song Qingshu\u2019s amazing recovery ability.*****On the other side, the Blood Saber Elder carried Wei Xiaobao all the way, and when he felt that he was out of danger, he quickly put him down, panting heavily and decided to rest.\u201cElder, are you awake?\u201d Looking at the other party sitting cross-legged on the ground to meditate, Wei Xiaobao poked him with his finger.\u201cIf you have a fa*rt, let it out.\u201d The Blood Saber Elder did not open his eyes, but concentrated on circulating the Blood Saber Scripture.\u201cShi*t, I wanted to give you a lot of wealth, since you are not interested, then forget it.\u201d Wei Xiaobao turned around, muttering something in his mouth, and it happened to be heard by the Blood Saber Elder.\u201cWhat kind of wealth?\u201d The Blood Saber Elder opened his eyes as expected, and said with a smile, \u201cDo you want to redeem your freedom?\u201d\u201cBah! I\u2019m not a girl from the Spring Beauty Pavilion, so why would I want to redeem myself,\u201d Wei Xiaobao glanced at him contemptuously, \u201cI just want to tell you, if you take me back to Mongolia to that Seventh Prince, you will still remain a slave. If you kill me to please him, you won\u2019t get any benefits, at most he\u2019ll make you some random general or something.\u201d\u201cHuh! Is there anything wrong with being a general?\u201d The Blood Saber Elder gave him a cold look.\u201cHey, what I\u2019m talking about is a rich and honorable position in the court, such as a minister.\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s eyes were full of sly intentions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There are several countries that are stubbornly resisting, but they are almost out of steam. Do you think I will be foolish enough to go to Manchu with you?\u201d\u201cElder, you are a wise man, if I wanted persuade you to seek refuge in the Manchu Dynasty, wouldn\u2019t it be an insult to your IQ,\u201d Wei Xiaobao waved his hand hastily, \u201cWhat I wanted to say is to let you be appointed as a high level minister in Mongolia.\u201d\u201cHey, you really are not afraid to lose your tongue when you speak such big words.\u201d The Blood Saber Elder sneered.\u201cThe Emperor is of course more capable than me, it\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao paused on purpose.The Blood Saber Elder asked curiously, \u201cIt\u2019s just what?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that there are things that the Emperor can\u2019t do\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao pointed at himself, \u201cBut I have no such worries.\u201d\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d The Blood Saber Elder gave him a puzzled look.\u201cFor example\u2026 betraying the interests of the Qing Empire.\u201d Wei Xiaobao smiled inexplicably.The Blood Saber Elder\u2019s heart jumped in chest, he thought that there might be a merit to this, and hurriedly shouted: \u201cBe specific!\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, your Mongol Khan Temujin divided the entire Mongolian power into four parts. Among them, the most elite troops were led by him and the sixth grandson prince Xuliewu to expedition to the western countries, and then he sent the fourth grandson prince Kublai to attack the Kingdom of Jin and Kingdom of Song. His nephew Prince Ruyang was sent to attack the Western Regions, and finally your master, the seventh grandson prince Ali Ge stayed on the Mongolian steppe, plotting to conquer the Qing Dynasty. If I remember correctly, among the other three princes, he is in the most embarrassing position.\u201d Wei Xiaobao said with a smile, secretly rejoicing in his heart that he used to be around Xiao Xuanzi. After listening to him a lot, he actually knew the situation in that part of the world.\u201cOur prince is Ali Bu Ge!\u201d The Blood Saber Elder glared at him angrily.\u201cI said Ali correctly, didn\u2019t I? What\u2019s the problem if I skipped a few words before Ge? It doesn\u2019t matter, I didn\u2019t call him Alibaba.\u201d Seeing the Blood Saber Elder was about to attack, Wei Xiaobao quickly said, \u201cWas my analysis correct?\u201d\u201cHmph, your Qing Dynasty\u2019s national strength is not weak, Kangxi has many capable ministers and generals, together with Prince Sheng Jingbao and Wu Sangui of Shanhai Pass. Although our prince suffered a momentary loss, it is nothing.\u201d The Blood Saber Elder said with confidence. But in his heart he knew that the Seven Princes could be said to have no achievements after so many years.Ali Bu Ge looked at the battle reports from the other three princes every day, and his temper was getting bad to worse. The achievements of Prince Ruyang were not of great concern to him. He was destined to gain nothing and lose everything but his fourth and fifth brothers had achieved such great results. They were nothing short of brilliant, but here he was, stuck in an embarrassing situation. And his road to becoming the next Khan in the future was getting more and more unfavorable.As one of Ali Bu Ge\u2019s subordinates, the Blood Saber Elder was well aware of the troubles of his master.\u201cIf I have a way to make your prince reverse the situation, how do you think your prince will reward you?\u201d Wei Xiaobao asked with slanted eyes.The Blood Saber Elder\u2019s heart moved. If the Seventh Prince could achieve a glorious record against the Manchu, and he became the favorite grandson of the current Khan, the position of the next generation Khan would probably be assured. As long as the prince ascended to the throne, it was really not difficult for him to be a minister.\u201cWhat you are telling me, if this elder feels to be reasonable, maybe I will really let you go. If I see that you little rabbit is playing tricks with this elder, hehe, this elder\u2019s Blood Saber is capable of cutting iron like mud. I will cut you into pieces and hang you on a stick.\u201d The Blood Saber Elder made a few threatening gestures towards Wei Xiaobao with his shining saber.When the cold blade touched his skin it crawled with goose bumps. Wei Xiaobao hurriedly gently pushed his saber away, and said with a flattering smile, \u201cIf I lie to the Elder, wouldn\u2019t it mean that I am tired of living?\u201d\u201cYour prince\u2019s troops are well-provisioned, and the reason why the situation is delayed is that the Emperor has joined hands with Wu Sangui of Shanhai Pass and Sheng Jingbao to form a horn-cutting wall, so that you will be attacked from every direction, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Wei Xiaobao asked for his opinion.\u201cYes.\u201d The Blood Saber Elder admitted that every time the Seventh Prince sent troops, they had to spend a lot of troops to guard the other two fronts, and there was always a feeling of dread while facing the Qing Dynasty\u2019s solid defense line.\u201cThen what if I have a way to let Kangxi destroy that Great Wall?\u201d Wei Xiaobao silently added in his heart,\u00a0\u2018Dear Emperor, this is a critical moment, don\u2019t blame me for offending you.\u2019The Blood Saber Elder\u2019s heart was beating wildly. If the Manchu Kingdom died by itself, wouldn\u2019t it be a great opportunity for the Seven Princes? So he hurriedly asked, \u201cHow will you destroy it?\u201dSeeing his opponent falling in his trap, Wei Xiaobao breathed a sigh of relief and quickly explained, \u201cWu Sangui has long since wanted to be the Emperor, and Prince Bao has always been thinking about the throne in the Forbidden City. Kangxi has long wanted to get rid of the two, but It\u2019s a pity that your Seventh Princes came over to attack at this time, and the three parties had to put aside their personal grievances and unite.\u201d\u201cYou mean that if our Seventh Prince retreats, they will kill each other?\u201d The Blood Saber Elder was overjoyed.\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy.\u201d Wei Xiaobao gave him a look. \u201cBut, as long as you let me return to Kangxi, under my instigation, Kangxi will inevitably act on them. When the civil strife is at its peak, your Seventh Prince will launch an attack. Wouldn\u2019t it be like killing the snake without breaking the stick?\u201d\u201cWhat benefit is in it for you?\u201d The Blood Saber Elder did not fully believe his plan, and looked at Wei Xiaobao suspiciously.\u201cI, Wei Xiaobao, have no big ambitions. I just want to be a high official. I just want to have money to gamble and beauty to play with. It doesn\u2019t matter who is the Emperor.\u201d Wei Xiaobao smiled, \u201cWhat do you think, Elder? Mongolia will rule over all, that is the trend of the times. I\u2019m just trying to find a good way out for myself as soon as possible. When the Elder returns, I hope he will say a few favorable words to the Seventh Prince. This Xiaobao\u2019s future prosperity and wealth will depend on Elder from now on.\u201d\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d The Blood Saber Elder\u00a0 patted Wei Xiaobao\u2019s shoulder, the two looked at each other and laughed loudly.\u201cMay I know what the two find so funny, can you tell this Hong?\u201d A cold voice came from not far away, the two looked back in shock and found that Hong Antong was already about thirty feet away from their position.The\u00a0 Blood Saber Elder secretly screamed in his heart, but he pretended to be ignorant, and laughed loudly with his arms around Wei Xiaobao. He was holding the Blood Saber in his right hand. If his opponent wanted to attack from behind, he was ready to deal a fatal blow.\u201cIt turned out to be Lord Hong, may I know what the situation is in the camp?\u201d The\u00a0 Blood Saber Elder held the hilt of the Saber and looked at him with caution.\u201cYuan Chengzhi was seriously injured, and Shangjie has a hole in his arm. If it hadn\u2019t been for Chen Jinnan, this old man would have already taken Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s life.\u201d Hong Antong snorted coldly.\u201cMaster came to save me\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but warm up.Hearing what Wei Xiaobao said just now, the Blood Saber Elder\u2019s heart had already moved and he intended to take the credit alone, so he greeted Hong Antong and said,\u00a0 \u201cI am going to take this kid to Mongolia now. May I know what Master Hong wants to do?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In desperation, he quickly fabricated a lie to convince the Blood Saber Elder that the hatred between Hong Antong and him was as deep as the sea, and he couldn\u2019t wait to kill him with a thousand cuts.There was nothing bigger than the hatred of killing his master, the hatred of stealing his wife, or murdering his family. Considering the age difference between Hong Antong and Wei Xiaobao, it would be quite difficult to fool the Blood Saber Elder; therefore, he had to use the hatred of stealing his wife.Hong Antong was trembling with anger, \u201cAs*hole, can a rascal like you get three feet close to my wife?\u201d\u201cOld tortoise, maybe you should look in the mirror yourself. You are so old with white hair, and you have married such a coquettish young wife. Are you still able to satisfy her? She couldn\u2019t eat at home, so of course she went outside. And, I\u2019m always willing to give away free food for charity. All of your subordinates may be afraid of you, but I am not!\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s taunt hit Hong Antong\u2019s heart with the greatest pain, and he was so angry that his hair stood up, and his fists creaked.Wei Xiaobao knew that if he was not able to completely convince the Blood Saber Elder that the two of them would not share the same sky. He was afraid that all his previous efforts would be wasted. He looked at Hong Antong\u2019s furious appearance, gritted his teeth and continued to add fuel to the fire, \u201cI am not only very familiar with the exterior of Madame Hong\u2019s body, but also all the available interior assets.\u201d While talking, he moved his waist in a perverted manner, and licked his lips, \u201cTsk tsk tsk\u2026Madame Hong\u2019s body is really white and smooth, and her cave is so slippery. Ah~\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to you, little beast!\u201d Hong Antong couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and blasted over with a punch.Remembering Madame Hong\u2019s coquettish appearance, Wei Xiaobao became more and more vigorous when he cursed, and he became excited. How could he know that Hong Antong would close the distance of several meters in a blink? As he looked at the big fist in front of him, Wei Xiaobao was so frightened that he couldn\u2019t move a muscle.The Blood Saber Elder still needed to rely on Wei Xiaobao in order to realize his dream of becoming a minister, so how could he watch him die? He blocked the fist with his Blood Saber, and Hong Antong had to retreat a few feet away when he saw the light of the saber flash and sparks flew.\u201cThe Blood Saber Elder, this little beast insulted me too much, do you really want to help him?\u201d Hong Antong viciously waited for the Blood Saber Elder\u2019s reply.\u201cWhy is Lord Hong so angry? The clouds in the sky fear no dirty water.\u201d The Blood Saber Elder thought in his heart,\u00a0\u2018I have long heard about Madame Hong\u2019s famous name. This Hong Antong is so old. Can he really satisfy Madame Hong? Maybe she just couldn\u2019t bear the loneliness. Hey, this kid Wei Xiaobao is a bit rich in the belly, not unlike this elder. Maybe I will also go to Mystic Dragon Island for a visit someday to offer Madame Hong some food.\u2019Noting the Blood Saber Elder\u2019s wretched look, and thinking of his reputation for insulting women, Hong Antong was furious, \u201cSince your Excellency wants to give shelter to this little beast, don\u2019t blame this old man for being rude.\u201d\u201cHey, Lord Hong, don\u2019t forget, this kid was wanted by the Seventh Prince. If you killed him and the Seventh Prince knew. Do you realize what the consequences would be?\u201d The Blood Saber Elder sneered.\u201cHuh, if this old man killed you both together, wouldn\u2019t no one know?\u201d Hong Antong was very angry at this moment and he already had the heart to kill.\u201cGood! My Blood Saber was pretty hungry.\u201d The Blood Saber Elder smiled dryly, and lightly scratched his bald head with the Blood Saber. It was the Blood Saber Sciptures\u2019s starting style, both offensive and defensive.Hong Antong stopped speaking, and stretched out his palms to attack him left and right like two soft snakes.\u201cCotton Bone Palm!\u201d The Blood Saber Elder was secretly vigilant, and waved his saber to meet the attack.After dozens of exchanges, the two separated again. The Blood Saber Elder moved his numb wrist, he knew that his opponent\u2019s internal strength and martial arts attainments were higher than him, but he was not afraid at all.\u00a0\u2018If life and death battles were so simple, then everyone would directly win based on the level of their internal strength. I will fight and I will win.\u2019\u00a0 Thinking of this, the Blood Saber Elder\u2019s fighting spirit grew stronger and stronger.Hong Antong was also very surprised. The last time they fought was in the Golden Serpent Camp in Shandong, he thought that his opponents martial arts would be slightly worse than him. At that time, he thought that if Shangjie had not stopped him, Blood Saber Elder would definitely not be his opponent if he continued to fight. With so many moves with varied sword strikes, his opponent was really not easy to beat!Hong Antong was, in the end, a leader of a cult. His angry emotions gradually calmed down. Moreover, in the original book, he was a talented person who could not only teach Wei Xiaobao but also could modify the \u201cThree Heroic Strikes\u201d for him according to his aptitude. His realm of martial arts had long surpassed ordinary masters.When he got used to the Blood Saber Elder\u2019s chaotic fighting style, he slowly began to gain the upper hand. After dozens of moves, he was already confident that he could take his opponent\u2019s life, but he was worried that he would have to pay a high price, so he kept dragging on.\u201cShi*t, I didn\u2019t expect this old ghost to be so powerful, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be killed if I continue to fight.\u201d The Blood Saber Elder knew when to quit, so he began to think about countermeasures.\u201cHuh! If I can\u2019t get this kid, don\u2019t even think about catching him.\u201d The Blood Saber Elder sneered coldly, and jumped out of the fight to stab Wei Xiaobao.Hong Antong couldn\u2019t wait to skin Wei Xiaobao alive, and wanted to take him back to Mystic Dragon Island to let the Colorful Dragon slowly torture him to death. How else could he relieve his hatred? How could he let him die so easily?He hurriedly attacked the chest of the Blood Saber Elder, aiming to save Wei Xiaobao. But his decades of combat experience made him realize that there could be a faint, so he secretly reserved a bit of strength to guard against the Blood Saber Elder\u2019s sudden counterattack.He didn\u2019t know that, what the Blood Saber Elder was waiting for was exactly this. He calculated that Hong Antong would not let him hack Wei Xiaobao to death. He also knew that the other party would definitely defend himself. Therefore, after seeing him reserve strength, his blade turned and hit the ground. He accelerated with the help of the force from the counter-shock and fled to the distance.Hong Antong didn\u2019t know that the other party was trying to escape with all his strength. He could only helplessly watch as the Blood Saber Elder disappeared into the wilderness. Hong Antong frowned, thinking that by letting that guy run away he would surely offend the Seventh Prince of Mongolia. Things might get a bit tricky in the future.But then he thought of another nasty person, Hong Antong turned around and looked at Wei Xiaobao without a smile, \u201cLittle rabbit, aren\u2019t very good at talking, now let\u2019s talk about how I will deal with you!\u201d\u201cMaster Hong is a personage of utmost martial virtue, divine blessings, longevity and heavenly might. You are a person of such high stature, just treat me as a random fa*rt and let me go.\u201d Wei Xiaobao did not expect the Blood Saber Elder to be so useless. As Hong Antong came closer, he trembled with fear, and couldn\u2019t help backing away.\u201cShaaa!\u201d A sharp sound of something ripping through the air was heard. Hong Antong didn\u2019t dare to delay, and hurriedly dodged on the side, hiding from the attack. But, before he could even catch his breath, his expression suddenly changed, he kicked the ground with his feet, and jumped.Recovering the wooden sword that was shot out, Song Qingshu said with a long laugh, \u201cMaster Hong has a good memory, he remembered that this wooden sword will return to its master.\u201d\u201cOh, my dear big brother!\u201d When Wei Xiaobao saw Song Qingshu appear, he felt like crying, and hurriedly ran behind him. He thought that his little life was finally saved.\u201cWeren\u2019t you tied up in the camp?\u201d Hong Antong\u2019s expression was uncertain. Just now he fought against theBlood Saber Elder and consumed a lot of true qi. The martial arts techniques of the guy opposite were unpredictable and he was really difficult to deal with.\u201cYou betrayed and injured Yuan Chengzhi pretty badly. So he let me chase you down in anger.\u201d Song Qingshu casually said some nonsense, and thought that Yuan Chengzhi could use more enemies. It was a shame that he couldn\u2019t kill him just now.\u201cYour Excellency was hit by Shangjie and this old man\u2019s attack in the fight before. I am afraid that your recovery will be limited, in just one or two days.\u201d Hong Antong was confident in his fists. Even if it was Wudang Sect\u2019s Zhang Sanfeng, who was considered to be a half man and half immortal, would not fare well after being hit by his full strength. He would be half dead, if not dead. As for the other party\u2019s light and breezy look, he was sure that Song Qingshu was probably pretending to be strong.\u201cMaster Hong is welcome to come and try.\u201d Song Qingshu didn\u2019t care, and reached out his hand to make a gesture of invitation.Hong Antong narrowed his eyes and stabbed his toes. A stone shot at Wei Xiaobao like a sharp arrow. His figure flashed without hesitation, and he attacked Song Qingshu with his palm.Song Qingshu was startled, and secretly admired his opponent who had gone through all kinds of battles and could fight so well. He stretched out his wooden sword and performed the Taiji Swordplay. He swung his sword in a big circle and easily changed the trajectory of the pebbles, reflecting them back towards Hong Antong who was flying at extreme speed.Hong Antong didn\u2019t know that his opponent still had this hidden card in hand. The arrow had been shot and there was no time to escape now.With a puff, he was hit by the small pebble on his left chest, and Hong Antong quickly flew back, raised his hand and threw a poisonous snake, taking the opportunity to flee towards the distance.Song Qingshu pushed both palms forward and used \u201cA Sudden Advent\u201d from the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms, and destroyed the poisonous snake in the air.\u201cBig Brother Song, that old turtle has escaped, why don\u2019t you chase him?\u201d Wei Xiaobao anxiously looked into the distance. He scolded Hong Antong so harshly today. The situation was serious enough that if Hong Antong didn\u2019t die soon he really would have trouble sleeping and eating.\u201cHong Antong\u2019s martial arts is so powerful, it\u2019s not so easy to take his life.\u201d Song Qingshu shook his head, but thought in his heart,\u00a0\u2018I am not wholeheartedly seeking refuge in the Qing court. If Hong Antong died, the Mystic Dragon Sect would definitely fall apart. Wouldn\u2019t that be doing a free job for Kangxi?\u2019\u00a0Song Qingshu never did this kind of hard work that would profit others.Leaving aside Hong Antong\u2019s affairs, Song Qingshu began to recall theTaiji Swordplay he had just performed. Song Qingshu was the chief disciple of the Wudang Sect. He had seen his uncles practicing Taiji Swordplay before. Just now, there was a flash of insight in his mind, and he accidentally performed a little bit of the Taiji Swordplay. It\u2019s a pity that Song Qingshu remembered too little, so now he could only get a glimpse of the Taiji Swordplay.\u201cBig Brother Song, this time I was able to escape with my life thanks to you.\u00a0 After returning to the capital, I will invite you to drink wine for three days and three nights, and invite all the most popular girls in the city to accompany you\u2026\u201d If you say that before Wei Xiaobao was slanderous towards Song Qingshu, now he was grateful to Song Qingshu from the bottom of his heart.\u201cI hope that the famous courtesans in the capital are as pretty as Miss Youyou.\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d*****The two talked happily and rushed all the way north.\u201cGreat Monk?\u201d After the two contacted Duo Long\u2019s army, they saw the bald headed monk, and they couldn\u2019t help but exclaim.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Anyway, the two were not his friends of life and death. He probably would have made the same choice if he was in Jiumozhi\u2019s position, but he didn\u2019t know if Wei Xiaobao would have a bump in his heart.Looking up, he saw that Wei Xiaobao was not only not angry, but he smiled, \u201cThe situation was critical that day. Fortunately, the Great Monk notified the soldiers outside the city in time to make the group of assassins hesitate. I was worried that you would be harmed by that group of gangsters. Today, when I met Brother Song first, and met you, the Great Monk; I was so happy. Let us go to the best restaurant in the city, and we won\u2019t rest tonight unless we are drunk .\u201d He said as he hooked Song Qingshu with his left hand, and Jiumozhi with his right hand, then started walking.Although Jiumozhi knew that what he said just now was just a kind of clever excuse, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel warm, but when he thought of the content of Wei Xiaobao\u2019s words, his face became stiff, and he muttered, \u201cThis poor monk can\u2019t drink alcohol\u2026\u201d\u201cMeat and wine only pass through the intestines, but Buddha sits in our hearts. You don\u2019t have to hold back so much, Great Monk.\u201d Wei Xiaobao said with a laugh.\u201cIf the Buddha in heaven heard these words, I\u2019m afraid he would slap this guy on the ear for sure.\u201d Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but smile, and followed a group of people to the city.*****Wei Xiaobao\u2019s mission to the southward alliance was full of twists and turns, and the time was delayed enough. Worried that Kangxi would be waiting, the group of people traveled day and night in a hurry, and soon returned to the city of Yanjing.\u201cXiao Guizi, you old shi*t, why did you take so long to come back to report to us? Were you obsessed with the beauties of Jiangnan and felt reluctant to come back?\u201d When Kangxi saw Wei Xiaobao, he was pleasantly surprised, and quickly ran off the dragon throne.\u00a0(Goblin: Emperor\u2019s usually refer to themselves as we, us, our.)\u201cHey, Xiao Xuanzi, it\u2019s a long story. This time, this Xiao Guizi\u2019s life was almost over.\u201d Wei Xiaobao raised his hand to wipe his sweat.\u00a0(Goblin: Guizi roughly translates to \u201cbird\u2019s egg\u201d. It\u2019s the same for \u201cXiao Xuanzi\u201d. It shows the close friendship between the two. It sounds strange if I translate it, so I decided to keep it as it is.)\u201cOh?\u201d Kangxi was really interested, \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201dWei Xiaobao then added more effort to describe how he was nearly assassinated, and then he was rescued by Song Qingshu, and then went to Gusu to recruit the expert martial arts master Jiumozhi, on the way to the north, he fell into a trap in Yangzhou, and was captured by the Golden Serpent King and others\u2026Wei Xiaobao liked to hear book readings since he was a child, and he was very accurate about which plots should be emphasized and which should be omitted while narrating.Sure enough, Kangxi\u2019s emotions were completely riled up by him. He was usually trapped deep in the inner palace. How could he have the opportunity to come into contact with so many exciting things? He was full of joy.\u201cThen how did you escape later?\u201d Although now Wei Xiaobao was safe and sound, Kangxi couldn\u2019t help but worry about how he could get out after he was caught in the Tiger\u2019s Lair.Wei Xiaobao chuckled, then he told the story about the Blood Saber Elder and Yuan Chengzhi.\u201cWell, you little fox!\u201d Kangxi stroked his palm and gave him a look of surprise. \u201cWe originally thought that you were inexperienced, and didn\u2019t expect that you would do better than some people who are full of experience in critical moments.\u201d\u201cOf course Xiao Guizi didn\u2019t learn or know anything before.\u201d Wei Xiaobao lightly tapped Kangxi on his shoulder. \u201cBut I am always with Xiao Xuanzi and have learned a few skills.\u201d\u201cWhat \u2018Skills\u2019? I just praised you!\u201d Kangxi gave him an angry look, \u201cBy the way, after the Blood Saber Elder took you away, how did you escape?\u201dWei Xiaobao originally wanted to lie to him that Song Qingshu had saved him, but then he thought about the fact that he had leaked one of the core secrets of the Qing Empire in order to survive. If Kangxi was not prepared, wouldn\u2019t he harm him?After hesitating for a long time, Wei Xiaobao still said, \u201cXuanzi, I dare not say\u2026\u201d\u201cIs there anything you dare not say?\u201d Kangxi rolled his eyes and looked at him with amusement. \u201cDid you say bad things about us in front of the Blood Saber Elder? It doesn\u2019t matter, we forgive you, so do not feel guilty.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 it\u2019s a bit more serious than that.\u201d Wei Xiaobao timidly glanced at him.\u201cHave you said bad things about our father or the queen?\u201d Kangxi\u2019s face couldn\u2019t help but sink.\u201cThat\u2019s definitely not!\u201d Wei Xiaobao shook his head like the tail of a rattlesnake. He couldn\u2019t lie even if he wanted to, so he told Kangxi that he had to tell the Blood Saber Elder about the fragile relationship between Kangxi, Prince Bao, and Wu Sangui.Kangxi frowned after hearing about the matter, and stood there for a long time without saying a word.Wei Xiaobao quietly waited on the sidelines, he felt scared, and quickly continued explaining so that he could gain some sympathy, \u201cXiao Xuanzi, I was about to be brought back to Mongolia by the Blood Saber Elder at that time. I thought that the Mongolian prince would use me to threaten you, and cause you to fall into a dilemma. If you decided to save me it would harm the interests of the Qing Dynasty. On the other hand, if you let me die, it would be disregarding brotherhood and make you seem cruel and unrighteous; how can this Xiao Guizi bear to let you be an unrighteous person?\u201d\u201cBastard!\u201d Looking at Wei Xiaobao\u2019s deliberate pitiful appearance, Kangxi didn\u2019t know what he was going to do. This guy was really good at talking nonsense, so he couldn\u2019t help but laugh and curse, \u201cForget it, it\u2019s not a big deal, we\u2019ll just take advantage of this opportunity to apply our plan.\u201dWei Xiaobao\u2019s eyes lit up and he immediately looked at Kangxi with admiration, \u201cXuanzi, you came up with a countermeasure in the blink of an eye! You really are more intelligent than Zhuge Liang.\u201d\u201cEnough flattering.\u201d Kangxi\u2019s eyes were deep and thoughtful, \u201cOur peace with the Wu Sangui and Prince Bao are just a stopgap measure. Although the alliance has the upper hand over Mongolia for now, no one knows what will happen in the long run. We have always wanted to resolve this matter. It\u2019s just that our foreign enemies, the Mongols, are overwhelming. We couldn\u2019t make up our minds all this time. Since you made a mistake and leaked the news, and if Mongolia really retreats, it will be the right time to settle it.\u201d\u201cBut Mongolia made it clear that they will watch the dog\u2019s fight\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao swallowed his next words when he was glared at by Kangxi, and he quickly changed his tone, \u201cOur infighting, isn\u2019t that just what they want?\u201d\u201cThe snipe and clam compete, and the fisherman profits. Everyone in the world wants to be that fisherman, but very few people understand that to be a fisherman is not that easy a thing to do.\u201d Kangxi smiled confidently and had a plan in his heart.\u201cBy the way, where are the two masters you mentioned?\u201d Kangxi woke up in shock and asked back.\u201cXiao Xuanzi will be very happy. This time, the two I brought back are really top masters. One is the Tubo national teacher Jiumozhi, who is known as the number one martial artist in Tibetan Tantric Buddhism. He can cleave invisible sword energy with his hands. The other is a young sword master. His wooden sword reaps the life of his enemies and can control it within ten feet with his palm.\u201d Wei Xiaobao was extremely proud when speaking of the two masters he recruited. Duo Long was considered one of the best masters in the palace, but compared with them, the difference was between heaven and earth.\u00a0\u2018I think this time I will definitely get a reward from the Emperor.\u2019\u201cHand as a sword? Wooden sword?\u201d Kangxi really became interested.\u201cAbout that Jiumozhi, I don\u2019t have much to say, but Song Qingshu, who uses the wooden sword, is not only strong in martial arts, but also very loyal. He is willing to use his strength for his brothers.\u201d Wei Xiaobao remembered Song Qingshu\u2019s efforts to save him from danger several times, and took this opportunity to advertise his previous deeds.\u201cHurry up and tell them to come in!\u201d Kangxi quickly turned around and sat down on the dragon throne. He wanted to maintain the Emperor\u2019s majesty in front of outsiders.\u201cAs you wish!\u201d Wei Xiaobao hurriedly ran out.When Song Qingshu entered the imperial study room and looked at Kangxi on the dragon throne, he went in a daze, \u201cThis young man wearing a dragon robe turned out to be that Emperor\u2026The Imperial Study Room, I didn\u2019t visit this place when I visited the Forbidden City back then. It was a mistake, but I am now fulfilling my regrets from that life.\u201dKangxi looked at the two masters who were praised so much by Wei Xiaobao, and a deep smile appeared at the corners of his mouth, \u201cSpeaking of masters, we also recruited a expert martial arts master some time ago, but we don\u2019t know if he is higher or lower level than these two.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As for Zhang Kangnian and Zhao Qixian, their martial arts were a little bit stronger than ordinary soldiers, but that wasn\u2019t enough to call them real masters.One could imagine how scarce the Qing court\u2019s masters were. Song Qingshu had always been curious. Under the protection of such a group of unreliable imperial guards, how could Kangxi live so peacefully for so long?\u201cMay I know who the Emperor recruited from the wulin?\u201d Song Qingshu asked with a slight smile.\u201cHear me! Go and summon leader Dongfang here?\u201d Kangxi ordered, and the little eunuch Wen Youdao ran off quickly.\u201cEh, leader Dongfang?\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s smile came to an abrupt stop, and he was surprised,\u00a0\u2018Could it be the \u201cInvincible East\u201d?\u2019\u00a0\u00a0(Goblin: \u201cInvincible East\u201d is the meaning/title of Dongfang Bubai.)Not long after, as the door of the Imperial Study Room opened, and a man in red slowly walked in.He had a light and breezy aura about him, and didn\u2019t even look at the other people in the room. He just bowed slightly to Kangxi, \u201cThis Dongfang has seen the Emperor.\u201dFrom the moment he came in, Song Qingshu had been staring at him. Dongfang Bubai had red lips and white teeth, and his face was as delicate as a woman. It was hard to tell how old he was. On the surface, he looked like a beautiful young man, but his calm and steady attitude reminded other\u2019s to not be fooled by his young appearance.When he opened his mouth, all the illusions in Song Qingshu\u2019s heart broke to pieces. Before, he had always wanted to know whether the Invincible East of this world would be a glamorous woman from the movie version or the trans woman from the TV drama version.When Dongfang Bubai first came in, Song Qingshu felt that he was more likely to be a woman, and he felt delighted, but when the other party opened his mouth, that low male voice made his mind blow up all of a sudden.Dongfang Bubai glanced back at him with a thoughtful expression. When his eyes made contact with the opponent\u2019s eyes, Song Qingshu\u2019s heart was stunned, as if he had been seen through.\u201cLeader Dongfang, these two are the top masters I recruited, one is Tubo\u2019s Great Monk Jiumozhi, the other is master Song Qingshu.\u201d Kangxi stood up and introduced both parties to each other, \u201cThis is the leader of the Sun Moon Holy Cult, Dongfang Bubai.\u201dDongfang Bubai didn\u2019t bother to take a look at the two of them. He only sneered and said, \u201cSince when did the top masters become like cabegges?\u201dKangxi didn\u2019t look like he was offended, but he watched with interest how Song Qingshu and Jiumozhi would respond to this.\u201cXiao Guizi, let\u2019s make a gamble and see if the masters you found are stronger or the master I found is stronger.\u201d Although Kangxi had begun to take on the majesty of a monarch, he was, in the end, still a young man. So, he instinctively wanted to compare his choice with Wei Xiaobao.\u201cOf course the master chosen by Xiao Xuanzi is stronger.\u201d Although Wei Xiaobao flattered like this, he didn\u2019t agree with him in his heart. He had seen the martial arts of Jiumozhi and Song Qingshu when they defeated Hong Antong and his associates. But, he just didn\u2019t want to piss off Xiao Xuanzi. Wei Xiaobao couldn\u2019t even figure out if this guy was a man or a woman at first glance, and he also didn\u2019t seem that powerful either.\u201cYour little shi*t, I know you definitely don\u2019t think so in your heart.\u201d Kangxi instantly understood his thoughts when he noticed Wei Xiaobao\u2019s expression, and couldn\u2019t help but snort, \u201cIf I lose, I will make you an earl and it will be hereditary. And, if you lose, donate some money to the disaster relief fund.\u201d\u201cA gentleman is a man of his words!\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s eyes lit up and he immediately agreed.\u201cA man of his words!\u201d Kangxi nodded heavily.*****Although the two of them deliberately lowered their voices and whispered to each other\u2019s ears, the three in the court were top masters, and the conversation between the two passed into the ears of the three masters without fail.Dongfang Bubai\u2019s eyes flashed brightly, and then he slowly closed his eyes and began to prepare himself. Song Qingshu and Jiuozhi looked at each other, and they both understood Kangxi\u2019s intentions.Although they were well-known in the wulin, but Kangxi had not personally seen them in action. There was bound to be a bit of suspicion. So he wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to let Dongfang Bubai test their skills. Furthermore, this will also allow them to verify their doubts about Dongfang Bubai.Song Qingshu was okay with this situation. He was influenced by various TV dramas and movies, and he had a deep impression of Dongfang Bubai\u2019s martial arts attainments. Hearing his words of ridicule, Song Qingshu did not get angry. Instead, he smiled and replied, \u201cCult leader Dongfang has reached the transformation of heaven and man. The martial arts level of this Song is naturally far less than him. However, this Song thinks that it is more than enough to deal with the majority of the people in the wulin.\u201d\u201cYour Excellency is so young, but he knows about the concept of\u00a0 \u2018transformation of heaven and man\u2019. It\u2019s good, good\u2026 very good!\u201d Dongfang Bubai gave him a surprised look, and spoke with astonishment.Jiumozhi on the side, however, didn\u2019t have such tolerance. He himself was a proud man. Apart from Padmasambhava, who was in seclusion for a few decades in the Nyingma Temple, no one was his opponent in the entire Tubo. This time he came to the central plains and defeated the famous Shaolin monk Xuan Bei, master Duan of Dali, Gu Sunan and many more. He felt that the central plain wulin was nothing more than this.But now, when he heard Dongfang Bubai\u2019s ridicule, he couldn\u2019t help but get angry, and sneered, \u201cWho knows, maybe cult leader Dongfang will have to change the word Bubai (invincible/undefeated) from his name after today.\u201dDongfang Bubai glanced at him indifferently, \u201cI will naturally change it, but can you make me?\u201d\u201cWhat a big tone!\u201d Jiumozhi felt that the other party was extremely arrogant. Although he had heard about the reputation of Dongfang Bubai on the Black Wood Cliff, according to that, he was qualified to claim the reputation of \u2018Invincible East\u2019. But, Jiumozhi was very confident in his martial arts as well. During this period of time, he had seen too many people with sky high reputations that proved to be nothing more than mere illusions, and he thought that the reputation of the \u2018Invincible East\u2019 was the same.\u201cYou can try.\u201d Dongfang Bubai said casually with his hands behind his back, his head lowered and eyes closed .\u201cThen I\u2019ll be offending you!\u201d If things were not so troublesome, Jiumozhi would have visited the most famous masters of the central plains wulin one by one. This time, facing one of them, he suddenly became very cautious.Jiumozhi was not anxious to initiate a face-to-face attack, instead, he performed a Flame Blade with swift motion.\u201cHuh? It\u2019s a bit tricky.\u201d Feeling the invisible sword aura of his opponent, Dongfang Bubai finally opened his eyes, his figure flashed and disappeared from the place like a phantom.Jiumozhi hadn\u2019t fully recovered from performing the Flame Blade yet, suddenly his heart jumped, and he waved his hand to his side.\u201cHow surprising, your Excellency actually knows the Seventy Two Forms of Shaolin?\u201d Dongfang Bubai appeared a few meters away and glanced at Jiumozhi in amazement.\u201cPoor monk is not talented, although it is far from being proficient, but in the Seventy Two Forms of Shaolin, this poor monk happens to know a little bit of everything.\u201d Although his previous two moves had failed to land a hit, but Jiumozhi immediately picked up his spirit, fully guarding against any attacks.\u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense!\u201d Dongfang Bubai coldly snorted, naturally not believing that someone could practice Shaolin Temple\u2019s 72 Forms at the same time.\u201cThen cult leader Dongfang should try this monk\u2019s modified Animitta Kalpa Finger.\u201d Jiumozhi stretched out his right index finger, quickly drew a circle in the air, and blasted a fierce finger wind.Dongfang Bubai smiled coldly, and quickly disappeared from the spot. Jiumozhi\u2019s Animitta Kalpa Finger directly hit the pillar behind him, leaving a deep scorched hole.Kangxi was stunned, \u201cXiao Guizi, this Maha Cakra Vajra\u2019s martial arts is really good!\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao casually dealt with the praise, and was attracted by the fierce fighting in the center court.Dongfang Bubai was like a ghost, illusory, coming and going, just like green smoke. Jiumozhi couldn\u2019t even hit him with his Animitta Kalpa Finger, but instead he had to dodge while shaking his monk\u2019s robe. It seemed as if there was a big red shadow net in the room.\u201cKasaya Evil Subduing Skill?\u201d Dongfang Bubai felt a great strength coming from the monk\u2019s robe and rushing towards him. A cold light flashed in his eyes, a thin needle slid out between his fingers, and with a flick of his finger, it pierced towards his opponent.\u00a0(Goblin: Kasaya means monk\u2019s robe.)Although Jiumozhi did not clearly see what was being shot, an alarm bell rang in his heart, and he bent over like an iron bridge. He managed to dodge it, but the needle still left a trail of blood between his eyebrows.The needle pierced through the aura of the monk\u2019s robe, so Jiumozhi had to avoid it, and it lost the power to go on and softly fell on the ground.\u201cGreat monk, don\u2019t hesitate to use what you have in store.\u201d Dongfang Bubai taunted, as he looked at Jiumozhi with a smile.Experiencing the ghostly speed of Dongfang Bubai, Jiumozhi\u2019s eyes were full of caution, and instead of attacking, he decided to wait.\u201cHehe, since you are not going to attack, then this seat will not be polite.\u201d As soon as his voice fell, Dongfang Bubai transformed into a red shadow, quickly surrounding Jiumozhi.\u201cXiao Guizi, can you see how they are doing?\u201d Kangxi looked annoyed, and except for a red shadow that fluttered from left to right, his eyes could catch nothing else.\u201cI can\u2019t see clearly either, I can only hear the whistling sound of wind.\u201d Wei Xiaobao opened his mouth and looked at everything in front of him in awe.\u201cFlower Pinching Finger, Pattra Finger, Dragon Capturing Hand, Shadowless Formless Legs, Heaven and Earth in the Sleeve, Nirvana Grab, Maha Finger, Great Vajra Fist, Prajna Palm\u2026Great monk, did you really practice the Seventy Two Forms of Shaolin?\u201d It was definite from Dongfang Bubai\u2019s voice that he was obviously quite surprised, \u201cHeh\u2026or it could be just a pretence.\u201dHowever, Jiumozhi didn\u2019t say a word, and his face remained calm, as he kept dealing with the red shadows around him. His opponent often tried to attack once in a while, and Jiumozhi\u2019s own offensive mostly hit empty space.In his decades long time as a martial artist, Jiumozhi had never fought such a gruelling battle. His opponent\u2019s martial arts were clearly not much higher than him, but because of his quick speed, he failed to gain any advantage.Now that his opponent figured out his flaws, Jiumozhi no longer used the Seventy Two Forms of Shaolin, and used his own trademark technique-the Flame Blade.\u201cThis invisible sword aura is indeed interesting. It grows and changes suddenly.\u201d During the fight, Dongfang Bubai spoke up in admiration and he had been almost injured by the opponent\u2019s sword aura several times.\u201cGreat Monk, I think you should give up. Cult leader Dongfang is like lightning and thunder, and there is no warning for his next attack. Even if you manage to fend for a long time, you will still lose in the end.\u201d Song Qingshu seemed to realize Jiumozhi\u2019s predicament. He was getting tired, so he had to quickly give him a way out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although in the eyes of Kangxi and others, he and Dongfang Bubai were still fighting on equal grounds, but for the three top experts in the scene, they knew that his defeat was all but certain.Rather than to drag on to decide the outcome, and lose in an awkward manner, it was preferable to generously surrender and save face in front of Kangxi.\u201cThe martial arts of cult leader Dongfang is superb, and this poor monk is inferior.\u201d Jiumozhi\u2019s tone was full of unwillingness. In his opinion, if the two stood still and slapped each other, Dongfang Bubai would definitely be injured heavier than him. It\u2019s a pity that his opponent\u2019s speed was too fast, and his moves simply couldn\u2019t hit him.\u201cGreat monk, your martial arts is also pretty good.\u201d Seeing that the other party admitted defeat, there was no need to continue the fight anymore. A red shadow flashed and he stood a few meters away. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are no more than ten people in the wulin that are your equal.\u201d\u201cI hope that cult leader Dongfang will give instructions. Which ten people can clearly beat this poor monk?\u201d Jiumozhi asked. It was enough to lose to Dongfang Bubai. But, when he heard that there were as many as ten people who clearly surpassed him, he immediately faced him, showing clear disbelief.Dongfang Bubai smiled faintly, \u201cZhang Sanfeng of Wudang Sect has reached the Demi-god realm, and his Taiji Skill is best at performing both slow and fast. Even if it\u2019s me, I may not be his opponent, and you naturally can\u2019t beat him.\u201d\u201cThis poor monk has also admired master Zhang for a long time.\u201d Jiumozhi nodded, wondering in his heart that who in all of wulin did not know that the strongest martial arts master was Zhang Sanfeng?\u201cShaolin and Wudang Sect have always been the two giants in the wulin. Although this seat does look down on those stinky monks in red robes, but I admire their martial arts very much.\u201d Dongfang Bubai fell into contemplation,\u201dI wanted to get my hands on the Seventy Two Forms of Shaolin in the past, so I sneaked into the Shaolin Temple\u2019s Buddhist Scripture Pavilion. Along the way, I noticed at least three auras that are not weaker than me. I only know that one of them should be the number one martial artist in the Shaolin Temple in the past two hundred years. One of the thirteen holy monk\u2019s, Xuanci.\u201d After speaking, he couldn\u2019t help but glance at Jiumozhi.Jiumozhi\u2019s expression was a little embarrassed. Although he claimed to be proficient in Seventy Two Forms of Shaolin, he actually only had some minor accomplishments. The divine monk Xuanci had actually mastered all the Seventy Two Forms of Shaolin.\u201cWho are the other two?\u201d Song Qingshu was very interested.At the beginning, Dongfang Bubai was a little surprised by the martial arts vision of this young man. When he asked him a question, Dongfang Bubai smiled faintly, and then said, \u201cI don\u2019t know too much. Even though I knew that there were three people in the Shaolin Temple who were not weaker than me, I didn\u2019t meet them. And I didn\u2019t care to know. As long as I want to escape, there is no one in the world who can get in my way.\u201d When Dongfang Bubai said this, there was a kind of self-confidence that looked down upon the heroes of the world.\u201cHowever.\u201d Dongfang Bubai suddenly became a little puzzled. \u201cLater when I was reading the Shaolin Temple scriptures in the Buddhist Scriptures Pavilion, I always felt as if someone was observing me from the dark. After thinking it through, I decided to leave. That feeling was too sinister.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the cult leader Dongfang came across the Unknown Monk in the Buddhist Scripture Pavilion.\u201d Song Qingshu immediately understood, so he described his appearance in detail.\u201cThe monk who sweeps the floor in the room?\u201d Dongfang Bubai was shocked. No wonder he had searched around and failed to find the source of the gaze. It turned out to be the old monk who was ignored by him at the beginning! Realizing that the other party could conceal his presence from his eyes and ears, Dongfang Bubai\u2019s expression suddenly looked a little ugly.\u201cI also hope that the cult leader Dongfang will inform us about the rest of the masters in the Central Plains.\u201d Jiumozhi had no experience of meeting the Unknown Holy Monk, and was not interested in him at the moment.Dongfang Bubai came back to his senses and continued, \u201cWang Chongyang of the Quanzhen Sect was also known as the number one in the world. Although this reputation of \u2018number one in the world\u2019 is probably false, it should not be a big problem if he wanted to defeat this monk.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily.\u201d Jiumozhi snorted.Dongfang Bubai didn\u2019t care, and continued, \u201cI have always admired the swordsmanship of Feng Qingyang of the Mount Hua Sect. According to legend, he has reached the realm of no sword to defeat a sword. This seat really wants to see it.\u201d He spoke with fascination.\u201cThis little friend of this poor monk has also learned Feng Qingyang\u2019s sword art, why not ask him?\u201d Jiumozhi said with a smile.\u201cOh? I felt weird just now when I saw the wooden sword on your back. Could it be that you are a descendant of Master Feng?\u201d As soon as Dongfang Bubai\u2019s voice fell, he suddenly appeared before Song Qingshu.Song Qingshu was shocked. Fortunately, he had known the ghostly speed of Dongfang Bubai, and his unpredictable ways, so he had been secretly keeping his guard up.Seeing him suddenly launching a frontal attack, Song Qingshu hurriedly used the \u2018The Fish Frolics in the Depths\u2019 from the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms, and quickly dodged. His wooden sword came out of its sheath, and a surge of sword qi shot out.\u201cInteresting and very interesting\u2026 today I not only saw the flame sword aura, but also saw the invisible sword qi.\u201d Dongfang Bubai spoke up, and continued to attack.In the midst of this situation, Song Qingshu realized the helplessness Jiumozhi would have felt just now, and also understood the gap between himself and Jiumozhi.His opponent\u2019s speed was too fast, Song Qingshu had no idea from which position he would attack from. Jiumozhi could use his rich combat experience to speculate where Dongfang Bubai\u2019s next attack would come from, and take precautions in advance.Song Qingshu didn\u2019t have that capability yet. Most of the time, he was able to avoid the opponent\u2019s attack by a hair\u2019s length. Fortunately, he learned quite a lot during his travels, in addition to the Nine Yin Scripture, the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms, and the sword art from the Cogitation Cliff; he knew some of the top most techniques in the world, and could barely cope with the attacks.However, to outsiders, Song Qingshu was in dire straits and could only fend in an awkward manner, he didn\u2019t have the same calm and steady feeling when Jiumozhi faced his opponent just now.Dongfang Bubai was finally done with his test, \u201cBoy, although your style of tumbling on the ground looks a bit ugly, but its effect is quite good.\u201d He stopped attacking and retreated to the place he stood before.Song Qingshu smiled, got up from the ground. He had used the Slithering Snake Jumping Raccoon Technique in front of a group of people. Even though he was a man with two lifetimes, his face couldn\u2019t help but heat up.\u201cAlthough your martial arts is good, it shouldn\u2019t be enough to let you escape from Feng Qingyang.\u201d Dongfang Bubai gave him a suspisious look. Just now, when he was testing him, what the other party performed was not the Nine Swords of Dugu. If he was a follower of Feng Qingyang, then this youth was naturally an enemy and not a friend.\u201cA gentleman can be deceived.\u201d Song Qingshu did not reveal that he had escaped by performing his peerless movement technique. Just now, when he had been fighting with Dongfang Bubai, he had been enduring the urge to use the Traceless Sand Treading Steps.\u201cNot bad!\u201d Dongfang glanced at him with admiration. \u201cWhat exactly is the swordless realm like?\u201d\u201cThe sword qi displayed by this humble one must be condensed with the help of this wooden sword.\u201d Song Qingshu fell into recollection, \u201cFeng Qingyang\u2019s every gesture is full of sword qi, and the feeling is like\u2026 as if he himself is a wonderful sword.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Dongfang Bubai nodded thoughtfully.\u201cCult leader Dongfang, who else can beat the Great Monk?\u201d Kangxi has always been interested in these secrets about the world of wulin, and now that he was listening while sitting on the dragon throne, he felt really excited.\u201cThe rest are some seniors who live in seclusion. But are they still alive now? This Dongfang is not sure about it.\u201d Dongfang Bubai replied.\u201cThen there is the famous king of Nanyuan of Liao Kingdom, Xiao Feng, who was famous in the wulin in the past few years, The Ming Cult\u2019s Zhang Wuji, and Guo Jing; how do they fare against the Great Monk?\u201d Kangxi asked with curiosity on his face.\u201cI think their level should be between first and second class masters, even if it is slightly higher, I am afraid that they will not be able to easily defeat the Great Monk.\u201d Dongfang Bubai thought for a while and came up with his own estimate.Jiumozhi\u2019s face twitched, thinking that as expected, the Central Plains wulin, has many outstanding heroes.\u201cMay I know if the cult leader Dongfang has heard about a person named Dugu Qiubai?\u201d Song Qingshu suddenly remembered something and asked.\u201cDugu Qiubai?\u201d Dongfang Bubai shook his head and said that he hadn\u2019t heard of him before, but thinking of the literal meaning of the name, he couldn\u2019t help but sneer, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that \u2018to win\u2019 is easy, but to \u2018seek defeat\u2019 is hard.\u201d\u201cThis name conflicts with the name of cult leader Dongfang at first glance, but in my opinion, \u2018seeking defeat\u2019 is naturally not the equal of \u2018invincible\u2019.\u201d Wei Xiaobao on the side was really surprised by the show of strength by Dongfang Bubai in the previous fight. He bowed his head to admit defeat, and subconsciously churned out a few words of flattery.Jiumozhi and Song Qingshu glanced at each other, and secretly despised Wei Xiaobao in their hearts,\u00a0\u2018Judging from the name, the status of 'seeking defeat\u201d is very comparable to \u201cinvincibile\u201d.\u2019Dongfang Bubai obviously had the same idea. He was thinking about the craftiness of this shameless person. Suddenly his expression moved, and a strange smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, \u201cGreat Monk, I just said that there are many senior experts hidden in this world. It seems that there is one here.\u201dAs soon as the voice fell, Dongfang Bubai raised his hands. It was so fast that Song Qingshu didn\u2019t even have time to react yet. Dozens of embroidery needles had already shot densely into the shadow of a pillar in the Imperial Study Room.Song Qingshu and Jiumozhi looked up and saw dozens of gleaming needles, but there was no sign of any person.\u201cCult leader Dongfang is really strong in martial arts, and that attack just now almost managed to make\u00a0 this old man\u2019s heartbeat speed up. It has been a long time since that happened.\u201d As the obscure voice sounded, an old eunuch walked out of the shadow of a nearby pillar.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Kangxi was taken aback. If he hadn\u2019t seen him in eunuch clothes, he would have thought of him as an assassin.\u201cReplying to the Emperor\u2026\u201d The old eunuch looked thoughtful, and finally shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s been too long, this old man can\u2019t remember when, but I remember that the Emperor seemed to be surnamed Zhu when I entered the palace\u2026 \u201cKangxi\u2019s expression suddenly changed, and Wei Xiaobao was also taken aback. He hurriedly shouted, \u201cSomeone\u2026\u201d But before he could finish his words, there was already a thin needle in his throat.Wei Xiaobao was so frightened that he almost had a heart attack. He tried to move his body a few times, but he discovered that he was stabbed on his mute acupuncture point and couldn\u2019t make a sound. The rest of his body had no major problems.Jiumozhi and Song Qingshu were bluffed, and quickly became fully alert. You must know that both of them were top masters, and they didn\u2019t notice that there was another person in the room till now. Listening to the tone of Dongfang Bubai, he also seems to have just discovered it.\u201cWhy did you use \u201cSunflower Treasure\u201d?\u201d The Dongfang Bubai was obviously not at all calm in his heart, and their eyes were fixed on each other.\u201cYou ask this old man why he knows the \u2018Sunflower Treasure\u2019?\u201d The old eunuch chuckled, as if he had heard a big joke, and looked at the Dongfang Bubai and said, \u201cThe \u201cSunflower Treasure\u201d was created by me. You say, why would I not know about it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

According to this old eunuch, he might have been alive for hundreds of years.\u00a0\u2018What kind of methods of immortality do those Emperors look for everywhere, shouldn\u2019t it be enough to find this eunuch standing next to him? Hey, do you have to cut the little bird first if you want to live for so long? What kind of emperor would he be if someone did that?\u2019As expected, Dongfang Bubai didn\u2019t believe it, and snorted coldly, \u201cI will know after I test it.\u201d A silver needle flashed from his fingertips, and an afterimage attacked the old eunuch.The eunuch looked very old and frail, almost at death\u2019s door, but unexpectedly, his\u00a0 movement speed was not inferior to that of Dongfang Bubai!The rest of the people only saw a ray of red light and a ray of blue light tangling together in the room. Song Qingshu\u2019s expression turned a little ugly, because he couldn\u2019t follow the moves of those two at all!Jiumozhi was not feeling much better either, and he secretly squeezed out a cold sweat,\u00a0\u2018It seems that Dongfang Bubai had not tried his best in our fight just now.\u2019Noticing that Wei Xiaobao was flapping his big mouth and jumping up and down like a monkey, Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t resist feeling a little amused. He raised his hand, and suddenly sucked out the silver needle in his throat.\u201cHoly shi*t!\u201d Wei Xiaobao wiped the cold sweat on his forehead, \u201cWei Xiaobao almost became Wei Yabao.\u201d\u00a0(Goblin: Xiaobao means 'small treasure\u201d, Yabao means \u201cmute treasure\u201d.)\u201cXiao Guizi, are you able to see how they are fighting?\u201d Kangxi asked in shock.\u201cExcept for a blue shadow and a red shadow, I cannot see anything clearly! And there is no sound when they move as well. Are they humans or ghosts?\u201d Wei Xiaobao muttered softly.Not long after that, the two of them separated quickly and stood in the room, and the old eunuch coughed, \u201cVery good, very good. It is true that the waves behind the Yangtze River push the waves forward, and the younger generations are more capable\u00a0 than the older generations.\u201dSong Qingshu and Kumozhi: \u201cFu*k!\u201d\u201cAlthough you claim to be the creator of the Sunflower Manual, your strength is not much higher than this seat.\u201d Dongfang Bubai said this on the surface, but he understood very well in his heart that the opponent\u2019s martial arts realm was still higher than his own. It was just that the eunuch was too old, causing his movement to be a little bit slower than him. Therefore, they should be evenly matched.\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d The old eunuch didn\u2019t argue, \u201cAlso, about that Dugu Qiubai you mentioned before, this old man had the privilege to encounter him in the past, and with all due respect, the three of you together will not be his opponents. \u201c\u201cBy the way, you don\u2019t have to be so afraid, little Emperor. This old man has lived in the Forbidden City for a long time, and now I am dying and I don\u2019t want to change places. In the past few years, this old man has helped you avoid many calamities, so that should be enough as the lodging fee.\u201d The old eunuch\u2019s voice was getting lower and lower, and his figure slowly turned into nothingness, disappearing into the shadow in the corner.Song Qingshu suddenly realized that there were no masters in the guards of the Manchu Palace, but he had never heard of anyone entering the palace to assassinate Kangxi.\u00a0\u2018I am afraid that many assassins were dealt with by this old monster as soon as they entered the inner palace.\u2019Seeing the Sunflower Ancestor gradually disappear, Dongfang Bubai showed no other expression on his face. After a while, he said to Kangxi, \u201cIf the Emperor has nothing else for me to do, this Dongfang will take his leave for the time being.\u201d\u201cI have troubled cult leader Dongfang this time.\u201d Kangxi didn\u2019t mind the other party\u2019s attitude at all. \u201cHear me, send cult leader Dongfang back to his resting quarters.\u201dAfter Dongfang Bubai left, Kangxi ordered Wei Xiaobao to entertain Song Qingshu, and then left with Jiumozhi to have a talk.\u201cBig Brother Song, don\u2019t take offense, the Emperor didn\u2019t neglect you.\u201d After leaving the palace, Wei Xiaobao remained silent for a few moments before finally speaking.\u201cBrother Wei is being polite. As the Tubo national teacher, Jiumozhi came here for the purpose of forming an alliance. Naturally, it is a matter of national importance.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled lightly, but felt a little disappointed in his heart. In his previous life, he had only seen provincial and ministerial high-ranking officials. If Kangxi was put in the modern era, he should be at a proper core level. This time he thought that if he was recommended by Wei Xiaobao, he should be able to receive Kangxi\u2019s attention. But, this situation was out of his expectation.Seeing Wei Xiaobao\u2019s scornful look, Song Qingshu secretly murmured in his heart,\u00a0\u2018I thought this guy would be useful, but he proved to be unreliable in the end.\u2019\u201cWho cares about him?\u201d Wei Xiaobao came over and put his arms around Song Qingshu\u2019s shoulders, \u201cBig Brother Song, come to my house, you are my brother, I should treat you well on this occasion.\u201dThinking of the stirring culture that prevailed in his previous life, Song Qinghu\u2019s lips twitched, and he calmly put Wei Xiaobao\u2019s hand away, and smiled, \u201cYou said you would entertain me with the hottest girl in the capital.\u201dWei Xiaobao smirked, \u201cNext time, it\u2019s not easy to have those girls at such a short notice.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Song Qingshu was puzzled and suddenly realized, \u201cIs it because he is afraid of his lioness at home?\u201d\u201cWhat lioness?\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s face showed his confusion, but he could roughly guess what it meant, and couldn\u2019t help but argue, \u201cI\u2019m not bragging here, but my wife is probably the best woman in the world.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Song Qingshu raised his eyebrows, and he probably guessed who it was in his heart.\u201cXiaobao!\u201d Before entering the Lord\u2019s Mansion, a petite girl rushed over and suddenly rushed into Wei Xiaobao\u2019s arms. \u201cI heard them say that you were captured by the assassins and was planning to leave the capital to find you. Woooo~\u201d\u201cMy good wife!\u201d Wei Xiaobao also embraced the girl affectionately. After a while, he thought of Song Qingshu on the side and quickly said , \u201cOkay, I have a guest here. This is Brother Song. During this trip, he was the one who saved your husband\u2019s life.\u201dOnly then did Shuang\u2019er noticed Song Qingshu standing on the side, and quickly jumped out of Wei Xiaobao\u2019s arms, looked at Song Qingshu with a blushing face, and bowed courteously, \u201cI have seen Big Brother Song.\u201dSong Qingshu looked up, and saw her small eyebrows and lips. She looked very mild and beautiful. At this time, her pretty eyes full of tears looked even more pitiful.As he kept staring at her, the roots of Shuang\u2019er\u2019s snowy neck slowly turned red with a blush. So, Song Qingshu quickly replied, \u201cI have seen my younger brothers wife.\u201dWei Xiaobao on the side looked rather uncomfortable, and thought,\u00a0\u2018This Brother Song is good at everything, but the only pity is that he has the same hobbies as this Xiaobao. His face is ten times more handsome than mine, his martial arts is a hundred times better than mine, and staying beside him all the time, I, Wei Xiaobao, will seem like inferior goods.\u2019When the group entered the house, Song Qingshu quietly pulled Wei Xiaobao over and asked, \u201cI heard that Brother Wei has seven beautiful and pretty wives. I don\u2019t see where the other little sisters are?\u201d\u201cSeven?\u201d Wei Xiaobao wondered in his mind.\u00a0\u2018I only have two more. Fang Yi counts as one, and the little princess counts as two. So, doesn\u2019t that make it only three?\u2019\u201cHey, I only have three wives. Except for Shuang\u2019er, I don\u2019t know where the other two are now,\u201d Wei Xiaobao said excitedly, \u201cBut since Brother Song said that I have seven, it seems to be a good sign. I will definitely find four more in the future, wow hahaha~\u201d\u201cYou, fortunately Miss Fang and the little princess are not here, otherwise they would be sad to hear these words.\u201d Shuang\u2019er gave him an angry look.\u201cIsn\u2019t my Shuang\u2019er sad?\u201d Wei Xiaobao leaned toward Shuang\u2019er with a drooling face.\u201cOh, there are still people here, I won\u2019t bother to care about you.\u201d After a glance at Song Qingshu, Shuang\u2019er ran all the way into the inner hall.\u201cI heard Duo Long and Zhang Kangnian mentioning how virtuous your wife was. When I saw her today, Brother Wei\u2019s blessing is really enviable.\u201d Song Qingshu reluctantly glanced at the back of Shuang\u2019er and smiled at Wei Xiaobao.\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao smiled and waved his hand, but he wondered in his heart,\u00a0\u2018Does this little pretty boy want to woo my girls? But my Shuang\u2019er will definitely not hook up with anyone behind my back.\u2019During the banquet, Wei Xiaobao and Shuang\u2019er frequently toasted to Song Qingshu. Seeing the two couples\u2019 affectionate appearance, Song Qingshu was in a daze, thinking that he had been in this world for so long, and he was still all alone. He was feeling so desolate and lonely.After a glass of wine after another, Song Qingshu finally got drunk while wallowing in his sorrowing through the wine. Wei Xiaobao, who was beside him, was not much better. He had already collapsed on the chair and started talking nonsense.\u201cBig beauty, come and kiss one\u2026\u201d\u201cFang Yi, you stinky lady, you hurt me again\u2026\u201d\u201cMy Shuang\u2019er is still the best\u2026\u201dShuang\u2019er listened to his rambling from the side with anger and amusement. Then she glanced at Song Qingshu lying face down on the table. Shuang\u2019er quickly helped Wei Xiaobao back to the bedroom. She practiced martial arts, and it didn\u2019t take her much effort to lift a grown man.\u201cShuang\u2019er, don\u2019t go.\u201d Just after being put on the bed, Wei Xiaobao woke up suddenly and pulled her sleeves.\u201cXiaobao, be good, Brother Song is still drunk in the hall, I have to go and tend to him.\u201d Shuang\u2019er put Wei Xiaobao\u2019s hand back into the quilt, and when she saw his mouth mumble a few times, she turned around and whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s so cute when he\u2019s asleep\u201d And she couldn\u2019t help but smile.Back in the hall, seeing Song Qingshu still lying motionless on the table, Shuang\u2019er quickly ordered the maids beside him, \u201cTao Hong, Liu Lu, please help Song Brother to rest in his room.\u201d\u201cYes, Mistress!\u201d The two little maids with hair bun bowed and ran to Song Qingshu, trying to help him up together.But after a long time of trying, the faces of the two little maids became flushed, and they still couldn\u2019t move Song Qingshu.\u201cYoung mistress~\u201dSeeing the expressions of the two pitifully crying little girls, Shuang\u2019er rushed over to help, \u201cYou are still young and lack energy, so there is no need to be sad.\u201d\u201cYoung mistress is obviously only two or three years older than us.\u201d Tao Hong muttered with a small voice.Shuang\u2019er took Song Qingshu\u2019s arm, helped him up all at once, and said triumphantly, \u201cBut I have practiced martial arts.\u201dSeeing the admiration in the eyes of the two girls, Shuang\u2019er smiled and said, \u201cYou should clean up the table first, I can send Big Brother Song back to the room alone.\u201d\u201cBut he\u2026\u201d Liu Lu hesitated to speak.Shuang\u2019er quickly realized what she was worried about, and angrily said, \u201cWho makes you two little girls useless? Don\u2019t worry, he is already drunk. Besides, my martial arts is good.\u201dShuang\u2019er helped Song Qingshu to walk towards the guest\u00a0 room step by step, but she didn\u2019t know that the corner of the man\u2019s mouth behind her head showed a faint smile.Of course Song Qingshu did it deliberately, otherwise Tao Hong and Liu Lu would be able to move him even if they were too weak. Seeing that Shuang\u2019er came to help him, Song Qingshu immediately put all his body weight on her shoulders.Smelling the faint fragrance from her hair bun, and feeling the petite and exquisite body wrapped under her thin dress, Song Qingshu felt his mouth suddenly become a little dry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In order to avoid being discovered by the other party he acted like it was all the actions of a drunkard. Every time his body touched her, the feeling made Song Qingshu feel that he seemed to have returned to the scene of his first love in his previous life.A woman\u2019s sensitivity quickly made Shuang\u2019er aware, but smelling the strong scent of wine coming from his body, she thought that it was all subconscious action after being drunk, so her small face blushed red and she started to walk faster and faster.Finally arrived at the guest room, Shuang\u2019er just put Song Qingshu flat on the bed, but the other party suddenly stretched out his hands to hold her tightly in his arms.Shuang\u2019er became furious, and was about to attack, only to hear Song Qingshu mutter to himself, \u201cMiss Youyou, your Little Song have been very good, don\u2019t go, stay with me\u2026\u201d\u201cIt turns out that he regarded me as the woman who accompanied him while drinking wine in the brothel\u2026\u201d As her thoughts wandered, she suddenly blushed, and felt his hand actually started to wander around her body.\u201cPuff puff puff!\u201d Shuang\u2019er stretched out her fingers and tapped a few major acupuncture points on his chest, then she took the opportunity to jump off the bed, bitterly looked back at Song Qingshu on the bed, and bit her teeth, \u201cA man is easily broken when he drinks.\u201d After speaking, she blushed and quickly ran out of the room.Feeling that the other party\u2019s presence was far away, Song Qingshu on the bed opened his eyes, put his hand on the tip of his nose, took a deep breath, and noticed the fragrance of a woman.\u00a0 Song Qingshu, who had always regarded the characters in this world as intelligent NPCs, felt at a loss. With such a real feel, and that unique womanly fragrance, was this world really a game? But it felt too real.*****The next day, the imperial decree came from the imperial palace, and it announced that Wei Xiaobao and Song Qingshu would have to enter the palace for an audience.Before leaving, when Shuang\u2019er helped Wei Xiaobao organize his official uniform, she couldn\u2019t help but secretly glance at Song Qingshu with some alertness. But, seeing his expression was calm as usual, she was secretly relieved, thinking that last night was indeed a misunderstanding.Song Qingshu was of course very aware of this little action from Shuang\u2019er, and with a wry smile, he thought in his heart,\u00a0\u2018Although there were some evil intentions behind my actions last night, a large part of the reason was that I was indeed feeling a little melancholic in recent days. It doesn\u2019t matter if a virgin can hold back for more than twenty years, but for a man who has drunk blood and eaten meat, enduring for even twenty days will be a bit difficult. When I think about the last time I met Zhou Zhiruo, it seems that a long time has passed\u2026\u2019\u201cEmperor, do you want to clean up the wulin under the domain of the Qing Dynasty?\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s startled cry suddenly pulled Song Qingshu back to reality.\u201cExactly!\u201d Kangxi said with a stern face, \u201cNowadays, there are still many martial arts factions in the wulin, who are openly and secretly opposed to my Qing Court. For example, the reason why all the battles against Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s Golden Serpent Camp has repeatedly ended in failure is because the entire people Shandong wulin are their eyes and ears; and Xiaobao, you were chased and attacked brazenly by a group of people on your mission this time as well, it is really outrageous!\u201d\u201cYes, this group of people from wulin will fight and kill all day long. They refuse to accept the imperial edicts. It is indeed time to rectify.\u201d Wei Xiaobao remembered the embarrassment when he had been chased and attacked before. If they wanted to clear the weed, they would have to get rid of its roots first.\u201cBut it will be harder to stop people from talking. Such suppression by use of force will probably cause a strong backlash.\u201d Song Qingshu wondered how could Kangxi make such a crude move? So he decided to give a little advice and see if he could leave a good impression in Kangxi\u2019s heart, which might be of great help to his future plots.\u201cMaster Song\u2019s words are not unreasonable, but we have decided that we will not discuss this matter anymore.\u201d He realized that his tone may have been a bit blunt, and continued, \u201cYes, we think that the way we handled yesterday\u2019s matter was too rushed. You saved my Qing envoy, and indirectly thwarted the conspiracy of Mongolia and Shandong rebels. This achievement is not small. We would like to know what reward you want?\u201dSong Qingshu was speechless for a while,\u00a0\u2018Why does every person with high status love to ask this kind of question? What if I want this whole country, do you dare to give it?\u2019\u00a0He had no choice but to act modest and said, \u201cThe matter of saving Brother Wei was purely a coincidence, and I can\u2019t take any rewards for it.\u201d\u201cEmperor, brother Song\u2026Master Song has saved the life of this official from the assailants several times, and his martial arts is really strong\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao was grateful to Song Qingshu for his life-saving grace, and spared no effort to say nice things to help him.Yesterday, he also saw the fight between him and Dongfang Bubai. Although\u2026 his performance was a little embarrassing, Kangxi could also feel that Song Qingshu\u2019s martial arts was indeed very high. With a change of heart, he already had an idea, \u201cSong Qingshu, hear me!\u201dSong Qingshu knew that he should kneel to take orders in this situation, but as a modern person, he was very unaccustomed to kneeling to others. Noticing that Wei Xiaobao kept winking at him, he couldn\u2019t help but show a look of embarrassment.Kangxi felt a little displeased, but thinking of these chaotic times and the people competing for power, any wise monarch will have to recruit all kinds of talents at all costs. Anyway, a little etiquette was not a big deal. So he smiled and said, \u201cXiaobao, you don\u2019t have to be so concerned. Master Song is used to living free in the wulin, and it\u2019s okay of him to be not used to the rules of the palace, so let him stand.\u201dSong Qingshu glanced at Kangxi in amazement, thinking that he was indeed an Emperor worthy of being famous throughout the ages. He had achieved such a mindset at a young age.\u201cSong Qingshu is strong in martial arts, loyal to his monarch and the country\u2026 I specially designate Song Qingshu as a First-class Imperial Guard, and he doesn\u2019t need to kneel to any officials\u2026\u201d*****Even after he walked out of the Forbidden City, Song Qingshu was still in a trance.As if he knew what he was thinking, Wei Xiaobao came over with a smile and explained, \u201cBig Brother Song, don\u2019t underestimate this position of First-class Guard, this is an official title of the third rank! You suddenly became a third-rank official from a civilian, you can\u2019t imagine how many people would be jealous. If it weren\u2019t for the chaotic state of the present world, I\u2019m afraid the emperor would not grant such a great gift.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of guards is Zhang Kangnian?\u201d Song Qingshu asked curiously, wishing for his rank to be better than those two flatterers. Otherwise, this First-class Guard position would be nothing but garbage.Wei Xiaobao smiled, \u201cBig Brother Song, I know what you are thinking, don\u2019t worry, they are just the lowest Third-class guards among the Imperial Guards. With their skills, they don\u2019t even have the possibility of becoming second-class guards in this life.\u201d\u201cHaha~\u201d The two looked at each other and smiled, showing a knowing smile\u2026*****\u201cXiaobao, this time your mission is so dangerous, I will also go with you.\u201d Shuang\u2019er demanded to come along while looking at Wei Xiaobao.\u201cShuang\u2019er, my good wife, this time I will not only be accompanied by three thousand Cavalry Soldiers, but also the imperial guards led by Duo Long, as well as masters like Brother Song and Maha Cakra Vajra. How can there be any danger.\u201d Wei Xiaobao was quite serious about this. You must know that it was strictly forbidden to take female family members in the army camp, and it would also hinder certain matters of men.\u201cSince the Lady Shuang\u2019er cares about Lord Wei so much, why not let her pretend to be a soldier at your side?\u201d Zhang Kangnian on the side didn\u2019t understand his thoughts, and Duo Long and others echoed in agreement.Song Qingshu on the side smiled silently, but in his heart he wondered,\u00a0\u2018This time I have to go south to clean up the martial arts factions of wulin. I am afraid it will give me quite a bad reputation. Fortunately, Kangxi appointed me only as Wei Xiaobao\u2019s deputy.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wherever they passed, all sects and factions surrendered, and some were tough and unwilling to surrender, and they were quickly razed to the ground by the three thousand cavalry.The main altar of the Feiyun Gang in Hebei. The leader of the gang was now kneeling on the ground and shivering in dread.Seeing the remorse and unwillingness in this leader\u2019s eyes, Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but curse in his heart,\u00a0\u2018These ancient people didn\u2019t even know the concept of pretending in their thick heads. Wouldn\u2019t things be all fine and dandy if they just accept the imperial edict and express their nominal loyalty to the Qing Court? Although their reputation would suffer a bit, but at least they wouldn\u2019t have lost everything. Why do all these sects seem to be hell bent on digging out their ancestral graves? There were so many sects who chose to hit the mountain with pebbles, and their entire sect was removed from the wulin as a result\u2026\u2019Song Qingshu certainly wouldn\u2019t comprehend how much these ancient people valued their reputation. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty, there were organizations that could even fight over who was the most orthodox in the wulin. Those were fights that included several life and death battles, and what the Qing Dynasty was doing was nothing over the top.This Feiyun Gang accepted the Qing Dynasty\u2019s edict, so in this life he would not even be able to approach other the orthodox forces in wulin. As the saying goes, \u201cCrows everywhere are equally black\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to understand the thinking of these ancient people.\u201d Song Qingshu shook his head to dispel the distracting thoughts in his mind, and opened the list in his hand to find out which organization was the next unlucky ghost. The words \u2018Wangwu Sect\u2019 suddenly came into view, and his heart couldn\u2019t help but move.*****A few days later, the army quickly marched to the foot of Wangwu Mountain. The local officials introduced the situation of the Wangwu faction to Wei Xiaobao in a respectful manner, \u201cThe leader of the Wangwu faction, Situ Bolei, was an old general of the King of Pingxi Wu Sangui. Because he was dissatisfied with the King of Pingxi\u2019s decision to take refuge in the Ming Empire, in his anger he led a group of people into the wulin, and finally settled in the Wangwu Mountain as a bandit group\u2026\u201d\u201cWangwu Mountain has dangerous terrain. There are well-trained subordinates guarding the other side along the trails. It is easy to defend and difficult to attack\u2026\u201d The magistrate said while observing Wei Xiaobao\u2019s expression.It turned out that there were thousands of people under Situ Bolei, many of whom were veterans in the past who were good at fighting. Since they settled in Wangwu Mountain, local officials had not been able to find a way to eliminate them. It was a pity that the bureaucrats quickly licked blood on the heads of those knives and there were no results to show to the public.Considering that this group of people showed no signs of rebellion, the magistrate was afraid that reporting this matter to the court would affect his own political performance, so he simply turned a blind eye to the whole thing. This led to the Wangwu faction becoming bigger and bigger, and now it was able to fight the court army. Their current strength was enough to resist this assault.\u201cReporting to the lord, this subordinate has already sent people to investigate. Wangwu Mountain is indeed easy to defend and difficult to attack. If we were to launch an attack, I am afraid that we would suffer heavy losses.\u201d A general said in Wei Xiaobao\u2019s ear.\u2018Fu*k, why did this Wangwu sect have to go do anti-Qing activities? I don\u2019t even know if it has anything to do with the Heaven and Earth Society?\u2019\u00a0\u00a0Wei Xiaobao felt irritated, quickly waved his hand, and said, \u201cWe will camp and rest here tonight. We will be staying here for some time, the attack on the Wangwu Sect\u00a0 needs a long-term plan.\u201dThe generals retired one after another and started ordering the soldiers. Song Qingshu smiled at Duo Long and the others, and also said goodbye.\u201cXiaobao, this Wangwu Sect looks like a benevolent and righteous faction, but you are helping the Qing Emperor to destroy it. My whole family also died at the hands of the Manchu forces\u2026\u201d Seeing everyone leaving, she couldn\u2019t endure anymore, her eyes turned red, and she looked at Wei Xiaobao with sadness.\u201cShuang\u2019er, the Emperor\u2019s orders are absolute, and your husband can\u2019t do anything against it.\u201d Wei Xiaobao exhaled a long sigh.\u201cThen why can\u2019t you stop being an official of the Qing Dynasty? Wouldn\u2019t we be a hundred times happier if we lived in seclusion in the mountains and forests?\u201d Shuang\u2019er looked at Wei Xiaobao hopefully.\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao didn\u2019t take it seriously. He couldn\u2019t bear to leave this life of glory and wealth, and he quickly coaxed, \u201cMy good wife, you also know that I, your husband, am a hall master of the Heaven and Earth Society. I will definitely find a way to save them. It\u2019s just that it takes time to think about a method\u2026\u201d\u201cXiaobao, I knew you were the best.\u201d Shuang\u2019er burst into laughter.Song Qingshu, who was deliberately walking slowly, listened to the whispers from the two people in the big tent, and smiled in his heart,\u00a0\u2018It seems that Wei Xiaobao is also thinking of letting the Wangwu faction go. That\u2019ll make things easy for me.\u2019After night fell, Song Qingshu dressed himself in black clothes, put on a silver mask, and silently sneaked up into the Wangwu Mountain.The army was very close to the territory, and the Wangwu Sect had long been prepared to face the enemy. There were several layers of heavy armored soldiers guarding on the way up the mountain. So that the rabbits could not escape.They didn\u2019t know that Song Qingshu had a peerless movement technique, the Traceless Sand Treading Steps and when he used it with all his strength, the guards could only notice a slight gust of wind. Song Qingshu had already swept past the guards, all the way to the top of the mountain, and no one noticed him.In this era, the martial arts masters who could sneak up the mountain silently under this kind of situation could be counted with the palm one\u2019s hand. One was Dongfang Bubai, the other was the Sunflower Ancestor who created the Sunflower Manual, and another one was the Green Winged Bat King, Wei Yixiao. As for Jiumozhi, although his martial arts level was high, it was absolutely impossible for him to travel undetected by any guards.*****In the Wangwu Sect\u2019s base camp, in a wooden house, Zeng Rou was leaning against the window, resting her cheek in her hand, staring at the bright moon in a daze.At the root of the mountain was the Manchu army. During the day, all her uncles, brothers and disciples quarreled a lot about this, and all the people were feeling panicked for some time.Thinking of her Master\u2019s sad face, Zeng Rou looked at the moon, put her little hand on her lips, closed her eyes, and muttered to herself and made a wish, \u201cMoon God\u2026Oh Moon God, please bless our Wangwu Sect through disaster. This time the situation seems quite bad!\u201dWhen she opened her eyes, she found that there was a masked person standing in front of her. All blood drained from her pretty face, and she subconsciously opened her mouth to scream.Song Qingshu looked at the woman in front of him, a round face with a very sweet contour, her big eyes were dark and shiny, and there was a trace of panic in her eyes. She was looking at him in fear. His mind started to think, looking at her age, it should be somewhere close to the age of that girl, Zeng Rou.Suddenly he heard the voice of the patrol team coming closer. Song Qingshu jumped into the room, closed the windows and sealed her mute accupoint.\u201cIs he a flower-picking thief?\u201d Zeng Rou was even more frightened when thinking of some legends of the world. (Goblin: Flower-picking thief refers to one of those lecherous fiends who preys on young women)Guessing her thoughts, Song Qingshu looked at her in amusement, \u201cDidn\u2019t you make a wish to the Moon God just now? The Moon God felt your sincerity, so he sent me down to rescue your Wangwu Sect.\u201dZeng Rou\u2019s face turned red. She was not stupid. She knew that he was making fun of her deliberately. Her thoughts were being seen through by this strange man, and Zeng Rou couldn\u2019t wait to run away.\u201cI\u2019m going to unseal your acupuncture points, but you are not allowed to shout. If you agree, just blink your eyes.\u201d Seeing that she blinked quickly a few times, Song Qingshu smiled and unsealed her acupuncture points.Zeng Rou created a safe distance from him, grabbed the sword on the table, and only then she felt a little relieved in her heart. Then she raised her head and asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201dWhen he heard her clear and sweet voice, a calming breeze blew over Song Qingshu\u2019s whole body. Her voice was unspeakably comforting to the ear, and he secretly sighed,\u00a0\u2018They all say that a gentle flower has three good points- soft tone, soft body, easy to push down; these points are perfectly applicable to this young girl.\u2019\u201cI am the savior of your Wangwu Sect.\u201d There were no top masters in the entire Wangwu Sect. Song Qingshu didn\u2019t need to be as nervous when facing them. He looked around leisurely. After not finding a stool for a while, he took advantage of the situation and sat on the side of the bed.Seeing him sitting on her own bed, Zeng Rou was irritated and couldn\u2019t resist scolding him, \u201cNonsense.\u201d\u201cSo you think I\u2019m talking nonsense?\u201d Song Qingshu gave her an angry look. \u201cThere are thousands of elites under the mountain now. Although your Wangwu Sect occupies a favorable place, you can\u2019t hope to resist them. In the end, it is hard for you to escape this disaster. \u201cZeng Rou\u2019s face turned pale, what he said was similar to what everyone was talking about during the day, and she felt sad, \u201cCould it be that the end of Wangwu Sect is really inevitable?\u201dSeeing her pitiful expression, Song Qingshu felt pity, \u201cLittle girl, if you tell me your name, this envoy will help you out.\u201dZeng Rou\u2019s face flushed red and she glanced at him angrily, but said nothing.\u201cI can guess even if you don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu pretended to pinch his fingers and said, shaking his head, \u201cIsn\u2019t your name Zeng Rou?\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Zeng Rou covered her lips in horror and looked at him incredulously.\u201cI just said that I was sent by the Moon God, you still don\u2019t believe it?\u201d Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but show a smile.Zeng Rou\u2019s heart was also shaken, and she glanced at him with a complicated expression, \u201cMay I know how you plan to save us?\u201d\u201cLittle girl, your position in the sect is very low. It\u2019s useless to tell you.\u201d Song Qingshu stood up, and noticed that she was scared and subconsciously backed away. He couldn\u2019t help but smile, \u201cI don\u2019t have time to play with you, take me to see your master.\u201dHow could Zeng Rou dare to rashly bring a person of unknown origin to see her master? She drew out the long sword in her hand, pointed at him and said, \u201cQuickly tell me who you are, or I will really call someone!\u201dSong Qingshu lifted his hand, and Zeng Rou immediately felt a strong suction force. Unprepared, she lost her balance and fell into the opponent\u2019s arms.\u201cAh~\u201d Zeng Rou couldn\u2019t help it anymore, a woman\u2019s nature made her scream.His hand stopped on her thin and slender waist, but Song Qingshu didn\u2019t mean to stop her scream at all.He came up the mountain secretly this time without telling Wei Xiaobao, Jiumozhi and the others, and was always worried that he would be found out if he delayed for too long.He reached the top of the mountain, but was dumbfounded to find that the wooden houses were almost the same everywhere, and even after searching for a while, he couldn\u2019t find Situ Bolei\u2019s location.With the enrichment of his inner strength, Song Qingshu became more and more perceptive. He heard the voice of a girl wishing in the wind and followed the sound, only then he found Zeng Rou.Unexpectedly, she did not believe his act, and refused to take him to find Situ Bolei. In desperation, he had to expose his presence and use Zeng Rou to lead the other party out.\u201cScream louder\u2026the more miserable and sorrowful the better.\u201d Song Qingshu embraced her gentle body and squeezed her small waist in a wanton manner. Was this not acting like the so-called flower-picking thief?Zeng Rou was held in his arms, and her acupuncture point was sealed in an instant. Only her mouth could make a sound. She was shocked and frightened, so she shouted more intensely.Goblin: Have you ever read T.S. Eliot\u2019s\u00a0The Waste Land? This poem is a thing of pure horror. Especially if you have to analyze and explain it. The exam is going quite well. See you next chapter and thank you for staying with me!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Coming to Wangwu Mountain and acting wild!\u201dSong Qingshu completely ignored the clamor, until a middle-aged man with white beard walked out of the crowd.\u201cLooking at your martial arts attainment, you are by no means a normal master, so why bother yourself with a little girl?\u201d the middle-aged man asked in a deep voice.\u201cAre you Situ Bolei?\u201d Song Qingshu opened his eyes and glanced at the other person.\u201cYes, this old man is him.\u201d The middle-aged man replied.From his aura, Song Qingshu knew that this man was not a great martial artist, but he had a kind of steady and disciplined air that was unique to soldiers. Song Qingshu secretly nodded, \u201cI need to talk to this old hero regarding some important matters. Do you have the courage to follow? If you do, then let us go into that house and talk more about it.\u201dSitu Bolei fell into silence. The other party visited late at night, acting suspiciously. Wouldn\u2019t it be dangerous to follow him into the house?Seeing their leader\u2019s silence, the others shouted and urged him not to be fooled.Extreme times require extreme measures, so Song Qingshu coughed and said, \u201cIt is inevitable that the old hero Situ has some doubts, but I am not asking you to come in, but threatening, understand?\u201dSong Qingshu paused and continued, \u201cI count to three. If you don\u2019t come to talk to me in the house, I will strip off one piece of this little girl\u2019s clothes; then start counting again, and strip her again, until there is nothing to strip off.\u201dZeng Rou\u2019s face turned pale with fright, and everyone from the Wangwu Sect also scolded out loud.\u201cLittle beauty, do you think you brothers and sisters would pretend to be righteous and procrastinate to delay time just to take a look at your beautiful body? One\u2026two\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu gently touched Zeng Rou\u2019s cheek with the tip of his nose. And took a sigh of intoxication, this girl\u2019s unique youthful taste was really wonderful.\u201cKill me, I won\u2019t be insulted by you!\u201d Although Zeng Rou was afraid in her heart and trembling involuntarily, she was unwilling to let her beloved master fall into danger.\u201cOkay, I will follow you into the house!\u201d Situ Burei finally spoke up. Zeng Rou was entrusted to him by an old friend at the time of his death, and he couldn\u2019t let Zeng Rou\u2019s innocence be ruined today.\u201cSure enough, old Situ is indeed a hero, please go ahead!\u201d Song Qingshu stepped aside and made a gesture.Holding Zeng Rou, Song Qingshu slowly followed Situ Bolei into the house, and noticed that the others were also surrounding him. Song Qingshu circulated his internal strength, and flicked his sleeves. Everyone felt a strong force hitting their body, and they all unsteadily fell to the ground one after another.\u201cAfter this, if anyone dares to come within three feet of this hut, this stone will be his fate.\u201d Song Qingshu used a fist strike and blasted a big stone next to him to pieces.Zeng Rou saw the broken stone and felt cold in her heart,\u00a0\u2018This man\u2019s martial arts is so high and so strong\u2026\u2019The rest of the people also paled and stopped one after another.\u201cWhat do you want to say to this old man?\u201d Situ Bolei also saw the scene just now, and wondered how many times this man\u2019s martial arts was better than him. But he faced Song Qingshu with a calm heart.Song Qingshu was impressed by the demeanor of this battle hardened hero, and with a light push, he let go of Zeng Rou.\u201cMaster~\u201d As soon as Zeng Rou got out of trouble, she hurriedly hid behind Situ Bolei, and tenderly called out to her master in a timid manner.Situ Bolei comforted Zeng Rou, then blankly looked back at Song Qingshu.\u201cIn order to meet the old hero Situ, this one had to act his way in a hurry. I offended Miss Zeng Rou and hope that she would forgive my sin.\u201d Song Qingshu politely bowed, changing his previous predominant and ferocious appearance.Zeng Rou was ashamed and angry at the thought that he had wiped a lot of oil on her body just now, but only two people knew about these things privately, and she couldn\u2019t disclose it to her master at the moment, so she could only stare at him angrily in protest.Situ Bolei said nonchalantly, \u201cYour Excellency should explain why you are here.\u201d\u201cNow that there are thousands of elite soldiers at the foot of the mountain, may I know what old hero Situ plans to do?\u201d Song Qingshu found a stool for himself and sat down.Situ Bolei wanted to say something and stopped. He wanted to say that the countermeasure could not be said to an outsider, but suddenly realized that there was no countermeasure to begin with, and his thought couldn\u2019t help but freeze there.\u201cIf I guessed right, your Wangwu Sect wants to defend from here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Song Qingshu spoke up when he saw that the man wasn\u2019t speaking.\u201cHuh, Wangwu Mountain is easy to defend and hard to attack. If the Qing soldiers want to attack, it\u2019s not that easy.\u201d Situ Burei snorted coldly.\u201cYes, there are three thousand cavalry soldiers at the foot of the mountain. If they attack, I am afraid that they will not lose their soldiers. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu paused on purpose.\u201cJust what?\u201d Zeng Rou asked curiously.Song Qingshu smiled and said, \u201cThe old hero thinks that the Wangwu Sect can always be at ease like it was before. What is the biggest reason for that? Is it really due to the thousands of people under your command?\u201dSitu Bolei\u2019s face was a little ugly, \u201cWe have over two thousand people in our Wangwu Mountain, that\u2019s why the Qing Court didn\u2019t bother us.\u201d\u201cWrong!\u201d Song Qingshu stood up, \u201cThe reason why they let you be is that you have not been in the sight of the Qing Court before this, and the local officials did not report your situation to the court for various reasons. This time the Qing Court\u2019s order to sweep the wulin is different. This order comes directly from the Emperor. So, if you fight against the imperial army, it will attract the attention of Kangxi\u2026 Hey, if that happened, then there will be a steady stream of officers and soldiers coming to suppress the bandits. How will you face them then? And for how long?\u201dSitu Bolei was in a cold sweat as soon as he realized the seriousness of the problem. Looking at Song Qingshu, his heart moved and he quickly asked, \u201cThank you for your advice. I wonder if you have a way to save us?\u201dSong Qingshu chuckled, \u201cThe old hero reacted quickly. I am indeed here to show you a way out. Currently there are three strategies for you to choose. Does the old hero wish to listen?\u201dSitu Bolei spoke with a solemn expression, \u201cI would like to hear the details.\u201d\u201cIf you consider the best policy. Naturally, it is to accept the edict of the Qing court on the surface. The court will gain respect, and you will save your skin in return. Everyone will be happy. The officers and soldiers at the foot of the mountain all have their families and loved ones. Not one of them will object to this if you accept the edict.\u201d Song Qingshu said with a smile.\u201cIf you want me to surrender to the Qing Dynasty, that\u2019s absolutely impossible!\u201d Situ Bolei shook his head as soon as he heard it, as if he didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore.\u201cThe old hero Situ is indeed a well-known anti-Qing righteous man. You are very strong, and I admire you!\u201d Song Qingshu knew that he would never agree to this best plan, and he didn\u2019t care about it. \u201cThen the old hero might as well listen to my next plan.\u201d\u201cPlease speak.\u201d Situ Burei finally calmed down.\u201cThe next strategy is the central strategy of the Thirty-Six Stratagems.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled, thinking that when the enemy is strong and we are weak, Grandpa Sun\u2019s theory of guerrilla warfare is an unbreakable truth.\u00a0(Goblin: It\u2019s from the book The Art of War.)\u201cRun away?\u201d Situ Burei thought for a moment and shook his head, \u201cIf I flee without a fight, I will become a laughing stock in the wulin.\u201d Situ Burei paused and added, \u201cBesides, the army at the foot of the mountain is blocking the exit. How can it be so easy to leave.\u201d\u201cWhat is the next strategy?\u201d Zeng Rou heard him say that the second strategy was better than the first strategy. Maybe the third strategy will be better than the second strategy.\u201cNaturally, the next plan is to stay at Wangwu Mountain and wait to deal with the successive waves of suppression by the court.\u201d Song Qingshu looked at Zeng Rou who was in a blue dress and smiled. In this dress, even without the use of make up, she created the picture of the most innocent beauty he had ever seen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It mentioned that even if you think your ideas are good, don\u2019t present them directly, but tactfully mix a few bad ones. This will create options. Then leave those options for your audience to choose.Don\u2019t underestimate this method. Due to the weakness of human nature, this would give your opponent an illusion that the final decision was his choice, and he would be very happy to implement it, completely unaware that his choice was actually yours from the start.Sure enough, after listening to Song Qingshu\u2019s third strategy, Situ Bolei\u2019s attention returned to the second strategy.\u201cOld hero, in fact, there are ways to solve the two points you are worried about now.\u201d Song Qingshu tactfully spoke a few words when he saw the man muttering to himself and considering his gains and losses.\u201cPlease advise.\u201d Situ Bolei\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but flash up.\u201cTomorrow night, the guards in the Qing military camp will be slack. You can choose from a dozen powerful and trusted martial artists to bypass the perimeter defenses of the Qing army and go straight to the tent of the commander-in-chief, then kill him by surprise.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s eyes flashed with an inexplicable light.\u201cHow do you know that the guards of the Qing army will be relaxed tomorrow?\u201d Situ Bolei was not stupid. He couldn\u2019t help but suspect that this guy was a spy sent by the Qing army. He probably wanted to lure him to go there and then kill everyone.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to believe me, but if you miss tomorrow\u2019s opportunity. I\u2019m afraid you will have to stay at Wangwu Mountain forever.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled faintly, looked at the old man\u2019s suspicious eyes, and sneered, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to guess anything. It\u2019s really easy for me to kill you, so why would I go through so much trouble? Without a leader to lead them, even a horde of dragons would scatter like a mass of sand. I am afraid that they will be easily wiped out by your forces after that.\u201dSitu Bolei\u2019s face sank, but he also knew that the other party was telling the truth. When one considers the situation, this man really didn\u2019t have any reason to deceive him.\u201cBut this old man heard that in addition to the 3000 cavalry under the Qing army\u2019s command, there are also the Imperial Guards and two top masters. If we go there alone, I am afraid that we will be sending sheep to the tiger\u2019s mouth.\u201d Situ Bolei couldn\u2019t help but frown when he thought about this matter.\u201cYes, you will definitely be caught, there is no mistake about that.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled strangely.\u201cWhat!\u201d Zeng Rou, who had been silent all the time, became angry at once, \u201cAre you here to deceive us?\u201d Situ Bolei also stared at him suspiciously.\u201cThere is no other way out for your Wangwu Sect if you don\u2019t do this.\u201d Song Qingshu said with a wry smile, \u201cOtherwise you can only run away in embarrassment, and it will not sound good once it spreads in the wulin.\u201d\u201cWe will have gained face, but our heads won\u2019t be saved.\u201d Situ Bolei snorted coldly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you two, listen to me slowly.\u201d Song Qingshu quickly explained, \u201cWhen you act, you only need to bring one or two people who are afraid of death. After some complex circumstances, the commander of the Qing army will naturally let you go. Before you act, remember to tell everyone in the Wangwu Sect to divide the disciples into groups and leave Wangwu Mountain in the dark. The Qing army will also turn a blind eye to all this.\u201d\u201cIf he catches us, why would he release us?\u201d Situ Burei said in utter disbelief.\u201cI have my own way to make him let you go.\u201d Song Qingshu spoke with an inexplicable confidence in his tone.\u201cBullsh*it!\u201d Zeng Rou wrinkled her nose, turned her head and pulled Situ Burei, \u201cMaster, don\u2019t listen to this bad guy. He doesn\u2019t even dare to show his face, and is so crafty, he surely doesn\u2019t have any good intentions.\u201dSitu Bolei nodded, then looked at Song Qingshu and asked, \u201cWho is your Excellency and why do you want to help me and the Wangwu Sect? If you don\u2019t make it clear, I\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t have the confidence to act according to your suggestion.\u201d\u201cI wear a mask because I fear that if your disciples see my appearance, they will reveal some flaws tomorrow.\u201d Song Qingshu reached out and took off the mask and threw it aside, \u201cI don\u2019t need to hide anything from the two of you.\u201dZeng Rou always thought that he would be a wicked looking bad guy. How could she know that the face under the mask was so good-looking; her face flushed, she lowered her head and stared at her feet in a daze.\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Situ Bolei was startled, \u201cAre you a member of the Qing army.\u201d\u201cThis humble one is Song Qingshu. I am one of the two Qing court masters you mentioned just now.\u201d Song Qingshu shrugged and said with a wry smile.Zeng Rou raised her head in surprise, thinking in her heart,\u00a0\u2018He is actually one of the two martial arts masters who have been terrorizing the martial arts factions in several provinces, but he is obviously so young, not much older than me\u2026\u2019\u201cWhy is Master Song helping the Wangwu Sect?\u201d Situ Bolei was even more puzzled.\u201cIn the past, the old hero Situ was loyal to the Ming Dynasty. You did not even hesitate to give up your glory and wealth, left the King of Pingxi, and returned to the mountain forest. Coincidentally, this humble one and the former Princess Changping of Ming Dynasty are\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu paused deliberately, his expression showed a little hesitation, \u201cWe are close friends. When I saw that you were in distress, this Song would naturally not stand idly and do nothing.\u201d\u00a0(Goblin: Someone give this guy an Oscar or something! Princess Changping is the title of Ajiu. She was introduced in chapter 53, 54, and 55.)Listening to his ambiguous tone, Situ Burei was surprised,\u00a0\u2018Could it be that he and the princess are lovers? But, it is clearly rumored in the wulin that the princess likes the Golden Serpent King.\u2019However, when he thought about the fickle minds of youngsters these days, he showed an expression of understanding. \u201cIt turns out that Young Master Song and the princess have that kind of relationship. Just now this old man has offended you, so I hope Young Master Song will not take it to heart.\u201dHearing what Song Qingshu said, Zeng Rou fell in a daze, but suddenly she felt a trace of anger,\u00a0\u2018Since he has a lover, why did he treat me like that just now!?\u2019\u201cGeneral Situ is being polite.\u201d Song Qingshu changed to the official title of the Ming Dynasty. Situ Bolei was extremely flattered. \u201cThis Song now bears the humiliation and bows down to the Qing court, just to take the opportunity to preserve the remaining power of the Ming Dynasty. Don\u2019t worry. This Song has a way to keep you safe and sound tomorrow.\u201dThe reason why Song Qingshu was so confident was because he knew that Wei Xiaobao was a hall master of the Heaven and Earth Society, and he will definitely try to let the Wangwu Sect go, and with his help, it\u2019ll not be a problem to make things go according to his plot.Moreover, Wei Xiaobao couldn\u2019t tell anyone about his identity as a hall master of the Heaven and Earth Society, so in the eyes of Situ Bolei and others, Song Qingshu was the one that helped them avoid this catastrophe.Song Qingshu was never satisfied with being a small fry in the Qing Court, he was a very prideful person. So of course, he would never get tired of this act of selling mercy and buying people\u2019s hearts.However, borrowing a chicken to lay eggs also needed to have its own path to success, so Wangwu Sect\u2019s forces had to be included in Song Qingshu\u2019s plan.\u201cWell, since Young Master Song is a friend of the princess, I believe it won\u2019t hurt us. So this old man will bet on you this time.\u201d Situ Bolei thought for a while and finally made a decision.Song Qingshu was overjoyed and quickly discussed some details of tomorrow\u2019s actions with him.*****The next day, Wei Xiaobao called various officers to discuss the matters of Wangwu Sect. There were no shortage of competent people in the Army Camp, and they discussed a lot of ways to attack the mountains, but it was a pity that they were all rejected by Wei Xiaobao because of the heavy damage to the Camp.Song Qingshu understood Wei Xiaobao\u2019s thoughts. He couldn\u2019t help but smile knowingly when he watched these people so eager to find a way, \u201cThis Song has a way. You can win against the Wangwu Sect without losing your soldiers and generals.\u201d\u201cBrother Song, say it quickly!\u201d Wei Xiaobao thought in his heart,\u00a0\u2018I hope that it won\u2019t really be too effective of a plan, otherwise it will be difficult for me to accept it.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the time comes, we will pretend to gather people and pretend to gamble and relax, so that everyone in Wangwu Sect will think that there is a chance. They will have the idea of launching a surprise attack, and they won\u2019t be able to resist coming down from the mountain.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d The generals all praised the plan, and Wei Xiaobao scolded him in his heart, but he could do nothing but agree.That night, everyone set up a gambling arena in the army camp. Wei Xiaobao took out a stack of silver taels and put them on the table. He pointed at the five or six thousand taels of silver, and said, \u201cWhoever has the ability, come and win!\u201dBut, in his heart, he kept praying that the group of people on Wangwu Mountain would never come down.All the officers placed bets one after another, eating and merrymaking. After betting for a while, everyone got immersed, and the bet got bigger. Even a sergeant squeezed from behind and handed in money to place the bet.They were obviously pretending to be gambling and keeping their guards up at first, but afterwards, all of their eyes turned red, and some even ran back to the camp to find colleagues who did not gamble to borrow money to make more money.The military camp turned into a real casino, full of screaming, and the sound of eating and drinking.Wei Xiaobao was secretly proud,\u00a0\u2018Hey, the more you bet, you will not be able to catch the people sent by the Wangwu Sect when the time comes.\u2019Suddenly, one person loudly said, \u201cBet on this!\u201dAnd a watermelon-like thing dropped on the betting table. When everyone saw what it was, they were immediately shocked. The thing on the gambling table was impressively a bloody head. It was the head of a first-level guard wearing an official hat of the royal guard, who was patrolling outside the tents.Everyone looked up in shock, and found that there were more than a dozen people wearing blue clothes in the camp, holding long swords in their hands.The soldiers immediately prepared to counterattack with their weapons. But, they didn\u2019t realize that when the gambling had just started to get good, they had thrown aside the weapons on their bodies. At this time, while the opponent stared at them, if anyone wanted to pick their weapon up, they might immediately become the target of the opponent\u2019s attack. At this moment, no one dared not move.\u201cHuh, the Qing Army really has fallen low, and they have a stinky incompetent leader who gathers people in the barracks for gambling.\u201d Situ Bolei\u2019s eyes swept the scene with a calm expression.\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily.\u201d With a long laugh, Jiumozhi walked out of the crowd.When she noticed Song Qingshu standing next to Jiumozhi, Zeng Rou\u2019s face couldn\u2019t help but flush red, thinking who knows what in her heart.Situ Bolei\u2019s eyes showed a determined look, and together with a few others he attacked Jiumozhi.\u201cYour swordsmanship is pretty good, but it\u2019s mixed and impure.\u201d Jiumozhi sneered, his hands formed palm-prints up and down, and an air mass visible to the naked eye formed in the middle, which immediately countered his opponent\u2019s three sword strikes.Situ Bolei and the others had cold sweat on their temples, and found that the long sword in their hands was no longer under their control.\u201cHoh Hoh! What a superb display of martial arts!\u201d A group of military officers thought that Jiumozhi was very wise and skillful, and they started cheering for him.A smug smile appeared at the corner of Jiumozhi\u2019s mouth, and with a light pinch, all three sword strikes were shattered, and the tip of the swords were waived and reflected back to the three of them.The soldiers in the tent took the opportunity to gather and launch a counter attack, and everyone in the Wangwu Sect panicked and their faces turned ashen.Looking at the people of the Wangwu Sect who had just been subdued, Wei Xiaobao had a headache, his eyes rolled and he started searching for an excuse to let them go.Noticing that it was the right time, Song Qingshu asked aloud, \u201cYour king dares to send his men to kill officials of the court in their army camp! This is a serious crime of treason. Aren\u2019t you afraid of the punishment of decapitation?\u201d\u201cHmph, we have done our best for the King of Pingxi, and we will be content even if we die here. The King of Pingxi will rise up soon, and the good days of you Qing Court will come to an end.\u201d Situ Bolei spoke according to what they had discussed last night.Sure enough, all the officers in the scene looked at each other and Zhang Kangnian angrily rebuked, \u201cNonsense, the King of Pingxi has always been loyal to the Emperor, and has been guarding Shanhai Pass for so many years to fend against Mongolia. If you want to create discord, then you have found the wrong target.\u201dWei Xiaobao, on the other hand, was very clear about the mutual distrust between Kangxi and Wu Sangui. And, this Situ Bolei was previously a general under Wu Sangui. So he wondered,\u00a0\u2018Is this guy telling the truth? No, my master specifically informed me beforehand and asked me to save the remnants of the previous royal house. Oh! I understand\u2026this old man must have hated Wu Sangui\u2019s bones. This time he thought that he was bound to die, so he wanted to pull Wu Sangui down with him!\u2019After understanding this, Wei Xiaobao hurriedly gathered several high-level officials in the operation to discuss with him, \u201cI heard the Emperor accidentally reveal the idea of uniting the domain some time ago. Could it be that the news leaked and made Wu Sangui anxious to make a move?\u201dHow could this group of people know that there was such a change, and Jiumozhi was taken aback, \u201cIf Wu Sangui really has a change of heart, that would be a big deal.\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s eyebrows twitched and took the opportunity to add fuel to the fire, \u201cIf we catch this group of people and Wu Sangui gets the news then launches an attack in a hurry, the Emperor may not be able to deal with it in such a short notice. Maybe he will be displeased and blame us.\u201dSeveral Army camp officers were so scared that they didn\u2019t dare to participate in such high-level turmoil. One moment of carelessness could be the cause of family destruction, and they all looked at Wei Xiaobao, \u201cEverything is up to Lord Wei.\u201dWei Xiaobao glanced at Song Qingshu in surprise. He didn\u2019t expect this guy to say everything he wanted to say, and quickly added, \u201cI\u2019m afraid we have to find a way to suppress this matter. We might as well let these people go.\u201d\u201cLet them go?\u201d The people on the scene felt that they couldn\u2019t understand this logic. They finally managed to capture the people of Wangwu Sect all at once, and now they were going to just let them go?\u201cThis is why you people will never be officials.\u201d Wei Xiaobao said with a light cough, and pretended to give them a lecture, \u201cYou arrested them and now you are thinking that you have made a great contribution. But, as Brother Song has already analyzed it; in the end, the Emperor will not only never reward us, maybe he will punish us instead. But letting them go makes a big difference.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d Jiumozhi was very confused, and thought that the officialdom of the central plains was more complicated than comprehending martial arts.\u201cThink about it\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao said in a low voice, \u201cThey failed in their mission and were captured, but then we let them go. They would definitely not dare to mention this to Wu Sangui when they go back. If they spoke of this matter, Wu Sangui would surely suspect that they might have surrendered to the court, otherwise it would be impossible for us to let them go. They are not fools, so how can they speak of this to Wu Sangui?\u201d\u201cIn this way, Wu Sangui wouldn\u2019t know what happened today, so naturally he won\u2019t rebel so quickly. But we can notify the emperor in advance and let the court prepare early. Maybe the Emperor will be happy, and he will remember our great achievement.\u201d\u201cSangui suffers, and we reap the rewards!\u201d Zhao Qixian couldn\u2019t help but give him a thumbs up.Duo Long also smiled and said, \u201cI thank Brother Wei for reminding us, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be able to realize that we were making such a big mistake today.\u201dJiumozhi also sighed, \u201cThe ways of Central Plains is really broad and profound.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao slanted his eyes and looked at the Wangwu Sect in the distance. \u201cThey killed our brothers and we cannot let them go like this. It would damage the morale of our brothers. Hehe, I have to get back some interest from them.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The people of my Wangwu Sect are not so soft that they will even frown.\u201d Situ Bolei coldly snorted, turned his head, and stopped looking at him.\u201cYou think that you group of ruffians from the wulin would be able to grab a King\u2019s thigh? Who will believe these lies?\u201d Wei Xiaobao smiled, \u201cBut, I am in a good mood today, I am even willing to let you people go\u2026\u201dHearing Wei Xiaobao\u2019s words, many people in the Wangwu Sect raised their heads with hopes in their eyes. Originally, if anyone killed officials and created chaos and if they were caught, they would naturally be beheaded. There was absolutely no way to escape. But, now there was a glimmer of hope.\u201cWell, just now we were gambling here, so you may as well come and gamble with me. Those who win will naturally be able to leave. As for the losers\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao sneered, his meaning was obvious.\u201cWhat about the person who lost?\u201d Someone from the Wangwu Sect couldn\u2019t resist asking.\u201cOh, it\u2019s not a big deal\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao said with an indifferent attitude, \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to leave your head.\u201dWei Xiaobao thought that the lie he created just now would be enough to deceive these fools. But he was afraid it would be a bit of a stretch to deceive Kangxi. So, he decided that a few people must be detained and sent back to the Emperor.Everyone in the Wangwu faction felt chills, thinking that half of their brothers would have to be left here this time.\u201cWhat\u2019s the gambling method then?\u201d A pretty voice sounded, and Wei Xiaobao looked back and noticed Zeng Rou in the crowd.\u201cFu*k, why is there such a beautiful woman! Why didn\u2019t I see her before this?\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s heart swayed, and he was determined to leave a good impression in front of this beautiful girl, so he quickly said with a smile, \u201cI, Wei Xiaobao, am full of pity and cherish every life. There is no need for this little sister to gamble, you can go first.\u201dZeng Rou\u2019s face turned red and then white, she shook her head slowly, and whispered: \u201cI don\u2019t want your pity, we\u2026we all are a group, naturally we live and die together.\u201dAt this moment, she was extremely frightened in her heart, but she did not want to escape alone. She raised her head and saw Song Qingshu\u2019s friendly gaze. For some reason, her heart calmed down and her speech became more and more fluid. Everyone in the field could not help but admire her guts.\u201cOkay, Little Sister, you are very loyal.\u201d Wei Xiaobao said, \u201cSince you live and die together, you don\u2019t have to bet one by one. Little girl, you bet with me. You win, and all the people will get out together. If you lose, all nineteen heads will be cut off all at once. Are you happy with this?\u201dZeng Rou looked back at Situ Bolei, and waited for him to decide.Situ Burei fell into a dilemma and it was hard for him to decide. If all the nineteen people bet against this young official, then some of them are bound to lose. Even if he takes this man\u2019s words as truth and believes him, then only half of the nineteen people were likely to survive. He could try again in the future to get revenge. But if Zeng Rou rolls the dice and wins, all of them could get out of here alive. But, she can also lose, so it would be too dangerous of a gamble.\u201cLittle Junior Sister, you have a good point! We live and die together as a single stream, would I have the face to escape alone if I win? Anyway, my life was already spared once today, so you can bet with him. We live and die together.\u201d\u00a0 A big man in blue clothes said loudly, and everyone else agreed.Wei Xiaobao pushed the dice pot in front of her, \u201cOkay, Little Sister, you roll first, and the one with the higher points wins.\u201dZeng Rou reached out and grabbed three dice, her eyelashes trembling lightly, she was obviously very nervous, and she shook the dice in her hand and cast them into the bowl.Everyone from the Wangwu Sect leaned closer to see, and their faces turned pale. It turned out that Zeng Rou had thrown two one points, one two point, and that was all out of ten, she had already lost ninety-nine percent.The man in blue suddenly exclaimed,\u00a0 \u201cMy head, I will bet by myself. Other people\u2019s throws are not counted.\u201dSitu Bolei angrily shouted, \u201cHow can a man be so greedy for life and fear death?\u201dThe man said, \u201cYou\u2019re just my master, and not my father. Why do you want to decide my life and death?\u201dSomeone in the crowd sneered and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything when the little Junior Sister threw it just now. Now that you see her toss four points, you suddenly have lots to speak, hehe.\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s heart moved, and he cried out\u00a0\u2018good!\u2019\u00a0in his heart.Wei Xiaobao\u2019s eyes lit up, and he quickly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of this good brother?\u201dThe man was overjoyed: \u201cThis lowly one\u2019s name is Yuan Yifang.\u201d\u201cYou have no loyalty, why don\u2019t you change your name and call yourself Yuan Fang?\u201d The people from the Wangwu Sect burst into laughter.\u201cYuan Fang?\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s expression turned weird. Yuan Fang, you really can\u2019t catch a break, and you are ridiculed everywhere.\u201cWho else wants to gamble on his own?\u201d Wei Xiaobao looked around the audience, and several people hesitated, but in the end, they didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cSince there is none, I will throw it.\u201d Although Wei Xiaobao\u2019s face looked relaxed, his heart was nervous. If he didn\u2019t practice this for a long time, he may not be able to throw three ones in a try. And, that would end up killing this group of people and him being scolded by his master. Also, wasn\u2019t it a pity that this little flower-like girl would also die?What happened next went according to the plot in the original story. Wei Xiaobao cheated and threw out three ones, then took the opportunity to let go of the Wangwu Sect, and finally tortured Yuan Yifang and escorted him back to capital for Kangxi to decide.\u201cWhat the hell, I was so kind, but that little girl didn\u2019t even look at me.\u201d Thinking of Zeng Rou\u2019s silence when she left, and her parting glance at Song Qingshu, Wei Xiaobao felt uncomfortable. He only felt that he had done the most loss-making business in the world, and thought with hate,\u00a0\u2018Sure enough, men love money, and young girls love pretty boys.\u2019Song Qingshu, on the other hand, was horrified by Zeng Rou\u2019s gaze, and secretly squeezed out a cold sweat,\u00a0\u2018That woman was unreliable at the critical moment and almost ruined everything.\u2019In order to divert everyone\u2019s attention, Song Qingshu hurriedly asked, \u201cBrother Wei, the matter with the Wangwu Sect has been settled, who is the next unlucky sect?\u201dWei Xiaobao took out the sheet with the information and glanced at it, his face turned somewhat sullen, thinking that the words on it knew me, but he didn\u2019t know them, so he quickly handed it to Song Qingshu, \u201cBrother Song, please read it to everyone.\u201dSong Qingshu took a look and couldn\u2019t help being surprised, \u201cMount Tai Sect?\u201d\u201cMaster Song, is this Mount Tai Sect very powerful?\u201d Seeing Song Qingshu\u2019s expression from the side, Jiumozhi\u00a0 suddenly asked curiously.\u201cMount Tai Sect\u2019s martial arts is nothing more than the limits of master Yu Zhenzi.\u201d Song Qingshu said.\u201cYu Zhenzi?\u201d Duo Long frowned. \u201cThe Taoist who is known as the number one master under Prince Bao?\u201d\u201cThis is not a problem. Although Yu Zhenzi used to be part of the Mount Tai Sect, he has bad character and has already been expelled from the Mount Tai Sect.\u201d Song Qingshu deliberately collected information from the wulin during this period of time to prepare himself. He already verified the known plots by comparing them, so he knew it in quite detail, \u201cWhat I am worried about is the Five Sacred Mountains Sword Sects. Since they claim to be the same faction, now that the Mount Tai Sect is about to suffer, the other four factions will probably not stand idly by.\u201d\u201cThe Five Sacred Mountains Sword Sects?\u201d Wei Xiaobao also heard about it, \u201cBut those Mount Hua, (South) Mount Heng, (North) Mount Heng, and Mount Song are not in the territory of my Qing Dynasty, will they also come here to bathe in the muddy water?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cMy Mount Tai Sect is in such a disaster, but I can get all the wulin friends to help me, Tianmen is grateful. I express my endless gratitude.\u201d\u201cDaoist Tianmen is being polite. Our Five Sacred Mountain Sword Sect is the same in spirit. If one is in trouble, and the other four are in trouble as well. It\u2019s not just for lip service.\u201d Mount Song Sect leader Zuo Lengchan stood up and said.\u201cThe words of the leader of the left alliance are quite true. Now the Emperor Kangxi of the Manchu Qing Dynasty is braving the world and setting off a storm in wulin. People in the wulin of my generation will deal with him to the end.\u201d Mount Hua Sect leader Yue Buqun also spoke immediately.\u201cAmitabha Buddha\u2026\u201d Grand Master Fang Zheng declared, \u201cThe Manchu Emperor\u2019s bloodbath in the wulin is really too heavy. Brother Xuanci sent this old monk to help, hoping to resolve the catastrophe in the wulin.\u201d\u201cDaoist Spiritual Master Zhang of this one\u2019s sect heard that there was a young man in the Qing court this time, who seemed to have the same name as our disciple Song Qingshu. So, he sent this poor Daoist to find out.\u201d It turned out that Wudang had sent Daoist Chongxu.Zuo Lengchan was silent on the side, thinking in his heart,\u00a0\u2018Shaolin and Wudang are indeed the two giants in the wulin. Master Fang Zheng is only one of the ten great abbots of Shaolin Temple, but his martial arts is already above me. I don\u2019t even know how high abbot Xuanci\u2019s martial arts is? Taoist Chongxu only ranks second among the five masters of Wudang Sect, and his martial arts is not below me. According to the information we have on the direct disciples of Zhang Sanfeng from the Zixiao Palace, I am afraid their martial arts are even better\u2026\u2019\u201cWith the help of Shaolin and Wudang, along with the help of the Five Sacred Mountains Sword Sect, my Mount Tai Sect can be said to have no worries.\u201d The old man Tianmen was feeling relieved. He had been really worried about the extermination of their sect before, worrying that he would become the great sinner of the Mount Tai Sect, and he finally relaxed today. His blood pressure came back down.\u201cBut the other party is coming with thousands of soldiers and horses. It is really unwise for us to fight against them head on.\u201d Yue Buqun quickly realized the key problem.Taoist Tianmen laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everyone, this poor Taoist has already asked a great hero for help a few days ago, and the other party promised to help us deal with the Manchu soldiers.\u201dMaster Fang Zheng thought in his heart and said, \u201cCould it be Yuan Chengzhi, the Golden Serpent King who has been in Shandong in recent years?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s exactly him!\u201d The Taoist Tianmen stroked his beard and smiled, \u201cThe Golden Serpent King defeated the Qing army several times. He has always been very prestigious in the wulin in Shandong, and he also promised to come personally to give the Qing army a head-on fight and give them a hard blow.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good news.\u201d The leader of the (South) Mount Heng Sect Mo Da also said, \u201cIt has long been known that the Golden Serpent King Yuan Chengzhi is not only outstanding in his strategy, but even his martial arts is one of the best in the world. With his help, the Qing forces will probably be defeated this time.\u201d\u201cThat is good. However, there will be countless deaths and injuries in the fighting between the two armies. Can this poor nun suggest using the ways of wulin? We should avoid innocent casualties.\u201d The leader of (North) Mount Heng Sect, Nun Dingjing felt that the death would be too unbearable.\u201cYes, we can force them to compete with us using that method.\u201d The members of Mount Tai Sect had discussed this for a long time. The members of the current generation have thought that this time, if the Manchu forces are damaged too much, it will surely usher in even more tragic revenge from Emperor Kangxi. That would be disastrous. It is impossible for the Mount Tai Sect to call Yuan Chengzhi and various factions for help every time, so they unanimously decided to win or lose by the ways of wulin. Although Taoist Tianmen is not happy in his heart, he can\u2019t go against everyone\u2019s opinion.*****Wei Xiaobao and his party arrived near Mount Tai. As soon as they set up camp, soldiers came to report that they had received a letter from the Mount Tai Sect.\u201cOh!\u201d Wei Xiaobao suddenly lifted his spirits. On the way here, all sects and factions were passively beaten down. It was the first time someone dared to propose a face-to-face confrontation, so he immediately became interested, \u201cWhat is written in the letter? ?\u201d\u201cThe other party asked us to use the rules of the wulin to determine the victory and defeat, and we will have three matches. If the Mount Tai Sect wins, our Qing Dynasty can no longer come to make things difficult for them. If we win, the Mount Tai Sect will naturally accept the Emperor\u2019s decree.\u201d After taking a look at the letter, he explained.\u201cHey, this group of ruffians are good at making up wishful thoughts.\u201d Wei Xiaobao smiled, \u201cAre we vegetarians? I have thousands of soldiers and horses under my hand. Why should we compete with them to determine victory or defeat?\u201d\u201cReporting!\u201d At this time, another scout reported back while sweating profusely, \u201cSir, I found the Golden Serpent Camp army thirty miles away.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The generals of the Qing army looked at each other, thinking that this was supposed to be just a relaxing trip, but they didn\u2019t know they would\u00a0 hit the iron plate all at once.\u201cHow many of them are there? How fast are they moving? Did they find you?\u201d Duo Long was still calm, and he asked immediately.\u201cReplying to the Commander!\u201d The scout replied, \u201cThe other party has about three or four thousand soldiers. But I don\u2019t know why, they chose to camp there, and they deliberately sent me a message across the river, saying that as long as we agree to the proposed method. We can avoid meeting each other.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that the group of Taoists and Priests dared to invite us to compete. It turns out that the Golden Serpent Camp was behind them.\u201d Song Qingshu was puzzled, \u201cBut why didn\u2019t the Golden Serpent Camp attack us?\u201dThey discussed this matter for half a day and still didn\u2019t understand. How could they know that Yuan Chengzhi also had his own difficulties? Although he fought and achieved several big victories in the past few years, his direct forces had also lost a lot. Now the Qing Dynasty was getting stronger and stronger. Many of his subordinates from the outside factions were beginning to become restless.As Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s direct forces of the Golden Serpent Camp became the minority, he had gradually become unable to suppress some unruly people. That was why he was not willing to fight the Qing army.\u201cGreat Monk, Brother Song, are you certain you can win in a contest of martial arts?\u201d Although Wei Xiaobao talked and laughed happily, he was terribly scared. He didn\u2019t want anything to do with fighting or any of that bullshit, but it must be his fate to get tangled in a fight. So he turned his mind towards the martial arts contest.\u201cPoor monk can win a fight.\u201d Jiumozhi smiled faintly, with unspeakable arrogance in his tone.\u201cBig Brother Song, how about you?\u201d Wei Xiaobao was overjoyed and turned to ask.\u201cExcept Yuan Chengzhi, I should have no problem with everyone else.\u201d Song Qingshu thought about it carefully. Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s martial arts should be better than his, and he estimated that among the remaining people, Zuo Lengchan had the highest martial arts among the masters of the Five Sacred Mountain Sword Sects. As long as he was guarded against his cold energy, coupled with his knowledge of the Five Sacred Mountain Sword Art, he had an innate advantage, and it was not a big problem to defeat him.\u201cHaha, it seems that in this gambling appointment our victory is certain.\u201d Wei Xiaobao was happy in his heart and suddenly asked, \u201cAs for our third participant\u2026\u201dSeeing everyone in the scene looking at him, Duo Long suddenly dropped his chin, and tremblingly pointed at himself and asked, \u201cMe?\u201d\u201cBrother Duo, you, as the commander of the imperial guards, must be first-class in martial arts. Among the remaining people on our side, you have the highest level of martial arts. Who could it be except you?\u201d Wei Xiaobao smiled.Duo Long\u2019s expression turned bitter, and he knew that he would naturally have no problem dealing with ordinary thieves, but for this group of martial arts maniacs, he was probably not an opponent.Seeing his sad expression, Wei Xiaobao naturally guessed what he was thinking, and quickly pulled him aside, \u201cBrother, I will teach you a way to ensure that you are not in danger.\u201d\u201cBrother Wei really is righteous, what is the method?\u201d Duo Long\u2019s eyes lit up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We will use the inferior horse to fight against the best horse. No brother, I\u2019m not calling you an inferior horse! You just have to surrender, and after that the Great Monk and Brother Song will be able to secure the victory.\u201d\u201cBrother Wei really has a brilliant plan.\u201d Duo Long\u2019s eyes lit up when he heard it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can still do something even if I lose.\u201dAfter making a decision, Wei Xiaobao hurriedly sent a letter to the Mount Tai Sect. On the second day, Song Qingshu, Jiumozhi, and Duo Long went to the site of the meeting alone. Seeing Wei Xiaobao who was beckoning to them at the foot of the mountain, Song Qingshu became somewhat angry, \u2018This little ruffian is obviously greedy for life and fears death and dare not go up the mountain. The little shit even said that the chief commander of the army is going to be in the army and give us the glory of battle!\u2019\u201cThe battle is upon us, Master Song must not be impetuous.\u201d Jiumozhi turned his head and glanced at him with a smile, obviously he had guessed what he was thinking.\u201cThank you Great Monk for your kind advice.\u201d Song Qingshu blushed and asked quickly, \u201cI am curious to know how Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s martial arts compares with Great Monk?\u201d\u201cHis martial arts skills are very high, but he will lose in a one-on-one fight.\u201d After the last fight, Jiumozhi kept trying to figure out Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s weird Golden Serpent Swordplay, knowing that if he encountered it again, he would definitely not be defeated by him like last time. He didn\u2019t want to bear the shame of fleeing from a fight again.\u201cI am just intrigued to know which three of them they will send to fight.\u201d Looking at the Mountain in the distance, Song Qingshu said worriedly. He didn\u2019t care much about the safety of the three of them. Everyone here was a great master. Without Wei Xiaobao to drag them down, even if the Mount Tai Sect was shameless enough to attack, he and Jiumozhi could still retreat calmly. Uh, as for Duo Long\u2026that fellow daoist will not die a coward\u2019s death.\u201cA martial art master of the Qing Dynasty, the Maha Cakra Vajra, Jiumozhi, has come to experience the mountain.\u201d Before reaching the mountain gate, Jiumozhi had already summoned his internal energy and sent his loud voice in that direction.Song Qingshu\u2019s face turned black, this big-eared monk still loves to show off so much, but why do you have to scream?All the masters present on the Jade Emperor Peak of Mount Tai were shocked, the internal energy of this Jiumozhi was probably superior to everyone here.After the three of them went up the mountain, everyone there cast their eyes on them. What they saw was a Monk, a young man, and a group of officers and soldiers. Facing a group of masters, they did not show any timidity at all.\u201cQingshu, it really is you.\u201d When Taoist Chongxu saw that young man, he immediately recognized him as Wudang\u2019s banished apprentice Song Qingshu.Song Qingshu was startled, wondering how anyone could recognize him? Looking back, Chongxu\u2019s appearance and attire gave a faint impression in his mind, \u201cElder Chongxu?\u201d\u201cQingshu, when Daoist spiritual master Zhang banished you from the sect, his true intention was to make you reflect on your own faults. But we didn\u2019t expect you to fall so low and become a running dog of the Qing Dynasty.\u201d Daoist Chongxu\u2019s tone was full of regret.The people on the scene didn\u2019t expect this change. Many people present at the Shaolin Temple\u2019s Lion-slaying Assembly had heard of it, and they all looked at Song Qingshu.Jiumozhi also glanced at Song Qingshu and was surprised, thinking in his heart, \u2018Song Qingshu is so young, yet his martial arts are so strong, it turns out that he was from the Wudang Sect, no wonder\u2026\u2019\u201cSong Qingshu owed the Wudang Sect, and it was paid off at the Lion-slaying Assembly. It\u2019s just that the heavens took pity on me, let me have another chance at life. Now Song Qingshu has nothing to do with the Wudang Sect, and you don\u2019t have to show this anger. We have no connection.\u201d Song Qingshu said coldly, but everyone in the scene did not notice the mystery in his words. They didn\u2019t know that he had clearly stated his relationship with the previous Song Qingshu.He was not the original Song Qingshu, and he didn\u2019t get the slightest benefit from the Wudang Sect. When he woke up, his meridians were destroyed and he was banished by the Wudang Sect, which led to a series of humiliations. And now, a person from the Wudang sect suddenly appeared, placed themselves on the moral high ground and bagan to blame him. So, Song Qingshu would naturally not give him any face.\u201cGood, good!\u201d Although Daoist Chongxu had a lot of self-cultivation, even he became very angry. \u201cThen let this senior clear our shame.\u201d After saying that, he was ready to draw his sword and attack.\u201cWait, today is the agreed-upon martial arts contest to determine an outcome. Are you sure you are the first master they are sending out?\u201d Song Qingshu asked.Daoist Chongxu advance couldn\u2019t help but stagnate, and he looked back to his camp. Zuo Lengchan thought, \u2018Of those present here, Master Fang Zheng\u2019s Yi Jin Jing (Tendon Changing Method) has reached the highest stage, and he is bound to win. The Golden Serpent King Yuan Chengzhi also has outstanding martial arts skills\u2026wait a moment. As a surprise piece, he should participate at the end, and the remaining candidates must also be cautious. At present, Doist Chongxu and I have the highest martial arts, and there is nothing wrong with sending him up. It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t actually know anything about this young man, his level of strength is not clear\u2026\u2019Thinking of this, Zuo Lengchan stood up and said, \u201cThis is something concerning the internal matters of your Wudang Sect, and should not be counted in this contest of martial arts, if you can escape with your life under Daoist Chongxu\u2019s hand, this Zuo will come to experience your brilliant skills.\u201dEveryone in the scene scolded him as shameless, even Master Fang Zheng couldn\u2019t help but frown, feeling that it was a bit wrong to bully a young junior like this.If Song Qingshu refused, and the other party wouldn\u2019t be able to say anything, but being maddened by Daoist Chongxu, he couldn\u2019t help humming coldly, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be dealing with Daoist Chongxu first, and you should be prepared. I will be sure to teach Master Zou some of my brilliant skills.\u201dDaoist Chongxu frowned, and couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cSong Qingshu, you are still too immature, and this poor Daoist doesn\u2019t want to take advantage of this. You can fight with the leader of the faction first, and this poor Daoist will come to ask for advice in the future.\u201dJiumozhi also admired the integrity of this man, and was about to persuade Song Qingshu to agree, but the other party directly refused and said, \u201cNo, it will only take one move to defeat you. It won\u2019t cost me too much energy, and so Master Zou wouldn\u2019t be able to take advantage of it.\u201dAs soon as this statement came out, everyone at the scene felt that he was extremely arrogant. Daoist Chongxu was a famous master in the wulin, with his mastery of Taiji Swordplay. Defeating him with one move, even Jiumozhi felt that Song Qingshu was blinded by anger.Daoist Chongxu laughed twice, \u201cGood, good, good! Poor Daoist will then see how your Excellency beats me with one move.\u201d\u201cYou must make the move first, otherwise I might not even have the chance to draw the sword when I make a move.\u201d Song Qingshu stood with one of his hands behind his back, and with the other he made a gesture of \u2018bring it on\u2019, with the gait of a grandmaster, \u201cIf I can\u2019t defeat you with one move. You can just treat me as if I lost, and I won\u2019t be competing later as well.\u201dJiumozhi and Duo Long changed their expressions and were about to stop. Song Qingshu raised his hand and showed a look that made them feel relieved. The two of them had to suppress their doubts and watch the changes.Daoist Chongxu\u2019s expression hardened, and he wondered if the other party had really learned some majestic skills, so now that he was so confident? Thinking that today was a matter of the Mount Tai Sect\u2019s survival, as long as he wins this match first, and wins the next match for the Mount Tai Sect. After that he could decide what to do about the matter of his own sect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sword was horizontally in front of his chest, and his left and right palms were facing each other, like holding a ball. Everyone in the scene saw that his sword strike had not yet been released, and they were already ready to admire his sword skills.Holding the sword art in his right hand, the sword in his left hand slightly shook. Suddenly it pierced ahead, and the tip of the sword trembled sharply. It was impossible to see where the attack was coming from. It targeted Song Qingshu\u2019s\u00a0 seven major acupoints.Three flaws were revealed, and Jiumozhi was about to open his mouth to remind Song Qingshu of the flaws in the opponent\u2019s sword skills. Suddenly, several white circles appeared in front of everyone, large circles and small circles, positive circles and diagonal circles, flashing endlessly. It created a circular pattern in front of Jiumozhi\u2019s eyes, he realized that the previous flaws had disappeared.Daoist Chongxu sword created more and more illusory circles. After a short while, his whole body has been hidden in countless circles. When one circle disappeared, another regenerated. The long sword was extremely fast, and it didn\u2019t produce the slightest shadow. The sound of the blade splitting the wind showed that the flexibility of the performer had reached the state of a master. Everyone at the scene could no longer see any flaws in his swordsmanship, but felt that there were thousands of long swords covering his whole body. They were shocked for a while, thinking that the reputation of the Taiji Swordplay was really well deserved.A smile appeared at the corner of Song Qingshu\u2019s mouth, he unsheathed his wooden sword, and performed The Dragon Soars in the Sky from the Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms.\u201cNo!\u201d Jiumozhi thought he was insane, if he was hit by the sword, wouldn\u2019t his arm be cut off by the opponent\u2019s long sword?The rest of the masters in the scene also felt that Song Qingshu was too arrogant. He wanted to show off, so he rushed to the most dazzling place of the opponent\u2019s sword formation, thinking that he was invincible.Unexpectedly, after the sound of the metals colliding, Daoist Chongxu actually took five steps back, looking at the half of the long sword in his hand, his face turned ashen, and he said in disbelief, \u201cI was defeated!\u201dEveryone in the scene stood up in shock. They didn\u2019t know how the situation had suddenly reversed, and the people with lower martial arts didn\u2019t understand what had happened.Jiumozhi, Fang Zheng, Zuo Lengchan and others barely saw a peculiarity. It seems that the center of the circles of Taiji Swordplay was its flaw. Maybe Zhang Sanfeng knew about this flaw, but it was certain that even Daoist Chongxu himself did not know about it. However, this Song Qingshu.. he could tell at a glance! They couldn\u2019t help but start to reassess Song Qingshu\u2019s strength.Song Qingshu thanked his luck once again. Just now, he repeatedly spoke out without shame just to provoke the other party.Under the covenant of one move, Daoist Chongxu would not be able to tell whether what he was saying was true or false, and would definitely use the strongest defensive swordsmanship in order to seek stability, and think that he would be invincible from the beginning.What he didn\u2019t know was that Song Qingshu was a cheat character who was familiar with the original story. Of course, he knew that the weakness of his Taiji Swordplay was in the most dazzling part of the circles. If Daoist Chongxu used ordinary swordsmanship to attack and defend against Song Qingshu, based on his swordsmanship, it was likely that neither of them would be able to determine the victory or defeat within a hundred moves, but Daoist Chongxu eventually chose Taiji Swordplay, which Song Qingshu was familiar with and its weaknesses.He was defeated by one of the younger generations in the sect, even if Daoist Chongxu was a thousand times more broad-minded, he couldn\u2019t help feeling ashamed, \u201cPoor Daoist has no face\u00a0 to stay here anymore, I shall first go back to the sect and reflect in seclusion.\u201d Everyone kept quiet as he went down the mountain alone.\u201cI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to stay unrelated to Wudang Sect\u2019s name anymore.\u201d Song Qingshu sighed and looked up at Zuo Lengchan, \u201cChief of the alliance, it\u2019s your turn to fight.\u201dZuo Lengchan\u2019s face turned blue and then white, thinking that his and Daoist Chongxu\u2019s martial arts were about the same, and Daoist Chongxu was defeated by him.But after all, he was a hero of wulin, and when his mind was set, he would have to find a solution, \u201cOkay, but even an expert swordsman like Daoist Chongxu was defeated by your swordsmanship. This Zuo is afraid that his swordsmanship is no better than Daoist Chongxu. So this time I have decided to change the comparison method, and not to compare sword skills with you.\u201dZuo Lengchan generously admitted that his swordsmanship was inferior to Daoist Chongxu, but no one in the scene felt that he was upright and honest. On the contrary, they did not expect him to compete with a younger generation as a respectable martial arts senior, but he asked the other party to not use his best martial arts. How shameless was this?\u201cOh, what do you want to compare?\u201d Song Qingshu suddenly became interested.\u201cInternal energy.\u201d Zuo Lengchan looked at Song Qingshu and sneered in his heart. Even if this guy started practicing in his mother\u2019s womb, how high can his internal strength be at this age?Jiumozhi already knew that he himself was a very shameless person. But, he didn\u2019t expect to encounter someone with a thicker skin than him this time. He couldn\u2019t help but sneer, \u201cYour Excellency, as the chief of the Five Sacred Mountain Sword Sects, this kind of behavior is quite shameful.\u201d\u201cHeh!\u201d Zuo Lengchan didn\u2019t care, \u201cWe are going to compete in martial arts, and there is no rule that we must compete only with swords.\u201dSong Qingshu knew that the other party wanted to deal with him with his Freezing Inner Energy, so he put the wooden sword back behind him, and said with a smile, \u201cThat\u2019s right, this one admires the chief of the alliance\u2019s style and boldness. Today I am here to experience your brilliant skills.\u201dSeeing that his tone did not seem to be false, Zuo Lengchan felt strange, could it be that this guy really admired him?What he didn\u2019t know was that Song Qingshu really admired him for his cruel behavior, and he had the majestic aura of a ruler. It was a pity that he had no protagonist\u2019s plot armor in the original story.\u201cYoung Master Song, if you please!\u201d Zuo Lengchan, as a famous figure in the martial arts, was asking his opponent to abandon his sword and use his palm.\u201cOkay!\u201d Song Qingshu was not polite, and attacked with the Great Devil Subduing Palm.A few feet away, when Zuo Lengchan felt oncoming ferocious air, he couldn\u2019t help being shocked, and hurriedly used the Mount Song Sect\u2019s Great Song Yang Palm to match him.Zuo Lengchan fists and palm style consisted of sudden movements and it had lots of variations. Song Qingshu\u2019s style was simple, but it was extremely powerful. Every time he attacked, he managed to land a hit. In contrast, Zuo Lengchan\u2019s Great Song Yang Palm had too many tricks and too many variations. As the two fought faster and faster, those who were slightly weaker in martial arts in the field could hardly see their movements.\u201cGreat Monk,\u00a0 between Young Master Song and the chief of the alliance, who has the upper hand?\u201d Duo Long only felt that the situation between the two was dangerous, and he couldn\u2019t see who had the advantage, so he couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cAlthough this Chief of the alliance is currently restrained, his decades of martial arts cultivation is not for nothing. It may not be easy for Young Master Song to defeat him.\u201d Jiumozhi could see at a glance that the two of them were now in a stalemate. No one could beat the other in a short time.Zuo Lengchan became more confident as he fought, and he was grateful. Although his opponent\u2019s palm strike was clever, it was not as shocking as his swordsmanship that was just revealed. He immediately summoned more of his strength to attack his opponent.Song Qingshu frowned slightly. He wanted to take advantage of the opportunity of fighting with a master to integrate all the palm skills he knew. However, if he wanted to use the Golden Palm of the Emei Sect, the Wudang Sect\u2019s Taiji Fist, the Heaven Shaking Iron Palm, the Silky Palm; The Heart Shattering Palm, the Great Devil Subduing Palm in the Nine Yin Scripture, and the Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms of the Beggar Sect\u2019s and slowly integrate them together. How would he even be able to do it?The Golden Palm, Wudang Taiji Fist, and the Heaven Shaking Iron Palm, Wudang Silky Palm contained the softness aspect and there was nothing superfluous left in them. Heart Shattering Palm, and the Great Devil Subduing Palm are the masterworks of Huang Chang, the grand master of a generation. It was not easy to change one move or the other. The Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms have been improved by dozens of generations of Beggar Sect masters, and it can be said that it has reached the pinnacle. Adding something would be too much, and subtracting something would result in an insufficient output.So, how could Song Qingshu just simply change anything?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He only felt that Song Qingshu\u2019s palm technique became more and more fluent, and if this stalemate continued like this, the other party might really be able to integrate several different styles of palm techniques.And there was a trace of thought in his heart to surpass Song Qingshu. He just admitted that he was inferior in terms of sword skills. And now, if he couldn\u2019t beat him, the prestige of Mount Song Sect and himself would hit rock bottom. Thinking of this, Zuo Lengchan became determined, he started fighting while expending a great amount of internal strength. Circulating the Freezing Inner Energy at his fingertips, he stabbed towards his opponent.Song Qingshu\u2019s heart shuddered, knowing that this was Zuo Lengchan\u2019s unique skill, Freezing Inner Energy, but he wanted to try his Divine Brilliance Scripture true qi against it without evading, and he threw out a palm strike.Palm and fingers clashed, and the two who were just as fast as lightning settled down immediately. In the eyes of the others on the top of the Jade Emperor Peak, Zuo Lengchan\u2019s face became paler and paler, and the stone slab on which his feet, a bit of frost could be seen. But Song Qingshu\u2019s expression was solemn, with a faint red color flashing on his face.\u201cGreat Monk, will Young Master Song be okay?\u201d Seeing Zuo Lengchan\u2019s ability to freeze all the slabs and produce ice, Duo Long was shocked and couldn\u2019t help but worry for Song Qingshu.But Jiumozhi showed a calm smile, \u201cThe Chief can rest assured, when masters compete with internal energy, the victory or defeat is quite noticeable. This chief of the alliance hasn\u2019t yet reached the realm of control, which causes the true energy to leak from his body. On the other hand, the internal energy of Young Master Song is condensed and strong. So, in at most a stick of incense, Zuo Lengchan will lose.\u201dWhen Zuo Lengchan in the arena heard Jiumozhi\u2019s comment, he was shocked, thinking that in order to show off, he often deliberately let the icy energy leak out. This act attracted disciples and gained their admiration, but he knew that in the eyes of real masters, it was something lowly. Humiliated and angry, he forgot to control his breathing, and immediately felt his opponent\u2019s surging hot and ferocious inner strength.Everyone present in Mount Tai saw Zuo Lengchan squirting blood, retreating ten feet, and clenching his jaws. He was obviously seriously injured.Song Qingshu calmed down the disruption in his body and smiled faintly, \u201cWe won the first match.\u201d Then he turned and walked back.Seeing that Song Qingshu had won one match, Jiumozhi felt that till now the contest had been according to what was intended. He gave a long laugh and stood out from the crowd. He stood in the arena and looked around the crowd, \u201cA martial art master from the Qing Court, Tibetan Empire\u2019s Maha Cakra Vajra Kumozhi, greets the masters of the Central Plains, and I am here to ask for advice.\u201dThe expressions of everyone on the top of the Jade Emperor Peak changed, and for a while, they couldn\u2019t think of anyone who could defeat him. The Golden Serpent King, who was recognized as the highest martial artist, could be his match. However, everyone unanimously decided to let him hide and be a hidden card. Having lost one game, the candidate for this second match had become a problem.\u201cAmitabha Buddha! This one has been long heard that the Maha Cakra Vajra is proficient in the Seventy Two Forms of Shaolin. This Old Monk is not talented, but today I should experience it.\u201d Master Fang Zheng walked slowly into the arena after a Buddha\u2019s horn was heard.\u201cWhat a fine Vajra Zen Lion\u2019s Roar!\u201d Jiumozhi\u2019s eyes lit up, and he felt that in terms of pure internal strength, the other party did not seem to be beneath him.\u201cIt is rumored that Master Xuanbei of our temple was defeated in the hands of Your Excellency in Dali Heavenly Dragon Monastery. Dare I ask Maha Cakra Vajra, may I know if it is true?\u201d Abbot Fang Zheng raised his head, and stared scorchingly at Jiumozhi.Death of the opponent was a testament of his fame and skills, although it did not paint a good picture, that was actually one of the most triumphant battles of Jiumozhi\u2019s life. But considering the political influence, he kept it vague, \u201cIt is not uncommon for an opponent to have not learned properly and lose to this Poor Monk. As for how he later died, this Poor Monk does not know.\u201dHearing that he obviously did not deny it, the people in the scene couldn\u2019t help but feel a chill. Abbot Fang Zheng\u2019s eyes condensed and slowly said, \u201cOld Monk will use the Thousand Hands Buddha\u2019s Palm to test the so-called Seventy Two Forms of Shaolin.\u201dAfter speaking, he moved his palm lightly. This palm strike was an ordinary move, the middle of the palm suddenly swayed slightly, and immediately changed from one palm to two palms, two palms to four palms, four palms to eight palms, and eight palms to sixteen palms. Then it turned into thirty-two palms, and the palm strikes were unpredictable. With each palm strike, it had changed to several directions in the middle of the action. The palm strikes were extremely well executed.Jiumozhi admired this in his heart. It was such a complicated palm technique, but palm strength did not scatter at all. He really had practiced the Thousand Hands Buddha\u2019s Palm to the summit.After focusing his mind, he raised his hand, and put his right index finger and middle finger lightly together and twisted it. It took the shape of a flower, and he lightly shot three strikes at the opponent.Many disciples at the top of the mountain saw his three strikes, which were really ordinary and completely unable to compare with the momentum of Abbot Fang Zheng\u2019s Thousand Hands Buddha\u2019s Palm, and they cheered.However, the masters of the various factions and other masters realized that Jiumozhi\u2019s use was indeed the authentic Shaolin Temple\u2019s finger technique. In the blink of an eye, the palm prints in the sky in front of Abbot Fang Zheng collapsed after a little while, and the sound of cheers came to an abrupt end.\u201cThe Great Monk is really good at martial arts! Hahaha!\u201d Duo Long on the side was so relieved that he couldn\u2019t help but shout and cheered for him.Song Qingshu smiled as he looked at him, thinking that Duo Long was indeed a straightforward and enthusiastic man.Abbot Fang Zheng saw that his palm shadow was shattered, his expression condensed, and his palms moved outwards to complement the shattered palm shadow, but the momentum of advancement inevitably slowed down.Jiumozhi took the opportunity to attack, smashed his opponents palm strikes with his fingers, showing off his skill mastery. Pattra Finger, Great Wisdom Samadhi Finger, Animitta Kalpa Finger, Maha Finger\u2026a variety of Shaolin skills were emerging in an endless stream, and everyone in the scene was dazzled. Everyone had the same thought,\u00a0\u2018So mysterious, I thought that this monk was known to be proficient in Seventy Two Forms of Shaolin, and his reputation was indeed well-deserved.\u2019Master Fang Zheng studied the Yi Jin Jing carefully, and his internal strength had entered the state of transformation. Seeing his exquisite palm skills, everyone cheered secretly when he kept turning the danger into a blessing several times.After fighting for a while, Jiumozhi had figured out his opponent\u2019s condition, and knew that within ten strokes, the winner would\u00a0 be determined. Thinking of his own stunts just now was dazzling enough, he was about to make a rush to end the battle, suddenly his expression changed drastically, he quickly jumped out of the ring, and said to his opponent with severe expression, \u201cOld Master\u2019s Yi Jin Jing is really exquisite, and this Poor Monk admires this. It\u2019s a tie this time.\u201dEveryone in the scene did not expect this change. Just now Abbot Fang Zheng was obviously\u00a0 in the situation where he defended more and attacked less. It was clear that he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on for long. Unexpectedly, Jiumozhi suddenly just gave up.Abbot Fang Zheng was also bewildered. He was just about to ask, but Jiumozhi had turned and walked off the stage without saying a word. Thinking that this battle would determine the survival of the Mount Tai Sect, Fang Zheng sighed inwardly and acquiesced to this situation.Everyone in Mount Tai Sect applauded. The two strongest opponents had already competed, and this third match is likely to be won by their own side. It was also stated in the previous contest conditions that if there is a draw, the Mount Tai Sect would be considered to have won.Seeing the festive gesture on the other side, Duo Long asked Jiumozhi with a very puzzled expression, \u201cGreat Monk, why did you just now\u2026\u201dJiumozhi had a gloomy face, he said nothing, and ignored him.Song Qingshu thoughtfully said in a soft voice, \u201cThe Dharma seeks to survive the world, and martial arts lies in killing. The two run counter to each other. Seventy Two Forms of Shaolin, each of which can hurt and kill people, is fierce and cruel. Harmony means that every move must be resolved by the corresponding compassionate Dharma. If not, the hostility will penetrate into the viscera, becoming deeper and deeper. It would be a hundred times more powerful than any external poison\u2026\u201dIt turns out that this situation was very similar to that of Ren Woxing and Zuo Lengchan. When he thought about the end of Jiumozhi\u2019s madness in the original work, Song Qingshu could guess something.Hearing his words, Jiumozhi\u2019s eyes flashed with a fierce look first, and then turned into a daze. After all, he was a person of great accomplishments in Buddhism, and gradually he realized something.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the third match.\u201d Yuan Chengzhi walked out of the crowd slowly, looking at the three with a smile.Seeing the iconic Golden Serpent Sword on the opponent\u2019s back, Duo Long\u2019s face turned pale.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could he know that Jiumozhi would have an accident, and his own match would actually determine the success or failure of this mission!In the entire Qing Dynasty officialdom, if there was a person who made all officials frightened, it was the Golden Serpent King of Shandong.In the past few years, the high-ranking generals of the Qing army and the imperial court commanders who lost their lives under Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s Golden Serpent Sword were not just eighty or one hundred. In addition, they defeated the Qing army several times, resulting in the growing momentum of the Golden Serpent Camp in Shandong.The other two issues were naturally Wu Sangui, the opportunistic king of Pingxi in Shanhai Pass, and Prince Hongli, who boasted his own strength in Shengjing and coveted the throne.Duo Long thought in his heart that if it had nothing to do with the overall situation, it didn\u2019t matter if he admitted defeat. But now, it had become a big deal, and he couldn\u2019t be compared with his opponent. So, if he surrendered directly to Yuan Chengzhi, a major criminal, and returned to the capital, the Emperor would definitely not take that lightly. And his poor life would be over.He had the intention to fight but he knew that his martial arts was far from Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s equal, and that the opponent hated the Qing Court to the bone. This guy was notoriously cruel to the Qing officials.\u00a0\u2018I guess this poor life will have to be sacrificed for the Emperor\u2019\u00a0Duo Long was in a dilemma.At the moment, Jiumozhi was secretly adjusting the chaotic energy in his body, and had no time to pay attention to the matters in the contest. Song Qingshu sighed, knowing that today\u2019s matter was no longer in their favor, and turned around to persuade, \u201cChief, you can just admit defeat. After all, life is more important. I will explain it to the Emperor for you. After all, there was a reason for this matter. I was too careless before, and I didn\u2019t calculate the fight would come to this.\u201d\u201cHave you finished whispering over there, have you discussed it well? If you can\u2019t send someone up, then just give in. You can\u2019t just keep dragging, or should we wait forever?\u201d The Mount Tai Sect sent a Taoist priest to ask them sarcastically.Song Qingshu was angry, but knew that it was indeed their own fault, and he couldn\u2019t refute it. Seeing Duo Long\u2019s face turning blue and white, he knew that the man wanted to fight, but Song Qingshu, as a modern man, didn\u2019t regard his life as so worthless, and was about to admit defeat, \u201cWe admit defeat in the third match\u2026\u201dAt this time, a cold voice came from behind, \u201cThe third match will be handed over to this one.\u201dSong Qingshu turned his head in surprise, only to see a young man in red clothes, who looked like a woman, had appeared behind him.\u201cWho is this person?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but looking at his fragile appearance, he is definitely not the opponent of the Golden Serpent King.\u201d*****Hearing the doubts of the disciples, the heads of the various sects looked at each other. Even the most knowledgeable Master Fang Zheng could not recognize this handsome young man who suddenly appeared.It turns out that Dongfang Bubai has not come down from the Black Wood Cliff for decades. Naturally, few people in the wulin had seen his true face, and it was reasonable to not recognize him.Different from the others, Yuan Chengzhi had perfected internal and external martial arts, so he has a keen sense of danger. When Dongfang Bubai appeared, he had an overwhelming feeling in his whole body , and he had an ominous premonition in his heart.\u201cThe third one is obviously that officer, why are you changing it?\u201d After resting for so long, Zuo Lengchan was finally feeling better. He also faintly felt the danger of Dongfang Bubai, and did not want to change anything. So, he subconsciously wanted to stop him.Dongfang Bubai, didn\u2019t even bother to look at him. His expression didn\u2019t fluctuate at all. Song Qingshu gave a wry smile, and had no choice but to argue, \u201cWe never said who the third person was. Besides, did you not keep the dignified Golden Serpent King hidden in the dark as well?\u201dZuo Lengchan couldn\u2019t help but be speechless, so he hummed coldly, turned to sit down, and started to heal the internal injuries he suffered.Dongfang Bubai smiled faintly, and walked slowly onto the arena step by step.Yuan Chengzhi felt that every time the opponent took a step, his heart couldn\u2019t help but shake. When the opponent stepped onto the arena, he realized that his internal energy had been disturbed by the opponent\u2019s step. Under the horror, he subconsciously unsheathed the Golden Serpent Sword. Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s heart slowly calmed down when the unique and familiar touch of the Golden Serpent Sword came in his hand.Dongfang Bubai glanced at him with admiration and asked, \u201cYour Excellency is the Golden Serpent King who claims to be the number one martial artist in the Central Plains in recent years?\u201d\u201cThere is always a heaven above the heavens, as there are many experts in the world, and this title of number one in the Central Plains, Yuan dare not deserve it.\u201d Yuan Chengzhi replied, while guarding against any attacks. He didn\u2019t know why he was feeling like that. The other side clearly looked like a weak girl. But his instinct told him that the other party was extremely dangerous.\u201cYou don\u2019t dare to be?\u201d Dongfang Bubai sneered, \u201cLet me try your skills.\u201d As soon as his voice fell, the person appeared in front of Yuan Chengzhi, and a few silver needles pierced towards him.\u201cHuh?\u201d Dongfang Bubai whispered, he noticed a flash of golden light in front of him, and his opponent had already retreated from the original place.Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s temple was full of cold weat. Just now, he was completely on guard, but he didn\u2019t expect the opponent\u2019s speed to be as fast as lightning. He knew that if it weren\u2019t for the Gold-wire Vest Protector, he would have been restrained by the opponent with just one move, and he could have been seriously injured, or even dead!\u201cIt\u2019s a bit interesting, your response is good, and the swordsmanship is quite unique.\u201d Dongfang Bubai looked at the small opening in the sleeve of his opponent\u2019s Golden Serpent Sword, and said with a smile.All the masters at the peak were astonished. Among the flashing lights just now, none of them could see the movements of the man in red clothes.As for those as strong as Fang Zheng and others, they could barely see a red phantom. Song Qingshu\u2019s face was also a bit ugly. Although he had seen the battle between Dongfang Bubai and the Sunflower Elder before, he got a clear idea from this fight with Yuan Chengzhi. When Dongfang Bubai got serious, if you didn\u2019t have something to protect your body, you\u2019re dead.\u201cJust who is your excellency?\u201d Yuan Chengzhi was terrified, and became even more vigilant.Dongfang Bubai did not answer, a red light flashed past, and once again attacked Yuan Chengzhi.With the experience of the last time, Yuan Chengzhi was obviously not as unprepared as he was just now.The ever-changing movement was one of the best in the world. Yuan Chengzhi used it in the past to prevent his opponents from even touching the corners of his clothes. He did not expect that this time in front of this man in red, that would be like a child\u2019s play.Everyone in Mount Tai saw the golden light in the center of the arena. It turned out that Yuan Chengzhi had brought the Golden Serpent Swordplay to the extreme and protected the vitals around him.When the golden light flashed, the red figure suddenly flashed several feet away. Everyone saw a sneer on his lips, then turned into a red shadow to attack the golden light.Except for the two or three people on the top of the Jade Emperor Peak who could barely see their movements, everyone else could only see a group of golden lights dancing erratically in the arena, wandering around. And then, a red shadow, almost imperceptible, sometimes appeared above, sometimes appeared on the side of the golden light. The golden light was being attacked from all directions.Two groups of lights often split at the faintest of a touch, but with each contact, the golden light dimmed a bit. The expressions of the people who could see what was happening in the arena changed one after another.With the sound of clashing of steel, the two finally separated.Looking at Yuan Chengzhi, who was standing in the field with a red dot on the center of his eyebrows and gradually fading light in his eyes, Song Qingshu sighed in his heart,\u00a0\u2018Today Miss Youyou might become a new widow.\u2019\u00a0(Goblin: good for you mc!)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Had fun translating this too!)Seeing the faces of everyone from the Mount Tai Sect turn like a bereaved new widow, Song Qingshu quickly stepped forward and said, \u201cAccording to our previous agreement, we won three matches. So. this time you lose. According to the agreement, the Mount Tai Sect will accept the imperial edict.\u201dThe leader of Mount Tai Sect, Taoist Tianmen, looked dazed, and subconsciously murmured to himself, \u201cEven the Golden Serpent King is dead. Could it be that the Mount Tai Sect is really going to be destroyed in the hands of this Tianmen?\u201dSong Qingshu knew that the crowd on the mountain was excited now, and he didn\u2019t dare to continue to over-stimulate them. In case he was attacked by this group of opponents, Song Qingshu would have to escape. Although the opponent would not be able to catch him, it would damage his heroic image.\u201cTomorrow we will send an envoy to the mountain to announce the edict, and today we will say goodbye first.\u201d After Song Qingshu finished speaking, he greeted Jiumozhii and Duo Long and went straight down the mountain.*****\u201cWhat! That ruffian Yuan is dead?\u201d Hearing the situation on the mountain, Wei Xiaobao stood up with surprise, and he paced back and forth while thinking in his heart, \u2018Now that Yuan Chengzhi is dead, the Golden Serpent Camp has no leader and would be easy to defeat. If I, Wei Xiaobao, made such a remarkable achievement. What will Xiao Xuanzi reward me? The title of earl must be guaranteed, and it\u2019s not impossible to be awarded\u2026\u201d\u00a0(Goblin: Remember, Wei Xiaobao and Kangxi used these names to call each other.)After making up his mind, Wei Xiaobao stood up immediately, \u201cNotify the brothers of Qing Camp to prepare and set off immediately, and the target is the forces of that rebel stationed at the Golden Serpent Camp thirty miles away.\u201dWith a strange expression on his face, Duo Long suddenly stood up and said, \u201cThe emperor has a verbal order, and Wei Xiaobao please accept it.\u201d\u201cThe fu*k, what tricks did Xiao Xuanzi play now?\u201d Wei Xiaobao couldn\u2019t help being surprised, and quickly knelt down to take the edict.\u201cListen, Xiao Guizi, once Dongfang Bubai appears, you will immediately roll back to me with the QIng camp soldiers and officials. No other ideas are allowed. If you are greedy for meritorious service, I will have you guard the Ninggu Pagoda.\u201d As he spoke Emperor Kangxi\u2019s secret oral statement, Duo Long couldn\u2019t help but twitch.Wei Xiaobao disagreed in his heart. He felt that it would be a shame not to take advantage of this kind of god-given opportunity, and he said, \u201cThat plan is merely a plan. But this is reality\u2026pity, we\u2026\u201dSong Qingshu stopped him and said, \u201cBrother Wei, after listening to the Emperor\u2019s edict, he seems to have anticipated today\u2019s situation a long time ago, and the wording in the edict is so harsh, Brother Wei should not take personal risks.\u201dWei Xiaobao was shocked, thinking that Xiao Xuanzi has always been unpredictable, smarter than Zhuge Liang, and his belly was really black. Fortunately he realized that early.\u201cThank you Brother Song for the reminder.\u201d Wei Xiaobao was just in a momentary haze, and soon woke up, \u201cNotify the brothers from Camp, we will leave for the Capital immediately.\u201d*****Three days later, in the Imperial Study Room in the Forbidden City of Yanjing.\u201cEmperor, this time this official did not fail in his duties, and completely suppressed the wulin in the Qing Dynasty, and all the sects are now subservient to the court.\u201d When Wei Xiaobao saw Emperor Kangxi, he quickly tried to show off his merits.\u201cOkay, okay, We know you have worked hard.\u201d Emperor Kangxi replied lightly, and continued to look at his memorial.Wei Xiaobao was startled, thinking that in situations like these, Xiao Xuanzi should have praised me. He probably didn\u2019t say it clearly enough, and he hurriedly salivated and said, \u201cHonored Emperor, this time we also killed that ruffian Yuan Chengzhi.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Emperor Kangxi\u2019s expression moved, and finally put down the memorial, looked up at Wei Xiaobao, and said with a smile but not a smile, \u201cIt is clear that We sent Master Dongfang to hide in the shadows and killed Yuan Chengzhi. How are you taking credit for it?\u201d\u201cOh how horrible! I took the credit belonging to Xiao Xuanzi.\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s heart shook. Fortunately, he had always been clever and flexible. He immediately gave a thumbs up, \u201cThe Emperor is really enigmatic. So it was all in your plan to send Master Dongfang to help secretly.\u201d\u201cXiaobao, did you really think We wanted to suppress the wulin?\u201d Emperor Kangxi\u2019s tone could not hide his smugness.\u201cCould it be\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao looked confused, Song Qingshu was also thinking in his heart, and looked at\u00a0 Emperor Kangxi in surprise.\u201cYes, how can we put mere ruffians from wulin in my eyes? Our goal has always been Yuan Chengzhi and his Golden Serpent Camp. The reason why We dared to risk antagonizing the wulin and sent you out with a lot of fanfare to suppress them was all part of the plan. If we make any advances to the territory of Shandong, all sects in Shandong will definitely ask Yuan Chengzhi for help.\u201d A strange light flashed in Emperor Kangxi\u2019s eyes, and he continued, \u201cWe sent Master Dongfang to hide in the dark. Once Yuan Chengzhi is drawn out of his base camp, he would look for opportunities to attack. Only by killing him can We get rid of a big trouble in Our heart.\u201d\u201cThis time this official\u2019s admiration for the Emperor is really like a surging river, uninterrupted, and like the Yellow River flooding everything in its path,\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s exaggerated expression of surprise made Emperor Kangxi feel very good. \u201cSo that mission in several other provinces is purely to confuse that stupid Yuan?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Emperor Kangxi nodded, \u201cIf We sent you directly to Shandong, it would definitely arouse Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s suspicion. He might not be so easily fooled. However, when he sees you purging other provinces and sects, he would really think that We want to suppress the wulin, hahahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cMay know why the Emperor specially ordered us to not pursue the victory momentum and destroy the Golden Serpent Camp?\u201d Song Qingshu asked a question that had been puzzling him. Although he was more willing to see this situation, this move from Emperor Kangxi must have a deep meaning. It was better to be prepared.\u201cAccording to the spy\u2019s report, the leaders of the Golden Serpent Camp have been ill-intentioned in the past year. Had it not been suppressed by Yuan Chengzhi\u2019s prestige, We are afraid they would have fallen into infighting. Now that Yuan Chengzhi is dead, they will have a bloody battle in order to be the next leader. If we attack them at this time, it may force them to hug each other and put down their prejudices. That would be a mistake.\u201d Emperor Kangxi glanced at Song Qingshu and smiled faintly.\u201cThe Emperor is really clever, so we will wait until they bite each other like dogs and suffer heavy casualties, and then be the fisherman\u2026\u201d Wei Xiaobao\u2019s oily words again came to his ears, but Song Qingshu felt that a layer of cold sweat was oozing down his back.\u201cI used to think I was familiar with the plot of the story, but when I traveled through the world, I naturally regarded the characters in this world as a kind of intelligent NPC. Now I know that there are actually many talented people in this world. I will pay the price if I\u2019m careless.\u201dGoblin: Sorry for the delay. I was busy with some real life matters.For this novel and the author, this chapter is a turning point and also an indication of his talent as a storyteller. What kind of novel is this? You should be able to guess from the intelligence the Emperor showed in this chapter. There will be a lot of similar antagonists, opponents, side characters in the novel in the future. So, look forward to an enjoyable read!And, as always, a Trillion thanks to all who are supporting me! I really appreciate it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kangxi was stunned for a moment. He wondered if he had offended the monk in any way.Jiumozhi put his hands together and replied respectfully, \u201cReplying to the Emperor, this poor monk is not concerned about temporary honor and disgrace. It\u2019s just that something has gone wrong with this poor monk\u2019s martial arts, and I have doubts. I need to go back to Tubo and ask for guidance from the seniors of Ningma Temple. Your Majesty, please forgive me.\u201dSong Qingshu also said, \u201cYour Majesty, I also know a little about the Great Monk\u2019s situation, and what he said is indeed true.\u201d\u201cSince this is the case, then We shall not embarrass the Great Monk. Later, We shall order someone to write an alliance letter, and the Great Monk will bring it back to the Tubo Empire, so as to create a good relationship between the two countries.\u201d Emperor Kangxi thought for a moment and quickly reacted.\u201cTo be able to form an alliance with the Qing Dynasty is indeed a great blessing for me in Tubo.\u201d Jiumozhi\u2019s face showed his delight. Although this trip to the Central Plains was not a success, he formed an alliance with the Qing Dynasty and prepared to return with satisfaction.\u201cI have heard for a long time that the senior monk Padmasambhava of Ningma Temple has been in seclusion for decades, and his cultivation is close to the realm of the divine. I also hope that the Great Monk will send a message for this seat. After this seat is free, I will definitely go to Ningma Temple to learn about the Great Master\u2019s peerless skills.\u201d Dongfang Bubai, who was sitting at the top seat, put down his wine cup and said lightly.Thinking that this guy killed Yuan Chengzhi who was only slightly inferior to him while talking and laughing on the top of the Jade Emperor Peak, Jiumozhi couldn\u2019t help but solemnly say, \u201cNingma Temple will do its best to welcome the Leader Dongfang.\u201dDongfang Bubai nodded, ignored him, and poured himself some more drink.Seeing his aloof style, Song Qingshu\u2019s heart jumped,\u00a0\u2018This fuc*ker\u2019s martial arts skills are so high, and he even looks like a beauty. If he lived in modern times, he\u2019d probably make those star-chasing girls crazy.\u2019*****For the next few days, Song Qingshu was almost bored to death in the palace. It turned out that the day after the banquet, Jiumozhi left for Tibet, and Wei Xiaobao was also anxious to go home to hug his wife. Dongfang Bubai\u2019s whereabouts were mysterious, and he didn\u2019t know where that guy was. There was only Song Qingshu, a first-class guard, who had to stay there in the palace.\u201cFortunately, Emperor Kangxi has others from the wulin to protect him. I don\u2019t need to be called for meager things. Otherwise, I might have to patrol in circles in the palace everyday. Thinking about it, I would lose the face of all the transmigrators in existence.\u201d Song Qingshu muttered to himself.According to Emperor Kangxi\u2019s words, he usually has nothing fixed to do, and he will naturally be notified when he is needed.\u201cHey, it\u2019s not bad at all, this feeling is really uncomfortable.\u201d Song Qingshu opened the window and stared at the stars in the sky in a daze.\u201cThere are assassins!\u201d A guard\u2019s cry came from a distance, if it wasn\u2019t for Song Qingshu\u2019s deep internal energy, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to hear it.\u201cWhy is the assassin so stupid, and went to the unpopulated place in the Cining Palace Garden?\u201d Song Qingshu said sympathetically, but thinking that he was bored anyway, he turned over and jumped out of the window to look for the sound.It didn\u2019t take long for him to hear the sound of swords intersecting. Song Qingshu shook his head and smiled. Although there were no real masters among the Manchu guards, all of them were skilled in martial arts. If they were surrounded by them, the assassin might not be able to escape.When passing the corridor and seeing the situation in the field clearly, Song Qingshu\u2019s expression changed slightly.The man in black who was besieged by the big inner palace guards, although wrapped in black scarves, but the graceful curves of the figure clearly told everyone that she was a woman.But that was not the point, what made Song Qingshu change his face was the golden serpent shaped sword in the opponent\u2019s hand.\u201cGolden Serpent Sword?\u201d Song Qingshu was startled, thinking that Yuan Chengzhi was dead, and the other party was a woman, how could he still not understand the identity of the assassin.Song Qingshu really admired Xia Qingqing in his heart. When she learned that her husband died at the hands of the Qing court, she, a woman, broke into the heavily guarded Forbidden City of the Qing Dynasty alone.However, with her martial arts, the assassination of Emperor Kangxi was destined to be akin to a bamboo basket to draw water, and now it seemed that it was difficult to say whether she could even save her own life.For a moment Song Qingshu was having mixed feelings. Xia Qingqing in the scene was already in grave danger, and with a low humming she used the sword in her hand.Knowing that he couldn\u2019t wait any longer, Song Qingshu flipped his wrist, used the strength of \u201cThe Twin Dragons Fetch Water\u201d, and aimed at Xia Qingqing, who was in danger, and pulled back with all his strength.Xia Qingqing was dealing with the long swords slashing from all directions, and suddenly felt a strong force coming, as if her body was pulled into the darkness in the distance by an invisible force.After the initial panic, Xia Qingqing calmed down instead, knowing that she would definitely die if she stayed here, but now she was being sucked into the unknown, which added a glimmer of hope.Although she already had the intention of dying in her heart, she had not yet avenged her husband, and she was not willing to die at the hands of a group of guards.It was the first time that Song Qingshu had moved a living person from such a distance. In order to prevent the lack of strength, he used the maximum power from the very beginning.As a result, when Xia Qingqing landed in front of him, due to inertia, a pair of hands did not hold back and pressed directly on her chest.Xia Qingqing was swaying in the air, and as soon as she landed, she felt a pair of big hands firmly grasping on her chest, and she was instantly ashamed and angry, and slashed at those hands with her sword, \u201cYou pervert, die! \u201c\u201cIt\u2019s really not intentional.\u201d Song Qingshu hurriedly jumped away, waving his hands and looking embarrassed, he secretly added a sentence, \u201cIt\u2019s so supple and soft. How superb!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Xia Qingqing was startled when she saw Song Qingshu\u2019s appearance.\u201cThis is not the place to talk, come with me!\u201d Seeing the guards coming from a distance, Song Qingshu hugged Xia Qingqing and ran away.With her slender waist in his arms, Xia Qingqing\u2019s eyebrows twitched, and she wanted to attack several times, but she was afraid of the chasing soldiers behind her, so she forcibly endured it.Holding a person, Song Qingshu\u2019s figure did not show any signs of sluggishness. Often, his toes would slip out a few meters without a sound, and the chasing soldiers soon lost their traces.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect your movement technique to be so good.\u201d When Song Qingshu got rid of the pursuers and brought Xia Qingqing back to his residence to stop, Xia Qingqing quietly left his embrace, took off the black scarf on her face, and softly spoke.\u201cIt\u2019s only so-so.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled.\u201cBrother Yuan\u2019s movement technique was probably not as good as you.\u201d Thinking of her deceased husband, Xia Qingqing felt sore in her heart, and her pair of starry eyes was faintly filled with mist.\u201cHey, Madame Yuan, please forgive me.\u201d Song Qingshu didn\u2019t know how to comfort her for a while.As if being reminded, Xia Qingqing suddenly raised her head and stared at Song Qingshu viciously, \u201cWere you also present on Mount Tai that day?\u201d\u201cYes I was\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu nodded bitterly, it meant that he was also one of the accomplices in killing her husband, and he was one of the three masters sent by the imperial court, even if he wanted to deny it, he couldn\u2019t deny it.\u201cThen die!\u201d With a coquettish scolding, Xia Qingqing stabbed at Song Qingshu\u2019s chest.As soon as the words came out, Song Qingshu was already on guard. Xia Qingqing shot out in anger. There were many flaws in her attack, and Song Qingshu casually hit the acupuncture point under her arm all of a sudden.Just as he was about to speak, he suddenly heard footsteps of the guards not far away, Song Qingshu\u2019s expression changed, and his hands immediately reached towards Xia Qingqing\u2019s neckline.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Xia Qingqing\u2019s tone was full of panic.Song Qingshu said with a wry smile while unbuttoning her clothes: \u201cMiss Youyou, if I said I just want to borrow your clothes, would you believe it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now, why do you have to react so much?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention that!\u201d Thinking of the tenderness and caressing between the two that night, Xia Qingqing felt extremely angry.\u201cI won\u2019t mention it if you don\u2019t mention it.\u201d Song Qingshu sighed, and the beautiful woman in front of him was now left with a white inner garment, standing there prettily.Feeling that Song Qingshu was carrying her to the bed, Xia Qingqing was so frightened that her face turned pale, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be this kind of person!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think I killed your husband? If that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019ll just\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu glanced at her strangely, and Xia Qingqing\u2019s body shrank subconsciously, \u201cHehe, I\u2019ll just have some fun. Isn\u2019t it a great joy in life to kill the husband and dominate his wife?\u201dHe thought that the other party would be so frightened that she would cry out \u201cDie!\u201d again, but when he heard something else entirely. Xia Qingqing smiled sweetly, \u201cI know you won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s act of a despicable villain came to an abrupt end as the other party looked like she knew that he was a good person.But how could he know that behind Xia Qingqing\u2019s smile was a cold heart? She thought in her heart,\u00a0\u2018I have to softly coax him first, and when my acupoints are unlocked, I must\u2026\u2019\u201cLook, I didn\u2019t lie to you, I just borrowed your clothes.\u201d After Song Qingshu put her on the bed, he turned around and put on the night clothes he took off himself.\u201cHuh?\u201d Xia Qingqing looked at him suspiciously, wondering what he wanted to do?\u201cYour clothes are a little tight,\u201d Song Qingshu said with a frown, \u201cBy the way, I almost missed something.\u201dWhen Xia Qingqing saw him turn around and take out two apples on the table, then tucked them into his chest, put his hands together, and said with satisfaction, \u201cWell, the size is just right, this is more like a woman.\u201dGradually understanding his plan, seeing his funny appearance, Xia Qingqing couldn\u2019t help but chuckle, and her stagnant mood for many days finally eased.\u201cI\u2019ll have to borrow the Golden Snake Sword.\u201d After covering his face, Song Qingshu carried her Golden Serpent Sword behind his back, \u201cI make the inner guards believe that you have left the palace, or they will find you here sooner or later.\u201d When he was done, he jumped out of the window and ran to the place where the guards were noisy.A group of inner palace guards were intensively searching for the female assassin. Then they suddenly saw a black shadow flashing past, the other party had a curvy body, and the Golden Serpent Sword on her back. Recognizing such obvious features, they almost shouted in unison, \u201cIt\u2019s that girl. Assassin, come and catch her for me! Catch her\u2026\u201d Duolong shouted, and quickly led a group of guards to chase after the assassin.With Song Qingshu\u2019s movement technique, these guards couldn\u2019t catch up with him at all, but he slowed down his speed intentionally in order to let the inner guards witness the \u2018assassin\u2019 escape from the palace.Song Qingshu touched the ground with the tip of his toes, and his figure crossed several meters. He was flying leisurely like a kite. Suddenly, his face changed greatly, he stopped, and he vigilantly looked at the red-clothed man in front of him, and broke out in cold sweat.\u201cToday is so lively in the palace, I came out curiously to see who this master is, I didn\u2019t expect such a coincidence.\u201d Dongfang Invincible looked at Song Qingshu with a smile.Song Qingshu almost ripped off the black scarf from his face and screamed \u201cDa Fu*k!\u201d, but thinking that if Emperor Kangxi knew that he was hiding an assassin, all his previous efforts and plans would be in vain, so he had to bite the bullet and snorted coldly.\u201cA woman with such an ugly voice will definitely not look good,\u201d Dongfang Bubai frowned in disgust, \u201cLet this seat clean up the environment.\u201d As soon as the voice fell, his figure disappeared from the place he was standing.Having seen Dongfang Bubai fight several times, Song Qingshu has long been prepared. Seeing him disappear, he hastily kicked the ground and moved to a distance of more than ten meters. With the Golden Serpent Sword on his back, he pulled it out from the scabbard, and remained vigilant. It was important to be on guard.\u201cHuh?\u201d Dongfang Bubai suddenly rushed into the empty air, and couldn\u2019t help but look at him with interest, \u201cThis little lady is quite skillful\u2026 You are holding the Golden Serpent Sword. Could it be that you are the wife of Yuan Chengzhi?\u201dSeeing him tease and flirt, Song Qingshu felt a chill all over his body. Thinking of Yang Lianting, Dongfang Bubai\u2019s favorite male pet, he suddenly felt chill on his backside, and he quickly picked up speed and ran out of the palace. (Goblin: Yang Lianting was the lover of Dongfang Bubai in the original novel. And, yes he is a guy as well. Think BL.)Dongfang Bubai laughed for a while, \u201cInteresting, interesting, this seat is short of a concubine. I haven\u2019t tried the taste of a widow before. This time, no one can save you even if you cry out, hahaha\u2026\u201d After saying that a red shadow flashed, he quickly chased after Song Qingshu\u2019s back.The more he said this, the more scared Song Qingshu became, and the faster he ran.Running all the way, Song Qingshu only felt remorse,\u00a0\u2018Retribution, it\u2019s all retribution! Just after molesting Xia Qingqing, will I lose my dignity as a man?.\u2019\u201cLittle lady, you\u2019re running quite fast.\u201d Dongfang Bubai followed, and was secretly surprised.\u00a0\u2018This woman\u2019s movement technique is probably not under that old eunuch from last time, and her maneuvering and dodging may be far inferior to that of Sunflower Ancestor. But purely in a straight line sprint, if I am not careful, even I can\u2019t catch up.\u2019When he found that he couldn\u2019t shake Dongfang Bubai despite his best efforts, Song Qingshu decided to stop and fight, because he knew that the opponent\u2019s internal strength must be richer than his own. He had to think of a way to escape alive.\u201cNow look here, why didn\u2019t the little lady run away?\u201d Seeing her stop, Dongfang Bubai also stood leisurely on a roof, looking at him with a smile.Song Qingshu didn\u2019t answer either, he crossed the sword in front of him, and his spirit entered the realm of one with the sword.\u201cYour husband was no match for me, little lady, why are you doing this?\u201d Dongfang Bubai smiled and shot over.Song Qingshu\u2019s inner strength was shocked, and the Golden Serpent Sword flew out at the opponent, and he waved his palms to greet him at the same time.Dongfang Bubai smiled, twisted his waist lightly, and avoided the flying Golden Serpent Sword, and in the blink of an eye, he and the opponent exchanged more than ten moves.Just as he was about to praise the opponent\u2019s martial arts skills, Dongfang Bubai\u2019s ears moved, and he quickly disappeared in place, dodging the reflection of the Golden Serpent Sword.Dongfang Bubai stood a few feet away, watching the Golden Serpent Sword wandering three feet away from the opponent\u2019s body, and erratically protecting the opponent\u2019s whole body, he couldn\u2019t help but look solemn, \u201cThe legendary Flying Sword?\u201dThe last time when the Wooden Sword was separated from his body, and Hong Antong was injured with that sword strike, that made Song Qingshu realize a lot. Later, in the dead of night, he carefully thought about the method of Flying Sword. In the end, it really made him figure out how to control the flying sword by combining it with the same strength as the Dragon Capturing Hand. At the same time, he would be able to use both of his palms to execute those exquisite palm techniques to fight the enemy. Of course, the cooperation between the palm and the sword was still very obscure, but facing Dongfang Bubai, he had to use his best efforts.\u201cLittle lady, I didn\u2019t expect your martial arts skills to be higher than your husband\u2019s. Now this seat is even more interested in you.\u201d Dongfang Bubai\u2019s eyes were full of strange brilliance as he stared at Song Qingshu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t worry, I was just joking with you just now.\u201dSong Qingshu glanced at him strangely, wondering why Dongfang Bubai was suddenly so talkative, and he was so greedy for his \u2018beauty\u2019, does he still have that ability?\u201cSince you don\u2019t speak, little lady, then this seat will tear off that scarf on your face and see if you are beautiful or ugly.\u201d As soon as Dongfang Bubai\u2019s voice fell, a silver needle slipped between his two fingers and he flicked it lightly.With a ding, Song Qingshu only felt a strong force coming from the Golden Serpent Sword, and he almost couldn\u2019t control it. However, the Golden Serpent Sword was still swayed by the silver needle of the opponent, and Dongfang Bubai took the opportunity to approach Song Qingshu within three feet.Song Qingshu hurriedly used the Golden Top Cotton Palm and the Nine Yin White Bone Claw of the Emei Sect, pushing it left and right.Dongfang Bubai downplayed his own skills and praised, \u201cYou have played the two ordinary martial arts of the Emei Sect so spontaneously, little lady, your martial arts cultivation is really good.\u201dSong Qingshu frowned tightly, the opponent was taking this fight like a joke. He was already stretched out with only the Golden Top Cotton Palm and the Nine Yin White Bone Claw, but he did not have the slightest idea of using the more powerful Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms and other advanced martial arts. He planned to use all women\u2019s techniques to fight.If it wasn\u2019t for Dongfang Bubai trying to lift the scarf on his face, Song Qingshu would have died many times.After figuring out the opponent\u2019s thoughts, Song Qingshu completely gave up defending the rest of his body and guarded his face wholeheartedly.After more than twenty moves, Dongfang Bubai became more and more aggrieved. The opponent actually guarded the scarf tightly, and he failed several times. \u201cAh, if you fight like this again, I can touch the rest of the place as much as I like.\u201dSong Qingshu felt a chill, but thinking of the chance of survival he had been planning, he had to endure his nausea and wait for it.\u201cYou won\u2019t defend the rest of the place?\u201d Dongfang Bubai sneered, \u201cDo you really think this seat dare not touch it?\u201dAs soon as the words fell, Song Qingshu only felt that his butt was slapped, and his heart jumped, but he still continued to guard his face.\u201cHow ugly are you so that you can\u2019t let this seat see your face?\u201d Seeing that even when he touched the other party\u2019s buttocks, the she was still unmoved, so Dongfang Bubai couldn\u2019t help but feel a little angry, and thought that,\u00a0\u2018If you are a woman, even if you let me touch it buttocks,\u00a0 you will never let me touch your chest, right?\u2019After making up his mind, Dongfang Bubai\u2019s movements changed, and his hands directly attacked the opponent\u2019s chest, thinking that waiting for the gap created by her reaching out to block, he would definitely be able to tear off her veil and see the true face of this woman.Song Qingshu saw his move, but there was a hint of joy in his eyes. Not only did he not dodge, but he presented his chest.\u201cCrrrssht!\u201d With a crisp sound, Dongfang Bubai only felt the juices flow from his hands, and he was dumbfounded. He muttered to himself in disbelief, \u201cWith a squeeze\u2026 it burst?\u201dWhat Song Qingshu had been waiting for was Dongfang Bubai\u2019s stunned moment, how could he miss such a good opportunity, he quickly used the Proud Dragon Repents and hit Dongfang Bubai\u2019s chest.Dongfang Bubai\u2019s blood spurted wildly, and he quickly retreated backwards.Song Qingshu hit the opponent\u2019s chest with both palms. However, he felt that the place where he hit was extremely soft. He couldn\u2019t help but be stunned for a moment. At that moment his lower abdomen was immediately hit by the opponent\u2019s counterattack. He quickly pressed the injury, took the opportunity to use the Traceless Sand Treading Steps, and desperately fled to the distance.Looking at his opponent disappearing into the dark night, Dongfang Bubai only stood there, not knowing whether it was because of the injury or what, a red flush appeared on his face, \u201cStinky boy, don\u2019t let me know who you are, or I will cut you to pieces.\u201dSong Qingshu ran for a long time, and after realizing that Dongfang Bubai had been thrown off, he hurriedly ran to the palace again.After the assassination incident last night, the guards in the Forbidden City were extremely tight. Song Qingshu escaped dozens of patrolling guards along the way and finally returned to his room.As soon as the door was opened, a dagger with a cold light was placed on his neck, and Song Qingshu\u2019s heart suddenly fell to the bottom.\u201cSong Qingshu, I\u2019m going to kill you to get revenge for Big Brother Yuan\u2026\u201d Before Xia Qingqing finished speaking, Song Qingshu had already sprayed a mouthful of blood on her clothes and fainted.\u201cHey, what tricks are you playing?\u201d Seeing the other party fell limply on top of her, Xia Qingqing was startled, and quickly pushed him away.Seeing Song Qingshu falling straight to the ground, Xia Qingqing frowned, squatted down, and when she checked his pulse, he felt extremely weak, then she stretched her fingers under the tip of his nose to check his breathing.Xia Qingqing stood up and looked at Song Qingshu, who was dying on the ground. With a look of struggle on her face, she gritted her teeth and said, \u201cSince you are dying, our revenge will be written off, and you can fend for yourself.\u201dIt turned out that Song Qingshu and Dongfang Bubai were chasing each other all the way, and in the final battle, it was almost dawn when he came back. Song Qingshu just wanted to distract the guards, but she didn\u2019t expect it would take so long.\u00a0 The pressure on her acupuncture points was very light, so it was easy to break free. After putting on his clothes, she stayed in ambush in the house, waiting to give Song Qingshu an unexpected blow.Knowing that it might not be so easy to escape from the palace after dawn, Xia Qingqing retrieved the Golden Serpent Sword from Song Qingshu, pushed open the door, and disappeared outside the house.After half a stick of incense, Xia Qingqing left and returned. Looking at Song Qingshu who was still motionless, her face changed, and finally she stomped angrily, clenching her silvery teeth she muttered, \u201cI really owed you in my last life.\u201dAfter she finished speaking, she bent down and helped Song Qingshu onto the bed, took out a pill from her arms and fed it to his mouth, transporting her true qi into his body to help him digest the medicinal power.An hour later, Xia Qingqing was tired with a thin sweat on her forehead. She jumped out of bed, as if trying to convince herself, she said to herself, \u201cYou saved me once last night and bandaged my wound, so I will pay it back. Just this one time.\u201dIt was unknown how long it took, Xia Qingqing, who was lying on the table and fell asleep, suddenly heard a moan. She woke up, and quickly looked back to the bed, only to see Song Qingshu murmuring, \u201cWater\u2026water\u2026\u201dXia Qingqing subconsciously poured a glass of water, sat down in front of the bed, and slowly fed him.\u2018Ehh!?\u2019\u00a0She suddenly reacted,\u00a0\u2018Why am I serving him like this?\u2019\u00a0Her expression quickly changed, she changed her previous gentle movements, and directly poured a glass of water into Song Qingshu\u2019s mouth.\u201cCough\u2026cough!\u201d Song Qingshu woke up suddenly, seeing Xia Qingqing beside the bed, a helpless smile appeared on his lips, \u201cYouyou, I didn\u2019t expect you to save me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t want to take advantage when a person is in danger. When you are healed, I will kill you.\u201d Xia Qingqing snorted coldly.\u201cIt\u2019s not me who competed with Master Yuan, why do you want to kill me?\u201d Song Qingshu felt extremely wronged.\u201cI don\u2019t care, you are one of the accomplices anyway.\u201d Thinking of Yuan Chengzhi, Xia Qingqing\u2019s nose turned sour.\u201cUh, that\u2019s fine, but with the friendship between the two of us, can you kill me in the end?\u201d Song Qingshu looked at her with a joking smile.\u201cWhat kind of friendship do I have with you!\u201d Xia Qingqing said angrily, but after thinking for a while, she said hesitantly, \u201cIf you can help me take revenge, I might consider not killing you.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you don\u2019t have friendship with me, why should I help you?\u201d Song Qingshu rolled his eyes and said with a smile, \u201cUnless you promise to give yourself to me.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Xia Qingqing was frightened and angry, and was about to pull out the Golden Serpent Sword, when she became thoughtful, her face seemed like the first melting of ice and snow, and she said softly, \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Now it was Song Qingshu\u2019s turn to be surprised.\u201cOf course it\u2019s true. If you can help me successfully get my revenge, I will naturally\u2026 naturally be willing to be your slave or maid.\u201d Xia Qingqing looked fine, but she had already made up her mind. Once her revenge was taken, she would kill herself and follow her Big Brother Yuan.Song Qingshu stared straight at her as if to understand her, and suddenly smiled calmly, \u201cMadame Yuan is willing to make such a big sacrifice to avenge her husband, and this Song admires that so much. Although I don\u2019t know what your idea is, but If you want to take revenge, I can help you.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Xia Qingqing looked at him in surprise, and subconsciously ran over to grab his arm and asked.\u201cOf course it\u2019s true, but if you don\u2019t stop shaking me, I\u2019m afraid your only helper is about to kick the bucket.\u201d Hearing Song Qingshu\u2019s words, Xia Qingqing stuck out her tongue in embarrassment and let go of his arm.\u201cIf you want to take revenge, you must first know who your enemy is. Have you really figured out who your enemy is?\u201d Song Qingshu asked.\u201cThat Dog Emperor Kangxi and Dongfang Bubai!\u201d Xia Qingqing said through her gritted teeth. After the battle of Jade Emperor Peak, someone finally found out the true identity of the young man who looked like a woman.\u201cAm I not your enemy?\u201d Song Qingshu looked at her with a smile.\u201cNaturally not.\u201d Xia Qingqing replied embarrassedly with a rare blush.\u201cOkay, what do you think of my martial arts?\u201d Song Qingshu said.Xia Qingqing pondered for a while, and the scene where he showed his martial arts several times appeared in her mind, and finally said, \u201cIt\u2019s very high, it should not be under Big Brother Yuan.\u201d\u201cThen do you know who I was injured so badly and by whom?\u201d Song Qingshu said with a wry smile.\u201cHow do I know? Were you not trying to attract the inner palace guards\u2026\u201d Xia Qingqing suddenly reacted and said with a livid face, \u201cCould it be that Dongfang Bubai?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Song Qingshu sighed, \u201cI was unlucky tonight, and I happened to meet him. If it wasn\u2019t for my cleverness, I\u2019m afraid you would never see me again.\u201d\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for saving me, you wouldn\u2019t have encountered such a danger.\u201d Xia Qingqing\u2019s heart softened, and her eyes softened suddenly.\u201cAnyway, sooner or later, I will have to fight him. Thanks to you today, I not only saw the power of his full-strength attack, but also escaped with my life by luck. It\u2019s not a bad thing at all.\u201d Thinking of the scene of the two fighting, Song Qingshu nodded thoughtfully.\u201cIt seems that your martial arts are higher than that of Big Brother Yuan,\u201d Xia Qingqing said with a miserable expression, \u201cIf Big Brother Yuan was so good at movement techniques and martial arts, he could\u2019ve escaped with his life.\u201dSong Qingshu shook his head and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not the same. Master Yuan was deliberately schemed against and was unprepared, but I have seen Dongfang\u2019s Bubai\u2019s martial arts a long time ago.\u201d\u201cBrother Song, that bastar*d Dongfang\u2019s martial arts is so high, will I ever be able to get revenge in my life?\u201d Xia Qingqing\u2019s eyes were a little lost.\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d Song Qingshu showed a confident smile.Xia Qingqing was about to ask, when a voice came from far outside, \u201cToday the palace is very lively, this Dongfang can\u2019t sleep at night, I want to have a drink with Young Master Song, I wonder if Young Master Song will give me face?\u201dThe expressions of the two people in the room changed greatly, Xia Qingqing gritted her teeth, pulled out the Golden Serpent Sword, and wanted to rush out to fight Dongfang Bubai, but Song Qingshu tightly held her back, \u201cYou will only die if you go out like this, trust me, I have a way to save us.\u201dXia Qingqing was startled, struggled for a long time in her heart, and finally put the sword into the sheath, gritted her teeth and said, \u201cOkay, I will trust you once!\u201d Suddenly she looked at him suspiciously, \u201cHe came to you so late, are you two good friends? ?\u201dSong Qingshu said solemnly, \u201cI am afraid that some of my martial art techniques were revealed during the fight just now. It made Dongfang Bubai suspect me, and now if he sees how seriously injured I am, I am afraid that I will die today.\u201d\u201cBrother Song, should I hide for a while, otherwise if he sees one more person in your room, and then connects it with the assassin in the palace tonight, I am afraid that Brother Song, you are more likely to be exposed.\u201d Xia Qingqing also said anxiously.\u201cOne more person?\u201d A flash of light flashed in Song Qingshu\u2019s mind, and he seemed to have grasped something vaguely in his heart.\u201cNo need, even if you hide, it\u2019s useless. With Dongfang Bubai\u2019s martial arts, no matter how well you hide in the room, you can\u2019t hide from his eyes and ears.\u201d Song Qingshu suddenly turned his head and an inexplicable look flashed in his eyes. Then he looked at Xia Qingqing and asked, \u201cYouyou, do you trust me?\u201dIn Dongfang Bubai\u2019s memory, he had not been injured for more than ten years since the beginning of his martial career. He didn\u2019t expect to suffer at the hands of a stinky boy tonight, and also his chest was\u2026Thinking of this, a trace of frost appeared on Dongfang Bubai\u2019s face. He looked at Song Qingshu\u2019s room, and walked straight over.It turned out that Dongfang Bubai had realized that the assassin\u2019s last palm strike that seriously injured him was the unique skill of the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms, \u201cThe Proud Dragon Repents\u201d. In today\u2019s world, only Xiao Feng from Liao State and Guo Jing from Xiangyang have mastery of this technique.Although Dongfang Bubai has not appeared in the wulin for many years, he had heard a lot about the two of them. One was arrogant and the other was upright. It was impossible for them to do the dishonorable act of an assassination. Thinking back at his putting two apples on his chest and posing as a woman, Dongfang Bubai\u2019s lips couldn\u2019t help twitching.Having previously competed with Song Qingshu in the imperial study, and witnessed him and Zuo Lengchan fight on the top of the Jade Emperor Peak, Dongfang Bubai knew that Song Qingshu\u2019s Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms were extraordinary, and immediately suspected him.Thinking that the other party seemed to be a schemer, Dongfang Bubai decided to take care of his injury first, and then murderously went to Song Qingshu\u2019s residence to find out.\u201cSong Qingshu, if that person was you just now, I will make you have no choice but to die!\u201d Dongfang Bubai sneered in his heart, and without waiting for the people in the room to answer, he pushed open the door and rushed in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, when he opened the door and saw the scene in the room, he couldn\u2019t help but freeze there.It turned out that the bed was full of spring, and when he heard the sound of the door opening, Song Qingshu turned his head. After seeing that it was Dongfang Bubai, he couldn\u2019t help but turn pale. His response was to remain silent, as if he was deeply afraid of Dongfang Bubai finding something out.What kind of eyesight did Dongfang Bubai have? He could see that there was still a woman in the quilt. Although he couldn\u2019t see the front, only with her exposed snowy white back, it was enough for him to conclude that she was a stunning beauty.\u201cYoung master Song is really in a good mood. Today there was an assassin in the palace, but you are enjoying your tenderness here.\u201d Dongfang Bubai looked at Song Qingshu with a smile but not a smile.Song Qingshu\u2019s face was ashen, and without answering, he quietly pulled the quilt to block the delicate body beside him.Dongfang Bubai\u2019s expression suddenly changed, \u201cSong Qingshu, you are so bold, all the women in the entire palace are the Emperor\u2019s, and you dare to touch his women?\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s voice was hoarse and he bitterly said, \u201cSong is vulgar, lustful, and misbehaved, and today\u2019s disaster is entirely self-inflicted\u2026 Leader Dongfang, let\u2019s take action. Although this Song knows that he is definitely not the leader\u2019s opponent, but he is not one to wait for death.\u201d After he finished speaking, he readied his sword in front of him, as if he was taking his last stand.\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Dongfang Bubai felt purplexed,\u00a0\u2018Did I guess it right?\u2019\u00a0Glancing at the woman on the bed, he asked, \u201cWho is this woman?\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s face was gloomy and full of uncertainty, and it seemed like he was obviously struggling, and finally said hoarsely, \u201cConcubine Mi.\u201d\u201cConcubine Mi?\u201d Dongfang Bubai was taken aback.\u00a0\u2018I thought this woman was some kind of a beautiful palace maid or something, but Song Qingshu was so courageous that he dared to touch Concubine Mi, the most beloved concubine of Emperor Kangxi!\u2019\u201cConcubine Mi, did Song Qingshu force you?\u201d Dongfang Bubai looked at the woman on the bed and asked in a deep voice, thinking that if Song Qingshu relied on martial arts to forcefully steal the flower, he wouldn\u2019t mind cleaning up this kind of filth from this world.\u201cNo\u2026 this concubine herself\u2026 I want to.\u201d The woman on the bed spoke up after hesitating for a while, her voice soft like a mosquito.Song Qingshu glanced affectionately at the woman beside him, turned around, as if he had made up his mind, threw the Wooden Sword to the ground, and smiled lightly, \u201cThis Song knows that he is not the opponent of Leader Dongfang, and is willing to die, I just ask the leader to show mercy, don\u2019t let Concubine Mi\u2019s reputation be ruined.\u201d\u201cNo! If we die, we will die together. I hope we can be true husband and wife in the next life.\u201d A pink and white arm stretched out from the quilt, and gently but firmly held onto Song Qingshu\u2019s hand.Seeing the two of their display of affection, Dongfang Bubai became very impatient, and thought in his heart,\u00a0\u2018It seems that the assassin is not Song Qingshu. If he was the assassin he would face nothing more than death, but this Song Qingshu touched the Emperor\u2019s concubine, that is the sin of family eradication!\u2019Thinking of this, Dongfang Bubai snorted coldly, \u201cI don\u2019t have time to care about your matters. Since Young Master Song has a beautiful companion, I won\u2019t disturb you.\u201d As soon as his voice fell, the figure had disappeared to dozens of feet away.\u201cThank you TVB, thank you for \u201cA Step into the Past\u201d. Thank you Gu Tianle\u2026\u201d Seeing that Dongfang Bubai was successfully deceived, Song Qingshu felt that the clothes on his back were soaked with cold sweat.\u00a0(Goblin: Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) is a television broadcasting company based in Hong Kong. TVB is known primarily for its dramas. \u201cA Step into the Past\u201d is one of those dramas. This drama also has a novel version translated by Kohchun. This was the first Chinese web novel I had ever read. I highly recommend it. Gu Tianle is the protagonist of the story.)It turned out that at the critical moment, Song Qingshu imitated a scene from TVB\u2019s \u201cA Step into the Past\u201d. It was the scene where Xiang Shaolong pretended to let Xinling Jun catch the clue that he was sleeping with the princess, and let Xinling Jun believe that Lu Gong\u2019s Secret Record was not stolen by him. Together with Xia Qingqing, they performed a good show.Song Qingshu has been gambling, betting that Dongfang Bubai only cared about his own interests, and was not a defender of loyalty and patriotism.Sure enough, when Dongfang Bubai saw that the Emperor was wearing a green hat, he had no interest in telling Emperor Kangxi about this secret, and just\u00a0 left indifferently. Under Song Qingshu\u2019s deliberate suppression, he didn\u2019t notice the injury on his body at all.\u201cGet out of the bed!\u201d A slightly crying voice came from the side.Song Qingshu hurriedly jumped out of bed, turned his back to Xia Qingqing and said, \u201cIt was the last resort, I hope Youyou will forgive me.\u201d\u201cI told you that you are not allowed to call me Youyou!\u201d In order to deceive Dongfang Bubai, Xia Qingqing in the quilt took off only her underwear, and she touched Song Qingshu\u2019s skin, causing her pretty face to blush.\u201cThen what do I call you? Qingqing?\u201d The name \u201cYouyou\u201d was a symbol of the fate between the two, and Song Qingshu didn\u2019t want to call her by any other name.\u201cCall me Madame Yuan in the future.\u201d Xia Qingqing put on her clothes and swore in her heart,\u00a0\u2018As long as I can avenge Big Brother Yuan, I am willing to pay any price!\u2019\u201cMadame. Yuan?\u201d Song Qingshu said with a wry smile, \u201cI always find it weird to call you that.\u201dXia Qingqing stopped paying attention to him, and asked instead, \u201cYou just said that there is a way to get revenge, what is it?\u201dSong Qingshu choked his breath, but had no choice but to say, \u201cCould it be that Madame Yuan forgot which sect Master Yuan belonged to?\u201d\u201cBig Brother Yuan learned from a master of Mount Hua Sect and my father, the Golden Serpent Gentleman,\u201d Xia Qingqing said suspiciously, \u201cMy father has been dead for many years. As for Big Brother Yuan\u2019s master, the Divine Sword Immortal Ape, his martial art is probably on the same level as Big Brother Yuan. If you want to invite him to take revenge for Big Brother Yuan, I\u2019m afraid that old man will lose his life instead.\u201d (Goblin: Divine Sword Immortal Ape is the nickname of Mu Renqing, the leader of Mount Hua Sect.)Song Qingshu closed the door again, turned his head and slowly said, \u201cTo be precise, Master Yuan learned the Mount Hua Swordplay. However, the one with the highest martial arts is not the Divine Sword Immortal Ape Mu Renqing, but another character who can rival Dongfang Bubai.\u201d\u201cWho is it?\u201d Xia Qingqing\u2019s eyes lit up, thinking that there might be another master in her Brother Yuan\u2019s sect.\u201cThe Mount Hua Sword Saint, who is also known as the \u2018number one swordmaster in the world\u2019, Feng Qingyang.\u201d Song Qingshu\u2019s thoughts drifted back to the battle that he had at the Cogitation Cliff.\u201cFeng Qingyang?\u201d Xia Qingqing seemed to remember some rumors about this person in the wulin, and her beautiful eyes burst into a hopeful look.\u201cYes, as long as you can ask him to come out and cooperate with the rest of the Mount Hua Sect, it is not impossible for you to take revenge.\u201d Song Qingshu secretly sighed. As the saying goes, a hero can\u2019t ignore a saddened beauty.\u00a0 He had worked hard in the Qing court for his plans. So much effort went into it, but was it worth giving up for one Xia Qingqing?\u201cOkay, I will immediately go to Mount Hua to ask Master to come forward, and see if we can request Master Feng Qingyang to come out of the mountain.\u201d Xia Qingqing could not wait to head for Mount Hua immediately.\u201cIt\u2019s already dawn, how can you get out of the palace now?\u201d Song Qingshu hurriedly grabbed her, \u201cBesides, Dongfang Bubai must be watching closely. Wouldn\u2019t you get caught by him if you went out? Stay here for a few days, and then we will discuss the plan of revenge for your husband.\u201dXia Qingqing tilted her head and looked at him for a while, and suddenly showed a bright smile, \u201cIt is very kind of you to let me live here for a few more days, are you trying to take advantage of me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She felt sleepy, and lay down on the bed, tightened the quilt, and looked at Song Qingshu who was sitting on the edge of the bed vigilantly: \u201cI have something to say first. I am only in the same bed with you because of an emergency today. If you have an evil intention later, I\u2019ll cut your hands and feet.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my lower abdomen has been injured. Even if I have bad thoughts, I don\u2019t have the ability to do bad things.\u201d Song Qingshu didn\u2019t open his eyes, he concentrated on running his true qi and healed his injuries.Xia Qingqing was taken aback, and asked in a strange way, \u201cAre you\u2026 alright?\u201dSong Qingshu opened his eyes and looked at her with a playful look, \u201cThen do you want me to get better?\u201d\u201cI want you to die.\u201d With a blushing face, Xia Qingqing pulled up the quilt and covered her head with her back facing Song Qingshu.Seeing Xia Qingqing, who has always been charming and dignified, showing the attitude of a young maiden, Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but smile knowingly, and continued to return to the state of meditation.After an unknown time, Zhang Kangnian\u2019s voice suddenly came from outside, \u201cOfficial Song, the Emperor asked you to meet him in the imperial study.\u201dWhen he opened his eyes, Song Qingshu found that the sky was already bright. Looking back, Xia Qingqing was still sleeping soundly. Her long hair covered the blue silk on the pillow naturally. There was a smile on the corner of her mouth, but there was a bit of sadness in her brows. With a sigh in his heart, Song Qingshu knew that she might have been too tired during this time, so he couldn\u2019t bear to wake her up. He left a note beside her pillow, and quietly came out of the house.\u201cBrother Zhang, long time no see.\u201d Looking at Zhang Kangnian, Song Qingshu felt a need to be kind.\u201cDon\u2019t call me that way in the future,\u201d Zhang Kangnian smiled, \u201cOfficial Song is now a higher official than this humble one.\u201d\u201cBrother Zhang, I\u2019ll be out of my mind if I say that. Anyone with a discerning eye will know that I\u2019m a first-class guard in name only. In the future, when I enter a casino or visit the brothel in the capital, I will need more advice from Brother Zhang.\u201d Song Qingshu said while getting dressed, having a friendly chat with him.Zhang Kangnian\u2019s expression suddenly relaxed, he smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s natural. In fact, Official Wei is the expert in this respect\u2026\u201dThe two chatted for a while, and Song Qingshu asked quietly, \u201cMay I know why the Emperor suddenly asked for me?\u201dZhang Kangnian looked embarrassed, \u201cI don\u2019t know about this either. The Emperor specially ordered me to notify Brother Song, and I naturally came to find you after the emperor\u2019s dismissal.\u201d\u2018Could it be that it is related to the assassination attemp incident last night? Or did Dongfang Bubai spill his secret? No, it shouldn\u2019t be. Otherwise, there would be thousands of troops waiting outside the door, not Zhang Kangnian\u2026\u2019\u00a0Song Qingshu kept speculating along the way. Then, he soon came before the door of the imperial study.\u201cMaster Song, go in by yourself, I will wait here.\u201dAfter saying farewell to Zhang Kangnian, Song Qingshu pushed open the door and entered. When he saw\u00a0 Dongfang Bubai sitting inside, he was shocked.\u201cA blessed morning, Leader Dongfang.\u201d Song Qingshu said, a little embarrassed.\u201cThe hibiscus tent is warm, and the spring night is short. It seems that Lord Song had an enjoyable night.\u201d Dongfang Bubai glanced at him, but there was no change of expression on his face.\u201cI would like to thank Leader Dongfang for helping this Song with a certain matter.\u201d Song Qingshu thought to himself that he really did not want to die. If he could grab Dongfang Bubai\u2019s thick thigh and make him an ally from an opponent, then his life would be a lot easier.\u201cI\u2019m too lazy to care about your filthy matters,\u201d Dongfang Bubai said noncommittally, \u201cBy the way, there is something I want to ask you.\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s heart jumped, and he replied calmly, \u201cAs long as this Song knows, I will answer everything to the best of my knowledge.\u201dDongfang Bubai was very satisfied with his attitude and said, \u201cWhere did you learn your Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms?\u201d\u2018Sure enough!\u2019\u00a0Song Qingshu secretly broke into a cold sweat and replied, \u201cIt came from the Heaven-Reliant Sword.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Dongfang Bubai opened his slender phoenix eyes and sighed, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that the rumors of the Heaven-Reliant Sword and Dragon-Slaying Saber would actually be true. But with just a set of Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms, don\u2019t think you can really rule the wulin, hehe\u2026\u201d\u00a0(Goblin: Hidden in the blade of the Dragon Saber is the military treatise Book of Wumu by the Song dynasty general Yue Fei. Similarly, concealed in the blade of the Heaven Sword are two scrolls detailing the Nine Yin Manual and Guo Jing\u2019s \u201cEighteen Dragon Subduing Palms\u201d. It is believed that getting either or both of them would allow their wielder to rule the wulin.)Like a chicken pecking at rice, Song Qingshu nodded his head in agreement: \u201cCompared to the Leader Dongfang\u2019s Sunflower Manual, the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms is really nothing.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but wonder,\u00a0\u2018Just the mention of the name Sunflower Manual makes all men feel cold between their legs. \u201cIf you want to practice this method, swing a knife from the palace\u201d this sentence should not be fake, but I have never heard that the Sunflower Manual will turn a man into a woman. That feeling of soft touch last night. What da Fu*k! I actually touched the pectoral muscles of a Trans Woman, I feel nauseated\u2026\u2019Noticing Song Qingshu\u2019s change in expression, Dongfang Bubai said indifferently, \u201cLooking at the expression on Master Song\u2019s face, you don\u2019t seem to be convinced.\u201d\u201cHow dare I! Of course, Leader Dongfang will rule the wulin for thousands of years.\u201d Song Qingshu was taken aback, and the future happenings of the Sun Moon Holy Cult popped out in his mind.Dongfang Bubai couldn\u2019t help but smile and asked, \u201cThen you should know about others who know the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms in this world. Who are they?\u201d\u201cSpeaking of the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms, Xiao Feng, the king of the Southern Liao State, and Guo Jing, from Northern Xia, are naturally the top masters.\u201d Song Qingshu said while paying attention to the other party\u2019s expression.\u201cContinue.\u201d Dongfang Bubai had already ruled out these two people.\u201cShi Huolong, the leader of the\u00a0 Beggars\u2019 Sect in Jiangnan, is rumored to be second only to Xiao Feng and Guo Jing for his achievements in the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms.\u201d Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t afford to consider too much now, and was trying his best to give himself an escape route.\u201cContinue.\u201d Dongfang Bubai shook his head secretly, Shi Houlong\u2019s age was not right.\u201cThere are also the Four Great Elders of the Beggars\u2019 Sect, and they know some techniques of the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms.\u201d At this point Song Qingshu\u2019s back was secretly drenched in sweat.\u201cIs there anyone younger, let\u2019s see, about the same age as you?\u201d Dongfang Bubai looked at him suspiciously, no matter how he looked at Song Qingshu, this guy looked like that person from last night.\u201cUh!\u201d Song Qingshu was almost scared to death, and quickly said, \u201cI heard that Yelu Qi, the number one master of the younger generation of the royal family of the Liao Kingdom. He is also proficient in the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms.\u201d\u201cYelu Qi?\u201d Dongfang Bubai became thoughtful, and suddenly raised his head and smiled, \u201cMaster Song knows a lot about things in the martial arts.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s natural. I\u2019ll have you know that I have the nickname \u201cWulin\u2019s All-knowing\u201d, and that\u2019s what I am.\u201d Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t care about bragging at this moment. He just wanted to quickly divert Dongfang Bubai\u2019s attention. Otherwise, the more the other party asked, the more suspicious he would become.\u201cHahaha, since Master Song claims to be \u201cWulin\u2019s All-knowing\u201d, then you will have no problem with this task.\u201d Emperor Kangxi just walked in, and when he heard his words, he couldn\u2019t help laughing.\u201cMay I know what mission it is?\u201d Song Qingshu was stunned, and asked after saluting.Sitting on the side, Dongfang Bubai looked at the lofty Emperor Kangxi, and humble Song Qingshu. Then he remembered that Emperor Kangxi\u2019s most beloved Concubine Mi was willing to lie under Song Qingshu last night, and his expression could not help becoming a little weird.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

During this time, I thought about this matter carefully. After all, this kind of subjugation is superficial, and each sect will inevitably stand against me.\u201d Kangxi frowned as he spoke.\u201cMay I know what the Emperor\u2019s plan is?\u201d After being with Wei Xiaobao for a long time, Song Qingshu\u2019s ability to observe words and expressions had become very good, and he quickly asked in cooperation.Emperor Kangxi replied, \u201cFor many years, I have been deeply aware of the lack of skilled guards in front of the royal family, so I will take this opportunity to let the heads of each faction send their prized members to the capital to expand the guard team in the Forbidden City. Song Qingshu, you are familiar with each faction. So, this time I will send you to various sects to recruit their disciples.\u201dSong Qingshu screamed inside,\u00a0\u2018Recruiting guards for the capital is saying it nicely, but to put it more truthfully, these people are all hostages!\u2019\u201cThis official has received his decree!\u201d Song Qingshu immediately understood the essence of his mission. When he went to each sect, he had to make sure that all the people they sent to the capital were the most beloved sons of the sect masters. If there were no children, they had to send the second-generation, or the chief disciples to the capital.\u201cHow many people are you planning to bring on this trip?\u201d Emperor Kangxi asked.\u201cJust this offitial is enough.\u201d Song Qingshu thought to himself that he finally had the opportunity to be alone with Xia Qingqing. It would cause nothing but trouble if he took Duo Long or Zhang Kangnian and others. They had seen the appearance of Miss Youyou at the Spring Beauty Pavillion. If they traveled together, and it was difficult to guarantee that she would not be recognized, so how could Song Qingshu agree to bring people along?Emperor Kangxi frowned, \u201cIt is impossible to guarantee that there will be no rebel dogs jumping over the wall during this mission. Master Song alone will be too weak to handle them.\u201d\u201cReplying to the Emperor, those sects have already expressed their submission to the imperial court. Even if they have dissent, they must be in the minority. With the martial arts of this official, it is not difficult to deal with it.\u201d Song Qingshu replied.\u201cMaster Dongfang, what do you think?\u201d Emperor Kangxi turned to look at Dongfang Bubai and asked.Dongfang Bubai glanced at Song Qingshu and replied, \u201cThere are no major schools in the Qing Dynasty. With Song Qingshu\u2019s martial arts, it is more than enough to deal with those second- and third-rate schools.\u201dOnly then did Emperor Kangxi relent and said, \u201cOkay, Master Song, I will make you a special envoy of the imperial court and give you a Yellow Cloth. If necessary, you can mobilize the local officials to assist you, and you have the right to execute first and then file a report.\u201dAfter leaving the imperial study, Dongfang Bubai looked at Song Qingshu suspiciously, \u201cYou aren\u2019t planning to elope with Concubine Mi, right?\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s face froze, \u201cSect Leader Dongfang is joking, and this one wouldn\u2019t dare even if I had ten times the courage.\u201d\u201cYou dare to do a lot of things. Be careful though\u2026 or, I don\u2019t want to be sent to hunt you down in person one day.\u201d After Dongfang Bubai finished saying his piece, he left.Thinking of that terrifying scene, Song Qingshu subconsciously shook his head and hurriedly walked to his residence.Pushing open the door, he saw the quilts on the bed neatly folded and the beautiful lady missing. Song Qingshu suddenly felt lost, and stood at the door in a daze.\u201cAre you looking for me?\u201d A soft female voice came from behind.Song Qingshu turned his head back in surprise, and saw Xia Qingqing lying on the wall, holding up her head in one hand and twilight silk in the other, with a faint smile at the corner of her mouth, looking at him.At this time, the sun was rising, and strands of golden light were scattered on Xia Qingqing\u2019s dress, and a beautiful halo suddenly appeared. Song Qingshu stared at it for a while, and murmured, \u201cI\u2019m looking for a Lazy Little Pig, has this fairy sister seen it?\u201dXia Qingqing thought back to when she woke up, the room was already empty, her pretty face turned slightly red, she rolled over and jumped down, then snorted, \u201cDid you usually use these sweet words to deceive little girls?\u201d\u201cMany women say that my mouth is very sweet, do you want to try it, little lady?\u201d Seeing that the other party was about to flare up, Song Qingshu quickly changed his tone, \u201cMadame was wearing night clothes yesterday, where did you get such a beautiful dress today?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t care about these details,\u201d Xia Qingqing waved. \u201cAfter waking up in the morning, I was worried that someone would come to your room, so I hid outside.\u201d\u201cMadame worries so much for the sake of this lowly one, this lowly servant can\u2019t wait to show his love to you\u2026\u201d Noticing Xia Qingqing\u2019s expression, Song Qingshu did not dare to say another word.\u201cHumph, you\u2019re always so rude,\u201d Xia Qingqing sighed, \u201cAlthough you took some advantages last night, but I\u2019m a widow, and I can\u2019t stay here for a long time. After nightfall tonight, I\u2019ll leave the palace. Even if I meet Dongfang Bubai, it\u2019s not a big deal if I die, anyway, if Brother Yuan is dead, I also don\u2019t want to live anymore.\u201d\u201cYou keep talking about other men in front of me, don\u2019t you know I\u2019ll be sad?\u201d Song Qingshu looked hurt, \u201cThink of it as I\u2019m afraid of you, so I\u2019ll take you out later.\u201dBefore Xia Qingqing could get angry, she heard his next sentence and asked in surprise, \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cAlthough I\u2019m also looking forward to living with a beauty, the Emperor won\u2019t let me enjoy my life.\u201d Song Qingshu told her about his mission out of the Capital one by one.\u201cHumph! Being a dog of the Qing court is still very enjoyable.\u201d Xia Qingqing turned around angrily.\u201cThe reason for this, I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t tell you now, but please believe me, I am really not what I seem to be.\u201d Song Qingshu quickly changed his words.Xia Qingqing remained silent for a while, then said with a smile, \u201cWell, after so many contacts, although Young Master Song often\u2026 sounds fickle, I believe you are a good person.\u201d\u201cStop, stop! This woman, don\u2019t send a good person card indiscriminately,\u201d Song Qingshu said gloomily, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about those things. First, you have to change your face before going out, otherwise if I take such a fairy-like woman out of the palace, trouble will come immediately. Dongfang Bubai and the guards guarding the gate will not let us go.\u201dHearing his admiration for her appearance, Xia Qingqing pursed her lips and smiled, \u201cA disguise, I\u2019m good at that.\u201d Before this she disguised herself as a man to win the heart of He Tieshou, the leader of the Five Poisons Cult. It was one of the proudest things in her life.\u201cYou too?\u201d Song Qingshu looked at her in astonishment.\u201cOf course!\u201d Xia Qingqing raised her chin proudly, pushed him out the door, closed the doors and windows, and then her voice came out, \u201cDon\u2019t peek!\u201dSong Qingshu smiled bitterly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will look at you honestly and openly when I see you next time. This Song can\u2019t do something like peeping.\u201dAfter a stick of incense, the door opened, and a handsome young man appeared in front of Song Qingshu. He slowly turned around and smiled proudly: \u201cHow\u00a0 is it?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is this!\u201d Song Qingshu sighed and said speechlessly: \u201cIs this what you mean by disguise? Tie up your hair, wrap your chest, and change into men\u2019s clothes to disguise?\u201d\u201cIs there any problem with this?\u201d Xia Qingqing looked down at herself and asked suspiciously, \u201cWhen I was active in the wulin in the past, few people could see through it.\u201d\u201cThat means you ancient people are stupid!\u201d Song Qingshu looked indignant, \u201cThis young master will not bet his life on such an illogical plot from the original story. Wait a moment, this brother will show you what is a real disguise technique.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After a while, he ran back in a hurry with an extra plate of clay paste in his hand.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Xia Qingqing asked suspiciously.\u201cThe real disguise technique.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled and said, \u201cYou should sit down, I\u2019ll give you a new disguise. With what you did just now, even if the soldiers can\u2019t see through it, Dongfang Bubai will. You can\u2019t fool him.\u201d\u201cHow could there be such a coincidence that we will just happen to meet that pervert?\u201d Xia Qingqing was also taken aback.\u201cThe pervert you mentioned suffered a big loss before. He has always suspected that it was me who fought him that night. He has been staring at me so much recently that I am sure he will definitely do something.\u201d Song Qingshu said while preparing to use the paste on Xia Qingqing\u2019s face.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Seeing his fingers touching her face, the woman\u2019s restraint made Xia Qingqing hide back subconsciously.\u201cWhy are you making it so hard to touch your face?\u201d Song Qingshu looked impatient, \u201cDon\u2019t think so dirty, just treat me as a doctor, there is no distinction between men and women in the eyes of doctors.\u201d\u201cHmph, it\u2019s easy for you to say. If you were a woman and I was a man, would you let me touch you so casually?\u201d Xia Qingqing said gloomily, but still obediently stopped dodging.When Song Qingshu\u2019s fingers touched her cheek, Xia Qingqing couldn\u2019t help but tremble. She was about to speak, but she didn\u2019t know what to say for a while, so she had to close her lips tightly and endure it.\u201cYour face is very tender, what do you usually use to maintain it?\u201d\u201cWhy is your physique so sensitive? Your whole body trembles when I only touch your face. This is a disease and it needs to be cured.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d\u201cOokey\u2026Okey~\u201d*****Xia Qingqing endured Song Qingshu\u2019s hand moving on her face, and at the same time she had to endure the noise of her ears. And when it was time to check the end result, \u201cThis\u2026this\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you think? Very handsome, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Song Qingshu admired his masterpiece proudly.\u201cYou big bastard!\u201d Xia Qingqing felt like she was about to collapse, \u201cWhy did you make me look like you!\u201d\u201cIs there anything wrong with my appearance?\u201d Song Qingshu said speechlessly, \u201cI have my own intentions for doing this, and you will understand when the time comes.\u201dAlthough Xia Qingqing felt a little confused, she had to admit that the other party\u2019s disguise technique was simply amazing. Looking at the bronze mirror, she looked up at Song Qingshu, and was shocked, \u2018We look exactly the same!\u2019\u201cWell, I\u2019m still a little taller.\u201d Song Qingshu walked around her for a few times, then took out a pair of shoes and threw them in front of her, \u201cThis will increase your height. In the past, with this treasured shoe, Master Huang had traveled the wulin for more than ten years, it\u2019s very effective. \u201c\u201cWhat are you talking about, I\u2019ve never heard of any Master surnamed Huang in the wulin.\u201d Xia Qingqing was puzzled and put it on her feet, and found that the heights of the two were equal all of a sudden, she couldn\u2019t help being surprised, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing!\u201dHearing her voice, Song Qingshu pursed her lips, \u201cNo, no, your voice has to change.\u201d As soon as he finished speaking, he reached out and tapped a few acupoints on her neck.\u201cYou\u2026 Huh?\u201d Xia Qingqing was startled by the obvious male voice as soon as she spoke.\u201cAlthough the tone of the voice is still a little off, it\u2019s barely enough, and most people can\u2019t tell the difference.\u201d Song Qingshu finally nodded, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s time for me to disguise myself.\u201dXia Qingqing watched curiously, and saw that he kept slapping the clay paste on his face. As he kneaded, the blue-black clay slowly turned into the color of his skin. The visage of an ordinary guard appeared in front of her.After changing into the corresponding clothes, Song Qingshu specially instructed Xia Qingqing to take precautions. After the preparations were complete, the two walked straight towards the palace gate.\u201cYour disguise is so powerful.\u201d Xia Qingqing couldn\u2019t help whispering when she saw many guards who they met on the road greeting her.\u201cDo your best to shower me with compliments, I won\u2019t mind.\u201d Song Qingshu didn\u2019t look sideways, and his expression remained serious.Xia Qingqing ignored his lies, bit her lower lip, and said in a fierce tone, \u201cTeach me!\u201d\u201cWant to learn? Beg me.\u201d\u201cGo to hell!\u201d\u201cMy old aunt, you\u2019re holding on to me right now. Don\u2019t bite your lip when you\u2019re talking, don\u2019t shake your butt so much when you\u2019re walking\u2026 My reputation was almost ruined by you\u2026\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Xia Qingqing almost passed out due to anger.*****The two whispered all the way until they came to the palace gate, and handed over the badge. After the guard checked it, they returned it with both hands respectfully, \u201cWe wish Master Song a smooth journey.\u201dXia Qingqing indicated her reply with a smile, while hoping that there were no accidents along the way. Just as she was about to walk out of the palace gate, she heard a voice behind her that she would never forget in her life, \u201cOfficial Song\u2019s trip is very dangerous, and this Dongfang is here to see you off.\u201dSong Qingshu\u2019s face changed, and he pocked Xia Qingqing quietly. Xia Qingqing reacted and quickly said with a smile, \u201cThis Song is very honored to have the Cult leader Dongfang see him off in person.\u201dNoticing the difference in the tone of his voice, Dongfang Bubai gave him a strange look, but he didn\u2019t care too much, instead his attention was on Song Qingshu, who was standing on the side, \u201cDidn\u2019t Master Song tell the Emperor that he would carry out the task alone, why do you still bring another with you? And a guard too?\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Xia Qingqing said while pretending to be calm, \u201cThere are some matters that always need the help of others.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Looking at Song Qingshu, Dongfang Bubai\u2019s eyes were filled with suspicion, and he thought to himself, \u2018Could it be that this Song Qingshu is so daring and dare to take Concubine Mi out of the palace?\u2019The more he thought about it, the more he thought it was possible, Dongfang Bubai came close to Song Qingshu with a smile, stretched out his hand and slowly patted his chest, and said, \u201cThis one will help you see if the bodyguard you picked is strong enough.\u201dWatching as the hand slowly approached his chest, Song Qingshu\u2019s mind went into overdrive, and finally he gritted his teeth, gave up the plan of defense, and let the opponent hit him on his chest.The thing Dongfang Bubai touched felt tough and firm, and it was completely different from the soft and elastic feeling in his imagination, which made him stunned.He thought that this guard must have been, Concubine Mi in disguise, but no matter how clever the disguise, it was impossible to make a woman\u2019s characteristics disappear, so he directly reached out and touched the chest. If the other party was really Concubine Mi, she would definitely not tolerate another man touching her breasts. Even if she endured it, he could still tell whether the other party was a man or a woman by feeling from his hand.\u2018You stupit pervert, haven\u2019t you touched me enough? You touched me twice!\u2019 Song Qingshu broke out in cold sweat, but a smile appeared on his mouth: \u201cGreetings to Lord Dongfang.\u201dConvinced that the other party was a man, it was as if his hand got scalded, and Dongfang Bubai suddenly shrank back, looking at him with disgust. He looked back at Xia Qingqing, \u201cLord Song wants to bring an entourage, naturally you have your own reason. This one will leave first, I wish Lord Song success.\u201d After speaking, he walked away without waiting for the other party to answer.Goblin : I\u2019m having some technical difficulties. So I was unable to properly format this chapter. I hope you won\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll fix this when I\u2019m done with the issues.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Otherwise I would be touched by that pervert. Eugh! I feel sick just thinking about it.\u201d After leaving Yanjing City, the two changed back to their original attire, and Xia Qingqing was finally able to speak in her original voice.\u201cDo you want me to tell the truth or the lie?\u201d Song Qingshu hesitated for a while, then smiled strangely.\u201cWhat is the lie, and what is the truth?\u201d Xia Qingqing was puzzled by his words.\u201cThe lie is, it\u2019s all due to my excellence, I expected that pervert would come and make such a move.\u201d Song Qingshu replied.Xia Qingqing suddenly had an ominous premonition in her heart and asked hesitantly, \u201cWhat about the truth?\u201d\u201cThe truth?\u201d Song Qingshu looked a little embarrassed, \u201cActually, I just wanted to find an upright reason to touch you.\u201d\u201cSong Qingshu, I\u2019m going to murder you!\u201d Xia Qingqing was furious, and suddenly drew out her sword and stabbed at Song Qingshu, but the other party had already escaped.*****Even until the two sat down in a small town inn, Xia Qingqing still hadn\u2019t calmed down. So, Song Qingshu hurriedly smiled and said, \u201cI just saw you being unhappy, and deliberately made fun of you. In order to make amends, I will accompany you to Mount Hua first, and then go do my work. Who cares about carrying out Kangxi\u2019s mission?\u201dXia Qingqing\u2019s face finally softened, and she said, \u201cWho cares about your company.\u201dSong Qingshu picked up the teapot on the table and poured her a cup of clear tea, and shyly smiled, \u201cYou will have a devoted servant who carries tea and water along the way, it\u2019s not a bad thing\u2026\u201dXia Qingqing saw that his voice had suddenly stopped, and when she looked up, she realized that Song Qingshu was staring behind her, and could not help but follow his gaze curiously.A man and a woman entered the inn.The man was tall and imposing, with a baggage on his back. He seemed to be in his mid thirties. The woman, on the other hand, seemed to be in her early twenties. Her skin was brighter than snow, her eyes were picturesque. She was actually a stunning beauty.The man held the young woman\u2019s hand, and the two looked intimate, as if they were a newlywed couple. The two came to an empty table, the man pulled over a bench and sat down with the young woman, looking very gentle and considerate. The clothes of the two were very luxurious. The young woman had a golden crested hairpin inlaid with pearl beads on her head. The pearl was almost the size of a little finger, smooth and round, and it seemed very precious.Seeing Song Qingshu staring at the woman so intently, Xia Qingqing felt quite displeased and snorted coldly.As if being awakened, Song Qingshu murmured in admiration, \u201cShe has a beautiful appearance and a pretty complexion. Not to mention that such beauties are rare in the north, even in the south of the Yangtze River. The green brocade she wore was already very bright in color, but compared to the brilliance of her face, even the brightest brocade paled.\u201d\u201cHave you said enough?\u201d Xia Qingqing only felt extremely annoyed, and there was a hint of anger in her tone.\u201cWhy\u2026is Madame feeling jealous?\u201d Song Qingshu turned around and said with a smile but not a smile.Xia Qingqing was about to speak, when she suddenly glanced at the changes in the restaurant, she couldn\u2019t help but spit out, \u201cMen are not good things.\u201dSong Qingshu raised his head in amazement, and found that a few people at the next table who looked like bandits, got up and leaned towards the pair of men and women.\u201cWe are from the Fierce Tiger Stronghold! Scram if you don\u2019t want to die.\u201d One of them shouted, and many of the diners in the restaurant slipped out.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be so lucky this time. Not only did I meet a fat sheep, but also such a charming little lady, hehe.\u201d The rest of the people looked at the young woman with a smirk.\u201cDamn!\u201d The man slapped the table and stood up.Song Qingshu shook his head secretly, this man had suffered serious internal injuries, and it was very likely that he was doomed this time.A few bandits kicked a bench towards them, and took the opportunity to slash with their sword.\u201cBe careful Guinong!\u201d Seeing the cold light flashing, the woman was so frightened that her face turned pale.\u201cGuinong?\u201d Song Qingshu was quite surprised, wondering if it really was the two he was thinking about.The man who was called Guinong calmly avoided the flying bench, shrank back, and attacked one of the bandits.The bandit spat out a mouthful of blood and stepped back. Then the man grabbed the wrist of one of them, twisted it slightly, and raised the sword in his hand to block the others.\u201cThis man is very skilled in martial arts, but why do I feel that he is out of breath and a little weak?\u201d Xia Qingqing has also been paying attention to the fight, and asked suspiciously when she noticed it.As soon as she finished speaking, the man was kicked in the back by a bandit and lost his balance. How could the other bandits miss this opportunity and they raise their swords and slashed at him one after another.The man rolled on the ground in an embarrassing manner, but he was able to dodge the strikes, but he couldn\u2019t avoid the rest of the punches, and he retreated to the young woman\u2019s side. \u201cI, Tian Guinong, did not die in the hands of the \u201cGolden Faced Buddha\u201d, Miao Renfeng, who was thought to be invincible all over the world, but I would die in the hands of a few lowly bandits?\u201dThe young woman was trembling all over, obviously extremely frightened. She hugged the man tightly, and there was a hint of panic in her voice, \u201cIt was me who harmed you.\u201d(Goblin: These two are characters from the novel Fox Volant of the Snowy Mountain. You can go to the wiki, and know more about the story.)\u201cLan, if I can get your favor, this life has not been in vain.\u201d The man looked at the young woman with tenderness in his eyes.\u201cHeh, we have seen a lot of this kind of life and death drama. Don\u2019t worry, we will take good care of your wife after you die. Our brothers will take turns and feed her every day for a month. After that, she will be unable to stop and completely forget about you.\u201d Several bandits burst into laughter after speaking those obscene words.The man was furious, but at this moment his dantian was empty, and he couldn\u2019t even stand up, so he could only look at everyone in despair.Thinking of the upcoming humiliation, the young woman turned pale. She took the phoenix hairpin from her head and pressed it against her snow-white neck, her hands trembling.\u201cYou want to commit suicide? We have seen many women who wanted to die at first, but none of them could really do it\u2026Little lady, it\u2019s better to live than to die, and when you die, there is nothing left. If you are alive, we will let you go.\u201d Several bandits were also taken aback by this, and their leader said calmly in a hurry.The young woman really hesitated, and took the hairpin slightly away from her neck. The bandit leader was quick to knock out the phoenix hairpin from her hand.\u201cAahh!\u201d That young woman cried out in surprise.\u2018It seems that these two are Tian Guinong and Nan Lan, the wife of Miao Renfeng,\u2019 Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t help sighing because of their behavior, \u2018Nan Lan, a woman who is beautiful in appearance, but lacks wisdom. A shallow woman who only knows how to scream when things go wrong\u2026 I really might have a chance!\u2019With a flick of his finger, a few chopsticks were inserted on the opposite table, preventing the bandit leader\u2019s greasy hand from touching the young woman. The other bandits immediately became furious, \u201cStinky boy, you sure are bold, you dare interfere in our Fierce Tiger Stronghold\u2019s matters!\u201d\u201cWhat is this nonsense?\u201d Song Qingshu shrugged and pointed to his surroundings, \u201cJust look around you, after this incident, all the other guests ran away, and we just stayed here at the table. Yet you still can\u2019t tell that we are boss-level characters. Are you blind?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Song Qingshu waved his sleeves, infused the chopsticks with his internal energy, and they were shot at the bandits like sharp arrows.After a few screams, the hands of the bandits were pierced by chopsticks one after another. It was unknown if it was due to pain or fear. They all looked at each other in cold sweat and fled in embarrassment.Tian Guinong\u2019s eyes lit up. Although he was not a first-class expert, his eyesight was not bad. Seeing that Song Qingshu could accurately stab everyone\u2019s palm with his slender bamboo chopsticks, his inner strength and accuracy were truly shocking, and he thought in his heart, \u2018This person is probably a level higher than the Miao Renfeng in martial arts.\u2019\u201cThis one is surnamed Tian and named Guinong. I thank you two for helping, cough\u2026\u201d Tian Guinong coughed violently before he could finish his sentence, obviously affected by his internal injuries.Song Qingshu stretched out his palm and put it in front of Xia Qingqing, \u201cGive me one.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xia Qingqing asked in confusion.\u201cPoria Cocoa Pill, I don\u2019t have any healing medicine on me.\u201d Song Qingshu laughed. (Goblin: Poria cocos is a type of medicinal mushroom.)\u201cHmph, you\u2019re really generous.\u201d Even so, seeing that the man was seriously injured, Xia Qingqing took out a pill.\u201cYoung lady, this is a precious medicine for healing. Can you help me feed it to your companion?\u201d Song Qingshu handed the Poria Cocoa Pill to Nan Lan, and softly said. Xia Qingqing next to him saw him taking her medicine then giving it to the beauty in front of her so diligently. Her lungs almost exploded in anger.Seeing his handsome face so clearly, and thinking of his gallant figure as he made the enemies run away just now, Nan Lan\u2019s heart skipped a beat, and she quickly bowed and said, \u201cThank you for saving our lives. I still have yet to know your name.\u201dWhen Nan Lan took the medicine, Song Qingshu touched her hand gently, and took the opportunity to brush her slender fingers with his fingertips. He sighed in his heart, \u201cSo smooth, Tian Guinong is really blessed.\u201d\u00a0(Goblin: Yah\u2026as I said before, our protagonist is not a good person.)Feeling the touch on her hand, Nan Lan was taken aback and turned to look around subconsciously. She saw that Tian Guinong was in a semi-conscious state, and that woman had turned her head to the other side, apparently not seeing the scene just now.Feeling a little annoyed in her heart, she looked up and saw Song Qingshu\u2019s serious expression. Then she couldn\u2019t help but wonder in her heart, \u2018Could it be that the other party just touched it by accident, and she was thinking too much?\u2019\u201cMadame can call me Song Qingshu, this is my friend Miss Youyou.\u201d Song Qingshu dared not tell them Xia Qingqing\u2019s real name, Tian Guinong was the subordinate of Prince Bao of Shengjin, and in the future, if it reached Emperor Kangxi\u2019s ears, he would face a hell lot of troubles.\u201cIt turned out to be Young Master Song and Young Lady Youyou,\u201d Nan Lan smiled and nodded while helping Tian Guinong take the pill.\u201cMay I know what the madame\u2019s name is?\u201d Song Qingshu came to support Tian Guinong\u2019s back to help him heal.Nan Lan looked embarrassed and wondered why the other party was so abrupt, but thinking that he was her savior and that he was treating Tian Guinong\u2019s injury, she had to answer, \u201cThis one\u2019s surname is Nan, and the given name is Lan.\u201d\u201cNan Lan?\u201d Song Qingshu recited it silently, and said with admiration, \u201cThe given name is superb, and the surname name is also nice.\u201dNan Lan blushed slightly, and spoke a little shyly, \u201cYoung Master Song is exaggerating.\u201dXia Qingqing, who was on the side, couldn\u2019t take it any longer. Song Qingshu was taking advantage of a husband\u2019s unconscious state to tease his pretty wife. She interjected and asked, \u201cYour husband was injured so badly, may I know by whose hand?\u201dNan Lan was startled, recalling that she had deserted her husband Miao Renfeng, then eloped with Tian Guinong, and was chased down by Miao Renfeng. Tian Guinong was defeated, and now he was almost about to die.But how could she make that known to others, so Nan Lan could only vaguely say, \u201cHe was injured by a great enemy, but fortunately escaped with his life.\u201dAt this time, Tian Guinong also woke up and felt a warm mass of energy in his belly, and a strong domineering energy coming from his back. He instantly knew that he was rescued by an expert, so he quickly asked the names of Song Qingshu and his companion.Nan Lan on the side spoke up, \u201cGuinong, when you were unconscious just now, these two benefactors had already told their names. This is Song Qingshu, Young Master Song, and this is Young Lady Youyou.\u201d\u201cSong Qingshu?\u201d Tian Guinong was stunned, and hesitantly asked, \u201cIs this benefactor the First-class Guard in the Forbidden City?\u201dSong Qingshu was stunned, wondering how he knew about him, and asked, \u201cBrother Tian knows this Song?\u201d\u201cBenefactor had swept across several martial arts provinces under the command of the Qing Dynasty a few days ago. In the Battle of Mount Tai, he defeated Daoist Chongxu with one sword strike, and then defeated the Five Sacred Mountain Alliance leader Zuo Lengchan.\u201d Tian Guinong\u2019s expression was a little unnatural, and he thought,\u00a0\u2018Prince Bao doubted the purpose of Emperor Kangxi\u2019s move, and specially sent him to investigate. When he passed by Miao Renfeng\u2019s family, he fell in love with his wife Nan Lan at first sight, which led to today\u2019s situation. What an embarrassment\u2026\u2019Hearing him talk about the Battle of Mount Tai, Xia Qingqing\u2019s face turned gloomy as if it was about to rain, so Song Qingshu quickly changed the subject, \u201cI heard Madame say just now that Brother Tian was hurt by a great enemy. May I know if this Song can be of any help?\u201d\u201cThere are some things that we need to face by ourselves. Thank you for your kindness.\u201d Tian Guinong subconsciously refused, thinking that since Miao Renfeng had let go of the two that night, with his personality, he would naturally not continue to chase and kill him.On the one hand, he was in a hurry to return to Shengjing in order to report to Prince Bao. And, after seeing Song Qingshu\u2019s enthusiasm, he was afraid that he would also dare to let him mix in with the secret of breaking into the king\u2019s treasure.\u201cThis Tian will keep today\u2019s grace in mind. If the benefactor comes to Shengjing in the future, this Tian will surely receive you to the best of my ability.\u201d After a short rest, Tian Guinong felt that his injury was much better, and he quickly got up and said goodbye.\u201cOh?\u201d Song Qingshu raised his eyebrows, stood up and said in return, \u201cIf there is a chance in the future, Song will definitely come to visit Brother Tian and Madame .\u201dTian Guinong felt nothing wrong but Nan Lan felt extremely strange in her heart. Connecting with his actions just now, and the way he looked at her when he said \u201cMadame\u201d at the moment, her woman\u2019s intuition made her realize that the other party seemed to have meant something entirely different.\u201cThey are gone, so what are you looking at?\u201d Xia Qingqing on the side said sourly.\u201cGod treats me really well. A great beauty just left, but there is another great beauty here.\u201d Song Qingshu turned around and looked at Xia Qingqing\u2019s pretty face which was red with anger, and said with a smile.\u201cHmph, never serious.\u201d Xia Qingqing\u2019s expression finally looked a little better and asked, \u201cWhen are we going to Mount Hua, I don\u2019t have time to accompany you to visit various sects to take hostages.\u201d\u201cSince Madame has spoken, I will accompany you to Mount Hua right away.\u201d Song Qingshu pondered. Anyway, Emperor Kangxi didn\u2019t set a time limit for this mission, so it would not be too late to go after he dealt with the matters of Mount Hua.\u201cIt\u2019s very rare for you to say that. But, don\u2019t forget that I didn\u2019t force you to accompany me.\u201d Although Xia Qingqing said this, there was an uncontrollable smile on her lips.A few days later, the two arrived at Mount Hua, and when they passed a cliff, Xia Qingqing suddenly stopped, hesitated for a moment, then turned to Song Qingshu and said, \u201cDo you like me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As long as you speak a word, even if I have to go through a mountain of swords and a sea of fire, this Song will not frown.\u201d Song Qingshu didn\u2019t have the slightest hesitation when he spoke such big words.He had to naturally speak all kinds of sweet words to move her heart.\u201cOkay then\u2026I want you to jump off of here now.\u201d Xia Qingqing pointed to the cliff a few steps away, and a sly smile appeared on the corner of her mouth.Song Qingshu stretched out his neck and took a look, then spoke with a hesitant look on his face, \u201cThis cliff seems bottomless, and there wouldn\u2019t be any bones left if I jumped down.\u201d\u201cAfraid?\u201d Xia Qingqing sneered, \u201cWho said that he would go through fire and water for me? In this case, you should put away those thoughts in your heart in the future, and we can still be friends.\u201d\u201cI just thought that there would be no one to bury my corpse down there, and my heart was a little sad.\u201d Song Qingshu smiled sadly, \u201cAfter I die, Youyou, if you think of me occasionally in the dead of night, I will be satisfied.\u201d Then he jumped off the edge of the cliff.Xia Qingqing was completely surprised to see him jumping like this, but there was no panic on her face, instead, there was an incomprehensible feeling, and she stood there, stunned for a while, sighing in her heart, \u2018Could it be God\u2019s will?\u2019When she came to the edge of the cliff, looking at the smoke-filled abyss, Xia Qingqing bit her lips and jumped down.In the blink of an eye, Xia Qingqing landed on a platform in the mist, and found Song Qingshu standing there with a dazed face. And she asked him with a smile on her face, \u201cAren\u2019t you happy to be alive?\u201d\u201cI never imagined that there would be such a platform under just a few feet.\u201d Song Qingshu looked up at the top of the cliff and his voice was filled with emotion. However, he smiled proudly in his heart. Fortunately, he had been to this Golden Serpent Cave before, otherwise he would have been surprised by Xia Qingqing.\u201cFool, I\u2019ve never seen you being so obedient, why did you jump without blinking when I asked you to jump off a cliff.\u201d Looking at Song Qingshu, there was an unspeakable look in Xia Qingqing\u2019s eyes.\u201cBecause you asked me to.\u201d Song Qingshu stared at her with a burning passion in his eyes.Looking at him, Xia Qingqing felt a panic in her heart for a moment, so she turned her head unnaturally, took a deep breath, and calmly said, \u201cCome in with me.\u201dKneeling in front of the tomb of the Golden Serpent Gentleman, looking at the inscription on the tombstone \u201cYuan Chengzhi Xia Qingqing pays their respect\u201d, Xia Qingqing seemed to return to the time when she rebuilt her father\u2019s grave with her Brother Yuan. How happy they were during that time. The only thing she had to worry about was that girl, Ajiu.Now that she thought about it, it seemed ridiculous to worry about such matters at the beginning, only after losing her Big Brother Yuan did she know what real pain was.Seeing Xia Qingqing\u2019s sad expression, Song Qingshu guessed that she must have thought of Yuan Chengzhi again. He smiled bitterly, and looked around at the Golden Serpent Cave.Revisiting this familiar, Song Qingshu couldn\u2019t help but think of Mu Wanqing, who accompanied him here, wondering how she was doing now.One was saddened, the other was full of thoughts, and the two fell into silence in a rare tacit understanding.After coming out of the Golden Serpent Cave, Xia Qingqing gave Song Qingshu a strange look, \u201cAren\u2019t you wondering who I paid respect to?\u201dSong Qingshu thought that of course he knew, and replied, \u201cLooking at the handwriting on the tombstone, he should be the Golden Serpent Gentleman, who was a giant in the world of wulin back in the day, but I didn\u2019t expect him to be the father of Miss Youyou.\u201dXia Qingqing looked back at the distant mountains and sighed, \u201cIn the world of wulin, no matter how high your martial arts are and how famous you are, in the end all you get is a mountain of grief. It has been more than ten years, there are probably not many people who still remember his name. People may know the Golden Serpent King of the present, but who will remember him more than ten years later\u2026\u201d\u201cAt least you will remember, this is enough for him.\u201d Song Qingshu consoled her.\u201cYeah, as long as I remember him, it doesn\u2019t matter if the rest don\u2019t remember him.\u201d Xia Qingqing smiled bitterly and said to herself, \u201cNo, Ajiu will also definitely remember him\u2026\u201dThe two came all the way to Chaoyang Peak. When they saw Mu Renqing with a head full of silver hair, Xia Qingqing could no longer hold back the grief in her heart.Mu Renqing quickly helped Xia Qingqing up, and couldn\u2019t help but also burst into tears, \u201cThis teacher has also heard about what happened to Chengzhi, that hard-working child.\u201d\u201cQingqing came here this time to ask the honored Master for help as the master of Chengzhi.\u201d Xia Qingqing said through gritted teeth, while wiping away her tears.Mu Renqing hesitated for a moment, and finally sighed, \u201cAlright, this old man is about to die anyway, so I will go to the Capital to see how high Dongfang Bubai\u2019s martial art really is.\u201dXia Qingqing was shocked, \u201cQingqing does not mean that! How dare I ask honores Master take such risk with your own life, even if it is Big Brother Yuan up in the heaven, he would not agree.\u201dMu Renqing raised his hand to stop her from continuing, with a faint smile on the corner of his mouth, \u201cYou may not know, Qingqing, that boy Chengzhi\u2019s senior brother Gui Xinshu and his wife could not hold back when they heard the news of his murder, and ran directly to Yanjing. Even they didn\u2019t hesitate to take revenge for Chengzhi. As his master, how could I do less than an apprentice?\u201dXia Qingqing anxiously persuaded, \u201cHonored Master, please forgive Qingqing\u2019s offense. Master and Big Brother Yuan\u2019s martial arts are about the same. Going to the Capital this time is tantamount to hitting a stone with an egg.\u201dMu Renqing smiled and said, \u201cQingqing, you don\u2019t have to be so modest. Chengzhi had learned all the martial arts this teacher could teach, and he had combined the martial arts of your father, the Golden Serpent Gentleman and also the Iron Sword Sect. If I had a one-on-one contest with Chengzhi, I would definitely lose without a doubt.\u201d\u201cThen why are you taking risks, honored Master? Qingqing didn\u2019t come here for this\u2026\u201d Xia Qingqing thought that if his Master had any accidents, her Big Brother Yuan would definitely not forgive her.Mu Renqing looked solemn and looked into the distance with a deep gaze, \u201cThere are some things that you need to do even if you know you can\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cWhat Qingqing means to say is that, I want the honored Master to come forward and invite Feng Qingyang, the predecessor of Mount Hua Sect, to come out of his seclusion.\u201d Xia Qingqing was anxious and finally finished her sentence.\u201cMaster Feng?\u201d Mu Renqing was stunned, then looked down at Xia Qingqing, \u201cQingqing, where did you hear about the Uncle Master?\u201dXia Qingqing\u2019s expression turned a little awkward, and she pointed behind her, \u201cThat information came from this Qingqing\u2019s friend here.\u201dIt was only then that Mu Renqing noticed Song Qingshu. Seeing his steady posture and even breathing, he recognized this was obviously a master. So he quickly asked, \u201cMay I know what the young hero is called? How did you know the news about Uncle Master?\u201d\u201cThis humble one is called Song Qingshu, and I learned the news of Senior Feng only by a mere coincidence.\u201d Song Qingshu said, standing with his hands behind his back, \u201cA few months ago, this Song had the good fortune to spar against Senior Feng in Mount Hua and benefited a lot.\u201d He dared not say that he had made Feng Qingyang so angry that he almost killed him. If he did, Mu Renqing would definitely regard him as a heinous villain.\u201cUncle Master is in Mount Hua?\u201d Mu Renqing was stunned. This was a critical time of the Sword-Qi conflict in the Mount Hua Sect, and it was unknown where Feng Qingyang had gone. Since then, there has been no news of the man. Everyone thought that he had passed away, but it seems that he was still here all along.Suddenly reacting, Mu Renqing stared at Song Qingshu suspiciously, and he asked with a hint of disbelief on his face, \u201cDid Young Master Song just say that you have fought with Uncle Master Feng?\u201dIt was no wonder that he became suspicious, Feng Qingyang was famous as an unparalleled genius sword master even in the past. In his early twenties, he became the well-deserved number one master of the Mount Hua Sect. It has to be said that the Mount Hua Sect back then was not like the withered and fractured sect of today. At that time, the Mount Hua Sect was at its peak, and martial art masters came out in large numbers, and their status in the wulin was almost comparable to that of Shaolin.Moreover, Feng Qingyang\u2019s reputation was extremely brilliant. At that time, with only one sword, he was really an invincible figure in the wulin. At the age of a mere weak calf, he fought alone against the former leader of the Sun Moon Holy Cult, Ren Woxing. At the same time, he could also create the opportunity to kill the ten elders of the Sun Moon Holy Cult who attacked Mount Hua, thus creating a legend in the wulin.If he was still alive, his accumulation of internal energy in the past few decades must have entered the realm of transformation, and his knowledge of the sword might have far exceeded the worldly understanding and reached the realm of the demigods.Such was his Uncle Master, a demigod. And, this Song Qingshu was so young, but he actually said that he had fought with him! So Mu Renqing naturally didn\u2019t believe it.\u201cYes I have.\u201d Song Qingshu replied.\u201cThen allow this old man to see the peerless might of the young hero.\u201d With a sneer, Mu Renqing decided to test him.Following his movements, Song Qingshu turned slightly to the side and slightly changed the angle of his toes, but Mu Renqing immediately retreated as if he had seen the most terrifying thing.Staring at the opponent with a dignified expression, Mu Renqing knew that he had been blocked by the opponent in one move just now, and his opponent had a faint intention to fight back. His intuition told him that if he continued to move forward, he would definitely be seriously injured.\u201cYoung Master Song, be prepared.\u201d As he shouted in his heart, Mu Renqing turned his wrist gently, a sword appeared in his hand, and it stabbed forward full of the decades of hard work of his life. His dignified posture was like a mountain. His technique was like a breeze without a trace, unpredictable and swift as it stabbed at Song Qingshu.Song Qingshu was indeed a little motivated this time. He took a small step back, raised his head, and his eyes fell on the place three inches below Mu Renqing\u2019s left side.Suddenly, it was as if Mu Renqing saw an illusion, his left flank felt a little hot, and he realized that the other party had already seen through the flaws in his own move, and he would only be asking for a loss by continuing to attack, so he had to withdraw and retreat. He felt his blood rush to his face.Xia Qingqing saw that Song Qingshu hadn\u2019t attacked yet, and he forced the master to back down while dodging his two powerful attacks. \u2018Still slightly inferior to Big Brother Yuan\u2026\u2019Mu Renqing stared at Song Qingshu for a long time as if he was watching a monster, and finally sighed in defeat, \u201cYoung Master Song is still so young, yet his knowledge of swordsmanship has reached such a level, and he could truly be an opponent of Uncle Master Feng. In your movements there are similarities and the same purpose. This old man suspects that the fight between the young hero and Uncle Master Feng was a grand one. I have truly been a frog at the bottom of the well.\u201d\u201cSenior Mu is too modest, this Song is just relying on his familiarity with the swordsmanship of the Five Sacred Mountains Sword Sects, and I am not really that capable.\u201d Song Qingshu saluted by clasping his fist.\u201cTo be so young, yet not arrogant or impetuous, is rare.\u201d Mu Renqing asked with a smile, \u201cI wonder if Young Master Song knows where Uncle Marter Feng is now?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seems that Senior Feng has lived in seclusion on Cogitation Cliff for decades.\u201d\u201cCogitation Cliff?\u201d Mu Renqing showed a hesitant look on his face. Cogitation Cliff was under the domain of the Mount Hua Sect\u2019s Qi faction. As the head of the Sword faction, it was not so convenient for him to go there.After a long time, Mu Renqing sighed, \u201cForget it, if I can see Uncle Master, then it does not matter if this old man has to visit the Qi faction.\u201d\u201cIf Sect Master Mu finds it inconvenient, we can sneak up to the Cogitation Cliff, the Qi faction is not what it was in the past, and it will be difficult for them to find our traces.\u201d Seeing that Mu Renqing was full of contradictions, Song Qingshu suggested.Mu Renqing showed a look of hesitation, \u201cWe aren\u2019t doing anything shameful, so why do we have to be so sneaky? Qingqing, please follow me to the Jade Maiden Peak to meet the faction head Yue, if Young Master Song is interested, you can come along too. .\u201d After saying that, he waved his sleeves and went straight to the Jade Maiden Peak.Xia Qingqing turned around and stuck out her tongue at Song Qingshu, and hurriedly ran after Mu Renqing.\u201cThese ancient people are too upright and have a lot of useless tricks.\u201d Song Qingshu was already being very kind, but this guy acted as if they didn\u2019t even need his help, so he was very uncomfortable. Fortunately, after seeing Xia Qingqing acting like a young maiden, he was overjoyed and followed.After receiving a notification from his disciples, Yue Buqun learned that the head of the Sword faction had come to visit in person. Yue Buqun hurriedly greeted him, but he was in shock, \u2018The two factions have not communicated with each other for decades. So why now?\u2019Song Qingshu saw a person in the middle dressed as a scholar in a green robe, with a long beard under his chin. His face was giving off a righteous aura.Song Qingshu thought that it was no wonder that this guy was famously nicknamed \u201cGentleman Sword\u201d in the wulin. He was very good at keeping up appearances.The group was greeted by the Chongxiao Hall of the Mount Hua Sect. Mu Renqing had not set foot on the Jade Maiden Peak for decades. Looking at the familiar grass and trees along the way, he seemed to have gone in a trance. When Mu Renqing saw the words \u201cSword Qi Rising to the Sky\u201d on the hanging plaque, he couldn\u2019t control his emotions anymore and tears filled his eyes.Seeing Mu Renqing\u2019s excited appearance, Yue Buqun also became filled with emotion, and coughed lightly, \u201cMay I know what Senior Brother Mu wanted from this Yue\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, Yue Buqun glanced at Song Qingshu in the corner. And, as if he had seen a demon, he pulled out his saber and pointed at Song Qingshu, gritted his teeth and said, \u201cEmperor\u2019s dog, how dare you come here!\u201dThe disciples of the Mount Hua Sect did not know why, but when they saw their master drawing his sword, they also surrounded Song Qingshu in the middle.\u201cHey, hey, Sect Leader Yue, I\u2019m not that familiar with you, I\u2019ll sue you for slander if you call me that.\u201d Song Qingshu was depressed by his accusations.\u201cIn the battle of Mount Tai, you, as the Qing court\u2019s dog, forced the Mount Tai Sect to submit to the Qing court, and indirectly killed the leader of the rebel army, the Golden Serpent King\u2026\u201d\u201cStop, stop!\u201d Song Qingshu glanced back at Xia Qingqing, saw her expressionless face, and secretly broke into a cold sweat, \u201cOn the top of the Jade Emperor Peak, this Song defeated the masters you sent in a fair and honest way, what\u2019s wrong with that? As for the matter of the death of the Golden Serpent King, I had nothing to do with that. Damn, don\u2019t just go putting such a big sh*it pot on me.\u201dMu Renqing, who was on the side, thought about Feng Qingyang on the cliff, so he didn\u2019t want to make a mess, and he quickly persuaded, \u201cSect Leader Yue, Young Master Song has no malicious intent on this visit. This Mu has learned a great secret of the Mount Hua Sect from him. I came here to ask Sect Leader Yue for his cooperation.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Yue Buqun\u2019s expression turned serious, and he quickly raised his head and instructed his disciples, \u201cYou all go out first.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d That group of Mount Hua Sect disciples retreated.\u201cMy presence is not needed here, you guys can talk slowly, I\u2019ll go out to get some fresh air first.\u201d Song Qingshu stood up, stretched, and swaggered out.Xia Qingqing wanted to stop him, but after hesitating for a moment, she only watched his back disappear at the door.Walking out of the Chongxiao Hall, Song Qingshu glanced at the disciples of the Sect in the martial arts practice ground, and asked curiously, \u201cWhich one of you is Linghu Chong?\u201dThe disciples in the practice ground nervously looked at each other. After a while, a pretty girl stuck her head out and asked, \u201cWhy are you looking for Senior Brother?\u201dThis girl had a beautiful face and a pair of black eyes. Song Qingshu smiled slightly, \u201cThis must be Miss Yue, this humble one is Linghu Chong\u2019s friend, and I want to have a drink with him.\u201d\u201cHmph, stop lying.\u201d Yue Lingshan wrinkled her nose, \u201cYou obviously don\u2019t even know what my senior brother looks like, how could you be his friend.\u201d\u201cCould it be that Miss Yue doesn\u2019t know that there are many ways to bear good will in this world?\u201d Song Qingshu laughed, \u201cI am not only a friend of Linghu Chong, but also know that he is thinking about a certain girl very much.\u201dYue Lingshan also knew a thing or two about her elder brother\u2019s intentions. When she heard Song Qingshu say it, she couldn\u2019t help but blush. She was about to refute, but she didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cWhat rude words!\u201d With a cold voice, a young man with pretty eyebrows and handsome looks came out of the crowd, protecting Yue Lingshan behind him.\u201cAre you a man or a woman?\u201d Song Qingshu stared at him blankly.The young man hated being seen as a woman the most in his life. He was furious when he heard the words, he drew his sword and stabbed at his opponent, but when the tip of the sword was three inches in front of the opponent, he could no longer move forward.Song Qingshu\u2019s two fingers shook, and a domineering energy was sent forth. The young man only felt that his hands turned numb, and he could no longer hold the sword in his hand, his body became unstable and fell backwards.Yue Lingshan hurriedly stepped forward to support him. The group of senior brothers in the crowd looked at Song Qingshu in horror. The martial arts displayed by the other party were far beyond their comprehension.Looking at the \u201cMount Hua Lin Pingzhi\u201d engraved on the sword, Song Qingshu was in a trance for a while, then raised his head and looked at Lin Pingzhi again.When he read the original book, he almost thought that this guy was the protagonist of The Smiling, Proud Wanderer. Although Lin Pingzhi\u2019s face gave him a weak womanly aura, his heart was unusually sturdy. When Song Qingshu was desperate, Lin Pingzhi\u2019s phrase \u201cI would rather be a beggar than a thief\u201d made his blood boil for a long time.Song Qingshu admired Lin Pingzhi\u2019s style very much, but unfortunately in the original book, he held a deep blood feud, and when he learned that his beloved master had been using him for his family\u2019s Bixie Swordplay Manual. This bright and upright hero turned into a gloomy and treacherous villain.\u201cYou\u2019re Lin Pingzhi? Come with me, I have something to tell you.\u201d Song Qingshu turned around and walked a few steps, noticing that there was no movement behind him, he couldn\u2019t help but snort coldly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, no courage?\u201dPeople in all corners of the world have always coveted the Lin family\u2019s Bixie Swordplay Manual. When he saw Song Qingshu recognize him, he subconsciously took precautions, but when he heard the other party\u2019s taunt, he said with resentment, \u201cWhy won\u2019t I dare!\u201d He waved his hand to stop Yue Lingshan who was pulling him back. His footsteps firmly followed behind Song Qingshu.When the two came to a secluded place, Lin Pingzhi saw that there was no one around, raised his head and said, \u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201dSong Qingshu turned around and stared at Lin Pingzhi and looked at him carefully. Seeing that the other party was already impatient, he smiled and said, \u201cYoung man, I was surprised by your bone structure, you must be a martial arts prodigy. The responsibility of justice and peace in the universe is entrusted upon your shoulders!\u201d(Goblin: The protagonist is being a troll again -_-)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Flower Stealing MasterCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: Ways of being mysteriousLin Pingzhi just looked back at him vigilantly and did not speak.Song Qingshu was bored and didn\u2019t care about how suspicious he looked, so he continued, \u201cI have a set of sword techniques here, and I will show you the complete set of swordsmanship. If you want to learn it or not, it\u2019s up to you.\u201dAfter speaking, without waiting for the other party to answer, he readied his wooden sword, and moved the sword lightly.At first Lin Pingzhi thought that the other party was teasing him, but after watching for a while, he found that the other party was indeed showing him a set of exquisite sword technique, and it was much more advanced than what his master usually taught him.While trying to follow Song Qingshu\u2019s movements, Lin Pingzhi\u2019s temples were sweating slightly. He only felt that he remembered a certain move and then forgot that move. After memorising dozens of moves, he even forgot the previously memorized moves. There was a profound martial art in front of him, but he couldn\u2019t remember it at all, that endless regret and despair arose spontaneously in his heart.After Song Qingshu finished his demonstration, he looked at Lin Pingzhi, who was sweating profusely, and asked, \u201cHow much did you remember?\u201dLin Pingzhi\u2019s lips were bleeding from being bitten by his teeth, and he said angrily, \u201cI didn\u2019t remember anything.\u201dThis time, it was Song Qingshu\u2019s turn to be stunned, and subconsciously said, \u201cI really want to worship you as a pig deity.\u201dHearing his words, Lin Pingzhi felt even more embarrassed. After a while his expression turned red to blue, then it turned so pale that he looked like a corpse.Seeing Lin Pingzhi\u2019s appearance, Song Qingshu seemed to go into a trance. He remembered a scene in his previous life where he went to a martial artist to learn martial arts on a whim. Before learning, he imagined that he was a genius like the protagonists of martial arts novels, and he could learn it by seeing it once. As a result, the martial artist taught him one move after another. After seven or eight moves, he forgot what the first move was. The frustration due to reality made that incident unforgettable forever.Wasn\u2019t Lin Pingzhi just an ordinary person without all those fancy plot armour of the protagonist? Song Qingshu showed a smile and comforted him, \u201cYour martial arts level is too low now, and I don\u2019t blame you for not remembering these advanced swordsmanship techniques. Well, I have another method, you just have to look into my eyes.\u201dLin Pingzhi raised his head subconsciously and saw the dark and deep pupils of the other party. His eyes suddenly became dazed, and his whole person seemed to enter an empty space.Suddenly, the figure of Song Qingshu appeared in front of him, and the other party smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m using the Bewitching Technique to imprint the sword technique in your mind, but as it\u2019s not your own yet, it\u2019ll just be convenient for you when you are in doubt. For now, it\u2019ll fulfill the purpose of inquiry, only after you have mastered it, can you truly learn this sword technique.\u201dLin Pingzhi heard it in his dazed state, and he had all kinds of doubts in his heart.He didn\u2019t know why, but this time he just felt like he was in a daze. But he remembered every detail clearly.There was a sound of snapping fingers in his ear, Lin Pingzhi woke up from the haze. With a thought, every move and every style of the swordsmanship clearly came to his mind, and he couldn\u2019t help but look at Song Qingshu in surprise, \u201cI remember, I remembered!\u201d\u201cYour martial arts foundation is too poor. You can only get revenge against Yu Canghai after practicing this sword technique for three years. Remember! If you can learn the internal techniques of Mount Hua Sect in the meantime, with internal strength as a foundation, you should be able to get twice the result with half the effort.\u201d Song Qingshu thought for a while then reminded him solemnly. (Goblin: Yu Canghai is the leader of the Qingcheng Sect. After Lin Pingzhi accidentally killed his son in a brawl, he led the Qingcheng Sect to massacre the Lin family.)\u201cThree years?\u201d Lin Pingzhi was full of surprises. With his current martial arts speed, he was afraid that might not be able to avenge his revenge on Yu Canghai before he died of old age. Now Song Qingshu told him that after three years of hard work, he could get what he wanted. How could he not be ecstatic?\u201cBy the way, don\u2019t tell anyone about the things I told you about martial arts, including your master.\u201d Song Qingshu was still a little worried when he thought of the wily Yue Buqun.\u201cYes! Your great kindness and great virtue, this Pingzhi will never forget it!\u201d Lin Pingzhi knelt on the ground and respectfully kowtowed three times.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, it\u2019s just a small effort for me.\u201d Song Qingshu turned sideways to hide.\u201cIt was nothing for the benefactor, but for Pingzhi, it is a new chance at life.\u201d Lin Pingzhi said sternly.\u201cOkay, go back quickly, or that Miss Yue is going to be worried.\u201d Song Qingshu said jokingly.Lin Pingzhi\u2019s face turned red, he just took a few steps towards the training grounds, then he suddenly turned around, and asked with a complicated expression, \u201cWhy did the benefactor help me?\u201d\u201cOriginally, you and I were both pitiful people, maybe that\u2019s why I feel sympathetic towards you.\u201d Song Qingshu seemed to be separated from this world when he said these words.Lin Pingzhi nodded as if he didn\u2019t really understand, and greeted Yue Lingshan who was running over.Back at the Chongxiao Hall, Yue Buqun and Mu Renqing had already negotiated and decided to visit Feng Qingyang together on Cognition Cliff.Although Feng Qingyang belonged to the sword faction, Yue Buqun thought that if a sword master lived in seclusion in Mount Hua, then he naturally wouldn\u2019t have to worry all day that Mount Hua Sect will be directly destroyed by Zuo Lengchan, so he was also eager to go to Cognition Cliff to prove the existence of Feng Qingyang.After the group came to the Cognition Cliff, Mu Renqing used his inner strength to spread his voice all over the mountain, \u201cMu Renqing, the descendant of the Mount Hua Sword Sect, asks to see the Uncle Master.\u201dYue Buqun on the side secretly admired that although the sword faction practised with mainly swordsmanship and movement techniques, the Primordial Chaos Skill they practiced was not inferior to the Qi factions internal energy cultivation techniques.Mu Renqing shouted three times in a row, but there was no response at all. The group looked at each other and stared at Song Qingshu.Seeing Xia Qingqing\u2019s expression, Song Qingshu gave a wry smile and shrugged, \u201cThe things I do for love.\u201dAfter speaking, he tapped into his dantian and shouted with more vigorous inner strength, \u201cOld man Feng, I\u2019m back again, last time I was careless and I just lost to your move, this time I won\u2019t be merciful, come come come, we will fight three times and a hundred rounds\u2026\u201dXia Qingqing\u2019s face had a black line, and the faces of the Mount Hua Sect disciples turned ugly. At this moment, a cold snort was heard, \u201cYou overestimate your own strength!\u201dThe voice seemed soft and weak, but it could clearly reach everyone\u2019s ears despite Song Qingshu\u2019s thunderous roar. Yue Buqun\u2019s complexion changed, \u2018I didn\u2019t expect that the Primordial Chaos Skill practiced to the extreme could reach such a state.\u2019As soon as he finished speaking, a white-bearded and green-robed old man appeared at the corner of a large rock, with a depressed expression and a golden complexion.\u201cDisciple Mu Renqing (Yue Buqun) pays respects to Master Feng.\u201d Seeing his appearance, although there were traces of the passing years, they still didn\u2019t have trouble recognizing the person who was the number one master in swordsmanship.Feng Qingyang waved his sleeves, and the two of them only felt a soft energy lifting them up, and they admired him even more greatly.Looking at the heads of the two factions, Feng Qingyang had a complicated expression and sighed, \u201cI missed the Sword Qi martial arts competition, which caused the sword faction to be almost wiped out. I really have no face to see the people of the sword faction. Today If not\u2026\u201d After speaking, he gave Song Qingshu a vicious look.Song Qingshu felt his hair standing up when he saw the look, and he quickly pushed Xia Qingqing forward, and said with a smirk, \u201cThis time it\u2019s your disciple who has something to ask you, and it\u2019s none of my business.\u201dGoblin: With this release I\u2019ve reached the 100th chapter of this novel. I would have preferred to reach this milestone in better circumstances. I had many things planned for this occasion. But, being at the mercy of reality, it didn\u2019t go according to plan.Anyways, I still remember the day I posted the first chapter. I built the site on my own without any prior experiences. It was a lot of trial and errors and thank god for WordPress being easy to understand.Now, I want to thank all the readers who have been with me since day one. I want to express my sincere gratitude to all the Patrons at Patreon and to all the readers who sponsored chapters. It really helps me a lot. It gives me strength to go on. So, I again thank you all!I hope you all will be with me on this journey in the future as well. I pray that you all stay safe and healthy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But who knew he was killed by the hands of Dongfang Bubai\u201dFeng Qingyang said suspiciously, \u201cI have also observed this Yuan Chengzhi you speak of secretly. His martial arts level was no longer under the master of the Sun Moon Holy Cult. How did Dongfang Bubai kill him so easily?\u201d\u201cHis speed is too fast,\u201d Xia Qingqing hurriedly told Feng Qingyang all the information she had obtained, \u201cAccording to the reflection of Master Fang Zheng, who was present that day, the speed of Dongfang Bubai has exceeded the limit of human beings. Brother Chengzhi didn\u2019t have any chance from the beginning, so\u2026\u201d Xia Qingqing couldn\u2019t speak any longer, she covered her mouth, and stood there sobbing silently.As for the many young disciples on the cliff, they saw a beautiful and devoted young woman standing there sorrowfully, her long skirt was touching the ground, her clothes were blowing in the wind, a small white flower was inserted on the hair of her temples, and the petals trembled slightly with the breeze\u2026 They couldn\u2019t help but feel her sadness.\u201cBrother Song was at the scene that day, so you can ask him about the specific situation.\u201d Xia Qingqing wiped away her tears and pointed at Song Qingshu.\u201cThere\u2019s also that Zuo Lengchan,\u201d Feng Qingyang looked puzzled and looked at Song Qingshu, \u201cI heard that on the day of the fight, you defeated Daoist Chongxu with one sword strike?\u201d\u201cIt was just a fluke.\u201d Song Qingshu seemed a little embarrassed.\u201cI have seen the swordsmanship of Daoist Chongxu,\u201d Feng Qingyang stood there with his hands behind his back, \u201cIt is continuous and has few flaws. He can be regarded as a first-class sword master in the wulin. You can actually beat him with one sword strike. Have you progressed that much since we fought last time? What adventure did you have to achieve such results?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that this junior used tricks and schemes. In a real fight, it would take a hundred moves to decide the winner.\u201d Song Qingshu said frankly.\u201cTrick?\u201d Feng Qingyang was stunned for a moment, then suddenly realized, \u201cI understand, you must have motivated him to defend with all his strength from the very beginning. His Taiji Swordplay has a huge flaw that ordinary people can\u2019t see, but his swordsmanship is far superior. You can indeed defeat him with that tactic.\u201d\u201cOld Feng recreated the scene of the day with just a few words from this junior. This junior is awed and admires your intellect.\u201d Song Qingshu looked at him in surprise.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to flatter this old man so much. I\u2019ll settle the account with you later. You can talk about how Yuan Chengzhi and Dongfang Bubai fought against each other that day.\u201d Feng Qingyang asked with a frown.\u201cDongfang Bubai was extremely fast. There were no more than three people on the top of the Jade Emperor Peak who could clearly see his movements. Master Yuan happened to be one of them. Even so, his speed was still not as fast as Dongfang Bubai. He kept changing his position to avoid Dongfang Bubai\u2019s attack. However, Dongfang Bubai\u2019s movement was more subtle than his superb ability, and the attack came from any angle from all directions. In desperation, Master Yuan had to use the Golden Serpent Sword technique to protect his whole body, but this move consumes a lot of internal energy. Under the all-round siege of Dongfang Bubai, Master Yuan\u2019s movement space was compressed smaller and smaller, and finally the inevitable happened\u2026\u201d Song Qingshu talked eloquently, and for the first time, the details of the fight of that day were revealed to the ears of the public.Yue Buqun was ashamed to hear it. He didn\u2019t see anything except a red shadow and a golden light that day. He didn\u2019t expect Song Qingshu to see the battle so clearly at a young age.\u201cIn the world of martial arts, there is nothing that can\u2019t be broken through, and only speed is an exception.\u201d Feng Qingyang murmured to himself, \u201cWhen it reaches a certain level, the flaws in the technique are no longer flaws, it seems that it can only be stopped by static\u2026 \u201c\u201cOld Feng, don\u2019t blame me for saying something depressing. I\u2019ve fought against both of you. The pressure you put on me is far less than the pressure he put on me.\u201d Song Qingshu hesitated for a moment, but still reminded him.As soon as this remark came out, everyone was shocked. Xia Qingqing had nothing to say. She had seen Dongfang Bubai several times. Mu Renqing and Yue Buqun had always been terrified by Dongfang Bubai\u2019s ghost-like martial arts.Yue Buqun\u2019s disciples were even more shocked. Lin Pingzhi was glad that he was able to get such a first-class master in the world to teach him martial arts. But Yue Lingshan was shocked that the other party was not much older than her, but he was already able to compete with the first master of their sect. Her pair of big round eyes kept trembling, not knowing what to think.Feng Qingyang\u2019s face showed his embarrassment, \u201cWith your movement technique, it is not a big problem to escape from Dongfang Bubai.\u201d At the beginning, he suffered a loss due to that and that was regarded as a great disgrace for him.\u201cOld Feng, don\u2019t look down on people like that, okay?\u201d Song Qingshu felt that his face was hurt and retorted: \u201cI fought against him twice, the first time was a complete defeat, and the second time I injured him seriously and he even vomited blood.\u201dFeng Qingyang looked obviously disbelieving, and sneered, \u201cThe last time you fought, your martial arts were exquisite, but they were mixed and impure, and there was still a little gap between you and Yuan Chengzhi. So how could you hurt Dongfang Bubai?\u201dYue Buqun and Mu Renqing nodded, agreeing with Feng Qingyang\u2019s judgment.Xia Qingqing recalled the details of that night, hesitated for a moment, and then opened her lips lightly, \u201cI can testify for Big Brother Song, after he fought against Dongfang Bubai last time, he was seriously injured, and there was blood on Dongfang Bubai\u2019s clothes. It seemed that he was badly injured\u2026\u201dSong Qingshu smiled smugly, \u201cThere you have it. I even have a witness.\u201dFeng Qingyang squinted his eyes and said indifferently, \u201cBoy, I would like to see how far your martial arts have progressed now.\u201d As soon as he finished speaking, a gentle inner strength spread out, and everyone in the Mount Hua Sect had to scramble and empty the field.Song Qingshu\u2019s face stiffened and hesitantly said, \u201cOld Feng, you have to think about it carefully. Although I will definitely lose in the end, I am afraid it will not be so easy for you to win. If you accidentally get injured, you will be disadvantaged in your fight against Dongfang Bubai. It\u2019s not that wise to be injured before the final battle.\u201dFeng Qingyang smiled lightly, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to really fight for this competition.\u201dSong Qingshu was stunned for a moment, then he suddenly realized something, and said with a smile, \u201cThis junior has been ignorant.\u201dSeeing that he understood his meaning so quickly, Feng Qingyang glanced at him with admiration. His eyelids drooped, his hands folded, although the wind on the top of the mountain was not small, but it couldn\u2019t blow his clothes.Song Qingshu\u2019s expression changed, and he clasped his fists and said, \u201cPlease forgive this junior for offending.\u201d After speaking, he stepped forward.Feng Qingyang\u2019s eyelids trembled, but Song Qingshu took two steps back as if facing a great enemy.When one move failed, Song Qingshu was not annoyed, he stepped forward with his left foot and slowly moved forward. Feng Qingyang\u2019s right shoulder sank back slightly, and the left half of his body trembled. Song Qingshu, however, with a dignified expression, retracted his left foot, drew a semi-circle on the spot, and slowly raised his right foot.Yue Lingshan, who was on the side, thought that there would be a thrilling battle, but after seeing the two of them standing still for a long time, she suddenly felt extremely bored, came behind her father, and asked, \u201cFather, why haven\u2019t they begun fighting yet? What about the competition?\u201d\u201cThey have already made a move.\u201d Yue Buqun explained with a solemn expression, the realm of the two of them was far beyond his own, but fortunately he was familiar with the Five Sacred Mountain Swordsmanship, otherwise he would not have been able to understand anything.After a stick of incense time passed, Song Qingshu took a step back and said respectfully, \u201cThis junior lost. I didn\u2019t know how high the heavens were before, but today I saw the true level of my seniors, and I am convinced.\u201dFeng Qingyang accepted his salute calmly, turned around and disappeared on the spot, and a cold voice came from a distance, \u201cSpeak on behalf of this old man, next month on the fifteenth night, on the night of the full moon, on the peak of the Forbidden City, this old man will definitely pay a visit to Cult Master Dongfang.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
