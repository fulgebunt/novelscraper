    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: White Grubs\"1023, no, 1025\u2014!\"Light flashed within the damp cave, and a silvery arc parted the jelly-like flesh of a white grub in half. The flesh evaporated into the air in a white mist.The youth picked up the white half-orb that remained, wiped it off on his grubby hemp tunic, popped it straight into his mouth, chewed slightly, then swallowed woodenly.[You successfully killed a white grub, but did not obtain a soulshard. For consuming the flesh of a white grub, you received no basic gene fragments.]Zhang Lie: a mortal lifeformFramework: Foundation, Lv. 10Genes: Basic, 20Soulshards: NoneHave I consumed too much white-grub flesh?\u00a0Zhang Lie wondered to himself.In truth, it had been three months since Zhang Lie was last able to obtain gene fragments from white-grub flesh. Considering his current growth, white-grub flesh was nothing more than ordinary food, providing only basic energy and nutrients.White grubs were the most basic of bug-type lifeforms. In fact, they were much like what the online games of the past would call 'slimes'. A single grub consisted of a soft core the color and consistency of white jade, surrounded by a layer of jelly-like flesh.After three months of relentless slaughter, Zhang Lie was so familiar with their body structure that he could kill them with a careless wave of his sword.As he glanced at the white grubs that filled the entire cave, Zhang Lie let out a huge sigh. \"It's been three months since I reincarnated, but I still haven't managed a breakthrough with my foundation. And where am I supposed to find the superior-grade white grub that's rumored to be around here somewhere?\"Zhang Lie couldn't help but feel a little deflated as he inspected the warped blade of his sword. It was little more than a piece of scrap metal now. He'd swung it around thousands of times a day, so it was natural that it would warp\u2014but, more importantly, the sword had been the cheapest one he could afford at the time.It was nearing nighttime, and Zhang Lie had no choice but to return to the nearby settlement. The dimensional world was particularly dangerous at night.At the start of the last century, the Milky Way had been beset by war and strife. Alien races had forced mankind into more and more hostile locales, but, just as all hope was lost, a series of mysterious portals was discovered within ancient ruins. Humans who passed through these portals would be transported into what would become known as the dimensional world.Curiously, no electronics were usable in the dimensional world. Firearms, missiles, and even nuclear weapons simply stopped functioning. Amidst a bevy of lifeforms that had reached the peak of evolution and genetic enhancement, mankind became the lowest level on the food chain.It was only when a lone hunter fortuitously slew a relatively weak beast that the secret of the dimensional world was revealed: as the will of the world was transmitted into his mind, his body underwent an earth-shattering change.Humans quickly realized that, as they gathered more genetic fragments, their lifespan would increase. Thus began a new era, one dominated by genetic enhancement.The Blacksteel settlement was a small-scale human settlement within the dimensional world, only a ten-minute walk from the white-grub cave. The imposing steel gates were criss-crossed with scars, a reminder of the strife and struggle that had been overcome since the settlement's founding.As Zhang Lie stepped through the gates, he was immediately recognized by one of the teams of hunters resting near it and quickly welcomed with a bout of mocking laughter.\"Look who's here, the king of the dumps!\"\"When I first entered the dimensional world, he was already at the bottom of the gene leaderboard\u2014and he's been there all this time!\"\"If I were him, I wouldn't be so thick-skinned as to remain here.\"\"There's trash everywhere you go, isn't there? Maybe he'll still be at the bottom even when I'm fifty!\"\"Fifty? Even if you lived to two hundred, nothing would change about this fellow's ranking!\"A skinny hunter turned to an attractive girl beside him. \"Wang Xiaohua, I heard that you were childhood friends with this guy?\"\u00a0[1]Wang Xiaohua had lowered her head upon seeing him, her face flushed red with shame. Her teammate's callous remark instantly caused her to yell out, \"Childhood friends? How could someone like me, Wang Xiaohua, ever favor such a trashy fellow?! It was just that my dad pitied them and was generous enough to let them stay in one of our lodgings\u2014nothing to do with me, you hear?\"Zhang Lie scoffed to himself as he passed by, not saying a word in retaliation. There was no need for him to interact with fools. If a dog were to bite him, was he to bite back? Zhang Lie would probably work himself to death if he actually followed such a policy\u2014after all, there were too many wild dogs roaming around the dimensional world.He raised his head to the electronic screen set up in the middle of the settlement, the so-called \"gene leaderboard\" that the hunters had been discussing.#1: Yun Bing, 12000 strength#2: Chu Feng, 11950 strength#3: Qin Xiao, 11900 strengthHunters were ranked on the gene leaderboard based on the number of gene fragments and soulshards they possessed, which were directly correlated with their attack power.At present, Zhang Lie might be the lowest of the low, but an ugly duckling would eventually undergo a metamorphosis. He didn't care about idle gossip; after all, as a reincarnator, he had a decisive advantage over any other hunter. His genetic enhancement plan had been perfectly optimized, and he was now only waiting for the chance opportunity that would be his first step to advancement.He approached the point-conversion counter situated near the middle of the settlement and placed half the white-grub cores that he had gathered over the last three months within the metal box displayed prominently on it.As the lid shut automatically, words appeared on the electronic screen before him. [For donating a thousand basic gene fragments, you received a thousand points.]The settlement was constructed of a unique material that restored electronic functionality within the settlement, but fighting was strictly prohibited. Any offenders would be swiftly punished by the robotic guards hosted within the settlement.Zhang Lie stored his remaining half of the white-grub cores in the settlement storehouse, an integral part of his future plan. \"Craft me a C-grade steel blade, then convert the remaining points into money.\"[A C-grade steel blade will cost 800 points. The remaining points will be converted into 20,000 dollars.] As the synthetic voice spoke, the lid of the box slid open once more, revealing a sword and a stack of red dollar notes.Subsequently, he passed through the teleportation device and returned to the slums of the city of Ning. Technology had advanced to the point that each household would own a teleportation device, just as they would a television. At only a few hundred dollars each, they were relatively cheap.Zhang Lie walked out to see a girl of flawless beauty quietly reading in a wheelchair. She evoked grace and purity with every action, as though she were a flower carefully cultivated by the heavens themselves.\u00a0[2]As she heard the teleportation device activate, she raised her head and smiled beatifically. \"Welcome home, Brother!\"Zhang Lie, usually cold and aloof, mirrored her smile. \"How've you been?\"\"Well, of course.\"He caressed his sister's pale cheeks, and she nuzzled back like a small kitten.Zhang Hanxiang was Zhang Lie's sister. Ever since their parents had gone missing, she and Zhang Lie had had to survive on their own. Her legs had been paralyzed from birth, but she was otherwise hale.\"Brother, let me warm you a meal.\"\"There's no need\u2014it'd be inconvenient for you. I've already eaten in the dimensional world. Do you remember how long I've been gone?\"Time flowed about ten times faster in the dimensional world.\"You've been gone for ten days, Brother.\"\"Where's Madam Zhao?\"\"She's long since left. It's quite late at night, after all.\"Zhang Lie nodded, then handed her a bundle of money. \"Here's 8,000 dollars for this month's living expenses. Please pass it to Madam Zhao on my behalf.\"Because it was inconvenient for his sister to move around, and because Zhang Lie had to hunt in the dimensional world for a living, he needed to find some sort of caretaker for his sister. He had reached out to his neighbor, Madam Zhao, for help: in this case, nothing more than bringing her food on a daily basis.\"It'll be your birthday in another six months or so. Is there anything you'd like as a present?\"\"I don't need anything, Brother, except to remain at your side.\" She clasped her brother's palms within her own.Even though the traces of a smile still hung on Zhang Lie's face, worry had crept into his eyes.His sister would be turning 18 soon. By law, upon adulthood\u2014upon reaching 18 years of age\u2014she would have to enter the dimensional world. The dimensional world was filled with strife and death, and it wasn't something his pure, sheltered sister could get accustomed to, not to mention her inability to walk.In his previous life, he hadn't managed to protect his sister, and had been forced to watch her tragic death. In this life, he swore he wouldn't repeat the same mistakes.Of course, there were ways of bypassing the laws. Certain special-class citizens had the authority to prevent one of their direct relatives from having to hunt in the dimensional world. When he grew into his power, when he had enough authority to shield his sister from any harm that could befall her\u2014only then could he bear the thought of his sister entering that cruel world.At the dawn of the last century, the united world federation began segregating citizens based on the number of gene fragments they possessed. Those who had reached their basic gene capacity were standard citizens, with the benefits afforded to those of their rank; those who had reached their mutated gene capacity were first-class citizens; and those who had reached their superior gene capacity were special-class citizens.Zhang Lie's gaze landed on the books stacked beside his sister's wheelchair. She was very fond of reading, and intended on becoming a researcher or author in the future. Their parents had only been standard citizens; in order for her to attend the best high schools, he would have to become a first-class citizen.He had wasted too much time since his rebirth. When he entered the dimensional world tomorrow, if he remained unable to find the rumored superior-grade white grub within the damp cave, he would have no choice but to give up on his plan. Nothing was more important to him than his sister, after all.Suddenly, a few knocks sounded from outside. Zhang Lie opened the door and found, to his surprise, Wang Xiaohua. Frowning, he asked, \"Why are you here?\"In disgust, Wang Xiaohua replied, \"Do you think I would come to a ramshackle place like this of my own volition?\"His sister pushed her wheelchair to Zhang Lie's side. \"Long time no see, Sister Xiaohua.\"Wang Xiaohua's gaze landed on Zhang Hanxiang's paralyzed legs, making no effort to hide her disdain. Her lips twisted in a mocking smile.Zhang Lie narrowed his eyes. He didn't care what others thought of him, but he couldn't stand their contempt toward his sister. If not for their childhood friendship, Zhang Lie would already have made a move.Wang Xiaohua harrumphed coldly. She pushed Zhang Lie aside and strode into the house, announcing scornfully, \"What sort of unkempt mess is this? It's almost as bad as a pigsty! But of course I couldn't have expected any better from you, Zhang Lie.\"Zhang Lie's features resolved into calm hostility. \"If you're here only to mock our living conditions, then you're not welcome. Please leave immediately.\"\"As I've said, would I drag myself here without any reason? I'm here to reclaim this property.\"Zhang Lie and Zhang Hanxiang both recoiled in shock.Wang Xiaohua retrieved a sheaf of papers from her handbag. \"I found a rental contract at home\u2014and, guess what? It turns out that your rental period is almost up.\"Zhang Lie took the proffered contract and scanned it, a frown gradually marring his face.Wang Xiaohua smirked. \"According to the contract, this property was leased to your family for eighteen years. Now that the eighteen years are up, it's time for you to vacate these premises.\"1. Wang Xiaohua (\u738b\u5c0f\u82b1) is the type of name you'd find for a female character in a grade schooler's essay, so you can clearly tell that she's doomed.\u00a0\u261c2.

    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: Housing CrisisZhang Lie did know about the rental contract, but he had been so focused on his personal advancement plan that he hadn't realized Wang Xiaohua would come for him so quickly.Zhang Lie and Wang Xiaohua's fathers were very close friends, and Zhang Lie's father had apparently saved Wang Xiaohua's father's life before. The two families had always been friendly, and Zhang Lie and Wang Xiaohua had indeed been childhood friends.In his past life, they had even been in an ill-fated relationship\u2014one that ended when Wang Xiaohua had become besotted with the younger cousin of Qin Xiao, a notable fighter near the top of the gene leaderboard, and had run off with him.After his rebirth, Zhang Lie had spent all his time cooped up in the damp white-grub cave, and the fledgling relationship between him and Wang Xiaohua had naturally never developed.Life was hard, and living a good life was even harder. It was natural for Wang Xiaohua to want to seek a better life by giving up on Zhang Lie, but he couldn't tolerate her trying to evict him and his sister and leaving them homeless.\"And if we were to pay to continue renting this place?\"\"Ha! In that case, you'd need my permission.\"Behind Zhang Lie, Zhang Hanxiang begged, \"Sister Xiaohua, please don't kick us out. Where would we live?\"\"Oh, the streets? An underground park? I'm sure you'd be able to find a place.\"Zhang Lie sucked in a deep breath, repressing his instinctive desire to hit her. \"Fine, Wang Xiaohua, what do you want?\"\"Leave the Blacksteel settlement\u2014I never want to see you again! Do you know how revolted I feel every time I look at you? How ashamed I am that I know someone like you?\"To leave the Blacksteel settlement would ruin Zhang Lie's plans completely. His living expenses were obtained by killing lifeforms surrounding the Blacksteel settlement. If he were to leave, he wouldn't be able to get any money for rent, and he would never be able to improve his fortunes.\"If I did so, we wouldn't have enough money to feed ourselves.\"\"Oh? You're tall and strong, aren't you? As long as you're not a cripple like your sister, you'll be able to get by with manual labor, surely. I'm doing this for your own good. Given how low you are on the gene leaderboard anyway, do you really think you'll be able to make a name for yourself? Really, take a look in the mirror! I'm saving you, you hear? What if you were to die in the dimensional world? No one would bring your corpse back!\"\"My survival is none of your business.\"\"Ah? Why are you being so stubborn? Hanxiang, has he not told you anything? Your brother's at the very bottom of the gene leaderboard! Won't you persuade him to face reality? Not everyone's well equipped to deal with such a cutthroat world, after all.\" Seeing Zhang Lie's stubborn stance, Wang Xiaohua switched targets to Zhang Hanxiang.Before his sister could reply, however, Zhang Lie stepped in front of her, blocking her from Wang Xiaohua's view. \"Wang Xiaohua, I'm warning you, don't make matters worse.\"Wang Xiaohua put her hands on her hips. \"And so what if I do? Do you want to be evicted?\"Zhang Hanxiang tugged on the hem of Wang Xiaohua's blouse. \"Sister Xiaohua, please, let us stay here for just a while longer.\"With a nauseated expression on her face, Wang Xiaohua kicked at her wheelchair. \"Scram! Don't touch me, you invalid! Do you think you can afford to pay for my blouse if you damage it? You're a cripple, your brother's nothing but trash\u2014both of you are failures as human beings!\"A crisp smack reverberated around the room. Blinded by rage, Zhang Lie had slapped Wang Xiaohua on the face before consciously realizing what he was doing.Wang Xiaohua clutched her swollen face in shock as she screamed, \"Zhang Lie! How dare you hit me?!\"Despite the fact that she had more gene fragments than Zhang Lie, the killing intent in his eyes was such that she didn't dare to retaliate.Zhang Lie sucked in another deep breath, attempting to quell his anger.On the other hand, Wang Xiaohua returned to her most practiced fighting style: words. \"Zhang Lie, I offered you clemency\u2014I told you that, if you left the Blacksteel settlement, I'd let you two parasites continue to stay in this place. It's not any better than a pigsty, after all, and no one would want it even if I were to give it to them for free\u2014but after that slap, you're not getting anything out of me.\"\"Will you accept an apology?\" For his sister, for his future plan, Zhang Lie was willing to give up his pride.\"Ha! It's far too late! If you want to apologize, then kneel to me in front of the gates of the Blacksteel settlement.\"Zhang Lie's eyes turned cold once more. \"Do you think I'll do that?\"\"I have this contract in my hands, and this is my house, after all. You're both just squatters, and it's perfectly within reason for me to summon guards to chase both of you out.\"Zhang Lie shook his head. \"You'd be wrong. Look at the contract again: the house doesn't belong to you just yet.\"\"It's my house!\"It was Zhang Lie's turn to scoff. \"According to the contract, we have until the end of the month before you can evict us. There's still two weeks to go, and even if you're the landowner, you can't break the contract.\"Wang Xiaohua scanned the contract again to verify Zhang Lie's assertions, but she didn't change her stance. \"Is there a difference? It's only a matter of time before I kick the two of you out.\"\"At the very least, we're legally entitled to this property at the moment. You're the one trespassing on our property, and I'm the one who can summon the guards to kick you out. Well? Are you going to wait for them to show up, or will you leave on your own?\"\"Zhang Lie, just you wait! I'll be back at the end of the month!\" Knowing that he wouldn't give in, Wang Xiaohua had no choice but to turn around and leave, pointing a warning finger at him all the while.After finally chasing the hateful Wang Xiaohua away, Zhang Lie leaned down and inspected his sister's wheelchair for any signs of damage. She hugged him tightly, as though only with such an action could she recover a hint of warmth.\"Brother, what will we do? What if Mom and Dad come back and can't find us? Without this house, where will they stay? Where would we go?\" The house was filled with memories of family, with proof that the Zhang siblings' parents had once existed.Upon seeing his sister's tears, Zhang Lie immediately consoled her, \"Don't worry, I'll fix everything. If Wang Xiaohua forbids us from renting this place, I'll buy it outright from Uncle Wang, with a price he won't be able to reject.\"\"And how much would that cost?\"\"A million? Ten million? It doesn't matter, it's just money\u2014I'll be able to make it all back.\"\"But we don't have time, do we?\"Zhang Lie rubbed his sister's head. \"Don't worry, Hanxiang. Trust me.\"Zhang Hanxiang lowered her head gently onto her brother's chest. With him around, it seemed as though she had nothing to fear.After calming his sister down, Zhang Lie rested for five hours before returning to the dimensional world. Before setting off once more, he hid a large portion of his remaining money underneath his sister's bed, in case of emergency.As though sensing Zhang Lie's imminent departure, Zhang Hanxiang opened her eyes. \"Brother, are you leaving again?\"\"Sorry for waking you, Hanxiang. I'm leaving the rest of my money here. Use it for emergencies.\"\"Won't you rest a little longer?\"\"There's no time.\"\"Please, be safe. Don't do anything dangerous just because of me. After all, you're the only family I have left, Brother.\" Zhang Hanxiang tugged on her brother's sleeve, tears glimmering on her pearlescent eyes.Zhang Lie lowered his head and kissed his sister on the forehead. \"I promise you everything will be alright.\" He passed through the teleportation device into the dimensional world once more, his reappearance immediately prompting a bout of mocking laughter from the crowds in the settlement.Zhang Lie ignored them all and headed back to the white-grub cave, continuing to slaughter them wholesale.In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.Zhang Lie had only rested for between two to five hours each day, having spent the remainder of his time ceaselessly killing the white grubs. However, the rumored superior-grade white grub never appeared.\u00a0How could this be? Could there have been a mistake in the past?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: Superior Gene Fragments\"No, no, that's impossible. In the past, that rumor had eventually been verified by multiple sources, so there has to be something to it.\"According to the lucky fellow who had found the superior white grub, it had simply appeared as he was killing regular white grubs. However, Zhang Lie hadn't even seen a hint of this purported superior-grade lifeform despite having been in the cave for three months straight.And not only that\u2014he was even having trouble with his foundation.Extensive research in the past had confirmed that the soft cores of these white grubs were particularly good catalysts for a breakthrough in one's foundation, and prices for these cores were sure to soar in the future. Indeed, they had been in such high demand that the white grubs in the first realm of the dimensional world had been hunted to extinction, so Zhang Lie made sure to store at least half the cores every time he returned to the settlement.But even after having consumed countless such cores, Zhang Lie had yet to experience a breakthrough.His annoyance flared. The plans that he had worked out for himself rested on two critical components: a breakthrough in his foundation, and the soulshard obtained from the superior-grade white grub. Would his work over the past three months be for naught?Just because he knew the future didn't mean that he couldn't be stymied by unexpected variables, after all.Should I revise my plans?\u00a0Three whole months of effort, down the drain... the moment he thought of Wang Xiaohua's arrogant expression and his sister's tears, Zhang Lie's anger rose to a crescendo, and he pounded on the cave wall beside him.Kraak! The sound reverberated around the cave, and small cracks radiated outward from the point of impact. Fresh blood seeped down Zhang Lie's clenched fist.With a long sigh, Zhang Lie made to leave the cave. The incident with Wang Xiaohua meant that he was even more pressed for time than before, and he would have no choice but to change his plans. Even if it would be less advantageous for his future development, his sister was far more important.Suddenly, the part of the cave that he had hit began to crumble, revealing a hole large enough to pass through.What?\u00a0This cave had essentially been his second home for three months. He knew the entire region like the back of his hand, and this was an area he'd never seen before.\"Could it be\u2026 well, I've already wasted three months, after all, what's a little more time?\"With rekindled hope, Zhang Lie scrambled into the newly revealed tunnel. As the tunnel expanded, he found himself in a gigantic area the size of an exhibition hall. An enormous silvery-white grub sat in its center, glowing with white light.\"I've finally found you!\"Zhang Lie instantly realized that this was the superior-grade lifeform that he had been hunting. In truth, this tunnel had only been discovered in the past as a result of a long string of coincidences. Zhang Lie didn't know about the specifics of the discovery; all he had heard were rumors, so he'd never been successful.And yet his hard work had eventually paid off.The first realm of the dimensional world could generate regular-, mutated-, and superior-grade lifeforms. In other words, superior-grade lifeforms were at the apex of the realm.The enormous silvery-white grub in front of him was such an existence: the weakest superior-grade creature, but one whose soulshard was inordinately useful, and who would provide as many superior gene fragments as any other superior-grade lifeform.\"You'll be my first step to advancement!\" After having slaughtered three months' worth of white grubs, Zhang Lie had developed an intimate understanding of their anatomy. With a precise, efficient stroke, he thrust his blade toward its core.He had initially expected to be able to kill it with one attack, but even the weakest superior-grade creature was still stronger than he had anticipated. The blade could only penetrate a little of its flesh, no matter how much strength Zhang Lie used.His attack naturally enraged the silver grub, whose core suddenly turned blood-red and shot out toward him like a football.As a reincarnator, Zhang Lie was easily able to avoid the telegraphed attack.White grubs had essentially no offensive capabilities, and even this silver grub wouldn't have any particularly destructive or complicated attacks. Apart from its size and resilience, it was really no different from a regular white grub. Its attack pattern was more straightforward than that of just about any other lifeform.As he dodged to one side, Zhang Lie nicked the silver grub's flesh with a flurry of slices.In pain, the grub recoiled before suddenly expanding its body and bouncing up into the air, intending to squash Zhang Lie into meat paste.Unfortunately, Zhang Lie was simply too agile for it, and was able to dodge its attacks with ease. At the same time, he continued whittling away at the grub's flesh.The jelly-like fragments that he sliced off melted as soon as it hit the ground. Every time the grub bounced toward him, Zhang Lie would wave the sword in his hand and slice off another piece of its body.It chased him all around the cave, even as Zhang Lie kept dodging and slashing. After all, it was a superior-grade lifeform, and despite Zhang Lie's relentless attacks, it was able to continuously regrow its flesh.The fight dragged out into a stalemate.Eventually, the efficiency and persistence of Zhang Lie's swordplay, honed by months of fighting these grubs, paid off. The silver grub had shrunk to a third of its original size, and Zhang Lie was certain that he would be able to whittle it down before long.Before he could do so, however, Zhang Lie's stamina was sure to give out. After all, his foundation hadn't yet broken through, and he had only filled a fifth of his basic gene capacity. With only twenty basic gene fragments, his constitution was simply too poor for a drawn-out fight.Skill and technique were meaningless if his body couldn't keep up, and he was quickly running out of stamina.After another ten minutes, Zhang Lie could feel his body at its breaking point. Sweat drenched his body, his muscles quivered, he panted in huge, gasping breaths, and he was only keeping himself upright by willpower alone.Would this be it for him? To be killed by the superior-grade creature he had worked so hard to find, before even taking the first step toward success?As the silver grub bounced toward him once more, Zhang Lie yelled out in frustration, stepping aside and forcing his arm to strike again at its flesh, at least once more. As he looked death in the eye, the tip of his sword suddenly radiated light; the moment it struck the grub's flesh, Zhang Lie felt as though a dam had broken within his body, flooding him with strength.Finally, a breakthrough!Clad in shining light, his sword was faster, more flexible, and easily able to penetrate into the silver grub's core.Upon reflection, perhaps this was something Zhang Lie could have anticipated. Without any fear of death, without pushing himself to his limits, how could he have hoped to advance? He had used his experience and knowledge from his past life to work out the safest route to ascension, but it was exactly this safety that had caused him to stagnate in his foundation.Despite his earlier exhaustion, Zhang Lie now felt relaxed all over, as though his body had been reforged, refuelled, and revitalized. He immediately reached into his soulspace and retrieved the soulshard of a regular white grub, smashing it to pieces.An astounding discovery from his past life was that, within ten seconds of killing a lifeform, destroying a soulshard would increase the chances of a soulshard condensing from the recently deceased lifeform. If the destroyed soulshard belonged to the same species, a soulshard would be guaranteed.This phenomenon had been heavily studied, and the conclusion was that, because a soulshard was composed of spiritual matter, destroying a soulshard would temporarily increase the spirit density in the air. The dead lifeform would then absorb this spiritual matter to condense a soulshard with a probability increasing with the spirit density.[You successfully killed a superior-grade white grub and obtained its soulshard.]Zhang Lie beamed in delight, then hurriedly brought out the silvery-white soulshard from his soulspace. Activating it by will, he transformed the soulshard in his palm into a gigantic water balloon, one the size of a human. It gave off a silver glow, and its center was a soft core.[Soulshard designation: weapon-type.]Even though the will of the world had classified it as a weapon-type soulshard, the hunters of the dimensional world instead categorized it as a rare transformation-type soulshard instead.A moment's thought was sufficient to transform the water balloon into a silvery-white translucent overcoat. Its color was relatively appealing, but because Zhang Lie wasn't yet accustomed to manipulating the soulshard, the structure of the coat was lumpy and misshapen.After significant effort, Zhang Lie finally transformed it once more into a suit of silver armor. A pale pink pearl was embedded into the breastplate, the core of the soulshard. As long as it wasn't destroyed, the armor would be able to repair and even regenerate itself. The superior-grade white grub soulshard was infinitely flexible, able to be used as standalone armor or in addition to other armor-type soulshards.In Zhang Lie\u2019s past life, the hunter who had obtained the superior-grade white grub soulshard had gained such proficiency with it that he ultimately became known as the 'Monarch of a Hundred Transformations'.At present, Zhang Lie could only generate at most one or two extra arms, and he would require significant practice to draw out the soulshard\u2019s true utility. There was also one caveat to the transformations: the amorphous material, by nature, was unable to reproduce anything sharp.Of course, it was already more than sufficient for most purposes, and it wasn't as though this flaw couldn't be fixed. In the third realm of the dimensional world, there was a curious item known as Pandora's box. It was a consumable item that could fuse multiple superior- and higher-grade soulshards to enhance them.This was the primary reason that Zhang Lie had valued this soulshard so highly. It met the necessary requirements for fusion, so it had limitless growth potential. As long as Zhang Lie was willing to spend an exorbitant amount of resources to do so, it could grow to a disaster-grade, or even a monarch-grade, soulshard.More importantly, because of the fact that white grubs were one of the weakest lifeforms in the dimensional world, superior-grade white grubs were the rarest of the rare, and there had only been one recorded appearance in the past.As a result, this superior-grade soulshard that Zhang Lie now possessed might well be unique. Three months of effort for such a valuable and customizable soulshard was a bargain. But, even more importantly, this particular soulshard was necessary for the next step in his plan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Rage and HumiliationAfter having condensed the soulshard of the superior-grade white grub, Zhang Lie then began to consume its inner core. The consistency and taste were surprisingly decent, reminding Zhang Lie of a lychee-flavored gummy.After consuming the last remnant of its core, the will of the world announced, [For consuming the flesh of a superior-grade white grub, you received ten superior gene fragments.]Zhang Lie: a mortal lifeformFramework: Foundation, Lv. MAXGenes: Basic, 20; Mutated, 0; Superior, 10Soulshards: White Grub (superior, weapon-type)Because the silver grub was a superior-grade lifeform, every part of its carcass was valuable. There were cellars and large freezers designated specifically for the meat and bones of such lifeforms in the Blacksteel settlement, so Zhang Lie stored what he could and headed back.Of course, as soon as he entered the settlement, he was again greeted by a chorus of mocking laughter.\"Is the king of the dumps back already?\"\"Is he doing it just because everyone else is? Surely that white grub flesh isn't worth a hundred points every month. What's he even trying to do?\"\"If he weren't addled in the head, he wouldn't be at the bottom of the leaderboard.\"As usual, Zhang Lie ignored them. Even though it did cost a hundred points per month to use the settlement's cellar, all the white grub cores that he'd stored up would be a veritable fortune once it was discovered that they could catalyze a hunter\u2019s foundational breakthrough. He was even considering whether or not to disseminate that particular piece of information himself.After all, now that he had broken through, he had no intention of returning to the white-grub cave to collect more cores. Selling this information and then making a huge profit off the cores that he'd stockpiled sounded like the best strategy.However, given his current level of strength and connections, he certainly couldn't spread the word directly, or it would only invite unnecessary trouble for himself. He would have to consider his approach more carefully.After storing the valuable cores in the cellar, Zhang Lie then rented the cheapest room he could possibly find in the settlement. Because it was so cheap, it barely had any amenities\u2014it was essentially a prison cell with an attached bathroom.Zhang Lie sat cross-legged in bed. Given his recent breakthrough, he was now able to develop a genetic framework which would form the basis of his future development, and he had long since prepared a suitable framework for himself.The framework had been described in a manual that Zhang Lie had found within some ruins in the third realm of the dimensional world, which he had only acquired at considerable expense, effort, and danger.Despite all that, the ironic thing was that it was a framework that the past Zhang Lie simply could not use: its first stage was water-attuned. The past Zhang Lie's repertoire had been predominantly fire-attuned, and the water-attuned framework would be in direct elemental opposition with his favored techniques.He had even seriously considered destroying his foundation and starting from scratch, and it was only when he found out that even that might be insufficient for him to learn the technique that he gave up trying.Not having encountered this framework earlier had been a lifelong regret for Zhang Lie. By a stroke of fortune, however, he was now able to learn it after his reincarnation.Despite the fact that it wasn't a high-ranking framework, it was invaluable because of its ability to evolve.The first level of the framework was equivalent to a mortal-rank framework, which were so common in the dimensional world that just about any hunter could afford it. But upon reaching the second level, the framework would become low-rank; upon the third level, medium-rank; and so on and so forth...Upon reaching the ninth and final level of the framework, all nine levels could theoretically consolidate into a framework beyond even god-rank, representing a metamorphosis from the carp motif of the first level to the dragon motif of the ninth, hence its name: [Ninecarp Transformation].Of course, the requirements for advancement in this framework would only grow more and more stringent.Regardless, the value of an evolving framework was immeasurable, and Zhang Lie immediately began to study the framework following the manual that had been ingrained in his memories after his past life's relentless study.The main purpose of the original foundational framework was to accumulate genetic energy within one's body. After Zhang Lie's breakthrough, that energy had become more refined and concentrated.Presently, Zhang Lie was circulating that energy through his body following the pathways required by the new genetic framework, cleansing his body as the energy became imprinted on and attuned to it. After a few cycles, a sea-blue genetic core began condensing where his\u00a0dantian\u00a0was located.This core was about the size of a rosary bead, so large that Zhang Lie couldn't help but smile. Most hunters started out with a genetic core the size of a green bean. Naturally, Zhang Lie's exceptionally large core was, naturally, due to the breakthrough in his foundation. The initial size of hunters' cores greatly influenced their strength and resonance with genetic energy, so this was a clear benefit.Learning a new technique required engraving it on one's genetic core. Because the first level of [Ninecarp Transformation] corresponded to a framework of the lowest possible rank, mortal-rank, it could only accommodate five techniques.Luckily, its water attunement was extremely compatible with Zhang Lie's superior-grade white grub soulshard, and would be able to enhance its effects up to fivefold.The first level of the [Ninecarp Transformation]\u2014the carp\u2014conferred two fundamental abilities.The first, aquatic assimilation, would allow for underwater breathing and enhanced aquatic mobility. Most water-attuned frameworks would provide such a benefit, but some to a greater extent than others. The second, flame retardant, granted partial immunity against\u2014and eventually absorption of\u2014fire-based attacks.As a reincarnator, Zhang Lie was extremely familiar with the process of engraving a framework and its associated techniques on his genetic core, and it was only a matter of moments before a pale pink carp appeared within it.With the first level of the [Ninecarp Transformation] handled, the next step would be to assimilate compatible techniques into his framework. A water-attuned framework naturally required water-attuned techniques.Because Zhang Lie had used fire-attuned techniques in the past, his techniques would be incompatible with his current framework\u2014but that didn't mean that they would go to waste.An electronic trading post had been set up within the settlement by which hunters could exchange techniques for points or for other techniques. In general, the first option was disfavored; most people would only accept an equitable exchange of techniques.And even the cheap room that he had rented had an Internet connection.In the past, Zhang Lie's techniques had consisted of [The Burning Pyres], [Soulfire Blade], [Scorching Fist], [Flameburst Step], and the two high-grade techniques that he had obtained within the third realm, [Embersteel Cuirass] and [Baptism of Hellfire].All in all, they represented a full suite of techniques for attack, defense, evasion, and movement. He had no qualms about trading the first four away, but the last two would require more thought. [Embersteel Cuirass] was the signature technique of a famous dojo, and it would cause unnecessary trouble for him if he were to put it up for trade now.On the other hand, [Baptism of Hellfire] was the technique that Zhang Lie most favored, as well as his most valuable. Because the last few levels of the [Ninecarp Transformation] would likely be fire-attuned, Zhang Lie didn't want to trade this technique away unless he had no other choice.As he browsed the trading post, Zhang Lie paid particular attention to those requests for a fire-attuned technique in exchange for a water-attuned one.[Calm Waters] was one such technique, a defensive-type technique that its owner wanted to swap for a fire-type sword technique. Zhang Lie quickly uploaded a copy of his [Soulfire Blade], which was scanned and verified by the system and subsequently accepted in trade.Though he continued looking for suitable techniques, his search was fruitless. Instead, Zhang Lie left a request on the trading post with his three fire-attuned techniques enclosed.All that he needed to do now was wait. Even though the room he had rented wasn't particularly large, there was sufficient space for him to assimilate his newly acquired [Calm Waters].It was a rather difficult technique to practice, and required incorporating the flexible and supple nature of water into one's movements. Given his past experience, however, Zhang Lie was able to familiarize himself with the technique in just half a day or so.With his new framework and techniques, Zhang Lie intended to leave the settlement and hunt down some lifeforms to quickly bring his gene fragments to their maximum capacity. However, the moment he left the settlement, he encountered a nuisance.\"Zhang Lie! I've been waiting out here for you!\" The person whom Zhang Lie encountered by the gates was none other than his childhood friend Wang Xiaohua, jumping up and down in impatience.\"...are you in such a hurry that you can't wait until the end of the month?\"Wang Xiaohua glared evilly at Zhang Lie. \"The house is one matter, but your slapping me is another entirely. Don't think I'll forgive you so easily\u2014unless you kneel down here and beg for my forgiveness, I won't let you leave!\"The commotion was already gathering a crowd of hunters eager to watch the altercation.Zhang Lie shouted back, \"Scram! I don't have time to play games with you.\"\"Do you think you scare me? You're at the bottom of the gene leaderboard! I have twenty mutated gene fragments now, and I'll be able to beat you with just my little finger!\"Zhang Lie rolled his eyes, unable to deal with Wang Xiaohua's nonsense any longer. He slapped her face again, leaving her to stagger aside in mute surprise as he turned to leave.So what if she had twenty mutated gene fragments? \u00a0Zhang Lie had ten superior gene fragments\u2014even if no one in the crowd knew it.His actions shocked the hunters who had gathered around to watch the show.\"Gods above, he really dared to fight back, huh?\"\"Wang Xiaohua's going to kill him!\"When Wang Xiaohua recovered from the shock, she snarled and pounced on him like a vicious bulldog. \"Zhang Lie! How dare you hit me again?! I'll rip your face to pieces!\"Zhang Lie's lips quirked into a smile. How convenient that Wang Xiaohua was coming at him now! He hadn't had a chance to test out [Calm Waters] on an actual foe yet.As Wang Xiaohua approached, his hands bore the brunt of the impact, absorbing, redirecting, and multiplying the force of her approach.Thud! Zhang Lie flipped Wang Xiaohua's body over his head, and she landed head over heels on the ground. He wiped his hands off, turned to look at Wang Xiaohua's fallen form, then walked off whistling a jaunty tune.This time, it took Wang Xiaohua far longer to come to her senses. Somewhat woodenly, she dragged herself up from the ground. Her mouth filled with mud, she simply couldn't believe that the useless hunter that she had been mocking day in and day out actually possessed a strength that eclipsed her own.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: Galewolf SoulshardWhy? How could Zhang Lie be so much stronger than she was? It was true that she didn't have any actual combat experience, and that she mostly leeched off her teammates, but she should have had many more gene fragments than he did, surely? And those gene fragments were directly correlated with her constitution, with how much genetic energy she had!How could he have flipped her head over heels with just a single blow?Just how many gene fragments did Zhang Lie possess?In truth, Zhang Lie still had no mutated gene fragments, but his ten superior gene fragments represented a strength roughly equal to that of a hundred mutated gene fragments. With his extensive combat experience on top, Wang Xiaohua never stood a chance. No one would be able to beat Zhang Lie in terms of constitution if they didn't have superior gene fragments themselves.It wasn't just Wang Xiaohua who was stupefied by the outcome of the fight, but all the onlookers as well.\"When did the king of the dumps become so strong?\"\"Well, are you sure he's the one who became strong? Maybe it's Wang Xiaohua who's always been this weak!\"\"If I were her, I'd go crawl into a hole and die. Honestly, how could she lose to someone like him with a single blow?\"No one believed that Zhang Lie, who had resisted any attempt to be dislodged from his position at the bottom of the gene leaderboard, could have suddenly grown so strong. The natural conclusion could only have been that Wang Xiaohua was unexpectedly weak.Of course, there were bystanders who noticed something amiss.\"Are they all fools? Wang Xiaohua has twenty mutated gene fragments, so how weak could she really be? No: the conclusion must be that Zhang Lie's far stronger than he's letting on!\"Upon hearing this, Wang Xiaohua yowled as though she were a cat whose tail had been stepped on. \"That's nonsense! How could trash like him be strong? I was just careless! If I had prepared in advance, I would have pummeled him into the ground!\"The remaining onlookers quickly backed off upon seeing Wang Xiaohua's somewhat crazed expression. She twisted her head and glanced toward the direction in which Zhang Lie had vanished, her eyes narrowing into thin slits. \"Zhang Lie, just you wait. I'm not done with you yet!\"Not far outside the settlement, Zhang Lie ducked behind a tree, activated his white-grub soulshard, and encased himself in translucent white armor. His target for today would be a galewolf, a wolf-type lifeform that lived in the Valley of Winds.Zhang Lie had long since mapped out the dimensional world, and he headed straight for the valley without needing to check his map.In terms of outer appearance, galewolves were quite similar to regular gray wolves, though they were significantly larger. With all four limbs on the ground, their backs would be at eye level. Despite their intimidating size, however, they were just regular lifeforms.Zhang Lie didn't need any preparation to handle such prey; the moment he found a pack of galewolves, he rushed straight at them.The other hunters in the valley all thought that Zhang Lie was going crazy. Usually, to hunt a pack of galewolves, most people would lure them into a narrow pass and kill them one at a time there.Zhang Lie could only be so daring because of the white-grub soulshard and the superior gene fragments he had obtained. At this stage, he didn't have to fear most regular lifeforms at all.Despite the wolves' desperate attempt to bite and scratch him, they weren't able to claw away his armor. On the other hand, Zhang Lie was able to wave his sword with abandon, beheading a galewolf with every strike. His immaculate footwork and lethal technique made fighting the pack of galewolves seem like child's play.In a matter of moments, carcasses were strewn all around him.A team of hunters, who had witnessed the sight from afar, could only stare at him in shock.Of course, such a massacre would have produced regular soulshards, but Zhang Lie only clucked his tongue as he picked one up.Given his recent acquisition of a superior-grade soulshard, these regular-grade soulshards seemed useless in comparison. Only a mutated-grade soulshard, at the very least, could capture his attention.He raced through the valley, killing every pack of galewolves he came across. After hundreds of kills, he finally heard a deep howl from the distance. As Zhang Lie looked toward the source of the noise, he saw a truck-sized galewolf emerging from afar.\"A mutated-grade lifeform! Haha, it finally appeared!\"Licking his lips, Zhang Lie rushed forward fearlessly.The regular galewolves quickly moved out of the way of the impending confrontation.Clang! Zhang Lie's sword struck the wolf's claws.With a howl, the mutated-grade galewolf repeatedly swiped at Zhang Lie, but he didn't even flinch. The protection of the white-grub armor was such that he only had to focus on attacking, and attack he did, his sword gleaming as he thrust it toward the wolf's underside.In a matter of moments, the two of them exchanged hundreds of blows, but the mutated galewolf's claws found no purchase on Zhang Lie's armor. However, Zhang Lie's sword also couldn't penetrate the wolf's dense layer of fur and muscle, and the resistance even caused the blade to snap in half.\"You bastard\u2014that sword cost me 800 points!\"Zhang Lie had overlooked the fact that he was still using the cheapest blade he could afford; it was sharp and strong enough against regular lifeforms, but for a mutated-grade galewolf...The galewolf almost seemed to cackle as it opened its jaws wide, intending to finish Zhang Lie off with one bite.\"Just because I'm weaponless doesn't mean I can't kill you, you know.\"As the galewolf bit down, Zhang Lie's amorphous armor suddenly flowed into the wolf's mouth and began to balloon. In a matter of moments, the galewolf's eyes bulged as its throat swelled.Pop! After a discomforting stasis, the galewolf's throat finally exploded, separating its head from its body and showering Zhang Lie in blood.As Zhang Lie crushed the soulshard of a regular galewolf, the will of the world spoke into his mind. [You successfully killed a mutated-grade galewolf and received its soulshard. Soulshard designation: augmentation-type.]A mutated galewolf's soulshard was particularly useful in the dimensional world. As an augmentation-type soulshard, it was able to increase one's speed without inducing any additional energy consumption. Upon its activation, he would be able to move as fast as lightning for a short period of time.Zhang Lie had gone to the Valley of Winds to hunt for both gene fragments and this particular soulshard. He hadn't expected that he would be so lucky as to encounter a mutated-grade galewolf so quickly, however.After its death, the surrounding galewolves all cowered and fled, leaving the carcasses of their mutated- and countless regular-grade comrades behind.Zhang Lie took out a gigantic pot and a variety of spices and seasoning, then began butchering the carcasses, stripping away their fur and bones. He threw the meat into the pot, added the spices, and poured in a generous quantity of white wine. After letting it stew for three hours, the wolf-meat broth was ready to be consumed.[For consuming the meat of a galewolf, you received 1 basic gene fragment.][For consuming the meat of a mutated-grade galewolf, you received 1 mutated gene fragment.]...Zhang Lie: a mortal lifeformFramework: Foundation, Lv. MAX; Ninecarp Transformation, First Form: CarpGenes: Basic, 40; Mutated, 10; Superior, 10Soulshards: White Grub (superior); Galewolf (mutated)The mutated galewolf had provided him with ten mutated gene fragments. Although there was still a large quantity of galewolf meat left, hunters could only ever get twenty gene fragments of each type from any particular species, so Zhang Lie packed up the rest of the meat and got ready to leave.He also brought the backbone of the mutated-grade galewolf back with him. Bones from mutated-grade lifeforms made for good crafting materials for weapons, and Zhang Lie was in need of a new one.When the hunters saw Zhang Lie returning so soon with a huge sack of items, they all began to gossip.\u00a0[1]\"Oh? The king of the dumps is returning with a big haul, I wonder what it is?\"\"White grubs, of course.\"The other hunters couldn't help but snicker. \"Is he still hunting those stupid grubs?\"\"Really, how long is he going to keep doing that? He seemed to have become a little stronger judging by the results of that fight, but he's still repeatedly doing the same things!\"\"I heard Wang Xiaohua's going to face him with her whole team next time.\"\"Well, he asked for it.\"\"Isn't Wang Xiaohua pretty trashy, though? Does she need her whole team to beat a weakling like him?\"As usual, Zhang Lie ignored the crowd. He placed the sack of galewolf meat on the point-conversion counter and found that it was worth 500 points. He couldn't help but sigh in anticipation: his hardest days were over.He had previously amassed 1000 points only with three grueling months of work, but now\u2014just one day had netted him 500 points.With all his preparations in order, it was time for the next step.1. These hunters really have nothing better to do, do they?\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: Advancement PlanZhang Lie was surprised that he had already received an offer for the three fire-attuned techniques that he had uploaded onto the trading post.After finding a cheap inn in which he could access the Internet, Zhang Lie hissed through his teeth at the terrible offer he had received. The other party had offered to trade one water-attuned technique for all three of his! Was he crazy?\"Don't you understand the rules of the trading post? I'll take three water-attuned techniques for my three fire-attuned ones, no more and no less!\"The other party was apparently also online, because he received a response quickly. \"Your three techniques are too inferior! The technique I'm offering you is worth all three of yours.\"\"Ha! Who'd believe you?\"\"Water-attuned techniques aren't all that rare, but trying to obtain three at once is a tall order.\"\"You're only offering one technique because you don't have three, aren't you?\"\"Well, you're half-right. I only have two water-attuned techniques on hand, but one of my techniques is worth three of yours.\"\"Show me why.\"The other party sent over a holographic recording of a palm-based technique, [Three-Wave Crescendo].Each palm strike was akin to a wave, and each would be stronger than the last. Such a technique, simple and destructive in execution, was likely one of the best high-grade techniques that could be obtained in the first realm.\"It's quite good, but not enough to be exchanged for three of my own.\"After all, it wasn't even a legendary-grade technique. On the other hand, both [Soulfire Blade] and [The Burning Pyres] were high-grade techniques, so Zhang Lie would be reluctant to trade one for two, let alone one for three.\"And the second technique?\"The other party sent another holographic recording over. This time, it was a movement technique: [Rippling Walk].It wasn't a particularly advanced technique, but agility-enhancing movement techniques were generally thought to be more important in the dimensional world than either attack and defense techniques. After all, hunters only had one life; they had to be prepared to flee at any moment.\"I'll trade you my three techniques for both of yours, as well as 50 grams of S-gold alloy.\"\"Weren't we going to do a one-for-three trade?\"\"I'd be crazy to trade all three of my techniques for one of yours! Neither of your techniques are legendary-grade. Your first technique is worth one of mine, your second is comparable to my [Flameburst Step], and you'll have to give me 50 grams of S-gold alloy for my [Scorching Fist].\"Being too polite on the trading post would make the other party treat him like a doormat.\"Nonsense! At the very least, [Three-Wave Crescendo] is worth two of your techniques\u2014it'll even be able to damage superior-grade lifeforms with all three blows! And [Rippling Walk] lasts longer than your [Flameburst Step].\"Zhang Lie rolled his eyes. \"Don't treat me like a newbie. I've seen countless hunters like you preying on the clueless. It's true that your [Three-Wave Crescendo] can boast significant power, but it also requires hitting the same area with all three strikes. This is a clear flaw with the technique.\"His past life's experience made it trivial to identify the strengths and weaknesses of any given technique. He continued, \"As a water-attuned technique, [Rippling Walk] is longer-lasting by nature, whereas [Flameburst Step] provides a more instant, explosive advantage. Their strengths are in different areas, and their value is equivalent.\"\"Damn, what's someone like you doing pretending to be a newbie? You find this sort of thing funny?\"The other party was clearly quite shocked by Zhang Lie's reasoned rebuttal; after all, this was his first post on the trading post, and he had intended on scamming him\u2014only to find that he wasn't an easy mark.\"Actually, yes.\"\"Shameless bastard!\"\"Well, are you going to trade? Two techniques and 50 grams of S-gold alloy.\"\"Of course I will, but 50 grams is too much. 10 grams at most.\"\"30 grams is the lowest I'll go.\"\"...fine.\"After successfully completing the trade, Zhang Lie left his room and rented a training chamber for a day with 50 points, in which he began to practice [Three-Wave Crescendo].This was a water-attuned technique that took the nature of water in a completely different direction compared to [Calm Waters]. The crux to [Three-Wave Crescendo] was the multiplicative effect of each strike. Instead of treating all three strikes as one attack, it would be more appropriate to practice each strike separately before trying to combine them into one.At first, his actions weren't particularly quick. There was a significant delay between each palm strike, but the more Zhang Lie practiced, the less the delay. In the end, Zhang Lie produced what seemed like a casual palm strike.Pa! Pa! Pa! It seemed as though that one strike had three separate afterimages. But, in truth, Zhang Lie had struck thrice in that one moment.It had taken Zhang Lie half a day of concerted effort to obtain a rudimentary grasp of [Three-Wave Crescendo]. Subsequently, he chose to rest rather than to study [Rippling Walk].It would take some time for his brain and body to adjust to engraving a technique on his genetic core, and taking appropriate breaks would be more beneficial for his overall growth. Resting was an integral part of training, after all.After his break, Zhang Lie continued browsing the trading post.Techniques were knowledge-based and could be uploaded directly to the trading post, but physical items like the S-gold alloy would need to be manually retrieved. Transactions involving parties from different settlements would require the use of teleportation devices, which incurred a small handling fee.Zhang Lie headed to the branch of the trading post in the Blacksteel settlement, where he inputted his transaction ID and password for robotic retrieval of the S-gold alloy, a grayish-black substance about the size of his thumb.Despite its unassuming appearance, the alloy actually commanded a jaw-dropping price, and even then was quickly snapped up by interested buyers. It was a particularly rare and valuable crafting material for weapons, affording significant penetrating power even for superior-grade lifeforms.With his newly acquired S-gold alloy and the mutated-grade galewolf's backbone in hand, Zhang Lie headed for the settlement's forging apparatus. To be precise, this \"forging apparatus\" was a robot enhanced with artificial intelligence.He handed over the mutated-grade galewolf's backbone and designated the S-gold alloy as a supplementary material, and was told that the forging process would cost 300 points and take a few hours.After transferring the requisite points, Zhang Lie returned to the training chamber and began studying [Rippling Walk]. [Rippling Walk] was a little unique in that it required certain environmental effects to be used. Luckily, the chamber he had rented provided access to different terrain\u2014given a modest expenditure of points, of course.After transforming the floorboards of the training chamber into lapping waves, Zhang Lie began to practice his [Rippling Walk], working specifically on his speed and control. In three short hours, he quickly grew as accustomed to the water as a surfer.He left the training chamber and headed back to the forging apparatus to retrieve his new weapon. The sword shone silver. Given the use of a galewolf's backbone as the primary crafting ingredient, its pommel and hilt had been fashioned with a moon motif. The blade was balanced, light, and aesthetically pleasing.Zhang Lie was very satisfied with the sword. As he gingerly touched its edge to determine its keenness, he murmured, \"I suppose I'll name you Galewind.\"Compared to the previous shabby blade that Zhang Lie had been using, Galewind was far better. If the other blade had a combined stat value of 5, then Galewind would have a combined stat value of at least 50.Zhang Lie couldn't wait to test out his new blade.Now that he was well-equipped, he would be able to move on to the next stage in his advancement plan: picking herbs.As he strode out of the settlement, however, Zhang Lie again found himself beset by Wang Xiaohua.\"Zhang Lie, you coward! You're finally back out again!\" Wang Xiaohua, surrounded by her four teammates, tapped her foot impatiently, her mouth curled into an expression of distaste.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Harvesting Herbs\"Wang Xiaohua, what's wrong with you? Haven't you learned your lesson after what happened yesterday? And you've brought your teammates with you this time, I see.\"\"Zhang Lie, you've been getting quite cocky lately, haven't you? How dare you attack one of our teammates?\"\"To think that even a weakling like you would dare to bully our Xiaohua!\"\"If we weren't here to protect her, wouldn't you keep attacking her again and again?\"Wang Xiaohua's teammates began taunting him, but Zhang Lie was indifferent to the verbal assault. \"Perhaps you should all stop her from harassing others instead, no?\"\"Eh, you dare talk back to us? Xiaohua was giving you face by waiting for you so patiently outside the settlement gates, but you disregarded that and even beat her up! Don't you think you should compensate her for her troubles?\"Wang Xiaohua was Qin Xiaotian's girlfriend, and Qiu Changming, the leader of her team, would naturally defer to her demands to get into Qin Xiaotian's good books.\"I heard you've killed a large number of white grubs recently, haven't you? You must have quite a few of their cores stored up, then. Hand all those points over, and I'll show you mercy and let you leave.\"Zhang Lie scoffed. \"Are you hunters or bandits?\"\"So what if we want to rob you? We're showing interest in you, you understand? You should be kneeling on the ground and thanking us for our attention!\"Qiu Changming's arrogance quickly attracted a crowd of onlookers.\"Haha, the king of the dumps is dead for sure this time. Remember how he dared to fight back against Wang Xiaohua yesterday? All hunters work in teams, except for useless trash like him that no one wants\u2014and after he attacked Wang Xiaohua, of course she would retaliate with her entire team.\"\"All her teammates have their mutated gene capacity maxed out, don't they? They're ranked in the hundreds on the gene leaderboard, so surely Zhang Lie's dead meat now.\"Zhang Lie narrowed his eyes. \"Scram.\"\"Oho? You're really asking for a beating, aren't you?!\"Qiu Changming rubbed his thumb and index finger together, as though Zhang Lie was an ant that he could crush effortlessly. However, just as he spoke, Zhang Lie made his move. Given the power disparity between him and Qiu Changming, no one had expected him to do so.Pa! Pa! Pa! [Three-Wave Crescendo]!Three palm strikes landed on Qiu Changming's chest, as fast as lightning, he force so great that it flung his body into the air.\"Captain!\" Wang Xiaohua's other teammates snarled as they surrounded Zhang Lie.However, Zhang Lie was already getting ready to leave. He bent his knees slightly, and genetic energy coalesced into waves beneath his feet\u2014[Rippling Walk].With the additional speed from his mutated-grade galewolf soulshard, in the blink of an eye, his silhouette became nothing more than a tiny dot in the distance. No one would be able to catch him given his current speed.Wang Xiaohua clutched her hair and screamed. \"Zhang Lie! Are you going to run off like a coward? Turn around and face me like a man!\"Zhang Lie wasn't an idiot; why would he waste his time with these fools? In the end, he vanished from sight.But was Zhang Lie afraid of them? Of course not. Given the gene fragments he currently had, along with his combat experience, it would have been a piece of cake for him to take them all down. However, he had no intention of revealing his true strength just yet.His earlier attack had more or less demonstrated some level of competency, but it wasn't anything too shocking. The next stages of his plan required secrecy, so he didn't want to attract attention. It made sense for him to hide his strength.Clad in translucent white armor, Zhang Lie rushed toward his first herb-collecting locale.Herbs were the basic ingredient for spiritual pills and potions. In the wide expanse of the dimensional world grew not only all sorts of strange lifeforms, but also a multitude of plants with unique capabilities. These plants were native to the dimensional world, and their flowers, fruits, and stems all possessed near-miraculous properties.It had been just about a century since the dimensional world was discovered, and although mankind's understanding of this mysterious region was improving day by day, dimensional herblore was still in its infancy.It would be at least a decade before the rise of the first pillmasters. The development of strength- and vitality-enhancing potions would take another decade, not to mention the invaluable limit-breaking potions.Past the first realm of the dimensional world was the second realm, the third realm... in order to improve their chances of survival in ever more dangerous environments, hunters would have to be very familiar with concocting pills and potions.As a reincarnator, Zhang Lie's most valuable assets were potion recipes. In order to produce these potions, he would need to collect all manner of herbs and other ingredients. The first location to which Zhang Lie was headed was the Bloodcrystal Valley.The valley was home to an enormous colony of blood ants, a type of mutated-grade lifeform. Blood-ant soulshards would enrage their users, enhancing all their physical capabilities for a short period of time.Zhang Lie needed to obtain a superior-grade blood-ant soulshard, because it was one of the rare few means by which he could damage disaster-grade lifeforms. His eventual goal in the first realm of the dimensional world was to hunt down a disaster-grade lifeform that had somehow made its way down to the first realm in the future, having been weakened greatly in the process.Of course, given his current skill level, Zhang Lie had no intention of challenging any superior-grade lifeforms, let alone disaster-grade lifeforms. With only ten superior gene fragments, challenging a superior-grade lifeform at this stage was akin to commiting suicide.The superior-grade white grub that he had risked his life to kill was an abnormally weak existence for superior-grade lifeforms, and Zhang Lie would certainly be unable to defeat stronger ones at the moment.Superior-grade blood ants tended to hide deep within the valley, and Zhang Lie would avoid them if at all possible.His primary goal for entering the valley was to collect herbs. Of course, if everything were to go smoothly, he'd also collect a number of gene fragments, and ideally also the soulshard of a mutated blood ant.The Bloodcrystal Valley was composed of a number of hill-like structures formed by gigantic red crystals, hence its name. Caves of all sizes were distributed around each hill. By the roof of each cave were a number of red, root-like protrusions, the precise herbs that Zhang Lie was here to collect.Known as blood whiskers, they looked more like red icicles than plants. In truth, they were a highly potent herb, as well as one of the main ingredients for Zhang Lie's Potion #1.\u00a0[1]To date, there were two reasons this herb's properties had yet to be discovered, which were the two problems that Zhang Lie would have to resolve.First, those cave entrances led into the blood ants' anthills, and he would be attacked as soon as he got close to them. Second, blood ants were highly territorial and pack-based lifeforms, and an individual blood ant could quickly summon the entire colony to its aid.Individually, these blood ants were about the size of small dogs, but they had a surprising ability to jump. Their pincers were stronger than steel.In a prolonged battle, they could even enrage themselves with a specialized genetic technique: [Bloodbath]. It would temporarily inhibit their sense of pain and cause them to swarm any nearby attackers, not stopping until one or the other party was dead. It was this characteristic behavior that gave them the name of 'blood ant'.For dealing with such pesky lifeforms, hunters would try to lure one or two isolated ants out from near the boundary of the hill; none would dare to enter. Most hunters would simply avoid the region entirely.If Zhang Lie were to attack by force, he would receive nothing more than a quick death, but of course he had a plan. Rather than entering the valley directly, he climbed up a tall hill neighboring the valley.From the top of the hill, Zhang Lie suddenly spread his arms wide, morphed his suit of armor into a glider, activated his galewolf soulshard, then jumped down. Wind swirled around him, boosting the speed of his descent.With Zhang Lie's innate sense of proprioception, as well as the skeins of amorphous matter he could shoot out from his hand to control and orient his descent\u00a0[2], Zhang Lie glided toward a large crystal hill, as agile as a bird.And as he descended, he reached out into the caves and tore out quite a few blood whiskers. Of course, as he did so, he was subject to a number of scattered attacks, all of which were blocked by his armor.Without activating [Bloodbath], it would be very difficult for blood ants to penetrate his armor. But after their failed attacks, they immediately began to chitter away, sending the whole valley abuzz. A veritable sea of ants began pouring out of each cave in a red flood.Luckily, Zhang Lie had anticipated such a situation, and he began dashing out of the valley the moment he touched down. Blood ants were highly territorial, and the horde of ants chasing after him immediately retreated outside the valley itself.Of course, the few blood ants that had managed to land on Zhang Lie during his descent failed to make it back, having died at his hand. Unfortunately, none of his kills generated a soulshard.As he stored the blood whiskers he had grabbed, Zhang Lie again climbed up the neighboring hill. That he had managed to collect almost thirty stalks of the herb demonstrated the viability of his technique.However, the cohesion of the blood ants rather surprised him: he had only expected ants to emerge from a single anthill, not the entire valley.Given these unexpected circumstances, Zhang Lie didn't dare to repeat his maneuver immediately. Instead, he closely scrutinized the behavior of the blood ants.After expelling the intruder, they had quickly returned to their individual anthills. And by the time half an hour or so had passed, the entire valley was as peaceful as it had initially been.Zhang Lie stood up, stretched, and prepared for his second descent. His first time through, his harvesting technique left much to be desired. This time around, given his past experience, he would surely be able to collect more blood whiskers.1. A very imaginative name...\u00a0\u261c2. Hello, Peter Parker.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: Bountiful HarvestAmidst the howling winds, Zhang Lie again leapt down from the hill. This time, by the time Zhang Lie escaped from the valley, he had over a hundred stalks of blood whiskers in his backpack.Zhang Lie had spent a significant amount of time preparing for this collection attempt, so he would obviously grab everything he could.Because the properties of the blood whiskers had yet to be discovered, and because no one had figured out how to efficiently harvest them, there had to be over ten thousand stalks in this valley alone.Given Zhang Lie's current harvesting rate, even if he collected a hundred stalks each time, it would take over a hundred glides for him to collect them all. Zhang Lie gave himself a week to do all this.It seemed as though the backpack he was using wouldn't be sufficient anymore. Once he returned to the settlement, he would have to take a short detour to the nearby swamplands to hunt some potbellied toads for their soulshards.These blood whiskers were a necessary ingredient for Zhang Lie, so he had even devised a series of backup plans if his original harvesting method had failed.Unfortunately, there would always be variables he couldn't account for. On his tenth descent, a vibrating chitter reverberated through the valley.The next moment, a blood-red shadow rushed out from its depths. Its body was as large as a carriage, its pincers the size of polearms, its transparent wings criss-crossed with bloody streaks of red, and its huge eyes colored a deep crimson.\"A superior-grade blood ant!\"Zhang Lie's face turned pale. He activated his galewolf soulshard immediately, then rushed toward the valley exit. He was fast, but the superior-grade blood ant's attack was even faster!A blood-red arrow shot toward Zhang Lie, so quickly he couldn't react in time! The moment the arrow had shot out, Zhang Lie had had a premonition of danger and had tried to shift to dodge the blow. However, by the time his body began to move, the arrow had already exploded upon impact with his left shoulder, careening him into the distance.Luckily, Zhang Lie was able to adapt to the shock almost immediately. With both [Rippling Walk] and his galewolf soulshard activated, he twisted in mid-air and used the momentum of the explosion to launch himself toward the valley's exit.\"Ka, kaka!\"The superior-grade blood ant glanced around the valley. When it discovered that its target had vanished, it clicked its mandibles a few times, emanated a deep, vibrating chitter, and then retreated back into the depths of the valley.Deep within a nearby forest, Zhang Lie let out a sigh of relief after hearing the deep chitter. That was far too dangerous\u2014he'd only been collecting a few blood whiskers, but somehow a superior-grade blood ant had appeared!And it even attacked Zhang Lie immediately.He glanced at the crystallizing wound on his left shoulder, chuckling bitterly to himself. How hostile, to have shot a blood arrow at him right after its appearance! If not for his white-grub armor, he'd have been dead by now.Zhang Lie began to circulate his genetic energy to prevent the spread of the blood ant's peculiar strain of genetic energy.The blood arrow that the superior-grade blood ant had shot at him was a long-ranged attack that would gradually cause the blood in the affected region\u2014and then his whole body, if untreated\u2014to crystallize, turning him into a sculpture of blood.It took him a whole hour to localize the blood ant's genetic energy and stop the spread of the crystallization. If not for his armor and the boost to his constitution from his ten superior gene fragments, he would surely have died then and there.The appearance of the superior-grade blood ant marked an end to Zhang Lie's harvest.Instead of retreating back into its anthill as Zhang Lie had expected, it instead stood guard at the top of the largest of the crystal hills in the Bloodcrystal Valley, leaving Zhang Lie no choice but to retreat.Of course, his retreat would only be temporary. Once the superior-grade blood ant returned to its anthill, Zhang Lie would certainly continue harvesting these blood whiskers. Without risk, there was no reward. These blood whiskers would be a second source of wealth for him, and he wasn't about to give up on them so easily.Since he wasn't able to gather more blood whiskers at the moment, Zhang Lie headed toward the swamplands.During this period of time, he collected a few herbs that were easily found all over the region and hunted a few more lifeforms to fill up his gene capacity.A giant swamp, shaped somewhat like a prayer mat, lay at the heart of the swamplands. It was the natural habitat of the potbellied toads, regular-grade lifeforms beloved by most hunters. Their soulshards were particularly useful, and almost every hunter who entered the dimensional world would get their hands on a few.Zhang Lie immediately spotted a potbellied toad peeking its black head out of the surface of the swamp. Although the toads were commonplace, their soulshards were particularly difficult to obtain, for two reasons.First, regular-grade lifeforms didn't have a high probability of condensing soulshards. Second, the swamp was a very difficult terrain to fight in, and there were quite a number of other lifeforms around\u2014some mutated-grade, and a few even superior-grade.Even those hunters who had reached their mutated gene threshold wouldn't dare to charge straight in.Hunting the swamp's potbellied toads required more than brute strength. For others, this might have been a problem, but for the reincarnated Zhang Lie, this was a trivial issue to solve.While travelling to the region, Zhang Lie had already worked out a plan. He started a small fire by a clearing near the swamp, where he began to roast a one-eyed pheasant that he had caught not too far from the area.A salivating scent spread throughout the swamp, and all the potbellied toads began to croak as they smelled it. Unfortunately, they quieted down the moment they swam to the edge of the swamp, as if forcing themselves to resist the temptation.Zhang Lie had expected this. He retrieved what looked like a four-leaf clover from his backpack, crushed it, then spread the pieces over the roasting pheasant. When crushed and roasted, this plant would release a curious smoke that would attract all frog-type lifeforms close by.A blue fog, barely visible to the naked eye, spread out from the fire and into the swamp. When it reached the potbellied toads, they immediately rushed out of the swamp toward the direction of the scent. They were surprisingly large, about half the size of an adult male.As soon as the potbellied toad at the very front saw the smoke wafting from the one-eyed pheasant, it immediately opened its mouth, attempting to snare the pheasant with its tongue.Of course, Zhang Lie would stop it from doing so. With a few waves of his sword, all the potbellied toads that had tried to stick their tongues out found them severed.The next moment, Zhang Lie activated his galewolf soulshard and charged toward them.[Three-Wave Crescendo]\u2014each palm strike struck with the force of a tidal wave, and the potbellied toads that were unfortunate enough to be caught in the attack all collapsed.The toads' only real danger came from their long, sticky tongues, as well as their ability to stuff just about anything down their throat. However, given the large disparity between their strength and Zhang Lie's, he had nothing to fear.As the smoke continued wafting around the swamp, more and more toads began to surface. In a flurry of blows, Zhang Lie swept through the toads like a sickle through wheat. It took a dozen kills, and as many shattered soulshards with relatively useless capabilities, before Zhang Lie finally obtained his first potbellied-toad soulshard.[Soulshard designation: storage-type (spatial).]Upon activating the soulshard, a miniature pouch appeared in Zhang Lie's hand. The pouch possessed the property of spatial miniaturization; although it wasn't much larger than his hand, it could store up to a truckload's worth of space.However, even that wasn't enough: the pouch would fill up after storing a dozen toad carcasses. Zhang Lie couldn't be satisfied with just one such pouch. Since he was at the swamp already, he might as well get a full dozen.The blue smoke continued attracting toads, and Zhang Lie began his slaughter in earnest, wishing that he had a multi-target offensive technique. With his palm attack and his blade, another dozen toads lost their lives, producing one more soulshard.Just as Zhang Lie was about to pocket the soulshard, however, a mutated-grade potbellied toad, about twice the size of a regular one, appeared from the swamp. Zhang Lie was hoping for exactly such an opportunity: after all, it meant that he would soon be able to have a mutated-grade potbellied-toad soulshard.The resulting mutated pouch would be at least thrice the size of a regular one. If he could obtain multiple copies of it, he wouldn't have to worry about storage space ever again.He activated [Calm Waters], flung a few toad carcasses toward the mutated toad, and followed up with a blow from Galewind. As he circulated his genetic energy, his blade took on a pale blue sheen, and he reached the toad in an instant.He had obstructed the mutated toad's vision with the carcasses of the regular-grade toads, and that momentary distraction was sufficient for Zhang Lie to approach. By the time it sensed danger, a pale blue longsword had already impaled its head. The mutated-grade potbellied toad slumped in death, without even having time to croak.As Zhang Lie smashed a regular-grade potbellied-toad soulshard to pieces, a soulshard condensed over the mutated-grade toad's carcass. He'd acquired its soulshard!With that soulshard in hand, Zhang Lie began slaughtering the other toads even more quickly. Countless toads that jumped out of the swamp fell to his blade.After another ten minutes, when the smoke finally dissipated, the potbellied toads stopped splashing out of the swamp. During the ten-minute bonanza, Zhang Lie had obtained thirteen regular-grade and two mutated-grade soulshards, a large haul by any standard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: Limit-Breaking PotionEven ignoring the profit that the regular-grade potbellied-toad soulshards would bring in, the two mutated-grade toad carcasses would easily be worth the trip on their own. Their tongues could be used to make high-quality bowstrings. Their meat was a particular delicacy, and could be consumed for mutated gene fragments.After the battle, Zhang Lie, with two mutated-toad pouches tied to his waist, began to scour the battlefield for his spoils. Within five minutes, except for an extinguished fire and bits of blood and offal, nothing remained on the scene.Zhang Lie then headed to a secluded cave, where he began to butcher the mutated toad carcasses in earnest. After slicing off their long, elastic tongue, and removing them of their innards, he skewered and seasoned their legs, then began cooking it over a fire.The intense fight had consumed a significant chunk of Zhang Lie's stamina. With such a delicacy in front of him, it was natural for him to want to dig in. The meat of the potbellied toad was surprisingly tender. It took only ten minutes or so for the meat to brown, and they were giving off a mouthwatering scent.Zhang Lie grabbed a skewer, opened his mouth wide, and began to eat.Minutes later, as he patted his bursting tummy in satisfaction, Zhang Lie had successfully obtained twenty mutated gene fragments. His stats were incomparable to what they had been before.Zhang Lie: a mortal lifeformFramework: Foundation, Lv. MAX; Ninecarp Transformation, First Form: CarpTechniques: Rippling Walk (novice), Three-Wave Crescendo (novice)Genes: Basic, 110; Mutated, 60; Superior, 10Soulshards: White Grub (superior), Galewolf (mutated), Blood Ant (mutated), Potbellied Toad (regular, mutated)His basic gene capacity had even reached an unimaginable hundred and ten fragments. Before the revelation that there could be a breakthrough with the foundational framework, everyone's basic gene capacity was at a hundred fragments exactly.After reaching that limit, no matter how much flesh hunters consumed from regular-grade lifeforms, they wouldn't be able to exceed that limit. Only with a breakthrough in their foundational framework could they finally increase that limit by ten fragments.And although ten basic gene fragments didn't seem like much, the fact that they were past the usual limit meant that they were more beneficial to a hunter's constitution than even ten mutated gene fragments.There were three conditions required to experience a breakthrough with one's foundational framework, and the third condition was something that Zhang Lie had only gotten a handle on after his reincarnation.The first, and most basic, condition was to raise one's foundational framework to its tenth stage and to not have progressed to a more advanced framework.The second condition was to have consumed sufficiently many white grub cores, or the growth factors extracted from their flesh.The third condition was that their body had to be flooded with adrenaline.Each of the three conditions was difficult to satisfy individually, and to meet all three requirements would require an exceedingly unusual string of coincidences\u2014or foreknowledge.In truth, the past Zhang Lie had missed this opportunity to expand his basic gene capacity.It was widely known that there were only ten stages to the standard foundational framework, and that reaching the tenth stage would grant access to a more advanced framework and genetic techniques.Most hunters would have prepared such a framework as soon as they reached the ninth stage of their foundational framework. Why would anyone behave like Zhang Lie, refusing to study a more advanced framework before experiencing a breakthrough with his foundational one?The second condition seemed even stranger: why would anyone consume so many white-grub cores? The white-grub cave had been more or less deserted, even of beginner hunters hunting for their first gene fragments.The third condition sounded simple, but was actually the hardest to achieve in practice. Even Zhang Lie didn't know about its specifics. Kissing would increase the concentration of adrenaline in one's body, as would life-or-death struggles, but it was hardly easy to quantify what the required concentration was.In the past, it had taken seven more years before someone unintentionally satisfied all three conditions and experienced a breakthrough. Given how unusual these conditions were, Zhang Lie was certain that he was now the first hunter to exceed a capacity of a hundred basic gene fragments.And not only that, he would soon exceed a basic capacity of a hundred and ten\u2014even a hundred and fifty!\u2014gene fragments, because he was right about to concoct Potion #1.With the main ingredient, blood whiskers, in hand, he now only needed to acquire a few supplementary ingredients that were relatively easy to harvest.After returning to the settlement, he sold off the remainder of the toad carcasses, acquiring 31,000 points and catapulting him into fiscal freedom. He stored the herbs he had harvested in the warehouse. Subsequently, he logged into the trading post and anonymously listed five regular-grade potbellied-toad soulshards. Finally, he spent a thousand points to rent the best laboratory the settlement had to offer and began to concoct the limit-breaking potion.The recipe was particularly complicated, and it had been years since Zhang Lie last made this potion, so there was a significant amount of trial and error involved. It took seventeen long hours of work and three failed attempts before Zhang Lie finally succeeded.The blood-red potion before him raised Zhang Lie's spirits. Without a doubt, this was the first Potion #1 to be made in the entire world.Zhang Lie inclined his head and downed the potion in one fell swoop. Fire burned his throat and body, a scorching baptism.He felt as though he was experiencing the blood ants' [Bloodbath]. As the potent effects of the blood whiskers surged through his body, a scorching heat enveloped him from head to toe, as though he had immersed his entire body in a vat of chili peppers.Zhang Lie could clearly sense how, under the dominating effects of this potion, his cells were developing in overdrive, his pores seeming to breathe out fire. His muscles began to contract, becoming even tougher and more resilient. His arteries, veins, and capillaries thickened. His body began to evolve at its most fundamental, genetic, level.Sweat poured down his back. Zhang Lie felt as though he had been running laps in the rain, his body wet and damp all over. Along with the sweat were expunged small black impurities, and a curious stench filled the air.With his body purged and cleansed, Zhang Lie gained a little resistance to the potent heat of the potion. He mastered his body and began circulating his genetic energy according to his [Ninecarp Transformation].After ten full cycles, the genetic core in Zhang Lie's dantian grew to twice its size, and began to take on an opalescent sheen. The pale pink carp in his core seemed to come alive.The gene fragments that augmented his body seemed to have been converted in their entirety to pure genetic energy. Zhang Lie directed all that energy toward the [Ninecarp Transformation] engraved on his genetic core.The entire process lasted three hours. Under the combination of potent medicine and a seemingly inexhaustible vein of genetic energy, Zhang Lie evolved his genetic framework from early first-stage to mid first-stage.Zhang Lie's body had thinned, as though he had just survived a major illness, but he had actually grown several times stronger than before. His stomach began to rumble, and Zhang Lie immediately ordered a sumptuous meal.Now that he was rich and able to generate points efficiently, he could certainly afford to spend ten points on such a meal. A robot brought it to him without much delay.After consuming Potion #1, not only did his genetic framework evolve, so too did his body, and he was now able to make use of his strength much more efficiently. More importantly, his basic gene capacity had advanced by another fifty points: Zhang Lie could now have a shocking hundred and sixty basic gene fragments.If all his other genes were at capacity, the additional sixty fragments would bring him a decisive, dominating advantage.Potion #1 was just the first step in his advancement plan; not too long into the future, he would be able to concoct Potion #2, which would increase his mutated gene capacity, as well as Potion #3, for his superior gene capacity. Eventually, he would even be able to target Potion #4, which had been incredibly scarce even in the past.Of course, with his current strength, Potion #1 was the limit. He knew where to find the herbs required for Potion #2, but would be unable to harvest them without growing stronger first. And he didn't even dare think about Potion #3.After his meal, Zhang Lie went back to concocting more potions. Potion #1 would surely revolutionize the world.It took the remainder of the day for Zhang Lie to exhaust his entire supply of blood whiskers, producing five copies of Potion #1. He wouldn't release them into the market yet, not before he grew strong enough to avoid being a target. If they were to be revealed now, given his current level of strength, he would likely be caught by one corporation or another.After packing and storing the potions, Zhang Lie cleaned up the laboratory and left, then exchanged 20,000 points for cash. Because of the magnitude of the transaction, Zhang Lie was given the currency in the form of an unassuming black card. The black card, like the checks of the past, could be redeemed for two million dollars at any bank sponsored by the world federation.It was past time to resolve his housing issues. Zhang Lie returned to the real world via the teleportation apparatus.His sister was overjoyed to see him returning, and she almost fell off her wheelchair in her impatience to reach him. Zhang Lie rushed forward and supported his sister before she could fall.Hanxiang was far too lonely: she had no friends, and her only blood relative spent most of his time within the dimensional world, without being able to accompany her. She had always been understanding and sensitive, and had barely brought the matter up to Zhang Lie, but he couldn't help but think that her loneliness was one of the reasons she had grown up so enamored with books.\"Ah, be more careful!\"\"Hehe.\" Instead of speaking, Zhang Hanxiang hugged her brother tightly and smiled in satisfaction.\"How long have I been gone?\"\"Exactly three days. Brother, if you haven't gotten any money, don't worry. We still have some time, and if worse comes to worst, we can always move out. As long as we're together, I don't care where we live!\"Zhang Lie patted his chest. \"I can handle the money issue. Tomorrow, I'll head to the Wangs' place and fix the problem.\"\"Really? Have you managed to make a lot of money in the dimensional world, Brother?\"\"Of course! When have I ever lied to you? You haven't eaten yet, have you? Shall we eat out together?\"\"Ah, a restaurant! It's been so long since I've been outside... but, won't it cost a lot? I... we'd better not go...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Inflated PriceThe indecisive Hanxiang was eventually pushed out of the door by her older brother, and the two of them had a delicious meal in a relatively high-class restaurant. Of course, Zhang Lie, who had just eaten within the dimensional world, mostly just watched his sister eat in joy.After the two of them returned home, Zhang Lie contacted a lawyer.If he were going to confront Uncle Wang directly, he had to be well-prepared. In front of his holographic screen, Zhang Lie quickly took care of the paperwork. \u00a0The lawyer he had contacted helped him draft an agreement for change of ownership; as long as Uncle Wang was willing to sign, and once he had the contract notarized, the proceedings would be complete.Early the next day, by the time Zhang Lie went to get breakfast, Hanxiang was already sitting in front of the television. After breakfast, Zhang Lie took a hovercraft to the Wang estate. Since the relationship between the two families had once been congenial, he used to frequent the Wang estate, and obviously knew where it was.The Wang estate was rather large\u2014not as large as those of famous moguls, but certainly enough to indicate significant wealth. Wang Xiaohua's father was a special-class citizen, a hunter who had reached even his superior gene capacity.When Zhang Lie pressed the doorbell, the one who answered the door was Wang Xiaohua. \"Ah, you've actually come back,\" he remarked.It wasn't particularly surprising: one day in the real world corresponded to ten in the dimensional world, and it had only been one or two real-world days since he had defeated Wang Xiaohua's group by the settlement gates.When Wang Xiaohua saw Zhang Lie, her initial shock turned into a malevolent scowl. \"And what do you think you're doing here?!\"Zhang Lie chuckled. \"What's wrong with that? We're on Earth, after all. Are you planning on calling your teammates and surrounding me here, too?\"The clash between the two of them was noticed by the other occupants of the estate. A middle-aged voice called out, \"Xiaohua, what's the matter?\"\"It's just a beggar!\" Wang Xiaohua called back.\"I'm here to resolve the issue with the house.\" Zhang Lie ignored Wang Xiaohua.Wang Xiaohua scoffed. \"Are you here to beg me for mercy after being unable to come up with the cash? Well, I'm feeling pretty good today, so I'll give you a chance.\"Zhang Lie frowned: Wang Xiaohua's sudden kindness was as unbelievable as a flying pig. She certainly had been demanding enough the day she barged into Zhang Lie's house.\"Kneel down and lick my shoes clean, and I'll consider giving you a few more days' leniency.\"Zhang Lie looked at her as though he were looking at an invalid. \"You must be overthinking things. I don't need any sort of leniency from you; I've prepared the money.\"Wang Xiaohua held her hands on her hips and began to laugh. \"It might be a rundown house, but it's still worth at least one and half million dollars. How could someone like you have been able to afford it within a matter of days? Are you crazy?\"\"Do you think I'd come over here and claim that I had the money if I didn't?\"\"Who knows how your brain functions? After all, you've spent the last three months hunting white grubs!\"\"I have the money,\" Zhang Lie repeated.Wang Xiaohua was clearly still incredulous. \"One and a half million, you understand, not a hundred thousand! Even my team would take two months to earn so much money, let alone someone like you. And I still haven't settled matters with you regarding what happened in the dimensional world! Go on, scram! Pack up and get ready to move out. I'm feeling faint just with your presence here, polluting the air around my house...\"Not wanting to hear Wang Xiaohua's endless prattle any longer, Zhang Lie pulled out his black card.\"A black card!\" Wang Xiaohua was stupefied. \"No, that's impossible! This has to be fake!\"\"You realize counterfeiting is a crime? Would I be stupid enough to try to trick you with a fake card?\"Even Wang Xiaohua understood that counterfeiting was all but impossible in this time and age.\"I've brought the contract here as well. Call your father over and have him sign it.\" Zhang Lie also retrieved a sheaf of papers from his backpack.\"Look at you, all prepared, as if you think everything will go your way!\" Wang Xiaohua mocked.\"Sorry, the stench of money coming from your place is so strong that I don't want to stay a moment longer than I have to.\"The middle-aged male voice called out again from within the manor, \"Xiaohua, who're you talking to?\"\"Don't worry, Dad!\" Wang Xiaohua replied.\"You're my daughter, and this is my house. How can I not care about what you're doing? What sort of beggar's keeping you outside for so long?\" He ambled toward Wang Xiaohua, eyes brightening when he saw Zhang Lie.\"Ah, Zhang Lie! What are you doing outside? Quick, come in, come in.\"\"Good morning, Uncle Wang. If you don't mind, I won't step inside; I'm afraid someone will get upset.\" Zhang Lie glanced toward Wang Xiaohua's cool features.\"And who would dare get upset in my house?\"Zhang Lie refused once more. \"Uncle Wang, I appreciate the offer, but a destitute weakling like me can't afford to enter such a place.\"Uncle Wang frowned. \"What's the matter, Zhang Lie?\"Wang Xiaohua stepped in front of her father. \"Dad, this guy's crazy! Ignore him!\"Uncle Wang glared at Wang Xiaohua. \"How can you speak to Zhang Lie in this manner? If not for his father, I wouldn't be alive now!\"Wang Xiaohua snorted. \"How many years has it been? Forget about that already!\"Uncle Wang, snorting in anger, raised a palm as if to strike down his ungrateful daughter.Zhang Lie interrupted impatiently, \"That's enough, Uncle Wang! Don't bother putting on a show for me; I don't have time for that. I'm here today to purchase my house.\"\"To purchase your house?\" Uncle Wang seemed incredulous.\"You're really a talented actor, Uncle Wang. Don't you know what's going on?\"Wang Xiaohua's face flushed in anger. \"Zhang Lie, haven't you had enough?!\"Uncle Wang pushed Wang Xiaohua aside as he turned to Zhang Lie. \"Zhang Lie, tell me what's going on.\"\"Don't listen to his nonsense!\" Wang Xiaohua tugged on her father's arm to no avail.Zhang Lie chuckled derisively: it looked as though Wang Xiaohua had been acting on her own accord.Without saying anything more, he handed the contract over to Uncle Wang. \"Is something wrong? Why are you suddenly asking to buy the property now?\"\"Your darling daughter forced me to, of course. She came over with the rental agreement not too long ago, stating that the agreement would be invalidated in half a month, and that we would be evicted.\"Uncle Wang turned toward his daughter and asked coldly, \"Is this true?!\"\"Dad, I'm just enforcing the contract's stipulations!\" Wang Xiaohua defended herself.Uncle Wang thundered in rage, one palm slamming against the doorframe. \"Who told you to do this?! Who gave you the right? That's my property, one that I gave to the family who saved my life! Who are you to try to reclaim it?!\"\"It's what the contract said, Dad!\"\"What the contract states is my business, not yours.\"Wang Xiaohua hung her face, aggrieved.\"Well? Apologize to Zhang Lie!\" Uncle Wang continued.\"Dad, I'm not apologizing to someone like him! He embarrassed me in the dimensional world, and I'm already showing him courtesy by not attacking him outright.\"\"If you won't apologize, then there's no place in this house for you.\"Wang Xiaohua took a step back, tears flooding from her eyes. \"I'm your daughter, aren't I? You're going to side with an outsider over me?!\"\"Are you going to apologize, or not?\"Zhang Lie interrupted the artificial act. \"Uncle Wang, it's fine. Someone like me can't bear the burden of an apology from Miss Wang here.\"He wasn't an idiot, and his life experience from the past had taught him an important lesson indeed: not to believe everything he heard.Wang Xiaohua's personality was clearly the product of an indulgent upbringing, so it certainly was jarring to see Uncle Wang behave so sternly now.In his past life, Uncle Wang had spent quite some time trying to help him hunt down his parents, but he deeply remembered how cold this Uncle Wang had been before he had made a name for himself in the dimensional world.\"It's good that you know your place.\" Wang Xiaohua folded her arms in front of her chest, smiling gleefully.However, Uncle Wang didn't intend on letting matters rest. After giving her a shake, he pressed down her head. \"Zhang Lie, don't blame my daughter. I've clearly indulged her far too much.\"Wang Xiaohua screamed in outrage. \"Dad! You're making me apologize to a piece of trash like him?!\"Zhang Lie interrupted impatiently once again, \"Uncle Wang, please sign the contract. I've spent too long here already, and my sister's waiting for me at home.\"Uncle Wang chuckled. \"Zhang Lie, what are you saying? This property's a gift for you. The only reason there was a contract in the first place was because your father was so stubborn he refused to accept it from me otherwise. Ignore the contract\u2014stay there as long as you want. No one will dare chase you out.\"No matter how much Uncle Wang wanted to pretend to be generous, his actions would speak louder than his words.No matter how Wang Xiaohua had come across this contract, the conclusion was that she had ended up with it in her possession.Uncle Wang had been lying from the very beginning. If he had truly intended to gift the property to Zhang Lie's father, he would have destroyed the rental agreement, instead of letting it land in his daughter's hands.\"Uncle Wang, I'm calling you Uncle here out of deference for you and for my father. Now that my father's missing and I'm an adult, I hope you'll respect my wishes. Please sign this contract so that I can be at peace.\"My father has always taught me to repay gratitude with gratitude. I'm thankful for your help all these years, and I'm willing to purchase this property from you at an inflated price of two million dollars. It's a generous offer for you; for me, I won't ever have to worry about someone chasing us away from our house again.\"Selling the property to me would save me significant trouble, and annul the life debt between you and my family. Doesn't that sound like a win-win situation for both of us?\"Zhang Lie presented his argument tactfully and seriously. Purchasing the property would cut the ties between their families, and it would resolve all their problems for good.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: Another ConfrontationWang Jianxin understood that Zhang Lie fully intended to sever the relationship between them, and that objecting would only repulse him further.\"Zhang Lie, this is my fault, so if you insist on buying the property, something like five hundred thousand will be more than sufficient. I know how difficult it is for you to make money, and Hanxiang will have quite a few expenses ahead, so consider the rest a sponsorship on my behalf.\"\"Thank you, Uncle Wang, but I still can't accept your generosity. I'll figure out a way to eke out a living for both me and Hanxiang. Please, sign!\" Zhang Lie once again rebuffed Uncle Wang's offer and handed him the contract and black card.Wang Jianxin frowned, criticized Wang Xiaohua, and \"reluctantly\" accepted the card and signed the contract. With this new contract in place, the old rental agreement was naturally invalidated.Zhang Lie's part in the matter would be finished as soon as he handed over the contract to his lawyer. And from then on, that rundown property in the slums would belong entirely to the two of them.Of course, this was only the beginning. Given Zhang Lie's abilities and growth potential, he swore he would bring his sister into the special-class\u2014or even royal-class\u2014residential areas. They would have more and more properties, and even a dojo of their own.When the contract was finally signed, Zhang Lie huffed a sigh of relief. \"Uncle Wang, regardless of your actual intentions, thank you.\" He bowed respectfully, then briskly turned to leave. From start to finish, he never looked at Wang Xiaohua again.Only when Zhang Lie had vanished around the corner did Wang Jianxin pull Wang Xiaohua back into the manor. \"Xiaohua, you were far too impulsive\u2014now look at what you've done!\"Wang Xiaohua still looked a little aggrieved. \"And yet you still hit me twice, Dad, just to put on a show for that piece of trash! \u00a0I really don't understand why you're so polite to an idiot with a \u00a0crippled sister. Why?!\"Wang Jianxin folded his arms in front of his chest. \"You don't understand how wily their father is. Given how much treasure he amassed before going missing, it's quite possible that he left something for his children. What's more, haven't you always claimed that Zhang Lie was at the bottom of the gene leaderboard, that he's nothing but a weakling? In that case, where did he get all this money?\"Wang Jianxin held the black card up in front of his daughter.Wang Xiaohua was equally flummoxed. Given Zhang Lie's appearance and living conditions, he certainly didn't look like the type of person who would be able to pull out two million dollars on a whim.\"I'm surprised too, Dad. He spent three months only killing white grubs, so how did he get so much money in a matter of days? But don't worry, as long as he's still in the Blacksteel settlement, I'll have an answer for you quickly enough.\"Wang Xiaohua's eyes glinted. In her mind, Zhang Lie was like a stinkbug that she could crush with her shoe.Wang Jianxin advised her, \"Don't do anything to him\u2014he doesn't look as easy to handle as you think.\"\"Don't worry, Dad! No matter how tricky he is, he's a total weakling.\" Wang Xiaohua grabbed the black card from her father, smiling. \"I'm going shopping!\"\"Newsflash! At 10 AM today, another monarch-class hunter has risen from the ranks of humanity. Congratulations to Yan Tianjun, the ninth monarch-class hunter of humanity, soon to be heading toward the fifth realm!\"Zhang Hanxiang had just pulled up an article when she noticed Zhang Lie returning. \"Brother, you're back!\"\"Mm.\" Zhang Lie put down the bags of food in his hands and responded distractedly. He was completely focused on the Chinese man currently being interviewed by reporters on the news.\"A newly birthed monarch-class trying to enter the fifth realm without any disaster-grade gene fragments... is he trying to kill himself?\"A true monarch-class hunter was one who had reached his disaster-grade gene capacity in the fourth realm before heading to the fifth.Monarch-level hunters were incredibly dangerous hunters who were able to damage the very skies with their attacks, and humanity shouldn't have had more than three true monarchs at this point in time.He had deliberately lowered his voice to avoid being overheard by his sister, but he hadn't accounted for how sharp her ears were. Zhang Hanxiang asked curiously, \"Brother, why do you say that monarch-class hunters shouldn't enter the fifth realm?\"\"Many people know about the fourth realm: the final battlefield between mankind and genetic lifeforms. But do you know about the fifth realm?\"Zhang Hanxiang shook her head. \"I'm not a fifth-realm god-class hunter, so how would I know what it contains?\"\"Hell!\"Zhang Hanxiang was stupefied. \"Isn't information about the fifth realm restricted by the world federation? How do you know about it, Brother?\"Zhang Lie rolled his eyes at her. \"After all, I'm a hunter myself. Isn't it normal that I would know a little about this sort of stuff? The information's only restricted for regular citizens, not hunters.\"In truth, most hunters knew nothing about the fifth realm, not even lord-class hunters who were about to ascend to the fourth realm. At this point in time, there surely weren't more than a hundred hunters in the fourth realm.As soon as people started to understand the horrors of the fifth realm, perhaps no one would be willing to ascend. And without an influx of hunters as reinforcements, those monarch-class and god-class hunters who had advanced to the fifth realm would surely all perish.Their death would represent the start of a new dark age for humanity: now too weak to protect themselves, humans would quickly be enslaved by more powerful aliens.Zhang Lie knew about the fifth realm because he was once a fourth-realm hunter.It was thought that monarch-class hunters would be able to stand against an onslaught of disaster-grade lifeforms. In hindsight, however, no force of humanity was yet strong enough to kill such creatures in bulk.Hunters were only able to hunt disaster-grade lifeforms in earnest as the result of a series of remarkable inventions and discoveries over the next decade.However, just because other hunters weren't able to do so didn't mean that Zhang Lie couldn't. \u00a0He murmured to himself, \"Since I've come back in time, I'll certainly prevent the tragedy of mankind this time around.\"Hanxiang smiled as she prodded her brother. \"What are you mumbling to yourself, Brother?\"\"It's nothing. Let's eat, and then I'll have to head out again.\"Zhang Hanxiang pursed her lips. \"Ah, right\u2014did Uncle Wang agree to sell us the house?\"\"Of course! Nothing would ever fail with your brother in charge!\"\"Really? That's wonderful!\"\"Haha, we have a house now! This house is purely ours!\"Zhang Hanxiang's tinkling laughter resounded in the small house.After having an enjoyable lunch with his sister, Zhang Lie again returned to the settlement. The first thing he did was browse through the trading post. The five potbellied-toad soulshards had all been auctioned off as he had indicated, and he had earned a huge profit.The main currency used within the settlement wasn't federation money, but instead the points that could be obtained by trading in the meat and flesh of genetic lifeforms.The five soulshards alone had brought him 13,000 points.While fighting the potbellied toads, Zhang Lie had found himself lacking a multi-target skill, lowering his hunting efficiency significantly, and he hoped to rectify that deficiency now.Unfortunately, even after an exhaustive search, he had found quite a number of suitable fire-attuned techniques, but no water-attuned ones. Either the techniques themselves were lacking, or they weren't suitable for Zhang Lie's hunting style.Since he couldn't find a suitable water-attuned technique, he would let them come to him instead. Moments later, he posted a new request on the trading post offering ten thousand points for a high-grade multi-target water-attuned technique.Of course, he still anonymized himself; Zhang Lie didn't want to be noticed just yet.Finally, he walked out of the settlement, preparing to return to the Bloodcrystal Valley to continue gathering blood whiskers.Just like last time, however, he found himself surrounded by people once again: none other than Wang Xiaohua and her team, and now even her boyfriend, Qin Xiaotian, and his team as well. A dozen people encircled Zhang Lie.A large crowd had gathered by the settlement gates, watching the commotion.\"Oho, it looks like there's no way out for our poor king of the dumps this time.\"\"Wang Xiaohua's a tricky hunter to antagonize, after all.\"\"Who's second-to-last on the gene leaderboard? He must be feeling pretty upset right now.\"\"Ha, he's already last! Zhang Lie hid his ranking on the gene leaderboard about a month ago.\"\"Eh? Who was the one who said that Zhang Lie was actually hiding his strength? Look at him now!\"Ignoring the crowd, Zhang Lie focused on Wang Xiaohua. \"Wang Xiaohua, do you really have nothing better to do?\"\"Ah! Xiaotian, look at how rude this fellow is!\" Wang Xiaohua, as if shocked, grabbed the young man by her side coyly.Qin Xiaotian smirked, then turned to Zhang Lie with a look of disdain. \"So, you're Zhang Lie? Xiaohua told me you've been bullying her lately. How'd you get your strength? Some fortuitous encounter? Tell me and I'll give you a clean death!\"Qin Xiaotian was the younger cousin of Qin Xiao, currently third on the gene leaderboard. He was handsome in a boyish way, but was notorious for being small-minded and petty. Because of his cousin's strength as a hunter, there were few who dared to challenge him.In truth, Zhang Lie didn't want to start a feud with him at this juncture, but there was little he could do now. Based on his ranking on the gene leaderboard, Qin Xiaotian had surely filled his mutated gene fragments to capacity, and Qin Xiao would surely have helped him get a few superior gene fragments too.And his framework was, at this point, only comparable to a mortal-grade framework. The only advantage that he had over Qin Xiaotian was his superior-grade soulshard. Perhaps that would be sufficient to deal with Qin Xiaotian, but what about all his lackeys?Zhang Lie couldn't take them all head-on. In that case, he had to avoid a direct confrontation\u2014\"Hah, you think I'll lose to you so easily? Try me on, you pieces of trash!\"\u2014but that didn\u2019t mean he had to suffer their insults without retaliation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: Secluded GladeWith a resounding boom, the crowd saw Zhang Lie's body glowing blue as a translucent ball blossomed into existence around him, knocking those hunters surrounding him aside. As the crowd watched on, Zhang Lie, his entire body still encased in the sphere generated by the superior white-grub soulshard, bounced off into the distance.Qin Xiaotian gaped in amazement: how could Zhang Lie, well known to be at the bottom of the gene leaderboard, handle such a confrontation so calmly? It looked as though he really was hiding his strength\u2014and the soulshard that he was using didn't seem too bad, either.\"Interesting. Go on, chase him! Don't kill him too quickly, though, I want to play with him!\"Qin Xiaotian's eyes lit up as he stared at Zhang Lie's fleeing form.His lackeys immediately raced after Zhang Lie, circulating their genetic energy for a boost to their speed. However, they had clearly underestimated Zhang Lie's capabilities.In mid-air, Zhang Lie activated his galewolf soulshard, bouncing away even more rapidly than before. He was moving so rapidly that even Qin Xiaotian's lackeys, each of which had reached their mutated gene capacity, weren't able to catch up despite using everything they could.\"Not bad, not bad!\" Surprisingly, Qin Xiaotian seemed to grow even more excited, and he pulled Wang Xiaohua with him as he joined in the chase.The more exceptional Zhang Lie's performance, the more secrets he was hiding, and the more treasure Qin Xiaotian would be able to paw from his corpse.Qin Xiaotian's lackeys weren't weak, and even though they wouldn't be able to match Zhang Lie's speed in the short term, he couldn't shake them off either. In the end, they vanished out of sight from the onlookers by the settlement gates, all of whom were chattering with each other in shock.\"Have I gone blind?! That Zhang Lie actually managed to escape from Qin Xiaotian's team that easily?\"\"Haha, who was the one who said that Zhang Lie was dead meat? I knew he was hiding something!\"\"Surely that's a mutated-grade soulshard, at the very least? And we all thought he was useless!\"\"Don't you guys think that that ball looks familiar?\"\"...like a white grub core?!\"\"Damn, could it be?\"\"Do you think... that was the reason why that guy spent three months hunting white grubs?\"\"Haha, you guys must be crazy! When have you ever heard of mutated-grade white grubs? No one has ever seen any!\"\"No, I'll have to check it out for myself!\"\"Heh, you fool! Don't believe everything you hear! What I'd really like to know is whether or not he can escape this time.\"\"You think he can make it out of Qin Xiaotian's clutches, and\u00a0I'm\u00a0the fool?!\" Surely he wouldn't be able to escape!\"Wanna bet?\" A heavily bearded man turned to the agitated youth by his side.The brash youth inclined his neck, refusing to back down. \"What stakes?\"The bearded man chuckled. \"Say, a small bet of ten thousand points?\"Ten thousand points?! That wasn't a small bet at all!\u00a0The youth hesitated, causing the bearded man to snicker.\"What, you don't even have ten thousand points?\"Of course, the youth took the bait. \"You think I'm afraid of you? You're on!\"Their conversation had been loud enough, and the crowd bored enough, that the two-person bet had quickly ballooned into something that even the three large corporations of the dimensional world had a stake in.Of course, most hunters bet that Zhang Lie would die, especially those in the know from the large corporations. They were intimately familiar with the strongest hunters of the dimensional world.And even though Qin Xiaotian wasn't all that strong, Qin Xiao's name was known to all. He was a bossy and domineering fellow, yet one who would protect anyone in his posse. Qin Xiaotian had surely gleaned quite a few benefits from him.Meanwhile, one and a half months ago, Zhang Lie had clearly been at the bottom of the gene leaderboard. Even if he had had a chance encounter, there was no conceivable way that his strength could exceed Qin Xiaotian's.The dimensional world wasn't like reality; except in settlements, the rule of law didn't apply. The strong could do what they wanted. And Qin Xiaotian wasn't alone: his entire team was with him. Zhang Lie had no escape. As a result, the odds quickly tilted in Qin Xiaotian's favor, eventually settling on a hundred-to-one odds against Zhang Lie's survival.Of course, Zhang Lie had no clue what was happening back in the settlement; otherwise, he would have bankrupted himself to join in the bet.As he bounced through the dimensional world, Zhang Lie's eyes glinted.The world was so large that, despite having been discovered decades ago, there were still a few mysterious regions that weren't common knowledge. And since his pursuers were still quite a distance away, Zhang Lie was, for the most part, free of any danger.Based on his understanding of the dimensional world, there was no way he wouldn't be able to escape Qin Xiaotian's pursuit. In fact, what he was thinking of wasn't escape, but retaliation.Qin Xiaotian's intent was clear: to chase him until his stamina gave out, and then to capture him alive. In that case, he certainly wasn't going to take it easy on them.After travelling hundreds of kilometers, Zhang Lie's genetic energy was flagging. His pursuers grew ever closer, but Zhang Lie's face became more and more relaxed. Right in front of him was a particularly dangerous part of the dimensional world\u2014the Night Forest.\"Stop running away, coward!\" Qin Xiaotian's team shouted upon seeing Zhang Lie about to escape into the forest.\"Heh.\" Zhang Lie ignored their cries as he bounced inside.The pursuers hesitated by the boundary of the forest. Behind them, Qin Xiaotian called out,\"Go on, keep chasing him! He's all but depleted of genetic energy by now, and he won't be able to go much farther.\"As a result, the entire team followed him into the forest.Zhang Lie turned back and grinned. He knew just where he would lead them.Once within the forest, Zhang Lie had morphed his bubble into two soft, flexible whips, which he used to swing through the trees like an agile monkey. He led the hunters following him to a lake within the forest. It was fed by a waterfall, one that the hunters could clearly hear from afar.\"We're at the Moonlit Pond!\" Qin Xiaotian exclaimed, glancing at Zhang Lie, who was standing right beneath the mouth of the waterfall.He had once been to the area with his cousin Qin Xiao. It was a rather famous location within the Night Forest, and it was said that a particularly dangerous dragon-type lifeform lived within the pond.Apparently, it was an exceedingly rare superior-grade moonlight wyrm. There had been quite a few hunters itching to hunt down such valuable prey, but no credible sightings had been reported within the last decade, and the rumors had turned into legends.It looked as though Zhang Lie was so desperate that he had no other choice to run here, believing in a legend.Just as Qin Xiaotian was about to order his team to surround Zhang Lie, however, he ran through the waterfall and vanished from sight.\"Hm?\" Even Qin Xiaotian was amazed that Zhang Lie had prepared such a way out for himself.\"Quick, chase after him!\"Of course, no matter what Zhang Lie did, he was sure that he would catch him today. Because, just like Zhang Lie, he wanted to kill any threats before they grew into larger problems.\"Captain, it looks like there's an entrance here!\" Qin Xiaotian's team quickly found a cave opening behind the waterfall.\"Enter, but be careful of any sneak attacks!\"Qin Xiaotian's team rushed into the cave. Darkness smothered them. The scout in front held one palm up, a flame by his fingertips, as he forged onward. His other hand was holding a blade.His name was Fang Qiong, and he was the deputy captain under Qin Xiaotian. His genetic framework was high-grade and fire-attuned, and his basic and mutated gene fragments were filled to capacity. He possessed three mutated-grade soulshards, and the blade in his hand was B-grade.After three minutes, the pursuers walked out of the cave into what seemed to be a secluded glade. Everything in the glade was tinged a royal, mysterious, purple: the grasses and plants growing from the ground, the vines hanging from trees, even the trees themselves, filled with rich and resplendent fruits.Qin Xiaotian's sharp eyes immediately spotted a few exceedingly rare and precious herbs.\"This place is filled with treasures! Captain, we're rich!\"\"Right, Captain, all this is ours!\"Wang Xiaohua, Fang Qiong, and the others had also noticed the rare plants that seemed to grow like common weeds in this hidden glade.They had almost forgotten that they were here chasing after Zhang Lie. And they certainly didn't notice Zhang Lie, covered in some purple powder, watching them from afar up a little hill.\"Go on, laugh while you can. No matter how many herbs you pick now, you're all going to die!\" Zhang Lie stared at his pursuers as though they were already nothing more than corpses. It was only then that Qin Xiaotian and the others finally noticed Zhang Lie in the distance.In truth, it wasn't that they weren't paying attention, but that Zhang Lie, covered in purple powder, blended in too well with the surroundings.Looking at his unconventional appearance, as well as his smile, Qin Xiaotian suddenly felt a sense of unease. He had deliberately led them inside this hidden glade, so there had to be some danger in here for them.\"Zhang Lie, your tricks are nothing in the face of absolute power! Since you've brought us here, I'll give you a clean death. Fang Qiong, get him!\"\"Yes, Captain!\"Qin Xiaotian decided to kill Zhang Lie on the spot to prevent any complications from arising.\"Xiaotian, don't! I still have a few questions for him!\" Wang Xiaohua pleaded, clearly intending on ferreting out some information regarding Zhang Lie's inheritance from his father.After all, Zhang Lie's sudden growth in power made it quite clear to her that he had inherited something good. It would certainly agree with her father\u2019s hypothesis.Just then, when Fang Qiong had only taken a half-step toward Zhang Lie and Qin Xiaotian and Wang Xiaohua were locked in dispute, a mysterious susurrus began to emanate from the cave behind them.Qin Xiaotian and the others immediately turned around, eyes widening in shock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Scorpion Horde\"Ah, scorpions! So many of them...\" Wang Xiaohua began to shriek after a moment of stupefied silence.Indeed, scorpions. Countless scorpions with a violet, crystalline exoskeleton were skittering out of the cave and the greenery surrounding them, fading in and out of existence as though they were ghostly spirits.They were only palm-sized, but could move surprisingly quickly. The tips of their stingers was a dark violet, and they were of a breed that even Qin Xiaotian didn't recognize. In an instant, the scorpions surrounded Qin Xiaotian's team.Strangely enough, there were also quite a few scorpions by Zhang Lie's side, but even though they crawled on his body, they showed no signs of attacking him.\"Haha, they're finally here! These venombane scorpions hate fire, so I hope you're all prepared to die!\" Zhang Lie no longer bothered to hide his killing intent.Ding! Ding! Qin Xiaotian's body glowed golden, and he began swinging his blade. Wang Xiaohua, Fang Qiong, and the others all took on fighting stances, killing the scorpions which swarmed toward them from within the cave. Even the scorpions' blood was purple in color, and sprays of purple mist began filling the air.\"Hah, is this all you can do?\" Qin Xiaotian scoffed, having defeated the first wave of scorpions with ease.\"Oh, we're just getting started,\" Zhang Lie called out, laughing. He sat down by the top of the hill, lazing luxuriantly as he watched Qin Xiaotian.As furious as he was, Qin Xiaotian and his team was surrounded by a veritable sea of scorpions, and he had no way of attacking him over such a distance.The scorpions seemed to come at them in an endless tide.Qin Xiaotian bellowed, \"Just you wait, you bastard! I'll make you suffer a fate worse than death!\"Then, he immediately began commanding his team. \"Fang Qiong, use the four-spirit formation we devised!\"Beside him, Fang Qiong and three of his other teammates each activated a transformation-type soulshard and morphed into a lava tiger, a vine asp, a firebird, and a crysturtle, four curious lifeforms.The tiger howled, the snake hissed, the bird called out, and the turtle bayed. After their transformation, they had lost the agility and techniques of their human form, but their size and strength were magnified.The combination of the four transformations was devastating.But although they were able to beat back the tide of scorpions, the scorpions continued swarming at them without any sign of stopping, no matter how many carcasses of their own kind they had to wade through.The four lifeforms were arrayed at each corner of a square formation, protecting the rest of their teammates within. They tried to rush out of the entrapment, towards the hill Zhang Lie was on.Most of the venombane scorpions were only regular-grade lifeforms, with a few mutated-grade ones scattered among them. Even the most advanced scorpions were only superior-grade. But no matter their level of evolution, all venombane scorpions shared two characteristics:First, a surprising level of stealth.Second, venomous poison, of a particularly dangerous sort!Qin Xiaotian's team had already experienced the scorpions' stealth: after all, even Qin Xiaotian, who had quite a few superior gene fragments, hadn't noticed anything amiss upon entering the glade.The poison was even more frightening, and was rightly the characteristic by which these venombane scorpions were named.The scorpions actually had two types of poison: one from their poison sacs and released through their stingers, which would quickly induce cell apoptosis and death. Without the antidote or suppression by genetic energy, it could kill a hunter in a matter of seconds.The second type of poison was from their blood, which rapidly vaporized when exposed to the atmosphere, forming a poison mist. Those who came in contact with the mist would find the poison seeping through their skin, leading to paralysis.\"Be careful, they're poisonous!\" As the mist grew more and more dense around Qin Xiaotian's team, he shouted out a warning.A large part of Qin Xiaotian's strength was due to his connections and wealth, yes, but he wasn't stupid. Scorpion-type lifeforms were closely linked to poison, and he had been wary of the possibility since the beginning. However, he had noticed the poisonous mist far too late.Zhang Lie had laid out his plan carefully, and he wouldn't have lured them here if he didn't think he could get away with it. Despite the hunters' attempts to flee the sea of scorpions, there were simply so many scorpions that they were stuck no matter what they did.The problem was especially bad in Fang Qiong's corner of the square formation: despite knowing that his body was covered in flames, anathema to the scorpions, they still swarmed him preferentially, choosing to die just to inject their venom into his body through their stingers.Of course, under the effects of a mutated-grade soulshard, regular-grade venombane scorpions could do nothing to him. With the four transformation-type soulshards active, although they couldn't force their way out, neither could the scorpions break through their defenses. Unfortunately, the transformation-type soulshards consumed so much genetic energy that they couldn't keep it up for long.\"Xiaotian, we won't be able to break through this sea of scorpions. We need to retreat; we can't last too long like this!\"\"Right, Captain, he's just a rookie! We can nab him whenever we want, there's no need to waste our time here!In the midst of the formation, Wang Xiaohua and Qin Xiaotian's remaining team members tried to persuade him to retreat, especially Wang Xiaohua.The moment she saw these scorpions, she felt a strange premonition of impending doom, a prickling sensation that grew worse upon seeing Zhang Lie's bloodthirsty gaze. At the moment, she couldn't think of anything else besides fleeing.\"No, we have to teach him a lesson now! He won't get away with luring us into this trap!\" He raised an outstretched hand, and a resplendent golden javelin began to manifest.\"[Demonbreaker Javelin]! Die!\" With a yell, the javelin in Qin Xiaotian's hand began to glow.The golden light flashed so quickly toward Zhang Lie that it reached him in the blink of an eye. However, unexpectedly, a thick, translucent wall popped into existence just as the spear was about to hit him. The javelin, tossed with great strength, shot toward the wall like a comet, only to be trapped halfway into the wall. It exploded in a burst of golden light.Zhang Lie didn't even flinch.Qin Xiaotian's eyes widened in shock. \"How\u2014how can this be?! That was a mutated-grade one-use javelin, and it'd be able to break through the defenses of even a regular superior-grade lifeform! How could the attack have been blocked by that technique?!\"Unless, unless\u2026 No, that's impossible! How could a guy like that have gotten his hands on a soulshard of that caliber... no, something had to have gone wrong!\"\"Xiaotian, stop muttering to yourself! We need to leave, or we'll die!\"\"Captain, look at Zhou Ming's firebird transformation! He's moving a little woodenly, and I think something's wrong!\"While Qin Xiaotian continued to gape in shock, Wang Xiaohua and his subordinates continued trying to persuade him to leave. The poison mist was spreading all around them, and Qin Xiaotian knew that they would all be in serious danger if they didn't leave now.He glared at Zhang Lie and bitterly called out, \"Retreat! We'll leave through the cave and get this bastard some other time!\"Of course, the venombane scorpions certainly weren't going to let this crowd of intruders leave so easily. As if sensing that the other party had just called a retreat, the already-furious scorpions swarmed toward Qin Xiaotian's team in even greater numbers than before.Even worse, the mutated-grade venombane scorpions, dispersed within the crowd, had also begun to attack.Suddenly, whirling winds surrounded the time. As Fang Qiong\u2019s firebird form flapped its wings furiously, the venombane scorpions surrounding the team were all flung aside. But just as he thought that the coast was clear, a burst of violet light darted toward the teammates behind him.\"Argh!\" With a pained yelp, behind the firebird, one of Qin Xiaotian's subordinates collapsed.\"He Feng!\" Qin Xiaotian and another subordinate shouted He Feng's name simultaneously.However, He Feng didn't respond. He slumped onto the ground like a marionette whose strings had been cut. By the right side of his neck, a hole about as wide as a finger was leaking purple blood, and the flesh around the wound was quickly necrotizing.\"Be careful! There are mutated-grade scorpions around us!\" A hunter on the left flank fortuitously dodged another flash of purple light. Just as he called out, however, the scorpion struck again, tearing his ear apart.Qin Xiaotian, scowling fiercely, a golden sword in his hands, sliced at an incoming blur. \"Watch out, there's more than one!\"Even Zhang Lie had to admit that he wasn't a weakling.Mutated-grade venombane scorpions wouldn't drop their stealth until the moment right before their attack, and the fact that he was able to notice and respond so quickly meant that he had to have at least twenty superior gene fragments. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to defeat them with a single blow.Zhang Lie was very glad that he hadn't opted for a direct confrontation.Of course, killing just a single mutated-grade venombane scorption didn't change things; after all, the entire glade was a nest of scorpions. A death or two were meaningless in terms of the number of scorpions that were still swarming toward them.And even if Qin Xiaotian was able to handle a mutated-grade venombane scorpion, the rest of his teammates and Wang Xiaohua could not. He might be able to save one or two of them, but there were bound to be more casualties.Shouting in pain, another hunter fell to the ground. Even the four transformed hunters were starting to falter, and the square formation was breaking apart. If Qin Xiaotian didn't do something, the team that he had worked so hard to build would all perish in this nightmarish glade.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: Blood FeudAs his teammates fell one by one, Qin Xiaotian howled, \"Zhang Lie, I'll kill you!\"A blinding golden light emanated from Qin Xiaotian's body. Amidst the swirl of genetic energy, he morphed into a gigantic gold pangolin, the effect of a superior-grade transformation-type soulshard!Zhang Lie's eyes widened. A transformation-type soulshard was rare enough, let alone a superior-grade one. It would be sure to fetch a good price if he were to auction it off.Unfortunately, it wasn't a human-type lifeform, so the transformation would render one incapable of using genetic techniques. Otherwise, its price would definitely rise at least a hundredfold.Qin Xiao must like his cousin quite a bit to have sent him such a rare soulshard\u2026 Well, I'll thank him for the kindness in advance!\u00a0Zhang Lie ignored the fuss Qin Xiaotian was making, treating the soulshard in Qin Xiaotian's hand as though it already belonged to him.By the cave entrance, Qin Xiaotian\u2019s claws swiped at the air around him, forcing even those mutated-grade venombane scorpions lurking around him to retreat. The next moment, he grabbed Wang Xiaohua. His scales began to twist rapidly, as though he were a golden drill. With a tremendous grinding sound, he burrowed into the earth.Except for the four transformed lifeforms, the remainder of Qin Xiaotian's team quickly ran into the hole he had created. Fang Qiong, Zhou Ming, and the other two hunters prepared to cancel their transformations and followed suit.The transformation had drained them of much of their genetic energy, and their constant exposure to the poisonous mist was making them muddleheaded.Right after Fang Qiong and Zhou Ming made it into the burrowed hole, however, Zhao Ping and Zheng Cang, who had transformed into the vine asp and crysturtle respectively, felt their transformations break involuntarily and their soulshards forcibly recalled.Neither of them had enough genetic energy to maintain their transformation any longer. Before the two of them could recover from the shock, the wave of scorpions engulfed them.\"Damn it! Hurry, we have to run!\" Fang Qiong and Zhou Ming had no choice but to collapse the entrance to the underground hole.Thus ended the fight between the venombane scorpions and Qin Xiaotian's team. Both sides had suffered massive losses.The once-idyllic glade had been covered in a layer of scorpion carcasses, along with the blood of eight hunters.Qin Xiaotian's thirteen-person team had shrunk by more than half. Furthermore, the surviving hunters were all poisoned, and Zhang Lie had no intention of letting them leave safely. Qin Xiaotian had declared a blood feud between them, and neither of them would rest easily before the other was dead.However, Zhang Lie wasn't in much of a hurry. The poison in the scorpions' blood was slow-acting, but its effects were particularly difficult to dispel. He was certain that Qin Xiaotian and the others wouldn't be able to find an antidote in the short term.After a few minutes, when the scorpions had finally retreated, Zhang Lie walked over to the eight corpses and began collecting his spoils. None of their flesh or bones remained, and the soulshards in their soulspace had naturally vanished with them.All Zhang Lie could recover were their weapons. A spear, three polearms, and four blades: the weapons of the eight deceased hunters were quickly thrown into Zhang Lie's potbellied-toad pouch.Subsequently, he activated his galewolf soulshard and [Rippling Walk], then ran out through the cave, chasing after the remnants of Qin Xiaotian's team. The moment he returned to the waterfall, Zhang Lie discovered something amiss. There were no traces of upturned ground near the tunnel entrance or the lakeside. Even by the nearby forests, Zhang Lie couldn't see any fallen trees or disturbed soil. Given Qin Xiaotian's condition, he could hardly be so careful as to avoid detection.In that case... Zhang Lie turned around and ran back into the venombane glade. Evidently, knowing that Zhang Lie would chase after him, Qin Xiaotian had burrowed deeper into the forest rather than out beyond the cave. Unfortunately for him, Zhang Lie was an experienced hunter, and saw through his trick immediately.Deep within the glade, by an upturned heap of soil, Qin Xiaotian, Wang Xiaohua, Fang Qiong, Zhou Ming, and another hunter slumped against the ground. At Qin Xiaotian's feet was all manner of empty potion bottles.\"Damn it, none of these antidotes are working!\"After swallowing another dose of antidote, Qin Xiaotian began to shout in frustration. His genetic energy was slowly being sapped away, and the extremities of his body were slowly falling into paralysis.\"Xiaotian, what do we do? What do we do?! Are we going to die of poison?\" Wang Xiaohua trembled as she held back her tears. In the end, Wang Xiaohua was only a young woman. When faced with the prospect of death, how could she remain calm?Of course, the other hunters were much the same way.Hearing Wang Xiaohua's words, Fang Qiong, who had suffered the brunt of the scorpions' attack, squeezed his insensate palm. Clutching onto a forlorn hope, he asked, \"Captain, could it be that the antidote just hasn't taken effect yet? All your antidotes are top-tier, after all!\"\"The apothecary you bought all these antidotes from surely wouldn't sell us fake potions, would they?\" Zhou Ming suggested.Qin Xiaotian waved his arm in frustration. \"No, these antidotes work fine. The poison is just too tricky to deal with!\"Fang Qiong couldn't help but groan. \"To think we were tricked by a weakling like him!\"\"Wang Xiaohua, it's all your fault! If not for you, Qin Xiaotian wouldn't be fighting against this fellow in the first place. You've killed everyone!\" Zhou Ming's despairing accusation made Qin Xiaotian glance thoughtfully at Wang Xiaohua.However, it was only one glance. After all, he understood quite well that he was the one who had brought them all to this juncture.On the other hand, Wang Xiaohua, indicted by Zhou Ming, suddenly shouted, \"That's right! Zhang Lie! We just need to find him! While we were fighting, the poisonous mist spread all over the glade, but Zhang Lie wasn't affected! He must either have the antidote or know some way of avoiding the poison!\"Xiaotian, we just need to go find Zhang Lie! As long as we promise him some resources, I'm sure he'll give us the antidote!\"The other hunters' eyes brightened, but then they looked toward her as though she were an idiot.\"What's the matter? Are you all too prideful?\" Wang Xiaohua asked, confused.This time, none of the other hunters bothered to look at her. She was a sheltered orchid in a greenhouse, and clearly didn't understand the true nature of the dimensional world.As she felt her body slowly seizing up, Wang Xiaohua began to cry. \"Xiaotian, I'm begging you, can't we ask Zhang Lie for help?\"\"Xiaohua, you're too naive! We gain nothing from asking him except for revealing the fact that we've all been weakened. But you don't have to worry too much\u2014given my cousin's reputation in the dimensional world, he might give us a shameful beating, but he wouldn't dare take our lives.\"As for the poison in our bodies, after circulating my genetic energy a few times, I've found that it only has paralytic properties. At worst, we'll be stiff for a few hours. The purple powder that we saw on that fellow should be the key to avoiding the scorpions' poison.Furthermore, the fact that we're now deep within the glade rather than out by the waterfall means that it'll take quite a while longer to find us. As long as we make it through the next few hours, we can still beat him!\"Qin Xiaotian was exceedingly patient with Wang Xiaohua, not only dissuading her from her inane decision, but also giving her hope to live.\"Really? Xiaotian, this poison isn't lethal?\" Despite Qin Xiaotian's patient explanation, Wang Xiaohua still seemed quite doubtful, causing Fang Qiong and Zhou Ming to let out twin glares of impatience.They were about to mock her\u2014while their mouths could still move\u2014when they heard a chuckle from the distance.\"Haha, of course it's true. Qin Xiaotian, it looks like you're not an idiot after all! In that case, shall we have a little talk?\"Zhang Lie appeared from a distance.\"Zhang Lie!\" Fang Qiong, Zhou Ming, and Wang Xiaohua all exclaimed in shock.Qin Xiaotian, on the other hand, lying on the ground with his four limbs all but paralyzed, knew that he'd lost. Rather than panic, however, he smiled coldly. \"Alright, you win. What do you want from me?\"Zhang Lie's face warped in greed. \"Soulshards, all the soulshards in your soulspace!\"\"You're a little greedy, aren't you? You're sure you want my soulshards?\" Qin Xiaotian's simmering anger was reflected in his words.Zhang Lie retrieved the spear he had picked up from one of his teammates' carcasses, then pointed it at Qin Xiaotian. \"Are you threatening me?\"\"Consider it a warning. Most of my soulshards are from my cousin. How do you think he'll react when he finds that you've got them all?\"\"Qin Xiao, you mean? I'd like to spar with him if I get the chance. That reminds me, didn't you claim you were going to give me a beating?\"Zhang Lie's face was calm, but Qin Xiaotian could see the pale blue energy emanating from his body, as well as the spear pointed directly at his chest, its tip glinting.And even though he knew he had to remain calm, Qin Xiaotian shuddered. \"No, wait! I'll give you my soulshards, all of them!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: Stealthy ReturnIt was clear that Zhang Lie was motivated by his greed, and Qin Xiaotian would certainly prefer bankruptcy to death. Angering him at this critical juncture would be a terribly unwise decision. In that case, he had no choice but to give in.A dozen soulshards, including the superior-grade transformation-type soulshard he'd been eyeing earlier, ended up in Zhang Lie's hands.The dimensional world was a curious entity, with its own rules and will. A human, upon entering the dimensional world, would unlock a soulspace granted by the will of the world. This soulspace was where hunters could store their soulshards.Hunters' strength came from four sources: their framework, their soulshards, their gene fragments, and their genetic energy. Their gene fragments represented their strength and constitution; their framework, the nature and maximum capacity of their genetic energy; their techniques, different ways of unleashing that energy.Soulshards complemented and augmented a hunter's suite of techniques. To some extent, the quality of a hunter's soulshards dictated their maximum strength, and having an assortment of valuable soulshards was a hunter's greatest treasure. All hunters' soulspaces were protected by the will of the world, and no one else could steal a soulshard from another hunter's soulspace.Qin Xiaotian's soulshards would clearly be the cream of the crop. Most of his remaining soulshards were also of the exceedingly rare transformation type, and Zhang Lie had just received a veritable fortune.\"You truly are rich, Young Master Qin. I'll accept your gift with gratitude.\" Zhang Lie affected a smarmy smile as he swiped Qin Xiaotian's soulshards. In his head, Qin Xiaotian thought to himself,\u00a0Shameless bastard!Of course, he didn't dare say so out loud. \"Zhang Lie, friend, now that I've given you these soulshards, won't you hand us the antidote?\"Zhang Lie roared with laughter. \"Eh, didn't you say you would stop at nothing to kill me? I'm not sure I want a friend like you, Qin Xiaotian.\"\"Wang Xiaohua, you're up next. Qin Xiaotian bought his life with all his soulshards\u2014what about you?\" Zhang Lie pointed the spear toward Wang Xiaohua.When she saw the glinting spearhead, she immediately panicked. \"Zhang Lie, I'm begging you, don't kill me! I'll give you everything I have!\"It was only now that Wang Xiaohua understood that the young man she had forsaken was no weakling at all\u2014he was only biding his time. She very much regretted provoking him repeatedly just for a bit of face.Surprisingly, Zhang Lie was quite genial to her. \"In that case, hand over your soulshards. As for your points, we can discuss that once we're back in the settlement.\"\"Al-Alright! Here!\" Wang Xiaohua immediately offered her palm to him, and Zhang Lie took all of her soulshards with a careless swipe of his hand.Of course, compared to Qin Xiaotian, Wang Xiaohua's soulshards were far more inferior. Except for one or two mutated-grade soulshards, the others were all relatively mundane. That didn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t take them all, however. There were at least a hundred settlements dotted all over the dimensional world, and soulshards were always in hot demand.The rest was easy. Fang Qiong, Zhou Ming, and the last remaining member of Qin Xiaotian's team all handed over their soulshards in turn, having watched their captain and Wang Xiaohua do so.Combined, Zhang Lie had obtained over forty soulshards from Qin Xiaotian's party. Since the remaining three members of Qin Xiaotian's team were hunters that Qin Xiaotian had intended on supporting in earnest, their soulshards were far superior to those that Wang Xiaohua had.After collecting everyone's soulshards, Zhang Lie patted his hands and smiled.\"Zhang Lie, now that you've accepted all our soulshards, won't you give us the antidote?\" Qin Xiaotian asked carefully. His body had now been completely paralyzed, and even speaking was starting to get difficult. It felt far too uncomfortable to have his life be in someone else's hands, and he wanted to end this nightmarish scenario as quickly as he could.Right after he spoke, however, the other hunters heard a clean snick and saw a fountain of blood. Wang Xiaohua, Fang Qiong, and the others looked on in horror as Qin Xiaotian's head toppled from his body.\"Ah\u2014Ahhh!\"\"Captain!\" You damned\u2014\"\"Zhang Lie, you're not trust\u2014\"Wang Xiaohua screamed again, and Fang Qiong and the others began to curse Zhang Lie, but Zhang Lie's blade had reached them before any of them could finish.\"When did I say I would spare any of you?\" Zhang Lie asked, almost rhetorically. The only hunter still alive was Wang Xiaohua. Of course, the reason Zhang Lie had kept her alive wasn't because he pitied her, but because he would need her to take the blame.After dealing with Qin Xiaotian and the others, Zhang Lie strode forward toward Qin Xiaohua's prone body.\"Don't kill me! Zhang Lie, I'm begging you, don't kill me! I'll do anything you ask me to!\"A sudden stink filled the air: in her extreme fear, Wang Xiaohua had involuntarily defecated. The scene in front of her eyes was simply too frightening! The hunter by her side had been Qin Xiaotian, scion of the branch of the Qin clan in Jiangdu, and Zhang Lie had killed him without even blinking an eye, as though he were simply squashing a bug!And all the other hunters beside her\u2014their clans weren't as rich or influential, but still notable and powerful in their own right. How could Zhang Lie have killed all of them?! And if he was daring enough to kill them, wouldn't he also kill her?Faced with the overwhelming prospect of death, Wang Xiaohua broke down.\"I'm so-sorry! Please, it's all my fault, I shouldn't have left you, I shouldn't have looked down on you, I shouldn't have made trouble for you at your house! It's all my fault! Zhang Lie, I'm begging you... Please don't kill me!\"\"Ah, what's this? What happened to Young Miss Wang, who commanded me to beg at the settlement gates for her favor? What, have you learned your mistake?\"Honestly, I don't care whether or not you've left me. I don't even care that you've been trying to glean information on my father, in hopes of securing his inheritance. I really can't be bothered to care about such matters, but this doesn't mean that I'm scared of you, or of the Wang clan. You shouldn't have repeatedly antagonized me or my sister, and you certainly shouldn't have brought Qin Xiaotian into this affair, damning you and the entire Wang clan!\"But don't worry, since I didn't kill you before, I'm not going to kill you now. Not only that, I'll even bring you back to the settlement, hale and hearty!\" Zhang Lie's tone was chillingly bright.Even as naive as Wang Xiaohua was, she knew that Zhang Lie surely didn't have good intentions in doing so, but could she refuse? Of course not! She had to hold onto any chance of survival.\"Really? You really won't kill me?\"Instead of replying, Zhang Lie pulled out a curiously large purple flower, then scattered its pollen over her prone body. As a refreshing scent wafted up her nose, Wang Xiaohua felt her paralysis fade.This soulbloom flower was a rare subsidiary ingredient that Zhang Lie had picked up while gathering ingredients for Potion #1. It was the pollen from this flower that had caused the venombane scorpions to ignore Zhang Lie's presence and served as an antidote against the mist formed from their poisonous blood.After storing his spoils, Zhang Lie instructed Wang Xiaohua not to run away after she recovered from her paralysis. Then, he headed back into the glade to harvest the rare herbs that grew within. He wasn't at all worried that Wang Xiaohua would escape, because he knew that she had neither the daring nor the capability.And given that he was planning to return Wang Xiaohua to the settlement, this venombane glade would soon be a well-known location. As a result, he would have to harvest and hunt what he could now.The exoskeleton of these venombane scorpions were particularly useful, and could be used to brew a variety of medicines, potions, and poisons. Mutated-grade venombane-scorpion soulshards was even more useful, so the glade would soon be packed to the brim with hunters.Zhang Lie spent the next three days in the venombane glade.Zhang Lie: a mortal lifeformFramework: Foundation, Lv. MAX, Ninecarp Transformation, First Form: CarpTechniques: Rippling Walk (novice), Three-Wave Crescendo (novice)Genes: Basic, 130; Mutated, 80; Superior, 10Soulshards: White Grub (superior), Galewolf (mutated), Blood Ant (mutated), Potbellied Toad (mutated), Venombane Scorpion (mutated)The reason he had taken so long was both in order to harvest herbs and to hunt for a mutated-grade venombane-scorpion soulshard. It was extremely difficult to find such venombane scorpions while they were stealthed, and if not for Zhang Lie's understanding of their habits and weaknesses, it would have taken even longer.As expected, Wang Xiaohua didn't even try to run away. All she did was bury her teammates' corpses.Back in the Blacksteel settlement, outside the gates, a number of gamblers were glancing all around the landscape, searching for a certain hunter.\"It's been three whole days! Surely Qin Xiaotian and his team would be back by now?\"\"It's only been three days\u2014given Qin Xiaotian's skill, it wouldn't be unusual for his team to be out hunting for an entire month!\"\"That's right! After all, that Zhang Lie surely was nothing more than an interlude for someone like Qin Xiaotian.\"\"Even calling him an interlude is way too much! You couldn't have bet on him, could you?\"\"Of course not! What are the odds now, something like 120:1 against him?\"What the crowd didn't realize was that, amidst their discussions, two stealthed hunters were passing by them and heading into the settlement.Of course, these two hunters were Zhang Lie and Wang Xiaohua.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: You're Free\"Congratulations, Wang Xiaohua, you're free!\" The moment they entered the settlement, Zhang Lie whispered into Wang Xiaohua's ear. Subsequently, she felt the presence by her side vanish: Zhang Lie had disappeared.Wang Xiaohua was shocked. She couldn't believe that Zhang Lie would let her go so easily.\u00a0Why? He hadn't hesitated to kill Qin Xiaotian and the others. Why would he let me go? Could he be interested in rekindling our relationship? Yes, yes, that had to be the case! Otherwise, why would he leave me alive without even extorting me for my points?Zhang Lie's sudden departure left Wang Xiaohua, still stealthed, in deep thought. However, she was being so naive that Zhang Lie would have been in fits of laughter upon hearing her thoughts. Of course, while he didn't care about her thoughts, he had overheard what the crowds were saying outside the settlement.At the betting stand set up by the three major corporations, a mysterious black-clad man came to the counter and said, \"I\u2019m betting thirty thousand points on Zhang Lie\u2019s safe return!\"His remarkable declaration sent ripples through the crowds.\"Thirty thousand points for Zhang Lie?! Is this guy crazy?\"\"Some people clearly have too many points on their hands!\"\"Isn't that so? It's already the third day of the hunt, and there's almost no chance for Zhang Lie by now. What a fool!\"The onlookers' taunts didn't affect the mysterious man at all. He slammed a card down on the counter and called out to the bookkeepers, \"What's the matter? Aren't you going to accept my bet?\"The bookkeeper sitting in front of the counter immediately smiled. \"Of course we'll take the bet! \u00a0Why wouldn't we? The betting only closes at 5 PM, and it's only 3 PM right now!\"The paperwork was handled rapidly, and the mysterious man quickly left after receiving his receipt. Only after he had vanished did the onlookers begin to murmur among themselves again.\"What an idiot! The three corporations got thirty thousand points, just like that!\"\"Isn't that so? Not only that, he's even trying to act like a mysterious fellow with that get-up!\"The crowd soon declared that black-clad man as the stupidest fool in the settlement.Just as the commotion had settled down, a rather handsome hunter stepped forward, gaze still hovering in the direction in which the mysterious man had left. He sauntered up to the counter. \"Ten thousand points to that Zhang Lie fellow.\"These words sparked another discussion among the crowd. Someone even shouted out the hunter's name.\"Isn't that... isn't that Chu Feng?\"\"Chu Feng? Who's Chu Feng?\"\"The second-ranked hunter on the gene leaderboard, who else?!\"\"What's going on? Why would someone like Chu Feng place a bet on Zhang Lie? Could he have received some news?\"Chu Feng's action immediately caused a few hunters to palm their point cards, thinking about whether or not to make the same bet he did.\"Friends, I haven't heard anything of the sort! I'm simply placing this bet on a whim. I don't care if you mimic me, but don't hold me responsible if you lose!\" Chu Feng's explanation caused much of the crowd, eager to continue betting, to shrink back.Chu Feng had the money and points to spare, after all, but they didn't. If other hunters were to mimic his bet, that was a decision they had to make for themselves.The moment Chu Feng left, however, the bookkeepers from the three corporations, who had been smiling after the mysterious black-clad man's departure, suddenly grew stern and began packing up.The gamblers lounging around the stand immediately noticed what was going on.\"What's the matter? Didn't you claim you were going to allow bets until 5 PM? Why are you all packing up now?\"\"That's right, what's going on? This bet's recognized by the artificial intelligence presiding over the Blacksteel settlement, so you won't be able to run away so easily!\"The head bookkeeper strode out from behind the stand and explained politely, \"Don't worry, we're from the three corporations. We certainly won't be running away. As for why we're halting bets so early on, it's simply what our superiors told us. We're just low-level workers, and we don't know what's going on either. I suspect it's simply a matter of risk. There are already tens of millions of points in the betting pool, after all.\"His words and polite attitude barely persuaded the gamblers to let them pass.But before they could leave, a particularly domineering voice came from within the crowd.\"Oh? Who's going to leave before I, Qin Xiao, have made my bet?\" Qin Xiao strode forth in an imposing suit of jet-black armor.With one hand, he pressed down on the table the bookkeepers were trying to pack up, retrieved his point card, and said, loud enough for all to hear, \"I know exactly how capable my cousin is. I'll bet three hundred thousand points that the other dumb bastard who roused his ire won't make it back alive!\"\"Young Master Qin, you\u2014this isn't something I have the authority to handle, so...\"\"Shut your damn mouth! I know exactly how much profit the three corporations have made in this settlement over the past few years. Give me a receipt for this bet, or I won't let you out of the settlement!\"What bookkeeper would refuse the bet now? Their lives were more important, after all, and they were only low-level workers.\"Qin Xiao, you're even bullying these white-collar workers now?\" As Qin Xiao grabbed the receipt he was handed, a clear, flute-like voice rang out from the crowd.\"Yun Bing, the corporations themselves claimed that they'd halt the betting at 5 PM. It's not my fault that they're going back on their word! Why don't you come over and make a bet too? It's all thanks to our Xiaotian that we're getting such an easy way to make more points!\"Faced with Yun Bing, first on the gene leaderboard, Qin Xiao dropped his dominating attitude, but not his boastful tone.His prideful posturing made Yun Bing want to laugh. As she stepped up to the counter, Yun Bing said, \"If I can still make a bet, I'll bet ten thousand points that the fellow facing off against Qin Xiaotian will make it back alive!\"Her words caused the crowd to erupt in commotion. The top player on the gene leaderboard herself had made a bet, and it was even for the underdog! Of course, everyone could tell that she had only done so to go against Qin Xiao, not because she had any hidden information of her own.And given her status as the top hunter of the Blacksteel settlement, despite her polite attitude, the head bookkeeper certainly didn't dare to offend her and quickly handed her a receipt back.\"Haha! Yun Bing, I love stubborn women like you!\" Qin Xiao's boisterous behavior clearly revealed his interest in Yun Bing, but she didn't get upset. Instead, throughout the entire process, she spared him not a single glance.After claiming her receipt, she turned around and vanished like fog on a sunny day.Keep pretending to be all distant, wench. I'll make you regret it sooner or later!\u00a0Yun Bing's insouciance infuriated Qin Xiao, but what could he do about it? Her own strength, her clan's power, and even her team's capabilities all eclipsed his. He might shoot his mouth off from time to time, but he wouldn't offend her needlessly.Similarly, while Yun Bing might ignore him, she wouldn't make a big fuss about the matter.After Yun Bing left, Qin Xiao also quickly disappeared. But their departure didn't mark the end of the betting\u2014many hunters near the top of the leaderboard trickled toward the betting stand, ready to make their bets after the top two hunters had done so.Of course, most of them favored Qin Xiaotian, given what Qin Xiao himself had said. Nevertheless, there were a few gamblers who were willing to take the risk for the minuscule chance of a jackpot.It took another dozen minutes before the bookkeepers were finally able to head out. The curtains to the entire fiasco were about to draw to a close. At that point, there should have been a lull before the final results of the bet were established.However, the gamblers in the crowd were set abuzz not ten minutes later by a piece of momentous news: the female hunter who had spawned this entire conflict, Wang Xiaohua, had returned!Of course, that wasn't the most salient point\u2014more importantly, she had returned alone! Not Qin Xiaotian, not his team, not even Zhang Lie\u2014just Wang Xiaohua!The gamblers immediately swarmed her, wanting to discover the outcome of the bet.However, before most people could reach her, guards sent by the Blacksteel settlement's artificial intelligence appeared to wall her off. By that point, the settlement gates were swarming with people.Only with the appearance of the guards did the gathered hunters calm down. They could fight all they wanted outside the settlement grounds, but within the settlement, the guards could not be overcome.As for Wang Xiaohua, under the protection of the settlement guards, she was given a room at the highest-class inn in the settlement, the Blacksteel inn, whose proprietor was the artificial intelligence itself.Subsequently, the artificial intelligence transmitted a message to the gathered hunters on her behalf: she was beleaguered by the attention and her recent experiences, and she needed some time to herself to process what had happened. At 8 PM, the artificial intelligence would announce the outcome of the bet.It was only then that Wang Xiaohua finally understood what Zhang Lie had in mind for her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: The Show BeginsOh, Wang Xiaohua understood it all now! The reason Zhang Lie had spared her wasn't because he pitied her, but because he was planning to shrug the blame for his murders onto her!Qin Xiaotian and the others had died, but she was still alive, and she would be held responsible. There were only two survivors of the entire ordeal: one was her, and the other was Zhang Lie. Given their past relationship, it was conceivable that others would think that they were working together.But this realization had come too late.Everyone knew that she was still alive, so she had become the prime suspect. In fact, if she were to reveal the truth immediately, the matter might have resolved itself. Unfortunately, Wang Xiaohua was so scared that no one would believe her that she ended up doing nothing, and her inaction was damning.Once things dragged out\u2014once it seemed as though Wang Xiaohua were deliberately hiding her involvement in Qin Xiaotian's disappearance\u2014the entire Wang clan would perish with her.In a regular inn, Zhang Lie, dressed all in black, was happily writing an article:\u00a0What Really Happened at the Venombane Glade.From the perspective of an onlooker, Zhang Lie carefully detailed and twisted the truth of the matter. According to him, Wang Xiaohua and Zhang Lie were acting in cahoots to steal all the soulshards from Qin Xiaotian's team\u2014as well as their lives. Even more maliciously, Zhang Lie was waiting for Wang Xiaohua to speak up and take the first step toward her ruin before revealing his \"truth\".Having prepared the article, Zhang Lie left the Blacksteel settlement again, returning to the venombane glade to set up the scene of the crime.At 8 PM, a huge crowd had gathered outside the Blacksteel Inn. The gamblers who had taken part in the bet were all waiting to discover the outcome of the battle\u2014or the juiciest, freshest gossip.Shockingly, it was a robot who emerged out onto the inn's third-floor balcony, not Wang Xiaohua.\"Miss Wang Xiaohua has requested that I, the artificial intelligence serving the Blacksteel settlement, reveal the final outcome of the bet! The winner\u2014Zhang Lie! Except for Miss Wang Xiaohua, Qin Xiaotian's entire team perished! The outcome of this bet is now official, and those winners can now redeem their receipts for points online.\"For a brief moment, the deep, synthetic voice lulled the entire Blacksteel settlement into silence.A mere fraction of a second later, however, the crowd erupted in shock.How could Qin Xiaotian have lost?! His entire team, too?! How was this possible?\"No, I don't believe this! She has to be lying! How could Qin Xiaotian lose\u2014 and with his entire team, at that?! That's impossible!\"\"That's right, it's impossible! Qin Xiaotian is Qin Xiao's cousin, after all\u2014how could someone like him fail to beat a hunter at the bottom of the gene leaderboard?! Where's Wang Xiaohua? Why hasn't she revealed herself?\"\"Preposterous, I say!\"\"Wang Xiaohua, what really happened? You'd better tell us the truth!\"Clearly, this outcome was unacceptable to a majority of the crowd. After all, at least 90% of the crowd had staked a heavy bet on Qin Xiaotian. They would suffer heavy losses if Qin Xiaotian had actually lost.As for the artificial intelligence, well, it didn't much care for the dismay of the crowd. If the crowd became violent, it would be dispersed, and any troublemakers would be arrested. The artificial intelligence would certainly reveal the impartial truth. And since it claimed that Zhang Lie had won, then Qin Xiaotian had to have been defeated\u2014and killed.Only after realizing that inconvenient truth did the dejected gamblers finally leave. However, just because they had dispersed didn't mean that they would take their loss lying down\u2014no, they had to uncover the truth of the matter.In every bet, there would be winners and losers. Even though Zhang Lie was a dark horse, there would still be some gamblers willing to bet on him. At that moment, they were overjoyed: the odds were 120:1 in their favor! They had earned their points back a hundredfold!Even the strongest hunters like Yun Bing and Chu Feng were pleasantly surprised by their gains. After all, given such odds, a ten-thousand point bet would give them 1.2 million points back. No matter how much wealth they had, 1.2 million points was a considerable amount of points. As a result, both of them gained a deep interest in Zhang Lie, whom they hadn't ever seen in person.Of course, at the same time, Qin Xiao was flying into a blind rage.On the fifth-floor suite in the Blacksteel inn, with a huge boom, the table in front of Qin Xiao exploded into tiny shards.\"Find out exactly where that Wang Xiaohua is! I want to see her immediately!\" Qin Xiao was howling at the door to his room like a ferocious beast.\"Yes, Captain!\" Seeing how enraged their captain was, Qin Xiao's team immediately rushed off to find Wang Xiaohua.The reason that Qin Xiao hadn't approached her initially was because he thought Qin Xiaotian was trying to drum up attention, not that he had lost! How could he have lost?!Xiaotian was dead, and the only survivor was Wang Xiaohua\u2026 He'd bet three hundred thousand points, 90% of his total wealth, and it was all gone now...His subordinates were rather capable hunters in their own right, and they quickly brought back the news that Qin Xiao wanted to hear.Wang Xiaohua was in room 303 of this very inn, and was apparently meeting with the head of the three great corporations at the moment.\"The three corporations\u2014!\" Qin Xiao was so furious that he couldn't sit still.In room 303 of the Blacksteel Inn, three middle-aged men were sitting in the rather small living room. Opposite them, Wang Xiaohua was seated by the corner of a couch, her face pale, surrounded on either side by two guards.She was panicking because she now clearly understood the ramifications of her safe return. As a result, she had even spent her precious points to hire two guards for protection.\"Wang Xiaohua, I think you should understand your predicament quite well. To be frank, you're the only one who can save yourself now! Tell us everything that you saw and heard, starting from the moment you left the settlement gates! Otherwise, I can assure you that both you and your clan will be crushed by morning.\"The head of one corporation was threatening and scaring Wang Xiaohua in order to learn about exactly what had happened. The other two heads were also in rare agreement.No matter the outcome of the bet, the three corporations would still make a tidy profit. The reason they were here to see Wang Xiaohua was because the outcome was too shocking even for them. Furthermore, as merchants, they could sense an opportunity brewing.Wang Xiaohua gulped down some saliva, not knowing where to begin.Ding! Just then, the doorbell rang.\"Zhou Qian, Li Jin, Zhao Jia, open up! Otherwise, I'll kill any team from your corporations the moment I encounter them! I'm Xiaotian's cousin, and I demand to know the truth immediately! Open up!\" Outside room 303, Qin Xiao's booming voice struck the hearts of the hunters inside like a bolt of lightning.If this weren't the Blacksteel Inn, and if there weren't a horde of gamblers unable to accept their loss in the corridor with him, Qin Xiao would have broken down the door with a kick. The three heads eyed each other, and one of them finally turned to a subordinate.As the door opened, the furious Qin Xiao stomped inside. His subordinates stayed outside to guard the door. Qin Xiao eyed the two guards by Wang Xiaohua's side, then dragged a stool over and went to sit by the three heads.\"Wang Xiaohua, you're with my cousin Xiaotian, so I won't make things difficult for you. But you have to explain to me exactly what happened on this trip! How did Qin Xiaotian and his team die\u2014all except for you?! If you don't tell me what happened, I'll have you\u2014and all the rest of the Wang clan\u2014die alongside him!\"Such was Qin Xiao's rage that this outburst was the result of him trying to restrain himself.Wang Xiaohua knew then that she wouldn't be able to keep her experience a secret; in truth, she was waiting for Qin Xiao to arrive. After all, as long as she were able to convince Qin Xiao of the truth, then she would be absolved of any suspicion.After clearing her throat, Wang Xiaohua began, \"We were all set up by Zhang Lie! That day, after leaving the settlement, we chased him all the way to the Moonlit Pond. There, he led us through a tunnel behind the waterfall into an idyllic glade.\"Everything in the glade was tinged purple, and the moment we entered, we found quite a number of rare herbs. However, our joy and happiness were short-lived: we had fallen right into his trap. We were attacked by these so-called venombane scorpions, most of which were regular-grade, but they swarmed us rapidly in huge droves. Worse, they seemed to have a stealth ability and a deadly poison.\"Zhang Lie had previously doused himself in soulbloom pollen, which would allow him to avoid the scorpions. Xiaotian led us into a battle with the scorpions, but after losing half our members, he transformed into a golden pangolin and burrowed a hole through which we could escape.\"However, by that time, we had all fallen prey to the scorpions' slow-acting poison. Our bodies were slowly becoming paralyzed, so Xiaotian brought us deeper into the glade instead, intending for us to recover before heading off.\"But even though Xiaotian used all sorts of antidotes, he wasn't able to cure the paralysis at all. We were discovered by Zhang Lie, who tricked us into handing over our soulshards before killing us all! The only survivor he left was me.\"Qin Xiao, Zhang Lie's a sly and malicious fellow, and he's been pretending to be weak all along. We've all been tricked by him, all of us hunters in the Blacksteel settlement!\"You have to avenge Xiaotian and his team!\"In the end, Wang Xiaohua's words were drowned out by a fit of desolate sobs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: The Trap TightensDespite her cries, none of the four people before her showed any sign of pity\u2014especially Qin Xiao, who immediately questioned, \"Why would he keep you alive, then? Shouldn't this Zhang Lie fellow have killed you too? Why would he leave you alive? Tell me, why?\"Hearing Qin Xiao's accusation, and seeing the skeptical glances from the three corporation heads, Wang Xiaohua clearly sensed matters taking a turn for the worse.\"Qin Xiao, it's easy! He kept me alive so all of you would suspect me, to have me take the blame for his murder!\"\"You, a scapegoat? No matter who this hunter is, everyone in the Blacksteel settlement would know my name. Wouldn't he know that, the moment Xiaotian died, he would be a dead man walking? What a foolish notion\u2014is he a fool, or is he treating us like fools? And if this were the case, where's this Zhang Lie now?\"Qin Xiao was brash and arrogant, and his thoughts reflected that belief. He believed that anyone who had roused his ire within the Blacksteel settlement had no recourse but to wait for him to kill them. Furthermore, he believed that, if Zhang Lie truly were capable of killing Qin Xiaotian, then he wouldn't try to play such an obvious trick on him.Wang Xiaohua was so agitated that she began to cry again. \"Qin Xiao, Zhang Lie left on his own the moment he brought me back to the settlement. I'm sure he's still hiding somewhere!Please, you have to believe me! I swear that I'm telling nothing but the truth. If you don't believe me, you can send your subordinates out to the venombane glade to have a look!\"\"Oh, I will. At the very least, Xiaotian needs a proper burial!\" Recalling how close she was to Qin Xiaotian, Qin Xiao suddenly felt less skeptical about her claims. After all, unless Wang Xiaohua was a fool, she would have no reason to collude with Zhang Lie. He would have to see the scene of the crime for himself.He believed that, as long as he was there, he would easily figure out the truth.\"Qin Xiao, the venombane glade isn't very large, and it's a pretty easy place to find. Could I be allowed to remain here? After reaching the glade, go straight for about one kilometer. There, you'll be able to see the large hole out of which Xiaotian tunneled, and I buried his body inside!\"You'll need to start by finding a soulbloom flower. With its pollen, you can enter the glade. Zhang Lie mentioned that it isn't endemic to the venombane glade, so you shouldn't have a hard time finding one.\"Wang Xiaohua could discern that Qin Xiao didn't completely believe her, so she didn't dare to leave the settlement with him. After all, he was notorious for his bad temper. If there were to be some unforeseen circumstance, she could well lose her life at his hands.Wang Xiaohua looked timidly and pleadingly at Qin Xiao.\"Don't worry, Wang Xiaohua, I won't do anything to you until the truth is clear. Are you sure you don't want to go with me? This is your one chance at proving your innocence!\" Qin Xiao narrowed his eyes, revealing a sudden killing intent.Wang Xiaohua began to sob, \"Please, Qin Xiao, don't force me to go! It's a very easy place to find, and once you find it, you'll surely understand that I'm innocent.\"Qin Xiao leaned closer to Wang Xiaohua, until his eyes were directly facing hers. \"You'd better not let me find out that you were part of this, or your entire clan will die with you.\"He glanced toward her two guardians, glared at her, and then got up to leave. The three corporation heads did the same. In truth, they were now all very relieved that they had come to hear Wang Xiaohua's story.Ignoring the details of Qin Xiaotian's death, they had learned about this mysterious venombane glade, apparently filled with a bounty of riches. The location hadn't yet been developed, which meant an unlimited set of possibilities for turning it into a goldmine!The four men each rushed toward the inn's exit.Right before stepping outside, however, Qin Xiao commanded, \"Listen up, you three. This venombane glade's something that my Xiaotian gave his life for, so don't you think about trying to steal it away!\"The three corporation heads, Zhou Qian, Li Jin, and Zhao Jia, couldn't help letting out a faint mocking smile at his words.Zhou Qian even murmured, \"Qin Xiao, do you really think that you have the capability to do that? Even if all four of us were to work together, we wouldn't be able to monopolize the location. Do you understand what I'm saying?\"He left before Qin Xiao could reply, and the other two corporation leaders shook their heads and followed suit, leaving Qin Xiao standing red-faced in the hotel lobby.It took him a moment's thought to understand what they were saying: given the unusual circumstances, their every movement would be telegraphed and paid attention to. It would be impossible for them to secretly develop the location; the most they could do would be to develop it jointly.He rushed out of the lobby, trailing behind the three corporation heads.By the time Qin Xiao and his team arrived at the Moonlit Pond, those teams sponsored by the three corporations were already present. Not only that, Yun Bing's team and Chu Feng's team were also at the scene.Everyone gathered underneath the waterfall at the Moonlit Pond. Qin Xiao glared at Zhou Qian, Li Jin, and Zhao Jia. However, the three of them each ignored his presence.In truth, they had long since gotten used to Qin Xiao's brash behavior, and his threats meant nothing to them. The three corporations would, in order to avoid trouble, refrain from antagonizing him as much as possible, but if there were sufficient profit to be gained, they really didn't have much to fear from the Qin clan.\"Qin Xiao, aren't you greedy? You want to have everything for yourself! It's not possible for you to develop the location alone, so let's have all six of us enter together!\" Chu Feng was the first to speak up. He spoke in a relaxed fashion, but his eyes showed no intention of giving in if Qin Xiao were to decline.Yun Bing, standing not far away, didn't speak up, but her expression made it apparent that she felt the same way.Damn the three corporations!\u00a0Qin Xiao cursed inwardly. To Chu Feng, he said, \"You all make it sound so trivial, but Xiaotian died for this place! No matter what, my team has to be the first to enter, or none of us will!\"The other five teams all traded glances among themselves.Then, Yun Bing stepped forward. \"Since you clearly want to be cannon fodder, we'll let you head in first.\"She was likely the only hunter in the entire settlement who dared to call Qin Xiao cannon fodder. Against Yun Bing, it was meaningless to talk back.\"Ready the soulbloom pollen! We're heading in!\"With Qin Xiao's loud roar, his subordinates immediately doused themselves with soulbloom pollen and rushed through the waterfall.Just as the elites of the Blacksteel settlement were exploring the venombane glade, however,another shock rumbled through the Blacksteel settlement.A horde of hunters were heading straight for the venombane glade, prompted by an anonymous thread in the Blacksteel settlement's forum.The author of the thread had detailed precisely where this venombane glade was, as well as what he had noticed playing out within the glade.Apparently, while he was hunting near the Moonlit Pond, he noticed the chase between Zhang Lie and Qin Xiaotian's team, and he had trailed them stealthily.According to him, he followed them into an idyllic glade, where he saw Qin Xiaotian fighting against a horde of scorpions. He had hidden up a tree and, later, fell prey to the scorpions' paralytic poison.It was this paralysis that had caused him to witness the truth behind Qin Xiaotian's death\u2014how Zhang Lie and Wang Xiaohua had plotted together to destroy Qin Xiaotian and the rest of his team.By luring them within the glade, Zhang Lie induced the scorpions to attack Qin Xiaotian's team, sapping them of strength and energy. Then, with Wang Xiaohua's help, he tricked Qin Xiaotian's team into giving up their soulshards.Finally, the two of them split their ill-gotten spoils and planned out how to dodge responsibility for the deaths of Qin Xiaotian and his team.The thread vilified both Zhang Lie and Wang Xiaohua, and immediately caused the penniless gamblers, who had staked everything on Qin Xiaotian, and who hadn't believed that Zhang Lie had been able to kill them all with his own strength, to go berserk.No wonder Qin Xiaotian had lost despite his overwhelming numerical and genetic advantage!The Blacksteel Inn, in which Wang Xiaohua was residing, was quickly swarmed with all sorts of hunters, but even this wasn't the end of the story.The other \"culprit\", Zhang Lie, had himself made a thread on the forum!According to Zhang Lie, Wang Xiaohua had been an untrustworthy ally. Not only had she not given him his fair share of soulshards, she had even shrugged off all the blame for the entire affair!He promised that he had no intention of killing Qin Xiaotian; he had only wanted to live, and Wang Xiaohua was the one who had plotted the murder.The anonymous thread agreed with Zhang Lie's self-indictment, and Wang Xiaohua's traitorous behavior had been all but confirmed in a few short minutes.Subsequently, someone noticed that Qin Xiaotian's golden-pangolin soulshard had been listed on the trading post by an anonymous seller.Furthermore, even his subordinates' soulshards had appeared as well. All these soulshards were listed anonymously and slated to be auctioned off.The entire settlement was in an uproar.At this point, Wang Xiaohua realized that Zhang Lie was trying to shift the blame onto her, and she immediately made her own thread to clear her name.But given her naivete, how could she beat Zhang Lie in a verbal battle? Her name became smeared in a matter of minutes, and descriptions of what she did grew darker and bleaker.In the end, Wang Xiaohua could only focus on one key point: the location of Qin Xiaotian and his team's corpses in the venombane glade. Afterwards, she stayed cooped up in her room in the Blacksteel Inn, not daring to leave, or even to post on the forum.But even so, Wang Xiaohua's name had become irrevocably tarnished.After all, Zhang Lie was allegedly just trying to live. On the other hand, Wang Xiaohua had been the one clamoring for the death of Qin Xiaotian and his team.Someone like her, even in the ruthless dimensional world, would be scorned and despised.Worst of all, what Wang Xiaohua didn't know was that the key evidence she was counting on\u2014the location of Qin Xiaotian's corpse\u2014would be what eventually doomed her and her clan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: Superior-Grade LifeformThe moonlit night submerged the entire venombane glade in an aura of mystery.However, this mysterious glade was now packed to the brim with hunters. The Yun, Chu, Qin, Zhou, Li, and Zhao clans had poured all their elites into this expedition, brightening the glade with hundreds of lanterns and conjured flames.Their bodies were all covered in a generous quantity of soulbloom pollen, so despite all the commotion, they weren't attacked by the venombane scorpions.As the elites of the Blacksteel settlement, they had noticed the stealthed venombane scorpions surrounding them almost instantaneously. On the rock walls, in the earth\u2014these venombane scorpions seemed to be omnipresent within the glade.The cave tunnel that they had passed through seemed to be their lair. However, because of the soulbloom pollen, the scorpions ignored them all. As a result, before the hunters attacked the scorpions, the scorpions wouldn't attack them of their own accord.Although they had learned a little about the area from Wang Xiaohua, they forged on cautiously. Even Qin Xiao, brash and boisterous, had become extremely careful upon exploring the glade. Nighttime in the dimensional world was filled with danger; as an experienced hunter, Qin Xiao certainly wouldn't let his guard down.After passing into the venombane glade, the hunters found that the glade really wasn't all that large, and there were only a very limited quantity of valuable herbs. Even after exploring the entire glade, no one discovered any other lifeforms. Although the glade was filled with spiritual herbs, they were all relatively common varieties, and most had clearly been harvested already.The gathered hunters clearly didn't think much of the remaining herbs. In that case, the most valuable objects they could hope to find in the glade would be a mutated- or superior-grade venombane-scorpion soulshard.The fight that had taken place had left a fair bit of evidence that the hunters were able to make out. Although there were only a few marks left on the ground by the tunnel exit, it was clear that a fight had taken place.Qin Xiao stopped by a gigantic mound of earth, frowning. According to Wang Xiaohua, this was where Qin Xiaotian had been buried. Qin Xiaotian had revered his older cousin Qin Xiao, and Qin Xiao had regarded his cousin highly as well. How could he have died so suddenly?\"My condolences, Qin Xiao,\" Zhou Qian spoke up, his face a blank mask.Li Jin and Zhao Jia echoed the sentiment, but their words seemed insincere, as though steeped in vicious schadenfreude.Chu Feng clucked his tongue. How pitiful, for someone like Qin Xiaotian to be buried here!\"Qin Xiao, I told you your cousin was a weakling, didn't I? You didn't believe me, and according to Yun Bing, you bet three hundred thousand points on him? Surely even you can't afford to squander your wealth like that! I suppose you'll want to retrieve his corpse and bring it back to Earth? We'll leave you to it, then.\"Chu Feng's words turned Qin Xiao's face an angry purple.Qin Xiao was the most arrogant hunter of the top three hunters on the gene leaderboard, and that attitude was something he had embraced on a day-to-day basis. Even if Yun Bing and Chu Feng were slightly stronger than he was, he had never feared either of them.When had the arrogant Qin Xiao suffered such humiliation? He didn't even know how to repudiate Chu Feng's words! After all, Chu Feng was right\u2014no matter how much he didn't want to admit it.As a scion of the Qin clan, Qin Xiaotian, whose mutated gene fragments were at capacity, and who had brought his entire team with him\u2014how could he have lost to someone like Zhang Lie, well known to be at the bottom of the gene leaderboard?\u00a0How shameful! How abominably shameful!It was a rare opportunity for Chu Feng to gibe at his old rival. Leaving Qin Xiao to grieve, he signalled his elites to head toward the cave entrance.As Chu Feng left, Yun Bing followed suit. She wasn't on good terms with Qin Xiao, either. \"Qin Xiao, what Chu Feng said was harsh, but not unreasonable. Take your cousin's corpse and give him a burial back on Earth.\"She turned to leave with her team.The three corporation heads, Zhou, Li, and Zhao, naturally couldn't stand still after seeing both Chu Feng and Yun Bing going into the distance. They glanced at each other, waved a hasty goodbye to Qin Xiao, and hurried to the cave.After having explored the glade, they now knew what was most valuable inside. It was very late at night, and the gathered hunters intended to finish their work quickly before heading back to the settlement.As he glanced at the mound by his feet, as well as the disappearing hunters from the other five clans, Qin Xiao began to smile. \"Qin Feng, stay here with a few hunters and dig out Xiaotian's corpse. Everyone else, head to the entrance with me. Xiaotian's lost us a lot of money and face, and we'll have to hunt down whatever superior-grade lifeforms are around here to make up for the loss.\"The procession of hunters headed to the entrance to the tunnel and began slaughtering the venombane scorpions in earnest.Yes, a slaughter. After all, the hunters present were the elites of the Blacksteel settlement, and even the weakest among them had capped out his mutated gene capacity and possessed at least a dozen superior gene fragments.The venombane scorpions had no effective means of attacking them with anything but their poison. Although they swarmed the hunters, just as they did with Qin Xiaotian's team, they weren't able to harm the hunters at all.The hunters' genetic techniques slaughtered horde after horde of scorpions. Such endless slaughter would quickly generate soulshards, regardless of how rare they otherwise were.As Yun Bing lightly waved her blade, wreathed in a curious white mist, a stealthed mutated-grade venombane scorpion was split in half. A thumb-sized purplish-black soulshard began to form over the scorpion's carcass.A mutated-grade soulshard! Yun Bing's face lit up. After so much effort, she'd finally obtained one.The next moment, as she quickly absorbed it into her soulspace and activated it, her body turned translucent, then transparent. Chu Feng and the others immediately noticed the transformation.Such a useful soulshard made the gathered hunters quite envious. They earnestly slaughtered the scorpions skittering toward them, hoping for that rare treasure.\"Argh!\" As more and more soulshards began to drop and the hunters were becoming complacent given their accumulated spoils, a hunter suddenly cried out in pain.The shout had emanated from a member of the Chu clan. Some attack had drilled a hole through the unlucky hunter's forehead, and he slumped to the ground amidst a flurry of commotion.\"Be careful, there's a superior-grade lifeform around, a superior-grade venombane scorpion!\" a hunter to his side shouted, having seen something flash by.Chu Feng's eyes brightened. \"Quick, surround it!\"A superior-grade lifeform! To think that a superior-grade venombane scorpion was in their midst!After all, Chu Feng and the others had long since maxed out their mutated gene capacity, and the only reason they were still here, without having advanced to the second realm of the dimensional world, was because they were waiting to fill their superior gene capacity as well.And although superior-grade lifeforms were prevalent in the dimensional world, they were quite rare within hundreds of kilometers from the Blacksteel settlement.Furthermore, killing just one superior-grade lifeform and consuming its flesh would usually only provide between one to ten superior gene fragments.To reach the limit of a hundred superior gene fragments would require a dozen or more such lifeforms, each of a different type. Given how dangerous it was to go too far beyond the settlement, the difficulty of filling their superior gene capacity was obvious.How could Chu Feng not be excited to encounter a superior-grade lifeform while surrounded by his elites? With a burst of wind, he immediately appeared before his fallen subordinate.At the same time, his elites had begun blockading the area. Four walls of wind, like heavy curtains, separated the Chu team from the outside world.Within the enclosed space, several hunters whose framework was geared toward detection began spreading out and searching for the superior-grade lifeform.\"It's there! Ah, it's moving so quickly!\" By the southeastern corner of the enclosure, the orb of water that a youth was holding up suddenly began to ripple. The moment he spoke, several beams of genetic energy shot toward where he was pointing.The revealed crystalline scorpion jumped up, evaded all the attacks, and vanished out of sight once more.\"[The Whispering Wind]!\" Amidst the commotion, Chu Feng closed his eyes, stilled his body, and began emanating waves of genetic energy, rippling as they interacted with the solid objects around him.\"I've found you!\" Moments later, his eyes shot open, and he struck toward the eastern wind wall.His sword, glowing blue, traced out an electric arc as he struck at the skittering scorpion, only to have his attack blocked by its stinger with a resounding metallic clash. Immediately after countering the blow, the scorpion vanished from sight again.Superior-grade lifeforms possessed a significant level of intelligence, and the venombane scorpion behaved much like a skilled assassin. If its blow were to miss, it would immediately hide in stealth. Under normal circumstances, it certainly wouldn't fight head-on with its target.However, Chu Feng wasn't such an easy opponent to mislead. Wreaths of wind surrounded him, and it seemed as though he could sense the currents of movement all around.Despite how quickly the superior-grade scorpion moved, Chu Feng seemed to be able to predict its location and strike with his blade. However, all his attacks were either blocked or knocked aside by the tip of the scorpion's stinger.Although Chu Feng was unable to hurt the scorpion, he had managed to trap it.At this point, the other hunters in the cave had all reacted to what was going on. Chu Feng's team immediately joined in the fight, trying to corral the scorpion so that Chu Feng could land the finishing blow.However, just as Chu Feng's team was doing so, outside the walls of wind, the red-eyed Qin Xiao was stalking toward the scorpion as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: Violent Confrontation\"[Thunder God's Wrath]!\"With a yell, Qin Xiao's polearm blazed with lightning, frying countless scorpions ahead of him.During the slaughter, because Qin Xiao had been the last to reach the cave entrance, all the best positions had been taken, and his luck was unusually bad. He had only killed a few mutated-grade venombane scorpions, let alone a superior-grade one, and had only managed to obtain a few regular-grade soulshards. As a result, when he saw this superior-grade scorpion, he hurried over with his team.Of course, he didn't attack yet.In the dimensional world, it was the hunter or team who scored the last hit on a lifeform that would be rewarded with its spoils\u2014its flesh, with its associated gene fragments, and its soulshard, if one were to condense.Superior-grade lifeforms, as the strongest grade of lifeforms in the first realm of the dimensional world, possessed significant vitality and constitution, and wouldn't be so easily killed.Qin Xiao was waiting for this superior-grade scorpion to enter its death throes.\"Chu Lan, watch Qin Xiao carefully for me. If he gets within twenty meters, attack him!\" Of course, as his old rival, Chu Feng knew what Qin Xiao was thinking. Almost as soon as Qin Xiao began moving closer, he murmured a few words to a female hunter by his side.\"Yes, Chu Feng!\" She, along with two of her subordinates, stopped chasing after the superior-grade scorpion and went to waylay Qin Feng instead.In truth, Chu Feng was hiding his true power as well. He displayed neither his best techniques nor his most useful soulshards.The Void Cup, hosted once every five years, was right about to occur, and it made sense to hide as much of his strength as he could.Furthermore, he knew quite well that Qin Xiao wasn't the only one eyeing this superior-grade lifeform. Yun Bing's team, as well as those of the three corporation heads, had all drawn closer.He certainly didn't want to waste his efforts in vain. As he commanded his subordinates to increase the thickness of the wind walls, he activated an illusion-type soulshard to hide what was happening in the enclosed area from the outside. Then, he began whittling down the scorpion's health with only his [Hurricane Blade] and [The Whispering Wind].The curious sight caused a certain hunter, watching from a fair distance away, to begin smirking. He was clad in black, hooded, and stealthed, and it was impossible to make out his features. As the fight continued within the rock cave, the black-clad man scattered an acid-green powder into the waterfall.Clearly, he was hoping to cause a commotion.Chu Feng was still patiently fighting the scorpion, but his opponent was getting much more fed up.Clang! His blade again struck the superior-grade scorpion's stinger, and its fury was palpable. Indeed, the venombane scorpion was completely enraged\u2014it had been trapped within this enclosed region and persistently attacked by an annoying foe.Suddenly, it expelled a haze of poisonous mist and made its move.A violet flash suddenly blazed by Chu Feng's nose, causing his back to erupt in cold sweat.What was that? It was way too fast! So fast that he had caught only the barest hint of motion, so fast that he, despite all his gene fragments, couldn't respond in time!Chu Feng hadn't even been able to see the mechanism behind the scorpion's attack by the time the violet flash reached his eyes. The only reason he was able to avoid it was because of his body's instinctive response. However, just because he could do so didn't mean his subordinates could.One of them, struck by the violet flash, had his head suddenly rot and fall off his neck, his skull turning to powder as it struck the ground. The entire process had happened within three seconds, and no blood or brain matter was visible anywhere. His head had simply decayed away, and his skull had crumbled away to a fine powder.What horrifying poison!Even worse, the violet beam didn't lose any momentum. It shot forward into the hunters behind him, and all those who were struck by the beam immediately began to decay. The area enclosed by the wind walls was now furnished by a carpet of ash.\"That must be [Netherworld's Gaze]!\" the black-clad man murmured to himself, stiffening as he saw the sight.[Netherworld's Gaze] was a lethal skill that consumed much of the venombane scorpion's poison and vitality.In exchange, the terrifying attack would cause instantaneous decay in everything in hit, and was particularly deadly against living matter. Even a hunter who had a hundred superior gene fragments wouldn't be able to take the blow head-on.\"[Wings of Wind]!\" Since he was in mortal danger, Chu Feng couldn't risk hiding his best skills any longer. As he dodged the violet light, genetic energy poured out of his body.A pair of wind-green wings unfurled from his back. With another soulshard activation, a long, thin blade, almost like a rapier, appeared in his left palm. [Wings of Wind], Nature's Thorn, Chu Feng's signature move and sword, finally made their appearance.\"[Tempest Cut]!\" Jade-green sword energy arced toward the scorpion with the fury of a tempest.As it hit the scorpion's stinger, a small piece of exoskeleton, about the size of a fingernail, chipped off the scorpion.With Nature's Thorn in his left hand, and a long blade in his right, Chu Feng seemed to have morphed into a howling tempest himself. While it defended against his attack, he rushed toward the scorpion, swinging his blades.Amidst the whirlwind of attacks, the venombane scorpion let out a small cry, had a few more pieces of its exoskeleton chipped off, and again went back into stealth. Chu Feng chased after the scorpion, but the moment right before it vanished, the scorpion shot out another [Netherworld's Gaze].\"Be careful!\" After seeing how horrifying the effects of the skill were, Chu Feng naturally had to swerve to dodge the attack. As he called out a warning, he flapped his wings, barely avoiding the ray.With Chu Feng's advance warning, none of his subordinates fell prey to it this time around. However, one of the wind walls had vanished entirely after being struck by the attack. Seeing the enclosure break apart, Qin Xiao's body crackled with lightning. With a yell, he streaked toward the scorpion like a bolt of lightning.\"Halt them!\" Chu Lan shouted, seeing Qin Xiao and his team approach.Amidst the clash of genetic energy and steel, the Qin and Chu hunters began to face off with each other. The Zhou, Li, and Zhao teams also rushed into the enclosure, turning the battlefield into a mess.As everyone was distracted by the fighting, a translucent cloud of mist wafted over the battlefield and through the wind walls.Within the enclosure, the superior-grade venombane scorpion had gone berserk, shooting off [Netherworld's Gaze] indiscriminately with a wave of its stinger. Like a web, the death rays criss-crossed the enclosure, killing yet another half-dozen elites from the Chu clan.Then, the venombane scorpion went back into stealth.Chu Feng began to frown. This superior-grade venombane scorpion was the smallest of all the superior-grade creatures he had fought. Coupled with its stealth ability, it was more than able to match Chu Feng's wind-attuned speed.Even he was having a hard time dealing with the scorpion. It was difficult to catch, and lethal when it struck!Suddenly, he noticed the mist drifting into the enclosure.\"Yun Bing, you came!\" Chu Feng didn't even cast her a look as he continued chasing after the scorpion, as if he had long since guessed that Yun Bing would have been the first hunter in.Yun Bing smiled as she morphed back into a human. \"It looks like you need some help.\"\"Help? Shall we call it cooperation instead?\" Chu Feng smiled, seeming to have come to the same conclusion.\"Cooperation? How do you want to split the spoils?\" she asked.\"We won't try to hinder each other. Whoever defeats the scorpion takes it all.\"\"Deal!\" Yun Bing nodded, returned to mist, and rushed toward the battlefield.At the same time, Chu Lan, who had been eyeing Qin Xiao throughout the fight, successfully managed to stop him from approaching the scorpion. However, she was incapable of stopping the three corporations' teams from heading in while she blocked Qin Xiao.\"[Cloudmire]!\" On the battlefield, Yun Bing waved her blade, expelling the mists around her. The fleeing superior-grade scorpion suddenly stiffened as the mists surrounded it instead.The mists seemed to make the air denser, preventing the scorpion from skittering as quickly as before. Moreover, despite their evanescent appearance, the scorpion couldn't seem to cut its way out of the mists.\"[Tempest Slash]!\" Chu Feng certainly wouldn't give up such an opportunity; almost immediately as the scorpion became entrapped, he crossed his two blades and swung both at the scorpion, sending a cross-shaped slash of wind toward it. At the same time, he swooped down on it with a flap of his wings.Suddenly, two mutated-grade scorpions appeared out of nowhere and took the vicious blow, exploding into pieces as they did so.The superior-grade venombane scorpion let out another desperate cry, and a dozen mutated-grade scorpions, like loyal soldiers, rushed out from the depths of the cave and began harassing Chu Feng.\"Scram!\" In anger, Chu Feng swung his swords again, killing the mutated-grade scorpions before rushing toward the superior-grade one.\"[Thundercloud Strike]!\" But before he could advance, a sword wreathed in mists had stabbed the superior-grade scorpion's body. With a distinct crack, a burst of dark violet blood shot out of the scorpion's body, and it vanished from sight.This time, it had vanished for good, and even Chu Feng's [The Whispering Wind] couldn't sense its position.Just then, the teams led by the three corporation heads had smashed the remaining wind walls apart. Together with Qin Xiao, they rushed toward the heart of the battlefield.All six clans were together again, but their gathering was hardly as peaceable as before. The teams of hunters, their swords raised, billowing clouds of genetic energy swirling around them, were trapped in a stalemate.By the waterfall, the black-clad man's smile deepened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Catch Me If You CanOf course, this mysterious man in black was Zhang Lie.In truth, even Zhang Lie hadn't expected that the six clans would have been so interested in the venombane glade or the superior-grade venombane scorpion. Neither had he expected that their confrontation would be so hostile.From his perspective, however, any commotion was a good thing. Only when the gathered hunters stumbled over each other would he have the opportunity to steal the kill. If they had united or reached an agreement among themselves, Zhang Lie would have left immediately.The six most important clans in the Blacksteel settlement had all gathered at the glade. Compared to them, the Zhang Lie of the present was nothing.Just exposing himself\u2014let alone attempting to steal the superior-grade scorpion's gene fragments and soulshard\u2014could land him in big trouble. But no reward came without risk. Superior gene fragments and the superior-grade venombane-scorpion soulshard were both excellent spoils.And since Zhang Lie had the opportunity to obtain both, he wouldn't give up so easily. He kept scattering more of his acid-green powder into the waterfall, until the surface of the pond began to froth violently. Then, he snuck toward the cave like a dark shadow.By this time, the battlefield had been divided into two factions. The first comprised the Yun and Chu elites, and the second the Qin, Zhou, Li, and Zhao elites.The two factions guarded against each other as they hunted for the superior-grade scorpion. The abilities that it had demonstrated were far too enticing to give up. No hunter present failed to grasp the worth of its soulshard.A tremendous stealth ability, an exceedingly dangerous beam attack, and lightning speed. No matter whether the soulshard ended up being attack-type, augmentation-type, or illusion-type, the hunter who claimed that soulshard would receive a significant boost.After all, once hunters had filled up all their genes to capacity, what would differentiate them would be the quality and quantity of their soulshards.Furthermore, the gathered crowd of hunters still needed more superior gene fragments: the stronger a hunter was before ascending to a higher realm, the more the hunter would benefit from the ascension.As a result, they all wanted the superior-grade scorpion for themselves.Suddenly, a drop of dark purple blood dripped down from the ceiling. The sound should have been easily drowned out by the hunters, but it seemed almost as loud as a cymbal amidst the tense atmosphere.A purple dot flashed past a Qin elite.\"It's here!\" Almost immediately as he spoke, a whip of thunder crashed down beside him.A violent purple light erupted as it struck the scorpion's carapace, blinding the hunters. When they blinked, the scorpion had vanished once again.Of course, the hunter who had struck, with such speed and strength, was none other than Qin Xiao. When he saw the scorpion try to run away even after being struck by his whip of lightning, an electrifying storm of genetic energy swirled around him.\"[Thunder God's Domain]!\" Blue lightning shot out of Qin Xiao's body in a hundred-meter radius around him. They were as fine and dense as silken threads, illuminating everything in sight.The moment the technique activated, Qin Xiao shot toward the southwest. There, he had seen the outline of a violet scorpion skittering away!\"Attack!\" Just as Qin Xiao thought himself about to defeat the elusive prey, a shout shocked the gathered hunters into action.Propelled by a torrent of wind, an impenetrable cloud of mist was descending on him.\"[Raiment of Lightning]! Chu Feng, you bastard! [Thunderburst]!\"\"[Hymn of Wind]!\"As the wind- and lightning-attuned genetic energy clashed with each other, a cloud of billowing dust smothered the cave. The hunters from each clan began to fight with each other amidst the hordes of scorpions.As Qin Xiao took on Chu Feng, gold, red, and black flashes emerged from within the cloudy mist. Yun Bing was being stalled by the combined might of the three corporations. Not only were Zhou Qian, Li Jin, and Zhao Jia the heads of the three corporations, they were also the top ten hunters in the Blacksteel settlement. The three of them, working together, could certainly counter Yun Bing.As the six clans began to fight among each other, the superior-grade scorpion avoided death once again. Threatened, it no longer dared to remain in the heart of the battlefield, and it shot toward the empty cave tunnel like a beam of purple light.As it chittered, the tunnel began to fill with a horde of regular- and mutated-grade scorpions, ready to defend its leader.\"Stop fighting! It's going to get away! Chase after it!\"The six clans immediately halted their fight and rushed toward the cave entrance.However, just as the six clans began to act, the superior-grade scorpion that had just rushed into the cave let out a despairing cry. It had been trapped within a white, sticky, translucent ball of some strange matter.As he crushed a mutated-grade venombane-scorpion soulshard, Zhang Lie struck the scorpion with [Three-Wave Crescendo], successfully killing the battered superior-grade scorpion. A royal-purple soulshard condensed on its carapace, and Zhang Lie heard the will of the world once more.[You successfully killed a superior-grade venombane scorpion and obtained its soulshard.]Zhang Lie: a mortal lifeformFramework: Foundation, Lv. MAX, Ninecarp Transformation, First Form: CarpGenes: Basic, 140; Mutated, 90, Superior, 10Soulshards: White Grub (superior), Galewolf (mutated), Blood Ant (mutated), Potbellied Toad (mutated), Venombane Scorpion (superior)\"Success!\"In the dark cave, as he heard the will of the world's voice, Zhang Lie's heart began to palpitate. He grabbed the scorpion's carcass, stuffed it into his potbellied-toad pouch, and began to flee. He certainly wasn't about to stay and wait for the six most influential clans of the Blacksteel settlement to catch him!A kill-stealer! The leaders of the Yun, Chu, Qin, Zhou, Li, and Zhao teams were all dumbstruck by what had happened.The moment the superior-grade scorpion had rushed to the cave entrance, a burst of genetic energy had emanated from the cave.And with that burst went the life of the superior-grade scorpion.How could they fail to understand what had happened?Honestly, if others were to know about what had happened here, all six clans would immediately become laughingstocks. They had gathered together to hunt rare prey, and despite their strength, that prey had ultimately been captured by a lone hunter\u2026 Their reputation would be in shambles!No, they had to catch that thief and retrieve the soulshard he had stolen!It was this galvanizing force that caused the six clans to miraculously cooperate. Their leaders immediately stopped fighting and shot toward the fleeing thief.Chu Feng, his wings flapping behind him, flew over the scorpion hordes and into the cave like an eagle darting after its prey. The cave was exceptionally dark, and Zhang Lie was clad entirely in black. Chu Feng couldn't even see the barest silhouette of his body, but he could hear his footsteps.They were both moving extremely quickly, but Chu Feng had more superior gene fragments and higher-quality techniques than Zhang Lie, so he was naturally faster.The distance between the two hunters was quickly decreasing. The waterfall was right ahead of them, but Chu Feng was accelerating faster and faster.Twenty meters... ten... five...! Zhang Lie barely made it out of the cave, despite the howling wind behind him, and tossed a deep blue bead into the waterfall as he did so.\"Release!\" The bead burst apart as soon as it touched the water, freezing the waterfall and blocking the exit to the cave.Moments later, the frozen waterfall exploded. Chu Feng rushed out of the waterfall, waving shards of ice out of his hair, but there was no one in sight.Despite the deaths of many of his elites, the superior-grade scorpion that he was hunting had been stolen by someone else! How could Chu Feng give up the chase so easily?He soared up into the night sky. Peering carefully below him, he dashed toward the barest hint of movement: a tremble of a tree branch. As he did so, flying above the Moonlit Pond, a sudden fear enveloped him.Beneath him, the Moonlit Pond started to froth, as though a lifeform was about to emerge from its depths.Recalling the legend of the Moonlit Pond, Chu Feng widened his eyes as he instinctively flung himself to one side. Blood spurted from his arm as a thin beam of water shot out from the pond, skirted by Chu Feng's left arm, and left a deep scar in the mountain behind him.The next moment, under Chu Feng's disbelieving gaze, a pure-white wyrm emerged from the pond. Its scales gleamed like white jade, and a small horn protruded from its forehead. It seemed like a cross between a dragon and a snake, with a grace inherent to neither species.This\u2014this was the legendary moonlight wyrm!Chu Feng reared back in shock.The moonlight wyrm was a creature of rumor and myth, so named by a hunter from the Blacksteel settlement. Even the reincarnated Zhang Lie had no idea what manner of lifeform it really was.However, none of that was important. All Zhang Lie needed to know was how to lure it out from the depths of the pond, as well as how strong it was.By the waterfall, Yun Bing and Qin Xiao had just rushed out of the cave. They both sucked in a deep breath as they saw the wyrm emerging from the water. The genetic energy swirling around the wyrm was enough to shock them to stillness\u2014especially Qin Xiao, who had once attempted to lure the creature out from the pond.Glancing at it now, he was thankful he didn't do so, or he would have undoubtedly perished for his stupidity.We have to flee!\u00a0The same thought filled the heads of the three top hunters of the Blacksteel settlement. Their desire to catch the fleeing thief had been dashed completely upon seeing the wyrm's head peeking out of the pond's surface.They immediately rushed back into the cave. However, right as they were about to head in, Zhou Qian rushed out, blocking their path forward with the rest of his team. \"What's the matter? Why aren't you chasing the thief?\"\"...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: RighteousnessAnother arrow of water shot out of the pond with deceptively little sound. It moved so quickly that the gathered hunters had barely seen the skill activate before it reached them. The concentrated beam emanated such potent ice-attuned genetic energy that they recoiled in fear, and even Zhou Qian went silent.After all, they were all in the top ten of the gene leaderboard, and their senses were developed enough to understand the potency of the attack. Zhou Qian now knew the reason for Chu Feng, Qin Xiao, and Yun Bing's sudden retreat.However, just because the hunters realized what was happening didn't mean that they were able to react in time. After all, the beam was so sudden that Zhou Qian was still thinking about how to give chase to the mysterious thief.Chu Feng and Yun Bing only hesitated momentarily before pushing him aside and rushing through the cave. As for Qin Xiao, instead of pushing him aside, he pushed him\u00a0out.By the time Zhou Qian figured out what was going on, the orb of water was right before his eyes.\"[Shield of Gold], [Gate to Oblivion], [Adamantine Armor]!\" With barely any hesitation, three defensive skills activated before him. But despite the triple-layered shield, Zhou Qian's body burst into a bloody mist.The orb of water, about as wide as a thumb, emerged from the mist and shot into the tunnel.\"Help me, or we'll all perish!\" Qin Xiao yelled. \"[Lightning Spear]!\"\"[Blade of the Mists]!\"\"[Reaping Wind]!\"Yun Bing and Chu Feng had both begun to turn back by the time he shouted, and they all struck the orb with their fastest attacks. The best offense was also the best defense. They all saw what had happened to Zhou Qian, and none of them wanted to end up like him.With a gigantic tremor, the cave\u2014and even the entire mountain\u2014began to collapse under the combined force of the water orb and the three elemental attacks. Yun Bing, Chu Feng, Qin Xiao, and even Li Jin and Zhao Jia, who had just rushed into the cave, were all buried in the aftermath.\"...\" From within the forest, Zhang Lie couldn't help shaking his head in amazement as he fled.It seemed as though this supposed moonlight wyrm was the strongest and most mysterious existence in the first realm, apart from the disaster-grade lifeform that would soon somehow make its way to the first realm.Based on Zhang Lie's judgment, this moonlight wyrm had likely broken past the limits of a superior-grade lifeform and had advanced to a peak-grade lifeform. How shocking that the will of the world hadn't forced it to ascend! It looked as though he would have to add it to his list of future targets. As he rushed back to the settlement, he made a few changes to his upcoming plans.Back in the pond, after the mountain's collapse, the wyrm ignored the fleeing ant-like existences that were now buried under tons of rock. It surveyed the boundary of the pond, sneezed in annoyance, and dove back into the depths amidst a chain of bubbles.After the wyrm left the scene, all sorts of cries began to emerge from the rock heap. As their subordinates watched on in shock, a massive rumble accompanied a sudden rockslide, and five battered silhouettes emerged from the rocks: Yun Bing, Chu Feng, Qin Xiao, Li Jin, and Zhao Jia.\"Master!\"\"Mistress!\"\"Head!\"As they emerged, their subordinates hurriedly rushed toward them. It was only close up that they saw just how battered the five of them were\u2014especially Qin Xiao, covered in blood from head to toe, his left arm all but smashed to pieces.He stumbled, as though he would be unable to support his own weight and fall at any moment, causing his subordinates to gape in shock. Even Yun Bing and Chu Feng were bleeding from their mouths, as though they too had suffered grievous injuries.Despite not knowing what had happened, their subordinates immediately swarmed and protected them. The Zhou hunters, concerned about the disappearance of their leader, hurriedly crowded Li Jin and Zhao Jia's parties, asking for the whereabouts of Zhou Qian.Unfortunately, neither Li Jin nor Zhao Jia knew what was going on. They had just rushed into the cave when it exploded, and they had been buried alive with the others without knowing why or how.\"Qin Xiao, what happened back there? Where's Zhou Qian?\"Given their temporary alliance, the first person Li Jin asked about the situation was Qin Xiao.Qin Xiao's body trembled. After a momentary silence, he pointed toward Chu Feng and Yun Bing. \"He's dead, the Zhou corporation head is dead! All because of them...!\"\"Qin Xiao, don't you dare malign me!\" Qin Xiao's intentions were clear, and Chu Feng wasn't about to take the blame for Zhou Qian's death.\"Chu Feng, it was all your fault! You and Yun Bing pushed the Zhou clan head out of the tunnel, and he died from the moonlight wyrm's attack!\" Qin Xiao's features had settled into a righteous rage as he pointed a finger at Chu Feng.Even a dozen Chu Fengs and Yun Bings would be no opponent for Qin Xiao's shamelessness. Not only had he tried to shift the blame, he had done so with such conviction!Yun Bing gaped as Chu Feng began to summon his last reserves of genetic energy. \"You're the one who pushed him out! If you're going to keep twisting the truth, I'll kill you now!\"\"Haha, Chu Feng, now that I've exposed the truth, you're trying to kill me? Li Jin, Zhao Jia, we were all attacked by a particularly dangerous lifeform in the tunnel, and these two pushed Zhou Qian out to cushion the attack and save their lives!\"I, Qin Xiao, gave my arm to save him, to no avail! What a tragedy it is that Zhou Qian's corpse was completely destroyed by the attack! If not for my life-threatening injuries, I'd duel scum like you to the death right now!\"\"...you were the one who pushed him out to save your sorry life!\" Chu Feng was astounded at Qin Xiao's thick-skinned behavior. But before Chu Feng could argue with him, Qin Xiao suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood and 'fainted'.\"Qin Xiao, you damn bastard, I know you're faking it!\" Chu Feng's mouth twitched as he howled at his old rival. He tried to be gentlemanly in all things, and it was a testament to Qin Xiao's behavior that Qin Xiao had managed to enrage him to such an extent.On the other hand, by his side, Yun Bing quickly recovered from her initial bout of shock.Qin Xiao's description of events had Li Jin, Zhao Jia, and the rest of the Zhou hunters looking toward Chu Feng and Yun Bing.Li Jin frowned and asked, \"Yun Bing, Chu Feng, don't you think you owe us an explanation for what happened tonight?\"Chu Feng was about to pull his hair out when Yun Bing, who had been silent, spoke up.\"Li Jin, Zhao Jia, as corporation heads, I'm sure you must be able to judge matters for yourselves, and I'm sure you understand what Qin Xiao's personality is like. Need I explain further?\"First, I, Yun Bing, swear by my name that Zhou Qian's death had nothing to do with either of us.\"As for the reason of death, Qin Xiao has already made an allegation against us. I won't refute it now, in case you think that I'm taking advantage of an 'unconscious' person to shift all the blame onto him.\"Furthermore, if you do intend to blame us for Zhou Qian's death, then I, on behalf of the Yun clan, will take all of you on. However, I caution the two of you to tread carefully: to preserve your own autonomy, and not to be manipulated into a rash decision by someone else here.\"\"I, Chu Feng, agree with Yun Bing! The Yun and Chu clans will fight together.\" After Yun Bing had finished, Chu Feng, who had finally calmed down, immediately voiced his agreement.Li Jin and Zhao Jia glanced at each other. In the end, Li Jin spoke up. \"We three corporations will keep your words in mind. That being said, if our investigation reveals that Zhou Qian's death was caused by the two of you, we won't stop at anything to avenge Zhou Qian!\"Yun Bing smiled. \"I hope your investigation goes smoothly. I don\u2019t mind a challenge, but I don't intend to take the blame for someone else's actions. The moonlight wyrm we fought has likely exceeded the boundaries of a superior-grade lifeform, so I caution you to be wary as you leave.\"Her final words caused a hush to descend among the gathered hunters. Beyond superior-grade? Didn't that mean... that the moonlight wyrm was a peak-grade lifeform?How could that be? Hadn't the world federation indicated that the highest-grade lifeform in the first realm would only be superior-grade? How could a peak-grade lifeform exist here? Danger and opportunity, all rolled up into one package...No wonder even the top hunters like Yun Bing, Chu Feng, and Qin Xiao would have ended up in such a battered state, and no wonder Zhou Qian had lost his life.\"Thank you for the information, Yun Bing.\" Li Jin's eyes sparkled with greed, clearly having been enticed by the prospect of hunting a peak-grade lifeform.\"Li Jin, let me reiterate: do not provoke that wyrm! No number of elites will be enough to close the gap between it and us! I bid you farewell.\" Yun Bing, who had felt the terror of the wyrm's attack, couldn't help trying to dissuade Li Jin from his foolishness.She turned to leave with Chu Feng and their troops.\"Please, wait! I have a question for Chu Feng.\" Zhao Jia, standing by Li Jin's side, suddenly yelled out after the two clans had taken a few steps.Instead of turning around, Chu Feng spoke with some frustration, \"Apologies, Zhao Jia, I can't answer your question. That thief was far too sly, and I couldn't even make out his appearance!\"His words shocked the gathered hunters. Not only had this mysterious hunter stolen the prey from under the six clans' noses, no one had even seen his appearance! Who would believe something so ridiculous?Regardless of who believed it or not, that was the truth. Zhao Jia was certain that Chu Feng wouldn't lie about this: after all, it was too embarrassing\u2014the six most influential clans of the Blacksteel settlement, losing to a lone hunter!Not only had they failed to obtain much of value, all the leaders had sustained some degree of injury, and quite a few of their subordinates had died to the superior-grade venombane scorpion's attack.That was the darkest night that the six clans had experienced ever since entering the dimensional world. Each leader cursed the mysterious hunter who had stolen the fruits of their labor. If they ever found out who he was, they would make him suffer for what he had done!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Full HaulZhang Lie was certain that the six clans would try to take revenge, but he wasn't worried at all. Under ordinary circumstances, he wouldn't even appear on their lists of suspects. No one would believe that someone with his reputation would be able to snatch superior-grade soulshard from the six great clans, let alone to do it unseen.As for Zhang Lie, he had finally finished with that night's errands. The outcome had been perfect for him, but for the six clans, on the other hand...As they were silently retreating, they encountered the horde of hunters that was heading toward the scene from the Blacksteel settlement. The hunters were rushing to the Moonlit Pond overnight, hoping to get the best rewards before anyone else got there, but the six clans had monopolized everything!Naturally, there would be some hostility between the six clans and the horde of hunters\u2014but that was trivial to deal with; what they couldn't risk was angering the wyrm slumbering at the bottom of the pond. As a result, the six clans had no choice but to resort to a peaceful settlement of affairs, as far away from the pond as possible.Of course, none of this had anything to do with Zhang Lie anymore. He had already returned safely to the settlement, so why would he care about what the other hunters were up to?He rented a room in the Blackgold Inn of the Blacksteel settlement.Whereas the Blacksteel Inn was governed by the artificial intelligence itself and was the safest inn in the settlement, the Blackgold Inn was privately owned. Because of Wang Xiaohua's occupancy in the Blacksteel Inn, there were far too many hunters lurking about its vicinity, and Zhang Lie naturally wouldn't choose to live there.The Blackgold Inn was constructed jointly by the three corporations, and its interior was lavishly decorated. It was widely regarded as the best inn in the settlement. Of course, such a lavish hotel would charge an exorbitant fee, but this was nothing to Zhang Lie now.His thirty-thousand point bet on himself had earned him a shocking 3.6 million points, and he was now among the richest hunters of the settlement. He certainly had the wherewithal to let loose.After having a long, relaxing bath, he began to look over his spoils. What he had earned over the last five days was worth hundreds of times what he had obtained over the past three months. Even excluding the profits from the bet, he had made a killing.Qin Xiaotian and his team had provided Zhang Lie with over thirty soulshards. Zhang Lie wasn't interested in most of them, and had listed them up for trade. Then, he had harvested quite a few rare herbs from the venombane glade, and he had even stolen the kill on the superior-grade venombane scorpion present there.There were over a hundred sprigs of herbs. The most important one was a main ingredient for Potion #2, and a few others could be used to brew potions that were direct counters to certain genetic lifeforms. He had no choice but to bring forward his plans for brewing Potion #2, because that particular ingredient was extremely difficult to store.After sorting through the gathered herbs, Zhang Lie finally retrieved the superior-grade scorpion carcass. It really wasn't very large, and could fit entirely on Zhang Lie's palm. However, its crystalline exoskeleton was quite unique.Of course, the reason he brought it out was in order to prepare it for consumption, so he could finally get more superior gene fragments. Luckily, his luxurious suite came with a well-furnished kitchen.Scorpion-type lifeforms weren't too uncommon in the dimensional world, and most people would consume it deep-fried. Following this trend, Zhang Lie began to prepare a meal of sumptuous deep-fried scorpion.However, the venombane scorpion was so poisonous that he would have to start by removing its poison sac, then counteract the remnants of the poison with certain herbal ingredients. Otherwise, Zhang Lie might well become the first hunter to die of poisoning himself while trying to extract gene fragments from a superior-grade lifeform.Of course, having been a fourth-realm hunter in the past, all of this was easily handled with Zhang Lie's experience. With surprising deftness, he extracted the poison sac from the scorpion, marinated it with a specialized herbal concoction, and began deep-frying it.As the oil sizzled, Zhang Lie probed the superior-grade soulshard in his soulspace to discover its effects. The soulshard was a deep, mysterious purple, and he could see the outline of a sword deep within it. As expected, it was a weapon-type soulshard!His Galewind wasn't too bad against mutated-grade lifeforms, but it would be ineffective against superior-grade lifeforms. This sword would greatly enhance his ability to damage superior-grade lifeforms, and would remove one of his shortcomings.Very quickly, the fragrant deep-fried scorpion was ready to be consumed. Deep-fried scorpion tasted far better than he had expected: much like lobster or crab meat, with a unique texture of its own.As he digested the meat, the will of the world announced:[For consuming the flesh of a superior-grade venombane scorpion, you received one superior gene fragment. Current total: 11][For consuming the flesh of a superior-grade venombane scorpion, you received one superior gene fragment. Current total: 12][...one superior gene fragment. Current total: 18]As Zhang Lie consumed the last scorpion leg, he found himself with eight additional superior gene fragments.The only thing left on the table was a dismembered scorpion exoskeleton. Even so, Zhang Lie wasn't finished. After preparing a few more herbs, he made a soup with the scorpion's carapace as its main ingredient.After drinking it all, Zhang Lie obtained one additional gene fragment, for nineteen in all.An individual lifeform would provide at most ten gene fragments when consumed. However, it was rare that a superior-grade lifeform could be consumed in its entirety. In most circumstances, it was thus impossible for a hunter to get ten superior gene fragments from a superior-grade lifeform.For example, after draining the blood and removing the poison sac of this venombane scorpion, it could hardly be expected to provide more than nine superior gene fragments.Zhang Lie rinsed and dried the scorpion's carapace, then returned it to his potbellied-toad pouch. It was still a treasure, after all: even after being deep-fried and boiled, it still maintained impressive structural integrity, and it was tough and resilient. Even though he only had a palm's worth of material, it would still be invaluable for forging purposes.After packing up the scorpion carapace and cleaning everything up, Zhang Lie couldn't wait to activate the superior-grade venombane-scorpion shard in his soulspace.A shortsword with a faintly purple sheen appeared in Zhang Lie's right palm. Whereas a regular longsword would have a meter-long blade, this scorpion shortsword only had a blade about seventy centimeters long. It wasn't particularly long, but it wasn't all that short, either.The hilt was a deep purple, and the crossguard's design was that of a venombane scorpion with its stinger raised high, poised to strike. Zhang Lie immediately felt a strange power emanating from the shortsword in his hand.When he activated it, Zhang Lie's body disappeared from sight.This ability had already been demonstrated by the venombane scorpion when it was fleeing for its life: it felt as though he had become one with his environment. Even a gust of wind seemed to pass through him without impediment.As long as he didn't make any sudden movement, even a hunter skilled in perception like Chu Feng would be unable to detect his presence.Not only did this shortsword possess a stealth ability superior to that from a mutated-grade venombane-scorpion soulshard, the blade was naturally covered in the potent venombane poison.Of course, as its owner, Zhang Lie would be forever immune to this sort of poison, and it would even grant him partial immunity to the effects of most other poisons. After all, venombane scorpions could consume all sorts of poisons, and he could even use the blade to suck up any poison present in other hunters' bodies.Zhang Lie naturally christened this shortsword Venombane.After dealing with his spoils, Zhang Lie slumped into bed and fell asleep immediately. He had done quite a lot that night, and he was tired after all his exertion. Fortunately, all his struggles had been worth it, and he was very pleased with what he had accomplished.On the other hand, others were having a nightmare\u2014Qin Xiao, Wang Xiaohua, and the Zhou clan.Qin Xiao, who had fortuitously escaped a confrontation with Chu Feng and then with the gathered hunters from the Blacksteel settlement by 'fainting', was now so enraged that he almost actually fainted.While the six clans were surrounded by Blacksteel hunters, he had overheard some hunters murmuring about how Zhang Lie had exposed Wang Xiaohua's misdeeds. The fiasco unfolding on the forum suggested that it was far more likely that Qin Xiaotian had died at Wang Xiaohua's hands, not Zhang Lie's.Furthermore, his act of pushing Zhou Qian out of the cave to save his own life had landed him and the entire Qin clan in dire straits.\"What? What did you say? You didn't manage to find Xiaotian's corpse?!\" Qin Xiao glared at Qin Feng, his eyes red with rage.\"Yes, Master,\" Qin Feng replied. \"We combed that mound in and out, but we didn't even find a scrap of clothing, let alone a corpse! Wang Xiaohua had to have lied to you!\"\"Wang Xiaohua!\" Her seemingly gentle face flashed by Qin Xiao's mind, his anger burgeoning.Qin Xiao felt as though he understood it all now. This was all a trap, one set up by the Wang clan.First, Wang Xiaohua would entice Qin Xiaotian with her looks, then deliberately induce a confrontation between Xiaotian and a third party. Using this confrontation, she would lure Xiaotian into a trap, steal his soulshards, and then place the blame on that third party: the unfortunate Zhang Lie.Not only that, she would even embroil the other five clans in the conflict. She had planned for them to all head to the venombane glade, hired a hunter to snatch away the fruits of their labor, and even lure out the moonlight wyrm to kill him!What a malicious plan! She had been targeting the Qin clan\u2014and even the entire Blacksteel settlement\u2014all along!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Inevitable Ruination\"Wang Xiaohua... \u00a0what a cunning actress, what a malicious plan! To think that I, Qin Xiao, would be stymied by this slip of a girl!Once we return to the Blacksteel settlement, keep Wang Xiaohua under heavy guard. Immediately send someone to the city of Ning and have them start surveillance on the Wang clan's every action!\"\"Yes, Captain!\"Qin Xiao immediately focused his attention on the Wang clan, ignoring powerless actors like Zhang Lie in this whole affair. Oh, they would pay dearly for the loss of his arm!With the current advancement of technology, it would be possible for him to recover the use of his tattered arm, but the process would require at least a month of intensive care. This implied that Qin Xiao wouldn't be able to hunt superior-grade lifeforms for the next month, and it could well impact his chances for the Void Cup in three months.If this really were the case, then it would be a lethal blow to Qin Xiao.At this moment, Qin Xiao's hatred toward Wang Xiaohua and the entire Wang clan at large surged to unimaginable capacities.Of course, Qin Xiao wasn't the only one angered by the Wang clan. The three corporations and the Yun and Chu clans had all quickly connected Wang Xiaohua with the Wang clan. Wang Xiaohua was nothing more than a rich, spoiled heiress, but the Wang clan was a big name in Ning.There were hundreds of settlements in the dimensional world, and the Blacksteel settlement was only one of many. Although the Wang clan might not be famous within the Blacksteel settlement, they were one of the top clans of the Bronzetooth settlement in the extreme south of the dimensional world.With the Void Cup about to occur, the major powers of each settlement were entering the last stages of their preparation for the Cup, and it was inevitable that some hunters would try to sabotage their opponents.After all, this was something that had occurred during previous iterations of the Void Cup as well.In the past, the Blacksteel settlement hadn't been a major power. This time around, however, Yun Bing, Chu Feng, and Qin Xiao were upcoming stars that could well pose a threat to those from other settlements.It wouldn't be strange for others to try to get rid of their opponents.Most importantly, she was the instigator of the entire affair at the venombane glade, so it was natural that suspicion would be directed at her, especially given her inextricable link to the main branch of the Wang clan.In truth, there were many hunters in the Blacksteel settlement who felt the same way as Qin Xiao. They focused all their attention on Wang Xiaohua and the Wang clan, and failed to notice Zhang Lie, who had vanished from the gene leaderboard quite a while back.As a result, Zhang Lie had precious uninterrupted time for strengthening and advancing himself.That night, representatives from all six clans rushed to the Blacksteel Inn to confront Wang Xiaohua. However, by the time they reached the inn, Wang Xiaohua had already rushed back to Earth. Her sudden disappearance confirmed everyone's suspicions that she had instigated the entire event.After all, she was the one who had claimed that Qin Xiaotian's corpse would be buried within the venombane glade, and the truth of her words were easy to determine.They had gone to the venombane glade and returned without Qin Xiaotian's corpse, battered by a whole slew of injuries, without the prize that they had been hunting all night. And now that they tried to confront her, they found that she had vanished!What other explanation could there be?All six clans began to surveil the Wang clan. Even the older-generation clan heads had begun to make their moves upon hearing about the news.Back in Wang Jianxin's house in Ning, Wang Xiaohua was pitifully eyeing her raging father as though she were a convict waiting for judgment.\"Xiaohua, you've really been far too rash! I told you not to mess with him, didn't I? And now look at what you've done! Tell me the truth: did Qin Xiaotian's death have anything to do with you?\"Wang Jianxin frowned, having realized the importance of the matter. He scrutinized his daughter with his gaze, not daring to miss even the slightest detail. As an old hand, he had sensed the latent danger in this conundrum, something he hadn't felt for years.Wang Xiaohua, tears streaking down her face, cried out, \"Dad, Xiaotian's my boyfriend! How could I kill him? Don't you believe your own daughter? I'm telling you, Zhang Lie was the mastermind behind everything! He killed Xiaotian, he killed everyone! And then he stole our soulshards!\"Except for me and him, everyone else who entered the venombane glade is dead! He didn't leave me alive because he pitied me\u2014he's using me as a scapegoat!\"And he even found someone to post an anonymous thread on the forum saying that he saw me scheme against Xiaotian and the rest of them, and they keep besmirching my name! I've tried to argue against them for hours on end, but no one in the settlement believes me!\"Dad, I need your help. Please, I feel like the Qin clan is going to try to kill me otherwise!\"Despite Wang Xiaohua's melodramatic behavior, Wang Jianxin let out a breath. \"Are you finally afraid now? You make me clean up your mess every single time\u2014what's going to happen when I'm not around anymore?\"If you truly didn't hurt Qin Xiaotian, then what do you have to worry about? As for the Qin clan, you don't have to worry about that either. As long as you didn't kill Qin Xiaotian, I can guarantee that you'll be safe.\"As for clearing up your name, forget it. The moment you and Zhang Lie returned to the settlement together, you lost whatever chance you had at that. The more you try to defend yourself, the more they'll accuse you: you're from the Wang clan, but Zhang Lie's a nobody. Your connections and wealth make you a target.\"Upon hearing her father's words, Wang Xiaohua calmed down a little. \"Dad, in that case, what should we do? I was the one who buried Xiaotian's corpse myself! I told everyone that, as long as they find the corpse, it'll be clear that I'm not lying. Can't that clear my name?\"\"Xiaohua, you're still far too naive. I've just told you that you'll never be able to clear your name as long as you're alive, and people will always be much more suspicious of you than they would Zhang Lie. Don't you know why? Who would believe that a supposed weakling like Zhang Lie would be able to overcome you and Qin Xiaotian on his own?\"But you don't have to be too worried either: at any rate, you're still a member of the Wang clan. Even if you really had committed the murder, just the Qin clan alone wouldn't be able to do anything to you.\"And while I might not have much standing in the main household, at the very least, I'm still a member of the clan, and our clan certainly won't let us be bullied like this. Let me call your third uncle and ask him to speak to the other clans on your behalf. This should resolve the problem.\"Wang Xiaohua was overjoyed. \"Really? That would really be a weight off my shoulders! Dad, won't you call him now? Qin Xiao's too frightening, and those hunters from the Blacksteel settlement are still keeping guard outside my hotel room! I don't even dare step outside! They're all so annoying!\"Wang Jianxin could think of no better way of resolving the current dilemma. However, just as he was about to call the current head of the Wang household, Wang Han, the holographic display lit up.Wang Han was contacting them!Wang Jianxin couldn't help but think that something was amiss, but he didn't dare refuse a call from the head of the household himself. He immediately accepted the call.The next moment, the holographic projector showed the cold mien of a middle-aged man.\"Wang Jianxin, you bastard, are you trying to ruin the Wang clan?! The elders of the clan are going to arrive within ten minutes to take Wang Xiaohua away. Hand her to them immediately!\" Wang Jianxin and Wang Xiaohua greeted him respectfully, but Wang Han ignored the customary greetings and began yelling at them the moment the call connected.Wang Jianxian had to reevaluate the importance of this entire affair. \"Wang Han, what's going on? Xiaohua's my only child, and I would be fine entrusting her to your care, but why the urgency?\"He was so indulgent of his only daughter that he still intended to protect her even at this critical juncture.\"What's the matter? You're asking me what's the matter? Don't you think that's something I should be asking the two of you?!\" Wang Han's roar clearly conveyed his rage.\"Just now, Qin Zongming, Zhou Tianqi, Yun Yi, Chu Tiannan, Li Qing, and Zhao You all called me, 'congratulating' me for my accomplishment! They praised how devious a certain hunter from our Wang household was, stealing the kill of a superior-grade lifeform, killing Zhou Qian, crippling one of Qin Xiao's arms, and causing the entire Blacksteel settlement to erupt in chaos!\"How should I know what's going on?! Tell Wang Xiaohua to pack up and head straight to the Wang manor to explain herself. Otherwise, even the Wang household won't be able to protect her. The six clans have already started surveilling the Wang estate.\"Wang Jianxin and Wang Xiaohua gaped at Wang Han's words. Before Wang Jianxin could react, Wang Han had cut the connection. Clearly, he was telling them that the only way for Wang Xiaohua to remain protected was for them to stay where they were.By now, even Wang Jianxin was starting to panic. \"Xiaohua, tell me what's going on!\"\"Dad, I don't know! I don't know anything! I don't know anything about stealing a superior-grade lifeform, killing Zhou Qian, and crippling Qin Xiao! I only told them how to head to the venombane glade!\"It wasn't me\u2014do you think someone like me could do any of this? You know how I am! It has to be Zhang Lie, right, it can't be anyone but him! He's taking revenge on us, and he wants to kill us both! It has to be him!\"Wang Xiaohua's pride and arrogance had crumbled away, replaced by overwhelming, unrelenting despair. It was too late, far too late for her. Even if Wang Xiaohua were to remain alive, her future was doomed to bleakness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: Bleak OutcomeWang Jianxin thundered, \"So what if it were him? Do you have any proof? Would others believe you? Zhang Lie's famous in your settlement for being useless, a fool who spent three months killing white grubs!\"Do you think that the six clans, or even the Blacksteel hunters, would believe that all their plans were waylaid by a fool?! They wouldn't! \u00a0It's impossible! Even if Zhang Lie were to step out now and claim that he planned everything, no one would believe him!\"From the very moment you stepped back into the Blacksteel settlement, you fell into his trap! There's no way out for you now. Escape! Run away now! You won't be able to withstand the household's punishment, and once you admit to the crime, our whole clan will be sentenced to death. Before the elders get here, escape while you can, as far away as possible!\"I'll do my best to delay them, and I'll help you find a way out of this mess. If possible, head to Zhang Lie's place first\u2014getting to that crippled sister of his will be your only hope. What are you waiting for? Leave, run, flee!\"\"Dad, but\u2014where would I go?\" Wang Xiaohua blinked at him with tear-stained eyes.Wang Jianxin pushed a few point cards into her hands. \"Leave Ning, and don't head toward any city controlled by the six clans. Go anywhere else you want! Remember, within the next three months, don't attempt to contact me, and don't attempt to contact any of your friends. Do you understand?\"With his hands firmly on Wang Xiaohua's shoulders, Wang Jianxin pushed Wang Xiaohua out of his house.\"Dad, I'm scared!\"\"Don't worry. With me around, everything will be resolved eventually. But you have to leave now!\"Wang Xiaohua's heart was filled with dread as to what she would have to endure.After consoling Wang Xiaohua, Wang Jianxin stuffed her into his hovercar. Not five minutes after Wang Xiaohua left, three imposing middle-aged men rushed into the Wang estate. But Wang Xiaohua had already left, so they couldn't get what they came for. In the end, they had no choice but to take Wang Jianxin into custody instead.In a mansion in Ning, Wang Han stared at his brother in disappointment. \"Have you thought about the consequences of letting your daughter go free?\"Wang Jianxin replied, \"Of course I have, but how can I bear to see my daughter be punished for something she hasn't done? She's innocent! Why should she have to be the scapegoat?! You know they'd kill her!\"Wang Han shook his head. \"No, the Wang clan wouldn't let her be killed. We need Xiaohua here in order to reveal the truth behind the entire affair, in order to reclaim justice for our clan!\"But now? Now that you've sent her away, if anything happens to her, we won't have any means of refuting the claims leveled against us! Look at this report. I told you how important this matter was, and the other clans aren't going to stop until they've hunted her down!\"Call her back immediately. If she gets caught, if she gets killed\u2014that'll be the end of our clan.\"Wang Jianxin looked over the report, his face darkening as he flipped through its pages. What a nasty, vicious plan! It was clearly meant to destroy Wang Xiaohua, and even the rest of the Wang clan as well.Over the course of a single night, the entire Blacksteel settlement, including its six most influential clans, had become enemies of the Wang clan. The Zhou, Qin, and Chu clans, who had suffered most, even claimed the Wang clan as their sworn enemy.Unless the Wang clan could provide irrefutable evidence that Wang Xiaohua played no role in the affair, none of the three clans would let matters rest so easily.\"Justice? Brother, don't lie to me. I'm not like Xiaohua, and I don't believe in some supposed justice! It's too hard to recover the truth. I've asked Xiaohua and she doesn't know anything\u2014the other party has made sure that there's no way out for her!\" Wang Jianxian's face was pale, as though he were a beached fish.\"Regardless, you had better call Xiaohua back. With her around, we can at least explain that we're investigating what happened, but if she vanishes, we'll be tacitly accepting responsibility for what has happened!\"\"I'll call her back, but you have to promise, as the head of the household, that you won't throw her out to the wolves, or you'll have to kill me first!\"Despite having been expelled from the main household, Wang Jianxin couldn't turn his back from it completely, and he eventually relented after proposing his own condition.Wang Han shook his head in exasperation. \"Alright, I promise you I'll do my utmost best to protect her from retribution. Send for her!\"\"Your best isn't enough\u2014you have to promise you won't hand her over!\"Wang Han inclined his head and fisted his hair in frustration. \"Fine. I promise I won't hand her over. Send her back!\"Wang Jianxin gave his brother a piercing glance before activating the transceiver on his wristwatch, a specialized communication tool between father and daughter.However, Wang Xiaohua rejected the call. When he tried calling her again, the call was blocked completely. It was only then that Wang Jianxin remembered that he had warned Wang Xiaohua not to try to communicate with him, or with any of her friends.She likely thought that the Wang clan was trying to find her through Wang Jianxin, so she had blocked all calls.\"Quick, head to this location!\" Wang Jianxin, panicking, immediately showed Wang Han's subordinates the coordinates listed on his wristwatch.\"Brother, if something were to happen to the Wang clan, you realize you'll be held solely responsible for the clan's downfall?! How are you going to explain this to Father?!\"Wang Han was barely able to keep himself from screaming.\"There's nothing I can do about it now, is there? Quick, send someone to Zhang Lie's house. As long as we have Zhang Hanxiang in custody, we might be able to salvage the situation.\"\"Zhang Lie, Zhang Hanxiang? Zhang Yi's two children? Are you certain that he was the one responsible for all this?\" Wang Han was a little skeptical: who would believe that someone as young as Zhang Lie could come up with such a devious plan?After the incident, he had reviewed what little information he had on Zhang Lie: by all reports a mediocre, useless hunter who amounted to nothing. How could someone like him have offended all six clans, killed Zhou Qian, and crippled Qin Xiao within a single night? The very thought was ludicrous!Wang Jianxin's face turned even paler. Gritting his teeth, he said, \"Even if it wasn't him, he's clearly connected to this entire affair!\"Wang Bin, I want you to personally head to the Zhang house and to take both of them into custody. Make sure you don't alert any security guards along the way. The Void Cup's about to start, and we can't have anyone getting disqualified now!\"\"Yes, Head!\" One of Wang Han's subordinates strode forward, bowed, and rushed out.\"Why in the world would you provoke someone like him? As far as I understand, that brat's a useless hunter. If he weren't provoked, why would he risk his life to create all this trouble?\"You've been blinded by money, Brother! No matter how many treasures that Zhang Yi had, he was only ever a peak second-realm hunter. He wouldn't have had anything of true value! If the Wang clan were to suffer because of this incident, even I won't be able to protect you and your daughter.\"\"I know full well what I did! If things come to that, hand me over. I'll bear responsibility for everything! Give the other clans some benefits as compensation, and count it as my debt to the clan. I have no choice but to repay it in my next life, don't I?\"Wang Jianxin would even sacrifice himself to protect his daughter, and no amount of criticism on Wang Han's part would change anything. Instead, Wang Han only sighed. If Wang Xiaohua couldn't be found, then the six clans' grudges wouldn't be resolved satisfactorily. In that case, they would take it out on the Wang clan.In truth, they had already begun taking action against the Wang clan upon receiving the news that Wang Jianxin had been summoned to the Wang headquarters. All manner of incidents were suddenly happening to the businesses owned by the Wang clan.Nasty rumors and gossip about the Wang clan abounded. In a matter of minutes, the Wang clan's assets had dropped by over a hundred million, and that number was surely just going to keep increasing.Worst of all, of these six clans, the Yun and Chu clans were even more powerful than the Wang clan, and if they had set their mind to it, they could have ruined the Wang clan instantly. It was because of that potential threat that the Wang clan could do nothing but suffer their losses in silence.Meanwhile, Wang Xiaohua had finally made her way\u2014after quite a number of twists and detours\u2014to Zhang Lie's house. However, she only dared to look at it from afar, because she could see Zhang Lie making breakfast through an open window.By now, Wang Xiaohua thought of Zhang Lie as a demon. She didn't dare to appear in front of him, let alone provoke him.Zhang Lie didn't notice her presence, but he was certain that the mess that he had inadvertently created would only grow larger with time. His sister, Hanxiang, would therefore end up in danger.As a result, after his restful sleep in the dimensional world's inn, he immediately headed back home. After having breakfast, Zhang Lie immediately brought Zhang Hanxiang to an inspection bureau.The inspection bureau was a government organization responsible for testing and recording the quantity and quality of a hunter's genetic energy, constitution, and strength in order to categorize that hunter as a certain class of citizen.Given Zhang Lie's current numbers, he was quite confident that he could be tested as a first-class citizen. And as a first-class citizen, one of his direct relatives would be able to benefit from all that his status conferred. In particular, he would be able to send his sister to a specialized high school for further education.Once she entered the school, she would be protected. Because of the stellar and spatial warfare that had led to extreme casualties at the start of the century, there had been extremely heavy emphasis placed on cultivating the talents of the next generation.Part of this emphasis manifested in the form of extreme protection and an absolute ban on violence on campus grounds. As long as Hanxiang was properly enrolled as a student, even the Wang clan would be powerless to act against her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Foolproof PlanBecause Zhang Lie and Zhang Hanxiang arrived at the inspection bureau early, there were relatively few hunters present, and he was able to get tested quickly.The inspection consisted of two stages: first, constitution, and second, mental acuity. The constitution test was itself divided into two smaller parts. The first was a test of strength, and the second a test of speed. Of course, neither test allowed the use of genetic energy.\"Good luck, Brother!\" Outside the testing area, Hanxiang was pumping her fists, causing Zhang Lie to smile.The testing apparatus wasn't all too complicated: it was just a sandbag with a few extra gimmicks.\"No. 4, Li Feng, first attempt!\"\"Strength: 4.5, C-grade. Pass!\"No. 5, Song Jia, third attempt!\"\"Strength: 3.3, D-grade. Fail!\"The synthetic voice of the supervising robot caused some to erupt in joy, and others in tears.The world government had decided to quantify a hunter's strength in order to better categorize them. Those hunters who had capped their mutated gene capacity would need a strength value of 4.0 to pass. A 4.0 indicated that a hunter had about three to four times the strength of a regular human. Failing to get a 4.0 or higher meant that those hunters were unable to make full use of their own strength.After waiting for a few minutes, Zhang Lie's name was finally called, and he walked forward to an unoccupied sandbag.\"No. 9, Zhang Lie, first attempt!\"Zhang Lie stepped forward, pretending to charge up his strength. Only when his face was red from holding his breath in did he step forward and punch the sandbag with one heavy blow.\"Strength: 4.2, C-grade. You still have two more attempts to try to improve your score. Do you wish to continue?\"\"No, just passing is enough for me!\"Zhang Lie happily took the certification card that the robotic attendant handed over, then walked back to where his sister was seated.Just as with the test of strength, Zhang Lie managed a borderline pass for the test of speed and mental acuity. In little more than ten minutes, Zhang Lie had obtained a silver first-class identification card, as well as a silver-gray subsidiary card for Hanxiang.Looking at these two cards, Zhang Lie and Zhang Hanxiang both began to smile.Hanxiang gasped. \"Brother, with this card, can I attend Holy Glory Academy now?\"Zhang Lie nodded. \"Of course! In fact, I was planning on bringing you there to enroll today. What do you think?\"\"Today?\"\"Have you forgotten? \u00a0Holy Glory Academy is the best of the schools in the region, and they have an open admission policy even in the middle of a semester!\"\"But isn't there an exorbitant fee if you do that...?\"\"Don't worry, I can handle the expenses. With me around, you just have to focus on your studies!\"\"Brother, thank you!\"\"We're family, aren't we? Let's go.\"The two of them headed right for the school district.Just as they did so, Wang Bin arrived at the Zhang house. Of course, by the time he got there, there was no one inside. His delay was understandable: he had little experience in the commoners' districts, and he didn't realize the extent to which the morning rush would clog up all traffic.After arriving, he received a message from the clan stating that their target had been sighted at the inspection bureau.However, he wasn't told to give chase; others had already been dispatched to that location, and he was to head back to the manor instead.However, those subordinates dispatched to the inspection bureau also failed to find their target, and were unable to retrieve anything but some footage of Zhang Lie's inspection exam.As he glanced at that footage, at how Zhang Lie was barely able to meet the target with a huge expenditure of effort, Wang Han turned to Wang Jianxin skeptically.\"Brother, are you certain a kid like this had something to do with the entire affair?\"Wang Han wasn't the only one with suspicions: everyone who had seen the footage felt the same way. After all, what had happened that night at the venombane glade was a shocking feat of cunning, certainly not something an ordinary hunter would be able to come up with.\"Don't be tricked by his appearance, Wang Han! He's a shrewd fellow, and I bet he's faking his performance!\"Given what had happened with the rental agreement, Wang Jianxin thought that he had a good grasp of what Zhang Lie was like, but no one else thought similarly.\"It's not a matter of whether we believe it, certainly, but whether the Blacksteel hunters and the six clans will. Even if we made someone like him reveal the truth, would anyone even believe it?\"Wang Jianxin shook his head. \"Believe me, as long as we can control this lad, all our problems will be resolved. \"Where is he now?\"Wang Han's face darkened. \"On campus grounds!\"\"Didn't I tell you? He's a sneaky bastard! Damn it, I bet he's sent his sister to one of the academies so we can't get ahold of her!\" Wang Jianxin had discovered Zhang Lie's plan.\"Not only his sister\u2014if I'm not wrong, he'll find a teleportation device to enter the dimensional world directly from the academy. And once he's inside, as long as he stays within the settlement, we won't be able to do anything to him.\" Wang Han's face was icy.\"Brother, we have to think of some other strategy. We don't have any more time to waste on this kid!\"Indeed, the most pressing issue was time. The longer this problem dragged out, the longer the six clans would continue clamping down on their businesses, and the more severely their finances would be disrupted.Zhang Lie had managed to turtle himself up so tightly that, within the short term, no one from the Wang clan would be able to do anything about him.The Holy Glory Academy had a somewhat Western name, but the construction and style of the buildings was all perfectly oriental. The city of Ning lay at the heart of China, and the weight of that culture would not be so easily displaced. Although the academy did hire foreign professors, it was still largely in line with traditional Chinese ideals.Given how much money Zhang Lie was waving around to expedite the process, it was no surprise that Zhang Hanxiang's enrollment proceeded as smoothly as it did. In no more than half an hour, they were done with all the paperwork.After considering the issue of Zhang Hanxiang's safety, Zhang Lie decided to spend a veritable fortune\u2014a million dollars a month\u2014to rent the highest-class robot companion for his sister. Zhang Hanxiang was his only sibling, and her disability could well make her a target. He didn't want her to have to suffer any harassment on his behalf.\"Brother, did something happen to you inside the dimensional world?\" Seeing Zhang Lie's behavior, even the innocent Zhang Hanxiang seemed to notice that something was amiss.Zhang Lie laughed lightly. \"A small problem, but don't worry, I'm alright now. I'm just afraid some people might try to get at me through you. But since you're on campus grounds now, and with this robotic companion for protection, I believe you're safe from any potential danger.\"That being said, Hanxiang, make sure you notify me if anything\u2014anything at all\u2014were to happen! Keep this close to you at all times. If you encounter any sort of danger, press it and I'll be notified immediately.\"Zhang Lie handed her what looked like a black button. Zhang Hanxiang seemed a little perturbed, but she immediately kept the button without asking any questions. After all, her brother was the only person she could rely on, as well as the person to whom she was closest.This black button, deceptively small and simple as it was, was actually a device that was able to bypass the technological restriction of the dimensional world and transmit signals from Earth. Zhang Lie had spent a whopping half a million points on it, and it was a device that no ordinary hunter would be able to afford.\"I understand, Brother. I'll be safe within the campus, and with all these safeguards, I don't have to worry about anything at all. Brother, you're the one who has to be more careful\u2014I wouldn't be able to stand losing you.\"Zhang Lie laughed. \"Don't worry about me, Hanxiang. I don't have to fear my enemies\u2014they should fear me!\"After touring the campus grounds with Hanxiang, and after introducing himself to her professors, Zhang Lie waved goodbye to his sister. As Wang Han had anticipated, he found a teleportation apparatus and headed straight back to the dimensional world.He returned to his room in the Blackgold Inn and immediately began to browse the forum to understand what had transpired since his departure. Of course, the only thing of note was still the battle at the venombane glade.The forum was filled with rumors and speculation about what had happened there. Of course, it was difficult to discern between actual information and hearsay, or, worse, fake news.However, even though most people weren't aware of the events that had taken place at the glade, the aftermath was clearly known to all. Zhou Qian, head of the Zhou corporation, had perished. Qin Xiao had lost an arm. Yun Bing, Chu Feng, and many other hunters had suffered serious injuries.Such casualties had undoubtedly sparked interest into the details of what had happened in the glade.\"If you all want to know the truth so badly, then I have no choice but to oblige!\"Soon after, the article\u00a0Showdown at the Venombane Glade (specifics included)\u00a0appeared on the forum. It spread like wildfire.Zhang Lie had repeated his past strategy for dealing with Wang Xiaohua. In this post, from the perspective of a bystander, he exhaustively described the events that had taken place in the glade: how Qin Xiao had lost his arm; who had actually pushed Zhou Qian out of the tunnel, causing him to die from the moonlight wyrm's attack; who had ultimately ended up killing the superior-grade scorpion; and even how the moonlight wyrm had been lured out.And this time, over 90% of what he had written was even the honest truth!Of course, the author was again anonymous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: Technique AuctionAs Zhang Lie anticipated, his article rapidly set the hunters of the Blacksteel settlement abuzz.Several of the leaders of the expedition, like Yun Bing and Chu Feng, had even replied confirming the accuracy of the article. After all, what it described was essentially identical to what they had experienced. In fact, some parts of it went into even more detail than even they were aware of. The moment they read through the article, they were certain that the anonymous author had been at the scene during that fateful night.Most importantly, it had detailed how Qin Xiao had pushed Zhou Qian out of the cave to save his own life, so Yun Bing and Chu Feng would naturally support the article and spread it on their own.The six clans began hunting for this mysterious author, but to no avail.Every hunter in the settlement was guaranteed their privacy by the Blacksteel settlement's artificial intelligence. Without any authorization, it was impossible for anyone to break apart a hunter's anonymity. It was for this reason that Zhang Lie had dared to reveal such crucial information. He would be able to maintain his own anonymity while drawing out his enemies.After satisfying himself, he began to browse the trading post again.Zhang Lie believed that the Qin and Wang clans would have quite a lot of issues to contend with in the future. They wouldn't be able to spare the time or attention to deal with a nobody like him.And as for him, well, he was going to keep amassing his fortune. Most of the things that he had listed on the trading post had already sold. The soulshards owned by Qin Xiaotian and his team were grabbed almost as soon as they were listed.After all, the dimensional world was quite unlike reality. Except in the settlements, individual power dominated over everything. Even if Qin Xiao's own soulshards were somehow stolen and listed on the marketplace, some enterprising hunters would still buy them all.As a result, Zhang Lie earned another pile of points, though it paled in comparison to what he had obtained from betting on himself.What had caught his attention was a reply he had received on his request searching for water-attuned techniques. The reply came from a user with the alias Daffodil. She intimated that she had multiple water-attuned techniques, all of surpassingly high quality, but was afraid that Zhang Lie didn't have enough points for them.Her words would likely have stopped the Zhang Lie of a few days ago from enquiring further. After all, how could he have afforded those techniques? But now, he was filthy rich.He immediately replied, \"Show me what you've got! Rather than worrying about whether or not I can afford it, you should be worried about whether your techniques are high-quality enough to be worth my attention.\"To his surprise, she replied instantly. \"Excellent timing! I'm auctioning the techniques off right now.\"This reply immediately enticed Zhang Lie: any techniques that were put up for auction were generally high quality. Inferior goods wouldn't be worth the fee that the marketplace would take.Zhang Lie accessed the auction following her instructions, entering a virtual space with a raised circular stage and seats all around that stage.A woman, whom Zhang Lie assumed was this Daffodil, stood on stage in a pale white dress, gracefully showing off her goods. Surrounding the stage were the virtual avatars of countless buyers.Up on stage, beside the woman, a robot was demonstrating a water-attuned polearm technique. In a clear, crisp voice, she explained the technique that the robot was using.\"[Seacrest Blade], a high-grade technique buoyed by the force of the sea. Its patterns are as erratic and unpredictable as ocean waves, sure to confound your opponent. This water-attuned technique would be a valuable addition to any hunter's repertoire, and it has a starting bid of 7,000 points. Might anyone here be interested?\"\"10,000 points!\"\"12,000!\"\"I bid 15,000!\"Before Zhang Lie could even react, the price had doubled to 15,000 points, leaving him quite surprised.However, given that price, most hunters had sat back down again, unwilling to bid further. Even a particularly good high-grade technique was only worth 10,000 points at best.From Zhang Lie's perspective, while the waves that the technique generated were eye-catching, the actual bladework itself didn't seem like anything special. Furthermore, as a sword user, he had no interest in it.Sensing the lack of continued interest, the woman rapped her knuckles against the table. \"[Seacrest Blade], sold for 15,000 points! Next up, one of the centerpieces of this auction, the pinnacle-grade water-attuned technique, [Fists of the Silent Sea], a fist-based technique with immutable force!\"This time, the woman only provided a concise explanation before motioning to her robot.The robot struck with one fist, sending ripples of genetic energy through the air. It was a gentle movement, like the caress of wind over the water's surface, but with an undeterrable strength that could still even the roiling waves of the sea.A gentleness that belied its strength, a strength that could not be overcome. Dominating, overwhelming\u2014it certainly deserved its classification as a pinnacle-grade technique.This technique was undoubtedly superior to even most pinnacle-grade techniques.He wanted it.\"The starting bid for this technique will be 50,000 points!\"The moment Daffodil announced the price, a red-clothed man sitting near the front immediately raised his hand and shouted, \"55,000!\"\"Are you broke, to only raise the bid by 5,000? I'll bid 70,000 points!\" a man taunted from a sectioned-off area of the virtual hall, likely restricted to VIPs.\"Only 70,000? Song Yi, it looks like you're running out of points! This technique's compatible with my sister's framework, and I'll bid 100,000 points!\" Another voice spoke up, from a man dressed in blue not too far away.\"100,000 points for a pinnacle-grade technique is a bargain! I bid 120,000 points!\"The man in blue scoffed. \"If you want a bidding war, I'm happy to accompany you. 150,000 points!\"He was starting to smile amidst the other party's silence when Zhang Lie stood up. \"300,000 points!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: Penniless AgainThe gathered crowd had all gone silent.300,000 points? Double the last bid? What kind of rich asshole was this? No matter how many points he had, who would be so wasteful as to do something like this?!They all turned toward Zhang Lie, but unfortunately, all they could see was a black cloak.Even the loudmouthed VIPs had gone silent. Pinnacle-grade techniques tended to go for 200,000 points or so, and the fact that this hunter was bidding 300,000 points meant that this was a technique that he sorely needed.They had no intention to compete with him: after all, there were more techniques they could bid for instead.The host, Daffodil, waited for a few moments, surveying the crowd, before rapping her knuckles on the table again. \"300,000 points from the honored guest in black! The [Fists of the Silent Sea] will go to you!\"He swiped his point card and inputted the ID of the teleportation apparatus in his room. The purchase arrived not fifteen seconds later. It was divided into two parts, a manual detailing the technique and a holographic recording of a robot using the technique.After he confirmed receipt of the item, the points were transferred to Daffodil.The auction was still in progress, but Zhang Lie wasn't too interested in the remaining items up for bidding. However, just as he was about to leave, he found a few herbs that he was interested in, as well as another advanced water-attuned technique.In particular, the eye-of-night flower was yet another main ingredient for Potion #2. It was generally only available from the second realm onwards, so Zhang Lie was very surprised to see it on auction.With these discoveries, Zhang Lie certainly had to stay for the remainder of the auction.Since pillmaking wasn't yet a mature field, these herbs weren't worth very much, and Zhang Lie managed to obtain the eye-of-night at a shockingly cheap price of 10,000 points.Zhang Lie sat through the rest of the auction in boredom. After an entire hour, it was finally time for that genetic technique that he had been eyeing to come up for auction.Daffodil's face turned serious. \"Finally, our last and most valuable item for today: [The Boundless Blade].\"On stage, a worn, ancient manual appeared in front of the hunters' eyes.\"[The Boundless Blade], a mythic-grade sword technique: starting bid, 150,000 points.\"\"A mythic-grade technique?! Are you joking?\" Zhang Lie was also somewhat skeptical, but someone else spoke up before he could.A mythic-grade technique could easily become the signature technique of a dojo. For example, the premier dojo of Ning, the Blizzard Dojo, had been named after its signature mythic-grade technique, [Blizzard's Eye]. Zhang Lie hadn't expected that someone would be willing to trade a mythic-grade technique for points, at least not in the first realm.Daffodil didn't seem too bothered. Instead, she motioned to the robot beside her, which headed to center stage. The robot was so advanced that, from its outer appearance alone, it looked no different from a regular human.It placed one hand on the hilt of his sword, then froze at the precise moment of activation of the technique. Just this simple action was enough to reveal the technique's majesty: behind the robot flared the backdrop of a vast ocean, seeming to endow the robot with its strength.This was undoubtedly a mythic-grade technique, and even one that was water-attuned! He had to obtain this technique by any means!\"Does anyone still doubt the authenticity of this technique?\" Daffodil asked. \"This holographic display simulates the technique as a novice would activate it, and more specialized use of the technique is certainly possible with further study.\"From the crowd, a hunter piped up, \"Isn't it daylight robbery to try to sell a mythic-grade technique for 1.5 million? This is a technique, not a framework! I'll pay 1.2 million at most\u2014\"\"If you don't have points, screw off and stop embarrassing yourself! I'll bid 1.6 million!\"\"You think you can get a mythic-grade technique with just 1.6 million points? I'll bid 1.8 million! I'm Sun Mu from the Greenforest settlement\u2014do you know who I am? Don't you dare try to outbid me!\"\"What Greenforest settlement? What Sun clan? Why should I care who you are? This is an anonymous auction! How do you expect to take revenge on me when you don't even know my identity? I, a roadside weed, will bid two million points!\"Indeed, it wasn't a smart move for hunters to reveal their identity in such auctions. Not only did their name not mean anything, they were easily targeted by the rest of the anonymous crowd.\"You dare?! Reveal your identity, and I'll\u2014\"\"Are you an idiot? \u00a0Of course I'm not telling you that! Now, if you're not going to keep bidding, why don't you shut up?\"Sun Mu was so enraged he could hardly speak.\"You'd better not let me find out who you are, you bastard! I'll bid 2.5 million!\"\"Ha! 2.6 million!\"The hunter seemed more invested in enraging Sun Mu than winning the auction.Sun Mu clearly didn't expect the other hunter to keep outbidding him. 2.5 million was as high as he could go, and all he could do was stare at the offending party in resentful anger. 2.6 million was already a high price for such a technique, especially given the relatively nameless auction.There were perhaps a few rich hunters scattered throughout the attendees, but no one present was spectacularly rich. Even those who had sufficiently many points to bid had to think carefully about whether it was worth it.\"Three million!\"Just as the crowd thought that the nameless bidder was about to obtain the water-attuned technique for 2.6 million, the blue-clad hunter sitting in the first row, who had initially claimed to want to buy a technique for his sister, made a new bid.Increasing the bid by 400,000 at this juncture was a ploy to deter others from bidding, but it also showed how invested he was in it.Three million points was worth 300 million dollars on Earth. Given how impactful genetic techniques were, however, 300 million dollars wasn't too extreme a price to pay for additional power. Even a billion dollars wouldn't be too pricey for a mythic-grade technique of particular compatibility.However, the problem was that no hunter could be certain that any given technique would be so compatible with their framework. Furthermore, water-attuned frameworks were a relative rarity, so there were few hunters for whom it would be useful in the first place.A hush descended on the crowd: the bidding seemed to have come to a close.Just then, as everyone thought that the auction was over, Zhang Lie raised his hand. \"Four million points!\"Everyone turned to look at him, but all they saw was a hooded robe.The blue-clad man scowled, mumbling, \"Is there a need to act so mysteriously? What an annoyance!\"Zhang Lie smiled and bowed in his direction.Four million points\u2014an increment of a million over the last bid\u2014was about as high as the price of this technique could feasibly go. Other potential bidders had given up at three million, and a bid of four million was sufficient to silence them.Even Daffodil only waited for a few seconds of silence from the crowd before rapping her knuckles on the table again. \"The winning bid is four million points! \u00a0[The Boundless Blade] goes to the man in black!\"Zhang Lie couldn't help but smile. After all, four million points was as high as he could go. If someone were to continue bidding, Zhang Lie would have been able to match that bid, but he would have to mortgage some of his fire-attuned techniques to do so.He sighed as he swiped the four million points on his card away\u2014he had acquired such wealth just a few days ago, and here he was spending it all already. Zhang Lie was again all but penniless.But it was a worthwhile investment, after all, and he was eagerly anticipating [The Boundless Blade]. Just as before, the technique arrived in his room within half a minute.After the auction was over, Zhang Lie waited by his seat until the other hunters left. Naturally, Daffodil took notice of him. Once everyone else was gone, she closed the virtual auction hall and set up a personalized meeting room instead.\"Congratulations on becoming the thirtieth million-class customer of the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion! May I help you with anything?\"Zhang Lie could hear faint notes of happiness in her voice from the magnitude of her sales today.\"I do have two questions. First, could you tell me about the origin of this technique? I would hate to have to hide it from the public eye after learning it! Second, does your establishment also offer acquisition-related services?\"Upon hearing Zhang Lie's two questions, Daffodil smiled. \"I can assure you that this technique was acquired through a reputable source. No one\u2014neither in the dimensional world nor in reality\u2014will give you any trouble with regards to this technique. In fact, it was a recent find by one of our employees, and it's never been revealed to the public before.\"Zhang Lie immediately relaxed.\"As for your second question, given your status as an honored million-class customer here with us at the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion, your needs are our needs. We will do everything we can to satisfy your requests.\"Zhang Lie had to admit that Daffodil was very skilled at customer service.\"In that case, I have to praise your dedication to your customers.\"He visualized a list of herbal ingredients that he needed for one potion or another, actualized it in the virtual space, and then handed it to Daffodil. The list detailed the quantity and purchase price that Zhang Lie was willing to accept for each ingredient.Daffodil scanned the list, then bowed in Zhang Lie's direction. \"I've received your request, and will contact you as soon as I acquire the listed ingredients. Might I ask how I should address you, honored customer?\"Zhang Lie smiled. \"You can call me Peppercorn!\"\"Very good, Mr. Peppercorn. On behalf of the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion, I thank you for your support, and I wish you luck with mastering your new techniques.\"After the exchange, Zhang Lie left the virtual space.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: Tragic EndingIn truth, Zhang Lie didn't regret his purchases at all. He would always be able to amass more points, and he had all sorts of resources with which to do so. Furthermore, a compatible framework or technique would boost his personal strength by several times, and Zhang Lie had found himself enthralled by both techniques.He hurriedly flipped the manuals open and began to study the techniques in earnest.Even small inns boasted rooms with environment-modification capabilities, let alone a VIP suite in the best inn in the Blacksteel settlement.Over the next three days, Zhang Lie dedicated his entire attention to learning the two techniques. He was as dedicated as a high-school student cramming for the gaokao.And while he might have been able to focus on his techniques in peace, the six clans of the Blacksteel settlement and the Wang clan could not.The Wang clan had tried all sorts of tactics to vindicate themselves, but Wang Xiaohua's sudden disappearance meant that it was all but impossible for them to do so. After all, Zhang Lie's cunning trap had doomed them to ruin the moment Wang Xiaohua returned to the Blacksteel settlement with him.After five days, not only did they fail to clear their name, they had even given the six clans the mistaken interpretation that the Wang clan was planning another attack against them. As a result, they imposed even harsher sanctions against the Wang clan.The Wang clan's financial losses had, by that point, broken past tens of billions of dollars.Not only that, the supervisory position on the interstellar hub situated on the planet Nolan, which the Wang clan had been eyeing, was suddenly filled by another candidate on the strongest recommendation from the six clans.This wasn't something money alone could resolve: the Wang clan had been planning to fill this position with a trusted clan member for three whole years, but right as they were about to succeed, the six clans had ruined their plan!The Wang clan had no choice but to concede the matter. In the end, Wang Jianxin stepped forward and bore full responsibility for what had happened, and he willingly accepted expulsion to the planet Chaos.Chaos was where criminals were sent to bear their sentences, with a harsh environment and even harsher inhabitants. Most sent there perished, and none had a chance of returning to Earth ever again.Furthermore, the Wang clan compensated and apologized to the six clans individually, temporarily stabilizing the situation.That Wang Jianxin had taken full responsibility meant that the Wang clan was now enemies with the Qin and Zhou clans. Even though the two clans had stopped retaliating at the Wang clan for this supposed crime, there would be no goodwill between them were their hunters to meet in the dimensional world or on Earth.This unexpected disaster had ruined any hope of the Wang clan expanding its influence further in the short term\u2014and the instigator of this entire affair was just a nameless hunter called Zhang Lie!No matter how furious they were, there was simply nothing that they could do against Zhang Lie at the moment. And not only were they unable to take revenge on this damned cockroach, they even had to bear the full brunt of the retaliation.Of course, the Wang clan wasn't the only victim of this affair. The Qin clan was suffering just as much; in fact, they would incur even harsher sanctions and retaliation.After all, the Wang clan wasn't directly responsible for murdering anyone. It was thus able to settle matters with monetary compensation, with a sincere apology, and with voluntary expulsion from the 'culprit', but the Qin clan had no such recourse.Because of Zhang Lie's anonymous article, Qin Xiao had become the prime suspect for the murder of Zhou Qian. Yun Bing and Chu Feng had both testified to their innocence, and the Zhou clan had learned the entire truth.In that sort of situation, if not for Qin Xiao's selfishness, Zhou Qian wouldn't have died, and he wouldn't have needed to die. As a result, Qin Xiao, along with the entire Qin clan, became a target of loathing.Since the Qin clan wasn't willing to hand over Qin Xiao, the five clans\u2014the Yun and Chu, along with the three great corporations\u2014launched a punitive attack against the Qin clan.More precisely, they began targeting hunters from the Qin clan in the dimensional world. In just two days, half of the Qin scions in the Blacksteel settlement were wounded or even dead, and the Qin clan lost much of its influence.As for Qin Xiao, he had cloistered himself within the main household, not even daring to step outside.Even so, the five clans' retaliation wasn't over.The three corporations aggressively began to take over the markets in which the Qin clan operated, as though they were planning to crush the Qin clan into oblivion.And while the Yun and Chu clans might have turned a blind eye, Qin Xiao's attempt to implicate Yun Bing and Chu Feng had severely offended both clans. As a result, they too began to pressure the Qin clan.Faced with an assault on five fronts, the head of the Qin clan began to panic. As the head, he couldn't sacrifice the entire clan's wellbeing just for his son's life.On the top floor of a certain skyscraper in the city of Liao, the elders and heads of each branch of the Qin clan sat in urgent deliberation.\"Head, you have to make a move! If not, the Qin clan will perish!\"Qin Zongming's face was stormy. \"A move? What move should I make? Shall I sacrifice my son to quell their anger? Who's to say that they'll calm down just because they have my son? And even if they do, will we even have any pride left over? How can we maintain control of Liao if we're willing to roll over on the other five clans' command?\"Qin Zongming's words caused an elder seated to his left to start laughing. \"In that case, Head, shall we expend all our resources and fight to the death with these five clans? The Zhou clan has good reason to suspect Qin Xiao as the culprit of Zhou Qian's murder, and we can't shield him forever!\"Now that the five clans are cooperating to crush us, Head, there's no chance that we'll be able to fight back. Give up on protecting your son! Reputation this, reputation that\u2014what reputation can we maintain when our clan's being smothered to death?!\"Qin Zongming had no refutation for the accusations being leveled at him. The elder wasn't wrong: if the clan were to fall, no amount of reputation would do them any good.However, Qin Xiao was his only son! If he were to hand him to the five clans, wouldn't it be equivalent to sentencing him to death? How could he bear to do that to his only son? But if he didn't, the Qin clan would be destroyed...He might be willing to accept such an outcome, but the rest of the clan certainly could not.Another elder spoke up. \"Head, you need to be decisive! The Yun and Chu clans alone would be enough to destroy us, but they're even working in tandem with the three corporations! As the head of the clan, are you really going to ruin us all just for your son?!\"We've already demonstrated our resilience by protecting Qin Xiao as long as we did, but to shield him further would be the greatest of follies! Head, your decision now will alter our clan's fate! I implore you, think of the big picture!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: Cast Adrift\"Don't force me to make a decision now! Let's wait a little while longer.\" Qin Zongming was forced to make a bitter choice: one option led to grief, and the other to sorrow. How was he to choose between son and clan? How?\"Head, time's the one thing we lack most! Please make a decision immediately!\"\"Your waiting now could well lead the Qin family into ruin!\"Qin Zongming's response clearly wasn't what the elders wanted to hear, and they began to pressure him again. Everyone gathered at the meeting looked toward him, and Qin Zongming could sense the resolve in their eyes.If he weren't able to resolve this matter immediately, it looked as though his time as clan head would be up. He didn't care whether or not he was the clan head, but if he stepped down, Qin Xiao would be in even more perilous a state.His replacement would surely send Qin Xiao trussed up for slaughter.\"Alright, I've made up my mind! My only son, Qin Xiao, has committed a terrible sin. For this crime, I hereby declare that he shall be stripped of all duties and obligations to the clan of Qin and expelled from the clan. His life and death shall no longer be the clan's concern!\"Qin Zongming's face flushed red upon making this declaration, red with anger, red with shame. After all, removing the clan's protection from him would undoubtedly send him out of the frying pan and into the fire. But what else could he do? There was at least still a slim chance of survival if he were expelled, and no chance at all if he remained within the clan.All he could hope for now was that Qin Xiao was wily enough to escape with his life amidst this disaster.\"Head, if you do this\u2014\"\"I am the family head, and I've made up my mind!\" Qin Zongming roared. Despite his compromise, the elders of the Qin family still weren't fully satisfied. However, Qin Zongming still held the authority of the clan head, and he interrupted the elder before he could finish speaking.\"This punishment, as well as some monetary compensation, will be sufficient to repair our relationship with the Yun and Chu families. The three corporations don't have much power or authority of their own, and now that they've tasted a few benefits at our expense, they should know better than to push this matter further.\"My expelling Qin Xiao from our clan allows them to target Qin Xiao at will: the fault was his, not our clan's! If they want revenge, they should seek it out from him.\"Furthermore, from now on, I expect all of you to enforce surveillance on the Wang family. The reason for our losses is all because of that wench from the Wang family, and we'll settle this debt sooner or later!\"Qin Zongming's words thundered through the conference room. No one dared speak up against him now.\"In that case, since there aren't any further comments, the matter is settled! Spread the news that Qin Xiao fled to avoid punishment from the clan, and that he was expelled as a result. This meeting is over!\"Qin Zongming was the first to walk out of the conference room.In the Renji Hospital in Liao, Qin Xiao, who was resting in a ward, suddenly received a message from his wristwatch.\"Flee!\" As Qin Xiao opened it, a familiar voice entered his ears.The next moment, Qin Xiao received the news that his point cards had been frozen, and that he had been expelled from the Qin clan. In a matter of moments, Qin Xiao had nothing to his name!It was only then that Qin Xiao began to treat this matter seriously.Expulsion from the Qin clan? How could this be? He was the only son of Qin Zongming, the clan head! How would his father bear to expel him from the clan? Who was going to take over the leadership of the Qin family now that he was gone?That audio message instructing him to flee sounded like his father...He replayed the message. There could be no doubt: the message really was from Qin Zongming! That message had been sent from an anonymous sender, which meant that his father couldn't contact him openly.Qin Xiao got up and drew the curtains in his suite to see several vehicles owned by the three corporations heading toward the hospital.He had no choice but to confront the likely truth. Although he had heard a few rumors during his stay at the hospital, he'd believed that his father would have been able to protect him. But five days later, he'd found himself unceremoniously kicked out of the clan.He was certain that his father was under tremendous pressure to do so, but he was still quite aggrieved\u2014not toward his father, of course, but the clan elders. His reputation in the Blacksteel settlement for the last two years had brought a great many benefits for his clan, but the moment something like this happened, those elders had discarded him immediately!But no matter how he felt about the clan, he had no choice but to flee, dragging his bandaged, recently operated-on hand behind him.Qin Xiao wasn't a fool. He knew that the blame for Zhou Qian's death could be placed squarely on him. And he knew what the consequences would be if he were to be caught by the three corporations after the Qin clan's protection was revoked.With his disappearance, the affair of the venombane glade drew to a close.All six families of the Blacksteel settlement had found themselves wearied\u2014if not worse\u2014by the whole mess. Even the Yun and Chu families, which had done the best among the six, were getting tired of sending all their hunters out to fight.However, they had gained quite a fair bit of profit from their efforts, both on Earth and in the dimensional world, and they couldn't much blame Zhang Lie for treating them as pawns in his game. As for the three great corporations, with the notable exception of the Zhou family, they had all made some profit as well.However, the Qin family had lost much of its reputation and prestige in the Blacksteel settlement, and it seemed as though the six great families would soon become five.Of course, the one true winner was Zhang Lie.He had crippled both the Wang and Qin families in one devastating blow. Qin Xiaotian was dead, Wang Jianxin had been sent to Chaos, and Wang Xiaohua and Qin Xiao were left to fend for themselves against those hunting them down. He had soured the relationships between the families, and in doing so, had even extricated himself from any blame.In Zhang Lie's suite in the Blackgold Inn, a light clap from Zhang Lie's palm, sending ripples of genetic energy out from the point of impact, caused a crack in a massive steel shield. As the ripples grew more intense, the crack propagated, and the steel soon fell apart into a heap of scrap metal within his virtual training environment.Given Zhang Lie's past experience with genetic techniques, he had achieved some success with the pinnacle-grade [Fists of the Silent Sea] in five exhausting days of effort. As he had anticipated, this technique was particularly compatible with him, and Zhang Lie couldn't have been more pleased with his purchase.Next, he summoned Venombane and began to practice [The Boundless Blade].Zhang Lie had been a swordmaster in his past life, and as a sword technique, [The Boundless Blade] should have been easier for him to pick up. The challenge of that technique, and what gave it its mythic-grade designation, was authority.A hundred masters of [The Boundless Blade] would generate a hundred variants of the technique. Even if the bladework were essentially identical, each master would invoke the authority of the boundless ocean in a different manner, and this difference would subtly affect the technique.It was this feature of mythic-grade techniques that made them so challenging to learn.Zhang Lie had spent much of the last five days dedicated to this problem. With his past life and present dedication, with his large supply and masterful control of genetic energy, on the fifth day, Zhang Lie had managed to assimilate his unusual genetic core with the technique, coming up with a version of the technique that was uniquely his.His version boasted a gigantic fish swimming in the ocean of genetic energy that served as the technique's backdrop. The ocean, which had felt somewhat lifeless during the robotic demonstration at the auction, seemed to have gained a measure of subtlety and mystery upon the fish's inclusion.Zhang Lie charged up a blow, then released that energy with a light swing of his shortsword. As the blade struck its target, the fish leapt up from behind him, bringing the ocean's boundless strength to bear.The force of the technique leveled a small hill into flat terrain.Zhang Lie exhaled deeply, then left the virtual environment, a hint of exhaustion in his features. The strength of [The Boundless Blade] left nothing to be desired, but it also drained him of much of his energy. He would have to save it for a killing blow; his stamina simply couldn't keep up with using it as a regular attack for the moment.Thus ended Zhang Lie's practice regimen. Both the [Fists of the Silent Sea] and [The Boundless Blade] were multi-target techniques, and Zhang Lie had certainly managed to shore up his deficiencies.Furthermore, his ceaseless practice and increase to his gene fragments had caused his [Ninecarp Transformation] to enter late first-stage. His supply of genetic energy had increased yet again, and the pale pink carp in his genetic core was now so detailed that it looked to be alive.Zhang Lie's stats had also undergone a massive transformation.Zhang Lie: a mortal lifeformFramework: Foundation, Lv. MAX, Ninecarp Transformation, First Form: CarpTechniques: Rippling Walk (novice), Three-Wave Crescendo (novice), Calm Waters (novice), Fists of the Silent Sea (novice), The Boundless Blade (novice)Genes: Basic, 140; Mutated, 100; Superior, 19Soulshards: White Grub (superior), Galewolf (mutated), Blood Ant (mutated), Potbellied Toad (mutated), Venombane Scorpion (superior)He possessed two particularly strong superior-grade soulshards and an assortment of genetic techniques, the lowest of which was high-grade. The difference between the Zhang Lie of a few months hence and the Zhang Lie of the present was as heaven and earth.Given just his gene fragments, soulshards, and techniques, he would have been 53rd on the gene leaderboard despite having no recorded fights to his name\u2014and his growth-type framework was still only equivalent to a mortal-grade one at present.Of course, Zhang Lie didn't care about this ranking. He had no intention of publicizing his strength, and indeed he had removed himself from the leaderboard months ago. Otherwise, news of his sudden growth would likely have spread throughout the settlement.After packing everything up, Zhang Lie was finally ready to head out of the settlement once again. His next goal was to hunt down more superior-grade lifeforms, as well as to gather the remaining required ingredients for his Potion #2.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Basic Gene CapacityNow that Zhang Lie was lacking for points again, he intended to sell a piece of information and deal with a set of his stockpiled goods. Thus, when he left the inn, instead of rushing out of the settlement, he lounged near the gates while paying attention to the hunters entering and leaving.Only when he saw a certain female with her team did he follow them out of the settlement. Once they were out of earshot from any random passersby, he exclaimed in theatrical surprise, \"What? How did I manage to achieve a breakthrough with my foundational framework?\"He wasn't speaking very loudly, but the shock and surprise in his voice caused the female and her teammates to glance toward him out of the corner of their eyes. Several of the hunters immediately narrowed their eyes in disdain: after all, they were long past the stage where they had to care about their foundational framework.However, the female leader seemed to be somewhat interested in the news. \"What do you mean by a breakthrough? Surely you haven't managed to go past the tenth stage?\"Zhang Lie panicked and stuttered, \"N-No! I must have made a mistake!\" His hands shook as he turned rigidly and strode quickly back into the settlement.The female hunter seemed even more interested after this turn of events. She stopped walking and, amidst her teammates' confusion, followed Zhang Lie back into the settlement.Beneath his black cloak, Zhang Lie was smiling deviously, but he pretended to be even more panicked when he noticed that the female hunter had followed him back into the settlement. Not knowing what to do, he furiously dashed away.The female hunter's curiosity was well and truly piqued: what on Earth had happened to this mysterious hunter in black? She chased him into an alley in the Blacksteel settlement.When Zhang Lie found that he had stumbled into a dead end, he screamed like a little girl. \"We're inside the settlement! You'd better not do anything to me!\"The female hunter scoffed. \"And what do you think I'd do to you? I'm sure you know why I've been chasing you. Don't worry, we hunters of the Chu clan never bully the weak, and I, Chu Lan, would certainly never do something so demeaning. Tell me about the foundational framework. If I think your information is valuable, I'll pay you points in compensation. What do you think?\"Chu Lan's face was intent but not unkind, and Zhang Lie knew that he'd picked the right person for this. Of course, he couldn't drop the act now. He shivered and asked, in an exaggerated tone, \"Really? Will you really give me points? How many?\"\"Well, it'll depend on the value of your information, of course!\" Chu Lan replied.Zhang Lie's face fell. \"In that case, isn't it only worth as much as you want to pay me?\"\"As I've said, don't worry. Don't you know how honorable Chu hunters are? I can afford to pay you for the information.\" Chu Lan repeated her guarantee, but Zhang Lie refused to believe her.\"How insincere you are! This information is worth at least five million points, and it's not something I can reveal so easily!\"Upon hearing Zhang Lie's words, one of Chu Lan's teammates, who had followed her back into the settlement, nudged her. \"Chu Lan, isn't this fellow a fool? Five million points? You must be crazy! Do you know how much money that's worth? Half a billion dollars! What information could you possibly have that's worth that much?!Zhang Lie glanced scornfully at the hunter who had spoken, then laughed. \"And if I were to say that it's about a breakthrough in your foundational framework that will raise your basic gene capacity?\"Chu Lan gaped. Was it really possible to increase one's gene capacity?! No, there was no way that could be true! And yet the possibility continued to entice her. It was common sense to think that the capacity was fixed at a hundred for every hunter, but\u2026 what if the information really were true? This sort of information could really be worth half a billion dollars!After all, upon advancing to the second realm, a hunter's gene fragments would determine their potential going forward. As a result, the most dedicated hunters would hunt for enough basic, mutated, and superior gene fragments to reach the capacity for all three before advancing to the second realm. The stronger a hunter's foundation, the further they would be able to go.For instance, quite a few pinnacle- and higher-grade techniques required a certain baseline number of gene fragments to study and use.If this mysterious man truly did possess information that would allow hunters to raise their gene capacities, then half a billion would be a bargain. After all, this would mean that all the hunters from her clan would have an advantage over all other hunters.Chu Lan, who had a relatively high position within the Chu clan, could hardly resist such temptation. \"Are you sure you're telling the truth?\" she asked.Zhang Lie laughed again. \"You think I'm lying? Well, then, I suppose I'll just have to work with another group of hunters instead!\"\"Ah, no, wait! We were the first group to talk to you, weren't we? Furthermore, if your information is reliable, then the Chu clan would certainly be willing to pay you more for your trouble. Please, give me a moment. I'll inform the young master about this now, and he'll be personally meeting with you about this transaction. I promise you, the Chu clan will give you a fair price for this information!\"Chu Lan's excitement had spread throughout her body. If this were true, and if they were able to negotiate a deal, then the entire Chu clan would benefit greatly. After contacting Chu Feng, they quickly worked out a meeting place.Unexpectedly, however, Yun Bing was near the scene, and when she overheard the commotion, she insisted on being part of the negotiations. As a result, the two-party discussion now became a three-party one.Chu Feng had arranged the meeting at a tavern owned by the Chu clan, in one of the private meeting rooms upstairs. Zhang Lie, Chu Feng, Yun Bing, Chu Lan, and Yun Gang sat facing each other.Zhang Lie stared at Yun Bing, not having anticipated this turn of events. The other four hunters were all staring at the mysterious Zhang Lie.Chu Feng, as the host, was the first to speak up. \"Would you be willing to take off your hood now, since there are no outsiders around?\"Zhang Lie immediately shook his head. \"No, I can't! You're all from large clans, aren't you? What if you renege on your word before we finish the transaction? What's more, there's no need for me to reveal my identity in this process, is there?\"Seeing how careful Zhang Lie was to keep his identity a secret, the other hunters all felt more confident about the veracity of his information.After all, to them, the very idea of being able to raise their gene capacity was nothing more than a dream. However, for some reason, upon seeing how careful this hunter was acting, they couldn't help but believe his claims.Yun Bing even chuckled. \"I have to admit that you've gotten me even more curious. How would you like to carry out the exchange?\"He thought for a few moments. \"I'll answer three questions about raising one's gene capacity. As long as they don't reveal too much about the secret, I'll answer truthfully. Then, if you're still interested, you can choose to listen on as I explain the procedure. Of course, if you want to do this, you'll have to pay me a deposit.\"Subsequently, I'll help you carry out the process on certain hunters, so you can witness it for yourself. Once all that's over, you'll pay me the rest of the promised fee. Well? If these terms are fine with you, then let's get started.\"\"In that case, I'll ask the first question! By how much can you raise your basic gene capacity following this method?\" Chu Feng very much appreciated Zhang Lie's directness, and he immediately asked the question that was on everyone's minds: how large was the effect?After all, if this procedure would only raise it by a small fraction, then was it really worth half a billion dollars?Zhang Lie, having anticipated this question, immediately answered, \"Ten fragments. After a breakthrough with your foundational framework, your basic gene capacity will increase by ten. However, these additional ten fragments will provide a greater benefit than even ten mutated gene fragments! Do you all understand what this means?\"The gathered hunters were silent. Ten fragments, only ten fragments, but the fact that these ten fragments were in excess of the usual capacity would cause them to augment a hunter's constitution by more than even ten mutated gene fragments would!Imagine having ten more mutated gene fragments than your opponent! Unbelievable!Ten basic gene fragments didn't do much for a hunter's fighting ability, but ten mutated gene fragments gave a noticeable boost, one visible with the naked eye. Every edge mattered, and this advantage could well be decisive.All four hunters present from the Chu and Yun clans had only one thing on their mind: they had to obtain this information, even if it cost them a billion dollars! It would have severe implications for not just the Yun and Chu clans, but even for the entire world federation and Earth as a whole.After more than a dozen seconds of stunned silence as the hunters processed this information, they all looked toward Zhang Lie with ardor in their gaze.Yun Bing was the first to speak. \"No wonder you claim that this information is worth more than half a billion dollars. If this really were true, then we would certainly all benefit greatly. But surely there must be some restriction or requirement for this breakthrough? My question is to know what those requirements or restrictions are.\"FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: Making Preparations\"There are certainly requirements that you have to meet, but I won't be able to reveal them fully without providing too much information. However, I can inform you that none of you present can experience a breakthrough as you are now: once you study any genetic technique, you can no longer advance beyond the tenth stage of your foundational framework. As a result, none of you will be able to test this procedure on yourself.\"Zhang Lie's words again caused the hunters to stiffen. Yun Bing, Chu Feng, Yun Gang, and Chu Lan all looked at him in shock. In that case, all their excitement would be for naught!Yun Gang narrowed his eyes in thought. \"In that case, what if I were to purge my techniques? \u00a0Would I be able to break through then?\"Zhang Lie nodded. \"That would work, but I'm sure this would be a difficult decision for hunters like you.\"Indeed, it was an extremely difficult decision to make. The gathered hunters would be able to raise their gene capacity, but only after sacrificing the techniques that they'd spent years working with...In the long term, it would certainly be better to purge one's techniques, but doing so would cause their growth to deteriorate in the short term. This was truly a dilemma.The four hunters all began to frown. Moments later, Chu Lan, the only hunter who had yet to speak, came to her senses and asked the last question.\"What's the chance of success upon undergoing this procedure? I want to know whether it's guaranteed that we'll be able to experience a breakthrough if we follow the information you're providing.\"The other three hunters all broke out of their reverie and turned to Zhang Lie.\"I can't guarantee anything: after all, I can only speak for myself. All I can provide is an explanation of the circumstances under which I experienced a breakthrough, as well as a positive confirmation of such a breakthrough. I can't promise any measure of success.\"Zhang Lie's words caused the hunters to deflate.If there were an unknown probability of success, then they wouldn't risk jeopardizing their strength, especially not right before the Void Cup. What would they do if the procedure didn't work for them?Yun Bing, Chu Feng, and the others had gotten a good grasp as to what this mysterious hunter's breakthrough implied. Although they wouldn't be able to benefit much from it, it would be extremely meaningful for their clans. It was certainly a piece of information worth half a billion dollars\u2014no, perhaps even more than that.Chu Feng murmured, \"I have to say, this revelation is both astounding and saddening to me. Of course, from the perspective of our clans, we're certainly very interested in the details of the procedure. What do you propose with regards to payment?\"Zhang Lie rubbed his fingers together. \"Simply pay up, and I'll keep talking. Since there are two clans involved, how about 1.5 million points from each clan as a deposit?\"1.5 million points would be a 30% deposit, which seemed rather high.Yun Bing and Chu Feng eyed each other, but neither objected.\"A 30% deposit isn't unfair, but how would you guarant\u2014\"\"There's no need for a guarantee. After you hand over your deposit, I won't leave your sight until the first successful breakthrough among each of your candidates.\" Zhang Lie predicted and resolved Yun Bing's objection, and his proposal was acceptable to her.The two clan representatives both transferred 1.5 million points to Zhang Lie, and he immediately received a notification of that transfer.\"Very good. In that case, let's begin. Each clan should prepare five candidates whose foundational frameworks are at the tenth stage, but who haven't yet begun cultivating any genetic techniques.\"Furthermore, you'll need to gather a hundred white-grub cores, ten pounds of kelpfish roe, and ten pounds of bluewater frog meat. Are there any questions so far?\"Seeing how Zhang Lie had immediately gotten down to business, Yun Bing and Chu Feng motioned for Chu Lan and Yun Gang to handle the preparations themselves.Chu Lan and Yun Gang immediately stood up and made to leave.\"Lastly, construct a small training ground outside the settlement, and bring both the candidates and the ingredients there,\" Zhang Lie added, before Chu Lan and Yun Gang left.That remark caused the four hunters to look askance at him again.Outside the settlement? That meant that they would all have to leave the safety of the settlement grounds. And that meant that he, a lone hunter, had the confidence to take on their clans...Zhang Lie didn't notice anything amiss with his words. When he saw the gathered hunters hesitate, he asked, \"What's the matter? Don't you want to get things started as quickly as possible?\"Yun Gang and Chu Lan bowed and left.Almost without stopping, Zhang Lie turned back to Yun Bing and Chu Feng and started to describe the conditions for the breakthrough.\"There are three conditions to keep in mind. The first and most basic requirement is to reach the tenth stage of the foundational framework without having started practicing any genetic techniques.\"The second is to consume sufficient quantities of white-grub cores, kelpfish roe, or bluewater frog meat. I'm not sure about which is the active ingredient here, but all three are easy to acquire in bulk, so this shouldn't be a problem.\"The third is to have enough adrenaline flooding your system; in other words, the candidates need to experience some form of shock or threat.\"Zhang Lie stopped talking, but Yun Bing and Chu Feng continued looking at him expectantly. After a moment, they asked, almost simultaneously, \"Is that it?\"\"Were you expecting it to be even more difficult? After all, none of these three requirements are easy to meet, and certainly not all three at once. Indeed, the last requirement is the only one that introduces uncertainty into this process. Whether or not a hunter will succeed in breaking through will depend on this third requirement.\"Since they had paid, Zhang Lie had no reason to hide what he had gleaned from them.Yun Bing and Chu Feng now understood the risks and benefits of this supposed breakthrough better. In simple terms, it was a low-risk, high-reward procedure for hunters who had just entered the dimensional world.Having missed this opportunity themselves, Yun Bing and Chu Feng were naturally thinking of trying to get their relatives to benefit instead. Yun Bing had a sister, and Chu Feng had a pair of siblings, and these three hunters were all relatively new to the dimensional world.In particular, Yun Bing's sister, Yun Meng, was precisely at the critical juncture for the first requirement, and while Chu Feng's siblings had progressed slightly beyond that, they didn't have much to lose from starting over.They would surely benefit from this opportunity.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: The Training BeginsTo the south of the Blacksteel settlement was a strange forest densely populated with blue maple trees. All sorts of lifeforms lived in this curious habitat, and most hunters didn't dare to get anywhere close to the area.Somewhere by the outskirts of the forest, on a plot of barren ground, an encampment consisting of a few tents had been hastily constructed. Of course, this was where the Yun and Chu clans had decided to construct a temporary training ground following Zhang Lie's request.Both clans had supplied considerable manpower for this project, and by the time Zhang Lie, Chu Feng, and Yun Bing arrived at the area, it was already filled with hundreds of Yun and Chu elites.In the tent in the very center were ten youths. The oldest among them seemed to be less than twenty years of age, and all of them had only been in the dimensional world for less than a month. \u00a0Most importantly, they were all at the tenth stage of their foundational framework, and had either yet to start studying any genetic techniques or had purged them from their framework decisively.Among them were Yun Bing's sister, Yun Meng, as well as Chu Feng's brother, Chu Leng. Chu Feng's sister, Chu Xun, was also present, but she refused to believe in this so-called breakthrough. As a result, she stood to the side of the main ten-hunter party, rather than with them.When the three of them walked up, however, she immediately strode forward and began to sniff them.\"Brother, is this the mysterious hunter you were talking about? He seems like a mysterious fellow, but he doesn't smell too old. He's in his early twenties, I'm sure of it! And he must recently have been in the Blackgold Inn, because I can smell the perfume that their female servants use! Are you sure he's not a fraud?\"The girl's words shocked Zhang Lie. How could she be able to tell how old he was with just a casual sniff? And to think that she would even be able to identify where he had been!Was her nose really that sharp? Zhang Lie glanced at her with shining eyes.Chu Feng laughed in embarrassment. \"This is my sister. Please don't mind her, she's been coddled since she was young, so...\"\"Haha, I don't mind! How astute her sense of smell must be!\"He then spoke to Chu Xun directly. \"It seems like you don't believe in the breakthrough I've discovered?\"Chu Xun shook her head. \"It's been just about a century since the dimensional world was first discovered. How can something like this breakthrough not have been found even after so long?\"\"In that case, shall we have a bet?\"Chu Xun frowned, then asked cautiously, \"A bet? Why should I make a bet with you?\"Zhang Lie smiled. \"You don't believe in my breakthrough, do you? In that case, let's bet the following: if I were to successfully induce a breakthrough in at least one person here, you'll have to help me sniff something out, but if I fail, then you can do whatever you want with me! What do you think?\"Chu Xun thought about the terms for a moment and then decisively shook her head. \"No, I won't take this bet! If you were to lose, then my brother would destroy you anyway!\"Zhang Lie raised an eyebrow, not expecting that she would be so quick-witted. \"In that case, let's do it this way. If you agree to help me sniff something out, I'll guarantee you a successful breakthrough. How about that?\"Yun Bing, Chu Feng, and the elites of the two clans all perked up. This fellow had said that he couldn't guarantee any measure of success! But now that he was interested in Chu Xun's nose, he had made her this guarantee...It was likely that he had deliberately sought out the Yun and Chu clans for this venture as well, and it was very likely that there was still some critical piece of information regarding the breakthrough process that he hadn't divulged.\"Promise him!\" Chu Feng nudged her.As if sensing how serious her brother was, Chu Xun frowned and reluctantly said, \"Fine. I wasn't going to accept the bet, but given my brother's request, I'll reluctantly go along with it. However, I'm telling you now: I won't sniff anything funny from you!\"Zhang Lie laughed. \"Don't worry, Miss Chu, I have better uses for your talents.\"Only after settling the agreement with Chu Xun did Zhang Lie turn to look at the ten gathered candidates. In front of each candidate was a pile of food. There were ten white-grub cores, half a pound of kelpfish roe, and half a pound of bluewater frog meat.Of course, except for the white-grub cores, everything else was cooked.Zhang Lie was very pleased by the clans' efficacy. Loudly, he proclaimed, \"I believe all of you know the reason you were gathered here today! Your first task is simple: devour all the food in front of you!\"The candidates blinked, then turned skeptically to Yun Bing and Chu Feng.After all, Zhang Lie, clad entirely in black, did not seem remotely like a trustworthy figure.Yun Bing's sister, Yun Meng, even asked, \"Sister, there's nothing special about any of this, so why are we consuming it? Isn't it just like junk food?\"Yun Bing grimaced. \"Yun Meng, listen to him! You'll understand what it does in just a bit. You might not believe him, but you'll believe your sister, won't you?\"Yun Bing's admonishment and endorsement finally made the other candidates follow suit.The food didn't taste too bad, but there was just so much of it\u2026 well, it wasn't as though they had any choice.The moment several of the candidates finished eating everything, Zhang Lie had the Yun and Chu elites bring them into the training ground.What awaited them would be a moment of life-threatening danger. Black-clad elites were already waiting in preparation surrounding the training ground.The six candidates who had finished eating first entered through six separate entrances. Those hunters who led them there informed them that their goal was to reach the heart of the training ground. The first hunter to get there would be the first to experience a breakthrough, so the six candidates began rushing toward the center of the training ground immediately.Chu Xiu was a little nervous: as a member of a branch family of the Chu clan, he was honored to have been selected for such important training. After all, he had been told that this supposed breakthrough would be a tremendous boon to both him and the clan at large.Grateful for the opportunity, he promised to give the training his all. His skills were above average among the six candidates, so he was the first to reach the interior boundary.As he darted by a small bush, Chu Xiu could see the flag planted at the center of the training ground. Just then, a dark shadow far faster than he was shot out of the bush, and a dagger flashed toward his jugular.Adrenaline flooded Chu Xiu's body, and he reacted near-instinctively. He had no time to process why or how an assassin had managed to infiltrate this place. As genetic energy burst out of his body, he twisted his body just enough to avoid the blow.It was at that moment that the will of the world spoke to him.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: Yun Bing's ProbingWith this announcement, Chu Xiu's basic gene capacity increased by ten.A breakthrough! The breakthrough really did happen!\u00a0But before Chu Xiu could react, the assassin that had struck him bound him and took him away. Despite his breakthrough, Chu Xiu simply couldn't do anything against him. The power disparity was simply too large.If not for the fact that the assassin was going easy on him, Chu Xiu would be dead by now.The elite 'assassins' were all clan hunters who had reached their mutated gene capacity and had developed their genetic techniques to a considerable extent. They were naturally capable of handling rookies like Chu Xiu.They were instructed to do what they did for one purpose only: to have these rookies experience a chilling life-or-death situation. They didn't know\u2014and didn't need to know\u2014the reason why.Following Chu Xiu, the other five hunters also each barely evaded a killing blow, but unfortunately, except for one hunter from the Yun clan who had broken through like Chu Xiu, none of the remaining four did.After approximately five minutes, when they all walked out of the training ground, Yun Bing and Chu Feng both glanced at them anxiously. By their side, Zhang Lie smiled, perfectly confident.\"Young Master, it worked! Chu Xiu managed to achieve a breakthrough!\" Chu Lan exclaimed exuberantly.\"Miss, our Yun Yi had a breakthrough too!\" Beside her, Yun Gang did the same, not wanting to lose out to her.Yun Bing and Chu Feng both finally relaxed.\u00a0It succeeded, it really had! This supposed breakthrough really was real!\u00a0In truth, Yun Bing and Chu Feng had both harbored some doubts about the process, because they knew just what this breakthrough would imply: the dawn of a new era, of exceeding one's base limits!They rushed up to Chu Xiu and Yun Yi, who had just broken through.\"How are you feeling now, Chu Xiu?\" Chu Feng asked.\"My supply of genetic energy has increased greatly, and all my senses and constitution have been enhanced. My body feels amazing! That master was right: the effect of the breakthrough really does feel far superior to obtaining ten more mutated gene fragments!\"Chu Xiu felt as though he was in a dream, but the changes to his body reminded him over and over again that this was all real. A breakthrough really was possible, and he had done it!And while Yun Yi, who was beside him, didn't say anything, Yun Bing was able to confirm the breakthrough with her senses and with the excitement glimmering in his eyes. Honestly, she could barely believe it herself!\"Now that they've successfully broken through, shall we settle our accounts?\" Zhang Lie's mercantile voice immediately dampened the cheery atmosphere.Chu Feng and Yun Bing both turned toward him, their eyes piercing. The effect of the breakthrough was so stunning that they were all curious about who this mysterious cloaked man really was.\"What's the matter? Don't you know it's impolite to stare?\" Zhang Lie couldn't help making a joke.\"We're outside the settlement grounds, and we now understand the breakthrough procedure. What's there to stop us from refusing you payment?\" Chu Feng responded, half-jokingly.Zhang Lie smiled. \"Don't frighten me, Young Master Chu\u2014I get scared quite easily! Of course, in that case, I wouldn't be able to get anything more from you, but what if I were to release this method to the public? In that case, it seems like you'd lose far more than I would.\"In truth, Zhang Lie wasn't afraid that the Yun and Chu clans wouldn't pay up, since he had stockpiled the bottleneck in the procedure. Following the terms of the transaction would be far more beneficial to the Yun and Chu clans than to him.Furthermore, he had already obtained three million points from them so far, and that alone was worth the trouble. If they wanted to renege on the contract, so would he.\"Oh? \u00a0But are you certain that you would be able to leave without our permission?\" Yun Bing's eyes glinted as genetic energy bubbled out of her body.Upon seeing her behavior, the Yun and Chu elites quickly gathered around them.\"Haha, Miss Yun Bing, honestly, you're a rather bad actor. Ignoring the fact that you're lacking any sign of killing intent, are you sure you'll be able to take me down? Do I look like someone who hasn't accounted for this possibility?\"Zhang Lie pulled out a black potion from his potbellied-toad pouch. The moment he did so, everyone present, including Yun Bing and Chu Feng, felt a premonition of exceeding danger.This was undoubtedly his backup plan if something were to go awry.Even without Yun Bing or Chu Feng's commands, the gathered hunters stopped trying to crowd Zhang Lie in. The unknown was the most fearsome thing of all, and the man in front of them was so mysterious that, despite Yun Bing and Chu Feng's strength, even they didn't dare step closer to him.Yun Bing immediately retracted her genetic energy, afraid that Zhang Lie would accidentally uncork the black potion in his hand.\"Alright, alright, put that away! It looks like I was right: your finding Chu Lan wasn't a coincidence at all, was it?\" Chu Feng waved his hands, indicating that his and Yun Bing's behavior was just a joke.\"Oh? \u00a0Why don't you ask this Chu Lan whether I reached out to her, or whether she refused to stop chasing me until I told her about my circumstances? Furthermore, shouldn't you be grateful for this opportunity? Isn't it in poor taste to be trying to probe me?\"Zhang Lie talked Chu Feng into stunned silence, still waving his potion bottle about.Yun Bing smiled. \"Aren't you a mysterious fellow? I must admit to some curiosity as to what's underneath that cloak.\"Zhang Lie smirked. \"You think you can handle me?\"Under ordinary circumstances, Yun Bing would have scoffed and turned away from this ribald teasing, but against Zhang Lie, she only laughed. \"Is that so? You do seem to be quite confident in your charm. In that case, why not reveal your true appearance?\"Zhang Lie clicked his tongue. \"Perhaps we can discuss that some other time, after we've finished this transaction.\"\"Indeed. I\u00a0am\u00a0quite shocked by the efficacy of this breakthrough, but it doesn't seem to have a high probability of success. Will those hunters who failed have a second chance?\" Yun Bing asked the most pressing question on everyone's minds.After all, this was what would determine whether this breakthrough could be manufactured en masse.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: Yun Clan's Wager\"Of course! There's no restriction on how many times you can try, as long as you don't start cultivating a technique in the meantime. All that matters is reaching a certain threshold density of adrenaline in your body, and you'll be able to break through! Also, from time to time, they'll have to keep supplying their body with those three foods.\"Zhang Lie's response left Yun Bing, Chu Feng, and the gathered elites relieved.Simply stated, they would remain eligible for a breakthrough as long as they replenished their body's supply of those foods and didn't cultivate any technique in the meantime. In theory, given enough preparation time, anyone should be able to break through.\"In that case, I don't have any further questions. I'll transfer the remaining portion of the points to you within the day. However, you promised my sister that you would guarantee her breakthrough, so aren't you going to wait until her trial is over?\"After receiving the answer he wanted, Chu Feng promised to pay up, and Yun Bing nodded in agreement. Of course, Zhang Lie hadn't forgotten about the bet he had made with Chu Feng's sister, Chu Xun: her nose would be very useful to him, after all.In the main tent, Yun Meng and the others, who ate relatively slowly, had finished their preparations. Because of the successful precedent, they were eagerly expectant as they walked toward the training ground.Their distrust toward Zhang Lie had now morphed into curiosity about his identity. After all, this mysterious breakthrough had originated from his hands. They were all excited for the training because they had no idea what it would entail, blissfully ignorant that what awaited them would be a trial by fire.There were four candidates remaining, and Chu Xun also joined them. Zhang Lie motioned for the five youths in front of him to get started, but when Chu Xun walked by him, Zhang Lie suddenly stepped forward and whispered in her ear.Then, before Chu Feng and the others could react, he pushed her into the training grounds.After two or three minutes, when they all came back out, Chu Xun really had managed to break through, as did Chu Leng. However, the remaining three Yun hunters, including Yun Meng, didn't succeed.Honestly, Zhang Lie was a little disappointed by this result. After all, the life-or-death situation that had been manufactured was about as close as you could get to the real thing. However, of the eleven candidates, only four had succeeded, a statistic that wasn't at all impressive.That said, this wasn't something that Zhang Lie much cared about: Chu Xun's successful breakthrough implied that he'd succeeded in his bet against her.\"Haha, Young Master Chu, Young Miss Chu, congratulations. In that case, remember to let me borrow your nose in the future!\"Chu Feng was overjoyed to have both his siblings break through, and he immediately responded with a smile. \"Of course! The Chu clan won't go back on its word. Furthermore, regardless of our arrangement, I owe you a favor on behalf of the Chu clan.\"\"In that case, I'll accept it with gratitude.\" Zhang Lie smiled, waving a hand in parting as he walked away.\"Please wait!\" Just as Zhang Lie turned to leave, however, Yun Bing pulled him back. \"Aren't you being too partial? Of the four breakthroughs, three were from the Chu clan! How can I report back to my clan like this?\"Her hand reached underneath the cloak and clasped Zhang Lie's arm. The contact seemed to spark something between them, and Zhang Lie could even sense a hint of coquettishness in Yun Bing's tone.In truth, even Yun Bing hadn't expected that she would act so... familiarly with this man. However, she had no choice. Looking at how disappointed Yun Meng was, she knew that if she didn't reach for the opportunity now, her sister's breakthrough could well be significantly delayed.\"Miss Yun Bing, I know the situation doesn't seem favorable to you, but as I've said, I can't guarantee any measure of success!\"\"But didn't you promise Chu Xun that you would guarantee her breakthrough?\" Zhang Lie insisted that matters were out of his control, but Yun Bing immediately brought up his bet with Chu Xun.Zhang Lie sighed. \"Chu Xun, tell them what I told you right before you entered the training ground.\"\"You liar, you big, fat liar! He told me to be as relaxed as possible, and I was scared half to death!\" Chu Xun, already stewing, flared up the moment Zhang Lie brought the matter up.Of course, this was exactly what Zhang Lie wanted the others to hear.\"There really isn't any sort of trick to the process\u2014all I did was lower her alertness to increase the shock she would receive. Do you all understand now?\"Zhang Lie's explanation was indeed quite simple, but Yun Bing refused to believe him. Perhaps it was because this mysterious fellow had shocked her so many times today that she had developed some sort of blind confidence in him.\"I don't care! I insist that Yun Meng be able to break through today!\"The Yun and Chu elites were both shocked to see Yun Bing, famed for her composure and demeanor, to be acting in this fashion.Zhang Lie had no choice but to relent. \"Miss Yun Bing, I can give it a try, but again, I emphasize that I can't guarantee any measure of success.\"Yun Bing visibly brightened. \"Wonderful! In that case, please do so. I\u2014\"Zhang Lie broke her off. \"I can try again, but what are you offering me to do so? When I helped Miss Chu here, I was doing so because of my interest in her sense of smell, and I expected that I would find it helpful to me in the future. What will you offer me?\"Yun Bing stilled, not expecting Zhang Lie to make every action a business transaction. \"What would you like? Points, techniques, soulshards\u2014as long as it's a reasonable offer, the Yun clan will accept it!\"Zhang Lie smiled. \"The Yun clan is generous, but I'm not in dire need of resources at the moment. How about this: I'll offer my help in exchange for your help at some point in the future. Would you accept these terms?\"Yun Bing thought for a moment. \"This is a fair offer, but I'm telling you now, I won't help with anything malicious!\"\"Don't worry! If anything, I'd be asking for your help dealing with certain lifeforms, not other hunters,\" Zhang Lie reassured her.Hearing his words, Yun Bing nodded in agreement.Zhang Lie finally turned to Yun Meng, who was eyeing her sister hopefully. \"In that case, we'll head into the training ground again!\"FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: Authority of the Sea\"Please wait!\" Just as Zhang Lie was about to bring Yun Meng back into the training ground, Yun Bing called him back again. \"It won't be any more taxing on you to help multiple hunters rather than just one, will it? Since there's no guarantee of success, how about helping out more people at once?\"Zhang Lie quirked an eyebrow, but didn't dispute Yun Bing's assertion.His tacit acceptance of her words had Chu Feng unable to resist offering him the same deal, in hopes that he would be able to help out those candidates from the Chu family who had failed the first time around.In the end, all eight candidates who had failed were repeating the trial.Within the training ground, looking at the eight candidates who had their eyes tightly closed, with Galewind in his right hand, Zhang Lie began charging up a genetic technique, [The Boundless Blade].As the technique neared completion, the candidates felt the immutable force of an immense ocean bearing down on them. The surging waves and a gigantic carp seemed to encircle them, instantly plunging them into peril.They felt as though they were fighting for their lives amidst wave after wave of attack. Some were swept away by the ocean, others consumed by the fish, and others barely, just barely, resisting the attack.Zhang Lie held the technique for only ten seconds, but that ten seconds felt like an eternity for the candidates. As the waves and fish vanished, they opened their eyes, blinking in shock.Where was the ocean? What was that fish?\u00a0When they opened their eyes, they noticed nothing amiss, as though what they had experienced was nothing but an illusion.Yun Meng, waking up from that illusion, found that she had broken through without even knowing it. As she sensed the changes to her body and constitution, she looked toward Zhang Lie with glimmering eyes. She was very curious about the hunter ahead of her.Aside from Yun Meng, three of the eight candidates also successfully managed to break through, a relatively impressive performance.They exited the training ground, and Zhang Lie bade them farewell amidst Yun Bing and Chu Feng's flattering remarks.Thus ended the 'first' encounter between Zhang Lie and the Yun and Chu clans.Everything had gone according to plan, and he had been relatively impressed by Yun Bing and Chu Feng's management abilities.As for Yun Bing and Chu Feng, the mysterious Zhang Lie had left an indelible impression upon them. Just the possibility of a foundational breakthrough was shocking enough, let alone his words and actions. If news of this were to spread, it would affect the Blacksteel settlement, the dimensional world, and even the entire world federation.As they watched Zhang Lie's figure disappear into the forests, Yun Bing murmured, \"Chu Feng, what do you think about this mysterious fellow?\"Chu Feng smiled. \"Haha, if even you think he's mysterious, what more could I say? In my opinion, I hope he remains as mysterious as possible. After all, our clans are on good terms with him now, and who knows if he'll have even more shocking secrets?\"No, wait\u2014not both our clans, but just the Chu clan! You were lucky to be in the vicinity when we began negotiations. After all, the one he reached out to was our Chu Lan. Imagine if you hadn't been around!\"Yun Bing laughed. \"Alright, alright. Count this a favor from you to me. If something like this were to happen to the Yun clan, I'll make sure to notify you. I do find it strange that this mysterious hunter doesn't seem particularly strong.\"Chu Feng nodded. \"Judging from [The Whispering Wind], his framework seems to be nothing out of the ordinary, and I wouldn't place him among the top fifty hunters on the gene leaderboard.\"He did handle this transaction surprisingly well, though. If he isn't a scion of some other clan\u2014even perhaps someone we know\u2014then I'm sure he must be an experienced businessman who's just entered the dimensional world.\"But no matter what, we're on friendly terms, so you're not thinking of doing anything untoward, are you? Surely we have more important things to be working on at the moment!\"Yun Bing smiled. \u00a0\"You mean, securing the means of production of white-grub cores, kelpfish roe, and bluewater frog meat?\"Chu Feng nodded. \"Exactly! No, wait! \u00a0Your clan was the one who prepared all the materials\u2014has your clan already started controlling all three regions?!\"Yun Bing shook her head. \"Not quite. We've only secured two of them, because the last has no value whatsoever anymore.\"Chu Feng was confused. \"Why not?\"\"Do you remember that hunter at the bottom of the gene leaderboard?\"Chu Feng nodded. \"You mean the fool who spent three months in a cave killing the lowest-level lifeform?\"\"Well, in hindsight, he certainly doesn't look like a fool. He spent three months killing white grubs. And, not only that, Yun Gang found that, whenever he returned to the settlement, he'd tug along a huge bag of white-grub cores with him. Surely he's gathered hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of white-grub cores within the last three months?\"Yun Bing's words shocked Chu Feng. \"What?! In that case, has he already hunted those white grubs to extinction? No, more to the point, did he do that knowingly?!\"Yun Bing shook her head. \"Not to extinction, but not far from it. Whether or not he had any insider information, I couldn't say, but it looks like we'll need to be having a talk with him soon.\"\"Things really are getting more interesting, aren't they? We'll certainly have to have a talk with him. Do you think he has anything to do with that mysterious hunter?\"\"We'll find out the moment we talk with him, I'm sure.\"Chu Feng nodded. \"Alright, I can handle searching for him, but you'd better share some of that kelpfish roe and bluewater frog meat with me.\"Yun Bing smiled again. \"Don't worry. Our two clans are the only ones that know about this secret. The supply of food is more than enough for both of us.\"Zhang Lie knew that, after his departure, Chu Feng and Yun Bing would certainly make plans to scale up the breakthrough procedure.After all, that was part of his plans. If not, to whom would he sell the hundreds of thousands of white-grub cores currently in the settlement cellar?He knew that the two clans would rapidly start trying to find him. However, Zhang Lie didn't intend to be found quite so easily. He'd leave them hanging for a while, until their supply of white-grub cores was entirely consumed.Only when they desperately needed more and had no other choice would Zhang Lie show up.After leaving the Forest of Blue Maples, Zhang Lie headed to the Night Forest.This time, he wasn't intending on returning to the venombane glade, but was rather heading to the northern part of the forest, to a location known as the blackwater sands.The reason he was heading there was, naturally, because there was an ingredient that Zhang Lie had to collect from that location. It was where another main ingredient for Potion #2, the black coral, could be harvested.Of course, the reason such a potent herbal ingredient had yet to be discovered was because the black coral was guarded zealously by a superior-grade lifeform known as a dreadtoad, which made its home next to reefs of such coral.The dreadtoad was a toad-type superior-grade lifeform that boasted a particularly strong aural attack. Because of the aquatic environment in which it operated, the sound waves it produced would even be augmented in strength.As a result, the blackwater sands were widely regarded as an extremely dangerous hunting ground even for seasoned hunters.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: Deep Within the CaveThe blackwater sands formed the river bank for the largest river in the night forest, the blackwater river. Because all sorts of lifeforms gathered around the sands, it was an ideal hunting ground for many hunters of the Blacksteel settlement.By the time Zhang Lie, still clad in black, arrived at the blackwater sands, it was already well past noon in the dimensional world. With Venombane in his hand, Zhang Lie activated its stealth ability and entered the sands.There were no less than ten hunting teams in the vicinity, and the tang of blood could faintly be sensed in the air. In the distance, he could see a trail of bloodstains.He retracted his genetic energy as he followed the trail to a large black cave in the distance. The cave opening was as tall as he was. The cave walls seemed to be particularly slick and shiny, and no plants grew in the area.There were no hunters within a hundred meters of this cave, and only scant few tracks by the lifeforms in the vicinity.Zhang Lie didn't dare to get too close to the cave, because it meant that he would have to fight against the dreadtoad in an environment that naturally concentrated its aural attack.Its cries would be magnified in such an enclosed space, and even Zhang Lie, with nineteen superior gene fragments, would hardly be able to survive such an attack.However, the fact that he had nevertheless come to harvest some black coral meant that he had a way to lure these dreadtoads out. In fact, it was a simple method, a variant of which he had already demonstrated against the potbellied toads in the past.He would have to change the bait, though. Because there were so many lifeforms in the region, it would be better for him to thin out their numbers first.By the forest right outside the sands, Zhang Lie began roasting a flamewind pig over an open fire, the flesh visibly sizzling and crisping. The smell of roasting pig immediately attracted the lifeforms that had been skulking or hunting for food in the area.Not only that, it even attracted two teams of hunters over. However, the sight that they saw immediately caused them to huddle together in the distance, not daring to show themselves.With a pop and a bang, just as a large two-headed black snake was closing in on the pig, one of its heads was skewered by a shortsword, and the other exploded.A hunter with translucent white armor was enacting a legendary hunt right before their eyes.Whenever other lifeforms approached that fire, by the time they got within a hundred meters, that silver shadow would immediately appear by their side, then strike them a lethal blow.Most of these lifeforms were mutated-grade, and some were even at the apex of mutated-grade: the goldensteel mantis, the white-tipped nightscorpion, and the three-eyed ghostwolf. Within just a few short minutes, there were already a dozen such carcasses by the fire.No matter what lifeform he faced, that silver hunter seemed to be able to kill it in one blow.He seemed to possess a soulshard of unusual stealth, and there was no premonition before his sudden appearance and subsequent dispatch of yet another lifeform. His strikes were rapid and unrelenting, and the violet shortsword in his hand seemed to penetrate everything it touched. Even mutated-grade lifeforms known for their tough exoskeleton were like papier mache against that blade.The two hunting teams were stupefied by the slaughter ahead of them. Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng could hardly have expected that a moment's hunger would allow them to witness such an expert at work. With this level of strength, he surely had to be in the top twenty hunters of the settlement!If they could develop a good relationship with him, their entire hunting team's strength would surely double, at the very least...Just then, the shrill cry of a dreadtoad rang out, breaking the two teams of hunters out of their reverie and causing them to retreat instantly.A dreadtoad! This was a boss-level mob in the blackwater sands, a superior-grade lifeform which had once vanquished three teams of hunters just with one shrill cry. Could that mysterious hunter be here to kill a dreadtoad?Surely not\u2014superior-grade lifeforms were usually hunted with a team! At the very least, they hadn't ever seen a hunter kill a superior-grade lifeform alone in all their time in the dimensional world. Who on Earth was that hunter?!In truth, they were all mistaken: just like them, Zhang Lie had retreated upon hearing the dreadtoad's cry. However, unlike them, after leaving its attack range, he rushed toward the dreadtoad's lair. Within moments, Zhang Lie entered that cave: the Blackwater Cave.It was exceedingly damp and dark, and if not for the fact that Zhang Lie had reached his mutated gene capacity, he would likely have trouble even seeing what lay in front of him.Curiously, the cave was very clean. Except for a few small plants growing by its walls, there was nothing else around. Many of these plants were potent ingredients in their own right, but Zhang Lie only had time for the black coral.The deeper in he went, the deeper the water became. Halfway into the cave, Zhang Lie found himself having to swim to go further. Luckily, Zhang Lie's framework was water-attuned, and he was able to morph into the form of a carp and swim through the water, moving even faster than he did while running.In less than a minute, Zhang Lie was deep within the cave, where he saw branches of black coral underneath a gigantic oval rock. It was all black coral, the highest-quality black coral!This was one of the main ingredients needed for Potion #2! Zhang Lie had expected that there would be black coral in the region, but not in such quality or quantity. After all, this wasn't the main region in which black coral could be found, and the reason Zhang Lie had come here was because it was the closest.Despite seeing the high-quality black coral, Zhang Lie didn't try to harvest it immediately, because there was another dreadtoad on that oval rock.Luckily, Zhang Lie noticed that this dreadtoad didn't have a set of protruding golden vocal pouches, which implied that this dreadtoad was female. This was why it hadn't been attracted by the scent of roasting pig.Genetic lifeforms were, in some sense, mutated versions of regular animals that could be found on Earth. Several of their habits would be similar to those of terrestrial lifeforms, and such was the case for the dreadtoad in front of him.In general, the male toad would forage for food, whereas the female toad would be responsible for reproduction. Most importantly, compared to a male toad, a female toad, which didn't have vocal pouches, was far less threatening to fight.Only when Zhang Lie decided the risk was minimal did he carefully swim toward the bottom of the oval rock.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: Preparing for the HuntThis female toad was having an afternoon nap, and it didn't notice that, beneath the rock on which it was resting, there was a stealthed 'fish' swimming around.Of course, Zhang Lie was being very careful not to startle it. He rapidly swam to the underside of the rock, trying to make as minimal a motion as he could, then began harvesting the black coral that grew along the underside of the rock.No matter how careful Zhang Lie was, he still ended up making a tiny cracking noise while harvesting the fifth branch of coral.Zhang Lie's heart leapt into his throat. He would have no choice but to run away if he were caught. After all, the toad on top of the rock was a superior-grade lifeform. If they were out in the open, Zhang Lie might have considered trying to hunt it down, but since he was in the toads' lair, if he were to be caught now...Luckily, while the toad stirred, it didn't awaken.If Zhang Lie had panicked and run, he would almost certainly have alerted the toad with the commotion, and then he would have to furiously rush out of the cave while trying to avoid the male toad that was out eating his roasted pig.The next few minutes went as planned, and Zhang Lie managed to harvest a dozen or so branches of the highest-quality black coral he could find. Wary as he was of the male toad's return, he didn't dare linger in the lair. He swam back out to the mouth of the cave at his fastest speed.What surprised Zhang Lie was that, even as he returned to the fire pit, he saw no trace of the male toad. Furthermore, the carcasses of the lifeforms that he had slaughtered near the fire had all vanished.There were traces of a fight left at the scene by two relatively large-sized lifeforms. However, even after glancing around a few times, Zhang Lie couldn't identify either of the parties that had fought.As he surveyed the remnants of the fire, the two teams of hunters from before were slowly converging on his location. The two teams were both being very cautious, wanting to approach him but not quite daring to do so.It wasn't surprising that Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng would behave this way, after all: the scene of him hunting down all those lifeforms had been too striking. They were all outside settlement grounds, and anything could happen.Just as they took another step, Zhang Lie suddenly appeared in their midst.\"Cap-Captain!\" one of the hunters shouted, causing all of them to look toward Zhang Lie warily, hands on their weapons. That was something any seasoned hunter would do instinctively upon sighting an enemy.However, after the two team captains glanced at Zhang Lie, they motioned for their subordinates to lower their weapons. Judging from his fight, the two of them were certain that, if this hunter wanted to kill them, they'd all be dead.When Zhang Lie saw the male captain's face, he was very shocked. This\u2014this fellow was Fang Yi! Fang Yi, the original Monarch of a Thousand Transformations!In Zhang Lie's past life, Fang Yi was the lucky hunter who had eventually obtained the superior-grade white-grub soulshard, as well as one of the strongest hunters who had emerged from the Blacksteel settlement.In other words, Zhang Lie's armor really should have belonged to him.Fate was a curious thing, wasn't it? He hadn't anticipated that he would encounter him now, and especially not in this fashion.\"Nice to meet you, I'm Sun Mengmeng!\" Zhang Lie's attention remained on Fang Yi until the female team leader called out a greeting.\"Haha, hello. I'm guessing you know what I'm here to figure out?\" Zhang Lie replied.\"You want to know what happened here, don't you?\" Sun Mengmeng's eyes were twinkling.\"Yes, all of you were here while I was hunting those lifeforms. Do you know what happened while I was gone?\"\"Well, you returned the moment we got close! From a distance, all we heard were some dreadtoad cries and bestial roars. Given the devastation here, I'm guessing some other superior-grade lifeform made an appearance. Based on my experience in the region, I suspect it's the big cat up on the mountain!\" Fang Yi interrupted the conversation before Sun Mengmeng could reply.\"A big cat? What big cat?\"\"A thunderfur polecat, a lifeform that looks very much like a cat. It has two antlers on its head that can give off lightning!\" This time, before Fang Yi could respond, Sun Mengmeng rushed to provide the relevant information.It was then that Zhang Lie finally understood what the cat was, as well as what had transpired in his absence. The two superior-grade lifeforms must have fought over his roast pig!\"Do you want to hunt down a superior-grade lifeform together?\" Zhang Lie offered.The two hunters sucked in a deep breath. Superior gene fragments and superior-grade soulshards were the dream of all hunters in the first realm of the dimensional world. Who could resist such a temptation?\"Of course!\" Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng replied at once.The two of them certainly weren't going to turn down such an opportunity! Based on their current progression, it would take at least a few months before they were able to challenge even the weakest superior-grade lifeform.\"Report your gene fragments as well as your role in the team!\"The terrain here was rather difficult to work with, and the superior-grade lifeforms in the region weren't easy prey, either. Several helpers would make life far easier for Zhang Lie.Of course, Zhang Lie also wanted to give Fang Yi an opportunity, in partial recompense for the one he'd taken away. Both in his past life and this one, Zhang Lie had had a good impression of Fang Yi.As for Sun Mengmeng, well, she was quite lucky to be present. She would obtain this opportunity by being at the right place, at the right time, with the right strength, and with the right attitude.\"Fang Yi; basic genes, 100, mutated, 60; main attacker!\"\"Sun Mengmeng; basic genes, 100, mutated, 50; assassin!\"\"Yang Ze; basic genes, 100, mutated, 30; trapsetter!\"\"Li Feng; basic genes, 100, mutated, 30; main tank!\"\"Sun Xiaowu; basic genes, 100, mutated, 40; main attacker!\"\"Zhou Ying; basic genes, 100, mutated, 30; ambusher!\"Their teams consisted of six hunters in total, with a considerably wide range of attacking styles, though the number of gene fragments they had were rather subpar. Even as helpers, only the two team leaders would barely meet the minimum criteria. The other hunters would have to lay traps and support them from the sidelines.\"Good. In that case, let's talk strategy!\"FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: The Hunt BeginsZhang Lie's strategy wasn't all that complicated: he simply informed them about key points they would need to be careful about. Except for Zhang Lie, all of them were facing a superior-grade lifeform for the first time, and he didn't want any of them to die during this hunt.After ten minutes, Zhang Lie, along with Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng's teams, found the two fighting lifeforms in a large, mountainous valley: a multi-colored speckled dreadtoad, as well as an antlered thunderfur polecat.Each of the two lifeforms had sustained substantive injuries, reflecting how serious the fight was. Their fighting had stirred up such a dense cloud of dust that the gathered hunters could only barely see their figures from the outside, and they had no idea how the fight was progressing.\"All this for one roasted pig?\" Fang Yi was stupefied at the scene.\"Could a single flamewind pig lure out so many lifeforms, even a superior-grade dreadtoad? It seems to me that you aren't much smarter than the roasted pig! Of course our captain had to have added some sort of special spice to it! Can't you tell?\"Sun Mengmeng's banter with Fang Yi made Zhang Lie recall certain images from his past life.\"Haha, in that case, doesn't that mean that we'll have an easy fight? To think our captain's planned for all this in advance!\" Fang Yi was quite a good bootlicker.Zhang Lie laughed. \"If you have time to praise me, why not think about how to deal with the aftermath of their fight? Given our team's strength, even if I did do something to that pig, and even if they're both battered from the fight, we can only hunt one of them down. Of the two lifeforms, which would you rather hunt?\"Sun Mengmeng immediately replied, \"The thunderfur polecat, of course! After all, the aural attack from that dreadtoad's far too hard to handle.\"Fang Yi thought for a moment before replying, \"Great minds think alike, and I agree with you. However, in order to deal with that polecat, we need to think of a way to slow it down. Otherwise, we might well end up with nothing! Captain, I'm sure you must have thought of a strategy by now, haven't you?\"Fang Yi's bootlicking was starting to discomfit even Zhang Lie. He blinked, then shook his head.\"No, you were both wrong from the beginning. Our prey should be the dreadtoad, not the polecat. This valley is extremely large, and the dreadtoad's aural attack will be dramatically weakened in such an open environment. Furthermore, as a toad-type creature, it only has limited means of attack.\"On the other hand, the thunderfur polecat is a sly creature that can move rapidly, and it's not certain that we'll be able to stop it from running away even in its wounded state. Thus, to be safe, our target will be the dreadtoad. Go and make your preparations!\"Zhang Lie would be the main attacker for the fight, and since he had decided on the dreadtoad, the rest of the team would naturally defer to him. After all, he was the one who would be leading the attack. Furthermore, his skill and knowledge was certainly greater than theirs, and his analysis allowed them to see the errors in their judgment.In truth, what they would be able to do against these two superior-grade lifeforms was very limited. However, they might have to face more than just lifeforms during the fight.Just as they had discovered the two superior-grade lifeforms, others could easily do the same. In order to avoid any sudden ambushes by other teams of hunters, Zhang Lie would need sentries to keep guard.As a barrage of lightning struck a curiously dark wave of sound, the force of the explosion and the resulting outpouring of genetic energy made a mess of the greenery about the valley. Even from a distance, one could hear the cries of a toad and the roars of a beast.As expected, both lifeforms were brutalized by the fight. The right half of the dreadtoad's face was charred black, and a hole had opened up by the thunderfur polecat's stomach.The lifeforms both began to flee, as if they had simultaneously come to their senses and decided that the fight wasn't worth it. The only reason they had started fighting was for that roasted pig. By this point, they both knew that their opponent wouldn't be easy to deal with, and if they were to keep fighting, they might well lose their lives.Any lifeform\u2014regular or mutated, terrestrial or otherwise\u2014would try to flee if its life were in danger, not continue to fight. As long as they were alive, they still had an opportunity to grow stronger, but if they were dead...\"Our plan starts now! Disperse!\" The next moment, Zhang Lie activated his venombane-scorpion soulshard and vanished from sight right in front of the other hunters' eyes.Following his shout, Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, and the other hunters immediately began to attack. Sun Mengmeng, who had long since nocked an arrow, fired her shot immediately.The arrow, burning with genetic energy, flared like a firebird as it flew toward the dreadtoad. Perhaps because the dreadtoad was simply too injured, or perhaps because this arrow had flown in from its injured right, Sun Mengmeng's arrow landed directly on its face, stunning it and exploding in a baptism of fire.The right half of its face, already scorched, now began to char, turning even blacker.However, because Sun Mengmeng didn't possess any superior gene fragments, the damage she could deal to superior-grade lifeforms would be rather limited, and all that her attack managed to do was to draw the toad's attention.The moment the dreadtoad turned to Sun Mengmeng, half a dozen flying knives and spears flew toward its face.In the dimensional world, every hunter had to prepare at least one long-ranged technique, be it arrows, flying knives, spears, or even thrown axes. After all, under many circumstances, hunters couldn't face bestial lifeforms directly. In that case, they would have to rely on long-ranged attacks to accomplish their objective.The dreadtoad destroyed this slew of attacks with an aural wave. Even though they did no damage to the dreadtoad, they successfully enraged it.Its fight with the thunderfur polecat was against an opponent of equal bearing, but this fight now, against these pitiful humans, would be perfectly one-sided. The punishment for these puny humans who dared provoke it would be death.It jumped toward where Sun Mengmeng, Fang Yi, and the others were located, evidently trying to take out its frustration with its previous battle on them.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: Toad in a HoleThe dreadtoad was acting exactly as planned.By the time it landed where they were, Sun Mengmeng and the others had all dashed away.Zhang Lie's instructions at this point was very clear: after loosing a volley of missiles at the toad, run away immediately. Given the skill that Zhang Lie had displayed, no one dared disobey his instructions.After all, no hunter would be foolish enough to risk dying unnecessarily. Their prey was a superior-grade lifeform, and any incaution during a fight could easily lead to their death. And since they didn't have enough strength to fight such a lifeform head-on, they would have to make do with their intellect\u2014well, they were just kiting the toad from spot to spot.Sun Mengmeng and Fang Yi, who had dashed in the direction of its right flank, again began harassing it with ranged attacks. Their behavior completely enraged the dreadtoad.It croaked a few times, and its skin seemed to be covered by a mysterious blackwater film. It tensed its legs, as if intending to leap after them once more.Just as it rose into the air, a silver figure appeared out of nowhere. He swung his violet sword and stabbed it deep into one of the toad's legs. The toad's upward momentum rent a dreadful wound in its leg, one that stretched all the way from the upper part of its leg to its feet.Zhang Lie had succeeded in his sneak attack!Even a superior-grade lifeform like the dreadtoad could be severely wounded with Venombane.Furthermore, Venombane possessed extremely severe poison, and the blood that was leaking out of the wound, initially a pale blue color, had turned a ghastly green.And because of its initial momentum, the dreadtoad's body was careening unwillingly toward Sun Mengmeng and Fang Yi.However, the cry it had released the moment it leapt still caused Zhang Lie significant problems. The aural waves led to a localized hurricane that quickly swept over Zhang Lie, who was planning on retreating after his sneak attack.It tore his surroundings to shreds, and Zhang Lie's chest felt so stuffed up that he thought his entire body was about to explode. Fortunately, he had prepared for this eventuality, and he had manifested two large earmuffs in his white-grub helmet to protect himself.Genetic energy permeated his body, fortifying it from the wind. With his right palm, he activated [Fists of the Silent Sea], defending against the assault of the wind with the impermeable force of water.The repeated clash of water and wind successfully managed to hold back the storm for a single instant. In that instant, Zhang Lie dashed away with [Rippling Walk].It was then that the dreadtoad finally landed right where Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng were waiting. However, not only had it lost its target once again, it had even ended up in the trap that had been carefully laid out for it: a deep hole tens of meters deep, filled with all sorts of sharp weapons.As a superior-grade lifeform, the dreadtoad could shrug off blows from regular bladed weapons without any harm. Of course, this was only true if it were uninjured, and it certainly was not uninjured.The dreadtoad had to expend much of its genetic energy in order to suppress the poison coursing through its veins. As a result, it couldn't toughen up its skin, and it had jumped straight into a pit of spears unprotected.But a superior-grade constitution wasn't a joke, and this seemingly serious injury was actually little more than superficial.However, the next few moments would be a life-or-death trial for the dreadtoad. Because one of its legs was injured, and because of the poison, the dreadtoad was unable to leap out of the hole. This meant that it, unable to retreat, could well die an ignoble death at the hand of these puny hunters it despised.Before it could react, a torrent of violet liquid surged toward its head. The dreadtoad cried out, diffusing the attack with its aural waves, turning the violet liquid into mist.At the same time, arrows, spears, and thrown axes began to fill up the hole. The dreadtoad began to cry out over and over again, dispersing each attack with yet another aural wave. However, this would dramatically speed up its rate of genetic energy consumption.Wreathed in violet fog, the dreadtoad didn't seem to realize that its body was slowly becoming paralyzed. It tried to jump out of the hole again, but its heavily injured leg, along with its lack of genetic energy, caused it to falter.The dreadtoad had no choice but to calm down and focus on purging the poison from within its body.Outside the hole, after hearing nothing coming from within for quite some time, Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng were both chomping at the bit to rush toward the hole to claim their spoils.Fang Yi asked Zhang Lie impatiently, \"Captain, we haven't heard anything, surely the toad's almost dead by now?\"Zhang Lie smiled. \"Haven't you heard the saying that a wounded animal is the most dangerous? And a wounded lifeform is even worse than that. If you want to commit suicide, feel free to go ahead!\"Upon hearing his words, Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng both stilled, but they could barely resist the temptation of superior gene fragments and the possibility of a superior-grade soulshard. Sun Mengmeng couldn't help asking, \"But didn't you say that the poison on your blade was particularly domineering?\"\"Poison still takes time to activate, especially against superior-grade lifeforms, after all. Furthermore, you do realize that both of you will die if the dreadtoad launches an aural wave straight at you, don't you? Caution should be your top priority.\"Zhang Lie explained himself again patiently, well understanding the reason for their impatience. Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng, not daring to head toward the hole but too impatient to stand still, ended up pacing around him.\"Alright, alright, stop moving around! There's still a long while to go yet, so if we want to minimize the risk, you'll all have to be patient. Fang Yi, keep guard with the rest of these hunters and make sure no one's around to disturb us. Sun Mengmeng and I will be sufficient to handle the dreadtoad!\"Fang Yi immediately turned toward him, his eyes probing.\"What, you don't trust me?\"\"No, no! Even without us, I'm sure you'd be able to take down this dreadtoad. We'll set up a patrol immediately!\" Fang Yi reacted near-instantaneously.Zhang Lie smiled. \"Don't worry, I don't have any intention of cutting you out. I'm claiming its soulshard for myself, of course, but I certainly will share a portion of the meat with everyone.Fang Yi, along with his team, sighed in relief.After all, faced with Zhang Lie's dominating power, they wouldn't be able to refute anything he said or did. Even if he refused to share any of the spoils with them, what could they do? They would even have to thank him for not killing them.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Li Hong's InvolvementIt turned out that Zhang Lie's intuition was right: Fang Yi's patrol immediately identified quite a few lone wolves in the area.Lone wolves were hunters who were confident enough in their abilities to hunt solo. Of course, no matter how confident they were, those who would hunt in an area like this were usually only at near-maximum capacity for mutated gene fragments, and they wouldn't even dare to lay their eyes on superior-grade lifeforms.If not for Zhang Lie, Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng certainly wouldn't have, either.He was relatively experienced in dealing with such affairs, and managed to fend them off with a few inspired lies. When these lone wolves saw Fang Yi's large team 'fleeing for their lives', they didn't dare draw any closer.By the hole, Zhang Lie and Sun Mengmeng were harassing the dreadtoad, trying to squeeze it dry of genetic energy. Zhang Lie was playing the role of the tactician, whereas Sun Mengmeng was the attacker. From time to time, she would shoot a [Ninecloud Arrow] at the toad, causing it to shriek and croak.Upon hearing these cries, the teams of hunters who had been lured to the scene by the disturbance were largely dissuaded from heading any closer and fled instead.However, there were still a few hunters who kept approaching. For instance, the second-fiddle team fielded by the Li clan, on hearing the dreadtoad's cries, picked up their pace and rushed toward the fight instead.Fang Yi's patrol naturally encountered them within the dense forest. He was quite familiar with Li Hong's team, a ten-member team consisting of hunters who were near the mutated gene capacity. They had a reputation for being tyrannical, and would frequently snatch the kills of other teams of hunters.Fang Yi hadn't expected that they would encounter them at such a critical juncture; his team was lacking in terms of strength and numbers, and wouldn't stand a chance in a direct confrontation.Thus, Fang Yi made use of a tried-and-tested technique: pretending to be fleeing in haste after encountering a life-threatening situation.\"Stop right there!\" As expected, after glancing at them derisively, Li Hong commanded them to stop.Fang Yi's team immediately stopped. He stepped forward and asked, \"Is something wrong, Captain Li?\"Li Hong smiled. \"You recognize me?\"\"Of course! Surely there's no one from the Blacksteel settlement who hasn't heard of your team. Is there anything I can do for you?\" Fang Yi might not have been a very strong hunter, but his social skills were unparalleled.Li Hong preened at the flattery. \"Good, good! Let me ask: why is your team running away?\"Fang Yi made a horrified expression. \"Captain Li, don't you know? Just ahead, there was a dreadtoad that just fought off a thunderfur polecat. It seemed to be enraged after the fight, and it's killing off one of the hunting teams in the area now! According to the hunters I passed along the way, almost their entire team is dead or crippled now, and the scene of the fight's a mess of bloody gore!\"Fang Yi was trying to scare Li Hong off, but Li Hong clearly had much more inflated an opinion of his own abilities than Fang Yi had expected. Upon hearing Fang Yi's description, he seemed to grow even more interested. \"Did you see that dreadtoad?\"Fang Yi shook his head. \"Of course not! If I did, I wouldn't be alive right now. One croak from it would be all it took to kill me! Captain Li, that lifeform's really quite frightening\u2014you aren't thinking of hunting it down, are you? Don't, it's simply too dangerous!\"Sensing Li Hong's interest, Fang Yi tried to dissuade him from the idea, but Li Hong wasn't to be swayed so easily. He immediately gave Fang Yi a condescending look. \"If you want to run, run! Your team isn't like mine, after all.\"Fang Yi barely masked the derision from his face. However, he was smart enough not to get into a direct confrontation. As Li Hong suggested, he hurried off with his team.The moment they were out of sight, Fang Yi immediately had Sun Xiaowu report what had happened to Sun Mengmeng via conch shell, while he would rush back to her, taking a detour around Li Hong's team, to provide reinforcements.At the edge of the trap, after attacking the dreadtoad inside dozens of times without sensing a response, Zhang Lie was about to head into the hole and take the dreadtoad's life when a conch shell by Sun Mengmeng's waist began to vibrate.Sun Xiaowu's hesitant voice explained to Zhang Lie and Sun Mengmeng what was going on.Sun Mengmeng's face filled with shock. \"Captain, what will we do? Li Hong's coming!\"Zhang Lie frowned, then relaxed. \"Let him come. If he wants to die, so be it! Tell Sun Xiaowu and the others to try to stall them or hold them back. We'll hurry and kill the dreadtoad before Li Hong gets here, and head back to help them immediately afterwards. Launch another attack into the hole. I'm getting ready to jump in.\"Sun Mengmeng looked at Zhang Lie in disbelief. \"Captain, what do you mean? Are you going to go against the Li clan? The Li clan's one of the six most influential clans in the settlement! If we get on their bad side...\"Zhang Lie narrowed his eyes. \"In that case, what do you propose? Handing them this dreadtoad just like that? If you think it's dangerous, you can have your team retreat, and you can also retreat.In that case, nothing that happens here will be of any concern to you.\"Sun Mengmeng stilled at the ultimatum. Honestly, her behavior wasn't unexpected. Zhang Lie might have seemed like a top hunter, but he was just one person, whereas the Li clan was a massive player in the Blacksteel settlement that no ordinary hunter would be able to go against.If they were to start a conflict with members of the Li clan now, they would likely face a thorny road ahead in the Blacksteel settlement. However, they also didn't want to give up this rare opportunity to obtain superior gene fragments. If they didn't seize this opportunity now, who knew when they would ever be able to obtain superior gene fragments?After all, under usual circumstances, they wouldn't even be able to face a superior-grade lifeform in a direct confrontation before maxing out their mutated gene capacity.\"I'm sorry, Captain, but I have to think about my entire team's future.\" Sun Mengmeng regretted her decision almost instantly, but she had to do what was right. A rash decision on her part could irrevocably affect her team members' lives.In the end, she chose to give up on the opportunity.Zhang Lie smiled. \"If you don't take this opportunity now, when will you ever take such an opportunity? If you choose to retreat, to cower, to back down just because it's a risk, you'll never become a top-tier hunter. Your two teams stand a fighting chance against Li Hong's team, and I'll be around to handle him myself. I'm asking you once more: are you certain you want to back down?\"Sun Mengmeng seemed even more conflicted. After a moment of desperate wrangling with herself, she called out seriously, \"Captain! Let me ask you a question myself. If we offend the Li clan going forward, will you continue working with us?\"Zhang Lie began to laugh. \"This is my prey, and I won't let anyone steal it from me! I won't give it up even to Li Jin, let alone Li Hong! Furthermore, who's to say that Li Hong will make it back to the Blacksteel settlement to report this feud to the clan?\"\"You\u2014you can't be thinking of killing\u2026\" Sun Mengmeng gaped in shock. After an agonizing few seconds of thought, she finally made up her mind. \"I'll trust you this once! Xiaowu, Fang Yi, try to delay Li Hong's team. We're almost done here!\"FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: Let Matters RestAfter confirming that the dreadtoad had been completely paralyzed, Zhang Lie leapt into the hole after activating his stealth, then killed the dreadtoad with a clean strike through its head.[You successfully killed a superior-grade dreadtoad, but did not obtain a soulshard. By consuming the flesh of the dreadtoad, you may receive one to ten superior gene fragments.]As the will of the world spoke into their minds, every member of the team that had participated in the kill sighed in relief.Sun Mengmeng asked expectantly from the top of the hole, \"How did it go, Captain? Did it produce a soulshard?\"Superior-grade soulshards were a particularly rare and precious commodity within the dimensional world, especially those that were particularly useful. Even though Zhang Lie had stated clearly that none of them would get the soulshard if one were to condense, Sun Mengmeng was still very excited at the possibility of one.Zhang Lie shook his head in annoyance. \"No, it didn't!\"Zhang Lie wasn't acting this time. In an attempt to condense a dreadtoad soulshard, he had secretly smashed up two regular-grade potbellied-toad soulshards, and even then nothing had emerged.Sun Mengmeng's face fell. \"That's a shame. But soulshards were always rare to begin with, so there's nothing we can do about it. Won't you hurry out of the hole? Xiaowu and the others can't hold them off much longer!\"By the time Zhang Lie leapt out of the hole, there were already quite a few people behind Sun Mengmeng.As he glanced toward Zhang Lie, Li Hong, with five of his subordinates gathered around him, smiled superciliously at him. \"What good timing! You, in the silver armor! Hand over the spoils, and I won't kill you!\"When Fang Yi's team came by again to hold him back, Li Hong began to suspect that something was amiss. He split his team up into two, then rushed toward where he had last heard the dreadtoad's cries.Zhang Lie smiled. \"Captain Li, the dreadtoad's dead, and it didn't condense a soulshard. Even if you were to obtain its flesh, you won't be able to get any superior gene fragments from it, would you? How about doing me a favor and leaving, so none of us have to go through any trouble?\"Zhang Lie glanced at Sun Mengmeng, motioning for her to get ready for battle.\"A favor? Who do you think you are, to deserve a favor from m\u2014\"\"Attack!\" Of course, Zhang Lie didn't expect an arrogant, condescending hunter like Li Hong to let things lie. The only reason he had said what he did was to give Sun Mengmeng some time to prepare.The moment Li Hong responded, Zhang Lie brusquely broke him off. Genetic energy exploded from his body as he activated [Rippling Walk], tracing out a dragon's form as he dashed forward. In his hand, Venombane glowed violet, like the tooth of that dragon.His blade headed straight for Li Hong's throat.Li Hong certainly hadn't anticipated that the other party would attack him immediately, even when he was surrounded by his team. These were the blackwater sands, right by the Blacksteel settlement and under its control! What hunter would dare to strike at him here?!Before he could react, Zhang Lie's blow was right in front of his face. His speed made Li Hong realize that his opponent had no fewer superior gene fragments than he did, and likely even had more. Reacting almost by instinct, he raised his spear to block the blow.However, the moment he did so, Zhang Lie changed his stab into a slice, tracing out a violet arc against his right arm. Venombane was a weapon that had come from a superior-grade soulshard, and was even rarer than a weapon forged from materials that came from a superior-grade lifeform. How could Li Hong's armor block a blow from this sword?Their initial confrontation left Li Hong injured with a shallow cut. Luckily, he had about a dozen superior gene fragments, and was able to react almost as the shortsword split his skin a[art. He leapt away, preventing Zhang Lie from taking advantage of his momentary opening.\"Kill them!\" Li Hong shouted, his eyes red with bloodthirst, pale-blue genetic energy emanating from his body.The moment Li Hong's team prepared to fight, a firebird swooped down toward them, an attack from Sun Mengmeng. The explosion from the firebird was blocked by a rainbow of genetic energy: Li Hong's team was strong even by the standards of the blackwater sands, and it was able to handle even this sudden attack.As smoke and dust billowed through the air, Zhang Lie vanished from sight. Amidst the dust, a violet light sparkled. At the back of Li Hong's team, a young hunter who was about to throw a spear had his neck pierced clean through. Even to his death, he had no idea from which direction the shortsword had appeared.\"Be careful! That fellow has some unusually advanced stealth technique! Zhang Chao, toss flash powder into the air!\" The team had certainly noticed their long-ranged attacker dying, and Li Hong forced himself to ignore the corrosive poison in his wound as he commanded the rest of his team.Li Hong hadn't expected that his opponent's blade would have been smeared with poison. He retreated and drank two whole bottles of antidote, to no avail.He had initially thought that his opponent's blade had only left a scratch on his arm, but it was far worse than that. The poison on the blade was so strong that he had to devote most of his genetic energy to prevent it from spreading throughout his body.A cloud of white powder was tossed into the air, but Zhang Lie had come prepared for that. Water saturated the air around him, turning it to fog, as he dashed out of the powder's range.At the same time, the other half of Li Hong's team, which had been stalled by Fang Yi and the others, finally arrived at the scene. Of course, as they rejoined Li Hong, Fang Yi, Sun Xiaowu, and the others headed to Zhang Lie's side.The two sides faced off again, their weapons raised, but Li Hong appeared to be far more serious than before. Given Zhang Lie's attitude and strength, he knew that he wasn't going to benefit from today's confrontation.The most pressing issue was that silver-armored hunter's strength, his unpredictable movement speed, undetectable stealth, and frightening poison. Perhaps he would be able to defend against him if he hadn't been wounded, but now that he had been poisoned, he could well suffer grievous injuries if the fight were to continue.He shot a piercing glance toward Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng, then turned toward Zhang Lie. \"I was too rash. Will you accept my apology and let matters rest?\"Li Hong, admitting defeat?\u00a0Fang Yi could barely hide his look of shock and amazement. Li Hong had always been an arrogant asshole to everyone around, so when had he become so... nice?Could he have misheard? He glanced at the stupefied faces all around him. No, that couldn't be the case.Sun Mengmeng was the only one who understood what was going on. After all, she had been scrutinizing Zhang Lie very closely during the fight.It was from then on that she decided to become one of his followers.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Li Hong SuccumbsThe gathered hunters all turned to Zhang Lie, because what he said next would determine the outcome of this confrontation. From Li Hong's subordinates' standpoint, they were certainly hoping that Zhang Lie would accept Li Hong's offer, because their teammate's death had been so sudden and unexpected.If Zhang Lie were to attack any of them, they would likely perish in the same manner. Who knew whom Zhang Lie would target next? They only had one life, after all, and if they could avoid dying just by losing some face, well, that didn't seem like too bad an offer.Li Hong only picked on those teams that were weaker than his, anyway. They could just retaliate against this team of hunters when they had an even larger force with them.Of course, just because they thought this way didn't mean that Zhang Lie and the others would agree. They had all been hunters for quite some time now, and Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng in particular knew full well that if they were to let matters lie now, they would surely suffer intense retaliation from Li Hong and the Li clan in the future.Zhang Lie would likely be fine because he was strong, but what about the rest of them?Given the tense atmosphere, however, neither of them dared to step forward and ask Zhang Lie to continue the fight. They didn't realize how strong Zhang Lie's poison was, or how weak Li Hong had become.\"Captain!\" the two of them shouted out, hopeful that he wouldn't succumb to the pressure and would instead deal with this problem once and for all.Zhang Lie glanced back at Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng, both clearly wanting to say more but barely restraining themselves, and gave them a knowing glance.\"Heh, you want a ceasefire? Don't you think you should act more politely, then? Or are you unaware of the fact that your remaining life can be measured in seconds?\"Li Hong was clearly unable to accept Zhang Lie's response. \"What? What do you mean, measured in seconds? I'm a hunter from the Li clan, and if you dare\u2014\"\"If I were scared of your clan, I wouldn't have poisoned you, don't you think? If you're smart, you'd hand over all your soulshards now, and I might spare you on account of Li Jin.\"Li Hong was quite used to getting whatever he wanted whenever he revealed his identity, but he hadn't expected that the other party would break him off and even bring up his brother. The other hunter's tone of speech made it seem as though even Li Hong's brother would have to defer to him.\"You know my brother? Who exactly are you?!\" Li Hong could hardly have imagined that the result of a thin scratch on his arm could be so serious. Based on the hunter's words, his life would rapidly drain away if he didn't do anything about it.\"Aren't you talkative? Either hand over your soulshards or rot away into nothingness, the choice is yours.\" Zhang Lie was tired of talking to him.The poison in his arm seemed to be turning more and more corrosive: despite concentrating all his genetic energy to block it, not only was his genetic energy draining faster, the poison was also starting to spread. Given the situation, Li Hong knew that he wasn't going to get away unscathed.A long period of terrorizing the weaker hunters in the region had left him unprepared to deal with a real threat. How naive he was to think that he could call for a ceasefire when his life was already in the other hunter's hands!Li Hong glanced at his subordinates, not wanting to lose face in front of them. \"Are you certain you want to make enemies of the Li clan? If I were to lose an arm, are you certain you'd be able to handle the Li clan's wrath?\"Li Hong chose to struggle to the very end, and his subordinates, upon hearing his words, quickly began to charge up genetic energy. Of course, as they did so, Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng did the same on the other side.\"Kill them all!\" Zhang Lie commanded, darting forward to strike the first blow.Li Hong saw a violet arc flash by his eyes, and an unexpectedly familiar arm flying into the air.\"Ah\u2014Ahhh!\" That was his right arm! Li Hong screamed as blood poured out of his stump, stumbling to the ground in a fit of weakness. He had lost all ability to fight.If Li Hong had decisively cut off his arm the moment he was inflicted with the poison, he might have been able to defend himself for a while longer, but by this point, the poison had already begun to spread through his bloodstream. It wouldn't corrode his body just yet, but his body would soon be paralyzed. The blood from his stump was a ghastly purple, indicating that the poison had spread even further.Zhang Lie ignored him entirely.He activated [Rippling Walk]. With his left palm, he stacked the effects of [Three-Wave Crescendo] and [Fists of the Silent Sea]; with his right hand, he charged up [The Boundless Blade]. He struck the remainder of Li Hong's team with the unassailable might of the ocean.Four hunters fell in the blink of an eye.The other hunters on Zhang Lie's side also began to fight. Fang Yi was a water-attuned hunter, and his eyes were gleaming as he saw Zhang Lie in action. Clearly, he hadn't expected that water-attuned techniques could be so devastating.As he struck at his own opponent, Fang Yi swore to himself that he'd latch onto Zhang Lie. With his team's current resources, meeting Zhang Lie was undoubtedly a rare opportunity. He would be a fool not to take advantage.To his left, Sun Mengmeng's [Flamewing Shot] swallowed up a hunter opposite her.Their leaders' performance boosted the other hunters' morale, and Sun Xiaowu and the others each found a target for themselves.In what seemed like an instant, Li Hong's team of ten hunters was reduced to three, and Li Hong himself slumped feebly to the ground.\"Spare me! I surrender!\"\"That's right, we'll hand over all our soulshards!\"Before he could say anything, his last two subordinates were lying prostrate on the ground, begging for mercy. They removed all the soulshards they had in their soulspace and offered it to Zhang Lie with cupped hands.Zhang Lie motioned for his group of hunters to cease attacking.The soulshards that Li Hong's subordinates were offering up were relatively ordinary, and Zhang Lie had no interest in any of them. But even though he didn't want any, the rest of his group certainly did. Dozens of soulshards, all theirs in one fell swoop!Li Hong knew now that he had no choice but to surrender. He had completely and utterly lost! \"Alright, I admit defeat! I'll hand over my soulshards!\"Dozens of glowing, colorful soulshards were heaped into a pile in front of the gathered hunters' eyes, blinding Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng with their brilliance. Given their relative poverty, they hadn't ever dreamt that one hunter could possess so many soulshards.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Splitting the LootMost importantly, of these dozens of soulshards, none were of inferior quality. In fact, all of them were mutated-grade soulshards. Among these, Zhang Lie even found the soulshard of a mutated-grade blood ant.\"Thanks for the loot. Hope you enjoy the Underworld!\" With a thrust of Zhang Lie's sword, Li Hong's head sank to the ground in disbelief. He hadn't expected that, even after he handed over his soulshards, Zhang Lie would still kill him.However, a dead man's thoughts were of no consequence.Upon seeing Li Hong's death, his two subordinates, who had prostrated themselves on the ground, immediately got up and tried to flee. Unfortunately for them, Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng had snuck up behind them even before Zhang Lie killed Li Hong. If even Li Hong had died, then surely they wouldn't be allowed to live.Thus ended this one-sided slaughter.In the end, all the hunters in Li Hong's team perished, whereas a few of Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng's teammates were injured. Luckily, the injuries were minor and could be readily treated.In truth, except for the wildcard called Zhang Lie, the two teams' strength was comparable. In fact, Li Hong's side had more hunters. The reason they had suffered such overwhelming defeat was because Li Hong had been overconfident, and because Zhang Lie was simply that strong after surpassing the usual gene capacity multiple times.He scooped up all the soulshards and smiled. \"Haha, this was a good haul! Clean up the scene, and then we'll divide up the loot back in the settlement.\"Everyone started moving. Conveniently, they had a large hole already dug up for the ten corpses of Li Hong's team, and all they had to do was throw them inside and bury them.Back in the Blacksteel settlement, in a VIP suite in the Blackgold Inn, Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, Yang Ze, Li Feng, Sun Xiaowu, and Zhou Ying all looked at the unmasked Zhang Lie with varying levels of incredulity.Who would have expected that the mysterious hunter behind the silver armor would be the hunter who had been at the bottom of the gene leaderboard for so many months, Zhang Lie?They had even heard other hunters discussing rumors about him, but now\u2026The hunter who had shocked them all with his prowess, and the hunter in front of them now... reconciling the two hunters in their mind was a difficult affair.After all, it was Zhang Lie who had killed Li Hong in a one-sided fight.Had this world gone crazy? How could Zhang Lie be so strong?Then, they began to think about another affair in which Zhang Lie had been implicated, that one fateful night in the venombane glade. The Qin, Wang, and Zhou families had all suffered great losses in the aftermath, especially the Wang and Qin families, who had lost almost half their wealth just from that one incident alone.The gathered hunters shivered upon feeling Zhang Lie's glance on them.\"What, do I look that frightening?\" Zhang Lie smiled amiably, but none of them were at all relieved. This innocent-looking hunter was a living devil!\"Captain, now that you've revealed your identity to us, aren't you afraid that we'll spread\u2014\"\"Spread what? That I'm actually a very strong hunter, that I was the mastermind behind the scheme that brought the Wang and Qin families low? Or that you helped me kill Li Hong and his team? Do you think anyone would believe what you said, given my reputation in the Blacksteel settlement?\"Fang Yi gaped at Zhang Lie speechlessly. Zhang Lie was right: even if he were to tell others the truth, it seemed so outlandish that no one would believe him. After all, he had witnessed the entire fight for himself, and still he had trouble believing what he had seen.\"No one would believe what you said\u2014honestly, even if I were the one who said it, no one would believe it either. Furthermore, the fact that I'm willing to reveal my identity to all of you means that I'm prepared for whatever happens next.\"After all, those two clans do know about me, and yet I'm still here, hale and hearty! Alright, all that was in the past, and it's unrelated to any of you. Don't try to stick your nose in. Now, shall we split up the soulshards?\"Zhang Lie was quite interested in Fang Yi, so even though Fang Yi's question was rather inane, he still patiently explained himself.Then, he patted his potbellied-toad pouch and dumped a few dozen soulshards on the table. The gathered hunters glanced at each other in surprise. They knew quite well just how little they'd contributed to the fight, and they clearly hadn't expected that Zhang Lie would still be willing to split the spoils with them.\"Captain, thank you for your sincerity, but we can't take any of this from you. Honestly, if not for you, we wouldn't have managed to hunt anything at all today! Just a bit of the dreadtoad flesh is more than sufficient.\"Zhang Lie raised an eyebrow. \"Being too polite isn't a good thing, you know.\" He picked out the mutated-grade blood-ant soulshard from the pile, then announced, \"For everyone's performance today, you'll each get two soulshads. Take your pick!\"The hunters glanced at each other, waiting for someone to take the first move.It took only ten seconds before a hunter stood up.\"In that case, I'll go first!\" Sun Mengmeng was the first to choose, and she picked out two rather compatible mutated-grade fire-attuned soulshards for herself.With a broad smile on her face, she turned to Zhang Lie. \"Zhang Lie, thank you for treating us with respect. I, Sun Mengmeng, will repay you with my loyalty. If you'll have me, from today onwards, I intend to be your follower, your most reliable subordinate.\"She had made this decision quite some time ago, and Zhang Lie's actions now reaffirmed her choice.Soon, the other hunters all picked out their soulshards and expressed their intention to follow Zhang Lie. However, the last hunter left, Fang Yi, seemed to be hesitant.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: A Fledgling TeamThere appeared to be something on Fang Yi's mind keeping him from declaring his intent to follow Zhang Lie even when the other hunters had done so.Zhang Lie hadn't anticipated such a situation. He had been as sincere as he could, and it had won him the hearts of all gathered here, all but Fang Yi.Fang Yi himself was reflecting over the events of the day. From his perspective, he kept feeling as though Zhang Lie was far too friendly than he had any right to be.His and Sun Mengmeng's teams' strength was incomparable to Zhang Lie, but Zhang Lie had not only allowed them to participate in hunting a superior-grade lifeform, but also incited them to kill Li Hong's team with him.Not only that, he had been willing to share some of his spoils with them. Perhaps it could have been explained if they had long since known each other, but they hadn't been anything but strangers before this fateful day!\"Captain, please don't blame me for being cautious, but I don't understand why you're doing all this. Isn't it the first time we've met each other?\"Zhang Lie finally understood what was going through his mind. After all, who else had any idea how much Zhang Lie owed to Fang Yi? If he were in Fang Yi's position, he would likely have thought the same way.Zhang Lie turned to him and spoke seriously, \"Don't worry about it. I do have a few reasons for favoring you, but everyone else was simply at the right place at the right time. I've been thinking of building up a team, and I need two helpers to do so. Since I encountered your two groups out in the sands, I decided to test you to see if you would be a suitable fit.\"I don't intend on forcing you to do anything at all. If you don't want to work with me, you're welcome to leave after we divide up the spoils. There aren't any eyewitnesses to the Li team's murder, and unless you incriminate yourself, you should be safe from any retaliation.\"Whether or not Fang Yi stayed would be up to himself. If he were to leave, the only one who would lose out was him: Zhang Lie didn't much mind either way.\"You don't have to say anything else, Captain! I'm willing to follow you!\" Fang Yi's eventual choice didn't disappoint Zhang Lie. And since he had made up his mind, he quickly pocketed two soulshards from the pile left on the table.\"Alright. Since all of you here have decided to work with me, let me make myself clear: as long as you're all loyal to me, I'll share whatever I have with you. Believe me: you'll all be grateful for the choice you made today!\"This was Zhang Lie's anticipated outcome, and he was naturally welcoming of the new additions to his team.After Fang Yi finished selecting his soulshards, Zhang Lie kept the remainder, then took out the dreadtoad carcass from within his pouch.\"Are there any good cooks among you? Can you prepare this for consumption?\"Sun Mengmeng and Zhou Ying stepped forward. Cooking was a strength of theirs, and they were eager to demonstrate their abilities in front of their new captain.As they dragged the carcass toward the kitchen, Zhang Lie reminded them from behind, \"Be careful with its vocal pouches and tongue\u2014those will fetch quite a few points!\"\"Got it, Captain!\"Everyone was eagerly anticipating the superior gene fragments they would soon obtain.\"Captain, let me help too!\" Sun Xiaowu was so impatient that he couldn't help running into the kitchen to help his sister.Only Fang Yi, Li Feng, and Yang Ze were left in the room.Zhang Lie knew quite a bit of Fang Yi, of course. He turned to Li Feng and Yang Ze, trying to learn more about them.Yang Ze was from the Yang clan, whose stronghold was in the city of Sacred Fire on Mars. Though the Yang clan was reasonably prosperous, as a bastard, he was more or less unaffiliated with them.The Yang clan had no power in the Blacksteel settlement, and it was almost as though Yang Ze had been sent into exile. According to him, it was unlikely that the clan would care at all even if he were to perish here.Luckily, his mother had brought him up well, though he seemed to express a tendency toward depression and self-loathing.Zhang Lie made a note of this, giving him a few words of encouragement and promising to help him develop into a hunter his clan would focus its attention on.Last was Li Feng from Sichuan, who was far more ordinary. He came from an average family, was hardworking and honest, and had entered the dimensional world at eighteen in accordance with the draft.After a quick conversation, Yang Ze turned toward the television, whereas Li Feng went around inspecting the suite.Even the cheapest room in the Blackgold Inn cost at least a thousand points per day\u2014ten thousand dollars in real life!\u2014and he had never entered such a luxurious place either on Earth or the dimensional world.With everyone else distracted, only Zhang Lie and Fang Yi were left on the couch.\"Captain, can I ask you something?\" Fang Yi turned to him curiously.Zhang Lie nodded as he ordered a few side dishes to be sent to the suite.\"As far as I know, Li Hong has around twenty superior gene fragments, and you seem to have a comparable amount. And with regard to martial skill, while your techniques are impressive, your framework doesn't seem particularly high-quality. Why was the fight so one-sided?\"This was a question that he'd wondered since he witnessed the fight. From his perspective, Zhang Lie was Li Hong's equal in terms of both genes and techniques. However, Fang Yi had the impression that Zhang Lie hadn't even used his full strength in the lopsided fight against Li Hong.He had dominated in terms of strength, speed, and energy. With one simple, shallow cut, he had grasped Li Hong's life in his hands.Zhang Lie smiled. \"I'm older than he is, of course. Older and more experienced, so naturally I would have the advantage. As to your question about how I'm so much stronger than Li Hong even though we have comparable stats... all I'll say about that for now is that I have limit fragments. I'll tell all of you about limit fragments eventually, so don't guess or ask me about them now. What happens beyond that will depend on each of your choices.\"Zhang Lie's words made Fang Yi even more curious, but he obediently pressed his lips together and said nothing else.Regular genes, mutated genes, superior genes, and then supposedly pinnacle genes, but what were these limit gene fragments that Zhang Lie had mentioned?He was able to repress his curiosity, but Yang Ze, still fiddling with the television by his side, immediately scooted over when he heard the discussion.\"Captain, I heard your words too! What are these limit fragments? Are they beyond pinnacle grade?\"FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: Forming the TeamNaturally, Zhang Lie wasn't about to answer this question, at least not before he had finished planning out his team. At this point, telling them about the possibility of a framework breakthrough wasn't necessarily a good thing.Before Yang Ze could respond, Sun Mengmeng, Sun Xiaowu, and Zhou Ying had finished their preparations and were calling everyone over to eat.The hunters' eagerness meant that the table was set up in no time.The dreadtoad carcass had been so large that, even after discarding the parts that couldn't be or were too valuable to be consumed, there were enough dishes to fill the entire table. Sun Mengmeng and Zhou Ying seemed to be well-versed in a dazzling variety of cooking techniques. They had made a dozen dishes from the toad meat, each a delicacy.However, Zhang Lie still wasn't satisfied, and had supplemented this banquet with a few additional dishes from the inn itself. According to him, toad meat alone would be too monotonous. He had also ordered two flasks of wine.The trademark liquor of the Blackgold Inn was Inferno, so named for its potency. Even a hunter who boasted superior gene fragments could only consume a flask or two at most. Two flasks would be more than sufficient for the six hunters gathered here.Fang Yi set a cup of wine by everyone's plate in a fluid, practiced motion.\"Captain, no matter your reason, I, Fang Yi, will be forever grateful that you've given me such an opportunity! You've sped up our growth by at least a few months, and I dedicate this toast to you!\" He drained the cup in one fell swoop.\"Captain, we dedicate this toast to you!\" With Fang Yi taking the lead, the rest of the gathered hunters quickly followed suit.\"Alright, we're all comrades now, aren't we? There's no need for such pleasantries. I'll accept your toast!\" Zhang Lie downed his cup of wine as well. \"Now let's dig into this superior-grade feast!\"Zhang Lie motioned for everyone to get started.All the hunters dug in with gusto, all pleasantries forgotten. As Zhang Lie said, what lay in front of them was a feast of superior gene fragments, and they would be foolish to miss out now.\"Slow down, Xiaowu!\"\"Hey, Yang Ze, what're you doing? That's my piece of meat!\"\"What? It's clearly mine!\"Cheerful bickering filled the room.Yang Ze and Sun Xiaowu had fought over a small piece of toad meat so furiously that their faces had gone red, causing Zhang Lie to smile at their antics. They were originally from two different teams, and it seemed as though they were already starting to learn to get along.Of course, he was busily eating himself: he only had nineteen superior gene fragments at this point, after all.After their first cup of wine, none of the hunters refilled their cup. They were all focused on eating the food laid out in front of them. As they ate, the will of the world announced in their mind:[For consuming the flesh of a superior-grade dreadtoad, you received one superior gene fragment. Current total: 20][For consuming the flesh of a superior-grade dreadtoad, you received one superior gene fragment. Current total: 21][...total: 25]The six hunters had devoured the food in front of them within a quarter of an hour, not sparing even the dregs.Zhang Lie had obtained a total of six superior gene fragments. The other hunters had gotten more or less the same number. The unluckiest received only five, whereas Sun Mengmeng received seven, essentially the upper limit when the meat was divided among so many people.It was likely that her body naturally possessed a stronger affinity to the dreadtoad than the rest of theirs.When they finished the meal and noticed the changes to their constitution, they were all throwing admiring glances at Zhang Lie. \u00a0After all, if not for him, none of them would have been able to get any superior gene fragments so early on.Hunting for gene fragments sounded like a grand affair, but even the slightest mistake, indecision, or inattention could lead to death. Under usual circumstances, hunters much preferred to hunt safer, low-grade lifeforms. Strength wouldn't matter to them if they were dead, after all.The hunters began toasting Zhang Lie again as the mood in the suite rose to a crescendo.\"Captain, doesn't our team need a name? How about my old team's name, Typhoon?\" Fang Yi, tipsy and slightly drunk, made a suggestion.Before Zhang Lie could respond, however, Sun Mengmeng flapped her hands at him. \"Nonsense! It's a new team, so we need a new name! Captain, come up with one!\"The other hunters clearly agreed with Sun Mengmeng.Zhang Lie had actually been considering this question. \"What do you think about calling our team Zenith?\"\"Zenith?\"\"Team Zenith!\"\"Captain, tell us the truth! Does this have anything to do with the limit fragments you were talking about earlier?\"\"Limit fragments? Are you drunk, Yang Ze? I've never heard of such a thing!\"Except for him and Fang Yi, no one else knew anything about these mysterious limit fragments. However, Yang Ze didn't back down. He stared at Zhang Lie, waiting patiently for a response. Fang Yi did the same.Upon noticing how serious he and Yang Ze were, Zhang Lie nodded. \"That's right. The reason I've chosen the name Zenith naturally has something to do with these so-called limit fragments. Furthermore, as long as you're all willing, you'll be able to get your own limit fragments soon!\"Fang Yi and Yang Ze both brightened at the news, whereas the other hunters just looked at Zhang Lie in stupefaction.\"Captain, what limit fragments? I haven't heard anything about them!\" Sun Mengmeng cried out.Zhang Lie smiled mysteriously. \"This is still top secret for now, and all I can tell you is that these limit fragments will elevate you above all other hunters.\"Even Fang Yi and Yang Ze hadn't expected that these limit fragments would be such a big deal.Although they had only known Zhang Lie for a short period of time, he had never claimed something he couldn't accomplish. To be elevated above all other hunters... was such a thing even possible?They initially expected that this \"limit fragment\" business was just a little trick that their captain knew about, but it seemed as though this was top-secret information! Furthermore, Zhang Lie didn't seem unwilling to tell them about it\u2014it just wasn't the right time yet.Zhang Lie smiled as he saw everyone's curiosity piqued. \"Would you all like to know how to obtain these limit fragments?\"The hunters all nodded their heads fervently, like little chicks pecking at grain.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: First MissionUpon seeing the hunters' eager faces, Zhang Lie smiled. \"Simple: just stay in my team for two months and let me observe your loyalty and latent talent. If I find you suitable, you'll meet me in the city of Ning and formally join Team Zenith. Then, I'll teach you how to exceed your own limits and obtain limit fragments.\"The hunters gaped at him in disbelief. They had expected that they would need to undergo all sorts of trials and tribulations to obtain such a secret, but was Zhang Lie going to give it away so easily?\"Captain, are you sure you're not just drunk?\" This time, even Sun Mengmeng didn't dare believe that Zhang Lie was serious. After all, considering the magnitude of the secret, Zhang Lie's selection process was almost like a joke.\"I haven't been with you guys for a long time, but when have I ever lied to you?\" Zhang Lie grinned, no sign of drunkenness apparent on his face.\"You mean it?\"\"Of course I mean it!\"Zhang Lie hadn't given them any reason to doubt him, and the hunters forced themselves to accept this reality.\"Captain, we've all heard you make this promise, so you'd better not renege on it in the future!\" Fang Yi exclaimed.The gathered hunters all made up their minds to give a good showing in the hunts to come, so as to gain Zhang Lie's favor.Zhang Lie raised a cup in toast. \"In that case, I'll wish you all luck in passing my inspection.\"\"Of course!\"Clink! They each downed another cup of fiery liquor.Because the toad meat was all finished, the hunters could now consume the rest of the feast in moderation, chatting and laughing as they did so. During the feast, Zhang Lie had learned a little about all six of them.Sun Mengmeng, from a middle-class family in the capital; cute and passionate, but surprisingly logical in decision-making.Sun Xiaowu, from the capital; Sun Mengmeng's cousin; resilient and diligent, with a keen eye; a fanatic for genetic techniques.Zhou Ying, from a middle-class family in the south; attentive but taciturn, with a fair appearance.Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, Yang Ze, Li Feng, Sun Xiaowu, and Zhou Ying had all left a rather good impression on Zhang Lie after the feast. Once all the food was consumed, Zhang Lie gave them their first mission.\"Since you're all eager to get to work, I have a task for each of you. \u00a0The Void Cup's about to begin, and there's a very important prize for me this time around. As a result, I intend on personally participating in the Void Cup. In the next three months, I'll have to try to fill up my superior gene fragments to capacity. You understand what I mean, don't you?\"The hunters nodded earnestly.\"The Void Cup! It's something hunters like us can only dream about, but if it's you, Captain, I'm sure you'll do well. Don't worry. Within these two months, we'll try to scout as many superior-grade lifeforms as we can. Focus on cultivating and mastering your genetic techniques, and leave the rest to us.\" Fang Yi spoke for the rest of the team.Sun Mengmeng and the others indicated that they would do their best to support Zhang LieZhang Lie smiled. \"What do you mean, something you can only dream about? I'm not the only one who will enter. I need quite a lot of resources, so all of you have to enter as well, and you have to aim as high up in the ranking as you can.\"...they would be participating as well?In the past, even the weakest competitor who had participated in the Void Cup had at least eighty superior gene fragments, and they had mastered at least three high-grade techniques.And Zhang Lie was even expecting them to place high in the ranking too! What could they accomplish? They weren't even at the mutated gene capacity yet!Perhaps it would be somewhat easier to deal with mutated-grade lifeforms now that they had a few superior gene fragments and useful mutated-grade soulshards, but they still needed some time, didn't they? And what about their genetic techniques? Of them all, only Yang Ze even had a pinnacle-grade technique.Wouldn't they just get weeded out in the first round of the competition?\"Captain\u2014\"\"Don't worry. I don't intend for any of you to be sandbags, and I promise I'll train each of you well before the competition. Furthermore, even if you do end up as sandbags, surely you see that entering the Void Cup at all would be a great boon to your future.\"After all, while you'll be in direct combat against other hunters, your lives will certainly be protected during the competition. Is this a safeguard that you'd have out in the wilderness of the dimensional world?\" Zhang Lie broke Sun Mengmeng off, anticipating her comment.Sun Mengmeng thought for a moment, then nodded firmly. \"Yes, Captain!\"The other hunters glanced at Zhang Lie, looking forward to training under him. Ever since their first meeting, Zhang Lie had given off the impression of being a truly strong and mysterious hunter, one that they would give anything to learn from.\"I've recorded here some known locations for a few superior-grade lifeforms, as well as a few remarks on their behavior and habits. Over the next few weeks, scout them out and figure out a plan for hunting them down. We'll begin in six weeks.\"Zhang Lie retrieved a booklet from the potbellied-toad pouch and laid it on the table.Fang Yi picked it up and flipped through it, only to find specifics for forty to fifty superior-grade lifeforms listed in agonizing detail. Most of them were creatures that Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng hadn't ever heard of, let alone seen.Zhang Lie seemed even more mysterious than ever.He left them no further explanation. After handing them the booklet, Team Zenith's first feast came to an end. Subsequently, Zhang Lie handed Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng fifty thousand points for their scouting, got their contact information, and dismissed them.They hadn't had much to drink, and although a few of the hunters were tipsy, none were drunk.Zhang Lie prized a clear head over anything else, and while he'd tasted all sorts of excellent wine in his past life and present, it had never been to the point of drunkenness. After all, it seemed far more comfortable to drink in moderation than in excess.Once the other hunters had left, he headed out of his suite, dressed entirely in black again, and began to wander around the Blacksteel settlement. By this point, news of Li Hong and his team's disappearance had likely spread to the Li clan, and they were surely going to make a move.Zhang Lie had just ambled over to the settlement gates when he saw Li Jin rush out of the settlement with a large number of hunters. At the same time, the usual crowd gathered by the gates started to gossip.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: A Mischievous Girl\"What's going on with the Li clan?\"\"You haven't heard the gossip yet?!\"\"Gossip? What gossip?\"\"You really don't know? Someone killed Li Hong!\"\"What Li Hong? The one who's in the blackwater sands all day?\"\"Yes, him! Apparently, his entire team was wiped out by some rival team of hunters!\"\"Really? That's excellent news! Who did it?\"\"If I knew, would I still be here?\"\"Haha, what a godsend!\"\"Isn't that so? How many teams did Li Hong bully into submission in that area, hundreds? He deserved to die!\"\"This has to be the best piece of news I've heard all day!\"\"It looks like we won't have to be as wary of heading to the blackwater sands now, do we?\"\"Aren't you all naive? Yes, Li Hong's gone, but soon you'll see a Zhang Hong, or Wang Hong, or Liu Hong pop up! Now that the area's not under Li Hong's control, some other tyrant will quickly take over. Just you watch!\"\"You're not wrong, but surely after Li Hong's death they'll be more wary and less tyrannical, won't they?\"\"That's right! Those hunters from large clans fear death much more than us nameless hunters. Now that Li Hong's dead, they'll surely go easier on us, but as for the hunter who killed him...\"\"The Li clan just announced that they're going to review all the hunters who were at the blackwater sands today\u2014they're willing to kill innocent suspects just to get at the true culprit!\"\"Heh, are they? I'm staying right here in the settlement: they can try to kill me if they want.\"\"I'm sure there's no need to worry: who doesn't know what the Li clan is like? If that hunter was daring enough to kill Li Hong, I'm sure they would have a plan for evading capture.\"\"That's true, isn't it?\"The gathered hunters were far more sympathetic to Li Hong's killer than Li Hong himself. After all, the Li clan\u2014and Li Hong in particular\u2014was widely vilified within the settlement for being too arrogant and domineering.Zhang Lie hadn't heard any rumors about him or Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng's teams, so he whistled as he walked away. They'd cleaned up the scene of the murder well enough that there were hardly any traces left behind.Li Jin might not even be able to find where they'd buried the corpse, and even if he did, nothing would link that corpse to them. It had been too long since Li Hong had died, after all.And Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng would hardly be suspects: teams like theirs were far too weak to pose any sort of threat to Li Hong.However, just as Zhang Lie was turning to leave, a small hand tapped his shoulder.\"I smelled you from quite a distance away. What are you doing skulking around here?\" Zhang Lie turned to see Chu Xun, from the Chu clan.What was she doing here? \"Girl, aren't you being a little too familiar? You'd better not push it, or I'll tell your brother to beat you up!\"\"My brother, beat me up? If he touches me, my grandfather will certainly skin him! There's no one around who would dare beat me up!\"She was, in all certainty, a spoiled brat.Zhang Lie clicked his tongue. \"What do you want?\"\"Nothing much. I'm a little bored, so won't you go shopping with me?\" Chu Xun beamed.Zhang Lie shook his head. \"I'm very busy, and I have no time to play games with you!\"\"Umm, how about this, if you can't play with me, then how about I play with you? Bring me where you're headed.\"Zhang Lie shook his head again. \"We might have met once before, but surely you wouldn't leave the settlement with a hunter you barely know.\"\"I don't care! If you don't promise to bring me out, I won't help you out with that favor you wanted!\" She scowled.\"You...\"How could this girl be such a nuisance?!After thinking it over for a moment, Zhang Lie didn't see too large an issue with bringing her with him. He was only intending to head to the Bloodcrystal Valley to harvest some more blood whiskers, which wasn't too far from the settlement.\"I might consider bringing you out with me, but you have to promise to listen to my every command. Otherwise, if you die, I'm not letting your clan blame me.\"She was naturally overjoyed to see Zhang Lie change his mind. \"Don't worry, don't worry! I promise I'll listen to your every word!\"\"You'd better not forget your words when we're outside. Have your guards send word to your brother: tell him where you're going, and tell him that I won't guarantee your safety. You'll be responsible for your own actions. Do you understand?\"Chu Xun nodded fervently and beckoned her guards over.In truth, under these circumstances, what guard would feel safe leaving their charge with a strange, cloaked hunter? One guard was sent back to bring news to the Chu clan, but the other three tailed Zhang Lie and Chu Xun out.As a reincarnated hunter with decades of experience, Zhang Lie easily discovered his tails. Upon passing through a small, dense forest, he managed to shake them off.After half an hour, Zhang Lie and Chu Xun arrived at the hill overlooking the Bloodcrystal Valley. Zhang Lie hadn't intended on bringing the girl up with him. He was planning on leaving her at the base of the hill, but she refused to comply.She even claimed to be a gliding expert, one who could easily handle gliding from this height. As a wind-attuned hunter, it was true that she likely wouldn't die from a fall here.Zhang Lie had no choice but to bring her up to the hill with him.\"I'm fine with you harvesting those blood whiskers, but you have to hand them to me, do you understand?\"Chu Xun nodded seriously, but Zhang Lie felt like he couldn't let down his guard given her sparkling eyes.\"No, no, I changed my mind. Stay right there!\"\"What? How can you be like that? You promised me that you'll let me try it! No, I'm heading down!\"Amidst a gust of wind, she leapt down from the hill. Her green wind-attuned genetic energy formed a slipstream behind her as she propelled herself down the hill.Zhang Lie had no choice but to chase after her, activating his white-grub soulshard and morphing it into a gliding suit.Wind-attuned hunters had a natural advantage when it came to anything dealing with the air. If there were no obstacles or disruptions around, the girl would likely be able to glide down safely.\"Ah\u2014Ahhh!\" However, just as Zhang Lie relaxed, she let out a shrill cry.She was being harassed by a few blood ants, and her casual glide had morphed into the disastrous bumbling of a one-winged mosquito.Zhang Lie grumbled, but quickly shot after her.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Impending TroubleWith a few quick slashes from Venombane, Zhang Lie bisected the blood ants on Chu Xun's body.\"Be more careful!\" he admonished.Before she could respond, he glided past her. Compared to her, Zhang Lie's gliding required far more skill, but he seemed even more adept at it than she was. As he shot silver strands out of his palms, he rapidly flew past the opening of several of the caves and masterfully harvested the blood whiskers there.Chu Xun, having been rescued once, became much more serious about the affair, and she attentively watched Zhang Lie's harvesting technique.Although she was mischievous, she was also quick-witted, and was able to obtain quite a number of blood whiskers during the glide down the hill\u2014even more than Zhang Lie had collected during his first attempt.\"Alright, hand me what you have!\"As soon as they landed, Zhang Lie extended a palm toward her. She immediately handed over the blood whiskers she had gathered. Of course, she wasn't being perfectly honest: she had kept one or two stalks in her pouch for herself.Zhang Lie guessed that she would do so, but he didn't much care about one or two stalks. Furthermore, after this harvest, it wouldn't matter whether or not the Chu clan learned of the blood whiskers' potency.They glided down thrice more before Chu Xun lost all interest in the matter entirely, and she indicated that she would simply stay on the hill and watch Zhang Lie from now on.Zhang Lie was very glad that she was finally deciding to do so: after all, every time she glided down with him, she seemed to cause even more trouble. How could Zhang Lie not be relieved that she was planning to stop?As the winds blew around the hill, Zhang Lie began to gather the remaining blood whiskers in the Bloodcrystal Valley rapidly. As his strength grew, so did his efficiency. Without the girl disrupting him, Zhang Lie shot from cave to cave, almost seeming to leave afterimages with how quickly he moved.While he was busy harvesting his blood whiskers, Li Jin, who had arrived at the blackwater sands, found Li Hong's corpse and was informed of a mysterious black-cloaked man who could be implicated in the murder.A storm of revenge was brewing on the horizon.Now that he had a target, Li Jin immediately announced a bounty for information on this mysterious man across the entire settlement. Anyone who could provide information about this man would be able to obtain a thousand points from the Li corporation.Under normal circumstances, this bounty would go unclaimed: Zhang Lie was a careful hunter, and there wasn't anything particularly distinctive about him. There were lots of hunters who went around in black cloaks. How could the hunters in the settlement distinguish among them?However, Zhang Lie had been seen with the youngest daughter of the main branch of the Chu clan, Chu Xun. She was famed for her mischievous personality, and ordinary hunters would naturally keep an eye out for her so as to be able to get out of her way.Many had seen them leaving the settlement together, and the Li clan's search could therefore be narrowed down.Afterwards, amidst the temptation of all sorts of rewarding bounties, teams of hunters began to deduce and analyze where the pair could have gone.In the best room in the Blackgold Inn, Li Jin sat waiting on a throne-like seat.\"Are his whereabouts known now?\"\"Yes, Head! He's in the Bloodcrystal Valley!\" his right-hand man answered.\"Li Hong was a useless hunter, but he's still a member of the Li clan, after all. We need to let the hunters in this settlement know what happens to those who dare go against the Li clan. Lead our best team of hunters out to the Bloodcrystal Valley. You know what to do: afterwards, hang his head outside the settlement gates for seven days as a warning to others!\"Li Jin might have seemed amiable from the outside, but he was actually a cold and cruel man.\"Yes, Head! In that case, what should we do with Chu Xun?\"Li Jin scowled. \"Take her down if necessary, but make sure not to harm her. She's the prized granddaughter of the Chu head, and we can't touch her!\"\"Understood, Head!\" He was right about to lead his men out when Li Jin called him back,\"Wait! With that girl around, I don't trust you to handle it. I'll lead the team myself.\"As the Li clan mobilized, Chu Feng, who had just returned to the settlement after a day of hunting, heard about what happened to his sister almost as soon as he returned.\"What? She left with that mysterious hunter? And he even said that he wasn't going to guarantee her safety?! Why didn't you tail her?!\" Chu Feng yelled at his guards, but they, having failed in their duty, didn't dare to rebuke him.\"Where did they go?\"\"The Bloodcrystal Valley, young master!\"\"The Bloodcrystal Valley? Forget it, punishing any of you now won't do any good. What are you waiting for? Gather a team of hunters and head there immediately!\"The Feng scouts just reported that he's the fellow who killed Li Hong, and that the Li clan's heading straight for him! Chu Xun's with him, so she might be in danger. What do you think will happen to you if she gets hurt? Even I wouldn't be able to protect you then!\"Chu Feng's two guards paled as they were reminded of what the Chu head was like when he was angry, and they rushed off in a gust of wind.With both the Li and Chu clans mobilizing, the tension in the Blacksteel settlement reached an apex.Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, and the others, who had left for an inn after the feast, naturally heard the news. The six of them sat before each other.\"What should we do? They're all going after the captain!\" Fang Yi was the first to speak, his tone implying that he wasn't going to sit still and wait.\"What else can we do? We have to find him and help him out!\" Li Feng, who tended to be shy, gathered the courage to say what they were all thinking.\"Right, we have to help! He even shared a few superior gene fragments with us, so how can we ditch him when he's in trouble?\" Yang Ze added.\"We certainly can't just sit here, but given how weak we are, we won't be able to handle a direct confrontation either.\" Sun Mengmeng identified the key problem.\"Sis, we don't have any time to waste!\" Sun Xiaowu muttered worriedly.\"Let me think for a moment. It's exactly in such situations that we need to be careful about how we act. You know that our captain isn't an easy fellow to deal with, and even if the Li and Chu clans work together, I doubt they'll be able to deal with him. As for us, we need to come up with a plan. If we head there without a good plan, we could well expose ourselves to retaliation, and we might mess up our captain's plan as well.\"Sun Mengmeng's analysis was spot on. If they were to rush there the moment they heard the news, they might end up more hindrance than help.\"Since they're headed for the captain, they must suspect that he's the killer. Why don't we try to muddle the waters a bit?\" Fang Yi suggested.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: Targeted Clash\"Muddle the waters? You mean, attack the Li clan now while they're busy chasing after him?\" Sun Mengmeng asked for clarification.Fang Yi nodded. \"That's right. However, we have to do so under the guise of our captain!\"\"Under his guise? Isn't our captain's identity a secret? How can we pretend to be him?\" Yang Ze seemed quite confused.Fang Yi explained, \"We might know his identity, but no one else in the settlement does, do they? To them, Li Hong's killer is a man cloaked in black and skilled at stealth! Can't you pretend to be such a hunter? Can't I? Even Sun Mengmeng could!\"\"What do you mean, even I can? I bet I could portray his likeness better than either of you with some careful makeup!\" Sun Mengmeng scowled.\"You mean, we should all disguise ourselves as the captain and strike at the Li clan while they're all gone, so as to draw attention away from him?\" Yang Ze finally seemed to understand.Sun Mengmeng smiled. \"That's right. It sounds like a simple plan, but the execution will be quite difficult. If we're ever caught off-guard, we might easily die from the Li clan's retaliation. As a result, we'll need a careful plan of attack. I already have a few ideas in mind, but since we're short on time, let's talk as we head out. Pack your bags and we'll meet at the door!\"Moments later, six black-clad men suddenly emerged from the settlement gates. Their outer appearance made them look quite similar to Zhang Lie.Back in the Bloodcrystal Valley, Zhang Lie, sitting with Chu Xun near the top of the hill, was happily roasting a blood ant. After a few hours of gliding, he had harvested essentially all the blood whiskers in the Bloodcrystal Valley.The blood ant smelled so good that she was salivating.\"Hey, Blackie, are you done yet? I'm hungry!\" Her strange nickname for Zhang Lie left much to be desired, but given her status as the prized grandchild of the Chu head, he couldn't say much about it. He handed her a skewer from above the fire pit.She bit into the crispy ant meat with gusto, her lips glistening with oil.Just then, Zhang Lie discovered a horde of hunters from the southwest heading in their direction. He didn't pay them much mind at first, thinking that they were from some clan who had decided to hunt the blood ants, but when they were near the bottom of the hill, Zhang Lie spotted Li Jin amidst the crowd.Li Jin? Wasn't he in the middle of investigating Li Hong's death? What was he doing here? Zhang Lie glanced at the hunters beneath him, then at Chu Xun by his side, instantly understanding the situation. Of course, they had to be here for him!Instead of panicking, however, he smiled.By that time, they were making such a fuss that even Chu Xun had noticed.\"Blackie, what's going on down there? Isn't that Li Jin and his team?\"\"I suspect they're here for me. Well, I won't be able to accompany you anymore. If I'm not wrong, you should have a venombane-scorpion soulshard on you. Why don't you find a place to hide and get ready to watch the show?\"There was no trace of urgency in Zhang Lie's voice.\"For you? Why, what did you do? Ah\u2014you couldn't have been the one who killed his brother, Li Hong?!\"Zhang Lie didn't deny it. \"He deserved it. Well, go hide! I won't be able to spare you any attention later.\"\"No, there's no need. Li Jin wouldn't dare to touch me, or he would\u2014\"\"Stop talking nonsense, and never joke around with your life on the line. It's a terrible habit to pick up, and you'll be much safer if you just hide!\" She was quite a stubborn character, but Zhang Lie would tolerate no refusal. He seemed like he would beat her up if she were to rebut him again.She didn't know why, but she, who feared almost nothing in the world, instinctively backed down. Pursing her lips, she leapt up into a nearby tree and then turned invisible.Zhang Lie sat back down and continued enjoying his ant skewers.Footsteps pittered and pattered around him as Li Jin's large group split in two. One group blocked the valley off from below, and the other, with Li Jin at the lead, headed straight for him. By the time he had finished consuming a blood ant, Li Jin was only fifty meters away.\"What laudable efficiency!\" Zhang Lie praised. \"You found me so quickly after Li Hong's death.\"He tossed the skewer in his hand aside.\"You bastard, you won't be getting away today! Reveal your identity and hand over all your soulshards, and I might grant you a painless death. Otherwise, I'll make you regret being born!\"\"You think someone like you deserves to know my name, to hand over my soulshards? You'll make me regret being born? What a joke!\"Zhang Lie spat on Li Jin's shoes.\"Li Hong deserved to die. If you back down now, I'll spare you on account of the upcoming Void Cup! Otherwise, the five clans of the Blacksteel settlement might soon become four, you understand?\"\"Haha! You, a lone hunter, capable of bringing down the Li clan? What a farce! Today, I'll show you what it means to be dominated by absolute strength! Charge! Destroy him!\"Zhang Lie's brash words had completely enraged Li Jin. On his command, his gathered hunters shot toward Zhang Lie like arrows loosed from a bow.Zhang Lie leapt down from the hill.\"You think I haven't planned for this? Ranged attackers, prepare to loose!\" With Li Jin's shout, arrows brimming with all colors of genetic energy shot toward Zhang Lie, forming what seemed like a multicolored net ready to entrap him.Of course, Zhang Lie anticipated this. He curled his arms around his body and began to twist rapidly as he went into a dive, repelling the projectiles with the force of the wind around him. Only a rare few made it past the wind barrier and onto his white-grub armor, but they had been sapped of most of their momentum and were all but harmless.Zhang Lie's speed was so extreme that, after the first wave of ranged attacks, he had already flown out of range. As he glided over the largest cave in the valley, where the strongest blood ants were located, he threw a little black and red object inside.Qoob's ThoughtsThank you for reading!

    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Blood Ant SwarmA gigantic explosion rocked the entire valley, and the shrill screech of ants filled the air. The blood ants of the Bloodcrystal Valley were completely enraged, and they swarmed out of each and every cave.At the same time, Zhang Lie, who was still gliding in the air, seemed to vanish from sight.\"A stealth-type soulshard!\" Li Jin's face turned ugly: he realized what Zhang Lie was trying to do. But since he was here with all his elites, how could he just let Zhang Lie retreat? He would make a mockery of himself if he were to do so!\"Block the valley entrance and spread flash powder everywhere. Trap him inside the valley\u2014we'll see how long he can hide!\"Flash powder was quickly tossed into the air upon Li Jin's orders, but it didn't have any effect. Zhang Lie truly seemed to have disappeared.At the mouth of the valley, the rampaging blood ants, led by a superior-grade blood ant, clashed with hunters of the Li clan.\"Heh, do you think you can kill us just with this swarm of ants? With our numbers, the superior-grade blood ant will be no more than an additional reward for our trouble! You won't leave this valley alive!\" Li Jin's shout boomed through the entire valley. Zhang Lie, stealthed by a secluded crag, naturally ignored his words.However, just because he ignored it didn't mean that other creatures would\u2014for instance, the rampaging superior-grade blood ant, furious that its cave had been partially destroyed.Upon hearing Li Jin's shout, it shot a blood arrow toward him.\"Shield!\" Li Jin yelled out. The elites surrounding him immediately used their shielding techniques, protecting Li Jin and his vicinity in a dense, multicolored barrier formed from overlapping shields.The barrier and blood arrow both exploded as they came in contact with each other, and Li Jin hadn't moved at all.His elites were comparable to those subordinates that he had brought with him to the venombane glade. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been so confident as to proclaim that he would kill the entire swarm of ants.The superior-grade blood ant, the size of a small mountain, rushed toward Li Jin when it saw that its long-ranged attack had failed. Its pincers were the size of polearms, its legs sharp and as hard as steel, its translucent wings shot through with blood-red demarcations, and its gigantic, bulbous eyes crimson with anger.\"Defend!\" Li Jin shouted again. The blood ant's blood-red genetic energy clashed with Li Jin's team's multicolored energy, leading to a huge explosion.Dozens of bodies were knocked up into the air in the aftermath. Before the hunters could react, the blood ant cut them apart with its pincers.\"Don't try to face it head-on! Surround it and slowly exhaust its energy! Where's the debuff team? Attack!\" Li Jin yelled out.A small group of hunters wearing unusual pieces of armor began to approach the blood ant carefully. The rest of Li Jin's elites began to attack and harass the blood ant, occupying much of its attention.However, the blood ant rapidly shot out another blood arrow. At point-blank range, several of the elites were pierced by the arrow without being able to defend against the technique at all. Their bodies immediately began to crystallize, forming four blood statues at the top of the hill.Li Jin had only ever read about the superior-grade blood ant; he'd never seen it in person, and he hadn't expected it would be so difficult to deal with. It had tough chitin, frightening close-combat abilities, a piercing long-ranged technique, a 360-degree field of vision, and the sharp senses of a bug-type lifeform. With the multiplicative enhancement afforded by its superior-grade nature, it really had no weak points.However, Li Jin couldn't take back his words now: if he were to retreat, he would have lost half a dozen elite hunters for nothing.\"Now! Use the astral web!\" Li Jin commanded, the moment the blood ant tried to launch another blood arrow.As he did so, the hunters who had spread out around the blood ant tossed a web into the air, covering the blood ant within it. The moment the web landed on the blood ant's chitin, it began to screech, and the tough chitin began to steam where it touched the web.Each silver strand behaved like a scorching-hot steel wire. The blood ant's movement was severely restricted. It tried to curl up its body, as though it were immensely fearful of this web.The astral web was woven by the natural predator of these blood ants: the astral weaver. This was a web from a superior-grade astral weaver, which Li Jin had procured at great expense. Allegedly, it would be able to restrain a large variety of bug-type lifeforms. The truth of that was playing out right before his eyes.Li Jin wasn't about to give up such an opportunity. As he spread his arms, a magnificent bow and shadowy arrow emerged amidst the glow of genetic energy. The bow was as tall as he was, with a radiant glow that made it obvious that it derived from a superior-grade soulshard.On the other hand, the shadowy arrow was so dark that it seemed to be sucking up the light all around it, evoking a primal fear from the gathered hunters. It was also derived from a superior-grade soulshard\u2014a consumable one, which boasted absolute power for one instant in time.Li Jin would secure this kill in one shot!\"[Black-Winged Deicide]!\"Li Jin drew the bow to its maximum extent. As he released it, an umbral shadow, so fast it seemed illusory, launched toward the blood ant.And at that moment, the superior-grade blood ant, curled up and defending itself against the astral web, suddenly stood straight up. Sensing the threat of death, it immediately used the one technique at its disposal: [Bloodbath].Its exoskeleton erupted in blood-red flames, burning the astral web to cinders.However, by the time it freed itself, the shadow was already right by its head.Two blood arrows shot out from its body. It let out a grating screech as the blood-red flames covered its pincers, then swiped at the shadowy arrow directly in front of it.\"Amazing, a clash of superior-grade techniques! Blackie didn't lie to me: hiding really did turn out to be safe and interesting!\" As Chu Xun mumbled to herself, the air at the top of the hill seemed to compress and fold into itself, before exploding in so extreme a manner that it sent tremors all the way down the hill.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: Quick ReflexesThe world seemed to erupt in black and red.Chu Xun, hiding a fair distance away, whooped in amazement.As the commotion settled, a screech emerged from amidst the dust, and beams of red light shot straight toward Li Jin.\"Shield\u2014\" Li Jin, who had used the majority of his genetic energy in that one blow, was in a weakened state, and would have been unable to block the blow on his own.Another multilayered barrier sprung up around him, but this one was far weaker than the one before. It broke apart almost as soon as those beams of blood struck it, unable to block the blood arrows that had been consecrated in the blood ant's lifeblood.At the same time, the superior-grade blood ant, whose pincers had been smashed apart, whose head was half-caved in, skittered out of the dust toward Li Jin.Three unlucky attackers were quickly cut apart. Even so, Li Jin's elites didn't back down. Right before them was a heavily wounded superior-grade lifeform\u2014of course they would charge forward!If they were able to land the finishing blow, they would get a great boon from the clan, and even perhaps a little of its flesh.Unfortunately, they underestimated the strength of a superior-grade [Bloodbath], and a dozen hunters died in the melee.\"Spread out and stall it! It won't be able to last for too long!\" Li Jin shouted. He was an adept commander: [Bloodbath] was designed for head-on attacks, and if Li Jin were to be blinded by greed and sent his elites charging forward to land the finishing blow, they would surely succumb to the blood ant's last stand.However, if they were to take advantage of their numerical superiority to harass the superior-grade blood ant until its [Bloodbath] wore off, Li Jin could easily claim the kill without any unnecessary losses.Li Jin was intelligent, but the blood ant wasn't unintelligent, either.After killing a dozen of his hunters and sensing that the duration of [Bloodbath] was almost over, the blood ant thought to retreat. It tried to skitter back to the Bloodcrystal Valley, but it was too late.\"You think you can run now? Ha! Throw another astral web over it!\" Li Jin shouted in glee. It was time for the harvest! He brandished a golden polearm in front of him as he rushed down from the hill.Another astral web appeared, tangling up the blood ant. It cried out in agony and anger, and countless mutated-grade blood ants, like an ocean of red, emerged from the valley. Unfortunately, they were too slow and too weak for Li Jin's elites, and could hardly hope to save the superior-grade blood ant.\"[Radiant Slash]!\" Genetic energy extended the blade of Li Jin's polearm until it was seven or eight meters tall, then swiped down with immutable force.With a screech, the superior-grade blood ant, weakened after its use of [Bloodbath], crashed to the ground. As the golden energy-blade penetrated its body, a large piece of its carapace fell off.Then came the steel of the actual blade, reinforced with superior-grade materials. It left a huge gash in the blood ant's body, but at the same time, the blood ant, which seemed to have given up retaliating completely, suddenly shot a blood arrow at Li Jin.The blood arrow was an extremely rapid attack, and even Li Jin wouldn't be able to dodge it at close range.However, Li Jin had anticipated this last-ditch effort. The moment the blood arrow appeared, a sturdy, intricate tortoiseshell shield appeared in Li Jin's hands. It was so large that it almost covered Li Jin's body completely. From its intricacy and majesty, it was obvious that it was also derived from a superior-grade soulshard.As the young head of the Li clan, Li Jin naturally had all manner of superior-grade soulshards.With a dull thud, the blood arrow was unable to penetrate the shield, but the force of the blow was beyond Li Jin's expectations. He stumbled back a few steps, and a trickle of blood dripped down his lips.Li Jin was somewhat injured, but he didn't much care. He smiled in glee: that was likely the superior-grade blood ant's final retaliatory blow. Now that he had overcome it, he would be able to reap its rewards.Unfortunately, his dreams were about to be dashed.The moment Li Jin moved his shield aside, he saw a black shadow and a faint purple glimmer. His eyes widened. It was the hunter who had killed Li Hong! He was right here! All his attention had been devoted to the fight against the blood ant, and Li Jin had temporarily forgotten about Zhang Lie.Who would be crazy enough to wait right by the blood ant's side until he was about to strike his finishing blow?! This clearly wasn't something Li Jin had anticipated.Regardless of Li Jin's thoughts, Zhang Lie's blade was coming right for him.Li Jin barely blocked it with his polearm, but his right cheek was still grazed by the glancing blow.The blow gave him some measure of his opponent's strength, and his first instinct was to retreat: after all, he had suffered some injuries from the fight against the blood ant, and a prolonged fight would be disadvantageous to him.Unexpectedly, Zhang Lie also retreated.Li Jin was confused by his opponent's actions until the will of the world announced in his mind, [You participated in the successful kill of a superior-grade blood ant. By consuming the flesh of the superior-grade blood ant, you may receive one to ten superior gene fragments.]As the superior-grade blood ant drew its final breath, a ruby-like soulshard found its way to the black-clad man's palm.\"Thanks for the soulshard!\" With a cheery tone that sent angry shivers through Li Jin's body, Zhang Lie patted the superior-grade blood ant's carcass and vanished with it from Li Jin's sight.\"Just you wait! If I don't mince you to pieces today, I'll renounce my name!\"His face was such a deep red that it was shocking that he didn't explode right then and there.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Diversions and Distractions\"Bombard the area!\" Under Li Jin's command, waves of energy spread through the area where Zhang Lie had been.Unfortunately, the attacks were to no avail. The veins of Li Jin's forehead throbbed as he glanced all around him, but regardless of how angry he was, it was clear that today's mission was a complete failure.Not only had Zhang Lie managed to escape despite Li Jin's overwhelming numerical superiority, he had even snatched away the superior-grade lifeform that Li Jin had spent so much effort trying to kill!The Li clan had suffered grievous losses, but the final reward had all gone to Zhang Lie! If he were to let Zhang Lie escape now, the entire Li clan would become a laughing-stock. Li Jin had no choice but to dedicate even more manpower to the search.\"Block off the entire valley and perform an exhaustive search of the grounds. Don't let any living creature pass you by!\" Li Jin's voice was rather loud, as though he weren't afraid that the black-clad man would overhear his plans.In truth, under these circumstances, it didn't matter whether or not he could: Li Jin's plan was the simplest, but also most direct and effective, approach. If even an exhaustive search weren't enough to hunt down the other party, Li Jin would have no further recourse.The Li elites on the hill systematically started scouting the area, whereas those in the valley left carnage in their wake as they pushed further inside the valley in search of Zhang Lie.What Li Jin didn't know was that, while all his elites were in the Bloodcrystal Valley, several locations outside the Blacksteel settlement and under Li control were under attack.The blue-squirrel stream was located in a mountainous region by the southeastern side of the Blacksteel settlement, so named for the blue-tailed squirrels that were commonly found around it, and was the closest territory controlled by the Li clan in that direction.These blue-tailed squirrels were generally regular-grade and possessed relatively weak combat abilities. However, their soulshards would dramatically increase a hunter's agility, and were therefore in high demand. As a result, the Li clan had taken over the area.Under usual circumstances, there would be heavy security around the region, but at that moment it was barely guarded.A few figures outside the stream were using a pair of binoculars to determine the strength of the remaining guards.\"Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, you were both right! There aren't any elites around here right now!\" Yang Ze cackled in glee.As Sun Mengmeng had predicted, Li Jin's mobilization order would bring together the Li elites and leave the areas they controlled under scant security.The Li clan controlled quite a few territories around the settlement, so it was still likely that there would be some areas more heavily guarded than others, but both Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng had chosen to head to this particular spot.It was clear that they had made the right decision.\"Don't get too excited yet. The area's not under heavy guard, but there are still quite a lot of hunters from the Li clan around. Why don't you consider how we're going to proceed?\" Sun Mengmeng replied, her tone casual, as though she had already devised a plan.\"With our strength, do we need a strategy at all? Can't we just head in there and kill them all? The six of us can attack them head-on!\" Yang Ze's words had Fang Yi rapping him on the head almost instantly.\"You fool! If we do that, what do you think the Li hunters will report to their clan? Something like 'A mysterious team of hunters raided the territory while our elites were gone! We suspect they're from a hostile clan!'? Don't forget that our goal is to divert attention from our captain! Our goal isn't to raid the territory for resources, but to make the Li clan think that we're the true culprit!\"Yang Ze rubbed his head. \"Ah, I know! In that case, one person needs to attract the attention of the scouts, and the other five can sneak into the territory. And then\u2014\"\"If you already know the plan, what're you waiting for? Get going!\"\"Ah, me?!\"\"Of course it's you! Your body's the closest match to the captain's among any of us here, and you're water-attuned as well. Who else would it be?\"As the other five hunters watched on with stifled laughter, Yang Ze, clad in black, appeared in front of the Li hunters guarding the region.\"Who's there?!\"\"Is this territory controlled by the Li clan?\" Yang Ze asked.\"That's right. Identify yourself! \u00a0What are you doing here?\"\"The Li clan that Li Hong belongs to?\" Yang Ze asked again, without replying to any of the guard's questions.His attire and speech couldn't help reminding the guard of Li Hong's mysterious killer, whom they had all been told to keep an eye out for. As he released his genetic energy, the guard repeated, \"Who are you, and what are you doing here?\"\"I'm here to take your life.\"Before that guard could react, three of his fellow guards, who were gathering around him, had perished. By the time the guard turned back around, the man in black had vanished. He could hear screams coming from within the territory.With all the elites in the territory gone to assist Li Jin, and with such a mysterious killer on the loose, he had no desire to fight at all.\"Flee! Report back to the clan and tell Young Master Li that the killer's right here in our territory!\" Following his command, the dozen or so people in the territory began to run away, but in the end, there were only two survivors, one of whom was the guard who had seen Yang Ze.Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng's plan had gone off without a hitch.Li Jin rapidly heard about the news, but he was stupefied when he did. The mysterious killer who killed Li Hong had just been sighted at the blue-squirrel stream? Was this a joke? He had just faced off against that killer! How could he have gotten to the blue-squirrel stream in that short a time?Surely he couldn't have gone that far\u2026 could he? After all, his hunters were securing the entire area! In that case, what could be going on at the blue-squirrel stream?FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: Monkey in the MiddleRegardless of the veracity of the information, Li Jin couldn't spare any attention for it. So what if the blue-squirrel stream had been controlled by another party? Once he finished matters here at the Bloodcrystal Valley, he could easily reclaim that territory.Through a messenger, he relayed to those hunters at the blue-squirrel stream to hold out as long as they could. Once he was done here, he would make those raiders pay for what they had done.Explosions rattled the battlefield in the valley below them: up till now, both the ant swarm and Li Jin's elite hunters had suffered significant losses from the battle.Of course, Li Jin's group still had the upper hand, but the blood ants were known for their numbers and rampaging ability. The superior-grade blood ant had commanded and reinforced territorial behavior, but now that it had perished, the only thought on their mind was to destroy all that opposed them, all that stood in their way.The blood ants that emerged from the caves would activate [Bloodbath] almost instantly, ramping up their offensive capabilities before charging into the midst of the hunters.Hunters weren't robots, and although the Li hunters present were all elites, they would still eventually get tired. They had persisted and engaged in battle for over half an hour, and even Li Jin was getting fatigued, let alone the common hunter.However, the territory that Li Jin wanted to secure was too large to control unless he used up all his reserve troops as well.This implied that the hunters would have no backup or replacements, and that they would have to keep fighting despite the stamina drain. Sooner or later, one would falter, and the encirclement would break apart.And once that happened, that damned black-clad bastard would be able to escape.This was the outcome that Li Jin most wanted to avoid. In his anger, Li Jin didn't realize the major loophole in his plan: given Zhang Lie's combat ability, it wouldn't be difficult at all for him to break out of the entrapment.\"Quick, search the hilltop as fast as you can. Then, help the hunters at the bottom of the valley!\" Li Jin commanded.Although this would decrease the efficiency of the search, it would still be preferable to the alternative.\"Young Master Li, Chu Feng's here!\"Li Jin had no time or attention to spare for Chu Feng. Even worse, the Li hunters had found no sign of Chu Xun, and had no idea where she could be hiding. If something were to happen to her, the Li clan could face serious repercussions.\"Get out here, Li Jin!\" Chu Feng shouted, right after Li Jin reminded his subordinates not to hurt Chu Xun if she were found.Li Jin scowled, knowing that he had no choice but to deal with Chu Feng now.On the hilltop, Li Jin and Chu Feng faced each other with their subordinates in tow.\"Where's my sister?\" Chu Feng asked.\"Young Master Chu, I can't answer that question. I haven't seen any trace of your sister around! You must have heard that the Li clan's here to catch Li Hong's mysterious killer, and we're not here for your sister. We were told that your sister had travelled in this direction with the mysterious killer, but if she's here, she hasn't revealed herself.\"Chu Feng judged that Li Jin's words were trustworthy. Chu Xun had quite a reputation in the Blacksteel settlement, and he doubted that Li Jin would dare to do anything to her knowing what the Chu clan would do in retribution.\"Brother, I'm right here!\" Chu Xun, seeing her brother deep in thought, leapt down from a nearby tree and ran toward him. \"Brother, you're too late! You missed the best part of the show!\"Chu Feng huffed in mock annoyance. \"Who allowed you to run around outside the settlement with a stranger you barely knew? What would I have done if something were to happen to you?\"\"Don't worry, Brother! I can take care of myself, and if I have to run away, I have the soulshard you gave me. Brother, I bet you couldn't have imagined what just happened!\"In front of Li Jin, Chu Xun began describing in meticulous detail all that she had witnessed from her vantage point up on a tree.It was as though she had ripped open Li Jin's wounds and scattered some salt in them. He would have attacked anyone else who dared to do so, but she was Chu Xun, beloved of the Chu clan, and Chu Feng and a large group of Chu elites were right there with her.Li Jin could only sulk in silence. His troops were overburdened just dealing with the blood ants in the valley; he certainly couldn't rouse the Chu clan's ire now.\"Young Master Chu, since you've found your sister, I won't accompany you any further.\"Chu Feng, who had just heard Chu Xun describe how Li Jin's superior-grade blood ant had been snatched from right before his eyes, laughed out loud.\"Li Jin, I advise you to give up now. You've already sustained such severe losses and lost whatever reward you could have hoped to obtain: if you keep your troops fighting even longer, you'll only end up with more casualties. And, to be frank, this sort of formation is far too easy to break out of. If I were trapped in this manner, I would have at least five different ways of escaping.\"\"Young Master Chu, there's no need to burden yourself with the Li clan's affairs. If there's nothing else, please, leave the valley!\"Chu Feng had spoken out of pity for Li Jin, but Li Jin was too blinded by anger to listen to reason. In that case, he needn't waste his breath any longer. He nodded, then turned to leave with Chu Xun.\"Brother, I don't want to leave! Blackie hasn't come out yet!\"Chu Feng smiled. \"What Blackie? That mysterious hunter?\"His sister nodded. \"Yes! \u00a0He won't be hurt, will he?\"\"If he's as mysterious as you claim, I'm sure he'll be able to make it out. Who's to say he hasn't already left?\" Chu Feng told his sister, but she still seemed rather disbelieving.\"Really? Is he already gone?\"\"Of course! When have I ever lied to you?\"Chu Xun cocked her head for a moment, deciding whether or not to believe her brother. In the end, she gave in and departed with the main Chu coalition.Li Jin stared at the departing Chu clan with serious doubts in his mind about whether Zhang Lie was really still around.\"Young Master Li, that killer appeared again! He's taken over the Thunderscale Cave!\"Li Jin was left agape by this piece of news.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: The Boundless Blade: First Form\"Retreat! Retreat at once!\"\"Young Master Li, if we retreat, all our work will be for naught!\" As Li Jin commanded a retreat, one of his subordinates quickly reminded him of the consequences for doing so.\"I said, retreat! Don't make me say it a third time!\" Li Jin was so furious that no one dared to speak up after that.By then, Li Jin was certain that Zhang Lie had returned to the settlement after stealing his kill using some mysterious technique. Then, he had started decimating the territories controlled by the Li clan. In that case, it would be meaningless for him to stand guard here.Without the superior-grade blood ant, and without Li Hong's mysterious killer, there was no reason for all of them to stay at the Bloodcrystal Valley. On the other hand, they would have to regain control of their lost territories before Zhang Lie irrevocably damaged them.What had occurred in the valley had to be written off as a sunk cost, and he had to plan for the future instead.Zhang Lie, hiding by the side of one of the numerous caves in the Bloodcrystal Valley, was rather surprised by the Li clan's sudden retreat. After all, he had anticipated that the furious Li Jin would expend all his manpower trawling through the caves for any sign of his existence.How could he retreat just like that? It bothered Zhang Lie that things weren't going to plan.However, he immediately came to his senses. Was he going to let Li Jin retreat just like that? Of course not!Zhang Lie immediately followed after the hunters of the Li clan.By the mouth of the valley, a dozen or so hunters who were trying to retreat inadvertently left a gap in their defenses, and they were rapidly swarmed by a tide of ants. By the time the ants passed through where they were, there was nothing left of them, not even a scrap of clothing or remnant of flesh.\"Retreat! Retreat at once!\" Li Jin shouted, and his elites rapidly rushed out of the valley.Just as Li Jin's team on the hilltop met up with the Li hunters in the valley, the black-cloaked Zhang Lie emerged at the front of the gathered group.Li Jin was completely stupefied.The black-cloaked hunter's aura, stature, and height were all the same as those of the hunter he had fought, and Li Jin was absolutely certain that this fellow was precisely the hunter who had stolen the superior-grade blood ant from him.Hadn't he left?What was going on? Was the Chu clan in cahoots with this hunter against the Li clan? No, that couldn't be, at least not based on Chu Feng's reaction to the whole affair.In that case, could this mysterious hunter have been working with a few accomplices?It didn't matter: the truth would be revealed as soon as he caught him.Li Jin stopped short, forcing the rest of the Li hunters behind him to do the same. In ordinary circumstances, such a halt wouldn't be a big deal, but there was a veritable sea of ants chasing after them.\"Young Master Li, hurry up! You can't fall behind!\" The hunters by his side immediately began to run forward again, as did Li Jin, but his sudden halt had doomed the Li hunters unlucky enough to be at the end of the group.The ant tide claimed a dozen more elites.They were running over a flat expanse of land now, and the terrain was far more disadvantageous compared to the narrow, constricted valley.\"Rush forward at full speed, but try to catch that guy if you see an opportunity!\" Li Jin commanded the guards beside him, then rushed out of the crowd of hunters.Evidently, he was still very interested in subduing Zhang Lie, figuring out just who he was, reacquiring his spoils of battle, and then killing him.As for Zhang Lie, his intention was evident: to attract Li Jin's attention, prevent the Li hunters from escaping the ant tide, and whittle down their numbers as much as he could. And if there were an opportunity, he would try his best to kill Li Jin. After all, Li Jin's soulshards were far too tempting to resist.The moment he appeared in front of the Li hunters, Zhang Lie had begun amassing genetic energy. Now, he evoked the overwhelming majesty of the ocean, threatening to drown them in either his attack or in the sea of ants behind them.Li Jin was caught completely off-guard by the strength that the mysterious hunter showed. Zhang Lie's sneak attack from before had left Li Jin with a rather negative impression of his capabilities. He certainly didn't expect that his mysterious opponent would display a strength rivaling that of the top twenty hunters on the gene leaderboard.\"[The Boundless Blade: Yawning Wave]!\" As Zhang Lie thrust downward with Venombane, the frothing water-attuned genetic energy transformed into a gigantic carp, which seemed as though it would swallow the Li hunters whole.\"[Golden Dawn]!\" Li Jin stood his ground against the gigantic carp, striking at it with his golden polearm. A ferocious gold-furred tiger coalesced from the energy gathered around the polearm and pounced toward the carp.The clash of genetic energy created an explosion of gold and blue.Zhang Lie, his genetic energy almost all consumed after that one strike, darted into a dense patch of forest without even glancing at the outcome of his attack. After all, his strike wasn't meant to kill Li Jin, but instead to block him and his fellow hunters from escaping.That Li Jin had to defend himself against the attack was enough: he and his entire group had to halt lest they were caught up in the explosion. This wouldn't normally be a problem, but, after all, their circumstances were hardly normal. Behind them was a tide of red ants, nipping at their heels.Each time Li Jin and his group halted, they would suffer grievous losses. Zhang Lie's one blade had caused the red tide to surround half his group.It was then that Li Jin realized Zhang Lie's true intentions: to kill him, to kill the Li elites that he had spent so much effort developing, to kill them all within this bloody sea of ants!He gritted his teeth, feeling as though he had never hated someone so completely before.\"You'd better not let me catch you, or you'll wish that you had died in this valley today!\" Li Jin muttered to himself, then turned to one of his trusted aides. \"Li Quan, escape with the rest of the hunters. I'll take care of that hunter myself!\"Li Jin darted into the dense forest before Li Quan could respond.As soon as he did so, a large explosion erupted from behind him. Beneath a billowing mushroom cloud of dust, the remaining hunters, led by Li Quan, were completely trapped amidst the sea of ants.Zhang Lie had anticipated what Li Jin would do, and he had buried a few landmines underneath the patch of land that the Li hunters would have to pass through.Chaos descended on the group. The explosion itself wasn't particularly damaging, given the hunters' protective auras of genetic energy, but it slowed them down significantly, giving the tide of ants a chance to swallow them whole.\"Quick! We have to break through at all costs!\" Li Quan yelled, genetic energy exploding from his body as he tried to forge a path out of the sea of ants.However, not all the Li hunters present were as strong as he was.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: The Wealthy Li ClanAfter a short skirmish, only about a dozen elites escaped the ants' entrapment, leaving the remaining hunters to drown in the sea of ants. This would undoubtedly be the worst day the Li clan had experienced for years to come.\"You damnable bastard, get out here!\" Li Jin yelled out hoarsely, having witnessed the death of so many of his subordinates, but Zhang Lie had vanished as though he were a ghost.In fury, Li Jin tossed out a glowing white orb, which exploded in mid-air in a dizzying array of light.This white orb was a rare, consumable soulshard that could break all manner of stealth. As a consumable, its only selling point was its reliability: it was otherwise expensive, short-lasting, and with a small area of effect, and wasn't something an ordinary hunter could afford.The stealthed Zhang Lie was slowly revealed by the light.\"You even have that gimmick? You should really have used it earlier, huh?\"Zhang Lie walked up to him, still shielding his eyes from the light. He didn't seem at all anxious that he had been discovered.\"Die!\" Li Jin, enraged beyond belief, shot a golden spear in his direction.Zhang Lie dashed to one side, not wanting to pit his strength or genetic energy against Li Jin's in his weakened state. Nevertheless, he was as calm as ever.\"You were struck by my blade, but you don't seem poisoned at all, so you must have some superior-grade soulshard that grants poison immunity. Not bad, not bad! As expected of the successor to the Li corporation\u2014you must have at least five superior-grade soulshards on you! How about this? If you hand over your soulshards, I'll spare your life.\"\"You think you can handle me?\" Li Jin dashed forward and launched a flurry of attacks at Li Jin.As he did so, Zhang Lie activated the superior-grade blood-ant soulshard he had just obtained, encapsulating Zhang Lie in a cloud of mysterious red steam.Li Jin headed right into the cloud. He felt a sudden impact and saw a spray of blood, his pupils contracting. Before he could react, he suddenly felt a chill in his extremities, and he fell paralyzed to the ground.From start to finish, Li Jin had seen nothing but a red blur at the edge of his vision.In truth, even Zhang Lie was amazed by the increase in his strength.\"Argh! Aren't the side effects of this soulshard a little too extreme?!\"Of course, the stronger the enhancement, the stronger its side effects. After that one attack, Zhang Lie slumped against the ground, feeling as though his body was melting in a heap of molten lava.Even Zhang Lie, who had gotten used to all sorts of injuries in his past life, was whining in pain, his teeth and fists tightly clenched. Fortunately, he had only activated the soulshard for a short period of time, and the pain was quickly dissipating.Within ten seconds, it had receded to a level that Zhang Lie could tolerate.As for Li Jin, when he heard Zhang Lie complaining about the soulshard, he was so enraged that he almost spat out blood. He hadn't expected that the soulshard would provide such an extreme boost, as though he were facing a hunter magnitudes stronger than himself.Of course, most frustrating was the fact that he had been so close to obtaining the soulshard himself!\"Who exactly are you? Why are you targeting the Li clan?!\" As he lay on the ground paralyzed, he had no choice but to accept the reality that he had been downed in a single blow.\"If I told you, I'd have to kill you,\" Zhang Lie replied. \"I don't bear any ill will toward the Li clan, and I haven't been targeting it. To be frank, it's too weak to be worth my time. Li Hong tried to steal a kill that was rightfully mine, and then to slaughter the witnesses nearby. And what about you? If you're bringing such a large horde of hunters intending to kill me, I'm obligated to act in self-defense, aren't I?\"Li Jin couldn't help but laugh in self-mocking. He'd grown too used to dominating over the hunters in the Blacksteel settlement, but he had no idea when someone like Zhang Lie had emerged from the Blacksteel settlement.\"A superior-grade stealth-type soulshard, and a black cloak... you couldn't be...\"Li Jin was stupefied. Who else could this mysterious hunter in front of him be? It had to be the hunter in the venombane glade who had toyed with the representatives of the six largest clans of the Blacksteel settlement!\"Are you sure you want to keep guessing?\" Zhang Lie asked, giving his blade a few casual swings.He wasn't too worried about his identity being revealed. After the auction he'd attended, along with the bountiful harvest from the blackwater sands, he was just about ready to concoct Potion #2. Once he did so, he would have nothing and no one to fear within the Blacksteel settlement.Whether or not Li Jin could hazard a guess as to his true identity was irrelevant.\"Hand over your soulshards, and I just might spare your life!\" Zhang Lie offered again.\"How can you guarantee it?\"\"What guarantee do I need? You can choose whether or not to hand over your soulshards, but are you sure you want to risk your life on the gamble?\"Zhang Lie held Venombane directly above Li Jin's heart, then slowly lowered his hand. It sliced through layer after layer of armor, piercing the skin...\"Wait, wait! I'll hand them over!\" Li Jin succumbed to his fear the moment Venombane drew blood. Was there anyone who didn't fear death? All conscious life had an innate fear of its antithesis.Once Li Jin made up his mind, he instantly handed over five superior-grade soulshards. Four were weapons, and the last was augmentation-type.Of the four weapons, Zhang Lie had seen three of them: a longbow as tall as he was, a resplendent golden polearm, and a sturdy, intricate tortoiseshell shield. The last weapon was an obsidian spear curved like a snake. All four weapons were high quality, and he would gladly collect as many such soulshards as he could find.The augmentation-type soulshard took the form of a green bead. According to Li Jin, this bead could negate the effects of a large class of poisons, and once absorbed into a hunter's soulspace, it would dramatically increase that hunter's self-healing capabilities, even allowing for limited regrowth of flesh and limb.Zhang Lie was very pleased to have obtained five superior-grade soulshards in one fell swoop, and he had to admire the Li clan's wealth.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Handing Out Soulshards\"Not bad. Do you have any more?\"Zhang Lie's face was the epitome of greed. But under these circumstances, no matter how excessive his demands were, Li Jin could only agree to them with a smile.\"You want mutated-grade soulshards too?\"\"Of course! Those are still points, after all.\"Li Jin's eyebrow twitched, but he opened up his soulspace again. In another blinding flash of light, more than thirty mutated-grade soulshards, each like a resplendent gem, appeared in front of Zhang Lie.This time, he was too lazy to even inspect each one. Instead, he swept them all up into his potbellied-toad pouch. This was essentially all the profit that Zhang Lie could extract from Li Jin.\"Very good. For your sincerity, I'll spare your life!\"Zhang Lie's sword gleamed as he stabbed down past Li Jin's chest and splintered his genetic core. From that moment on, Li Jin would forever be a cripple.\"No! Why?! I've done everything you told me to! Why?!\" Li Jin roared in rage.\"Of course it's because I don't want you to seek revenge. You're not a threat to me, but it would be quite annoying. And now, I won't have to worry. See you around!\"Zhang Lie whistled as he walked away, quickly vanishing from Li Jin's sight, leaving him alone in the forest, howling, \"Bastard, kill me! I dare you to kill me!\"By then, Zhang Lie was too far away to hear his screams.He headed back to the settlement to deposit his spoils for the day. Coincidentally, outside the settlement, he found quite a few black-cloaked hunters dressed exactly like him. He was currently stealthed, and when he walked closer, he immediately discovered their identity.\"Fang Yi, Yang Ze, Sun Mengmeng... what are the three of you doing?\"The three of them had been hiding by the settlement grounds and scoping out the Li clan's movements, and the sudden voice that seemed to come from midair gave them all a big shock.However, they quickly realized that that voice was very familiar.\"Captain! I recognize your voice, it has to be you!\"\"Are you safe now?\"Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng's concerned tone left Zhang Lie a little confused. \"What trouble could I be in?\"\"Weren't you caught by the Li clan?\" Sun Mengmeng asked.\"How did you guys know about this?\"Fang Yi was speechless. \"News about the Li clan's mobilization was spread throughout the settlement! How could we not hear about it?\"Zhang Lie patted his head. \"Ah, that's right, it would have caused a big commotion. In that case, what are you doing here?\"Sun Mengmeng replied, \"What else? Of course we're trying to divert the Li clan's attention! How are you? Were you injured?\"Zhang Lie shook his head, seeming to have guessed something. \"No wonder Li Jin was trying to retreat! You made a ruckus somewhere, didn't you? Alright, alright, rein everyone back in! We can't bully the Li clan too much, can we?\"Zhang Lie's words confused the three hunters. In truth, they couldn't imagine what dreadful odds he had faced, alone against a veritable horde of Li hunters. So what was with this talk of bullying?\"We'll talk back at the inn,\" Zhang Lie added, then began walking toward the settlement gates..While the hunters didn't quite understand the situation, the fact that Zhang Lie was so unperturbed must have meant that there was nothing to worry about. They immediately recalled the other three hunters to the Blackgold Inn.It was when they saw the five resplendent, egg-sized superior-grade soulshards lying on a table that they realized what Zhang Lie had meant by 'bullying'.They gaped at Zhang Lie's spoils.Was there something wrong with the news that they had heard? Could it be that the captain had surrounded the Li clan with his own hunters instead? No, that couldn't be! The entire settlement was in an uproar about the Li clan's mobilization: how could there have been a mistake?\"Captain, how did you... What happened?!\" Fang Yi could hardly believe his eyes.Zhang Lie smiled. \"I just took advantage of two opposing forces.\"Sun Mengmeng suddenly cried out, \"The blood ants of the Bloodcrystal Valley? You managed to provoke a superior-grade blood ant into attacking Li Jin?\"Zhang Lie nodded. \"Good guess. \u00a0Li Jin wasn't weak, but his experience as a commander was far too limited, and I was able to take advantage of his naivete. I destroyed his genetic core, and about four-fifths of his elites were killed in the fight against the blood ants. I suppose soon there'll only be five great clans in the Blacksteel settlement\u2014or, I suppose, four.\"The gathered hunters glanced at their captain in shock, hearing his words but not being able to process them. Was he still human? He alone had caused such massive destruction amidst the ranks of the Li clan?Zhang Lie ignored their stupefied looks.\"You all did well causing a distraction, and you made Li Jin panic near the very end. As the team leaders, Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, take your pick of one of these five soulshards!\"What? Surely they must have misheard?These were superior-grade soulshards, so rare and precious that there were never any on the trading post, not that they would ever be able to afford any. Zhang Lie would let them pick one, just like that?\"Isn't this t-too much?\" Fang Yi stammered.When he had volunteered to take action against the Li clan to distract them from Zhang Lie, he didn't anticipate that this would be the reward.\"Don't look so shocked. Don't you think I understand that you could well have perished given the risk you took? You might even have implicated your families! Your willingness to help me out despite such a massive risk to yourselves is worth far more to me than a superior-grade soulshard.\"A moment of stunned silence passed, then two. They were just ordinary hunters trying to grow strong, still nothing more than weaklings on the pecking order. What they had accomplished at risk to their own lives was something that barely affected Zhang Lie, but he understood their struggles and was rewarding them for it.From that moment, they truly developed a sense of loyalty to Zhang Lie.Not any ordinary leader would be willing to hand over such precious commodities to their subordinates. In the dimensional world, where strength was power, who would give up such a rare source of strength? Familial ties had been broken for less.Fang Yi picked up the obsidian spear with the snake motif, and Sun Mengmeng the sunbird bow.\"Captain, I, Sun Mengmeng, pledge my eternal loyalty to you!\"This was a superior-grade soulshard, a superior-grade soulshard, something that even some among the top fifty hunters in the settlement didn't have! And now, she had one of her own, one that was particularly compatible with her own attack style.This particular soulshard would double\u2014no, triple, at least\u2014her strength. In the past, she would have to work together with her teammates to kill a few strong mutated-grade lifeforms, but now, with superior gene fragments and this superior-grade armament, she thought she would be able to kill them alone with just one arrow.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: Frightening StatisticsFang Yi felt exactly the same way. His new obsidian spear would be as powerful an augmentation as Sun Mengmeng's sunbird bow.Instead of flattering Zhang Lie as he was wont to do, however, Fang Yi simply looked Zhang Lie deeply in the eyes. Sometimes, that was all the communication that was needed.After handing Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng each a superior-grade soulshard, Zhang Lie kept the remaining three. He was intending on keeping the soulshard with the potent regenerative ability for himself and handing the other two soulshards out, but now wasn't the right time: the other hunters would first need to develop skills of their own, and handing them such a strong weapon now would affect their growth negatively.He wasn't even sure he had made the right decision with regard to Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng.He couldn't help reminding them, \"You should all know where I got these soulshards from, and you'd better be wary of activating in public. You understand what I mean, don't you?\"Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng nodded earnestly.They were well aware of the trouble that could result if anyone saw them using those soulshards, and they immediately affirmed that they would avoid using them in sight of other hunters if at all possible.Zhang Lie relaxed, then turned to the other hunters.\"Don't get too jealous. As long as you all follow me loyally, I won't be stingy with you. I promise that, before you all take part in the Void Cup, you'll each have at least one superior-grade soulshard of your own.\"The other hunters whooped and proclaimed their loyalty, pledging that they would follow him come hell or high water.In truth, who wouldn't want a captain like Zhang Lie? He was strong, practical, intelligent, resourceful, and, most importantly, generous.After handing out the soulshards, Zhang Lie once again sent them on their way, indicating that they should start surveying the superior-grade lifeforms from the booklet he had given them.As for himself, he was preparing to cook the prey he had hunted that day: the superior-grade blood ant.Since he was going to consume it, he would have to remove its exoskeleton, which would serve as excellent raw material for forging.Zhang Lie was very careful to preserve as much of the chitin as he could. He was planning to use the superior-grade blood ant's chitin, along with the venombane scorpion's carapace, to construct superior-grade armor for himself.In that case, he would possess both a superior-grade weapon and superior-grade armor.After deftly removing large pieces of chitin and storing them in his pouch, Zhang Lie finally began to prepare the ant flesh.The superior-grade blood ant's flesh was white, and looked no different from crab meat. It wasn't as fresh as seafood, but its superior-grade nature gave it a surprisingly delectable texture, much like that of marbled beef.There were many ways of preparing ant meat, steaming and frying being the most common among them. Zhang Lie chose the technique he was most familiar with: frying.He dipped strips of marinated ant meat in a boiling-hot pot of oil, turning the white meat an appealing golden-orange. A mouthwatering scent filled the entire room.Zhang Lie let the strips cool down for a moment, and then ate them piping-hot. As he consumed the veritable mountain of meat, the will of the world announced in his mind:[For consuming the flesh of a superior-grade blood ant, you received one superior gene fragment. Current total: 26][For consuming the flesh of a superior-grade blood ant, you received one superior gene fragment. Current total: 27][...one superior gene fragment. Current total: 33]He spent two whole days solely eating and cultivating, and finally finished the last piece of meat on the afternoon of the second day. All in all, he had gained eight superior gene fragments, and was now at a grand total of 33.This alone would put him within the top twenty hunters of the Blacksteel settlement.It was relatively easy to hunt regular- and mutated-grade lifeforms, but far more difficult to hunt superior-grade ones. Not only were they difficult to track down, they were also difficult to kill. A regular team of hunters, all of whom had maxed out their mutated gene capacity, would need ten or more members in order to kill even the weakest superior-grade lifeform.The additional superior gene fragments that Zhang Lie gained strengthened his body and constitution. Over the last two days, as he digested the nutrients from the superior-grade meat, his [Ninecarp Transformation] reached the peak of the first form, and he felt as though he would be able to advance to the second form after consuming the flesh of one or two more superior-grade creatures.Zhang Lie was a little curious as to just how strong his evolving framework would become then. His current stats were already extremely impressive, so what would further evolution bring?Zhang Lie: a mortal lifeformFramework: Foundation, Lv. MAX, Ninecarp Transformation, First Form: CarpTechniques: Rippling Walk (advanced), Three-Wave Crescendo (advanced), Calm Waters (advanced), Fists of the Silent Sea (novice), The Boundless Blade (novice)Genes: Basic, 160; Mutated, 100; Superior, 33Soulshards: White Grub (superior), Galewolf (mutated), Blood Ant (superior), Potbellied Toad (mutated), Venombane Scorpion (superior), Eternalspring Cocoon (superior)He had reached and long since exceeded the regular gene capacity, reached the mutated gene capacity, obtained 33 superior gene fragments, and had broken through with his foundational framework.His three high-grade techniques, [Rippling Walk], [Three-Wave Crescendo], and [Calm Waters] had all reached advanced-level, and the pinnacle-grade [Fists of the Silent Sea] and the mythic-grade [The Boundless Blade] were all at novice-level.As for his soulshards, he had the utilitarian transformation-type white-grub soulshard, the armament-type venombane-scorpion soulshard, which endowed him with powerful stealth and poison capabilities, the augmentation-type blood-ant soulshard, which granted him an extremely powerful boost, and the particularly rare augmentation-type eternalspring-cocoon soulshard, which boasted supreme regenerative abilities.And all four were superior-grade soulshards.Zhang Lie was certainly as strong as the top ten hunters on the gene leaderboard at present, and once he concocted Potion #2 and broke through the mutated gene capacity, he would easily be able to take on the top ten hunters on the gene leaderboard even if they came at him together.He would soon be past the most difficult stage of his reincarnation, in which he was still weak and had to use all sorts of tricks to shore up his strength, and would quickly advance to the second stage of his plan: leading mankind to salvation.Speaking of Potion #2, it had been over a week since he had requested that the auction house acquire the ingredients he needed, so he opened the trading post interface to contact his representative there.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: An Unexpected Profit\"Honored Mr. Peppercorn, I'm elated to be serving you today. Might I ask what services I may render for you?\"Zhang Lie was able to contact the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion without much effort. Perhaps because he was a million-class customer, he was afforded significant respect. The customer representative serving him today was, once again, Daffodil.\"I'd like to ask about the order I placed with you around a week ago. How many of the herbs have you managed to acquire?\"Daffodil's tone was regretful. \"I apologize, Mr. Peppercorn, but we haven't been able to complete your order despite prioritizing it.\"Zhang Lie couldn't help frowning. \"You haven't? In that case, how much progress have you made?\"Daffodil was silent for a moment, as though she were pulling up the relevant file. \"At the moment, we're still missing the bear's-heart grass, electroblade leaf, jadeconch flower, and amethyst starfruit, Mr. Peppercorn.\"\"Only these four ingredients?!\" Zhang Lie was flabbergasted. After all, he had handed Daffodil a list of over a hundred ingredients. Most were herbs used for Potion #2, as well as a few supplementary ones for Potion #3. To think that Daffodil had managed to acquire all but four in just a week!\"Yes, Mr. Peppercorn! Of the four remaining ingredients, we expect to be able to acquire the jadeconch flower and amethyst starfruit relatively quickly, but there's currently a shortage of bear's-heart grass and electroblade leaf with our suppliers at the moment. Once again, I apolog\u2014\"\"It's fine, it's fine. I'm already quite amazed by your efficacy so far. Send me what you have now, and I'll try to obtain the last two ingredients on my own.\"Zhang Lie had sent Daffodil this list of ingredients just to chance his luck, and while he had anticipated some success, he hadn't imagined how effective delegating this task had been.In hindsight, however, it wasn't unexpected. At present, herblore was largely a neglected field, and had hardly developed into the enterprise it had been for the past Zhang Lie.Now was, without a doubt, the best time to acquire rare herbs and resources whose uses were yet unknown.Zhang Lie immediately sent points over for the gathered ingredients, then passed another list of ingredients to Daffodil to be sourced and purchased, with herbs even rarer and of higher- quality than those in the previous list.The Thousand-Treasure Pavilion was happy to receive such bulk requests from as direct and easygoing a customer as Zhang Lie, and Daffodil replied that she would do her best to acquire as many ingredients on the list as she could. After all, the Pavilion stood to make quite a significant profit from the sale, even excluding the fee that Zhang Lie had to pay for such requests.Zhang Lie knew about this, but he didn't mind at all. As long as he had all the necessary ingredients, he would be able to increase their value hundredfold, even thousandfold.Within five minutes, three black sock-like sacks were teleported to Zhang Lie's room. These socks served a similar purpose as Zhang Lie's potbellied-toad pouch. They didn't look very impressive from the outside, but from the inside, each was a pocket of expanded space.Zhang Lie inspected each sock and found them all stuffed to the brim with box after box of herbs, a dizzying sight to behold.\"Haha, I'm rich!\" He couldn't help whooping in joy before calming himself down and carefully sorting through the herbs.He dumped out the herbs in the three socks, then returned the socks to the teleportation device. Because of the unexpected haul, he was just one ingredient away from Potion #2: all he was missing was bear's-heart grass.Most importantly, this grass wasn't a precious ingredient, just one that wasn't too common in the dimensional world, and one that was easily mixed up with a more common herb, which led to shortages from time to time.As an accomplished pillmaster in his own right, Zhang Lie essentially had an invaluable compendium of herbs stored in his mind. In fact, he knew of five locations in the first realm in which bear's-heart grass grew, and none of them were particularly dangerous.He immediately left the inn, but rather than heading outside, he turned toward the settlement's forge. It was true that he was impatient to concoct Potion #2, but that didn't mean he couldn't marshal his emotions and keep them in check. A lifetime of experience told him that it was precisely in such situations that he would have to be most patient and careful.It was already evening, and nighttime in the dimensional world was dangerous indeed. It wasn't as though the bear's-heart grass wouldn't be there in the morning, and he could spend the night preparing to brew the concoction before gathering the grass tomorrow instead.The reason he was venturing out into the settlement now was to have his superior-grade armor made. He was filled with anticipation for the armor that would result from combining the superior-grade venombane scorpion's carapace and the superior-grade blood ant chitin. After all, he had a relatively complete set of the two superior-grade lifeforms' exoskeletons.The settlement was extremely lively at night. There were all sorts of robots in the settlement that provided unique services that every hunter made use of.Zhang Lie headed to the S-ranked robotic forge. This was the most expensive forge in the settlement, with the costliest fee but also the best service. It exclusively accepted custom-made requests using superior-grade ingredients.After having his identity verified, a robotic voice said, \"Welcome, Mr. Zhang Lie. What may I help you with today?\"\"I'd like to craft a superior-grade armor.\"\"Very good. What materials will you be supplying, and in what proportion?\"\"60% superior-grade blood ant chitin, 30% S-gold alloy, and 10% superior-grade venombane-scorpion carapace.\"\"Please hand over the materials.\"The lid of a large chest in the room slid open, and Zhang Lie quickly deposited his materials inside. He added, \"There's S-gold alloy here, isn't there? I'll pay the standard price in points for its use.\"As the lid of the box retracted, the robotic voice sounded again, \"I understand. Please confirm your selection.Equipment: superior-grade armor.Materials: superior-grade blood ant chitin, superior-grade venombane-scorpion carapace, S-gold alloy.Cost: 800,000 points.Duration: 12 hours.Once you confirm the order, you will be asked to select a design for the piece of equipment you wish to forge.\"A screen appeared before Zhang Lie's eyes, detailing the choices he had made.Zhang Lie glanced over the contents of the screen briefly, then confirmed the order.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: Encounter at the BarAfter Zhang Lie handed over the appropriate number of points, a design interface popped up. There were quite a lot of options possible, and he would have to choose the design he preferred most. Once he made his selection, the process was over: the robotic forge would take care of the grueling forging process for him.All he had to do now was wait. In twelve hours, he could either return to the forge to collect the armor, or have it teleported to where he was.It was rare that he would head to the center of the settlement, so instead of returning to the Blackgold Inn, Zhang Lie took a stroll around the stores all around the area. It was reminiscent of the heart of a metropolis. The stores largely belonged to the settlement itself, with only a rare few being owned\u2014at significant expense\u2014by the six great clans.Zhang Lie stopped by a pub.The dimensional world was rife with danger, and the hunters who fought here day and night lived in primal stress. The struggle and pressure to survive was magnitudes more intense than one would normally experience out on Earth, and methods to relieve said stress were commensurately more popular.In fact, the entire street was filled with bars.The reason Zhang Lie stopped in front of this specific bar was because it seemed to be owned by the Yun clan.\"Welcome!\" Upon seeing the black-cloaked Zhang Lie, two hostesses rapidly walked over. \"Why don't you come in and have a drink? We've just launched our newest offering, an electrifying liquor that's sure to leave your throat sizzling!\"Zhang Lie laughed. \"In that case, I'll have to give it a try.\"The two hostesses were naturally overjoyed to have roped in a paying customer, and they immediately welcomed him in. The interior of the bar was like a different world entirely. The music was so loud that the entire bar trembled in beat. \u00a0Hunters, wearing all sorts of strange clothing and even armor, were splayed out in the bar, intermittently visible under the multicolored, strobing lights.The hostesses brought Zhang Lie to a secluded corner and handed him a menu, which Zhang Lie didn't even glance at. \"I'll have a flask of that electrifying liquor you mentioned!\"The two hostesses reared their heads in surprise, and one carefully whispered in his ear, \"Sir, have you looked at the price?\"Zhang Lie glanced at the menu, and his eyes bulged in shock.\u00a0800 points for a flask?! Isn't this daylight robbery?He should have returned to the inn! But he'd already said that he would get a flask of that liquor, so it would be embarrassing to take back his words now.\"Serve me a flask!\" he repeated, waving his hand in mock largesse.\"Sir, would you like an escort?\" Zhang Lie glanced around to see hostesses accompanying guests at all the tables around him.\"No, no, there's no need. I'm just here to enjoy the atmosphere.\" Zhang Lie rejected the offer and sent the two hostesses away.He'd been to bars on Earth, but never in the dimensional world. It was certainly an... interesting experience.The tables in the pub were relatively close together, and the guests at a neighboring table were easily able to overhear Zhang Lie's order.One hunter, dressed in a black and white suit, couldn't help laughing at Zhang Lie's appearance. \"What's this bar coming to? I thought it catered to a rather distinguished clientele, so how did someone like him make it in here? He's just a country bumpkin playing at wealth\u2014did you see how his eyes bulged when he learned how expensive the new wine was?\"There were people who enjoyed causing trouble everywhere, weren't there? Zhang Lie was just trying to have a new experience or two, and then...\"You think you're all that?\" Zhang Lie turned to the boorish guest.When the other hunters at the table heard him talk back, they immediately made a fuss.\"Eh, the bumpkin's getting mad!\"\"Do you know whom you're speaking to? The second son of the head of the Qin clan, one of the ten largest clans of the Blacksteel settlement!\"\"Bumpkin, it's not too late to apologize. Otherwise, if you offend him, you won't be able to survive in the Blacksteel settlement for much longer!\"\"Don't you know how valuable Young Master Qin's time is? And here you are, getting mad at having his attention!\"Zhang Lie scoffed. \"What ten major clans? Aren't there only six in the settlement? Is this the same Qin clan that Qin Xiao's in?\"Some of the hunters at the neighboring table stood up, enraged.\"What, you don't know the Qin clan?\"\"You bumpkin, you'd better apologize now, or I guarantee you won't be taking a step out of this bar today!\"\"I pity your teammates, saddled with an ignorant fool like you! You'd better kneel down and apologize now. Young Master Qin obtained a superior-grade soulshard today, and he's feeling rather generous at the moment, so he might spare you if you show him proper respect!\"Zhang Lie glanced at them superciliously like he was looking at a trio of clowns. He had no intention of listening to them any longer, let alone apologizing. If this Qin clan wasn't the same Qin clan that Qin Xiao was in, then they were nobodies in the Blacksteel settlement.Zhang Lie regretted speaking with them at all: it was too damaging to his reputation to be seen with a bunch of fools.The hunters at the neighboring table began to walk over, as if they were about to start a fight.\"Brat, are you really looking for troub\u2014\"\"Qin Feng, are you sure you want to offend someone like him? Don't blame me for not warning you: you'd better apologize now if you don't want your clan to be utterly ruined!\" A female voice suddenly spoke up from behind Zhang Lie.Qin Feng jerked in his seat, recognizing the voice.What was a little devil like Chu Xun doing in this bar? Now that she was here, he would have to greet her. Otherwise, if he were to rouse her anger, he and his clan would be in for a bad time. He would even be willing to let matters lie with this country bumpkin if she requested it.Qin Feng turned to greet Chu Xun, only to jump up in his seat.\"Young Master Chu, Young Miss Yun\u2014w-what are all of you doing here?\"He was frozen stiff. Chu Feng, Yun Bing, Chu Xun, and Yun Meng were all at the bar to talk to him? No, they couldn't be here for him!Who was he, Qin Feng, to deserve the attention of scions from the Chu and Yun clans themselves? A message to the Qin clan would be all it took for him to be delivered wherever they wanted, trussed up like a pig!But if they weren't looking for him, then\u2026 Qin Feng's pupils widened. \"Could it be...\"FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: Interrogation at the BarCould the person that the Chu and Yun scions were here for be the mysterious fellow in front of Qin Feng? Surely not. That fellow possessed no sense of noble bearing at all!\"Don't you know what happened to the Li clan today?\" Chu Xun prompted Qin Feng.\"Ah, of course I do. The majority of the Li elites perished, and Li Jin himself was stripped of his cultivation...\"\"And you're daring to provoke the hunter who caused it all? I don't have to remind you about the difference in strength between the Li clan and your Qin clan, do I?\" Chu Xun smiled, as though she were watching an entertaining spectacle.Qin Feng's brain stalled. \"Y-You mean that he, he's...\"\"That's right. From today onwards, there will only be five great clans in the Blacksteel settlement, not six. The instigator of this entire affair, well, he's the hunter you just tried to terrorize.\"Chu Xun's mocking words struck Qin Feng and his subordinates like bolts of lightning.Did they have no sense of self-preservation? How could they have tried to taunt and frighten someone like him? Qin Feng clambered out of his seat and knelt down in front of the mysterious hunter.As he kowtowed, he begged, \"Sir, please forgive me for my insolence. I offended you in my ignorance, and I beg for your mercy. Please, allow me to pay for all your expenses at the bar today!\"Naturally, his subordinates followed suit.\"Esteemed hunter, compared to you, I'm nothing more than a fart. Please let me out!\"\"Please, forgive us! I have a family to care for at home, elders and children, so won't you show us some clemency?\"Those hunters who had mocked Zhang Lie earlier were all kneeling on the floor, kowtowing in equal proportion to the crudeness of their earlier remarks.If this hunter was someone who could ruin even the Li clan, then he surely wasn't an existence they could provoke at any cost! And their lives were certainly far more important than their pride.Zhang Lie stared somewhat speechlessly at the kneeling Qin hunters on the floor. \"Little girl, why do I see you everywhere I go?\" he asked Chu Xun.She pinched her nose with a dainty hand. \"I can't help it. Your scent is just too strong! Deep-fried superior-grade blood ant meat must be tasty, but it's no good to enjoy such delicacies alone. Don't you have any left for me?\"Zhang Lie immediately ignored her and turned to the others. \"Young Master Chu, Young Miss Yun, this is your territory, I take it? I'm sure I don't have to invite you to take a seat.\"Chu Feng, Yun Bing, and the others all sat down by his table.\"Honestly, if you hadn't motioned for us to sit, we wouldn't have. After all, your performance today was just too shocking! We worked together in the past, but you seem to have grown so much stronger and more fearsome in a matter of days!\" Chu Feng began, expressing his awe toward Zhang Lie.Yun Bing and the others didn't speak up, but from their gazes, it was evident that they felt much the same way.The Qin hunters kneeling on the floor began to quake.Zhang Lie smiled. \"Am I all that frightening? After all, this Young Master Qin certainly didn't seem to fear me, and I'm sure you must be stronger than he is.\"His words caused the Qin hunters to slam their heads against the floor even more forcefully, and some of them were even bleeding from their foreheads by this point.\"Alright, alright, that's enough. If this goes on any further, I'm sure Yun Bing will blame me for ruining the mood in this bar. You'll remember not to bully country bumpkins like me in the future, won't you? Go on, get!\" Qin Feng was so far beneath Zhang Lie's level that he felt it damaging to his reputation to play around with him too much.\"Yes, sir! I'll keep this lesson imprinted in my mind!\" Qin Feng cried out.\"Thank you, sir!\" his subordinates chorused.They all stood up thankfully as they turned to leave.\"Wait!\" The moment they turned around, the silent Yun Bing spoke up.\"I apologize for our behav\u2014\"Qin Feng was interrupted halfway through his apology. \"Do not worry. If this hunter wants to let you go, I certainly will not contradict his decision. I simply called you back to inform you never to return to this bar again. Do you understand?\"Qin Feng didn't dare say no. He nodded to Yun Bing, bowed again, and then scurried out of the bar.Qin Feng's kowtowing had drawn the attention of the guests in the bar, as did Chu Feng and Yun Bing's appearance. The guests by the nearby tables all had their attention focused on this mysterious hunter, whom even Chu Feng and Yun Bing were showing respect to.Zhang Lie didn't much mind: after all, he was still cloaked in black, and it wasn't as though they would be able to see his face.On the other hand, Yun Bing and Chu Feng were unused to such public scrutiny. As scions of the Yun and Chu clans, if they ever went to a bar, they would head straight for the suites reserved for them on the upper levels, never to mingle with the common hunter on the ground floor.Uneasy at being gawked at, Chu Feng motioned to Zhang Lie. \"When are you going to take off that dreadful black cloak and show us your true appearance?\"Chu Feng was being surprisingly direct, but Zhang Lie only gave him a relaxed smile in response. \"You'll learn about my identity once the time's right. I just fear that you won't be able to believe what you're seeing then.\"Chu Feng laughed.\"What's there not to believe? The Blacksteel settlement is so large that I'm sure it boasts quite a few hidden talents. Surely you can't be, oh, say, that hunter at the bottom of the gene leaderboard?\" Chu Feng replied casually, but his words caused Zhang Lie's eyes to narrow for a moment.No one noticed anything.\"Oh? And what if I am? What would you think?\"Chu Feng blinked twice, not knowing how to respond.\"Chu Feng, haven't you led the conversation in a rather strange direction?\" Yun Bing spoke up, turning to Zhang Lie. \"The reason all of us are here today is because we have an important question for you.\"Zhang Lie motioned for her to continue. \"Ask what you will. I'm feeling good today, so I might even tell you the truth!\"FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: Two GirlsUpon hearing Yun Bing's words, Chu Feng also turned serious.\"Our question is simple: were you the hunter who stole the kill of the superior-grade venombane scorpion that night at the venombane glade?\"Chu Feng's earlier levity had all but vanished. After all, the answer to this question was far too important for him to remain relaxed.Yun Bing, Yun Meng, and Chu Xun were all looking at Zhang Lie intently, as if they were trying to see through his hood and into his eyes.Zhang Lie shrugged. \"Does it really matter to you? What if it were me? What if it weren't me?\"His insouciance deeply troubled the gathered scions of the Chu and Yun clans.\"If you aren't, then there's nothing to say, but if you are, don't you think you should explain yourself to us?\" Chu Feng asked pointedly, stressing his words.Zhang Lie cocked his head. \"What do you mean? If you're unhappy that I stole your prey, shouldn't you blame yourself for not being strong enough? What do you want me to say? And so what if I were to tell you that I was the one who killed it?\"Will you gang up on me in the Blacksteel settlement? Or will you try to target me back on Earth? But of course you don't know my true identity yet. Even if you did, are you sure you'd be able to take me down?\"Zhang Lie's response was startling. The Chu and Yun scions knew that Zhang Lie was a mysterious hunter, but was he so fearless or confident in his own strength that he would admit to what he had done?\"Do you realize that we almost died that night?!\" Chu Feng was on the verge of losing his composure.\"As I've said, that just indicates how weak you are. What does that have to do with me?\"\"...\" Chu Feng knew that he had to continue the conversation, but he didn't know how.Of course, they hadn't come to the bar in search of Zhang Lie just to have a drink, but they weren't here to cause trouble either.Instead, they had a request to make of Zhang Lie. They were hoping to gain the initiative in the conversation by pressuring Zhang Lie, but now...Zhang Lie could see through what they were doing, of course, or he wouldn't have acted so casually.In contrast to Yun Bing and Chu Feng's speechlessness, Chu Xun and Yun Meng's curiosity toward Zhang Lie had reached its peak. Since the four of them had come to the bar together, they naturally knew a little of what was going on, as well as their brother and sister's attitude.But they hadn't expected that Zhang Lie would be able to gain the upper hand so quickly, or even at all. They had never seen their older siblings conceding the upper hand before, and what they were witnessing today made Zhang Lie seem even more powerful in their minds: he was strong, mysterious, domineering, and fearless.What was Chu Feng supposed to say? He was still so angry at the venombane fiasco that he feared he'd sour relations between them if he were to speak now. And in that case, how was he supposed to ask Zhang Lie to purchase white-grub cores from him?In the end, it was Yun Bing who was forced to speak up. \"What's over is over, and it doesn't really matter whether or not you were the hunter who stole the kill. To be honest, both our clans benefited from the aftermath, and we might even need to thank you for what you did.\"Yun Bing's words turned the two girls' curiosity into awe and respect: after all, Yun Bing was essentially admitting defeat\u2014she was thanking a hunter who had almost caused her death!The two girls could hardly believe what they were hearing, particularly Yun Meng. This was the first time she had ever seen her sister give in! They turned to Zhang Lie with stars in their eyes.Zhang Lie's smile grew wider. \"There's no reason for thanks. I didn't cause the debacle intentionally, and, regardless of whether it was the Yun or Chu clan that chased after me, the outcome wouldn't have changed.\"Both then and now, my only intention has been to acquire superior gene fragments, and I don't plan on targeting any clan in particular. If I really wanted to do so, you wouldn't be sitting here now. In truth, the reason I decided to make a deal with your clans is because I found the two of you more amenable to me than the scions of the other clans.\"Of course, if you can't swallow your losses, feel free to come at me at any time.\"Zhang Lie's words stunned Yun Bing and Chu Feng.They were representatives of two of the largest clans in the settlement, so just how strong did this mysterious hunter have to be if he were confident that he could take them on?\"In that case, I propose that we let bygones be bygones.\" Yun Bing hesitated for a moment, then raised a cup of wine toward Zhang Lie. \"With this toast, let us start afresh.\"While Yun Meng and Chu Xun were still glancing at the three of them in stupefaction, they had each downed a cup of wine, and they suddenly seemed closer than before.\"It looks like I made the right decision in partnering up with the two of you,\" Zhang Lie murmured. \"In that case, let's get to the heart of the matter. What do you need from me?\"Yun Bing and Chu Feng glanced at each other before Yun Bing spoke up. \"We'd like you to help us contact Zhang Lie!\"Zhang Lie almost spat out the wine in his mouth. There was only one reason that they would be in search of Zhang Lie, but he didn't want to let on just yet. \"Searching for Zhang Lie? For what purpose?\"\"Surely you must know that he has developed a huge stockpile of white-grub cores?\" Yun Bing ventured.Zhang Lie laughed. \"Is that so? In that case, you're searching for him to acquire more cores?\"FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: Girl in the RoomYun Bing smiled. \"Ah, it seems that you know everything already.\"\"Have the white grubs in the white-grub cave already been hunted to extinction?\" Zhang Lie asked, mirroring her smile.\"In truth, they were more or less all gone by the time we went searching for them. After repeated trials, of the three types of food you listed, the white-grub cores were the ones that gave the best efficacy. In that case, would you be will\u2014\"\"I can certainly contact him, but I can't guarantee that he'll accept your request to trade,\" Zhang Lie interrupted, anticipating the question.\"As long as you can arrange a meeting for us, we'll handle the rest. After all, as representatives of two of the major clans, Chu Feng and I are confident that we'll be able to handle someone like him!\"Zhang Lie laughed. \"As long as you're confident. But don't get too excited\u2014he's not as easy to deal with as you might think. Be careful that he doesn't scam you!\"Upon hearing Zhang Lie's words, Chu Feng and Yun Bing immediately caught on to the fact that the mysterious hunter in front of them had some sort of relationship with Zhang Lie. In fact, he might just be the anonymous poster whose threads on the forum had caused such a huge ruckus.But no matter the identity of this mysterious hunter, he was someone that neither of them wanted to offend. After all, he was too strong for them to handle, and seemed to possess knowledge from a mysterious source.The Li clan wasn't all that powerful, but their clans certainly wouldn't have been able to crush it with such short notice.\"Let him try! As long as he's willing to sell the cores, we'll give him a price that'll satisfy him!\" Yun Bing proclaimed, not seeming to be worried that Zhang Lie would pass the message on.\"In that case, you'll hear back from me soon.\"Before Zhang Lie could leave, Yun Bing quickly added, \"Please try to be as quick as you can.\"\"Oh? You must have made quite a bit of progress with the breakthrough, then.\"\"Things are going fine. We have had about thirty successes to date, and our tests show excellent improvement in all areas after the breakthrough. Our clans have decided to promote this technique as widely as we can, and even Chu Feng and I have decided to purge our techniques and start from scratch after participating in the Void Cup.\"Zhang Lie was a little surprised that the two of them would be willing to give up what they had already achieved just for ten limit fragments, but it spoke to their resolution.\"Not bad, not bad! You'll need this sort of dedication if you really want to reach the peak of all hunters.\"Zhang Lie downed the cup of liquor in his hand, feeling as though a bolt of lightning had shot down his mouth and all the way through to his stomach. Instead of a charring sensation, however, he felt relaxed and invigorated all over.\"This wine's not bad!\" he praised.\"Come over whenever you like. As thanks for helping us arrange a meeting with Zhang Lie, this bar will never charge you for any of your expenses.\"\"In that case, I'll thank you in advance!\" Zhang Lie hadn't anticipated Yun Bing would be so generous, and he quickly decided to make the most out of it, ordering as much of the wine as he was able to drink. Of course, he wasn't going to get himself drunk: he prized a clear head over anything else, after all.It was only at two or three in the morning that Zhang Lie, somewhat tipsy, walked back to the inn. He stumbled into bed and slept all the way until morning the next day.Because the settlement's walls were rather tall, there were only a few places where the sun could reach in the morning. One of these few places was naturally the VIP suites in the Blackgold Inn.Zhang Lie opened the windows, basked in the sun, and stretched.\"You're awake!\" Just as Zhang Lie was luxuriating in the warmth, he heard a female's voice from behind.He stumbled, then turned around.What's she doing here? What's going on? Didn't I come back alone?How could this girl be here? Nothing untoward happened last night, right...?Zhang Lie then glanced downward at his own body.\"What're you looking at? Don't you recognize me anymore? It's only been one night!\"Chu Xun glanced at Zhang Lie as though she had suffered some grievance: was she so annoying that he had to look at her so disdainfully?\"No, I mean\u2014you, I, what sort of situation is this?!\" Zhang Lie stammered, his mysterious image shattering to pieces.Upon seeing Zhang Lie's flustered appearance, Chu Xun immediately laughed. \"What do you think?\"Her laugh actually caused Zhang Lie to relax.He glanced at her critically and noticed the master key in her hand, which would grant her access to all rooms in the inn. Of course she couldn't have been in his room last night! She had likely only entered right before he woke up.Zhang Lie shook his head. \"Alright, you little nuisance. How did you end up with that master key?\"He immediately felt as though he was forgetting something important.\"Given who I am, would it be difficult for me to obtain such a key from the three corporations?\"She put her hands on her hips, a smug smile on her face, but Zhang Lie's face darkened, because he realized what he had forgotten: all he was wearing at the moment was underwear, and Chu Xun had seen his face!Come to think of it, that didn't seem like such a big deal. So what if his identity were exposed? He had the strength to defeat anyone who would try to oppose him, after all.That didn't excuse the girl's actions, however. He stared at her severely. \"Does that mean you recognize who I am?\"Chu Xun tilted his head. \"Of course I do! Aren't you Blackie? You don't look ugly, so why do you have to drape yourself in that ugly black cloak all day long? Are you just trying to be mysterious?\"Or perhaps his identity hadn't been revealed after all: Zhang Lie might have been infamous among the regular hunters of the settlement, but would someone like Chu Xun care about who he was, or even what he looked like?Of course not!Zhang Lie schooled his features. \"Are you proud of breaking into my rooms?\"It was then that Chu Xun realized that Zhang Lie might be mad at her for what she did. After all, she was already of age, and this certainly wasn't an appropriate prank for someone like her to play.\"Ah, I'm sorry, I-I just wanted to see you again! Your scent's so unique that I noticed you the moment I passed by the Blackgold Inn! Don't get mad at me!\" Her eyes turned red, and she seemed on the verge of tears.Zhang Lie was never able to stand such hysterics. \"Alright, alright, don't cry! What's the matter? What's so urgent that you had to barge into my room so early in the morning?\"FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: Accepting All Challengers\"Er, well, there's nothing urgent. I was just bored and... wanted to invite you to play?\" Chu Xun ventured carefully.\"To play? \u00a0Who do you think I am, a companion of yours? I tolerated your behavior the last few times on account of your brother, but I'm not letting you get away with this anymore, do you hear me? Now, immediately, at once, get out!\"Zhang Lie pointed at the door as he marshalled Chu Xun out of his room.He felt that drastic measures were necessary on account of the expression that Chu Xun was giving him.If he didn't make matters clear, he might accidentally endorse her attraction to him, and that would be troublesome indeed. The best way to prevent that was to be blunt, so blunt that he couldn't be misunderstood.\"I'm leaving! You don't have to be so mean!\" The sudden antipathy in Zhang Lie's actions left Chu Xun quite bewildered, and she, who had been pampered from birth, hardly knew how to react to such a circumstance. With tears in her eyes, she covered her face as she fled from the room.\"How ridiculous!\" Zhang Lie clucked, once she had left. Wasn't\u00a0he\u00a0the victim? \"Alright, I don't want to think about it anymore! It's time to check on my armor.\"Zhang Lie shook his head fervently as he decided what to do next.When Zhang Lie returned to the S-ranked robotic forge, the robot who handled Zhang Lie's order immediately recognized him.\"Welcome back, Mr. Zhang Lie. Your order is finished. Would you like to retrieve it now?\"\"Yes, retrieve it.\"\"Please inspect the goods.\" As the robotic voice spoke, the lid of a box on the countertop slid open to reveal a set of exquisite, elegant armor appeared in front of Zhang Lie.The dark red of the blood ant had merged perfectly with the deep violet of the venombane scorpion with impeccable design and functionality. The contours of the armor fit him perfectly and reflected the two superior-grade lifeforms from which it had been made. The appearance of the armor was majestic enough that even Zhang Lie was somewhat dazzled by the sight.The armor consisted of six pieces: helmet, cuirass, tasset, greaves, pauldrons, and vambrace. Each piece was flawless, and fitted perfectly with the other pieces.Zhang Lie had seen the design for the armor beforehand, but when he saw the finished product in front of him, he was still amazed by its overall quality.It was totally worth the price he'd paid\u2014materials from two superior-grade lifeforms, along with 800,000 points!Zhang Lie couldn't resist the temptation to put on the armor immediately. Moments later, the black-cloaked Zhang Lie became a warrior in gleaming red and purple.With the activation of his genetic energy, a shimmering, pale blue shield appeared before the armor's surface. Zhang Lie tested its durability and was very pleased.\"Mr. Zhang Lie, your order has been completed. We wish you luck in your hunt!\" the robotic voice piped up again, seeing Zhang Lie wearing the armor with a satisfied smile.Zhang Lie nodded at the robot, draped his black cloak over the armor, and then left the forge. With his new armor, Zhang Lie was perfectly confident of being able to harvest the bear's-heart grass. In fact, because of this armor, he would be able to approach a more dangerous harvesting spot, accomplishing two goals in one swoop: harvesting the herbs he needed, as well as obtaining a few more superior gene fragments.The Bear Spires was a location far past the outskirts of the Blacksteel settlement, with intense, fluctuating magnetic fields that caused the spires\u2014great hunks of rock and steel\u2014to levitate in mid-air.Because of the fluctuations in the field and the instability of the levitating spires, there were frequent rockslides in the area, which were particularly dangerous for hunters caught unawares.This was the native habitat of a class of giant bear-type lifeforms that were naturally insensitive to the magnetic field in the region, known as the bimu bears. These lifeforms possessed earth-attuned genetic energy, and had massive, strong bodies.Most adult bimu bears were superior-grade lifeforms, about seven to eight meters tall at full extension, with a weight of about a few dozen tons, and the ability to toss around boulders the size of small hills: the paradigm of brawny strength.Most frightening was the fact that these lifeforms lived in packs: they would wander around in groups of two and three, and regular hunters certainly wouldn't dare to try to hunt them down.Elderly bimu bears, in their dying days, would travel to a certain spot on the spires and peacefully await their death. Under the influence of the magnetic field and geography of the region, crystalline stalks of grass would grow right by the hearts of these bear carcasses.These special stalks of grass were the last ingredient that Zhang Lie needed for Potion #2, and the spot where these elderly bears would go to die was known as the Bimu Harbor.It was true that the Bimu Harbor wasn't the only place in the Bear Spires where the bear's-heart grass could grow; after all, some elderly bears would die before they could reach the harbor.Under these circumstances, it was rare that bear's-heart grass would grow, but there was always a vanishingly small probability of their doing so. Zhang Lie's original intention had been to head to the vicinity of the harbor under stealth, hoping to find these accidental growths, but with his new armor, he felt that he would be able to sneak within the harbor itself and to slaughter the elderly bears that lay dying there.Naturally, the Bimu Harbor was a sacred place for the bimu bears, and they wouldn't allow any other lifeforms to approach. If Zhang Lie were to carry out his plan, he would inevitably attract the attention of such bears, and would certainly have to fight them off.As the Bear Spires came within sight, the corners of Zhang Lie's mouth lifted with excitement, and his body slowly faded into nothingness. Wielding Venombane in one hand, Zhang Lie activated the strongest stealth he could sustain, then headed quickly toward the spires.The moment he stepped forward, he felt his body begin to sink, as though gravity had increased dramatically. Zhang Lie naturally began to adjust his breathing and movement to suit the high-gravity environment, but just as he took a heavy step forward, gravity seemed to vanish entirely.Caught blindsided, Zhang Lie wobbled into visibility in the next moment.He smiled again at the spires looming before him. It looked as though navigating the terrain would be his first obstacle. As a hunter, however, Zhang Lie was no stranger to such trials, and even grew excited at the prospect of overcoming such hurdles.After all, since his rebirth, he had always been in a rather sheltered environment, and it had been quite a long time since he had had to struggle with such obstacles. Now that he was finally experiencing a challenge again, his indomitable will swelled with excitement.Given his years of experience, navigating the terrain quickly became trivial to him.After traipsing through the surroundings and gaining a sense for the unpredictability of the magnetic field, Zhang Lie was successfully able to step into the spires and begin his hunt for traces of the bimu bears.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: Making PreparationsIn truth, this was Zhang Lie's first time at the Bear Spires, and he had no experience from his past life to draw upon.Amidst the floating spires, Zhang Lie, cloaked in black, began to walk faster and faster. His slow, faltering steps turned into a fast walk, and then a rapid dash. He took only fifteen minutes to get used to the fluctuating magnetic field, then began to scout the region for traces of the bimu bear.He acclimated so quickly not only because he had refined control over his body, but also because of the functionality of his new armor.Once Zhang Lie found a bimu bear, he would be able to track down the location of the Bimu Harbor. After about ten minutes, Zhang Lie finally noticed traces of a superior-grade bimu bear within a valley.This valley was a massive bowl-like depression, and at the very bottom, Zhang Lie saw two bimu bears playing with each other. Seven meters tall, weighing dozens of tons, white-furred all over, with sharp teeth and strong jaws\u2014they were a fearsome sight to behold.What distinguished bimu bears from their terrestrial counterparts was that they had three eyes lined side by side, making them all the more terrifying. According to rumors, adult bimu bears even had some ability to control the magnetic field around them.That being said, Zhang Lie wasn't very interested in this pair, because they were both adult bimu bears, possessing frightening combat ability, and would be near-impossible to isolate.However, after wandering around the spires, Zhang Lie noticed no other bimu bears around.Fatigue drained his strength: traversing the complicated terrain and dealing with the field fluctuations took quite a toll on his body. Zhang Lie had no choice but to rest.It took him two whole days before he eventually found the Bimu Harbor that he had only heard about in his past life.Glancing at the pristine, snowy-white stone in front of him, Zhang Lie couldn't help but marvel at the majesty of the dimensional world, and also at the fact that rumors couldn't be entirely trusted.After all, the so-called Bimu Harbor wasn't a harbor at all, but rather a large outcropping of white rock with a flat top. Against the backdrop of the deep blue sky, the outcropping looked as though it led toward an ocean of blue, granting it its name.And on top of that outcropping lay the bones of a bimu bear.The bear's-heart grass was, Zhang Lie thought, also rather inappropriately named. Rather than calling it bear's-heart grass, bear's-bone grass would be more suitable. The crystalline blades of grass grew not where the bimu bear's heart was, but rather on its bones. They were simply more concentrated around its ribcage.However, even after finding the Bimu Harbor and the bear's-heart grass, Zhang Lie didn't make a move: right then and there, at this mass grave of bimu bears, there were at least a dozen aged bears still with some mobility and fighting strength.Under such circumstances, Zhang Lie certainly wasn't going to act rashly. Instead, he began a second wait, one that lasted a whole week.By then, half the aged bears had died, and none had entered within the last two days. There were only five elderly bears left, and Zhang Lie's chance was finally here.He jumped up onto the outcropping, instantly noticing that gravity seemed to have increased by yet another magnitude. If he hadn't spent the last few days acclimating himself, he could well have dropped out of stealth.As he got used to the even higher gravity, Zhang Lie approached the closest bear carcass and began harvesting the bear's-heart grass. His movements were gentle and slow, but exceedingly tiring in such a fatiguing environment.Zhang Lie could sense the stamina draining out of his body at a rapid pace.He had only harvested ten blades of grass before he felt as though he couldn't lift his arms any further. In fact, were it not for his armor, he thought that he might not have been able to move about on this outcropping at all. The armor was negating much of the increased gravity, and what he was experiencing was only a small fraction of its usual intensity.Under ordinary circumstances, without the need for stealth, Zhang Lie would be able to revitalize and invigorate his body with genetic energy, but Zhang Lie had no choice but to overcome the magnetic field with nothing but his mortal body.He lasted two more minutes, harvesting almost all the bear's-heart grass on the first carcass, before his stamina finally gave out.He retreated from the Bimu Harbor.The next few days were a cycle of resting, waiting, recuperating energy, and harvesting grass.His muscles ached, and he was often bored, but Zhang Lie was proud of what he was able to accomplish.Unfortunately for him, this idyllic period wasn't to last. In just three days, there were four more aged bears up on the Bimu Harbor.Zhang Lie found it hard to imagine just how many bimu bears had to be wandering around the floating spires. After all, these were superior-grade creatures, which were relatively rare in the first realm of the dimensional world.In retrospect, however, it shouldn't have been surprising. The unique geography and environmental factors in the region would prove a significant disadvantage to most hunters, even those at the top of the gene leaderboard. And if no one were to hunt these bimu bears, if they were at the top of the food chain, then certainly their numbers would just keep going up.Zhang Lie rested for another three days.On the last day, Zhang Lie found, at long last, an opportunity to give a dying bimu bear a lethal blow.He didn't know whether the will of the world would recognize such a contemptible attack; as it turned out, it did. After the aged bimu bear died from Venombane, the will of the world spoke up in Zhang Lie's mind,[You successfully killed a superior-grade bimu bear, but did not obtain a soulshard. For consuming the flesh of a bimu bear, you may receive one to ten superior gene fragments.]Naturally, Zhang Lie, under the cover of night, stuffed the bimu bear he had killed into his potbellied-toad pouch.And then he continued his harvest.It took him two whole weeks before he was ready to leave, after having collected over a thousand blades of bear's-heart grass. At the same time, he trained and strengthened his body dramatically in the grueling high-gravity environment of the Bimu Harbor.After his harvest was complete, he immediately left the Bear Spires, then headed back to the Blacksteel settlement as fast as he could. Of course, this time around, instead of heading to the Blackgold Inn, he went to the settlement-owned Blacksteel Inn. He didn't want to have another run-in with Chu Xun, nor for any rumors to spread about what they were doing in a room together.After getting a high-class suite in the Blacksteel Inn, Zhang Lie prepared for a long stint of seclusion. During this period of time, he was planning to consume the bimu bear's flesh, concoct Potion #2, and advance all his genetic techniques.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: Zhang Lie's GrowthWith his preparations complete, Zhang Lie began to brew Potion #2. Compared to Potion #1, the brewing process was at least tenfold more complicated.First, the various ingredients had to be individually prepared.The main ingredient, black coral, had to be nourished with genetic energy until it turned a golden yellow before its herbal properties could be extracted.The bear's-heart grass had to be incinerated into ash, before being combined with the extract of the eye-of-night flower.Preparing each ingredient was a lengthy, tedious, and time-consuming process, one that occupied much of Zhang Lie's time and attention.When he grew hungry, he would consume some roasted bimu bear meat as he continued cultivating his genetic techniques.\u00a0[1]After ten days, as Zhang Lie ate his thirtieth meal of bear meat, he obtained yet another superior gene fragment, his seventh from the bear.At the same time, his genetic core, under the guidance of [Ninecarp Transformation] began to tremble. As the core trembled, it also seemed to compress, and Zhang Lie felt as though something were about to condense in his core.His intuition was right: an S-shaped black strand suddenly emerged within the core. After it appeared, it wrapped around the nimble fish inside. The pale pink fish seemed to lose its vitality, allowing the black strand to cocoon it.As Zhang Lie continued to eat and cultivate, the genetic energy that entered his body all seemed to transform into black strands. In a matter of moments, the fish was completely hidden from sight within a black, elongated cocoon.Zhang Lie felt a curious straining sensation coming from his core, followed by a compression and evolution of his genetic energy. Under such unusual circumstances, he naturally stopped his work and began to focus completely on his genetic core.It took him an entire day to process the evolution, but when it was all over, Zhang Lie's [Ninecarp Transformation] had entered its second form: the serpent. Out of the black cocoon had emerged a black serpent, which was now happily darting around his core.At the same time, Zhang Lie's water-attuned genetic energy gained a second aspect, that of darkness. It was so dark that Zhang Lie felt as though it would leave an indelible stain on anything it touched.The first form, the carp, was water-attuned and mitigated fire damage. The second form, the serpent, was dark-attuned and endowed his attacks with the power of decay and corrosion.Zhang Lie's framework was now dual-attuned, and the metamorphosis had caused the framework to grow to medium-grade, improving his rate of recovery and of condensing genetic energy.Zhang Lie was overjoyed by his growth.He made a gripping motion with his right hand, and an orb of black, crystalline material flashed into existence. From afar, it looked like a crystal orb, but from close up, it seemed like a ball of mysterious, inky water, combining both the expanse of the ocean and a strong corrosive nature that could ruin all that it touched.With his left hand, he grabbed a pipette and touched it against the orb. Black mist rose into the air, and the bulb of the pipette vanished from existence.\"With this power and Venombane, the Void Cup should be a fun experience,\" Zhang Lie murmured, marvelling at his newfound abilities.However, he quickly returned to the task at hand: brewing Potion #2. After a few simple tests, Zhang Lie retracted his genetic energy and returned to the brewing process.It took Zhang Lie a whole month to process the hundreds of ingredients needed for Potion #2, and then to begin the brewing process in earnest. The final result of his struggles was two test tubes, one black and one white.At this critical juncture, Zhang Lie was very nervous\u2014whether all his work within the last month would pay off depended on this very moment. If he were to fail, he would have to restart the arduous month-long process again.He picked up both test tubes, trying his best to allay the trembles in his hands, and began to pour them into a third test tube, ensuring that the two liquids mixed evenly and rapidly with one another.The combination of the black and white liquids produced a sizzling sound within the test tube, and golden wisps of smoke slowly drifted out of it.Only when he saw these golden wisps did Zhang Lie relax, his face warping with excitement.He had succeeded! He really had! A whole month of effort for the test tube in front of him\u2026 He completed Potion #2 on his very first try!Zhang Lie's eyes gleamed as he stared at the concoction still smoking away on the countertop.If he consumed this potion, and if he filled up his missing gene fragments to capacity, then he was sure he would dominate the entire Void Cup.After waiting a few minutes for the mixture to settle, Zhang Lie picked up the sole mixture of Potion #2 in exstence and drained it in one gulp. Potion #1 had been exceedingly spicy, and Potion #2 seemed to be smooth and buttery. Before he could savor the taste of it, it had already slid down his throat, leaving only a refreshing scent of herbal fragrance behind.The next moment, it was replaced by wave after wave of potent herbal strength.Potion #1 made him feel as though he were inflicted with the technique endemic to blood ants: [Bloodbath].Potion #2 made him feel as though he were being submerged in an ocean, his body battered and bruised by each wave that came his way, then reassembled and made whole again. Destruction and regeneration, regeneration and destruction, in an endless cycle.Even with his high pain tolerance, Zhang Lie found himself rolling on the ground, moaning as the potion wracked his body. At the same time, with his body screaming in pain, Zhang Lie could clearly feel his cells bursting with vitality.His pores widened and contracted, his muscles spasmed, his arteries and veins and capillaries were broken down and reinforced.His body seemed to be reforging itself on a fundamental, genetic level.Black, foul-smelling impurities stained his clothing, and he began to sweat as though he had just recovered from a debilitating sickness.His impurities purged, Zhang Lie had gained a measure of resistance against the potent medicinal energy, and he immediately began to marshal it as he activated his [Ninecarp Transformation].The medicinal energy, like cresting ocean waves, rushed into his genetic core. The black serpent within happily frolicked in the golden waves, and Zhang Lie felt the purity and density of his genetic energy reach a new threshold.[For consuming an unknown potion, your mutated gene capacity has been increased.]1.

Based on his stats alone, Zhang Lie was superior to most hunters at the top of the gene leaderboard.Yun Bing and Chu Feng likely still had more superior gene fragments than he did, but he didn't think himself inferior in any other area.With his framework advanced, and with his potion complete, Zhang Lie's month-long seclusion came to an end. His next step was naturally to saturate both his mutated and superior gene capacities.He exited the inn and quickly found Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng. Before he started brewing the potion, he had informed the two of them about his plans, and they would leave a hunter or two outside the Blacksteel Inn daily, waiting for him to emerge.Upon seeing Zhang Lie again, the gathered hunters all noticed the change to Zhang Lie's aura and genetic energy. Although they didn't know precisely what had happened, they were certain that Zhang Lie had just made a great leap forward in his growth as a hunter.Of course, they hadn't been slacking either. Zhang Lie had given them an additional task beyond scouting the whereabouts of superior-grade lifeforms: filling up their mutated gene fragments to capacity.With the superior gene fragments that Zhang Lie had shared with them, and with the superior-grade soulshards that their team leaders possessed, the gathered hunters easily finished this task.\"Captain, it feels like you've grown much stronger,\" Fang Yi remarked, flattering Zhang Lie out of habit.Still exuberant from his success, Zhang Lie nodded. \"A big improvement indeed, but I could say the same for all of you. You're all maxed out on mutated genes, aren't you?\"\"Captain, you've given us such favorable conditions for success\u2014of course we wouldn't fail you now!\" Sun Mengmeng cried out.The other hunters nodded.Zhang Lie laughed. \"In that case, how about your other task? How many of the lifeforms in the booklet have you tracked down?\"\"All but ten or so of them, Captain! We wouldn't dare slack off on a task you personally assigned us,\" Fang Yi jumped in.\"All but ten? You're not lying to me, are you? I must have listed at least fifty superior-grade lifeforms in that booklet!\"Zhang Lie couldn't believe how efficient Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng had been.\"All but ten,\" Fang Yi reaffirmed. \"We wouldn't lie to our beloved captain! We've tracked down most of the lifeforms in the booklet and investigated most of their habitats and behavioral tics. If you're ready, we can start the hunt immediately!\"\"In that case, what are we waiting for?\" Zhang Lie began to smile in earnest. \"You've spent a lot of work preparing this information, so why don't you recommend what our first target should be?\"Fang Yi took out the small booklet that Zhang Lie had handed him in the past. \"Captain, I suggest the longhorn dawnbeetle! Its soulshard grants a rare aural attack to its bearer, and it can replace the soulshard you failed to obtain when you hunted the dreadtoad.\"Zhang Lie glanced at the booklet, which illustrated a giant bug-type lifeform with black chitin dotted with fiery red stars. He had hunted such a lifeform in his past life, and was able to recall quite a bit about it.The longhorn dawnbeetle was a superior-grade fire-attuned lifeform that looked like a massively enlarged version of a terrestrial longhorn beetle.It possessed a supremely hard exoskeleton, and its pincers could erupt in flame, enhancing its extremely strong offensive capabilities. Its cries were aural attacks that could easily bypass shields. Even amidst superior-grade lifeforms, it was a strong existence indeed.Of course, no matter how strong it was, Zhang Lie was confident that he would be able to deal with it now.\"A soulshard that grants an aural attack, along with a number of mutated-grade lifeforms in the vicinity... this isn't a bad choice. In that case\u2014\"\"Wait!\" Just as Zhang Lie was about to announce that the longhorn dawnbeetle would be their first target, Sun Mengmeng interrupted. \"Captain, while I think the longhorn dawnbeetle might be a good choice, it's not the best choice. I would suggest the forest wolfman!\"She picked up the booklet and flipped to the corresponding page.\"The forest wolfman is a humanoid, life-attuned lifeform, with immense regenerative abilities and considerable physical strength. Most importantly, its transformation-type soulshard turns its bearer into a wolfman, which means it preserves the use of techniques and soulshards while in a transformed state. Furthermore, the wolfman also has a penetrating aural attack. Captain, I believe these strengths are particularly suited to you!\"Both Sun Mengmeng and Fang Yi had made their recommendations based on what they knew of Zhang Lie, but Sun Mengmeng had, once again, shown herself to be more thoughtful.The forest wolfman's soulshard was more unique, and granted a larger variety of benefits relative to the longhorn dawnbeetle's. At present, although Zhang Lie had amassed quite a few superior-grade soulshards, he was still missing two main types: a humanoid transformation-type soulshard, and a summoning-type soulshard.A transformation-type soulshard consumed a significant amount of genetic energy, but it could also provide a commensurate amount of strength or flexibility in certain circumstances.A summoning-type soulshard was the rarest of all soulshards, and could only be produced when a superior- or higher-grade lifeform died with extreme regret or unwillingness. A soulshard that formed under such circumstances would be able to house such a lifeform within it.Zhang Lie had never hunted the forest wolfman in his past life, but he had seen a fight by a hunter who had a wolfman soulshard.His memories of that fight were particularly vivid: that hunter recovered impossibly quickly, possessed frightening physical strength, and was both surprisingly agile and endowed with a piercing aural attack.The soulshard would augment almost all aspects of his strength, and since Sun Mengmeng and the others had discovered such a superior-grade lifeform, it certainly should be given priority over the longhorn dawnbeetle.Zhang Lie made up his mind. \"Since you were able to find traces of the forest wolfman, we'll start with that. A humanoid transformation-type soulshard is more precious than all but a summoning-type soulshard, and it should certainly be given priority.\"Our target is the forest wolfman. Go make your preparations now!\"\"Yes, Captain!\"FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: Forest WolvesThe broadleaf forest was, as its name suggested, a forest composed solely of broadleaf trees.Within that forest lived all sorts of wolf-type, rodent-type, and bird-type lifeforms.A seven-member team of hunters was proceeding quickly into the depths of the forest, making such a ruckus that they were clearly unconcerned about attracting the attention of the lifeforms all throughout the forest.Of course, this team of hunters was none other than Zhang Lie's Team Zenith.As they rushed forward, Zhang Lie asked, \"Mengmeng, how far away is the forest wolfman's lair?\"Sun Mengmeng glanced around her. \"We're only about three miles away, Captain!\"\"In that case, let's proceed at full speed.\" Black mist shrouded Zhang Lie as he darted forward even faster than before, wind trailing in his wake.Seeing their captain pulling ahead, Sun Mengmeng and the others immediately sped up as well. It took only moments before they all arrived at the wolfman's lair, a cave in a rocky mountain of middling size.Around the cave sat about a dozen or so wolf-type lifeforms, like royal guards protecting their monarch from harm.Upon seeing Zhang Lie and his team rushing forward, they immediately howled and blocked their way. When they stood up, they were over two meters tall, with sharp horns protruding from their head.The hunters' faces were all calm and collected; after all, these forest wolves might look intimidating, but they were only mutated-grade lifeforms, and hence of essentially no threat to the gathered hunters.The wolves that blocked Zhang Lie's path were each cut apart with a few clean strokes from Venombane, some of them still howling even as they died. With the other hunters dealing with the stragglers, all the wolf guards perished in just one minute.Unfortunately for Zhang Lie, none of them dropped a soulshard. Zhang Lie didn't want to take any chances against such valuable prey, so he was rather concerned about what to do next.As he was deep in thought, however, wolf howls echoed throughout the cave and the mountain. In a matter of moments, hundreds of forest wolves had emerged from the vicinity, surrounding Zhang Lie and his team.The wolves stared at the seven hunters, eyeing them but not rushing forward.At the same time, from within the cave emerged a five-meter tall, bipedal forest wolfman. The forest wolfman was a superior-grade lifeform that evolved from the mutated-grade forest wolf. It was bipedal, with its shoulder and elbow joints having transformed to become more human-like.Except for its hind legs, its anatomy was no different from that of a regular human. Of course, from appearance alone, it still looked like a wolf. Fur covered its entire body, and it had lupine claws and a snout filled with sharp teeth.Upon seeing the carcasses in front of Zhang Lie and the others, it howled, prompting the gathered wolves to rush down from the mountain and leap toward Zhang Lie.\"Kill them!\" Zhang Lie shouted, rushing forward and facing the pack of wolves straight on.The wolves' bodies seemed to split apart almost before they reached Zhang Lie, most of them dying before they could even get a good look at his appearance. The disparity in their strength was simply too large.Even Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, and the others found it quite easy to deal with even such a large pack of wolves. A dozen had already fallen to Fang Yi's obsidian spear, and Sun Mengmeng's sunbird bow was all but designed for such fights. The wolves couldn't even approach her, let alone harm her.Despite seeing their comrades perish, the wolves didn't shrink back. As the wolfman howled again, they surged forward at full strength, emboldened and fearless. The wolfman himself joined in the fight, pouncing toward Zhang Lie.However, what surprised the hunters\u2014and even the wolfman himself\u2014was that Zhang Lie darted toward the left flank of wolves instead, continuing to slaughter them rather than face the wolfman.Why would he avoid a direct confrontation now? Wasn't their objective the forest wolfman? Given their captain's strength, he could certainly handle the wolfman easily, so why wasn't he fighting?Zhang Lie scowled as he tore apart wolf after wolf. He was having a remarkably bad string of luck, and he hadn't yet obtained a mutated-grade forest wolf soulshard yet.He needed one to guarantee that a superior-grade soulshard would drop, so he certainly didn't want to attack the forest wolfman until he had one in his possession.The forest wolfman was naturally enraged that its opponent was simply ignoring it. With a fearsome howl and an explosion of life-green genetic energy, the vines in the forest began to grow rapidly, shooting toward and wrapping around Zhang Lie as if they had been endowed with life.\"Captain, we're coming to help you!\" The other hunters immediately began shooting long-ranged attacks toward the forest wolfman, trying to distract it from its attack.However, the moment they made their move, Zhang Lie shouted, \"There's no need! Just protect yourselves and leave him to me.\"A flurry of quick slices cut apart all the vines heading in his direction. At the same time, Zhang Lie beheaded a mutated-grade forest wolf rushing toward him. With a puff of green smoke, a dark green soulshard condensed on its head.Zhang Lie's eyes lit up expectantly. With this mutated-grade soulshard in hand, he was sure to get a superior-grade forest wolfman soulshard now!As he reached out for the soulshard, the forest wolfman, wreathed in sparks of green genetic energy, pounced toward him.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: Soulshard in HandWith a huge crash, the forest wolfman's pouncing attack smashed a huge hole in the ground, but Zhang Lie's body vanished the instant his claws swiped through it.The next moment, in a flurry of shadows, before the forest wolfman could respond, Zhang Lie appeared behind his head. A violet shortsword struck him, seemingly from an extradimensional space.Just before the attack landed, the wolfman's fur rose up and shot out in the direction of the attack, preventing what would have been a lethal blow and sapping Zhang Lie of his momentum. While Zhang Lie was dealing with the fur, a claw came from his right, forcing him to defend against the sudden attack.Zhang Lie activated [Rippling Walk], then vanished from sight once more. Reappearing by the wolfman's left flank, he thrust at the wolfman's unprotected side.Clang! Despite his speed and stealth, the blade still struck a claw. As expected, a superior-grade lifeform was superior-grade indeed. Even if the wolfman weren't able to sense Zhang Lie until the very last moment, his agility and reflexes were still sufficient to block Zhang Lie's blow.However, the corrosive strength of Venombane caused the wolfman to let out a pained howl. His claw had only touched it for an instant, but it was already corroding, and his paw was bloodied and throbbing.Fortunately for the wolfman, his life-attuned genetic energy was a perfect counter for Zhang Lie. In a flash of green light, his claw was refreshed, and his injuries vanished as though he had never sustained them.Zhang Lie immediately understood that this was an opponent he couldn't hope to exhaust to death. His techniques and reservoir of genetic energy were insufficient to overcome the wolfman's regeneration. If he were to eke out a victory, he would have to be fast and decisive.Enraged, the forest wolfman took the offensive. As it howled, tendril after tendril of vine snapped up from the ground, stitching together into a large, intricate web all around it.Zhang Lie had to admit that this particular forest wolfman was quite gifted at combat, having identified the weakness in Zhang Lie's stealth in just two or three clashes. The web of vines would massively reduce the space in which Zhang Lie could operate and hinder his ability to perform sneak attacks.Ding! Ding! As the vines filled the air, the forest wolfman clashed with Zhang Lie in close combat, claws against blade. The wolfman's actions were particularly agile, and his claws seemed to strike at Zhang Lie from all directions.Surprisingly, he was able to fight on equal footing with Zhang Lie.The strength of this particular forest wolfman was shocking. Although Zhang Lie had yet to use any of his soulshards but Venombane, nor any of his higher-grade genetic techniques, an ordinary superior-grade lifeform certainly wouldn't be able to withstand Zhang Lie's strength after he consumed Potion #2.And yet, under these conditions, the wolfman was about to gain the upper hand. As the vines filled the air around them, Zhang Lie's mobility became severely restricted.\"I have to admit I've underestimated you. In that case, take this! [Fists of the Silent Sea]!\" As Zhang Lie defended against the wolfman's claws with Venombane in his right hand, he attacked him with his left fist.Fist and claw met in a giant explosion, filling the air with ripples of dark genetic energy. These ripples struck the wolfman's left arm and elbow, distorting them as though marring a surface of still water.With a few loud cracks, the forest wolfman's arm was paralyzed and hung limply by his side.The forest wolfman howled, and the web of vines he was controlling snapped apart. With his left arm severely injured, he had no choice but to give up on attacking Zhang Lie and to retreat instead.As he howled, a wave of sound shot toward Zhang Lie, not intending to wound him, but only to deter his subsequent attacks. One fist, just one fist, had caused the bones of his left arm to crack and splinter, and even his life-attuned genetic energy wouldn't be able to heal such a severe injury instantaneously.Of course, Zhang Lie wasn't going to give up on his prey. As the wolfman retreated, Zhang Lie gathered all his genetic energy and broke through the wolfman's barrier of sound.The wolfman had just retreated, and the bones of his left arm just about to reform, when he sensed a shadowy figure by his back. Before he could react, Zhang Lie's left palm had already struck his back.With a loud thump, the black ripples appeared once more, and the forest wolfman spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. He felt as though all his organs had suffered internal injury in the aftermath of the attack, and the genetic energy throughout his body instinctively retreated to his genetic core, lowering his defenses to their minimum.He would pay a price for exposing such weakness, and that price would be his life.A violet shortsword thrust deeply into the wolfman's unprotected head. Corrosive dark genetic energy burst from the wound, causing the wolfman's head to decay instantly, a lethal blow. As dark green blood shot out of the wound, the forest wolfman let out a dying howl.Zhang Lie's left hand, hidden from sight, smashed a mutated-grade forest wolf soulshard to splinters. On top of the wolfman's head, a fist-sized, dark jade soulshard was rapidly condensing.Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, and the gathered hunters' faces lit up at the sight. From their perspective, it wasn't all that difficult to find a superior-grade lifeform; what was rare was to have it condense a soulshard after its death.This was especially true for the rarer superior-grade lifeforms, such as the forest wolfman. It was certainly more likely than not that no soulshard would condense after a kill, so the fact that Zhang Lie had gotten the exact soulshard he wanted on his first attempt shocked them all.Not everyone could claim to have such good fortune, after all.On the other hand, Zhang Lie wasn't surprised: after all, his secret knowledge changed what would otherwise be a stochastic event into a deterministic one. With a sweep of his hand, he stored the superior-grade forest wolfman soulshard in his soulspace.The pack of forest wolves rapidly backed down upon hearing the forest wolfman's dying howl, disappearing without a trace.Having gotten what he wanted, Zhang Lie didn't intend to give chase. He gathered the other hunters over, had them store the mutated- and higher-grade carcasses, and then left with them.Thus ended their first hunt as Team Zenith. They had accomplished all their objectives, and Zhang Lie was in a particularly good mood. Instead of heading back to the settlement directly, however, they went straight toward their next target: the longhorn dawnbeetle.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: A Surprise EncounterEven with his entire clan, the forest wolfman wasn't able to do much against Zhang Lie, let alone a solitary lifeform like the longhorn dawnbeetle, which died after just two or three attacks.However, it was exactly because such lifeforms were solitary that it was difficult to find many such mutated-grade dawnbeetles, and Zhang Lie was therefore unable to guarantee that a soulshard would condense. This particular dawnbeetle did not, and all Zhang Lie and the others would get from it was its flesh.However, that didn't matter much to Zhang Lie, who had already obtained the better superior-grade forest wolfman soulshard.After killing two superior-grade lifeforms, along with the various mutated-grade lifeforms they encountered along the way, it became dark, and Team Zenith's first day of hunting was over.The hunters had all witnessed Zhang Lie's strength, and they were particularly glad to have someone like him as their captain. Some of them were already making plans to head to the city of Ning to meet Zhang Lie in real life.Team Zenith sat around the table in Zhang Lie's suite at the Blacksteel Inn. Ever since they had taken Zhang Lie as their captain, they had always divided up their spoils in one inn or another. In the past, they didn't have such a surplus of points that they could afford to stay in one of the inns, and had to set up camp in a designated part of the Blacksteel settlement instead.The carcasses of several mutated-grade lifeforms, as well as the two superior-grade ones, were casually laid out on the floor of the large, expansive, living room.\"Mengmeng, Zhou Ying, I'll leave the cooking to you two again! Everyone else, help set up the table and prepare. This is a feast we all worked hard for!\" Under Zhang Lie's command, the gathered hunters got to work.In almost no time at all, a sumptuous feast was ready to be served, and the ravenous hunters dug in with joy, their conversations punctuated by announcements from the will of the world.As the feast was wrapping up, Yang Ze stood up somewhat tipsily and bowed deeply toward Zhang Lie. \"Captain, I was awed by your strength today. I was beginning to suspect that you were a hunter who had even filled up his superior gene fragments to capacity! Who else would be able to kill a superior-grade lifeform in two or three blows?\"Tomorrow, I'll be heading toward the city of Ning. Please accept me as a disciple and teach me how to grow stronger!\"Zhang Lie hadn't anticipated something like this, but he reacted quickly. \"You want to be my disciple? Come if you'd like.\"His response was surprisingly casual. Zhang Lie was already making plans for the construction of the Zenith dojo, and Yang Ze's request came at a particularly opportune time.When the other hunters saw how easily Yang Ze managed to become Zhang Lie's disciple, they were all quite envious, particularly Li Feng, whose family background wasn't illustrious. How could he give up this opportunity to grow stronger? He immediately emulated Yang Ze, requesting to head to Ning and become Zhang Lie's disciple as well.Zhang Lie was intending to open a dojo, so he certainly didn't mind accepting multiple disciples. Seeing Yang Ze and Li Feng's successful apprenticeships, the other four hunters, Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng included, all naturally became Zhang Lie's disciples as well.The hunters promised that they would leave the dimensional world that night and teleport themselves to Ning early tomorrow. As a result, they wrapped up their sumptuous feast rather early. After finishing up the last dish, they departed to pack and to prepare for the journey lying ahead of them.In truth, they were quite interested in meeting with each other in real life, and also with Zhang Lie.The lively suite quickly turned quiet, and Zhang Lie felt a trace of loneliness. Of course, that loneliness dissipated as soon as he inspected his stats.After consuming the flesh of two superior-grade lifeforms and four mutated-grade lifeforms, Zhang Lie's stats had gained another big boost.Zhang Lie: a mortal lifeformFramework: Foundation, Lv. MAX, Ninecarp Transformation, Second Form: SerpentTechniques: Rippling Walk (advanced), Three-Wave Crescendo (advanced), Calm Waters (advanced), Fists of the Silent Sea (intermediate), The Boundless Blade (novice)Genes: Basic, 160; Mutated, 132; Superior, 55Soulshards: White Grub (superior), Galewolf (mutated), Blood Ant (superior), Potbellied Toad (mutated), Venombane Scorpion (superior), Eternalspring Cocoon (superior), Forest Wolfman (superior)For a hunter of the first realm, these stats were ridiculous. He had obtained fifteen more superior gene fragments, and had thirty-two excess mutated gene fragments. These excess mutated fragments were limit fragments that were even more impactful than thirty-two superior gene fragments.If he were to face off against the forest wolfman from that morning again, the wolfman likely wouldn't be able to withstand a single blow from him now.These additional gene fragments caused Zhang Lie's strength to grow to a jawdropping level, and even Yun Bing and Chu Feng, whose superior gene fragments were almost at capacity, wouldn't be able to compete against him.As Zhang Lie was lost in his thoughts, the doorbell rang. He commanded the robot in the kitchen to begin cleaning up as he walked to the door.Zhang Lie expected that his errant visitor would be a hunter from Team Zenith who had misplaced an item or two in his suite, but after his encounter with Chu Xun, Zhang Lie had begun to take visitors much more seriously.He almost jumped in shock as he saw the hunters waiting outside: Yun Bing, Yun Meng, Chu Feng, and Chu Xun. How had they found him so quickly?But since they were already at his doorstep, Zhang Lie didn't intend on hiding any further. He opened the door, not even putting on his black cloak beforehand.Yun Bing and Chu Feng recognized him immediately.\"Zhang Lie!\" they shouted at once, thinking that he was in the middle of a meeting with the mysterious hunter in black.After all, who would guess that Zhang Lie and the mysterious hunter were one and the same? The disparity in strength between them was simply too large.As it turned out, Chu Xun would. She had seen Zhang Lie's appearance before, and when she heard her brother and Yun Bing calling out Zhang Lie's name, she was quite flummoxed.\u00a0Isn't this Blackie? How could it be\u2014unless, unless Blackie is... Zhang Lie?!FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: Unmasked\"You're Zhang Lie?!\" In the end, Chu Xun couldn't resist asking the question right then and there, shocking Chu Feng and Yun Bing.\"That's right. Is there a problem?\" Zhang Lie admitted to his identity with a smile on his face.Her gobsmacked expression immediately caught the attention of the hunters around her. \"In that case, y-you...\"\"What's the matter, Chu Xun?\" Chu Feng asked in concern. He then glanced at Zhang Lie. He might have had to show some respect to that mysterious hunter, but Zhang Lie didn't afford the same respect from him. After all, Zhang Lie had long been at the bottom of the gene leaderboard, and it would be trivially easy for the Chu clan to crush him.\"He, he's\u2014\" Chu Xun wanted to expose Zhang Lie's identity, but the more urgent she was, the more tongue-tied she became.\"That's right, I'm Zhang Lie. It looks like all of you must be in a hurry, if you've already found this place. Please, come in.\" Zhang Lie welcomed them into the suite, his voice lowering into the smooth baritone that he used as the mysterious hunter, but neither Yun Bing nor Chu Feng noticed anything amiss at first.As they walked into the living room and processed the unusually familiar voice, however, they felt as though something was off, but couldn't pinpoint precisely what.Chu Feng noticed a black cloak draped over a chair, the exact one that the mysterious hunter wore. He immediately pointed to it and exclaimed in shock, \"Where's that mysterious fellow?\"Chu Feng felt as though he were disconnected from reality. All the clues were there, but his mind refused to process them. The same was true of Yun Bing and Yun Meng, who had suddenly realized why they found Zhang Lie's voice so familiar.Why did Zhang Lie sound like the mysterious hunter? Why did Chu Xun behave so strangely when she saw Zhang Lie? Why did she seem to act so familiarly around him?There was only one reasonable conclusion, but it certainly didn't seem reasonable at all: the mysterious hunter had to be Zhang Lie!But how could this be? Zhang Lie was a weakling, and the mysterious hunter was stronger than even them! Could it be true?\"Yes, yes, I'm him and he's me. You understand what I'm saying, don't you?\" Zhang Lie confirmed the doubts in their mind, but they were all shocked speechless by his words.He was Zhang Lie? Zhang Lie was him?A pregnant silence filled the room. The more the hunters thought about it, the less they were able to accept this supposed reality.After all, believing that Zhang Lie and the mysterious hunter were one and the same meant that they also had to accept the fact that Zhang Lie was the one who had stolen the superior-grade venombane scorpion from under their nose. It also meant that they had to accept the fact that they had all been dancing on Zhang Lie's palms that night.\"Are you really the mysterious hunter who sold us information about the foundational breakthrough?\" Yun Bing asked for confirmation.\"Indeed!\" Zhang Lie smiled again, responding in the affirmative.Yun Bing very much wanted to tear that smile off his face but her formal upbringing wouldn't allow that. In the end, she barely suppressed that thought and gave herself a small, mirthless chuckle.\"To think that I, the top hunter on the gene leaderboard, would be manipulated by you, who were once at the very bottom\u2026 Laughable, how very laughable. Why reveal your identity now? Are you deliberately trying to humiliate us?\"Yun Bing's mind was a mess of complicated emotion, and Chu Feng felt much the same way. \u00a0 \"Are you certain you can pay the price for this deception?\" he added.Zhang Lie seemed unperturbed by the accusations thrown his way. \"Let me emphasize that I've never had any intention of playing around with either of you. Do you feel like you've been toyed with?\"Blame your conceit, your overwhelming self-esteem, your condescension of those beneath you. You asked me if I was willing to accept the consequences of my deception. Of course I am. Would I have appeared in front of you like this otherwise?\"Zhang Lie's frankness was something they, who had been pandered to all their lives, had little experience with.Yun Bing and Chu Feng couldn't help but think of the Qin, Wang, and Li clans. The last two clans that had gone against Zhang Lie had suffered devastating losses as a result, and the anger stewing in their minds was instantly snuffed out by an icy breeze.This \"king of the dumps\", who had been mocked by just about every hunter in the Blacksteel settlement, suddenly seemed to have become a mysterious entity of overwhelming strength. His words were logical: given that he was revealing his identity to them now, he was certainly prepared for any retribution on their part, and not only themselves as hunters, but also their clan.One thought snaked through Yun Bing and Chu Feng's minds: Zhang Lie was a dangerous fellow indeed. Regardless of whether or not the acquisition of the white-grub cores would be successful, they were sure to warn their clans to stay well away from this frightening hunter.Of course, just because they thought that way didn't mean that their siblings would, too.Chu Xun and Yun Meng were both shocked by the sudden revelation, but unlike their older siblings, they were fascinated by Zhang Lie's secret persona and fearless attitude.\"How cool!\" Yun Meng murmured subconsciously, giving Yun Bing and Chu Feng both a start.Before Yun Bing could correct her thinking, beside her, Chu Xun piped up with stars in her eyes, \"Just one hunter alone, bringing down the Qin, Wang, and Li clans... amazing!\"\"From today onwards, you're my idol, Zhang Lie!\"\"I'm going to be your top fan!\"Yun Bing and Chu Feng were speechless at their siblings' attitudes.What sort of situation was this? They barely avoided becoming enemies, but their younger siblings were siding with the opposition? What were they to do?\"Don't be ridiculous,\" Zhang Lie chided Yun Meng and Chu Xun gently, then turned to their older counterparts. \"As for the two of you, are you ready to negotiate now? You've come looking for me because of my stockpile of white-grub cores, haven't you? I'll let you in on a secret: I have another breakthrough that I'm prepared to share with the two of you if the price is right.\"Chu Feng and Yun Bing gaped. Another discovery like the breakthrough in the foundational framework? They had to acquire the information at all costs!Chu Feng certainly couldn't resist the temptation. He had no choice but to humbly apologize to Zhang Lie. \"In front of you, I truly have no right to be prideful. But don't worry, I promise this won't happen again. Now, can you tell us about this new breakthrough you have?\"FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: Common Welfare\"One thing at a time, surely. \u00a0We'd better start off with the negotiations for the white-grub cores first,\" Zhang Lie proposed.He couldn't help smirking at Chu Feng's sudden change in attitude; he certainly wasn't going to give his secrets away all at once.Seeing the smirk on Zhang Lie's face, Chu Feng and Yun Bing blushed in embarrassment, but their discomfort only deepened Zhang Lie's smile.\"Have a seat.\" Zhang Lie motioned to the table in the living room. Yun Bing and Chu Feng would be his future collaborators, and he didn't want to alienate their relationship. He assuaged their embarrassment and redirected their attention to the deal, then headed for the table without turning back around.Chu Feng and Yun Bing followed behind him.As they sat, Zhang Lie cut to the heart of the matter. \"How many cores do you want to buy, and at what cost?\"\"You'll set the price, of course. As for the quantity, I'm intending to purchase ten thousand cores!\" Chu Feng exclaimed\"And you aren't afraid I'll try to rip you off?\"Chu Feng and Yun Bing both shook their heads. How much could the cores of what was essentially the lowest-grade lifeform in the dimensional world cost?\"Good, very good. I like working with the two of you, so for our first transaction, I'll give you a 50% discount: 10,000 points per core.\"What?! 10,000 points per core, and this was a 50% discount? Who would buy these cores at such an insane price? Ten thousand cores would cost a hundred million points!The Yun and Chu clans were quite wealthy, but even Yun Bing and Chu Feng couldn't help quailing at this price.\"You're charging such an exorbitant price?!\" Chu Feng shouted.\"If you're interested, we can carry out the transaction right away.\" Zhang Lie's expression made it seem as though they ought to be grateful for his discount, making Yun Bing and Chu Feng want to tug out their hair and scream.Given such an exorbitant price, they wouldn't be able to make a decision on behalf of their clan. They had expected to be able to buy the white-grub cores for a rate no steeper than a thousand points per pound. A thousand points wasn't much to scoff at\u2014that was ten thousand dollars! Were they too naive, or was Zhang Lie simply too greedy?Even established clans like the Chu and Yun clans didn't make all that many points a year. Neither of them had the authority to handle a hundred-million point transaction, but they had already pledged to buy that many cores!\"...in that case, can I just buy a hundred cores for now?\" Chu Feng gave up on his pride entirely. He didn't want to go back to his clan empty-handed, so what else could he do?Honestly, he didn't want to make any transactions with Zhang Lie at all\u2014no, he didn't want to meet, encounter, or interact with him in any shape or form. Zhang Lie was a human-skinned demon, he was sure of it!Zhang Lie nodded sagely. \"That's right, you should only buy what you can afford. As for you, Miss Yun Bing? \u00a0How many would you like to buy?\"Zhang Lie turned to Yun Bing, who was glancing at him rather thoughtfully. In the end, she smiled wryly. \"At this price, I can also only afford a hundred.\"They thought they were well-prepared for this transaction, but in the end, all they could afford were a hundred cores each.Zhang Lie's smile was still plastered on his face. \"I know you both think that this price is exorbitant, but neither of you have felt the increase in your strength after this breakthrough, and neither of you know that these white grubs are about to be hunted to extinction. To tell you the truth, I'm intending on announcing the news about a foundational breakthrough in public.\"\"What?\" Both Chu Feng and Yun Bing jumped in shock.Was Zhang Lie going to announce a secret of this magnitude in public? Wouldn't it be normal to try to keep it a secret that only those in the clan would know about? Why would he publicize it? Surely he wasn't so benevolent as to do it for nothing?This one meeting had given both Chu Feng and Yun Bing a year's worth of shocks.\"Is it that unusual? Of course the public has to know about such a big boon! I'm not like you clans, trying to secure every advantage and keeping it hidden from everyone else. For humanity to grow, we need to be working together, but all you're thinking about is inter-clan politics!\"\u00a0[1]Neither of them knew what to say to Zhang Lie any longer.That being said, if Zhang Lie did go through with his plan, then the price of these white-grub cores would surely go through the roof, wouldn't they?After extensive testing, both clans had realized that kelpfish roe and bluewater frog meat were both useless for the breakthrough, and was simply a smokescreen that Zhang Lie had devised to prevent them from realizing the truth sooner.White-grub cores were the key ingredient for the foundational breakthrough, but this key ingredient was wholly under Zhang Lie's control. Based on their estimates, Zhang Lie had over a hundred thousand white-grub cores, a veritable fortune, especially if the news were to be publicly released.The two of them felt a brief moment of regret that they hadn't hunted these white-grub cores themselves.Zhang Lie, who had been the laughingstock of the entire settlement for several months, had completely changed Yun Bing and Chu Feng's perception of him. Both of them feared and respected the mysterious hunter in front of them; after all, be it in the short- or long-term, his plans far exceeded their expectations.\"Will you allow us to discuss the purchase of these cores with our elders?\" Yun Bing suddenly asked, disregarding her pride. \"We aren't authorized to handle transactions of such large magnitude.\"Zhang Lie naturally agreed.Yun Bing and Chu Feng both left hurriedly after their hundred-core transactions to deliberate with their respective clans, the shock from the information presented to them that day evident on their faces.Amidst this torrent of information, they had completely forgotten about Zhang Lie's mention of another breakthrough.1. He says this, but he's still keeping his information about soulshard condensation a secret...\u00a0\u261cFavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: The Zenith DojoZhang Lie didn't mind delaying that other business prospect of his a little while longer. After all, such information was more precious the longer he waited to announce it.After seeing the other hunters off, Zhang Lie left his suite and prepared to return to the real world. The hunters of Team Zenith were about to make their way over, and he had to prepare himself for their encounter.He immediately contacted the lawyer whose services he had made use of when purchasing his house from Wang Jianxin. Lawyers of this time and age were well-versed in anything that dealt with contracts and the law, and Zhang Lie's purpose was to purchase another plot of land.The lawyer he had worked with in the past, Zhang Hong, had handled the contract deftly, and he intended on working with her again.\"It's good to hear from you, Mr. Zhang. Will you require my services urgently, given that you're making such a late call?\"Zhang Hong's hologram gave Zhang Lie a businesslike smile, etiquette that wasn't reflected on Zhang Lie's part: he was smoking a cigarette and lounging back on a recliner, one foot propped up on the knee of the other.\"To say it's urgent would be an overkill, but to say it's not urgent would be an understatement.\"Zhang Hong raised her eyebrows. \"Mr. Zhang, it's already quite late at night, and these aren't my regular work hours. If there's something urgent, I will be happy to help. Otherwise, if you don't mind, I'm about to rest, and I'm sure the same applies to you.\"Zhang Lie's nonsense would have caused any other lawyer to hang up by now, and Zhang Hong's restrained chiding was better than he had expected. \"Lawyer Zhang, I admire your professionalism. In that case, I'd like to leave this task in your capable hands. Put simply, I want to purchase the land rights for all the land within a kilometer of my house.\"Zhang Lie's words shocked Lawyer Zhang into stunned silence. All the land within a kilometer of his house? It was true that Zhang Lie lived in the slums, and that the price of land here was far cheaper than it would otherwise be, but this was all relative.The investment needed to buy up so much land would be a massive sum no matter where the land was. And if he wanted the land rights, he would have to buy up the houses in the area too. A conservative estimate for so much land would be at least hundreds of millions of dollars.Zhang Lie's current residence was a recent purchase, and hadn't he spent one or two million dollars on it? What was he thinking now, trying to purchase the entire neighborhood?If she remembered correctly, he lived alone with his sister, so where would he even get so much money? Surely he was drunk!Despite the thoughts flitting through her brain, Zhang Hong's smile remained as placid and professional as ever. \"Mr. Zhang, have you been drinking? I'm afraid you may be a little muddleheaded at the moment. Thank you for keeping me in mind, but I'm sorry, I'm about to rest, and I still have to work tomorrow.\"Zhang Lie thought that Zhang Hong was really quite patient to have lasted so long into his charade. Before she could leave, he slid a gold-rimmed black card out of his back pocket and waved it at her. \"Lawyer Zhang, I'm not kidding. I'm a hunter in the dimensional world, after all.\"Zhang Hong's eyes bulged, and her professional smile vanished in the blink of an eye.\"My goodness, Mr. Zhang, I\u2014I do profusely apologize! I failed to recognize just how qualified you were to make such a purchase.\"Those gold-rimmed black cards were only given to clients with a credit limit of millions of points, so Zhang Lie himself surely had assets totaling at least a hundred million. He hadn't been drunk at all! This man before her, though only in his early twenties, had the funds to back up his words!It seemed as though he had chanced upon a stroke of fortune in the dimensional world.\"I don't mind. Shall we discuss the matter further?\" He smiled, dismissing their earlier conversation.Zhang Hong, faced with the prospect of such a lucrative request, immediately perked up. Although she had been feeling somewhat tired, her desire to sleep had vaporized. \"Mr. Zhang, your request involves such a large sum of money that I would feel far more comfortable with a face-to-face conversation. Would you mind giving me a few minutes to get ready and head over?\"\"Sure. It isn't too late yet, so I'm happy to host you for a while.\"\"Very good, Mr. Zhang. I'll be at your estate in about fifteen minutes.\" Zhang Hong terminated the call, then beamed in excitement. This would be the largest transaction that she had handled in her career, and she would regret it for the rest of her life if she failed to secure it now.As for Zhang Lie, he took a quick shower before Zhang Hong arrived.The rest was simple. Zhang Lie informed her of his demands, and they quickly reached an agreement. Zhang Lie planned to have Zhang Hong handle everything on his behalf, and he would give her ten days to do so. Within ten days, he wanted to see the land rights for the land within a kilometer of his house.Given the amount of money he was investing into the land, Zhang Hong easily agreed. He was willing to purchase the nearby properties for one and a half times their standard value, as well as grease the wheels a little to make the acquisition proceed more rapidly.The residents of the slums were in luck: this much money would allow them to buy up houses outside the slums, giving them better living conditions for essentially no cost at all. Who would refuse such an offer?Time seemed to pass quickly, but it took two hours before Zhang Hong and Zhang Lie worked out the details of the contract. Upon seeing Zhang Lie sign his name, Zhang Hong breathed out a sigh of relief, followed by a surge of excitement that filled her entire body. This was the biggest deal of her career!\"Thank you for your trust in me, Mr. Zhang. I, Zhang Hong, will do my best to guarantee a speedy acquisition!\"Zhang Lie nodded. \"If you handle this matter well, I'll preferentially consider your services in the future. I hope you won't give me any reason to doubt my trust in you. Please acquire the land rights as quickly as you can.\"Zhang Hong nodded, then asked offhandedly, \"Might I ask what you plan on using the land for?\"\"I intend on building a dojo right here.\"A dojo for hunters of the dimensional world?\u00a0Zhang Hong was taken aback once more.\u00a0A dojo right here in the slums, with no nearby facilities to support it?She blinked a few times. Who would want to train in a dojo under such circumstances and in such conditions?FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: CongregationOf course, whether or not there would be any disciples willing to train with Zhang Lie wasn't something that she, Zhang Hong, had to concern herself with. After the customary farewell, Zhang Hong left with her briefcase.Zhang Lie, who had worked hard the entire day, slumped into bed and immediately fell asleep.The next morning, just as the first rays of dawn shone through the window, as Zhang Lie lay drooling in bed, dreaming sweet dreams, the doorbell rang.\"Master, Master, you have a guest!\" The robotic housekeeper slid toward Zhang Lie's bed and began trying to wake him up.Zhang Lie groaned. \"Who is it? Who's here so early in the day? Go open the door.\"As he blearily rubbed his eyes and stretched, Zhang Lie began the arduous process of waking up. The moment he pushed his blankets away and walked out of his bedroom, a young woman rushed up to him.\"Surprise!\"It was the first of the hunters from Team Zenith. Zhang Lie expected that the first hunter to get to his house would be Yang Ze, but it turned out to be Sun Mengmeng.She flitted around the house in a pale blue dress, looking quite a bit more relaxed than she did as a hunter in the dimensional world. She seemed to have deliberately put on makeup to leave a good first impression on everyone in Team Zenith, and it was certainly paying off.\"Welcome to my place, Mengmeng. Have a seat\u2014I just woke up, so I'm going to go wash up.\"Despite this being their first encounter in real life, Zhang Lie seemed to be as casual with Sun Mengmeng as they were in the dimensional world. It gave Sun Mengmeng the impression that they were already rather familiar with each other, because Zhang Lie behaved much the same way in the Blacksteel settlement.She smiled. \"Captain, did you just wake up? And here I thought all the top hunters preferred to practice at a dojo in the morning!\"Zhang Lie couldn't respond, because he was currently brushing his teeth.After he gurgled, he countered, \"Training at a dojo? Is that useful? Why not kill a few lifeforms in the dimensional world instead?\"There was some argument for Zhang Lie's proposition. Quite a few teenagers had trained in a dojo since their childhood, but quailed the moment they entered the dimensional world and saw a ferocious lifeform for the first time. What good would their trained constitution do for them then?\"Both in moderation, surely,\" Sun Mengmeng replied. \"Since I'm here early, would you like me to make some breakfast?\" After all, she was largely responsible for food preparation in the team, and cooking was second nature to her by now.\"That'd be great!\" Zhang Lie called back from the bathroom. He had just been wondering what to do for breakfast. By the time he finished washing up, there were already three dishes set on the dining table: coddled eggs, slices of ham, and fresh soy milk.Having passed through Sun Mengmeng's hands, the three rather simple dishes were elevated to sophistication. Zhang Lie was full of praise for the food.After breakfast, they sat together in the living room waiting for the other hunters from Team Zenith to show up. Within half an hour, the next hunter, Li Feng, was here. The rest of the team trickled in over the next hour or so: Fang Yi, Sun Xiaowu, and Zhou Ying.However, Yang Ze, who had demonstrated the most eagerness to come, had yet to arrive.Zhang Lie couldn't help but start to worry. Of them all, Yang Ze had the most illustrious background. Could his clan have forbidden his sudden move?\"Fang Yi, Yang Ze was originally one of your teammates. How much do you know about his family situation? Could he have been waylaid by members of his clan?\"Another hour had passed without his appearance.Fang Yi thought about it for a moment, but shook his head. \"No, Captain, that wouldn't happen. Yang Ze's basically been exiled from his clan, and the rest of his clan would gladly chase him away given the opportunity. But since he's all the way over on Mars, he likely woke up late and missed the scheduled teleportation. I'll message him and see if he's about to arrive.\"Just as Fang Yi tapped out a message, Yang Ze's voice could be heard from outside. \"I'm here, everyone! Fang Yi, you must have missed me \u00a0if you're sending me such an urgent message!\"He appeared in the doorway with a few suitcases trailing behind him.\"Sorry, sorry, Captain, I had a hard time finding my way around the slums.\"Finally, all the members of Team Zenith were gathered. Zhang Lie's small living room was packed to the brim with luggage and people.\"Be more punctual next time, you hear?\" Zhang Lie clicked his tongue.Yang Ze gave him a mock salute. \"Yes, Captain!\"\"Alright, now that everyone's here, have a seat and I'll discuss the next stage of my plan. First, welcome to Ning, and welcome to my house. I've called you all over for two reasons: first, to have you help me set up a dojo, and second, to have you purge yourselves of your genetic techniques and begin anew, so as to gain access to what I've been calling limit fragments.\"Both of these were topics that Zhang Lie had yet to broach with any of the members of Team Zenith, and they were both of significant importance.Each was like a jolt to their heart.The first issue was the dojo. Dojos had sprung up shortly after the discovery of the dimensional world, and they had developed into a professional enterprise. At present, one would need to be at least a superior-grade hunter to meet the required qualifications.Although their captain had quite a lot of points, he was still a mortal lifeform, and he had yet to advance into the second realm of the dimensional world. Compared to most other dojo leaders, he would be underqualified.The second issue, of purging their techniques and starting from scratch, was much more significant and personal.Although they had been quite curious about how Zhang Lie had managed to dominate Li Hong despite having about the same number of stats, their genetic techniques were such an important part of their strength that they would certainly hesitate before giving them up.After all, how were they to fight in the dimensional world without their techniques?Sensing the hunters' hesitation, Zhang Lie smiled. \"It looks like all of you need some time to think about this, so let's deal with lodgings for the moment. My place is so small that you certainly won't all be able to stay here, so we'll need to find you places to live first. Once we've gotten that sorted out, we can discuss what I've brought up today.\"They rolled up their sleeves and got to work.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: UltimatumFinding a place to live wasn't a problem for the other hunters. Given their newfound wealth, they were easily able to find a few places for rent just a kilometer or so away from Zhang Lie's house.By the time they made all their preparations and gathered again, they had decided to purge their genetic techniques and start anew, as Zhang Lie had suggested. The reason they had all come to Ning was all because of Zhang Lie, so why hesitate now?Zhang Lie's generosity was evident from the way he handled the superior-grade soulshards he had obtained as loot from Li Hong. If Zhang Lie really wanted to hurt them, he could have done so within the dimensional world, and there was no need for him to gather them here.\"I'm glad you're all willing to trust me. I promise you'll not regret the decision you've made today! Both stages of my plan can be carried out simultaneously. I've already started acquiring the land rights to construct a dojo right here. You're all my teammates as well as my first disciples, so you'd better not lose me face, you hear?\"\"Yes, Captain!\" the hunters chorused.\"In that case, let's start with the reason for purging your genetic techniques, which I'm sure you're all quite curious about.\" As the hunters nodded, Zhang Lie continued, \"It's very simple: your foundational framework can be advanced past the tenth stage!\"\"What? Doesn't the foundational framework only have ten stages? What's this final stage you're talking about?!\" Flabbergasted, Yang Ze interrupted Zhang Lie before he could continue.\"The first ten stages are common knowledge, yes, but not this final stage. After breaking through the bottleneck at the tenth stage of your foundational framework and reaching what I've termed the final stage, you'll be able to increase your basic gene capacity by ten. It's for these ten basic gene fragments that I'm having all of you purge your genetic techniques and start anew.\"\"Basic gene capacity? You mean... it can exceed a hundred?! But are ten basic gene fragments really all that important? It certainly doesn't seem as though it would provide a large boost to our constitution. Is it really worth purging our techniques for just ten basic gene fragments?\" Fang Yi asked.Zhang Lie responded patiently, \"Of course it's worth it. These are limit fragments, and they provide much more significant a boost than standard gene fragments. Put simply, these ten basic gene fragments would provide even more of a boost than ten standard mutated gene fragments. Do you understand?\"The shock on the gathered hunters' faces was evident.Ten mutated gene fragments did provide a significant increase to a hunter's strength, and this wasn't a gap that could be simply closed.In truth, they weren't particularly advanced with their genetic techniques yet, and purging them and starting anew wouldn't be too much of a sacrifice. However, for the short term, they would be unable to fight at anything close to their original strength.\"Captain, I trust you. What's there to hesitate about? I'm going to purge my techniques right now!\" Having made up her mind, Sun Mengmeng closed her eyes, expelling the engravings on her genetic core. The turbulent genetic energy that was generated as a result caused fresh blood to trickle out of her lips, but she didn't care.The other hunters followed suit.\"We'll have to carry out the breakthrough in the dimensional world. I'll need to give you a few things, and then you'll have to undergo a trial. Whether you can succeed on your first attempt will depend on your perseverance,\" Zhang Lie continued, once they had all finished. Truthfully, he had anticipated some more resistance to his suggestion, and was gratified that they had so much trust in him.Back in the dimensional world, they headed to the training ground that the Yun and Chu clans had set up in the Forest of Blue Maples.When Zhang Lie brought his teammates, who had just stuffed their faces with white-grub cores, to the site, he found Chu Feng and Yun Bing with a hundred-hunter team right outside. This wasn't a coincidence; Zhang Lie had noticed the Yun and Chu hunters gathering within the Blacksteel settlement, and he had timed his movements so that his team would arrive at the training ground exactly as the Yun and Chu parties did.\"May I help you?\"As the two parties met, the members of Team Zenith were quite surprised by how polite Chu Feng and Yun Bing were. After all, they were the two strongest hunters of the Blacksteel settlement!What sort of hunter could merit such respect from them? Just who was their captain? Didn't he live in the slums? Why did it seem as though Yun Bing and Chu Feng were deferring to him?From Chu Feng and Yun Bing's perspective, they had already witnessed the horrifying strength of the hunter in front of them. Even if he weren't strong, the warehouse of white-grub cores that he controlled was reason enough to be polite. As a result, it was only natural that Chu Feng would greet him with a smile on his face, his tone an equal mix of excitement and anxiety, giving the rest of Team Zenith a big shock.\"What else could I be here for? These teammates of mine need to participate in the trial, so I'm here asking for a favor.\"Yun Bing and Chu Feng turned to the hunters of Team Zenith, carefully inspecting them. Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, and Yang Ze responded well to the scrutiny, but the other three hunters couldn't help retreating from the attention.Such behavior disappointed Yun Bing and Chu Feng. After all, given how mysterious and strong Zhang Lie was, they held everything around him to equally high standards, but the hunters behind him were only decent, at best.Chu Feng cocked an eyebrow. \"Your teammates aren't bad! Of course I'll do you a favor. Let them enter with everyone else!\"Zhang Lie nodded, turning to Fang Yi and the others. \"Don't worry and head in with Young Master Chu and the others. But you'd better succeed, or I'm kicking you out of the team!\"The slight disdain in Chu Feng's tone didn't go unnoticed, either by Zhang Lie or by the rest of his team. He gave them an ultimatum in order to pressure them more at this critical moment, hoping to increase their chances of success.In truth, a breakthrough of this nature couldn't be guaranteed at all, and Zhang Lie certainly didn't intend on expelling any hunters from his team, but Chu Feng, Yun Bing, and even his teammates understood his words differently.Chu Feng and Yun Bing frowned as they tried to analyze the implications of what he had said. Had Zhang Lie found a method to guarantee a breakthrough? Was that why he had given them that ultimatum in plain sight?As for his teammates, they felt as though Zhang Lie was insulted by Chu Feng's disdain for them, and whether or not they succeeded would directly impact Zhang Lie's reputation. As such, no matter what trials they would have to face, they had to give it their all so as to not let their captain lose face!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76: Potion #1Team Zenith joined the Chu and Yun parties entering the training ground. Meanwhile, Zhang Lie, Yun Bing, and Chu Feng headed to a pavilion that had been constructed right outside.\"Zhang Lie, it looks as though you're quite confident in your subordinates' strength!\"The moment they sat down, Chu Feng tried to pry some information from him, but Zhang Lie only gave him a placid smile. \"I said what I did solely to stress them and increase the chances of a breakthrough.\"Neither Chu Feng nor Yun Bing believed him. They glanced at each other, both coming to the conclusion that Zhang Lie was trying to hoodwink them again.After a brief pause, Chu Feng spoke up again, sincerely, \"Zhang Lie, if you have some method for a guaranteed breakthrough, please make sure to sell it to us first! After all, we've worked together for quite a while already, and we'll certainly give you a price that will make you happy.\"\"There's no such thing. If it really existed, I would certainly have told you two about it already\u2014who wouldn't want more points? I promise that there wasn't any deeper meaning behind those words.\"Given the firm negation, Chu Feng and Yun Bing certainly couldn't press the matter further, and they had to change the topic.\"We've reported the matter about the white-grub cores to our clans, and we'd like to purchase five thousand cores each. Would you be willing to give a further discount given our bulk purchase?\" Chu Feng tried to negotiate with Zhang Lie.\"No, I won't. 10,000 points per core is already a huge discount, and I assure you, I'll have no shortage of buyers at this price.\" Zhang Lie held a monopoly on the white-grub cores, and he certainly didn't need to give a further discount.\"Ah, well, in that case, I'll thank you for the sale.\" What else could Chu Feng do? It wasn't as though he had any bargaining chips handy. They might have tried to threaten some other hunter, but certainly not Zhang Lie.Both Yun Bing and Chu Feng had strongly recommended to their clans that they maintain a cordial relationship with Zhang Lie and not alienate him. He was simply too threatening as an enemy.At some point, they had begun to think of Zhang Lie as superior to even themselves.Chu Feng didn't want to thank Zhang Lie for his 'generosity'; after all, from his perspective, Zhang Lie seemed to be selling what was supposed to be a low-grade resource for an insane price, but he had no choice but to put aside his pride and thank him just for the opportunity to purchase it!Chu Feng changed the topic again. \"Zhang Lie, you mentioned another breakthrough the last time we talked. Would you be willing to let our clans participate?\"Zhang Lie laughed. \"Given the authority your clans possess, I'm certainly happy to share the information with you, but there's nothing to participate in. Just like before, it'll be another sale.\"\"A sale? What do you mean?\" It was Yun Bing's turn to speak up. From his tone, it seemed as though Zhang Lie had monopolized yet another breakthrough.\"I won't beat around the bush any longer. This second breakthrough is actually a potion that I concocted unintentionally, which I'm calling Potion #1. Consuming it will allow you to increase your basic gene capacity once more!\"The two hunters gaped again.'Unintentionally' concocting a potion that would allow a hunter to exceed their basic gene capacity again? What sort of devil was this hunter, to be able to devise such breakthroughs out of nowhere?And since he was calling it Potion #1, surely that meant that there would be a Potion #2, and then a Potion #3, and then\u2026 Just how much information and knowledge did he possess?! If this potion really were to exist, then that meant that they could have more than even a hundred and ten basic gene fragments...Chu Feng and Yun Bing's worldview seemed to have shattered.They felt as though they were enmeshed in one of Zhang Lie's traps, and weren't sure whether to continue listening to his words or to leave before he could convince them to spend their hard-earned points on something fraudulent.\"Ah, Zhang Lie, how much of a boost will this supposed potion give?\" In the end, Chu Feng couldn't resist the temptation to learn more about this potion.\"It'll increase your basic gene capacity by fifty gene fragments!\"\"Fifty?! You're not joking around, are you?\" Chu Feng cried out in shock, and even Yun Bing seemed quite flustered.Zhang Lie continued to smile. \"Yes, fifty fragments. Is it all that shocking?\"Chu Feng and Yun Bing were speechless, but as scions of two of the most influential clans of the Blacksteel settlement, they quickly recovered.Chu Feng's voice had raised an octave in anticipation. \"Zhang Lie, will you be selling this potion? Will you be selling its recipe, too?\"It was a rather silly question. Zhang Lie had emphasized that he was approaching them with a sale. Would he sell the potion recipe and give away his monopoly on Potion #1? Of course not!Zhang Lie pretended he hadn't asked anything.Yun Bing thumped Chu Feng, beside her, on the back. \"Are you an idiot? What would you do in his position? The recipe would be priceless!\"Chu Feng quickly recovered from his momentary lapse in judgment.Even if Zhang Lie were to sell such a priceless treasure, the entire accumulated wealth of the Chu clan wouldn't be sufficient to purchase it.\"I'm sorry, Zhang Lie, that was a stupid question. Can I ask just how many of these potions you have, and how much you intend on selling them for?\" Chu Feng didn't want to work with Zhang Lie any longer, but his wares were simply too enticing. What a ridiculous boost\u2014an increase of fifty basic gene fragments!And because these were gene fragments beyond the usual capacity, they would be even more impactful than fifty standard mutated gene fragments. Such a boost would generate a gap that couldn't be overcome.Honestly, Chu Feng couldn't believe that such a ridiculous potion actually existed! After imbibing the potion, he would naturally be stronger than any other hunter.Despite his current strength, Chu Feng couldn't take this potion lightly. Indeed, in order to maintain and advance his strength, he would have to purchase this potion at any cost.Yun Bing felt the same way. They had both gotten closer to Zhang Lie subconsciously, and were staring expectantly at him.\"The potion requires quite a few ingredients, and I don't have much supply. All in all, I only have ten potions, and I intend on auctioning them off in the real world. You understand the problem that would pose to a lone hunter like me, don't you?\"An auction? It was clear that Zhang Lie intended to milk this discovery for all it was worth!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: Teamwide SuccessAn auction\u2014especially one on Earth\u2014meant that they would have even more competitors for these rare potions. In fact, if information about such potions were to be distributed widely, even hunters from the higher realms of the dimensional world might show up. As a result, the organizers of the auction would have to be able to handle the pressure from these far stronger hunters.\"Zhang Lie, are you... requesting that our clans organize the auction?\"Given how strong the potion was purported to be, Chu Feng was perfectly willing to sacrifice his pride to get a chance to acquire it.However, Zhang Lie already had other plans in mind. \"Do you think your clans would be able to handle this? They might have some strength in the first realm of the dimensional world, but would they be able to handle hunters from the higher realms?\"Zhang Lie's words jolted Chu Feng out of his reverie. Zhang Lie was right: the Chu clan might be one of the largest clans within the Blacksteel settlement, but that was nothing compared to some of these hunters who might show up for the auction.The elders of the clan might have some influence over matters of the second realm, but what about the third and fourth realms? The Yun and Chu clans could hardly hope to stand against the monstrous geniuses who had made it that far.\"Zhang Lie, you're absolutely right. We likely won't have the qualifications to participate in the auction, so would you be willing to sell us two of the potions beforehand?\" Yun Bing couldn't resist asking Zhang Lie for a favor, given how incredible the potions' effects were.Zhang Lie smiled. \"Well, working with the two of you has been rather pleasant, so I don't mind leaving two potions for you. In that case, I'll sell them to you at the lowest price that they go for during the auction.\"Chu Feng and Yun Bing's eyes widened, and they even began to breathe more heavily.\"Do you mean this? Zhang Lie, I will hold you to your word.\"\"Don't worry. Have I ever lied to you?\"Yun Bing's face was flushed red with excitement, a surprising contrast from her usual cool and collected demeanor. When she looked toward Zhang Lie, her gaze seemed to be filled with an emotion she couldn't place.At this moment, Zhang Lie seemed to be exuding some intangible charm, and her heart began to thump loudly. She couldn't help but think to herself,\u00a0Is he treating me so well because he's interested in me?She was only in her early twenties, but her strength, as well as the pride that derived from that strength, was a significant barrier deterring would-be suitors. No other hunter had managed to move her heart, but Zhang Lie, who had seemed to appear out of nowhere, satisfied essentially all her requirements: he was mysterious, strong, domineering, and yet gave her preferential treatment.Even Yun Bing wasn't immune to flights of fancy, after all.\"Thank you, Zhang Lie. No matter what happens in the future, I will remember your goodwill.\"By her side, Chu Feng, who knew Yun Bing well, was very surprised by the depth of emotion she was displaying.\"It's not a problem. The fact that we're active in the same settlement in the first realm at the same time is a form of fate, and both of you show promise to be strong hunters in the future. Consider this an investment on my part. Furthermore, you should realize that even the lowest selling price for these potions will still be an astounding sum, and you had better start gathering funds now.Zhang Lie's words seemed quite logical, but Yun Bing and Chu Feng were still very touched. No matter what, it was a huge favor for him to be willing to remove two potions from auction and to sell it to them at the lowest selling price. They immediately professed their gratitude.\"Zhang Lie, I apologize for having investigated your background, but it doesn't seem like you have a backer at all. Would you be willing to tell us whom you plan on having host this auction?\"Chu Feng and Yun Bing had naturally investigated Zhang Lie before purchasing white-grub cores from him, but all their investigations suggested that he was nothing more than a poverty-stricken resident of the slums on Earth.He had no family background to speak of, nor a backer, and he even had to take care of his paralyzed sister.Under such conditions, how was it that Zhang Lie had been able to become as strong as he was today? They certainly wouldn't have been able to get that far starting with so little.However, before Zhang Lie could answer them, the gates to the training ground opened, and the participants within began to walk out.\"You'll see!\" Zhang Lie hastily replied before heading to the gates, eager to know how his teammates had performed.Quickly, Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, Yang Ze, Sun Xiaowu, Li Feng, and Zhou Ying gathered in a line before Zhang Lie. They were each relaxed, as though they had all met Zhang Lie's expectations, and Zhang Lie could hardly believe the implication.\"Well? Did you all advance?\"\"Yes, Captain!\" they chorused, shocking the other hunters nearby.If they didn't succeed, they would be expelled from the team! Of course they didn't dare fail. None of them realized just how shocking it was for them all to pass on the first attempt.Chu Feng and Yun Bing, who were observing Zhang Lie's team from a distance, were both rather shocked. Had they really all succeeded? Surely they weren't that lucky. Did Zhang Lie really not have some sort of secret technique?Before their conversation, both Chu Feng and Yun Bing would have suspected that he did, but after the conversation, with their improved understanding of Zhang Lie, they didn't think he would lie.This meant that those hunters they had disdained earlier had likely succeeded in the trial with their own strength. They took note of those hunters who had defied their expectations.Zhang Lie didn't care what Chu Feng and Yun Bing thought; he was overjoyed that the hunters of Team Zenith had all succeeded. He knew full well that there was no secret technique for inducing a breakthrough.There were two reasons for their success: first, the training ground that Chu Feng and Yun Bing had constructed was effective; and second, that Zhang Lie\u2014or rather his teammates\u2014were quite lucky today.There could be no other explanation.\"Very good. In that case, let's proceed to the next stage of the plan!\"Now that they had all broken through, they would have to replenish their supply of basic gene fragments, and then choose new genetic techniques to study.Basic gene fragments would be straightforward for any of the present hunters to acquire, even without genetic techniques. As hunters who possessed superior gene fragments, would they be stymied by hunting down regular-grade lifeforms? Of course not!However, Zhang Lie would have to be more particular with helping them choose their new genetic techniques. After all, as members of his team, they certainly deserved high-quality techniques that fit with their frameworks.Recalling the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion, Zhang Lie decided to return to the settlement and enlist their services. He bade farewell to Yun Bing and Chu Feng, then made to return. However, Yun Bing and Chu Feng indicated that they would be returning to the settlement as well. They were both very pleased with the large number of successes in that day's trials.The three of them still had a transaction to carry out, after all, so Zhang Lie didn't mind them tagging along. After a moment's wait, he returned to the Blacksteel settlement with his team, Chu Feng, and Yun Bing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: A Lucrative DealBack in the settlement, Zhang Lie quickly concluded the transaction with Chu Feng and Yun Bing. They each wanted 5,000 cores, for a total of a hundred million points between the two clans.The members of Team Zenith were astounded by the magnitude of the transaction. A hundred million points was worth a billion dollars! A dollar wasn't worth all that much in this day and age, but Zhang Lie had gotten all that money just for ten thousand cores!And they had seen just how large Zhang Lie's stockpile of these white-grub cores were. To have a few warehouses full of cores that cost a hundred thousand dollars each... just how much wealth did Zhang Lie have?!They thought that Zhang Lie was being generous when he handed some points to their team leaders, Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng, but after learning about the extent of his wealth, they finally understood how he could be so generous.Zhang Lie dismissed them so that they could hunt down the ten basic gene fragments they needed to saturate their new capacity, then entered the Blacksteel Inn alone.His goal was to purchase a sufficient number of genetic techniques for his team. He had spent quite some time pondering the techniques that would be most suited to everyone.First was Fang Yi. His original framework was water-attuned, which meant that he could learn all the techniques that Zhang Lie was currently using: [Three-Wave Crescendo], [Rippling Walk], [Calm Waters], [Fists of the Silent Sea], [The Boundless Blade], and even Zhang Lie's prized [Ninecarp Transformation].There would be no need for any further preparation with regards to his techniques.Sun Mengmeng's situation wasn't very different from Fang Yi's. Her framework was fire-attuned, just like Zhang Lie's in his past life. In that case, he wouldn't have to prepare any of her techniques either. [The Burning Pyres], [Soulfire Blade], [Scorching Fist], [Flameburst Step], [Embersteel Cuirass], and [Baptism of Hellfire] were genetic techniques that Zhang Lie had used and studied all throughout his past life. Except for [Ninecarp Transformation], they weren't inferior to any of his current water-attuned genetic techniques at all.However, Sun Mengmeng favored long-ranged archery techniques, so Zhang Lie decided to buy her something suitable for that purpose as well.The other hunters' techniques would be trickier. Yang Ze's framework was earth-attuned, and Sun Xiaowu's was gold-attuned. Li Feng's framework was earth-attuned, like Yang Ze, whereas Zhou Ying's framework was wood-attuned. To further complicate matters, the four of them each preferred a different fighting style.Given that Zhang Lie was preparing to build a dojo, he would certainly need a repertoire of genetic techniques, even beyond what his teammates needed.In his suite, he immediately accessed the trading post and contacted the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion. His status as a million-class customer meant that he received preferential service for all his requests. Not two minutes after he sent a message, Daffodil, who had already handled two of Zhang Lie's requests, contacted him.\"Mr. Peppercorn, thank you for your patronage at the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion. What may I do for you today?\"\"I need genetic frameworks and techniques, high-grade and above, in all nine primary elements: gold, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, thunder, light, and darkness. Send me a list of all such techniques you have for me to look over.To be honest, I'm currently preparing to construct a dojo, and I'll be needing a large supply of techniques. However, you have to ensure that these techniques were obtained reputably, and I can't have any trouble associated with using them. Do you understand?\"Daffodil was momentarily stumped by the enormity of Zhang Lie's request, but she quickly replied, \"Yes, Mr. Peppercorn, I understand! However, I don't have the required authority to process this on my own. Please give me a moment while I report this to headquarters and ask for assistance!\"\"Go ahead. I'll be here waiting for your response.\"Zhang Lie closed the connection and poured himself a glass of red wine, turning on the holographic television as he waited for a response. Fortunately, given his status, the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion didn't dare to keep him waiting. In just five minutes, he received another call.Two figures appeared on the holographic screen, Daffodil and a middle-aged man.\"Thank you for your patience, Mr. Peppercorn. I'm Fang Yuze, the manager in charge of the branch of the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion in the first realm of the dimensional world, and I'm honored to be serving you today.\"\"I'm sure Miss Daffodil has already explained my circumstances to you, so there's no need for any pleasantries now, please,\" Zhang Lie cut directly to the heart of the matter. \"How many framework and technique manuals do you have?\"Fang Yuze bowed his head respectfully.\"As you wish, sir. We have 165 manuals that meet your requirements. Of these 165, 23 are gold-attuned, 14 wood, 24 water, 17 fire, 22 earth, 19 wind, 13 thunder, 21 light, and 12 darkness. The lowest is high-grade, and the highest is mythic-grade. Please, feel free to take your pick. As a million-class customer, you'll receive a 12% discount on any purchase you make at the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion,\" Fang Yuze explained patiently, going so far as to offer Zhang Lie a bulk discount.After all, customers who made such large purchases were rare, and if he were able to secure a deal now, he would surely gain prestige and reputation within the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion, and be promoted into a managerial position after his advancement into a higher realm.Zhang Lie smiled. \"I intend on purchasing more than fifty manuals, a large purchase even among large purchases. Why don't you give me a 30% discount? If so, we can continue negotiations; if not, I'll find some other trading house to give my business to.\"Despite his smile, it was apparent that he had no intention of giving in.Fang Yuze hesitated, not expecting the 'generous customer' that Daffodil had mentioned to pull a trick like this. He glared at her before turning back to Zhang Lie, schooling his features into a pleasant mask. \"Of course, sir. Given the magnitude of your purchase, I can offer you a 30% discount, but I must insist that you purchase at least fifty manuals for the discount to take effect.\"\"That's not a problem. Fifty manuals is a baseline, and I'm sure to exceed that.\"Fang Yuze heaved a sigh of relief, then gave Zhang Lie a wide smile. \"In that case, sir, let me thank you again for your patronage. I'll leave Daffodil here to work with you in selecting the manuals you'd like to purchase. If there's anything with her service that you're unhappy about, please contact me directly.\"Here is my contact information. I'm currently located in the Maple settlement, and someone will respond to any request from you at all hours. Please let me know if there's anything you need!\"As a manager, Fang Yuze couldn't afford to spend too much time on any single customer, and after leaving his contact information behind, he handed the rest to Daffodil.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: InheritanceThe remainder of the deal was straightforward. Daffodil and Zhang Lie settled on a set pricing for manuals based on their grade:6,000 points for high-grade techniques and frameworks,200,000 points for pinnacle-grade,2,500,000 points for legendary-grade, and finally,30,000,000 points for mythic-grade.With the price settled, Zhang Lie proceeded to sift through the manuals for the ones that he wanted to purchase.Given his personality, he was naturally going to start from the highest-grade manuals. There were only two mythic-grade manuals, both frameworks: [Rondo of Wind and Storm] and [Arclight Dragon's Imprint].[Rondo of Wind and Storm] was an unusual dual-attunement framework.In the short recording that introduced the framework, a female hunter was dancing to the accompaniment of wind and storm, wreathed in gusts of billowing wind, lightning arcing around her body. At times, her genetic energy evoked refreshing gusts of wind; at others, the wrath of lightning.The flexibility of a dual-attunement framework could be a significant boon in a fight. However, choosing such a framework would require an extremely strong foundation of gene fragments, as well as a large number of auxiliary genetic techniques of both elements.It was certainly a framework that would require heavy investment. However, Zhang Lie was still interested, and he immediately motioned for the manual. After all, it was a pinnacle-grade framework, and thirty million points for it was a bargain.Honestly, Zhang Lie was very curious just where the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion was acquiring these mythic-grade frameworks. In the past, the emergence of a mythic-grade framework in the first realm of the dimensional world would always be accompanied by a great hubbub, but this Thousand-Treasure Pavilion had offered two of them up for sale, just like that!Had he simply been too constrained by his lack of wealth in his past life?Regardless, given his current wealth, he'd take as many mythic-grade manuals as the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion had to offer.After watching the recording in full, Zhang Lie motioned that he would purchase [Rondo of Wind and Storm]. Daffodil was elated: Zhang Lie's first purchase was for thirty million points!The payment was quickly processed, and an elaborate, exquisite manual sent over to Zhang Lie's suite. Instead of inspecting it closely, Zhang Lie moved to the other mythic-grade framework, [Arclight Dragon's Imprint]. This was a relatively rare light-attuned framework, and seemed to invoke a full-body technique.In the recording, a middle-aged male hunter circulated his genetic energy, causing dense silver scales to emerge over his skin. The silver scales encased him like a suit of draconian armor. A simple punch from the hunter was sufficient to make the earth tremble and the heavens shake, and it clearly endowed him with frightening strength.However, it was also evident that this framework would require a dense reservoir of light-attuned genetic energy: manifesting enough silver scales to cover a hunter's entire body wasn't a trivial task at all.Despite this shortcoming, it was still a mythic-grade framework, and Zhang Lie bought it without a second thought.Daffodil's face broke into a huge smile.He surveyed the legendary- and pinnacle-grade frameworks and techniques in much the same way, buying all that caught his eye. As he had promised, he would buy no fewer than fifty manuals; in the end, he went away with fifty-four.Of the nine primary elements, he had at least four or five of each type, and he had spent almost a hundred million points.This was Daffodil's first time seeing someone purchase so many and such varied manuals in bulk. Of course, from her perspective, the more he bought, the larger the bonus she would receive, so her smile had been widening the entire afternoon.After Zhang Lie finished inspecting the last manual, Daffodil beamed at him. \"Mr. Peppercorn, all your desired manuals have been sent to you. On behalf of the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion, thank you for your patronage, and I must personally thank you for supporting me as well! If you're ever by Ursa Major, please let me know, and I'd be delighted to show you around. Here's my contact information.\"Before Zhang Lie could say a single thing, she had already sent her contact information over. She was clearly delighted by the humongous purchase Zhang Lie had made.\"I'll take your word for it.\"\"Of course, Mr. Peppercorn! It would be my honor to meet you in person. May the opening of your dojo be a wonderful success! In addition, from today onward, you'll be a ten-million-class customer of the Thousand-Treasure Pavilion\u2014 no, more accurately, you're our first customer to be close to the hundred-million class, and my team will be your dedicated service staff. If you have any requests or problems related to trade and business, my team and I will offer you our utmost support.\"Daffodil was certainly very skilled as a sales representative, and she knew just how to keep a customer like Zhang Lie relaxed and happy.\"I do have a question. I asked something similar last time, but I wasn't too satisfied with your answer. This time, I'd like to hear something less evasive.\"Daffodil could guess what the question would be. \"May I ask if you're inquiring about the origin of these manuals?\"Zhang Lie nodded.\"Most of these manuals were part of the legacies of strong hunters who have perished,\" Daffodil explained.Zhang Lie blinked, his mind suddenly filling with possibilities. He had overlooked critical information that he possessed\u2014the locations of burial mounds for several hunters of legend, where their legacy and inheritance could be obtained! One of them was even right on Earth. How could he have forgotten such valuable information?If Daffodil hadn't brought it up, he wouldn't have considered this avenue of wealth.The dimensional world had been discovered for less than a century, but within this period of time, there were quite a few rising stars of humanity that had emerged. Some of them were still trying to access higher and higher realms, but others had perished unexpectedly.At the dawn of this century, there had been a series of serious conflicts between humankind and a class of insectoid lifeforms known as the Kez.Hunters from that era tended to leave behind a legacy in hopes that there would be hunters to inherit the path of cultivation that they had pioneered and take up their mantles in the war against the Kez. Most such legacies included frameworks, techniques, and all sorts of treasures that they had obtained during their journeys.Zhang Lie's excitement showed on his face. \"Thank you for the information. If I'm ever by Ursa Major, I'll treat you to a meal!\"Daffodil was unaware of the source of Zhang Lie's excitement, but she smiled at the sudden interest that he demonstrated. \"I look forward to it, Mr. Peppercorn. If there's nothing else, I'll have to report the outcome of this sale now.\"\"Farewell!\" Zhang Lie's excitement grew more intense once the connection was closed. He was rapidly assembling a plan to take advantage of his knowledge.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80: A Pleasant ChatZhang Lie stored the manuals he had just recently purchased and left the inn. Uncloaked, he made his way to the settlement gates to wait for Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, and the others.\"Oh, who's this? If it isn't the king of the dumps himself?\"\"What? Where? Hasn't the Qin clan dealt with him yet?\"\"The Qin clan? Hah! Given their current state, what can they even do?\"Zhang Lie was surprised to see that he was still quite a notorious figure in the settlement. He was instantly recognized the moment he appeared, then publicly mocked again.Of course, these hunters were nothing more than annoying flies to him. If he didn't strike at them, they would keep on buzzing; if he did, he'd dirty his hand with a splat of blood. He preferred to just ignore them; after all, while they were all within the settlement, no one would dare resort to violence.\"What about the Qin clan? They were once one of the six major clans in the Blacksteel settlement; even in a weakened state, don't you think they'd be able to take care of a hunter like him?\"\"If you ask me, he's just cursed with bad luck! Look at what happened to the Wang and Qin clans!\"\"Bad luck? The two clans destroyed each other, but this fellow's still hale and hearty over here. How could this be anything but good luck? If I were him, I'd sell all my possessions and bet on a few lottery tickets!\"\"Hey, you can hear us, can't you? Why don't you tell us how you managed to survive a pincer attack from the Qin and Wang clans?\" asked a dark-faced hunter, who was walking up to Zhang Lie.Zhang Lie shrugged. \"As your companion over there mentioned, the two clans were far more concerned with each other than a weakling like me.\"\"A weakling? If you're a weakling, Zhang Lie, then are there any strong hunters within this settlement?! Stop feigning weakness, Zhang Lie. I know all your tricks now!\" A familiar voice came from a cloaked man standing not too far from him.Zhang Lie recognized him almost instantly. \"Indeed, there's no need for me to pretend any longer. As for you, have you resolved your feud with the Zhou clan?\"Zhang Lie's sudden smile made the man take a step back. \"Zhang Lie, just you wait! I'll claim your life once the Void Cup is over!\"\"Oh? Is that so, Qin Xiao? Not to look down on the Qin clan, but you're grossly mistaken if you think you can claim my life!\"Zhang Lie's relationship with the Qin clan had completely soured, and there was no reason for him to hide his distaste now.However, the conversation between Zhang Lie and Qin Xiao shocked the gathered crowd.What sort of situation was this? That cloaked hunter was Qin Xiao? Zhang Lie, the king of the dumps, was facing off against Qin Xiao, third on the gene leaderboard?And he claimed that even the entire Qin clan wouldn't be able to do anything about him? Was this hunter going mad, or had they missed something?\"I knew there was something wrong with you, but no matter what, you're still just a poverty-stricken hunter from the slums! Do you really think you'll be able to get away with offending me, Qin Xiao? With offending the Qin clan?\" Despite his expulsion from the Qin clan, Qin Xiao was still as arrogant as ever.\"And if I say he will, what will you do then, Young Master Qin?\" Just then, a female voice cut across the chatter from the shocked crowd, instantly attracting everyone's attention.The onlookers' eyes bulged: the speaker was Yun Bing, the top-ranked hunter in the Blacksteel settlement! She had just entered the settlement with Chu Feng and a few unknown hunters, but what the onlookers focused on wasn't her retinue, but instead her tone. It was clear that she sided with Zhang Lie.Why was the top-ranked hunter of the Blacksteel settlement protecting this so-called king of the dumps? Was there some secret between them? Were they... intimately related? Surely not.None of the bystanders knew what was going on, but they were certain of one thing: there was more to Zhang Lie than met the eye at first glance.Yun Bing's sudden interruption left Qin Xiao a little bewildered.\"That's right! I, Chu Feng, also think that Zhang Lie will be able to get away with this. What do you think, Young Master Qin?\" Chu Feng agreed with Yun Bing.\"Yun Bing, Chu Feng, you\u2014\"\"Listen up: I consider Zhang Lie a brother of mine, and if you have a score to settle with him, then you have a score to settle with me. You don't need me to remind you just how dire the Qin clan's straits are, do you? Don't do something you'll regret.\"Before Qin Xiao could speak, Chu Feng had already threatened him into silence. After all, Zhang Lie was essentially a benefactor to both Yun Bing and Chu Feng, and he had Potion #1, which they direly needed, in his possession.They certainly didn't want to lose their chance at obtaining such a rare boon. To Chu Feng and Yun Bing, their strength as a hunter was far more important than any wealth or material possession, and they naturally had to stand up to Qin Xiao.Qin Xiao was flabbergasted by their behavior. Were they mad, to call a trashy hunter like that their sworn brother?Worst of all, he didn't even dare to rebuke them! In the past, the Qin clan would have been able to handle either the Yun or Chu clans individually, but now, if they decided to focus their efforts on ruining the Qin clan, they would likely succeed.He was confident in being able to handle Zhang Lie, but he didn't dare touch Yun Bing or Chu Feng at all. He snorted lightly, then scurried away.After Qin Xiao vanished within the crowd, Yun Bing and Chu Feng walked up to Zhang Lie.\"Actually, the two of you didn't have to do this. Someone like Qin Xiao wouldn't be able to do anything to me,\" Zhang Lie said, smiling. His words again sent ripples of shock through the gathered crowd.Chu Feng smirked. \"Perhaps I just pity Qin Xiao. After all, Yun Bing and I know just how devious you are.\"The three of them chatted as they headed into the settlement. Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, and the others followed behind them like obedient children.\"Well, if he tries to seek me out, it'll be to his own detriment.\"Zhang Lie didn't care about Qin Xiao at all. Now that he had grown so significantly in strength, someone like Qin Xiao\u2014or even the entire Qin clan\u2014was no threat to him. If Qin Xiao forced himself upon him, Zhang Lie would retaliate at full strength.They left a gaggle of shocked hunters behind them as they walked away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: A Choice of ManualsWhat sort of situation was this? It was ridiculous enough that Zhang Lie was being protected by both Yun Bing and Chu Feng, but given their conversation, it seemed as though they even believed that Zhang Lie had the strength to overthrow the entire Qin clan.In a matter of hours, the conversation at the gates of the Blacksteel settlement had spread to all the hunters in the vicinity, and Zhang Lie's reputation as the king of the dumps seemed about to be overthrown.Zhang Lie brought the rest of Team Zenith back to the Blacksteel Inn, but instead of renting a suite, he rented time in a specialized training room instead. It was a space specifically designed for hunters to practice and train with genetic techniques.As an underground chamber, it was extremely spacious, with individual training rooms, environmental adaptation chambers, a dedicated research lab, and all sorts of other amenities. Compared to the training room that came with a standard suite, this specialized version was far more comprehensive.With the extent of Zhang Lie's wealth revealed, Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, and the others were gradually growing used to his extravagance.As he brought his teammates inside, Zhang Lie asked, \"Well, have you all reached your new basic gene capacity?\"They nodded.\"Very good. In that case, we'll proceed to the next step of the training: acquiring new genetic techniques. I've prepared a fair selection for all of you, so take a look at the various recordings. After you're done, tell me which techniques you're going to learn, as well as the reason why.\"The construction of his dojo was progressing at a rapid pace in the real world, and he didn't want his repertoire of manuals or his disciples to fall behind.A list of over fifty recordings was displayed in front of the hunters' faces. The dazzling variety of techniques, as well as their average grade, left once again stunned the gathered hunters.\"Captain, a-are you letting us choose from any of these genetic techniques?\" Fang Yi asked, stammering in his astonishment.Soulshards were an addition to a hunter's repertoire, but a framework and its associated techniques were a hunter's foundation. The stronger the foundation, the farther the hunter would be able to go.If they really were able to take their pick among these frameworks and techniques, they wouldn't have to worry about their foundation at all. After all, the lowest-grade manual here was high-grade, and the majority were pinnacle-, legendary-, or even mythic-grade.Such manuals were all quite rare, and yet their captain had brought out over fifty of them like it was a trivial affair!Even Yang Ze, who came from an affluent clan, couldn't help but be amazed at the sight. After all, he had expended almost all his resources within his clan just to obtain a pinnacle-grade framework, but the framework that he had painstakingly acquired wasn't worth a mention compared to the resources arrayed in front of him.At this moment, Yang Ze was incomparably glad that he had chosen to follow Zhang Lie, that he had become Zhang Lie's first disciple, that he hadn't backed down at a critical juncture, and that he had chosen to purge his techniques and start over.He and the other hunters began poring through the recordings, searching for a suitable framework and accompanying techniques.Zhang Lie headed outside to train his [Fists of the Silent Sea]. He was quite surprised at just how long the hunters were taking to choose suitable techniques: even after practicing for an hour, none of them had come up to him with choices in mind.Had he given them an overwhelming number of options? Just as he was about to return to the recording room to see what they were up to, Sun Mengmeng walked toward him.Zhang Lie stopped practicing his technique and turned to her with some curiosity. When he had purchased these manuals, he had some idea as to which hunter would pick which techniques, and he was curious as to how accurate his prediction would be.\"Captain, I'm ready!\" Sun Mengmeng was direct and deliberate.\"Which manuals have you chosen, and why?\"\"For my framework, I've chosen [Black Sun], a legendary-grade fire-attuned framework whose strength lies in the intense dark flames it generates. As auxiliary techniques, I intend on studying [Baptism of Hellfire], a legendary-grade sword-based technique particularly compatible with my chosen framework, as well as the one fire-attuned archery technique available, [Lunarflame Shot]. If I'm not mistaken, Captain, you must have picked this technique specifically for me!\"Zhang Lie nodded. \"You have a very clear sense of your strengths and the role you want to play in combat. These three manuals are all excellent fits for you, but as a long-ranged attacker, you have to be able to deal with your opponents' gap closers.\"Not only must you possess some amount of close-ranged combat ability, you must also have a dexterity-focused footwork technique, as well as explosive speed. Fire-attuned footwork techniques are relatively rare, and I also don't have a large selection on hand. For now, you had better learn [Flameburst Step] as well\u2014it might only be a high-grade technique, but it's simple and effective, giving you a quick burst of speed when you most need it.\"\"Yes, Captain!\" Sun Mengmeng immediately nodded.Zhang Lie handed her four manuals.\"Here are the techniques. Start studying them immediately. If you have any questions regarding your framework or auxiliary techniques, feel free to ask me for help,\" Zhang Lie instructed.Sun Mengmeng glanced at the four manuals in her hand, still somewhat disbelieving of this new reality. After all, three of the four manuals were legendary-grade\u2014how could she not be excited? Without Zhang Lie's assistance, she certainly wouldn't have been able to obtain a legendary-grade framework or technique at this stage, so her excitement was only normal.Only after a while did she come to her senses, stumbling in her rush toward one of the training rooms.After Sun Mengmeng made her decision, the others quickly followed suit. Zhang Lie's next interruption was from two hunters, not just one. Yang Ze and Li Feng approached him together, which surprised Zhang Lie quite a bit.Yang Ze belonged to an affluent clan and was from a privileged background, whereas Li Feng came from the slums, just like him. How had they gotten so close? He supposed it was just a fluke of human nature: after the two teams had merged into one, Yang Ze and Li Feng had become closer together than any other pair of hunters.He smiled at them. \"Are you both ready?\"They nodded.\"In that case, which manuals have you picked out? Yang Ze, you go first. I'm curious about the perspective of someone from an established clan.\"Zhang Lie was interested in knowing which techniques he would pick, given that his framework was originally water-attuned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82: UnexpectedYang Ze pursed his lips, then began seriously, \"As my framework, I've chosen [Ripples of Shattered Glass], because it's most compatible with me, and it's also legendary-grade. For my sword technique, [The Boundless Blade]; for my fist technique, [Fists of the Silent Sea]. I was deeply impressed by your recording of both techniques, and I plan on learning them both. As for a footwork technique, I'm interested in the pinnacle-grade [Mirrored Refraction]. What do you think?\"\"Not bad, not bad at all,\" Zhang Lie praised. \"Your selections were essentially as I predicted. In that case, you can get started right away. Take these manuals and head into one of the unoccupied training rooms.\"Zhang Lie handed over the four manuals, causing Yang Ze to still for a moment as he felt their heft in his hands. He glanced up at Zhang Lie, nodded firmly, and headed toward a training room.After Yang Ze was Li Feng. \"Alright, what do you have for me?\"Because he had predicted the manuals Yang Ze had chosen, he was quite confident that he could do the same with Li Feng, but Li Feng's response was completely beyond his expectations.\"Captain, I would like to learn [Arclight Dragon's Imprint]!\"Li Feng's words stunned Zhang Lie. After all, his framework was previously earth-attuned, and although he still wasn't very advanced with it, he had at least gotten a grounding in earth-attuned techniques.Was he intending to take an entirely different path? Zhang Lie smiled at his audacity.\"Explain your decision. Your previous framework was earth-attuned, wasn't it?\"\"Yes, Captain, but not by choice.\" Li Feng grew visibly deflated as he responded.He didn't have a choice. Coming from the slums, it took him a whole year of scraping by in the dimensional world to obtain that one high-grade framework, [Earthen Pulse]. Now, however, he wasn't restricted by a paucity of choices, and it was only natural that he would want to pick out the best technique he could.If Zhang Lie had acquired a mythic-grade earth-attuned framework, he would undoubtedly have chosen that, but of the available earth-attuned manuals, the highest was only legendary-grade.This prompted Li Feng to look outside his comfort zone and to choose a framework with a different elemental attunement. His background made him well aware that this could be the most important opportunity of his entire life. The framework he chose now would affect his future, and would represent a turning point in his career as a hunter.As such, he would naturally aim for the very best!\"Your body's already familiarized itself with earth-attune techniques,\" Zhang Lie warned. \"If you study an earth-attuned framework now, you'll be able to advance much more rapidly than if you chose a different elemental attunement. After all, you don't have any experience with light-attuned techniques.\"If you want to cultivate the [Arclight Dragon's Imprint], you'll need to overcome your body's natural aversion to a different elemental attunement, and this could well affect your speed of advancement. For at least a few months, it'll be akin to putting in double the effort for half the gain. Even so, will you take on [Arclight Dragon's Imprint]?\"Zhang Lie didn't forbid Li Feng from making such a decision, but he was very frank about the challenges that Li Feng would have to overcome for success.He left the choice to Li Feng himself. Upon hearing Zhang Lie's words, hesitation flashed through his eyes, but it vanished in the next instant. Taking a deep breath, he repeated, \"Captain, I would like to cultivate [Arclight Dragon's Imprint].\"\"Are you certain?\"\"Yes, Captain!\" Li Feng replied instantaneously.\"Good, I can sense your conviction! In that case, you'll learn [Arclight Dragon's Imprint]. What auxiliary techniques have you chosen?\"Li Feng couldn't help but be surprised by Zhang Lie's cool acceptance of his decision.He was prepared to receive a harsh lecture from him, and even to be rejected, but his captain seemed to be fully supportive of his decision. He had agreed, just like that!Li Feng felt as if he were dreaming, to have been granted access to a mythic-grade framework so easily. He pinched himself on the leg until he was gasping in pain. No, it wasn't a dream! After a moment of stunned silence, he began to laugh.Zhang Lie couldn't help but smile at Li Feng's antics. Li Feng was overthinking things; Zhang Lie was naturally gratified to see his teammates' willingness to improve themselves, to grow stronger. They were his disciples, but they were also hunters in their own right, and Zhang Lie was glad to see them chart out their futures for themselves.\"I intend on taking [Dragon's Triumph] and [Light's Bulwark] as my sword and fist techniques respectively, and [Daybreak] as my footwork technique.\"All the manuals he had chosen were pinnacle-grade and higher, with [Daybreak] and [Dragon's Triumph] both being legendary-grade. A mythic-grade framework, along with two legendary-grade and a pinnacle-grade technique\u2026 it looked as though he would be spending quite a fair amount of time training from now on.Zhang Lie raised an eyebrow, but he didn't object. As he handed him the four manuals, he said, \"Don't disappoint me, Li Feng.\"His hands trembling, Li Feng took the four manuals that Zhang Lie proffered. \"Of course. I'll make you proud, Captain!\"No one knew just how much Zhang Lie's gift meant to him. From then on, Zhang Lie would be a figure he viewed on equal footing as his birth parents. Without him, Li Feng would never have been able to touch a mythic-grade manual his entire life, let alone study one. But now, he had a mythic-grade, two legendary-grade, and one pinnacle-grade manual in his hands.Li Feng felt as though what he was holding weren't just the manuals, but also his fate.He had to achieve success, and he had to make his captain proud. This was all Li Feng could think about. Bowing deeply in gratitude, he ran off to a training room with the manuals in hand.After Li Feng left, Fang Yi, Sun Xiaowu, and Zhou Ying all finished making their selections and walked up to Zhang Lie together.\"Are you all ready?\"\"Yes, Captain!\"\"Good. Step forward!\" Zhang Lie began with Fang Yi. \"Explain what techniques you've chosen, Fang Yi.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83: EmergenceFang Yi hesitated for a moment. \"For my framework, I'd like to choose [Rondo of Wind and Storm]!\"\"What?!\" You want to cultivate [Rondo of Wind and Storm]?\"Zhang Lie was surprised that Li Feng would choose [Arclight Dragon's Imprint], but even that paled in comparison to Fang Yi's choice of framework. After all, in his past life, Fang Yi had achieved great success with his water-attuned framework.Was the temptation of a mythic-grade framework so large that he would give up all the progress he had made, so large that even Fang Yi, who had been a famous hunter in the past, was tempted?\"Is that unacceptable?\" Fang Yi asked, sensing Zhang Lie's unusual response.\"No, but you have to explain your reasoning. After all, your old framework was water-attuned, and you made more progress with it than anyone else on the team with theirs. Why do you suddenly want to switch to [Rondo of Wind and Storm]? You don't seem like a hunter who only cares about their framework's rarity,\" Zhang Lie explained his concerns.Fang Yi was rather touched by Zhang Lie's attention and desire to help him. He had a reason for choosing [Rondo of Wind and Storm], and it wasn't because it was a mythic-grade framework.\"Will you trust me, Captain?\"However, he didn't reveal that reason.\"Of course. If not, you wouldn't be here! There's some secret you're keeping to yourself, isn't there?\"Zhang Lie smirked when he saw Fang Yi fidget. Everyone had a secret or two of their own, and he was just testing Fang Yi to see what he would reveal.Subject to Zhang Lie's scrutiny, Fang Yi quickly promised, \"Don't worry, Captain, no matter how many secrets I have, I swear it won't endanger you or our team. However, I'm still a little shocked by what's going on myself, so is it fine if I report back after a few days?\"\"Honestly, I'm surprised by just how far off some of my predictions have been, but if you're interested in this framework, then feel free to study it. \u00a0What about your other techniques? Which ones have you chosen?\"Fang Yi didn't expect Zhang Lie would agree so easily, but he quickly replied, \"[Heaven's Judgment], a spear technique; [Wind's Spirit], a fist technique; and [Floating Clouds], a footwork technique.\"Zhang Lie was, once again, surprised by Fang Yi's choices.[Heaven's Judgment] was a legendary-grade lightning-attuned spear technique, and would be an attack of unparalleled might when developed to its fullest.[Wind's Spirit] was a legendary-grade wind-attuned fist technique, with attacks of dizzying speed and variety,[Floating Clouds] was a legendary-grade wind-attuned footwork technique, a rare technique that boasted both extreme speed and difficulty.The three manuals were difficult enough to master on an individual basis, but when combined, and with a mythic-grade framework to boot\u2026 it seemed as though Fang Yi really was set on becoming strong, no matter how hard he would have to work.\"I imagine you understand the difficulty of these techniques, but if you're picking them anyway, you must have a reason as to why. In that case, take these manuals and head to a training room.\" Zhang Lie intended to leave Fang Yi to his own devices but to keep a close eye on his progress.Only Sun Xiaowu and Zhou Ying were left. Neither deviated from Zhang Lie's expectations, and continued studying techniques corresponding to their original elemental attunement.Sun Xiaowu's framework would be the legendary-grade [Adamantine Aegis], with auxiliary pinnacle-grade sword technique [Golden Divide], the legendary-grade fist technique [Goldenscale Palm], and footwork technique [Blinding Flash].Zhou Ying had chosen the legendary-grade framework [Avatar of the Fae], with spear technique [Storm of Leaves] and fist technique [Willow's Caress].Sun Xiaowu's choices were within reason, but Zhang Lie was a little excited to see that Zhou Ying, just like Li Feng, had chosen a framework that focused on strengthening one's own body.After giving them both a few pointers, he handed them their respective manuals and had them head into one of the training rooms as well. The entirety of Team Zenith had gone into seclusion.They spent a whole month of the dimensional world in those rooms, and Zhang Lie was the first to leave: his newly learned [Mirrored Refraction] had just reached intermediate-stage, and he had also advanced considerably with [Fists of the Silent Sea] and [The Boundless Blade]. He had worked particularly diligently on [Fists of the Silent Sea], and had reached a significant level of accomplishment with it.Of course, an important part of training was using those techniques in battle against opponents.Zhang Lie informed the rest of the team that he was going to head out and fight against a few superior-grade lifeforms; after all, he was still somewhat far from reaching the superior gene capacity.The Void Cup was imminent, and he would easily be able to dominate against his competitors once he capped his superior gene fragments.Upon seeing Zhang Lie emerge from the Blacksteel Inn, many hunters shot him looks of respect and fear. After all, ever since he defended himself against Qin Xiao at the settlement gates, and after being heralded by Chu Feng and Yun Bing, rumors of Zhang Lie had spread far and wide throughout the entire settlement, most even more outlandish than what Zhang Lie himself could have come up with, but these rumors all shared one similarity: for one reason or another, Zhang Lie had managed to get himself noticed by Yun Bing and Chu Feng, and he was now an Important Figure.A word or errant comment from him could easily ostracize any of them from the rest of the Blacksteel settlement, so most ordinary hunters would naturally fear him.Of course, there were also some who would be envious or jealous of the circumstances that had led to his sudden rise in status. Those who were smart about it would bury it deep in their hearts, but those who weren't were easily taken advantage of by others: for instance, the hunter who was #43 on the gene leaderboard, Wu Kedi.Wu Kedi was from the Wu clan in the city of Liao. He was tall, handsome, and prideful, and everything in life had gone smoothly for him\u2014until he encountered who he considered to be the love of his life, Yun Bing.He was so charmed by her that he swore he would acquire her at any costs, and he tried all manner of tactics to get close to her and to woo her. Unfortunately for him, Yun Bing didn't care for his advances, and hadn't even looked him in the eye once.Wu Kedi originally thought that her disdain was because of his lack of strength, so he had been furiously training and hunting in order to advance on the gene leaderboard. Within a short period of time, he had advanced from position #111 to #43.Within three months, he planned to reach the coveted top position on the gene leaderboard, crushing Yun Bing's pride and forcing her to look him in the eye, to become besotted with him.Unfortunately for him, his vivid imagination wouldn't become a reality. He had only gotten to #43 when a devious hunter told him that Yun Bing had found a boyfriend, and this boyfriend was someone who had been ridiculed by the entire settlement for quite a few months, a dastardly, weak, useless, and ugly fellow.How could someone like Wu Kedi bear such humiliation? He swore that he would kill this boyfriend of hers, no matter whether what he had heard were rumors or the truth.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84: The Impending Void CupAfter disappearing into the Blacksteel Inn, Zhang Lie hadn't been seen for an entire month.However, just then, one of Wu Kedi's subordinates informed him that Zhang Lie had left the inn. Wu Kedi had no intention of letting him go. With a few trusted subordinates, he headed right outside the settlement gates, where he would lie in wait for Zhang Lie.As for Zhang Lie, he didn't fear anything or anyone in the settlement after having consumed Potion #2 and reached his improved mutated gene capacity.There was no reason to hide his identity any longer, so he had been going around uncloaked in the settlement. He had wondered whether or not there would be any hunters trying to target him, but he didn't expect it to be someone unfamiliar.At the very least, Zhang Lie was quite certain he hadn't seen this particular hunter before. He had no recollection of ever interacting with him.\"Zhang Lie, your death is nigh!\" Wu Kedi shouted, his voice full of confidence, as though he grasped his opponent's life wholly in his hands.Zhang Lie responded in a surprisingly friendly manner. \"I have no idea who you are. Leave now, and I'll spare your life.\"\"You think you can handle me, you gigolo?! How could Yun Bing have been attracted to someone as weak as you? Go, castrate him!\" He motioned to his lackeys, giving them a cruel order.In the blink of an eye, his five subordinates dashed toward Zhang Lie, surrounding him from five different directions. They would first subdue him, using no weapons beyond their hands and legs, and then castrate him once he was completely secured.Unfortunately for them, Zhang Lie's white-grub armor was more than sufficient to bear the brunt of their attacks. By the time the attackers realized that their attacks were having no effect, it was already too late.Zhang Lie moved so quickly that all they saw was a blur. They felt a pain in their abdomen, and only then noticed that they had been knocked up into the air.Wu Kedi's lackeys had intended on subduing Zhang Lie with a numerical advantage, but they were far too weak for such an attempt to succeed. Even all five of them working together would be hard-pressed to block a single blow from Zhang Lie.After all, they didn't realize just how strong Zhang Lie had grown.A burst of genetic energy from Zhang Lie was all it took to knock them all onto the ground, and whether or not they would be able to keep their lives would be up to him.\"You damned useless pieces of trash! Can't you do anything on your own?!\" \u00a0 Wu Kedi yelled. He materialized a pair of sharp claws, then stared furiously at Zhang Lie.\"Look, don't waste your time trying to attack me. If you apologize now, I might consider letting you walk away, but otherwise\u2014\"Before Zhang Lie could finish talking, Wu Kedi was already rushing toward him. After all, from his perspective, Zhang Lie was just a weakling that wouldn't be able to stand up to him. Zhang Lie's aura might have fooled others, but certainly not someone as discerning as Wu Kedi himself!Envy and jealousy had destroyed any semblance of logic in Wu Kedi's mind.\"[Talon Strike]!\" Following Wu Kedi's howl, a violent gust of wind-attuned genetic energy took on the shape of a giant eagle and rushed toward Zhang Lie.Nearby hunters, who had gathered because of the commotion, could feel the wind scouring their faces.\"Is this the strength of a top fifty hunter? It truly is remarkable!\"\"If only I could have such strength!\"Despite the recent rumors circulating about the Blacksteel settlement, none of the onlookers looked favorably on him. After all, Zhang Lie was none other than the king of the dumps. Although his reputation seemed to be improving recently, he was thought to be a lackey of the Yun and Chu clans.After all, who would believe that Zhang Lie could have grown so strong in just a few months?Zhang Lie ignored the assault of wind rushing in his direction.\"Do you really have nothing better to do? I'm just trying to hunt.\"He raised an arm and casually triggered [Fists of the Silent Sea]. With his current strength, he could defeat someone like Wu Kedi without even pulling out his sword.On the other hand, Wu Kedi thought that Zhang Lie was a fool for trying to counter his attack head-on. As the king of the dumps, how could he imagine that he would be able to defend against a direct attack from him? Did Zhang Lie think he was all that just because he had defeated some of Wu Kedi's subordinates?\"Zhang Lie, prepare to die!\" Wu Kedi clawed at Zhang Lie's armor, but he wasn't even able to pierce his first layer of protection.At the same time, Zhang Lie's fist, seemingly without any force behind it, struck Wu Kedi's chest.The two of them struck each other with their attacks, then continued moving forward in opposite directions. Zhang Lie walked forward, not sparing his opponent a single glance.\"You think you can turn your back on me? Come ba\u2014\"Wu Kedi was in the middle of turning around when he suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood and flesh, then crumpled senselessly onto the ground. Amidst shocked cries from the onlookers, Wu Kedi closed his eyes for the last time.\"What happened?! Did Zhang Lie make a move?\"\"I don't know! I didn't see anything! Could Zhang Lie be so strong that he's able to launch an intangible attack?\"Zhang Lie couldn't care less about the onlookers' comments. The Void Cup was less than a month away, and he would have to spend the remaining time dedicated to hunting superior-grade lifeforms, so as to ensure that he and his team would be well prepared for the Cup.Given the past Zhang Lie's experience with the dimensional world, along with the notes that Fang Yi and the others had collated, it wouldn't be too difficult to find and hunt down these superior-grade lifeforms.He intended on hunting down as many of the superior-grade lifeforms on the booklet as he could within this time.As he was preparing for his hunt, the rest of Team Zenith was still furiously training away in their underground training rooms. Zhang Lie's trust in them motivated them to work as hard as they could. They couldn't let down their captain, they simply couldn't!The month passed in the blink of an eye.Those hunters who intended on participating in the Void Cup made their way back to the Blacksteel Settlement, waiting for the Cup to officially begin. Quite a few of them tried to relieve the stress of their preparations in the pubs in the area, such as the one owned by the Yun clan.Amidst the crowds of people and almost tangible boom of music, a cloaked hunter sat by a corner of the pub, savoring the newest available brew. After having slaughtered superior-grade lifeforms for almost an entire month, Zhang Lie also needed to relax a little.However, before he could finish his flask of wine, Yun Bing appeared in front of him.\"You were gone for a whole month! And even when you finally show up here, you refrain from informing me. Do you disdain me, Zhang Lie?\" Yun Bing's somewhat coy tone almost made Zhang Lie spit out the mouthful of wine he had just consumed.\"Ah, ahem! I'm just here to sample the pub's newest offerings after having been gone for so long. I didn't plan on staying very long, so\u2014farewell!\"Sensing an unusual mood, Zhang Lie immediately put down his cup of wine and made to leave. He had yet to deal with his relationships from his past life, and before he did so, he didn't want to attract any undue attention.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: Exceeds ExpectationsAs Zhang Lie left the bar, the will of the world announced in his mind, [The Void Cup begins in a week. You may register starting today.]Everyone in the dimensional world had received this announcement.\"It's about to begin!\"\"I'm going to win this Void Cup!\"\"It's time to head back to the settlement and prepare!\"Hunters from each and every settlement were excited upon hearing the news, regardless of whether or not they intended to participate: it only happened once every few years, after all, and was essentially the equivalent of a major sporting event. Those hunters who were participating were naturally eager to get started, and those who were spectating wanted to place their bets.The corporations of each settlement began setting up bets the moment they heard the news. Although the Void Cup was sponsored by the world government, these bets were all hosted by private corporations, and the government didn't have the means to police or prevent them.Although there were nominally only five great clans left in the Blacksteel settlement, and the Zhou corporation had incurred significant losses after the night at the venombane glade, none of this seemed to have affected the betting at all.What the bets would entail would be determined by the information that the three corporations managed to acquire.Of course, none of this had much to do with Zhang Lie, who was rushing back to the Blacksteel Inn. Since the message had gone out to every hunter in the dimensional world, Fang Yi and the others would likely be heading out of seclusion right about now. They would surely have achieved some success with their new techniques.However, by the time Zhang Lie returned to the underground training chamber, which he had gotten very familiar with after a month, he saw no one around.What's going on? Are they still training?\u00a0Just as Zhang Lie was preparing to enter their individual training rooms to hunt them down, he sensed a fire arrow being launched nearby.The attack was extremely rapid, but the moment it was launched, Zhang Lie could sense the fire-attuned genetic energy in the air. After all, having used a fire-attuned framework for years, how could he be unfamiliar with the sensation of fire-attuned genetic energy?The arrow that Sun Mengmeng thought would surely hit him was neatly sliced in half with a flash of violet light.\"Captain, it looks like you've grown even stronger!\"\"You're not bad yourself,\" Zhang Lie replied.As she spoke, Sun Mengmeng dashed forward with [Flameburst Step]. A dark red sword struck toward Zhang Lie, but before the blow could land, Zhang Lie vanished like a bubble being popped.\"Captain, don't you think I know how to deal with your stealth by now?\"She gracefully converted her attack into a defense, sketching out a circular arc with her longsword and blocking herself off from Zhang Lie's counterattacks. At the same time, she surrounded the floor around her with dark red flames.\"Not bad, but this doesn't mean much to me.\"\"What?!\" As Sun Mengmeng recoiled in shock, Venombane struck past the flames, the sheathed blade inches from her neck.The longsword in her hands clattered against the ground, and the dark red flames surrounding her vanished with Zhang Lie's appearance.\"Not bad, but you need to keep working hard.\"\"Yes, Captain!\" Sun Mengmeng headed to one side of the chamber to rest, whereas Zhang Lie stared warily around him. Although his teammates didn't have too many limit fragments and had just purged their techniques, they were quite adept at laying traps.If he weren't careful and fell into one of their traps, he'd certainly lose face as a leader. These hunters were clearly trying to test out the results of their training on him, exactly what Zhang Lie wanted. This was the best way for him to see just how much they had grown during this period of time.He was very curious about the fruits of their high-intensity training. Of course, he was most curious about Fang Yi and Li Feng's progress, because they were starting from scratch.However, the next hunter that approached him wasn't either of them, but instead Zhou Ying.\"Captain, the four of them are waiting for you in the large training chamber. They claim that the common area is too small for the attack they want to launch, so...\"Zhang Lie smirked. They seemed to be quite confident in their own abilities.\"And you?\"Zhou Ying pursed her lips. \"Well, if you insist.\"A mutated-grade soulshard appeared in her hands. Zhou Ying favored an indirect style of attack. The moment Zhang Lie took a step forward, he became trapped in the illusion of a bamboo forest. She was a relatively shy girl, and this was reflected in her style as a hunter: she wasn't one to charge at someone head-on.Zhang Lie glanced all around him, clearly impressed by her efforts.\"Captain, it's not a good habit to take your eyes off your opponents!\" Zhou Ying warned, then thumped the flat end of her spear against the ground.Beams of green light shot toward Zhang Lie from all angles.Zhang Lie had spent the entire month hunting down superior-grade lifeforms, and while his abilities still weren't as strong as they had been at the peak of his past life, an attack of this magnitude wouldn't be able to touch him at all.Contorting his body, he narrowly avoided a few of the green beams, then darted away.However, just as he left the bamboo forest, countless bamboo leaves flew toward him, each one as sharp as a knife. Amidst the storm of leaves, Zhang Lie waved his left arm, genetic energy rippling from it like a shield, protecting him from the barrage.As the ripples struck the bamboo leaves, they rebounded into the air, but precisely at that moment, a green needle shot toward Zhang Lie, camouflaged by the bamboo leaves that obstructed his vision.Zhang Lie blocked it with just one finger and forcefully stripped it of its illusion: the needle was the spear that Zhou Ying had been using.\"With just one finger! Captain, you're\u2014\"\"Excellent performance, Zhou Ying. Your fighting style is very mature, and you've surpassed my expectations!\"Zhou Ying was quite disappointed that Zhang Lie had blocked her attack so easily, but before she could convey her disappointment, it vanished after hearing Zhang Lie's praise.\"Do you mean that, Captain? You're not just trying to console me, are you?\"She was naturally overjoyed to receive such high praise from him, but she wasn't confident enough in her abilities to take his word for it immediately.\"Of course! When have I ever lied to you?\"\"Thank you for your affirmation, Captain! I'll make sure to keep working hard, and I won't let you down!\"Zhou Ying was quite touched by Zhang Lie's praise.Zhang Lie eagerly anticipated what he would face next. Zhou Ying's performance had been surprising enough, so what about the four hunters waiting for him in the large training room?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: Results of the TrainingHowever, before he entered the training room, there was one important task he had for Sun Mengmeng and Zhou Ying. He had quite a number of superior-grade carcasses in his potbellied-toad pouch, obtained from his month of hunting.While the hunters hadn't participated in the hunt and thus wouldn't be able to obtain any superior gene fragments from those carcasses, it would still provide them with nourishment. During this month of seclusion, all they had eaten were meals from the inn, so this would be a sumptuous feast in comparison.\"Will you prepare some of these superior-grade carcasses while I take on Fang Yi and the others?\"He left the carcasses on the table as he entered the training room, while Zhou Ying and Sun Mengmeng nodded and prepared to cook.Fang Yi, Yang Ze, Li Feng, and Sun Xiaowu were all standing straight and facing the door, as if waiting for his arrival.\"Oh? It looks like you're all quite prepared.\"The prospect of a challenge enthused Zhang Lie.\"Of course, Captain! We've been in seclusion for over a month!\"\"Well, what are you waiting for? Show me what you've accomplished with all that time!\"\"Charge!\" Fang Yi yelled, dashing toward Zhang Lie with his spear in hand. Surprisingly, none of the other three hunters seemed about to make a move.Hurled forward by wind and storm, the spear seemed nigh unstoppable. As it struck, it left a dozen afterimages in its wake, surrounding Zhang Lie's body.\"Not bad, not bad!\" As Zhang Lie nodded, he countered the fearsome attack with Venombane.The clash of metal filled the room. Fang Yi waved his spear with lethal speed and precision, but Zhang Lie seemed to be able to block all his attacks with careless sweeps of his arm.As Fang Yi attacked, Zhang Lie's body was buffeted by billowing winds and a gathering storm.\"[Tiger's Howl, Dragon's Bellow]!\" Fang Yi's spear took on the aspect of a dragon of the winds and a storm tiger as he charged forward.\"A fine attack, but too easily disrupted!\" Zhang Lie shifted aside with [Mirrored Refraction], evading the attack.Zhang Lie deflected the spear with the edge of his blade, then stepped forward into close range while Fang Yi's guard was down. He directed one palm casually toward Fang Yi.Fang Yi's innate reflexes and awareness had made him a strong hunter in Zhang Lie's past life, and the present Fang Yi had retained those same qualities. At this critical juncture, he made the optimal decision: stepping out of range and avoiding Zhang Lie's attack.He was certain that he would lose in a contest of brute strength. Other hunters might be unaware of just how fearsome their captain was, but the members of Team Zenith certainly did. Even before he embarked on a month of hunting, Zhang Lie had had over fifty superior gene fragments, and he could well be at the superior gene capacity now.Fang Yi's deflected attack made him unwilling to strike directly at Zhang Lie, but Zhang Lie naturally understood what he was trying to do. In this sort of situation, Fang Yi would have no choice but to strike from the back.He shifted his body, clenched his palm into a fist, turned around, and attacked. Zhang Lie's punches landed squarely on Fang Yi's body. As if he had been struck by lightning, Fang Yi stumbled back.\"Stop, stop, I can't handle it anymore! Captain, you're crazy! You overwhelm me in every aspect, so how am I supposed to fight against you?\"\"What? I've just warmed up! Are you really going to give up so easily?\"\"No, Captain, stop! I admit defeat! Don't just look at me\u2014how about the three of them? They haven't shown you the fruits of their labor yet!\"Fang Yi darted behind Yang Ze and the others.Zhang Lie shrugged. \"It's not as though I'd really harm you. You've made good progress with [Rondo of Wind and Storm], but your attack's too direct. Your interpretation of [Tiger's Howl, Dragon's Bellow] isn't as flexible as it could be, and you need to be able to deal with situations like the deflection I used on you.\"After giving Fang Yi a few pointers, Zhang Lie turned to the other three hunters. In truth, he was quite pleased with Fang Yi's progress, especially considering the difficulty of the path he had chosen.He was even more curious as to what Li Feng, who was also starting from scratch, had managed to accomplish. However, his next opponent wasn't Li Feng, but instead Yang Ze, who had inherited several of his water-attuned techniques.\"Captain, have a taste of my [The Boundless Blade]!\" Yang Ze's body vanished as though it was a mirage. Under the effects of [Mirrored Refraction], he seemed to phase in and out of existence.\"I'm right here, Captain!\"He launched [Fists of the Silent Sea] in Zhang Lie's direction.Zhang Lie had to admit that Yang Ze had a very interesting interpretation of [Mirrored Refraction]. It was the same footwork technique he had learned, but whereas Zhang Lie's version of the technique was ethereal, Yang Ze's was phantasmagorical. He would likely be able to surprise a less experienced hunter, but certainly not someone like Zhang Lie.The moment Yang Ze struck with [Fists of the Silent Sea], Zhang Lie retaliated with the same technique.The two fists met head-on. An explosion of water filled the training room. Yang Ze was thrown back by the force of the attack, but he was unharmed save for a throbbing arm. It was obvious that Zhang Lie had gone easy on him, because he still wanted to see what other tricks Yang Ze had up his sleeve.The saturated water vapor in the air led to extremely favorable conditions for Yang Ze, whose version of [Mirrored Refraction] was well-suited to illusion and disguise. Of course, since Zhang Lie's framework was also water-attuned, he too had an advantage under such circumstances.Zhang Lie gathered his genetic energy. With another application of [Fists of the Silent Sea], the mist in the air surged into three giant waves, spreading out all around him and blocking off any means of attack from Yang Ze.Yang Ze had intended on using the mist surrounding the battlefield as a means of shrouding himself, but he hadn't expected Zhang Lie would take advantage of the water-saturated environment to launch an enhanced attack instead.\"Well, Captain, you haven't left me any other choice. Have a taste of my blade!\"\"Bring it on!\"The two of them retreated to opposite sides of the room, each with a sword in their hand. Whereas Zhang Lie's Venombane was a shortsword, Yang Ze's soulshard armament was a greatsword.Water-attuned genetic energy gathered around the two combatants. Although their swords were different, their auras were the same. The spectators suddenly found it hard to breathe, as though they were submerged in a boundless ocean.Behind their backs, Zhang Lie and Yang Ze's genetic cores took form.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: Goldenscale PalmA black serpent uncoiled from behind Zhang Lie's back. As it raised its head, waves of dark energy flooded the room. The serpent hissed and black ripples spread out from its body, corroding everything they touched.Behind Yang Ze emerged a giant shark, opening its maw wide so everyone could see its rows upon rows of sharp teeth.\"Captain, here I come!\" Yang Ze swung down with his greatsword, and the giant shark flicked its tail and launched itself toward Zhang Lie.Zhang Lie didn't seem very concerned. He raised an arm and held Venombane horizontally in front of his chest. The serpent behind him coiled around his body.As the giant shark struck the serpent, its body dissolved into water-attuned genetic energy. [The Boundless Blade] was a mythic-grade technique, and it was impressive enough that Yang Ze had managed such a blow, even if Zhang Lie's defense was more than capable of nullifying it.Thus ended the fight.\"Your [Mirrored Refraction] and [The Boundless Blade] are uniquely yours, and I'm impressed by how much individualism you've put into both techniques. That you were able to do so much in so little time is an impressive feat,\" Zhang Lie praised.\"Ah, I'm still too weak! Captain, if you came at me seriously, I probably wouldn't be able to defend against a single blow of yours.\"Zhang Lie stepped forward and patted his shoulder. \"Not yet, but we'll see about the future, won't we?\"Yang Ze beamed as he walked toward Fang Yi.\"I've already tested both of them, so which of you is up next?\"\"Li Feng's our last hope, so let me go first!\"Sun Xiaowu dashed forward. Whereas Fang Yi had focused on speed and strength, and Yang Ze on charging up for a single, devastating blow, Sun Xiaowu had honed his sharpness.The two hunters that Zhang Lie had faced had both made massive gains within the last month, and Zhang Lie was very pleased with their efforts. From the aura emanating from Sun Xiaowu, he seemed to have made equally significant progress.As for Sun Xiaowu, he certainly didn't dare take it easy against an opponent like Zhang Lie. Despite their month of effort, their captain hadn't slacked off, either. He raised a hand, his polearm gleaming with resplendent light.\"Captain, face my [Golden Divide]!\" The beam shot straight toward Zhang Lie.\"Not bad, not bad! You've made excellent progress with that technique.\" Zhang Lie stepped to one side, easily avoiding the blow. Sun Xiaowu's strength had increased by far more than he had expected, surely a result of an endless amount of hard work.\"What else do you have? Come at me!\" Zhang Lie triggered [Mirrored Refraction] and appeared silently behind Sun Xiaowu. \"Take this: [Fists of the Silent Sea]!\"\"I'm ready, Captain! [Adamantine Aegis]!\" A layer of golden runes covered his skin, absorbing Zhang Lie's [Fists of the Silent Sea] for a single moment before dissolving immediately afterward.\"[Blinding Flash]!\" The next moment, Sun Xiaowu's body divided into a dozen illusions.Zhang Lie smiled as he took a few steps back. Against an opponent of equal strength, this would have been a devastating skill. It would be extremely difficult to distinguish the real body from the fakes, allowing Sun Xiaowu to sneak up and attack his opponent.The advanced form of this technique would be able to generate hundreds of such illusions, almost guaranteeing a direct hit for Sun Xiaowu.\"You're still not too adept at controlling and manufacturing these illusions of yours yet, and it's too easy to identify your actual body.\" Zhang Lie easily found the true Sun Xiaowu.Feeling a premonition of danger, Sun Xiaowu hurriedly retreated.Zhang Lie was just about to step forward when he sensed a fluctuation of genetic energy coming from behind.Hmm? Interesting.\u00a0If he weren't mistaken, Sun Xiaowu was behind him, and what he had thought to be the real Sun Xiaowu was nothing more than a meticulous fake.Indeed, this was the truth.\"Captain, I'm behind you!\" Sun Xiaowu called out in delight, thinking that his deception had succeeded.Very soon, however, he was unable to smile. Having deduced that Sun Xiaowu was behind him, Zhang Lie turned around and blasted him back with a humongous wave of genetic energy.\"Captain, can't you give me a chance?! I trained hard for a whole month, but the difference in our strength is only growing!\"What Sun Xiaowu thought to be the perfect decoy was nevertheless seen through, and his attack was so easily dispelled with a [Three-Wave Crescendo]! Sun Xiaowu wasn't wrong: Zhang Lie's strength had grown by leaps and bounds in the last month. However, he had also been stronger than the six of them from the beginning.Sun Xiaowu and the others had gotten a month of intensive training, but they still needed to practice their techniques on live opponents. Fighting with others was the fastest and most impactful means of improvement, and Sun Xiaowu and the others would need opponents of similar caliber.\"You've already done very well. There's no need to rush things\u2014be patient and you'll surely see more and more improvement,\" Zhang Lie consoled him.[Blinding Flash] had significant potential for confusing his opponents, as long as he was able to use it well. It could prove crucial for escaping or for giving an opponent a lethal blow.Unfortunately, there weren't many chances to use the technique in this fashion, and Zhang Lie would have to give him a few pointers before they departed for the Void Cup.He wasn't done with Sun Xiaowu just yet, however. \"How about your legendary-grade [Goldenscale Palm]? Show me that!\"Sun Xiaowu's eyes brightened. \"Take this, Captain!\"His right arm glowed with resplendent light. It suddenly bulked up, and a layer of dense golden scales emerged over his skin. An aura of intense strength emanated from his body. Sun Xiaowu took a step forward, then punched with all his might, generating a dominating wave of genetic energy.\"Very good!\" Zhang Lie praised again. Except for him, no hunter present would be able to take this blow without suffering some degree of injury. To have trained a legendary-grade technique to this extent in such a short period of time, Sun Xiaowu must have given it his all.He allowed the punch to get within a palm's length of his body to sense its strength before countering with a blow of his own. \"Let's end it here!\"Sun Xiaowu felt a tremor in his right arm as the genetic energy from his technique receded, then stumbled back from the force of Zhang Lie's punch. It took him ten steps before he could regain his footing.\"Captain, you're far too strong!\" Sun Xiaowu gasped.\"Your [Goldenscale Palm]'s a very domineering technique, and hardly anyone at the same level will be able to suffer the attack unharmed,\" Zhang Lie evaluated. He was very pleased with Sun Xiaowu's progress.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: Exploration in the NightThe final combatant was Li Feng. He was essentially starting from scratch, having switched his elemental attunement to study [Arclight Dragon's Imprint].Zhang Lie hadn't expected much from him, but given the fact that the other three hunters had let him go last, Zhang Lie thought that there might be a surprise or two in store for him.Zhang Lie looked toward Li Feng, and Li Feng looked back at Zhang Lie.\"Captain, it's my turn!\"\"Alright, let me see your [Arclight Dragon's Imprint]!\"As Li Feng thrust his sword toward Zhang Lie, a silver dragon surged toward Zhang Lie. It was far stronger an attack than Zhang Lie had anticipated. Allowing Li Feng to study [Arclight Dragon's Imprint] was the correct decision, and his hard work didn't disappoint Zhang Lie.Zhang Lie became a little more serious. With ripples underneath his feet, Zhang Lie darted toward Li Feng's back.\"[Daybreak]!\" The moment Zhang Lie made his move, so did Li Feng. As a light-attuned hunter, Li Feng naturally had an advantage in speed, and was fast enough that he could even surpass Zhang Lie.Of course, this was predicated on Zhang Lie artificially restricting his abilities. After all, given how many more superior gene fragments Zhang Lie had, it was almost impossible for any of them to win against him without doing so.With a dull thump, the image of the silver dragon dissolved, and Li Feng stumbled back.\"Not bad\u2014you're as fast as expected for a light-attuned hunter. Again!\"\"[Light Dragon's Remnants]!\" Li Feng wasn't deflated despite his attack failing. Instead, he marshalled his genetic energy into the form of a few white dragons, which he shot toward Zhang Lie.\"Is that your variant on [Light's Bulwark]? Not bad!\" Zhang Lie praised, preparing to deflect the attack with [Fists of the Silent Sea].The white dragons crashed against the ripples that surrounded Zhang Lie's fist, unable to penetrate his defenses.The seemingly weak ripples were somehow as strong and sturdy as a steel wall, and no matter how concerted the dragons' attack, Li Feng was unable to make Zhang Lie budge at all. Instead, as Li Feng summoned more and more dragons, he rapidly drained his reservoir of genetic energy.No longer held back by the white dragons, the ripples from Zhang Lie's fist knocked Li Feng further back.\"Captain, your usage of [Fists of the Silent Sea] is simply too ridiculous!\" Li Feng muttered, as he tried to gather more genetic energy.\"You've only had a month to work with [Light's Bulwark], so even this is already quite impressive. Shall we stop now?\"\"No, wait, I still have my finishing blow!\"\"Oh? Let's see it, then!\"\"Yes, Captain!\" As Li Feng yelled out, his body began glowing with white light, forming a suit of dragon armor around him. Li Feng's vitality and energy reached its peak.\"Captain, take this! [Arclight Descension]!\"Li Feng waved his left arm, around which a torrent of light-attuned genetic energy was gathering. It took the form of a gigantic dragon's claw, bearing down on Zhang Lie like a beam of light.\"Not bad!\" Zhang Lie smiled. His palm clenched into a fist, which he struck at the beam of light descending from above.With an explosion of black mist, a black serpent swallowed the claw whole, instantly dispelling the attack. Li Feng clutched his palm in pain, sucking in air as he dealt with the backlash from the blow.\"Sorry, are you alright?\"\"Yes, I'm fine, Captain, it just hurts a little!\"Zhang Lie had held back at the very end, or Li Feng would have suffered far more grievous injuries. \"Good! Alright, everyone, gather around!\"Zhang Lie had important news to share.\"First, I want to congratulate all of you on a job well done. In this last month and a half, you've all taken great strides forward, and you've exceeded my expectations!\"The hunters let out relieved smiles. Zhang Lie's praise validated their long hours of hard work, and his approval meant the world to them.\"Right, after we have dinner, pack up. We're heading back to the real world overnight!\"However, before they could express their joy and relief, Zhang Lie's next command shocked them all. Return to the real world? Why?Wouldn't it make more sense for them to hunt down as many superior-grade lifeforms as they could before the Void Cup started? After all, they were still far from their own gene capacities.\"Why, Captain?\" Li Feng asked. \"Won't we be wasting valuable time if we head back now?\"The gathered hunters all looked toward Zhang Lie, but he only smiled. \"Don't worry, it won't take long.\" This sort of response was even more mystifying, but none of them pressed the issue.They teleported to the city of Liao, by the Tailin mountain range.Glancing all around at the forest all around them, Fang Yi couldn't help but ask, \"Captain, what exactly are we doing here?\"They had wandered around for half the night, seemingly searching for something. There had just been a drizzle, and the air was damp and wet. A thin film of water covered their clothes.Just as Fang Yi asked his question, Zhang Lie finally stopped moving. \"I've found it. It's right here!\"Everyone gathered around Zhang Lie, but all they saw was an ancient wooden stump.A wooden stump? What was so special about it?Li Feng glanced closely at the stump. After inspecting it carefully and not finding anything amiss, he cocked his head at Zhang Lie. \"Captain, is there anything unusual about this stump?\"No one knew what was going on.Zhang Lie smiled mysteriously, motioning for everyone to step back. \"Oh, you'll see!\"He slammed his foot down on the stump. With a sharp whistling noise that hurt their ears, Zhang Lie seemed to turn blurry\u2014no, it wasn't Zhang Lie who was turning blurry, but rather the space all around him.As their vision blurred further, the hunters felt as though they were glancing into a kaleidoscope.\"Ha, as expected!\" Despite their surprise, Zhang Lie remained a beacon of calm. \"Don't panic. Wait for my command!\"He had memorized the method of breaking through this particular array. He took three steps to the left, four right, nine back, then five forward. Stopping for a moment, he then took seven steps forward, six left, three back, and one right. Finally, he punched at what seemed to be empty air before him.With a crack, Zhang Lie's [Fists of the Silent Sea] seemed to break something in the kaleidoscopic space, which shattered like a mirror.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: Piercing BeamAfter the kaleidoscopic space vanished, a weathered runic teleportation array appeared before the hunters' eyes.\"Captain, is this... a teleportation array?\" Yang Ze, who was the most worldly among the members of Team Zenith, asked what the other hunters were thinking.\"Yes, it is!\"\"Where does it lead?\" Sun Mengmeng asked.\"To a great hunter's inheritance,\" Zhang Lie elaborated. He walked toward the heart of the array.The other hunters were still in shock.\u00a0A hunter's inheritance?The only one who understood what it signified was Yang Ze alone. How had Zhang Lie known that he would be able to access it from this location? It was something every hunter from an established clan dreamt to find, but which few ever did!\"Don't just stand there, get over here!\" Before Yang Ze could ponder matters further, Zhang Lie urged them forward, and the hunters stepped into the heart of the array with questions peppering their heads.Once everyone was in position, Zhang Lie released a burst of genetic energy, activating the array. The hunters' vision turned dark. By the time they could see again, they had entered a completely mysterious space.Before them lay an ancient castle.\"Captain, this...\"\"A castle... just whose inheritance is this?!\"The hunters were stupefied. Mottled copper gates, golden-red glazed roof tiles, stone lamps shining with light\u2014the architecture hearkened back to ancient China. How much wealth would this have taken to maintain\u2014and in an extradimensional space, too?\"Well? Isn't it grand?\" Zhang Lie stepped up to the mottled copper gates in front of the palace.\"It's ridiculous! Captain, just who are you, and how did you learn about this place?\" The hunters chatted among themselves, trying to uncover the mysteries behind this place and how Zhang Lie had found it.\"No, no, the most important question is: whose inheritance is this? Captain, won't you tell us? You've whetted our appetites enough!\" Yang Ze asked amidst the hubbub.Zhang Lie nodded sagely. \"I didn't intend on hiding it from you. This castle was once the property of the Eclipse Sage, and once we open these gates and pass the trials of the castle, everything here will become ours!\"The Eclipse Sage!A martial sage?! Such a designation was only given to those hunters who had reached the apex of the third realm, having acquired all the gene fragments accessible to them.Such hunters had to have spent hundreds of years in the dimensional world alone.\u00a0[1]\u00a0In that case, there would surely be quite a few rare treasures hidden within. How had Zhang Lie managed to find a place like this?The members of Team Zenith stared at Zhang Lie as though they were looking at a deity.Only Sun Mengmeng seemed to react upon hearing about the castle's original owner. \"The Eclipse Sage? Captain, isn't that the hunter who possessed the eclipse domain...\"\"Oh, not bad! Mengmeng, you've read about him?\" Zhang Lie affirmed Sun Mengmeng's conjecture.\"It's really him?!\" Who is it?! Tell us, Sun Mengmeng!\"Despite Zhang Lie's confirmation, Sun Mengmeng still found it hard to believe the truth. Beside them, Fang Yi pressed her to get her to reveal what she knew.Sun Mengmeng glanced at Zhang Lie's approving face, then began to speak. \"The Eclipse Sage was known to be the strongest fire-attuned hunter in the third realm of the dimensional world.\"His signature technique, [Eclipse], was a mythic-grade technique with no elemental attunement that he devised himself. He stood at the top of all leaderboards in the third realm for more than thirty years, and was widely considered the strongest among all the hunters there. As far as I'm aware, he last appeared about thirty years ago, and I can't believe that we've found his inheritance!\"Sun Mengmeng's explanation left them all dumbstruck. The top hunter for over thirty years?!\"Captain, let's enter immediately!\" Fang Yi couldn't wait to see just what sort of treasures lay in wait for him.What self-respecting hunter wouldn't get agitated upon learning of this fact? This was the inheritance left behind by a sage, a sage!\"We will enter, but before that, all of you have to promise to listen to my every command. Do you understand?\"\"Yes, Captain!\"Zhang Lie motioned for all of them to step back as he placed both palms on the mottled copper gates. He sucked in a deep breath, then began circulating genetic energy throughout his body, swiftly generating a cloud of black mist around him.Within the mist, a black serpent circled Zhang Lie, so vivid it almost seemed to be alive. Zhang Lie seemed like a miniature black hole, sucking up all the energy around him.Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, and the others, just from standing by his side, started to find it hard to breathe, and the genetic energy in their bodies began to dissipate. Just as they stepped further back, the gates that Zhang Lie was trying to push open at his full strength creaked, and a slit of light shone through.However, that was as far as Zhang Lie seemed to be able to get. His face was flushed red with exertion, and the veins were clearly visible on his palms. Despite all his efforts, the copper gates refused to budge any further.The rest of Team Zenith was about to help him when Zhang Lie shouted, \"Don't come over, there's no point!\"At the same time, he activated the superior-grade blood ant soulshard in his soulspace.\"Open!\" Zhang Lie shouted, his body seeming to bulk up. With all his genetic energy, with all his strength, the gates finally began to creak open, revealing the interior of the palace.As they did so, a white light shot out of the tallest peak of the castle. Such was the intensity of the light that the dark skies seemed to whirl around it. The beam of light pierced the skies\u2014as well as the extradimensional space itself.Back on Earth, a dazzling beam of light shone out of the Tailin mountain range, with such brightness that it turned night to day within dozens of kilometers of the beam.Such an unusual phenomenon was easily noticed by nearby residents, and news of the event quickly spread throughout the city of Liao, then all of China, then the rest of the world, and even the solar system. After all, if such a phenomenon wasn't manmade, then it surely heralded the discovery of a ruin.Scouts from each of the major clans were immediately dispatched to the scene.1. Remember the ten-to-one time dilation, so a century in the dimensional world translates to a decade in the real world.\u00a0\u261cFavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: AppetizerThe Chu clan convened an urgent meeting. Chu Feng, along with the other high-ranking members of the Chu clan, were all in attendance. They were glancing at a recording of the white beam that had pierced the heavens, discussing what had happened with each other as they did so, and surreptitiously casting glances toward the doorway, as if waiting for something.Two Chu scouts quickly entered the room.All conversations paused as the hunters of the Chu clan turned to the scouts. Chu Feng shouted, \"Quick, tell us what's going on!\"\"Young Master, given the reaction of the clans in Liao, we believe that a hunter's inheritance has been uncovered!\"\"A hunter from Liao? Do you know who it could be?\"The two scouts shook their heads. \"We don't, Young Master!\"\"How have the clans in Liao responded?\" Chu Feng pressed.\"They immediately sent out scouting parties toward the light, and they're likely at the scene by now!\"\"Is that so? It looks like there must be something to this particular ruin, then,\" Chu Feng murmured to himself. \"Both of you, stand back and await further orders.\"\"Yes, Captain!\" The two scouts bowed, then left the meeting room.\"Father, what do you think?\" Chu Feng turned to Chu Lin, who was seated beside him.\"There were quite a few strong hunters that came from Liao\u2014Eclipse, Devil's Eye, Graylight\u2014all of whom have been confirmed to have perished. The Eclipse Sage's namesake technique was even recorded in the Xumi Tome. If the ruin belongs to any of the three of them, the clans of Liao would surely be going crazy about it now.\"The largest clans in China and the clans of Liao will surely rush to the scene. How could we, the Chu clan, miss such an important event?\"Chu Lin's conclusion mirrored Chu Feng's own.Of course, the Chu clan wasn't the only clan intending to rush to the scene. A very similar conversation had taken place in the capital, in the Yun clan's conference room. After all, Liao wasn't too far from the capital, and they could get there quickly via a short-ranged teleportation apparatus. The rest of the clans in the capital would follow the Yun clan's lead.The instigators of this hubbub, Zhang Lie and the members of Team Zenith, were unaware of just what they had stirred up. In fact, they were preparing to undergo the first trial of the castle of the Eclipse Sage.Behind the copper gates of the castle was a long corridor, with two rows of robotic terracotta soldiers arrayed by either side.\"Captain, these soldiers aren't our first trial, are they?\" Yang Ze couldn't help asking. After all, no matter how imposing they seemed, it was clear that the technology seemed outdated and inferior.Zhang Lie smirked. \"You don't think highly of these old antiques, do you? In that case, why don't you try fighting one?\"Yang Ze frowned, turning to the robotic soldiers. \"I shall! I don't believe these rusty pieces of metal can best me!\"Yang Ze stepped into the corridor.\"Warning! An intruder has been detected. Begin expulsion procedure!\"\"Warning! An intruder has been detected. Begin...\"The eyes of the two closest soldiers to Yang Ze began to glint with red light. Their swords blazed with red flame as they rushed toward Yang Ze.Of course, Yang Ze couldn't back down now, not after he had claimed he would make it past these robots. A mutated-grade longsword appeared in his hands, blocking the robots' attack.However, the robots' surprising strength nevertheless forced him to stumble back all the way outside the corridor.The hunters gaped. From their perspective, Yang Ze had been expelled from the corridor almost right after he had stepped inside.\"Why are these robots so strong?\" Fang Yi asked doubtfully.Zhang Lie laughed. \"They might look like antiques from the outside, but their interior programming and skeleton were likely enhanced by the Eclipse Sage himself.\"While Yang Ze had been a little overconfident, he was still able to assess the robots' strength after the short clash. However, his pride couldn't suffer the fact that he had lost in a single blow. With a wave of his sword, he prepared to dash into the corridor again.\"Wait! Yang Ze, with your current strength, it'll be quite difficult to break through their formation. Trying to beat the trial by rushing through it will likely lead to injury, so just you stand back and watch!\"Zhang Lie pulled Yang Ze back, then materialized Venombane in his hand. He shot into the corridor like a bolt of purple lightning.\"Warning! An intruder has been detected. Begin expulsion procedure!\"\"Warning! An intruder has been detected. Begin expulsion procedure!\"\"Warning! An intruder...\"\"Warning...\"Zhang Lie moved so rapidly that, by the time the first robot reacted, he had already reached the middle of the corridor. Dozens of robots' weapons burst into flames as they rushed toward the intruder.Some ran toward him, others glided, and a select few even started to fly. They formed a huge web of steel all around him, blocking off his movement from all directions.Zhang Lie only smiled. The reason he had dashed forward so rapidly was so he could hit them all with a multi-target technique. After all, he too wanted the mythic-grade [Eclipse] for himself.\"[The Boundless Blade: Downpour]!\"Genetic energy exploded from Zhang Lie's body, and drops of purple rain began to fall all around him. A huge explosion rocked the corridor.Dozens of burning robots crashed onto the floor the moment they tried to close in on Zhang Lie. The downed robots all had one similarity: a small purplish-black hole in their forehead.Zhang Lie's huge reservoir of genetic energy, incredible sword technique, and the lifeless robots scattered all over the corridor spoke to the gap between Zhang Lie and the other members of Team Zenith.\"Zhou Ying, if I'm not mistaken, you have some expertise in robotics, don't you? I'll leave you in charge of the scene: the cores of these robots are likely quite valuable!\" Zhang Lie instructed.\"Yes, Captain!\"The hunters of Team Zenith got to work. The flames on the robots' weapons had been doused, and their terracotta exterior sloughed off to reveal a silver, metallic skeleton.With Zhou Ying's guidance, the other hunters learned how to extract the robots' cores from their chest, and quickly finished scouring the battlefield for spoils. These robots were nothing but an appetizer for what was to follow.After passing through the corridor, they reached a small plaza. At its center was a statue of a man with a greatsword on his shoulder, glancing coldly in a certain direction.The man was likely none other than the Eclipse Sage himself.Beneath the statue and all around the plaza, untrimmed grass grew rampant, in counterpoint to the marble perfection of the statue.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: Mobilization\"Captain, is this the Eclipse Sage?\" Fang Yi asked.\"Who else could it be, if it's displayed so prominently in the castle? Of course it has to be him!\" Sun Mengmeng declared.The others nodded, and Zhang Lie inclined his head in agreement.If he remembered correctly, this plaza was a safe area, and the real danger would emerge at the sage's training ground. Of course, this danger really only applied to his teammates.No matter how strong the Eclipse Sage had been, he was now dead. His trials were intended to establish a successor, so they wouldn't be too difficult or life-threatening. Zhang Lie, whose superior gene fragments were at capacity, should easily be able to handle them. Perhaps the last trial would be somewhat difficult and arduous, but he was quite certain there would be no danger to his life.Indeed, what was more dangerous to Team Zenith would be the encroaching parties from the clans around the region. After all, none of them knew that the castle they had just entered had become the target of all the clans close to Liao.Liao, located in the northeast region of China, was bordered by the sea on three fronts, with beautiful mountains and streams. As one of the three most impressive cities of the region, over a hundred clans of all shapes and sizes gathered around Liao. Only four, however, could be considered major players: the Qin, Zhao, Wang, and Liu clans.The beam of light was closest to the Qin clan, and Qin Feng was the first to reach the scene.Unfortunately for him, his speed didn't give him any advantage, because the kaleidoscopic array possessed a self-restoration ability that allowed it to resume activation not long after Zhang Lie and his team entered the extradimensional space.As a result, despite being the first to arrive, Qin Feng wasn't even able to identify where exactly the portal was.\"Young Master, I've found something!\" Qin Feng and his guards immediately approached the shouting scout. They saw an ancient stump by their feet, one that seemed perfectly ordinary.However, upon closer inspection, the oddities surrounding it were quite evident. There were a few gears hidden around the vicinity, as well as a large footprint on the stump itself.Qin Feng praised, \"Well done, Shunzi! This must be the mechanism to unlock the portal to the ruins. Step aside, let me\u2014\"\"Ah, it looks like I've come at an opportune time!\"Just as Qin Feng was about to examine the apparatus in more detail, a dozen beams of light emerged nearby, and a voice could be heard from the distance.\"And just who do you think you are? Liu Ke, do you think I'll let you steal our clan's ruins?!\"Qin Feng hesitated for a moment, but when he saw just who was talking, he relaxed.Liu Ke was the young master of the Liu clan, as well as an elite. The Liu clan was quite a bit weaker than the Qin clan, explaining Qin Feng's attitude. However, Liu Ke, who normally didn't dare rebuke Qin Feng, actually strode up to him and met his gaze.\"Young Master Qin, you don't think your Qin clan can claim these ruins as its own, do you? Chasing me off now isn't a smart move at all! You do realize that other clans could see that beam of light piercing the heavens?\"Liu Ke's attitude greatly displeased Qin Feng. He narrowed his eyes. \"Oh, is that so? What do you propose?\"\"We need to cooperate, of course! Only if we work together can we split a fraction of the rewards.\"\"A fraction?\" Qin Feng glanced at Liu Ke as though he were an idiot.\"I mean what I said. Given how much commotion these ruins generated all around the world, even if all four of the major Liao clans worked together, we would only be able to get a fraction of the rewards, and even that will require significant cooperation on our parts,\" Liu Ke explained firmly.\"Are you crazy? Who's stopping me from heading in and taking everything for myself? This is the real world, not the dimensional world\u2014 who's going to try to start a clan war? The federal government's rules and regulations are there for a reason! Now, scram! If you keep talking, I'll take you out first!\"Qin Feng was growing more and more irate.\"You're right that there won't be a clan war here on Earth, but don't you realize how close we are to the capital? If the clans from the capital want us to capitulate to them, do you think they'd need to start a war? There are quite a few ways to get around governmental regulation\u2014say, for example, hunting us down in the dimensional world instead.\"Qin Feng stilled. Liu Ke wasn't wrong: it would cause quite a commotion if other clans tried to kill them in the real world, but what about in the dimensional world? If they were targeted by the major clans, unless they had strong protection in every realm, they would easily be wiped off the map.Just as Qin Feng was thinking matters through, two more clans arrived at the scene: Zhao Kai and Wang Lun, from the Zhao and Wang clans respectively, had arrived with their own elites.Zhao Kai seemed to have heard part of the conversation, and the moment he appeared in sight, he added, \"Qin Feng, there's no need to think further about it! If we work together, we all benefit; if we fight among ourselves, we all lose out!\"\"That's right. Only with all four of our clans working together can we hope to stand against the other clans!\" Wang Lun agreed. Clearly, he had thought matters through during the way here.With the other three clans in agreement, Qin Feng had no choice but to agree. If he didn't, the other three clans would spurn him, and he wouldn't be able to obtain anything from the ruins at all.\"Fine, fine! In that case, we'll form an alliance. How do you propose splitting up the rewards?\" The moment he agreed, Qin Xiao brought up this question, hoping to gain a little advantage, but he clearly still wasn't thinking straight.\"Qin Feng, given this sort of situation, do you really think that we're qualified to discuss the allocation of spoils? Unless you can activate the portal immediately and leave with everything inside, the four of us will just have to be grateful with whatever the other clans decide to hand us.\"I've just received news from the capital: the Chu clan's Chu Feng and Chu Xun are mobilizing, led by Chu Zhennan, an elder a generation above us, himself! Do you think our four clans can stand up to a formation like that?\"The Zhao clan was the strongest of the four major clans in Liao, and he was far more direct than Liu Ke could hope to be.Qin Feng gaped. Chu Feng, Chu Xun, and Chu Zhennan himself?! Was the Chu clan intending on monopolizing the rewards from the ruins for himself?!These names splashed on Qin Feng's face like cold water. No, his clan certainly wouldn't be able to afford arousing the ire of these hunters! It looked as though he had no choice but to cooperate with the other Liao clans and hope that the Chu clan was generous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: The Clans of the CapitalJust as Zhao Kai finished speaking, Wang Lun added, \"It's not just the Chu clan! The Yun clan's sending a similar delegation. Yun Bing and Yun Meng, along with Yun Chongzheng, arrived at the Liao teleportation array just five minutes ago, and they'll likely be here within five more minutes! And not only that, the Zhou, He, and Qian clans seem to be sending parties as well!\"Qin Feng sighed. \"All five of the major clans from the capital? Is there a need for such a big fuss?\"\"Qin Feng, don't you know who the owner of these ruins is?\"\"What? Who is it? \u00a0Surely it isn't the Eclipse Sage's?\"Zhao Kai looked toward him with disdain, but Qin Feng's annoyance was overcome by his curiosity.\u00a0Just whose ruins could these be?\"Likely not the Eclipse Sage's, but perhaps Devil's Eye or Graylight!\" Just as Zhao Kai was thinking about how to play a prank on Qin Feng, Wang Lun spoke up.Yes, the Devil's Eye or Graylight Sage!\u00a0That was what his own father had supposed. When Qin Feng heard about this, his eyes gleamed. Recalling his father's words, he pressed his wristwatch lightly a few times without attracting any attention.The four clans had gathered and had found the entrance to the ruins, but none of them dared to try to activate it. After all, the five major clans from the capital were rushing over, and they didn't dare to head in knowing that.The other clans arrived within a few minutes.The Yun and Chu clans came together, assembling their forces as they chatted away. Both generations of the two clans knew each other fairly well, and it was only natural that they would congregate.The four clans of Liao didn't dare approach them without a summons.Chu Xun sniffed thoughtfully, as though she sensed something unusual.Chu Feng immediately noticed. \"Chu Xun, what's the matter? Do you smell something?\"Chu Xun giggled. \"Brother, that fellow's been here!\"\"That fellow?\" Chu Feng was a little confused. \"Who?\"\"Blackie!\"Chu Feng gaped. \"You mean, Zhang\u2014\" His face turned funny.Yun Bing sensed the unusual commotion and immediately approached them. \"What's the situation? Chu Xun, did you discover something?\"Her eyes twinkling, Chu Xun said, \"Yun Bing, he's been here, I can smell him!\"\"Him?!\"\"Who? You mean, Zhang...\"Just like Chu Feng and Chu Xun, none of the three of them said his full name out loud, but Yun Meng could easily deduce just who they were talking about.\"In that case, do you think he was the one who caused all this commotion?\" Yun Bing was quite shocked.\"I don't want to believe it, but given the situation, what else could it be?\"\"Who are you talking about? Who's this Zhang fellow, some friend you made in the dimensional world?\" Chu Zhennan, standing beside Chu Feng, couldn't help interrupting their conversation.It was then that the four of them realized that their elders were also there with them.\"No, no, it's nothing! Chu Xun's just guessing, and we're not certain yet,\" Chu Feng exclaimed, trying to change the topic.Yun Bing jumped in, \"Right, why don't we head over to the portal? Uncle Zheng, Uncle Nan, both of you have significant experience in the dimensional world, so would you have a look at the portal?\"They walked over to the ancient stump. The two elders began to inspect it carefully, while Yun Bing, Chu Feng, and their siblings walked over to the Liao clans.The elites of the Liao clan immediately greeted them.\"Young Master Chu, Miss Yun!\"Chu Feng and Yun Bing inclined their heads in response. Beside them, Chu Xun placed her hands on her hips and commanded, \"Alright, answer my questions! If I'm satisfied with your answers, you'll get a larger share of the rewards! First: which of you was the first to arrive?\"Chu Xun was widely known as a devilish girl, and none of the elites dared to cross her. They immediately pointed toward Qin Feng.Chu Xun smiled, but the more she smiled, the paler Qin Feng became. He clearly remembered embarrassing himself in front of her at that bar in the Blacksteel settlement, and now...\"Don't be afraid. Just answer all my questions truthfully, and I'll leave you alone! Of course, if you lie...\"\"Please, ask me anything, Young Miss Chu! I, Qin Feng, swear to reveal all I know!\" Qin Feng didn't dare go against someone like Chu Xun.\"Good. Did you find traces of anyone when you arrived at the scene?\"\"No, Miss! By the time we got here, the beam of light had already dissipated, and it took us a long while just to find this stump.\"Qin Feng's response disappointed the Chu and Yun hunters, and Chu Xun questioned him again, \"That can't be. Are you certain? If I find out you're lying, you'll be in for it!\"\"I'm certain, Miss! If you don't believe me, you can ask my subordinates. None of us saw anyone else by the time we arrived!\" Qin Feng repeated, and his subordinates hastily nodded.It was unlikely that they were lying, so could it be that Zhang Lie had been in the vicinity in the past? No, that couldn't be\u2014his scent was very fresh, and he had to have been here this very night!But if no one had seen him, then there was only one possibility: he was already inside!FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: Underground Treasury\"Alright, I understand. You guys can leave now!\" Chu Xun dismissed them with a wave of her hand.Yun Bing, Chu Feng, and the others had more or less guessed what was happening as well.The four clans of Liao were once again ignored and left to their own affairs, but they were happy with this turn of events, because Chu Feng had commanded them to guard the perimeter and to report in if they noticed something amiss.In other words, he had assigned them a responsibility, so they would surely receive a share of the rewards from the ruins.The four clans each headed in a cardinal direction away from the portal.Meanwhile, Yun Bing, Chu Feng, Chu Xun, and Yun Meng crowded around their uncles.\"Uncle Nan, have you figured out how difficult it is to activate the portal?\" Chu Feng asked.It was likely that Zhang Lie had already entered the ruins, so they were getting increasingly anxious. After all, they were fully aware of just how terrifying Zhang Lie was. His knowledge of the foundational breakthrough, as well as his Potion #1, was more than sufficient to shock the world.And now, they had found traces of him here. How could they not be anxious? Zhang Lie's target was clearly these ruins; in other words, within these ruins was something he had to acquire at any costs.Zhang Lie had always given them an impression of strength and mystery, and they could hardly imagine just what sort of treasure would be inside.Chu Zhennan laughed. \"It's not too hard, but it might take some time. If I'm not wrong, this is a duplication-illusion array.\"\"A duplication-illusion array?\"A construction that was in vogue in the early days of the dimensional world\u2014not too complicated; the tedious part is finding the eye of the array. Only by doing so can we break out of this array and activate the teleportation array underneath!\"This series of questions and answers allowed Yun Bing and the others to get a good grasp of the situation.\"Uncle Nan, in that case, please hurry! If I'm not mistaken, our friend has already entered the extradimensional space, so we also have to hurry up, or he'll snatch up all the goodies!\" Chu Xun pressed, wanting to meet Zhang Lie again as soon as possible.Chu Zhennan stroked his beard. \"Chu Xun, there's no rush: the other three clans from the capital are about to arrive. Why don't we conserve our energy and wait for them? As for your friend, there's no need to worry at all. No matter what spoils he's managed to obtain, he'll have no choice but to hand them all over when faced with the might of the five clans of the capital.\"Chu Zhennan's words sent shivers down Chu Feng and Yun Bing's back.Chu Feng immediately argued, \"No, don't, Uncle Nan! Trust me, please, we need to enter immediately! If my friend came here, then there's surely treasure of unimaginable worth within. We'll surely benefit from entering first!\"Chu Feng was so insistent that it surprised even Chu Zhennan.But before he could say anything, Yun Bing also added, \"Uncle Zheng, Chu Feng's right. That friend of ours is really quite special, so we need to head down immediately!\"If it were only Chu Xun insisting on it, the two of them might have thought that she was simply impatient, but with Chu Feng and Yun Bing jumping into the fray as well, things were different. After all, both of them were being groomed for leadership positions within the clans, and they tended to be thoughtful and attentive to detail. If even they were in such a hurry, then there surely had to be something unusual about this friend of theirs.The two elders glanced at each other. Eventually, Yun Chongzheng said, \"Alright, if you're all in such a hurry, then the two of us will give it a try. However, don't expect too much: everything within the array will be twisted and distorted, and the eye likely won't be easy to find. It's quite possible that the other three clans will arrive before we can do so.\"\"That's not a problem, Uncle Zheng. Please try your best!\" Yun Bing immediately replied.\"In that case, we'll head inside now. Stay safe out here!\"\"Don't worry, there won't be anyone here who would dare to touch our clans!\"As Yun Bing and the others stepped back, the two elders stepped into the array.While the Yun and Chu clans were attempting to access the extradimensional space from without, Zhang Lie and the others were already reaping rewards from within.A long corridor at the opposite end of the plaza led to all variety of rooms, allowing Zhang Lie and the others to find quite a number of spoils, including frameworks and techniques, potion recipes, and a few pieces of armor and weapons. Of course, during this process, they encountered a number of small trials, but Zhang Lie easily overcame them all.What they had found was only the tip of the iceberg, because the Eclipse Sage's treasury wasn't located in any of the rooms of the castle at all, but rather underground. Yes, underground\u2014in an underground treasury!Information from his past life made Zhang Lie aware of just where the mechanism for accessing the treasury was, and heading to the treasury was his last remaining goal. However, because it would be somewhat dangerous, Zhang Lie intended on heading down alone.At the tallest clocktower of the Eclipse Sage's castle stood Zhang Lie, Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, Yang Ze, Li Feng, Zhou Ying, and Sun Xiaowu.\"Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, for now, your task is to help me guard this clocktower. The trials to access the treasury are still too dangerous for all of you, so it's best if I go down alone. Don't worry, I'll definitely be looking out for suitable treasures for all of you.\"Zhang Lie punched the heavy bell, causing a deep, resonant toll to sound throughout the castle.As the sound waves reverberated, the entire castle seemed to tremble, and a number of inscriptions could be seen on the surface of the bell. Right beneath the bell appeared a small teleportation array, seemingly out of nowhere.The moment it did, Zhang Lie stepped within it, vanishing in a flash of white light.The teleportation array vanished as though it had never existed.All that remained of Zhang Lie was his final instruction: \"Remember to ring the bell once every fifteen minutes!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94: Fighting Fire With FireAfter a short period of darkness, Zhang Lie appeared within a cramped underground chamber. It wasn't particularly large, and the sconce on the wall was only dimly lit. A person rested by one corner of the room\u2014 or, more accurately, a skeleton.This supposed treasury left Zhang Lie somewhat disappointed.After all, given how ornate the castle had been, why did this underground treasury look so dilapidated? It was the treasury of the Eclipse Sage himself!Regardless, Zhang Lie was quite certain that this place was indeed the Eclipse Sage's underground treasury. He glanced all around him. There were no treasures heaped up into small hills, or any sort of framework or technique manuals.In fact, within this supposed treasury, there was nothing but that skeleton left.Zhang Lie carefully inspected his surroundings, and eventually focused on the skeleton.In his past life, he had once accessed these ruins, but never the treasury. However, after the treasury was first accessed, a hunter who claimed to be the successor of the Eclipse Sage had appeared. Not only had that hunter learned [Eclipse], he had even acquired another of the Eclipse Sage's trademark techniques, [Art of the Rising Moon].Unfortunately for the hunter, he had died to a beast horde within the dimensional world, causing [Eclipse] to be lost forevermore.Zhang Lie made no further discoveries despite inspecting the skeleton for quite some time. There were no storage-type artifacts on the skeleton's body, and its clothes were as normal as could be. What on Earth could be going on?Zhang Lie had spent half the night\u2014on the eve of the Void Cup, no less\u2014searching for these ruins for [Eclipse]. Was he to return empty-handed?He tried to search all around the skeleton's body, but out of respect for the dead, he avoided touching the skeleton as much as he could.\"Well, are you disappointed?\"Zhang Lie's face grew dismal after a fruitless search, but just as the light from the sconce petered out and a beam of moonlight shone in from above, a striking specter appeared in front of Zhang Lie's eyes, his mien severe, his robes white and expansive, his sword gleaming and brilliant.The moment Zhang Lie saw him, he was certain of his identity.\"The Eclipse Sage!\"\"Yes, it's me!\"\"Y-You can speak? Are you man or ghost?\"\"Hah, I'm neither! A remnant of who I was, nothing more.\"\"A remnant? I didn't realize remnants were able to communicate so normally...\"\"It'll take too long to explain the details, so you can just treat me like an artificial intelligence!\"\"Very well, Eclipse Sage. I apologize for interrupting your rest, but as one of humanity's greats, surely you understand my intentions for coming here?\"\"For [Eclipse], of course.\"\"Yes, Sage! Your [Eclipse] has been used to devastating effect against the lifeforms of the dimensional world, and for it to remain a lost art would be a pity.\"The Sage's remnant seemed to smile. \"You're rather frank, aren't you? [Eclipse] has been a lifetime's worth of work for me. What makes you think I'll hand it over so easily?\"Zhang Lie grinned. \"What else would be the purpose of this extradimensional space? Given how hard you worked to advance humanity, you surely wouldn't allow death to terminate your efforts.\"\"Haha, not bad, not bad! You must have done quite a bit of research before coming here. In that case, I won't beat around the bush. Take on my final challenge!\"The Sage's words were quite surprising to Zhang Lie. After all, they had only shared a few words at best, and the Sage had no understanding of his character at all. Was he so cavalier about his inheritance?Zhang Lie had no time to think further. The moment the Sage finished talking, the four walls of the chamber shone with fiery inscriptions. A frightening surge of energy pressed down on his body, and he barely managed to stay upright.Instinctively, Zhang Lie countered the spiritual pressure with his own genetic energy. A black serpent emerged, coiling around him protectively. However, the moment his genetic energy left his body, he noticed something amiss\u2014it was quickly being depleted, no, being dissolved!Wisps of black smoke were floating away from the serpent surrounding him.This unusual technique... could it be [Eclipse]?!\u00a0Zhang Lie's heart leapt, first in surprise, then in greed. It had to be, without a doubt! After experiencing the effects of [Eclipse] for himself, he was even more adamant about acquiring it. It was simply far too compatible with the second stage of his [Ninecarp Transformation].However, he would have to focus on the challenge at hand first. If he didn't reduce the speed at which his genetic energy was being sapped away, he would be drained within five minutes, and even his genetic core would be in danger.Furthermore, if he didn't pass this trial and obtain the recognition of the Eclipse Sage, he would be unable to acquire [Eclipse].What was he to do? How could he prevent the loss of his genetic energy?If he used his genetic energy to counteract the dreadful pressure surrounding him, it would increase the rate at which his energy was being drained.However, if he didn't, his body would have to bear the brunt of the tremendous pressure.As expected, [Eclipse] was extremely difficult to deal with.Zhang Lie couldn't think of a strategy to counteract it in the heart of the moment.He felt more and more of his energy draining away; if he didn't come up with a solution quickly, he would soon be eliminated. But no amount of anxiety would help him now. No, he would have to calm down and focus, despite the inexorable drain.Zhang Lie closed his eyes and sat down cross-legged on the floor. He sensed the minute changes and fluctuations in his genetic energy at the moment they came into contact with [Eclipse], as though it were being devoured bit by bit.The more intensely his genetic energy surged, the faster the devouring process: his initial guess had been correct.Zhang Lie had no choice but to firmly suppress his genetic energy and keep it close to his core, but doing so would expose his body to the pressure.He shook as he retracted his genetic energy.Fortunately for him, he had filled all his gene fragments to capacity, and his body had been strengthened by both his foundational breakthrough and his consumption of Potion #1. Any other hunter would have been severely wounded the moment they stopped surrounding their body with a protective layer of genetic energy.As he forced himself to cope with the pressure, Zhang Lie activated his [Ninecarp Transformation], all his genetic energy condensed within his compact core, attempting to corrode his environment even as he himself was being drained.This was the only strategy he could come up with against [Eclipse].Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: Usurping the SpoilsYes, Zhang Lie would fight fire with fire.The second stage of his [Ninecarp Transformation] afforded him with extremely corrosive genetic energy, and he had discovered that [Eclipse] was consuming some sort of resource in order to dissolve his genetic energy, so if he were careful, it wouldn't be impossible to drain [Eclipse] before he was drained instead.His first attempt was reasonably successful. Even as his own genetic energy was consumed, he successfully corroded away part of [Eclipse]'s strength.When the Eclipse Sage saw what was happening, he couldn't help but praise Zhang Lie. \"Oh, your technique isn't too shabby! To think that it too would possess potent corrosive power! You have quite a few secrets, don't you?\"\"Sage, I'm trying to pass your trial! Please, let me concentrate!\" While Zhang Lie spoke, a significant fraction of genetic energy had been drained from his body.The Eclipse Sage guffawed.What followed would be a test of endurance. Whether or not Zhang Lie would be able to pass the trial would depend on just how large the Eclipse Sage's reservoir of energy was. Zhang Lie's only goal was to hold out as long as possible, until his last skein of genetic energy had been dissolved away.As he hunkered down and settled into silence, the portal to the ruins became more crowded than ever. After the Yun and Chu clans, the Zhou, He, and Qian clans successively arrived at the portal, but one step too slowly.By the time they found the weathered stump, the Yun and Chu clans had managed to break past the array and head inside. Worse, the array had restored itself, and they would have to find the eye on their own.This would give the Yun and Chu clans a head start.Zhou Qiang motioned for the four clans of the Liao family to head over, trying to understand the situation, but the more they heard, the more panicked they became. The Yun and Chu clans were both rather strong, and now that they had taken the lead, it was possible that they would monopolize the best items for themselves.Of course, no matter how much they tried, they wouldn't be able to obtain the Eclipse Sage's inheritance. Neither would the Yun and Chu clans.By the time Yun Bing and Chu Feng arrived at the clocktower with their elites in tow, Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, and the others were guarding its vicinity. Only when they saw the familiar faces of Yun Bing and Chu Feng did they seem to relax a little.The Yun and Chu clans were shocked to see them. Yun Bing and Chu Feng were quite familiar with Fang Yi and Sun Mengmeng, and they knew full well that they were Zhang Lie's subordinates. If they were here around the clocktower, then their leader, Zhang Lie, was surely somewhere within the ruins.\"Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, it really is you guys!\" Chu Feng exclaimed.The Yun and Chu scions had interacted with them quite a few times already, and they instantly confirmed that the mysterious appearance of these ruins had something to do with Zhang Lie.\"Good to see you, Young Master Chu, Miss Yun!\" Fang Yi greeted them with a smile, as did the other members of Team Zenith, but they were as alert as ever.Li Feng, who was up by the bell, immediately crouched down, not wanting to attract attention to himself.\"Where's Zhang Lie?\" Yun Bing asked.Fang Yi's eyes glinted. \"Since you're friends with the captain, I won't keep it a secret from you: he's undertaking the trial of inheritance!\"His words shocked the Yun and Chu clans, and the elders of the two clans couldn't stand still any longer.\"The trial of inheritance? Tell us where your leader is! \u00a0Where's the treasury?!\" Chu Zhennan yelled, threats edging into his tone.He had no choice; of course he would be anxious.After entering the ruins, the construction and style of the castle, along with the rooms they had gone through, made it quite clear that the owner of these ruins was none other than the Eclipse Sage, a hunter with such renown that he was included in the Xumi Tome.If nothing else, his lost inheritance, [Eclipse], was sufficiently valuable a treasure that the great clans of China would fight tooth and nail over it.\"I don't know, and I wouldn't say even if I did!\"Fang Yi refused to budge despite Chu Zhennan's threats.\"Lad, you really aren't afraid of anything, are you? Well\u2014\"\"Uncle Zheng, please stop! Let Chu Feng and I handle this. We know each other, after all, and we're friends!\" Seeing that Chu Zhennan's threat was ineffective, Yun Chongzheng was about to speak when Yun Bing interrupted him.No, neither the Yun nor Chu clans could afford to offend Zhang Lie, and neither could Yun Bing and Chu Feng themselves! After all, they still had a favor to beg of Zhang Lie, and if they were to sour the relationship between them, they wouldn't have any opportunity to obtain the Potion #1 that they had been eyeing.As for the two clan elders, they wouldn't have reacted so aggressively if they knew that Zhang Lie was the one who had sold them the information about the foundational breakthrough.Yun Bing's words made the two clan elders eye each other. Both Yun Bing and Chu Feng had made several choices that they didn't understand that night, but they had been designated as the leaders of this expedition, and the elders' responsibility was only to assist and protect them.If they were friends with these other hunters, perhaps they would be able to find out what was going on more easily.With these thoughts in mind, the two elders nodded tersely and stepped back, letting Chu Feng and Yun Bing direct the conversation.Once they had received the elders' affirmation, Chu Feng and Yun Bing immediately stepped forward.\"Fang Yi, I'll tell you the truth: it'll be impossible for you to claim all the spoils from these ruins for yourselves!\" Chu Feng spoke directly.Fang Yi cocked an eyebrow. \"Indeed? Do you intend on wresting them away by force, just like these esteemed elders here?\"\"No, no, of course not, Fang Yi! As you've said, we're friends with Zhang Lie, and it's exactly because we're friends that I'm telling you this now! As for you, are you unaware of the situation outside the ruins?\"Fang Yi and the others suddenly realized that they had neglected an important question: how had Chu Feng and the others found their way over here?When they had first noticed a party heading in their direction, the members of Team Zenith all tensed up, trying to think about who those hunters could be. Were they enemies, or were they friends?But they had neglected to think about how those hunters had made their way to the scene.After all, Zhang Lie had mentioned that, after they entered, the array would repair itself. The fact that other hunters had appeared in the ruins meant that its location had been exposed, and there were surely other hunters lying in wait outside.This was apparent from Chu Feng's words.\"What's the situation like out there?\" Fang Yi asked, trying to gather more information.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: Chu Feng's Lie\"The four major clans of Liao and five from the capital have all gathered by these ruins,\" Chu Feng informed Fang Yi and the others. \"And if I'm not mistaken, the clans from nearby Qing are on their way too. Not only that, government officials in charge of discovered ruins are also going to arrive soon. You understand what sort of situation you're in, don't you?\"Fang Yi and the others' eyes widened.No, they didn't. They didn't realize that the night excursion that Zhang Lie had led them on would have such repercussions\u2014the four clans of Liao, the five of the capital, those from Qing, the federal government...Fang Yi refocused on Chu Feng. \"Young Master Chu, you're not \u00a0lying to us, are you?\"Before Chu Feng could speak, Yun Bing jumped in. \"Lying to you? Is there such a need? When you uncovered the ruins, a beam of light emerged from the portal, so bright it turned night to day and spooked half the citizens of Liao. Information spread immediately!\"If Zhang Lie were here, we would tell him the same thing. Regardless, one thing is certain: Zhang Lie cannot hope to claim all the spoils from these ruins for himself. The reason we chose to head in first was to inform him to keep the most valuable objects for himself, but to prepare to hand over the rest.\"Only then, only with the help of the Yun and Chu clans, can you all hope to get away from this unscathed. You have to tell us where Zhang Lie is. We need to come up with something to deal with the forces converging on this location.\"Yun Bing's words clearly indicated that she would stand on Zhang Lie's side.After experiencing all sorts of surprises from Zhang Lie within the dimensional world, she and Chu Feng had begun to trust him implicitly, and it was this trust that caused them to choose to leave the treasures with Zhang Lie himself.Yun Bing's words caused the members of Team Zenith to look at her with gratitude, but Zhang Lie had instructed them to protect the clocktower at all costs. In other words, they couldn't allow anyone else access to the underground treasury.As a result, despite Yun Bing's kind intentions, they refused her.\"I apologize, Miss Yun, I know you're quite close to our captain, but he instructed us not to let anyone in. We can't reveal anything to you, but I ask that you trust our captain. Since he brought us here, he could well have come up with a solution for the scenario that you're describing, so please, I beseech you to wait for him. Perhaps he'll be out very soon!\" Sun Mengmeng jumped in.With her words, the situation became a stalemate: both parties understood each other, but neither was able to convince the other to give in.What they didn't know was that, while they were waiting for Zhang Lie, a great hubbub had descended by the entrance to the ruins. The remaining three clans from the capital, four from Qing, six from Meng, and the officials from the ministry of ruins had all arrived at the scene, and they were entering the castle in batches.The first would be the three clans from the capital, followed by the officials, then the four from Qing, four from Liao, and finally six from Meng.Meanwhile, Zhang Lie's trial was reaching its conclusion.Li Feng, who had lain hidden at the top of the clocktower, again rang the bell. As the sound waves reverberated through the castle, a small teleportation array again emerged underneath the bell, but only for a short moment. Subsequently, the runic inscriptions on the bell faded away, as though nothing had ever happened.None of the hunters below knew what exactly was going on, but their attention was all drawn to the clocktower.Chu Feng asked, \"Why are you ringing the bell? Is there any meaning to it?\"\"I'm sorry, Young Master Chu, but we don't know. Our captain instructed us to ring the bell without explaining why,\" Fang Yi stated.Zhang Lie had left so quickly that he hadn't given them any further instructions or information save to ring the bell every fifteen minutes.Because of the bell's tolling, the Zhou, He, and Qian clans, which had just stepped through the portal, immediately gave up searching the perimeter and headed right toward the source of the sound.Within a few minutes, the five great clans of the capital had gathered underneath the clocktower.Zhou Hong, He Feng, and Qian Hong, had each brought over a dozen elites and an elder from their respective clans, a considerable force indeed.\"Yun Bing, Chu Feng, what's the current situation? Who are these people?\"As clans of the capital, the gathered parties were all quite familiar with each other, and it was evident at a glance that Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, and the others represented an unknown third party. Furthermore, the members of Team Zenith were standing by themselves, away from the Yun or Chu delegations.Unexpectedly, Zhou Hong's words were more curious than combative.Chu Feng smiled sheepishly. \"Good timing. We just arrived ourselves, and upon discovering this clocktower, thought that there might be some mechanism associated with the bell, so I had them give it a good ring. Unfortunately, it caused a loud commotion, but nothing else! As for who these people are, they're professional ruin delvers that I sent for.\"Everyone was shocked at his words.The members of Team Zenith were surprised by how quickly Chu Feng had spun up his fabrication, papering over everything and shielding them with his clan's status and power.The Chu and Yun clans were surprised that Chu Feng had made such a decision. In that case, at least for this expedition, the two clans would be inextricably linked to Zhang Lie and his Team Zenith. The two clan elders cast confused glances in his direction: after all, Chu Feng wasn't known for hoodwinking others. Why was he doing so now?Yun Bing, Chu Xun, and Yun Meng, on the other hand, applauded his quick thinking.Meanwhile, the Zhou, He, and Qian clans were surprised that the Yun and Chu clans had been so prepared that they would have professional ruin delvers on call.\"It looks as though you were quite... prepared... for this unusual event, Young Master Chu,\" Zhou Hong spoke up again, but this time his tone seemed quite a bit more suspicious.\"Haha, it was just a matter of luck! They were present when the beam of light emerged, so...\"\"In that case, with a professional team with you, as well as your early entrance into the ruins, you must have reaped quite a few rewards, Young Master Chu, Miss Yun?\" Beside Zhou Hong, He Feng spoke up.They were all familiar with one another, so he didn't have any qualms about being so direct.\"We've picked up a few things here and there, but nothing particularly good. The Eclipse Sage's inheritance still hasn't been found, and I wish you all luck in the search!\"Chu Feng's words clearly relieved the other clans. If no one had found it yet, then they still had a chance!FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: Obtaining the InheritanceThe Zhou, He, and Qian clans immediately turned to leave, beginning their search for the treasury and the Eclipse Sage's long-lost inheritance. They all understood that, as more and more hunters gathered at the scene, the less likely it would be for them to find the inheritance.Chu Feng and the others were happy to see them leave. Of course, Chu Feng's trick wouldn't delay them for too long; the ruins weren't too large, and the hunters of the three clans would finish searching it relatively quickly.By then, not having made any discovery, they would notice that something was amiss, and to gather back at the clocktower again. At that point in time, it would be much harder for Chu Feng and the others to dismiss them.Meanwhile, the clans from Qing, as well as the government officials, had finally broken through the illusion array and entered the ruins. As the number of hunters in the ruin increased, the ruins grew more chaotic, but this chaos didn't affect Zhang Lie, who was still participating in the Eclipse Sage's trial.The trial was almost over; in the underground chamber, the runic inscriptions had dimmed considerably, and Zhang Lie could sense that his genetic energy was being dissolved far more slowly as well.Under the moonlight, even as the Eclipse Sage's body grew transparent, he let out a satisfied smile.\"Lad, you're the first person to successfully survive [Eclipse] by exhausting the caster's energy! Furthermore, even though your primary framework isn't very high-ranking, the corrosive nature of your genetic energy is particularly compatible with [Eclipse]. Yes, the heavens have left me with a worthy successor indeed!\"With the Eclipse Sage's confirmation, the trial finally came to an end, and Zhang Lie slumped over.That trial had only lasted at most a quarter-hour, but it felt like hours to Zhang Lie. He had almost completely exhausted his supply of genetic energy\u2014yes, exhausted, not dissolved.Comparatively little of his genetic energy had been dissolved; most was used up in countering and defending against [Eclipse], then striking back at it. It was only for this reason that he was able to make it to the end of the trial, having forced the runic inscriptions powering [Eclipse] to exhaust much of their stored energy as well.Regardless, Zhang Lie viewed [Eclipse] as a ridiculously overpowered technique, and the remnant of the Eclipse Sage likewise viewed Zhang Lie as a ridiculously overpowered hunter.\"Thank you for the praise, esteemed Sage. Your [Eclipse] is shockingly powerful!\"\"Haha, of course! It's my life's work!\"To the Eclipse Sage, [Eclipse] was his magnum opus. The day he created it, his life was changed forever, and the title of Eclipse Sage had come from this grand achievement.\"However, compared to you, this is nothing worth bragging about. Believe me: the future you will surely be far stronger than even I could be. Handing [Eclipse] to you will be a relief to me, but before I do so, I hope you can promise me two things.\"The Eclipse Sage, finding his successor more and more pleasing to the eye, couldn't help heaping a few more praises upon him, but suddenly changed his tone upon remembering something.Of course, Zhang Lie couldn't back down now. \"I'll do anything, Sage!\"\"Oh? Are you so sure of your capabilities that you can do anything?\" He guffawed again. His tone was doubtful, but he was actually quite happy with Zhang Lie's attitude.\"As long as I don't die, I'll keep growing stronger. I might not be able to handle these responsibilities now, but I firmly believe I can do so in the future!\"As an experienced hunter, this sort of question wouldn't stump Zhang Lie. Furthermore, if the Sage was subjecting him to this line of questioning...\"Not bad, lad, not bad! In that case, I have two tasks for you. Destroy the Musi clan on the star Tarkus, and assist the remaining members of the Hong clan in the Tianhong city on Mars, any that were fortunate enough to survive the calamity!\"The Eclipse Sage quickly listed two tasks for his successor, his tone seething as he spoke.\"Yes, Sage! I swear I'll do my best to accomplish these tasks.\"\"Good! In that case, accept my inheritance!\"The Eclipse Sage's remnant appeared in front of Zhang Lie. Before he could react, it struck the center of Zhang Lie's forehead with a pointed finger, instantly making him feel as though he were burning all over, as if all his cells were being vaporized, as his bones and muscles creaked and compressed.A voice seemed to speak distantly to him, \"Meditate on the realm of [Eclipse]!\"You think I can meditate in this state?\u00a0With his body completely drained of energy both mental and physical, he lost consciousness then and there.After an indeterminate amount of time, Zhang Lie woke up groggy in the now-familiar underground chamber, and what happened immediately before he lost consciousness slowly drifted back to him. After checking that his body was fine, he let out a sigh of relief.\"What sort of meditation did that old geezer expect I could do right after finishing his trial?!\"That said, the moment he felt the strength surging through his body, Zhang Lie found himself quite satisfied with the experience. Not only had this final hurdle strengthened his body to some extent, he even discovered a manual that the Eclipse Sage had left in his mind, detailing the process for cultivating [Eclipse], as well as a few tricks and techniques for using it effectively.Zhang Lie circulated his genetic energy according to the description in the manual, causing mysterious energy to waft out of his body and suffuse a region a hundred meters wide around him. This\u2014this was [Eclipse]![Eclipse], a mythic-grade technique with no elemental attunement, would allow its user to form a unique domain around it, supported by the user's genetic energy. This unusual ability had myriad possible applications; the most obvious was a fieldwide debuff that would nullify any numerical advantage against Zhang Lie.It seemed as though the 'meditative experience' he had had earlier was meant to engrave [Eclipse] on his genetic core, courtesy of the Eclipse Sage. As a result, he was able to turn the eclipse domain on and off at will, with a facility that would have taken years of experience to obtain normally.What skill the Eclipse Sage had! And yet such an esteemed figure had fallen to the devious struggles and internal politics of mankind. If he were still alive, humanity wouldn't have suffered the disastrous calamity it did a hundred years later.It was a pity indeed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: At All CostsZhang Lie sighed in regret. The Eclipse Sage had been one of the brightest stars among the first wave of humanity's hunters. Except for [Eclipse], he had also left seven pinnacle-grade techniques and two mythic-grade techniques in his mental world, the last pieces of the Eclipse Sage's inheritance.Despite being a sage, the Eclipse Sage was actually quite poor in terms of material resources, leaving behind not a single decent piece of equipment.However, Zhang Lie was grateful and exuberant for what he had received: after all, from start to finish, he had only ever eyed [Eclipse].And now that he had gotten what he was here for, it was naturally time to leave.By that time, the clocktower that Fang Yi and the others were guarding had become the center of attention. The five clans of the capital, the six from Qing, four from Liao, and the government officials, over two hundred hunters in all, had gathered beneath the clocktower. They were all staring at Chu Feng, Yun Bing, and the other members of those two delegations.By this point, they had scoured every other piece of these ruins, finding nothing but a few extremely low-quality weapons. As such, they focused their attention on Chu Feng and Yun Bing, whose hunters had been the first to arrive at the scene, and whose behavior had been the most suspicious.Since the beginning, none of the hunters gathered by the clocktower had stepped away from it; and not only that, they had come up with all sorts of reasons to prevent the other clans from entering, or even approaching, it.Wasn't that suspicious?In the end, the hunters blocked Chu Feng, Yun Bing, and the members of Team Zenith by the entrance to the clocktower, trying to get an explanation as to their actions.\"Young Master Chu, Miss Yun, as hunters from major clans, surely you're aware of the rules and regulations surrounding discovered ruins? As a member of the ministry of ruins, by the authority vested in me by the federal government, I insist that you move aside. You have no reason or authority to bar me from searching the interior of the clocktower!\"These ruins appeared in Liao, and I, the head of the Liao division of the ministry of ruins, should have priority in searching through it! If you continue deterring my search, I'll have no choice but to detain you all for disruption of the public good!\" Zhang Quan threatened.\"Your speech isn't bad, and neither is the aura you're projecting, but please keep one thing in mind: neither Yun Bing nor I will cower in the face of a threat. Are you sure you want to play this card against us?\" Chu Feng asked, his gaze piercing, perfectly assuming the role of a spoiled, arrogant young master of a major clan.The hunters arrayed outside the clocktower were buzzing in impatience.Zhou Hong, from the Zhou clan, was the first to speak up. \"Chu Feng, stop pretending to be a fool. Move aside! It's not just the ministry of ruins who wants to enter the clocktower. I believe I speak for everyone here when I say that we all want to enter, and we all must be allowed to enter! What exactly are you trying to protect? You'd better tell us the truth, or neither the Yun nor Chu clans will be bringing anything out of these ruins!\"Once he finished, He Feng immediately added, \"Yes, Young Master Zhou's right. The He clan will fully support his declaration: if your two clans don't explain the situation, the He clan won't allow you to leave!\"Qian Hong, from the Qian clan, also stepped forward. \"Think matters over, Young Master Chu. After all, we're all major players in the capital. Is there really a need to sour relationships between us?\"We three clans, along with the officials from the ministry of ruins, as well as the many clans from Qing and Liao, are all gathered here to inspect the clocktower behind you. Won't you show us this courtesy?\"The other clans murmured their agreement, not daring to threaten the Yun and Chu clans outright, but making their stance clear.It was apparent that, if the Yun and Chu clans didn't give in, what awaited them would be resistance and retaliation from the gathered crowd. Even the elders from the two clans were staring at Chu Bing and Yun Feng, trying to get them to change their mind.However, despite the mounting pressure, neither Yun Bing nor Chu Feng gave in.\"Qian Hong, what do you mean? Just as you ask that we show the three clans of the capital some respect, so too do we ask that you show us the same courtesy. If you insist on using force, then I shall have no choice but to do the same. If nothing else, I can guarantee that we shall all suffer the same fate.\"Yun Bing raised a palm, displaying the glowing black orb clenched within for one and all to see.Everyone present sucked in a breath.\"An orb of primality!\" Zhou Hong and the others shouted.An orb of primality was a mythic-grade weapon that could rarely be found in ruins, with devastating power that would strike directly at a hunter's genes.Once it was activated, the genes of all living creatures nearby would undergo sudden atavism, reversing the effects of billions of years' worth of evolution and turning all hunters present to paramecia, to amoebae, to basal prokaryotic and eukaryotic lifeforms.\"Miss Yun, please be calm! You can't trigger that orb!\"Every hunter present recoiled in ancestral fear. It would truly be a fate worse than death, and no treasure from the dimensional world would save them at that point.\"You have nothing to worry: I fear death as much as the rest of you. As long as you refrain from threatening me, I have no intention of detonating this orb. To be quite frank, the top of the clocktower is the entrance to the Eclipse Sage's treasury, but one of my hunters is already inside.\"Regardless of his success, I will not allow any other hunter to enter before he comes out. As for what happens afterward, and in which order you all intend to enter, I leave to your discretion. If you believe me, I recommend that you sit down and wait. If you don't, I will be happy to entertain any challengers.\"The crowd of hunters went silent. No one had expected that Yun Bing would be so adamant, nor that she had made such a calculated plan.Of course, the members of Team Zenith were touched by her gesture. They didn't expect that, even under such circumstances, Chu Feng and Yun Bing would protect their captain with so much drive.It completely changed the way Fang Yi viewed the scions of the major clans\u2014 there were actually those whose eyes weren't blinded by profit for themselves!The members of Team Zenith felt as though they too had to step forward and do something, but at that precise moment, as Li Feng rang the bell of the clocktower once more and waves of sound reverberated through the castle, the figure of another man appeared by the bell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: High StakesYun Bing was well known in the capital for her calm, cool, and collected nature, and her calculated threat with the orb of primality left every hunter present stunned. It forced the various factions to calm down, but though it held them back for a moment, it wouldn't be able to do so for long.After a moment's hesitation, Qian Hong slowly stepped forward. \"Miss Yun, your orb of primality might be a threat indeed, but it surely isn't guaranteed that you'll be able to kill all of us here. If any of us were to escape, then the Yun and Chu clans would be doomed.\"Even though the Yun and Chu clans were relatively strong, it would still be difficult for them to deal with all the factions that had gathered here today.Yun Bing's face remained as impassive as ever. Chu Feng stepped forward, barely curtailing his genetic energy, his intention obvious. They wouldn't let anyone disturb Zhang Lie at all costs.Their opposition, ultimately fearing the orb of primality in Yun Bing's hands, reined in their genetic energy and didn't dare make a move.The scene descended into a stalemate, and the tension grew so thick in the air that it was almost palpable.Amidst the swelling tension, Zhang Lie slowly walked down the stairs of the clocktower and into plain sight.\"Oh? What's going on here? Yun Bing, Chu Feng, it looks like you're both in trouble!\" The moment Zhang Lie appeared, he began teasing Yun Bing and Chu Feng.He had learned about what had happened during his departure from Li Feng, and he was honestly quite thankful to the two of them for taking on the other three clans in the capital, and even the ministry of ruins, on his behalf.This was why he chose to step forward now, forcing everyone's attention on him, and making it obvious that he was the hunter whom the Chu and Yun clans had deemed fit to head into the treasury.\"Haha! Yun Bing, now that your friend's out, surely there's no reason to keep us from the clocktower any longer?\"The crowd of hunters had all gathered here in search of wealth, not a fight. Since Zhang Lie had come out of the treasury empty-handed, they might still have some chance at the inheritance.Yun Bing smiled as she stored her orb of primality. \"As you please.\"Zhang Lie didn't spare the crowd a single glance. Looking at Yun Bing and Chu Feng, he asked, \"Did these fellows threaten you while I was gone?\"Of course, Zhang Lie's arrogant tone incited the fury of the gathered hunters, and one of the hunters from the other three major clans in the capital was just about to say something when white flames spread down the top of the clocktower, causing it\u2014and the large copper bell\u2014to crumble into ash and dust.The gathered hunters had a wide array of emotion on their faces.Some were shocked, wondering why the teleportation array had suddenly self-destructed, and some sighed deeply, understanding that the inheritance of the Eclipse Sage would forever be lost to them. Most, however, were glancing toward Zhang Lie with envy and jealousy.\"You damned bastard! You dared to destroy the teleportation array? \u00a0Don't think that you can do what you want just because the Yun and Chu clans are protecting you!\" Zhou Hong shouted.It was obvious that this Zhang Lie had obtained the Eclipse Sage's inheritance and whatever wealth he possessed. Now that even the teleportation array itself had been destroyed, they would make him cough up as much as they could.The members of Team Zenith stepped forward, intending to defend Zhang Lie.\"I didn't destroy the array, but you can think what you want.\" Zhang Lie ignored them and glanced over at his teammates, Yun Bing, and Chu Feng. Seeing that they were all unharmed, he let out a sigh of relief.He didn't intend on provoking the other clans and factions, but that didn't mean that he was afraid of them.\"You must be Miss Yun's good friend, Zhang Lie.\" \u00a0Zhang Quan, leader of the delegation from the ministry of ruins, spoke up. He didn't know this Zhang Lie fellow at all, and the only reason he was so polite was out of deference for the Yun and Chu clans.\"I'm an official from the ministry of ruins. The ministry of ruins should have first priority over any ruins that appear in the region. Not only have you entered the ruins without our permission, Zhang Lie, you've even destroyed the teleportation array into the Eclipse Sage's treasury. What do you have to say for yourself?\" Zhang Quan challenged Zhang Lie, intending to lay the blame for these alleged crimes on him.\"As I've said, I didn't destroy the teleportation array\u2014it self-destructed. Perhaps it was because I acquired the inheritance of the Eclipse Sage.\"Every hunter present turned toward him. These particular ruins were of no small importance to them, and even more ordinary ruins would require a dedicated team a month or two's worth of scouting and surveyance to minimize the danger required for obtaining the ruins' inheritance.Of course, there were a few ruins, generally those of the highest echelon of hunters, that would self-destruct after a successor to the inheritance had been found. In that case\u2026Identical expressions of greed and excitement appeared on many of the hunters' faces. If Zhang Lie had obtained the inheritance, then they wouldn't have to undergo any dangerous trial to obtain the inheritance for themselves: they just had to divest Zhang Lie of his newfound wealth!Of course, Zhang Lie noticed their killing intent immediately. \"Hah, trying to kill me and take the inheritance for yourself, are you?\"Yun Bing immediately stepped up to Zhang Lie's side, brandishing her orb of primality and once again setting up the stalemate that had descended right before Zhang Lie's reappearance.In the end, it was an elder from the Zhou clan who stepped forward. \"Haha! it looks as though you've grossly underestimated us five major clans of the capital. We do want to acquire the Eclipse Sage's inheritance for ourselves, but we surely wouldn't stoop to the dishonorable deeds you suggest.\"That said, it simply wouldn't do for us to return with nothing, not when we had expended so many resources to gather here. Neither would it make sense to start a fight: everyone has some sort of dead man's switch, and a serious fight would hurt us all.\"He looked at Zhang Lie expectantly.\"You want a share of the spoils, of course. In that case, what do you propose?\"Zhang Lie circulated his genetic energy throughout his body, ready to call upon it on a moment's notice. At this point, it seemed quite likely that he would have to fight, but he would listen to their terms first.Fortunately, after accepting the Eclipse Sage's inheritance, he had gained significant familiarity with these ruins, and he had a way of evading the other clans' pursuit if he had to.\"Haha! Zhang Lie, if you're so confident in your abilities, will you stake the spoils from these ruins on a match?\" The Zhou elder finally showed his true colors.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: Fire-AdvantagedZhang Lie smiled. \"Best of three, then?\"Although he would be able to escape on his own, he had ended up embroiling the Yun and Chu clans in his affairs. Furthermore, it would be somewhat more difficult with Fang Yi, Sun Mengmeng, and the rest of Team Zenith in tow.Settling the dispute with a match would be the cleanest resolution, and one that was overwhelmingly in his favor.\"As you will,\" the Zhou elder replied, having glanced all around him to see if there were any objections.\"Count me in!\" Chu Feng patted Zhang Lie's shoulder. At this key juncture, he was the first one to step up and support Zhang Lie.\"I, as well.\" Yun Bing did the same.The Yun and Chu elders stared even more curiously at Zhang Lie; meanwhile, Zhang Lie cast a grateful glance at Yun Bing and Chu Feng. Except for him, none of the members of Team Zenith were qualified to take part: he would be facing off against the other clans' equivalents of Yun Bing and Chu Feng, the best hunters of the younger generation.If the two of them hadn't volunteered, Zhang Lie would have had to fight all three matches by himself.\"Thank you for your assistance,\" Zhang Lie murmured. \"I'll owe you both a favor for today's events.\"A favor was a precious thing indeed, especially from someone like Zhang Lie.\"I'll take your word for it, Zhang Lie! In that case, leave the first match to me!\" Chu Feng stepped forward, wind-attuned genetic energy surging all around him.His competitor followed: Zhou Hong, from the Zhou clan.The younger generation of the major clans of the capital all knew each other, but few of them had ever exchanged blows. The reason Zhou Hong stepped forward was because of his elemental attunement. Everyone knew that the Chu clan favored wind-attuned techniques, whereas the Zhou clan favored fire-attuned techniques.While the two elements weren't in direct opposition, fire would have an advantage over wind.\"Chu Feng, we're both members of the five major clans of the capital. Shouldn't we stand united? Who would have thought that you would oppose everyone here on behalf of some hunter with nothing to his name? Are you really that righteous, or are you just a fool?\" Zhou Hong mocked Chu Feng confidently.From his perspective, he had already won the match.\"We'll just have to see, won't we?\" Chu Feng activated his footwork technique and dashed toward Zhou Hong. A gale of wind blew by, caressing the strands of his hair. For a brief moment, he seemed untethered to the mortal world.His opponent, Zhou Hong, surged with genetic energy, as though he were smothering himself in a dense layer of smoke. Zhou Hong was a careful hunter, and the first thing he did was to protect himself against attack.In contrast, Chu Feng's offense seemed far more impactful. The onlookers were left with the sensation that Chu Feng was a strong hunter indeed.The moment he vanished from sight, Zhou Hong felt a devastating gale blowing right toward him so strongly that he couldn't even keep his eyes open. However, his defense wasn't for naught.Chu Feng was certainly a strong opponent, but Zhou Hong wasn't weak, either. He punched forward with a flaming fist, shooting jets of flame into the air and forcing Chu Feng back.Zhou Hong's dull-looking defense actually empowered his flames significantly, fortifying him and protecting him as though he were encased within a live volcano.Fortunately, Chu Feng's reflexes were quick enough to dodge the blow; if he had been hit by the roiling waves of fire and downed by Zhou Hong's very first attack, his reputation would have been ruined.The two competitors had each gained a measure of the other's strength.Green gusts of wind and fiery bursts of flame filled the field. Neither party used a weapon; this fight would solely be determined by framework and technique, strength and constitution, and their reserves of genetic energy.\"[Wind Palm]!\"\"[Fists of Flame]!\"With an explosion of genetic energy, palm and fist met each other, shaking the entire castle. Amidst the dense smoke that resulted, both combatants stumbled a few steps back, neither having gained the advantage from the clash.Zhou Hong, successor to the Zhou clan and the strongest among the Zhou hunters of his generation, was at the top of the Maple settlement's gene leaderboard, and it was only natural that he would have true skill.Chu Feng's gaze filled with excitement. Ever since he had advanced to the second position on the Blacksteel settlement's gene leaderboard, he hadn't had such an enjoyable fight.Flames surged all around the battlefield, as did gusts of wind so sharp they felt like blades.The two hunters within tangled together. With another huge explosion, they stumbled apart, a few superficial injuries marring their skin. Neither combatant had yet displayed their true strength; they were simply warming up and testing the other party.After yet another clash, they grew tired of dancing around each other, and each began to gather genetic energy around them. Around Chu Feng swirled a whirlwind; around Zhou Hong, a storm of fire. Both were rapidly growing larger by the second, and as they glanced at each other, their masses of genetic energy reaching a peak, they shouted almost simultaneously,\"[Hallowed Winds]!\"\"[Primeval Fire]!\"A blinding green light and a frightening blast of fire impacted against each other, causing a massive quake. The gathered hunters lost their footing, and the clocktower and nearby buildings crumbled into oblivion.Clouds of dust and grit scoured the battlefield, swirling without end. The hunters nearby were all astounded by the strength of the combatants.Because this was only a match, and not a fight to the death, neither of them used their weapons or soulshards\u2014but even with bare hands and fists, with technique alone, they had wrought such devastation!So these were the successors to the major clans of the capital!The flames and whirling wind dissipated in a matter of moments, but silence filled the battlefield. Everyone craned their necks, trying to discern what lay at its heart, at the intersection of green and red.\"They... couldn't have both perished, could they?\"\"I doubt it, it's only a match! Would the successors of the great clans die so easily?\"The smoke finally cleared, revealing a lone figure.\"It's Chu Feng!\" someone shouted, and everyone focused their attention on what lay ahead of them.Much of Chu Feng's garments had been swallowed up by the flame, and he looked quite the worse for wear, but, most importantly, the tip of his pointer finger was touching Zhou Hong's throat.A small jab would be all it took to kill Zhou Hong.\"Not bad, Zhou Hong. It's a pity that your opponent was me\u2014you've lost!\"The Yun and Chu delegations erupted in cheers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
