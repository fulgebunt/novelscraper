Well, for me at least.To put it simply.I've had a few choices I regret in my life.Choices that led me into this situation.Why, there's typically that one thing.I shouldn\u2019t have played that damned game.[ Savior Rising ]In short, academy genre shows. The drama between innocent youth, usually featuring complex and multifaceted characters. While, at the same time, retaining familiarity and archetypes.It\u2019s a good game.If only I didn't get stuck there.Does that even make sense? Could someone get dragged in a game for playing it?I'm completely oblivious as to why this happened. Is it because some God-like being willed it or the attachment I have with the main character?Like usual, I completed the game, saw through the ending, had my fun and then went to bed.The next time I opened my eyes, I was already here.\u201cMy dear. Are you listening?\u201dI didn't answer.Maybe that person wouldn't notice that I\u2019m here and go away.Oh, please.\u201cI already knew you're in there. You\u2019d better open the door.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI have already talked with (Dorm) Supervisor Ophelia, you have no special class scheduled today.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThey're like a stalker.I'll need to come up with another way to send them away\u2026\u201cAlright, so you're really going to ignore me till the end?\u201dA helpless sigh came from behind the door.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll cut this thing down and invite myself in.\u201dThis lunatic...Without giving me any chance to respond, a pitch-black sword that seemed to suck up all the surrounding light pierced the door of my private room.The Elfante Imperial Academy's dorm facility was designed to keep the students inside safe even when against large monsters.It was not, by any means, easy to break.However, this terrifying woman just cut through it like cardboard.\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t this a violation of the school rules?\u201d\"The Student Council is responsible for enforcing the punishment for the rule violations. It just so happens that I'm the Student Council President.\u201dShe literally just admitted to abusing her power.The woman then sheathed the black sword into a similarly dark scabbard, which matched her also-dark outfit.She wore black clothing from head to toe, contrasting the whiteness of her pale skin and long straight hair. Her bright red eyes particularly popped in such a monochrome color scheme.Finally, the distinctive \u2018noble\u2019 air around her ties all those features together.This unique look was engraved in my memory.No, it's impossible to forget.\u201c\"I came because I have something to say. You've been avoiding me lately.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\"That's about... the 32nd time now?\"\"...Why are you counting this?\"I bluntly replied, as I collect my thoughts.Elnore, the Student Council President of Elfante Academy.She's a popular belle well-rounded in both literary and martial arts, and is the daughter of Duke Tristan.A character that shines blindingly bright and a freshman-nobody like me would never cross paths.At least, that's what should've happened, if things went the way they're supposed to.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn the first place, not being involved with this woman was better for me.More images flood my mind.The illustrations and CGs I saw in the 'original work'.A bloodied Elnore building mountains of corpses with her black longsword. Elnore, with her red eyes flashing fiercely, commanding an army of demons and monsters.Etc., etc.What's certain though, was that regardless of where you look, she leaves one consistent impression.She's a \u2018frightening villain\u2019.Yes, that's no secret.This woman is the \u2018Final Boss\u2019 of this Sera World. If the protagonist doesn\u2019t stop her, she'll eventually throw the whole world in a fire pit.A person of such caliber and significance should have just passed by an extra like me, nothing more.\u201cYou know why I came all the way here.\u201dHowever, in the end, it's too late.The butterfly wings had already fluttered and blew the gust of fate that led me to this current situation.Her red eyes coldly stared at me, while her grip on the sword's handle tightened.The heavy atmosphere became even more serious.Her mouth parted once more.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you again, Dowd Campbell.\u201dA \u2018storm\u2019 had brewed with the flap of the butterfly's wings.\u201cWill you marry me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dReally...I still couldn't wrap my head around this simple yet full-of-implications question.Dowd Campbell.The heir to a minor lord of a remote region with not the slightest recognition. A freshman-nobody at the Academy. And a bottom dwelling, unrecognized extra of this world.And such a person now is...He's being proposed to by a woman who would destroy the world within a few years.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The lord and his family are actually just friendly neighbors.Naturally, the slightest accident or event would cause a big uproar, as if the world had been overturned.Namely.The Lord\u2019s son entering the Imperial Academy. A rare spectacle of the residents of the territory collectively crying, as if they're being abandoned.\u201cYou\u2019re leaving at last, Dwod.\u201d\u201cYes, Father.\u201dBaron Armin Campbell, a warm and kind middle-aged man, hugged me while wiping away his welling tears.\u201cYou are the pride of our territory. Please take care of yourself and graduate safely.\u201d\u201cOf course, don't worry.\u201dI separated from Father with a confident smile.He may look like this, but he's built with pure hard muscle.Dairy farming and farming in general are hard jobs, so even if you don\u2019t specifically train your body, you'll be toned.\u201cHowever, never get into a fight. The Imperial Academy is a place where high-ranking children from all over the empire gather. It\u2019s best for small barons like us to be as inconspicuous as possible\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, really.\u201dDoubling the confidence level in my smile, I cut off Nagging Season 1823718029837.Well, his worries were not unfounded considering the main story of Savior Rising.An aristocratic family with weak prestige would be easily swept up in all sorts of power struggles between the powerful and eccentric high-ranking nobles.Fortunately, I also don't have the slightest intention of violating my father\u2019s advice.< Status Info >\u300cDowd Campbell\u300dStrength: FAgility: FEndurance: FLuck: FPower: F< Skill Info >[ No Skill in Possession ]< Mastery Info >[ No Specialization Skill in Possession ]< Special Gift >[ Unawakened ]\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was an eye watering, neat Status Window.However, all my stats are F, an unprecedented trash start that I've never once encountered out of all the playtime I\u2019ve put into Sera.\u2018This is dangerous\u2026\u2019With a wry smile, I turned my gaze to the small window next to the main page.[ Main Quest ][ Enter the Academy and be assigned a class! ]This is something I often saw in the game, so it's nice seeing it here. But the existence of a system page called the \u2018Quest Window\u2019 was a problem itself.The fact that a main quest exists means that there are scenarios to overcome. This also means that the Academy that I'm about to enter will become a pandemonium, a breeding ground for different types of plots and conspiracies.\u2018I can\u2019t just skip the main quest\u2026\u2019Considering the game's system and mechanics, the moment you don\u2019t do it, it will be \u2018game over\u2019.I don\u2019t think that would ever do anything good for me.At the very least, something akin to death awaits me.\u2018But it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to complete the quest myself.\u2019In the first place, my motto was, \u2018Never do anything that hinders survival\u2019.I have no idea why I\u2019m here, but one thing is certain. I must live to see the happy ending.So getting involved in the main story with these garbage stats would simply get me deleted in one breath.Although this guy does have an unawakened special gift, it's hard expecting anything from it.I don't even have a clue on how to awaken it.\u2018All I know is that it would automatically do so when the character completed a special action\u2026\u2019I don\u2019t know about player characters, but there\u2019s definitely no way I would know the gift conditions for an extra character like this.So what\u2019s the best course of action I can take in this situation?Faithfully fulfilling my role as an extra.Don't stand out, don\u2019t show off and keep low-key.Just let the main character take care of everything.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Father!\u201dUh. Now that I think about it, the advice that my father gave couldn't sound any wiser.Is that really nagging if that's the case?\u201cI will do my best to become invisible at the Academy!\u201d\u201c\u2026Uh, no, there's no need to go that far\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll never have the vain ambition of raising the territory's honor!\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, it\u2019s true that I don\u2019t particularly want that, but\u2026\u201dAfter such exchanges, I finally departed from the estate.Though, unlike the beginning, the territory residents' and my parents' expressions were a little strange seeing me off. Anyways, what's good is good.And thus, my low-key Academy Life as an extra is about to begin!\u25cfI really thought of that.I was envisioning a truly hopeful future.Ah, those dream-filled days.\u201cDo you need a doctor? You don\u2019t look so good.\u201d\u201cNo, I'm okay, thank you.\u201dActually, no, I'm not okay.As someone who decided to commit to being an extra, meeting the person in front of me was horrifically unfortunate.\u201c\u2026\u201dI glanced at the other person impassively reading the newspaper and sipping tea.Elnore Elinalise La Tristan.The most likely candidate for the Final Boss.\u2018How did I end up traveling with someone like this?\u2019Thinking so, I couldn't help but let out an inward sigh.The train bound for Elfante Imperial Academy has two-person rooms.You have no choice since you can't choose which person you want to share the room with, it's completely random. It's just that if the person you're with was this terrifying, it's probably okay to lament.This type of luck was astonishingly horrendous.\u2018Why would a Duke\u2019s Daughter get a cheap compartment that the countryside Barons use anyway?\u2019As I was thinking about that, an answer suddenly came from the other side.Her gaze was still fixed on the newspaper.\u201cDuke Tristan cares a lot about public image. He focuses on creating a friendly image rather than making us ride first class just because we're from a noble family.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you didn\u2019t make the stupid mistake of thinking out loud. Your expression is just funny.\u201dThe Student Council President laughed as she said one thing after another.\u201cThe thoughts of the people who ride in the same compartment as me are all the same. You were simply giving off a similar look to them.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201dIt seems like this wasn't a one time occurrence.Well, as Duke Tristan's daughter, she\u2019s a huge celebrity that's almost on par with the Royal Family. A lot of people must've felt pressured by her presence.\u201cRest assured, you won't be harmed just by being involved with me. I'm sorry for worrying you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Finally, she's arrogant who always sees others as beneath her.Those were the characteristics that I remember of Elnore.By the way, what is this delicately thoughtful look you're showing me right now?Regardless if it's her description or how she's portrayed, this was undeniably strange.\u201cDo you have any other questions? It doesn\u2019t seem like you're convinced.\u201d\u201cNo. It's just that you're surprisingly nice.\u201dHearing this, Elnore removed her gaze from the newspaper for the first time.Her eyes slightly narrowed.\u201cSurprising?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHave you heard anything bad about me? Have we met before?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s because I know you\u2019re one of the possible people who'll destroy the world.However, it was only after meeting the main character did her villainous transformation begin. It all stemmed from the inferiority complex to the main character, who was considered perfect in all aspects, and has a talent that far surpasses herself.Of course, you might wonder how the world will end just because of an inferiority complex, but the real problem is the \u2018curse\u2019 that this person has.\u2018Gray Devil.\u2019Thinking of Duke Tristan, and the name of the existence inside Elnore, I couldn't help but smile bitterlyIt's the worst of the \u2018devils\u2019, the King-Class villains. It's so bad, in fact, that it appears in the myth of creation.The moment that it's released, the world is practically over. And the trigger is the moment when Elnore\u2019s mental collapses.Throughout the story, Elnore constantly had friction against the main character, and when her mentality collapsed, the demon took over her body. After that\u2026It\u2019s the end of the world. Other than the main character fully growing, the destruction cannot be stopped even if the whole world banded together.\u201c\u2026\u201d\"I thought you had an explosive personality, turns out you don't,\" I basically said this towards someone like that.I must have gone crazy.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve just heard a lot about being strict.\u201dElnore stared at me for a while, then sighed. I wondered if my improvised excuse worked.\u201cYou're a strange man, aren't you?\u201d\u201cYes, that's what I often hear.\u201dI blurted with an awkward smile, before immediately looking out the window.I want to refrain from continuing this conversation further.Anyway, my goal was to just have the main character beat the main quest. There\u2019s nothing good about hanging out with people that'll often appear in the scenarios.My purpose is to lead a peaceful and quiet academy life, so let's do just that. Remain calm and enjoy the view outside.The spring scenery in full bloom was very picturesque. It almost feels like you can smell the fragrance of the flowers with your eyes.The new buds blooming, the stretching mountain and streams, the wide fields, and the huge boulder flying towards this window-\u201c\u2026\u201dWait, the last one... Fuck!\u201cStudent Council President.\u201d\u201cEum?\u201d\u201cExcuse me for a moment.\u201dRight after saying that, I dove into Elnore\u2019s arms.\u201c\u2026?!\u201dI saw that Elnore was greatly shaken.Even if it's this person, it seems that she still panics if someone suddenly rushed into their arms.Fortunately or unfortunately, the situation continued without pause, leaving no time for explanations.-!-!!-!!!!!!!A house-sized boulder flew towards our compartment, tearing most of it off.Naturally, suddenly being hit with a huge amount of force, the train shook greatly. Subsequently, the train body deviated from the track and tilted over.-!-!!!-!!!!!!!!!!!A few tumultuous turns was next in line as the entire train rolled over.There were screams everywhere, but even that was drowned out by the roar that followed.It's probably the sound of the entire train being thrown to the ground.And throughout all of this, Elnore and I are fine.It\u2019s not because I\u2019m lucky, but because of the blue shield around Elnore right now.An automatic saint shield.\u2018I survived knowing that this person always had this\u2026\u2019Drenched in cold sweat, I let out a sigh of relief.If I got directly hit by that thing without any protection, I would'nt have lived. Not with my abilities.\u201c\u2026You, are you okay?\u201d\u201cYes? Ah yes. I'm okay.\u201d\u201cThen, can you move? It\u2019s a bit heavy.\u201dIt\u2019s only after Elnore said this in an emotionless voice from below that I realized that I\u2019m pressing her under my whole body.\u201c\u2026\u201dI quickly got up from this embarrassing position. After a while, the Student Council President also stood up.She looked down at the ground, tidying up her messy hair and uniform. Perhaps it's because of the ambiguous mood, but her nape and face were slightly red.Um, what now?Should I apologize first?\u201cI'm sorry-\u201c\u201cIt's alright, you were just trying to save me.\u201dWhat?\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had such radical contact with a man, but thank you. I know your intentions, so there is no need to apologize.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDid she interpret it that way?I just rushed in knowing that she has a shield.It seems that from Elnore\u2019s point of view, I was protecting her from the impact.Well, she didn\u2019t know that I knew the existence of the shield in advance.As I was thinking about that, Elnore said another thing.\u201cYou, what\u2019s your name?\u201dWhat?This person, according to the setup, doesn't she only ask the name of someone she likes?I feel like if I answer something now, we'll be involved often in the future.\u201c\u2026You, what\u2019s your name?\u201dHowever, I can't just say, \u2018What for?\u2019 to someone in front staring directly at me.Rather, it's the worst option.\u201cI'm Dowd Campbell.\u201d\u201cDowd, Dowd, Campbell, Campbell.\u201dElnore closed her eyes and muttered my name a few times, then nodded.\u201cGo it, I won't forget it. I will definitely pay you back later.\u201dNo, you can just forget about it.Like can't we be as far away from each other as possible?As I was thinking that with an awkward smile, something suddenly appeared in front of me.<System Message>[ You have gained the villain's favor! ][ Satisfied Special Gift awakening conditions! ][ Obtained the skills \u2018Desperation\u2019 and \u2018Fatal Charm\u2019! ]\u2026What the fuck?*T/N: Skill names are subject to change (like if I think something sounds cooler or more appropriate according to what the skill does)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was wearing shabby, worn out sportswear and had a plain longsword on her waist.However, there is this bizarre \u2018presence\u2019 that couldn't be hidden even with this plain impression.She exuded ungodly amounts of charisma that it feels like I'll get overwhelmed just by facing her.I turned my gaze and looked at her name tag which said, [Elijah Krisanax].I know her.No, it's impossible to not know someone who's on par with Elnore.\u201cUm, hello?\u201dThe greatest genius in the world.The protagonist of the world of \u2018Savior Rising\u2019, who will later grow into the hero, greeted me with an awkward smile.\u201c\u2026\u201dThis, isn\u2019t this terrible?Although the main character\u2019s stats at the start are not very high, this same person would later destroy a mountain range with a single strike, whether it\u2019s a sword or magic. Even now, she is a real budding talent.Even before entering the academy, she joined the knights and monster subjugations. She's even conquering dungeons by herself. She had accomplished numerous feats that's unbelievable for a student.This can be seen from the fact that she was specifically avoided among the freshmen, who were full of talent. Of all the new students, she's probably the most famous.It is no exaggeration to say that the current gap in combat power between me and her is catastrophic. I could really die\u2026\u201c\u2026?\u201dWait a minute.I dug a little deeper into my thoughts.I recalled the \u2018abilities\u2019 I have, the \u2018information\u2019 about the other person and my immediate \u2018goal\u2019.Finally, I came to a conclusion.\u201c\u2026Hello.\u201dI shook the shy girl's hand and thought to myself.This.Maybe this isn't a crisis, but an opportunity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Count Creitan has just arrived...!\u201d\u201cMarquis Galanti is here...!\u201dAnd as the cherry on top was these types of news, which were only fueling her anger.Elfante's entrance ceremony was not just an 'academy event'. It's also a gathering of the Empire's key figures looking to build relations.To think that she's unable to keep even the most basic thing like time commitment in front of such people...!As Beatrix tried to douse her rage, someone opened the door of the Student Council room.It was a blood-soaked Elnore.\u201c...\u201d\u201c...\u201dEveryone, even Beatrix, was silent. Meanwhile, Elnore walked into the room and put her sword down on the desk with a sigh.Eventually, one of the students couldn't hold it any longer and hiccupped at the bloody sight.\"Something wrong?\"It's only then did Elnore notice the strange silence.Beatrix massaged her throbbing temple and replied.\u201cI have so many questions, but I'll sum it up in one, so please answer me straight. What have you been doing?\u201d\u201cJust some clean up.\u201dHaving been together for 10 years, Beatrix instantly knew that this was something that shouldn't be talked about in public. She got it so fast, in fact, that she deserved praise.\u201c...I have to apologize, but the President and I will take care of things from here. I'd like to ask everyone to leave.\u201dBeatrix kindly sent off the other students with a bright smile. However, as soon as the last one left, her expression instantly darkened into a devil's.\u201cWhat did you do this time?\u201d\u201cNothing, didn't I say that I just did some clean up?\"\u201cIf no one is dead, then I'll agree with you.\u201d\u201cIts not that many, only around 12 people?\u201d\u201c...\u201dBarely keeping her senses after taking some deep breaths, Beatrix continued with a trembling voice to the still expressionless Elnore.\u201cFor what reason are you killing this time?\u201d\u201cYou're making me sound like a crazed whimsical murderer.\u201dElnore calmly replied as she casually wiped off the blood from her sword.\u201cThey were assassins trying to murder me. They dropped a rock on the train on the way to the academy and made it seem like an accident. I took care of them since I'm close by.\u201dShe spoke as natural as the sun rising in the sky.\"You can just leave it up to the academy...!\"\u201cIsn\u2019t that cumbersome?\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cWith someone behind them, there's no resolving this legally. It'll obviously be annoying in the future, so I nipped the buds in advance.\u201d\u201c...\u201dBeatrix clenched her sweaty palms.Leaving aside how Elnore managed to find the guys behind this in less than a day, they were clearly the best among the pros. After all, no one in power that could evade the law would just hire some random thugs.And the fact that she killed all 12 people of such caliber alone...It's amazing how she could express such things calmly.Like it's a very natural thing and it wasn't strange to kill as long as they're counted as her 'enemy'.It's almost as if the dormant evil within her would awaken whenever there's an opportunity.\u201cOr did you want me to be 'just and perfect'? That despite having my life threatened, I'll benevolently spare the culprits?\u201dBeatrix felt her mouth dry.Because she could see the utter disgust in Elnore's eyes when she asked this.Beatrix knew better than anyone else that this was Elnore's 'Royal Ire'.\u201cWell, that's it. You won't 'force' me to do that.\u201dFortunately, Elnore withdrew her gaze after polishing her sword.Freed from the pressure, Beatrix breathed sigh of relief as she wiped the sweat off her forehead.This wasn't even supposed to be the topic, there's something more urgent right now.\u201cElnore.\u201d\"Eung?\"\u201cEverything's good and all, but you'll be late if you don\u2019t change and get ready. Shouldn't you hurry up if you don't want to die?\"\u201c...\u201dSaying this sentence to someone, who just killed 12 professional assassins, requires the highest level of courage.However, the determination in Beatrix's eyes was firm.Elnore deeply sighed deeply with a hint of annoyance.\u201c\u2026I get it, I get it. I hope the sparring is fun at least. If I have to face those snakes, shouldn't I have fun at least?\u201d\u201cYou won't have to worry about that.\u201dHaving said that, Beatrix rummaged through the information in her head.\u201cIf you go now, you'll catch a freshman who's famed to be a prodigy. The match is Elijah Krisanax vs. Dowd... Dowd... what was it?\u201d\u201cDowd Campbell?\u201dBeatrix's eyes widened.\"Yes, but how did you remember? That guy has nothing going for him.\u201dAfter a bit of silence, Elnore smirked.\u201cHe\u2019s an odd man.\u201d\u201cOdd?\u201d\"Yes.\"Otherwise, there's no way she'd say something like this from the get go.As if she knew the darkness within her, Elnore rose from her seat with a smile.\u201cLet\u2019s go, we'll be late if we don't hurry.\"\"...Your attitude is a little different from before?

Losing after a hard-fought battle was the best I could hope for.Right now, I should focus on 'not dying'.

If someone were to breath a little too heavily, it would probably be heard by everyone due to the extreme lack of sound.It felt like everyone's souls had left their bodies.\u201cVictory, Dowd Campbell.\u201dAt the same time the dumbfounded referee announced the results...\"...What was that?!\"\u201cWhat did that guy do?!\u201dA deafening uproar erupted from every direction.Who is Dowd Campbell? What the hell is going on in Baron Campbell's territory? No, this is not the time for this, gathering information is the priority.Amidst the chaotic world around me, I simply stood in solitude while staring blankly at the sky.I.An F allstat.A bottom dwelling freshman with only two unknown skills under his belt.Right now, on the first day of admission to the academy.The literal start of my academy life... I somehow defeated the main character with one punch.\u201c\u2026Ah, f_ck.\u201dHow do I explain this?\u25cfThe Elfante Imperial Academy is one of the best educational institutions in the continent. The only places that could compete with it are, at most, the Holy Land's [Great Temple] or the Tribal Union's [Fighting Furnace].With an institution like that, the faculty were naturally exceptional.\u201c...\u201d\u201c...\u201dHowever, the current situation was arguably completely outside of everyone's expectations.And even such people couldn't hide their surprise.In a magic crystal embedded in the center of the table, a video of Elijah Krisanax getting KO'd in one punch was being played repeatedly.\u201cThis case.\u201dThe Knights headmaster said in a heavy tone.\u201cThis student named Dowd looks like an excellent con artist.\u201d\"... Isn't your evaluation too harsh, Conrad?\"\u201cIt just doesn't make any sense.\u201dA middle-aged man with a cross-shaped scar on his face shook his head and replied to the headmaster's smiley words.\u201cAnyone with some insight would have noticed this as soon as they saw him. This Dowd Campbell had nothing going for him before the start of the spar. No fighting capabilities nor skills. But...\"He then manipulated the video to the moment when Elijah got hit.\u201cFor this one blow, it is unmistakably 'real'.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean 'real'?\u201d\u201cI dare say no human in this academy can survive a direct hit from that. At least not me.\u201dWith those words, the silence in the room unironically became even more deafening.This was coming from an Imperial Guard, the pinnacle of all knights on the continent. Considering his background, there's no reason for him to flatter a mere student.Especially considering that the people present in this room were faculty only composed of the best talents on the continent.\u201cRegardless if it's some Illegal drug or unknown magic tool, there's a high chance that something was used to temporarily generate that strong firepower. I think everyone here has the same thoughts.\u201dBecause.If not, then the existence of this Dowd Campbell would become much more troublesome.\u201cThere's also other possibilities.\u201dHe paused for a moment, then smiled.It's as if it was a ridiculous thing for him to say.\u201cLet's say... He's a peerless genius! A terrifying monster that only a handful of people could compare.\u201dThis wasn't a strange thing to say.Simply put, not even one among ten thousand people believed that Dowd Campbell would win.After all, his opponent was 'her,' Elijah Krisanax. The next [Hero] candidate that the Imperial Family had been keeping an eye on.[T/N: \uc6a9\uc0ac could mean different things like warrior, knight or brave. But I'll use Hero since Elijah is the 'hero'/MC of the game]The Hero possesses combat skills that reached an unattainable level, an intellect comparable to the Gods, and an unwavering spirit that would never falter in any situation.Dowd Campbell had none of these talents. At least on paper, this man was truly on the level of an insect.\u201c...\u201dThe problem is, that catastrophic gap was closed in a mere punch!Done by an unknown existence with highly questionable 'talent'.However, if they're not a cheater, but an actual genuine talent then...'They'll become the eye of the storm.'An existence that would bring about a great upheaval.Conrad thoughtfully stroked his chin.\u201cHowever, we couldn't just acknowledge that student's victory. Marquis Kendride won't sit still.\u201dConrad nodded at the headmaster's words.The Kendride Family is one of the oldest and most prestigious family in the empire, famous for having a rough relationship with Duke Tristan.As an avid supporter of Elijah Krisanax, Marquis Kendride would definitely not want to compromise Elijah's 'marketability'.\u201c...\u201dConrad's expression hardened.Politics in a space that was clearly established for teaching?If you find a talented student, you should treat them accordingly.\u201cBut it would be a big loss for the academy to abandon a student who clearly stands out. Anyway, whether he is a fraud or not will be revealed sooner or later. Let's wait and see.\u201dThe headmaster continued with a light smile, seemingly to have read Conrad's thoughts.Conrad's eyes widened.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of interesting freshmen this particular year. A few with strong personalities that need to be managed separately.\u201dAlthough the tone used was still light.\u201cIf this student is good enough for the headmaster to say that\u2026 then he must have a role to play. For them.\u201dIt was undoubtedly significant.\u25cfI've been thinking of ways to work out the aftermath of knocking out the main character.I'll need to solve this problem in the future.\u201c...\u201dNo, it's already a problem now.Currently, there are countless people clamoring outside my dorm for a chance to meet me.

How narrow-minded.\u201dHowever, despite grumbling so much, Elijah's head was still filled with Dowd Campbell.It's been a while since she'd met such an interesting person.Although there are rumors that the sparring was fraudulent and rigged. Elijah's intuition was tingling.The talent of the man who defeated her in one punch is real.Though, she's unsure of what method he used.'He's definitely got something, that man.'She could tell that he's more than what he seems on the surface.She was also the kind of person who gets restless about something if it's not answered.Thus, to draw a reasonable conclusion, she thought...What would be the best position to learn that talent, watch from the side and gradually find out what kind of person he is?That is by befriending him!There's no harm in getting close.'...But I don't know how to be friends with a man.'She grew up in an all-girls monastery. Since young, the existence of men was always unknown to her. There were few opportunities to even talk to the opposite sex, let alone make friends.However, she had no intention of giving up.'But that attitude...'No matter where and how she tried to, she couldn't get past him, as if he's the embodiment of an iron wall.It even made her embarrassed despite her thick skin.She had to tactically retreat for now...\u201cAyat.\u201dPerhaps too preoccupied with her thoughts, as she turned the corner at the end of the hallway, Elijah bumped into someone coming from the other side.\"Sorry, I wasn't careful.\"\"No, I...\"Elijah tried to reflexively respond. However her voice trailed off upon seeing who the other person was.\u201cAre you hurt?\u201dThe Student Council President, Elnore, asked while Elijah unconsciously grabbed her sword.However, she immediately despaired.'...I can't win. Never.'She inwardly groaned as she instantly gauged the gap between their strength.Although she currently has skills that are comparable to a regular knight, the other person was just built different.Regardless of where and how she stabs that person, she could only see herself dying in the end.'This is Duke Tristan's...'Elnore's worthy of being the daughter of a master swordsman, who is regarded as the peak of the continent.Achieving this level when she's only a few years older than Elijah was a great feat.She let go of her sword and replied.\"...I'm all right.\"Biting her lip, Elijah held down her anger while Elnore only slightly nodded.Such a response was another thing that added to Elijah's emotions.Elnore should've seen Elijah hold her sword, yet she didn't even budge.As if it wasn't something noteworthy.\u201c...\u201dTo this person, Elijah simply mean just that.An irrelevant existence.And this was from Elnore, a member of the family that had turned Elijah's whole life upside down.At this instant, hot rage surged in Elijah, however she forcefully suppressed it from overflowing.There was no point in revealing that right now. She can't win even if she attacks with a sword.\u201cHere.\u201dElijah managed to put on a fake smile as she picked up what Elnore had dropped when bumping into her.It was an envelope. Looking at it, you can see the words 'Dear Dowd Campbell' that were cutely written.'Why would this person pop up here?'Elijah kindly continued.\"Are you going to where this person is?\"\"I am.\"\u201cIf you turn right here, you will find the place you're looking for.\u201dAfter saying those words, Elijah passed the envelope to Elnore and hurriedly left.Anyway, her mood wasn't the brightest for running into this person.\"Wait a moment.\"Elnore suddenly called her.\"How do you know where Dowd Campbell's room is?\"\u201c...?\u201dShe doesn't know why Elnore's asking that, but she'll have to answer first.\u201cWe just met up.\u201dAs soon as she heard those words, Elnore's hostility suddenly soared.It wouldn't be strange if she saw me as an enemy to kill.'...Enemy? Kill?'Why?No, like really, why?Her expression didn't change even when someone attempted to draw a sword at her. So why was she so angry just because I was with that guy?As Elijah was in a state of confusion, Elnore asked her another question.\u201cFor what purpose?\u201dThe temperature of her voice has significantly gotten colder than before.It really feels like she'll attack if I do anything sudden.\u201cUh, just to make friends as fellow freshmen...?\u201dElnore's eyes narrowed.It was evident that she did not like that.\u201cDating between new students is prohibited.\u201d\"...Pardon?\"What the hell is she talking about all of a sudden?\"Anyway, it's forbidden.\"\u201cIs there such a school rule\u2026?\u201d\u201cI just made it.\u201d\u201c...\u201dYes, in principle, the Student Council President has that right.However, it wasn't meant to be abused in this way.\u201cSo, from now on, you cannot visit Dowd Campbell's room.\u201d\u201cUm, what relationship does the Student Council President have with that person?\u201dElnore fell silent at her words.The silence was so long it made Elijah feel awkward despite the one asking the question.\u201c... There's nothing between us.\u201dIt was a very difficult answer.It also felt like it had numerous complaints mixed in. As if she hated having that kind of relationship status.\u201cAlright then, please keep in mind what I just told you.\u201dElijah's face grew blank as she watched Elnore leave.\u201cWhat the hell?\u201dHow can you do this when you're not in any relationship with that person?Elijah couldn't understand why someone as high as the Duke's daughter would write a man's name in large fonts on the outside of a letter envelope and deliver it.I heard that Dowd Campbell came from an unremarkable baron family. What businesses does she have from someone like that.-I quite like her.-Facade. I know. In fact, I have a rough idea of her actions.Then, Elijah suddenly remembered these words.These were what Dowd Campbell had said the other day.He spoke as if he already knew the Student Council President.\u201cHmm.\u201dIt was like a eureka moment.The puzzle pieces seem to fit together.The Student Council President says she has nothing to do with the man but has. The same man whose identity is still shrouded in mystery...'There is something here...!'These two are clearly hiding something.Digging deeper into this might lead to some complicated backstory.There could be a big secret about Duke Tristan!Elijah's intuition was screaming.\"Great.

It even had me thinking if she's capable of displaying emotions.\u201cThen do we just have to wait here?\u201dA dwarven student anxiously asked.

We don't know what's going to happen, so I think we should move to a more favorable terrain.\u201dAt this moment, the expressions of the other students slowly changed.However, they weren't scared. Rather, they're preparing themselves for what's about to come.Seeing that everyone quickly adapted to the situation, it was clear that they were top tier students.And if you look closely at their members, they're definitely not just random no-names.Warrior Luca, Mage Falco, Healer Trisha, Marksman Grid. Then you add Elijah, another warrior and also the leader.'The original Hero Party.'Considering the story progress, this is their first meeting.They showed great chemistry and teamwork in the exam and ran as a party all the way through.In other words, all the people here are part of the story except me.\u201c...\u201dWell, then.I'll just proceed with my plans.\u201cThe central hall seems to be the best option.\u201dWhen I opened my mouth, all eyes focused on me.Regardless, I continued to point to the map of the building next to me.\u201cThere's various equipment and first-aid supplies inside, and there is a lot of space. It will be much better than a corridor prone to surprise attacks. \u201dEveryone seriously nodded. Probably because it was the most sensible choice. So far, everyone seemed convinced.The problem was this.\u201cAnd I will go here.\u201dWhen I pointed to a completely different place on the map, silence covered the surroundings.The silence was so heavy that it took a long while for someone to ask a question in an absurd voice.\u201c...

I don't want to.Why?Because I'm going alone.\u201c...\u201dAnd no, I didn't forget that the mission was to protect Elnore.However, let's think for a moment here. Common sense, if you will.'Would that woman need protection?'She's the Final Boss that could defeat the Hero Party, including the main character, alone.Why should I risk my allstat F @ss?Can't I just leave them to the central hall and attract the assassin's aggro, and hide until the situation is over?\u201cI can't reveal it now, but it's important.

As expected, does credibility come from performance?The goal is to hide until the event is over. In the first place, Elnore is the assassins' target. There is a high probability that they wouldn't even care about me.I'll just quietly enjoy myself somewhere, like pass some time-\u201cWait, student!\u201d-Well, that's not happening now.It seems that I, indeed, have bad luck.Thinking inwardly, I looked at where the voice was from.A middle-aged man rushed towards me.\u201cYou're really alive...!\u201dSoon, he arrived in front of me.On his chest was a faculty nameplate.

It was foolish of him to be deceived so easily without having any doubt.Of course, even a quick-witted person would easily fall for Hasmed's performance. So you really can't blame the kid.Crescent Moon's Hasmed.The head of this assassination squad.He was a famous face-changing assassin, known for perfectly copying his victim's identities.And his next target was this student.'If I'm a fellow student, even that Tristan girl won't expect it.'He's heard that an earlier team was already caught and wiped out by that devilish woman.However, even such a human being should have a lowered guard towards a student.Even now, Hasmed disguising himself as a faculty has worked flawlessly against this student.\u201cSo, this is the facility room.\u201dHearing this, Hasmed insidiously smiled on the inside.Making this student 'guide' him was all for evaluating their skill.A professional assassin, such as him, can easily figure out a person's level just by observing their movements.This guy was a total noob.KiIIing him is the same as butchering chickens.'Yosh, let's seize this guy's body and kill Princess Tristan.'Info says that Princess Tristan and the other students are gathered at the central hall.Once they're distracted by his subordinates, it would be very easy to sneak in as this guy.\"Is that so?\"Hasmed smiled and pulled something out.\u201cYou've worked hard. I'll give you a reward.\u201dHe lifted a blade and said in a dreary tone.Of course, the said reward was death.At this point, the victims usually ask questions, then deny the situation, and finally panic and fear.He enjoys such reactions the most-\u201cAh, thank god, it's Hasmed. \u201d\u201c...\u201dHowever, the student in front of him just thanked god...Obviously, this guy wasn't asking questions nor was he panicked, let alone scared.On the contrary, he's wiping his forehead with a sigh of relief.\u201cIt could have been dangerous if it was a half-strong guy, lucky~.\u201d\u201c...

He steals the identity of his victim.\u201dHearing those words, Elnore, who had been silent for a while, opened her mouth.\u201cThat assassin, is he here with you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAnswer the question, is he in this building right now?\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t tell you that-\u201cThe assassin suddenly stopped midway.Anyone who realizes that one of their arms has been slashed by a sword will probably do so.It was none other than Elnore, who had drawn her sword in an instant.\u201cA, aaaak-!\u201dThe assassin screamed in pain as his blood sprayed everywhere. However, Elnore did not even think about wiping the splattered blood off her face and just grabbed the assassin by the collar.Her red eyes shone ferociously in the dim surroundings.\u201cIs that assassin here?\u201d\u201cA, aaaaak-!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t answer, I\u2019ll cut off the other side too.\u201d\u201cY, yes! He's here!\u201dUpon hearing that, Elnore threw the screaming assassin to the ground.She was stunned for a bit before running out, leaving the other students who remained still.\u201cWait! What the heII is this madness!\u201dBreaking an arm and \u2018threats\u2019 were not the same as pulling out a real sword and slashing a body part off!Elnore's personality seemed to have turned a 180\u00b0 as soon as she heard that there was an assassin named Hasmed in the building.Elnore sighed and answered Elijah, who had quickly caught up.\u201cBecause I needed an answer urgently. Lives are on the line and there's medical equipment nearby.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThat said, who would do such a thing without hesitation?\u201cWhat was that for\u2026!\u201d\u201cThey said the assassin kills and steals his victims identity. Who do you think would be the easiest to target in this building right now?\u201dElijah was speechless.Come to think of it, there was one.One person who dared to separate from the group saying it was \u2018necessary\u2019.\u201c\u2026No way.\u201dElijah said firmly.\u201cDid he use himself as bait to lure the strongest opponent there?\u201dLogically speaking, this is just all speculation.You can't just know that such an assassin is coming in the first place. And even if you did, why would you risk your own life to do such a dangerous thing--I, quite like that person.\u201c\u2026\u201d-It's possible.Now, it was clear that this assassination attempt was aimed at Princess Tristan.And it was evident that Elnore agrees, seeing that she kept her mouth shut without answering.\u201cI\u2019ll have to go there and check.\u201d\u201cWhy are you doing this? What is the relationship between you two\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you say that there's nothing between you two?\u201dElnore said.\u201cAt least as far as I know.\u201dBut, unlike before.She wasn't even sure of herself now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he's unable to deal with a situation at this level, then he doesn't deserve such a reputation.Hence, when he saw the translucent blue 'membrane' on his arm, he couldn't help but be stunned.\u2018The Guardian's Soul\u2026!\u2019It's a suppressive defensive barrier and has the effect of greatly reducing the power of the weapon wielded by the attacker within the specified range.Although it is said to appear in some buildings, both the exact time and place when it happens is random.But why did this appear here?As Hasmed was thinking that, the student in front began to approach him with the stick.\u2018Fool!\u2019Hasmed snorted.Even with a weapon-disabling barrier, a trained assassin themself is a weapon. Further, Hasmed ranks top among such assassins.What can a kid do with a stick? Like what could that weak ass body without a hint of combat skill do?At least, this was what Hasmed thought.Until... The first blow.-!-!!A storm-like series of attacks raged in an instant.In the blink of an eye, Hasmed was screaming. His vital had been hit and couldn't hold in the scream.However, the psychological shock was hitting him more than the physical pain.\u2018I can\u2019t follow his moves\u2026!\u2019As a top rank assassin, there are only a few sword styles in the continent that he can't identify.Not to mention, if it was wielded by a swordsman who could exert this much power with an object that was not even a sword to begin with!\u2018Tristan Style Swordsmanship!\u2019Why is it that he couldn\u2019t read the skills of a guy who could execute such a technique?\u2018\u2026!\u2019It was then that epiphany dawned on him.If what he's thinking is right...\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have messed with this guy from the start\u2026!\u2019Hasmed thought as he helplessly fell to the ground.\u25cf[ Successfully used Attribute! ][ Attribute: Tristan Style Swordsmanship Proficiency Increased. ]\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat's this?Why is it so strong?I look at the fallen Hasmed in confusion.To be honest, I didn't expect much from the Tristan Style Swordsmanship because what I have is only the basic version. It was out of my expectations that I could take down someone like Hasmed in just a couple of swings.After all, wasn't he still a decent mid-boss during the main quest?That\u2019s because he\u2019s a level assassin who can work to some extent just by mentioning his name in the back world.\u2018\u2026How strong will this be if I complete it?\u2019I knew that this would be strong considering it\u2019s the swordsmanship used by the Final Boss. But I didn\u2019t expect it to be this strong.In the first place, my plan was to buy time and dip out for help.\u201c\u2026Ha. I see. It was a trap from the beginning.\u201dI didn't know what to say hearing this from the guy collapsed in front of me.What are you talking about?\u201cI don\u2019t know how, but you definitely knew that the Guardian\u2019s Soul would appear. That must have been the reason why you chose the stick as your weapon from the beginning.\u201dThat\u2019s just the game's mechanics.Fighting with weapons is impossible at \u2018save points\u2019 that exist in all buildings. That\u2019s why I brought this guy here.\u201cAnd in order to use that method, you lured me in by hiding your skills from the beginning, didn't you? That\u2019s why you purposely broke away from the group. To keep me away from Princess Tristan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNot really.Actually, I was going to run away after distracting you a bit.[ Skill: Fatal Charm has been activated! ][ The Villain is in awe of your elaborate plans! ][ Rewards are added to the Gift tab! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat elaborate plan?Is running away and crying for help an elaborate plan now?Where has all the subtlety of the world gone?\u201cBastard, who are you?

Why?\u201dAs if my words were really that shocking, Hasmed's eyes widened.I have no intention of murder.\u2018In the first place\u2026\u2019He is a member of the criminal organization, \u2018Vagabond\u2019, that is a key player in the third chapter in the scenario.If I touch him carelessly, the Vagabond will obviously come for me.However.\u2018I can't just say this.\u2019So, I need to come up with a reasonable excuse.What would be the best\u2026Ah, yes.\u201cSpread the word to not approach Princess Tristan. Even an assassin like you almost died trying.\u201dI don\u2019t know who this guy\u2019s boss is, but given that this happened during an academy event, there\u2019s a good chance they're no ordinary lunatic.Even with this failure, there is a high chance that they'll try again and again, ultimately stacking Elnore\u2019s \u2018Corruption\u2019.Gradually increasing the odds of the Gray Devil being unleashed.Hence, it's best to cut off any kind of attempt at their source.Hasmed is a well-known assassin in his own right. Shouldn't something like this deter others to take on the assassination request?\u201c\u2026\u201dHasmed\u2019s expression turned strange.\u201cWhat are you going to do if I don\u2019t keep my promise? If you let me go, we might aim for Princess Tristan again?\u201dActually, I don\u2019t think so.Knowing the \u2018Vagabonds\u2019 in the original work, he definitely won't.

Not to mention that it was during an official event.So much so that there's an official letter ordering to find the ringleader in just less than a day after the incident.The problem was that if one were to look at the route and time the assassins infiltrated, it was clear that there was an 'insider' helping them.This fact is probably a big part of why the president was so angry.Beatrix slightly lifted her head, then said with narrowed eyes.\u201cStill, all of you who were present will receive commendations for subduing that many armed personnel without a single casualty.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dBeatrix\u2019s expression slightly distorted hearing the soulless reply.\u201c\u2026The problem is that guy, Dowd Campbell. He\u2019s missing from the list of people to receive a commendation. I don't know why and there\u2019s no reason for him to be excluded. I think he's deliberately trying to be low-key.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cThe academic team is definitely working on something. It seems like they're preparing something big, with that guy as the center.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cI'mma hit you if you answer like that one more time.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dA sitting Elnore was blankly staring at the ceiling, as she casually caught the ink bottle flying towards her.Seeing her do that without even turning her head was deserving of her title of Princess Tristan, however that didn\u2019t make Beatrix less angry.\u201cWhat's wrong with you?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou've been like that the whole day. Where is your mind wandering off to?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPeople coming after you is nothing new, but this time feels a little different. I don\u2019t know who, but seeing how they openly committed two assassination attempts in a short period of time shows that they're very determined.\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201d\u201cI guess so\u2014 It\u2019s not a one and done thing, s\u2020upid. Do you think that someone stubborn would give up just because they failed this time? Are you sure they're not going to try again?\u201dElnore, who was looking at Beatrix, turned her gaze back to the ceiling.Beatrix could only let out a heated sigh.\u201c\u2026I do not know. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, I won\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t tell me either.\u201d\u201cBeatrix.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI think I care about someone.\u201dIt was commendable enough that Beatrix hadn\u2019t toppled over her desk.Anyone who knew what kind of person Elnore was would have probably reacted the same way.\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI said I think I care about someone.\u201dDid Beatrix heard it wrong?No, she doesn't think so.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was no answer, but somehow it felt like Elnore stared at the ceiling more intensely. As if she's hiding her shame.Seeing that the tips of Elnore's ears were slightly red, Beatrix almost felt cosmic fear.This woman was acting like an adolescent girl?A stone face whose expression doesn't change while slicing through people?\u201c\u2026Who is it?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you just talk about him?\u201dShe was so embarrassed, she couldn't even say it directly and had to do it in a roundabout way.\u201cDowd Campbell?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, wait a minute.\u201dFeeling an explosive headache, Beatrix grabbed her head and sank back onto the desk.Come to think of it, it felt like her attitude changed a bit after the sparring with the next Hero candidate.That was this, wasn\u2019t it?Eung. That's it.\u201cYou like him?\u201d\u201c\u2026I haven\u2019t said that yet.\u201dOh girl!\u201cYet?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElnore firmly shut her mouth. The tips of her ears got a bit redder.At that sight, Beatrix's mouth blankly opened again, feeling the headache getting worse.\u201cYou know how big of a storm this will bring, don't you?\u201dPrincess Tristan was in a position where her every single move is used as a story.That's probably because the prestige of the Tristan Family was so much greater than that of Elnore as an individual. Regardless, when such a person is in a relationship, it would likely be consumed with gossip.Of course, there is no particular problem with gossip, but there is one person who will not be pleased with it.\u201cIf Archduke Tristan finds out\u2014\u201dHowever, Beatrix was forced to shut her mouth.As soon as she said that, it felt like the temperature in the entire room had gone down several degrees.\u201c\u2026Yes, that old man would be displeased.\u201dElnore replied in a frosty voice.This wasn't the attitude you'd expect from a daughter to her father, but Beatrix didn\u2019t put too much thought to it.He didn't even contact his daughter after two assassination attempts.You don\u2019t have to ask to know what the relationship between the two is like.So, she decided to change topics.\u201cThis situation is kind of\u2026 weird. How did he seduce you-\u201c\u201cI didn't get seduced.\u201dBeatrix laughed at the sight of a disgruntled Elnore twirling the ends of her hair.It's probably like that since she wouldn\u2019t care about what others had to say.\u201cAnyway, if he had been kind to you in any way, you\u2019re usually the first to question why.\u201dThe environment molds a person.Sadly, Princess Tristan was in an environment where it's a must to assume that there's some intention behind everything rather than trusting people\u2019s pure kindness.But now, strangely enough, this woman was trusting this man.As if something had compelled her into it.\u201cIt seems so.\u201dConsidering her usual tendency, it was unprecedented for someone to approach and impact her that quickly and greatly.Elnore should be aware of this too.\u201cThen why don\u2019t we test it out?\u201d\u201cWhat test?\u201d\u201cWe're just going to take a closer look.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you talking about?\u201dSeeing Elnore smile instead of answering, gave Beatrix goose bumps.She felt a sense of foreboding.At least when this woman had this look, things wouldn't remain quiet.\u201cHey, what are you talking about?\u201d\u201cLet's go get something to eat.

That is to say, class assignment should have gone back to normal.In fact, the main character\u2019s party, including Elijah, took the test after the accident and were assigned to a \u2018special class\u2019.Why can't I have that streamline process? Why am I the only odd one out?\u201c\u2026I don't know.\u201dI muttered as I kept the letter away.There's no point in focusing on things without an answer.Instead of that, this...< System Message>[ Confirmed completion of class assignment after admission. ][ The first main quest has been completed. ][ Updating additional information! ]The first main quest I received was \u2018Complete the Class Assignment after Admission\u2019.Since the system gave a prompt, the requirements have been met.But this was a problem.[ Main Quest ][ Successfully solve the incident that will happen at the freshmen welcome party! ] [ D-3 ][ Reward: Exclusive Equipment Material ]The freshmen welcome party was an event marking the beginning of Sera\u2019s \u2018Quarter\u2019.To be precise, it\u2019s about choosing which character path the main character would take.Their would-be \u2018profession\u2019 is determined on what they'll take interest in.Ranged marksman, melee warrior, support priest or wide-area mage\u2026 You can say that it's the staple.Maybe giving me materials for \u2018Exclusive Equipment\u2019 was a part of that.Exclusive Equipment is equipment that can be developed by specializing in a field.Once fostered to completion, its power would be overwhelming.

However Elfante\u2019s history is deep, and it contains mountains of unique relics. Among them are things that only players who have played the game know the value of.There\u2019s only one thing I\u2019m aiming for.\u2018Divine's Ultima.\u2019It is an early survival item that brings the strongest impact in Sera if properly used.It's originally an item that belongs to the second chapter boss, \u2018Yuria Greyhounder\u2019.She was nicknamed as the \u2018Crazed Swordsman\u2019, a crazy bi\u2020ch who slices up anyone who comes within a certain distance.\u201c\u2026\u201dI'm actually worried that snatching such an item from an important person in advance would bring heavy implications.However, I have no choice if I want to prepare for the event in 3 days.None of the shi\u2020 in this world is my fault, but why am I being so hard-pressed?In any case, Yuria is incredibly strong, hence why she's a chapter boss. But she can't\u00a0 cause problems if she's not able to grow.\u201cAlright then.\u201dLet's farm some items then head back.Nothing would go wrong, right?\u25cf5 minutes later.I was cursing myself for making such a statement.I looked at the black-haired girl who was silently swaying in front of me.

With this, I was able to evade many of the security in the academy.\u2018\u2026Having points is nice.\u2019Just by using only a few hundred points, I quickly infiltrated the supply room which normally take days of preparation. In terms of performance, it could compare to an Assassin's C Class Stealth skill.The only flaw it had is that it disappears after usage. Still, it\u2019s a big advantage to be able to access all kinds of items.Items that cost more than a few thousand points could even turn a disaster around.\u201cWhew\u2026\u201dExhaling, I climbed out of a window and jumped down in a half-exhausted state.The Haste Potion temporarily gave me some speed. However, my stamina is still hot F trash. Even a simple exercise like this was hard.\u2018I'm dying\u2026\u2019Thinking so, I rummaged through my pockets.I happen to have the right thing for a situation like this.\u25ce Rejuvenating Biscuits x2[ Item: Consumable ][ Price: 50pts ] x2[ Is your body tired? Recover your stamina with these biscuits! Peanut flavor, 10 pieces per bag! ][ Remaining Points: 2,000pts ]\u201c\u2026\u201dThe description had a weird advertising tone, but it is a legit product.I have been taking advantage of its effects.I feel my body getting energized as I munch down on the biscuits. At the same time, I scanned the piled up things around.What I was looking for was quickly found.\u2018Right.\u2019I could see a palm-sized incense burner, which was small for a ceremonial item. But that's why it stands out.\u201cEum.\u201dThe supply room has a bunch of items that are often not properly organized.With a huff, I pulled out the incense burner embedded in the bottom of the pile that had almost reached the ceiling.Divine's Ultima, a thousand-year-old incense burner said to contain ancient power.However, compared to such a grandiose description, it only had one simple function.It is, so to speak, a \u2018phone\u2019.Specifically, the receiver is quite\u2026 formidable.\u2018Secured the most important thing\u2026\u2019I turned my gaze to look for something extra to take.Originally, all kinds of rare items are needed to activate this, but where am I?This is the players' official rare item farm. It's not that difficult to obtain them here.I grabbed the necessary items one by one and put them in my arms.Powder made by grinding the horn of a unicorn for fuel, a phoenix feather to ignite it, a coral fan to control the flames\u2026However, I can't take too much, otherwise it'll be biting me in the future. Taking these few things I picked should be fine.\u201cOops.\u201dEngrossed in my selection, the things piled up on top collapsed. But it didn\u2019t really matter since it wasn't loud.\u201c\u2026?\u201dAt least, that's what I thought.Until a \u2018person\u2019 buried among the collapsing items appeared.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI unwittingly caught them who were descending directly towards me.I did so because I had a hunch that if I let them hit the floor, there would be a bigger commotion.However, as soon as I saw the person's face, I immediately regretted everything.\u201c\u2026\u201dA small girl is soundly sleeping, while clutching a chained sword.She looked like a kitten.But from my point of view, as soon as I confirmed her identity, goose bumps immediately ran through my body.Seriously, who could imagine that this peacefully sleeping little girl is a human butcher that has reaped lives numbering triple digits?\u201c\u2026Umm.\u201dAnd unfortunately for me, it seems that I woke her up.The little girl stretched herself in my arms.\u201cHaaa...ah\u2026?\u201dAnd as she stretched out her arms, her yawns gradually subsided, sensing something strange.Her yellow eyes stared blankly at the surroundings. And soon, our eyes meet.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLet\u2019s put her down...I held the girl with both hands and made her stand.For a few seconds, we were just silently staring into each other\u2019s eyes.Then finally.The girl realizes that she has been \u2018held\u2019 by a man she has never seen before.Her immediate lightning-like reaction was grabbing the handle of the sword she was clutching.[ A moment of danger has been detected. ][ Determined the situation as life-threatening. ][ Skill: Desperation raised to EX Class. ]Yep.I\u2019m f*cked.\u25cfThere are many reasons why a character is classified as evil in Sera, but one of the criteria for classification is \u2018Karma\u2019.To put it simply, it's the \u2018number of kills\u2019.Depending on how many people you killed, your affinity would lean more towards the bad side.In that context, one's Karma could easily get corrupted.Hence the devil, a key villain throughout the entire scenario, usually approaches people with high karma first.And a person who is at the extreme of such system is currently right in front of me.She's normally not harmful.Unless you get close.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat happens when you get close? Well...Let's just say that this person's Karma dunks on Elnore, who is known to kill people, with an overwhelming number.The one who killed the most people in this academy right now is this little girl.\u201c\u2026!\u201dAnd looking at the sword flying towards me, I can fully understand how that was possible.The main character Elijah couldn\u2019t even react to the EX Class Desperation and was blown away in a single punch.And yet, now, I could only react to the trajectory of Yuria's sword.\u201c-\u2026!\u201dRealizing that it's a true life-or-death situation, my concentration heightened to the point where the world seems to have slowed down....[T/N: Still looking for RAWS]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's a relic and won\u2019t be easily destroyed just from a few attacks, making it a good substitute for a shield.Zeng-! Sparks flew with a sound.\u2018What a monster\u2026!\u2019Despite having enhanced strength with enough power to blow away a human like a feather, my body felt numb.It was absurdly powerful for an attack done without proper stance and right after waking up.Fortunately, I know how to avoid being beaten.I threw my body backwards and rolled.This is a s\u2020upid move if you\u2019re in combat.It has no meaning other than keeping a distance from the opponent.However, against this girl, this was a good move.As soon as my body touched the floor, I instinctively measured the distance between us.\u2018Three and a half steps.\u2019It\u2019s a distance where I can reach her without the risk of getting sliced.Meanwhile, Yuria remained rooted on her spot.She exhibits near invincible combat power against opponents who entered within a \u2018three steps\u2019 range from her. Inversely, she cannot invade within \u2018three steps\u2019 of the opponent.A human being forced to distance herself from everyone.The \u2018curse\u2019 on this person was designed that way.[Can you please stay still?]Of course, seeing that sentence floating in the air with that teary eyes, it was clear that she wasn\u2019t too happy about me not being within range.\u201c\u2026So it\u2019s easier to slice?\u201d[Yes.]I expected that much.Though I'm stuck in quite a bit of a dilemma.A wall at the back and Yuria's sword in front.I am safe as long as I'm more than three steps away, but I have no way of escaping in this situation.I could risk it for the biscuit and pass through her, but with such intense hostility, that's the last thing I want to do. I'd rather try negotiating first\u2026\u201c\u2026?\u201dWait a minute.Negotiate.I can negotiate.Some ideas started to come to mind.As someone who's forced to keep a distance from everyone, Yuria\u2019s life was solitary.This was all an unexpected encounter. So considering that she prefers an environment where there are \u2018few people\u2019 and with a \u2018constant state\u2019, assuming that is not too far off.The faculty members have their own residence and would not come here unless it's for business.People in such an environment always suffer chronically.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd so, I slowly put my hand in my pocket, making it very clear that I have no malicious intentions.Then, with a solemn gesture, I take out the biscuits I was eating earlier.\u201c\u2026\u201d[...]I can feel Yuria\u2019s gaze locking on to the biscuits I'm holding.Her gaze moves along the direction of the food.I think I heard a dry swallow and something like a grumbling stomach.\u201cPsspsspss.\u201dI began tossing the biscuits one by one as if I'm feeding a cat.I'm using this to lure her away from my escape escape path, just like in the story of Hansel and Gretel.[Are you trying to entice a human with food?]The advantage of communicating with levitating text is that you can clearly distinguish between speaking and what their mouth is doing.She may have asked that question, but she was currently eating a biscuit with great vigor.[I'm not an animal. How can anyone fall for something like this!]Her words may not be honest, but her actions are.Every time she ate one, she noticeably became happier.If she was a puppy, her tail would've been wagging furiously by now as she munch on.Then, she must have realized that I was watching and heavily denied.[I won\u2019t fall for these primitive tricks! I am human!]Is that so?\u201cI got some more, you want them?\u201d[...]After a while.Yuria was munching on a whole bag of biscuits with glee.She looked like a cute animal.[By the way, who are you? Why are you here?]\u201c\u2026\u201dPeople need to open themselves up first before we can attempt any sort of civilized communication.And finally getting this question.\u2018\u2026But I can\u2019t tell her the truth.\u2019I can't just say, I'm here to steal, can I?Regardless of how much Yuria is leading a half-wild beast-like solitary life, she's not incapable of communication.It would be difficult if this gets known by faculty members.Now, what\u2019s a good excuse\u2026Ah, right.I glanced at the incense burner lying on the floor.If I try to grab it now, it will attract Yuria's attention. So let\u2019s talk a bit more.\u201cI came to give you food because of someone.\u201dSuch a topic naturally grabbed Yuria's attention.[\u2026Yes?]Yuria asked blankly.Seeing dozens of floating question marks, she must have been quite taken aback.\u201cSomeone I know said to take care of you.\u201d[Someone you know\u2026?]Actually, that person doesn't exist. However, saying this BS will help later.It would've been impossible to create a variable like this in the original game. But at the same time, if it was the original game, I wouldn't have encountered Yuria in the supply room.With that said, shouldn\u2019t I take advantage of the opportunity of meeting her here? This would make things run more smoothly for me in the future.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your sister is doing well in the Holy Land.\u201dThe key is to deliver this information in advance.Yuria\u2019s body visibly stiffened hearing this.\u201cThe Emperor won\u2019t pay you or your sister any attention for the time being. He still has to deal with those hidden at the academy.\u201dThe girl tightly embraced her chain-wrapped sword that never once left her side.Although it was a small action, the swirl of emotions it brought was terrifyingly intense.It's all because of that person that Yuria has come to Elfante Academy, far away from her hometown Holy Land, and living a life like this.Originally, this would be covered in detail in Chapter 2.But she at least deserves to know some general information about her one and only family.\u201c\u2026\u201dMy eyes couldn't help but linger on the sword that Yuria was holding.It didn't look like it had any special features on the outside, but it's actually a terrifying high rank item in Sera.Yuria actually plays the role of a kind of \u2018seal\u2019 that suppresses its fangs. The curse associated with the three steps also comes from that thing.She's probably under constant threat of mental corruption even worse than Elnore.Shouldn\u2019t we give her some hopeful news to ease her suffering?[You, who are you? Where did you come from\u2026]\u201cI'll get going now.\u201dI can't possibly tell her that in detail.\u2018Because there is no such thing in the first place.\u2019Uh.If a lie is too long, its tail will easily get stomped on.It would be better to mysteriously exit while I still can.On the way, I made sure to pick up the incense burner that's on the floor due to the aftermath of the previous collision.Someone from the Holy Land would know the value of this item, but Yuria seemed too shocked by what I said and didn\u2019t to pay any attention to this.Thank god\u2026!It\u2019s worth the talk\u2026!\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll come again.\u201dStill, I left her with a farewell message.Even if I can no longer go to the supply room and steal in the future, I\u2019m sure there will be one more time.Look out for me then.

The atmosphere is reminiscent of that of a mother duck leading her little ducklings behind.We're currently in the highest hill in Elfante Academy, the Grande Hill, where you could see all the nearby facilities.It is the best place to introduce new students to the overall structure of the academy.\u201cThat\u2019s the dormitory. I think everyone is familiar with where it is, right? The facilities used by each department are different \u2014over there is a physical training room mainly used by the School of Knights, while over there is the magic training hall used by the School of Magic\u2026\u201dAs for me, these explanations were just a repeat of what I already know.Elfante\u2019s curriculum is divided into five Schools, with each representing a field.Knight, Magic, Utility, Crafting, Theology.This is not just exclusive to Elfante, the Tribal Union and Holy Land also follow the same system.Starting from the welcome party that will be held in a few days, the freshmen will choose their majors and minors, and the same goes for the main character.\u2018\u2026 Actually, the Schools here are different.\u2019They may be called \u2018Schools\u2019 but looking at the 'facilities' and their size, it is not an exaggeration to say that each is a small city of their own.True to its reputation as one of the best educational institution on the continent, the amount of land and budget allocated to each School is staggering.The same applies to the Holy Land and Tribal Union.Elfante Academy, Great Temple, Fighting Furnace.These neighboring educational institutions are the best of the continent.They are called the Golden Triangle.\u2018And, that\u2019s that.\u2019I checked the items I brought, while listening to Madam Ophelia\u2019s explanation with one ear.In my bag was an incense burner and various materials to light the incense.I also brought some extra\u2026 \u2018offerings\u2019 to use.This field trip event, which follows immediately after the entrance exam, is like a tutorial that introduces the world and functions of the academy to the player. And there are some things that can only be done at this time.\u201cUhm, is that the famous Void Zone over there?\u201dYes, that's a good question.When one of the students asked such a question, Madam Ophelia looked troubled.Then her squinted eyes turned to the huge gray orb that the student was pointing at.Despite being far away, the insidiousness and ominousness can be clearly felt even from such a distance.\u201cThat is true, but- that is a restricted area - you\u2019ll be in big trouble if you go there-\u201cA dome-shaped sphere of enormous size embedded in the center of the three educational institutions forming a triangle. And a huge tower-shaped building looming inward.Madam Ophelia\u2019s comment was not an overreaction. In fact, the words 'restricted area' are even too mild.Void Zone, the product of the Great God-Devil War, which went down in history as the worst war.[T/N: Not sure on the name since \uc2e0\ub9c8 (Shinma) has no one-to-one translation. But based on the novel's setting, I used God-Devil; Shin=Deity/God & Ma=Devil]This is the place where the messenger of God and the hero who inherited his power fought the final bloodbath against the devil and sealed it.Hundreds of years have passed since its discovery, but the clash between the demonic and divine power lingering around it showed no signs of subsiding.There's a 100% chance of dying if you were to get close to it. Even someone powerful won't experience any better.\u2018In the first place\u2026\u2019This was the reason why the three academies, the Golden Triangle, are close to each other.The \"Great Treaty,\" created after the Great God-Devil War, between the three continental powers\u2014 the Empire, the Holy Land and the Tribal Union, had a clause that required each power to send a certain number of manpower to help manage the Void Zone.The Treaty is still valid today, hundreds of years after the devil last appeared.The devil has been sealed thanks to the sacrifice of the warriors of the past. But if it is freed, that place will definitely be the starting point.The reason why there are so many high-quality staff among the academy faculty is because their main job is monitoring and guarding the Void Zone. And as to not waste manpower, they also serve as teachers on the side.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, considering the main scenario, it is not so unlikely that the real devil will be released.I feel dirty.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a famous place passed down even in myths? Can we go closer and take a look?\u201d\u201cUh-um-\u201dSeeing several students, whose eyes were burning with passion for learning, Madam Ophelia pursed her lips and scratched her cheek.Seeing this, I calmly kept my backpack.Part of the reason why Madam Ophelia is called \u2018Mommy\u2019 by players is because she wouldn't reject a request from the students. What will follow is already obvious\u2026\u201cThen, shall we only go as far as Seraph-nim's protection allows-? It\u2019s safe as long as we're inside-\u201cRight.\u25cfAnother name for the messenger of God revealed in mythology is an angel.As an existence that appeared together when the devil awakened and began to plunge the world into chaos, the angel delivered various blessings and knowledge to humans.It is said that an angel's power could boil the sea and overturn mountains.A Seraph is a name given only to special beings among the angels.It can be said that they have a status that is almost equivalent to that of a demigod by wordly standards.\u201cThen we'll have lunch around here-\u201dAnd such an existence had set up a protective barrier with enough stability that people could have a leisurely meal near the Void Zone.In the first place, the reason why the academy is able to exist near here is because of this barrier.The sight of bright white light clusters floating around is a spectacle, which naturally garnered the admiration of the students.After settling down and taking out their lunchbox, one of the students asked Madam Ophelia another question.\u201cOh, I heard that priests often visit this area. This is one of the few pieces of evidence that we can use to study the power of angels, right?\u201d\u201cThat's right-?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Legend has it that angels, who normally dwell in another plane of existence, would descend to the human world and bestow mortals \u2018blessings\u2019 or \u2018gifts.\u2019Each one is extremely powerful, and it is said that the blessings and gifts would go down in history.The stakes for theologians or priests seeing an angel is high.As far as I know, it\u2019s a legend based on facts.Of course, there's naturally some conditions.\u201cWell, I've seen numerous fancy ceremonies and rituals performed while I'm on duty, but there was never a case where an angel appeared-\u201dThe student who asked Madam Ophelia the question nodded in understanding at her answer.After all, it's an angel we're talking about here. Can such an existence just be summoned at will?However.\u2018\u2026It's actually easier than what everyone thinks.\u2019I approached Madam Ophelia while thinking to myself.\u201cExcuse me, can I eat a little further away?\u201d\u201cHmm-?\u201dMadam Ophelia tilted her head, her expression asking, 'why?'\u201cI feel a little uncomfortable eating here.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ahh-\u201cHowever, after hearing my words and looking around, she nodded her head.I had defeated Elijah with one punch and was also in the scene of the crime during the attempted assassination of Princess Tristan. My reputation naturally skyrocketed after such events.Of course, most of the gazes on me don't look so pleased. In fact, there is a high possibility that they are on the bad side.Further, me subduing Hasmed during the entrance exam and simply letting him go could lead to a lot of problems. That's why Elijah and Elnore, who witnessed it, also remained silent.In other words, the public's perception of me is that I'm a freeloader who did nothing while Princess Tristan was being assassinated and a fraud that cheated to defeat the next hero candidate.Rumors tend to be blown out of the proportion. However, those who follow and believe such gossip without a second thought are people who don't like me in the first place.A nameless noble from an unknown no-root baron family is undeserving of the spotlight.\u201cTry not to go too far, okay\u2014? It's dangerous-\u201c\u201cYes.\u201dOf course, what they say or think is none of my concerns.On the contrary, I am grateful for such opposition as it made Madam Ophelia agree to my request to leave.\u2018Let\u2019s see\u2026\u2019I walked somewhere far enough where I wouldn't be bothered by anyone.There\u2019s nothing good about showing others what I\u2019m going to be doing.Uh.Primarily in a theological sense.\u201cAlright.\u201dI began setting up the things I brought in my bag.The Divine's Ultima and the materials needed to light it.I put the unicorn horn powder into the incense burner and lit a fire with the phoenix feather.After adjusting the flames intensity using the coral fan, smoke began to spread.The smoke soon reached a light cluster floating nearby, and promptly started to mix and clump together.The Divine's Ultima's function is simple. Like how I compared it to a phone before, it allows me to contact beings that I would never normally be able to communicate with.To materialize beings from another plane of existence into the human world. This is what the Divine's Ultima is capable of.\u2018If you think about it\u2026\u2019Theologians and priests are not wrong for making all sorts of fuss here.The angelic presence is particularly evident around here more than anywhere else. After all, the barrier was set up by a Seraph.The problem was that they misunderstood the nature of angels.In myths, they are often described as noble and divine existences.Dignified and virtuous beings revered by many.However.That\u2019s not true.Like really.-\u2026..The light-smoke mix gradually took shape, and soon several burly men appeared.Behind them were pure white wings and golden halos floated above their heads.No matter how you look at it, they are your clich\u00e9 angels.But.\u201cHow did these f*cking kids do the pre-work? Where are those bas\u2020ards from Jinji's construction cooperation unit this quarter?\u201d\u201cUm, Lord Angel-nim. They're probably Gary's.\u201d\u201cThose sons of bi\u2020ches think they're slick, huh? Do you really want me to knock some sense on your guys' heads? Hey, call up those f*ckers. If Seraph-nim sees this, we're all done for, go it?\u201dNo matter which angle you look at, this conversation is neither noble or virtuous.In the first place, carrying rough items like a hammer or a military shovel isn't exactly what you can call elegant.\u201c\u2026\u201dThese angels look more like\u2026 the \u2018military\u2019.An extreme male-dominated society. A thorough rank system. A top-down hierarchy. A rigid and violent atmosphere.Basically, if a Seraph created or ordered something, those under him maintain or do it.\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough holy water compound to plug the gap in the barrier! Can I borrow some?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t do one thing right, can you as$hole? Give me the brush, I'll do it myself. Zoomers these days can\u2019t do anything right. Back in my day-\u201c\u201c\u2026\u201dListening to their conversation, I'm glad I came alone.If devout believers saw this scene, they would have passed out foaming on their mouths.\u201cUm, by the way Squad Leader. You know that human over there?\u201d\u201cYeah, who's he?\u201d\u201cYou mean the one that's been staring at us since earlier?\u201d\u201cIt probably just a coincidence. Still, it\u2019s nice that he\u2019s quiet. Those annoying bas\u2020ards spawn out of nowhere and cause ruckus\u2026\u201dAlright, let\u2019s think about this.What meaning would a grand ceremony or ritual really hold in front of such people?They're dragged out for manual labor that they didn't want to do. They roll around like dogs, feeling like shi\u2020 and wanted to die. They're in a sensitive state where they want to kiII someone constantly trying to talk to them.What would happen if dozens or hundreds of people flock to them and recite Buddhist scriptures or Bible verses over and over, and over again?There is a reason why angels do not show themselves. All the above is just annoying to them.People are lucky a disaster hasn't befallen them.On the contrary, what they want is something very simple and primitive.I sighed and took out the \u2018offerings\u2019 I brought from my bag.Generic alcohol with high alcohol content and lacking subtlety, but with a strong and distinct taste. There's also meat I bought at a reasonable price at the market.These are simple and rough taste that commoners enjoy, but there\u2019s nothing like it.It\u2019s a kind of special set for construction workers.This is probably the best way to rejuvenate from doing intense labor.Pyeonyuk (sliced meat) with a glass of makgeolli (rice wine) after a serious sweat sesh.What more can you want?\u201c\u2026The guy got good taste.

I'm watching all this while holding up a sigh.However.Regardless of how much they look like wasted drunkards right now, if they are put in the material world, each and every one of them is a being capable of a power comparable to that of a military corps. There\u2019s no need to do anything disrespectful.\u201cHey, I ate well.\u201dThe one with the reddest face among the scattered angels stood up.Obviously\u2026 it was the Lord Angel. Among the angels present, he's clearly the one with the highest rank.\u201cThanks to you, working became enjoyable for a bit. It's been a while, and who knows when we're able to experience this again.\u201d\u201cThey're not feeding you at work?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of food would there be in this world? We don\u2019t even have physiological needs.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you have something else then?\u201d\u201cLook at our condition. What do you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOh my God.Doesn\u2019t that mean that they're on military service for eternity without pay?According to the setting, this race is virtually immortal in the hidden world.What angels? They're just winged slaves.\u201cDon\u2019t think about useless things, now tell me.\u201dAs I was giving the other person a sympathetic look, the Lord Angel smiled and pointed at something.It was the still-smoking Divine's Ultima incense burner.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou came to us because you wanted something. Tell me and I'll give it to you.\u201dAround me were loud mumbling of Iya~ Squad Leader is so hot~ He's alive~The angels twisted, nonessential rambles were dizzying.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut, well, he's not wrong.Even though the purpose of the Ultima was simply to reveal the hidden world, the reason why it is classified as a \u2018survival\u2019 item is that when you encounter this side in the game, it'll unconditionally get infused with divine protection.\u201cSay what you want and I'll do the best I can.\u201dHowever, it was totally unexpected that they'll just give it to me before I could even negotiate.I\u2019ve even prepared dozens of bargaining chips specifically for them.While I was blankly staring at this development that had worked so well for me, the main angel continued.\u201cYou just don't decide to offer things to air. Looking at you, it seems that you know the rules and laws of angels.\u201d\u201c\u2026To be honest, I kinda do.\u201d\u201cI can see it.\u201dThe Lord Angel's eyes flashed with all kinds of colors as he said so.I know this ability.Insight.It's a skill that could grasp one's \u2018essence\u2019 just by looking at them. You can say it's like reading the other person\u2019s Status Window in great detail.\u201cI see that you're someone who's going to be big in the future. Think of this like an investment.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI can see potential. It's just not fully developed yet.\u201dThe other angels lying nearby woozily echoed too.This is a burdensome high evaluation. What could he possibly be referring to?\u2018This must be it\u2026\u2019He's probably talking about my Special Gift.The ability to gain favor from the wicked.If we're talking about my potential, then there\u2019s nothing else that comes to mind other than this.\u201cThat is more powerful than you think. I'm interested to see how you deal with it.\u201dThe angel said with a burst of laughter.However, the sentence that followed was not something to be said lightly.\u201cBut it\u2019s not necessarily always good.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou've been bitten by something terrible. I can\u2019t see its full form yet, but I can tell it\u2019s bad. It seems to have stuck because of your abilities.\u201dWhat is he talking about?Blinking in wonder, the Lord Angel continued to speak while scratching his head.\u201cBut again, it\u2019s kinda funny. It certainly is bad, but it doesn\u2019t look that harmful.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cIt feels strangely friendly. At least I don\u2019t feel like it's trying to harm you.

Just prepare yourself sometime soon.\u201dStill blankly blinking, I was net with another word bomb.\u201cLet me give you one piece of advice. If it could mean your survival, you\u2019re thinking of taking everything even if they're not yours, right? That incense burner is also something that should've gone to someone else.\u201d\u201c\u2026How did you know?\u201d\u201cI told you, I can see everything.\u201dThe angel replied with a smirk.\u201cBut I have no intention of interfering with anything. I would've advised against it if it were another person and not you.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cTake it all. Whatever it may be, gather all the means available to you. It would be really hard to survive if it's involving with such an abomination.\u201dThe weight of his words was heavy.Though, his following words went back to a light-hearted tone.\u201cBut don't worry too much.\u201d\u201cWhat? You just made a big deal about it.\u201d\u201cI can tell just by looking at your expression. Usually, humans I\u2019ve seen get scared right away when they hear these words.\u201dA ferocious smile crept across his face.\u201cBut you... You remained calm and even planned on how to live through to see the next day. People like that typically have a long life.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cTrust me, the average person don\u2019t do that. You're a bud waiting to bloom.\u201dAgain, it's an onerously high evaluation.I\u2019m just trying because I don\u2019t want to die.But this is still coming from an angel. I'll need to give it some serious thought. This is pretty important-\u201cSquad Leader, you're talking nonsense after receiving the good shi\u2020?\u201d\u201cCome here quickly, use the shovel not eat it.\u201d\u201cLook at these little f*cks.

With this, I have more time to grow.\u2019Of course, being able to meet an angel itself is possible after Chapter 2. But being able to interact directly with a main angel would take a longer time than that.Receiving protection from such an existence for free is huge.The problem is this.[ Consumes a small amount of mana. ]I looked at such sentences on the skill window with gloomy eyes.Generally, skills require mastering related traits, such as magic power and divine power.But I don't know any one of those, they're nothing but pies in the sky.Elfante students learn this type of knowledge from childhood, meaning the academy doesn't't teach it.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn this situation where I can\u2019t learn magic right away, I have to find a way to use temporarily.I probably won't get it right here, but I can get it with a 'clue'.\u201cHere, here! This is a magic gun that was refined by the Firearms Department of the Crafting School! Come now and get 10 free shots of 10 bullets made from grinded spirit stones! If you perform well, there will be prizes!\u201d\u201cThe Magic School's Alchemy Department is recruiting new students! We'll be handing out self-made reagents only during the Guide Event, so come and see us!\u201dThese types of talks could be heard all around.A Guide Event is a faculty-run event that's basically an advertisement. It is held before the welcome party where students decide on their majors.The departments usually throw baits like distributing reagents and show that they're a fun and beneficial place.Once you've taken the bait and joined, they'll then start giving you insignificant tasks and do some positive reinforcement like, \u2018Wow, you did a really good job!\u2019They're doing everything they can to attract freshmen\u2026 or to more appropriately call them, sIaves to do the chores for them.These enthusiastic seniors were throwing in carrots to seduce the unsuspecting freshmen. But those bright smiles hid dark malice.The poor chicks who are ignorant of the world would get devoured by the preying snakes.\u201c\u2026\u201dI want none of those things.I'm currently at the event booth of the Knight School's Magic Research Department.Compared to other booths, here is unusually empty, but that\u2019s because this place is exceptionally strict for a booth in a Guide Event.It's a long dungeon course prepared by the department, a mock battle against a dummy doll with a 100% reproduction of real magic using magic fibers.What freshmen would want to do such a grueling job, a Guide Event at that.\u2018There\u2019s one here.\u2019However, as much as they make us do such hard work, the reward they give is exceptional.Considering the difficulty in obtaining it, it\u2019s not a stretch to say that it's almost like eating for free. It's that good.To the point where I feel sorry for the other freshmen who missed such a jackpot.\u201cWell, you're quite the blank paper, aren't you?\u201d\u201cNo. I was listening.\u201d\u201cReally? Then what did I say?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me to form a team of two and wait?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHearing my reply, the senior receptionist in front of me crossed their arms with a displeased look.\u201cYou probably don\u2019t know what that means. Where is your partner?\u201d\u201cThey'll be here soon.\u201d\u201cWho would come to such an unpopular department? Are you lying?\u201dJudging from the self-deprecating remarks, they seem aware of the fact that their department is exceptionally non-mainstream among the Knight departments.Knights have the highest prestige among the main armies of the empire, thus regular Knights are a target for envy.However, the probability of becoming a regular knight is extremely low in the Magic Research Department. At best, they'll probably land a job as an office worker if it worked out well.\u2018If I get along with them, there would be no other place that's as comfortable as here.\u2019True to the department\u2019s name, they find weaknesses of magic, investigate their ecology, and establish an overall \u2018strategy\u2019.They're nothing flashy so people tend to ignore them. However, the information you get here makes for a pretty big difference in the future scenarios.These are the people who will provide tremendous help in Chapter 1 of the scenario.Of course, since it is a non-mainstream department, it is not attracting new students, which really is discouraging. So let\u2019s give some encouragement.\u201cI'm not lying, my partner is coming. Also, it will be very crowded here soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cWell, the person coming is someone you can call famous.\u201dSaying so, I checked my magic wristwatch.It's about time they arrive.It's an \u2018experienced\u2019 freshman who knows that this kind of study, despite looking modest, is extremely helpful in practice.\u201cHello! Is this the Magic Research Depart\u2026ment\u2026uh\u2026?\u201dThe person that came in through the tent of the booth gradually quieted down.It's probably because they found me.I gently waved my hand towards them.\u201cHi.\u201dI originally didn\u2019t want to get involved with this person.But I changed my mind.Especially after listening to the advice of the Lord Angel.

That you'll do anything I ask?\u201d\u201c\u2026I did.\u201d\u201cSo what's the problem now?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, I'm sorry.\u201dWhen I suggested that \u2018we get closer,\u2019 it was her who delightedly rushed here.You have to keep your word.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd even if I want to help, I can\u2019t.I am about as useful as a bug, with these puny stats.It would be better if I just gave out orders and let her do all the fighting.\u2018And\u2026\u2019It's become clear while going around this artificial dungeon that Desperation will not be triggered unless there is \u2018malice\u2019 threatening my life.That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t work on these dummies that are simply repeating programmed actions.So what does this point suggest?Desperation is not omnipotent. Like most things, it's clearly flawed and imperfect.The complacency that this skill will save me in every situation is something I should quickly throw away.\u2018I must raise my stats.\u2019Stats are like your athleticism that can be used in all situations. In the end, personal growth is indispensable.Especially when you consider that the performance of items and skills is also affected by stats.As I was thinking, Elijah grumbled next to me again.\u201cStill, the instructor has skills and could probably do better than me. With two of us working together, we can break through much faster-\u201d[ Amazing speed! ][ You broke the 2-year-old record! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dHer complaining immediately stopped after hearing the reverberating announcement.\u201cNo, why? How is this possible?

But I'm just clearing it by myself, and it's the highest record\u2026 What the heII is this, hello? Are you using some kind of sorcery? Even regular knights couldn\u2019t proceed like this, right? Uh? What is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI inwardly chuckled over her confused existential crisis.\u2018This is great.\u2019I accumulated enough experience to be considered a veteran in this game.And I obtained a top-notch subordinate who will move without asking or questioning my words?This dungeon is so easy that she can complete it with her eyes closed.\u2018Hmm.\u2019And if you\u2019re running a speedrun with \u2018only one person\u2019 like this, it's bound to attract some interest.In fact, the reward for simply clearing this mock battle is good, but that is also quite important.I had to take this opportunity.Then, what is it in the end?\u201cThe next section will be a little tougher than this one, let\u2019s keep it up. Fighting~!\u201dI cheered her up.Because, until then, you have to do it all by yourself.\u201c\u2026\u201dElijah gritted her teeth.You'll lose your teeth if you keep doing that.\u25cfEvan Kramer, a second year student in the Magic Research Department, was nervously sitting in front of the control panel.\u201cThe mock battle stages are pretty good these days. Did the department set it up?\u201d\u201cYes, yes\u2026!\u201dEvan barely managed to squeeze out an answer in stutters. The other person smiled as they watched the video being played.\u201cWe can increase the budget next year.\u201dTo be able to say such a thing, it was clear that they were someone with authority.The speaker was none other than the Dean of the Knight School.Conrad Baltador.The Dean, who directly reports to the President, was an individual who, at least within the academy, was said to possess unparalleled authority.For a student, it would be difficult to even breathe just by being next to such a person.\u2018Why is someone like him at a booth\u2026!\u2019As Evan shivered and pondered those thoughts, there was another voice.\u201cOh, Conrad. What are you doing here?\u201dUnfortunately for Evan, the owner of this voice also did not help the atmosphere at all.Seeing the person entering the booth with several pale-faced assistant professors from the Magic School, Evan almost suffered actual breathing problems.\u201cI can say the same to you, Percy. You rarely go out.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I came out to see the freshmen. I like seeing the potential talents.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dConrad silently looked at the half-dead assistant professors from behind the woman called Percy.\u201c\u2026A new tool, no, you\u2019re not looking for graduate students?\u201d\u201cWell, if they want to come out of their own volition, you won\u2019t stop them, right?\u201dPercy Siston Levantin, the head of the Magic School. She replied with a smile.\u201cSo, you haven\u2019t answered yet. What are you doing?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s someone I\u2019m keeping an eye on these days.\u201dConrad replied as he turned his gaze back to the screen.Percy\u2019s gaze naturally followed to that direction.\u201cOh, I know that child. Isn't she the next hero candidate?\u201dAfter saying that, Percy\u2019s gaze moved to the stage clear record on the side panel.I guess this is to be expected. The clearing speed of each passing each section is much faster than normal students.The next Hero candidate is indeed noteworthy\u2026\u201cNo, not her.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dPersie tilted her head and looked at the other student.\u201cWho is this?\u201d\u201cDowd Campbell.\u201d\u201cAh, the con artist?\u201dEven though she doesn\u2019t go outside her lab as often, she still knew the recent rumors and noise around this freshman.This guy conned a win against the hero candidate during the sparring.\u201c\u2026But why are you watching a scammer?\u201d\u201cLooks like he knows that too.\u201dConrad replied with a snort.\u201cThis guy\u2019s talent is real.\u201d\u201cTalent?\u201dPersie furrowed her eyebrows and stared at the screen.Talent... What talent?No matter how she looked at it, it just looks like he's getting a free ride from the hero candidate.\u201cThis is why Mages who only roll around with pens are no good.\u201d\u201cWhy are you picking a fight now?\u201d\u201cThis feat, this record can never be set just by the hero candidate alone. Rather, the main body is over there.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dPercy asked with her head tilted, but Conrad simply turned his gaze back to the screen instead of explaining in detail.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's really not a display of true skill.In that sense.How is this man just blazing through this?\u2018He's calculating everything.\u2019It's as if he knew the location of the monsters relative to the hero candidate, and then send out instructions at somehow the right timing.Each of his subsequent moves made it seem like he was seeing through the enemy's pattern.Every judgment he makes at every instance is a near-perfect answer.He may look like he was just standing and ordering around, but he was actually playing a complex and elaborately arranged artificial dungeon as if it were placed in the palm of his hand.I can assure you on this.This \u2018freshman\u2019 is the sole person among Elfante's history of students breaking through the dungeon in such a way.It's almost like\u2026\u2018He's fought on the battlefield thousands of times.\u2019This is the only explanation.Because it just doesn\u2019t make sense to have this kind of ability without any practical experience.And \u2018surviving combat\u2019 and living to develop this ability suggests that this guy is hiding something more than just what's on the surface.\u201c\u2026\u201dThis is why I'm curious.If he \u2018directly\u2019 participated in the dungeon raid with the hero candidate, what would the result be?If one person is already doing this much, one would happen if he participated himself.\u201cNo, I just can't bring myself to believe.

Can I take you up for an offer?\u201d\u201cDo tell.\u201dEven, his attitude was as if he's been waiting for this.\u201cCurrently, the Magic Faculty Dean Percy and I are engaged in a bet outside.\u201d\u201cA bet?\u201d\u201cIt's on whether you can break the record we set as a freshman or not. If you succeed\u2026 Percy will give you the right to ask for anything.\u201dOn the other side, Percy raised her eyebrows slightly with an expression asking what he was doing, but she didn\u2019t say much.Anyways, she was certain that their record would remain unbroken.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel burdened by it. The record you set now is great, regardless.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s fine.\u201dAnd so.\u201cThis is enough of a motivator.\u201dHearing Dowd Campbell's answer, the expression on Percy\u2019s face was truly worth seeing.\u25cf\u201cIya\u2026\u201dAs soon as Beatrix entered the dedicated fitness room of the student council, she was greeted by a sweltering heat.Elnore stretched out in the middle of the floor, covered in sweat, also added to the scene.\u201cWhat is all this?\u201dShe sighed helplessly and tossed a water bottle to Elnore.\u201cI needed to sort out my thoughts.\u201d\u201cRight, I know you come here alone to sweat whenever you're like that. So what's the problem this time?\u201d\u201cIt has always been like this. But it's ramped up these days.\u201dUpon hearing that, Beatrix\u2019s expression immediately turned solemn.A dark rumor has been circulating in imperial circle.That the devil runs on Duke Tristan's veins.This sentence could mean two things.One is literally being connected to the devil, pledging with evil to achieve outstanding feats.The second is a metaphorical expression of \u2018madness\u2019, which is present in the Duke's bloodline.It's an expression of extreme violence and the loss of reason that occurs in bursts from time to time.As time passes, the Tristan Family were notorious for their miserable later years, which overshadows their achievements.Elnore is also not free from such a curse.Rather, in her case, it's particularly extreme.She alone knew of aspects of Elnore that could never be revealed to the public.\u201c\u2026Is it very serious?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to worry about. It\u2019s not entirely because of that.\u201dElnore smiled and wiped her sweat off with a towel.\u201cThere was something I wanted to remember.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to remember?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a move I learned from my mother when I was little, when I just started learning the sword\u2026 But I can\u2019t quite recall it. That\u2019s why I was checking my swordsmanship right from the beginning.\u201dFor a woman who normally doesn\u2019t show even the slightest emotion, Elnore is being really sentimental right now. But instead of pointing it out, Beatrix encouraged her.Elnore\u2019s feelings for her father and mother are on the polar opposites.Her mother died when she was young, so you can understand why. be\u201cWell, don\u2019t push yourself too hard.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. If I exhaust myself, I won\u2019t care about most things.\u201d\u201cReally? Well, I have something to tell you.\u201dElnore's gaze turned to Beatrix.\u201c\u2026Tell me about what?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying this because you asked me to let you know of all the information about it. A junior told me this earlier.\u201d\u201cSo, what is it?\u201d\u201cDowd Campbell is with the next hero candidate in a mock battle. People say they're in a bet with the Deans-\u201dSparks flew from Elnore\u2019s eyes.\u201cSo, you're saying that the two of them are stuck together?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWell, I guess this is more important than being in a bet with the Deans.\u201cThe mock battle is a two-person challenge, so the two of them need to stick together, no?\u201dElnore sprang up immediately, her sweat splattering everywhere, but she didn\u2019t seem to care.\u201cDidn't you just say you're too exhausted to care about most things?\u201d\u201cShut it, and tell me where it is.\u201dThis crazy woman.Beatrix\u2019s temples, which had been overworked lately, began to throb again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was unable to utter words upon hearing such a wild reply that was said a matter of fact.\u201c\u2026You have high confidence. Is there any reason for that?\u201dOf course there is.The monsters in this artificial dungeon have patterns. As someone who knew them like it's at the back of my hand, targeting their vitals is as easy as one, two and three.It\u2019s not that difficult to get the timing right.And, above all.[It\u2019s Conrad. Are you ready?]\u201cA long time ago.\u201d[Good. In this last section, you are able to choose the difficulty. Naturally, the higher the difficulty, the more points you get-]This is where my confidence stems from.\u201cPlease make it the highest difficulty.\u201d[\u2026]After a moment of silence, the person speaking on the other side suddenly changed.[Listen up freshman. I know that you're confident, but isn't this too much?! Even if you lose the bet, there is no penalty, so why go this far\u2026?! The highest difficulty is no different from a real battle! Death is highly probable!]Basing from the voice, that should be Percy.She might sound angry, but it's apparent from her concern that she's a true teacher who really cares about her students.\u201cYes, I am aware.\u201dIn that level of difficulty, the monsters will literally be coming after you with the intent to \u2018kiII\u2019.\u201cSince it doesn\u2019t make any sense otherwise.\u201d[\u2026Yes?]\u201cBecause anything easier than that isn\u2019t worth the effort.\u201d[\u2026]I smiled at the thought of her stun-locked expression.And it is easier for me that way.\u25cf\u201cWhy did you agree to that?\u201d\u201cWhy not, didn\u2019t we also go on this difficulty as freshmen?\u201d\u201cNot at the Colosseum. They could really die there.\u201dPercy said with a bitter expression.The Colosseum, the last section of the artificial dungeon, is all about defeating as many monsters as possible that are being infinitely summoned.In other words, recklessly raising the difficulty would summon more and more monsters, which can become really dangerous without any countermeasures.\u201cI don\u2019t think he would have said that if he's not confident. Let\u2019s just wait and see.\u201d\u201cI have also observed what\u2019s been going on so far. Is it really okay to rate this student so highly?\u201dPercy folder her arms and said disgruntledly.\u201cHe has no aptitude, no combat skills-\u201d\u201c- It\u2019s a mess. That's right. But you got fooled too.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dConrad smirked at Percy's dismay.\u201cLet's just watch for now. If it really does get dangerous, we can just go in and save them.\u201dIn the meantime, the screen is showing the two freshmen having already entered the Colosseum.Percy sighed inwardly as she watched the artificial monsters pour in from all directions and surrounding the two in a circle.As the highest difficulty, the scenario is naturally different from others. A weak-willed student would easily get intimidated by the sheer amount of murderous monsters.\u2018I just hope you don\u2019t overdo it\u2026\u2019Percy thought as she got her dose of tea, that had just been served. She had a habit of drinking tea whenever she's worried about something.She and Conrad killed 50 monsters within the time limit, which was a transcendental record for freshmen.She was feeling uneasy and unsure about this whole record breaking attempt.However.That anxiety was immediately thrown away when Dowd Campbell clashed with the first monster.-!-!!!She gaped when she saw the monster getting \u2018shattered\u2019 by Dowd Campbell's sword.\u201cWha, what?!\u201dSeeing her jump out of her seat, and even shout, Conrad couldn't help but chuckle.If the monster had been simply cut in one blow, there's really nothing to be so surprised about. Any skilled combatant can do that.However, what about using a sword as if it was a huge hammer?This could only be achieved by getting the perfect direct hit to a vital point, but how is that possible?\u201cSee? Everyone will be fooled at first glance.\u201dPercy would've normally reacted to such a sentence, but right now, she couldn't care less.The scene that's unfolding right in front of her eyes was shocking.\u201cNo, no, no-! How does that make sense?! How could a human who clearly had nothing suddenly\u2014!\u201d\u201cHave you ever considered that it wasn\u2019t that there was nothing, but rather it was made to look that way?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPercy slumped back to her seat from all the shock.Her gaze then rested on those two blazing through the record on the screen.It is an unrivaled feat that no one can match, not even in the last few years.The sentence that that student said before the battle started continuously echoed in Percy's mind.\u2013Anything easier than that isn\u2019t worth the effortHe was really serious about it? He wasn't bluffing?He's making the challenge seem like child's play.\u201c\u2026I now understand your interest, Conrad. I guess the only shallow thing here was my narrow vision.\u201d\u201cI don't blame you. If I hadn't seen it beforehand, I probably would have been fooled too.\u201dIn fact, even the faculty didn\u2019t pay attention to a single thing until they saw the sparring with the hero candidate.\u201cBut still, setting a new record is a completely different story. The Colosseum produces stronger monsters the further you-\u201dPercy suddenly stopped her sentence midway.It's probably because she saw that the monsters that appeared in the second wave were also shattered by Dowd\u2019s sword just like the ones before.\u2018\u2026Uh?\u2019There was a big question mark on top of her head.The situation that followed shattered the common sense she knew.Even the third wave suffered the same fate.Swing, swing, swing.At the same pace, regardless of how strong the opponent is, it always ends with the same result.\u2018\u2026\u2019Were monsters could be beaten so easily?Even when Conrad and her broke the all-time record, they didn't do it with this ease.This is just like cutting down weeds.It was not a battle, but a simple repetitive task.It looked so absurdly easy that even the hero candidate's hard fought battle next to it was being overshadowed.It should get harder the longer this goes on and the stronger the waves are, so why is the situation the same as before?Is there any bug in the system?\u2018\u2026No, there's wasn't.\u2019It\u2019s not like that.It\u2019s not that trivial.The more she watched the video on the screen, the more that feeling became more and more concrete.\u2018He's getting stronger.\u2019As his enemies get faster and stronger, Dowd Campbell also get faster and stronger.\u2018How could this be\u2026!\u2019As she was immersed in her thoughts, the death counter of the monsters recorded on the screen were accumulating at a tremendous speed.More than 10 monsters were hunted within a minute after starting.By the time half of the time limit passed, Conrad and Percy's record had already been broken.Still, Dowd Campbell\u2019s pace did not slow down.Rather, it's the opposite, he's actually getting faster and faster.As if the stronger the opponent, the stronger he becomes.And just like that, the time limit was up.It was so silent that you could even hear someone breathing.[ Congratulations! Incredible Feat! ][ You broke the All-time Record! ][ Team Dowd Campbell & Elijah Krisanax hunted a total of 100! ]The teacup that Percy was holding fell and shattered on the floor.But no one even spared a glance at it.Everyone was looking at the record with bewildered expressions.\u201cBravo.\u201dInside the intensely quiet room, only the applause of Conrad, who had a fierce smile on his face, could be heard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Otherwise, if it's 'awarded', there will be a problem.\u201dI calmly replied, but this was a very big deal.Just the act of opening the Vision Warehouse was a rare event itself, only happening twice in the entire game.And both of those openings were only possible after resolving major events in the story. This is absolutely not something you can do as a freshman.Above all, Percy, the Magic Faculty Dean, has given permission to \u2018request anything\u2019\u2026\u2018This is really good.\u2019This is a very good start even for a veteran like me.\u201c\u2026\u201dAs I was in my thoughts, Elijah looked at me with a strange expression.\u201cMister, I've noticed that you\u2019re always calm regardless of anything.\u201d{T/N: changed Instructor to Mister since it felt weird, just realized Mister is also applicable }\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cYou already planned out everything.

I should prepare at least one surprise.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI have been thinking about it before, but it became clearer during the mock battle. If I don\u2019t do something now, I would lose it sooner or later.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat is she saying?I looked at Elijah in confusion, but she just grinned and held her fist out in return.\u201c\u2026What's this?\u201d\u201cOh, a fist bump. Don\u2019t men do this with their friends?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThis is new.She seems to have a good affinity with people like in the original game, but there is something different somewhere that I can't quite put my finger on.Our fists bumped and Elijah hurried away with a bright smile.\u201cThen, see you tomorrow, Mister! I\u2019ll be sending you a letter back to your dorm!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHearing her say those words was making me worried.In the first place, she's saying that we'll meet tomorrow.< Gift-related Character Notification >\u25bc Elnore[ Trust Level 5 ][ Close to favorability status change! ][ She is an important character.

Do you like that freshman named Elijah?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat's happening right now exactly?Desperation did not activate, so it seems that she has no intention of hurting me. But even so, I feel like something big will happen if I don\u2019t appease her here.I have to say something\u2026!\u201cUm, Student Council President?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI missed you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe moment Elnor shut his mouth, nonexistent words from an imaginary dictionary flashed through my mind.A fool \u2013 it's synonymous for Dowd Campbell.There\u2019s no way someone high-profile like the Student Council President would fall for this.\u201c\u2026Did you?\u201dHow, her voice actually became much softer than before.And her expression also feels more relaxed, perhaps because of her lightening mood.\u2018\u2026Uh?\u2019That worked?This?A bad throw away, hail mary nonsense?While I was stumped at this unexpected development, Elnore crossed her arms and said sharply.\u201cYou mean you wanted to see me even while being with that freshman?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNo, I didn't mean that actually.\u201cAh, don\u2019t get me wrong. Not in the sense of a male-female relationship\u2026 Hmm. I meant it like between friends. We\u2019re not in that type of relationship yet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI was speechless for the most part.\u201c\u2026Umm, yes.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s it. Just remember your priorities.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat priorities?What do you mean?\u201cWell, since I'm already her, I\u2019ll pass this on in advance. It's originally meant to be delivered tomorrow.\u201dHaving said that, Elnore handed me a letter.What is this now?\u201c\u2026Make sure to open it somewhere quiet. Alright, then...\u201dAfter saying that, Elnore left just like a passing wind.She seemed embarrassed handing this over.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut what is it though?Both Elijah and Elnore are suddenly giving me letters.I gotta go and see what's the deal.\u25cf\u201cI shouldn't have opened them.\u201dI squeaked like a dying old man.On the desk were Elijah\u2019s and Elnor\u2019s letter.They have the same content.An invitation to be their \u2018partner\u2019 at the freshmen welcome party.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn fact, being a 'partner' is not a big deal in itself.It\u2019s just going around and having fun together during the event. So to speak, a date.It's the fresh spring bloom of youth.But I know the implications of this event since this happened in the game. The favorability of the rejected party drastically drops, and later, there would be a severe penalty when proceeding with the related scenario. It's to the point that it's no different than digging your own grave.That's why, I usually choose the character that I can \u2018bypass\u2019 or at least able to handle.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut the people involved in this is the main character and the final boss!Regardless of who I choose, hell is the only thing that's waiting for me. If I turn either of them into enemies, my life would be no different than a candle in a storm.Events cannot be avoided either. As mentioned before, this is part of the \u2018main quest\u2019. Not participating in the event would most likely lead straight to death.How about rejecting both? Then the penalty would be doubled! It\u2019s still death.I'm stuck in quite the predicament, having enemies on all sides.This is a life or death situation.No, this is just unfair. Especially so when this isn't even considered a real date.In the first place, there is no goddam way these two would ask me out for a date. The last time I checked, their favorability status is only at \u2018Curiosity\u2019 and \u2018Trust\u2019. It\u2019s not something like 'affection'.It would be more appropriate to call them 'interest'.\u2018I can\u2019t just die like this.\u2019I gritted my teeth and squeezed every bit of power from my braincells.Think Dowd Campbell, think!There has to be a way to save my life without antagonizing either of them\u2026!\u201c\u2026Ahah.\u201dAt this time, a plan came to mind.A plan that would inevitably lead to death if it fails, but could overcome the situation if it succeeds.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s kind of trashy though.But this is the only way out. My life is at stake here, I don\u2019t have a choice\u2026!I closed my eyes and began to flesh the plan out, extracting key information in the event.\u201cIt's worth the shot\u2026\u201dIt doesn\u2019t seem impossible, does it?\u201c\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, no matter who I choose, I'm practically dead.Therefore...\u201c\u2026Why not both?\u201dAll I have to do is to not get caught, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This way!\u201dI see Elnore, who spotted me in the distance, waving her hands at me.She was raising her arm above her head.It's a mess here so if she doesn\u2019t do that, I won\u2019t be able to see her.Alright, I'll apply the option to the clone and then meet with Elnore\u2026-!-!!!Just as I was about to press my option on the screen, a sudden scream from nearby startled me, making my body jump.I was so surprised that I accidentally tapped the shop window in front of me.\u201cGet out of the way!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, all students stay back!\u201dWhen I looked outside the hall, I saw a huge bear-shaped monster chained behind bars being escorted by several knights.Sometimes, monsters captured outside are brought inside the academy as test subjects or research material.It is definitely dangerous, but some professors vehemently argue that there is no better research subject than a living specimen.\u201c\u2026\u201dOf course, because of that, an accident will happen at the freshman welcome party.There is a reason why I chose the Ultima first among all the other items.\u2018Well, at any rate\u2026\u2019Since the main character and the final boss are in the same place, the suppression itself shouldn't be too hard.I just need to get those two in the right place at the right time.With this thought, I turned my gaze back to the window.[ Option: Enhanced Charisma has been purchased! ][ Option: Pheromone has been purchased! ][ Option Allocation Completed. ][ Body \u2013 Option: Applied Pheromone! ][ Clone \u2013 Option: Applied Charisma! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat the f*ck?!Why was pheromone purchased, and it's even applied to me?In the first place, can this be put in the main body?\u2018\u2026Come to think of it.\u2019I got startled earlier and tapped the shop window.But how in the heII it resulted with this?\u201cWhy are you spacing out\u2026\u201dElnore, who had come closer, stopped mid sentence as soon as our eyes met.[ Pheromone effect is applied to the target \u2018Elnore\u2019! ]No. Don't do that.Please!Elnore\u2019s eyes widened and her breathing gradually became ragged.An alarm immediately goes off in my head.I've already seen this before\u2026![Skill: Fatal Charm has been Activated\u2026][\u2026 Skill ineffective! ][ The target forcefully resisted the feeling of affection! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dYes. I have indeed seen this pattern before.Though, the system prompt is a bit strange.I don\u2019t know how and why she's suppressing it, but I guess this is good for me?As I mulled over such thoughts, Elnore had regained her expressionless look and was muttering something while patting her chest.\u201cCalm down. It's noisy.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it for you.\u201dThen who did you say that to?\u201cI was talking to my heart.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was noisy.\u201dI didn't even know how to respond to that. Elnore just said that without a change in expression.This woman, as in the original work, is seriously sometimes in the 4th Dimension.\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s go.\u201dAfter saying so, she began moving.By now, the clone would have made contact with Elijah. We need to move anyway to run into them.But I\u2019m a little worried about the pheromone effect.It will be fine, right\u2026?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you want it?\u201d[ Skill: Fatal Charm has been Activated\u2026][ \u2026Skill ineffective! ]\u201cJust in time, one just fell off and needed a replacement. You're always so attentive of... me. Um.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI'm intentionally giving her strange things like a button, but she's somehow finding meanings behind them.It is to the point that even I am fascinated by the way she interprets each and every trivial action I make. It's driving me nuts.\u2018My head hurts\u2026\u2019Still, I\u2019m glad I'm accompanying her without much problem. The clone on Elijah\u2019s side also seems to be getting along well.If it's like this, it won\u2019t be a big deal if I just proceed as it is now.With some free time, I was able to scout the landscape in the reception hall.Overall, it's just groups of students socializing with the seniors of their chosen major.I am not officially assigned to any class yet, so I don't receive that kind of guidance.\u201cBy the way, have you decided on a major?\u201d\u201cAh, I did.\u201dThis is actually a matter of considerable concern.In the world of Sera, choosing a \u2018major\u2019 means deciding on your main 'build'.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of the Theology Faculty.\u201dHearing this, Elnore\u2019s expression instantly darkened.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a waste of your talent if you don't enter the Knights Faculty. How about you reconsider?\u201dWell, that's definitely a fair thing to say.I mean, I've experienced the power of the Tristan Style Swordsmanship, paired with the Desperation skill.But I chose this path for a reason.\u201cThere is something I want to learn in the Theology Faculty.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to learn?\u201d\u201cThere's something I've been meaning to protect.\u201dUh.Mainly my life.Divinity-related skills are the most \u2018survival\u2019 specialized builds among all the builds that exist in Sera. You can tell just by looking at the blessings that have been put into the Ultima.Especially if I am able to obtain high-level skills such as \u2018miracle\u2019 later on. I could be rest assured.Anyway, it must be a build that complements my goal of surviving till the end.\u2018And\u2026\u2019What follows immediately after this freshman welcome party is the \u2018Secret Society Storm\u2019, which is Chapter 1.So taking a major in sacred studies gives me a higher chance of receiving advantageous benefits. The chapter boss is particularly vulnerable to divinity.Currently, I have Percy's one-time 'request', the item to be obtained from the Vision Warehouse, and the skills inside the Ultima.[Skill: Fatal Charm has been Activated\u2026][\u2026 Skill ineffective! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dWhy are you still going?!As I was staring in bewilderment, Elnore quietly muttered next to me.\u201c\u2026So, don't do that.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI can't tell... Whether you're serious or not. Were you born this way?\u201dElnore brushed her hair as she spoke.The atmosphere is heavy.\u201cDo you know of the curse that resides in the Tristan Family?\u201dThe topic suddenly turned serious. As I was feeling a bit panicked, Elnore continued in a calm voice.\u201cIt's a type of madness that takes over everyone in the family, rendering them unable to live even half of the life they were given. The only way to control it is to suppress it through mental training. Do you know what's the only solution to such a terrible curse?\u201dI know.An angel\u2019s blessing.But it's not just the same humble blessing that the Ultima received. No, it would need a miracle-class blessing given by multiple archangels at the same time.That's something straight out of the creation myth. It's practically impossible.\u201cIt is that difficult. That's why, despite his achievements and prestige, Duke Tristan is never respected. Rather, he's just an object of fear where he can go mad and go on a slaughter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo why are you coming to me? What is your intention?\u201dThere is a slight chill in her voice. She's showing a lot more emotions than usual.She was suppressing her feelings because she doesn\u2019t know why I\u2019m approaching her.\u201cEven though I don't know you, I'm strangely conscious of you. When I heard that \u2018there's something you've been meaning to protect\u2019 which drove you to enter the Theology Faculty, I subconsciously wondered if it was me. You, who the heII are you? Just what are your intentions and what do you want from me-\u201dSeeing Elnore mutter sent chills down my spine.This was done by Fatal Charm and Pheromones. This got her all worked up.\u201c\u2026\u201dDoesn't this look a little dangerous?If left alone, it might crack her psyche and worsen the effects of madness.It's clear that my existence is having more influence on this person than I thought.\u201cMy intention is obvious.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMy words snapped Elnore out a bit.\u201c\u2026What do you mean obvious?\u201d\u201cI am trying to protect you. There\u2019s no need to think too hard.\u201dFor the situation, it's better to reveal my intention.Because my survival is directly related in protecting her psyche, and making sure that her mentality wouldn't collapse.It's technically not wrong.\u201c\u2026So what is the reason-\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t do that, I will die.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLike really. If I don\u2019t protect you, I will die. There is no other reason.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt's pure straight fact without any exaggeration.This is all I can say for now.Elnore blankly blinked her eyes with a dumbfounded expression.\u201c\u2026I felt it from the first time we met, but you are a very strange person.\u201d\u201cHaven't I told you? I hear that often.\u201dWith that reply, I stood up.Fortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem like Elnore is having any signs of mental collapse. I'm satisfied with the result-[ Skill: Fatal Charm has been conditionally Activated! ][ Great timing! You have planted foreshadowing that will make you explosively liked in the future! ][ The next time the skill is successfully activated, the effect will be tripled! ][ The possibility of awakening a second gift increased! ]\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2013I did something.What 'planted foreshadowing'?Why do these types of things keep popping up?It was fine not long ago, but now it's being weird again.I couldn't help but sigh inwardly, when...-!-!!-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Out of the blue, a huge explosion suddenly occurred.\u201c\u2026?\u201dNo, like it really is without warning.What is this?In an instant, heII let loose. The entire floor collapsed due to an explosion that erupted from the basement, and a huge hole appeared in the Berkeley Hall.\u201cIn the basement\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat in the world?!\u201dScreams and shouts were coming from every direction.It was a somewhat familiar sight. At the same time, my body went cold.\u2018This\u2026!\u2019The explosion was an intentional sabotage. The basement is where the monsters were being kept.Monsters were running rampant. Obviously, the \u2018main quest\u2019 event that takes place at the freshman welcome party is now underway. However, it\u2019s much bigger and more terrifying than I remember.In the first place, there was no huge explosion. At most, it was just a few monsters being released and going wild!I quickly checked the clone\u2019s location.

At best, he'll reply with an, \u2018En\u2019 or \u2018OK.\u2019Normally, she would feel a bit out of place, but she could never have known that there's an \u2018option\u2019 hindering her perception.\u2018\u2026How should I deal with an angry man?\u2019And fortunately for Dowd, she boasted the social capabilities of an ape when it came to dealing with the opposite sex.If it was work, she could slap some steel on her face and manage, but friends in equal footing? Her brain lags.Even if he's really angry, she can\u2019t do anything. After all, didn\u2019t she try to beat him up on their first meeting?It is a little strange that we would be angry about it at this time, but she also can't deny that it's a possibility.\u2018But if I dig a little deeper here, I might be able to get information about Duke Tristan\u2026\u2019Walking around with that thought in mind, she unknowingly arrived at the basement of Berkeley Hall at some point in time.They accidentally walked into a deserted place. They were the only ones around here right now.\u201cUwa\u2026\u201dElijah couldn't help but frown as she looked at the cages lying around.Inside were live monsters. They were obviously brought to the academy as research materials.\u2018There's even a medium-sized monster. Oh my gosh.\u2019At least a squad of regular knights must be dispatched to be able to deal with a medium-sized monster. It's not something you can just keep inside an academy full of students.\u201cThe faculty are also very irresponsible. No matter how special we are, this isn't worth it\u2026\u201dShe clicked her tongue and moved closer to the cage, bowing her head.Maybe it was because of that.The discovery of a monster caged in a location that would never be seen from the outside.\u201c\u2026\u201dEven before being fully aware of it, her brain, which had seen countless similar creatures in combat, had already completed its calculations.This.Exploded within seconds.\u201cSir, you have to avoid-!\u201dAs soon as she said that, a heat wave rose in front of her eyes.Elijah\u2019s body froze at the same time as the brightly approaching flames engulfed her vision.She normally would have been able to nimbly dodge.However, the pure white flame triggered something deep inside her memory.-Elijah, hide here, here! Never come out!-Damned devil followers, this way! Try killing me, you f*cking bi\u2020ches!Explosions. Flames. Screams. Stomps. Fishy smell. Burning family photo. The reflection of the blade flashing in the pool of stagnant blood. Dead bodies.\u201c\u2026!\u201dBut before she could shake off those images, the flames were already inches away from her.\u2018Danger\u2026!\u2019As that thought passed through her head.Someone ran into her.What followed is a violent collision with the floor. A groan came out of Elijah\u2019s mouth as she rolled several times.\u201cAh, aya\u2026\u201dFortunately or unfortunately, thanks to the intense pain, she was knocked off that dreamy state and regained normal thinking.It was thanks to Dowd Campbell, who was a mess, on top of her.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe had unsightly burns all over his back, a broken limb and stab wounds all over the body caused by shrapnels.It was a serious injury sustained from protecting her from the explosion. He could die if he's not treated immediately.\u201cSi, sir. Hold, hold on. Why, why did you do that?\u201dRecognizing that fact, she said in a trembling voice.Why, why the heII did he do that?Wasn't he acting angry at her just a while ago?Above all, didn\u2019t he say he liked Princess Tristan?He had no reason to do this for her, who's basically his pseudo-enemy.\u201c\u2026\u201dDowd Campbell, or rather the clone, lifted his head with difficulty and looked at her.If the clone wasn't equipped with an option, its existence was to just get the attention of the enemy and taking the blow.Clones purchased from the point shop are programmed with that intention.However, the clone with the \u2018Cold Gentleman\u2019 option applied decided that that's not a very cool thing to say.And so, what he said instead was...\u201cBecause that\u2019s what I have to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhile Elijah's eyes widened and was at a loss. Then, Dowd\u2019s clone was spread eagled on the floor, smiling contentedly.He must have thought to himself, just how cool and gentlemanly that exit was\u2026-!-!!However, Elijah\u2019s expression stiffened as she heard a series of not-so-gentle screams.The cages were destroyed by the explosion just now, so all the monsters inside them got released.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know what that means.\u201dElijah stood up while muttering.Checking her condition...She had several swollen joints, which would hinder her movements. She also had no weapon. At most, she could use the rebars from the debris.However, this was not a mock battle nor sparring, the opponents are real monsters. Not to mention that there's 6 of them.Considering that even one small monster could tear apart several adult men with ease, this is a number that could send even a regular knight running in fright.\u201c\u2026\u201dPerhaps Marquis Kendride, who imparted her combat skills, would be angry if he saw such a cowardly act.However, unfavorable fights should be avoided. There is no shame in retreating. This is something that needs to be emphasized again and again.However.\u201cHa.\u201dHer gaze returned to the man lying on the floor.Does he have some obsessive-compulsive disorder that compels him to dive right in when he sees someone in danger?It\u2019s not even funny as a joke.Elijah then took a potion from her belt.This was a high quality potion given by Marquis Kendride to be used in an emergency. It's so precious that even getting one a year is difficult.Normally, it's best to use it on herself and move forward from there.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut she unhesitatingly splashed it onto Dowd Campbell instead.\u201cIsn't it the hero's job to save people?\u201dSo.She can\u2019t let him die here.\u201cEueum\u2026\u201dNow, an injured body, 6 monsters.\u201cThis is nothing.\u201dEspecially so, when it comes to protecting someone.It really was this way for her.\u25cf<System Message>[ Main Quest Renewed! ][ Main Quest ][ Monster trouble! Keep the situation under control! ][ Heavy penalty will be imposed if there's too many casualties! ][ Reward: Exclusive Equipment Materials ]Why not just kiII me then?You unleash a bunch of monsters in a crowd of newbie freshmen and you want me to keep the casualties as low as possible?\u201cWait, where are we going!?\u201d\u201cI need to do something! President, please inform the priests!\u201dI replied to Elnore, who shouted when she saw me move in haste.\u201cWe need to protect the students!\u201dI shouted while moving.\u2018Priority first.\u2019While Elnore would bring the priests to treat the injured and reduce casualties, the most important thing is still the initial response. In the first place, we need to reduce the number of injured by reducing the number of monsters before they could get out of the basement.With that thought in mind, I hurriedly ran into the basement and saw an appalling scene.\u201c\u2026Uh.\u201dElijah was currently fighting. Surrounding her were monsters and my clone laying on the floor.Five of the six monsters had already been defeated, with the last one only needing the final blow.\u201c\u2026\u201dThese are not artificial monsters in a mock battle, but 5 real monsters and yet she dealt with all of them with just a piece of rebar?Is she still human?Well, in the first place, Elijah was not a character who will directly participate in battles. Before she awakens as a full-fledged hero, she's always on the somewhat calculated side.If she's fighting like this even before that, that means that there is someone she really wants to protect.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut wasn't there only my clone here?And why do I have an ominous feeling about this?\u2018\u2026Ahh, I don\u2019t know!\u2019I first retrieved the clone before she notices that there's two identical people.In the meantime, Elijah had delivered the finishing blow to the last monster. She let out a sigh, as she wiped the sweat off her forehead.\u201cWhew\u2026\u201dWith the clone now retrieved, our eyes meet as I sit idly by.\u201c\u2026!\u201dElijah's expression suddenly turned bright. Even though she was exhausted and unable to even lift an arm, she was proudly smiling.\u201c\u2026That's a relief.\u201d[ Favorability level of the target \u2018Elijah Krisanax\u2019 has changed! ][ Favorability level has been upgraded from \u2018Curiosity\u2019 to \u2018Interest\u2019! ][ Redeemable rewards will be added! ][ Chances of awakening the second gift has increased! ][She is an important character.

Quick!\u201dThe main quest comes first. I don\u2019t know how severe the penalty imposed in the scenario is, but I definitely want to avoid getting to that situation.When I urged her, Elijah helplessly patted her forehead in stupor.\u201cYou're really... Is this really just how you are?\u201dWith a sigh, she plopped on to the floor. Her stamina has reached its limit after defeating 6 monsters in a row with an injured body.\u201cI missed a medium rank monster. It's probably going to the first floor by now. If you go as fast as you can, you can probably catc\u2026\u201dShe was dozing off mid way through her sentence.\u201cThanks!\u201dShe probably didn't hear that. Anyways, I quickly dashed towards the first floor.With this cursed stamina, even just going up and down the stairs was difficult as heII. But I managed to push through with heavy breaths.Elfante had an \u2018isolation barrier\u2019 that's activated in the case of emergency.Currently, the nearby faculty and staff had evacuated the students inside and was barely maintaining the barrier.This was a wise decision.Since the combat personnel in the academy are probably already coming this way after hearing the chaos, staying put is much better than fighting. Rather, the latter would just lead to casualties.The problem is.-!-!!-!!!The barrier would constantly shake every time the medium rank, bear-like monster would smash it with its paws.And this is despite using all current means to reinforce the barrier.In the first place, even regular Knights need a good amount of preparation when facing medium rank monsters. Being able to hold out like this is already good.\u2018The priest\u2026!\u2019It would be ideal if Elnore managed to bring a priest with her.Due to the nature of their field, priests can reliably reinforce barriers. Even if there's only one priest, we can drag out the situation for time as long as we like.Breathlessly scouting the area, I finally spotted Elnore at the corner of my eyes.Seeing that she's with someone in a robe, she must have succeeded. She's indeed capable.\u201cWhat do you mean you can't reinforce the barrier\u2026!?\u201d\u201cI already told you. It takes an angel's blessing to prevent that, and it's su\u00a1cide to use it with your bare body.\u201d\u201cBut if it continues like this, people will\u2026!\u201d\u201cThen are you saying that I should go and kiII myself?\u201dHowever, judging from the bickering, it seems that things aren't going so well.\u2018\u2026So they aren't able to maintain the barrier?\u2019An academy professor level priest is able to conjure a similar level of blessing through prayer, even if it wasn't blessed by an angel.But in exchange, they have to pay the \u2018price\u2019. This is probably why that priest is arguing it's su\u00a1cidaI.This is also the reason why I purposely put the blessings I received on the Ultima and not on my body.If you put the blessing in an \u2018item\u2019, its effect might get reduced, but there would be no worry of repercussions. At this point in time, this is still a relatively unknown trick.\u2018But what's with his attitude?\u2019With that thought, I glared at the priest who continued the scuffle.In the first place, it makes no sense for a priest to not bring a Holy Relic, which is basically their heart, with them in an emergency like this.He's clearly making an excuse to not do it.Even with Elnore visibly angry, the priest remained still with his arms crossed. In fact, he was even sneering.\u2018In any case.\u2019This academy is a breeding ground for madmen. Thinking so, I approached the priest.\u201cDon't bring your political interests here! This is an emergency, people\u2019s lives are at stake!\u201d\u201cHa, this is why the Tristan Family\u2026\u201d\u201cThen give it to me.\u201dI said, interrupting his buIIshi\u2020.At this time, both Elnore and the priest looked at me.\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cYou're the type of person who highly values their life. Even without a Holy Relic, I know you have something prepared. If you won't activate the blessing, I will.\u201dThere was a moment of silence.\u201c\u2026Hey. Student, do you know what a divine blessing is\u2026\u201dAnnoyed to hear anything more, I roughly ripped off the small rosario from the priest. If I drag this out any longer, the barrier will break. Every minute, every second cannot be wasted.And before he can say anything, I had already turned around and dashed towards the Berkeley Hall.Meanwhile, Elnore was looking at me with wide eyes.However, I can't lie. I am a bit nervous.<System Message>[ Imminent favorability status change on target \u2018Elnore'. ][ You cannot abandon what you\u2019re trying to do! ][ Prepare yourself! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dI break out in a cold sweat. This message just doubled my anxiety.\u2018Ahh, I don\u2019t know! I'll think about it later!\u2019I already have a lot of things to take care of. Right now, if I don\u2019t focus on the main quest, I\u2019ll be in big trouble!I prepared the Ultima then slashed the Rosario on my left arm, drawing out blood.A bluish light enveloped the Rosario along with a burning pain. This was an emergency tool that all priests have in case of an emergency. After mixing it with blood, it can used as a small magic power battery.\u201cAlright.\u201dI let out a sigh and put the Rosario into the incense burner. The magic incense burner immediately reacted to it and began to emit blue light as well.[ Skill \u2018Penance\u2019 is available! ][ Skill \u2018Guardian Shield\u2019 is available! ]Right after checking the windows that popped out one after the other, I immediately threw myself between the medium rank monster and the barrier.\u201cWha-, what?\u201d\u201cStudent!

There\u2019s a high likelihood of deaths occuring because of the aftermath.All in all, it\u2019s best to entrust this job to the regular knights.Killing the monster now will do no good.Moreover, this just popped up in front of my eyes.< System Message >[ !Urgent Mission! ][ 0 current casualties, what a feat! ][ Since no one has died, let\u2019s try not to kill even the monster, shall we? ][ Successfully hand over the monster to the Knights of the Academy! ][ Upon successful completion, the level of the main quest reward, \u2018exclusive equipment materials\u2019, will increase! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dThis is the same as saying that a crazed murderer is also a person with a life and should be treated the same as their victims.However, the reward at stake is unmistakably attractive.It can be said that the materials used to craft exclusive equipment determine more than half of its performance. It is what determines the upper limit of how far it can grow.\u2018Well then.\u2019Let\u2019s just hold on.Thinking of this, I smiled at the monster which ferociously raised its front paw.That is a bone breaking strike if you are unlucky enough to get hit.\"\"But like what I did in the mock dungeon before, reading the attack patterns of \u2018monsters\u2019 is no different than flipping through a book, as a veteran gamer who had grinded countless hours into the game.So no fighting and just holding up the strong shield?\u2018I can do that with my eyes closed.\u2019So from here on out, it\u2019s just \u2018repetition\u2019.\u2026 Not a battle.\u25cfThe Tristan Duke Family is undoubtedly one of the most prestigious families in the empire since its inception. The title of a Duke alone was enough to intimidate people.However, that long line of history and popularity also comes with as many negativity.Even if there was no Marquis Kendride, there would still be people who would want the Duke Family\u2019s fall.And the priest was one of those snakes.\u201cDid you not hear what I said? Didn\u2019t I say that I didn\u2019t bring a Holy Relic?\u201dSuppressing the urge to slap the living shi\u2020 out of this high nosed middle-aged, Elnore calmly said.\u201c\u2026I am truly sorry for what happened to Marquis Riverback. The Tristan Family will definitely take relevant action-\u201d\u201cYou have no idea what you are talking about, do you?\u201dSparks flew out of Elnore\u2019s eyes at the mocking reply.He\u2019s basically saying that there is virtually no room for negotiation.The faculty members who strongly advocated bringing in living monsters and using them as research materials belonged to the Tristan faction.In other words, the greater the damage and casualties in an accident like this, the bigger the Tristan Family\u2019s liability.And this damn priest is under the command of Marquis Riverback, who belongs to the anti-Tristan faction.\u2018This f*cking trash\u2026!\u2019Knowing this context, this person is actually talking nonchalantly about sacrificing people\u2019s lives for political interest. This all the while he\u2019s acting as a priest.Anger welled up within Elnore.-\u2026She bit her lips, while clutching her chest.Her heart was getting very noisy.An insidious aura would rise whenever she\u2019s experiencing intense negative emotions. This was the product of the madness that runs in their family.\u2018\u2026Back off.\u2019She cooled herself down and regained her calm.She\u2019s been repeating this cycle throughout her life.Maintain discipline, act properly, always be perfect and never get carried away by insidious feelings.It\u2019s a principle I learned from that damned man, but it helped her suppress the evil energy whenever it creeps out.Though, her voice was still as cold as before, mixed with suppressed glacial anger.\u201cDon\u2019t bring your political interests here! This is an emergency, people\u2019s lives are at stake!\u201d\u201cHa, this is why the Tristan Family\u2026\u201d\u201cThen give it to me.\u201dElnore\u2019s eyes widened when she heard someone interrupt the priest who was trying to be sarcastic.It was Dowd Campbell.Again, this man.-\u2026-\u2026!Her heart began to beat louder. It\u2019s much worse than the anger she felt before.However, what she\u2019s feeling right now wasn\u2019t insidious emotions. Um, how do you describe it?Blood rushed to her face and her body felt light like she\u2019s in the clouds. It is a feeling that she has never experienced before in her life, so she has no choice but to be wary of it.\u2018Didn\u2019t I tell you to back off?\u2019She did the same thing.Never falter, never surrender to these feelings.Lately, it\u2019s been getting worse every time she sees that man. However, suppressing these types of emotions was normal for her.She can\u2019t let emotions be bigger than her.\u2018\u2026Back off. I will not lose.\u2019That\u2019s why, she has to suppress it.Watching Dowd sprint towards the monster after taking the priest\u2019s emergency tool strengthened that feeling even more. Nevertheless, she kept all those feelings locked inside her heart.That man\u2019s existence is growing on her too rapidly. Even Elnore herself is surprised by her behavior.It\u2019s dangerous if she gets dragged over-\u201cAngel\u2019s Blessing\u2026! How could a student, that mad man, do that!\u201dSuddenly, Elnore heard the priest murmur which made her turn her gaze towards Dowd.Blessing?Even a formal priest has to go through a long prayer to be able to use it, and a freshman uses it just like that?\u2018\u2026No.\u2019It\u2019s actually not particularly strange that that guy could use something like that.He has shown many times that he\u2019s hiding dozens of talents under that veil.While Elnore was thinking in a daze, she suddenly heard a frightened exclamation beside her.\u201c\u2026He\u2019s fine after using a blessing? How\u2026!?\u201dHearing the priest say that, Elnore\u2019s eyes also widened.Invoking a blessing without a Holy Relic will put a heavy load on the user\u2019s body and mind.But, somehow, isn\u2019t that man standing intact?\u201cWow. He knows that?\u201dElnore then turned to the newcomer. It was Elijah, who struck the priest in the back of the head, knocking him out.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I just took out the trash.\u201d\u201c\u2026Where were you?\u201d\u201cI fainted until a while ago, I just woke up.\u201dAfter her nonchalant reply, Elijah weakly sat down.\u201cThat\u2019s a method that combat priests often use. It\u2019s something you always have in your body and only use it when needed. It\u2019s a technique that can only be used after 10 years of practice. How did he know that?\u201dIf Dowd heard of this, he probably would have been speechless. He wouldn\u2019t use such a cumbersome and complicated method. He\u2019s literally just using the blessing he stored in an item.However, after hearing that, a new idea was forming in Elnore\u2019s head.10 years of studying divinity.\u2013There is something I want to learn in the Theology Faculty.Learning about blessings for a long time and pursuing the study upon entering the academy.Of all things, this field is the most direct way to lift the Tristan Family\u2019s curse.\u2013There\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to protect.Something\u2026, someone?There\u2019s someone I\u2019ve been meaning to protect.\u2013I am trying to protect you. There\u2019s no need to think too hard.And who is that \u2018you\u2019 again?-\u2026-\u2026!!!!!..{T/N: Will start uploading the novel to Foxaholic from now.}Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have to push it out.I know nothing of that man and what his intentions are. I\u2019m not even sure what he meant by that.\u2018Elnore, keep your mind straight-\u2018However, Elijah\u2019s voice pulled Elnore out from her concentration once again.\u201cHe favors you quite a lot.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s a blessing built into the body, it doesn\u2019t mean that there is no burden. That person must be pushing his limits right now.\u201dIf Dowd heard this, he\u2019d probably be too embarrassed and speechless to say anything.In terms of pain, the only discomfort he\u2019s experiencing is from his left arm, which he had slashed with the rosario.However, Elijah, who had no way of knowing such a fact, calmly continued.\u201cI mean there\u2019s no need to go through such risk when it can be finished in a minute.\u201d-\u2026!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My heart throbbed even more. Each beat started to sting.Elnore leaned slightly. She was getting short of breath.\u201c\u2026What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cIf there is a casualty under your jurisdiction, it will damage your reputation. Otherwise, why would he intentionally drag out the time by not fighting to kill? Look.\u201dElnore could barely open her eyes and looked towards Dowd.And, on the other side, was a one-sided abuse. Yes, an abuse since it\u2019s too embarrassing to even call it a battle.\"\"Dodging, blocking, and bouncing back all the attacks with minimal movements. Dowd was reading every attack of the monster.It was the same as what happened in the mock battle. It\u2019s as if he knows everything, down to the smallest of things, about the opponent.\u201cA person who could do that much would have been able to kill it a long time ago, don\u2019t you think? There\u2019s no point in helping.\u201dThat\u2019s true.But still.\u201c\u2026There\u2019s no reason to do something like that.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there?\u201dElijah replied with a smile.Elnore was biting her lips until blood came out. She also remembered something.-I, quite like that person.Elnore bit her lip harder and managed to shake that thought off.She then took a step forward, preparing to draw her sword.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026if what you said is true, then that man is putting himself in pain. I\u2019ll go and help.\u201dThat\u2019s what she thought.However, Dowd motioned her away.\u2018\u2026Why?\u2019Elijah giggled seeing her bewildered.\u201cIya, how romantic. Is he catching the sword for you?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s telling you not to come because you might get hurt.\u201dHeat suddenly surged from Elnore\u2019s heart.It was not the usual sinister energy, but a surprisingly hot feeling.It felt like someone had lit a fire into her veins.\u201c\u2026what you said, everything, could just be speculation.\u201dElijah turned to Elnore bewildered.Her eyes were asking, does it really sound like that even after everything?\u201cEven if you can kill a medium rank monster, it won\u2019t die gracefully. Sometimes, there are crazy individuals whose corpses explode due to the reversal of magic power. That person probably took that into account, hence putting that much burden on himself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElijah shook her head and let out a deep sigh.\u201cFor you.\u201d-\u2026!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My heart pounded like crazy and I could feel my breath rolling deeper.\u2018Must, control\u2026\u2019No.You can\u2019t, Elnore.I repeatedly reminded myself.-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In the end, I couldn\u2019t control that \u2018heat\u2019.I could feel it spreading throughout my body.I missed it. I lost the initiative.I have been conquered.\u2018\u2026\u2019In that moment, I intuitively realized.That from now on, whenever I see that man, I will feel this kind of emotion.I slumped down on the ground.It was a depressing curled posture with my knees together and hugging them.\u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201d\"\"\u201cKeep your mouth shut. Don\u2019t talk to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElijah was looking at her like some crazy person, but Elnore had no intention of talking.A shard of glass jutted out of the surrounding mess, reflecting her face.Wearing an expression that everyone thought she\u2019s incapable of displaying, her entire face turned red.To the point where she\u2019s an entirely different person.\u201c\u2026\u201dElnore was solely focused at the man in front.Finally, the dispatched regular knights arrived, followed by loud noises erupting from all directions.Elnore, however, remained mesmerized at his face.\u25cf<System Message>[ Urgent Mission Completed! ][ The main quest reward level will increase! ]I received a pleasant message after somehow finishing the battle and succeeding in guiding the monster to the regular knights.But the reason why I can\u2019t celebrate was because of what followed after it.[ Skill: Fatal Charm has been Activated! ][ The villain resists! ][ \u2018Pheromone\u2019 lowered the resistance! ][ Resistance failed! ][ The villain can\u2019t control herself! ][ The villain has been charmed! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dI was bathed in cold sweat.[ Favorability status change will occur on the target \u2018Elnore Elinalise La Tristan\u2019! ][ The favorability level has been upgraded from \u2018Trust\u2019 to \u2018Love\u2019! ][ Rewards Available! ][ She is an important character.

Just know that I\u2019m in deep shi\u2020.Following Elijah, changes will now occur in the main scenario. I don\u2019t know what the gift is, but I\u2019ll be getting another soon.In addition, an unidentified character took an interest in me.\u2018I\u2019m f*cked\u2026!\u2019I got nothing else to say other than this.While I was mulling over my fate, a knight came up to me and handed me a bottle of water.\u201cGood work out there. Here, want some? You look a little tired.\u201dHe is one of the knights dispatched to subdue the monster.\u2018\u2026it was a monster.\u2019It was almost terrifying to see the three of them clean up a medium rank beast in just a few seconds.This shows the power of the regular knights that the students aspire.\u201cStudent, I cannot praise you enough. If it wasn\u2019t for you, who knows how many casualties there would have been.\u201dSeeing that he even tapped me on the shoulder apart from the already kind words, it seemed that he was treating me kindly.It was a big deal for a regular knight to treat a student with this much respect.\u201cYou\u2019d be catching eyes anywhere with that kind of skill. Better keep your eyes open at all times, alright? By the way, are you an aspiring Theology major?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. I am indeed planning on taking up Theology.\u201dI answered before pointing to one side where the hero and final boss were.They were trying to rip off the head of the priest that had refused to use the blessing earlier.\u201cAlso, can you lend them a hand over there? If you leave them alone, they might really start killing.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, he seems like a rat so it doesn\u2019t really matter if he dies. But looking at you, I guess it is true that people with good talent have a good character, am I right?\u201dNo, actually, I do not have such a pure intention.Rather, I was thinking of a way to make use of that priest.Uh.It\u2019s better to get some use out of something rather than just disposing of them.\u201cOh, I almost forgot. Take this.\u201dThe knight then handed me a letter.\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I\u2019m told that you should open it alone.\u201dI let out a sigh as I watched the knight leave to continue his duties.Another letter?As I pondered, another window popped up in front of my eyes.[ Main Quest Complete! ][ Go to the designated location to claim your reward! ][ Location: Atallante Swansong\u2019s Office ]I am no stranger to the name Atallante Swansong.Because she is the current president of Elfante Academy.She\u2019s rumored to be an immortal who have lived for over a thousand years.

That he could cut away the day, turning the \u201cmorning\u201d into \u201cevening\u201d\u2026That same person created the Tristan Style Swordsmanship that I am using.It\u2019s a ridiculous story. Hence why, it\u2019s just a \u2018legend\u2019 with no indication of it actually happening.\u2018But that\u2019s probably not the case.\u2019Considering the strength of the Eternal in front of me, it could be said that the story was handed down without exaggeration.Atallante Swansong.An Eternal who was granted the power of \u201cimmortality\u201d. She\u2019s famous not only in the empire, but throughout the continent.\u201cOh, student. You\u2019re early.\u201dHowever, such a legendary existence looks no different than a short girl.Looking at the vitality flowing through her violet-colored hair and eyes, no one would be able to tell that this is a thousand-year-old monster-\u201cStudent?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dI hastily took my seat upon hearing that voice.\u201cThank you for accepting my sudden invitation, you must have been surprised.\u201dShe had a kind tone and smile. Probably to smoothen the conversation.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut I know what kind of person Atallante is.Despite having lived for a thousand years, she hates wasting time more than anyone else.If she decided to have a \u2018sit down\u2019 with me, that means that she had an equally important business.\u201cDo you know why I called you here, Dowd Campbell?\u201d\u201cI am uncertain.\u201d\u201cI have some bad news, and even worse news. Which one would you like to hear first?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhy isn\u2019t there anything good?\u201cLet\u2019s start with the bad first.\u201d\u201cHmm~ Student Dowd Campbell has already been involved in several incidents even before being assigned to a class.\u201dThe President then put on a monocle and looked through some documents. Is there a record of my involvements?\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t intentionally participate nor cause any of those incidents.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it jarring. In Elfante\u2019s long history, we\u2019ve had all sorts of students. But I have never seen a student causing such a stir before their first class.\u201dAfter saying that, Atallante let out a deep sigh.\u201cBut it\u2019s also talent to always be able to get out of it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Why is this \u2018bad\u2019 news?\u201dAll she did was praise.To this, Atallante replied with a smile.\u201cHaving bad luck means that you will be caught up in another incident in the future. So that\u2019s bad news.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThat\u2026 I can\u2019t refute.\u201cAnd that misfortune leads to the worse news.\u201dAtallante took off her monocle and rested her chin on her hands with a grin.\u201cStudent, by any chance\u2026\u201dHowever.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHow much do you know about the devil?\u201dThe gaze that came with that sentence was not at all amused.\u25cfAtallante was interested to know what kind of person Dowd Campbell was.Despite knowing almost everything that happens within the academy, he was still a mystery.At least, his current look is implying that.\u2018Interesting reaction.\u2019Atallante smiled inwardly as she looked at Dowd Campbell, whose expression did not change despite saying such a sentence.Ordinary students would\u2019ve been frozen just by the mere fact that they are alone with the President. They would feel intimidated just from the sheer difference in status.On the other hand, this man?\u2018He\u2019s not even nervous.\u2019Despite the fact that the President herself brought up the ominous topic of \u2018the devil\u2019, his expression did not change.Rather, he seemed to be in deep thought.It\u2019s like he\u2019s considering what would be the best answer in the current situation.\u2018With this, his emergency response passed.\u2019As a seasoned veteran, she didn\u2019t need to think too hard when evaluating something.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to tell about how much I know.\u201dBut Dowd\u2019s answer was unexpected.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do with that information.\u201dAtallante couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201c\u2026You don\u2019t like it?\u201dIn fact, it\u2019s not hard to know that there\u2019s some plotting going on. It\u2019s already been shown several times.Imagine, you still haven\u2019t been assigned to a class while all the other students already started with theirs. Naturally, that would raise some suspicions.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to like it knowing that I\u2019m being manipulated.\u201dHowever.She didn\u2019t expect one of those specific \u2018means\u2019 to be mentioned.Atallante\u2019s eyes narrowed and asked back.\u201c\u2026What did you say?\u201d\u201cAs you mentioned earlier, I have been involved in several large-scale cases. With so many eyes watching, there\u2019s bound to be rumors one way or another.\u201dDowd Campbell calmly continued.\u201cThe hegemonic powers are currently in the midst of chaos. It wouldn\u2019t be strange for numerous people to contact me at this time. Everyone is trying to reel in shining talents by hook or crook.\u201dIndeed, there are such news all over.Tribal Union\u2019s coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, huge organizational changes in the Holy Land. Power struggle over the throne, etc.The continent was in turmoil.The same goes for the Golden Triangle.On the surface, they are good neighbors living in harmony and helping each other, but behind the scenes, they are engaged in a fierce competition to recruit the best talent.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, this is by no means something that a mere student can obtain, analyze, and logically infer information on their own.Even more so if it was the son of a baron who did not have the right to access such advanced information.And yet, this man is casually talking about such things.Like it was a natural thing.Atallante smiled inwardly.\u201cHowever, there\u2019s nothing but crickets. All I can say is that someone is artificially suppressing information about me. Or\u2026\u201d\u201cOr?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a step further and everyone is collectively pretending not to know. I don\u2019t why or how you would do that.\u201dIf Atallante didn\u2019t have a reputation to uphold, she would\u2019ve stood up and began clapping like a seal.It was an accurate judgment. He was excellent at weighing information and situations, and filling in the gaps.\u2018Political sense, also a pass!\u2019In fact, Dowd occupied an important position in future \u2018plans\u2019. Atallante was worried if he was lacking in a lot of things, but now, she\u2019s not disappointed at least.No, rather, she was pleased that a jewel of this level was discovered among the students.It\u2019s probably because of her excitement from meeting a talent, but she unconsciously leaked things she shouldn\u2019t have at the current \u2018stage\u2019 of the plan.\u201cFirst of all, I would like to apologize about controlling the information. But I want you to know that it is an essential part.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is it a big deal if I stand out?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAtallante continued with a smile on her face.\u201cThe world will end.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But it won\u2019t happen right away just because rumors are spreading. However, there is no doubt that the chances of that happening will increase.\u201d\u201c\u2026the end of the world, no, just what are you talking about\u2026?\u201d\u201cFor now, just focus on school life. Anyways, you\u2019ll find out sooner or later. The academy is also doing its best to prevent that.\u201dHaving said that, she handed Dowd a piece of paper with a smile.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a look at this first?\u201dIt contained a big symbol.\u201cI asked you about the devil earlier, right? It\u2019s because of this.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThis is the symbol of a group called the \u2018Purifier\u2019 .\u201dDowd\u2019s expression turned solemn.\u2018He knew this too?\u2019Thinking so, Atallante calmly continued.\u201cIt\u2019s not well known to the public, but they\u2019re a pretty infamous group of devil worshipers. They\u2019ve been identified to be the one behind for Princess\u2019 Tristan\u2019s attempted assassination and the monster sabotage.\u201dDevil worshipers.Like the name suggests, it\u2019s a group of people that worship the devil, the enemy of all mankind, as a God and gunning for its ressurection.Their existence is like that of a cancerous tumor to society.\u201cWith already two attacks on the Princess, there is no guarantee that there will not be a third.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why are you telling me this?\u201dBut instead of answering, Atallante just wore a mysterious smile.She\u2019s already given enough information about the plan. She can\u2019t say any more than this.Thinking so, she took something out of the drawer.If she can\u2019t tell him the details, shouldn\u2019t she at least show her sincerity?\u201cWould you like to take this?\u201dIt was a small black \u2018card\u2019. On the surface, it looked nondescript, but Dowd\u2019s eyes widened when he saw it.He was being quite expressive.\u2018\u2026Does he know what this is?\u2019As she was thinking that, she heard from the other side.\u201c\u2026Is it okay for the President to just hand out things like this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAtallante paused for a moment. His words was implying that even the president shouldn\u2019t just give away something this valuable to others.Does he really know what it is?No, there\u2019s no way.Even within the academy, this is something that only a very few people, including her, know about. If he knows what this is, it\u2019s not just simply about being smart to put pieces of info together. It\u2019s almost psychic.\u2018But, maybe.\u2019Atallante asked once more with some anticipation.\u201cYou sound like you know what it is?\u201d\u201cThis, in a week\u2019s time, at the Gregory Hall-\u201dDowd couldn\u2019t speak any further.It was because Atallante burst out laughing at such a natural answer.\u2018Ah, truly, a fine piece.\u2019This man always subverts her expectations.She couldn\u2019t remember when was the last time she met someone like this.\u201cJust take it. People with as much bad luck as you will need it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMoreover, he\u2019s entertained her this much, she should give him a reward.\u201cIf you know what it is, then you should know it works. Use it properly, get what you need and then show me the result. If I like it, I\u2019ll give you an additional gift. Alright?\u201dDowd took the card in a daze, as she said with a wink.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve never thought of receiving homework from the President.\u201d\u201cOh, speaking of. I actually have a homework for you.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHow are you getting along with the hero candidate and Princess Tristan?\u201dDowd\u2019s expression terribly twisted. To the extent that even Atallante herself was taken aback.This was a man who didn\u2019t even flinch when hearing devil worshippers attack the academy.\u201c\u2026Well, I\u2019d love to, I really do.\u201dMeanwhile, his body was screaming that he doesn\u2019t want to get involved with them.\u201cThen try to get along well with them.\u201dNevertheless, she had no choice but to leave these words.\u201cIs there any reason why it must be so?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe replied with a soft smile.\u201cThe world will end, otherwise.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe couldn\u2019t help but laugh again seeing Dowd\u2019s stare that says, \u201cIs the end of the world so easy?\u201dWell, this wasn\u2019t a lie either.In the end.The ultimate goal of the plan would be achieved through these three people.\u25cf\u201cThe end of the world\u2026\u201dI aimlessly walked, while repeating what I heard from Atallante earlier.In truth, I don\u2019t quite understand what it means. Simply because it\u2019s such a grandiose scale.In the game, the end of the world is the bad ending. I don\u2019t see nor feel anything on how my actions now influence it.\u2018\u2026Let\u2019s think about this later.\u2019Rather than that.\u201cI got this.\u201dI looked at the black card in my hand.This is a kind of \u2018key\u2019 that opens the \u2018door\u02bc to another world.This is something that is never given to the player character. In fact, even within the Academy faculty, only those as high up as the Dean or President are aware of its existence.And I think I know why the production team made it that way.If they give you something like this from the beginning, it could completely ruin the balance of the game.I didn\u2019t expect to receive this so suddenly. Is it because I successfully completed the main quest and emergency mission?\u201c\u2026\u201dBut that doesn\u2019t mean I like this development.\u2018The main scenario is out of order.\u2019The Purifier is only supposed to appear a few months later. Those who haven\u2019t even had their class sorted shouldn\u2019t have heard this information.The scenario is progressing much faster than expected.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn other words, I also need to grow as fast as possible.It\u2019s the point where the main character and the final boss intertwine. Whether I like it or not, it\u2019s obvious that I\u2019ll get involved in the scenario in one way or another.I took a deep breath and organized my thoughts.Chapter 1, \u2018Secret Society Storm\u2019s\u02bc big boss \u2018Purifier\u2019 is quite tricky.They\u2019re a notoriously vicious early boss, so much so that they gained the moniker of \u2018newbie cutter\u2019.Even with [Desperation] , considering their \u2018speciality\u2019\u2026 I could really die.\u2018But with this\u2026\u2019\"\"I turned the black card over in my palm.Things could be a lot easier than I thought.It all depends on how I use the materials I get from the space that I\u2019ll enter using this.I organized the ways I can utilize.The Monster Research Department, the access to the Vision Warehouse and Percy\u2019s one-time request ticket. If I use them all strategically\u2026\u2018\u2026It\u2019s possible.\u2019I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something I can create that will make the Purifier boss fight go smoothly.\u201cAh, here you are. I was looking for you.\u201dAs I was walking down the hallway, I suddenly someone calling me which snapped me out of my thoughts.It was the Knight Faculty Dean, Conrad Baltador.\u201cYou were looking for me? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cYour class is still undecided, but there was a notice from the Academic Affairs Committee that you can\u2019t fall behind because of that. Take this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Dean was telling me this himself.Am I so special for them to treat me like this?\u201cIt\u2019s a temporary class. You can take classes together with these students starting tomorrow.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNo.Alright.Got it.Are you kidding me?\u201c\u2026Is this correct?\u201d\u201cIs there anything wrong?\u201dUh, there is.With trembling hands, I pointed to the list of students.Class President. Elnore Elinalise La Tristan.Vice President. Elijah Krisanax.I don\u2019t need to look at the other students. I can already smell the scent of doom just from these two names.Why am I being put into the same class as these two, of all people?\u201cIs this correct?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy is the Student Council President taking classes with the freshmen\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh, right. About that.\u201dThen Conrad said with a cool smile.\u201cIt\u2019s the President\u2019s order, so it can\u2019t be wrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, I remember her talking about some homework.Try to get along well with them.\u2018I suddenly had the urge to kill someone, that hag.\u2019It mean it.\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022\u00d7\u2022{T/N: *translation error fix* Magic Research Department to Monster Research Department}Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There\u2019s really no need to listen to it.\u201cProfessor, I have a question.\u201dAnd the fact that it\u2019s the most basic also goes hand in hand on why on earth is this person is taking this class.The blood drained from the professor\u2019s face when the expressionless Elnore, who was to my left, raised her hand.\u201cOf course, what is your concern, Princess Tristan?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think the theory is too lengthy? All of that knowledge doesn\u2019t work much in real combat.\u201d\u201cI apologize. I will correct it.\u201dThe professor stiffly laughed and said that.It was a very bizarre sight, where the student casually commenting on the class with the professor agreeing, but no one refuted it.If it\u2019s Princess Tristan, no one would dare to point that out.Nobody.Except for one.\u201cUh, I was listening?\u201dElijah to my right retorted with a smile.She didn\u2019t look intimidated by Elnore\u2019s cool gaze at all.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t tell me you think that this kind of tabletop conversation is helpful in actual combat?\u201d\u201cClasses are at the discretion of the professor. You are not \u2018forced\u2019 to attend.\u201dElnore closed her mouth in displeasure.Unlike Elijah, who is a freshman like me, Elnore knew that she didn\u2019t need to be here.From what I heard from Atallante, Elnore \u2018wanted\u2019 to join the class. \u201cPut me with him,\u201d she said.\u201cBut even if it\u2019s a basic class, it should be more practical than this-\u201c\u201cNow that\u2019s just biased to one opinion-\u201dThe war of words intensifies.The professor who should be leading the class was left unable to say anything; not against the next hero candidate and the Duke\u2019s daughter.\u201cThen what do you think?\u201d\u201cYeah. What do you think, professor?\u201dAnd thus, this is why I feel like dying.They went back and forth between each, before eventually throwing the bomb at me.\u201c\u2026I think it\u2019s better to continue the class for now.\u201dThe professor looked so pitiful shivering and turning blue in front. So I went with this for now.With this, Elnore\u2019s brows slightly furrowed while bright smile blossomed on Elijah\u2019s face. The professor also let out a relieved smile.\u201cAlright, one more win.\u201d\u201c\u2026I lost again.\u201dI massaged my forehead as I listened to the murmurs around.These two have been doing this throughout the entire class.They discuss the content among themselves and ask me for my opinion at the end. They then decide and tally up the wins or loss based on which side \u2018I sided with\u2019.Every time, the winner would be deathly overjoyed, while the loser looked like they\u2019re falling apart. It was ridiculous.What the hell does my words mean to you\u2026?Why are you doing this to me\u2026?\u201c\u2026\u201dBecause of this, the other students are looking at me even weirder than it already is.They\u2019re probably thinking like, \u2018who is this guy to be treated like that by the hero candidate and the princess?\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know either.\u2019Uh, I really don\u2019t know.At least, it can be seen from this that the academy is suppressing information about me well. Some don\u2019t even know me and was just confused on what\u2019s happening.In other words, Elfante was extremely attentive to my activities.\u2018\u2026If something goes wrong, they\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019So let\u2019s just do what I need to do and distract myself.As the professor resumed the lecture, I turned my gaze to the window floating in front of me.< Gift-related Character Notification >\u2665 Elnore Elinalise La Tristan[ Trust Level 5 ] >>> [ Love Level 1 ][ Rewards Available! ]\u25bc Elijah Krisanax[ Curiosity Level 5 ] >>> [ Interest Level 1 ]\"\"[ Rewards Available! ]I then opened the rewards tab.[ Received Gift Reward from \u2018Elnore\u2019. ][ \u2018Attribute: Breathing Technique \u2013 Duckweed has been obtained\u2019! ]< Mastery Info >[ Attribute: Tristan Style Swordsmanship ] [ Grade: Basic ][ Current Proficiency: 58% ][ Master Sword Technique of the Tristan Duke Family. ][ \u25a0 Can exert a certain level of power regardless of weapon. ][ Attribute: Breathing Technique \u2013 Duckweed ] [ Grade: Basic ][ \u25a0 A breathing method that dramatically increases the body\u2019s endurance and strength when trained for a long time.

So even if you managed to land a hit, you\u2019re nowhere near of knocking her down.In terms of body-related techniques, it can be regarded as a combination with the highest efficiency.And then\u2026[ Received Gift Reward from \u2018Elijah\u2019. ][ Obtained 2,000 points! ][ Current Points: 2,000pts]Instead of something special, Elijah just gave me points.

But it sharing a history with Atallante, an Eternal, meant that it\u2019s far from ordinary.The forest harbored all kinds of beasts, magical plants, and rare minerals.Some could literally kill you.At this time, Elnore and Elijah also finally quieted down.It could be that they got tired from constantly fighting. But the real reason was that there\u2019s no arguing here, not with the one in charge of the class.\u201cWelcome, chicks.\u201dConrad spoke indifferently.However, facing the Knights Faculty Dean, the freshmen were visibly nervous.After all, anyone with some knowledge of the state of Elfante knew the notoriety of this class.\u201cSurvival science is the product of practical combat skills gathered by miners and dungeon explorers. If you don\u2019t want to die, pay attention.\u201dThe Dean\u2019s appearance was not at all exciting. Moreover, talking about death right off the bat doesn\u2019t exactly help with the heavy atmosphere.However, for generations, it was customary for the Dean to lead the first class. There was no way around it.You can clearly tell that this was an important subject. In fact, some students\u2019 eyes were gleaming eagerly because of the extra hiring credit, which is especially advantageous in the Imperial Family recruitment.\u201cThe task is simple.\u201dBut Conrad\u2019s following words immediately doused those passionate flames.\u201cBring me something I like from the forest. I\u2019ll give you all 10 minutes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, and also, just scream loudly if you feel like you\u2019re about die. I\u2019ll come and save you.

I\u2019ll be fine.\u201dUh, like legit, she can\u2019t be with me.Elijah needs to get acquainted with the main character party right away.As the only saviors of the world, they need to grow powerful as soon as possible.I\u2019ll only be hindering them if I tag along.\u201cAnd we\u2019re not that close, are we?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElijah pouted discontentedly at my remark.\u201c\u2026This makes me sad, really. Ah, Whatever!\u201dShe left.She looked angry.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dI then heard someone calling me from the side.When I turned to look, I saw a handsome blonde haired man, who\u2019s oozing with a model student aura.\u2018Ah right, there was this character.\u2019I instantly remembered who this guy was from the spear on his back.Tallion Armand.He\u2019s the eldest son of Armand, an honest viscount. Among this year\u2019s freshmen, he was undoubtedly a standout talent.I remember him being a perfect character in the game. Unblemished regardless of the degree of scrutiny.Integrity. Humility. Composure. Disciplined.And his skills were just right below Elijah.This was why he got his own fan club despite being a freshman.More importantly.\u2018\u2026 Wasn\u2019t he the mid-boss of Chapter 1?\u2019This guy will get corrupted from some kind of accident and turn into a boss.I didn\u2019t expect to meet him this way.\u2018But why is he here?\u2019Just as I tilted my head in wonder, Tallion soon cleared my doubts.\u201cYou, what\u2019s your relationship with the hero candidate?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Uh?\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but make a confused noise.No, I didn\u2019t mean to do that, it\u2019s just that I can\u2019t guess his intentions.\u201cWhat do you mean?

Even if it\u2019s just once, he wanted to be her equal.\u201cI guess it\u2019s because she wanted to be friends?\u201dThe corner of his eye twitched when I told him the truth.\u201c\u2026 To someone called a fraud?\u201dHis tone became a bit aggressive.At the same time, my eyes widened but it\u2019s not because of this guy\u2019s change.< System Message >[ A character with a good alignment was enraged by your influence! ][ Some gift conditions have been met! ]Rather, it\u2019s because of the system window that popped up in front me.\u2018Is this how it works?\u2019Basically, the more I make this guy angry, the more likely I get rewarded?So \u2018negative tendency\u2019 include anger.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe cogs in my brain began to quickly turn.I could kill two birds with one stone.

There\u2019s also no proof that the sparring between you and the hero candidate isn\u2019t a fake, is there?\u201dIt looks like the academy is doing a good job.Despite having stood out multiple times in incidents, I could still maintain a degree of awareness among the students.\u201cAs I\u2019ve said.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but smile bitterly inside. I especially appreciate that awareness now.\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but she wanted to be friends that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dBecause I can really rile him up with this.\u201cIs it because you feel hard-stuck after seeing the person you made your goal got defeated in one hit?

His gaze was focused on the bluish rocks scattered nearby.\u201cIt\u2019s a rare mineral deposit. We shouldn\u2019t get a low score if we take a couple.\u201d\u201cOh, then let Luca handle it.\u201d\u201c\u2026come and help, Grid.\u201dAs the reluctant Grid got dragged along, Trisha approached Elijah.Elijah was just silent and seemed lost in her thoughts.Even now, her emotions were still churning with insidious colors. Finally, Trisha could no longer bear to watch on the side.\"\"\u201cHey, Elijah.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cIs something bothering you?\u201dTrisha cautiously inquired, but Elijah only shook her head and smiled.\u201cNo, none at all.\u201dLie.The dark energy welled up as she said that.\u201cI am here if anything is troubling you. I don\u2019t want you to take it all on your own.\u201d\u201cEh, you\u2019re my friend. Of course I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\u2026 Lie.Trisha broke out in a cold sweat.Emotions reflect a person\u2019s disposition. Using her ability, she\u2019s able to observe its color and roughly guess people\u2019s \u2018personality\u2019.\"\"Now, if Trisha were to say the most unique people she\u2019s seen as of late, it would be none other than Princess Tristan and Elijah.The Princess\u2019 color was basically a gray of nothingness. However, black matter would surface from time to time. It was like sticky ink, that\u2019s how dark it was.But it looked like she\u2019s suppressing it.\u2018\u2026 I\u2019ve seen it a few times.\u2019Although not common among the general populace, it isn\u2019t strange to see from someone in the Tristan Family.Elijah on the other hand.\u2018Truly, strange.\u2019Evil people naturally radiate negative emotions.However, Elijah had always been a color close to pure white. But now, Trisha was shocked to discover dark colors mixing in.Possessiveness, dominance, monopoly, something like that.It was as if whenever Elijah thought of a \u2018certain person\u2019, it would come out.Perhaps, even Elijah herself is not aware of this.\u2018\u2026 It\u2019s definitely not like this before.\u2019It felt like this all started after the freshmen welcome party incident. Fortunately, the monsters were subdued without any casualties.What exactly happened there?\u201cBut you look like you\u2019re thinking about something.\u201d\u2018More importantly, you\u2019re so angry that it\u2019s literally changing your very colors.\u2019Trisha wouldn\u2019t be able to be at peace if she doesn\u2019t appease Elijah.\u201c\u2026 Was I too obvious? As expected, nothing can really go through you Trisha.\u201dAh, she\u2019s starting to open up.When she saw the white light shining within Elijah, Trisha couldn\u2019t help but smile in relief.She then started to wrack her brains to keep the conversation going.\u2018At what point did Elijah got so angry\u2026?\u2019\u201cAh, by any chance, that Dowd Campbell-\u201cHowever, Trisha immediately shut her mouth before she could even finish her sentence.It\u2019s because she saw Elijah\u2019s emotion quickly getting stained with darkness again.What made it scarier was the fact that Elijah still had a wide smile on her face.\u201cWell, I suppose I guessed correctly.\u201dFortunately, she seemed willing to share her thoughts.\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that, I\u2019ve been involved with him lately\u2026\u201dElijah then continued to tell one story after the other.From how she asked him to become friends to her owing him. So recently, she\u2019s been acting like a love pigeon to the person he liked. She even went as far as breaking her own principles because \u2018that person\u2019 is from the Tristan Family, her enemy. And yet, she\u2019s been dismissed as not even a friend\u2026Seeing Elijah pouring out such a steady flow of sentences made Trisha blinked blankly a few times.This, could it be.\u201cElijah, do you think of that person as a real friend?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Uh?\u201dTrisha was shocked by Elijah\u2019s unprepared response and hurriedly shut her mouth.She saw Elijah\u2019s emotions getting mixed up and unknowingly blurted out such words.Her emotions didn\u2019t budge, regardless of the situation, when they\u2019re together.\u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dTrisha was feeling a suffocating tension from Elijah\u2019s silence.This was the first time she\u2019s seen her hesitate. It\u2019s as if she had never thought of this before. Inside, her already muddled emotions became murkier by the second.\u201c\u2026But, he drew the line because we\u2019re not that close?\u201dAs Elijah struggled to come up with an answer, Trisha\u2019s face became more contemplative.Elijah\u2019s normally white colored emotions were creeping into a gloomy mess.She has to say something here\u2026!\u201cI, I\u2019m sure that person didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d\u201cThen why did he say that?\u201d\u2018How would I know?\u2019But she can\u2019t possibly say this.\u201cUh, it, isn\u2019t it because he\u2019s being considerate for you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Considerate?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that Dowd from a small barony with no backing? He probably thought that if he sticks to you, who\u2019s the hero candidate, it\u2019ll bring you a lot of trouble. Many will definitely get dissatisfied with it\u2026! So, he\u2019s preventing that from happening now\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dTrisha managed to squeeze out an excuse.And although the rationale was weak, at least she\u2019s not wrong.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt even made Elijah think about it, her hand on her chin while pondering.\u201c\u2026Is it necessary to go that far? No, he is the kind of person that does things without saying anything\u2026 But still, it\u2019s only between friends\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can see it for yourself the next time. He\u2019ll definitely say that he didn\u2019t mean it when he said you weren\u2019t close! Eun!\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll draw a line with you until his status become a bit more stable! Deep inside, he probably feels very close with you\u2026! Yep, that\u2019s it\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201dPlease stop asking more questions.Please understand and let your anger go.Trisha hopefully thought.\u201cOh, wait. Isn\u2019t that Tallion?\u201dFortunately for Trisha, she was saved by these words from the men gathering minerals next to them.\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cAbout a 30-minute walk from here.\u201d\u201c\u2026You can see that, Grid?\u201dIt was Grid who spoke, as he was staring into the distance.As a long-range marksman, his eyesight was naturally very good.\u201cBy Tallion\u2026 you mean Viscount Armand\u2019s son? They\u2019re good at using spears, right?\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s a bit strange. I\u2019ve never seen him so angry. And is he muttering curses?\u201d\u201c\u2026He\u2019s cursing?\u201d\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s see\u2026\u201dGrid frowned and focused on Tallion\u2019s mouth.\u201c\u2026I swear. I\u2019ll kill that bastard. I\u2019ll kill that dog scammer. I\u2019mma kill him. I\u2019ll turn you to a skewer\u2026 Wow, how bloody.\u201dEveryone\u2019s heads turned at Grid\u2019s words.Tallion Armand was known as the epitome of human excellence and restraint. The most perfect role model.What made such a person be this angry during class?\u201c\u2026\u201dThere\u2019s only one.Elijah flinched upon hearing the word, \u2018scammer\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How about that?\u201d[ Danger Escalated. ][ Determined as attempt to seriously injure. ][ Skill: Desperation raised to B Class. ]\u201c\u2026\u201dWell that didn\u2019t work.I wasn\u2019t even trying to agitate him this time.Right now, I just kept running away from the angry, demonic Tallion.\u2018\u2026But won\u2019t I eventually get caught like this?\u2019After all, this was a man who could closely keep up Elijah. Even with the B Class Desperation, I feel like I\u2019m losing terms of speed.If he does catch up, won\u2019t I have to fight him?While I was contemplating on my next move, someone suddenly appeared in front of me and I nearly crashed into them.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI almost ate dirt because of my forceful stop. Fortunately, the person grabbed me before that could happen.\u201cWhat are you doing, sir?\u201dElijah sighed, while patting her forehead. Beside her was a tired, panting priestess.\u2018It\u2019s Trisha.\u2019She was the Hero Party\u2019s Healer. She was nicknamed as the \u2018Natural Lie Detector\u2019 because of her ability to see other people\u2019s emotions.As I briefly glanced at the familiar face, Elijah calmly said.\u201cTrisha, can you isolate us?\u201d\u201cUh, en!\u201dA hemispherical barrier then formed around us, which blocks people\u2019s perception.Elijah continued.\u201cYou could\u2019ve just peacefully come with us. Why are you running around in a such place?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, there\u2019s a reason for this.\u201dShe turned her head in dissatisfaction.\u201cSo what\u2019s the reason? We saved you, so you should tell us that much.\u201dAlthough Elijah sounded normal, seeing Trisha\u2019s contemplative face on the side was indicating that she\u2019s having some\u2026 \u2018violent\u2019 thoughts.It\u2019s clear that she\u2019s angry with my response.\u201c\u2026\u201dThat thought flashed through my mind.However, making Tallion angry and her angry were on different levels of importance.Who knows what sort of strange effects getting stained by \u2018negative tendency\u2019 brings.It might not be a big deal for a mid-chapter boss, but something like that on the protagonist would undoubtedly cause a butterfly effect.So, what now?The lie detector Trisha was next to her so an excuse would just backfire.For now, let\u2019s go with the truth.\u201cThat guy started the fight first.\u201d\u201cFight?\u201d\u201cHe asked why a guy like me is friends with you.\u201dAt this time, both Elijah and Trisha\u2019s expressions became strange.\u201c\u2026?\u201dWas this really such a surprise?\u201c\u2026Why would you fight over something like that, no. I guess he probably thought of you as a scammer or something.\u201dAfter muttering that, Elijah looked at me with a puzzled expression.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you just ignore him? Tallion is pretty strong. And you said that we\u2019re not even close\u2026\u201d\u201cHow can I ignore that?\u201dIt\u2019s literally a test subject served in a silver platter.\u201c\u2026\u201dHearing this, Elijah cleared her throat while turning her head slightly.Her nape was slightly red.\u2026 Is she still angry about this?Am I not speaking nothing but truth right now?\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMeanwhile, Trisha\u2019s eyes started to twinkle when she heard me and poked Elijah in the side.Immediately after, Elijah asked.\u201c\u2026Sir, did you know that this would happen?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cDid you know that he would act like that from the beginning?\u201dDid I know that Tallion would be so angry?I purposely agitated him so how could I not know?\u201cHow can I not know? Anyone with some sense can tell.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that why you didn\u2019t come with me before? Were you afraid that he\u2019d harm me too?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dUh, no?I don\u2019t understand what me provoking Tallion has got to do with you being harmed.[ Favorability of the target \u2018Elijah\u2019 has been increased! ][ The favorabilty level has been upgraded to \u2018Interest Level 2\u2019! ][ Rewards Available! ][ Due to the good inclination of the character, the reward has been reduced! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dI had no clue why this suddenly popped up here.While I was at a loss, Elijah sighed and turned her head to Trisha.\u201cTrisha, would you mind removing the barrier?\u201d\u201cUh, why?\u201d\u201cNothing, it\u2019s just.\u201dAfter saying that, she suddenly reached for her sword.\u201cI\u2019ve always hated nosy people.

If the other party was able to play around him, he clearly has the superior skills.Tallion knew that he should apologize for his rudeness.\u201c\u2026\u201dMarquis Riverback will be disappointed once he catches this.Recalling the one who helped him get admitted to the academy and his family\u2019s benefactor, Tallion couldn\u2019t help but smile bitterly.As someone with the potential and expected to surpass surpass the hero candidate Elijah, his benefactor would definitely be displeased seeing his poor state.But that doesn\u2019t mean that he wouldn\u2019t hit back after being provoked for 25 times.\u201cTallion?\u201dThat\u2019s what he thought.Until he heard a voice calling him in front.\u201c\u2026Elijah?\u201dTallion tilted his head in confusion seeing a smiling Elijah approach him.Why is she here so suddenly?\u201cLong time no see, it\u2019s been a while since the last monster subjugation, no?\u201dTallion hesitated.He and Elijah had both participated as apprentices in a joint monster subjugation under the command of Marquis Kendride.\u2018\u2026She remembered.\u2019Thinking so, Tallion inwardly smiled.\u2018It\u2019s been so long, I thought she wouldn\u2019t remember. Much less as someone who suffered a crushing defeat.\u2019As peers around the same age and skill, it would\u2019ve been strange if they didn\u2019t spar.Of course, the result was disastrous for Tallion.Regardless of how many people say that Elijah was only \u2018slightly\u2019 above him, he knew better than anyone else that that slight difference was akin to an insurmountable wall.Even, it\u2019s an honor to be recognized by such a brilliant talent.\u201cIndeed, Elijah. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cWhat were you doing here?\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh nothing, I was just looking for someone.\u201dTallion awkwardly coughed and glossed over.Ever since their first meeting, Elijah was his motivation to train and surpass.He naturally wouldn\u2019t want her to know that he was chasing someone out of anger.\u201cIs that so? Who were you looking for?\u201d\u201cUh, just some annoying guy\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat plans do you have once you found him?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was around this time that Tallon felt something amiss.Although Elijah was still smiling, her words were carrying a chilly air.\u2018Did she always have this image?\u2019No, she didn\u2019t.When he met her before, she definitely has a slightly aggressive side. However, she\u2019s a prim and proper model citizen through and through.What she\u2019s showing now was something else entirely.But it didn\u2019t feel \u2018insidious\u2019.\u201cTell me. What were you planning on doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWere you planning on attacking him?\u201dElijah took a step forward, her smile widening.\u201c\u2026!\u201dBut her eyes were not smiling at all.Rather, there was hostility that felt like his skin was getting torn apart.Tallion involuntarily took a step back when he realized this.Her expression looked bright, even giggling, but her every word was slowly squeezing him.It felt like he\u2019s facing a giant hungry monster.\u201cWere you trying to hurt Mr.?\u201dShe took another step, while Tallion backed a step.\u201cAh, no, Elijah. Hold on a second\u2026\u201dTallion tried to say something, when he saw Elijah grab the hilt of her sword. And before he could react, the sword was slightly unsheathed.The air felt like it was on fire with the intensity she was exuding.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThen, the spear he was holding instinctively shot forward.The tip of the spear fiercely advanced. It was a genuine blow and Tallion realized what he has done.\u2018This is dangerous\u2026!\u2019But.Just as he blinked.-!-!!His spear suddenly shattered and scattered in all directions.\u2018What\u2026!\u2019His mouth could fit an egg right now, as he watched the broken spear fall to the ground.He didn\u2019t see anything.Despite such a result needing multiple sword swings.Anyone who had trained weapon techniques at Tallion\u2019s level knew exactly what this meant.That is, he was at least a few moves behind his opponent.He was the one who attacked first, but he couldn\u2019t even see the opponent\u2019s counterattack?\u2018She\u2019s even stronger now\u2026!\u2019Previously, he was still able to withstand her attacks.And since then, he has gone through rigorous training. His skills are well-known even when placed in the prestigious Elfante Academy.However, this difference now.Even if there\u2019s three Tallions attacking at the same time, Elijah would slaughter them all in just a few seconds.In less than a year, the gap between them has widened to this extent.\u2018That can\u2019t be, there\u2019s no way.\u2019Talent.An overwhelming gap in talent.She wasn\u2019t just strong enough to be a hero candidate, but she\u2019s also got sky-high talent.But I didn\u2019t think the gap to be this wide\u2026!\u201cYou know.\u201dElijah\u2019s expression didn\u2019t even change after such a display of skill. She simply sheathed the sword back into the scabbard and asked.\u201cWho are you to care about who I\u2019m friends with? What right do you have to interfere on who I approach?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNosy know-it-alls are annoying. And I\u2019ve never seen someone like that with pure intentions\u2026\u201dElijah paused for a moment. Her expression suddenly changed, seemingly to have thought of something. Then, she revised her words.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve only seen one. The rest were guys who only look out for their own interest, isn\u2019t that so?\u201d\u201cElijah, I-uh, I\u2026\u201dElijah snapped her fingers and stopped Tallion in his tracks.Then the already fragmented spear shattered into powder.This time, Tallion didn\u2019t even know what the hell happened.\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear excuses, understand?\u201dTallion dryly swallowed his saliva.It seems that he\u2019s the ignorant idiot here.If you don\u2019t want to get pummeled then\u2026Don\u2019t touch Dowd Campbell. Heck, don\u2019t even go near him.\u201cOkay. You seem to have understood, just don\u2019t do it in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Wait.\u201d\u201cDo you still have something to say?\u201dLooking at Elijah smiling coolly, Tallion flinched, but he was determined to ask this question.He was dying from curiosity.\u201cWho is that guy Doud Campbell exactly?\u201dWhy would such a talented individual behave to such an extent that even her personality changed?Who the hell is Dowd Campbell?Elijah responded with a smirk.\u201cHe\u2019s someone who knocked me out, someone with far superior skills than mine.\u201d\u201c\u2026Wasn\u2019t that a scam?\u201d\u201cMr. is not the kind of person who would do that. If you continue to think that, you might kiss death before you know it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBut despite the threat, Tallion was in no state to respond.It was true that the hero candidate was defeated with a single blow?\u2018\u2026What kind of monster is he?\u2019At least Elijah\u2019s strength was still within the realms of understanding, but the other person was just completely incomprehensible.Why isn\u2019t he publicly known if that\u2019s the case?\u201c\u2026So it\u2019s fortunate that I\u2019m not dead yet?\u201d\u201cYes, now you\u2019re getting it. I basically saved your life.\u201dTallion trembled when he saw Elijah answering like that while shaking her head.Did he unknowingly challenge a monster to a fight?\u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with that person? How did you find out?\u201dAt this point, he couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and asked the question.But unlike before, there was no immediate response. Rather, Elijah\u2019s expression turned solemn.Then, after some pondering.\u201cNo, we\u2019re just good friends, right? On the other hand\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s probably it.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cMaybe, for now. Uh. That\u2019s about it\u2026 I guess? I mean, it\u2019s not that big of a deal to me personally\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026What did you say?\u201d\u201cAh, I don\u2019t know! Anyway, we\u2019re friends for now!\u201dThe way she\u2019s acting right now was just like the Elijah he knew before.Maybe she hasn\u2019t completely changed as a person.\u2018\u2026But what does she mean by friends \u2018for now\u2019?\u2019His questions were left unanswered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I won\u2019t ever bother you again.\u201dDowd was dumbfounded, as he watched Tallion bowing his head and apologizing.Seeing Elijah smiling on the side only made him feel more bewildered.\u2018\u2026What did she do to make him so docile?\u2019As expected of the hero candidate, her preaching skills are extraordinary.After Tallion disappeared, Trisha suddenly approached me with a solemn look, as I was on my way to get my items graded.\u201cExcuse me, Mr. Dowd.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201c\u2026Please be nice to Elijah. No, but don\u2019t be too nice either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat is she talking about all of a sudden?Staring at her wide-eyed, Trisha continued with slight tremors.\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to know it yet, and I also didn\u2019t realize it until now, but there\u2019s something off about Elijah. It could get bad if mishandled.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cWhen I saw her fight Armand\u2019s eldest son earlier, she was on the verge of crossing the line, to the point where one side could have been seriously hurt. Normally, Elijah would have just sent him away, she wouldn\u2019t have drawn her sword like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI am certain that whenever Mr. Dowd is mentioned, she gets dark\u2026 No, she gets extremely angry. Should I say that it\u2019s like she\u2019s losing her sense of judgement?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt could get worse in the future. Mr. Dowd might get implicated if she didn\u2019t like something.\u201dThank you for the deathly ominous warning.\u2018\u2026Why are there so many dangerous things these days?\u2019I thought as I watched Trisha disappear with quick steps.Seriously, it feels like the whole world is against me.I turned my gaze away, sighing.First off, I need to check the system prompts that popped up earlier.\u25bc Elijah Krisanax[ Interest Level 1 ] >>> [ Interest Level 2 ][ Rewards Available! ][ Negative Mark 1 Stack ][ Rewards Available! ][ Character has partly changed under your influence! ][ She is an important character. Increase the mark stack to get something special! ][ Evil Ruler usable for 1 time! ]\u25bc Talion Armand[ Negative Mark 1 Stack ][ Rewards Available! ][ Historically lost sanity under your influence! ][ Evil Ruler usable for 1 time! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dOpening the system never ceases to surprise me everytime.I know that the Negative Mark is from \u2018He Who Touches Pitch Shall Be Defiled Therewith\u2019. The problem is, aside from Tallion, why is Elijah also involved?\"\"Sighing, I tapped the system window.[ Received Gift Reward from \u2018Elijah\u2019. ][ Received 500pts. ][ Current Points: 2,500pts ][ Received 1 \u2018Evil Seed\u2019. ][ Received Gift Reward from \u2018Tallion\u2019. ][ Received 1 \u2018Evil Seed\u2019. ]Evil Seed?What\u2019s this?[ Evil Seed ][ Currency: Special ][ Can be exchanged for a special skill in the Points Store. ][ Skills available for purchase in the store has been updated! ]My eyes widened.\u2018Special skill?\u2019A special skill is a consumable skill that you can use regardless of job class. It\u2019s usually a one-time usage and can be purchased at store.It\u2019s basically like an item that you can \u2018buy and use\u2019.However, it was not called \u2018special\u2019 for nothing. Simply put, in certain situations, its efficiency is far superior to that of any other item.\u2018Let\u2019s check the store\u2026\u2019Indeed, like the prompt says, there were new things available.Each of which boasted a powerful effect.\u2018\u2026I\u2019ll think about how to get more Evil Seeds later.\u2019Negative Marks are morally and practically difficult to obtain just from anyone.I\u2019ll probably have to search for suitable candidates.There are those who will get corrupted later, like Tallion, and there are those who have supposedly good tendencies that are somehow worse than those who are evil. I guess that\u2019s a flaw in the system?With that in mind, I got a handful of items and went back.Then, there I saw a lying Conrad on the ground, drenched in sweat.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat is he doing?\u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201d\u201cIya, you brought so much stuff\u2026\u201dThe man in question gave a lengthy answer.\u201cHow did you end up like this?\u201d\u201cThat frigging, the Student Council President kept pushing to go to the forest, so I told her to knock me down first then she can go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI am at a loss.\u201cSo did you fight?\u201d\u201cWe fought.\u201dWhat a crazy school!The Student Council President is fighting the Dean just because?The area literally looked like it was bombed, with craters everywhere. It\u2019s like the aftermath of a fight between two kaijus.\u201cSo knocked her out and gave her to the Student Council. Man, her skills have really improved\u2026\u201dHe was saying this proudly.\u2018\u2026Still, the Dean overpowered Elnore.\u2019Even if she\u2019s the Final Boss, she\u2019s still in her growth phase. Looking at it now, it seems that she hasn\u2019t even reached half of her peak strength yet.\u201cWhat\u2019s my grade?\u201dI asked with a bitter smile, while Conrad checked the items inside the bag I brought.\u201cPerfect score. Just the quantity alone, you\u2019re in first place.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDidn\u2019t he judge it too fast?Then, as if he knew what I was thinking, Conrad snorted and said.\u201cWhat you\u2019ve brought are high-quality materials, that\u2019s on the same level as the ones procured by experts.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, I guess so.\u201dAlthough the intention was to piss Tallion off, it is indeed true that they are all high-quality.\u201cTake that and go see Percy. She\u2019ll like it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou also have a wish ticket from her anyway, so might as well get some extra points.\u201dConrad said with a smile.\u201c\u2026How so?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s been complaining to me that she\u2019s missing most of the things you brought. So if you appear with it right now, you\u2019ll look like a savior.\u201dHmm.Is that so?\u201cThen can I ask for something a little bigger with the wish ticket using this?\u201d\u201cWhat is it? She\u2019ll probably able to do most things.\u201d\u201cUh, so\u2026\u201dI took a moment to organize my thoughts.There are many conditions required to capture the \u2018Purifier\u2019, but the first thing that comes to mind\u2026\u201cI\u2019d like to ask for a bomb with enough power to explode the entire academy..\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dConrad immediately shut his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you often get misunderstood from saying strange things?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cThen you probably have a terrible sense of perception. There\u2019s already a few of such incidents from what I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBe careful with your words. The way I see it, your campus life will be riddled with all sorts of disasters because of it.\u201dWell, that\u2019s a bit harsh.I thought while Percy flipped through the production draft I had prepared.Percy Siston Levantin, the Magic Faculty Dewn, is a competent researcher recognized by the Mage Tower.The humankind in the world of Sera has achieved most of their technological development through magic engineering. Therefore, being recognized by the Mage Tower, which was the hub of such technology, was a remarkable feat.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of her achievements in magic, but despite her approaching the age of getting gray hairs, she looked no different than a woman in her late 20s.Well, anyway.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy would ask me to make something like this?\u201dIt was, without a doubt, a weird request.\u201cThis is more like a cannon than a bomb. I already thought you went crazy for asking a weapon that could explode the entire academy. But you also want me to make it all focus on one point?\u201dA valid point, understandable.It definitely feels more like a portable cannon than a bomb.Rather than covering a wide area, I want it to hit a precise point at the right time.\u201cThe actual production will be done by the internal workshop of the Crafting Department. I just need the Dean to design the explosion source and an outer shell to contain it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the hardest part. It\u2019s already a challenge to prepare that much firepower. Now, you also need a strong container to store that amount of force. Student, do you think I\u2019m a god or something?\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019ve already made something similar before.\u201dPercy frowned and shut her mouth after hearing my words.Among the \u2018weapons\u2019 that this person produced at the Mage Tower, products with similar performance had even gone into actual production.But it was scrapped due to some kind of \u2018accident\u2019.After some silence, Percy said with a hint of difficulty.\u201cI don\u2019t know how you know that. It was a long time ago.\u201d\u201cYou were a god of magic engineering, what happened?\u201dIn fact, if it had not been for this \u2018accident\u2019, she might have risen to become the \u2018successor\u2019 of the Mage Tower.No one would be able to complete this request other than Percy.She\u2019s not just the Magic Faculty Dean for nothing.\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t know if I should say this.\u201d\u201c\u2026What is it?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like the Dean is the one suffering the most.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPercy couldn\u2019t help but clear her throat when I just went straight for it.And the faces of the students who were working nearby turned pale.Wherever you go, most of the time, it\u2019s the front liners under the managers who gets handed a pile of work and suffer the most.\u201cAnyway, production aside. What are you going to use this weapon for?\u201dPercy asked with a solemn expression.This was a valid question. I may have the wish ticket, but if a student asks you to make a destructive weapon, it\u2019s natural to be wary.Actually, the usage is simple.Sera\u2019s chapter bosses tend to come out with all kinds of dirty gimmicks. And in the case of the Purifier, they get especially annoying in the final phase.They\u2019re infamous for constantly troubling players in all sorts of ways. They never seem to stop no matter how much you thought you\u2019ve beaten them enough, like tenacious cockroaches.Wirh that said, this was my solution.\u201cI need to take down something in one shot.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s just that I need to clean something quick before it becomes a nuisance.\u201d\u201c\u2026Student, you\u2019re really bad at explaining, arent you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI do think I\u2019m being very vague.\u201cBut there is a reason\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure there are. Alright, I\u2019ll make it for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSeeing Percy accepting it just like that left me speechless.As I blinked awkwardly, Percy swept her hair with a sigh.\u201cWell, the President has instructed me to cooperate with you, so I\u2019ll be listening to what you say\u2026 And I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll misuse it.\u201dWhat\u2019s with this high evaluation?With my eyes wide open, Percy continued with a smile.\u201cNormal students may not know, but there are quite a few faculty members who knew of the feat you did during the previous monster incident. It\u2019s something that can\u2019t be done with just ordinary courage and skill.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201d\u201cYes. I guess the President was planning on putting you in some youth love drama, aside from saving the world\u2026\u201dHowever, Percy suddenly stopped mid sentence and shut her mouth tight.Her complexion immediately changed. As if she had said something she shouldn\u2019t have.What?\u201c\u2026Youth love drama? The world, yes?\u201d\u201cAh, no, ah, I, I said nothing, nothing! You didn\u2019t hear anything! Forget everything I said!\u201dWhy is she so flustered?Although her character was a bit clumsy, seeing her act like this made it seem like she had said something she really shouldn\u2019t have.\u201cMore importantly, what about the materials to make this!\u201dThen Percy hurriedly changed the topic.\u201cWe would need the internal explosives to act as gunpowder. And we need a material that has good strength, junction and elasticity, and magic conductivity for the outer shell! It\u2019ll be really difficult to find them!\u201d\u201c\u2026For now, please calm down. I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201dI sighed and said.Although she said that to change the topic, the point itself is valid.The material for the explosion and its container are both important.\u2018We should focus on this.\u2019I fiddled with the black card I received from Atallante previously. It was the key to another world.If I can get inside, it shouldn\u2019t be that difficult to find the materials that Percy said.Surviving inside would be a challenge in itself, but\u2026\u2018For that\u2026\u2019I only need two things to help me with it.\u201cDean, didn\u2019t you say something else when you gave me the wish ticket before?\u201d\u201cYes, yeees?!\u201d\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you say that the hero candidate and I can each pick an item from the Vision Warehouse?\u201dIt was a privilege obtained by breaking the mock battle record.\u201cThen can I ask you for the items we can take out?\u201dI wrote the name of two items on a piece of paper as I said that.These two are subtle when used separately, but has an extreme effect when used together.I may be asking for Elijah\u2019s behalf, but I was carrying her during the mock battle. If she has any complaints, I have my say.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd when Percy saw the item names, she finally regained her composure.The reason was that it was too absurd.She might have already understood the reason for taking out these two items.\u201c\u2026Have you really gone crazy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMa\u2019am .Why would you ask me that?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The odds of such a coincidental meeting with this person in a hallway with no one around was slim to none.\u201c\u2026Do you know me?\u201d\u201cAh, forgive me for the late introduction. I am Galdier Riverback. I run a charity foundation called the \u2018House of Purification\u2019.\u201dHe handed me a business card while saying so.Oh I know you, alright.Marquis Galdier Riverback.The big boss of Chapter 1, the \u201cPurifier,\u201d and the leader of the devil-worshipping cult \u201cPURIFIER.\u201d[T/N: there\u2019s two \u201cPurifier\u201d but they are spelled differently in Korean so I\u2019ll just capitalize the cult name like how the author spelled out the word]The charity foundation is just a money-laundering front for his cult.\u2026Yeah, whatever.What\u2019s important is why he suddenly appeared here.What does he want from me?\u201cI have had a great interest in Mr. Dowd Campbell for some time now. I have been wanting to contact you, but the opportunity never presented itself .\u201dDespite not having said a word, Marquis Riverback had already led the conversation in his direction.\u201cI have a story I would like to share. Would you mind joining me for a meal sometime?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s fine, you can just say it here.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do, unfortunately. It\u2019s for charity. The House of Purification supports talented students so that they are not constrained by things like finances.\u201dMarquis Riverback smiled, and even, bowed slightly. His courteous attitude remained despite my rough response.\u201c\u2026 My reputation isn\u2019t really that good, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of it.\u201dThis is what the academy is promoting and making it to be. I\u2019m sure the truth hasn\u2019t leaked and the knowledge of it is even limited.However, Marquis Riverback continued to smile without hesitation.\u201cIt is a feat in itself to attract public opinion to that extent.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOur foundation can definitely provide Mr. Dowd Campbell with a great opportunity. Could you please reconsider?\u201dI rotated the business card in my hand several times without answering.How sus could you be by saying that having shi\u2020 reputation is a skill?It\u2019s a proposal that doesn\u2019t make any sense other than showing interest in me.\u2018This.\u2019This event was also present in the original story.Marquis Riverback did this same thing to \u2018woo\u2019 someone. In the game, Elijah got involved in this too, which led to an important branch of the chapter.And now it\u2019s happening to me.I don\u2019t know why.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll think about it.\u201dMarquis Riverback grinned at my reply and politely saluted.\u201cI look forward to a positive response.\u201dWatching the \u2018polite\u2019 man departing back, I turned over the business card I received.3 days later. Twilight Iris. A high-end restaurant located inside the city area outside the campus.It looks like he rented the whole restaurant. But Marquis Riverback is famous for his wealth.\u201c\u2026\u201dI silently weighed the situation in my head.Avoiding events tied to the main scenario will result in a significant penalty. There was virtually no option for me but to go through it.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhy do I always end up like this?Is the whole world banding against me?I massaged my head. I\u2019ve been having frequent migraines as of late.\u2018\u2026I\u2019ll have to prepare everything I can.\u2019Well, there\u2019s no point in weighing the options now. Like usual, it\u2019s fight or die.I still have 3 days to spare. Until then, I need to think of what I can do.Gathering the information I know and applying it to the current situation.Calculate the risk. Calculate the return.\u2018\u2026It\u2019s not impossible.\u2019The plan itself will not change much. I need to go to the other world with Elijah tomorrow and collect the materials.Then I just need to wait for the thing to be made and strengthened.But, after that.\u201c\u2026\u201dI need one more thing.I changed my course. There was someone I need to find first before going to Elijah.Soon, I arrived at the infirmary and knocked on the door.\u201cElnor. Are you there?\u201d\u201c\u2026Dowd?\u201dElnore\u2019s startled voice came from inside.I heard that after fighting the Dean and passing out, she was in bed the whole day.\u201c\u2026What is it? Hold on. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d\u201cNo need, please rest easy. It\u2019s just a simple matter.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? Is something the matter?\u201d\u201cAre you free in three days?\u201d\u201c\u2026Eung?\u201d\u201cCan you go somewhere with me? It\u2019s at \u2018Twilight Iris\u2019.\u201dElnore went silent in the room.There was a long silence along with heavy breathing.Then, a slightly trembling voice sounded.\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t that the famous dating place, no, a very expensive restaurant? Why would you go there\u2026\u201d\u201cNothing in particular, I just want to go there with you.\u201dThere was a loud sound from inside the room, as if something had fallen.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhy is this person like this?\u201c\u2026Are you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRight. That\u2019s a relief.\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you in three days\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dI stepped back after hearing her voice that sounded different than usual.\u2018\u2026But I\u2019ve secured the most important person.\u2019The rest is just gathering the means to use in the plan.All right.It looks like the next three days are going to be pretty busy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Including, those hidden from the public\u2019s eyes.In other words, Beatrix not only knew but even became somewhat used to Elnore\u2019s bizarre behavior that appears from time to time.\u201cHey.\u201dStill, there are times that even she couldn\u2019t stand it.She doesn\u2019t know why but Elnore has been looking like an anxious addict since earlier.She would just sigh or her eyes would turn bloodshot out of nowhere. She was acting like a rollercoaster, up and down.\u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe pen Elnore was holding in her hand snapped.Beatrix sighed when she saw the pen made of solid ore breaking like some kind of rotten twig.This amount of force that Elnore was exerting with her hand was a sign that she\u2019s \u2018holding back\u2019 something.Hence why her response was rather brusque compared to the usual.\"\"\u201cDon\u2019t remind me of it. I just barely convinced myself to forget. I can\u2019t focus on my work.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then explain why, bi\u2020ch.\u201dBeatrix curtly pursued, but Elnore simply shook her head instead of answering.\u201cFine. It\u2019s not like it\u2019ll get resolved if you talk about it. Don\u2019t worry about it. If anything, aren\u2019t you working hard right now?\u201dThis, Beatrix had to admit.Although Elnore wasn\u2019t a lazy slob, her current working momentum was simply terrifying.\u201c\u2026But this is for the better. It\u2019s pretty busy lately.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s indeed a strange amount of administrative work. Is there some important project going on or something?\u201d\u201cThey say it\u2019s a transfer student from the Tribal Union. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of the name.\u201dHearing this, Elnore frowned and checked a nearby document.\u201cAre they the forces behind the coup? The Chief\u2019s daughter?\u201d\u201cYes. The Empire accepted this.\u201dIf she was indeed the Chief\u2019s daughter, then she\u2019s basically a celebrity comparable to the Imperial Family.A VIP figure of this status would most likely have an \u2018entourage\u2019 which the academy, that normally insists on equality among students, had to acknowledge.In fact, it would not be unreasonable to say that it\u2019s their whole family tree who have fled en masse from the power struggle.\u201cIn addition, there will also be a regular delegation from the Holy Land next semester. The Saintess herself is coming.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElnore wordlessly nodded and kept the documents away.Though, her expression was more strained than before.\u201c\u2026If it\u2019s a regular delegation, isn\u2019t it just a matter of convention? Why would such a high figure need to move herself?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. There are rumors that the academy has made some requests. They also say that the president\u2019s influence was strong on this one.\u201dElnore\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cWhy are you so upset?\u201d\u201cEven with just these bits of information, it\u2019s very clear that the academy is up to something.\u201d\u201cI suppose so. It\u2019s not like their the type to shy away from things like this.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also something weird going on with Dowd. They\u2019re definitely planning something big with the Chief\u2019s daughter and Saintess.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so? But would they really get involved with each other? The status of the two is too high to even consider involving someone from a small Baron family.\u201dBeatrix\u2019s replied with narrowed eyes, but Elnore responded in a clear voice.She was serious and calm.\u201cLogically speaking, that would be the case.\u201d\u201cSo what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI just doesn\u2019t sit well with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to think of him and some women at the same time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBeatrix massaged her forehead.\u201cWhat nonsense.\u201d\u201cWhen I think of Dowd, I only want to think of him. The fact that you have to think of other women together in such a situation is-\u201d\u201cJust do your work. Before I have to knock some sense into you.\u201dWith that, Elnore sighed and grabbed another pen.\u201cI suppose so that there wouldn\u2019t be any problem even if I take a day off.\u201dA day off our of the blue?No wonder she\u2019s working so hard, she need to clear the entire schedule for a day.Beatrix tilted her head and asked.\u201cWhy, do you have an important appointment?\u201dThe sound of a pen breaking once again starkly echoed in the office.Elnore had tightened her grip as soon as she heard the question.\u201c\u201dI will bill you if you continue that.\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t keep reminding me.\u201d\u201c\u2026So explain what it is and stop with the nonsense. Just tell me. You\u2019ll destroy all the furniture at this rate.\u201dElnore pondered for a moment.She then gently placed her hand on the chair\u2019s armrest.Soon, creaking noises sounded from it.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat is she holding back so much that she\u2019s acting like this?As Beatrix was having such thoughts, Elnore finally spoke with great difficulty.Her voice was very solemn, painful, and melancholic.\u201cBeatrix.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI miss Dowd Campbell.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBeatrix clutched her face.The headache she barely managed to control was coming back.\u201cHe asked me to meet in three days. So shouldn\u2019t I finish all the work until then?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHow can I not see him for three days? That\u2019s too much-\u201c\u201c\u2026This is the last warning. Get to work.\u201dBeatrix coldly declared. Elnore pouted and picked up another document.Fortunately, the contents interested her.\u201cThe Full Moon Festival is in three days?\u201d\u201cOh, has it already come to that time?\u201dThe Full Moon Festival.It is the most celebrated day among the imperial holidays.Even the academy faculty and staff who are working next to the Void Zone take a break at this time.\u2018Hence why it\u2019s also the time when the defense is the most vulnerable.\u2019As someone who grew up wielding the sword, that\u2019s all Elnore can think of.Surprisingly, such a holiday coincided with the day she\u2019ll be meeting Dowd.She smiled and put away the documents related to the Full Moon Festival.Anyway, all she needs to remember is that three days later is an important day.In more ways than one.\u25cf< System Message>[ Updated additional information on the Main Quest! ][ Main Quest ]\u3016 Chapter 1 \u2013 Purifier \u3017[ Successfully resolve the events in \u2018Twilight Iris\u2019! ] [ D-3 ][ Reward: Branch benefit from the main scenario! ]I looked at the system window in front of me.This came up after receiving the invitation from Marquis Riverback.\u2018Branch benefit.\u2019I scratched my cheek as I read what\u2019s written on the rewards section.I know about this reward as it randomly appears a few times in the game.Originally, if you refuse Marquis Riverback\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d in the Twilight Iris, what would follow is either a high stakes escape or battle. Chapter 1 is all about fast-paced progression.Branch benefit basically adds a much easier option than the original two outcomes.\u2018That\u2019s nice.\u2019As a Chapter 1 boss, you don\u2019t need to worry about the PURIFIER anymore once you\u2019ve beaten them at once. At least, it\u2019s far better than the subsequent chapter bosses that require repeating boss battles.It\u2019s just a little difficult to do it all in one go.\u2018That\u2019s why I brought this person here.\u2019Thinking so, I look at Elijah, who was rubbing her hands saying that it was cold. We\u2019re currently in a quite high altitude.\u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is there anything to worry about?\u201d\u2013She\u2019s even so enthusiastic about it.I called out to Elijah with a smile.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cTake this.\u201dElijah tilted her head in wonder when she saw the item I held out.\u201c\u2026What it this?\u201d\u201cYou will need it.\u201dThis is the only explanation I can give right now.Her asking what it was was natural.After all, what I gave her was a several meters long iron rod. One couldn\u2019t even imagine what it was used for.Meanwhile, I\u2019m holding a disc that\u2019s big enough for to fit at least two humans.Nonetheless, Elijah took the rod and then looked up at the sky, checking her watch from time to time.We\u2019re currently at the rooftop of Gregory Hall, a building that originally served as a spire and is now being used as an observatory.Although it falls a bit short compared to the clock tower at the center of the academy, it is one of the tallest buildings in Elfante.\u201c\u2026I know you asked me for help but what are we trying to do in a place like this?\u201d\u201cFor the gathering.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cWait a little.\u201dI said while focusing at the sky.Soon, what I had been waiting for began to unfold.\u201c\u2026Uh?\u201dElijah uttered in confusion as a cluster of light suddenly began to gather at a height so high that it was even difficult to see from the observatory\u2019s viewpoint.Even in Elfante, where all kinds of abnormal things happen, this phenomenon only comes once every few months for only a very short amount of time. Hence, most faculty members, let alone students, are unaware of it. It\u2019s natural for Elijah to be confused.\u201cAlright, get ready.\u201d\u201cYes, yes? How, what should I prepare for?\u201dI then instructed the fidgeting Elijah to hold the stick to the ground, to which I rolled the disc over on the tip.It looked like a spoon lying on the ground.\u201cGreat, now lie down here.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cQuickly.\u201dSaying that, I flop down onto the disc. I tap the seat next to me and urged her to do the same.\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201dDespite her grumbles, she nonetheless laid down next to me.\u201cSo are we just going to lay down here and watch the night sky together?\u201d\u201cFor now.\u201dAfter saying that, Elijah hesitated for a moment before replying.\u201c\u2026Hee. They\u2019re shining romantically. So, what do you want me to do instead of leaving it to Princess Tristan-\u201d\u201cIs it romantic? Well, it does look pretty.\u201d\u201cYes? Why?\u201dFor ordinary people, the Gregory Hall may no more than be a \u2018tall\u2019 building, but for players who have cleared the Sera DLC, it holds a special meaning.In the game, this is where the portal to the \u2018Netherworld\u2019 opens. A place where materials with all sorts of bizarre effects, that had never been seen before in the main story, appeared.This was the space where those angels were gathering before.\u201cThat is the entrance to the Netherworld.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElijah alternately looked at the clustering lights in the sky with a loading bar above her head.It was then that she finally processed the meaning of my words, and her face gradually turned pale.\u201c\u2026What did you just say it was?\u201d\u201cI said it\u2019s the entrance to the Netherworld.\u201d\u201cWhy would something like that pop up in a place like this?!\u201dHer reaction was normal.This \u201cNetherworld\u201d can be simply expressed as the \u201cHell\u201d in Savior Rising\u2019s world.In the first place, it can only be accessed by purchasing the DLC after completing the main story. Needless to say, the survival mode was difficult.\u2018\u2026Actually, I don\u2019t really want to do this either, to be honest.\u2019I wouldn\u2019t have even considered this as an option if the damned storyline hadn\u2019t been fcked up. Now, I have to go because I need something in there.I gritted my teeth while fiddling with the black card in my pocket.The portal to Netherworld that opens in the Gregory Hall isn\u2019t the only one; there are others like the Spirit World.Perhaps the President already knew that I would use it to enter such a place when she gave me this \u201cotherworldly key.\u201dI just need to enter and quickly leave right after obtaining everything I need. Staying in such a dangerous place for long is a no go.I never expected her to know the \u2018Netherworld\u2019, which is considered the worst in terms of survival difficulty among all other worlds.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t expect what I am about to do.\u201c\u2026Fortunately, we\u2019re far away from it. It doesn\u2019t seem like it would affect us much, since it\u2019s so high up in the sky.\u201d\u201cI guess so. It\u2019s normally impossible to even get close to that place. And, at the very least, you need to have the ability to survive in there to even attempt to enter.\u201dIt is in that context that portals are created at such a terrifying height.Like each profession need to master their own skills to enter.For example, a Priest must have at least enough skill with divinity to make an \u2018air bridge\u2019 up there, a Knight must be strong enough to jump up there, and a Mage must be capable of floating or flying magic\u2026In any case, it is a place filled with complex and powerful restrictions.\u201cBut that is if it\u2019s done normally.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why do you say that?\u201dElijah\u2019s expression suddenly became strange.She probably noticed that her body was \u2018fixed\u2019 on the disc.This was because I activated it by pressing the button underneath the disc.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs Elijah was silent, wondering what was going on\u2026There\u2019s the sound of the iron rod that she had been laid down earlier being driven into the floor.\u201c\u2026Mr..\u201d\u201cEung.\u201d\u201cNo way, no, is it what I\u2019m thinking it is?\u201d\u201cEung.\u201dThe rod bent into an arch.And the disc tilted at an angle.Yes.It\u2019s just like a \u2018catapult\u2019 before launching a stone.These two items are a set. However, they have very limited use and cannot be used for multiple purposes. That\u2019s why they been gathering dust in Elfante\u2019s Vision Warehouse. But its performance was certain.It was originally designed to shoot \u2018projectiles\u2019 at a very fast speed and high into the sky, with terrifying momentum.Naturally.It has enough power to \u2018launch\u2019 me and Elijah to that portal.\u201cAre we going in there now?\u201d\u201cUh.\u201d\u201c\u2026In the Netherworld, without any equipment?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It will be over soon.\u201dUh. It should work.I confident that it will.It\u2019s definitely dangerous, though.\u201c\u2026\u201dAt this time, Elijah suddenly smiled broadly.\u201cYou really are crazy, fck.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBefore I could even respond.Elijah and I were shot into the air at a terrifying speed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And it\u2019s true, if we just try to directly launch our way through, we would just bounce off.So, at this time, I took out the black card that the President gave.I threw it as soon as we were about to get in contact with it. The light cluster wriggled which tore a hole in the space itself.At the same time, I set a timer for exactly 2 minutes.\u2018\u2026This is the limit of Atallante\u2019s access pass.\u2019Originally, this was end-game content that was only given to players who had achieved \u2018Eternal\u2019 status.The black card was something like an identification given to these high beings.

How much higher do we need to go?\u201d\u201cJust a little more.\u201dIn fact, if it were just simply entering and exiting the portal, there would have been a more suitable flying item from the Vision Warehouse and not this makeshift \u2018catapult\u2019.But there\u2019s a reason why I used such a primitive method, that is, to obtain the items that existed in the \u2018Gregory Hall\u2019s Highest Level\u2019.\u201c\u2026Coming to such a high place reminds me of the old days.\u201dElijah, who was in free flight with me, suddenly muttered.\u201cYou\u2019re familiar with this experience?\u201d\u201cMy older brother is as crazy as Mr. He had thrown me from the top of the mountain without any equipment since I was little. Looking at it that way, aren\u2019t you two the same?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHe always saves me in the end, and say that this was to train my courage.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNo wonder she\u2019s still strangely calm even in this situation.\u201cThat idiot really loved heights.\u201dElijah continued with a smile.\u201c\u2026I wonder where and what is he doing now?\u201dThe longing was clear in her tone.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut.Twelve years ago, the Crimson Night Incident happened.It was a terrorist incident caused by the \u2018Revelation Descendants\u2019, a group of devil worshipers who follow the \u2018Red Devil\u2019.Elijah\u2019s family was killed at that time.\u201c\u2026\u201dIf she was left alone, Elijah would have grown up in a peaceful farmhouse. Her \u201cmissing brother\u201d probably played a significant role in her taking up the role of a hero candidate, even though she had no interest in it.Elijah\u2019s brother was the only one who survived the Crimson Night Incident, but he went completely missing nor was there any whereabouts of him.Elijah couldn\u2019t help but constantly cling to the hope that if she became famous enough, he might recognize her and come find her.Originally a farmer\u2019s daughter, she had never even held a sword. I can\u2019t imagine how much she had to push herself to get to this point.\u201cOh, there\u2019s something there.\u201dI got pulled out of my thoughts when Elijah suddenly exclaimed and pointed in front.It was a pure white \u2018smoke\u2019 that was the most noticeable even amidst the colorful surroundings.It\u2019s appearance closely resembles of what\u2019s generally called a \u2018spirit\u2019.\"\"The faraway smoke didn\u2019t look ordinary.\u2018The Spirit of the Gregory Hall.\u2019It originally appears as an Easter egg long after the main story.It manifests itself into the material world once using the \u2018inter-dimensional access route\u2019 earlier.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd there\u2019s one thing that only those who saw it at that time knows.This is one of things that the earlier you get it, the more broken it is.Players were even data-mining like crazy to find its original location and get it as soon as possible.\u201cEucha.\u201dI unfolded the sack I prepared beforehand.Of course, it\u2019s not just some random sack.[ Magic Sack! ]x3[ Price: 500pt ]x3[ Item: Junk ][ Can hold any item inside for one day! ][ Remaining Points: 1,000pt ]A sack that can store anything that is treated as an item for a day.First things first, the spirit is considered as an item. It\u2019s normally impossible to capture it by normal means, but with the sack, it\u2019s possible.Although the 500pt price tag was steep, it was worth it.As for the two remaining sacks, I gave one to Elijah.\u201cHere, hold this.\u201d\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this?\u201d\u201cGrab something nearby when you run away. Anything is fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes? Run away?\u201dI then silently pointed up.To which Elijah frowned.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, isn\u2019t that just the sky?\u201dI continued and pointed to a huge dot moving around at the center of the \u2018sky\u2019.\u201cDo you see that?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the pupil.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dAnd with that, I left the confused Elijah and checked the watch instead.1 minute remaining.\u2018I\u2019ll manage.\u2019Although I\u2019m no scientist, I\u2019ve already proven my actions to be correct, in this world built on top of the game system several times.This should be safe enough.\u201cWhat do you mean those are the pupils-\u201dJust as Elijah was about to ask such a question, she immediately shut her mouth.That\u2019s because she saw the color of the sky change for a moment before immediately returning to its original state.This phenomenon was caused by a being closing and opening its eyes.To put it differently.What looks like the sky right now was simply the \u2018white\u2019 part of the being\u2019s eyes.And the \u2018pupil\u2019 looked like a huge dot.At this moment, Elijah finally realized that we were being watched.\u201cThis is, this is crazy-!\u201dWith a deafening roar, the \u2018sky\u2019 receded.[ A moment of danger has been detected. ][ Determined the situation as life-threatening. ][ Skill: Desperation raised to EX Class. ]Specifically, the \u2018Netherworld beast\u2019 that sensed us pulled its head back and was now approaching us with its jaws wide open.\u2018\u2026this is why the Netherworld is hell.\u2019Mind you, this is a \u2018trash mob\u2019 of this world.\"\"A creature at the bottom of the food chain.\u201cM, Mr., this, damn it!\u201dElijah drew her sword as she said so.Her whole body was trembling and tears were welling up in her eyes.\u201cGe, get behind me!\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you sure it\u2019s safe to go that route?\u201d\u201cYou saved me before! This time, I\u2019ll\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI see, I understand how you feel. And for that, thank you.The courage and mental strength to put yourself in the face of danger without even knowing the opponent was amazing. Definitely deserving of a round of applause.But fighting that thing with our current strength alone is suicidal.\u201cCalm down, we\u2019re not here to fight that thing.\u201dSaying so, I reminded her of the sack I gave earlier.At this moment, our soaring bodies were about to stop.All that remains was a free-fall downwards.\u201cFrom now on, gather everything that comes pouring down.\u201d\u201cPour, pour down?!\u201d\u201cThat thing.\u201dI pointed to the white lumps pouring out of the beast\u2019s open mouth.\u201cTake as many as you can. It can be used in a lot of places.\u201d\u201cY, you really have the time to think about that right now?!\u201dBut despite my instructions, she was screaming in protest.Elijah was more concerned about our lives being in danger, to which she was not wrong.\u2018\u2026Still, it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u2019To do so, I even bought two more sacks and spent 1,000 points.If my calculations were correct, we wouldn\u2019t be in a situation where we\u2019d die.\u2018Ah, that\u2019s right.\u2019Can I use \u2018it\u2019 here?[ Skill: Evil Ruler has been activated. ][ Triggering command right to target \u2018Elijah\u2019. ]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why can someone be calm in this situation?\u201dWith a half-giving up expression, Elijah finally followed my lead and opened her sack to catch the falling white lumps.This and a humongous creature larger than the mountain coming to devour us was quite the strange sight to see.9 seconds.\u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan! We\u2019re almost there!\u201dHer words had a double meaning.Above is the gaping maw of the beast while below is the hard ground.It\u2019s either death by vore or death by fall.Still, there was nothing to plan or say.\u201cJust\u2026 Watch your step.\u201dThere\u2019s no room for mistakes here.As the main character, her life is precious.\u201cYes?!\u201dOne second left.As the alarm on the watch went off, the world that had just been filled with various filter-like colors returned to its original state.The \u2018entry permit\u2019 that allowed us to enter the world has expired and thus we got forcibly expelled.\u201cEhut\u2026 Cha.\u201dAt the same time, we made a \u2018soft\u2019 on the ground.Basically, expending the time limit and getting kicked out makes it so our coordinates are \u2018newly generated\u2019.What does that mean? In other words, in the current situation, the only force that would affect me and Elijah is the momentum from jumping from this two-story building.Kung, kung.

She could feel his warmth still lingering.She absentmindedly fiddled with that part of her finger.\u201c\u2026\u201dShe silently recalled what had just happened.When the unidentified giant monster had opened its mouth and was coming to devour them.\u2018Relax, it\u2019s fine.\u2019She was so scared.It felt like she was going to die.But when that man told her to calm down, she suddenly felt relieved.It really felt like that.His words just pierced straight through her heart.\u2018It\u2019s strange. Really strange.\u2019At first glance, he seems indifferent and just blurts out things carelessly.But if you were to stay by his side for a little while, you would realize that he always seems to see things that others can\u2019t.Most of all.He would always do things that strike people\u2019s hearts during crucial moments.\u2018They\u2019re a little bit similar?\u2019Her brother had always remained stuck in her heart for the better or worse.He\u2019s mischievous, insensitive, and usually only play silly pranks. Sometimes, she wonders if there\u2019s another dolt like him in the world.But at the same time.No matter what adversity, he would always rise up and overcome it.No matter how strong the opponent is, he never backs down.Above all.Whenever she is in danger, he always rushes to her rescue.He was her only hero in the world.Didn\u2019t he used to say that every time?\u2018Relax, it\u2019s fine.\u2019\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd, oddly enough.After experiencing the previous situation, that man called Dowd strangely reminds her of him-\u201cAaaaahhhh-!\u201dElijah groaned and slapped her cheeks with both hands.\u2018Crazy, are you insane!?\u2019How could she compare her brother with that person!In the first place, he\u2019s someone else\u2019s man!

But, Elijah immediately shook her head and shouted again at the top of her lungs.\u201cI really hate you, Mr.!\u201dShe was screaming so much that her face started to get red.It was as if she was trying to force out a voice that was coming from inside of her.\u25cf\u201cAaaaahhhh-!\u201d\u201cSo annoying!

She was so surprised that she fired lightning magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dActually, I was lucky.The other graduate students around that time didn\u2019t look as unscathed.\u201cSo, does this satisfy you?\u201dShe previously promised me another gift if I \u2018satisfied her\u2019.This should be enough, right?\u201cIt\u2019s not about being satisfied\u2026 Even if you don\u2019t give this to me and take it to the Mage Tower instead, I\u2019ll still buy this with a pile of gems.\u201dEctoplasm and a thought body.Atallante replied while massaging her temples.A thought body is an object that said to contain the consciousness of \u2018great men\u2019 who had done great achievements. And Ectoplasm is an ultra-rare material that is barely obtainable in units of 30 to 50 grams per year even in the Mage Tower.Depending on the processing method, it\u2019s utility is almost universal.According to the type of catalyst it\u2019s mixed with, it can be made even harder than diamonds, or be processed into explosive weapons that show power similar to tactical weapons.And I just handed over two blobs of it weighing in kilograms, so Percy naturally had a seizure.\u201c\u2026Alright.

It\u2019s like you\u2019re being chased by something.\u201dBeing chased\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s, quite an accurate description.\u201cWell, if I don\u2019t prepare this much, I\u2019ll die.\u201dThe enemies that appear in the main scenario, especially the Chapter Bosses that are somehow related to the \u2018devils\u2019, cannot be simply dealt with with just skills and equipment.They are disasters.Monsters in human form.They are directly connected to the devils who have the power to single-handedly destroy the world.I am already deeply involved with the main character and the final boss, who are the core axes of the story. With that considered, I am quite frankly in a chase.Even more so now that the main scenario is proceeding much faster than expected.\u2018\u2026And Chapter 1 is no exception.\u2019Even more, there\u2019s the Chapter 2 boss \u2013 the Boy King of the Ruined Kingdom, and the Chapter 3 boss \u2014 the Apostle of the Reversed Sea, after the Purifier.But unlike the fact that I have a lot of growth-type equipment ready for that time, my current condition is a bit poor right now.Rather, it could be more dangerous because it\u2019s before the growth curve.In that sense.\u201cActually, I might even die soon.\u201dI had to do everything to even reach the Chapter 1 Boss Fight.In case of emergency\u2026 Uh.I might have to do that.\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dAtallante looked at me strangely, before shrugging it off.\u201cBy the way, may I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhy are you being so nice to me?\u201dAtallante\u2019s eyebrows curled slightly.\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou must have a lot of questions like how did a student like me manage to come and go in the Netherworld intact. Or how I know the concept of a thought body\u2026\u201dNo matter how you look at it, I am holding information that a student shouldn\u2019t know. And yet, she\u2019s just spilling it without question.Not only that, I could feel Atallante\u2019s presence wherever and whatever I do, as if the entire Academy is revolving around me.\u201cYou noticed? I guess you\u2019re not a fool.\u201d\u201cYes. Unless you\u2019re a fool, anyone would come to the same conclusion.\u201dI continued with a sigh.\u201c\u2026How much more are you willing to go?\u201dThe President chuckled.But I didn\u2019t get an answer in the end.\u25cfSo that\u2019s what this is.I checked the amulet wrapped around my wrist. It\u2019s something the president made after a whole day\u2019s work.[ Soul Linker ] [ Exclusive Equipment ][ Enchantment: Epic ][ An item imbued with a great spirit that can awaken by increasing synchronization rate. ][ Always retain magic power due to the influence of the great spirit. ][Currently Charged Magic Power Rate: 100%][ Current Synchronization Rate: 0% ]Originally, in order to raise the synchronization rate, other jobs must constantly feed the item rare materials.

Just obtaining and growing it at this timing alone is unbelievable.If I start steadily growing it, it\u2019ll be one of the key pillars for clearing Chapter 2 onwards.\u2018The fact that it\u2019s charged with magic power is also good.\u2019It\u2019s especially a useful function for me who has zero innate abilities and needs to pull magic power from elsewhere to use skills.Having this item alone right now is worth its price. I need magic power to use two skills.\u201cAh, you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hello.\u201dOf course, this person\u2019s help is essential for this time.I kept the amulet and looked at Elnore, who was waving her hands in front of me.[ Main Quest ]\u3016 Chapter 1 \u2013 Purifier \u3017[ Successfully resolve the events in \u2018Twilight Iris\u2019! ] [ D-0 ][ Reward: Branch benefit from the main scenario! ][ Related events will soon occur! ]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s a relief. You look like you\u2019ve dressed up more than usual\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s not like she dressed like a hobo before, just that she usually wears her uniform. But today, she\u2019s wearing a loose sky blue dress and was adorned with all sorts of jewelry.Speaking of, she\u2019s wearing makeup now?\u201c\u2026Am I?\u201dElnore slightly smiled at my words.\u201cYes, it must have taken a very long time to perfect.\u201d\u201cI got ready in the morning and came here, so about six hours.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat did she say about not waiting and just got here again?\u201c\u2026Well, that\u2019s not a long wait. Don\u2019t feel burdened.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not lying, I can spare 6 hours whenever\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Then, shall we go?\u201dI sighed and said to Elnore, who was starting to be unreasonable.As I gently grabbed her wrist and led her away, I could feel Elnore\u2019s body twitch.\u201cDowd?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be crowded.\u201dThe Full Moon Festival is in full swing.With so many attendees, it\u2019ll be easy to lose someone in the sea of people.\u2018Is it uncomfortable?\u2019To be honest, I have no idea on how I should distance myself from a woman.The reason was also very simple. It\u2019s because I\u2019ve never had such an experience in my life.Let alone dating, Dowd Campbell didn\u2019t even have friends of the opposite sex.I\u2019m a bit sad now.\u201cWell, it certainly seems that way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElnore smiled and took her hand away.Ah, I guess it was uncomfortable\u2026\u201cThis is how you escort a lady.\u201dHolding hands is a sign of respect and trust towards the other person. It should not be neglected.You grasp firmly and with dignity.Having said that, Elnore gently held my hand.With our hands touching, I could feel her warmth on my skin.\u201cI won\u2019t lose you, this way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWill you lead the way?\u201dI stared at Elnore with my eyes wide open.\u201c\u2026Elnore, did you just smile?\u201dMore precisely, she had a light smile that seemed a bit shy.Whereas, in the main story, Elnore looked like she\u2019s in constant suffering.The Gray Devil\u2019s energy bubbling from within and her rivalry with Elijah. On top of it all, she had to maneuver through muddy politics as a Tristan.She\u2019s always under extreme pressure, both physically and mentally.All of which add up and chip away at her mental state.This is why I don\u2019t remember ever seeing her wear anything other than a hardened, robotic expression.For all the time I\u2019ve been grinding in the world of Sera, I have not once caught sight of her smile in front of other people.So what is this look she has on right now?This feeling of vulnerability.It\u2019s as if she\u2019s truly at ease with me.\u201c\u2026\u201dThough her expression reverted back to her impassive state when I mentioned it.\u201c\u2026Was I smiling?\u201d\u201c\u2026I think you did?\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking me that\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019ve never smiled before, so I don\u2019t really know what it feels like.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt seems sloppy.\u201dWell.It\u2019s still a bit far from being \u2018natural\u2019.\u25cf\u201cUh? Mr. Dowd?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dAs we arrived at Twilight Iris, a familiar face greeted me.\u201cTallion?\u201d\u201cYou remembered? I\u2019m honored.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m working as a part-timer. My family practice laissez-faire.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI felt a bit queasy seeing Tallion say that with a wistful smile.Even me, who\u2019s from a small Barony, receives allowances for my living expenses. But the eldest son of a Viscount has none?Isn\u2019t that a bit too much?\u201cBut this, um\u2026\u201dTallion looked perplexed as he watched me and Elnore, who was almost sticking to my arm.\u201c\u2026Are you dating the Student Council President?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI could feel Tallion\u2019s questioning gaze right now and I also wanted to plead my case.At first, we just held hands, but Elnore gradually came closer and we ended up in this pose.Even if I want to push her away, I simply can\u2019t with my miniscule strength.\u201c\u2026!\u201dImmediately after I said, I could feel Elnore twisting my arm.It felt like it\u2019s about to get ripped off.\u201c\u2026Why are you doing that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s punishment.\u201d\u201cBut what for?\u201dShe twisted it again, and this time, I couldn\u2019t help but let out a groan.\u201cWell, I see that you two are on good terms.\u201dTallion chuckled and said, to which I questioned him back.\u201c\u2026By the way, why are you suddenly using honorifics?\u201dI know from the game that Elijah uses honorific, but Tallion? And didn\u2019t he also just chased me around to beat me not long ago?What\u2019s with the sudden politeness?\u201cI simply wanted to do such for Mr. Dowd.\u201dTallion humbly bowed his head and replied.Come to think of it, he was like this originally.Before his fall into the darkness, I remember him being a diligent and sincere ace student.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for such. We\u2019re in the same class anyway.\u201d\u201cThen I will call you Hyeongnim. You\u2019re older than me, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWell, he\u2019s not wrong.In Elfante, being in the same class doesn\u2019t equate to similar ages.The problem is.\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\u201cMarquis Riverback often talks about Hyeongnim. He\u2019s very interested in you, you know?\u201dTallion\u2019s reply made my eyebrows frown.\u2018That guy\u2026\u2019Perhaps, he only approached me because I was close with Elijah and Elnore.However, Marquis Riverback is a snake. He wouldn\u2019t put so much care and attention to me if he\u2019s were simply going to use me as a bridgehead to the two women.\u201cAnyways, welcome to the Twilight Iris. Please enjoy your stay.\u201dI faced Tallion who said so with a cheerful smile.\u201c\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, there had been a message that the main scenario had changed since Elnore and Elijah\u2019s favorability increased.It is now clear that the effect has reached this far.Marquis Riverback\u2019s interest has shifted from \u2018Elijah\u2019 to \u2018me\u2019.\u2018The story\u2026\u2019So, that means\u2026 the chance of me having a good time in this restaurant today is practically zero.\u201cTallion, do you happen to be wearing a necklace or something?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dTallion looked startled at my question and fidgeted around his neck.It was a necklace with an emblem engraved in the middle. It was an item I remember.\u201cThis was given by the House of Purification. The foundation run by Marquis Riverback. Only a few talented people sponsored by them could have it.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dAs expected.Since the scenario got twisted like my arm.Shouldn\u2019t I also set a trap card of my own?[ Skill: Evil Ruler has been activated. ][ Exercising command right to the target \u2018Tallion\u2019. ]\u201cDon\u2019t wear it today.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cAnd do your best to prevent others from wearing it if you can. Understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI patted the dumbfounded Tallion on the shoulder and entered the restaurant.\u2018\u2026Yeah, well.\u2019With this alone, I took a considerable \u2018advantage\u2019 against Marquis Riverback.\u201cAh, Mr. Dowd Campbell. Welcome.\u201dInside, a smiling Marquis Riverback greeted me.\u2018Bring it on, you bastard.\u2019Chapter 1.

All it takes is a word from Marquis Riverback.I secretly glanced at the tattoos on their necks.It is the seal of the PURIFIER, a group of devil worshipers.\u2018Is it one of the factions?\u2019The main enemies of the scenario are devils and devil worshipers who they influenced.Basically, they hate humanity and peace, and consider unleashing chaos and evil in the world as their lifelong goal. They have nothing else to do.And the PURIFIERS are especially obsessed with the Tristan Family.The story goes that the devil lives in the Tristan Family\u2019s bloodline.They are aware, to some extent, of the fact that the resurrection of the \u2018Gray Devil\u2019 is related to this lineage.They are the ones who threw a boulder at Elnore in the train, sneaking professional assassins into the school and detonated the bomb at the freshman welcome party and releasing the caged monsters.\u201cPrincess Tristan, long time no see.\u201dSeeing him smile as he saw Elnore, I really want to applaud his straight brazenness.Meanwhile, when Elnore entered the restaurant and saw Marquis Riverback, her expression hardened even more.\u2018Pretty sure they aren\u2019t in good terms.\u2019Marquis Riverback is one of the representative political opponents of the Tristan Family.He\u2019s acting as a liaison for a group, that was secretly working behind the scenes, to be exact.\"\"\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Marquis Riverback.\u201d\u201cYes. How have you been?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re just going to talk nonsense, would you please step back? This is the least desirable time for me to get disturbed by you.\u201dBut despite her chilling tone, Marquis Riverback continued to smile and even beckoned to the people around him.\u201cI want to respect the princess\u2019s wishes, but I have something to do here.\u201dThen, he snapped his fingers and the men standing near him moved in unison.It\u2019s basically telling to follow his direction, otherwise\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll borrow this man for a moment, Princess.\u201d\u201cWho says-\u201dElnore was about to raise her voice but suddenly stopped midway.I came closer and whispered something in her ear.\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter that, I smiled at Elnore, whose eyes slightly widened.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026Dowd? That\u2019s-\u201d\u201cIt will be over soon, it won\u2019t take long.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElnore mumbled something under her breath.Uh. It will be over really soon.In the first place.It may already be over.\u25cf\u201cIt seems like you\u2019re in good terms with Princess Tristan?\u201dMarquis Riverback said so with a smile.\u201cYes. Is there any problem?\u201dAcross him, Dowd Campbell opened the tray lid while slightly frowning at those words.He was about to start eating.He had thick nerves, seeing as he didn\u2019t even pay attention to the fact that he was invited by a person with unknown intentions. Much less, reading the atmosphere.\u2018\u2026He looks incompetent.\u2019Marquis Riverback thought so as he glared at the other party.He has heard several reports of this person being strangely close to the hero candidate, and his target, Princess Tristan.So he was expecting, at least, something special from the man to warrant this phenomenon.However, the man in front of him was disappointing.He was the embodiment of a talentless fool that it was almost unbelievable.\u2018But the Prophet\u2026\u2019He swallowed saliva with his dry mouth at the thought of his \u2018Master\u2019.A being called the Prophet by devil worshipers.All devil worshippers, including the PURIFIERS, were merely tools to him.Marquis Riverback\u2019s position as a Viscount and his reputation as a prominent businessman in the empire were all due to a single word from the Prophet.The Prophet\u2019s influence, power, and evil had already seeped like poison into the three hegemons, and its tentacles had reached every corner of the continent.Compared to him, Marquis Riverback\u2019s position as a Viscount was nothing but a bug.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd yet, such an existence was interested in this insignificant man in front of him.Marquis Riverback couldn\u2019t figure out why, but one thing is clear.His original plan of approaching the hero candidate was changed to approaching this man because of the Prophet.\u201cDo you know why I called you here, Mr. Dowd?\u201dBut first, he has to \u2018encourage\u2019 this man to his side, just like what he intended to do with the hero candidate.To be exact, it\u2019s to blackmail him into cooperating with them.\u2018Things are going perfectly.\u2019He doesn\u2019t know what the hell this man was thinking, but he delivered their main target, Princess Tristan, in front of their doorstep.Its currently the Full Moon Festival so the security is at its weakest due to the festive atmosphere.\u2018The grace of God shall descend to this Heaven and Earth.\u2019Devil energy is sensitive to chaos and fear. So if blood and death drown this festival, the slumbering devil inside Princess Tristan will definitely respond.The Prophet has professed the Tristan family\u2019s lineage as related to the devil.Now, all his extensive preparation and years as a Viscount is finally culminating today.\u2018The plan is perfect.\u2019The Prophet had bestowed the position of Viscount upon him for this moment.There was no room for error, not the slightest mishap.\u201c\u2026\u201dNow, this Dowd, person.If he doesn\u2019t comply, then Marquis Riverback could just threaten him with death. And since he seems to have a good relationship with the Princess, they can use that as well.He\u2019s like a dung bettle rolling around in manure.As Marquis Riverback was deep in his thoughts, Dowd, who had been munching on a piece of meat, suddenly looked back at him with a blank stare.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It felt so stupid.Why did the Prophet had him meet this guy?But he suppressed the pathetic feeling and continued.\u201cI asked if you knew why I called you here.\u201d\u201cAh, that.\u201dDowd Campbell\u2019s voice was still relaxed.\u201cAren\u2019t you just going to babble about resurrecting the devil or something?\u201dHe said those words with such leisure.Meanwhile, Marquis Riverback unknowingly held his breath at this sudden turn.\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s currently the Full Moon Festival where the security is at its weakest. Aren\u2019t you aiming to create a bloodbath to resurrect the devil?\u201dHe was casually listing out information as if he had read Marquis Riverback\u2019s mind.\u201cSince the Marquis deals with transportation business, you should have no problem in smuggling the goods inside the Golden Triangle. You can easily disguise the monsters as something else in the transport.\u201dThis was his plan that, other than the Prophet, was kept hidden from the devil worshipers\u2019 executives specifically for security reasons.\u201cYou set up bombs all around and detonate them at once, and unleash the monsters. Meanwhile, the knights on standby will have to deal with the assassins.\u201dEverything flowed out of his mouth without pause. It was no different than an attitude one would use in chatting, while eating a delicious meal.Dowd took another bite and continued.\u201cThe multiple assassination attempts on Princess Tristan and the monster stampede at the welcome party don\u2019t really matter. In the first place, the fact that the monsters and assassins successfully caused a disturbance meant that the basic conditions for using them were met. You were initially just testing the waters. \u201dIt wasn\u2019t just his plan, but even the moves he\u2019s taken and his intentions. This guy had seen through everything accurately.The same plan that he thought was perfect until now.The plan that only he and the Prophet knew, and worked hard on for many years.In just a few seconds, everything was laid bare by the man he thought as a fool.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, really.\u201dAh, this sauce is delicious.Dowd Campbell said with a smirk.Still.It looked like he\u2019s more interested in the meal than \u2018that kind of thing\u2019.Watching this, Marquis Riverback unconsciously clenched his chair\u2019s armrest.A thick drop of sweat ran down his forehead to his nose, but he didn\u2019t have time to pay attention to it.\u201cYou, just who are you?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you always the reckless and aggressive type? What are you pretending to be polite about for?\u201dDespite his growling, the response from the other party remained composed. It\u2019s as if he had always known him.Like he knew him well from long before.\u201cWell, as for what I just said, I\u2019ve taken care of everything.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe President even personally moved the knights for me, after I reported this.\u201dMarquis Riverback gritted his teeth.\u2018\u2026I\u2019ve miscalculated\u2026!\u2019The intention was to raise devil worshipers by sponsoring and nurturing the empire\u2019s talents. However, the alarm was ringing in full volume right now.He doesn\u2019t know how, but this man has seen through and foiled the entire plan on his own.It was no different than him taking a leisurely stroll.A rustling noise sounded.\u2018\u2026I was the fool.\u2019This guy is a monster.He isn\u2019t exuding any sort of aura like that of the hero candidate or Princess Tristan, but he\u2019s probably more dangerous in terms of threat level.Typical monsters are like brilliantly burning flames, impressive both in appearance and their ways, and always exuding an intimidating presence.But, this guy.He\u2019s like frozen steel.You won\u2019t know just how cold it is until you actually touch it. It doesn\u2019t appear as dangerous at all.But the moment you mess with it, it\u2019ll eat your flesh up without mercy.He know understands a little bit why the Prophet wanted this guy.\u2018They\u2019re birds of the same feather\u2026!\u2019He looks harmless on the outside but insidious on the inside, like raising dozens of snakes in a hole.He controls the atmosphere!\u201c\u2026I admit it. You\u2019re no ordinary person\u2026\u201dThen Marquis Riverback grabbed his necklace.\u201cBut you should know that.\u201dHe pressed a button on it which sent a \u2018signal\u2019 to all those wearing the same necklace.\u201cEverything is not in your palm.\u201dHe smiled slyly.As with all schemers, every plan had to have an insurance.This guy will never be able to stop this.\u25cf\u2013Let\u2019s if you\u2019ll have the same conviction after.Looking at Marquis Riverback, who is smiling triumphantly, I couldn\u2019t help but think so.[ Skill: Fatal Charm has been Activated! ][ The villain is in awe of your slyness! ][ Rewards Available! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat slyness?Seriously?\"\"Well, anyway.\u201cMy men should already be on their way downstairs to subdue Princess Tristan. They are the cream of the crop that\u2019s been selected through the House of Purification project.\u201dMarquis Riverback said with a look of composure.I guess he was talking about the guys from before.\u201cYou may have disrupted my plan, but we can still proceed with it as long as you\u2019re here. They are all strong individuals who are comparable to knights. Even Princess Tristan will be subdued.\u201dHe seemed confident in himself.\u2018\u2026Well, they\u2019re not really bona fide knights.\u2019Knights are super humans rumored to have blue blood flowing in their veins.Regardless, if Marquis Riverback\u2019s men are comparable to the level of a knight, then it\u2019s understandable where he got such confidence.It\u2019s just that I had to interrupt you in your speech.\u201cTry it, then.\u201dWhen I said that, Marquis Riverback was bewildered again.\u201c\u2026What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cTry it.\u201dI brought Elnore to this place for a reason.Even if she\u2019s the final boss, there haven\u2019t been many opportunities to see her majesty properly until now.In the first place, she was always suppressing her madness because of mental limitations.However, as far as I know.\u2018\u2026It\u2019s better to let it loose sometimes.\u2019Considering the context, it\u2019s just right.It\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t a way to get rid of it completely, but it\u2019s currently impossible.Until then, it\u2019s better to let it out.More importantly, these are \u2018devil worshipers\u2019, so she can proceed without any guilt.\u201c\u2026\u201dIf she can release it without any restraint, one would see why she is the final boss.\u201cIt\u2019s good that they\u2019re elites.\u201dSimply because\u2026\u201cThey\u2019ll be good punching bags for Elnore.\u201dElnore didn\u2019t get trapped.They were trapped with Elnore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Someone who will accept my everything. When was the last time I had such a hope?

What are you babbling\u2026\u201dElnore grabbed a wine bottle nearby and gulped down the whole thing.It was an outrageous act that didn\u2019t fit her status as a noblewoman.But strangely, it didn\u2019t feel out of place.It was a sign that she had been suppressing something for a long time.\u201cBut sometimes, there are things that don\u2019t betray you.\u201d\u201c\u2026I told you to stand up.\u201dThe man, who spoke first, irritatedly strode towards Elnore.He was clearly going to force her to stand up.Elnore looked several times smaller compared to the man\u2019s giant, well-trained body.However, the next moment.Elnore grabbed the man\u2019s big arm.\u201c\u2026!\u201dBlood gushed out of the spot where she held, as the man\u2019s muscles tore and his bones shattered.Just as the man\u2019s eyes widened and was processing the situation in shock, without skipping a beat, Elnore grabbed his head and slammed it onto the table.The wine bottle she had just been drinking from also fell from the impact.Blood sprayed and glass shards scattered everywhere.\u201c\u2026What!\u201dAs the people around her drew their swords in fear, Elnore simply smirked and casually threw the completely unconscious man aside.The sight of the massive man getting leisurely thrown like a crumpled piece of paper was almost unreal.\u201cWith so many eyes around me, I\u2019ve been holding back a bit lately.\u201dHer red eyes gleamed menacingly, making her seem more like a beast than a human.\u201cIt\u2019s been really difficult.\u201d\u201cYou must not kill her, it\u2019s top priority! We can tolerate some injury, but you must capture her alive\u2026\u201dOne of the armed men said such words.A second later, he was slammed into the wall by Elnore\u2019s fist.\u201cCapture me alive, huh. That\u2019s interesting.\u201dThe men unconsciously took a step back, as they didn\u2019t even saw her move.Her strength and agility was beyond imagination.\u201cI have no intention of letting you guys do that.\u201dAs Elnore said so, the man she had just sent flying picked up his dropped sword on the ground.Meanwhile, Dowd\u2019s words from earlier echoed in her ears.\u2018These guys are devil worshipers.\u2019\u2018You\u2019ve been having a hard time lately, haven\u2019t you?\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know about later, but for this situation, holding back would be worse.\u2019She smirked.In fact, it is dangerous to trust accusations of devil worshipers without evidence, unless its from the empire\u2019s notorious heresy inquisitors. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t even know you\u2019ve met a devil worshipper.However, the one who told her this was Dowd Campbell. If she doesn\u2019t believe him, what else can she believe?\u2018Here.\u2019She\u2019ll let everything out.She just can\u2019t hate the man.Releasing one\u2019s madness like this was one of the time-honored methods of relief in the long history of the Tristan Family.She had no idea how the man knew about this.Nor does she know what he meant by, \u201cI don\u2019t know about later.\u201dHowever.She had come to realize that she had reached a critical point in suppressing her madness.In other words.\u201cIn accordance to the imperial law, executing demon worshippers on the spot and reporting it afterwards is no problem. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dA fierce gleam flashed through her blood-red eyes, and a chilling aura descended upon the entire space. It\u2019s as if the air itself froze into ice.Everyone present felt a sense of foreboding.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThey had heard the rumors.Among the best swordsmen in the continent, a young lady was famous for her exceptional talent since childhood.From the beginning, they never thought it would be easy to face her. But they also didn\u2019t think that they wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it.After all, everyone here is a warrior deserving of such confidence.They are steel-like talents forged in the melting pot of real combat. They are the elites of the elites that Marquis Riverback trained to the best of his abilities.However.What stands before them right now is\u2026What is in front of them right now is not just a \u201cskilled swordsman.\u201dRather, all the human-like sensations she had just moments ago were wiped away, replaced by an unidentifiable brutality and hostility.This is\u2026 the \u201csomething\u201d that takes on the form of Princess Tristian.It is as black as ink, so much so that it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s even human!\u201cSo. Be ready to kill.\u201dWell, anyway.It\u2019s a gift from that man.Her face is still expressionless like usual. But if Dowd saw her now, he would probably think that Elnore was \u201cgenuinely smiling.\u201dAs if causing harm without the fear of repercussion is the most fun and enjoyable thing.\u201cThat way, you\u2019ll be able to hold out a little longer.\u201dSubsequently.Absolute mayhem ensued.\u25cfIn total, it took 3 minutes and 30 seconds.That\u2019s how long it took Elnore to reach us.\u201c\u2026Impossible\u2026\u201dLooking at the dazed Marquis Riverback muttering like that, I would have probably bust out laughing on a regular day.But, isn\u2019t this a bit too much?\u201c\u2026Are you okay?\u201dAs I asked in a stiff voice, Elnore pursed her lips and tossed the two bloodied bodies away.Watching her drag them around like they were trophies gave me chills.\u201cWell, it was refreshing. I think I\u2019ll be fine for a while.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElnore was in the first floor at the entrance of the restaurant, while Marquis Riverback and I are in a special room on the top floor.\"\"But right now, this person has managed to single-handedly slice through dozens to hundreds of people who were densely packed together, and make their way up here.An elite force that Marquis Riverback could boast of being \u2018comparable to the Knights\u2019 were wiped out by her.All while wearing a one-piece dress.And in just a few minutes.\u2018Isn\u2019t this a real monster\u2026?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But against dozens to hundreds of elite troops?It would already be considered good if I can hold out even for a few seconds.Even Marquis Riverback, whose confidence was soaring just now, abruptly blanked out.After all, the tower that he\u2019s built up over many years was destroyed in just a few minutes by one person.As I was at a loss for words, Elnore\u2019s brows furrowed as if she suddenly remembered something.\u201cAh, that\u2019s right.\u201dCalmly throwing away two bloodied corpses, she came towards me.\u201cCome to think of it, it was not a good idea.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cIt was hard.

He\u2019s completely mentally crushed.\u201c\u2026\u201dWell, it\u2019s understandable, considering that the thing he\u2019s been proudly building to perfection for years got destroyed in less than 5 minutes.\u201cGive up, Marquis Riverback.\u201dElnore went on calmly.\u201cIt\u2019ll be your end once it gets out that you are associated with devil worshippers.

Dowd! Are you okay!\u201dI hear a voice calling me like that amidst my faint consciousness.Then I could feel a hand pulling me out from the rubble of the collapsed building.Dust and broken debris tumble from my body.\u201c\u2026Elnore?\u201dAs I was dragged out, I met eyes with Elnore, who was looking at me with a worried look.\u201cYou\u2026!\u201dElnore's eyes shook as she fully confirmed my condition.I'm probably pretty injured.Well, I was helplessly crushed by a collapsed building.\u201c\u2026\u201dThis is what happens when the skill doesn\u2019t activate.As I confirmed before in the mock dungeon, the skill would only react to attacks that are 'hostile.'If it was simply a building collapsing due to the aftermath of the impact, then Dowd Campbell's F stats will remain as is.\u2018Fractures, concussion, dislocated joints\u2026\u2019My vision was shaky as I feel warm liquid flowing down my face. I was dizzy and uncomfortable.\u201c\u2026Huu.\u201dRight. This is how it goes.An insect-like existence's life, whose stats are all F, is as fragile as a candle in the wind. There's simply no other way around it.\u301a\u2026This is amazing.\u301bWith quivering eyes, I stared up at the sky where a mutated Marquis Riverback floated.The Devil's Essence that he swallowed earlier is now lodged in the middle of his chest, pulsating like a heart.With demonic energy wrapping around his body like armor, he was already too far gone from being human.An abomination.There is no other way to put it.\u301aWhen the Prophet gave me this, I wondered if there would even be a situation where I would use this.\u301bHe grinned as he looked down at me and Elnore.\u301aI\u2019ll admit it. You were more troublesome than I thought. \u301bThen, he flew up to a higher altitude.\u301aHowever, will you be able to handle this?\u301bYeah.I wonder about that too, you btch.\u2018\u2026Straight from the first chapter.\u2019I can't believe this worldly bullsht.Looking at Marquis River back swiftly flying away, I inwardly sighed. It\u2019s a speed that I didn't even try to think of catching up to.Originally, the \u2018corrupted power\u2019 that Marquis Riverback would have used is generally like a devil by-product.It's a power that humans have researched and crudely mimicked.On the other hand, the \u2018Devil's Essence\u2019...They are items that contain the \u2018remnants\u2019 of the devil. Using it will turn one into a demon, able to wield a very small portion of their power.For example.-!-!!!Elnore\u2019s expression hardened upon seeing 'things' suddenly rising from the fallen debris.Without a semblance of their human form, a 'thing' couldn't be more apt in describing their grotesque shapes. They're but amalgamations of melted flesh.Their screeches, like metal scraping, clearly indicated their hostility to every living being nearby.\u201cHii, hiik!\u201d\u201cWhat is that\u2026!\u201dCurious about the sudden collapse of a building, people naturally started to gather to get a whiff of the large-scale incident. However, they immediately bolted away after seeing these freaks of nature.\u2018\u2026This is not good.\u2019The spread of demonic energy will spawn creatures similar to those in Pandemonium, the devil's home.And these? These are the same devil worshipers that Elnore had cut down earlier.Under the influence of Marquis Riverback, who turned into a demon, they transformed into \u2018Man Eaters\u2019, the bottom dwellers of the Pandemonium.Other than their threatening combat power, what\u2019s more troublesome was that any human they killed will also turn into a Man Eater.It\u2019s a chain reaction, like a zombie apocalypse.To make matters worse, they were in the middle of a busy shopping district, and the area was packed with people who had come for the Full Moon Festival.It was the worst place at the worst time.[ Main Quest ]\u3016 Chapter 1 \u2013 Purifier \u3017[ Defeat the \u2018Purifier\u2019! ][ It's game over if there's too many casualties!! ][ Reward: 1 Evil Essence ][ Reward: 1 Hero Fragment ][ Reward: 5,000pt ]And once again, the system did not disappoint, as a damned quest appeared right in front of my eyes.Reducing the number of casualties here is not a joke.-!-!!Right after the Man Eaters mutated, a lightning-like blow suddenly shut their mouths.It was a textbook strike using a spear. Several Man Eaters who tried to stand up were pierced and got sent flying.\u201cHyeong-nim! What the hell is this\u2026!\u201dWiping the blood on my forehead, I saw Tallion running towards me from a distance.Did this guy make that strike?\"I heard a commotion and came to see what's going on! What are those monsters, and Marquis Riverback...!\"This is nice to see.Originally, at this point, this guy should have become corrupted and turned into something similar to that.\u201cIf you were still wearing the necklace, you would have turned into something like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dInstead of answering, I simply pointed my finger at one of the Man Eaters.The evil energy emanating from the House of Purification's necklace, that's still hanging around its neck, is clearly visible to anyone.Normally, it would just end with them losing a bit of their sanity. But now, they've completely crossed a river of no return as they've transformed into a Man Eater.Seeing this, Tallion\u2019s eyes widened.\u201c\u2026This.\u201dHis expression rapidly changed by the second.He's probably quickly organizing the current situation in his head.\"I just want to confirm one thing.\"\"What is it?\"\"...Did Marquis Riverback lead this incident?\"He had dropped the honorifics. He may be asking a question, but he already seemed half-convinced.He was probably told to \u2018make sure to wear the necklace\u2019 several times on a regular basis.I smiled at the anger in Tallion's eyes.Well, he ain't no npc.As someone designed to be Elijah\u2019s rival, his ability to judge and act in an emergency could not be compared to ordinary students.\u201cWe can discuss responsibility and mistakes later. For now, if we don\u2019t deal with that, this place will become hell.\u201dHe somehow stabalized his shaky gaze and aptly conveyed.I have gained his \u2018trust\u2019 by making him take off the necklace.And now, it\u2019s time to reap this advantage.\u201cListen to me carefully. If you make even one mistake, it's over.\u201dI proceeded to give him instructions.At first, he was listening to me with a serious expression, then it changed to absurdity, and in the end, he was looking at me like he was looking at a madman.\u201c\u2026That, is that even possible?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt has to.I didn't run around everywhere for nothing.If you can\u2019t do that much, it's the end.\u201cThen, what about Hyeong-nim\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to take care of something else.\u201d\u2018I have two goals.\u2019The first is to prevent civilian casualties in the area.The Man Eaters are still sluggish right now, but as time passes and the demonic energy grows thicker, they will become faster and stronger.Most of the \u2018instructions\u2019 I just gave Tallion were just to block them.And the second goal is...\u201cWe need to cut the root.\u201dWe need to eliminate Marquis Riverback, the source of the demonic energy.That's what I'm going to do.\u201cDo you know where he went?\u201dElnore asked in a low voice.She's probably asking how we could chase after someone flying that fast.\u201cYes, well. I have my guess.\u201dShould I say that I have an idea?Actually, there is only one.I can\u2019t make mistakes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And all that was just by joining the 'winning' side.\u2018Their power reaches every corner of the continent.\u2019A devil 'follower's' power is formidable, without question.Among them, the power of the \u2018Chosen Ones\u2019, who are the closest to the Prophet, could literally boil the sea, crack the earth and split the heavens.Compared to them, he was but an insect crawling under their soles. The reason he survived for so long was because he always reminded himself of that fact.Thus, after confirming it himself, he decided to stand on their side without hesitation.It's probably because of the quick thinking unique to merchants, but he can infer that no one on the continent could dare stand against them.At this very moment, Marquis River back could never be more confident that he picked right.\u301aHuuu\u2026\u301bAn almighty sigh escaped his mouth.An overwhelming amount of demonic energy coursed through his body.So much so that he could crush weak beings just by pressure alone.This was the power he gained just by accepting a little of the 'new god's' grace.\u301aAt this level\u2026\u301bCarrying out the mission would be a breeze.To resurrect the devil, he needed to bring despair and confusion everywhere.Kill a man, kill a couple, and then, simply continue piling up the corpses.He can start with that.He happens to be just in the right place for that.\u301aGo.\u301bHe muttered as he reached his hand out to the \u2018barrier\u2019 in front of him.It was the one near the Void Zone, said to have been set up by a seraphim.Normally, this place would be heavily guarded. Let alone, breaking through it, he wouldn\u2019t even be able to damage it.But since it's the Full Moon Festival, it was easy. Not to mention that he now possesses the devil\u2019s power.Even if he still couldn't break it, he could put a dent on it.Considering the special nature of the Void Zone, this alone would lead to an unimaginable disasters.\u2018\u2026This is ultimately the key.\u2019The riots going on in the city right now are nothing more than a smoke screen distraction.Probably all available armed forces are concentrated there.Meanwhile, his real goal is here.\u201cHey, stop moving.\u201dUnfortunately.Not everyone was stupid.\u25cf\u301a...How did you know?\u301bMarquis Riverback, who was trying to damage the barrier, stiffly asked.\u201cLike I said earlier. It\u2019s obvious.\u201dMarquis Riverback, should I say...?He's a single-celled organism who thinks he's smart.The type who want to feel superiority above others, and worming his way with \u2018deceit\u2019.\u2018\u2026Is he an idiot?\u2019To be honest, I don't think there's anything more inefficient than this.If he just controlled the Man Eaters to push through here, the barrier would've been damaged.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, thanks to his ego of going himself, an opportunity like this arose.I will pierce through that vanity and conceit.So I started organising a plan.If there were Man Eaters standing in my way, I wouldn't even dream of a situation like this, but now he's alone.\u201cSo, Dear.\u201dI've realized that one of Elnore's greatest strengths is her endless physical abilities.She carried me and moved through the streets while still being so fast, especially since I'm so badly injured that even moving is difficult.\u201cWhat's the plan?\u201dElnore asked, after accepting my request of bringing me here without hesitation.I could see unwavering trust reflected in her eyes.\u201cThere must be a reason why we decided to drop all support and come here with just us two.\u201d\u201cWell, yes?\u201dIt\u2019s because we are hard pressed in time.There is no time to call for others. If that guy makes even a slight crack in the barrier, it's game over.People will die, Elnore will be kidnapped, and the Gray Devil will be unleashed.It's a one way ticket to a bad ending.Rather than that, it's better if we came here first to put a pause to everything, then we can come to a decision.\u201cOkay, so how do we beat him\u2026\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201dElnore\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cWe can't win against him. Never.\u201dThis was the truth.To confront a demon, Elijah needed a \u2018Holy Sword\u2019 to stand on equal grounds.But that's something that will come, at least, only after Chapter 4. She's still in her growth stage.In other words, her counterpart in the novel would be no different.Even as the final boss, a budding Elnore and me who's seriously injured, simply cannot match against the transformed Marquis Riverback.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever.It's not the end of the world just yet.\u2013You've been bitten by something terrible. I can\u2019t see its full form yet, but I can tell it\u2019s bad. It seems to have stuck because of your abilitiesI suddenly remember those words. The angel has warned me this before.Yeah. I know.I am aware of what's 'stuck to me' means to some extent.<System Message>[ The target \u2018???\u2019 is interested in you. ]I smirked as I read the system log.And this too...< Gift-related Character Notification >\u2665 Elnore Elinalise La Tristan[ Love Level 1][ \u2018Skill Copy Ticket\u2019 is available! ]The last reason is this.The 'Love Level 1' and Skill Copy Ticket.With this, even against an enemy that we can never beat at our current level, we'd have a fighting chance.While I was in my thoughts, Marquis Riverback sighed and raised his demonic energy.\u301a\u2026Well, no matter. \u301bA reverberation of demonic energy began to brew like a storm around him.It was so potent and dense that if you let your mind slip for even a little, you'll faint.What\u2019s absurd is that this isn\u2019t even the full release of demonic energy \u2013 it\u2019s but a \u2018prelude\u2019 to the attack.\u301a I just need to kill you and secure Princess Tristan. This is actually better. Since you've served yourselves up in your own accord, you've saved me the trouble of searching. \u301bFrom this point on, we will fight this guy.Taking a deep breath, I said to Elnore.\u201cElnore, promise me one thing.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt's going to be painful. It'll be excruciating. You might even hate me\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dAt first glance, it might sound like an impatient request to get to the point, but...If someone were to meet that straightforward gaze, they would give a slightly different response.Whatever you say is fine.I've already accepted it, so don't worry and tell me.That's what it means.\u201c\u2026\u201dI couldn't help but laugh at myself.It was always like this.The level of trust this person places in me is unbelievable.That's why, I must live up to that trust.\u201cNo matter what happens. Without fail.\u201dI replied with direct eye contact.\u201cI will get us out of here alive, okay?\u201d\u201cHmm, okay.\u201d\u201cSo.\u201dI looked away from Elnore and turned to Marquis Riverback.\u201cWhatever happens, please trust me.\u201dUh. Really.What I'm about to do is insane.As I thought so, Marquis Riverback rushed towards us like a raging tsunami.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Due to the influence of demonic energy, recovery is weakened. ]For a Minor Healing Potion, it was filthy expensive.Although potions are rare in Sera, it's still hella expensive. Moreover, its effect is even weakened because of the boss battle.And despite having spent all my points, the pain from my twisted joints was only slightly alleviated.However, this was a desperate situation.\u201c\u2026\u201dGritting my teeth, I dodged the attack flying towards me.Each 'Chapter Boss' in the world of Sera has a unique skill.They basically have an extra sword that you can\u2019t find in normal opponents.And that\u2019s why Marquis Riverback was called the Purifier rather than 'Grunt A'.-!As the demonic energy emitted by Marquis Riverback was about hit Elnore, a shield appeared before her and bounced the attack off with a loud bang.It was the same shield that had previously protected Elnore in the train accident.\u301aFool, you can't stop me!\u301bHowever, despite being able to fend off a huge boulder with ease, the shield was completely shattered as Marquis Riverback\u2019s attack swung back like a boomerang.Yes, this was his skill.He's able to 'dissolve' some of the power of an opponent\u2019s attack or defense.It was as if he's 'purifying' them.\u201c\u2026Ah, damn it.\u201dThis was really too much.A shield of that caliber can't just be broken like glass. Alas, Marquis Riverback's power soared exponentially after the demonic transformation.[ A moment of danger has been detected. ][ Determined the situation as life-threatening. ][ Skill: Desperation raised to EX Class. ][ !Warning! ][ Confirmed existence of opponent's unique skill \u2018Purification\u2019. ][ Skill: Desperation downgraded to C Class. ]And to rub salt on wounds, this happened.The disparity between EX Class and C Class is roughly the same as a person who can K.O. the future hero with one punch and a normal person who works out regularly.It was a heaven and earth difference!Gritting through the pain and screaming inwardly, I forcefully rolled to the side, which was no different than torture to a seriously injured body.[ Attribute: Breathing Technique \u2013 Duckweed proficiency has increased! ]The only reason why I'm barely able to hold on was because of the attribute I received from Elnore not too long ago. If it weren't for this, I wouldn't even think of moving my body right now.Immediately after, a black beam passed through where I was just standing, leaving my hairs stand on their ends.Although it was a 'light' attack, it left a huge crater as if a missile had exploded.This was like that guy\u2019s basic attack.\u2018The difficulty is no joke\u2026!\u2019Even as I was thinking this, I was giving precise instructions to Elnore.\u201cElnore, to the left!\u201dUsing the gap created while he was attacking me, Elnore charged forward with her sword.The tip of her sword was sharp. Even for Elijah, who was called a heavenly talent, the strike was akin smashing into a wall.However, despite being perfectly executed and timed...\u301aHa!\u301bIt got blocked as if it was very obvious.With just a slight 'release' of demonic energy, Elnore rebounded from the shock wave and rolled over to my side.Things aren't looking good.Even the future Final Boss was being pushed backShe was covered in dust and dirt, and her one-piece dress was torn and soaked in blood from the injuries all over her body.It was an unimaginable image for someone who always appeared perfect and neat in the original story.Looking at the clock, it's only been a minute since the battle began.With just that much, we're on the brink of losing everything.Meanwhile, Marquis Riverback was only gradually driving us back without showing any real intention.\u2018I have the strategy.\u2019I thought so with a dizzy head, as Elnore grabbed me and dodged another incoming attack.The timing is on point. The methodology is also correct. The chance to attack the Marquis Riverback was created based on the timing and path that I remember.However.That all may be perfect, but we lack the \u2018capacity\u2019 to carry it out.A demon\u2019s body is a monstrosity that can break rocks and fly through the air. Even the monsters whose intellect has degenerated and focused all on physical abilities can't hold a candle.And even if they're wounded, they can quickly recover with the demonic energy supplied from the essence.\u201c\u2026\u201dThis was not good. In fact, this situation was at its worst.In this battle, Elnore and I needed to work together. Elnore doesn\u2019t know how to \u2018fight\u2019 him and can't just rush forward because of his 'purification'.I'm the only one who knows all his attack patterns. Without my instructions, it's difficult to even attempt to attack him.\u301a Fight me, you worms! Stop this game of catch! \u301bMarquis Riverback shouted as he flew towards us. This will continue for a while.\u2018The important thing right now is to lure this guy away from the barrier.\u2019If the barrier gets damaged during the fight, it would be a big problem.If I were Marquis Riverback, I would have prioritized breaking the barrier regardless of any interference. But he is a vain and conceited person.It means that for now, he would prioritize revenge against me and Elnore first, who just cornered him earlier.Moreover, his rational judgment has become increasingly blurred due to the influence of the demonic energy.He's also throwing a fit and using crude words, rather than his usual dignified formal language.This becomes even more evident once you consider his style of faking formality till death.But what does this all mean?It means that it is the perfect time to set up a trap.\u201c\u2026We have to bring him to the academy.\u201dI whispered to Elnore, who was carrying me like a burden.Due to the Full Moon Festival and the emergency that occurred in the city, the outskirts of Elfante were most likely deserted right now.The Deans and the President are probably all focused in the city, so we can't really expect any support from them. However, this also means that we are free to do things without worrying about collateral damage.This was my aim.With that thought in mind, I continued to repeat the routine I've done so far.Get hurt a little, buy time, lure him away.It\u2019s just a matter of giving him enough to relish and not lose his attention.Despite severely lacking in many aspects, I was enduring it somehow.I'm doing the same this time too.I avoid the attacks he throws at me, and instruct Elnore to launch a counterattack, followed by dodging to minimize the damage caused by his retaliation as much as possible-\u301a\u2026By the way.\u301bHe suddenly said in the middle of the battle.At this moment, I could feel chills running through my spine. There was something amiss.For starters, he was speaking in a voice that maintained reason, unlike his rage-filled voice from earlier.This guy.Was he just pretending to be 'lured' by us all along?\u301a Do I look like a fool to you? Did you seriously think that I wouldn't notice you trying to lure me away? \u301bAs he said that, Marquis Riverback\u2019s chest suddenly trembled and the darkness inside him stirred.It was as if the demonic energy he's been lashing out at us until now was just the leftovers of the bigger one he's been collecting.And by the sight of it, a sense of crisis, stronger than anything else in my life, constricted my body.Just like how I hid my \u2018intentions\u2019 from this guy, he also hid something and responded back!\u301a You're the kind of person that'll ruin everything if left alone. \u301bThen from the chest, Marqui Riverback's heart, a murky darkness started to spread out.Despite it being the evening, it was clearly visible as if it was repelling every wave and particle of light in its path.[Surely, you're done with that.]Subsequently.The soaring \u2018dark curtain\u2019 descended upon me.[ Soul Linker Activated. ][ Magic Power Received. ][ Skill \u2018Penance\u2019 has been used. ][ Skill \u2018Guardian Shield\u2019 has been used. ]That was the last thing I remember.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My body was convulsing uncontrollably.\u201c\u2026 K-kuluk\u2026!\u201dAfter coughing out coagulated blood, I took a look at the current state of my body.My left arm was utterly destroyed.Both my lower and upper body were completely smashed, torn and broken. Not a single part of my body was saved from being wedged with pieces of nasty-looking stone, glass fragments and tree branches.My whole body was in tatters.How I am alive right now was a even question.It's a miracle with the kind of injuries I had sustained.\u201c\u2026\u201dRegardless, I tried to force myself up.\u201c\u2026Ah, ack\u2026!\u201dMy vision was stained red.And my body was trembling all over.From deep within my nerves, I felt a spark of new sensation that I have never experienced before in my life.\u201c\u2026\u201dAlas, I fell right back to the ground as I gasped for air.I was wholly immobile.\u201c\u2026Fck.\u201dCursing, I supported myself with my healthy right arm and reached out for the Divine's Ultima, that was in the edge of my vision.If I hadn't been able to create a shield at the very last moment, I would have died.Demonic energy is particularly vulnerable to divinity. And it\u2019s because of this advantage that the power of the attack was reduced.\u201c\u2026Are you kidding me, really.\u201dIn the meantime, I could hear a round of laughter.I could see the academy building not too far away.Just from that attack, I had flown over hundreds of meters from where Elnore and I fought against Marquis Riverback.I'm seriously relieved that I didn\u2019t die in one shot.\u301aDid you survive that?\u301bThough, hearing this made me reconsider that maybe I am not so lucky.Barely able to turn my body, I saw Marquis Riverback walking toward me from a short distance away.Even with that demonic energy-filled body, I could clearly see that mocking smirk.\u301aYou're much more tenacious than I thought. The Prophet would be pleased.\u301bAfter saying that, he reached out to my face.\u301aLooks like you\u2019ve exhausted all your cards.\u301bThen, demonic energy started to gather on his palm.\u301aTo be honest, you were a great opponent. If you meet a friend in hell, you can confidently brag about it.\u301b\u201c\u2026\u201dThere is no way out.The downgraded Desperation wouldn't be able to withstand it. Not even an upgrade to EX class would change anything. I can\u2019t even move my body at this point.But there's still one thing left.-!-!!!A sword suddenly cut through the air and slashed Marquis Riverback\u2019s neck.It was a terrifying blow that could cut down even steel, but it only slightly penetrated his skin before getting repelled.The wound also healed instantly as if it was never there.However, thanks to this, the impending attack towards me was canceled.\u301a\u2026You're really quite the persistent pair. You'll make a good couple.\u301bElnore retrieved her sword and quickly approached me as he grumbled.\u201cIt's okay\u2026\u201dElnore was about to say something but stopped. She only looked at me and kept her mouth shut.Her expression suggests that of sorrow.\u201c\u2026It might look bad, but this is normal.\u201dI smiled and tried to change the subject.Though not as severe as mine, Elnore also had injuries all over her body.She had broken ribs and arm, and terrible lacerations on her legs. She had torn her dress to use as a bandage in order to forcefully move.She looked like she could barely stand and it was a burden being upright, let alone fight.The only reason she's able to move was because of her superhuman mental strength, nothing more or less.But why was she worried about me?In her current state, how could she worry about other people?\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter looking at me without saying a word, she took off the necklace she had been wearing and threw it at me.As I caught it with my right arm, a new window popped up in front of me.[ The 'Necklace of Vitality' has been equipped. ][ Durability and stamina are slightly increased. ]\u201cIt will help you keep your body together. It'll allow you to move.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that we had to bring him to the academy? Marquis Riverback also keeps saying that he would use me in his \u2018plan\u2019. I don't think he'll kill me right away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMove to the target location first. It's not too far away, I will buy you some time.\u201d\u201c\u2026Elnore.\u201d\u201cI trust you until the end.\u201dAt a loss for words, I could only stare at Elnore, who simply smiled back.It was the same shy smile when we held hands at the start of the Full Moon Festival.\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t it just right to give back what we received?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI've never done anything to deserve such gratitude from this person.I was just struggling to get through the situation.But this person.\u301aIs the strategy meeting over?\u301bMarquis Riverback said with folded arms, as he was smirking at us.His attitude was that of, 'do whatever you want, I've already won.'It was a self-centered and vain attitude, but it wasn't the wrong move this time, as Elnore and I were already as good as incapacitated.However, Elnore cared for none of that and confronted Marquis Riverback without fear.\u201cLet me ask you one thing, Marquis Riverback.\u201d\u301aWhat is it?\u301b\u201cHow much do we look like as a couple?\u201d\u301a...Yes?\u301b\u201cThis is an important question, so answer it honestly.\u201dMarquis Riverback looked at Elnore speechless, then he burst into a laughter.\u301aIYou're a match made in heaven. If you somehow survive here, why don't you start a family?\u301b\u201cIt's a good answer. I can spare you a little mercy.\u201dElnore smiled and raised her sword, while demonic energy also surged from Marquis Riverback.\u201cDowd, go!\u201dI don't have a say here.I would just be a burden if I continued to stay here.I finally turned away from Elnore and walked towards the academy building.\u201c\u2026Huk, heok\u2026\u201dI was already in a state of exhaustion, then adding the unimaginable injuries made even breathing itself harder.Every step I took felt like I was being stabbed by a hot iron rod. My body writhed with pain, and my vision was flickering. However, despite my literacy giving up and collapsing to the ground, I gritted my teeth and pushed forward.Because I know that there's someone enduring more pain than I am right now.At this point, I was crawling but persisted moving forward. Oh how I badly wanted to rest, even for a little bit, but I feel like once I do that, I'll never be able to never get back up.After a few minutes of crawling, I saw it.The outer wall of the academy.\u201c\u2026\u201dI'm finally here.Propping myself up using the wall, I struggled my way to the gates.Due to the chaos that had ensued in the city, there was not a single guard in sight. So I have no help to even count on.-!!A person suddenly crashed on the wall beside me.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was Elnore.The level of injuries she sustained couldn't even be limited to she looked 'wrecked'.If it wasn\u2019t for the tattered dress, I wouldn\u2019t be even able to recognize her in such a ghastly state.\u301aShe was really like a pest, annoying. I already broke all her limbs, but she would still crawl and grab on my legs. It\u2019s terrible, really.\u301b\u201c\u2026\u201d\u301aSo, what are your plans now? Do you have anything more hidden?\u301bUnable to control my body anymore, I limply knelt in front of Marquis Riverback.I could still see that laughing smirk on his face.Then I turned my gaze towards Elnore.Elnore had faint shallow breaths, but she still met my eyes with difficulty.She was giving me an apologetic gaze.\u2018\u2026No.\u2019You did a good job.Otherwise, I couldn't have come this far.\u301aAnything else?\u301b\u201c\u2026\u201d\u301aThis is boring.\u301bHaving said that, Marquis Riverback reached out.Demonic energy started gathering.\u201c\u2026!\u201dElnore, who was stuck on the wall, tried wriggling her body to move.

If even one of you wasn't, such an achievement might not have been possible.\u201dIt really was.No, to be exact, if even one human here was missing, this achievement would have been impossible\u201c\u2026It would have been impossible if even one is missing.\u201dConrad\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cYes, I share the same sentiment. Do you know why me and the President happened to be around here?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cShe recommended that we eat here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElijah frowned.\u201cis that so?\u201d\u201cShe already booked the seats, so I have no reason to refuse. But then, coincidentally, this happened.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA hypothesis started forming in Elijah\u2019s head.And as Conrad continued, the more it became concrete.\u201cAnd that guy over there, he's a student from the Monster Research Department.\u201dConrad pointed to Evan Kramer, a sophomore in the Monster Research Department.Elijah remembers this face well.Because he was the facilitator of the mock battle at the orientation that she did with Dowd.Dowd had told Tallion to find this student as well.\u201cWe probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to achieve this result without him.\u201dDefinitely.Apart from their brutish fighting ability, monsters also have a variety of strange and bizarre traits. Even for a knight whose main profession was fighting against them, it's impossible to memorize all of their characteristics.Unless one is geek who specialize in studying such things...If that student named Evan hadn't provided them the Man Eaters' weaknesses, they wouldn't have been able to end the battle so smoothly.\u201cI heard that he was asked to come to the festival. He couldn\u2019t refuse because it was from a benefactor\u2019s request.\u201d\u201cA benefactor?\u201d\u201cThe Monster Research Department is the least popular department among the Knights School. We were considering closing it by the end of this year.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut when I \u2018coincidentally\u2019 checked the mock battle stage, I found capable people. So I revoked that decision.\u201dElijah\u2019s pupils trembled slightly.Right, we're saying it was a coincidence.But it happened because of \u2018a certain person\u2019 Conrad was eyeing.And coincidentally, the student from the rarely-visited Monster Research Department happened to be nearby.At a terrifyingly perfect timing.Because of someone's request.\"...\"Then it became clear.The students affiliated with the \"House of Purification\" foundation, who participated in this battle, were also said to have not mutated into monsters because Dowd had done something.The knights who were dispatched to this scene were also people that Dowd had called upon beforehand, after requesting it from the President.\u201c\u2026Ha.\u201dWhen viewed separately, it's a series of completely unrelated coincidences, but there is one focal point that connects all of these coincidences.\u201cUh, Dean.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cHas that person been preparing for this a long time ago?\u201dConrad laughed instead of answering.All the actions taken up until now, the people that Dowd has met, and the resulting outcomes - all point to this situation.Dowd Campbell has been designing a response to an unnoticed threat since the beginning.Everyone set in their positions.From the beginning, that person had expected that something like this would happen and prepared for it meticulously\u2018It's impossible if even one person is missing.\u2019It\u2019s a tightly knit plan from the beginning to end!Elijah said disheartened.\u201c\u2026What kind of person is he, really?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. In the first place, it could really be just a series of coincidences.\u201dConrad replied while scratching his head.\u201cBut if that's really the case, then I feel like there shouldn't have been one more thing.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHave you seen Tallion during the battle?\u201dThat's true.If he was there, he would have undoubtedly been a great asset, but his absence was puzzling.\u201cWhat do you think he is doing right now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElijah\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cYou think he's planning more?\u201dA boisterous laughter was what she got instead of an answer.It had a carefree tone that didn't require any further questioning as to what it meant.\u201cSeriously.\u201dWhat kind of person is he?Elijah sighed and tilted his head back to relieve the fatigue from the battle.\u201cEung?\u201dSuddenly, her entire field of vision was covered in \u2018gray\u2019.Like a smoke that spewed out from somewhere, it rapidly expanded. It endlessly covered the sky, space, and eroded everything in its path.And then.Everything stopped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No, the laws of physics for that matter.Pure white hair flowing down to one's ankles, crimson eyes that's redder than blood, flawless white skin without any blemish, and an immaculate body uncovered by a single thread.This figure, this woman, looks familiar.If given a few years to mature, Elnore would look just like this person.But this was not Elnore. You can tell just by looking.Because if it were Elnore, or simply any human...They wouldn't exude such a level of \"evil.\"\u2018The Gray Devil.\u2019In the game, it never really revealed its true form directly. It only appeared as a form of boss battle by possessing Elnore at the climax.So, the figure before me right now is basically an \"avatar.\"The Devil's Essence that Marquis Riverback infused with his body just contained a small piece of the devil\u2019s power. When all the fragments are pieced together, the real devil can be summoned.The Gray Devil fragments scattered throughout the scenario pool together in various events within the game, ultimately converging in Elnore. It is inevitable.In other words, the avatar in front of me right now is only a small part of it.The 'authority' it possess is insignificant compared to the Gray Devil's true form, and the duration it can materialize is only short-lived, at most a few tens of seconds.But even so.[ A moment of danger has been detected. ][ Determined the situation as life-threatening. ][ Skill: Desperation raised to EX Class. ]Just by having this avatar front of me, the deactivated Desperation turned on again.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was ridiculous, fck.'Her' presence alone brought the entire world to a standstill.

It's probably because he still couldn\u2019t catch me, much less maul me.Fortunately, this guy is finally enraged for real now, not like before.He's been like that ever since he noticed that his Purification Skill was erased by the effect of my King of Pandemonium.\u2018Well, this is it.\u2019Let's try changing perspectives for a moment.Considering the background of this guy, he's a shady merchant who started from the bottom and happened to get involved with the devil worshippers. After going through a teeth-gritting process, he finally gained recognition.Given the circumstances, there's a high chance he views the Devil's Essence, bestowed upon him by the Prophet, as the culmination of all his efforts so far. Thanks to that, he revels in that power and bask in a feeling of omnipotence.Even Elnore and I, who shattered the tower he had built over the years with ease, got defeated using his newfound ability without even exerting much effort.But then...The guy he thought he had killed suddenly resurrected, and in the blink of an eye, he's using a skill that surpasses his own.His several years\u2019 worth of achievements was once again reduced into nothing.\u201c\u2026\u201dThinking this way, it's understandable that he would feel unjust.Imagine having all the achievements you've built over a lifetime completely stripped away by the same person in less than a day.If it were to happen to me, I would also be furious.Well, considering they are villains, it doesn't really justify nor matter if they feel that way.If anything...\u201cIs this ability good? I can't tell.\u201dI can use this to easily provoke his temper.Even while running away, I was smiling and threw such a sentence at Marquis Riverback.\u301a\u2026\u301b\u201cHmm, I'm not sure if this ability is anything good, really. I just happen to get it. I briefly crossed paths with someone, and they told me to take it. But after using it, it feels a bit cheesy.\u201d\u301a...You, you...\u301b\u201cWait, Marquis Riverback, is the ability you worked your ass off for years to obtain worse than this? Surely that can't be\u2026\u201d\u301aShut up!\u301bHmm, that's right.Indeed, there's nothing quite as effective in provocation as using polite language.I continue to taunt and run while chuckling at the chasing, fuming Marquis Riverback.With his vanity and conceited character, it's close to impossible for him to maintain a rational judgment when provoked.Even though he could effectively pressure me by exploiting the difference in our stats, he is only chasing after me and launching attacks impulsively like some child throwing a fit.With this, I could manage to get away just by using the un-nerfed Desperation.Of course, I was not just running away blindly without reason.\u2018Not much time left.\u2019Checking my watch, the \u2018promise time\u2019 is due soon.In that case, I need to temporarily get rid of this guy.\u201c\u2026Eum.\u201dI confirm my current position and intentionally slowed down my fleeing speed.\u301aDie!\u301bNaturally, Marquis Riverback's attacks came at me like missiles.[ Soul Linker Activated. ][ Magic Power Received. ][ Skill \u2018Guardian Shield\u2019 has been used. ]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's basically impossible to endure such an attack.Still, since it\u2019s divine power, it was able to block it once. This was the inherent advantage against demons.It is also largely thanks to this why I was able to escape this far relatively easily.\u2018\u2026Come to think about it, it makes no sense.\u2019The 'King of Pandemonium\u2019 that could negate a demon's unique ability and having divine power-imbued skills...It\u2019s an incredibly powerful combination against demonic enemies.Even at this current stage, where my growth is practically non-existent, I can still make ample use of it.As the shield shattered, Marquis Riverback's magic scatters in the surroundings. Witnessing this, he snickered.\u301aHa! Big words for someone who only knows how to run and hide...\u301bHowever, he suddenly stopped mid sentence and shut up.It's because the magic that bounced off after breaking my shield destroyed part of the \u2018Cathedral\u2019 nearby.The holy relics were exposed.I purposely set up the shield angled, so that it would hit there.Fragments of stained glass rain down along with pieces of holy relics.Since this was a cathedral built inside Elfante \u2018Imperial Academy\u2019, it was naturally built using only the highest quality materials.The dispersal of holy power within would be akin to a grenade explosion, scattering its influence in the surroundings.Radiant white light began to flash in every direction, which is all divine power.\u201cTry taking a look at what\u2019s around you?\u201dI turned around with a grin.From behind, I hear Marquis Riverback's howl as his entire body burns brightly, fully exposed to the divine power.\u2018Good.\u2019This should stall that guy for a while.It should be enough time for me to go to the rendezvous point and collect the item.Tallion is sharp and reliable. If I specified the time accurately, he will undoubtedly perform the task accordingly.In fact, by the time I arrive at the rendezvous point, the alarm also started beeping...\u2018Alright.\u2019I then caught Tallion rushing towards me at full speed, holding the 'requested item,' in my field of vision.Seeing that, I smiled and reset my watch.Everything is in place.All that's left is to wrap things up.\u25cfMarquis River back's head was boiling to the point where it couldn\u2019t get any hotter.\u201cI\u2019ll skin you alive, you fcking bastard brat, I\u2019ll chew your guts in front of you!\u201dHe's never felt such rage in his entire life. It felt like his blood vessels were about to burst.In all his years, he's never encountered someone who humiliated and insulted him to this extent!Wiping off the lingering burn from the contact with divine power just now, he scanned his surroundings with gleaming eyes.During the brief moment he lost focus from being struck, that damned Dowd had already vanished somewhere.Of course, this wasn't an obstacle at all as he had consumed the Devil's Essence.It wouldn't be a difficult task to track down the opponent's whereabouts, it doesn't matter where they are hiding.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe began to trace the faint lingering scent of human presence, which mingled with the swirling smoke.Coincidentally, there were no other humans around. Following those traces was even easier.And before long, Marquis Riverback, having found the location, let out a snicker.\u2018Gregory Hall?\u2019The spire. It is one of the tallest buildings in Elfante.As he ran with his tail, Marquis Riverback wondered where he was possibly going. Turns out, it's here, of all places.Due to the nature of tall buildings, this is a dead-end with no place to escape or hide. And to make matters worse, the man was currently at the very top of this place.\u301aIdotic fool!\u301bIf it were the usual Marquis Riverback, he might have at least pondered why this man went to such a place.However, anger had consumed his entire mind, deteriorating his judgment.In that sense, he immediately started flying towards Gregory Hall without any hesitation.\u301aHeup!\u301bWith his body accelerating in an instant, he reached the top of Gregory Hall in no time. He ferociously scanned the surroundings immediately.It didn't take long for him to find Dowd Campbell, who had boldly revealed himself in the open.There was something on Dowd's waist that he didn't see before.\u2018\u2026What is that?\u2019It was a cylinder the length of a human arm. It was something golden but showed no apparent features.It was suspicious, that much was certain.\u301a\u2026\u301bHowever, Marquis Riverback decided not to pay it any heed.Even though Dowd has been resurrected from the dead and received an unknown power, he was still a bug that he could chase and eventually crush. At best, it would just be some crude trick.He'll finish this now, once and for all.\u301aI'll make you feel pain, I'll make you experience hell! I will make you beg to kill you instead!\u301bHe shouted and accelerated forward. Black haze spread around him, as he raised his speed to the limit.This slick rat was always running, and it infuriates him to the core. This time, he won't let that happen again.However, Dowd Campbell didn\u2019t even budge.He had defended the attack with the divine power shield a few times before, but he did not show any signs of running away now.\u301a\u2026?\u301bAt this point, despite being consumed by anger, Marquis Riverback felt that something was off.What the hell is he doing?\u2018\u2026If I kill him here, it will be over!\u2019He had repeatedly drawn magic from the amulet he wore on his wrist, before injecting it to the incense burner in his arms.However, looking at the amulet now, it seems to have been exhausted all of its magic power. The last time was probably its limit.Now, this guy doesn't even have the means to defend himself!With that thought in mind, he raised his hand with a vicious smile and started gathering demonic energy. The distance between them was close. He had no defense, and considering the difference in strength, dodging is even more impossible.He couldn't stop his relishing expression from coming out as he imagined this guy being torn to pieces.\u201cI've told you before. Try taking a look at what\u2019s around you.\u201dHowever, at the same time as those sentences were uttered.Marquis Riverback\u2019s body suddenly froze.No, he was \u2018fixed on to\u2019 to be exact.On a disk lying on the floor.\u2018\u2026A disk?\u2019Why would this kind of thing be here? He blinked his eyes in bewilderment.With a squeaking sound, the cylinder connected to the disk and dug to the floor.\u201cEum.\u201dDowd said with a smirk.He was also on top of the disk.\u201cGood thing I didn't return it.\u201dWith such a sentence.The bodies of the two men were launched into the air with terrifying force.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Much less, if it would even work.\u201cWell, of course, I have my reasons.\u201dHowever, Dowd simply shrugged and replied.He seemed to be hiding something even here, but Marquis Riverback snorted and raised his hand.This was merely prolonging his puny life for a few more seconds.\u301aHah, I guess you're just at this level. Alright, go die\u2026!\u301bHe's finally going to kill him.At least, that's what would have happened if the black mist emanating from the essence embedded in his chest didn't suddenly disappear.No, it didn't just stop there.His entire body began to \"melt away.\"His skin, form was just collapsing, like a wax figure melting close to fire.\u301aWhat...!\u301bMarquis Riverback looked down at his body with a bewildered expression.\u301aWhat is this\u2026!\u301bHis body has fused with the essence he received from the Prophet. He had an invincible body that even this cunning guy couldn\u2019t do anything about.So, why is this happening?\u201cLet's think logically, shall we? Some common sense.\u201dSeeing Marquis Riverback's reaction, Dowd smirked and said.He did so while casually turning off the beeping alarm on his wristwatch.It's almost as if the alarm had been set, knowing that this would happen exactly at this moment.\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange that you, who didn\u2019t even have a decent fighting ability, can continue to use such strong abilities without restrictions?\u201d\u301aWhat...?\u301b\u201cThat\u2019s one of the representative side effects of fusing with the Devil's Essence. Burnout. Using too much magic to the point where your body collapses. Didn't your Prophet explain that when they gave it to you?\u201d\u301a\u2026What, nonsense, I don't believe, no-\u301bIn fact, he had not heard of such side effects.This was meant to be a \u2018sign of loyalty\u2019.\u201cIt would have been really dangerous if you weren't so conceited and didn't take your time after you ate the essence. I don't have that many cards.\u201dSaying so, Dowd pulled out the cylinder on his waist.Just a few minutes ago, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to relax like this. In front of the transformed Marquis Riverback, all I could do was run away with all my might.But now.I could even sit back and watch as Marquis Riverback's body collapse in real time.It's just that I won't be doing that. I will be making sure he's thoroughly defeated.Dowd silently smirked and manipulated the cylinder case.It contained processed Ectoplasm, primed for explosion, imbued with divine power.\u301a\u2026\u301bSeeing this, Marquis Riverback had a hunch.He realized that he would never survive in this position.\u201cYou had plenty of options. You could have joined forces with the Man Eaters and broke through the barrier, or you could have charged at me from the start with the intention to 'kill' rather than just 'defeating' Elnore. Honestly, you had the opportunity but you didn't take it, did you?\u201dThat's right.If he had attacked seriously from the start, he would have been able to kill either this man or Princess Tristan.\u2018If I had tried to kill him thoroughly from the beginning\u2026!\u2019He gritted his teeth thinking of this.\u201cI expected that you would do that, so I planned accordingly... It's not bad.\u201d\u301aNot bad, you say?\u301b\u201cI only died once.\u201dDowd said with a still calm expression.\u301a...What?\u301b\u201cIf I did it wrong, I could have died two or three times, but because you were so cooperative, it ended with just one. Well, you did a good job.\u201d\u301a\u2026\u301bDowd's tone remained composed.Even if he succeeded in killing this man two or three times.It seemed as though the end result was already predetermined.\u2018This bas\u2020ard\u2026!\u2019Suddenly, cold sweat ran down Marquis Riverback\u2019s spine.Thinking about it, this was a familiar feeling.Throughout the day, facing this man, he felt something was off.It seemed as though everything about him was being seen through. He even knew things that Marquis Riverback himself didn't knew. Dowd had complete control over all possible variables.\u301aYou, right from the beginning, everything was just to buy time\u2026!\u301bHis appearance with Princess Tristan, just the two of them alone. His every action was deliberately aimed at provoking him.Even.Making Marquis Riverback believe that he \u201cdied.\u201dIt was all an act with everything calculated from the beginning.Dowd knew from the start that he would become incapacitated like this after a while.From the beginning, everything Dowd did was not to defeat him, but to drag out time.The moment Marquis Riverback failed to notice that, he had already lost!\u301aThis, this...!\u301bHe...Once again...To this guy, from the beginning to the end...He was dancing on this man's palm!\u301aI'll chew your bones up you bas\u2020aaaaaaaaard-! \u301bDowd chuckled and held the bomb in front of his body.I didn\u2019t ask Percy to make it resembling a \u2018cannon\u2019 for nothing. I don't want to get caught up after triggering at close range.Although divine power cannot cause great damage to humans, it is a weapon made with the premise of detonating the \u2018whole academy\u2019. Safety rules must be followed.\u201cHey.\u201dThen, with that.\u201cDo you have any last words?\u201dThe divine powered bomb exploded.\u25cf\u201cYou did excellent, Tallion.\u201d\u201c\u2026don't mention it.\u201dTallion, who had been waiting at the prearranged \"landing point,\" looked up at the sky with an awkward smile.Due to the effect of the divine powered bomb I just detonated, a terrifying light was scattered around, reminiscent of a polar light phenomenon.\u2018As expected, it got incredible firepower.\u2019I smiled while looking at it too.The Devil\u2019s Essence itself is such a dangerous item that if it's not dealt with using such intense firepower, it could cause a big problem.Even if Marquis Riverback's body collapses, the essence itself could survive and parasitize onto another nearby living being.While I didn't expect something like that to happen, it was wise to have prepared such an intense level of firepower from the beginning.\u201c\u2026\u201dTo think that a small fraction of one's power could bring forth such a thing, and the devil behind it was residing within Elnore's body, or even Elijah who would later grow powerful enough to take down such an existence.It once again makes me realize what level of monstrosity I'm dealing with.And I managed to survive that.Thinking about this, I turn around.\u201cUh, brother? Where are you going now\u2026!\u201d\u201cI need to go somewhere!\u201dSaying that, I hurriedly rush off.My destination was the wall outside the academy, where Elnore was stuck.\u2018\u2026I need to make it up to her.\u2019I did give her the most basic first aid to prevent any serious problems, before I lured the Purifier away. However, for my sake, she was the one who had it the most difficult and worked the hardest.At the very least, I should personally escort her to the infirmary.While running with that thought in mind, several messages appeared in front of me one after another.<System Message>[ Main Quest Completed! ][ Granting Rewards! ][ Received \u2018Evil Essence 1x\u2019! ][ Received \u2018Hero Fragment 1x\u2019! ][ Received 5,000pts! ]As those messages floated up, two gems appeared in my hand with a halo of light.One emitted a pure white radiance, while the other exuded ominous black smoke.[ Evil Essence ][ Item: Story ][ A material that can interact with epic items.

And yet, it's already appeared now?On top of that, the probability of me getting involved with the Heretic Inquisition, which is one of the two top notorious organizations in the Empire, increased?\u201c\u2026\u201dWhen necessary, I even briefly delved into the underworld, but even then, I would prefer to avoid the Heretic Inquisition.They are the last thing I want to get entangled with among the \"villains\" in the game.\u2018Dragon Fang, Feinol.\u2019A Half Dragon Mage with exceptional magical abilities but an inversely proportional extreme temperament, and a key character in Chapter 4.In terms of simple risk, many would even say that this person was worse than the final boss of Chapter 4, \u2018The Investigator.\u2019What would happen if I met this person and my Fatal Charm passive triggers?\u201c\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t even want to imagine.\u2018But this\u2026\u2019I just fed the amulet the Hero Fragment, and this all came with it.Which means these events are related to the awakening of the spirit inside.\u2018Could it be that what's inside this amulet is possibly larger than I thought?\u2019As I pondered such thoughts while looking at the amulet, the outer walls of the Academy soon came into view within my sight.I could see where Elnore was stuck.\u201cOh, Dowd. You're here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, there was no sign of Elnore.Rather, I was greeted by a waving President Atallante.When did she get here?\u201cI've personally escorted the Student Council President to the ward, then came back. She's badly injured, but she will recover soon. She won't experience any lasting effects thanks to your first aid.\u201dAtallante rapid fire said to me those words one after another, as she walked towards me with a smile on her face.Her lips were arched into a smile.\u201c\u2026Are you angry?\u201dYup, she's really mad.Her eyes aren\u2019t smiling at all.I could feel cold sweat run down my back.\u201cOh, is it obvious?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe's not even trying to deny it.If I don\u2019t want to die here, I need to carefully listen as to what she has to say.\u201c\u2026It looks like you've been through quite a trouble.\u201dAtallante said as she sized me up and down.\u201cShall we move to a more comfortable place to talk?\u201dWell.It's clear that I didn't have the choice to refuse.\u25cf\u201c\u2026Is it okay for you to be here?\u201dAs I sat in Atallante's office and saw the tea being offered in front of me, I decided to start with that question.After all, a human had consumed the Devil's Essence and wrecked havoc both inside and outside the academy.Perhaps, since I took care of Marquis Riverback, the Man Eaters in the city were also dealt with.However, quite a few things must have been destroyed during the previous chase. Not to mention that a while ago, there was a huge explosion of divine power in the sky above the academy.It\u2019s clear that chaos still lingers everywhere.\u201cIt's fine. I am not needed there. In the first place, the students were active and managed to block everything without any casualties.\u201dBut Atallante simply smiled casually and said so.\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cElfante is old, Dowd Campbell.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cIt's a place that has been operating for nearly a thousand years, right next to the location where the devils are sealed, and dealing with all sorts of powerful nobles and egotistical privileged classes. Do you think there's anything worse than that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou think we can't handle this degree?\u201dElfante. It seems to be a crazier place than I originally thought.So this level of incident isn't even at the realm of 'serious'.\u201cAbove all, this much is within the expected range.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dAtallante looked at me and smiled again.As I stared blankly for a while, I suddenly realized the underlying meaning of her words. I got goosebumps.\u2018\u2026Does she mean that she could've just resolved all this if she wanted to?\u2019That\u2019s right.There are very few beings who can hold a candle near her, even when looking at the continent as a whole.In the story, she was always portrayed as a top-tier powerhouse.\u201cI let this time go. Since, it looked like student has planned and prepared everything from beginning to end. I just decided to go along with it.\u201dAfter saying so, Atallante rested her chin on the desk and said.\u201cThis makes me angry, student.\u201dAtallante sighed, then she looked at me.\u201cYou've got involved with the devil, didn't you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI already know. I just want to hear it from your mouth. I will not accept any excuses.\u201dAtallante continued with a sharp gaze.\u201cOne of the Gray Devil's abilities, 'Erosion,' occurred extensively around the student\u2019s location. The Heretic Inquisition will not overlook this, and even the Holy Kingdom, which oversees the heresy trials, will show interest.\u201dShe followed with a sigh.\u201cAnd I'm the only one who knows this. At the time of the erosion, you and the Student Council President were the only ones present in the area.\u201dCold sweat began to trickle down my back.I am involved.Very deeply.I was confessed to and treated by the absolutely powerful devil.\u201cDo you understand the situation you are in right now?\u201dHaving said that, Atallante closed her eyes with a sigh.However, despite saying she's \"angry,\" when she opened her eyes again, her gaze was full of worry.\u201cBased on your track record so far, I presume you already know what you're dealing with. Isn't that right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut why didn't you actively seek help? Am I not trustworthy?\u201d\u201cWell, didn\u2019t I succeed this time even without the President's help?\u201d\u201cThen what about next time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI couldn't open my mouth at Atallante\u2019s sharp response.\u201cYou are already at the center of all the commotion, Dowd Campbell. You have become the eye of the storm.\u201dAtallante said in a stern voice.\u201cDevil worshipers are persistent. Once they discover that you and the Student Council President have something to do with the devil, they\u2019ll follow you to the depths of hell. The current chaos is likely just the beginning.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThat's right.It's an undeniable fact that I'm deeply involved in the main scenario.With Elijah and Elnore by my side, it\u2019s practically definitive.At this point, I had long given up on living as an extra.I replied with a sigh.\u201c\u2026No matter what happens next, it\u2019s hard to expect much direct help from the President.\u201dThis was indeed the case.Atallante was an Eternal, a monster capable of handling the majority of situations alone. However, only a very small number of individuals, 'designated for such purpose,' can directly confront devils and those associated with them.Elijah and the Hero Party fall into that category, and there are a few others as well... But at the very least, Atallante is not one of them.It's systematically predetermined. Regardless of your identity in this world, you can't go against it no matter what you do.\u201cThen, do you intend to handle whatever happens next alone again?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019d love to receive some support.\u201dThe process is going to be fcking difficult, painful and arduous.However, there's nothing I could do. My fate has already been sealed.I just had to do my best to survive.Atallante pursed her lips at my answer.And then...\u201cPahaha-!\u201dShe burst into cheerful laughter that echoed throughout the office.\u2018\u2026Why is she suddenly like this?\u2019It is such a sudden drastic emotional change and caught me off guard.\u201c\u2026Looking at it from a President's perspective, I can't help but be ashamed of putting such a heavy burden on a student.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe plan itself had been completed long ago. However, I couldn't just bring myself to impose such a heavy load on a student. I was delaying it till the final confirmation.\u201d\u201c\u2026So, what exactly.\u201d\u201cI didn't intervene in your activities to assess your capabilities. If you fell short even slightly, I was prepared to give up immediately... But you have proven yourself flawlessly. Yes.\u201dShe started saying mysterious words, which made my eyes roll.What?Uh.What is going on really?\u201cAnd I have also witnessed your determination to overcome any obstacles that come your way. Thus, I am now confident that I can reveal it.\u201dHaving said that, Atalanta sighed and straightened her back.Dignity dwells in the eyes. It was the look in the eyes that felt the dignified presence of a perpetuator that had passed through it for over a thousand years.\u201cDowd Campbell.\u201dThe solemn voice made me stand upright.what the heck What are you talking about?\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed beforehand that the academy is plotting something around you.\u201d\u201cYe, yeah.\u201dThat's right.Is she going to talk about that now?\u201cWhat I'm about to tell you is a secret that no one else should know about. The only involved parties are the imperial family, the War Chiefs and Warrior Chiefs of the Tribal Union, and the Pope and Archbishops of the Holy Kingdom. Only a very select few know the whole story.\u201d\u201cUh, what, yes?\u201d\u201cAfter all, this matter concerns the survival of the world.\u201dUh, uh?It's that serious?What on earth\u2026!\u201cFirst, let me tell you about the ultimate goal of the plan.\u201dAtallante continued in her solemn voice.\u201cThe fate of the entire continent is at stake.\u201dHer eyes carried an overwhelming charisma, even commanding the air around her.A plan with the \"ultimate goal\" that determines the fate of the continent, spoken by an immortal being that has lived through over a thousand years.\u201cI want you to have several wives.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI tried cleaning my ears.Maybe I head it wrong.I coughed in confusion.Then after a few blank blinks, I finally gave a response to Atallante.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNo, yes?\u201d\u201cWhat are you curious about?\u201dAtallante's confident questioning gave me a splitting headache.Ugh.No, what the heII is going on?\u201cWas the sentence not understandable? I mean, um. Harem, you know? Harem. Polygamy. I want you to do that\u2026\u201d\u201cHold on. Wait just a moment.\u201dI weakly grabbed my head and stopped Atallante on her tracks.\u201cLet me get this straight.\u201dYa. No.But no matter how you look at it.\u201cThere is a plan that only a minuscule fraction of the most influential and powerful individuals on the continent knows about, and it's so important that it determines the world's survival, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd the ultimate goal of that plan is for me to have a harem?\u201d\u201cTo be precise, you must seduce a few people.\u201dAtallante shrugged and said.\u201cThe Student Council President, whom you'd risk your life, is among those people. This is also the most important part.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAll the necessary means to accomplish that will be supported by the continent's nations, be it overtly or covertly.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI could barely catch my breath.\u201cSo, in other words.\u201dWith a constricted feeling, I somehow managed to say the last sentence.Without any understanding of the reasons or the omitted middle processes, if I were to summarize what this person has been saying so far...The conclusion.\u201cIf I don\u2019t have a harem, the world will end?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThis is insane.I couldn't come up with any other reaction.\u201c\u2026Why, could you please explain the reason?\u201dIn sharp contrast to my dying voice, Atallante bursts into laughter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fated to Be Loved by VillainsCH 32.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEP - 032.1 - Please\u201cActually, the remnants of the devil are not that rare.\u201dAtallante continued.\u201cWhile the revival of the devil's true form ceased with the last exploits of the Hero who wielded the Holy Sword, its remnants are still scattered throughout the world.\u201dAfter the devil was ripped apart, its fragments were scattered throughout the world.Most of them exist in the form of wills and tend to cling to objects or places, but the most dangerous type were those that use humans as 'vessels'.Once all the 'conditions' are met, the Fragment would manifest through that vessel.Just like the Gray Devil fragment manifesting in Elnore before.\u2018The problem is\u2026\u2019Once a devil fragment manifests through a vessel, the other fragments would gather around that person, driven by an almost unavoidable inevitability.That's why vessels are the most important, and at the same time, dangerous entities. They essentially serve as agents for the resurrection of the devil.\u201c\u2026\u201dI let out bitter laugh inside.In the same vein, Elnore, who has manifested the devil once, will likely undergo significant changes.It is highly probable that a part of her 'emotions' will be greatly amplified.It\u2019s my job to lead her to the best possible outcome.\u201cIf those devil fragments manifest in the material world, it would cause a catastrophic disaster.\u201dYes. I know.There's something similar that had happened before.The Crimson Night incident. A disaster that occurred when a human possessing several fragments of the \u2018Red Devil\u2019 manifested them all at once.It was also this incident that swept away the family of the current hero candidate, Elijah.\u201c\u2026\u201dOne of the powers of the Red Devil is \u2018Hellfire\u2019, the ability to control near-infinite flames.Of course, regardless of the number of fragments, it's impossible to completely recreate it.But, nevertheless.When I saw it in the game's CG, it didn\u2019t really touch me. But if it was an accident that happened in real life, the horror of it would be unimaginable.One human.Erased several cities entirely from the map.In just one night.\u201cThat\u2019s why when I noticed the erosion happening, the power of the Gray Devil, I came here at full speed. Since it extensively occurred through Princess Tristan, we need to subdue it as soon as possible to reduce the damage.\u201dAt that time, it could be said that Atallante was desperate.This was a fragment of the \u2018Gray Devil\u2019, the strongest being among the rulers of Pandemonium.A power that can kill even a thousand-year-old Eternal.No, more than that.\u201c\u2026Were you aware that Elnore was a vessel of the Gray Devil?\u201d\u201cI had my suspicions. But with the evidence this time, I'm now certain.\u201dAtallante received my words with a smile.\u201cThe people that the Holy Land and Heresy Inquisition within the empire will dispatch are very competent in that regard. Even if they can\u2019t pinpoint who exactly the \u2018vessel\u2019 containing the Devil Fragment is, they can come up with a group of candidates.\u201dThis sentence was followed by a sigh.This was great.Because the Devil Fragments seek hosts on their own.They attach themselves and lie dormant, remaining undetected for a long time. Once they eventually manifest in the material realm, they would inflict the most devastating damage.Thanks to this, I remember that even in the game, the presence of the fragments and who they attached to were completely random.In other words, they have the ability to gather information detailed enough on candidates to create a list. Of which, it includes the things I am unaware of.It would be a big help.\u201cThanks to their dormant nature, all the \u2018vessels\u2019 that hold the fragments are only triggered when they're carelessly touched.\u201dWhether it\u2019s social status or personal strength, the majority of vessels are individuals who have achieved great accomplishments.These individuals are often intricately entwined with political affairs in their respective countries, making it difficult to casually interfere with them. Moreover, if by any chance they are mishandled and the fragment manifests, it can result in a catastrophe.That's why the basic approach towards the vessel candidates is observation, laissez-faire, and light management.\u201cYes. But this time, somehow the conditions were right and we've gathered all the leading candidates to this academy.\u201dThat\u2019s great too.If an individual is a potential vessel, even a single mistake in handling them could pose significant repercussions.\u201cIt was the right target and timing. Luck followed. Fortune favored us. Among them, your existence itself is the luckiest.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cThe fragment that manifested in Princess Tristan \u2018helped\u2019 you. It used all its time to do so.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYeah, well.She seems aware that the manifested Gray Devil assisted me.But considering the circumstances, it\u2019s rather strange if she didn\u2019t know.\u201cIt is a strange thing. There\u2019s no way that it didn\u2019t know that exposing itself was the same as revealing its weakness.\u201dThere's naturally a reason for that.It\u2019s because of my special gift, \u2018Fatal Charm\u2019, which attracts inherent evil.Other than that, there doesn't seem to be any particular reason.\u201cThis part is key.\u201dAtallante continued, still smiling.\u201cThe devil is unusually benevolent towards you, Dowd Campbell.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dHer words didn't stop there.\u201cI have a hypothesis.\u201dWithout noticing it, my brows furrowed on their own.\u201cIn my near thousand years of experience, the amount of times I've witnessed this rare phenomenon can be counted with one hand.\u201dAtallante stated with confidence.The cause is uncertain, but there have been a few individuals throughout history who have caused such a phenomena.\u201cHuman beings who exhibit an obsessive allure that even beings, whose purpose is to bring absolute destruction to the material realm, would willingly sacrifice themselves. There have been individuals with such spiritual qualities.\u201dShe went on to say.\u201cA chosen born with a destiny to be loved by all evil. Yes, from what I've seen, you are such a person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWere my abilities really at that level?-That\u2019s a more powerful gift than you think. But how you handle it is up to you.The Angels have told me that before.At this point, I began to understand what Atallante meant about the \u2018survival of the world\u2019.If everything she's saying is true...I, with my mere existence alone, could exert influence over all those who constitute the axis of evil in this world.\u201cPersonally, this is the first time I\u2019ve encountered someone who was born with such a nature, so I\u2019d like to research it somehow and find out the principles behind it. However, there are more pressing matters at hand.\u201dAtallante swept her face with a sigh.It didn't seem like she's bringing up a pleasant story.\u201cA person with such inherent qualities is destined to attract devils. No matter what kind of life you lead, you will inevitably become entangled with devil vessels. There has not been a single exception to this.\u201d\u201c\u2026So you're saying.\u201d\u201cYes. It means that you, too, will inevitably become entangled with this generation's devil vessels.\u201dThe following story that unfolded also followed that context.\u201cOf course, most people like you did not have a good end. As you would expect.\u201dThe majority of vessels are not ordinary humans, and the devils themselves are catalysts for chaos, always carrying numerous tragedies and disasters in their wake.If all of them were to converge, it would be beyond what a single human could bear.\u201cBut.\u201dBut what, is there something else?After saying that, Atallante smiled.\u201cOnly once.\u201dThere has been a case where a vessel carrying a devil's fragment and a person with similar spiritual qualities as me met.True love blossomed and they survived to the end.It happened above all miraculous odds.\u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe fragment dwelling in the vessel completely vanished from the material realm.\u201dAs a result, without any \u2018medium\u2019 to manifest with, the devil was practically sealed.And since there's no vessel, the possibility of other fragments converging is also blocked.\u201cThe exact conditions are unknown. There are stories that you must love each other even in death, or that it only occurs when you truly, passionately love the other person. It\u2019s only happened once, so nothing specific is known. However, there is no dispute that a \u2018loving relationship\u2019 is the key.\u201dIt\u2019s a beautiful story.True love destroying the seeds of ruin.Yes.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut, for some reason, I kept feeling a chill down my spine.\u201cDo you know what, student?\u201dAtallante grinned.\u201cThe vessel candidates identified so far are, well.\u201dIt was a really unpleasant grin.\u201cThey coincidentally all women.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe chill felt cooler.Unless you\u2019re an idiot, you should be able to figure out where this is heading.\u201c\u2026So.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou want me to seduce all of them and eliminate the fragments?\u201dAtallante smiled softly.\u201cIt's an opportunity bestowed by the Heavens. Being someone with such a nature, what would capturing a couple of maidens' hearts be?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, it won't be easy. The devil worshippers aiming for the resurrection of the devil will continue to target you, and the vessels themselves are not ordinary individuals either. However...\u201dAtallante politely bowed her head.\u201cI humbly request student, Dowd Campbell.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe devil fragments are steadily converging through the vessels. As time goes by, more and more fragments will gather. At this rate, the destruction of mankind is inevitable. It'll only be a matter of time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease, I beg of yoh. I will do everything to help. Whatever this old fool can do, I will do it. So, I implore you.\u201dPlease save humanity.Those words faintly echoed in the office.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, Elnore was forced to visit this place not long ago due to Conrad's 'insistence'.\u201c\u2026\u201dThis was Elfante's infirmary. She's inside the campus, not in the outskirts where she fainted.Then.\u2018What about Dowd?\u2019What happened to him?This was the first thing that came to her mind and she hurriedly stood up.\u201c\u2026!\u201dBut it was a decision she immediately regretted.Her body was so battered that she couldn't even speak, much less bear a sudden movement.At the same time, she let out a silent scream from the ensuing agony\u2014\u201c\u2026Eum?\u201dElnore's eyes slightly widened as she looked down at her body.It didn't hurt as much.Of course, it was still painful. But compared to the injuries she sustained, this level of pain was a breeze.\u2018Has my recovery... become faster?\u2019As the daughter of a renowned swordsman, she had a certain level of physical prowess.However, even considering that, this recovery speed was abnormal.\u201c\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, the sinister aura that's always raging in her heart, feels much calmer than usual.Recalling her last bits of memory, it felt like something had devoured her entire body from within before she lost consciousness.\u2018Something has changed.\u2019As she looked down at her body, Elnore tilted her head.It felt as though the composition of her body had completely changed.As if the energy that had only been within her heart had affected her entire body.\u201cHwa, the patient has regained consciousness! Call the doctor!\u201dWhile she was lost in thoughts, one of the nurses suddenly exclaimed in surprise upon seeing her awake.It seemed that she\u2019s not the only one with the impression that there's no way she could've recovered so quickly.Also, as soon as the nurse said that, the door forcefully opened.Before she could even form the impression that the doctor had arrived, the curtain beside her bed was violently pulled back.\u201cHey, are you okay?!\u201dBeatrix, whose face was stained with urgency, vehemently bombarded her with questions.\u201cYou can remember, right? Can you move? How, how properly\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026Calm down.\u201dElnore sighed and calmed her down.\u201cI'm healthy. And I have my memories.\u201dBeatrix breathed a sigh of relief as she scrutinised Elnore up and down.Indeed, she looked perfectly fine. Both in terms of speech and appearance.\u201cReally? Are you sure?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201dAs soon as Elnore said that, Beatrix\u2019s palm exploded on her back.\u201c\u2026\u201dWith her civil background, Beatrix's smack didn't inflict much damage.Then with tears threatening to flow out, Beatrix continued.\u201cYou\u2019re worrying me, really! Ah! I really, ya, I really thought you were going to die this time\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026Was it that serious?\u201d\u201cAs soon as I saw you, I thought you were going straight to the morgue!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWell, she did probably looked like one hell of a mess.\u201cRather, what about Dowd Campbell? Where is he right now?\u201dHer main concern right now wasn't her condition, but this.As Elnore asked that with urgency, Beatrix looked at her incredulously.\u201cYou almost died, and you're worried about that? If he died, it'll a big disaster-\u201cBeatrix suddenly stopped talking.Because as soon as those words left her mouth, the radiance in Elnore's eyes vanished.A chilling sensation ran down Beatrix's spine in that instant, thinking that she might have misunderstood.\u201cNo! He's not dead! He's not dead, so calm down!\u201d\u201c\u2026How is he?\u201d\u201cHe's fine! He's in much better shape than you!\u201dSeeing the light return to Elnore's eyes upon hearing those words, Beatrix let out a sigh of relief.\u201c\u2026Anyway. It's a mess, a complete mess. The amount of trouble with very little time-\u201cBeatrix paused again.This time it was because Elnore's brow wrinkled when she heard those words.No, it wasn't that she was visibly upset by Beatrix's words.It was a different type of feeling that made her shut up.Elnore was contemplating her previous statement.\u201c\u2026Hey?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy are you suddenly quiet? It's scary.\u201d\u201cNo, someone said something like that before.\u201dElnore answered with narrowed eyes.\u201cTwo people saying something, wouldn\u2019t it just be a coincidence?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNo.Isn't that just a coincidence?Elnore is just interpreting it the way she likes.\u2018Isn\u2019t it strange?\u2019Like, it really is.She knew Elnore cared a lot about Dowd before, but it\u2019s a bit strange that this was what came to her mind as soon as she woke up.There were signs of it before, but this is... She doesn't know.\u2018\u2026It feels like her obsession is getting worse?\u2019Is there any reason? It's worrying.Beatrix thought so, but then she shook her head.Although it is concerning, there was something that needed to be conveyed immediately.\u201cUnnecessary thoughts aside, it's been hard these days.\u201d\u201cIt must have been tough while I was absent.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just tough, it was very difficult. People are barging in.\u201d\u201c\u2026 People are barging in?\u201dBeatrix sighed.\u201cTwo people. They say there will be two big names coming.\u201dElnore tilted her head.Beatrix is the secretary of the Student Council and is used to mingling with high status.Who could make her struggle so much?\u201cFirst is the Saintess. She will be coming next week. The Holy Land pushed the idea so strongly that the empire had no choice but to comply.\u201d\u201cDid you hear the reason?\u201d\u201cThere is something they must investigate. And the Saintess would probably lead it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe commotion between you and Dowd Campbell. It seems that the Heretic Inquisition is also keeping an eye on it. Everyone's in an uproar.\u201dSeeing Elnore's furrowed expression and silence, Beatrix let out a sigh.Indeed, it's not a trivial matter.The Holy Land's Saintess is a renowned figure known throughout the continent.As a representative of God, she may not possess substantial power like the Pope or the Archbishop, but in terms of symbolic significance, she is the most legitimate figure on the continent.I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone who would be happy to see someone like that come in saying \u2018there\u2019s something to investigate\u2019.That's why Beatrix hesitated before revealing the following news.\u201cAnd this is something I was planning to tell you later, but since we're on the subject, I'll let you know now.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYour father is coming to the academy. Sir Gideon.\u201dSparks flew from Elnore\u2019s eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a bizarre combination that would make a devout believer's eyes roll. But she didn\u2019t seem to care and even took out a new one.\u201cCould you please close the window?\u201d\u201cEung? Ah, was I interrupting?\u201dThe \u2018boy\u2019 who was sitting near the window turned his head towards her in response.It was a young man in his late teens, clad in full body armor.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was just watching the people This city is lively, it feels good.\u201d\u201cThe sound is fine, but the light is annoying.\u201d\u201cDo the modern-day Saintesses find the light bothersome?\u201d\u201cJust a personal habit. I've spent most of my life in a dark chapel.\u201d\u201cDon't suddenly delve into such dark topics. You're making me want to hit you.\u201d\u201c\u2026You are, in name, my escort knight. Please choose your words.\u201dIt was a very disrespectful tone for speaking to the continent's Saintess, but Lucien showed no particular reaction other than that.Because considering this man's personality, he would not do such a thing even if he died and came back to life.\u201cYou're not even afraid anymore. You were so nervous when we first met.\u201d\u201cI would rather believe that the Emperor is a saintly man than you hitting women, Varkasus.\u201dThe boy chuckled as he closed the window.\u201cI must say, we have become too close.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, a bit much for a devil worshiper and a Saintess, no?\u201dLucien raised her head and looked at the other person.\u201c\u2026\u201dAs soon as she did, she felt a suffocating pressure enveloping her entire body, causing her to grit her teeth.Since the window had just been closed, blocking the only light source, she couldn't make out the boy's expression as it's dark.However, his distorted 'form' was clearly evident.Incomprehensible, repulsive, disgusting, terrible.While it may be invisible in the light, but the moment darkness falls, the boy would reveal his \u2018true nature\u2019.An indescribably distorted, eon-old monster.Even she, who has one of the most sacred powers in the church, can barely maintain her composure when facing this grotesque existence, let alone subdue it.\u201c\u2026Don't worry.\u201dShe smiled wryly at the sight.\u201cYou guys might be better than the human holding my leash.\u201dIndeed, it was.Since receiving the 'shackles' of being a Saintess of the Holy Land, Lucien had never once regretted having ties with these humans.Compared to the demons disguised in human skin, the devil worshipers were far better.\u201cThank you for that.\u201dThe boy responded with a smirk, yawning as he spoke.\u201cBut in the end, you also have a purpose for cooperating with us, don't you? What was it again? You mentioned something about searching for someone?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLucien nodded slightly.\u201c\u2026someone precious to me is in Elfante.\u201dIn a voice full of determination, she continued.\u201cThere is something I must do.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Someone precious to you...\u201dThe boy nodded in response.A faint glimmer flickered within the darkness.\u201cI had those things once too.\u201dFollowed by the voice of someone buried in the depths of the memories of the past.Simultaneously, a rotten energy began to surge from the boy's body.Corruption overflowed.Lucien took a deep breath without realising it.Just by being near, it felt as though her body would break into pieces.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThere was a time like that. Like the humans outside the window right now; lively, laughing, chatting, and loving each other. The joys of ordinary people. The heart-full and positive days.\u201dA breath filled with the energy of the dead dispersed into the air.The miasma mixed in was dizzying.It was flowing out.The dead's mistakenly held obsession, the greed of the perished, oozed out like a sticky residue clinging to the floor, slowly creeping forth.And above it.A melancholic voice.\u201c\u2026then my kingdom, where the hell is it now?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, geuheuk\u2026!\u201d\u201cOh, this.\u201dThe boy smiled and said.The flowing energy suddenly disappeared. At the same time, Lucien fell on the floor while gasping for breath.She was sweating all over her body.\u2018I thought I was going to die\u2026!\u2019Despite being a Saintess, facing the opponent who only revealed a hint of their energy, put her in a life-threatening situation.This boy is a monster at that level of \u2018stature\u2019.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Are you okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026I'm fine, as you can see\u2026!\u201d\u201cWell, I sincerely apologize. I sometimes forget how fragile of a creature humans are. I tend to get worked up without realising it, when discussing serious matters.\u201d\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you the one who said something dark?\u201d\u201cUh, didn\u2019t I apologise already?\u201dScratching his head, the boy stood up and opened the window again.Then, as soon as the sun came in, his face regained its human form.As the boy wore a cheerful smile, complementing his sharp features, he immediately got hit by a remark.\u201cI just asked you to close it.\u201d\u201cYou're being loud. Why don't you take the opportunity to pray while basking in the sunlight? Considering your usual conduct, you should be more faithful to your role as a Saintess.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHell, I will even join you. I memorize prayers better than you, wouldn't you agree?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLucien's eyes narrowed after hearing a suggestion that shouldn't come from a devil worshiper. Seeing this, Varkasus chuckled and changed the subject.\u201cAnyway, I, like you, have something to accomplish in this academy.\u201dHaving said that, the boy looked at the building\u00a0 nestled in the horizon, Elfante Academy.It was a place full of vitality, just what he needs to achieve his 'goal.'\u201cUntil then, let\u2019s take good care of each other, understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLucien let out another wry smile.If even a single person knew this fact, the entire continent would be completely turned upside down.A devil worshiper and a Saintess collaborating together was simply outrageous.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dHowever.\u201cLet\u2019s do our best, Varkasus.\u201dThis is her answer.\u25cf\u300c My Dear Son,It's almost summer. I heard that summer around there is especially hot. I sent a freeze stone and some fruits produced in the territory to add to your diet. Share it with your friends....I heard that around this time of year, Elfante holds a visit event. Unfortunately, it will be harvest season soon and it would be difficult for me to attend myself.So I will send Butler Herman instead. He can accompany you to the official events and be there if you need anything.Don't worry about the estate; it's peaceful. You've always been a clever child, so we're not overly worried.That's all for now.P.S.If you have any close female friend, bring her over during your vacation and introduce her. Isn't it time for this old man to see his grandson\u2019s face?From Armin Campbell. \u300d\u201c\u2026\u201dWith a dull expression, I folded the letter while holding a bunch of grapes.Yes, grapes. They're from our territory and their quality is excellent.However, I feel so depressed right now.\u2018A close female friend.\u2019Knowing his personality, it's probably just a joke.Well, I can think of a few names that I can take with me.Like Elnore, or maybe Elijah.But if I were to bring either of them to the estate during the vacation, well.\u201c\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t even want to imagine. Who knows what kind of disaster they'll bring.The problem is, considering my current situation, the likelihood of it ending with just these two is extremely low.\u2018Please save humanity.\u2019I sighed, recalling the 'mission' Atalante entrusted to me not long ago.And that is, to seduce all of the devil vessel candidates.\u201c\u2026\u201dI massaged my throbbing head.The president called it a \u2018request\u2019, when in fact, there was never an option to 'decline'.If it is inevitable that I will get entangled with the devil vessels one way or the other, and they become obsessed with me, there would be no way I can survive other than turning them favorably towards me.I\u2019m sorry, Father.The promise I made when I first set out, to never attract attention, was becoming increasingly impossible to keep as time passes.\u2018\u2026I don't know.\u2019Well, the more I brood about this, the more complicated it will get.So right now, let's just focus on solving what's in front of us one by one.< Gift-related Character Notification >\u2665 Elnore Elinalise La Tristan[ Love Level 1 ][ Exclusive Quest 'Curse Inheritance' has been created! ][ D-7 until Exclusive Quest-related events occur ]\u25bc Gideon Galestead La Tristan[ Curiosity Level 1 ][ Exclusive Quest 'Curse Inheritance' has been created! ][ D-7 until Exclusive Quest-related events occur ]Starting with this.[ Main Quest ]\u3016 Chapter 2 \u2013 Ruined Boy King \u3017[ Related events will occur soon! ]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, if it\u2019s a place where a lot of privileged people gather, such an event is bound to get twisted from all the varying interests clashing.Their presence is to intimidate, not be intimidated. And the more privileged they are, the more they care not to be looked down upon.Now, the event has been blown out of proportions with considerably increased significance. So much so that people, who don\u2019t even understand why they are there, sometimes appear.And since Elnore and Gideon's Exclusive Quests were created at the same time, well...It's obvious how things will unfold.\u2018\u2026I will finally see his face.\u2019Gideon Galestead La Tristan.Originally, there wouldn't even be a chance to make contact with such a person.Because in most of the main scenario, he always appear as dead.\u201c\u2026\u201dAh, but that doesn't mean that Elnore is going to slit his throat.While she does dislike him, she wouldn't commit patricide.However, it's true that their relationship is complicated.Gideon... for 'certain reasons,' has been cold towards Elnore ever since she was a child. And Elnore, influenced by that, also hasn't been particularly fond of him either.Rooted from a certain event involving Elnore's 'mother,' their relationship completely shifted.But in all the storylines, the trigger for the complete collapse of Elnore's mental state and awaken as the Gray Devil's vessel always starts with Gideon's death. So it's not like they're blood enemies.Remembering what happens, I couldn't hold in my sigh.Right, so I know all this.\u2018What\u2019s certain is that\u2026\u2019If I ever come face to face with this person, there will definitely be something to \"take away\" there.It would be of great help in confronting the main antagonist of Chapter 2, the 'Boy King'.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt might be rude to think of the Empire's strongest knight like that, but it can\u2019t be helped.The danger I am in is in the extreme, where I could die at any given moment. I can't do nothing.Even more so from Chapter 2 onwards.\u2018The Enlightened.\u2019Executives of the devil worshippers, the main villains of the scenario.They start appearing prominently from Chapter 2, and the Boy King is one of them.They possess power that far surpasses that of the Purifier who have consumed the Devil's Essence, reducing him to a speck of dust.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn the first place, it's not a boss battle designed to be won through conventional means.If you think about what kind of character the Boy King is, it becomes even more apparent.\u2018So, that\u2019s that.\u2019In the end, solving it will start with Gideon\u2019s event that is just around the corner.If I can exactly get what I need, the progress will be much smoother.\u2018For now, he's classified as a villain.\u2019Considering the way his character is setup and how he's portrayed in the scenario, it does align to some extent.With his background, how you treat him is key.Now what does this mean?\u2018I don\u2019t know how much effect Fatal Charm will have.\u2019My gift becomes stronger the more extremely aligned to evil the other person is. In that case, with someone like Gideon, who is hard to read, it's uncertain to what extent it will be effective.\u2018And, well\u2026\u2019I have a plan.So that even if I cannot rely on Fatal Charm on this one, I have a backup to still get the thing I need to help myself.However, in order to do that, I have to improve.< Status Info >\u300cDowd Campbell\u300dStrength: FAgility: FEndurance: FLuck: FPower: F< Mastery Info >[ Attribute: Tristan Style Swordsmanship ] [ Grade: Basic ][ Current Proficiency: 58% ][ Master Sword Technique of the Tristan Duke Family. ][ \u25a0 Can exert a certain level of power regardless of weapon. ][ Attribute: Breathing Technique \u2013 Duckweed ] [ Grade: Basic ][ Current Proficiency: 67% ][ \u25a0 A breathing method that dramatically increases the body's endurance and strength when trained for a long time.

I just need to show decent-enough proficiency in Tristan Style Swordsmanship.The problem is that I have to achieve it without using Desperation. Meaning, I need to have my stats and attribute level at a certain point to accomplish it.\u2018\u2026Let\u2019s find a way.\u2019Fortunately, I have quite a few people around me whom I can rely on in times like this.\u25cf\u201cYou want me to teach you swordsmanship?\u201dElnore asked with wide eyes.This was the response I got when I asked on the way out of the classroom after class.\u2018\u2026But how long is she going to take classes with the freshmen?\u2019As soon as Elnore fully recovered from her injuries, the first thing she did was cut in my class.Even as the Student Council President, shouldn't she eventually return to her original class?Isn't this breaking the rules?\u201cEung. There is no such thing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think we'll probably take classes together until you graduate. So you don't need to worry about that part.\u201dIs this what a Student Council President should say?Elnore then nodded, as she puffed her chest out like she's proud of what she said.Her face was still expressionless.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut this is abuse of power.What are you so proud of?\u201cAnyway, I\u2019d like to ask for some guidance on swordsmanship.\u201d\u201cBy the way, didn\u2019t you say that you wanted to study Theology? You'll soon start your major classes, so why invest time in something like this?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t intend on doing it for that long. For now, I need to achieve results in a short period of time. In that respect, the one I can trust the most is Elnore.\u201dWhatever the case may be, she's the first person to consider in this field.She's the most familiar with it, and there's no doubt about her swordsmanship skills.Above all, there is no better teacher in learning \u2018Tristan Style Swordsmanship\u2019 than her.So I asked again, and Elnore's eyes widened as she looked at me for a moment.Then, she suddenly turned her back to me.\u201c\u2026What's wrong?\u201d\u201cIt's nothing, I'm just in a good mood knowing that you trust me.\u201d\u201cIf you're in a good mood, why are you turning your back to me?\u201d\u201cHmm. I practiced my happy face for times like these. Wait and see.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter fidgeting for a while, Elnore finally looked back at me.Her eyebrows were slightly raised more than normal.\u201c\u2026How is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSo, are you going to teach me swordsmanship or not?You still didn't give me an answer.\u201cOra, quite the interesting topic you got over there.\u201dHearing the newcomer's voice, Elnore\u2019s 'happy' expression immediately crumpled.\u201c\u2026You have no business interfering. Step aside.\u201d\u201cEhei, is learning swordsmanship limited to one teacher?\u201dElijah replied with a smile, which made Elnore\u2019s eyebrows grow fiercer.\u201c\u2026Dowd asked me, not you. This is unrelated to you-\u201d\u201cOh, but before entering the academy, I had good experience as a swordsmanship instructor. While the Princess probably haven't taught anyone before, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDespite her menacing demeanor, it seems that Elnore\u2019s personality is still the same. She didn't lie to have taught someone to just counter Elijah, and simply stayed silent.She can be quite stubborn in peculiar ways.I smiled and suggested to Elijah.\u201cHow about we learn together? I do think that Elnore can provide us some great insights.\u201dWell, this is the truth.As far as skill is concerned, there is still a clear gap between the two. If Elnore were to teach her, Elijah would have a lot to learn.Anyway, considering the scenario, Elijah\u2019s growth is essential. In that sense, this is a good opportunity to foster her development.\u201c\u2026\u201dElijah pouted at my words, while Elnore\u2019s expression relaxed.\u201cUm, is that so?\u201dHowever, Elijah grinned as if she remembered something.\u201cThen she'll be the \u2018lone\u2019 instructor, while we learn \u2018together\u2019?\u201dHearing this, Elnore\u2019s expression darkened again.\u201c\u2026\u201dDon\u2019t fall for these childish provocations. Please.\u201c\u2026Since you insist, be an instructor yourself, then.\u201dSaying so with a sigh, Elnore\u2019s expression relaxed again.But as soon as she heard that, Elijah grinned.As if this was what she's been aiming for all along.\u201cOh, is that so? It's a competition then?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cMe or the Princess, who is the better teacher?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhy does it have to be like that?As I squinted at that thought, Elijah continued.\u201cNaturally, whoever is better should be the one \u2018regularly\u2019 teaching in the future, don't you think so?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat is she talking about now?I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201c\u2026Ha.\u201dElnore laughed as she brushed her hair.\u201cLooks like the fledgling freshman has a big ambition. Are you challenging me now?\u201d\u201cOh, but I don't think Princess would be good at teaching?\u201d\u201cCan you take responsibility for that statement?\u201dNo.Hello, I'm here too.Hey!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Use that brain in that thick skull of yours!\u201d\u201cYou call this swordsmanship? This more like flirting than fighting. Are you trying to seduce your enemy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWatching the two's fierce back and forth made my head throb.To be exact, they are having a heated discussion about my \u2018curriculum\u2019.Their overwhelming passion has drawn the attention of everyone in the gym, probably wondering what on earth is happening over here.\u2018\u2026At first, they started relatively amicable.\u2019But the debate that initially began with mutual respect and courtesy has now devolved to personal attacks.\u2018Come to think of it, was it always like this in the story?\u2019These two, well...They're inherently incompatible.Recently, I was hoping that they would at least become somewhat friendly through my mediation, but it seems like that's a too far-fetched idea.The Tristan Duke Family and the Hero.These two are destined against each other until the end of the scenario. That's just how the setting is defined.\u201c\u2026\u201dSo.Unless I intervene, the story will continue as it is.\u2018The further I go, the more I\u2019ll need these two.\u2019Just looking at the Purifier boss battle, an item that shouldn't be here, appeared.Considering this variable, who knows what's waiting for me ahead.And the only people that can defeat the devil is the devil's vessel herself and the hero who has received the angel's blessing.These two are my most reliable allies. Their assistance is essential for the progression of the scenario.\u2018\u2026Isn't this also in the game?\u2019Depending on the route you take, their relationship can improve to a fairly good level.However, if I want to directly use the \u2018situation\u2019 to my benefit.It would get dangerous.Mainly.A playboy that's caught is as good as a cold corpse.How much more would the consequences be if the final boss and the main character is involved?If exposed, I'll be ripped to shreds. Literally.\u201c\u2026\u201dEven though I'm in a position where I have to create a harem to prevent the extinction of humanity, I don't really want to do that.There's probably a branch option in the upcoming \u2018Class Observation\u2019 event.\u2018I'll never do it.\u2019Eung. I won't do it even if I die.\u201c\u2026\u201dI've thought about this before and it always ends up strange. However, I won't do it under any circumstance.Whilst I was pondering this, a voice suddenly came from the side.\u201cAh, really! This isn't going to work, let's just do it separately! Mister!\u201d\u201c\u2026Eung?\u201dAn angry Elijah suddenly placed a reverse blade sword in my hand.It\u2019s a steel sword with a cutting edge on the inward curve.[T/N: a Japanese Sakabatou \u3055\u304b\u3070\u3068\u3046: https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%97%AD%EB%82%A0%EA%B2%80 ]As I blankly stared at it, she took a step back and proudly puffed her chest out.\u201cTry following along!\u201dThen, she drew her sword and stomped the ground.Her sword style is probably self-developed.Free-spirited, practical, light and snappy. Whilst still having a fierce and solid attack.At first glance, it just looks like a bunch of erratic movements, but her swift reflexes brought those movements together as one. Even the surrounding students from the Knights Department, who were devoted to self-discipline, looked at her with their eyes wide open.\u201cThere! Did you see it?\u201dAfter finishing her demonstration, Elijah wiped off her sweat and grinned at me.\u201cNow give it a try!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAre you kidding me?\u201c\u2026I thought you'd teach me?\u201d\u201c\u2026I learned this way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnyone can do it, right\u2026?\u201dHer voice gradually faded.Probably because she sensed the bewildered looks from the Knights Department students staring at her.I could feel a headache crashing straight into my brain.Is she just bragging her genius? And didn't she just say she's experienced in teaching swordsmanship?\u201c\u2026You, are you kidding me? You don't even have the basics of education.\u201dElnore, who was watching on the side, rebuked with a sigh.Shen then drew her sword in front of me and assumed a stance.\u201cI'll start with the basic, but most important, stance. Let's begin with a downward strike.\u201dHaving said that, Elnore demonstrated a few simple movements.\u2018Oh, ohoh\u2026\u2019Starting with the footwork, shifting your center of gravity, precise gaze control, and the upper body's posture. With each step being accompanied with a detailed explanation.I thought that she would end up being the same with Elijah, but she's actually teaching standard.\u201cGive it a try.\u201d\u201cYes, this much should be...\u201dSaying so, I grabbed my sword and attempted the downward strike.But.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Um.\u201d\u201c\u2026Uh\u2026\u201dI failed miserably.No, this is harder than I expected.I thought it would be a simple downward motion, but in reality, it's a struggle just to avoid falling over while trying to maintain balance.This is especially true for an untrained person like me. Without the Desperation skill, just holding on to the sword was an ordeal in itself. Not to mention swinging it.The expressions of those who were watching around me were ambiguous. If it were obvious that I was simply a novice, they might have found it cute and cut me some slack. But with such an artistic h\u0336o\u0336r\u0336r\u0336e\u0336n\u0336d\u0336o\u0336u\u0336s\u0336 failure, the atmosphere was more like, \"What was that?\"\u201c\u2026At this level, shouldn't you start by training your body before swordsmanship? Would it even make sense to receive instruction right now? No, didn't you handle monsters easily\u2026?\u201dEven Elijah had a puzzled look on her face.However.\u201cNo, you did well.\u201dWhen Elnore said that expressionlessly, everyone's looks became strange.\u201c\u2026Yes? That was good?\u201d\u201cThat's right. You could use it in real combat.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFacing Elijah, whose face was saying, \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Elnore drew her sword with a sigh.\u201cWatch closely.\u201dStanding in front of the training dummy, Elnore raised her sword.\u201cHeup!\u201dShe slashed straight down.However, it looked clumsy through and through just like the one I did earlier, not a hint of proper posture.Frankly, it's embarrassing to even call it a 'strike'. It's just trying to avoid falling over.Normally, the sword strike would've done near zero damage and simply bounce off the dummy. But then...-!-!!!-!!!!!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I only accept rebuttals in a duel.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhile Elijah squinted in silence, my gaze remained glued on the wreckage that Elnore had left.\u2018\u2026Is she stronger than before?\u2019I know that her exceptional physical ability was formidable, but it was unlikely that she could display this level of power at this point in time.There is only one hypothesis I could come up with.\u2018Has she fused with the fragment to that extent already?\u2019If a devil\u2019s vessel is rapidly progressing in strength, there is no other possibility.Completely fusing with the fragment would boost one's stats and would give rise to special abilities.This is a fortunate development that could greatly help me in the scenario, but it's not entirely pleasant either.Especially considering how events usually unfold within the game.\u2018Devil vessels are greatly influenced by each other\u2019s presence.\u2019If Elnore has fused with the fragment to this extent, it is highly likely that other vessels with devil fragments will also be affected, increasing the likelihood of awakening the devil within them.In other words, this is a warning sign that another \u2018vessel\u2019 is about to emerge.In addition, this is also a catalyst that accelerates progression of the main scenario.\u2018\u2026This isn\u2019t the time to be relaxed.\u2019The devil vessels usually appear in accordance with the progression of the scenario.Thus, it is almost inevitable that another vessel, other than Elnore, will appear over the course of Chapter 2.In short.I will soon meet a powerful and dangerous woman who will become obsessed with me.Which basically means that I'll get caught up in several events that could cost me my literal life.So as to not die, getting stronger faster is practically a requirement.\u2018Swordsmanship is important, but I also need to develop other areas.\u2019If it's urgent, then divinity-related things are necessary.The amulet's growth will increase my overall survivability and adapting skills so I should put this on the list.And, one more thing.\u201cNo, you're just taking advantage of the situation!\u201d\u201cHmm. Didn't I say I only accept rebuttals in a duel?\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, neither of you can teach, so please be quiet.\u201dI sighed and stopped the two from wrangling again.Even though I did say that they are my most reliable allies.But I can't learn swordsmanship from these two.\u25cfThere is only one remaining option.Something that can train both swordsmanship and divinity.\u201c\u2026You want a pass to the \u2018equipment room\u2019?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen I confidently made the request, Atallante's expression subtly changed.\u201cDo you know what\u2019s in there?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already met her once.\u201dI ran into her when I was taking the Ultima.A swordsman who cuts everything that comes three steps around her.Yuria Greyhounder. The Final Boss of Chapter 2.And, along with the Saintess, she is also a promising 'vessel' candidate.\u201c\u2026\u201dThat's right. The Final Boss of Chapter 2 is not the Boy King, but her.In more ways than one, the Boy King is not someone the player character can handle, so the actual final battle will take place with her.\u201cTo be honest, she's not a good person to touch right now.\u201dAtallante took out a key with a sigh.Nonetheless, she seems to have accepted my request, like a noble who listens to anything I say. Still, she couldn't just do it without giving me a word of warning.\u201cHer existence itself is a risk factor that can trigger a war between the Empire and the Holy Kingdom. I didn't hide her out of sight in Elfante for nothing.\u201dWith a serious face, Atallante continued.\u201cAnd, you know about the upcoming class observation, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDuring the event, members of the Holy Kingdom, including the Saintess, will be staying in Elfante. Yuria Greyhounder's existence must not get exposed during that time.\u201dWith a wry smile, I nodded in response to Atallante's words.Certainly, if Yuria's existence rises to the surface, that itself would be a disaster.\u2018Precisely, the problem lies in the sword she's holding\u2026\u2019The Holy Kingdom's national treasure, which creates a \u2018Curse of Severance\u2019 that prevents people from getting close to the wielder. Likewise, the wielder can't get close to other people. It\u2019s an item that Yuria stole and ran away with a long time ago.As I\u2019ve said before, this is the reason why she manically cuts down anything that comes three steps within her.Quite literally, if Yuria is caught with the sword, there\u2019s a high possibility that things will go haywire between the two countries.That\u2019s how important the Holy Kingdom regards it.\u2018\u2026That being said.\u2019The closer the distance between herself and the other person, Yuria\u2019s fighting power also skyrockets.Especially if the distance is within two steps. Even if Elnore and Elijah attack at the same time, they'll probably still lose.The reason why Elnore and Elijah\u2019s close combat skills are only \u2018top tier\u2019, and not the \u2018strongest\u2019, is because of Yuria\u2019s existence.\u2018\u2026\u2019The problem is that the national treasure of the Holy Kingdom, in conjunction with the Boy King, inevitably stirs a major incident in the Academy.It's also a key item in Chapter 2.\u201cSo, I need to at least know what business you have with her. If I deem it too dangerous, I have no choice but to reject this request.\u201dAtallante solemnly said.\u201cThe curse itself is highly dangerous, and politically, its very existence is no different than a ticking time bomb. There are many reasons why important people like you shouldn\u2019t be in contact with someone like her. Your actions must be completely devoid of any risks.\u201d\u201cAh, then you can be rest assured.\u201dNo matter how dangerous Yuria may be, it's not that risky for me to go there.It's just a way for my divinity and swordsmanship to rapidly grow at the same time.I answered with a smile.\u201cIt's nothing grand, I just want to have a little sword spar.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI plan to do this every day for the next week or so.\u201dAtallante's expression rapidly soured.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn't want this to happen.No, never.Shedding tears of blood, she pleaded while vomiting.However, not a single word is reached.Her mouth won't open.Everyone glared at her with resentful eyes, wishing upon her curses as they morph into a cold corpse.Then, she saw a man emerging from the sea of bodies.A robe of pure gold. A pure white wand. A swinging rosary.A man boasting a perfect beauty as if he's meticulously created by a God.Yuria knew who it was.The Pope. The pinnacle of all religious figures in this era.[Are you still hoping for someone to save you?]An eerie sound, like a jade bead rolling on a tray, echoed out.[Are you still hoping to get close with someone?]However.To her, it was the voice of a \u2018predator\u2019 that made her body shake just by hearing it.[You cursed apotropaic.]She dreams of this.Always.[You will be alone until you die.]It ended with the Pope's whisper.\u25cf\u201c\u2026!\u201dHer eyes opened with a shallow scream.Her whole body was drenched in cold sweat.\u201c\u2026\u201dYuria Greyhounder rubbed her face and looked out the window.Fortunately, she hadn't overslept.Her day always started at a regular time.Living a self-sufficient life in a place far from people, even a refined greenhouse flower would get accustomed to the life in the wild.Through the window, she caught a glimpse of the Academy building.A civilized society filled with vibrant energy.\u201c\u2026\u201dYuria averted her dry gaze from that direction.She had no time for such places. She had mountains of tasks to accomplish.She needs to reinforce her tent, check the traps and snares she set up to catch prey, and also wash the clothes she's been wearing for a week.That was her life. A savage living in a place completely disconnected from society, no other human interaction.A sparkling and brilliant civilization awaits her, and it was only half a day's walk away. However, she was never a human who could approach it.Curse of Severance. The bondage of a lifetime of isolation.She just needs to do her role and today is no exception.Yes. That's how it should be.\u201cAre you awake?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThat's what would have happened if it had not been for this strange man suddenly appearing out of nowhere.A masked face, an altered voice.\u2018\u2026Uh?\u2019She knew this person. More precisely, she recognized that familiar mask.This is the person who visited her once before and gave her delicious snacks.And, he also said that he knew something about herself and her \u2018sister\u2019.Recalling such information, Yuria instinctively calculated the distance between herself and this man with sleepy eyes.Three steps, then.He came closer!\u201c\u2026!\u201dAgain, she violently drew her sword out against her will.Her face turned pale seeing the sword lunging towards the man at lightning speed.This time, once again.She's about to kill someone again against her will.\u201cThat's right.\u201dHowever, the man pulled out the sword he had prepared as if he had been waiting for this.Then, he effortlessly parried her attack.Continuing on, he stood his ground and blocked her successive strikes.As if he had intended to do so from the beginning.After the continuous exchange of blows, he swiftly went outside the three-step range when he slowly started getting pushed back.\u201c\u2026This should be enough. Enduring it is worth, and I'm getting closer\u2026\u201dHe mumbled something with a satisfied tone.As if her attacks were worth receiving.\u201c\u2026\u201dYuria was stunned for a moment as she alternately looked at her sword and the man.It wasn\u2019t the first time she'd seen someone \u2018receiving\u2019 her attack. Especially if it's about three steps.The way her sword works is the closer the opponent, the more her combat abilities increase. Likewise, the farther the opponent within her range, the less powerful her attacks are.The problem is...\u2018This is the second time, isn\u2019t it?\u2019On their first meeting, this man also got attacked after closing the distance.That's why, afterwards, when he completely disappeared, she understood.\u201c\u2026\u201d-You will be alone until you die.These words that she always hear in her dreams echoed in her mind.That's right. She knows very well that it is her destiny.After all, who on earth would want to get entangled with someone who'll slice you up if you get even an inch closer than permitted.\u201cOkay. Judging from your swings, you seem healthy. Have you been well?\u201dExcept for this strange man in front of her.As Yuria looked at the man perplexed, he slumped down and caught his breath.It seems that the intense exchange they just had has exhausted him considerably.[\u2026What is, what the hell?]Characters formed by manifesting divine power floated before her eyes.As someone afflicted by the Curse of Severance, she couldn't use her vocal cords. Hence why she's communicating this way.It was a question filled with complex doubts.What is the point of doing this? What the hell are you doing?Last time, he just disappeared and didn\u2019t come back for a while. Then now, he suddenly came back with a sword and competed against her.Moreover, he skillfully maneuvered within her \"danger zone.\"As if he knew about her curse.\u2018\u2026No, what is it really?\u2019Truly, his existence is just incomprehensible.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you before? I'll occasionally come to bring you food.\u201dHowever, the other party simply replied like so.In fact, along with those words, a lunch box filled with food slid towards her.\u201cEat. I'm taking my leave. Someone will get angry if I stay for too long.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYuria blankly stared at the man leaving.What kind of person is he, really?The day passed just like that.She spent the rest of the day pondering over thoughts of that man while attending to her tasks.\u2018What's going on? What kind of person is he?\u2019She was accustomed to the solitary life. She had plenty of time for thinking.\u2018It's probably just a whim.\u2019In the evening, just before she's about to sleep, she successfully came to that conclusion and wore a satisfied smile. It was the result of thinking only of him for 9 hours.Yeah, that's right. He hadn\u2019t shown himself for a while after visiting her once.It will probably be the same this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Today, it was 12.Her brain, which had rarely been put to use due to living a monotonous savage life, was being pushed to its limits.\u2018Could there be something special he wants from me?\u2019She thought of a reasonable hypothesis.The first time they met, he said he was \u2018asked\u2019 by someone to take care of her. It seems that there has been a recent change in that regard.\u2018\u2026But what's with the sword fight?\u2019In the end, she couldn't reach a conclusion until she fell asleep.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dThe next day, the man came again.Following the same routine, he threw her a lunchbox.\u201cHey, do you know?\u201dBut this time, he didn't leave right away and engaged in small talk with her.It was simply trivial conversation.He talked about the happenings at the Academy, the current nice weather, and something he found amusing recently.Really, it was a dreary story with no value whatsoever.She didn\u2019t even respond. She didn't know anything, so she had nothing to give back. Meanwhile, the man just tells his stories as he pleased.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, for Yuria, who has not had the opportunity to interact with people for a long time.For the first time in a long while, she felt like she had a \"human\" conversation.\u201cHey!\u201dHowever, perhaps because the man stayed longer than usual, someone came to pick up him up.It was someone Yuria knew, President Atallante.The person who provided her a place to hide and stay.\u201cI warned you not to stay for too long! How many times have I told you that if someone like you gets hurt, it will cause a big problem\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit too rude to just exchange swords and then leave. And it's not dangerous if you chat a little farther away. I'm just being friendly, what are you getting so antagonistic about?\u201d\u201cStudent always like to talk misleadingly! I\u2019m telling you not to stay long because I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll cause an accident while talking nonsense!\u201d\u201c\u2026That, I can\u2019t argue.\u201dYuria heard such a conversation in the distance, as the man got dragged away by Atallante.Perhaps they thought Yuria wouldn't hear them, but it was futile because she was keenly listening.\u2018A student, huh.\u2019She managed to gather a few fragmented pieces of information.He obviously knows about her curse.He's a student at the Academy and someone impressive enough for Atallante to personally take care of.And yet...He wants to be friends with someone like her.\u201c\u2026\u201d-You will be alone until you die.Once again, that sentence came to mind. Yuria chuckled to herself.She knows. She knows it too.That's why she had no intention of harboring such futile hope of it actually happening.She's just curious, that's all.Like what could they be thinking?And so, she spent almost the entire day thinking about that person.Continuously, endlessly.About the mysterious masked student.\u2018\u2026I don\u2019t know anything.\u2019Similar days followed with the same pattern.An bout of swords, giving her a lunchbox, engaging in small talk, and then disappearing immediately.She doesn't understand why he keeps wearing a mask, nor does she have an idea on who asked him to come give her food every day.Even more, despite fully knowing the viciousness of her curse, he kept entering within her range.Saying \u2018I want to be friends\u2019 while getting stabbed felt incomprehensible.She doesn't know anything for sure.Even after contemplating for 22 hours, sacrificing sleep, she made no significant progress in her mind, just a headache.\u2018Will he come again tomorrow?\u2019On that day, she had this thought before going to bed.As if, even just a little.She was hoping for his return.\u25cf\u201c\u2026That wasn't too bad, right?\u201dI mumbled while taking off the mask.The fastest way to mastering any skill, like I said before, is engaging in real combat against strong opponents.In that regard, Yuria confidently ranked at the top in what the players call a \"Skill Grinding Optimization NPC\".Because despite her being ridiculously strong, you can end the fight by controlling the distance.Through constant battles, you can rapidly increase your Attribute level.Moreover, since the closer you are, the stronger Yuria becomes, once you've accumulated enough proficiency to withstand the current distance, you can simply get closer and further accelerate the growth of your Attributes.That's what I've been doing.\u2018There\u2026\u2019It is risky as she comes straight for your life, but from my point of view, the more dangerous it is, the better my stats. So it doesn't really bother me that much.Because even if I have a swordsmanship attribute, if my stats are lacking, I won\u2019t be able to use it properly. Given my horrendous stats that barely allows me to swing a sword, let alone wield it, this is actually a cheat.\u2018\u2026And, well. I've got safety measures in place.\u2019Thinking so, I looked at the illusion mask in my hand.This is the same mask I wore the first time I met her.It is a must-have item for the so-called \u2018Yuria Skill Grinding Mechanic\u2019.This is a tip that only veteran players know. Due to the Curse of Severance, the automatic attacks are slightly less powerful if the opponent had their face covered.\u2018There should be a reason for it.\u2019If used properly, it\u2019s helpful in the finale of Chapter 2, but I can\u2019t remember what it was.It looks very trivial, yet it is so important\u2026\u2018\u2026I\u2019ll think about it later.\u2019I'll definitely remember it when the time comes to use it.But for now, I have other matters to attend to.[ Inspection Successful! ][ Attribute: Tristan Style Swordsmanship Proficiency Increased. ][ Proficiency Upgraded! ][ Attribute Grade promoted from \u2018Basic\u2019 to \u2018General\u2019! ]< Mastery Info >[ Attribute: Tristan Style Swordsmanship ] [ Grade: General ][ Current Proficiency: 0% ][ Master Sword Technique of the Tristan Duke Family. ][ \u25a0 Can exert a certain level of power regardless of weapon. ][ \u25a0 When equipped with a longsword, can use \u2018Deflect\u2019. ][ \u25a0 When equipped with a longsword, can partially ignore the opponent's defense and inflict damage. ]\u201c\u2026\u201dThe speed of progression is unusually fast.Even though I had some prior accumulation of proficiency, going from Basic to General proficiency in just 7 days is a crazy achievement.Wasn't it supposed to take at least a month?\u2018And the listed effects\u2026\u2019Deflection is a common parrying technique in the game.

Long time no see!\u201dAs I was thinking so, I saw a gentleman in a suit waving at me from afar.Butler Herman is an elder who has served the Campbell Family for a long time.He has been with the family longer than my own father, who is the master of the house.With the above said, Herman had a peculiar aura that only a master of their craft exuded. Everything he does felt unhurried and relaxed.\u201c\u2026Is Elfante always like this?\u201d\u201cYou could say that.\u201dYet, even someone like Herman couldn't hide his surprise by the scale of the event that is Elfante's Class Observation.In fact, there's not that a lot of people nearby.However, if you look closer on who they are...There were big-time merchants, nobles, and even a nation's royalty.Who would've thought that such giants would gather in one place for some school \u2018class observation\u2019?\u201cNo, even so\u2026\u201dHerman brushed his beard and looked at the massive square arena in the center of the building.\u201c\u2026That, doesn't it seem a little dangerous?\u201dHerman's gaze was drawn to the magitech display installed near the arena.With such a heavyweight crowd, the class observation is filled with things that deviates significantly from its original purpose.Presenting subpar spectacle that would bore high-profile people, that came here from all over the place to watch, is simply impossible.That's why they've prepared this.A student battle royale.\u201c\u2026\u201dThis isn't an event you'd normally expect to find in an academy but rather in a colosseum. However, surprisingly, this is a historic tradition that's been going on since the early days of Elfante's establishment.Truly a dreadful place.\u201cBut, if I may ask, is the Young Master also participating in the middle there?\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, yes.\u201dHerman said with worry. However, I can\u2019t just let this opportunity pass.This is my only chance to capture Gideon's attention.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know if the Lord will be proud or terrified with this.\u201dI smiled wryly as Herman said so.\u2018We're not even at the terrifying part yet.\u2019Be it Elijah or Elnore, no joke, even one of them will turn the whole territory upside down.\u2032\u2032This matter\u2026 concerns me. It seems like all sorts of people are in attendance. I even saw people from the Holy Kingdom on my way here.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201dI responded with a squint.Considering the timing and affiliation, that group probably includes the Saintess and the \u2018Boy King\u2019.Their time of arrival was much faster than expected. Originally, the earliest they come should've been the next month.\u2018As expected.\u2019The flow of the scenario is accelerating.The fact that both of them are coming here means that both the Holy Kingdom and the devil worshipers are starting to make big moves.The reasons may be different for each, but it is clear that both sides want something within this academy.\u2018\u2026I have some rough ideas on what they might be.\u2019And my task is to make it hard for them.I neither want to get close to the Holy Kingdom nor the devil worshipers.As I pondered, Herman continued with a smile.\u201cWell, since it's an event with a large number of participants, it would be nice to show a great performance. It will also increase your popularity among the female students.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, well.\u201d\u201cThat's right, isn\u2019t there another event following the class observation?

It's a system that exists in almost every game in some shape or form.And.For a veteran who has mastered the \u2018timing\u2019 in the game to a perverted level, one would be able to create some pretty interesting situations.\u201c\u2026\u201dWith a bitter smile, I grasped my longsword.To be honest, what I'm about to do is halfway between a scam and a farce. You could even call it a skit.However, this skit...Will be gobbled up by the Empire's strongest Knight.\u25cfA dry tension filled the spectator stands.Given their status, they'd probably chat and have some social interaction with each other.After all, everyone here is either a Leader or a Head, or someone close.Well, 'probably'.That's what would have happened if it had not been for the presence of the man sitting in the middle.\u201cWhy is he here\u2026?\u201d\u201cUm, I don't know either\u2026\u201dThe two people talking look like royalties from somewhere.However, this 'person' was someone even they cannot afford to offend.Gideon Galestead La Tristan. The Empire\u2019s strongest Knight. Archduke Tristan.Everyone's eyes were focused on him, but despite being in the spotlight, the man remained unfazed. He simply looked down at the arena with indifference.\u201cHuh, Gideon? What brings you here?\u201dOf course, in Elfante, there is usually at least one individual who can initiate a conversation regardless of the other party's position or title.For example, Conrad Baltador, the Dean of the Knights School.Gideon\u2019s gaze slowly turned to his direction.\u201c\u2026\u201dSeeing Gideon only give a slight nod, without getting up or saying a word, Conrad smirked.That's right. This much of a response is already significant.If it weren't for the fact that they both trained under the same Master, Gideon would have just completely ignored him.\u201cSo what kind of wind blew a guy with such a heavy hip here?\u201dWithout waiting for an answer, Conrad casually slumped down beside Gideon.Being so close together, Conrad was able to discover something that others hadn't noticed.\u201c\u2026What happened to your arm?\u201dConrad pointed out Gideon\u2019s bandaged arm, which made him momentarily frown.Seeing Gideon quickly cover his arm with his cloak, Conrad chuckled.\u201cYou're still at it, huh? Catching up with the First Archduke Tristan?\u201dIf the Empire's strongest knight was getting hurt to this extent, then there's no other explanation.Gideon often does this. He would engage in crazy endeavors that others would not imagine as 'training'. And all of it was to catch up with the First Archduke, the Sword Saint.\u201cHey, you don't need to push yourself too hard, you have a child-\u201d\u201cSeonbae.\u201dGideon spoke in a low voice.\u201cThat's enough.\u201dAt the same time, a chilling air swept up like blades slicing through the air.\u201cYou know what I hate.\u201dThe surrounding people were cold sweating buckets. Meanwhile, Conrad was surprised.\u2018\u2026This bastard, he got even stronger?\u2019Although Gideon was stronger than him before, the gap he felt from the aura just now was bewildering.In the past, he's at least able to win three or four times out of ten fights.But now, he feels that no matter how many times they would fight, he'll lose every single one.\u201c\u2026Ah fine. I get it. I won't bring up your daughter. So, how did your arm end up like that?\u201dAs Conrad causally let it go, Gideon took back his frown and regained composure.Then, with a shallow sigh, he replied.\u201c\u2026I was training based on the passages left by the Sword Saint. It is a virtue that is the foundation of all swordsmanship he left behind.\u201d\u201cWhat was it?\u201d\u201cTake Mt. Tai as your own.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIs he serious, what the hell is he talking about?Conrad asked with a frown.\u201cSo what did you do?\u201d\u201cI tried cleaving a mountain first.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt didn\u2019t go well.\u201d\u201c\u2026You thought that would work?\u201dRight. Looking at it like this, they are definitely father and daughter.They're so similar to each other. Elnore inherited that blank expression while saying something outlandish.\u2018Blood doesn\u2019t lie\u2026\u2019Right in time as Conrad smiled bitterly, the \u2018players\u2019 also started entering the stage.They were all carrying their respective weapons with a tense atmosphere.Conrad snorted seeing one person trembling all over.Although they are highly regarded talents from various regions of the Empire, most of them are inexperienced and have never been in a real battle. It's only natural for them to tense up in front of a large crowd.There are also those who's pushed by their families in the name of honor.Meanwhile, one of them stood out like a sore thumb.\u2018He's here too?\u2019Among the group, one person didn't seem to be tense at all.No, rather than a lack of tension, he almost looks bored.Dowd Campbell.With a dazed expression, he walked out using a long sword like a cane.\u2018\u2026Eum?\u2019And.Noticing Gideon\u2019s gaze also fixed in Dowd's direction, Conrad grinned.\u201cSo, did you come to see him?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBut Gideon merely continued looking without giving any answer.Every move, each gesture, he was scanning everything.It's as if he's trying to analyze something.Then, his eyes flickered for a moment.\u201cSeonbae.\u201d\u201cEung?\u201d\u201cWhat is the relationship between that man and my daughter?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cHas my daughter ever taught him the sword? No\u2026\u201dGideon paused for a moment, before he continued.\u201c\u2026He definitely learned something. How much did he learn? A few months? A year?\u201d\u201cHey, hold on. Wait a moment.\u201dFacing such sudden questions, Conrad responded bewildered.\u201cThey seem quite close, but I don't know anything about learning swords or something similar. Besides, he\u2019s a freshman. It\u2019s only been two months since he came to the academy.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dConfusion crossed Gideon\u2019s face.Cosidering how he usually doesn\u2019t show any emotion on his face, no matter the circumstance, this was very unusual.\u201c\u2026it can\u2019t be. That's definitely our family's-\u201d\u201cAll players, mutual salute!\u201dThe resounding voice of the referee in the center of the arena cut off Gideon's words.\u201cReady!\u201dAt this time, everyone in the arena took their positions.The Knights School with their weapons, Mage School with their spells, and Theology School with their blessings and miracles.\u201cBegin!\u201dWith the referee\u2019s declaration, the arena quickly plunged into chaos.You are left to fend for yourself, no allies other than your own efforts, and surrounded by enemies from all sides. It\u2019s a messy mix of multiple battles unfolding in every direction.In an instant, nearly half of the participants were wiped out. Even in the ongoing battle, the numbers were also dwindling at a terrifying speed.Likewise, the hidden gems were also quickly getting uncovered.Conrad smiled as he looked down at the arena.The reason why such a crude and savage event had continued for so long was because it's amazing at what it does. That is, to find talent. Some individuals would showcase their true worth in such chaotic combat situations.With enemies on all sides, they would display overwhelming skills and abilities.\u2018There are already some decent ones.\u2019A man wielding a spear, overwhelming his surroundings. Conrad was familiar with him. Tallion Armand. The eldest son of Viscount Armand.And there's also a woman with only her fists and some gloves on, knocking down everyone around her. But her deep hood made it difficult to see her face.\u2018These two are the most overwhelming.\u2019At the freshman level, these two are almost beyond the standard. If it weren\u2019t for Elijah, the hero candidate, they're more than capable of aiming for the top of their grade.\u201cSo, what do you think? See\u2026\u201dJust as Conrad turned his head to ask the opinion of the person next to him, he suddenly stopped.It was because he noticed that Gideon\u2019s gaze never once moved.The Empire's strongest knight was solely focused on one person right from the beginning.\u201c\u2026\u201dDowd Campbell.As soon as the sparring started, he positioned to a corner of the arena and holed himself there, not moving a single step.Yes. That\u2019s all.\u2018\u2026He\u2019s holding up well.\u2019Though, he remained on the defensive.Standing in place, blocking and repelling those who come at him.Well, it's a survival strategy, it's not hard to understand. But compared to the previous two stars, he's only like a firefly next to them.\u201cThis is unexpected. Did you like such a modest way of fighting?\u201d\u201cIs that all you see?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIn my eyes, it looks a little different.\u201dSaying so, Gideon rose from his seat and walked towards the fence.It was as if he wanted to get a closer look at the man.\u201c\u2026\u201dGideon laughed.\u201cYou're laughing now?\u201dThere's not even a point denying it.It felt like a puzzle he had been pondering for a long time was solved all at once.Take Mt. Tai as your own.This is what the Sword Saint said.He continued to watch the man standing in a secluded spot, defending against the attacks.However, it wasn't simply defending while standing still.He anticipated every attack, waited for the perfect moment, and \"deflected\" them.\u2018The basics of Tristan Style Swordsmanship.\u2019Deflection.The fundamental technique of 'bouncing off' the opponent's attack to create an opening.But used to its extreme.Magic, miracles and blessings,Everything was nullified as if blocked by a massive wall.With just that, the opponent's attacks were rendered futile, as they stumble and lose their ground.And with those openings, he inserts a light attack and effortlessly push the opponent back.\u2018\u2026a freshman.\u2019What a joke!If he's \"just\" a freshman, then the Empire's Knights, including himself, are nothing more than inexperienced novices.Conrad\u2019s eyes widened when he saw the other party's expression from the side.A twisted smile hung on Gideon\u2019s lips.It was as if he had discovered something genuinely interesting.Or.\u2018It's not just about defending.\u2019It was an expression of \u2018Win-win\u2019[1].The Empire\u2019s strongest knight to a mere freshman.\u2018You win by blocking.\u2019Fancy attacks and all, they mean nothing.Everything is optimized.Standing in place, not moving a single step, all while creating a suffocating pressure.It almost looks like...\u201cMt. Tai.\u201dThis is probably the \u2018virtue\u2019 that the First Archduke Tristan spoke of.Gideon\u2019s eyes flashed fiercely.&&&TL Notes:[1] 'Win-win' or \ud638\uc2b9\uc2ec(Hoseungsim) is the hunger or desire to succeed or win.*specific term/word taken from https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/RivalryPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But since I got this system prompt at this time, it only meant him.\u2018\u2026Actually, this is a scam.\u2019The setting of the story was that the foundation of the First Archduke Tristan's swordsmanship is the \u2018basics reaching the peak\u2019.Anticipating everything the opponent will do and moving one step ahead, dominating the opponent through defense alone.\u201c\u2026\u201dOf course, if someone could do that, there wouldn't be any opponents they couldn't defeat.It's a level of swordsmanship where one could slice through space and distort time. If you can't do such a thing, you wouldn't even be at the starting point.And, if you can actually do that, then that\u2019s a whole different story.\u2018\u2026I can use Elnore later.\u2019In the game, it's called \u2018Infinite Veil\u2019.It is an absolute defense that blocks and deflects all attacks, needing nothing but a single sword.Compared to such an insane skill, what I'm doing right now is practically a joke.However, I can roughly imitate the effect.Swords, magic, miracles and blessings. Whatever it may be.As long as I know the timing, I can \u2018deflect\u2019 all of them using Tristan Style Swordsmanship.\u201cWhat, what is this?\u201d\u201cHow can you use a sword against magic\u2026!\u201dI casually knocked down the poor confused fella who said that.Even when Desperation is only raised to C Grade, it's more than enough to deal with an average freshman.Having my back to the corner covers my blindspot, so I don\u2019t need to worry about attacks coming from behind. I could simply focus on the students in front.As a result, only a total of three people, including myself, were left standing on the arena.Well, one person\u2026\u201cI will forfeit.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t beat Hyeongnim anyway. 2nd and 3rd place have the same reward, right?\u201dTallion readily raised his hand, while saying so.His clean forfeit declaration was so surprising that even the referee was taken aback.\u201c\u2026What were you even doing here then?\u201d\u201cOh, I came because they said there's prize money.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAren't you the son of a Viscount, why are you impoverished?Don't you have pocket money?\u201cI have to pay an additional fine for getting involved with Marquis Riverback.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201d\u201cYeah. Oh, by the way.\u201dAs Tallion exited with light steps, he passed by me and slightly lowered his head.\u201cBe careful of that person, Hyeongnim.\u201dAt the end of Tallion\u2019s finger was the last other person on the arena, who's wearing gloves.They were cracking their knuckles.Purple hair poked out from their hood. Judging by their physique...\u2018\u2026A woman?\u2019As I frowned, Tallion spoke again.\u201cI\u2019m just here for the money\u2026 but that person over there seems a bit dangerous.\u201d\u201cDangerous?\u201d\u201cShe seemed to enjoy beating people, and has been tormenting her opponents to the end.\u201dIn fact, I could see several students lying around, half covered in blood.As Tallion left the arena, I scanned the other party from head to toe.\u201c\u2026\u201dYes. I totally agree with what Tallion said.A person like that would thrive in a place like this.\u201cWhat, you're not coming?\u201dAs I looked at her with a firm expression, she suddenly said.\u201cThen shall I go?\u201dThen, a chill ran down my spine.It\u2019s a familiar feeling.This was the same gap that I felt when I faced Elijah without any stat boost.[ A moment of danger has been detected. ][ Determined the situation as life-threatening. ][ Skill: Desperation raised to EX Grade. ]\u201c\u2026!\u201dAs soon as the opponent's figure \"disappeared,\" I instinctively activated the skill.[ \u2018Skill: Swordsman's Focus\u2019 has been activated! ][ Reaction speed and precision has been increased! ]The world around slowed down.My reaction time has improved dramatically to the point where it feels like the entire world had been turned into slow-motion footage.This was because of the overlap between this skill and Desperation EX.\u2018\u2026Such a cheat.\u2019While thinking so, my expression suddenly hardened seeing what's in front.Even in a slow motion world, someone was moving exceptionally fast.Sure, it was at walking pace, but considering the speed at which the surroundings was slowed down, this was an insane speed.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI gritted my teeth and tried to take a defensive stance, but my body was too slow.\u2018\u2026Ah, that\u2019s right.\u2019Just because my reaction speed is faster doesn't mean my body is the same.After waiting for my body to be in position, I released the skill with a wry smile.And at the same time, a fist came crashing against my sword.-!\u2026Was there just sparks?From a sword and a fist?\u201c\u2026\u201dAs I took a few steps back from the rebound, the woman wiggled her hand in surprise.She didn't seem to expect that I could block her attack.But.\u201cEh, I thought you're inept?\u201dSoon, her momentum violently changed.Since she's wearing a very low hood, her eyes weren't visible, but the sinister smile exposed under definitely was.It's the look of a beast who found their prey.\u201cSo you were holding back?\u201dThen her arms and legs started to emit a colorful aura.It feels completely different from the magic that mages use or the divine power of priests.As soon as I saw that, another chill ran down my spine.\u201cI concede.\u201dI promptly raised my hand and said so.\u201c\u2026 You concede?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI replied to the dismayed referee.I didn't have a single scratch on me. And the situation became even more absurd considering that I boasted a speed that rivals Tallion's.\u201c\u2026\u201dUh. No.It would be delusional to think that I can defeat this person, who will be charging at me with full force, with my current strength.\u201c\u2026Hey.\u201dThinking so, I tried to quickly leave the arena, when the other party called out.\u201cWhat are you doing? It was starting to get interesting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNo.I already forfeited.But if I just leave without saying a word here, I felt like she would chase me down. So...\u201cNo, that would be troublesome.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cIf you start using magic here, what do you think would happen?\u201dIt's true.A magic power that only the members of the Tribal Union can use is particularly effective in body enhancement. Even with Desperation at EX Grade, I cannot guarantee victory against her.No. It's impossible to confront this person in the first place.\u2018Warchief\u2019s daughter, please\u2026!\u2019Riru Garda, a key character in Chapter 5.The second daughter of the Tribal Union's Warchief. A sadist who enjoys beating people.Above all...\u2018\u2026She's currently stronger than Elnore, right?\u2019Especially considering that Elnore and Elijah haven\u2019t fully grown yet.If I were to face her right now, I would be a cold corpse in less than three seconds.I don't know why she participated in this event, but anyway, running away is the best course of action right now\u2026!\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dI quickly made my way down the arena with my back facing the other party. I have no intention of turning around. Meanwhile, Riru\u2019s eyes followed me all the way.Unwaveringly.Until my figure completely disappeared from her sight.That is why.\u201c\u2026He knows my magic? A man from the Empire.\u201dI was no longer there to hear Riru\u2019s muttering.\u25cf[ Skill: Fatal Charm has been conditionally activated! ][ Excellent timing! You planted a seed that will explosively increase favorability in the future! ][ Next successful activation will have double the effect! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dI don't know, I couldn't be bothered.I have long given up trying to analyze why this happens.I can understand that I'm starting to get Gideon's attention, but who is this supposed to be?\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOf course, what is even more incomprehensible is the current situation.Right after the sparring, I was kidnapped by someone as I was leaving the arena.A maid standing nearby hands me a cup of tea.Of course, I don't have time to care about such things.Because the person I was facing in front was enough to make me break out in a cold sweat.\u201c\u2026It is an honor meeting you, Archduke Tristan.\u201dHe simply closed his eyes and nodded.It\u2019s been this way since earlier.It feels suffocating if I leave it quiet for too long.The atmosphere felt like ice. There's a certain aura emanating from him that puts those around on edge.And, this person is a leading powerhouse of the Empire that could not only erase me, but also my entire family's territory with a single word.This is just one of the many reasons to be nervous about.\u2018\u2026I did expect him to be interested.\u2019For some reason, this man has great interest in the swordsmanship of the First Archduke Tristan.Just by showing him a little bit of insight, he immediately called me for a 1:1 meeting.Or, perhaps, it's because of his daughter.\u201cDowd Campbell.\u201dI jumped in surprise hearing him suddenly talk like that.\u201cWhat is your relationship with my daughter?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt sounded like a father grilling his daughter\u2019s boyfriend, but I know that that's not what he meant.\u201c\u2026The Princess always helps me. She has been of great assistance in my academy life-\u201d\u201cDid you learn the sword from her?\u201dNo.This is a signal.I forced a smile in front of Gideon, who's exuding an icy chill.\u201c\u2026She only taught me the simple downward slash.\u201dGideon\u2019s eyes, which were closed, slowly opened.The sharpness of his eyes made me feel like he could cut me with just his gaze. I could feel my palms getting moist.\u201cThen where did you learn our family's swordsmanship?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFacing his gaze, I took a deep breath.Yes. There\u2019s no way he wasn\u2019t able to recognize it.From here, it becomes crucial.In fact, this is the beginning of the plan in Chapter 2 Boy King.First things first, let's do what we do best.\u201cI'm sure the Archduke is aware of it.\u201dAnd that is.Scamming.\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cThe Sword Saint has always been unpredictable. Even going as far as discovering \u2018talented children\u2019 in rural areas.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWith enough talent, he even teaches them the difficult Tristan Style Swordsmanship.\u201dGideon\u2019s eyes narrowed.The coldness in the air seethed even stronger, threatening to freeze up my blood.Of course, that's a lie.The Sword Saint, who is both the teacher of Archduke Tristan and the current head of the Elfante Knights School, is a person who repeatedly seeks out geniuses throughout the continent and trains them in swordsmanship.As his existence is hardly known to the public, just the fact that I know his identity adds some credibility to my lie.\u201c\u2026Are you implying that we're under the same teacher?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dI dryly swallowed hearing Gideon say that.Next, the game starts.To be honest, this lie will easily be exposed. Someone like Gideon has plenty of ways to verify the truth.\u201c\u2026\u201dThat's why, I have to cover it up.\u201cAnd, he entrusted me with a request. He asked me to do something if I ever meet the Archduke.\u201dFrom what I\u2019ve experienced so far.The best way to hide a tree is to create a forest.A big lie to cover a little one.\u201c\u2026Request?\u201dSo, what I\u2019m going to do is...\u201cArchduke Tristan.\u201dKeep on scamming.\u201cHow about learning the sword from me?\u201dAnd if I'm gonna do it.I'll do it as grand as possible.[T/N: I will change the update schedule to weekly (on weekends like today) instead of every other day since I see that most dont like the cut up(parts) chapters.I'll be following slightly below the standard of 3 chapters a week of big groups, and only guarantee 2 chaps since the word count of this novel varies.

A state where killing an opponent is just a matter of snapping one's fingers.Although it is not at the level of the First Archduke Tristan, who can slice through entire spaces, it is still a crazy skill that can penetrate through most armor when used with a sword. There are records of it even piercing through dragon scales.\u2018\u2026Is he insane?\u2019No, isn\u2019t this near the final tier of knight skills?This made me truly realize that the title of the Empire's Strongest Knight couldn't just be obtained by playing cards.Considering the unknown whereabouts of the current Sword Saint, there is practically no one else in the Empire who can use this skill, and reaching such a level of mastery.Meanwhile, here I am conning such an existence.\u201cYou have to be better than me to teach me. But you couldn\u2019t even react.\u201dGideon continued, still expressionless.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to make a ridiculous proposal, why don\u2019t you make it a little more believable?\u201d\u201cI simply thought there was no need to react to something unfinished.\u201dBut.\u2018\u2026Got you.\u2019I inwardly smiled.If I did react even a little bit, it would simply expose my weaknesses.But because I didn't show any reaction, I still have an opening I can exploit.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf it was a completed technique, the 'action' itself would have been omitted. Don't you think so?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOriginally, this is information that no one should knowIt is only an imitation skill, and not a single soul should know the completed version.\u2018\u2026Except me.\u2019Uh. Really.Even though it was a movement used by a character in a game, I perfectly understand the direction, completion, and application of this skill.I have grounds to \u2018pretend to know\u2019 as much as I want.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn fact, Gideon\u2019s eyes slightly widened when he heard my words.He should agree with me.He knows best that this is incomplete.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSilence follows.Gideon was glaring at me with a slight frown.\u2018\u2026\u2019However, it is different from before.Because I can clearly feel that I have the upper hand. I can just sit back and relax.Calculations are probably racing like mad in Gideon\u2019s mind right now.Like 'who is this guy?' Or 'what's his identity?'Despite showing his strongest skill, this kid saw through it while sitting and doing nothing.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re quite good with your tongue.\u201dHe's backed off and will continue observing for now.Which is a relief for me.I've passed the most difficult obstacle.The worst case scenario was that he put a blade to my throat, believing that I was mocking him. Fortunately, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.Perhaps the points I scored during the previous sparring was playing a role here.Then, one more thing.\u201cTry to increase the rotation a bit more.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe line is not drawn perfectly when the image is formed. Try to rotate it a little more at that moment.\u201dIn fact, I don\u2019t even know what the hell I'm saying.But these are the words that this person himself leaves in the future.\u2018Gideon\u2019s diary.\u2019This is an item that Elnore obtains after Gideon\u2019s death in the story. It lays out everything, detailing the process through which he trained his swordsmanship.Elnore's growth also exponentially increase because of this. It could be said that Elnore\u2019s combat prowess, capable of slicing through dozens of regular knights with a single strike, can be attributed to the foundation laid by this person.And I remember all the contents of that valuable diary.I inwardly let out a wry smile.\u2018\u2026The whole Master thing is all bullsht.\u2019In other words.I am simply giving Archduke Tristan the enlightment he will gain in the future.And wrapping it up as \u2018teaching\u2019 him with a bow on top.\u201c\u2026\u201dGideon, who had a frown upon hearing what I had just said, was silent for a moment before closing his eyes.And, this time.Without any movement or gesture, a slash magically appeared above the space.\u201c\u2026\u201dWitnessing such a sight, Gideon's eyes widened.\u201c\u2026What?!\u201dAccompanying Gideon's slightly trembling voice were several windows, appearing before my eyes in succession.[ Skill: Fatal Charm has been activated! ][ The villain is shocked at your far-reaching achievement! ][ Rewards are added to the Gift tab! ][ The number of villains who felt emotions other than \u2018like\u2019 to you has exceeded a certain range! ][ Gift enhancement condition fulfilled! ][ \u2018Gift #1: Fated Love\u2019 has been enhanced! ]\u2026This can be enhanced?As I silently blinked at such prompts, I heard Gideon's voice.\u201cYou.\u201dBut what hangs on Gideon's face was not the icy expression from earlier.\u201c\u2026Just, who are you?\u201dAnd, there was undeniably \u2018tension\u2019 laying underneath.It can be said that the Empire's strongest knight has now acknowledged me as a 'powerful opponent.'\u2018\u2026Well, not really.\u2019He can literally kill me with just one finger.However, making him react and think like this was already a success.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you?\u201dThat is why, this time, I calmly delivered my words.\u201cI was asked to teach you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI continued speaking to the silent Gideon.\u201cI heard that you have a purpose you want to achieve.\u201dI chose my words carefully.\u201cYou have someone to defeat.\u201dThis time, there was a reaction.Seeing how his brow twitched, he seemed somewhat surprised.The only other person who knew this was the Sword Saint himself.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, the problem is that the person he wants to defeat is a crazy guy who rivals a natural phenomena.This is also why Gideon wants to reach the level of the First Archduke Tristan.The madness that has been passed down through generations in the Tristan Duke Family is all derived from the curse associated with that person. He wants to cut it off.Finally, after a long silence, Gideon opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s something even Master couldn\u2019t do.\u201dThose words bring a smile to my heart.\u201cDo you have confidence that you can do it?\u201dThe strongest knight of the Empire,Is looking to accept \u2018teaching\u2019 from me.So, I sincerely answered.\u201cIt is possible.\u201dGideon\u2019s expression became serious.Yes, it is possible. If you think about how far Elnore's abilities could reach, it is plausible that this person can experience a similar growth.And if that\u2019s the case, he can definitely do it.He can break the family curse.\u2018And if I were to strengthen this side\u2026\u2019It can drastically reduce the likelihood of Elnore's degradation.It is no exaggeration to say that the catalyst for the Gray Devil's resurrection depends on whether this man is dead or alive.\u201cBut.\u201dHowever, who says I'm ending it here?Gideon's expression momentarily froze at my addition.\u201cI haven't said that 'I' will do it for you yet, have I?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI gave the dazed Gideon a broad smile.\u201c\u2026What do you mean\u2026?\u201dGideon asked with an incredulous tone, to which I replied, still smiling.\u201cHonestly, what's in it for me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLet's talk negotiations, shall we?\u201dAjushi.I will do it.But I never said a word about doing it for free.I want compensation.\u25cfI looked down at the sheet of parchment in my hand with a grin.After I made this demand, Gideon was hesitant. But it was completely overturned with my remark, \"So you don't want to learn swordsmanship?\" I can\u2019t help but laugh thinking about it.[ Exemption Writ ][ Item: Special ][ This document delegates the privilege of exemption granted to Archduke Tristan for one instance. ]Being granted the privilege of exemption means that, in short, regardless of the situation, one will never face the judgment of the law.Even for an Archduke like Gideon, possessing such an extraordinary legal authority is enough to cause a sensation.This aligns with the reason why he is assigned as a \"villain.\"\u2018The Empire's Executioner.\u2019Hidden in the background, he takes on all sorts of dirty tasks from the imperial palace.However, although he seems to hold unparalleled power, in the end, he's tied down in a leash by the imperial palace.\u201c\u2026\u201dI couldn't help but sigh when I think of the garbage littering the imperial palace.It would be best if I don't get involved with them.Anyway, obtaining this is a remarkable achievement, even if it's only for 'one time.'\u2018\u2026Midterms are coming up soon, right?\u2019Going through the timeline in my head, it\u2019s about time for the event to happen.An event that marks a pivotal moment and the official start of Chapter 2 in the scenario, involving Saintess Lucien and the Boy King.It is also the time when one of the villains who accounts for a large proportion of the scenario, the \u2018Pope\u2019, makes his entrance.And I'll be there.Making sure that the Boy King and the Pope is screwed over.\u201c\u2026\u201dUm.Originally, doing so would be sprinting to your own death, but the mess will be taken care of by Archduke Tristan, who gave me this document. This is enough.\u2018Oh, one more thing.\u2019Come to think of it, I obtained something else besides this.<Special Gift>Gift #1- Fated Love[ Obtain rewards as you gain favorability of characters with an evil alignment. ]\u25a1 First Enhancement[ The more evil characters acknowledge you, the more rewards you receive. ]\u25bc Related IndividualsCrescent Moon's HasmedRiverback GaldierGideon Galestead La Tristan[ Rewards Available! ]\u2018Gain their acknowledgment?\u2019The meaning is a bit vague, but I can grasp the general nuance.Perhaps the more they feel fear, admiration, or awe towards me, the more rewards I can obtain.So, what's the reward?<System Message>[ \u2018Skill: Guidance\u2019 has been obtained! ]< Skill Info >[ Skill: Guidance ] [ Grade: E ][ If you improve the ability of an evil character, the same ability is added.

Is he currently in his office?\u201d\u201cAh, that bast\u2026 I mean, the Professor is on probation right now, so he\u2019s probably in the Theology School's faculty building. You can try finding him there.\u201d\u201cI see, thank you.\u201dHearing such a response from the faculty member on the way brought a smile to my face.Professor Griver Lanfeld is that guy.The priest affiliated with Marquis Riverback's faction, who intentionally refused to unleash his blessing, when Elnore asked him to, during the commotion at the Freshman Welcome Party.I still remember how people were on the verge of death because of inaction due to his political interest. If I hadn't intervened, Elijah and Elnore would have killed him on the spot.It\u2019s obvious why he\u2019s on probation. With the r evelation of Marquis Riverback's association with devil worshippers, all related individuals are being punished. Naturally, he wouldn't be safe either. His reputation within the academy is in the gutters.\u201c\u2026\u201dA chuckle slipped out of my mouth.In other words.No one would give much care even if something were to happen to him.\u2018It's not like I spared him for no reason.\u2019Now is the time to make full use of him.Albeit, I might be a little rough.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is unlike the magic power or dharma that the chosen are born with. However, that's also why it's difficult to train to be used in practice.\u201dProfessor Griver Lanfeld swallowed the anger boiling from within as he spoke.The atmosphere in the class was a mess, no matter how you look at it.In the first place, there's already not that many people attending. And now, most of them aren't even listening.Even those who had once made efforts to catch his eye and get a good evaluation are now ignoring him without a care.\u2018\u2026If only that bastard wasn\u2019t a devil worshipper.\u2019He gritted his teeth, thinking of Marquis Riverback.Since the Marquis was a young and prosperous businessman, Griver thought that he would be enjoying a sweet filling by using the Marquis. But, in the end, all he got was a damned gangjeong[1].That's right. An empty gangjeong.Griver didn't care whether Marquis Riverback was a devil worshipper or not.The only thing that matters was whether he brings him benefits.In that sense.\u201cUm, I have a question.\u201dGriver wasn't having this person raising his hand.Dowd Campbell.This was the guy who took his emergency tool and erected the barrier during the monster incident.\u201cThen, what is the best way to quickly increase the total amount of divine power and proficiency in blessing?\u201d\u201c\u2026The best way to increase divine power and proficiency is by actually using it.\u201dHe replied in a stern voice.\u201cDon\u2019t ask for the obvious. That\u2019s a very low-level question for an Elfante student.\u201d\u201cYes, my bad.\u201d\u201cDevote yourself to training. I'm ashamed to even listen to that.\u201dAlthough Griver intentionally used such an aggressive language to belittle the other person, the guy was simply smiling without any sign of anger.However.Those eyes weren\u2019t smiling at all.\u201c\u2026\u201dGriver felt a chill run down his spine and averted his gaze.He could clearly feel something weird coming from that side.\u201c\u2026That's it for today's class.\u201dHe didn't really want to spend any more time facing that guy. In that context, he ended the class a bit earlier than usual.Walking along the corridor, Griver thought about the student named Dowd.\u2018\u2026He looks like that person.\u2019A person who has spoken once through Marquis Riverback.A strange person who calls themselves the Prophet.He's never seen their face or anything, but he vividly remembers the chilling impression he felt from them.The eerie sensation he felt from that guy just now is very similar to that.Hell, they might even be the same person.\u2018Well, either way,\u00a0 won't cross paths in the future.\u2019Now in his office, he thought with a smile.Then he took out a letter from the compartment under his desk, which was filled with information he would \u2018sell\u2019.They were all advanced information and secrets he obtained while teaching as a professor at the Academy.\u2018The Empire has always had many enemies.\u2019He would sell this off and then disappear.This could potentially kill people or cause a lot of damage. But it was none of his business.However.\u201cYeah, well. I apologize for interrupting your happy future daydream.\u201dHe suddenly heard a voice close by.At the same time, he felt a strong impact at back of his head.\u201cAren't you being too heartless to choose harm but wishing for yourself to be safe?\u201dIt was a familiar voice.Because it was the same person who he had just seen in class.Dowd Campbell. And the one trampling over his fallen body was Princess Tristan.\u201c\u2026You, what do you think you're doing!? How dare a small dog baron lieeeekk-!\u201dHis words were cut off in a grotesque manner.Elnore\u2019s kick immediately dislocated his arm.\u201c\u2026Hey, Elnore. You're being too aggressive right from the start.\u201dDowd complained, but Elnore only shrugged it off.\u201cIt was just caressing him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCaress?This?Elnore felt the gaze directed at her, but she calmly responded without batting an eye.\u201cI didn't insult him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI'm being very patient.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, anyway.\u201dAfter a few fake coughs, Dowd pulled out a book from his pocket.It was a textbook that contained basic prayers commonly given to new Theology students.\u201c\u2026Wait a minute, so\u2026\u201dAfter reading it for a while with a frown, Dowd finally stammered something out.It was an awkward prayer.\u201c-so warmth may dwell in you. Heal.\u201dThen, a faint white divine power snaked around his arm.\u201c\u2026Hmm, so this is it. I'm getting the hang of it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGriver looked at Dowd, who was proudly speaking, with an incredulous expression.This was a very poor execution of blessing even for a freshman, so what on earth is he so proud of?Alas, as soon as he showed that expression surfaced on his face, Elnore kicked his other arm.\u201cEuuuuukk-!\u201d\u201c\u2026Hey, Elnore. I told you to go slow.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this slow enough?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm, that's strange. The family interrogation training always started by stripping the skin off-\u201d\u201cYou! What do you want, whaaaaargh!\u201dAs Griver said that through tears, Dowd replied with a cough.\u201cWell, since we both know, let's make it quick and easy. Who in the academy were you trying to sell this information?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGriver suddenly stopped his struggles despite the intense pain.This was something he couldn\u2019t give up.The existence of the seed planted by the Prophet hiding inside the academy.Because he knows that if he reveals this, he would never be safe.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking aboaaaaakk-!\u201dThis time, he couldn\u2019t even finish his sentence before his left leg got crushed.At this point, Dowd gave up in going slow and just held his head with a sigh.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you! I\u2019ll tell you anything, so please-!\u201dIn the end, while shedding tears and saliva, Griver revealed the names of those involved one by one.Beside him, Dowd was jotting down every detail with a hmm, hmm.\u201cIs that all?\u201d\u201cAll, that\u2019s all\u2026! Please, call a doctor\u2026!\u201dGriver begged in a completely hoarse voice.\u2018At least he's better than this monster\u2026!\u2019Griver felt somewhat relieved that he could rely on this man, who, unlike the Princess who would break his limbs at any given opportunity, was more humane.However, Dowd smirked and shook his head.\u201cEh, why bother with a doctor? I can treat you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI am an aspiring Theology student. I know how to use blessings.\u201dYou can't become a student at Elfante with such low-level skills, right?After adding that with a grin, Dowd stammering, recited another prayer.Thanks to his abyssmal use of divine power and the level of his healing magic, it took a while before Griver's broken limbs fully recovered.\u201cHeo-euk\u2026 hee-euk\u2026\u201dGriver took a deep breath and barely managed to stand up.His whole body was drenched in cold sweat, but at least he could move his limbs again.As Griver struggled to stand, he silently vowed to himself.\u2018\u2026I\u2019ll kill you bastards\u2026!\u2019However, he had no way to do it now.He needed to leave this place first, then prepare and find a way to kill these two.\u201c\u2026Th, then now. Is this enough?\u201dHe said with a servile smile, while Dowd smiled and nodded.\u201cYes, for now.\u201dThat's right.Griver grinned inwardly and staggered back.He'll make sure they'll regret letting him live here\u2026-!\u201cEoouuuukkk-!\u201dGriver, who was about to leave the room, collapsed on the floor again.Princess Tristan broke his right leg from behind.Griver screamed in agony as he crawled on the floor.\u201cWhy, why are you doing this!? I told you everything!\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s.\u201dAs Griver crawled, Dowd approached him again and cast a healing spell on him. It was a healing spell with slightly more proficiency than before.During this exchange, Griver's gaze met Dowd's eyes.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was at this moment.Griver realized that he had severely misunderstood something.That is.He thought that this man was, at least, better than Princess Tristan.\u201cDidn't you say it earlier? The best way to master divine power and blessings is to continuously use them.\u201dThere's that weird feeling again.The horrifying sensation that he felt from the Prophet.\u201cYou are someone whom I can torment without feeling guilty. I can\u2019t possibly miss such a good training method, can I?\u201dThere's a greater fear felt from those who treat others not as a 'human', but only as a \u2018means\u2019 to an end.\u201cBeginner blessing is usually focus on protecting and healing others. So.\u201dThis man, right now.\u201cYou will keep torturing me?\u201dHe doesn't even see him as a fellow human being!\u201cThat's the only way for me to practice.\u201dDowd's words dawned over Griver\u2019s pale blue face.In no time. Again.Sounds of bones breaking and painful screams echoed within the office.\u25cfCompletely unconscious, Griver was handed over to the internal knights. They will take care of the rest.And on the way out, I went through the system prompts in front of my eyes.<System Message>[ Confirmed rapid proficiency in \u2018Beginner Blessing'. ][ \u2018Attribute: Divine Power Manipulation\u2019 has been unlocked! ]<System Message>[ The Epic Grade Item \u2018Soul Linker\u2019 resonates with your divine power! ]<System Message>[ Checking the current condition of the target \u2018Elnore\u2019. ][ The unique debuff \u2018Madness\u2019 has been improved under your influence. ]I guess you could call this, \u201cthree birds, one stone.\u201dThis is what I got from torturing and healing a worthless human trash over and over again, and the outcome is more than satisfying. It's quite lucrative, I must say.Moreover, I obtained the most crucial attribute, Divine Power Manipulation, which is a significant achievement.With this, I have gained an ability that I can independently utilize, like magic power or dharma.Of course, it is still very weak, but the difference between none and one is like night and day.\u2018\u2026Now, with this.\u2019I looked at the amulet on my wrist.Until now, growth was impossible, but now that I possess the Divine Power Manipulation attribute, I can awaken the soul inside on my own.\u201c\u2026Have you relieved your stress?\u201dAnd finally, this woman.Managing Elnore's mental state is always important.I will definitely need her assistance in the upcoming midterm exams.\u201cEum.\u201dElnore replied with an expressionless expression that somehow looked much more refreshed than usual.Having been with her quite often as of late, I can somewhat read her aura even though she's expressionless. It\u2019s fascinating.\u201c\u2026Is there something troubling you?\u201dThat\u2019s why I can say things like this.Although she appears refreshed, I can feel that there's also a shadow cast over her. It's as if she's worried.\u201c\u2026\u201dAs expected, upon hearing that, Elnore swallowed for a moment. But she didn't deny it.It seems to be quite difficult for her to express it.\u201c\u2026Dowd.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI heard you met Archduke Tristan.\u201dNot 'Father', but Archduke Tristan.This clearly shows their broken family relationship.With a bitter smile inside, Elnore continued with difficulty.\u201cHe must have done something terrible to you.\u201d\u201cSomething terrible?\u201d\u201cIf it's that person, he would definitely think it's a waste of time for me to interact with anyone.\u201dAh, that's true.Even in terms of the setting itself, Gideon have always despised such interactions.Because of this, Elnore\u2019s relationship pool is extremely narrow. Unless it\u2019s someone like Beatrix, who's her friend for 10 years.\u2018\u2026It's all because of a reason.\u2019I can't explain it here.It's a story that will be revealed later in conjunction with the main scenario.\u201cHe didn\u2019t really do anything like that. But it was a little scary.\u201dWell, if I had failed with my lies, I could have died right there on the spot.I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t scared.\u201cBut well, I somehow managed to resolve it. I think I'll continue to see him in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026What, you'll continue seeing each other?\u201dHearing Elnore ask such a question, I simply answered with a shrug.\u201cYes, well. He is an important person to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Important? To you? That person? Why?\u201dElnore said in an incredulous voice.Uh.

You can partially share the buffs you have to nearby allies. ]\u201c\u2026\u201dSharing buffs\u2026 is possible?Does that even make sense?Of course, there's a caveat especially with the term 'partially,' implying that the full extent of the buffs may not be transferred. However, there are no restrictions on the number of individuals or the grade of the buff that can be shared.And it is limited within the range of the domain.\u2018About a few meters.\u2019At the very least, it's at a range where it can be effectively utilized in close combat.Though, the fact that the recipient of this skill is a trash with an All-F stat, and heavily relies on ridiculous buff skills to resolve situations, couldn't be more perfect.\u2018\u2026It was a good decision to get it quickly.\u2019Yes, really.It\u2019s not an epic item for nothing. To think that I got such a crazy skill this early.As I was thinking so, the spiritual body fully materialized in front of me.A visor covering the face and a full-body plate armor. But what stood out the most was the lion's head emblem engraved on the breastplate.It's the standard equipment of the Imperial Guards.They are considered the strongest unified force in the continent.The difference between an ordinary person and a regular knight is often compared to that between a newborn baby and an adult.And the difference between a regular knight and an Imperial Guard is depicted in a similar significant gap.And among the Imperial Guards, there are those who wear the 'Lion Breastplate.'They are behemoths who stand at the pinnacle even among such monsters.\u2018Guardians.\u2019A group comprised of only the strongest knights of the era.They were a group that was a close match to Gideon, who is currently hailed as the strongest in the Empire.Hence why, they're treated in such a high regard.They were the ones who got deployed during the 'Crimson Night,' the incident that swept away Elijah's family, and ultimately decapitated the main instigator.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt's such an unbelievable achievement, that it's surreal.As seen in the boss battle against the Purifier, devil energy itself summons creatures from the Pandemonium to the material realm. Especially if several fragments were gathered at the same time.And yet, against someone who could summon thousands of demons with a single gesture, a few dozen people, who were urgently deployed, successfully dealt with the situation.So, any one of them deserves to be called a hero.However.I think I know who this is.\u201c\u2026Nice to meet you, Guardian.\u201dUpon hearing my words, the knight's gaze slowly turned towards me.[Who are you? Where is this?]The spiritual body's voice echoed inside the Image World.As expected, it was the voice of a young man. It has the same feel from someone I know.For a human to become a spirit, they cannot simply be great.There has to be a \"lingering attachment.\"It's like having an unfulfilled goal that they couldn't achieve before death, preventing them from closing their eyes even in death. Something along those lines.And among the deceased Guardians, there is only one person who would carry such sentiments.\u201cI have heard many things about you.\u201d[\u2026What?]It's true.Not just in game knowledge, but also from someone else.\u201cNice to meet you, Caliban.\u201dThe spiritual body's movement came to an abrupt halt.Caliban Krisanax.Granted with the title the 'Knight of Dawn.' The strongest and last Guardian. Even on a low estimate, he possesses combat power on par with a top expert like Gideon.A key figure in Chapter 4.And.\u201cNot long ago, your sister said that we look alike.\u201dHe is the older brother of the hero candidate, Elijah.\u25cf<System Message>[ Checking the current condition of target 'Elijah'. ][ Current favorability level below 'Trust'. Confirmation of contact with target 'Caliban'. ][ When favorability reaches 'Trust', an Exclusive Quest will be unlocked. ]<System Message>[ \u2018Heretic Inquisition \u2019 is starting to take an interest in you! ]I read through all the messages that popped up.Caliban Krisanax plays a significant role in Elijah's growth in the main story.He remains the object of Elijah's admiration, and also, the fact that Caliban is her last surviving family member has driven her to desperately seek his whereabouts.\u2018\u2026But, you can see for yourself whether he is alive or not.\u2019If he was alive, he wouldn\u2019t have become a spiritual body.In the story's progression, when Elijah eventually learned of her older brother's death, she went through a tremendous emotional shock. However, she ultimately overcame this and bloomed into a true hero.The information the player is given about Caliban is quite fragmentary. Unlike Gideon, who is still alive at the beginning of the scenario, Caliban passed away long ago.So, there are some pieces of information that even I didn't know.[Iya, the memories are flooding back. Even after all this time, nothing has changed, huh?]\u201c\u2026\u201d[Ah, when did I start school again\u2026]This guy is more of a chatterbox than one might initially think.\u201c\u2026You've been resurrected as a spirit, aren\u2019t you shocked by the current situation?\u201dAs I whispered that to the amulet, a giggling voice echoed in my head.[With my memories, I am well aware of the situation I am in. But what's the use of denying reality? Rather than that, isn't it better to quickly adapt?]That's right. And as you can see, he's very good in adapting.He even accepted my \u2018request for cooperation\u2019 without much fuss, saying that he was in no position to refuse given the circumstances.As long as it's not blatantly wrong, he promised to cooperate with anything. All of which was arranged in less than an hour prior to his awakening.[Well, I don\u2019t have a choice anyway. Won't I have to do everything you tell me from now on?]He even left such a comment.It felt like a slave signing a contract with the tone of \"I'd prefer meat for dinner.\"\u201c\u2026\u201dI guess this just comes packaged with good adaptability.As expected of the strongest man among the Guardians. His mental is nowhere near ordinary.[Well, I have conditions though.]The voice within the amulet momentarily softened.He seems to have suppressed an emotional reaction.But he soon went back to as cheerful as ever.[You can\u2019t talk about me to Elijah, unless I say so. Promise me that, alright?]\u201c\u2026Yes, I promise.\u201dI know why.The fact where Elijah knows about his life or death is itself\u2026 \u2018danger\u2019.In the game, when Caliban's soul awakened, events were triggered for both Elijah and the \"Heretic Inquisition,\" which is known as the most ruthless organization in the Empire.There's a reason why it occurred.\u2018\u2026Not unless he says so.\u2019Recalling what happened, I stroked my chin in ponder.I think I have a rough idea on when that time is.The content related to this person and Elijah is the main quest of Chapter 4. The search for the Holy Sword's owner.After that, Elijah\u2019s fighting power would skyrocket to a level where she could face the demons in earnest.\u2018\u2026But I have to deal with the Heretic Inquisition.\u2019Just thinking about the recent system message makes me feel that way.I really don't want to get involved with those people. But perhaps it\u2019s better to think that, sooner or later, we'll be seeing each other face-to-face.I inwardly let out a sigh, meanwhile amidst my thoughts, dormitory supervisor, Madam Ophelia, clapped her hands and drew the attention of the freshmen gathered in the auditorium.\u201cSo, you all know why we're here, right? It'll be the midterms soon-\u201cMadam Ophelia's melodramatic voice prompted cries and sighs from various places in the room.But then again, who in the world likes exams?This is especially so considering the strictness of Elfante\u2019s regular exam.\u201cAlthough there's still many of you who had yet to choose a major, everyone takes the midterm exam fairly.\u201dThe regular exams for freshmen who don't have majors are always conducted in a similar format.The Great Plains Survival.Students are placed on a massive stage and engaged in team battles.After all, the main enemies officially defined by the Empire are monsters, demons and devil worshippers. Since Elfante itself is an institution established with the purpose of countering such threats, combat ability is naturally an important factor.The Knights School's popularity wasn't for no reason.\u201cA survival team will consist of a maximum of four members. Choose your teammates wisely, as you'll be together for two days-\u201dIn fact, the reason why everyone was gathered in this auditorium was to form teams.Of course, I could do it alone, and it wouldn't matter. The difficulty might increase, but so is the points.However, I don't intend to proceed that way.This midterm exam is an extremely important event.It\u2019s not just because it\u2019s a test, but also because of the events that happen in between.\u2018Saintess Lucien, the Boy King and the Pope.\u2019These three individuals are involved in the events simultaneously.It simply can't be considered unimportant.Therefore, I have to form a team best suited for the situation at hand.\u2018For the team formation\u2026\u2019First of all, Elnore is out of the picture.No matter what, it's unreasonable for the Student Council President to meddle in the freshmen's exam.She has a separate \"role\" to fulfill.So, the first person I need to recruit is...\u201cExcuse me.\u201dAs I approached Elijah, who was chatting lively with her friends, the surroundings suddenly fell silent.Everyone was gathered here.Luca. Falco. Grid. Trisha. The hero party members.\u201c\u2026\u201dOriginally, I would have let Elijah continue on with these guys, but I need her this time.\u201c\u2026I'm sorry, but would it be okay if I take her with me for the midterm exam?\u201dHearing this, everyone's face was blank.They exchanged glances with each other, clearly taken aback by the request.\u2018\u2026Was I too sudden?\u2019From their perspective, they were just having a good time with their friends, when suddenly some random guy appeared out of nowhere and tries to take one of them away.It\u2019s only natural to be stunned.\u201cGood for you, Elijah!\u201d\u201cI knew it would turn out like this! You always talk about it!\u201d\u201cAh yes! Take her with you! Please, feel free!\u201dLuca, Grid, and Falco all said so excitedly, as they patted Elijah\u2019s back.It felt like they were genuinely celebrating a good news that happened to their friend.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat's up with this atmosphere?\u201c\u2026Um, is this something worth celebrating?\u201dWhen I cautiously asked that, Mage Falco swept his nose and replied.\u201cNo, Elijah has been singing songs about wanting to take the midterm exam with you. She probably felt threatened seeing you constantly around the Student Council President. This time she said she wanted to do something toge-\u201dBut he was cut off by a fist being lodged in his face.Seeing him collapse like a puppet with no strings, he probably fainted in one hit.\u201cAh, um, the teacher recommended it, so it's a big deal! Yes!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWith a still-clenched fist, Elijah said so in a slightly brash tone.Her face was a bit flushed, and her breathing was rapid.\u201c\u2026Are you okay?\u201dIsn't she overdoing it a bit?She doesn't seem to be in a normal state.With that doubt in mind, I asked Elijah. She rolled her eyes while scratching the back of her head.\u201cYes, I'm okay! Of course! Ha, haha!\u201d\u201c\u2026No, seriously, she received an invitation from the guy she cares a lot of, she couldn't be more-\u201cAs Sniper Grid was saying this, he too received Elijah's fist. Watching from the side, Warrior Luca admired the clean execution of the move.It seems like he also fainted instantly, falling straight to the ground.\u201cReally, I\u2019m fine! I'm okay!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, let's get out of here for now! Before we hear any more nonsense!\u201dGood, she seems okay.Leaving this place is a good suggestion as well.[\u2026What is your relationship with my sister?]Caliban's bewildered voice sounded from the amulet, I ignored it and instead turned to Elijah.\u201cUn, that's good. But we have one more stop.\u201d\u201cYes? Where to?\u201d\u201cWe're forming a team. We need one more person.\u201dTo be precise, we needed someone related to Saintess Lucien.\u201c\u2026\u201dHonestly, having them involved in this event is the worst case.But there's no choice.\u201cElijah.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHave you heard of the equipment room?\u201dThat is why.It's time for the monumental debut of the one and only Swordmaster-nim.\u25cf\u201c\u2026So, this regular delegation consists of Saintess Lucien Greyhounder and her escort knight. Thank you for graciously permitting this, President.\u201d\u201cYou're too kind, Your Holiness.\u201dAt first glance, this was just a friendly conversation.In fact, Atallante had a polite expression on her face as she faced the man behind the long-distance communication magic orb.However, inside, she was fervently grinding the other person to the ground.Thoughts that between educated intellectuals, could get one kicked out.\u2018As if you didn't just threaten to stab Elfante if I didn\u2019t give permission.\u2019What a disgusting human.Atallante\u2019s evaluation of the Pope could be summed up in one sentence.Saint Credo Paul II. The current Pope.A sly individual who would casually stab people in the back with a smile on his face.He's a repulsive snake that treat people lesser than worms under the guise of being the leader of the greatest and largest religious group on the continent.Furthermore, his divine power surpassed the current era's strongest, reaching a level that contends with the mightiest in history.\u2018What is he thinking sending the Saintess here?\u2019Most of the talents gathering in Elfante were individuals with his influence, especially those suspected of being devil\u2019s vessel candidates.Saintess Lucien was one of them, but even Atallante couldn't fathom the true intention behind this move.The Saintess. A religious symbol of the Empire and Holy Land.Handing over such an individual to the Empire without any hesitation was a striking, and strange decision.He was demanding to make it happen \u2018as soon as possible\u2019 and even threatened just to ensure the Saintess gets into the academy.He definitely has something planned behind his back.\u201cShowing gratitude with empty hands is meaningless. So I wish to offer a small favor to the President.\u201dHis next words naturally followed that context.\u201cElfante is currently in the middle of its midterms, isn't it?\u201dAtallante\u2019s expression twisted slightly.\u2018\u2026The midterms?\u2019What reason could a figure as significant as the Pope have to concern himself with the students' affairs?Especially with something as insignificant as midterm exams.The difference in scale is too vast that it's impossible to guess what his intentions are.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right. However, it is entirely an internal event within the academy, Your Holiness. You don't need to concern yourself with such insignificant matters-\u201c\u201cNo.\u201dThe Pope cut her off in a clear voice.\u201cGive Lucien a task, President.\u201dBut unlike his voice...\u201cShe will undoubtedly be of help.\u201dHis gaze was venomous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Meanwhile, the person who elicited such a reaction nodded nonchalantly.\u201cYes. The agreement between the Holy Land and Elfante has already been made.\u201dElnore scanned through the documents handed to her with a puzzled expression.But Atlante's signature is clearly written at the bottom.\u2018The President is not one to agree with this madness.\u2019As she was in deep ponder, she heard the other party's voice again.\u201cIs there any problem?\u201dKlein Garrison, the battle priest of the Holy Land, wearing such a nameplate, brightly smiled and asked.A battle priest wearing purple epaulettes is someone of authority and power comparable to that of a platoon leader among regular knights of the Empire.To think that such a high-ranking individual would be sent as a mere representative of a delegation.This made the topic he presented even more shocking.\u201cAre you saying that the Saintess would do such a thing? This is too-\u201dInhumane.It's hard to believe that this was proposed by a religious group.\u201cStudent Council President.\u201dHis tone sounded polite.But underlying this facade is a hidden wicked.\u201cThe Saintess \u2018voluntered\u2019 herself. Is something wrong with it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWho in the world would volunteer for such a thing?Rather than that, it would be much more fitting to say that \u2018she's forced to volunteer\u2019.Suddenly, what Dowd said the other day passed through her mind.\u2018The Holy Land will probably make ridiculous demands. I don't know the details, but it's a place filled with crazy people, starting with the Pope.\u2019When she first heard it, she couldn't believe such sacrilegious words.Treating the continent's largest religious group as villains?However, now that she was faced with it directly, she couldn't help but have doubts.Only madmen would make such demands.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cStudent Council President? This matter has already been decided, so please-\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dBeing urged, Elnore, who had her eyes closed in contemplation of Dowd\u2019s words, finally gave her stamp and returned the documents.The other party, who had been preparing to threaten her if their demands were not met, was taken aback when Elnore complied just like that.\u201cIs there anymore? I've already dealt with it as you wished.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dThe battle priest, with a dubious expression, scanned Elnore from top to bottom before finally nodding and leaving the Student Council Office.Though they had made the request themselves, it seemed like they were surprised at how easily she accepted it. Elnore smiled and stood up from her seat.The exam was approaching, and as the Student Council President, she's also a proctor. She needed to quickly make her way to the exam venue.\u201c\u2026\u201dThoughts were floating around her head.It was an undeniably strange proposal. Her usual self would never have accepted it.Perhaps.\u2018Let it pass, no matter what they ask for.\u2019Even if someone didn't say it, it probably would have ended the same.\u2018Is it so I can act without guilt?\u2019With that thought in mind, Elnore let out another smirk and gripped her sword.That man is clearly up to something again.Already seeing through that the Holy Land is planning to do something in Elfante.Then.All she needs to do...-Because he's your family.\u201c\u2026\u201dElnore suddenly paused, remembering those words.\u201c\u2026If I hear words like that, I can't help but follow.\u201dAnyway, he's a cunning man.Family, family...That, should be.It must be that.Hmm.While not entirely certain, nothing else came to mind.\u2018\u2026I might start making preparations.\u2019As Elnore entertained such thoughts, she met eyes with Beatrix, who was entering the office.\u201cWhat's up? Going to prepare for the exam?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJust as they passed each other, Elnore suddenly turned back to Beatrix as if something had crossed her mind.\u201cOh, right. Beatrix.\u201d\u201cYeah? What is it?\u201d\u201cWhere should I go get fitted with a ring?\u201d\u201cRing? What ring?\u201d\u201c\u2026The thing that a man and woman give each other as a token of promise.\u201dBeatrix, who was in the middle of moving documents, fell on her place.\u25cfYesterday for Yuria Greyhounder was nothing short of hell.\u2018Why didn\u2019t he come today?\u2019As soon as she woke up in the morning and realized there was no one beside her, that was the first thought that crossed her mind.It was strange. That person would always come in the morning and spar with her without fail.\u2018\u2026He's probably busy.\u2019Regardless of anything, that's the most reasonable conclusion. He doesn't live in isolation like herself, naturally he has a life of his own.After all, he's someone whom even President Atallante personally cared for and managed.\u201c\u2026\u201dShe knew that thinking that way was the rational thing to do, more so than anyone else.However, if the human mind was so easily controlled, then everyone in the world would be living without any worries or anxieties.\u2018\u2026But what if he's not busy?\u2019Sinister thoughts always have a way of creeping their way in, and firmly taking root.\u2018What if he\u2019s just tired of me?\u2019The hand that was washing clothes in the nearby stream stopped abruptly.Her face was reflected in the cold summer water.But what she saw was a scruffy woman.A shabby person far removed from the dazzling and glittering students of the prestigious academy that she could only view from the window.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe corners of her eyes drooped, as a gloomy expression spread across her face.Once the negative thoughts started rolling, there was no stopping it.\u2018\u2026I\u2019m sure he\u2019s fed up.\u2019After all, who would want to be close to someone who'd start slicing you down as soon as you approach them. What reason would you have to get close to a mute living a primitive life day after day, hardly better than a savage?Right, that's probably it.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, even before falling asleep, she couldn't completely let go of the hope that maybe, just maybe, he would come tomorrow morning.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever.Even when the next day came, the man was still nowhere to be seen.\u2018\u2026As expected.\u2019He's tired of her.There was no reason for him to bother himself with an insignificant person like Yuria Greyhounder.\u201c\u2026\u201dEven though she never expected to become friends from the beginning.Yeah, that's right, it was supposed to be like this from the beginning. She's just a fool for being excited at nothing.She will be alone until her death.And as soon as she realized that.\u201c\u2026Uu.\u201dBeads of tears started flowing down her cheeks.\u201cUu, uueu, heueuk\u2026\u201dThe Curse of Severance prevented her from forming coherent sentences.However, she couldn't suppress the sobbing sound that flowed from her tightly closed lips.It hurt.Strangely, her heart felt hurt.She longed to have even a trivial conversation with someone, to break free from her prolonged isolation.If it hurts this much, you shouldn't have come.What is the point of giving and then taking it away?If only she had known.Just like a blink of an eye.To suddenly come into her life, take a place in her heart, and then suddenly disappear.\u2018\u2026I\u2019ll do better.\u2019Such an oath, that she didn\u2019t even know who it's for, escaped from her lips.\u2018I won\u2019t bother you, I promise. I\u2019ll do anything you ask.\u2019She didn\u2019t even know what she's saying right now.Amidst her endless sobbing, only such sentences filled her mind.\u2018Just one more time, please show up.\u2019This time, for sure.I won\u2019t miss it.Please.Anyone, help me.-Sure.It was then that a giggling voice echoed in her head.-You called me first, didn't you?It was an ominous voice that sent chills down her spine.At this, Yuria momentarily halted her tears and hesitated.\u2018\u2026Just now, what was that?\u2019Clearly, something had changed within her. She felt that way.However, she didn't quite understand what it was.While she was lost in thought...\u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201dThis sudden question made Yuria twist in surprise, as she turned to the side.\u201cWhy are you crying? Did anything happen while I was gone?\u201dAnd there he was.A masked man casually asking her.\u201c-\u2026-!!!\u201dBut Yuria cried even louder.Though it held a slightly different meaning than before.\u25cfIn fact, taking Yuria to the midterm exam carries a lot of risk.First of all, no one is allowed within a three-foot radius of her, and considering her status as a 'thief' who stole the Holy Land's national treasure, it's almost certain that there will be friction if she appears in the midterm exam and gets seen by the Saintess or someone from the Holy Land.That is why, I mentioned nothing about this with Atallante. She's definitely going to oppose of the idea. It's just dangerous.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, there is a reason why I must take this guy with us.First of all, clearing Chapter 2 heavily depends on curing the Curse of Severance.It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that how fast you accomplish this determines whether you clear the chapter or not.The time limit is at most 5 days from today.\u2018And\u2026\u2019If only I can somehow make contact with the Saintess before Chapter 2 begins in earnest...The difficulty level can be drastically lowered.\u2018The Greyhounder Sisters.\u2019Apotropaic sisters who were artificially created by the Pope, forcibly manipulated to amplify divine power while suppressing all other abilities.The Holy Land's national treasure that this guy possesses should have originally belonged to the Saintess.The reason why she stole and escaped with it is also related to that.\u2018\u2026Anyway, the Saintess and Yuria must meet each other at least once.\u2019And the timing for that is just about the midterm exam.Befitting her reputation, the Saintess is always surrounded by the Holy Land's people. And for one reason and another, this is the only time when the net becomes lax.If my memory serves me right, this should be it.As long as the worst possible variable I have in mind don't come into play.\u201c\u2026\u201dAlbeit a low probability.But if that variable pops out, the difficulty of Chapter 2 will skyrocket to unimaginable levels.The way you treat Yuria will be completely different.But other than that, it\u2019s a pretty solid plan.<System Message>[ \u2018Skill: Fatal Charm\u2019 has been activated! ][ The favorability of the target \u2018Yuria Greyhounder\u2019 has increased significantly! ][ Favorability level has been upgraded from \u2018Interest Level 1\u2019 to \u2018Interest Level 2\u2019! ][ Rewards Available! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dSomehow, as soon as I saw this gal, it feels like my predictions went off track.As I scan the notification in front of me, I can't help but break into a cold sweat.No, this isn't like what happened with Elnore where I know I did something wrong. Unlike her, I really have no idea how things are unfolding for Yuria. I don't understand why this message is popping up at all.\u201c\u2026Uh. Here. Blow your nose. Hmm.\u201dI hung a piece of cloth on a wooden stick and slowly extended it to her side. If I go there myself, I'll get my ass stabbed instantly.\u201cSo, you weren't in trouble or anything. You cried because you were happy to see me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYuria just nodded without saying a word.The movement was so violent that it makes a buzzing sound.\u201c\u2026I couldn\u2019t come yesterday because I was busy with other things. It's not because of any specific reason.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe started sniffling again, as she wiped away her tears with a piece of cloth.The look in her eyes seemed to ask, \"Really?\"\u201cReally.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOnly then did Yuria stop sobbing. She blew her nose with the cloth I handed over and took a deep breath to compose herself.How could things have escalated to this point just because I didn't visit for a day?She's been living alone for a long time, and loneliness can drive anyone crazy.\u201c\u2026\u201dI felt sorry asking this to a kid like this, but.Time is running out.The exam starts tomorrow.\u201c\u2026Hey, I have a favor to ask-\u201c[I\u2019ll do it!]Seeing the glowing characters made of divine power appear before my eyes, I was speechless.She's almost shouting it out.[I\u2019ll do anything, anything at all! Just leave it to me!]I was taken aback by her almost-desperate insistence.No.Is this what her character was like all along?She was always a bit timid, cautious of others, and afraid of losing connections.But now, should I say...It's like she's desperately trying not to be abandoned by me.\u201c\u2026It involves going outside. Are you okay with that?\u201d[I'm okay!]Even though it pertains to going \"outside\", that normally evoke her fear, she just accepted it without any hesitation.Clearly, something is off.I tried to continue speaking to calm her down a bit.\u201cWell, there's no need to push yourself too hard. If you're uncomfortable, I can ask someone else-\u201dBut as soon as I said that, a chill ran down my spine.Even before my sentence had finished, the light in Yuria's eyes disappeared.[\u2026You, do you hate me now?]Right now, I\u2019m keeping a safe distance from her, more than four steps away.[Is there any reason? I, really, well, I'll do anything, so please tell me-]And yet.[ A moment of danger has been detected. ][ Determined the situation as life-threatening. ][ Skill: Desperation raised to EX Grade. ]Something like this popping out of nowhere made me think of only one possibility.And the \u2018white\u2019 aura emanating from her \u2018sword\u2019 got me all the more certain.In general, the color associated with all curse-related items is 'black.'The same goes for her sword attributed with the Curse of Severance. It would emit a black aura whenever she fully wields it.But the fact that it's producing a white aura meant only one thing.\u2018\u2026Devil.\u2019As I mentioned before, where and how the devil fragments permeate is purely random.It can attach itself to people or objects alike.And even a \u2018devil fragment\u2019 attaching itself to the Holy Land's national treasure.The White Devil Fragment.Known for having the strongest \u2018obsession\u2019 among all devils.And due to some unknown damn 'conditions' triggering, there's a situation where Yuria awakens as a 'vessel.'\u2018\u2026I'm fcked.\u2019If this happens, the clear method becomes extremely narrow.When the game route gets all tangled up like this, some people would just suggest to do a complete reset on the run.Why?\u2018They who awaken as vessels begins to be influenced by the devil.\u2019As you can tell by looking at Elnore, those who have awakened, even once, as a vessel are going to be influenced.Initially, the effect might only manifest in enhanced physical abilities, but soon various other influences will follow.The problem is that the 'influence' of the White Devil spreads rapidly and forcefully to the vessel.[Why aren't you answering?]<System Message>[ The favorability of the target \u2018Yuria Greyhounder\u2019 has increased! ][ Favorability level has been upgraded from \u2018Interest Level 2\u2019 to \u2018Interest Level 3\u2019! ][ Rewards Available! ]\"Fatal Charm\" didn't activate.

She's obviously not in the right state of mind.If I hadn\u2019t backed away, I would have entered her three-step range.Even now, the Curse of Severance is still in effect.

In fact, it's because of many things.Just yesterday, everything was normal and now I'm wearing a mask.Not to mention that I brought along a companion, who doesn't say a word and only communicates through floating text. She's also being forbidden not to approach within three steps of said companion.And worst of all.\u201cYou're into that?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cReally, no.\u201dElijah was judgingly staring at the \u2018leash\u2019 I was holding in my hand.I totally understand the slight disdain in her eyes, considering that the leash was attached to Yuria's neck.\u201c\u2026There's a reason for this.\u201d\u201cPlease, do tell. What kind of reason would there be to warrant a leash on a grown woman and dragging her around? I'm really curious.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNo, there really is a reason.In the first place, I didn't suggest any of this.[That, I, I was the one who suggested that we go around like this\u2026]As Yuria replied with her floating text, Elijah's look of bewilderment became even more pronounced.However, there's no other option.\u2018If I don\u2019t do this, her mental degradation will get worse\u2026\u2019Although I successfully managed to calm her down after going berserk due to the Devil Fragment's influence, afterward, she developed an irrational fear of being separated from me.She even went as far as recommending to put her on a leash so that \u2018we'll be together wherever I go\u2019.\u201c\u2026\u201dUh. I\u2019m scared too.I could feel my dignity as a human being getting stripped away with every step.But looking at the awakening conditions of the Gray Devil inside Elnore, it's evident that it closely relates to the vessel's mental state.And right now, Yuria's mental state is on the brink of extremity. If she's triggered even in the slightest, the devil fragment would manifest itself right then and there.With the existence of the Fatal Charm skill, it's unlikely that I'll be harmed, but considering the White Devil's 'power,' just one manifestation could have a fatal impact on Chapter 2 as a whole.And if the main quest in Chapter 2 fails, it's game over. It's a death sentence.\u201c\u2026\u201dThis means that I have to follow through this, whether I like it or not.\u2018\u2026At least until I meet the Saintess.\u2019The symptoms should ease a bit if I contact the Saintess who's currently in the examination venue.Given Yuria and Lucien's \u2018relationship\u2019, it can only be like that.Curing the Curse of Severance within 5 days is just the beginning.\u201c\u2026Why did you even ask for this?\u201dWhile I was in my thoughts, Elijah asked Yuria.Well, I have prepared an excuse for situations like this.Simply omit the \u2018how\u2019 of the Curse of Severance and briefly explain its effects. Basically, if someone gets within three steps, they die.The leash is precisely tailored to that distance. Saying that it's to manage the curse is enough.[\u2026That.]Yuria, who had been fiddling with the leash for a while now, wrote out with a flushed face.[I feel relaxed this way, so we agreed to go around like this.]\u201c\u2026\u201d[Yes, being like this makes me feel much more at ease and secure\u2026]I break out in a cold sweat when I saw Elijah's angry expression.Why would you say it like that\u2026!\u201c\u2026She doesn\u2019t mean it like that, uh, can you explain another way?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElijah kept her mouth shut as she looked at me and Yuria.For me, it was a terrifyingly long moment.\u201cWouldn\u2019t Princess Tristan throw a fit if she saw this?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don't think so.\u201dThere's a good chance she's waiting at the 'Sanctuary,' the final point of the exam, due to my request.At least until this event is over, it's highly unlikely she'll see this.\u201c\u2026Really?\u201dSaying that, Elijah crossed her arms and began to ponder something deeply, still looking at us.\u201c\u2026She won\u2019t see it.\u201dThen she looked to contemplate further.As she pondered, she kept showing odd signs. Her legs fidgeting or her face turning red.She also mumbled strange things to herself. Like, \"No matter what, that's...\" or \"Still, I need to do something to get... Interested to me...\"\u201c\u2026Are you busy?\u201d\u201cJust give me a moment, like 5 minutes.

It's not bad at all.If I pair it with the skill I received from Yuria, \u2018Swordsman\u2019s Focus\u2019, it will be much easier to time the parry.And the other one\u2026[ Received gift rewards from \u2018Yuria\u2019. ][ Obtained 1x \u2018Skill Copy Ticket\u2019. ]\u2026This.It's the same reward from when Elnore\u2019s favorability soared in a short period of time.\u2018I should keep this for now.\u2019As it was back then, this would be much more valuable to put aside for now than to use it right away.\u2018\u2026I don't want to use it like before.\u2019I picked up a skill when Elnore manifested the Gray Devil, but I don't want to do the same with the White Devil.It's just, um.It's annoying if it manifests itself.There's a reason why it's the \u2018Obsession Devil\u2019.\u201c\u2026Alright, it's decided.\u201dWhile lost in my thoughts, Elijah seemed to have finally organized her ideas and approached me, tapping her cheeks.And then...\u201cYap.\u201dShe grabbed my hand with both of hers.\u201c\u2026This is my limit. I can compromise this much. We'll continue like this until the end of the exam.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe continued holding my hand as she uttered those words.Her face and ears were red.\u201c\u2026Mr., please say something.\u201dNo.What am I supposed to say?\u201c\u2026Why are you looking at me like that, don't tell me you also want me to wear a leash?!\u201dI couldn't even respond yet.What do you think I am\u2026?\u201c\u2026Do as you please.\u201dI couldn't be bothered to answer, so I left her alone and took out a map instead.\u2018The goal is\u2026\u2019First, get to the sanctuary. There's a high chance that the Saintess is there. Once we bring Yuria inside, it'll most likely trigger an \"essential event\".And the second thing.\u201c\u2026\u201dI smirked at the status window.The newly acquired attributes and the other abilities that I can obtain by nurturing them are looking shiny.\u2018It'll be a feast.\u2019Of course, developing them requires time and diligence.However, just like how I used Yuria as a sparring partner in the past to rapidly raise my proficiency. There are several ways to 'shortcut' that processAnd, one of the representative ones is this \u2018midterm\u2019 period.\u201c\u2026\u201dConsidering the current situation, there will undoubtedly be an opportunity to make use of it.Getting first place is one thing.A veteran player wouldn't miss such a hot event.\u201cAh, by the way, you should prepare yourself.\u201dI said to Elijah.\u201cYes? Prepare for what?\u201dWhat you may ask? Well...\u201cPrepare for slaughter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u25cfIf you ask Tallion what kind of person Dowd Campbell is, his answer would always be \u2018a scary person\u2019.At least after a few interactions with him, there's no better assessment than that.With his combat prowess that easily defeated the hero candidate and his meticulous planning, it's hard to believe that he's just a fellow freshman.However, it seemed that not everyone shared the same sentiment.While the \"scary person\" might stay true, it falls short of fully describing the extent of his character.\u201cAh, Dowd Campbell? That dangerous human scum? They said never to get involved with him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dTallion stopped tinkering with his spear and looked at his friend.\u201c\u2026What are you talking about all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cNo, it's true. Everyone else probably thinks the same way.\u201dAnother male student continued, scratching his head.\u201cAren't both the Student Council President and the Hero Candidate are close to that guy?\u201d\u201c\u2026Are they not?\u201d\u201cBut there's absolutely no reason for those two to be on good terms with him, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThis was a point Tallion agree with.On the surface, those two shouldn't have crossed paths with him. Never.However, anyone who had even a glimpse of his true abilities wouldn't find it strange.Unlike Tallion, who had witnessed his power firsthand, regular students have their information tightly controlled. So it's understandable why they feel that way.\u2018\u2026The academy seems to be blocking it.\u2019That was the impression he had.Otherwise, there's no way someone as capable as him would be falsely accused like this.As he mulled over those thoughts, the other person continued speaking.\u201cThere's rumors going around that he's grabbed ahold of their weakness.\u201d\u201c\u2026Weakness?\u201d\u201cThat's right. It just doesn't make sense that he can drag around the hero candidate and Princess Tristan. And, like, the guy doesn't have many friends, yet he's always busy running around somewhere. And he often meets people like the dean or president. Looking at it, isn\u2019t that suspicious?\u201dThe male student fired shots one after the other.Tallion could only respond with a wry smile.\u201c\u2026Are those two really the kind of people who would be easily caught by someone just because of a weakness? Isn't that a bit of a stretch?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why he's dangerous. I don\u2019t know how, but if it's not something like that, then it doesn't make sense!\u201dAs Tallion sighed and wiped his forehead, the male student continued his rant.\u201cAnd, above all, there's Professor Griver Lanfeld. They say the Professor said something rude to him during class, and then the Professor suddenly disappeared. Even if you ask the Theology students, no one knows what happened.\u201dTallion\u2019s hand came to a stop.Because this was a real possibility.Thinking about Marquis Riverback's example, that person is more ruthless towards his \"enemies\" than one would expect. The odds of him crushing someone directly is quite high.\u201cThere's probably a reason for it.\u201dWell, still.He wouldn't do something like that for no reason.\u201cWhy are you taking his side? Aren't you risking yourself with that? Everyone's determined to win.\u201d\u201c\u2026Win?\u201d\u201cYou know the rules for this midterm exam, right?\u201dOf course, Tallion was well aware of it.The highest score goes to those who reach the \"Sanctuary\" in the center of the Great Plains first within two days.There would be various beasts and monsters along the way to the Sanctuary, so one must cleverly navigate through them to reach it.The problem is...\u201c\u2026Are you saying that there will be a \u2018raid\u2019 there?\u201dDuring which, if you engage in combat with another student and snatch their \"necklace\", that is given to everyone, you'll gain additional points.It may seem wicked, but this style has never changed since its establishment, following the principle of survival of the fittest on the battlefield.In some cases, this kind of exam leads to 'concentrated attacks' on certain individuals.\u201cWell, most of them seem to be fans of the Student Council President or the hero candidate. There were quite a few of those gossiping about why that person is so close to them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe was one of them.Tallion picked up his spear with a wry smile.\u201c\u2026Then, do you happen to know when and where they planned the raid?\u201d\u201cHuh? Why? Are you going to join?\u201dAs someone who had firsthand experience of that person's power, he could say with certainty.\u201cNo. I will definitely avoid it.\u201dTallion replied with a smirk.\u2018I wish you poor souls good luck!\u2019He couldn't even begin to imagine how badly they'll end up, as he quietly prayed for the \u2018raid group\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, it's highly likely that even they couldn't guarantee a victory in this situation.They probably wouldn't even last that long.Not to mention.Even from the perspective of a Knights School Student that specializes in the physique, it was evident that the opponent didn't utilize even a fraction of their true power.This just means that there is that big of a difference between their \u2018trained\u2019 body alone.Considering that abilities that strengthen the body typically involve multiplying basic physical capabilities, this person's 'true strength,' is truly...\u201cWhat kind of monster are you\u2026!\u201d... Frightening.\u201cBullsht.\u201dHowever, the other person simply sneered at such words.\u201cThe problem is that you guys are weak.\u201dRiru Garda snorted and kicked the student in the head.With a grunt, the student's body rolled backward.This kind of violence was undoubtedly excessive for a midterm exam, which would end by simply taking their necklace. Riru also couldn't feel any enthusiasm for such violence.Isn\u2019t it natural for the weak to be beaten by the strong?But before any unnecessary guilt could even set in, she was consumed by endless frustration.\u2018Why can't I find anyone decent?\u2019Ever since her exile after the Tribal Union's \u2018Civil War\u2019, the time she spent in the Empire was nothing short of a prison sentence.Having obtained a student status that she never experienced, she was poking here and there for places to fight.Battlefield. Combat. Life and death.For someone whose entire life could be summed up with these three words, the academy was too peaceful.\u2018At this age, killing at least one person is already to be expected.\u2019Because of the barren environment surrounding the Tribal Union, unless one grew up as an exceptional warrior, survival is impossible.By comparison, the people in the Empire were weak and indecisive.It's only natural for frustration to arise.She didn't even use her powers.\u201c\u2026\u201dExcept for one guy.There was one individual who could keep up with her speed.His name was\u2026\u2018Do\u2026 do\u2026 What was it?\u2019Unfortunately, Riru\u2019s memory wasn\u2019t very good.Anyway, that guy.The one who saw through her using Law Power.\u201c\u2026Ha.\u201dLaw Power is a special power granted only to a tiny number of individuals in the Tribal Union.Not to mention the Empire, but even within the Tribal Union, there are only a handful of people who have witnessed its use firsthand.So seeing through it just like that means one of two things.Either he knows how to use it himself.Or he has met someone who does.And if at least one of the two is satisfied.Then he perfectly fits Riru's conditions for \u2018someone she needs to fight against\u2019.Especially considering why she and her clan were 'exiled' from the Tribal Union.\u201cAh, where can I find him? I want to hit him at least once.\u201d\u201cIf you do something like that for no reason, Riru Garda, you'll be expelled from the academy. Since you're in exile, it might be better to keep a lower profile, don't you think?\u201dHearing her name casually called, Riru flinched and she immediately turned around.It was an unfamiliar individual.Dressed immaculately in uniform, a black longsword, silver hair and red eyes, and a name tag that reads \u2018Elnore\u2019 on her chest.The Student Council President. Riru had heard that the Student Council President was one of the people who knew her identity.And, above all.\u2018\u2026There's capable people after all.\u2019Riru, who had roughly gauged the other person\u2019s skills level, smiled with satisfaction.She's not sitting as the students' representative for nothing. She's a worthy opponent that Riru is willing to risk her life to fight against.She looks weaker than her, but still at a level that could give her a run for her money.\u201cThe violence you are committing has already gone too far. As an overseer of this exam, I can't just let it go. I'm quite busy, but I got summoned because of you.\u201d\u201cSo what are you gonna do about it?\u201dRiru smirked and raised her fist.\u201cAre you going to kick me out?\u201dShe had a feeling it'd turn out like this.Oh how she wished that Elnore would draw her sword, and charge at her with genuine intent to kill. That's what she had been thinking.\u201cI will make you leave. Though, not by my own hands.\u201dHaving said that, Elnore pressed a switch she took out from her pocket.At the same time, white light emanated from the necklace Riru was wearing.Before she could react, an aura had already enveloped her entire body. Riru frowned.\u2018Divine Power?\u2019It didn't feel like it's going to harm her. More like there's a strong intention to \"remove\" her from the Grand Plain.There's such a blessing on all of the students\u2019 necklaces?\u2018\u2026Has the Empire ever had someone with such powerful divine abilities?\u2019A blessing that teleports the target to another location, it's quite an advanced technique.Not to mention distributing it to all the students currently in the Grand PlainShe even thought of the ridiculous idea that the Holy Land's Saintess was here.Of course, even the Saintess wouldn't be able to support all this.This is a magnitude that needs at least 10 Archbishop level personnel to stably operate it.If it's less than that, well.It would only serve the purpose of inflicting torture on the user.This is especially true when \u2018Divine Power Depletion\u2019 is considered.Lost in these thoughts, she soon received a response from the other person.\u201cAnyway, go and cool your head. This may be a competition, but fighting for barbaric reasons like you are is prohibited in Elfante.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are all the Empire's people just cowards? It seems like your father taught you so.\u201dAmong the things that a member of the Tribal Union can say are two top-tier insults.One is being called a coward, and the other, a disparaging remark about one's father.However, upon hearing this, Elnore showed no reaction other than a sneer.\u201cIndeed that old man is a coward. You have quite an observant eye, Riru Garda.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOn the contrary, she looked strangely satisfied.So it's true that her relationship with her father was bad. As expected, these Empire people are weird.However, she can't just step back like this. At the very least, she'll have to induce a reaction that will make her hostile when they meet later.Riru thought of a few more words to provoke her opponent.\u2018Ah, that\u2019s right.\u2019There was one more regular pattern that worked especially well for the warriors of the Tribal Union.\u201cWell, you can't deny that you're a coward yourself. Seeing that, I bet everyone around you is a moron, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dElnore\u2019s eyes narrowed.Oh, there's finally a reaction.Riru continued with a grin.\u201cDo you have a boyfriend? If you do, I'll snatch him away right in front of you. We'll see if you still act like a coward-\u201dBut she stopped mid-sentence.\u201c\u2026\u201dElnore hadn\u2019t said anything.However, her eyes.Those eyes were glowing red.Almost, inhumane.It was like the eyes of a \u2018monster\u2019, not a person.\u201c\u2026\u201dFacing that, Riru unconsciously took a step back.Even she's shocked from it.\u2018\u2026Did I get scared? Me?\u2019She, who had navigated the inferno of the battlefield countless times, was shaken by a mere gaze.And on top of that, it was from an opponent she believed she could confidently defeat.\u301aRiru Garda.\u301bElnore's frosty voice resonated to the dazed Riru's ears.The atmosphere around her had completely changed.As if...\u2018Something\u2019 different was inside her.\u301aI'll let it slide this time. You seem to enjoy provoking others without knowing your place.\u301bAs Elnore approached her step by step, Riru once again retreated a few steps back.The suffocating pressure made Riru's breath hitch, and her legs refused to obey.\u301aSo, there won't be a second time.\u301bAnd then...\u301aNo one can take that man away from me. Do you understand?\u301bWith that voice ringing into her ears, Riru's body was \u2018teleported\u2019 out of the Great Plains.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn the empty waiting room, she gazed down at herself with a blank expression.\u2018\u2026Just what, was that?\u2019One thing was certain.The 'unknown entity' inside the Student Council President was something Riru could never defeat in battle.It's not just a matter of lacking skill or ability.But rather, it feels different from the very 'nature' of her being.That even if she trained all her life, she wouldn't be able to overcome it.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s been a long time since she felt like this.A wild grin appeared on her face.Her body was drenched in cold sweat, but her spirit was more excited than ever before.There's finally someone worthy of a fight in this place. An individual she wanted to battle to the death.In other words, she can become stronger through this struggle.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe moment the situation completely flipped was after she mentioned 'boyfriend.'It was Elnore's trigger topic.In other words, it's a surefire way to provoke a fight.Then all she needs to do...\u2018\u2026The key is that guy.\u2019She'll somehow 'conquer' him.Her eyes glinted with determination.\u25cf<System Message>[ The target \u2018Riru Garda\u2019 has started taking an interest in you! ][ The target \u2018Elnore\u2019 has unlocked a new skill under your influence! ][ \u2018Divine Descent - Wrath\u2019 will be added to the target's skillset. ][ Skill will be added to \u2018Skill: Guidance\u2019 ! ]\u201c\u2026\u201dSometimes, I really just want to grab the system by the collar and ask.I legit didn\u2019t do anything, so tell me why the hell are these things being added?And, to begin with...\u2018Divine Descent?\u2019This is a technique that, albeit limitedly, manifests the devil fragment. The 'Wrath' The 'Wrath' part means that the corresponding emotion is maximized to unlock this skill.In other words, it's not something that just an option you open when you're angry. It only happens when you genuinely want to kill someone.\u2018\u2026What the hell happened?\u2019These thoughts crossed my mind, but now is definitely not the right time to leisurely ponder such things.I have my hands full.\u201cYou heinous bastard\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou dare wear a mask to do something like this, show yourself\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dListening to the torrent of insults right in front of me, I wanted to defend myself.Like.On one hand, I was dragging a woman as if she's some luggage, and on the other, have another woman on a leash.\u201cHe's treating people like animals...! Miss! Hero! Please wait a moment! I'll rescue you soon!\u201d\u201cYeah, take revenge for our fallen brothers\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026You're together with them?\u201dI asked in a dumbfounded voice.I've been ambushed more than ten times getting here.So they're all in on this\u2026?\u201cAnyone who raise their sword at a trash is a comrade!\u201d\u201cLook at how you fought first then tell me, you scumbag!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHmm. I don\u2019t have anything to refute.They were easily repelled by Elijah and Yuria. In the first place, what could freshmen really do against the Hero Candidate and a devil vessel?Rather than blocking the blocks, it was more difficult to control Yuria's distance and not have her within three steps of anyone.But this is exactly the problem.From an outsider's perspective, me suddenly pulling the leash look like I was forcefully dragging Yuria around like a slave.\u2018\u2026I saved you guys.\u2019I never meant for it to be weird.Never\u2026![Why are they so angry? I\u2019m fine.]No. Even if the person involved says such things, it doesn't explain the situation at all.It wasn't a good look.Elijah smiled bitterly at the sight of Yuria tilting her head as she wrote out.\u201cStill, this time won't be easy.\u201dElijah eyes narrowed as she looked at the people in front.The previous raids were relatively small-scale, but the group in front of us right now consists of almost a hundred people.Seeing all these people gathering here with the intention of taking me down feels strange.\u2018\u2026Are they all Elijah's fans?\u2019Superfans can be so scary.I knew this would happen when I teamed up with her.\u201cThis would need more than just fighting to get through all of this. If only we could bypass this, it would lead us straight to the sanctuary. Why does it have to be like this\u2026\u201dEven for Elijah, who had effortlessly dealt with the previous attacks, this number of opponents is overwhelming.It's not just a large number; it's a perfectly balanced combination of the Knights School, Magic School, and Theology School.To simply break through this combination with just three people would be an absurd idea.\u201cNo. This is fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dUh.Rather, I was waiting for something like this.Mainly in terms of honing my abilities.Improving skills through actual combat is one way, but there is a skill that can only be utilized when you have 'comrades' and 'large-scale enemies.'\u201c\u2026\u201dObviously, that's only possible when combat is possible. But the current gap between us and them is like the difference between the Heavens and Earth.But I have a 'way' to narrow that gap.If the opponents are balanced, there is only one way to break through.Overwhelming power.\u201c\u2026\u201dWith a smirk, I tap the amulet lightly.Ajusshi. Wake up.[\u2026Uh? Huh? What?]Caliban drowsily muttered inside the amulet.Thanks to my insufficient Divine Power, this person spends most of his time sleeping.Unless I specifically wake him up, he stays in a kind of hibernation state.I whisper quietly to the amulet.\u201cCould you please do me a favor and come out.\u201d[\u2026I don't know what's going on, but it seems dangerous.]At the same time Caliban muttered that, a white curtain unfolded around us.[ Spiritual Body has been summoned! ][ Skill: Image World has been activated! ][ Buffs are shared with nearby \u2018party members\u2019! ]And here.\u201cOi.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dI looked at the wide-eyed Elijah and whispered.\u201cI apologize in advance. You can hit me as much as you want later. I'll take it all.\u201dEven I think that this is a bit\u2026 overkill.But this is necessary. Anyhow.Before she can respond, I pulled her tightly with one arm, drawing her closer to my body.[\u2026Look at this guy. Did you wake me up just to show me this?]As soon as Caliban said with a chuckle.\u201c\u2026!\u201dWhile Elijah's body stiffened, and Yuria's eyes widened from the side.I smiled at the crowd in front, which suddenly fell silent.\u201cBut you see, you guys.\u201dCalm and collected, I spoke nothing but the facts.\u201cWhat gives you the right to take this guy?\u201dSmiling slyly at the astonished crowd, I said.\u201cI never said I would give her to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDoes the \u2018owner\u2019 need a stranger's permission?\u201dSilence spread all around. It went on for a long while.As Elijah\u2019s face turned flush, piercing screams echoed in the surroundings\u201cKill that bastard-!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tear you up, you some of a bit-!\u201dThe various curses and shouts were soon drowned out by even louder roars as students, equipped with their weapons, rushed towards us.Oh wow, that's scary.But the scarier they charge at me, the better.[ A moment of danger has been detected. ][ Determined the situation could result in serious injury. ][ Skill: Desperation raised to A Grade. ]Now then.The term 'buff' generally refers to a skill that enhances the target's abilities.In other words...[ Confirming activation of 'Skill: Image World'. ][ Sharing \u2018Skill: Desperation (A Grade)' with target 'Elijah' and target 'Yuria'. ]That's right..\u25cfNotes:[1] Tribal Union power from 'magic' to 'Law Power' for differentiationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Info",
