    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: A Flash Marriage, and a New WifeIt was nine o\u2019clock and the evening was sultry.Tang Ning had drunk too much at her bachelor party, so her fiance brought her back to her apartment, but when she opened her eyes in spite of her headache, she could see a pair of man and woman exchanging a passionate kiss.Tang Ning, like a lightning strike, when she sluggishly looked at the two people kissing by her bed, her heart erupted in anger.\u201cYu Rou, do not be so reckless, Tang Ning just fell asleep!\u201d The man holding the woman\u2019s waist said.\u201cWhy? Are you afraid of your fiancee waking up?\u201d Mo Yu Rou softly complained, \u201cTomorrow you will be married, so this night, you must give it to me!\u201d\u201cBaobe1, let\u2019s not make trouble, and instead go to another room!\u201d The man coaxed.\u201cDon\u2019t! I\u2019ll be here! I\u2019ll be in front of her!\u201d Mo Yu Rou quickly unbuttoned the man\u2019s shirt, the two kissing again for a while.Tang Ning\u2019s tears fell, how could she expect that the fiance she would register tomorrow with, would have an affair on her bed?\u201cBe good, let\u2019s go to the bathroom, don\u2019t you like it when we use the bathtub?\u201d\u201cYou go ahead into the water!\u201d Mo Yu Rou gently pushed the man\u2019s chest, waiting until the man left, before she stepped in front of Tang Ning, sneering, \u201cTangning, tomorrow, I will not let Yu Fan have the opportunity to register and marry you, because I am pregnant, and he is mine!\u201dTang Ning\u2019s hands clenched into fists, but she did not fight back and make a sound, until soft moans could be heard from the bathroom, did Tang Ning feel herself break.Three years ago, she was Beijing\u2019s first supermodel, but for this man, she gave up everything, her position was given to Mo Yu Rou, it turns out that she was just giving someone else a wedding dress. No, she was just dreaming, she just had to wake up and it would be alright.Tang Ning kept on lying to herself, but until midnight, Mo Yu Rou\u2019s body were wrapped with Han Yu Fan\u2019s body, and they left the hotel, Han Yu had so neatly abandoned her away!But they were going to be married tomorrow, ah!With a bitter smile, the next morning, Tang Ning, according to the original plan, drove to the Civil Affairs Bureau, and after getting off called Han Yu Fan, but he gave her a cold answer, \u201cMo Yu Rou had a stage injury, I have to first deal with important things, let\u2019s register another day.\u201dAnother day! Tang Ning reminded herself in her heart.Tang Ning turned around to leave, putting on her sunglasses, before she was surprised to see a tall figure come towards her, a dark blue retro suit wrapped around a strong body, *chest pocket with a wine red scarf, looking down the legs were straight and slender, a pair of shiny brown shoes.This man\u2026 gives a sense of oppresion that is too strong, just like a medieval noble emperor!Especially after he approached, even though he was wearing sunglasses\u2026 *his face looked as if it was carved with a knife, especially his thin lips which could drive a person crazy.Tang Ning recognized the man, he was the Hai Rui entertainment president Mo Ting, back when she was famous, *he once attended a party she was also in.He was also going to get married today?\u201cPresident\u2026 Miss Chi did not arrive on time\u2026 she has been late for ten minutes!\u201d Behind him, an assistant respectfully said.\u201cCall my family, *those who are late even for marriage, will always be late,\u201d the man said coldly.\u201cBut the chairman said that today you must marry, that even if you marry a demon he wouldn\u2019t object,\u201d the assistant said timidly.\u201cThen randomly pick a lady, I will only give half an hour\u2026.\u201d The man spoke, seeming a bit unreasonable.At first, she thought they were in the same boat\u2026 but it is different, Mo Ting had it easier, as someone who who was already rich, he did not need love, he only had to cope with the elders asking him to marry.Suddenly, Tang Ning had an idea. She removed her sunglasses, walked to in front of the man, and whispered, \u201c*Mo Ting, your bride is not here, and my groom has ran off, wouldn\u2019t it be better if\u2026 we fight together?\u201dBehind Mo Ting, the assistant was stunned, a woman could actually be so bold\u2026But Tang Ning\u2019s back were straight, as she had all of her courage.Mo Ting took off his sunglasses, revealing eyes as dark as ink, his pupils like diamonds, emitting a sharp light, but after a moment, he turned to ask his assistant, \u201cGive me her information!\u201dThe assistant, of course, knew the identity of Tang Ning, directly searched on his phone her name, and then respectfully offered it. Two minutes later, the man\u2019s lips thinned slightly, only to spit a word at her, \u201cOkay!Tang Ning felt that it was her luck that allowed her to meet Mo Ting, because he did not need a woman, did not need her so-called love, furthermore did not need anyone else in his bed!Also, she would make Han Yu Fan regret it!Two marriage certificates were quickly processed and half an hour later, Tang Ning received a marriage certificate, and from then on, she became a married woman.\u201cMo Ting, don\u2019t know if you have some time, can you listen to a few words of mine?\u201d\u201cIn the car!\u201d Mo Ting put on his sunglasses, and began to leave the registration hall.Tang Ning followed behind Mo Ting, and inside the Rolls-Royce, sent a nervous look towards Mo Ting Dao.\u201dThank you for getting married to me, whatever you need me to do, I will be unconditional, but there are two things I hope you can promise me.\u201d\u201cSpeak!\u201d Mo Ting said.\u201cFirst, please do not interfere with my private affairs, since we are married, you can rest assured that I will not have too much contact with other men.\u201dMo Ting heard Tang Ning\u2019s words, his lips slightly raised.\u201cI promise you\u2026 however, I will give you time to clean up your messes from your past, we will try being married, six months later\u2026 I will fully open the news of our marriage.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d Tang Ning nodded.\u201cAnd also\u2026 I do not agree with couples living separately! I will give you three days to move to the designated location, my assistant will contact you afterwards!\u201dTang Ning did not object, since they were husband and wife, this request was very reasonable, so she nodded submissively, \u201cI promise you!\u201d\u201cGood!\u201dAfter the two\u2019s agreement, Tang Ning left the car, and the assistant sitting on the driver\u2019s seat looked at Mo Ting, \u201cPresident, are we going to go back to the company? Or are we returning to your house to tell the chairman?\u201d\u201cYou drive to Tang Ning, tell me her whereabouts!\u201d Mo Ting told the assistant, and then he got off.Suddenly he was married, *nothing can not happen!As he was the president of a multinational entertainment company, he had not heard of Tang Ning\u2019s name, who had been famous in the modeling industry, but three years ago, Tangning suddenly refused the first-class model company Xinghuang\u2019s offer, *it was a comprehensive ban, after that, she was announced signing with Arts Entertainment, and their boss Han Yu Fan *played fervently.\u2013!\u2013!\u2013!\u2013Translator\u2019s Notes:Hello there, nice to meet\u2019cha!

The media should know she was in the hospital\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, I have let people know, that Yu Rou will attend, so you will go for her!\u201dReally shameless, ah, before she helped Mo Yu Rou do these stupid things.Before, she was taken advantage of, however, not every time would she help Mo Yu Rou with her wedding dress!Tang Ning remained calm and nodded, \u201cOkay, tell me the time and address, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\u201cTang Ning, we are getting married, you should promote Mo Yu Rou, so her career will rise!\u201d\u201cI will promote her as best as I can!\u201d Tang Ning said.\u201cThen I will hang up, we can eat together later.\u201dHan Yu, who did not realize that the situation was already reversed, presumably just now, was keeping Mo Yu Rou company on her bed, was being sweet and tender to her? Tang Ning hanged up, gave her agent a call, was suddenly reminded of her anger in her heart and mind.\u201cHan really wants you to go and model for that Mo Yu Rou? There is no mistake? If you hadn\u2019t gone and retired, there would be no place for her!\u201d\u201cSister Long, I have already promised\u2026\u201d Tang Ning said calmly.\u201cYou really want to go?\u201d Her agent vomited blood, Tang Ning and Mo Yu Rou at present day were entertainment models, but because Tang Ning retired, she and her agent were subjected to a lot of ridicule.Tang Ning knew her agent was itching to fight the injustice, and laughed, \u201cI will not be so stupid so as to let people use me!\u201dHearing Tang Ning say this, her agent was suddenly revived,\u201dSo you have a plan?\u201d\u201cSister Long, I can trust only you right now, so help me with one thing, okay?\u201d\u201cYou say it,\u201d her agent was absolutely loyal to Tang Ning, after all, their interests were the same.\u201cMo Yu Rou is deliberately pretending to be too hurt to attend, simply because of the impact of the annual selection of the top ten models, help me go to this hospital!\u201d\u201cI understand, during that time period, she is still in that hospital, and then we\u2019ll expose her!\u201d Her agent said excitedly.\u201cNo, we have greater material - she is pregnant, and the father is Han Yu Fan! Also, please help me prepare a statement in advance, the content is that Han Yu Fan repeatedly used me to help cover for Mo Yu Rou, specifically a few events, I will also trouble Sister Long to find evidence.\u201dHer agent was first surprised, but then she suddenly understood the reasons for her change of attitude. Really shameless, these 1.dog-like man and woman, having an affair, and still using her like she was a servant!\u201cTang Ning, do not worry, these two things, I will help you do a good job.\u201dTang Ning did not answer, but her heart was still not calm, thinking how others were to her, and her to them!Wanting to think about it later, Tang Ning hastily packed her things, drove alone to the catwalk site, and rendezvoused with Mo Yu Rou\u2019s assistant.He was a burly, married man, more cunning and *more powerful.He was fairly polite to her.*\u201cWhen did you come? Quickly\u2026 follow me for your makeup\u2026\u201d\u201cThis show today, what show is it?\u201d Tang Ning asked while walking.\u201cNot that important of a show!\u201d The assistant answered, actually, this is the well-known jewelry brand HF fashion show\u2026After this show, Mo Yu Rou may become the spokeswoman for the HF, the original contract may be wasted because of Mo Yu Rou\u2019s injuries, however because Han Yu Fan wanted Tang Ning to model as her, then he could not wish enough for it!Actually, Tang Ning, when she was on the road had already checked today\u2019s show, this show was the crown of jewelry shows, Mo Yu Rou\u2019s assistant had lied to her, was\u2026 she really that easy to deceive?\u201cThanks to Mo Yu Rou\u2019s status, we have an independent dressing room, you have the final appearance, this is the jewelry you will showcase for a while, this is the process table,\u201d the assistant said pointing to the dressing table full of jewelry facing Tang Ning, and then told the makeup artist to put makeup on Tang Ning.Han Yu Fan thought, if she wore a mask, that others would not recognize her as Tang Ning?This was a desperate attempt, and she would give the two [^1]dog-like man and woman a surprise.Actually, Mo Ting\u2019s assistant followed Tang Ning, and found out that she was going to help Mo Yu Ruo, called Mo Ting, and hearing it, Mo Ting immediately contacted the secretary inside, \u201cI\u2019m going to the HF Jewelry catwalk event, immediately arrange!\u201d\u201cYes, President!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t really a high-level show for him, however, he wanted to see Tang Ning\u2019s true strength.\u2026\u2026Eleven A.M., *the show was playing classical music, apparently already opening.In the dressing room, Tang Ning had already had her makeup applied, she was standing in front of a long mirror quietly waiting. She was wearing a white tube top and a tight skirt, simple but beautiful, with a golden mask, creating a mysterious atmosphere, her long hair was set at her back, with a white rose in her hair, she simply looked incredible.The assistant who saw her, thought, Tang Ning standing still, was still stunning, Mo Yu Rou\u2019s promotion, she would get it!\u201cYour way of admission is from sitting on a chair from the sky! This bracelet, is the crown of stars, I\u2019ll give it to you to wear!\u201d The assistant took the bracelet, and carefully fastened it onto Tang Ning, however\u2026 Tang Ning compared to Mo Yu Rou was softer and slimmer, so the size was too large, it went directly down her arm\u2026The founder of HF designed the bracelet for her daughter, the gold chain body had a mosaic of a white diamond crown, and on the crown\u2019s both sides, were two white star gems, a symbol of a parent around their baby.\u201cI can\u2019t wear it\u2026 what do we do?\u201d\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d Tang Ning suddenly asked Mo Yu Rou\u2019s assistant.\u201cNow I can only believe you, ah,\u201d the assistant nodded, this critical problem, he can only believe in the model. This was Mo Yu Rou\u2019s endorsement, if this was screwed up, he would have to leave from Korea.\u201cThat, give it to me\u2026\u201d Tang Ning said confidently.\u201cGet ready quickly\u2026 you appearance will come soon!\u201d The assistant did not notice Tang\u2019s eyelashes which were hidden under her eyes.\u2013!\u2013!\u2013!\u2013Hello! Here we have the second chapter of this novel. It\u2019s easy to see at the top, the title was kinda weird, but I think it means like insulting them, calling the two b*tches? *shrugs* meh.

    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: Suspected HypeTang Ning smiled and nodded, and then wearing the skirt, went to the backstage, because she was wearing a mask, if anyone wanted to know the difference between her\u2019s and Mo Yu Rou\u2019s body, then she was known to have one of the most beautiful long pair of legs in the world!The show was already at its climax, but they could see Tang Ning sitting on a wicker chair from the sky, all the spotlight was centered on her body, but when her wrist was lit up, there was no crown star\u2026This was\u2026 what was the matter?The field of people looked around for the shadow of the crown star\u2026That is - those people would never forget those legs!Following that, under her golden mask, Tang Ning smiled confidently, and softly and elegantly raised her hand, tilted her head backwards, made a very beautiful dance posture, and in that moment, on Tang Ning\u2019s ankle was the string of crown stars, exuding a suffocating bright light.Heavens\u2026Everyone was stunned by this scene, what was even more memorable is that Tang Ning was constantly changing her posture and movement, giving off a different sense of beauty each time\u2026The audience instantly broke out into very warm applause, everyone stood up excitedly, in order to applaud Tang Ning.Among the crowd, in a high and very quiet place, Mo Ting concentrated on watching the stage where Tang Ning was, his new wife, the former Beijing supermodel, unexpectedly arrive to stand in for someone on a B model catwalk.But he had to say, whether it was three years ago, or that she was retired three years after, she was really a supermodel.WIth her last posture, it gave the jewelery show a perfect ending, the HF founder of Tang Ning\u2019s last catwalk was very satisfied, of course, he did not know that it was Tang Ning, he thought she were Mo Yu Rou.He stepped onto the runway from the backstage, and extending his hand towards Tang Ning he went to the top position with her and together, they bowed to the audience.\u201cThank you, of course, please thank Miss Mo as well for the show\u2019s development, truly wonderful.\u201dTang Ning did not speak, but politely bowed, but no one thought, at the end of the T catwalk, suddenly came a sharp voice, \u201cShe is not Mo Yu Rou, I have seen Mo Yu Rou, Mo Yu Rou doesn\u2019t have legs that supple!\u201dSuddenly, everyone was shocked, and giving Tang Ning looks of doubt, they kept looking at her pair of legs, \u201cIf you are really Miss Mo, please take off the mask, if not, then you are an impostor!\u201dThere were more and more skeptical voices, more and more, even the HF designers doubted that the woman was Mo Yu Rou.\u201cMiss Mo, please take off the mask\u2026\u201d The designer also wanted to know whether she was Mo Yu Rou, if not, then their collaboration with Day Arts Entertainment would have to end.Tang Ning\u2019s earlier performance was difficult to pull off, however, at present, she was surrounded at all sides by enemies, and Tang Ning had no option, but to take off her mask, at that moment, everyone breathed a sigh of relief, but when one person took a glance to see the face of the supermodel\u2026\u201cShe is Tang Ning!\u201dEveryone said that since Tang Ning suffered after the ban, her status ceased to exist, *even newbies were better than her, to think that she was reduced to doing other people\u2019s shows, was it a deliberate promotion, or was she forced to do it?\u201cTang Ning, it is actually Tang Ning,\u201d reporters quickly surrounded her, so Tang Ning was caught in the middle of a group of reporters, with no escape route.\u201cMiss Tang, can you tell us about the HF jewelry show, Mo Yu Rou was specially invited to appear, but why did you replace her at the last moment?\u201d\u201cAs we all know, you were banned three years ago, could it be that you are using this fashion show to return to the model circle?\u201d\u201cA has-been model, you say, are you not taking advantage of Mo Yu Rou\u2019s resources? Are you not taking advantage of her injuries, and would like to take the opportunity to take away her endorsement?\u201d\u201cIt only took one look to know it was just some hype, I said, Mo Yu Rou has been injured, how could she come on the catwalk, what generation of supermodel, simply a model of lowly models!\u201dThe reporters\u2019 questions became increasingly sharp, and even some people began to speak.\u201cA has-been model\u2026\u201d\u201cThis endorsement was for Yu Rou, bring back Yu Rou!\u201dTang Ning was pushed back step by step, by the journalists on a siege, she was even pushed by the reporters, but at that moment, the HF designer continued to attack her, \u201cI will complain about Day Arts Entertainment, you are a fraud! I want Mo Yu Rou, you actually gave me a third-rate model.\u201d The designer did not know Tang Ning\u2019s status three years ago, he only knew that he had not seen such a model recently.\u201cAnd you, wait for it, I will see you in court! But now, get out of my sight! You don\u2019t deserve to stand on my T catwalk.\u201dThere was a sharp roar through the entire stage, and even the journalists and HF designers were shocked, because no model would be yelled at at the catwalk.\u201cYou won\u2019t get lost?\u201dTang Ning had already been prepared, and still persevered through the humiliation, but at this time, a low and magnetic voice came from the other end of the T stage.\u201cThat someone that will get lost\u2026\u201dReporters were surprised to hear the voice, surprised to see Mo Ting standing, looking indifferent at the end of T stage, everyone stared, god\u2026 was this not the president of Hai Rui entertainment? How could he be here?More importantly, he went to T stage, everyone knows, Mo Ting hated deceitful artists, Tang Ning was now about to suffer the consequences, she seeked the road to disaster, even Hai Rui could not stand it.Everyone forgot to breathe, that Tang Ning was actually so unlucky, surprised to see Mo Ting come to Tang Ning\u2019s side, like an emperor, and say to the designer of HF, \u201c\u2026 won\u2019t be her, but you!\u201d\u201cHF, do you want me to make you disappear from Beijing, since it seems your upbringing and your jewelry are not first grade?\u201dTang Ning\u2019s heartbeat suddenly stopped, she did not think\u2026. To see the third side of her husband, that would stand up and help her speak.All of the media was shocked, but they also began to be fearful, they had not known that Tang Ning and Hai Rui had a relationship, they did not dare to be so presumptuous.The HF designer\u2019s face became ugly, but he also knew he could not offend Hai Rui International, after a few seconds of silence, can only apologize, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mo Ting, I did not know about that lady and yours\u2019 relationship\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are wrong, she and I do not have any relationship, I was simply\u2026 not happy about your character!\u201d Mo Ting left aside his relationship with Tang Ning, ready to leave, but just before leaving, he also said to all of the media, \u201cbut it is undeniable, that she will be a new star of the modeling industry.\u201d\u2013!\u2013!\u2013!\u2013Heyo guys, we now have the third chapter! Here, we get to see Tang Ning\u2019s revenge be put into action, and it will be continued next chapter, which will be posted on either Thursday or Friday, as my schedule dictates. Probably Wednesday though, since I\u2019m feeling impatient and giddy.\u00a0 (*\u00b0\u25bd\u00b0*)Anyway, I hope you enjoy reading this chapter!\u00a0 (\uff3e\u25bd\uff3e)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Hidden Marriage RelationshipThe public media was surprised, Mo Ting would say so, was interested in signing with Tang Ning? Mo Ting just said a joke, right?But no matter how, the media and jewelry designers did not dare to give Tang Ning trouble, can only shout criticism at Day Arts Entertainment now.This time, Day Arts Entertainment and Han Yu Fan\u2019s big problem, Mo Yu Rou\u2019s assistant was directly bombarding Tang Ning, \u201cYou could not even do this trivial matter well, what are you going to do, this time see how Han will sort you out!\u201dTang Ning disagreed, and her face was not truly calm, she departed from the show after switching her clothes, but by the side found Mo Ting\u2019s sports car.\u201cGet in.\u201dTang Ning obediently sat inside, for Mo Ting\u2019s move today, she was full of gratitude, \u201cToday, thank you.\u201dMo Ting\u2019s eyes stirred, his mouth showing a trace of a chuckle, \u201cDo you think I can tolerate others bullying my new wife in public?\u201d\u201cActually, I am not worthy of your help, because I deliberately let people recognize me,\u201d Tang Ning apologetically said.Mo Ting looked at her, and then averted his line of sight, \u201cI know.\u201d\u201cBut, in the event that you cannot deal with the other person, can you tell me, that if a thousand enemies hurt eight hundred, it would not seem stupid?\u201dTang Ning: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d\u201cYour house, are we not married?\u201d Tang Ning had to ask, because she has made a decision, she would not allow herself to regret it.\u201cYou want to know that we are not only married, tonight\u2026 is our wedding night!\u201dTang Ning blushed, but still nodded firmly, \u201cI am ready, thank you for concealing our relationship, but I still hope you can stand by, because I want to rely on my own strength, and take back what belongs to me.\u201dMo Ting grudgingly agreed, rarely was there a woman that did not want to rely on his position, he wanted to see what Tang Ning would do in the end.The two set off, Tang Ning quickly receiving a call from Sister Long\u2019s phone, \u201cTang Ning, I have evidence of Mo Yu Rou\u2019s pregnancy, how are you going to use it? And the jewelry show affair, it has already been spread on the internet, you are now infamous on the internet, they\u2019re scolding you, what do you plan to do about it?\u201d\u201cSister Long, are you willing to follow me?\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying?\u201d Sister Long crooned, \u201cyou want me to yield to that cheating couple?\u201d\u201cThen release my prepared statement, however, you and Day Arts Entertainment would have a falling out!\u201d\u201cAfraid of what!\u201d Sister Long was very excited, \u201cIt\u2019s time to fight back, I have to do this, the evidence is ready, I have to take advantage of Han Yu Fan not saying anything yet.\u201dTang Ning hung up the phone, the car\u2019s atmosphere once again becoming calm, Tang Ning actually became nervous, not knowing how Mo Ting now saw her as.\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cYour conversation, I heard, but are you so honest to anyone?\u201d Mo Ting took advantage of the red light, pinching Tang Ning\u2019s jaw, watching her with sharp hawk-like eyes.\u201cI am only honest in front of you, and will continue to be,\u201d Tang Ning revealed her loyalty, \u201c *because I am afraid you might have other bad thoughts concerning me.\u201dMo Ting was shocked. \u201cIf it was me, then I will only be more ruthless!\u201dMo Ting guessed correctly about her, Mo Yu Rou\u2019s and Han Yu Fan\u2019s relationship, and because of what he said, Tang Ning on her newly married husband, had a very good impression, anyway, she would remember today, all of her commitment and promises to Mo Ting.\u2026..On the other hand, Han Yu Fan also received the news that Tang Ning was on the catwalk and was recognized, not only that, HF also called, accusing Day Arts Entertainment, suddenly, Day Arts Entertainment was not just facing a breach of contract, on the internet there were many black material.Mo Yu Rou watching Tang Ning on the video, said to Han Yu Fan, \u201cYou see, Tang Ning deliberately let others know, she knew that what differed between us was our legs, she did it on purpose!\u201d\u201cYu Rou, Tang Ning is not such a person, this is not the first time she modeled for you on the runway,\u201d Han Yu Fan subconsciously still believed in Tang Ning.\u201cSo, you believe in that Tang Ning? Yu Fan, don\u2019t be silly, this incident, someone has to take responsibility, don\u2019t tell me that you want to violate the agreement? Or do you want to tell everyone, that you are getting Tang Ning to go for me? Then we\u2019re all over!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cAnyways, you and Tang Ning have to get married, she is not in the circle to stay, for the sake of Day Arts Entertainment, you have to immediately announce, that you did not know of this, we did not know, that Tang Ning wanted hype for herself, therefore she hid this from us, disguised herself, and substituted for me,\u201d Mo Yu Rou said, wanting to pour all the dirty water on Tang Ning.\u201cAt present, it can only be this way,\u201d Han Yu agreed, nodding his head, but also in his contacts with the company\u2019s public relations at the same time, \u00a0his assistant called his phone.\u201cChief Han, quickly look at the entertainment headlines, Tang Ning\u2019s agent, broke the news on the internet.\u201dHan Yu Fan immediately searched the headlines, surprised to see Tang Ning\u2019s agent,quickly indicate that he instructed Tang Ning to stand in for Mo Yu Rou, a large amount of black material came out, she also made a large number of comparison chart, claiming that the small workshops would bully people, that Tang Ning was bullied for many years.Han Yu went crazy, and immediately contacted Tang Ning\u2019s agent.\u201cSister Long, are you crazy?\u201dA laugh erupted from the other end where Sister Long\u2019s voice came from, her voice was steady, \u201cYour tiny rubbish company, I would not want to stay in it.\u201d\u201cYu Fan, this is certainly what Tang Ning wanted, you quickly press the news, Tang Ning\u2019s hype news was put up.\u201dHan Yu Fan did not hesitate to immediately use their own contacts, Sister Long immediately broke the news, Tang Ning being suspected of hype was put up on the news.All of a sudden, Tang Ning and Day Arts Entertainment, have climbed high as popular searches, and mixed.No one knew about the relationship between Tang Ning and Mo Ting, so compared to Tang Ning and Day Arts Entertainment, they were more reluctant to offend Han Yu Fan.Tang Ning was certainly at a disadvantage, on the network plenty were cursing her.Can it be, all the people think that the situation is reversed, Tang Ning wanted to go and substitute, suddenly, there was a rush of clicks, clicking into the content, all published by Sister Long, saying that Tang Ning was the wronged party\u2026Sister Long was the first to say that friends would naturally be prejudiced, plus Tang Ning had modeled for Mo Yu Rou so many times without any thought of any hype, has been suffering from Day Arts Entertainment, was still overwhelmingly first, everyone almost one-sidedly believe that Tang Ning was the victim.Han Yu Fan called public relations, wanting to give money to Tang Ning to suppress her mouth.At the same time, Mo Ting\u2019s assistant was directly talking to the media, \u201cIn the event that Tang Ning\u2019s substitution news was taken down because of the heat in the internet, then you are to \u2018close down a business and put the best face on.\u201d\u2013!\u2013!\u2013!\u2013\u2026. chapter four was kind of hard to translate, I\u2019m sure you guys can see some parts where confusing\u2026 but uh, I tried to translate it as best as I could, if it helps. The very last sentence, to\u00a0\u2018close down a business and put the best face on\u2019, I tried to search many times for its meaning, but\u2026 I didn\u2019t find anything. i wonder if someone knows what it means\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: Wedding NightThe media could not offend Hai Rui, although they did not know why Hai Rui would help Tang Ning.Even Sister Long did not understand how their plan could be so smooth, she thought about it for many days, \u201cTang Ning, you tell me, is there any other company that scooped you?\u201d1\u201cNo,\u201d said Tang Ning, glancing at Mo Ting\u2019s side, \u201cbut, indeed, someone is secretly helping me, as to who, it is not convenient for me to say.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha\u2026 okay, tell me later, when I just think of Han Yu Fan\u2019s flustered face, I feel that it is very much fun!\u201d Sister Long thought, Tang Ning really knew how to exploit her powerful backer.Simply could not think, that Tang Ning was the entertainment industry emperor Mo Ting\u2019s flash marriage wife..\u201cDo you want to use this opportunity, and leave Day Arts?\u201d Mo Ting, elegantly cutting the steak, asked Tang Ning.\u201cNo\u2026 \u00a0leave it be, it\u2019s too easy for those two people, I want them to fall from the highest place,\u201d Tang Ning said calmly, \u201cand, I have intended to return to the model circle, but my popularity is much worse than before, Day Arts Entertainment has some value.\u201d\u201cYou think that now because of anger, if someday, you no longer hate them\u2026\u201d\u201cNow that I\u2019ve decided to settle this affair, I won\u2019t regret it, it\u2019s impossible to go back,\u201d \u00a0Tang Ning firmly told Mo Ting, if she loved someone, she would do it wholeheartedly, if she hated someone, she would use her own hands to destroy them.Now, with how the affair just now was exposed, Han Yu Fan did not get even one call expressing sympathy or a hint of goodwill. There was also her press release that made them lose their reputation, that made them fall from grace. She could not give him a chance to hurt her.Mo Ting did not speak, however, he was really interested in Tang Ning.Tang Ning was not too stupid, but in fact clever, knowing not to lie in front of him, whether the truth was something light or dark. It was also a show of trust on her part.2\u201cMy assistant arranged for a suite in this hotel, tonight, we\u2019ll stay here, returning home doesn\u2019t appeal to me right now.\u201dTang Ning\u2019s face reddened, but she still nodded her head, \u201cI will listen to you\u2026\u201dHan Yu Fan was busy dealing with the media and the company\u2019s partners, as well as knowing that Mo Yu Rou was pregnant, he simply could not remember to call Tang Ning\u2019s number anymore, of course, now he didn\u2019t know her whereabouts.After a romantic dinner, Tang Ning followed behind Mo Ting, the two entering the presidential suite, which was also actually a wedding suite.She was in such a rush to get married, and yet Mo Ting was already taking care of her for her, so her heart warmed up to Mo Ting\u2019s actions.Mo Ting, who sensed that Tang Ning was becoming more and more tense, took off his suit, and said to Tang Ning, \u201cI am going to go take a bath to give you time to prepare, and if you still have any worries\u2026 then we can delay our wedding night indefinitely.\u201dTang Ning was grateful for his thoughtfulness, watching him enter the bathroom, but\u2026 obviously, they had been married already, she shouldn\u2019t be so capricious now!With these thoughts, Tang Ning pushed open the bathroom door, and meeting Mo Ting\u2019s surprised eyes, she reached out to hold him.\u201cI won\u2019t regret it!\u201d\u201cYou should be sure, because once I start, I won\u2019t give you a chance to struggle,\u201d Mo Ting said, restraint evident in his low, bewitching voice, as if the sound of it could move people, making them extremely fascinated.\u201cI am certain.\u201dHer words fell, and Mo Ting let go of his restraint, and with one hand on Tang Ning\u2019s waist he kissed her lips, his other hand lifting her wet skirt.Tang Ning\u2019s head blanked out in bliss, she never knew that there would be such a kiss with a magic so powerful she almost became irrational.Under the shower, Tang Ning gave Mo Ting a bedazzled look. She looked into his eyes, full of passion, and watched him slowly eat her up.But even in the heat of the moment, Mo Ting did not rush taking her, but instead wrapped her in a white towel, and gently placed her on the bed covered with roses. Mo Ting then took contraceptive measures, but when he really entered her, he felt some sort of obstruction\u2026Tang Ning cried out in pain, and Mo Ting quickly held her hand. He thought that since Tang Ning was in the entertainment circle, and was in a relationship with Han Yu Fan, it would not be her first time, but\u2026 from what he felt just now, she was inexperienced in that area.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Tang Ning asked, feeling Mo Ting suddenly stop. She looked up, her cheeks crimson red, making her look quite attractive.\u201cMaybe next time,\u201d Mo Ting said, feeling pleasantly surprised, but also bad for Tang Ning.\u201cWere you dissatisfied with me?\u201d\u201cIf I had just gone in\u2026 it would have been painful for you.\u201dMo Ting put on his bathrobes, and then went back to the bed, trying to quell his desire, he did not want Tang Ning\u2019s first experience to be unpleasant. \u201cWhy did you not tell me, you did not have any experience?\u201d\u201cThis kind of thing, how can I just say it?\u201d Tang Ning replied, resting her head on Mo Ting\u2019s shoulders, \u201canyway, eventually, you will know.\u201d\u201cMoreover, what happened just now? Are we doing it in the end, or not?\u201d\u201cNo matter what you do, you are my wife, and cannot get away\u2026\u201d Mo Ting finished, getting up, he carried Tang Ning into the bathroom.\u201cLet me see if there is any injury.\u201dTang Ning, noticing his nervous look, suddenly felt the urge to laugh. \u201cYou, you\u2019re simply not like how you are outside.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think am I like?\u201d Mo Ting put her in the bathtub, and turned on the faucet. \u201cTo dictate an artist\u2019s life or death like a monarch, attacking without any hesitation, or consideration of human nature, to others I am so!\u201d Mo Ting said seriously. \u201cBut you\u2026 since you became my wife, and are willing to trust me, then\u2026 I will also show my real side to you.\u201d\u201cBut Tang Ning, I want to warn you. For me, with infidelity, over a hundred times, any deceit or betrayal, I never forgive it.\u201dTang Ning was comfortably held up, her nose almost touching Mo Ting\u2019s, \u201cReally clever, I am the same.\u201dThat night, the two\u2019s physical relationship only progressed halfway, but their hearts were quickly joined together, the next morning, Tang Ning woke up, only to find the other position of the bed cold and empty.Tang Ning thought that Mo Ting had left, but\u2026 he was in the living room elegantly looking at information, waiting for her.\u201cThere are new clothes prepared for you in the bathroom, clean up, then we will leave.\u201d\u2013!\u2013!\u2013!\u2013\u2026 is this late? Yes, yes it is\u2026 and I\u2019m sort of sorry for that. Sort of, because I didn\u2019t expect the story to have mentions of, well, that, so early on in the story, so i kept on getting flustered and hesitating to translate those parts, lol. Well, anyway in the end I decided to add those parts as well, seeing as if I\u2019m translating the story, I might as well do the whole thing, I suppose.Well I still hope you enjoy it. I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019ll be able to get Chapter 6 tomorrow or what, since I updated this as soon as I was done.She\u2019s asking if another company gave her an opportunity to work of them, I think.\u00a0\u21a9Light, dark, whether they\u2019re meaningless, or trivial, or something heavy and serious.\u00a0\u21a9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: The Return of the Number One Top ModelOf course not, it was not yet the right time!Mo Ting knew what her plan was as well, so he handed the phone over to her, but Tang Ning avoided the taboo topic, and in front of Mo Ting, she pressed the answer key.\u201cTang Ning, where are you now?\u201d\u201cI was afraid the reporters would find me, so I hid,\u201d Tang Ning calmly replied.\u201cSo, you do not know what Sister Long said about the affair?\u201d Han Yu Fan asked.\u201cWhat did Sister Long do? I hid in a very remote place, so I had no way to know the news in the outside world, what happened?\u201d Tang Ning made herself as curious and inquisitive as possible.\u201cThanks to your agent, now Day Arts Entertainment is in big trouble, come back to the company, I\u2019ll give you a press conference, Tang Ning, only you can explain clearly, that Day Arts is innocent!\u201dWhat press conference, they wanted to play her as the scapegoat?They thought she was dumb enough?Tang Ning mockingly hanged up the phone, but\u2026 suddenly, Mo Ting uttered something.\u201cOn your phone, I have saved my number, so that I will always be able to know your whereabouts, feel free to tell me if there is anything you want to do.\u201d\u201cThank you, Mo Ting\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 You called wrongly\u2026\u201d Mo Ting laid down his hands on her legs, and squeezed it, \u201cif you call me something else\u2026 then I won\u2019t let you go.\u201dTang Ning blushed, but in a low voice, said, \u201cLao\u2026 alright.\u201d1Mo Ting gave her a rare smile.\u201cI\u2019ll send you to Day Arts, remember what you promised me\u2026to no longer be in touch with any man.\u201dTang Ning knew what Mo Ting was talking about, and gave him a soothing smile, wanting Mo Ting to trust her. Mo Ting\u2019s thoughts, between the two, it went without saying.Forty minutes later, Mo Ting sent off Tang Ning near Day Arts Company, after all, he was still the *** monarch, therefore with regards to everyone in the social circle of entertainment, he wanted to know how difficult it would be for Tang Ning to make a comeback in the modeling industry.Tang Ning also understood that she was a threat to many people, she was entering a game she couldn\u2019t be naive or ignorant in, that if she didn\u2019t reshuffle her cards and be able to turn around situations unfavorable to her, then she would only lose.Tang Ning got down from the car, going inside Day Arts secretly with the use of a hidden passage. Once the employees of Day Arts saw her, their gazes were filled with contempt, disdain and ridicule, seemingly accusing her of single-handedly planning what Sister Long did.Tang Ning chose to turn a blind eye at them, instead going into Han Yu Fan\u2019s office directly, looking at his tall figure from behind.\u201cYou came back\u2026\u201d Han Yu Fan said, turning around, looking exhausted.\u201cIn the end, what happened?\u201d\u201cTang Ning, you really did not know what Sister Long did?\u201d Han Yu Fan threw down the newspaper in front of her, angrily asking, \u201cif you didn\u2019t incite her, then how could she, a mere agent, dare to do it?\u201d\u201cYu Fan, we are getting married, why would I do such a thing? Did you not do it?\u201d Tang Ning\u2019s face was full of grievances, her voice also coming out choked.\u201cThat HF jewelry show, why did you wear the crown star on your ankle? You know, that what you and Yu Rou have that can expose you are your legs.\u201dTang Ning looked at Han Yu Fan who voiced this question, thinking of all the times that Han Yu Fan would protect Mo Yu Rou. She just used to think that Han Yu Fan was protecting his new company, so she endured it all, letting him defend other people, but now, she noticed, that he only defended Mo Yu Rou, and no one else.\u201cAt that time, I couldn\u2019t wear the crown star, there was no other choice but to put on my ankle, Mo Yu Rou\u2019s assistant was also present, you can ask him.\u201d\u201cI have already asked Yu Rou\u2019s assistant, and he said that you did this on your own initiative,\u201d Han Yu Fan said, stepping in closer and closer to her.\u201cI am your fiancee, and yet you\u2019d rather believe in an outsider?\u201d Tang Ning pretended to be disappointed, and further observe Han Yu Fan\u2019s expression. \u201cYesterday\u2026 should have been the day we registered for our marriage.\u201d\u201cAnyway, now there are consequences, we have been sued by the HF for breach of contract, and because of your agent, now more and more people are condemning Day Arts, the consequences of the aftermath, you have to take responsibility for it,\u201d Han Yu Fan looked down at Tang Ning, his gaze holding a hint of a God\u2019s dictation and arrogance.\u201cYou are going to be my wife, and I do not want my wife to be someone who will harm my career, so\u2026 Tang Ning, in order to keep the reputation of Day Arts, you are obligated to stand up and explain to the outside world, that this was just your agent\u2019s speculation, that it had nothing to do with Day Arts Entertainment\u2026\u201d\u201cTelling other people that what SIster Long said was to promote me, isn\u2019t that the same as admitting that I was planning to be promoted to people? This isn\u2019t the first time you wanted me to take the blame, and let Mo Yu Rou rise into popularity,\u201d Tang Ning cried out. \u201cYu Fan, is it because that I want to marry you, that I should be sacrificed?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care, this is just your responsibility,\u201d as he said this sentence, Han Yu Fan thought that his tone had been too heavy, and softened it down, wanting to reach out and hold Tang Ning, but Tang Ning pushed him away.\u201cTang NIng, I am also quite anxious, and\u2026 it\u2019s only this time, after we get married, I will be good to you\u2026\u201dSure enough, Tang Ning stopped her tears, and nodded her head. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll compromise, I will say that what happened was for promoting me, but there won\u2019t be a next time!\u201d\u201cNo, there won\u2019t be a next time,\u201d in fact, what Han Yu Fan though was, the next time you are still not fooled, after the wedding, Tang Ning could only be at his disposal.\u201cThe press conference is at 3 P.M., we\u2019ll meet before that, and plan out what you\u2019re going to say.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dTang Ning completely stopped crying, and saw that Han Yu Fan in the past and the present\u2019s eyes were no different. When Han Yu Fan stepped out of his office, her eyes flashed coldly. She cannot forget about that cheating slag right away, but she would still be loyal to her choice. After Han Yu Fan rejected the pot, she would not be back again.2Thinking of this, she returned to her lounge, and made a call to her agent.\u201cHahaha, Tang Ning, just tell me what you need me to do!\u201d On the other side of the phone wa s a voice full of fighting spirit. \u201cAt 3\u2019o clock in the afternoon, I will publicly apologize, explain that it was just some speculation, afterwards\u2026 you should anonymously spread Han Yu Fan and Mo Yu Rou\u2019s photos of intimate times in the hospital\u2026\u201cHahaha, oh, and I also thought of a perfect, matching title! Day Arts\u2019 president pedaling many boats, one of the many scums of society.\u201d Tang Ning laughed with her agent, but she still did not forget to apologize to her.\u201cI\u2019m sorry Sister Long, for troubling you.\u201d\u201cTang Ning, as long as you decide to start modeling again, I will help you return to your position of first-class model, even becoming an international supermodel!\u201d\u2013!\u2013!\u2013!\u2013And\u2026 we have the sixth chapter posted up! Not much of a note for now, except for me being curious about what she\u2019ll say at the press conference. ^^Lao is a pre-fix that indicates affection for someone\u00a0\u21a9I have no idea what it means, the translated version was wonky. Hopefully someone can tell me what it means\u2026 hey, someone responded! Thank you a lot, mx. Anonymous! (\u00b4\uff61\u2022 \u1d55 \u2022\uff61`) the original chinese version of this phrase is a play on words which means to take the blame for others, or be unjustly blamed.\u00a0\u21a9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Han Yu Fan, You Can Really Be So Ruthless!An international model, she hadn\u2019t thought that far, she just wanted to enjoy the present\u2026\u2026 and let Han Yu Fan and Mo Yu Rou pay the price.12 o\u2019clock the next day, for a long time she waited for Han Yu Fan, who unexpectedly took her to the basement level of a restaurant. There, surprisingly enough, was a candlelit table for their lunch. Watching the red roses and candle light contrast against each other, Tang Ning quietly, with the help of Han Yu Fan, sat down at the table.\u201cThere are some Sirloin steak for you on the table\u2026\u201dTang Ning was surprised for a moment and did not speak. Her former relationship with Han Yu Fan lasted for five years, yet he actually did not remember her preferences.\u201cHow do you not like it?\u201dTang Ning tried to speak, but a tall man dressed like a western chef suddenly came over to them and spoke, \u201cMiss Tang, here is your favorite Filet Mignon, I, on behalf of our restaurant Delphi 1, \u00a0would like to wish you newly weds an enjoyable time\u2026\u201dHan Yu Fan\u2019s smile tightened, his complexion changed, however it would be no good for him to flare up, leaving him no other choice but to bear the embarrassment. He gestured for someone to switch the meals placed in front of Tang Ning.\u201cYour taste changed?\u201d\u201cThank you, but we are not married!\u201d Tang Ning did not care about Han Yu Fan, she only looked at the chef standing in front of her and explained, \u201cIf you really are being considerate of me, then please remember it.\u201dThe chef politely left, and then Tang Ning turned back to Han Yu Fan.\u201cNext time I will remember\u2026 anything my wife loves to eat!\u201d Han Yu Fan seemingly said to himself.\u201cLet\u2019s just eat quickly, then you can give me the speech script!\u201d Tang Ning, in her heart, sneered at him, although her outside face was still calm as always.Suddenly though\u2026 she received a message entitled 0819, when she opened the content, she found that it was Mo Ting who sent it.The meaning of 0819, that is, the date that they married.\u201cI had my men send you some steak, my chef sincerely wanted to express good wishes.\u201dTang Ning felt the urge to laugh out loud, although she didn\u2019t in the end. Glancing at her phone underneath the table, she messaged back, \u201chow do you know where I am?\u201d\u201cIf you want to know, try and figure it out,\u201d Mo Ting calmly sent back this sentence.Tang Ning held her phone in one hand and looked all over the restaurant, but she didn\u2019t see Mo Ting. Although she didn\u2019t know how Mo Ting could send her a message so close to her, Tang Ning still felt that he\u2026 in the presence of someone who was like an emperor, said person could not be ignored, nor could they be refused.\u201cTang Ning, what are you looking at?\u201d Han Yu Fan reached out and interrupted her line of sight, his maroon eyes full of questions.\u201cNothing\u2026\u201d Tang Ning shook her head, and, in a moment, smoothly changed the topic.\u201cWhen are we having the re-registration of our marriage?\u201d\u201cAs soon as this affair passes. As you now, Mo Yu Rou is in the top selection for the top ten models, it is a good opportunity for her to rise. Fortunately, Tang Ning, you are there for her, otherwise, she would be slandered!\u201d Han Yu Fan poured red wine for Tang Ning, even toasting her.\u201cI will then take double of what you owe,\u201d Tang Ning smiled gently and beautifully, her shallow dimples showing, making her look even more lucid and elegant than ever.[^1]But even though he was in front of her, it was as though Han Yu Fan could not register it in his head, his nerves already being worn out by Mo Yu Rou often using him as a pillow and endlessly chattering to him. He did not pay attention to Tang Ning\u2019s words.\u201cTang Ning, you\u2019ve been suffering\u2026\u201d Tang Ning knew that this was him giving her her pot with sweetness in it, before poison infiltrated it.\u201cYes, after the press conference, you should contact Sister Long, as it seems, that the only way to deal with her kind of people, is to take legal means.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Tang Ning said sweetly, thinking, wanting to change Sister Long\u2019s mind, that was impossible!2:30 P.M., in the hall of Day Arts Entertainment, everyone in the fashion media was assembled. They were all quite interested in Tang Ning\u2019s public statement.Because, whether it was for when she suddenly retired in the past, or when she signed with Day Arts, or for the affair with Mo Yu Rou, after Tang Ning retired, she stayed low-key, making it exceedingly hard to find black material on her.At 3 P.M., Tang Ning appeared, dressed neatly in muted colors, a bodyguard accompanying her. She walked up the stage, and turning elegantly to face the media, she began to speak, sending the reporters into a frenzy.\u201cTang Ning, your name is being searched up fervently on the internet, did you do this or not \u00a0as advertisement?\u201d\u201cTang Ning, you and Mo Yu Rou are both models of Day Arts Entertainment, however in the past months only Mo Yu Rou has been active in the industry, is it or is it not true that you have been secretly harboring hatred towards her fame?\u201d\u201cTang Ning, was this done to hype your name or not?\u201dIn the face of the chaotic scene, the company team blocked the reporters, in order to keep the order and let Tang Ning speak.\u201cFirst of all, I would like to apologize to the public, because I personally caused damage to the company\u2019s reputation, as well as Mo Yu Rou to the outside world, for merely a bit of my speculation. HF crown star\u2019s catwalk was my own idea, without the knowledge of the company and other parties. Miss Yu Rou\u2019s unauthorized appearance, all this with my company they had nothing to do with it.\u201d\u201cI did do this\u2026 to hype myself up. But my agent knew nothing, she just felt that I was being used at the time, I will also take all responsibility, thank you everyone who supervised me, thank you.\u201dTang Ning\u2019s words fell, and there was instantly an uproar in the audience. Reporters were restless, because there had been no artists in the past like Tang Ning, who, with her neat appearance, would admit their own mistake. Others were anxious to write it off, emphasize her innocence in the whole matter, believing it so that Tang Ning did this due to so much guilt, and that Mo Yu Rou and the company really had no knowledge of the matter.Tang Ning then thought that it was over, but she did not think that Han Yu Fan would make to move to fully put on her back the blame of the situation. Han Yu Fan let the artist director deliberately go over to her side, and, facing the media reporters, say, \u201cthis is not the first time, but\u2026 I and the company, we\u2019re willing to give you one last chance, Tang Ning, hopefully you have learned your lesson, be a proper model.\u201dNot for the first time indeed, they wanted her to use it to overthrow Sister Long\u2019s statement, and accuse her of using Mo Yu Rou\u2019s show as hype for herself.Han Yu Fan, you could really be so ruthless!Tang Ning did not speak, but deeply bowed to the media, and then under the protection of the team, left the hall\u2026This time, on the internet, they all began to condemn her again, but after all, Tang Ning was quite intuitive, the public could only see the surface. They treated the whole affair as a joke.2In another place, Mo Ting finished a meeting, and hearing about the event, turned his head and looked at his assistant who whispered about Tang Ning\u2019s conference event.\u201cPresident, what do you want to do with miss Tang?\u201d\u201cNo need for the time being, soon we\u2019ll see her response,\u201d Mo Ting replied. As he had already been persuaded by Tang Ning, he was only now curious of what she was going to do to the two. With this, he would also further see her true capabilities. His wife could truly plan out schemes that could knock someone down their pedestal.\u2013!\u2013!\u2013!\u2013ahahahah, so this may have been posted a few hours on a Saturday morning\u2026 I\u2019m sorry QAQI can\u2019t actually translate for a while, final exams are coming up next week, and apparently we\u2019ve got a play going on for Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost on Thursday, so there\u2019s a lot to do with school next week. I\u2019m sorry! It seems like there\u2019ll be no updates next week and until after school eases up.On another hand, I wonder why Tang Ning went along with Han Yu Fan\u2019s plan at the press conference. Hopefully she\u2019ll get her revenge soon.\u6211\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4f60\u52a0\u500d\u8fd8\u56de\u6765\u7684 (I\u2019m really sorry I\u2019m only kinda half-sure about this.)\u00a0\u21a9\u4e00\u65f6\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u9a82\u58f0\u4e00\u7247\uff0c\u6bd5\u7adf\u5510\u5b81\u662f\u6700\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u627f\u8ba4\uff0c\u5927\u4f17\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u770b\u5230\u8868\u9762\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u6124\u6012\u4e0d\u5df2\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4e8e\u6d77\u745e\u5185\u90e8\uff0c\u90fd\u628a\u8fd9\u4ef6\u4e8b\u5f53\u505a\u7b11\u67c4\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002(Even more so at this one like I stared at the monitor and gave up for a while before resuming, ahahaha\u2026.

On another side, HF and Day Arts finally communicated smoothly, and they accepted Han Yu Fan\u2019s apology. The endorsement was meant for Mo Yu Rou after all. She had been cast as a victim, and due to this incident, she became more well-known in the industry.Day Arts Entertainment and Mo Yu Rou suffered no loss, but as for Tang Ning, her reputation was destroyed.On the internet, searches like \u201cpromoting days\u201d, \u201cscheming model replacement\u201d and \u201cgreen tea bitch Tang Ning\u201d[^1], as well as other topics became popular all of a sudden, and the comments related to this topic were also unsightly.Tang Ning sat in her own lounge watching the news, looking as thin as possible. She bore the stress, however, she decided in her heart to make Han Yu Fan and Mo Yu Rou pay her back ten times over!But she was now in everyone\u2019s eyes, and her image was at the very bottom. Even the company\u2019s cleaners could not help but look down at her and mock her.\u201cMiss Tang, could I trouble you to lift your noble legs \u2013 can\u2019t you see I\u2019m cleaning? It\u2019s not as if you\u2019re participating in any fashion show, yet you still come in everyday, forcing this poor woman to clean and cause pain to her lower back.\u201dTang Ning\u2019s face grew cold. She was currently in a tough spot, but that didn\u2019t mean that just anyone could come and bully her, so\u2026 she took out her cellphone, and placed a phone call to connect her to Han Yu Fan, and in front of the cleaner\u2019s face, she pressed the loudspeaker key.\u201cHan Yu Fan, is my position in this company so low that even the janitors dare to humiliate me?\u201d\u201cTell me the personnel\u2019s name, and I\u2019ll deal with them,\u201d Han Yu Fan said without any hesitation.Tang Ning hanged up the phone, and looked up, her face showing nothing but indifference to the woman. Her voice was incredibly cold. \u201cI am an easy-going person, however that does not mean you can just bully me. Even if I am not currently modeling, I am Miss Tang. Letting you, a mere janitor, be fired, is still very easy for me.\u201dThe woman paled and cold sweat poured from her. She really did not expect Tang Ning to be so angry, however she did not want to be fired, so she quickly bowed in apology. \u201cPlease forgive me, Miss Tang\u2026 I will not do it again.\u201d\u201cOf course, there are a lot of people that can replace you at your job, after all,\u201d Tang Ning replied. She did not want to make it hard for the employees, however, she had to give them a reminder. Tang Ning got up and, after receiving Han Yu Fan\u2019s message, went into his office.\u201cTang Ning, ah\u2026 your image has now fallen into the bottom, so\u2026 I arranged for you some activities, as much as I could in order to restore your reputation to the public. Since Mo Yu Rou is still hurt, go see her and take care of her, ask for an apology\u2026 show the public that you are set on correcting your mistakes.\u201dTang Ning looked at Han Yu Fan\u2019s face, it was still as calm as ever even when he had said something so shameful! It was obvious that Mo Yu Rou just wanted to humiliate her even further with this opportunity, and Han Yu Fan actually assisted her!\u201cIs that so\u2026 then in a few minutes, on a broadcast software, I\u2026\u201dHan Yu Fan originally thought that Tang Ning would certainly not agree, as Mo Yu Rou\u2019s demands were actually in fact unreasonable, so he did not expect her to actually acquiesce.\u201c\u2026 alright.\u201d\u201cYou are willing to go?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t visited Mo Yu Rou since I heard about her injury, so you can take this opportunity,\u201d Tang Ning graciously promised. \u201cI\u2019ll cover for you, since there are a lot of reporters.\u201dTang Ning now seemed completely quiet and obedient, because she knew in her heart, that by doing this she would help Mo Yu Rou fall further\u2026 the more she became arrogant, after her public image falls, the more miserable would she be.The person who had the last laugh\u2026 was still unknown.After a while, Tang Ning took Han Yu Fan\u2019s assistant\u2019s car to the hospital. Halfway there, she sent Mo Ting a message.\u201cLao\u2026 gong, don\u2019t worry about the news, I\u2019ll deal with it, and\u2026 when I want to go home later, can you send someone to Trinity Hospital to pick me up? I can\u2019t find your home address\u2026\u201dThe meeting was half-way done when Mo Ting received a text message, and for the first time ever pause the meeting. Everyone in the meeting was surprised by this, what kind of was there in Mo Ting\u2019s life to influence him to take a break in the middle of a meeting?Mo Ting did not care about other people\u2019s eyes. He replied immediately, \u201cgood. I\u2019ll pick you up later.\u201dTang Ning smiled when she saw Mo Ting\u2019s message, and thought that he really did look after her wellbeing. \u00a0Her eyes curved like the crescent moons[^2]. Han Yu Fan\u2019s assistant, upon seeing her smile from the rearview mirror, sneered. Tang Ning, how happy you appear to be right now, just wait until later!Tang Ning knew that almost everyone was currently hostile to her, but she forced herself to be indifferent about the eyes of those people. She sent a text message to her agent after she texted Mo Ting.\u201cSister Long, Han Yu Fan let me go to the hospital to take care of Mo Yu Rou. I am coming there right now, where are you currently?\u201d\u201cAnyone who has eyes can see that Mo Yu Rou is taking this opportunity to humiliate you, she thought that she could just do that? I have long been ready, what I have is wonderful\u2026 there are pictures and videos.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t just take the material out, give Han Yu Fan and Mo Yu Rou time to quibble.\u201d\u201cI understand, I\u2019ll wait for things to become ugly, and then, after that, I\u2019ll stamp their faces on the evidence!\u201d Sister Long was quite excited.\u201cI want Mo Yu Rou to be at the moment where she is proudest of herself and complacent\u2026 and then make her fall. Futhermore,\u201d Tang Ning added, \u201ceven if there will be a lot of people trying to curse you, I\u2019ll be there to say something, that is, sadly, I found out the real nature of their relationship!\u201d\u201cSister Long, we can only be careful\u2026\u201dHaving issued this information, Tang Ning and her agent quieted down, their mouths slowly raising into a smile.In the private ward, Mo Yu Rou at that moment was weakly sitting on the bed, but as long as the thought of humiliating Tang Ning came to her mind, her eyes would release an intense light.She really did not expect that Tang Ning, that idiot, would actually really help her, not only raise her reputation, but also win her back HF\u2019s endorsement.\u201cYu Rou, Tang Ning will be coming, you have to record live for three minutes long. I will help the doctor with your dressing, and then let Tang Ning take care of your feet\u2026\u201d\u201cFinally the day I waited for has come\u2026\u201d Mo Yu Rou softly said, she had been pressuring Tang Ning for a long time, after she would climb higher and higher, and Tang Ning would be like the soles on shoes. She wanted to be famous and together with Han Yu Fan, the president of the company.\u201cIn the future you will get more, and will soon participate in the annual top ten models selection.\u201dA trace of a smile could be seen on Mo Yu Rou\u2019s face, apparently even the heavens was now helping her. Her arrogance was rising and rising.[^1]: a close meaning to green tea bitch is someone being two-faced. Specifically, someone who acts cute and innocent but is actually a scheming bitch.[^2]: a common description in chinese stories. Just imagine anime happy closed eyes, or search it up.\u2013!\u2013!\u2013!\u2013My head hurts. Exams are making me throw up, but it\u2019s manageable.

It was the same man who was at the crown star runway affair, the very same person who persuaded Han Yu Fan that her wearing the jewelry on the ankle was done on her own initiative.He put all responsibility on her shoulders.\u201cCome here,\u201d her assistant arrogantly looked at Tang Ning, deliberately making things difficult for her, \u201cand wait, Mo Yu Rou is still resting.\u201dTang Ning gripped her handbag with both of her hands and then gave Mo Yu Rou\u2019s assistant a sweeping glance. In a soft, low voice, she drawled, \u201cdo you know my surname?\u201d\u201cNonsense, who doesn\u2019t know your surname Tang?\u201d\u201cThen, as you know that my name is Tang, you should know about my family background, and yours as a small assistant, acting arrogant in front of me.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cIs Tang Ning here? Come on in,\u201d Mo Yu Rou heard Tang Ning\u2019s voice. She was secretly unhappy that she had such a stupid assistant, who tried to blatantly bully Tang Ning. After all, Tang Ning still had the backing of the Tang family, and even if they didn\u2019t care much for her, she was still well-off.Tang Ning raised her chin, ignoring Mo Yu Rou\u2019s angry assistant as she came into the ward. Upon seeing Mo Yu Rou sitting pitifully on the bed, with an emphasis on her hurt leg, she exposed a touch of a smile.\u201cYu Rou, how are you?Tang Ning knew Mo Yu Rou deliberately hurt her legs in order to prevent her and Han Yu Fan from filling out the marriage registration, this woman was also hard on herself.\u201cHan told me what to do, we have to record a three minute live video, right? We\u2019re good sisters, Tang Ning, I\u2019m willing to help you reduce the misunderstanding the people have.\u201dTang Ning was surprised for a moment. She did not think that Mo Yu Rou\u2019s shamelessness was to this degree, it was quite on par with Han Yu Fan\u2019s.Tang Ning\u2019s face became ugly and her voice trembled, full of anger. \u201cI just came to see you\u2026\u201d\u201cTruly, well then, please don\u2019t stand on ceremony with me.\u201d\u201cRight, ah! The scenes are ready. The doctor will come and dress Mo Yu Rou\u2019s wounds, after a while, in order to highlight your sincerity, we have prepared a scene where you will wipe Mo Yu Rou\u2019s feet, so they can feel how sorry you are.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough\u2026\u201d Tang Ning\u2019s angry voice interrupted the two. \u201cMo Yu Rou, that scandal with me replacing you on the catwalk, we both know the truth, and yet this isn\u2019t enough for you?\u201d\u201cTang Ning, what do you mean? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cDo you have to be so black and white?\u201d Tang Ning\u2019s voice carried some grievances, \u201cIf not for Yu Fan, I wouldn\u2019t have endured so many times, haven\u2019t I helped you enough?\u201d\u201cTang Ning, you don\u2019t want to apologize? Why? You yourself admitted that what you did was just speculation,\u201d Mo Yu Rou was also an expert in drama, her words were watertight1, from beginning to end she seemed innocent.\u201cI will never apologize to you!\u201d Tang Ning said quite seriously.She was taken a picture of by Mo Yu Rou\u2019s assistant, and it was immediately published on the network, with the title: \u201cSpeculating Green Tea Bitch Declared She Would Never Apologize!\u201dAfter a while, there were many winds and waves online. Once again, the campaign was set off. Reporters flocked to the, but they did not intercept Tang Ning but instead Mo Yu Rou, who began to cry in front of the cameras.\u201cOriginally, because we were peers, I didn\u2019t intend to pursue this matter, but Tang Ning was really too much. She refused to apologize, and insulted me as well.\u201dThe war had taken off, the two opposite enemies were models. It was like a drama, and there was so much unknown in the fight that many passerby began to watch the fight. Day Arts Entertainment also immediately issued a press release response. They called the public, and said that they would seriously deal with Tang Ning, that they would renounce Tang Ning\u2019s position.At this time, Tang Ning\u2019s, \u2018I will never apologize to you\u2019 was ridiculed by the netizens into becoming a catchphrase. Everyone continued bombing Tang Ning, when suddenly\u2026On the network a group of photos was suddenly posted, with the title: \u2018Tang Ning did not apologize, because there is nothing to apologize for!\u201dThere was a set of photos where Mo Yu Rou and Han Yu Fan was intimately close to each other. Those pictures were taken in the hospital, where Mo Yu Rou was wearing a hospital gown and Han Yu Fan was pressing down on her body.An internet user named Eye did not have time to reverse it, and quickly enough a well-known website posted: \u201cThe Truth Of Tang Ning\u2019s Scandal!\u2019The post clearly detailed the whole event of Tang Ning substituting for Mo Yu Rou, the tone implying a relationship between Han Yu Fan and Mo Yu Rou. Tang Ning was described to a martyr. She was analyzed and declared to be suppressed, until in the end, she angrily forced out her voice. She was often made to be the one shouldering the scandals, but for a mistress to come in and \u2018from the main room, enter the inner chamber\u20192 was truly an insult.The topic was loudly argued, and the photos of Mo Yu Rou and Han Yu Fan were quickly passed around. Netizens at that moment knew about Tang Ning\u2019s lack of black material. Even if they were dug out, what happened three years ago, and in the photos of her as a top model, she was still one of the most beautiful locally.For such a woman to give up because of love, and never fight for themselves for even a second. That even if it escalated into becoming a scandal, they immediately apologized instead, committed to all responsibility\u2026 they all misunderstood Tang Ning! Mo Yu Rou and Day Arts actually did such a thing and suppressed the poor woman.The situation once again began to reverse\u2026 countless users who denounced Tang Ning began to feel guilty and decided to firmly stick by her side regardless of the black powder3.At that moment, Mo Yu Rou was still in the middle of another interview.\u201cWhat can you assess about her shamelessness\u2026\u201d \u00a0The reporter asked, but suddenly, her companion handed her her phone. The reporter who saw it, quickly held the phone high enough and asked Mo Yu Rou, \u201cMiss Mo Yu Rou, is this photo true?\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Mo Yu Rou\u2019s face suddenly became pale.\u201cThis is a photo of you and the president of Day Arts Entertainment being intimate, can I ask you what you are doing inside that photo?\u201dMo Yu Rou was frozen\u2026 in front of the camera, the poor, crying lady suddenly turned into a seductive mistress, one who hurled false accusations at other people. Someone who had an exterior of depending on people occupying high seats, a delicate model, they were actually the same.More importantly, she could not say anything! The reporters saw her frozen, pained face. \u201cSo this photo is true, you are only falsely crying, while grabbing someone else\u2019s boyfriend, right?\u201d The female reporter suddenly sharply asked her.\u201cNo\u2026 not\u2026\u201d\u201cThis photo is crystal clear, do you still deny its validity?\u201d\u201cReally it\u2019s not, not\u2026 this is Tang Ning\u2019s plot,\u201d Mo Yu Rou blocked the reporter\u2019s lens, suddenly becoming embarrassed. \u201cDon\u2019t film this anymore, leave already, I won\u2019t accept anymore interviews, so go!\u201dThe reporter coldly snorted and continued questioning Mo Yu Rou with her voice full of scorn, \u201cMiss Mo, although everyone in this industry is used to it, I would just like to say something. People accept Heaven\u2019s law, that is, the natural order of things. Even if Tang Ning stood up and took all the blame, after this news has gotten out, I will have revealed your true nature.\u201dMo Yu Rou was now trembling. \u00a0As soon as the reporter left, she immediately called Han Yu Fan.\u201cYu Fan, did you see the photos? What do we do?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a photo, why are you panicking? The company\u2019s PR\u2026\u201d Han Yu Fan said calmly, but\u2026 he did not imagine that his heart could not be calm because of this. Because of the exposure, not only would it affect Mo Yu Rou\u2019s future, but also the future of Day Arts Entertainment, and let him lose Tang Ning. After all, suppressing Tang Ning, and his infidelity, for him, was usually two different concepts.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely Tang Ning tricking everyone behind this.\u201d\u201cIf you didn\u2019t bully her, would these things happen now?\u201d With that, Han Yu Fan angrily hung up the phone, and dialed Tang Ning\u2019s number. If it was in the past, then no doubt, Tang Ning would answer the phone. In fact, Tang Ning was currently holding her phone, but\u2026 when she imagined Han Yu Fan looking anxious, she decided not to answer the phone.When Mo Yu Rou rushed out of the ward, Tang Ning quietly hid in a corner waiting for Mo Ting\u2019s people to pick her up. However, she did not expect Mo Ting to come get her in person.\u201cTang Ning, let\u2019s go on the train.\u201dWhen Tang Ning heard the low voice, \u00a0her uneasy heart was quickly calmed down. The phone was still vibrating, but she was already in the back of Mo Ting\u2019s sedan.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to take the call?\u201d Mo Ting asked, showing a glimpse of his good nature.\u201cYou already know the answer,\u201d Tang Ning laughed. Her purpose was to make Han Yu Fan look for her all night, and have a taste of her suffering.\u2013!\u2013!\u2013!\u2013Hi~~ I\u2019ve updated, once again! Wow am I glad I got this chapter out.

Tang Ning stared at his right ear lobe, like a piece of artwork, adding to his devilish charm.\u201cWith how you\u2019re looking at me, are you inviting me to kiss you? Hold you? Or\u2026\u201dTang Ning nervously but firmly drew back, before she reached out to hold Mo Ting\u2019s arm. This way, she also avoided the awkward situation.\u201cBefore we go to our new home, can you accompany me somewhere else?\u201d\u201cAfter we do, tonight, will we finish last night\u2019s matter? En?\u201d Mo Ting asked. His tone was quite frivolous as he poked at her. Tang Ning was unable to bury her nervousness, because she knew that she would not be able to gather up the courage she had the night before. Mo Ting did not speak anymore and let her hold his arm, but the way his mouth curled in the dim lighting reminded Tang Ning of yesternight\u2019s events.They did not go to Mo Ting\u2019s home yet because of Tang Ning\u2019s request, and instead went to Beijing\u2019s famous cherry woods. She and Han Yu Fan had often gone there in the past on their dates, but today, she had thoroughly kicked Han Yu fan away from her heart. Finally, she answered her phone, her voice low, \u201cI\u2019m at the cherry forest, the one we agreed to meet at in the past so if you want to talk to me, at that old place\u2026I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d Han Yu Fan immediately agreed. Although he and Mo Yu Rou were already together, he never had any intentions of abandoning Tang Ning. How he could he find anyone better than her to cheat on? Frankly before, he already had his mind set on becoming a couple with her, as she could help him financially.Tang Ning hung up the phone, and glancing over to Mo Ting, she said sincerely, \u201cthis is the last time. I\u2019m calling him now because of personal reasons, but in the future\u2026\u201dMo Ting raised his eyebrows, but he did not speak. He pat the seat next to him before motioning to Tang Ning who was by his side, showing his possessiveness of her.Tang Ning obediently leaned on him as they drove, eventually arriving at the restaurant. Through the transparent glass from the second floor they could see an anxious figure appearing by the cherry blossom tree.Han Yu Fan came!Once, how many times had she been so dim-witted, standing in the place where Han Yu Fan was, waiting for him for even a whole day, before realizing \u00a0in the end that she was stood up?Now that she was really thinking about it, she gave him her whole heart, and still he did as he pleased with her, therefore\u2026 standing her up, toying with her, betraying her\u2026! She dared Han Yu Fan to try that again.\u201cIt\u2019s like this that you can dissolve the hatred and regret in your heart?\u201d Mo Ting asked Tang Ning.\u201cOf course not, for me, no matter how big or severe, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough!\u201d Mo Ting\u2019s finger slid across her cheek to her jaw, holding her chin high. He looked at her in the eyes. So when this delicate woman was emotionally hurt, she pursued the matter of revenge quickly and neatly. Putting on false airs with her would be a grave mistake.\u201cI just ordered foie grass. The waiter said it was flown from France, so I assume it must be good,\u201d Mo Ting said, letting go of Tang Ning\u2019s jaw as he revealed a hint of a surprised smile.\u201cHow do you know what I prefer to eat?\u201d\u201cTo know my husband\u2019s preferences, what\u2019s so difficult about that?\u201d Tang Ning reminded the waiter to serve the dishes soon so they could eat while talking.Mo Ting looked at her with hunger in his eyes, revealing a trace of danger before he said, \u201chowever, I do not want to merely chat with you, I just want to kiss you!\u201dWho said he was the number one toxic in the entertainment industry? Obviously in front of this woman, whose toxicity was high as well, it really made people get addicted of her presence.Downstairs Han Yu Fan waited patiently, while upstairs Mo Ting and Tang Ning dined together. As they did, Tang Ning avoided mentioning her career, and Mo Ting understood her intentions. But from her coping abilities, this little woman was really not weak at all.Still though\u2026 even if she was not weak, she was his, Mo Ting\u2019s wife, and as long as she was his then Tang Ning could never be bullied by someone else.Soon, an hour passed. Han Yu Fan who was waiting downstairs felt impatient, but he still did not dare to take even one step to leave. During this period, he kept on calling Tang Ning, however she already turned off her notifications. What he didn\u2019t know was that in the eyes of Tang Ning and Mo Ting, he was the equivalent of a janitor for them.Finally, the couple finished eating. Mo Ting looked at Han Yu Fan who was still downstairs and asked Tang Ning, \u201care you going to continue watching him?\u201dShe shook her head. \u201cNo, but can you please help me go home now?\u201dMo Ting nodded before checking out the bill, and with Tang Ning by his side the two left. Upon reaching Tang Ning\u2019s apartment, she asked him to wait for five minutes before coming in. Coming in, Mo Ting saw that there was no pictures of Han Yu Fan and Tang Ning.\u201cMo Ting, please wait for me here, I just need to clean something up.\u201dMo Ting looked around Tang Ning\u2019s apartment, stopping on a picture in her living room, where she was a holding a trophy with the title \u2018first\u2019. If she hadn\u2019t retreated that year\u2026 she would have long been famous in the world as a model.Five minutes later, Tang Ning came out of her bathroom, holding a teddy bear.\u201cThis is all of my belongings.\u201d\u201cThis is everything?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t take anything that makes me reminiscent, they can just stay in here,\u201d Tang Ning shook her head firmly, but then suddenly Mo Ting hugged her, before pressing his lips to her. At first, Tang Ning was surprised, but then she closed her eyes and relaxed into the kiss, before stopping when Mo Ting\u2019s hand brushed against her skirt.\u201cYou can do at home anything else you need to do, but at this moment, my kiss is a new memory made here, is that better?\u201d Tang Ning leaned into his chest, feeling his calm breaths. She decided that after this, she wouldn\u2019t let people hurt her anymore, everything that belonged to her, she would grasp firmly with her own hands.Han Yu Fan, on the other hand was still waiting for Tang Ning after four hours by the cherry tree. At first he intended to wait until she came, but\u2026 he finally received a call from Mo Yu Rou, \u201cYu Fan, where are you? I\u2019m here in your home, but I can\u2019t find you\u2026 I feel uncomfortable\u2026 Yu Fan, the scandal with that photo, why hasn\u2019t it been suppressed yet? I felt scared that I might be ruined because of that.\u201dWith that, Han Yu Fan instantly sobered up. He immediately drove home. Upon seeing Mo Yu Rou standing miserably by his door, one foot stepped inside, he immediately embraced her.\u201cI won\u2019t let you be destroyed, and I won\u2019t let Day Arts be destroyed either.\u201d\u201cYu Fan, I only have you, as well as our children\u2026\u201dHan Yu Fan soothed Mo Yu Rou, gently patting her back. He ordered the public relations team to improve the situation overnight, to tell others that the truth was that Mo Yu Rou\u2019s right leg was injured and Han Yu Fan was only helping her. It wasn\u2019t like the photography made it look to be, that they were\u2026 kissing.What was most important of this though, was that Han Yu Fan continued to sacrifice Tang Ning, alluding that she was the one behind this situation, and that the public shouldn\u2019t be easily mislead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the next three days he used every method he could to clean up Mo Yurou's professionalism and image - again, his intention was to continue throwing the blame on Tangning. After all, gossip like this usually only lasted a few days before the public became bored. Once new news gets released, this little scandal would just disappear into the depths of everyone's memories. It wouldn't be long before Mo Yurou would be able to return to work.Their plan was to help Mo Yurou win the Top Ten Model Awards and then announce she would be going overseas to study. At that time, she could sneakily give birth to their child. The only reason Han Yufan was willing to accept the child was because Mo Yurou was his first love and she had stayed by his side patiently for many years. On top of everything, Mo Yurou currently had a promising future, so he wasn't going to give up on this money tree.Tangning's manager had an expression of irony as she looked at the PR news Han Yufan had released. She sneaked over to Tangning's home and let herself in since she had the keys, but to her surprise, Tangning wasn't home.So, out of uncertainty, she decided to give Tangning a call, \"Tangning, why aren't you home?\"Tangning was in the middle of filling up a bathtub for Mo Ting. She let out a chuckle, \"I haven't had the chance to tell you...I moved houses.\"\"Where did you move to? Is it safe? Does Han Yufan know?\"Tangning turned around and looked at Mo Ting who had just entered the bathroom. Just as she was about to explain, she was interrupted by Mo Ting, who didn't realize she was on the phone, \"Stuff like this, you should have left it to the maid...\"On the other side of the line, Long Jie listened attentively. She heard the voice of a man and immediately asked in a high pitch voice, \"Tangning, who are you with? In order to upset Han Yufan, have you used extreme measures? I knew it, who would give a helping hand to a retreated model during this time of chaos. You...you're really frustrating me, is someone supporting you?\"\"Where are you? I'll come get you...you don't need to stoop so low...\"\"Where are you? I want to see you right now, or else I'll die!\"Tangning didn't know what to do. She looked over at Mo Ting as she covered the mouthpiece on her phone and asked for his opinion, \"My manager seems to have a misunderstanding regarding my moving houses. So...I need to pop out for a little to explain to her.\"\"Do you trust her?\" In actual fact, Mo Ting had already investigated Long Jie in private. She was passionate and professional - even though she was often simple-minded and far from being a top manager - but she was loyal to Tangning and was a helpful person to have around.\"Uh huh.\"\"Then let me immediately go pick her up.\"Tangning thought about it carefully. She understood what Mo Ting meant and trusted his judgment. She was no longer the Tangning from the past that would allow others to play games right before her eyes. So, she told Long Jie she would be sending someone over to pick her up from her old house.Long Jie sighed, giving off a sense of disappointment.Tangning smiled as she hung up. She put down the phone and turned to Mo Ting, \"I've filled the bath, are you going to bathe yourself now?\"Mo Ting raised an eyebrow as he re-buttoned his shirt, covering up his attractive collarbone, \"We have a guest, the man of the house must be present...most importantly, I want to bathe...with you.\"Tangning blushed, but...nodded shyly....Long Jie was extremely frustrated, she felt it wasn't worth it for Tangning to give up so much for Han Yufan. She especially couldn\u2019t believe that Tangning had willingly thrown herself at a man when there was obviously no true love in the entertainment industry. Most people in the industry just wanted one night of fun \u2013 the next day they would pretend they don\u2019t know each other. How could she be so silly to take part in something like this?Long Jie was fuming as she walked back and forth cursing under her breath until Lu Che arrived at the house and saw Long Jie, \"If you want to see Miss Tang, come with me.\"Long Jie was familiar with Mo Ting, however\u2026she didn\u2019t recognize Lu Che at all. So, she wasn\u2019t very friendly towards him. She lifted her leg and gave him a kick, \"If anything happens to my precious Tangning, I will paralyze both you and your boss.\"Lu Che held his tidy hairstyle in place, the sudden kick made it hard for him to keep his image as his face screwed up in pain, \"Let\u2019s not talk about who\u2019s going to paralyze who, come with me first.\"Long Jie gave a \"hmmph\", raised her head and glared at Lu Che as she boarded the car with him. Throughout the entire journey, Long Jie tried to test Lu Che by threatening him with all different methods, even mentioning Tangning\u2019s family background. All that was missing was a knife to his neck. Finally, as the car pulled up into the estate, Long Jie finally grew silent in shock.Hyatt Regency, this was one of the landmarks of the city of Beijing.This estate only housed 30 households. Each household was rich and powerful. Just simply searching up the background of any random house in this area would make the average person speechless.\"He...he....who the hell is your boss?\" Long Jie felt weak at her knees.\"You will find out once you go inside,\" Lu Che replied in an annoyed tone. He too had a bit of a temper.Long Jie\u2019s heart nearly jumped out of her chest in fear as the fire inside her subsided - whoever was inside was definitely not someone she would dare mess with. Not long after, the car swerved in through a metal gate that surrounded a beautiful villa with a fountain out front. Long Jie was escorted out of the car and into a Spanish palace-style living room.Tangning was sitting on the sofa wearing comfortable white home clothes, she didn't have any makeup on, but she was just as beautiful as ever.\"Tangning, what is all this? Did you find yourself a rich old man?\" Long Jie asked in a hushed whisper as she approached Tangning, \"Did you sacrifice yourself for the sake of Han Yufan?\"\"Long Jie, there\u2019s something I need to tell you. But\u2026you can\u2019t be upset.\" Tangning pulled Long Jie onto the sofa next to her.\"Speak\u2026did you find a new boyfriend?\"\"No\u2026\" Tangning shook her head, holding back a smile.\"That\u2019s good\u2026\"\"I\u2019m married.\"Long Jie: \"\u2026\"After a couple of minutes, she suddenly burst out, \"What did you say? You\u2019re married? Who did you marry? Why would you play games with your happiness?\"While Long Jie was questioning Tangning, Mo Ting had just finished dealing with some business issues and appeared out of the study room upstairs. To Long Jie\u2019s surprise, he walked over to just behind the sofa, leaned over affectionately and whispered gently into Tangning\u2019s ear. Tangning turned to face Mo Ting and nodded obediently, \"I know, I won\u2019t take longer than half an hour.\"Mo Ting was pleased with her response. He observed Long Jie for a moment and headed back upstairs. Everything that happened in this short moment was enough to make Long Jie freeze in disbelief.\"Tangning, quick, pinch me. I want to know if I\u2019m dreaming.\"\"Why?\" Tangning tugged at her to bring her back to her senses,\"So, the person you married is the CEO of Hai Rui Entertainment, Mo\u2026Ting?\"\"Uh huh.\"\"For real?\" Long Jie asked again to confirm.\"You\u2019re not seeing things, it\u2019s him, my new husband,\" Tangning nodded seriously.After hearing her answer, Long Jie went from extreme sadness to extreme happiness. \"No wonder your article stayed at the top of search rankings and Han Yufan had no way of removing it no matter how much money he spent. Tangning, this is such a great surprise!\"\"You\u2019ve made the right decision! If you\u2019re going to get married, it definitely can\u2019t be with trash like Han Yufan. I just never thought you would actually marry the CEO of Hai Rui Entertainment. Hai Rui is on a whole new level than Tianyi! So refreshing\u2026this completely cures my hatred. If Han Yufan was to find out, how satisfying would that be?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She gave off a confident and dazzling aura, \"With the help of Mo Ting, I know my career would advance in leaps and bounds, but, other people would only acknowledge me as Mo Ting\u2019s wife and not Tangning the model. 3 years ago, I managed to become the top model in Beijing, now, 3 years later, I am confident I can do it again with my own ability. I will retrieve what originally belongs to me.\"\"Long Jie, if you are still willing to help me, then we are going into this together. If you don\u2019t want to, I won\u2019t pressure you. I will help you cancel your contract with Tianyi and help you find a job at a better company.\"\"What nonsense are you speaking? Of course I want to stay by your side. I want to become the top manager of an international supermodel,\" Long Jie replied confidently, \"But, are you planning to stay at Tianyi Entertainment?\"\"What do you think?\" Tangning gave Long Jie a look, letting her figure the answer herself, \"Han Yufan has used me so many times. No matter what\u2026I will pay him back for it.\"After hearing what Tangning had to say, Long Jie burst out laughing as she leaned on Tangning; her shoulders shaking from laughter, \"Tangning, I realized all these years I have known you has been a waste, I never knew you could be so sneaky. So what\u2019s the next move, what should we do? Release the video?\"\"No\u2026let\u2019s secure a spokesperson deal. To be precise, let\u2019s take what originally belonged to me right out of Mo Yurou\u2019s hands. Afterwards, Mo Yurou\u2019s fans will definitely complain. The video should be released at that time!\"\"Long Jie, you will need to work hard for a little longer. Help me edit the clips from the Crown\u2019s Star show and post it online.\"\"OK, no worries! Leave it with me!\" After hearing the plan, Long Jie\u2019s eyes lit up as she nodded her head. Most importantly, she had discovered Tangning was different - she used to be weak and fragile, but, who would have thought, when triggered, she would be this powerful.After their conversation, Tangning asked Lu Che to escort Long Jie home, before she got up from the sofa and headed back into the beautifully scented bedroom. Mo Ting had just changed into a robe and was sitting on the sofa enjoying a glass of red wine. His chin tilted up giving him a more defined jawline like a perfectly carved sculpture; making one\u2019s heart flutter.Tangning was nervous but still walked over to sit beside Mo Ting. Mo Ting continued sipping from his glass, when suddenly\u2026he reached over and grabbed onto her shoulder as he placed his lips against hers. He still had the wine in his mouth as he shared the aromatic flavor with Tangning.Tangning was caught off guard as her face flushed red. Mo Ting laughed gently as he kissed her on the tip of her nose, \"If you can\u2019t drink you will be at a disadvantage when invited to events, you need to train\u2026\"Tangning pushed her body against Mo Ting's smooth chest, \"In that case, President Mo, what do you propose?\u2019\"Drink a small glass every day, what do you say?\"\"Using the same method as just then?\" Tangning raised her eyebrows with a slightly provocative look.Mo Ting couldn\u2019t help but let out a gentle laugh as he nodded, \"Did you like it?\"\"Uh huh,\" Tangning nodded.\"Let's do that then.\" After he spoke, Mo Ting once again raised the glass to his lips. Using the same method, he once again leaned over, but this time\u2026.after they had finished drinking the wine, they did not separate. They continued to kiss passionately as they treated the sofa beneath them like a bed.As Mo Ting's intermittent kisses slowly made it's way to other parts of her body, Tangning could feel her body shaking, she could no longer think straight. Never had she experienced such an electrifying feeling making her whole body weak like sand. In the heat of the moment, all she could see was Mo Ting's handsome nose bridge and his soft lips, but, she could feel his strong arms, and...\"Mo...Ting...let's go to the bed, I don't want to do it...on the sofa.\"Hearing her plea, Mo Ting suddenly stopped. Looking down at her long slender legs, so beautiful like the tail of a mermaid, he held in his desires as he wrapped Tangning in a bathrobe. He lifted her up and took her into the bathroom, placing her gently into the bathtub.\"What is it?\"Mo Ting wrapped a towel around his body and kneeled before Tangning. He lifted her chin and spoke, \"I want your heart first. When I am the only person in your heart, I will make you completely mine.\" After he finished speaking, Mo Ting stood up, but, Tangning reached out her hand to grab hold of his towel.\"I do not dislike...us...doing this. Do you still not trust me?\"Mo Ting patted Tangning gently on the head, calming himself down at the same time, \"I really want you...you don't know how attractive you are, but, I want all of you; body and heart...I want to wait for you to be certain.\"Tangning nodded, holding onto Mo Ting's left hand, \"It's been a long time since someone has treated me with respect.\"Mo Ting understood what she meant. Even though he wanted to crush Han Yufan into pieces...Mo Ting had faith, Tangning would be able to depend on her own abilities to get what she wants....The next morning, the scandal between Tianyi\u2019s two models had already been replaced by the new headlines of the day. While at the same time, Han Yufan and Mo Yurou\u2019s rumors had been covered up by Tianyi\u2019s PR - the hype of entertainment news had always dissipated as quickly as it appeared. However\u2026due to Tangning\u2019s responsible attitude of standing out and taking on all blame, she had gained herself a huge number of new fans. These fans were now searching online for Tangning\u2019s old appearances and photos\u2026No one noticed, Tangning at this moment, was slowly making a comeback.Especially during the Crown\u2019s Star Show, Tangning\u2019s performance had definitely surpassed all the current hottest models. Her new fans felt it was unfair for Tangning to go to waste, so they all started sharing her videos online, while contacting hf. After seeing the videos of Tangning, hf was amazed by Tangning\u2019s beauty. In particular, after seeing Tangning\u2019s multitude of photos and poses, the designer that had got angry at Tangning on the day of the show suddenly realized how well Tangning matched his jewelry....it was like they were made for each other.hf\u2019s designer pondered for a little bit. His judgment was previously affected by Tianyi\u2019s lies, but now that he had time to calm down and think about it, Tangning\u2019s elegance and professionalism was definitely better suited to the theme of the Crown\u2019s Star.Also, because of Tangning\u2019s attitude towards admitting wrong, hf had developed a sense of trust towards her.So, the higher-ups of hf quickly gathered together for a meeting to discuss swapping the spokesperson. In the end\u2026they came to a consensus. A phone call was made to the office of the president of Tianyi Entertainment.\"Mr Eugene, Yurou is almost recovered from her injuries. The release of your new product definitely won\u2019t be delayed\u2026\"\"No, I\u2019m not calling about that. Mr Han Yufan, we would like to swap spokesperson. We would like to swap Mo Yurou for Tangning!\" he said in perfect English.After hearing the request, Han Yufan didn\u2019t know how to react, \"No, Mr Eugene, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right\"\"We haven\u2019t officially signed the contract yet. If you are not willing to swap for Tangning, we\u2019d rather cancel this collaboration and look for another company to work with.\"\"We have other models, ones that are more famous than Mo Yurou\u2026.\"\"We only want Tangning.\"Mr Eugene was set on his decision, leaving Han Yufan with no choice but to agree. However, this deal was originally Mo Yurou\u2019s means of securing the Top Ten Model Awards, who would have thought Tangning would end up benefiting instead. With this change, Mo Yurou was definitely going to throw a tantrum.The news quickly spread to Long Jie: hf had made a call to Han Yufan\u2019s office requesting to swap spokesperson. So, when she spoke to Tangning on the phone, she was exceptionally excited, \"Tangning, Tangning, you got the deal!\"\"Don\u2019t get ahead of yourself, Mo Yurou isn\u2019t going to let this happen so easily.\" Tangning didn\u2019t let her guard down, even though she had the situation in the palm of her hands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To him, if his company received the hf spokeperson deal, even the lowest ranked model wouldn\u2019t bat an eyelid. But, to Tangning, it meant she had successfully retrieved what belonged to her from Mo Yurou. So, he immediately made a phone call to Tangning, \"You did well.\"Tangning gave a gentle laugh and then gratefully replied, \"To be praised by you makes me happier than anything else.\"\"I will wait for you\u2026to get back to the number one spot.\"This time, Tangning simply responded with two words: \"I will!\" It was time to return to Tianyi to face Mo Yurou\u2019s ugly attitude.At the time the word was being spread, Mo Yurou was still sleeping sweetly in Han Yufan\u2019s home. Last night, she had run directly from the hospital to Han Yufan\u2019s home and used guilt to hold on to him for the entire night \u2013 not letting him make any phone calls to Tangning. Anything she had in her grasp, others\u2026shouldn\u2019t dream of taking \u2013 especially Tangning, who always seemed to be against her.Her assistant was impatient and flustered as he reached the house. He opened the news for Mo Yurou to see and her first reaction was one of disbelief, \"hf\u2019s spokesperson was already set, there\u2019s no way they could change it.\"\"Yurou, this is real. President Han received a phone call from hf this afternoon. They personally told him they wanted to swap the spokesperson to Tangning, or else, they would rather work with another company.\" Her assistant pointed to the news in front of them with an urgent and angry expression, \"What exactly did Tangning do? If she wanted to secure a deal, why did it have to be your deal?\"\"Let\u2019s go back to the office. This incident, I want Yufan to give me an explanation in person.\" Mo Yurou knew that if she was to discuss the matter with Han Yufan over the phone or at home, he would somehow sweet talk his way out of it. So, she decided to return to the office and face the issue head-on, this way he would be forced to deal with it professionally.Meanwhile, Han Yufan was already bruised and battered. hf were so determined to directly swap Mo Yurou for Tangning, but he knew this was going to hurt Mo Yurou greatly. However, did he have the right to say no? In the end, he wasn\u2019t going to go against money.Just as Han Yufan was thinking of a way to comfort Mo Yurou; Mo Yurou, with the aid of her assistant, entered the room in a wheelchair. She arrived just before Tangning with a difference of a few hundred meters.\"Yufan, what is all this? How could the spokesperson deal, that belonged to me, get taken by Tangning?\"Han Yufan gestured for his assistant to leave the room. As soon as the room was left with just the two of them, Han Yufan approached Mo Yurou and embraced her in a hug, \"Yurou, this was beyond my control. I\u2019ll help you secure an even better deal.\"\"You know as well as I do that Mr. Eugene from hf is the brother of Miss Erin, who is one of the judges at the Top Ten Model Awards. This deal was really important to me and most importantly, how could you hand it over to Tangning?\" Mo Yurou angrily pushed Han Yufan away, her voice was shaky. \"She already stole you from me, wasn\u2019t that enough? Why does she have to fight over everything with me? I don\u2019t care\u2026if I lose this deal, then I don\u2019t want this child. I won\u2019t stay at Tianyi either.\"\"Don\u2019t speak out of anger,\" Han Yufan tried to control her temper, \"How could you give up on our child so easily? You know that I\u2019m on your side, however, this time, hf was determined\u2026\"\"Tangning\u2019s already given up so many times in the past, what\u2019s another time? She\u2019s about to get married to you, why does she need the deal anyway?\"After hearing Mo Yurou\u2019s reasoning, Han Yufan felt it made sense. According to Tangning\u2019s personality, she had given up her chance at a lot of things in the past, one more time wasn\u2019t going to matter to her. He was certain she would agree, so he comforted Mo Yurou, \"I will speak to her about it. Don\u2019t be angry, OK?\"Mo Yurou bawled her eyes out as she fell into Han Yufan\u2019s arms. At this time, there was a knock on the door; Tangning and Long Jie had returned to the office.Mo Yurou immediately held back her tears and distanced herself from Han Yufan, looking at him like she was being treated unfairly. Until Tangning pushed open the door and entered the room.\"Tangning, where did you go last night? Did you know I looked for you all night?\" Han Yufan asked one question after another.Tangning glanced at him and then at Mo Yurou.\"It\u2019s all a misunderstanding between Yurou and I. I\u2019ve already released a statement to clear it all up. Don\u2019t make a fuss over it, will you?\"Tangning looked away without a word. She knew very well what Han Yufan meant by \"looking for her all night\". He had obviously been searching so hard he ended up searching in bed with Mo Yurou. Otherwise, there was no way he wouldn\u2019t have noticed she no longer lived in her original home.\"Too bad, the issue with Miss Mo and I isn\u2019t a misunderstanding\u2026\" Tangning spoke calmly, \"I helped her so many times, yet she turned around and bit me. In both your eyes, am I that easy to bully?\"\"Tangning, Yurou was worried there were reporters around, so that was the only thing she could do!\"\"Really?\" Tangning questioned suspiciously.\"Regardless, this incident is over, let\u2019s not dwell on it. As for the hf spokesperson deal, how about you return it to Yurou. This deal is very important to her. You\u2019ve already retreated and won\u2019t be doing any shows, so\u2026you have no use being spokesperson,\" Han Yufan said straightforwardly with the tone of a superior, forcing Tangning to hand over the deal back to Mo Yurou.\"Exactly, Tangning, you haven\u2019t done a show for so many years, you\u2019re not even familiar with the stage anymore\u2026\" Mo Yurou added, \"On top of everything, the deal was originally mine anyway. hf must have thought, since I was injured I wouldn\u2019t be able to recover in time, that\u2019s why they chose you. You don\u2019t want to be a substitute, do you?\"\"These words, coming from Miss Mo, sound a bit ironic,\" Tangning responded coldly forcing Han Yufan to snap back, \"Tangning, you weren\u2019t like this before. If you still love me, you wouldn\u2019t take on this deal. For the sake of the company\u2019s future, we need Yurou to win the award so we can elevate our company\u2019s standing in the industry.\"Han Yufan\u2019s words obviously carried a threatening tone. He had gone so far as to use love as a reason.Listening up to this point, Mo Yurou was laughing on the inside. She knew Tangning would do anything for Han Yufan, let alone give up a deal.\"Yufan, quick, give hf a call. Let them know Tangning is too busy planning her wedding and can\u2019t take on any new jobs\u2026\"Han Yufan nodded reaching for the phone. But, just as he grabbed hold of it, Tangning stopped him, \"The deal\u2026I have already accepted it.\"\"Tangning!\" Han Yufan exclaimed in shock, Tangning had never gone against any of his decisions before.\"Don\u2019t forget, I am also a model of Tianyi Entertainment. Actually, I\u2019ve already spoken to hf\u2019s founder, Mr. Eugene, and he is looking forward to working together.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The power of decision-making stands with me, not you!\" Han Yufan was filled with anger as he looked at Tangning, \"Why must you take Yurou's deal?\"\"You think I took the deal just because I wanted to? hf requested for the swap. I was just worried in the end, we would be left with nothing, so I tried to hold on to the contract for you. Originally, I didn't believe any of the rumors regarding you and Mo Yurou, but the fact that you'd rather make a loss than have her lose her spokesperson deal, makes me wonder if the two of you...\"\"Of course not! What are you thinking?\" Han Yufan immediately denied any relations, \"I just felt that since we are about to get married, why can't you just stay at home and look after our family?\"\"Then, will you go explain to Mr. Eugene?\" Tangning loosened her grip on the phone. She had a look of disappointment, \"Also, what do you mean by I TOOK the deal from Mo Yurou? Haven't I allowed her to take enough from me? For the sake of helping her, I've already offended everyone...who would have thought, in the end, she wouldn't even acknowledge my kindness...\"\"Tangning, at that time, you were the one that suddenly announced you were retreating from the limelight, hence your jobs were given to me. What do you mean by you allowed me?\" Mo Yurou was not backing down as she started an argument with Tanging - the thing she hated the most was people saying she cleaned up after Tangning. \"Also, with your ability and popularity right now, if you were to say you allowed me to take anything from you, no one would believe it.\"\"Fine, if you are able to convince Mr. Eugene into changing his mind, then I step down. No comments.\"Han Yufan was stuck in a difficult position between the two women. Most importantly, Tangning was still angry, or else she wouldn't have disobeyed his orders - something she had never done before. hf had indeed requested for the spokesperson to be swapped to Tangning, so, in the end, Han Yufan stepped in and split the two apart, \"Stop arguing, since it was hf's request, then we will just go with what's been decided. The spokesperson will be swapped to Tangning.\"\"President Han!\" Mo Yurou whined.\"It's decided. The two of you can leave first. Tangning, ask Long Jie to come in,\" Han Yufan ordered coldly. It was obvious that, although he had no choice but to swap to Tangning, he hated the feeling of being stepped all over by her.Tangning was clever and knew exactly what Han Yufan was thinking, but, if he was expecting her to carefully consider his feelings......he was dreaming!Mo Yurou followed closely behind Tangning, she was boiling up inside and it was obvious from the expression on her face, she could barely control her anger. Luckily, even though Tangning appeared to be making a comeback, in actual fact, she wasn't very popular. If she was to tear down this outdated model, it would be too easy. So, she turned to her assistant and said, \"In a moment, take a few photos of me working hard to recover and post them online. Let's create some commotion amongst my fans and get them to complain that Tangning has stolen my deal. If I can't have it, I won't let her have it.\"\"Don't worry, I know what to do,\" her assistant nodded knowingly....After returning to her room, Tangning looked at Long Jie and winked, \"Don't be nervous.\"\"Nervous? Are you kidding me? Who do you think I am?\" Long Jie rolled her eyes, \"It's not my first day on the job. If Han Yufan wants to tear me down, it's not that easy. Let's wait and see...\" As she spoke, Long Jie walked out with a fierce expression. Previously, Tangning had not pushed to advance, but now, the situation had changed. Long Jie no longer had to hold back.Not long after, Long Jie made her way into Han Yufan's office and Han Yufan threw a contract in front of her without hesitation, \"Prepare to compensate us for breaching your contract and leave.\"\"Leave?\" Long Jie laughed, \"President Han, you must have a bad memory. When I first signed my contract with Tianyi, my salary and Tangning's appearance fee was clearly stated. However, all these years, Tangning's appearances had been overtaken by Mo Yurou and my salary was nowhere near what was promised, so who breached the contract first? Plus, the article I released was all for the sake of Tangning, so which part of the contract did I breach?\"\"You...\" Han Yufan couldn't believe he was being told off by a manager. His pride was hurt.\"If you aren't afraid of making things worse, we can always take things to court, it doesn't matter to me. But, how many people in the industry will lose trust in Tianyi Entertainment?\" Long Jie asked in a provoking manner.\"What do you want then?\"\"I want us to end on a good note. I will sign the papers and leave, whereas you will not continue asking for any compensation. From this moment on, we don't owe each other anything!\"Han Yufan glared at Long Jie angrily, but, because Mo Yurou was involved, he couldn't argue back. Earlier on, when Long Jie and Tangning had met, they had already predicted this would happen. So, in the end, Han Yufan had no choice but to sign the papers. \"Leave, I don't want to see you again.\"\"Han Yufan, let me give you a warning: there is no wall thick enough to block out everything. The way you have treated Tangning, you will soon have to pay it back a thousand times.\" After speaking, Long Jie left the office with the canceled contract in her hands. Han Yufan, who was left standing in the room thought about the words Long Jie had said, in anger, he grabbed the table in front of him and flipped it.Tangning wasn't worried about Long Jie at all. After all...it was so easy to find flaws in the contract. Most importantly, Han Yufan was strewn with guilt.After canceling the contract, Long Jie didn't leave the building, instead, she stayed by Tangning's side. When Han Yufan eventually left his room, they ran straight into each other, \"Why are you still here?\"Tangning froze for a moment, before she replied, \"I've just hired Long Jie!\"\"Tangning, your manager contract is managed by the company, how could you hire a new manager?\" Tangning was driving Han Yufan crazy.\"Oh, I didn't hire a manager, I hired her as my assistant. It's my right to hire my own assistant, isn't it?\" Tangning smiled calmly, \"After all, Long Jie has taken care of me for so many years, I've gotten used to it.\"\"Tangning, what's wrong with you? Why do you keep going against me?\" Han Yufan pulled Tangning to one side and asked her angrily.\"Because Long Jie is more thoughtful than you, everything she does is for my sake. Just because I took on a deal, doesn't mean she would accuse me of stealing from others...\"After hearing this, Han Yufan went silent, looking at Tangning coldly, \"Tangning, you've always been supportive of my career...why are you like this?\"\"I've said it before, the incident with the Crown's Star would be the last time I take on the blame for both of you.\" Tangning remained calm, so calm that her eyes were emotionless.\"If you really want to be this childish, I think, our wedding...should be called off.\" Han Yufan used their wedding as a means to threaten Tangning. After all, all these years, Tangning had been the one that stuck by his side willing to do anything.Quite some time passed...Tangning remained silent like she was contemplating...Han Yufan assumed she had given up and was regretting going against him...But, who would have thought, this would be Tangning's response...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then we won't do it...\" Tangning smiled, \"Let's wait until you are no longer busy, we can talk about it later.\"Like this, Han Yufan was flustered. He reached out his hand and placed it overbearingly onto Tangning's shoulder. With an angry look in his eyes, he asked, \"Do you not love me anymore?\"\"What about you? Do you love me?\" Tangning carefully slipped out of Han Yufan's grasp; she had promised Mo Ting she wasn't going to have physical contact with another man.Han Yufan was stunned. He opened his mouth, but no words came out, because, towards Tangning, he had never had any feelings - he was only using her. He slowly relaxed his hands, \"We are already at the stage of getting married, why would you question our love? You will become my wife soon, can't you think on my behalf? It wasn't easy for Yurou to be nominated for the Top Ten Model Awards. Tangning, I'm just annoyed that you can't be more understanding.\"Tangning slowly distanced herself from Han Yufan. She remained composed, \"Then from now on, you may have to get used to how I am now.\" After their conversation, Tangning left Han Yufan standing there alone as she left the building.Han Yufan was puzzled, he didn't understand why Tangning's attitude had changed so much. But, after careful thought, he assumed she was still jealous of him and Mo Yurou. However, he didn't have the energy to go coax her. After all, Mo Yurou was still in need of comforting and Tangning had never been one to make others worry. After her anger subsides, things would most likely go back to normal.She had always been so useless, without any temper to even stick up for herself.Tangning knew Han Yufan wasn't going to chase after her - her heart had already given up on him. Instead, she was quickly hurrying home to see Mo Ting. At the thought of Mo Ting, Tangning's heart felt like it was suddenly lit up by a bright light.\"Tangning, I'll take you home first so you can recharge your batteries. Tomorrow, we will be signing a contract for you to shoot on location,\" Long Jie said happily to Tangning.\"Long Jie, cancel the lease on your home and move over to my old home. Give my home a bit of life. You can change the locks as well. If Han Yufan asks, just say you have moved over to take care of me and it is no longer convenient for him to have the keys,\" Tangning suggested. \"Tomorrow, I will sign a new contract with you.\"\"OK...works for me, this way I can save some money.\" After their conversation, Long Jie looked at Tangning with an ambiguous smile, \"The mighty president of Hai Rui Entertainment, how is he in that aspect?\"\"Don't be so nosy, ok?\" Tangning replied, staring into Long Jie's eyes.After returning home, Tangning had a lot of free time since Mo Ting was still out for the day. She headed for the kitchen and found the servants cooking. Lifting up her sleeves, she offered, \"Let me help!\"\"Madam, how could we trouble you?\" The chef in charge of the meals was a middle-aged woman over 40. She liked Tangning as she gave off a peaceful vibe.\"How about this, you rest for the day and allow me to cook for Mo Ting tonight.\" Tangning led the chef out of the kitchen.By the time Mo Ting arrived home, it was already late at night. However, as soon as he entered the house, the first thing he did was look for Tangning. Wearing an apron and standing in the kitchen barefooted, Mo Ting found Tangning concentrated on cooking. Mo Ting was surprised as he stared at her quietly. He was immediately attracted by her long slender legs. He walked straight over to her and hugged her from behind as he gently kissed her on the ear.\"President Mo, don't muck around, I'm cooking fish...\"Mo Ting reached over and turned off the stove. Lifting her chin, he went directly for her lips, \"But, right now, I just want to eat you up...\"Tangning put down the kitchen utensils in her hands and turned around to hug Mo Ting, clumsily returning his kiss. His soft touch captivated her and as she noticed the charming mole on his ear she became completely infatuated.Mo Ting's kisses were intermittent but gentle, inching slowly down her body, eventually returning to her collarbone where he stopped, \"Any lower...and I wouldn't be able to control myself.\"\"Fish...I need to finish cooking the fish.\" Tanging pulled away from Mo Ting's lips, once again lighting up the stove, finishing off what she had started. Mo Ting chuckled and reached his hand out to pat Tangning's head as he admired her creation.\"Let me help you.\"\"President Mo can cook?\" Tangning asked raising her eyebrows.\"Today, I'll allow this. But, from now on, no more entering the kitchen. I don't want you to get hurt.\" Mo Ting was protective of Tangning, especially her legs, inside he was even considering buying insurance for them.\"So controlling...\" Tangning commented, but, deep down she understood it was because he cared.The married couple prepared dinner quietly - it turned out, they were both great chefs. Tangning cooked Mo Ting's favourite dish, while Mo Ting cooked Tangning's favourite dish. Without difficulty, the dining table was soon filled with a satisfying feast.In perfect sync, the couple looked at the dining table amazed. After all, enjoying life like this couldn't be done by just anyone.\"Tomorrow, I might have to go to Liusen for a photo shoot. I most likely won't be able to return home,\" Tangning reported to Mo Ting honestly.\"Aren't you signing the contract tomorrow? Will you be leaving straight away in the afternoon?\"\"Uh huh, hf's new product launch is urgent,\" Tangning nodded. \"Mo Ting, give me a bit more time. I will definitely rise to a position you are proud of.\"\"I've never doubted you.\" Mo Ting placed some food in Tangning's plate. Their eyes met, both looking at each other admiringly.Of course, Mo Ting was most looking forward to seeing Tangning slowly advance and how miserable Han Yufan and Mo Yurou would be....After a windy night, it started to shower lightly.Upon returning to Han Yufan's home, Mo Yurou grabbed everything she could and threw it on the ground, breaking them into pieces. Especially when she thought of Tangning signing the contract tomorrow, her heart could not accept it. Worst of all, Han Yufan had actually helped Tangning - this was the most unbearable thing for her.Han Yufan threw open the door to find a shocking scene in front of him. He spotted Mo Yurou standing with a vase in her hands. Immediately, he ran over and embraced Mo Yurou in a hug, \"Don't be so upset, it's not good for the baby.\"\"I'm surprised you know it's bad for the baby, even though you just watched as Tangning stole my deal.\"\"We still have plenty of chances. I'm already working on securing an even bigger collaboration. Stop paying attention to Tangning. Even if she was to become spokesperson, what would come of it?\" Han Yufan continuously patted Mo Yurou on the shoulder, \"Babe, listen to me, don't hurt yourself.\"\"Even if you do this, I'm still not convinced.\" Mo Yurou raised her head with tears in her eyes, \"She's held on to you for so many years, I will definitely not allow her to have what she wants.\"In reality, she had already ordered her assistant to create a commotion among her fans and she was already seeing results. Her fans had already started discussions about tearing down Tangning and were throwing insults at her.If she was to lose, she wasn't going to allow Tangning to win.Most importantly, she ordered her assistant to post up the details of Tangning's schedule tomorrow, giving anti-fans the opportunity to cause trouble to Tangning.Did Tangning really think it's so easy to be a spokesperson? Tomorrow, she will become the airport's number one shameful and stupid model.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed, regarding the war between Tangning and Mo Yurou, hf had chosen Tangning's side.3 years had passed since Tangning last attended an event like this - she had almost forgotten how it felt. But, as soon as she put on her creamy white low-back dress and the jewelry that hf had sponsored her, she was once again glowing with confidence.Long Jie left the house nice and early to drive over to Hyatt Regency. As she was Tangning's assistant, Mo Ting had given her special permission to enter their villa as she pleased. She had originally prepared a dress for Tangning...but when she entered the huge walk-in wardrobe Mo Ting had given to Tangning, she couldn't believe her eyes.\"He is indeed the president of Hai Rui, generous with good taste!\" Long Jie praised.At that exact time, Mo Ting came out from his own wardrobe. As soon as he saw Tangning he turned to Long Jie, \"I have something I need to say to Tangning.\"\"OK, I'll step out for a bit.\" Long Jie turned around understandingly and closed the door as she left.Tangning stood in front of the mirror smiling sweetly at Mo Ting; fresh and elegant like a blooming lily. It was hard for one not to turn all their attention to her.\"What do you want to say to me?\"Mo Ting didn't say a word, instead, he took big steps towards Tangning and hugged her from behind. He then turned her neck so he could cover her mouth with his, \"I want to kiss you and even more...I want to adore you.\"\"I'm going to be late.\" Tangning also didn't want to part with Mo Ting's lips.\"I will watch the live broadcast...\"Tangning nodded her head with satisfaction. She hooked her arm onto Mo Ting's as they walked out of the villa together. Truthfully, anyone looking at the couple would believe they were a perfect match. Tangning was like white snow emanating a sense of pureness, whereas Mo Ting was alluring like a dangerous dark night.Long Jie was captivated by the sight of the couple, this was how a married couple should look like...unlike Han Yufan the jerk, who would not be so pleasing to the eye.A little while later, Tangning boarded the car with Long Jie's assistance. On the way, Long Jie spoke while driving, \"The contract signing will be at 9am, we should arrive at 8:50am - just right.\"\"Your arrangements have always been on point.\" Tangning looked down and swiped her phone.\"The plane will be at 3pm and Mo Yurou has arranged for anti-fans to stop you at the airport. Among her fans, they have discussed a plan to make you look bad. One of them will find the chance to embarrass you and others will pretend to be passersby aiming to skew the judgment of onlookers.\" Long Jie screwed up her nose in disgust, this was something primary school kids did and unfortunately, childish acts like this always seemed to hurt others the most.\"All this information, how did you find out about it?\" Tangning was quite surprised.\"Because I have Xiao Hao hiding amongst them...\" Long Jie hummed proudly, \"We'll just let these kids be happy for a bit...after the video is released, we'll see whose face gets slapped harder...\"Tangning laughed as she shook her head. Mo Yurou certainly had the ability to gather anti-fans. In comparison, her number of active fans looked pitiful. However, there were still a few that were looking forward to her appearance at the airport.8:50am, right on time, Tangning arrived at the hotel where the contract signing was to take place and walked down the red carpet in front of the reporters.Long Jie had selected to arrive at 8:50am because any earlier, Tangning would have devalued herself. At the same time, she had to make sure they wouldn't be late, so Long Jie timed everything perfectly.\"Tangning, after your public apology, you disappeared. When you appeared again, you took Mo Yurou's contract, was this all part of your plan?\"\"Mo Yurou released photos of her working hard to stand up again this morning, is she accusing you of stealing her deal?\"\"Tangning, are you planning to make a comeback?\"Tangning smiled the entire time without responding to any of the reporters' questions. After entering the hotel, she listened carefully to hf's arrangements and cooperated accordingly.On the other hand, Han Yufan, who was originally meant to attend the signing couldn't attend because he was busy, so Tangning was accompanied by her assistant instead. This gave the public the impression that Tangning and Tianyi Entertainment were on bad terms. However, Han Yufan was indeed busy - busy being held back by Mo Yurou. There was no way she would allow Han Yufan to attend the signing and support Tangning.Hai Rui Entertainment. Mo Ting was sitting in his office watching the live broadcast. On screen, Tangning didn't appear demanding; she was quiet and beautiful but was hard to ignore. As the contract signing reached it's end, Mo Ting phoned his assistant through the intercom, \"This afternoon, send 4 bodyguards to protect Tangning all the way until she boards the plane.\"\"Yes, president...\"Mo Ting knew, regarding this spokesperson deal, on the surface everything seemed to be smooth sailing, but in actual fact, there were rough seas ahead.After the contract signing, Tangning and hf's founder sat down for lunch together. 1pm, Tangning left the hotel to head directly for the airport...the closer they got to their destination, the more nervous Long Jie became, \"Tangning, I will try my best to protect you, you also have to protect yourself.\"\"Long Jie, do you think I haven't prepared myself?\" Tangning smiled as usual. Right now, everything was within their control, what was there to fear? 3 years ago, she already experienced everything.Not long after, Long Jie got out of the car first. After taking the luggage out, she assisted Tangning out as well. At first, no one noticed the two of them. However, as soon as they stepped into the airport, a bunch of fans ran over with flowers to greet them. The flowers were shoved into Tangning's hands, but before she could grab hold of them, the flowers and other gifts fell to the floor.In an instant, everyone was stunned. Wearing sunglasses and face masks, her fans were disappointed upon seeing their gifts being mistreated, \"Tangning, what is the meaning of this? We gave you flowers because we like you, how could you throw it on the floor? Even famous celebrities wouldn't dare treat their fans like this, let alone someone like you who isn't famous yet!\"Tangning knew these guys were here to cause trouble, so she immediately apologized, \"Sorry, I didn't get a grip yet. It wasn't on purpose!\"\"As if it wasn't on purpose, it was obvious that was your intention!\"\"I saw it too! You threw it away deliberately.\"The anti-fans were sparking up speculation amongst passersby as they started to speak up, \"Just on your personality alone, how can you compare to Yurou? Yurou always greets her fans with a friendly smile, offering to take photos with them. Did you think, just by signing one contract, you would be able to replace her?\"More and more people crowded around and the number of curious people increased. In an instant, Tangning had roughly over a hundred people surrounding her.Because of the increasing number of people, the anti-fans decided to initiate the second step of their plan. Gathering the crowd closer, they started to push and shove Tangning around, \"Why do you think Yurou has stayed famous for 3 years while you became old news. I've realized now, it must be because you have a bad personality. Look how nice Yurou is in comparison.\"\"Give the contract back to Yurou!\"\"I agree...originally, I quite liked you, but you actually went ahead and threw the flowers your fans gave you onto the floor. You can't compare to Yurou even a tiny bit. You don't deserve to take Yurou's contract. What schemes did you use? Tell us...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They felt Tangning was shameless - to them Mo Yurou's character was much more trustworthy.Tangning was completely surrounded, leaving her with no room to escape. So, instead, she calmed herself down and removed her sunglasses, revealing her bare face to the public, \"If you want me to answer your questions, I can do that, but first, can I ask you a few questions?\"\"Go ahead.\" The anti-fans looked at Tangning wondering what trick she had up her sleeves.\"You say you are my fans, so can you tell me, what year did I debut, what year did I receive awards and what awards were they?\"After hearing her questions, the anti-fans looked blankly at each other. How could they know this information about Tangning - they despised her.\"We...we are new fans. Regardless, you threw our gifts on the floor, so you are in the wrong,\" one of them responded.\"Whether or not I threw the flowers on the floor, even if I was to not explain, I'm sure the airport's cameras would have captured everything. But, I already apologized immediately after dropping them, I'm sure everyone heard. I've also previously acknowledged, within the industry, there is still much to learn from Yurou. So, what else are you not happy with?\" Tangning spoke gently, not forceful at all, but straight to the point. This girl that was causing trouble definitely wasn't her fan. It was obvious she was the fan of Mo Yurou, who's name hung to her lips.The fact that Tangning had already apologized and responded with a modest attitude, the majority of passersby were starting to change their minds...they felt that Mo Yurou's fans were petty and had gone too far.\"Fine, it's true, I am also a fan of Yurou's. We just feel you don't deserve to be compared to her. On top of everything, you even stole her contract, you should return it to her!\" After speaking, the anti-fan started to push Tangning. Tangning staggered and almost fell. Luckily...the bodyguards Mo Ting sent arrived just in time, squeezing through the crowd to hold onto her. They also started to separate the crowd from Tangning.Long Jie couldn't hold in her anger anymore. She stood between the anti-fans and Tangning as she turned her head slightly, \"You go ahead first and wait for me, I'll be right there.\"\"OK.\" As usual, Tangning didn't argue. She just simply put her sunglasses back on.\"Hmmph! If you don't give us an explanation today and don't return the contract back to Yurou, don't even think about boarding the plane.\" The anti-fans warned as they linked their hands forming a human barrier.\"Do you really believe in Mo Yurou's character that much?\" Long Jie asked with a deeper meaning.\"It's definitely better than that of your cheap model's.\"\"These words, I've recorded it...\" Long Jie raised her phone, \"When the time is right, I'll send you all a huge gift.\" Long Jie placed the phone to her head and called the police. The police immediately arrived to escort Tangning away from the crowd with the help of Mo Ting's bodyguards. Tangning quickly disappeared from the view of the public, but before the police left she whispered something to them.\"Tangning, Mo Yurou has made the news about you stealing her contract the number one discussion,\" Long Jie looked at her phone as she spoke.\"Then, what are you waiting for? Release the video...\" Tangning replied while walking.\"I've been waiting for this moment...now those fans can see, whether their goddess is an innocent lady or a sl*t!\" After speaking, Long Jie phoned a reporter friend, \"Post up the video we prepared earlier.\"Han Yufan, let's see how many times you can save Mo Yurou!...Tianyi Entertainment's Artists' Resting Lounge. Mo Yurou was celebrating that the discussion she started had hit number one. On top of that, she received photos from her fans of the scene at the airport; Tangning had been pushed to the point where she couldn't even fight back - it completely satisfied her hatred. She wanted Tangning to have a taste of what it's like to steal her contract. This was only one of the consequences, the worst was yet to come.\"Yurou, after this heated incident, I'm sure you will get even better deals than the one offered by hf,\" her assistant flattered as he massaged her shoulder.\"Of course! I have to secure a place at the Top Ten Model Awards!\" Mo Yurou smiled confidently, her confidence was due to the fact that Han Yufan had reassured her earlier on. As promised, Han Yufan appeared at the doorway all of a sudden holding a contract to discuss with her.\"Quick, my Top Ten Model, a big advertisement is here, let's hold a meeting immediately.\"Mo Yurou nodded her head; she was exceptionally pleased as she headed into the meeting room to discuss the details.\"Although Yurou lost the contract with hf, she has managed to secure a deal with an international makeup brand. She is indeed Tianyi Entertainment's precious gem!\" Han Yufan showered Mo Yurou with praises, \"As for Tangning, from now on, if anyone asks for her, respond by telling them she is getting married and won't be taking any more jobs.\"After hearing these words, Mo Yurou's smile grew even larger. However...just as the two were conversing with their eyes, Han Yufan suddenly received a phone call. At first, he had a smile plastered across his face, but afterwards, the smile disappeared, \"Mr Blair, how could you cancel the contract all of a sudden?\"\"The indecent video of you and Mo Yurou has already gone viral, I am extremely ashamed of the two of you. What rubbish!\" with that, he hung up the phone angrily.\"What happened?\" Mo Yurou asked.\"The advertiser has requested for a solution.\" While he was speaking, Han Yufan pulled out his phone - at the top of search rankings was a video of him and Mo Yurou in the hospital bed getting intimate! This time it wasn't just a photo, it was a video! It was a video that they couldn't deny! Seeing his reaction, Mo Yurou immediately stormed over and grabbed the phone from his hand. Upon seeing the video......she was so stunned, she dropped the phone onto the floor, \"How could this happen? How...?\"Everyone in the meeting room immediately picked up their phones to see what was going on, while Mo Yurou, like being caught on-the-spot cheating, started yelling at everyone, \"Don't look! Don't search!\"\"It's over...everything's over...\" Han Yufan angrily plopped down into his chair, \"Who is it exactly that is trying to go against me!\"Apart from Tianyi Entertainment's internal departments, Mo Yurou's official page was also in an uproar. It was only today that they put all their trust in Mo Yurou and stormed over to insult Tangning, but...now they felt like they had been slapped across the face.At this time, Long Jie and Tangning had already boarded their flight. Long Jie was logged into Mo Yurou's fan club, watching as the anti-fans self-destructed, \"I never thought Mo Yurou would be so cheap, while we unknowingly idolized her, we must have been blind. From now on...I've lost all respect for her.\"\"Me too...\"\"Me too...\"\"We should take the initiative and prove Tangning's innocence. At the airport, we had deliberately insulted her, she must have known. However, she never tried to get back at us. Instead, while the police were stopping us, she even told them not to hurt us...I heard it all, but I didn't announce it!\" one of the fans said guiltily.\"Also, Tangning's schedule was given to us by Mo Yurou's assistant, we need to post about this.\"After seeing the discussions, Long Jie's mouth was curving from ear to ear...so satisfying!That sl*t and jerk must be running around in a panic right now.\"Tangning, why are you so smart? I really love you,\" Long Jie wrapped Tangning in a hug as she planted a kiss on her cheek.\"But, I don't love you...\" Tangning replied, looking down at Long Jie teasingly.\"Then who do you love? President Mo?\"Tangning was indeed thinking of Mo Ting and was especially missing his kisses...habit, definitely was a scary thing, especially poisonous habits.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since Han Yufan and Tangning were an engaged couple, the video revealed Mo Yurou was a third party that had stepped in between the two, so she quickly became a hated homewrecker that everyone cursed under their breaths.At this time, a member of the media stepped out to reveal that the Crown's Star substitute incident was all Han Yufan and Mo Yurou's idea and Tangning was forced to innocently take on all the blame.The netizens were in an uproar.Later that day...even bigger news was released regarding the incident at the airport.Tangning was previously criticized for disrespecting her fans, resulting in disgust from passersby. But, after Mo Yurou's indecent video was released...Mo Yurou's Official Fan Page posted up a statement clearing the entire incident of Tangning's fault. It was revealed that the fans had planned the entire incident beforehand and they even pointed out it was all because they wanted to stick up for Mo Yurou. Luckily, they had now realized, the idol they were protecting, was not worth it.On top of everything, evidence was posted up of Mo Yurou's assistant privately providing details of Tangning's schedule to the fan club. Records of the discussions that took place in planning for what happened at the airport was also posted.In the end, a clarification letter on behalf of Tangning was released clearly explaining that Tangning hadn't thrown the flowers on the floor. They also praised Tangning for being polite and sincerely apologizing even though she knew she was being slandered. Most importantly, when she was being protected by the police, she caringly asked the police not to be so rough, in case they hurt someone.This was released by Mo Yurou's Offical Fan Club, which meant Mo Yurou's fan club had now become a defeated army. Even her biggest fans had now turned their back on her, how was anyone to trust Mo Yurou ever again? The media continued to be negative, fans stepped all over her, even companies that had previously used Mo Yurou as a spokesperson immediately took down their ads and sent out letters from their lawyers.Seeing all this, Mo Yurou knew...she was over...she was completely over!\"Yurou, you need to remain calm. You still have the child in your stomach. With this child, you don't have to be afraid that President Han won't obediently listen to you. Even if in the end, you can no longer be a famous model, at least, you can still be the wife of Tianyi's CEO.\" Mo Yurou's assistant tried to calm her down after seeing her throw everything on the floor, \"Don't damage your body, there's still a long road ahead.\"Hearing this, Mo Yurou agreed with her assistant's reasoning. Even if Tangning was to make a comeback, so what? With the child in her stomach, she still had a chance to win....As soon as she stepped off the plane, Tangning received a phone call from Mo Ting. Long Jie also immediately searched up the progress of the ongoing battle. Their odds were looking good, it didn't seem like the tramp had any chance of a comeback.\"Should I congratulate my wife on a victorious battle?\" Mo Ting was sitting on his office chair as the contours of his face were highlighted by the rays of sunlight coming in through his office window. He looked handsome as usual.Tangning laughed gently and responded with a cheeky voice, \"Must you congratulate me every time I make a move?\"\"Can't you tell? I'm just looking for an excuse to give you a call...\"Tangning's heart fluttered. \"Too bad I can't come home tonight,\" she responded in a quiet whisper.\"If you tell me you miss me, there might be a miracle,\" Mo Ting teased. \"Do you want to try?\"\"Even if there was no miracle, I would still miss you,\" Tangning replied seriously, but because she was embarrassed, she hung up the phone before Mo Ting could give a response. On the other side of the phone, Mo Ting gave a muffled laugh as he immediately called Lu Che on the intercom.\"Help me organize flights to Liusen, as soon as possible. While you're at it, pack all the documents I need to sign so I can take them onto the plane with me.\"Tangning had no idea there would be a surprise.After disembarking the plane, she went straight to the location of her shoot. As her contract included print ads, even though it was already night, she still entered the studio.Alongside her, there were a few foreign models that would be in the ad as well. Every one of them were extremely professional. Upon seeing Tangning standing around with no expression, the photographer was suddenly worried whether she would be able to meet expectations. The print ad required the model to be snapped in the spur of the moment and had a high degree of difficulty. Within a second, the model had to express emotions that suit the product; this was a real test of a model's acting abilities.Unfortunately, Tangning's body was hidden by the long dress she was wearing, so no one could see her positive features. It was not until she changed and stepped out that everyone could finally see her perfectly proportioned body. Everyone in the studio was stunned, whether it was her height or her measurements, everything met international standards.With her casual black patterned A-line dress, paired with a sleeveless dark denim jacket, she was completely exuding sexiness.But her expression...The photographer was still worried, so immediately walked over to Tangning to explain, \"The photos we are taking today will have a slightly wild style, like a wild cat out for a stroll at night...\"\"I understand,\" Tangning nodded calmly.The photographer didn't explain any further. Asian models had always been of this quality, there was no point expecting too much.\"Come, everyone get in position. Let's start with some solo photos, Jason!\"The models that were called each walked up to stand in front of the screen. Quickly and professionally, they all completed their shots - Tangning was last. Because she was last, she was under extra pressure. After all, in terms of appearance, she couldn't compare to the foreigners. If her acting wasn't up to speed, the whole shoot could easily be foiled.\"Tangning!\"Upon hearing the photographer's call, Tangning walked in front of the screen wearing hf's bracelet from their 'Charming Night' collection. The photographer continuously explained how she should pose to achieve a wild look, but Tangning just smiled as she nodded understandingly. One thing the photographer hated the most was people that pretended they understood when they didn't. So, he spoke a few words before grabbing his camera and taking a few steps back, \"Let's just try a few test shots to see how it turns out.\"\"No, it's OK, let's just do it,\" Tangning requested.Seeing her confidence, the photographer anticipated seeing a joke. In aggravation, he warned, \"You asked for it. Once I start, there won't be a second chance.\"\"OK,\" Tangning answered in her usual calmness.The other models all felt Tangning was digging her own grave; she had obviously been given a chance yet...she didn't want it, what was she thinking?\"\"Then, let's get started...\" The photographer waved as he looked at Tangning without much expectation.Tangning nodded, then......while everyone was gathered around waiting to watch her embarrass herself...in a split second she entered into a different state of mind, surprising all onlookers. They watched as she naturally spread her legs apart, wrapped her left hand around her right hand's wrist and gently spread apart her lips. As she bit the middle finger of her left hand, in an instant, everyone was stunned by the look in her eyes - it was so threatening...compared to the weak persona she had earlier on, it was like she had turned into a completely different person!What impressed everyone the most, was the bracelet on her wrist, which appeared to be supplying her with this wild energy - she and the product went perfectly together, like they had completely fused into one...The photographer was speechless...where did hf find this gem? This level of professionalism was comparable to that of an international supermodel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, no matter if Tangning had to act lazy, seductive, threatening or cute, as long as the photographer asked her to change poses, she immediately suited whatever theme was thrown at her; her reactions were so quick that everyone watching was amazed.Long Jie was standing to one side. Upon seeing Tangning return to the Tangning she once knew, she was so emotional she almost cried out loud.Apart from tearing up, she also pulled out her phone to take photos of Tangning's various poses; she intended on forwarding them to Mo Ting. Because of Tangning's relation to Mo Ting, Long Jie felt extremely fortunate to have someone so mighty in her phone contacts.Of course, at this time, Mo Ting was still on the plane...In the 4-hour photo shoot session, Tangning managed to convince the photographer and a few others in the industry with her professionalism. Even Mr. Eugene, who had previously told Tangning to leave, couldn't help but give her a thumbs up. He even personally explained to Tangning that he couldn't control his emotions last time because he was so angry about being lied to.After removing her makeup, Tangning returned to her expressionless self. Meanwhile, everyone was extremely happy with her, making Mr. Eugene's impression of her improve dramatically.Long Jie hurried over to cover Tangning with a jacket. At the same time, she handed over the flashing phone in her hand, \"Han Yufan is calling...\"Tangning's expression didn't change, her gaze just darkened a little, but she still picked up the phone, \"Hello?\"\"Tangning, have you seen or heard any news?\" Han Yufan asked, treading lightly.\"Why?\" Tangning asked, pretending to be calm. \"What happened?\"\"Oh, it's nothing!\" Han Yufan was sure Tangning hadn't found out yet since she was in Liusen. So, he hatched up a plan, \"Tangning, how about I fly to Liusen tomorrow. We can register our marriage there, it's perfect. The scenery is beautiful and the atmosphere is lovely, we can even take advantage of this opportunity to have a holiday. It could be our honeymoon!\" Han Yufan wanted to quickly trap Tangning.Actually, Tangning wasn't born into an ordinary family. She was the daughter of a famous perfume empire, but, because of her relationship with Han Yufan, she had a falling out with her family. They were on such bad terms, they practically cut all ties and refused to see each other again. But...in the end, she was still a Tang. When the Tang elders pass away, she would still have the right to fight for the inheritance.Han Yufan didn't want to let go of Tangning, not only because Tangning was naive and easy to fool, but one of the most important reasons...was the inheritance.Since his and Mo Yurou's video had been released, he could only take advantage of the fact that Tangning hadn't realized yet, to quickly force her to marry him.\"Under the suspicious relationship between you and Mo Yurou, I don't think we should get married yet!\" Tangning refused straightforwardly.\"There's really nothing going on between Yurou and I. The photos you saw were all a misunderstanding...\"\"If the photos are a misunderstanding...what about the video?\" Tangning questioned in an extremely calm tone, \"I am indeed in Liusen, but...Liusen is still in the same country, did you really think I wouldn't be able to see the news? Or did you think I was really that easy to coax and trick?\"\"Tangning...I didn't do it on purpose, trust me. We've been together for so many years, don't you know what type of person I am?\" Han Yufan acted innocent, trying to get pity, \"It was all her one-sided love, the person I love is you.\"\"Then...what if I was to say, if she remains in Tianyi Entertainment then I would leave or if I was to remain, then she would have to leave?\" Tangning asked decisively.\"Tangning, I always thought you were the one that understood me the most, why must you pressure me like this?\" Han Yufan was a bit upset because he didn't want to give up on either side. Mo Yurou was his first love and was pregnant with his child, whereas Tangning...Being put on the spot, Han Yufan couldn't decide what to do.\"If you feel like I am pressuring you, you are free to go look for Mo Yurou, she's very understanding.\"\"Must it be like this?\" In actual fact, Han Yufan had already decided to give up on Mo Yurou. After all...Mo Yurou's family background was quite average. The only reason she had got to where she was today, was because he had pushed her to that position. If he was to compare her to Tangning, she at best, was just the type to play around with, \"Give me some time to speak to Yurou, afterwards we will get married immediately.\"\"I'll be waiting.\" Tangning appeared to respond calmly, but her words contained hidden feelings of contempt.How could someone like Mo Yurou let go of Han Yufan that easily? She even has a child on the way.Long Jie looked at Tangning's scornful look and immediately grabbed the phone out of her hand, \"From now on, we won't take any of his calls...saves us from ruining the mood.\"\"Let's return to the hotel, I'm tired,\" Tangning smiled like nothing happened.Long Jie nodded and immediately escorted her back to the hotel. Their rooms were next to each other. Long Jie opened the door for Tangning and comforted her, \"Have some rest...don't think too much, you still have an outdoors shoot tomorrow.\"\"Uh huh,\" Tangning nodded before closing the door. Turning around, she suddenly noticed the sound of water coming from the bathroom. \"Who's there?\" she asked cautiously.The person inside seemed to have heard her voice as he reached out and turned off the tap. Tangning was worried she had entered the wrong room, so quickly headed for the door. However, at that moment, a tall figure stepped out of the bathroom, grabbed her by the waist and embraced her in a hug, \"It's me.\"Tangning turned around to see Mo Ting. She was surprised for a moment, \"You...how...\"\"Didn't I say? There would be a miracle?\" Mo Ting loosened his grip before planting a kiss on her lips. \"Flying during the day is tiring, so I decided to have a shower first to relax...\"Tangning's mind was in a blur. Never would she have imagined, Mo Ting meant what he said. She immediately wrapped her arms around his waist.\"My dear wife...should I remind you...I'm not wearing anything?\"After hearing this, Tangning instinctively looked down as her face flushed red, \"Then you go continue your shower...\"\"But I want to go together!\" With those words, Mo Ting didn't wait for a response. He directly carried Tangning in his arms straight into the bathroom and placed her under the shower. Grabbing her chin, he planted a passionate kiss on her lips.\"Don't...don't be so rough, I still need to shoot an advertisement tomorrow.\" Tangning still had a little bit of awareness.Mo Ting smirked before moving downwards, \"What about here?\"Separated by a layer of clothing, Tangning trembled and soon lost her senses.Under the shower, the couple continued to kiss passionately and hug. But, as usual, before taking the final step, they were both already satisfied. After showering, one of them peacefully applied skin care, while the other leaned against the bed reviewing some documents. Glancing over at Mo Ting, Tangning's heart hurt a little, \"You're already here, yet you still have to work?\"Mo Ting nodded as he closed up the documents and waved at Tangning. When she finally sat down in his arms, he smiled apologetically, \"It's a habit.\"\"Am I not attractive enough? Today, Han Yufan called and said he wanted to marry me!\" Tangning complained sadly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked at her seriously with his ink-like eyes, \"I can barely control myself anymore...but...it's not enough. Even though we have already registered...I'm still hoping for you to get to know me properly and to be certain that you want to spend the rest of your life with me. When the time comes that we are both certain we want to be together - that's when we can truly belong to each other.\"\"In this industry, my options are endless, I can have whatever I want. The only thing I can't find...is a pure heart.\"\"Then...let's try hard and work towards the same goal - let's walk the same path and live the same life,\" Tangning replied seriously. \"I really never thought, President Mo - who is sitting high up above everyone else in the entertainment industry - isn't after a fun and carefree lifestyle. I thought you would be a player with a multitude of women; have you never wanted that?\"\"When a woman asks a question like this, there is no need to answer...all a man needs to do...is respond with a passionate kiss.\" After speaking, Mo Ting laid down a kiss, and just like he predicted, a passionate kiss indeed makes a lover forget all their worries. That night, embraced by Mo Ting's hug, Tangning slept extremely sweetly....Compared to Tangning's happiness, Han Yufan's day was definitely not going well. He was in a predicament due to Tangning's request for Mo Yurou to leave Tianyi Entertainment. Mo Yurou not only had his child in her stomach, in her hands she also had evidence of his bad deeds - he couldn't offend either woman.Full of uncertainty, Han Yufan drove back to his home. Upon seeing Mo Yurou sitting sadly on the sofa, his heart sank.\"Yufan...\" Mo Yurou cried as she flew into his arms, wrapping her arms tightly around his waist. \"What should I do? Does this mean I can't be a model anymore?\"\"Yurou...how about you go overseas temporarily to take care of your pregnancy? After our baby is born, you can return. When that time comes, I promise, I will do what I have done before - I'll make you famous again.\"After hearing his words, Mo Yurou froze in realization, \"You're asking me to go overseas? Han Yufan, are you planning to sacrifice me? Let me tell you, I'm not as stupid as Tangning to believe your words, I definitely will not go. Plus...Han Yufan, don't forget, my stomach still contains your child. I've already been your lover for so many years, do you really think you can just kick me aside like this?\"\"That..that's not what I meant...\"\"Han Yufan, think carefully, who do you want to spend the rest of your life with? Do you love Tangning?\"\"Of course I love you, only you!\" Han Yufan responded painfully, \"But, Tangning set out conditions: if you don't leave Tianyi, she won't marry me.\"\"Even if you marry her, you aren't guaranteed everything the Tang family owns!\" Mo Yurou reasoned. \"The Tang family doesn't care about Tangning. Even if she was to return to the household, how much would she be able to inherit? Yufan, do you really want to put all your eggs in the one basket, to find in the end you've gained nothing? Stay with me, at least you have me and our child...the three of us can build a future together, isn't that what you want?\"\"Yufan, think about it carefully...do you want me, or do you want Tangning? All I need is one word from you and I can go directly to the hospital to organize an abortion. I'll leave Tianyi and never appear in front of you again.\"Han Yufan didn't respond as he stood blankly in place.Seeing no response, Mo Yurou immediately picked up her phone to ring her assistant, \"Help me make an appointment at the hospital, I want to have an abortion...\"\"What are you doing?\" Han Yufan swiped the phone out of her hand, \"Don't be so impulsive, did I say I wouldn't be choosing you?\"Upon hearing his words, Mo Yurou's face lit up, \"Does that mean, you choose me?\"\"I love you the most and yet you want to have an abortion, how could I allow you to do such a thing? All these years, I've been protecting you, have you not realized?\" Han Yufan ended up settling on a decision - he decided to end things with Tangning. He just felt it was a pity to give up on the Tang family. But just like Mo Yurou reasoned, there was no guarantee for the future; he couldn't give up on Mo Yurou and his child over an illusion.\"I knew it, you've always treated me the best.\" Mo Yurou broke into tears of joy as she gave Han Yufan a big hug. \"I will definitely give birth to your child and make your sisters and mother happy.\"\"As long as you don't stir up any more trouble, I will be very thankful. Don't go online too much and don't listen to the insults online. News like this, will pass. Although this scandal will definitely affect the judges image of you for the Top Ten Model Awards...this award, is more focused on a model's professionalism, so we shouldn't give up on our goals.\"\"I will listen to you, however, there is one thing you must listen to me!\" Mo Yurou pulled Han Yufan onto the sofa next to her. \"Continue to freeze Tangning's jobs. Look at how arrogant she is right now. All because she secured a deal, she thinks she's all that and even tried to go against the company.\"\"But...\"\"Tianyi can live without Tangning. If we want to find a model, it's not hard,\" Mo Yurou stated. \"However, we also can't let her go. If she's given the chance, she will definitely seek revenge on us. We will hold on to her and freeze her, after three years is up, she will be so old she won't be able to make a comeback.\"\"But...at present, Tangning has a lot of people cheering for her and her feedback is really good.\"\"Doesn't that make things easier? Let's wait till she returns from Liusen...find her a corporate client, a brand that's low-end and disgusting, so her image declines.\"Han Yufan looked at Mo Yurou, he knew what she suggested was a bit extreme, but...Han Yufan couldn't refuse - he just simply nodded, \"I'll do as you say...\"\"Plus, all companies that want to work with Tangning, we will reply to them saying Tangning doesn't want to work with them.\"Han Yufan hugged Mo Yurou as he planted a kiss on her forehead. This time his decision came from his heart, he would end things with Tangning. After they end their relationship, Tangning would simply be a contracted model of Tianyi's with a term of 3 years remaining. Just like Mo Yurou had said, he had to prevent Tangning from becoming famous and finding a chance to revenge against them. So...from now on he could only continue to step all over her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tangning was supposed to film with a few other models, however...the photographer felt Tangning's presence was too strong; if there were too many people, they would only serve as a contrast to accentuate her. So, in the end, only one male model remained.Early in the morning, Long Jie knocked on Tangning's room door, however...when Tangning came to open the door, she appeared to be hiding something, not allowing Long Jie to enter. Long Jie immediately looked at Tangning as she asked, \"Is there someone else in the room?\"\"I...\"\"Tangning! How could you be like this? Although you have split up with that jerk, you only just got married to Mo Ting, how could you mess around like this? Let me in, let me in, let me see who's so brave to seduce my precious Tangning!\" Long Jie was a bit agitated; with her strength, she appeared to be ready to push open the door. However, at this time, Mo Ting reached out his hand to stop it. His tall and fit physique shrouded the two.\"Big Boss, it's you...\"Long Jie was stunned as she laughed awkwardly.Mo Ting glanced at Long Jie briefly, his gaze carried a sense of approval because, with her around, Mo Ting would be rest assured no man could get close to Tangning. So, without a word, he headed into the bathroom to shower.After seeing him leave, Long Jie rested on Tangning's arm as she spoke, \"Why didn't you tell me earlier? You made me embarrass myself in front of such an important person!\"\"I only found out last night when I returned to the room,\" Tangning shrugged innocently.\"Oh god! He's so romantic! Someone as busy as President Mo actually caught a direct flight to a place like this to keep you company. Tangning, your luck really has changed. Thinking about all those years you've spent with that jerk, when did he ever visit you at your work?\" Long Jie lit up, \"Indeed, there is a difference between different people.\"\"Are we still going to the location of the shoot?\" Tangning reminded, even though she acted like she didn't care the night before.\"Is President Mo coming?\"\"He should be coming,\" Tangning whispered.Mo Ting had come all this way, of course he couldn't miss watching Tangning's performance. The show at Hai Yi Centre was already unforgettable - he was looking forward to seeing how Tangning would perform at an outdoor shoot?30 minutes later, the three of them arrived at the location of the shoot. Because he couldn't reveal his identity, Mo Ting could only watch from afar. Tangning stepped out of the change room in a light blue lace dress which hugged her curvy body, highlighting her positive attributes, especially her long slender legs which looked like they had no limit - she looked perfect like a sculpturist's work of art.The theme for today's shoot was a bride chasing a runaway groom. While chasing, the bride injures her leg without the groom noticing. In the end, the sparkling diamond on the bride's hand creates a beautiful rainbow from the reflections of the sun's rays awakening the groom to the promises he made to the bride. Finally, the groom returns and the couple reconcile...\"Tangning, the emotions today change quite a lot, are you OK with that?\" The photographer from the previous day had become today's director and he asked Tangning out of duty.\"No problems,\" Tangning gently nodded.The director made an 'OK' gesture towards her before reminding her to get into position.\"Should we do a quick run-over?\"\"It's not necessary,\" Tangning straightforwardly turned down the director's suggestion. If he hadn't worked with Tangning before, the director may have doubted Tangning's abilities, but after seeing her professionalism the previous day, the director had complete trust in her. Hence, after she said it wasn't necessary, they just went ahead and started filming.Because the entire commercial had no script and took up only 30 seconds, the models were required to get into the right emotional state really quickly. The scene they were about to film, was the one where Tangning would be chasing. So, the expressions on her face had to show a sense of urgency; starting off looking hopeful and slowly changing to despair as she realizes she can't catch up...The filming was about to start. Without the help of anyone, Tangning found her position in front of the camera...as soon as the slate clapped down, Tangning disappeared. In her place, stood an abandoned bride looking around helplessly searching. Her eyes reddened, but no tears fell out. Most importantly, after running, she was detailed enough to add in some panting...Her emotions increased as she continued searching. The urgency on her face looked like she was almost at the brink of falling apart.Mo Ting watched from afar. He realized Tangning was like a dust-covered gem. No wonder, 3 years ago...she was able to come out on top. If she had never retreated back then, right now, how successful would she be?\"President Mo, our Tangning isn't bad is she?\" Long Jie's eyes contained an unconcealable pride, \"If only she wasn't held back by that jerk...\"\"From now on, no one will hold her back,\" Mo Ting responded coolly as he stepped his tall figure back into the car.Long Jie smiled knowingly because she knew Tangning wasn't going to give anyone the chance to hold her back ever again.And of course, she was even more convinced by the man in the car, because he was the owner of an empire.Because of Tangning's professionalism, the shoot ran smoothly, saving the director half a days time. The director was extremely impressed by Tanging, so he tried to offer her a solution to her rumored problems, \"I heard your current company has no idea how to plan out your career. Are you interested in stepping out onto a bigger stage?\"Tangning took the business card from the director's hands, but refused politely as usual, \"I am happy where I am right now.\"The director didn't pressure Tangning as he smiled at her, \"Even so, we will always welcome you.\"Tangning thanked him and started to head towards Mo Ting. But, Long Jie suddenly flew towards her holding out her phone exclaiming, \"Just then, there was a woman called Lin Wei that called, proclaiming she is the new manager Han Yufan has arranged for you. She also said, after you are finished with your shooting, you should return because Han Yufan has organized for you to make an appearance at an event. The date of the event will be 3 days from now. I've just done some research on the brand. Even though it isn't an unbranded product...many consumers have complained about them for years.\"\"Han Yufan obviously wants to destroy you!\"Tangning grabbed her phone from Long Jie as she remained calm, \"Let's head back first, we'll talk later.\"\"This is something you've worked hard towards, if you accept this job, all you've done would go to waste.\" Long Jie's heart broke for Tangning.\"Long Jie, do you think...I haven't prepared for something like this?\" Tangning sneered. She didn't expect Han Yufan to actually give up on the Tang family's background and choose Mo Yurou, \"I've said before, being in the lead and NOT being in the lead, is only a word of difference. The two outcomes are only separated by a thin line.\"\"I won't play the wrong cards again...\"Not far away, Mo Ting was sitting in the car. Their eyes met and they both smiled at each other. After Tangning boarded the car, Mo Ting handed his phone over to her, \"I asked Lu Che to search through the database for information regarding this lady called Lin Wei, who will be your new manager. Her resume and dark past is all in here.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Long Jie quickly waved her hands, signaling this had nothing to do with her.\"In this industry, as long as I want to find out, I can find out anything.\"By now, Tangning was no longer surprised. How else did Mo Ting manage to climb to the top? So, she smiled at him, \"Don't worry, you've already handed me the sword to kill my enemies, I will definitely finish it off satisfactorily.\"Mo Ting didn't respond, he just simply reached out his hand to touch Tangning's hair.Upon seeing their actions...Long Jie got goosebumps all over. These two, they've only gotten married not long ago, but how come they resemble a married couple that has been married for years?After the shooting was complete, the three of them returned to Beijing. Onboard the plane Tangning and Mo Ting leaned on each other affectionately, but as soon as the plane landed, they went their separate ways like strangers.Han Yufan had sent the new manager, Lin Wei, to pick them up from arrivals. At the exit, the female manager, Lin Wei, stood waiting. Not only was she wearing a light purple chiffon dress, standing on 10 inch high heels and wearing sunglasses, she was also looking continuously at the watch on her wrist. Her whole body exuded a sense of impatience, like as if the roles were reversed and she was an international superstar waiting to be picked up instead.Tangning noticed a sign with her name on it placed beside Lin Wei's feet. She decided to ignore it and headed straight out of the airport with Long Jie.Long Jie gave a muffled laugh; Tangning's slowly developing her own temper. Halfway through their journey, Tangning received a phone call from Lin Wei, \"Tangning, where are you? Isn't your flight suppose to arrive at 12?\"\"I'm already on the way back to the office,\" Tangning replied calmly.\"Didn't you see me when you came out of arrivals?\"\"I saw you,\" Tangning remained calm, not showing even the slightest emotion.\"Then why didn't you come to me?\" Lin Wei was furious.\"You were wearing sunglasses, I thought you were at the airport to perform a show...\" Tangning replied sarcastically.\"...\" Lin Wei's face was turning red from anger as she hung up the phone and rushed back to the office.She started off in the industry early, but her eyes were extremely short-sighted. Even though she had helped make a few artists famous, they always ended up either offending the powerful or being sent to rehab. So, as a manager, she didn't have a very good reputation in the industry. As for this time, Lin Wei was requested by Mo Yurou because she obviously wanted Lin Wei to handle Tangning for her. But, who would have expected, without even getting to see Tangning, she was made to look like a fool first.She was determined not to give up. After all, Tangning was, at most, an outdated model; how dare she not show any respect?...20 minutes later, Tangning arrived back at the office first. Upon entering the main entrance of Tianyi Entertainment, she headed straight for Han Yufan's room and threw the door open.\"I'm waiting for your explanation,\" Tangning exclaimed as she slammed both hands on the table, \"So, there really is something happening between you and Mo Yurou?\"Han Yufan stopped what he was doing, hesitated for a moment, then sneakily changed the subject, \"You just landed, how come you came straight here?\"\"How long has it been?\" Tangning continued with the same subject, \"How long have you and Mo Yurou been together?\"\"Tangning!\" Han Yufan suddenly yelled, \"I've had enough of you, do you know how annoying you are? Can't you do stuff that men like, like Yurou? What woman nags every day like you?\"Tangning slowly pulled back her hands and looked at Han Yufan questioningly, \"What do you two think I am? A toy?\"\"Tangning, let's break up...I am indeed with Yurou...and we are truly in love,\" Han Yufan spoke to Tangning like he was talking to a stranger that had no relation to him. \"You shouldn't blame me - there is no explanation for love. From now on we merely have a subordinate and superior relationship, I am your boss and you are my employee!\"Tangning sneered as she raised one corner of her lip; she was calmer than Han Yufan expected, \"So, I guess you're not planning to release me from my contract? You must assume, if you were to let me go, Mo Yurou will never succeed.\"\"Sorry...you still have to wait 3 years.\"\"Is this why you have organized for me to appear at that event?\" Tangning continued to question.\"For your current status, this event suits you perfectly.\" After speaking, Han Yufan returned to sit on his chair and flipped through some documents, \"If there isn't anything else, you can leave. Also, Lin Wei is your manager. From now on, you must follow her orders.\"Her 5 years of fantasy, were all wasted on a jerk!Tangning couldn't say her heart didn't hurt, but at this moment, she felt angry more.\"Do you know what happens to unfaithful people? - they won't have a happy ending.\" After saying these words, Tangning turned around and left Han Yufan's office. Of course, her determination to make Tianyi disappear from the entertainment industry for good, was stronger than ever.Tangning returned to her room. Meanwhile, Lin Wei had just returned from the airport. Without knocking, she walked straight into the room pointing at Tangning and yelling, \"Are you aware that from now on, you are my artist? Do you still want to be a model and take jobs? How dare you treat me like this...are you a pig?\"Upon hearing these words, Tangning suddenly got up out of her seat and slowly stepped towards Lin Wei, \"Repeat what you said, what were your last 4 words?\"\"I asked if you are a pig?\" Lin Wei repeated herself arrogantly. As soon as the last word left her mouth, Tangning's slap had already landed on her face, \"This slap is to put you back in line.\"Lin Wei was stunned. Her eyes widened as she prepared to fight back, however, Tangning pulled out her phone and handed it to her, \"I have plenty of indecent photos like this in my phone. Because of the 4 words you just said, I've decided to send them to the 4 biggest media companies.\"Lin Wei froze for a moment, not quite understanding what Tangning meant. Until she looked down at the screen to see a photo of her seducing a director. Her brain suddenly went blank!This can't be, how could Tangning have these photos? She was so careful...this was impossible, it had to be fake.\"I know Mo Yurou is behind all this. If you hadn't gone overboard, I wouldn't have bothered dealing with a simple manager like you, but...you don't seem to know who you're messing with...\"Lin Wei started to get scared as her hands began to tremble. If she had known Tangning was holding this information against her, she definitely wouldn't have agreed to Mo Yurou's request of making things difficult for Tangning.So, her face immediately changed as she knelt down, \"Tangning, I didn't mean to treat you like this, please don't release the photos, I will be over if you do...\"Tangning looked down at Lin Wei, \"The following words, I will only say once: I will not attack those that don't attack me first, but if someone attacks me...I will make it impossible for them to return from the depths of hell. From today onwards, do your job well and I'll do mine. If you want to scheme and play games...I'm happy to play along. But the consequences...won't be as simple as releasing these few photos...\"Tangning at this moment was vicious and domineering. Lin Wei didn't know how to react - didn't they say Tangning was a push-over?\"I understand. I know what I should and shouldn't do,\" Lin Wei was completely intimidated by the look on Tangning's face.After letting out some anger, Tangning's emotions pretty much returned to her normal calmness and her tone of voice was once again indifferent as she questioned Lin Wei, \"When do I have to appear on stage at the event?\"\"You...you're going?\" Lin Wei couldn't understand what Tangning was thinking.\"Just tell me when,\" Tangning repeated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wiping them away, she slowly stood up. She thought for a moment before responding to Tangning, \"26th, next Wednesday.\"\"Are you still being told by Mo Yurou to reject all my jobs?\" Tanging guessed.\"Yes...\"\"Note down every single one and keep every single email from every single client for evidence. Next Wednesday, I will use them,\" Tangning ordered calmly, \"If you still have a sense of judgment, you will know, following me is more promising than following Mo Yurou. Just on the fact that she is a mistress alone, she will never get the chance to step onto the international stage.\"After hearing these words, Lin Wei thought about why Mo Yurou had been getting into trouble so often lately, while Tangning's popularity was on the rise. She realized it was because all along, Mo Yurou had relied on acting weak and gaining sympathy. Meanwhile, Tangning...was using Mo Yurou as a stepping stone to make a comeback.Lin Wei weighed the pros and cons and decided it would be best to follow Tangning, \"I will help you prepare everything.\"Tangning nodded as she started to leave. But, just as she reached the doorway, she seemed to have remembered something as she turned to warn Lin Wei, \"If you don't have the ability to manage a PR crisis, then don't do anything scandalous for me to clean up after you.\"Put simply, if she couldn't avoid having photos taken of her, she shouldn't have gone around seducing someone she shouldn't have.Lin Wei's face turned pale. It was the first time she had come across an artist who had planned so far ahead without anyone knowing. From the looks of it, apart from seducing men, Mo Yurou really didn't have anything else going for her; in fact, she was unknowingly waiting for Tangning to send Tianyi Entertainment packing.Coming out of the building, the day was still young. Tangning returned to her car with a tired look on her face. Upon seeing her, Long Jie was extremely heartbroken, \"Did you have an argument with Han Yufan?\"\"Han Yufan asked to break up,\" Tangning replied calmly as she leaned her head back and slowly closed her eyes. She appeared to be trying to hide her emotions, \"Long Jie, did you know? When Han Yufan spoke those words, it sounded like he was reading from a textbook.\"\"He even wants to freeze my jobs for 3 years.\"\"That jerk, how can he be so disgraceful? Isn't he afraid of being struck by lightning?!\" Long Jie protested as she turned sideways. Seeing Tangning suffering, she reached out her hand to comfort her, patting her gently on the arm, \"Do not allow a man like that to make you feel bad, especially since you are going to make that jerk pay everything back ten-fold.\"\"I'm not capable of controlling my emotions completely yet, take me home,\" Tangning requested in a gentle whisper.\"OK...have some rest.\"Tangning knew, judging by Han Yufan's cold and careless attitude, he wasn't going to stop at making her attend rubbish events like this. All it would take, was one word from Mo Yurou, and he would be able to do something even worse. She had to find a way to destroy Mo Yurou's plans of standing in her way.By the time Mo Ting arrived home, it was already 8pm at night. However today, he didn't smell the aroma of dinner being served - all he felt was a cold chill. At first, he thought Tangning hadn't arrived home yet, but as he entered the bedroom, he saw her lying quietly in bed. No need to explain, she must have been treated unfairly today.Mo Ting walked over and sat on the edge of the bed. Upon sensing the familiar presence, Tangning immediately sat up and hugged him.\"If you want to cry, then cry. You will feel better,\" Mo Ting gently patted Tangning's shoulder.Tangning had been holding it in all day, but after being comforted by Mo Ting, she immediately let go and burst out crying, \"Sorry, I promised I wouldn't cry over unworthy things...\"\"It's okay, cry...Apart from me, who else would you be able to show your true self to?\" Mo Ting encouraged. Maybe because Mo Ting's hands were so gentle, or maybe because Mo Ting was older than Tangning by 7 years and exuded a sense of safety and maturity, Tangning cried in Mo Ting's embrace for a long time until no tears were left.\"Better?\" Mo Ting asked.\"Yep.\" Tangning freed herself from Mo Ting's embrace, \"You mustn't have eaten yet, I'll go cook...\"Without doing anything else, Mo Ting grabbed hold of Tangning's chin and used all his strength to press his lips firmly against hers. Not only did he want to kiss away her tears, but he also wanted to use this special moment to comfort the hurt woman in his arms.A kiss...was the best medicine and best painkiller. The couple kissed so passionately, the world felt like it was spinning as they tried to catch their breaths.\"Tangning, I hope that no matter if you are happy or sad, I would be the first person you would turn to. I don't care how many masks you are wearing on the outside, once you are home, we have to face each other truthfully. We should be like a normal married couple. We only need each other.\" Mo Ting wiped away the tears on Tangning's cheek as he stood up, \"I've said before, you aren't allowed in the kitchen anymore.\"Tangning saw Mo Ting turning to leave, so she quickly grabbed onto him, \"I need you, I need you right now...I need you to stay with me, hug me, kiss me...\"\"I need energy to kiss you.\"Tangning stopped crying, removed her blankets to get out of bed and held onto Mo Ting's hand, \"Then I'll keep you company...\"The couple had an enjoyable dinner and showered. After returning to bed, Mo Ting leaned against the bedhead and read some documents, while Tangning tried to sleep. But no matter what she did, she couldn't fall asleep.\"What's wrong?\"\"I can't sleep, can you read me a book?\" Tangning peeped out from under the blanket and pleaded Mo Ting.Only in front of Mo Ting did she not remain emotionless. She also didn't have to be calm and capable like she was in front of Long Jie. In front of Mo Ting, she was completely a little wife - a wife that needed to be spoilt.Of course, in front of Tangning, Mo Ting also didn't have to be the Mo Ting everyone knew. If she was his subordinate, he would have thrown his documents in her face. But, the person before him was Tangning, so he picked a book from the bookshelf and returned to the bed. He wrapped Tangning in his arms as the two of them opened the book together and started reading.This was such a simple gesture, but it turned out, Han Yufan the jerk, would have never done something like this for Tangning. Who would have thought, it would turn out to be the King of the Entertainment Industry, that would be willing to experience such a silly thing with her.The scars in her heart felt like they were slowly being healed. It was not long before Tangning fell asleep in Mo Ting's arms...and as usual, she slept sweetly.The next morning, the air was slightly humid. Tangning was awoken by the sound of her phone ringing, it was Lin Wei. Her voice was a lot gentler than the previous day, \"Tangning, I just arrived at your house, but only your assistant is home.\"\"I've moved.\"\"I came to tell you, after President Han announced you would be appearing at the corporate event, the fans you gained are now in an uproar. They are arguing intensely amongst themselves. They said if you were to appear at this event, it means you are supporting unreliable goods, there is no way they can accept it and are ready to abandon you...\"\"What's Mo Yurou's reaction?\" Tangning asked Lin Wei straightforwardly.\"She can't wait to see you suffer. Going to this event was her idea from the start. Not only does she want to step all over you, she wants your life to be a living hell.\"\"Then let's see next Wednesday, who's life will be a living hell...\" Tangning responded with a deeper meaning, \"In the meantime, don't worry about the fans, let them yell at me as much as they want!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, Tanging had yet to play the best card in her hand. However, Tangning didn\u2019t only want to make it impossible for Mo Yurou to be a model anymore, she also wanted Mo Yurou to be too embarrassed to be alive.Because her jobs were being frozen, after filming the commercial for hf, she once again had nothing to do. But, she wasn\u2019t impatient or angry. Even though fans were scolding her for endorsing an unreliable product, she didn\u2019t respond with a single word \u2013 sucking up the insults.Lin Wei had studied Tangning and studied the way she handled things previously. She realized she was a lot more tolerant than most people and could endure loneliness well.The entertainment headlines were still focused on Han Yufan and Mo Yurou\u2019s video. The public put Mo Yurou through all kinds of pain and abuse. Whereas, Tangning\u2019s reactions from the public consisted of 2 extremes. Some were extremely sympathetic as they assumed Tangning was being forced, leading to her having no choice in which company she was to endorse. Whereas younger fans questioned why, under these circumstances, she hadn\u2019t left Tianyi.It was amongst this complex debate\u2026\u2026that an album of photos from Tangning\u2019s recent shoot was leaked by a passerby. In an instant, the hottest person online had changed as everyone praised how stunning Tangning\u2019s beauty and long legs were.On top of everything, there were multiple magazines that pointed out, how even when posing randomly, every move that she made was more natural than any pose pulled by a professional model.So, while the three were enveloped in scandals, Mo Yurou and Han Yufan\u2019s responses were all negative, whereas, Tangning, on the basis of one album of photos\u2026made everyone forget she had been a substitute for Mo Yurou and that she had apologized after admitting to creating hype. The only image in their minds of Tangning, were her gracefulness as she looked back at the camera with tears in her eyes.While all this was going on, within the same day, Lin Wei received invites from no less than 5 magazines, requesting Tangning to appear on the front cover of their next season\u2019s issue.Compared to pitiful Mo Yurou who was getting one contract canceled after another, Lin Wei was suddenly impressed by Tangning. It was like she had some kind of magical ability that would always turn things around.Because Tangning\u2019s path to a comeback, could no longer be blocked by Han Yufan, when faced with all the invites from the magazines, he started to question himself \u2013 should he really be freezing Tangning?Lin Wei reported to Han Yufan with the invites from the magazines and analyzed which path Tangning should take. But, she was stopped by Mo Yurou who was sitting in Han Yufan\u2019s office chair, \"Didn\u2019t we already agree that we would not be accepting any jobs for her? Are you ignoring my words?\"Her relationship with Han Yufan is still young, yet here she is, already acting like she is the president\u2019s wife\u2026Lin Wei sneered on the inside.\"Let\u2019s choose E-Style,\" Han Yufan selected one of the most influential magazines as he spoke directly to Lin Wei.\"Yufan, what did you promise me?\"\"Babe, everything I do is for you. Think about it\u2026the incident with the video has received enough criticism. All we need is for Tangning to make an appearance and clarify that we broke up a long time ago. Then the relationship between you and I would not be adulterous at all \u2013 just a normal couple. The netizens will realize they\u2019ve been wrong and will feel guilty towards you \u2013 everything you do from then on would be more acceptable. I am laying a path for you,\" Han Yufan explained to Mo Yurou in a serious tone, \"There\u2019s not much time left until the Top Ten Model Awards. This is the fastest way to wipe your slate clean. By the time you make a comeback, do you think Tangning would still have a place to stand?\"After hearing this, Mo Yurou\u2019s anger immediately dissipated, \"Only you could think of something that covers all bases like this.\"Han Yufan had no idea Lin Wei was already on Tangning's side - the scheming between the two, quickly reached Tangning\u2019s ears.\"Those two want to use you to wipe their slates clean, what are you planning to do?\" Lin Wei was curious how Tangning was going to stop herself from being used by Han Yufan.\"Help me reject the job. If Han Yufan asks, just say I\u2019m not feeling well,\" Tangning replied.Picking one out of five magazines and then having to immediately reject four, was already not quite right.But, Lin Wei understood what had to be done. So far she had been impressed by Tangning's ability to skillfully deflect whatever was thrown at her. Effortlessly, she had passed the hot potato back. When Mo Yurou heard of this, she nearly went crazy. She slammed her hands on the table as she spoke to Lin Wei, \"She obviously did it on purpose!\"Then, Miss Mo, how accommodating did you think a model that's had her fiancee stolen and is getting all her jobs frozen, should be?\"After hearing everything, Han Yufan patted Mo Yurou on the back to comfort her. She turned to Lin Wei and ordered, \"Tell Tangning to come see me.\"\"I'm afraid she can't, she isn't feeling well,\" Lin Wei replied.\"Then tell me where she is, I will go look for her!\"\"Let me first ask Tangning for her opinion.\" After speaking, Lin Wei turned around and phoned Tangning. However, at this time, Mo Ting had just returned home and was hugging Tangning in the garden as they watered the plants. Lin Wei clearly expressed her thoughts, and because Mo Ting's ears were against Tangning's he overheard their conversation.At that moment, his ink-like eyes suddenly twinkled under the sun as he gave an amused smile. Leaning in close to Tangning's left ear, he suggested, \"Give our Hyatt Regency address to your manager...\"Tangning looked at him with uncertainty.\"Firstly, tell him that you've moved houses and because you are the daughter of the Tang family, living in Hyatt Regency is more suited to your status. You are no longer at a level where he can reach.\"\"Secondly, the security in Hyatt Regency is tight, did you think 'anyone' can come in? huh?\"Tangning gently laughed as she realized Mo Ting's attitude towards outsiders was definitely different to the kindness he showed at home.But, haha, she liked it! So, she followed Mo Ting's suggestion and gave their address to Lin Wei. Upon hearing the address, Lin Wei was shocked for a moment before she passed it on to Han Yufan.\"Tangning said she already moved houses. If you want to see her then you can go to Hyatt Regency, she's moved there...\"Hyatt Regency!But, that is Beijing's most famous and well-known estate...That's not a place that a small celebrity could live in.Mo Yurou was envious, \"She? Moved to Hyatt Regency? How is that possible?\"\"Miss Mo, have you forgotten she is an heir to the Tang empire? Her living in Hyatt Regency is merely a choice to live in an environment that is suited to her status.\"In other words, when Han Yufan and Tangning were still together, she had been forced to suffer by downgrading herself. Since Han Yufan didn't know how to cherish her, she of course, returned to where she belonged without any cares.This was a level that Mo Yurou would never be able to reach because it was already determined at birth.Inside, Han Yufan wasn't feeling good. Thinking back on when he and Tangning were still together, she was never willing to give anything. However, as soon as they broke up, she actually moved into Hyatt Regency!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From the looks of it, Tangning must have made amends with them. Han Yufan suddenly felt a sense of regret \u2013 it\u2019s Hyatt Regency\u2026being able to live there is proof of one\u2019s status. So many people dreamed of it\u2026If he had chosen Tangning, if he had held on for a little longer and married her, would he have had the chance to live in this paradise-like estate?In reality, Tangning never even contacted the Tang family, because\u2026after resolutely leaving the Tang family home, choosing Han Yufan and giving up on her career, all she wanted to do now was depend on her own ability to return to the top of the entertainment industry \u2013 only then would she be able to hold her head high and return home to apologize to her grandfather.After hanging up on Lin Wei, Tangning picked up the watering can again to continue what she was doing. However, Mo Ting wouldn't loosen her from his embrace. He grabbed her cheeks and pressed his lips against hers with a violent passion.Tangning enjoyed kissing Mo Ting, because he was always so caring towards her, plus he gave off a unique charm and aura. Tangning turned around and threw away the watering can. Atop the beautiful balcony blooming with roses, she wrapped her arms around Mo Ting tightly as she returned his passionate kiss allowing her tongue to become intertwined with his.Mo Ting pressed her against the icy cold wall as he trapped her between his arms - his kisses became even more passionate. Tangning's face blushed red as her arms uncontrollably gripped onto Mo Ting's waist feeling the warmth emanating from his body and his body tightening as he tried to resist.\"If you resist like that, won't it be bad for your body?\" Tangning whispered; her eyes twinkled beautifully like stars.\"What should I do? I kiss you every day...yet it never seems enough.\" Mo Ting reached out his hand and gently stroked Tangning's lips, \"It's like a drug...one that makes other's completely addicted.\"Tangning froze for a moment before she took the opportunity to turn around and press Mo Ting against the wall instead, \"To me...you are the same. I am frustrated; the more I tell myself not to think about you, the more I end up thinking about you...especially...the look on your face when you kiss me.\"\"Can you still resist not having me?\"\"I can't hold on for much longer...I really want to have a taste of you.\"Mo Ting was fairly built, yet here he was, being pressed against the wall as his little wife teased him. He was enjoying this as he smiled charmingly, \"A good woman...would not say such frivolous words.\"\"And a good man would not seduce his wife and not finish things off.\"\"My wife says such words...are you blaming me for only getting half way through our wedding night?\"\"When...\" Tangning leaned in close and whispered seductively, \"...will you go all the way?\"Mo Ting looked at his wife; at this usually gentle and quiet woman. It turned out, when she wanted to be provocative, she could drive a man crazy. It seemed, he had learned something new about Tangning.Mo Ting grabbed onto Tangning's waist and pulled her against his body so she could feel his pain, \"I think about it...all the time...\"The two continued to be loving while not stepping over the line until the estate security contacted one of the maids in the villa; there was someone here to see Tangning.Mo Ting straightened out Tangning's messed up clothes and hair before suggesting, \"Go upstairs, get changed and take our newest car out for a drive.\"Tangning understood what he meant as she kissed him on the cheek, \"Thank you hubby for your sponsorship!\"...In reality, Han Yufan was really reluctant to see Tangning because he didn't want to feel even more regretful. Especially when he pulled up at the gates of Hyatt Regency and was asked to wait outside by the security, he suddenly felt like he wasn't anything special.10 minutes later. A bright red Ferrari pulled out of Hyatt Regency and stopped right in front of Han Yufan. At first, Han Yufan didn't notice Tangning in the car because Tangning had never shown off in front of him with the fear of hurting his pride. However, she no longer had to care about that. Now she could show off whatever she wanted to show off.Tangning opened up the roof of the car as she turned her head sideways to speak to Han Yufan, \"Why are you looking for me?\"\"Tangning...\" Han Yufan looked at the completely different Tangning. His heart was sour; he never thought, after leaving him, Tangning would be so much better off.\"Speak,\" Tangning said coldly.\"E-Style Magazine. The company has already accepted the job for you, so you have no right to reject it. I don't care who you are and what background you have, you are still a model of Tianyi and I am still your boss. For the future of the company, I will organize for the team to release a statement on your behalf explaining that we broke up a long time ago and Yurou is not a mistress.\" Han Yufan was using his power as her boss to retrieve the pride he lost after seeing her drive out in a limited edition sports car.\"But...I've already asked Lin Wei to reject everyone...plus...I've already spread the word that I am sick.\"\"Tangning, do you have any regard for the company?\" Han Yufan was once again enraged by Tangning making decisions on her own, \"We are no longer in a relationship. You can't do whatever you want at Tianyi. Don't forget, when you originally signed the contract, the contract clearly stated you would accept all decisions made by the company. Do you want to breach the contract?\"Tangning didn't care about breaching the contract, but...she didn't want Han Yufan to benefit, so there was no way she would be stupid enough to give him money.After all, her ultimate aim was for Han Yufan and Mo Yurou to be completely destroyed...\"In regards to the magazine, I have already rejected them, there's no turning back.\" Tangning retreated one step, \"However...you can ask the team to give me the statement they've prepared. At next Wednesday's event, I will announce it to the public. Compared to a written statement, I'm sure announcing it personally would have a better effect.\"Han Yufan's expression warmed up as he eventually nodded, \"I guess that's all we can do...but, do you truly want to help the company clear things up?\"\"Han Yufan, even though you are heartless towards me, I can't be unrighteous towards you...\" Tangning responded seriously, \"I know Mo Yurou has been forcing you all along...\"\"It better be that way.\" After speaking, Han Yufan opened his car door and got in his car.He quickly disappeared from Tangning's sight because he knew if he was to stay even a minute longer, he would want to beg Tangning to take him back.Tangning watched as Han Yufan drove off. The corners of her mouth slowly curved up. When ordering her around, how could Han Yufan not realize how unreasonable his requests were? Not only did he betray her, here he was trying to use her to clear up the relationship between him and Mo Yurou. Han Yufan, as a person, don't you feel ashamed?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If she goes ahead with it, she will be on the same level as the brand she is endorsing and seriously become a disgraceful model.\"\"Eh, I originally thought she would become noteworthy in the modeling industry. I must have been blind!\"\"After tomorrow, Tangning, take yourself and your cheap product immediately out of the public's sight.\"\"Look at all the comments. Everyone is complaining...and the only person able to withstand all this abuse and still attend the event tomorrow with a smile is Tangning, I have to give it to her. From now on, in my heart, you are the most disgusting female celebrity. No one can beat you!\"Tianyi Entertainment. Mo Yurou was sitting in Han Yufan's office chair reading all the abusive comments - she was in a good mood.If Tangning wanted to fight with her, she should have considered her capabilities first. No matter how much Tangning wanted to make a comeback, from tomorrow onwards, her career would be once again stifled. In fact, it would be even worse than 3 years ago. When that time comes, Mo Yurou would be able to indulge in ridiculing Tangning, and the joy she got from ridiculing Tangning, was not something she could experience from anyone else.Meanwhile, Tangning was also at Tianyi Entertainment. For the sake of the event tomorrow, she was in a meeting...to be exact, she was in a meeting for the sake of what she was to say at the event tomorrow. Han Yufan handed Tangning the script they prepared earlier and then specifically ordered, \"Tangning, memorize this script well tonight. Tomorrow at the event, you better not forget to mention it to the reporters.\"\"This is the most significant part of you attending the event tomorrow.\"Tangning looked at the script in her hands like she was looking at a joke. Didn't Han Yufan feel any shame when handing this to her?On the way home, Lin Wei drove while Long Jie and Tangning sat in the back. Long Jie pointed to the script with anger, \"Is Han Yufan trying to provoke me? For the sake of clearing Mo Yurou's name, he would go to any length. He really has no conscience and doesn't even care about wounding your heart.\"Lin Wei looked at Tangning through the rear view mirror, but her face was calm as usual.Even a person like herself, who had experienced many highs and lows and had completely seen through the entertainment industry, found Han Yufan to be too heartless. Whereas, Tangning who was the object of this heartlessness wasn't showing any signs of emotion.\"Tangning, what do you want me to do tomorrow?\" Lin Wei asked, \"The things you've asked me to prepare are ready. All the evidence has been collated, I've even secured a recording of Mo Yurou talking about preventing you from securing any jobs.\"\"Tomorrow...I will take advantage of being in the spotlight to announce I am officially making a comeback,\" Tangning said to the two in a serious tone, \"I trust Long Jie completely, but you...Lin Wei!\"\"No need to say anything, I will follow you. I've been in the industry for too long, my mind is not always clear, but you have awoken me to the right direction,\" Lin Wei responded, excited to take on the challenge.\"All the evidence, sell it to the biggest media companies as headliners,\" Tangning spoke in a serious tone. \"It was all just small attacks before. I was too gentle on the two. From now on, they will only experience my fiercest methods of revenge.\"\"Yes!\" Long Jie was so happy she nearly jumped out of her seat.Lin Wei also felt her passion being reignited as she heard Tangning speak.After all, seeing Tangning being betrayed in this way, being humiliated and stepped all over, every woman who witnessed this would feel angered. Fortunately, Tangning's method of revenge was to step back over the two. This extremely satisfying method made Lin Wei and Long Jie's hearts light up!Lin Wei was now aware that Tangning lived in Hyatt Regency, but had no idea she lived there with Mo Ting.Tangning could not trust her 100% yet. So, after arriving in front of her villa, she asked Lin Wei to drive Long Jie home.Upon entering the house, she realized Mo Ting was already home. This tall attractive figure was stretched out peacefully across the sofa with his right arm covering his eyes from the blinding lights. Tangning smiled softly as she quietly walked beside Mo Ting and sat herself down. She gently ran her warm fingers across the contours of his face,\"Why aren't you sleeping in bed?\"\"The company you are endorsing tomorrow, Hai Rui has already sent out a letter from our lawyers, suing them for fraud.\" Mo Ting sat up and looked at Tangning, \"Approximately tomorrow afternoon, the news would have spread.\"\"It's okay, I will only be appearing in the morning,\" Tangning replied as she lay down on Mo Ting's chest.Even though Tangning didn't say much more, Mo Ting seemed to have read her mind - he knew what she was planning to do tomorrow. At the same time, Tangning also knew, after initiating her plan tomorrow, the client would not let her off so easily. Hence Hai Rui, who barely wasted their time on small companies, decided to send out a letter from their lawyers.\"Hubby, thank you...\"\"For what?\" Mo Ting asked as he gently stroked her back.\"Thank you for understanding me. Thank you for protecting me...\"Mo Ting didn't say anything as he lay his head down onto Tangning's thigh, using it as a pillow, \"I've been looking at documents all day, my eyes are tired.\"\"Then how about I read them to you...\" Tangning picked up the English documents that Mo Ting had not finished reading. With an extremely professional level of English, she started reading to him. However, when she finished, she gave a sigh, \"Back in the days, the conditions Star King offered me were so good, but I missed out on experiencing those 3 years. Who would have thought in the end I would come across you? God is indeed fair, he has really left the best for last.\"\"After canceling your contract with Tianyi, which company do you want to sign with?\"\"It's still too early...\" Tangning shook her head because she wasn't sure how much of her career she would be able to recover. So, right now she had not yet made a decision.\"Sign with me...\"\"For Hai Rui, a model like myself is nothing special!\" Tangning admitted that getting into Hai Rui wasn't very realistic.Mo Ting laughed as he moved away from the topic. His little wife obviously did not understand what he was saying. What he actually meant when he asked her to sign with him, was not referring to his company, Hai Rui. The contract he would write up for her would be the only one in this entire world, because she would be the only one that would have him as her manager.But, this surprise, he would leave till later. Although he was Tangning's husband, he still had to wait and see if she was worth it.As he wasn't used to seeing Tangning lacking confidence, he sat up, hooked his arm around her neck and pulled her in, demanding for a kiss, \"I won't allow you to underestimate yourself.\"\"I know you're only trying to find an excuse for a kiss!\" Tangning grasped hold of Mo Ting's warm palms and placed them on her chest, \" I want you to take things further...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mo Ting pushed Tangning down on the sofa and began to unbutton her white shirt; this was something he had been dreaming about doing for a long time...\"Ting...\" Tangning cried shyly, \"It hurts a bit...\"Mo Ting stopped trying to push past her boundaries and instead returned to her lips. The two continued to be intimate in the living room for some time before Mo Ting finally released Tangning from his embrace.\"Tomorrow is an important day for you. Sleep early tonight.\"In the bathroom, one of the maids helped her bathe while another dried her hair - all Tangning had to do was close her eyes. Thanks to Mo Ting, she had been sleeping well lately.The next morning, Lin Wei and Long Jie arrived at Hyatt Regency to pick up Tangning for her event. However upon arriving at the venue, to their surprise, Han Yufan was also there. On the surface, he appeared to have attended to support his artist, but in reality, he was only there to make sure Tangning would remember to clear Mo Yurou's name.\"How could I forget?\" Tangning replied.\"Tangning, I know it is hard on you, but...what we have between us is already over. You don't have to be envious towards Yurou, she is innocent.\"It turned out, for Han Yufan, completely ending a relationship only took a few days.\"And I'm not innocent?\" Tangning responded, \"My years of youth and all my sacrifices are worth nothing to you? Even a dog would wag it's tail thankfully when I play with it!\"\"Tangning, watch what you're saying,\" Han Yufan warned Tangning in anger. \"We both did it willingly. I never asked you to be so good to me, it was something you wanted to do.\"Tangning was silent because, at this moment, the makeup artist knocked on the door. She no longer wanted to see Han Yufan, so she immediately got up to let the makeup artist in.Han Yufan was also pretty angry as he turned around to leave the room. As he passed by Lin Wei, he ordered, \"Keep an eye on Tangning, don't let her do anything wrong.\"\"I will,\" Lin Wei nodded.The event was scheduled for 9am and Tangning's appearance was to be at 9:30am. It was customary for the company to send out a representative to start off the event before the guest would be introduced. At this moment in time, the event had already started and Tangning was prepared to go on stage. Tangning was wearing a silver deep v dress and her hair was brushed to one side with soft curls. Her look wasn't extremely eye-catching, but Tangning was born with the perfect body, so she complimented her clothing, no matter what she wore.\"Tangning, be prepared, you will be going on stage soon,\" Lin Wei reminded her anxiously.\"Tangning, don't be afraid, we will be here for you,\" Long Jie cheered.Tangning nodded, why would she be afraid? Today would be the day she'd initiate the first fight with Tianyi. Right now, in her heart, apart from hoping for success, she also had to remain calm.\"Go!\" Lin Wei escorted Tangning out of the waiting room.The venue for the event wasn't very big - the actual hall only fit roughly 200 seats. But, Tangning knew, apart from the people present here today, there would also be plenty of people watching her through their screens. Why? because they wanted to see her endorse this cheap brand and find something to gossip about. But, too bad, they were about to be disappointed.With a loud introduction from the host and encouragement from Lin Wei, Tangning stepped up to the front of the stage. It had been a long time since she had stood in front of the spotlight, so Tangning appeared to need some time to adjust.\"Our Tangning sure has a pair of enchanting long legs!...Come, let's begin by allowing Tangning to give her greetings.\"The host handed the microphone to Tangning before she calmly faced the almost 200 people in front of her, \"Hello everyone, I am Tangning.\"\"Welcome Tangning, we are very honored to have invited you because we all know your popularity has been on the rise recently. We are also very thankful for you to have come here specifically to support us. May I ask you a question?\" The host tried his best to liven up the atmosphere.\"Please speak.\"\"I believe you have used our product. Could you please describe your feelings towards it?\" the host jumped straight to the main point.Used it? Tangning slightly frowned...It was at this moment, onlookers watching the live stream online exploded, everyone wanted to get their opinion out.\"Cheap model! If you recommend this product, you are finished...\"\"I just photoshopped a GIF of Tangning, does anyone want to see?\"\"I wonder how many people will be fooled. Tangning why must you help them?\"Tangning knew, at this moment, the internet would be filled with an ocean of complaints, so...after she received the question, she took a glance at Han Yufan, Lin Wei and Long Jie, then located the best position in front of the camera before she opened her mouth to speak.\"First of all, I need to thank my agency, Tianyi Entertainment, for helping me accept an event for a product...I had never even heard about.\"\"Secondly, even though I was forced to step out onto this stage, as a model, my morals are intact. In regards to a product that consumers can not rely on, I will also boycott it. So this product...I have not used it.\"\"Lastly, I want to thank everyone for their attention. Even though I've lost my fame, I will not lose my bottom line.\"Three simple statements. Tangning was so quick that she didn't even give time for anyone to respond. By the time everyone realized the change in her attitude, Tangning had already finished talking.\"I...Tangning, will take advantage of this opportunity, to announce that I am officially making a comeback. In a moment, an even bigger scandal will be revealed. Thank you for your support.\"After speaking, Tangning bowed to everyone while they were still stunned before walking off the stage elegantly...The atmosphere became stale and Han Yufan's expression changed. Meanwhile, Lin Wei and Long Jie cheered on the inside.The internet was in chaos.\"OMG, what did Tangning just say? I didn't hear it properly, I need to rewind it and listen to it again. How can she be so cool?\"\"Me too, me too! I was already prepared to scold her, but then she actually did something like this. That was a major slap in the face!\"\"Apart from Tangning, who would be brave enough to slap her agency and client in the face at a live event!\"\"Cool, cool, cool! Tangning is so cool! If she's making a comeback, our eyes are in for a treat!\"\"Hahaha, I saw the host was completely stunned...\"\"Tangning is amazing! I'm so touched. I'm so glad I didn't judge her incorrectly. From now on, amongst the models, I will only acknowledge her!\"The internet was filled with cheers - not only fans, but even popular social media personalities edited Tangning's brief 2-minute recording into short clips and spread it around like wildfire. In an instant, all traces of Tangning's negative news was swept away.However, Tangning who had just stepped off the stage was not in a good position as Han Yufan and her client approached her directly to complain.\"Tangning, is there something wrong with your brain? A measly model like you, actually had the nerve to cause a commotion in front of so many people?\" The client pointed at Tangning and scolded her, \"Do you not want to live? Did you want to turn our event into your personal press conference?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Or else, I will make you regret ever existing,\" the angry company representative yelled at Tangning arrogantly.Tangning laughed gently as her expression remained calm - like she had just witnessed a joke, \"The words have already left my mouth, how am I to apologize? On top of everything, if I was to apologize, who would apologize to the consumers?\"\"If you don't apologize and help us eliminate all the negative responses you have created, then we will have to use extreme measures,\" the representative warned threateningly. After speaking, he glanced over at the event security guard and gave him a look. Understanding the hint, the security guard immediately started walking towards Tangning.Seeing the scene unfolding, Long Jie and Lin Wei quickly formed a human barrier in front of her. Long Jie pointed at the client as she asked angrily, \"What are you trying to do?\"Han Yufan whose face was pale, normally wouldn't deal with companies like this, but because he was in a rush to clear Mo Yurou's name, he did not prepare himself against Tangning.An outdated model actually had the nerve to announce a comeback?Did Tangning really think, after leaving him, she could start all over again?Han Yufan sneered before pulling Tangning over and throwing her to one side, \"Tangning, I know you hate me. But by doing this, you aren't hurting Yurou, you are hurting yourself. A model that has broken the industry rules, no matter how proud you are, will not be hired by anyone.\"\"Really?\" Tangning raised her eyebrows slightly, \"I don't think so!\"\"I don't care why you did this. I also don't care how envious you are of Yurou. Now that the event has been completely messed up, you will need to explain things to the client and you will have to pay the compensation for breaching the contract. Don't even try to throw the blame on Tianyi Entertainment,\" Han Yufan yelled at Tangning heartlessly. \"Also, in relation to clearing Yurou's name, since you won't cooperate, I have no choice but to release a statement on your behalf. When that time comes, you will just have to suck up any negative comments.\"\"President Han, it seems you have not fully understood my words. My announcement for my comeback was to show that from now on, I will comply with whatever parts of the contract I should comply, but at the same time, I will enjoy what I deserve to enjoy.\" The look in Tangning's eyes at this moment were cold, without even a trace of warmth, because towards the man in front of her, all she felt was disgust, \"President Han, no need to be impatient, my lawyers will arrive this afternoon and run through each section of the contract with you. They will clarify every part of the contract that I should have enjoyed over the years which I have not received.\"Seeing Tangning like this, Han Yufan was stunned, he never thought Tangning had this side to her. He couldn't believe she could force someone into the corner so aggressively that they couldn't even fight back.No, it must be because she received a shock, Han Yufan comforted himself. A woman that had usually been weak, how could she suddenly become so powerful?She must be trying to gain my attention, Han Yufan told himself. Oh, Tangning, must you really cheapen yourself to this extent? Why can't you just let go?As a result of Tangning's sudden announcement, the scene of the event was in total chaos. The company representative saw that the two had not come to a resolution yet, so rushed to their side impatiently. Looking at Tangning threateningly he spoke, \"If you don't give us a satisfactory explanation, then don't expect to walk out this door.\"\"Tangning, don't force us.\"It felt like a showdown was about to take place, but Han Yufan simply stood back and observed the scene playing out in front of him. He had no intention of helping Tangning, because he wanted Tangning to know, the consequences of betraying him shouldn't be taken lightly. However, never did it cross his mind, that he himself was the one to betray first.Long Jie protected Tangning anxiously as she watched the 3 security guards closing in on them. Within the industry, there were plenty of artists without a high status, that had experienced all sorts of abuse. Long Jie, at this moment, hated the fact that she was not a man.Seeing they had nowhere to run, the security guards' eyes smiled slightly - it was impossible for them to escape. However, at this time a loud 'PANG' echoed through the room as the waiting room's door flew open.A man holding a briefcase entered with 3-4 bodyguards. Scanning the room with his eyes, he asked, \"Who is in charge here?\"\"May I ask who...\" the company representative stepped forward.\"I am the lawyer of Hai Rui Entertainment, my surname is Qiao,\" the lawyer responded sternly as he pulled a letter out of his briefcase and handed it to the representative. \"The advertisement you shot last month has illegally used a photo of one of our artists. This is a serious violation resulting in damages to Hai Rui Entertainment. This is a letter of notification, we are confident we can sue you until you are bankrupt.\" After speaking, the lawyer took big poised steps out of the room while leaving the bodyguards behind - the reasoning was simple, they were to protect Tangning.The representative looked like he had just been handed a bomb as his hands began to tremble. He never thought he would attract the attention of the famous entertainment empire, Hai Rui.Small companies exploiting loopholes to increase their companies popularity was not uncommon. But, no one had ever had action taken against them by Hai Rui Entertainment.Was it because they were having a run of bad luck?No one knew the real reason, but Tangning was well aware, this was Mo Ting's way of finding a chance to help her take revenge.Out of everyone they could offend, who told them to offend Mo Ting's precious wife?Long Jie snickered on the side realizing the situation. This small company was so arrogant without knowing Mo Ting had already instructed his men to lie low until the time was right. It was clear how thoughtful he was towards Tangning.At this moment in time, the client was no longer in the mood to care about what Tangning said at the event. Inside, they knew very well, getting on Hai Rui's bad side meant they were watching their own imminent death.Han Yufan was also frightened by this sudden turn of events. In order not to be implicated, he immediately left the waiting room. His cowardly face was so shameful it did not deserve a second glance, not even from someone like Lin Wei.\"Tangning, let's go!\"Because their motive had been achieved, Lin Wei treated everything like a stroke of good luck. She knew, luck was very important in this industry, and Tangning, obviously had luck on her side.Announcing a comeback meant everything would have to start afresh. But, Tangning believed, as long as she didn't give up, she could still get back to where she was 3 years ago and even surpass it.The internet was cheering while the name Tangning, was once again revived. Everyone started to see Tangning in a new mysterious light.Long Jie was so excited she started reading some of the comments to Tangning with a huge smile across her face, \"I can already imagine Mo Yurou must be so angry right now. She must have thought, the mistake Tangning made just now, would be enough to end her career.\"\"She probably also thought she could have had the opportunity to bad-mouth you even more in front of Han Yufan as well as request him to punish you.\"Tangning didn't take note of Long Jie making fun of Mo Yurou, she just turned her head to question Lin Wei, \"The contents of the scandal, have you already organized everything?\"\"Of course, it is going to be amazing,\" Lin Wei replied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The boss must be f*cken stupid!\"\"I know right! If Tianyi can't plan for their artists, then let us do it. Even primary school kids could do a better job than them!\"\"Tangning, Tangning, what are you endorsing next? What should I buy? Who will give me money?\"\"Tangning, leave Tianyi, you deserve better.\"\"Tangning, we are about to cry from how cool you are...\"Seeing the internet's one-sided comments, Mo Yurou furiously threw the television remote to one side. She had never expected Tangning would use this kind of method to get on the public's good side, revolt against the agency's mistreatment as well as clarify she didn't want to be involved with an unreliable product. Mo Yurou gave a \"hmph\". She was beginning to hate this uncontrollable Tangning more and more!Most important of all, Tangning actually announced she would be making a comeback?An outdated model actually announced her comeback in such a high-profile way?Mo Yurou laughed uncontrollably. As long as Tangning was still at Tianyi, she was not going to let it happen. She could lose what she owned, but other people should not dream of gaining it.At this moment, Han Yufan who was still recovering from being shocked, opened the door and entered the office. Upon seeing Mo Yurou sitting on the office chair, he threw off his suit jacket, placed his hands on his hips and walked over to stand by the floor-to-ceiling window. His disappointment in Tangning had reached it's limit.\"Yufan, why aren't you working on a public statement to clarify the situation? Tangning has already thrown all the blame on us. How dare she say that she's thankful the agency organized for her to attend an event she didn't know about?\"Tangning indeed did not know and she was indeed treated with disrespect, however, Mo Yurou didn't consider these points. All she cared about, was seizing opportunities to step on Tangning whenever she could - there was no way she would hold back, \"Yufan, release a public statement! Tell everyone, for the sake of making money, Tangning organized this collaboration and it has nothing to do with the agency.\"Han Yufan was angrier than ever. Because of Tangning, the agency's reputation had been blackened like ash. So, he immediately gathered his PR team together to write out an emotional public statement.The statement reiterated that the event was not something forced by the agency - it was all something Tangning wanted to do herself. They were obviously hinting that Tangning had lied!It also mentioned, the company would be applying the maximum penalty on Tangning. After all, Tanging had defamed the company and messed up the event. They ridiculed her for losing her fame yet always using the company to cover for her and that, in reality, most of the time it was all things she did on her own.With this kind of statement, everyone could tell, Tianyi Entertainment was going to freeze Tangning. It also suggested their relationship with Tangning had gone separate ways...Not only this, Han Yufan also arranged for some of his staff to step out and accept interviews.\"Oh, you guys are talking about Tangning? There's not much I can say about her, I can just say nothing is as it appears - she's extremely two-faced!\"\"To be honest, I think the company is innocent because everyone in the company knows Tangning lied.\"\"I have no comments. I support Tianyi Entertainment. For the sake of moving up, what would a model not do?\"These 3 responses came respectively from a low-level employee, a high-level employee and a successful person in the entertainment industry who had strong ties with the company. It seemed they were determined to place the blame on Tangning - not allowing her to retaliate. As for Tangning, who never liked to respond to scandals: she let the company insult her however they wanted without stepping out to explain at all.Unfortunately, Han Yufan had completely underestimated Tangning's announcement about boycotting the cheap product. Even though some people were fooled by him, Tangning's popularity had long surpassed what she had previously.She was like a big mountain, using whatever method she could to quickly rise above everyone.Just as Tianyi Entertainment were spreading rumors about Tangning, Tangning released the evidence she had prepared - it was time to embarrass the agency. An authoritative online media source suddenly released a few voice recordings. People who listened to them realized Tianyi Entertainment was a cold-hearted organization!Freezing Tangning on purpose was already bad enough, they even organized for her to attend such a cheap event.Forcing Tangning to be a substitute, accepting all the blame and taking on the humiliation from the netizens - yet Tianyi Entertainment didn't stop!The thing that made everyone most surprised, was the voice that was giving orders not to allow Tangning to take on any jobs. The netizens recognized the voice; it was the mistress model, Mo Yurou...The netizens seemed to have understood everything...However, there were a few people that questioned where the recordings came from. It didn't matter. An hour later...Tangning's manager, Lin Wei, opened up her email to find it was flooded with messages from different companies asking to work with Tangning. But, in the end, they were all rejected. Lin Wei sighed reflecting on what happened today; Mo Yurou was arrogant because she was favored by Han Yufan. She also oppressed other artists and messed up the smooth operation of the company...Compared to Tianyi Entertainments empty claims, Tangning pulled out definitive evidence. This was the scandal she promised to release when announcing her comeback.\"OMG, I can't believe Han Yufan is such a jerk!\"\"Already at the brink of death and he still wants to make Tangning into a scapegoat.\"\"How can Tianyi entertainment be so horrible? It's bad enough that they are harsh to their models, how could they use Tangning and then try to dispose of her afterward? Throwing their own model under the bus - I've never seen such a shameless entertainment agency.\"\"What about the staff that stood out to speak on behalf of Tianyi this morning? They must have received a huge slap to the face. The whole company gathered together to bully one woman!\"\"Tianyi Entertainment, leave the entertainment industry!\"This time, after the evidence was released, Tangning didn't have to say anything. Who was wrong and who was right, was clear to see.Tianyi Entertainment and Mo Yurou were one step closer to death, whereas Tangning's popularity during this incident...once again, multiplied by an unimaginable amount!All kinds of advertisers started to contact Tianyi to cancel their contracts, even Tianyi's other models were being affected as all current endorsements were placed on hold. Han Yufan saw the overwhelming amount of comments online - he knew there was no turning back this time. After thinking carefully, he finally picked up the phone to call Tangning, \"Tangning, do you really want me to die? Will you only be satisfied after I'm destroyed?\"Tangning sat at home, pleased with the news, \"My lawyer is already on his way...Han Yufan, it's time to clarify our contract...\"\"Tangning, you can't do this! If you do this, Tianyi will be completely destroyed!\" Han Yufan was finally anxious.\"In comparison to what you and Mo Yurou have done to me, I've only returned 1% to you. Han Yufan. As long as you send Mo Yurou out of Tianyi Entertainment, I might consider...showing you mercy,\" Tangning said calmly into the phone.\"Is this your aim?\" Han Yufan was going mad, \"Let me tell you, I will fight with you to the end!\"\"Let's see you try...\" After Tangning was done, she hung up the phone. Even though her popularity was once again growing, it didn't mean Mo Yurou didn't still have a chance - the show had just started.On the way home, Mo Ting looked at today's headlines - he was impressed with what he saw. Even Lu Che was praising Tangning endlessly, \"The madam is sure amazing!\"\"In a moment, stop the car to buy a bunch of flowers. I want to congratulate her on her comeback,\" Mo Ting instructed, \"I want red roses...\"\"Understood, president...\" Lu Che nodded - amongst such a happy atmosphere, he was going to hide a Durex in the bunch of red roses!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was the biggest crisis faced by Han Yufan since he first established Tianyi. So his disgust and hatred towards Tangning was not simply a passing thought.The higher-ups in the company immediately called for an emergency meeting. Han Yufan even called his sister, who was living overseas, for help.\"Yufan, I've already seen the news. Tangning has solid evidence. In regards to this incident, you didn't keep things hidden enough, that's why you allowed others to find evidence against you. But, don't be too obsessed with what's happened, you need to learn how to size up the situation. You need to make it clear, you are the boss of the company. No matter how popular Tangning is, she is just a model. Her fate is in your hands.\"\"Then Jie (older sister), what should I do now?\" Han Yufan's mind was in a mess because of Tangning and Mo Yurou.\"First of all, release a public statement with a sincere apology. State that you will treat Tangning respectfully from now on to appease the angry netizens. Also, support Tangning.\"\"But...there's no way Yurou will agree,\" Han Yufan's head was hurting.\"I didn't tell you to give up on Mo Yurou. I currently have a deal with an international magazine, we are still missing two Asian models. Arrange for Tangning and Mo Yurou to attend the shoot together. This will prove their relationship isn't as bad as it seems. Plus, having them together will get discussions going. Although, this magazine isn't one of the highest ranked, but at least it is a step into the international limelight, this will be beneficial towards Mo Yurou's chances at the Top Ten Model Awards. This way, we are using Tangning's popularity to boost Yurou. Yufan, remember, a crisis is also a turning point, as long as you take advantage of this, Tianyi's fame will continue to rise.\"After hearing Han Ruoxue's reminder, Han Yufan was immediately enlightened. Older people were indeed wiser, \"Jie, I understand.\"\"After being with you for so many years, for Tangning to suddenly do so many things against you, you must have taken things too far. If you want to cheat, I will not judge - there aren't many pure-hearted people in the entertainment industry. I also do not expect you to be honest, but, why did you let Tangning find out? If you weren't my younger brother and if Mo Yurou didn't have your child inside her, I would leave you to fend for yourself,\" Han Ruoxue warned. \"This is the perfect chance - let them share a stage, let them lower each other's spirits. Mo Yurou is so arrogant and domineering because of the way you spoil her.\"\"Jie...she is carrying a child, I'm just worried she will receive too much stimulation.\"\"Also, Xin Er is ready for the kidney transplant. Previously, Tangning was the only one that was a perfect match. After your scolding, would she still be willing to donate her kidney to our Xin Er?\"Han Yufan was startled, he had almost forgotten about this. The Han family had 3 children: the oldest was Han Ruoxue who was a famous top-tier manager. 3 years ago she was scouted by an international company and had been living in America ever since. Han Yufan was the second oldest and was introduced into the entertainment industry by his sister. The youngest was Han Xin Er, because of a bad kidney plus young age, Xin Er was often at the hospital for treatment.\"Jie, no matter what happens between Tangning and I, since she has promised to save Xin Er, I will not give her a chance to change her mind.\"Han Ruoxue gave two grunts of approval before hanging up the phone. She was both angry and felt helpless towards this brother.Afterwards, Han Yufan instructed his team to release a statement admitting to treating Tangning harshly. The statement also stated they would genuinely try to make amends and will treat Tangning well from now on. They ended with a plea for Tangning and her fans to give Tianyi one more chance.At the same time, Tianyi announced they had been invited by the international magazine: Secret, to allow Tangning and Mo Yurou to attend their shoot.As soon as this was announced, the public was once again outraged, just like Han Ruoxue predicted. The two models were obviously enemies who previously fought over the same man. They were rivals, but, Han Yufan actually placed the two of them together?Dear god...Even though Tangning's popularity was once again on the rise, it didn't hide the fact that she had previously been a substitute for Mo Yurou...On the other hand, although things had run smoothly for Mo Yurou in the past, in the end, she was just a B-Grade model. No matter what she did, she couldn't get to the top...Fans from both sides started arguing; was Tangning more professional or was Mo Yurou more pleasing to the eye?This was how the entertainment industry was like; the spotlight often changed. Of course, all Tangning wanted to do was avoid Tianyi's sneaky slandering by placing herself out in the open, at the same time preventing Mo Yurou from interfering. Now that Han Yufan had placed her on the same level as Mo Yurou, she reached her aim.\"Tangning, will you accept this job?\" Lin Wei questioned over the phone. The fact that Han Yufan acted like he cared about Tangning and organized an international magazine job for her, if she was to reject, it would make her seem petty, \"Even though Han Yufan never asked for your opinion, if you don't want to do it, we can think of something.\"\"I'll accept it!\" Tangning replied straightforwardly.\"OK, I understand. It's good that you are sharing the stage with Mo Yurou. The public will have the opportunity to see Mo Yurou perform. They will discover, she at most, can only be your backdrop!\" Lin Wei responded, \"Tomorrow morning, the company will have a discussion. I will first go pick up Long Jie and then I'll come get you.\"\"OK,\" Tangning nodded. Lin Wei seemed to be getting used to things.Tangning hung up the phone and continued to be a cook in the kitchen. Even though Mo Ting didn't allow her...she never considered herself to be delicate; cooking for her husband was her right!After returning home, Mo Ting found Tangning busy in the kitchen. Approaching her from behind, he lifted her off her feet and placed her atop the kitchen bench, trapping her between his arms, \"You know what the consequences are for not listening to me?\"Tangning hooked her arms around Mo Ting's neck as she swung her legs, \"Don't tell me...you will 'eat' me?\"\"You don't know how to be afraid...\" Mo Ting evaluated. He stretched out his arms, carried her towards the living room and placed her on the sofa, \"Today is the day of your comeback, so leave dinner to me.\"Tangning nodded her head as she removed the apron from her body and placed it on Mo Ting.Mo Ting was tall and his body was built. When he wore business shirts and the soft material hung to his chest, his slightly hidden abdominal muscles made it difficult for Tangning to take her eyes off him.Afterwards, all that could be seen was a man chopping - calm and capable. He treated his ingredients like he treated life, quick, efficient and clean - not leaving a mess.This poised man was like a piece of art.Tangning tried to hide her fluttering heart as she headed to the bedroom. She discovered, atop their bed, a bunch of red roses.Tangning excitedly placed the flowers in her hand as she leaned in to smell the lovely fragrance. However, she noticed a small package amongst the flowers. She curiously took it out to have a closer look...her face suddenly turned bright red.Did Mo Ting, want to have her tonight?Then, was she meant to know about the existence of this Durex or was she to pretend she didn't see a thing?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He pushed open the door to find Tangning sitting in bed holding the bunch of red roses he had bought her - she was in the middle of counting them. Her cheeks were rosy and her lips opened and shut slightly, looking extremely beautiful...\"This is the first time I've received so many flowers!\" Tangning exclaimed, \"Mo Ting, I'm really surprised...\"Mo Ting looked at her satisfied expression as he crossed his arms and teased, \"Why are you so easy to please? Just a few flowers are enough to make you this happy. There is so much I want to give to you, yet, you never tell me what you want. Why can't you be like other women and ask for diamonds and jewels? Or even fame...and success?\"Tangning laughed gently. She lifted her head to reply to Mo Ting, \"I already have your entire person, isn't that greedy enough?\"\"I have your marriage, I have the title of being your wife, I have half your assets and I even get to spend the rest of your life with you. Jewels? Success? All this, I can acquire myself. What is more important than you?\"Mo Ting's heart lit up as he leaned over and kissed Tangning, \"Your lips are too sweet, I can't help but taste them.\"Tangning grabbed onto his shoulders and pulled herself in closer to return his passionate kiss. Amongst the mingling of lips and teeth, the couple uncontrollably found themselves in bed with Tangning laying pressed under Mo Ting's body. Her top had already been removed and was strung across the floor - all in less than a minute.Tangning couldn't resist her urges as she mirrored Mo Ting's moves and reached out her hands to unbutton his shirt. Seeing his glowing bronze skin revealed before her eyes, Tangning's cheeks flushed a crimson red as she awkwardly turned to one side.Mo Ting laughed gently, holding onto Tangning's neck and turning her attention back to him, before asking softly, \"Do you want it?\"\"Do you?\" Tangning threw the question back at him cleverly.\"You know what I'm waiting for. Tangning, if you say it, I will...\" Mo Ting leaned into her ear as he whispered seductively, \"Make you stay in bed all night.\"Tangning knew what he meant, so she nervously replied to Mo Ting, \"I...still can't be 100% certain of my heart, but, I know I want to be with you for the rest of my life, Mo Ting.\"The relationship between the two continued to improve; having their souls combine together, was only a matter of time, so...Mo Ting didn't want to let her go this time. He wanted her to experience the ultimate in intimacy and for her to receive the happiness she deserved.Sometimes...there were other methods to satisfy a partner...After being intimate, the couple lay embraced in each other's arms. Tangning pressed herself against Mo Ting's chest as she spoke in an unsatisfied tone, \"I saw you bought...that thing...I thought...\"\"What thing?\" Mo Ting's right hand was holding up his head, while his left hand was gently stroking Tangning's back.Tangning reached under her pillow and pulled out the Durex. She handed it to Mo Ting, \"This thing. I thought you were ready to have me...I even...specifically went and had a shower...how embarrassing!\"Mo Ting looked at the small package in his hand as his eyebrows scrunched up, \"I'm not this small...\"That Lu Che...\"Stop talking about it!\"\"No need to be embarrassed,\" Mo Ting laughed. The corners of his lips were curved to an extremely handsome angle, \"I'm completely drawn to your reaction.\"\"No more...\" Tangning hid herself under the blankets.Mo Ting responded quickly by grabbing hold of his adorable wife and comforting her, \"OK, let's talk business instead. You've already accepted Secret Magazines photo shoot, right?\"\"Why?\" Tangning finally popped her head out, \"Are you afraid I'll lose to Mo Yurou?\"\"If you need to go to the states for the shoot, once your itinerary is finalized, tell me immediately,\" Mo Ting said in a mysterious manner.\"What do you want to do?\" Tangning questioned curiously.This was perfect, he had previously said he would buy insurance for her legs and the US was the best place to look for a good insurance company.\"Didn't we already agree? After leaving this house, you are the boss of many and I am a model of a small company, we won't interfere in each other's personal issues.\"\"Mrs. Mo, have I ever interfered with you?\" Even though seeing Tangning being bullied by Tianyi made his heart break to the point where he wanted to tear them down, he never recklessly made a move, since Tangning didn't like it. If not because of this, he could have easily destroyed a person like Han Yufan with the blink of an eye.Tangning understood Mo Ting respected her completely.This was the reason she cherished every day she spent with him.\"Han Yufan wants to take advantage of my popularity to boost Mo Yurou's status, that's why he put us together. At the same time, by doing this, he hopes it will prevent me from doing anything against Mo Yurou as it would have a negative impact on me too.\"\"However...\" Mo Ting finished off what she was going to say, \"...with your abilities, even if you were both to appear on the same cover of a magazine, you are going make her into your prop.\"\"You have so much faith in me?\" Tangning asked.\"I believe in you.\"Tangning was satisfied. Huddling up to Mo Ting's warm embrace, she slowly fell asleep. Meanwhile, Mo Ting made a phone call to Lu Che, \"Find out Secret Magazine's schedule, I need to know when Tangning will be going overseas. Plus, clear up my schedule for the same time frame...while you're doing that, help me make an appointment with the best insurance company in America...\"...Early the next morning, Tangning arrived at Tianyi accompanied by Lin Wei and Long Jie. At the same time, Mo Yurou and her assistant also walked in through the main entrance of Tianyi - her imposing manner was the same as usual. Upon seeing Mo Yurou, the staff greeted her with respect. However, towards Tangning they were extremely casual, some even chose to ignore her.Mo Yurou looked at Tangning and then looked behind her at Lin Wei, \"Tangning, towards a person that betrayed their previous owner, you better be careful.\"\"I've even dealt with a mistress that stole someone's fiancee, why would I be afraid of a manager that's betrayed their previous owner?\" Tangning smirked.\"I admit, your popularity is not bad right now, but...no matter how popular you are, you will still be a backdrop for me. Didn't Han Yufan tell you? The whole purpose of Secret's shoot is to help me gain support for the Top Ten Model Awards!\"\"Then let me wish you all the best in advance.\" After speaking, Tangning looked around her as she announced to the staff, \"Yesterday, my lawyer has clarified my contract with Han Yufan. Tianyi has agreed to treat me the way that I deserve to be treated. Mo Yurou and I are both models of Tianyi, so when you all see me, you should do what you are suppose to do. From now on, if you respect me, I will respect you back!\"Tangning's words were neither weak nor overbearing as she spoke strongly.Those that previously treated Tangning as invisible immediately realized, this woman was not one to mess with...So, they instantly reacted by greeting Tangning respectfully. This time around, their voices were even louder than when they greeted Mo Yurou.After Tangning was satisfied, she lifted her legs and walked towards Mo Yurou...Being Mo Yurou's backdrop?She must be dreaming!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tianyi Entertainment's meeting room. Han Yufan organized a short itinerary briefing for Mo Yurou and Tangning's Secret Magazine shoot in America.Han Yufan sat at the head of the table, while Mo Yurou and Tangning sat on his two sides. The only change from previous meetings, was the difference in their identities; Mo Yurou, the mistress, had successfully promoted herself, kicking the original partner to one side.As if that wasn't enough, she was even shameless enough to exchange loving looks with Han Yufan. Everyone present couldn't stand watching them.Lin Wei looked at Tangning sideways. Although she was sitting under the projector, it was hard to predict what she was feeling. However...Lin Wei could sense, at this moment, her eyes had completely blocked out Mo Yurou and Han Yufan.This was one of the many things Lin Wei was impressed with Tangning about. No matter how hurt she was, she would never reveal her deepest emotions. Nor would she allow others to humiliate her.\"For Secret's shoot this time, I will be personally taking you both to the US. We will also be joined by a translator. As we will be working together for a few days, you should get to know each other in advance, in case it affects the progress of our work,\" Han Yufan handed out some information about Secret to Tangning and Mo Yurou as he spoke. \"Secret was founded 20 years ago and was once all the rage in the US. Although, they have shown a decline in popularity in recent years, their influence is still not to be underestimated. As for this time, their reason for inviting Asian models, is to utilize the Oriental Wave to help them be reborn in the East...therefore, your job, is very important!\"\"In terms of fashion, Yurou is more familiar with what is required. So, Tangning, you will need to listen to her opinions and let her take the lead...\"Once the words left his mouth, everyone in the room immediately understood what was happening - Han Yufan was trying to make Tangning step back to highlight Mo Yurou.Upon seeing Mo Yurou's arrogant look, Long Jie gritted her teeth in anger.\"Yufan, no need to worry, I won't disappoint!\"Tangning did not retaliate. She simply stood up, turned to Lin Wei and Long Jie and said, \"Let's go...\"\"Tangning, what is the meaning of this?\"Tangning turned around and looked at Han Yufan calmly, \"Han Yufan, do you really think my patience would last a lifetime? It's clear to see, with Mo Yurou's reputation as a mistress, it's impossible for her to land a job at this time. Using my name, scrounging off my popularity and asking me to highlight her? Is she...worthy?\"\"Tangning!\" Mo Yurou yelled in anger, \"I dare you to say that again?\"\"If you have the ability, then go shoot it yourself!\" After speaking, Tangning turned around ready to leave with Lin Wei and Long Jie. However, Han Yufan held back his anger and opened his mouth to stop her.\"Wait...if you are unhappy with something, we can discuss it.\"\"In the past, I was too easy to convince, that's why I was stepped all over by a jerk and a tramp. Han Yufan, you know how important this shoot in the US is. Even though you act like you are calm...if I don't agree to do it, I'm sure you will be in a panic. Whether you want the shoot to go ahead, it's up to you. After all, it's not the first time you've frozen my career. Let Mo Yurou go...\"As soon as the words left Tangning's mouth, Long Jie almost couldn't stop herself from clapping her hands and cheering.Lin Wei also couldn't help but sneak in a smile. Were they still dreaming about bullying Tangning? It's time they woke up...\"Also, whether or not Mo Yurou's fashion sense is better than mine, is still to be verified. Han Yufan, don't forget, although my status no longer exists, I am still the only one in Tianyi that has been in a film. Are you sure you want to send this non-advancing B-grade model to the US to lead the way? And...let's not forget to mention, she's a B-grade model that requires a translator.\"\"Tangning, I'm going to rip your mouth apart!\" Mo Yurou jumped up in anger and slammed her hands on the table glaring at Tangning.\"Yurou, what Tangning has said isn't all wrong. This time, you listen to her.\" Although Han Yufan was angry, for the sake of the bigger picture, he had to endure. When Tianyi makes its comeback, he had no doubt he would be able to put Tangning back in line.\"I don't want to,\" Mo Yurou rejected angrily.\"It's decided. You have no right to refuse.\"Tangning smirked, revealing only one side of her face to everyone in the room. It was from this angle, that Han Yufan realized Tangning had completely changed. She was clear, calm and everything she did, no longer revolved around him. Han Yufan discovered everything was different, Tangning was no longer the original Tangning; he suddenly felt a little upset.Inside the meeting room, everyone had already left. Whereas, Mo Yurou was still inside throwing a tantrum and smashing things on the floor, \"Han Yufan, I've had enough! Why do I have to listen to Tangning? Didn't you say this shoot was for me? I don't see how it is for me...\"\"That's enough!\" Han Yufan revealed his temper, \"When will you learn to understand things? If Tangning does not attend this shoot, your Top Ten Model Award....don't even dream about getting it. Think carefully.\"Mo Yurou was stunned. When had Han Yufan ever yelled at her like this?In retaliation, she wrapped her arms around her stomach and started crying, \"Han Yufan, do you remember I am still carrying your child?\"\"If it wasn't because you were pregnant, I wouldn't have to personally go to the US. Everything I do is for you, why can't you control your temper a little - you're always making things difficult for me.\" After speaking, Han Yufan walked out of the meeting room, leaving behind Mo Yurou and her assistant.\"Yurou, President Han is right. You've already snatched him over to your side. The most important moment is right now. Endure for a little longer, after you make a comeback and your fame has returned, we won't have to be afraid of Tangning anymore,\" her assistant tried to convince her carefully. \"Be good, don't let anger ruin your body or else you will lose more than you gain.\"\"Tangning, I really want to see, whether an outdated model is more professional or whether I, Mo Yurou am better!\" After listening to her assistant, Mo Yurou decided to temporarily suck up the anger she had developed from today's humiliation.\"Mo Yurou must be throwing a tantrum in the meeting room right now...she must be pointing at Han Yufan and yelling at him for not allowing her to be the main lead,\" Long Jie could guess Mo Yurou's reaction to today's humiliation. On the way home, she continuously imitated her. \"However, Tangning, you are developing more and more of a temper...the words you said just now, were so refreshing!\"Lin Wei joined in by laughing, \"Tangning, I never expected you had such an explosive power.\"\"I entered the industry at 17 and became Beijing's Top Model when I was 23. Up to this point, it's been 9 years. What else is there in this industry that I do not understand? That's why I once thought having a lover and getting married was something I could rely on, but now, I've realized, I can only rely on myself.\" Of course, Mo Ting who was supporting her behind the scenes was an exception.\"It goes without saying, some people have been in the industry all their lives, yet they are still unaware of so much.\"\"That's because they haven't been hurt and backstabbed...\" Tangning was referring to her own experiences. \"No matter what, go home and pack your bags. Be prepared for the flight to the US tomorrow...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, Tangning promptly forwarded the details to him. Even though she didn\u2019t know what he had planned, she knew, Mo Ting wasn\u2019t going to hurt her.After seeing Tangning\u2019s itinerary, Mo Ting asked Lu Che to find out Tangning\u2019s flight number straight away. He then walked over to Hai Rui\u2019s giant floor-to-ceiling window and gave Tangning a call, \"Ning\u2026\"\"Uh?\" Tangning gave a simple reply as she lowered her head; Lin Wei was still in the car and she couldn\u2019t completely trust her yet, so she had to be careful. Upon hearing Mo Ting calling her 'Ning', she felt a gush of warmth.\"I have asked Lu Che to upgrade your economy class tickets to first class, will that cause you any inconvenience?\" Mo Ting had to make sure because he was afraid it might affect Tangning \u2013 what if she had something planned?\"Of course not,\" Tangning understood why Mo Ting had asked and was touched by his consideration.Originally, she was supposed to sit in the same row as Mo Yurou and Han Yufan on the plane tomorrow, but she could already imagine Mo Yurou wasn\u2019t going to just sit quietly. With Mo Ting\u2019s arrangements, she could now rest peacefully on the plane. However, was she the only one that got the upgrade? What about Lin Wei and Long Jie\u2026\"In that case, let\u2019s chat about it when you get home.\"\"Wait\u2026\" Tangning called out quickly.Mo Ting could sense the hesitation in her voice and could also tell it wasn\u2019t convenient for her to talk, so he responded, \"If it\u2019s inconvenient to talk, send me a message instead.\"\"OK,\" Tangning nodded as she hung up the phone. Immediately afterwards, she messaged him her concerns. She told him she couldn\u2019t completely trust Lin Wei, but since Lin Wei had decided to follow her, she couldn\u2019t treat her differently to Long Jie in case it would make her disheartened.Mo Ting read her concerns as the corners of his lips curved to an attractive angle. Even though Tangning\u2019s thoughts were comprehensive, she still lacked the ability to look at a situation as a whole. Mo Ting completely made up for Tangning\u2019s weaknesses, that\u2019s why the couple matched so well \u2013 he was the one capable of pointing her in the right direction as well as helping her make decisions.\"Relax and take a gamble. Even though Long Jie is loyal, there is a limit to her abilities. On the other hand, although Lin Wei has a lot of faults, she still has a history of managing some very famous artists \u2013 she is more capable than Long Jie in all aspects. Don\u2019t forget, we have everything about Lin Wei in the palm of our hands. Even if we lose our bet, the worst that could happen is that we gain nothing.\"\"I understand, hubby\u2026\" Tangning saw Mo Ting\u2019s reply and immediately calmed down as she relaxed her entire body.\"I\u2019ve already upgraded for the both of them, don\u2019t worry\u2026\"Tangning knew all along, her husband was like a king who had full grasp of how to use his power. How could he have not already considered this small matter?\u2026Late at night, under the lighting of the beautifully lit bedroom, Han Yufan was packing his luggage. Mo Yurou approached him from behind and wrapped her arms around his body. She spoke with an extremely soft and gentle voice, it was like she was a different person to the one in the meeting room earlier in the day, \"Sorry, Yufan, I was wrong at the meeting today, I wasn\u2019t considerate towards you.\"\"It\u2019s OK, we\u2019ve been together for so many years now, don\u2019t you think I\u2019m already used to your temper? Think about it, if I didn\u2019t care about you or worry about you and our child, would I need to personally go to the US?\" Han Yufan put his luggage away and turned around to look at Mo Yurou, \"From now on, you need to control your temper and stop fighting with Tangning, in case you hurt yourself.\"\"But, I can\u2019t help being worried\u2026worried that you and her might rekindle your love!\"\"What are you talking about? You obviously know that you\u2019re the one I love, stop thinking too much. We still have a long future ahead of us, let\u2019s not let this sl*t bother us.\" Han Yufan comforted Mo Yurou, \"You are currently pregnant, you should maintain a good mood.\"\"In that case, tomorrow on the plane, you aren\u2019t allowed to take even one glance at Tangning. You are only allowed to be nice to me,\" Mo Yurou demanded in a spoilt manner. At the same time, her body was rubbing against Han Yufan\u2019s \u2013 inside, she knew, all men loved stuff like this.\"Fine, as you wish,\" Han Yufan responded, carrying her horizontally in his arms as he walked towards the bathroom.With Han Yufan\u2019s promise, this trip to America, Mo Yurou was going to prove to Tangning who Han Yufan truly loved. She was going to make Tangning understand, even if she was to make a comeback and become famous, there was no way she would be able to win back Han Yufan\u2019s heart. Han Yufan and Tianyi Entertainment were both hers, and Tangning didn\u2019t stand a chance...However, did Tangning even care about all this?Meanwhile, under similar lighting conditions, Tangning was packing her luggage inside her wardrobe. However, she noticed Mo Ting had also prepared some luggage in his wardrobe. So, out of curiosity, she headed into the study room to question him, \"Mo Ting, do you also have to fly out for business?\"\"Yep, my flight is tomorrow,\" Mo Ting nodded but he looked extremely busy.Tangning was afraid she would interfere with his work, so she stopped asking further, thinking Mo Ting would eventually explain to her when it was time to go to bed. However, it seemed, Mo Ting ended up working through the night and leaving for work early in the morning. Tangning looked at the note he left for her and assumed he had something urgent to deal with at work. She decided she would report to him after she landed on US soil - she did not doubt his whereabouts whatsoever.Nice and early, Lin Wei was waiting outside the gates of Hyatt Regency. Seeing Tangning hadn't mentioned her relationship with Mo Ting to Lin Wei, Long Jie decided to stay quiet; she just promptly helped Tangning load her luggage into the boot of the car. The three quickly arrived at the airport to meet up with Han Yufan and the others.Because it was still early, there weren\u2019t many people at the airport. Without any cares, Han Yufan and Mo Yurou held hands in front of Tangning. Mo Yurou looked provokingly at Tangning, making Long Jie so annoyed she wanted to throw a slap across her face.\"Long Jie, go and collect our boarding passes,\" Han Yufan ordered.\"Why do I have to go?\" Long Jie knew in her heart, she was at odds with Han Yufan, so he was deliberately causing trouble for her and Lin Wei.\"Long Jie, go ahead\u2026\" Tangning said as she gave Long Jie a look. Long Jie was stunned for a moment, before she understood, \"OK, wait here, I\u2019ll be right back.\"Mo Yurou and her assistant glanced at each other. Looks like they had someone to handle their luggage over the next few days\u2026However, never would they have imagined, when Long Jie returned\u2026she had only collected 3 boarding passes.\"Long Jie, what is the meaning of this?\" Mo Yurou questioned.\"I am Tangning\u2019s assistant. I\u2019m sorry, but my salary comes from Tangning, not from Tianyi Entertainment, so\u2026why do I need to collect for you? Don\u2019t you have your own assistant?\" Long Jie reasoned, making Mo Yurou and her assistant so angry they gritted their teeth.Han Yufan looked at Tangning, but Tangning pretended not to see him as she put on her sunglasses and turned away.Mo Yurou glared at Tangning,\u00a0There's more jealousy coming your way once we board the plane, just wait and see\u20268:20am. The boarding time had arrived. Because Tangning had come across a few fans that recognized her asking for autographs, she was delayed by a few minutes. Han Yufan and Mo Yurou boarded the plane first, while Tangning fell behind. The three of them were originally meant to sit in the same row, but...\u2026while Mo Yurou wrapped her arms around Han Yufan, waiting to see Tangning\u2019s reaction, she noticed Tangning walk right past them. So, Mo Yurou kindly reminded her, \"Tangning, your seat is here.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She then waved the boarding pass in her hand as she spoke, \"I\u2019m sorry, we are also in First Class. Enjoy your time in Economy\u2026\"Lin Wei had only just realized she\u2019d been upgraded after boarding the plane. Looking at Mo Yurou\u2019s confused expression, she felt extremely satisfied. This was the first time, as an artist\u2019s manager, she was being treated better than the agency\u2019s CEO!Mo Yurou watched as the trio entered the First Class Cabin before turning to Han Yufan suspiciously, \"What is all this? Didn\u2019t they say First Class was sold out? Was Tangning\u2019s ticket booked by the agency?\"\"I also don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\" Han Yufan responded frustratedly.\"I\u2019m so angry!\" Mo Yurou had planned to make Tangning watch her and Han Yufan being affectionate, who would have thought, she would end up going to First Class.Tangning also thought the First Class Cabin would be full, however, as the three of them walked in, she realized, apart from them, there were no other passengers.\"Tangning, that jerk and tramp won\u2019t also end up being upgraded here, will they?\" Although the First Class Cabin was separated by a sliding door, it was clear to see, there were no other passengers, so Long Jie was a little worried.\"Miss, you can be rest assured. In order not to disturb Miss Tang from resting, Mr. Mo has already booked out the entire First Class Cabin, no other passengers will be allowed in,\" the air-hostess explained to Long Jie.After hearing from the air-hostess, Long Jie held onto her head - it felt like it was about to explode...\"Tangning, you have such a good life!\"Lin Wei had a confused expression on her face the entire time. Just as she was about to ask what was happening, out from the plane\u2019s private bathroom, stepped a respectable man in a brown suit. He had a calm expression on his extremely handsome face. Upon his right ear was a distinctive black mole, which resembled a sparkling black diamond.Dear god\u2026this was the CEO of Hai Rui Entertainment! A Legend in the Entertainment Industry!Lin Wei was dumbfounded, never would she have imagined, she would see Mo Ting under these circumstances.What confused her even more, was Tangning\u2019s reaction upon seeing Mo Ting; there was no sense of unfamiliarity, instead she was pleasantly surprised, \"Mr. Mo, can you please explain why you disappeared without a word early this morning and then suddenly appeared here?\"\"Mrs. Mo, it seems you don\u2019t want to see me?\" Mo Ting casually took her bag out of her hands, like a gentleman.\"It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to see you, I\u2019m just a little shocked\u2026President Mo seems to be good at finding different ways to place himself before me,\" Tangning affectionately hooked her arms around Mo Ting\u2019s as they entered a small room and closed the door.\"They\u2026\" Lin Wei felt her brain had disconnected. At this moment, it was completely blank.\"Tangning mustn\u2019t have officially introduced him to you?\" Long Jie raised her eyebrows towards Lin Wei, \"The CEO of Hai Rui Entertainment, the big boss of the Entertainment Industry, is Tangning\u2019s husband. When I first found out, I was even more shocked than you.\"\"They\u2026when did they get married?\" Lin Wei questioned.\"On the day that Tangning was to marry Han Yufan, Han Yufan and Mo Yurou were cheating behind her back. Tangning suffered a heavy blow, so\u2026she married herself off. Now it\u2019s clear to see, she married the right person. However, their marriage was rushed, no one knows about it.\" Speaking up to this point, Long Jie decided to remind Lin Wei of a few things.\"Since Tangning let you know about this without holding back, it must mean she acknowledges your skills. As you can see, although Tangning has married Mo Ting, she has never considered relying solely on him - all along, she has been depending on her own ability. Lin Wei, Tangning is a gem, sooner or later she will be standing at the pinnacle of the modeling world, so\u2026you should be able to distinguish between what you should and shouldn\u2019t do.\"Lin Wei sighed. She had completely lost to Tangning.Tangning had given her the sweetest candy by allowing her to know her secret, but at the same time, she had given her a slap across the face in advance \u2013 even if Tangning did not rely on Mo Ting, Mo Ting was still her husband. No husband would watch their wife being bullied. So, there was no way she was going to betray Tangning.A thought suddenly crossed Lin Wei's mind...Long Jie could relate\u2026\"At this time, you must be thinking; the jerk and tramp outside are f*cken stupid, right?\" Long Jie rolled her eyes, \"You know how everytime Mo Yurou pulls the 'don\u2019t fight with me, you are no match for me' look? I am so tempted to tell her not to be stupid!\"Lin Wei nodded her head in agreement. This was exactly how she felt right now, in fact, she felt this with passion!Apart from being blind for a few years, Tangning could be considered to be in the highest level of EQ and IQ within the industry. However, who would have thought, at home, she had someone who was on the level of a king. How could cheap people like Han Yufan and Mo Yurou compare?How many more surprises did Tangning have hidden that was yet to be revealed? Just like that, she married Mo Ting. If Lin Wei was in her position, after having met a dozen jerks in the past, she too would have been willing!Because of Mo Ting's presence, Lin Wei and Long Jie felt they were exceptionally tinier than usual. Lin Wei even needed to find a peaceful spot to sit down and process everything she had just witnessed.Inside the private room. Tangning lay on top of Mo Ting's body. She had never expected, Mo Ting would wrap himself up to be delivered right into her hands.\"Are you surprised?\" Mo Ting asked as he gently touched Tangning's back.\"Uh huh.\" Tangning was in deep thought, but her heart felt extremely warm because she knew how busy Mo Ting was, \"Ting, you didn't have to do this, I can take care of myself.\"\"We are newlyweds, we shouldn't be separated...plus, I like giving you surprises. Of course, the way you called me just now...I like it even more, can you say it again?\" Mo Ting hooked his hand under her jaw as he made his request.\"Ting...\" Tangning repeated. With this, Mo Ting's kiss landed passionately on her lips.\"I also like to kiss you...\"It was easy to lose one's breath on board a plane, so, it wasn't long before Mo Ting released Tangning and embraced her in his arms, \"Sleep. Once you arrive in the US, you will be very busy.\"\"What about you? Are you going there just to accompany me?\" Tangning asked as she turned her head towards Mo Ting.\"If only...Hai Rui has many subsidiaries in the States, even if I was to simply inspect each one, it would take me a week.\" In reality, the most important thing was to purchase insurance for Tangning's legs, \"I have property in the US. If you can manage to think of an excuse to come live with me, that would be ideal...\"\"Over at Tianyi, I'm afraid things are a bit difficult. Han Yufan's older sister, Han Ruoxue, is relatively sinister,\" Tangning replied. \"Even though my relationship with her was pretty good before, in the end, she is still Han Yufan's sister. If Han Yufan was to ask, she would sell me out to become a backdrop for Mo Yurou.\"\"But, you don't appear to be afraid at all...\" Mo Ting had faith in his little wife.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Plus, I have you now,\" Tangning replied calmly, showing a sense of confidence.\"If it was not because we are on board the plane right now...I would kiss you until you can no longer breathe,\" Mo Ting tried to maintain his patience as he held back his urge to kiss her. Instead, he embraced her tightly as he enjoyed the unique fragrance emanating from her body.Meanwhile, Mo Yurou's assistant was trying to find out what Tangning was doing in First Class, however, he was blocked by the air-hostess and ended up being stuck on the outside - without any chance of entering.After a 12-hour long flight, the plane finally landed at 9am local time. Han Yufan's older sister, Han Ruoxue, was waiting at arrivals. Upon seeing them, she excitedly gave them all a hug - even Tangning.Even though his sister had an oriental-looking face, she was tall like a westerner. The clothes on her body were all limited designs - the only ones in the world!Unfortunately, she had one fault, which was her common look, otherwise, she could have pursued a career as an entertainer. Her only saving grace was that she had a good eye for talent; although her artists weren't extremely famous, they were still very influential in the western market.During the time that Tangning and Han Yufan were together, Tangning had only seen Han Ruoxue twice. Tangning did not like women that controlled others and Han Ruoxue was extremely controlling.\"Tangning, I have already heard about what happened between you and Yufan and I have already scolded him, but...you should keep work and personal relations separate. It's not right for you to cause trouble at work for your own personal gain,\" Han Ruoxue critiqued Tangning in front of everyone - obviously trying to establish a hierarchy of power.\"This time, for Secret Magazine's shoot, give me some face; listen to their requests and don't make things difficult for Yufan, OK?\"After hearing Han Ruoxue's words, Long Jie's heart filled with anger. Why isn't Han Ruoxue teaching Mo Yurou a lesson instead of picking on Tangning? Does she think, by schemingly bringing Tangning here, Tangning is now in her territory and she can make her suffer as she pleases?Tangning remained calm. She just looked at Han Ruoxue and smiled slightly. She did not lose her temper or agree to anything. Her reaction made it hard for Han Ruoxue to tell what plans she had running through her mind.The team headed towards the exit of the airport, while at the same time, Mo Ting and a few higher-ups from one of his American subsidiary companies were exiting the arrivals hall.Upon seeing Mo Ting, Han Ruoxue appeared to have spotted a superstar as she chased after him on her high heeled shoes. He was indeed too famous. Just like a born ruler, he was even more eye-catching than any celebrity...\"President Mo...President Mo...\"Upon hearing Han Ruoxue's calls, Mo Ting turned around to see Han Yufan's team approaching him. His gaze was focused on Tangning as they conversed through their eyes. Tangning understood the look in Mo Ting's eyes, he wanted her to find a chance to move to his house so she could stay by his side.Tangning smiled understandingly: she would try her best.Lin Wei and Long Jie knew why Mo Ting had turned around. They also knew Han Ruoxue would be stopped at least 2 meters away from Mo Ting...Of course, after turning around and seeing Tangning, Mo Ting pretended not to notice Han Ruoxue and directly boarded the Lincoln Limousine that was waiting for him...All Han Ruoxue could do was watch from a distance as Mo Ting left.Ridiculous! Long Jie sneered inside. Did you think 'anyone' could approach Tangning's Big Boss?Although Han Ruoxue did not get the chance to go up close to her idol, she was still extremely excited, \"I never expected I would run into Mo Ting here, he is so handsome!\"This time, it was Lin Wei who reacted on the inside. There's another thing you would have never expected: the person you were bullying just now, is Mo Ting's wife.Tangning maintained her composure as she gently put on her sunglasses like nothing had just happened. At the same time, Han Ruoxue returned to the imposing manner of a top manager as she spoke to the three of them, \"Tangning, since you just arrived in the US, go get some rest and adjust to the time difference. The driver will take you to the hotel. Yufan, Yurou and I have a family dinner to attend. You three, take care of yourselves.\"Family dinner...In other words, Han Ruoxue had already accepted Mo Yurou as her sister-in-law.To someone like Tangning, who was in a foreign land, without much resources and no connections to the media, it was easy for her to be at a disadvantage. Han Ruoxue obviously wanted Tangning to be at a loss.However, there was one thing she had forgotten. 3 years ago, Tangning had appeared in a few big American commercials. Although she hadn't reached the pinnacle of her career, she wasn't completely alone.\"I haven't been to the US for a long time, I will go visit some old friends. In fact, I might stay with them while I'm here, you can cancel the hotel room,\" Tangning responded calmly.\"That's fine, but, when we contact you to come on set, you better be on time,\" Han Ruoxue nodded in approval.During the entire time, Mo Yurou remained silent, soaking in the joy of how Han Ruoxue was treating Tangning. It was so obvious that Han Ruoxue was picking on her...But, no matter how much Han Ruoxue disliked her, for the sake of her younger brother, she held back a little.Since she is now in the US, does Tangning still think she can make a comeback?Mo Yurou completely believed this was the break she'd been looking for.Meanwhile, Han Ruoxue did have the intention to help Mo Yurou...but did she really think it would be that easy?After dealing with Tangning, Han Ruoxue left the airport with Han Yufan and Mo Yurou. After they left, Tangning phoned Mo Ting, \"Ting...have you gone far?\"\"What do you think?\" Mo Ting had already instructed his driver to wait in a hidden location; he knew Tangning would find a way to get away from the others. He was right.Tangning smiled to herself and waited quietly. In less than a minute, a Lincoln Limousine pulled up in front of her. The driver opened the door for her politely and welcomed her onboard in English.Tangning boarded the car with Long Jie and Lin Wei. This was Long Jie and Lin Wei's first time being so close to Mo Ting.However, neither of them had the courage to look at him directly......because only in front of Tangning would Mo Ting reveal his rare gentleness, whereas, in front of everyone else, he was cold like ice.\"Are you bothered by the shoot with Secret?\" Mo Ting asked as he handed her a glass of red wine and gently brushed his hand through her long dark hair.\"Those three are in the same boat, they will definitely create trouble for me. It wouldn't be unexpected for me to be replaced or even realize I've come in vain. I'm currently preparing myself mentally.\"\"Han Ruoxue is bullying our Tangning because she is unfamiliar here and has no fans!\" Long Jie complained angrily.\"Who told you I am unfamiliar here?\" Tangning asked Long Jie with a deeper meaning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The editor of the American Royal Magazine was also my mentor for half a month. However, they may not remember me now. Back then no one knew my Chinese name - they knew me as Kira,\" Tangning explained calmly.Hearing Tangning mention the names of famous European and American personalities, Long Jie and Lin Wei blinked their eyes in surprise.\"I know Han Ruoxue wants to get rid of me as soon as I'm of no use and is using me to boost Mo Yurou. Especially now that I'm in the US, she thinks I stand no chance.\"\"Hmmph, shameless!\" Long Jie grunted.\"I'm also familiar with the editor of the American Royal Magazine. Would you like to catch up with your mentor?\" Mo Ting, who had been quiet for a while, suddenly asked.\"Mo Ting, I've said it before, I don't want you helping me.\"\"Just treat it as a private get-together,\" Mo Ting smiled while one side of his perfect face shone charmingly under the sun.\"Hmmm...OK,\" Tangning nodded. Of course, she would never have expected, this private get-together would end up being the deciding factor in the fight between her and Mo Yurou.Mo Ting owned his own manor in the US, so there was no need to stay in a hotel. The pure American-style rooms were warm and cozy - more comfortable than any hotel suite. As it was a bit far from the Secret Headquarters, Mo Ting had already instructed Lu Che to find out the schedule for Secret. Lu Che was well prepared, he even knew what time they would be having dinner. Tangning found this very impressive, while Long Jie and Lin Wei couldn't help but to reflect on themselves.After having a quick shower, Tangning stood by the window and looked out. At this time, Mo Ting approached her wearing a black robe - his black hair was dripping wet with water.Tangning naturally took the towel out of his hands, stood on her tiptoes and started to dry the beads of water from his hair. Meanwhile, Mo Ting stared at her with a serious expression.\"What do you want? You are looking at me with so much focus...\"\"I was thinking, since it's daytime, whether I should do something I shouldn't...\" Mo Ting hooked onto Tangning's chin and gently kissed her on the lips - their tongues danced together. Afterwards, his soft lips slowly made it's way next to her ear as he whispered seductively, \"On board the plane, I wanted to keep kissing you...\"Tangning glanced out the window, worried people outside would see them, however, she couldn't resist Mo Ting's teasing as she found herself losing control of her body. She was weak in his arms.Their robes somehow found it's way onto the floor as they faced each other in their most vulnerable state. Losing control, they quickly found themselves on the soft bed.Because the lighting was bright, Tangning could clearly see Mo Ting's figure - it was comparable to a Western model. His body was not thin and weak like a typical Asian man, his body was firm and built with perfectly sculpted muscles. His skin glowed a healthy bronze - seeing his body drove Tangning crazy...Mo Ting was pleased to see her scanning his body - he too was impressed by hers.Tangning's body met international model standards; perfectly proportioned at 178cm tall, with measurements that were just right and a beautiful pair of pale long slender legs, it was hard to resist temptation around her.The two figures were like a pair of perfect bodies coming together;\u00a0this was a gift from heaven and meant to be.Mo Ting laughed, \"If we keep our figures like this for the rest of our lives, our chances of divorce would be zero.\"Tangning also responded with a laugh. She gently lifted her left hand and brushed Mo Ting's right ear, \"I love this mole of yours the most, it's like you were born with an earring.\"Mo Ting could no longer hold back his burning passion as he leaned over and pressed his lips against Tangning's. His warm palms also could not be controlled...Tangning released a quiet moan of pleasure as she reciprocated by passionately kissing Mo Ting's ear.The two continued affectionately. When they finally got tired, they embraced each other and fell asleep. After they woke up, they leaned against each other and whispered sweet words before affectionately doing what they wanted to do. Of course, as usual, they did not complete the last step of their intimacy, but Tangning still wished life like this would stand still - it was too perfect!...Meanwhile, Han Ruoxue was having dinner at the hotel with Han Yufan and Mo Yurou. Seeing Mo Yurou acting cautious, she quickly said, \"You shouldn't be so afraid of me.\"\"Ruoxue Jie...\"\"I am indeed not satisfied with you, but regardless, you are my brother's decision. Since we will become a family soon, I will definitely be on your side.\" Han Ruoxue cut the steak in front of her and placed a piece in her mouth. She then glanced gently at Mo Yurou, \"I know you and Tangning are like water and fire and Tangning is quite arrogant at the moment. Originally, because of what happened between you, I felt we owed her, but after the things she did recently, I feel like she is not worth the pity.\"\"The meeting with Secret will be at 8am tomorrow, but I have already told my assistant to tell her it is at 9am. Secret's editor hates people that are late, so...it's likely Tangning will be replaced tomorrow.\"\"But...wasn't the plan to have us attend the shoot together?\" Mo Yurou didn't understand Han Ruoxue's actions.\"I only said you were shooting together to create a topic of discussion and take the focus off your scandal. Now that we are in the US, it's not like she is the only Asian model around. When the time comes, we can easily find another model to work with you,\" Han Ruoxue explained.\"Tangning's not going to give up...\"\"This is the magazine's decision and has nothing to do with Tianyi. Once the shoot is over, your value will multiply. Whereas Tangning's career will suffer after people back at home find out about the cold reception she received here in the US. This ought to teach her a lesson.\"Tangning had said it before, Han Ruoxue was the type of person that enjoyed controlling her artists. So the look Tangning had when she landed, was enough to ignite Han Ruoxue's hatred. As if she wasn't going to find ways to make her suffer.Mo Yurou looked at the two people backing her and felt like she was about to become a superstar. How could Tangning, who had nothing, compete with her?Indeed, Lin Wei ended up being notified of the 9am meeting time by Han Ruoxue, but, Han Ruoxue had no idea, Mo Ting already had a precise schedule in his hands. So when Tangning saw there was a difference in the time, she could already guess what was going on.\"Tangning, it's obvious Tianyi wants to get rid of you, what should we do?\"\"Since Han Ruoxue wants me to be late, I'll be early instead...\" Tangning replied, \"But, both of you better be mentally prepared; I may be replaced.\"\"I've been prepared a long time ago,\" Lin Wei responded, \"At the same time, I have also prepared a way for you to get it back...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Secret's Headquarters. Tangning was already waiting in the meeting room at 7:30am after being escorted by the front desk staff. She was earlier than Han Ruoxue and the others by half an hour.Meanwhile, Mo Yurou was under the assumption that Tangning was still snoring away in bed.Never would she have thought, by the time they arrived at the meeting room, Tangning had already been waiting for quite some time.Han Ruoxue had a confused look on her face. She originally wanted Tangning to arrive at 9am - she was supposed to be so late, she wouldn't even be allowed in the meeting room. She planned it this way so Tangning wouldn't get the chance to find out she had intentionally given the wrong time. But right now, Tangning had arrived early. It was clear Tangning knew she had the intention to eliminate her. However, she didn't care, she was still the organizer of this event and no one could defy her.\"Tangning, why are you here so early?\" Mo Yurou asked frustratedly; it appeared Han Ruoxue's plan did not work on Tangning.\"My friend was passing by, so on the way to work, he dropped me off,\" Tangning explained calmly.\"Enough talking, the meeting is about to start,\" Han Ruoxue reminded the two to be quiet.Not long after, the person in charge entered the meeting room. She was a 40-something-year-old middle-aged woman. Behind her, followed two assistants that carried a huge stack of documents.\"Ruoxue, I have looked at the information regarding these two models.\" The woman raised her head and took one glance at both Tangning and Mo Yurou before she continued talking, \"However, I only want one of them. I know everyone's time is precious, so I'm not going to go around in circles; I want Mo Yurou. As for Tangning, I don't think she is suited to the theme of our shoot.\"She directly threw Tangning's portfolio on the table in front of them.\"It's OK if you don't want Tangning, I have other models for you to choose from.\" Things had panned out the way Han Ruoxue had expected. After all, Han Ruoxue had been implanting negative ideas of Tangning into this woman's head for quite some time. She immediately took out the portfolios of her other models and handed them to the woman in front of her. Not only did she find a way to get rid of Tangning, she managed to make good use of her - Mo Yurou had benefited and Han Ruoxue also had the opportunity to introduce some of her other models.\"Let me have a look before I make a decision,\" the woman asked her assistants to collect the portfolios and prepared to get up. However, Tangning held her back by suddenly speaking.\"May I ask what theme you speak of, Miss Mina?\"The woman obviously did not expect Tangning to speak up, so she replied, \"Oriental Trend, I assume a dull person like yourself isn't too suited.\"\"Has Miss Mina seen any of my works or seen me in any of my shows?\" Tangning challenged with a smile.\"Aren't you a...newcomer?\" she asked; she obviously had never heard of Tangning.\"Let me first ask you, was it Miss Han that told you I was a newcomer?\" Tangning remained calm - not wanting to sound overbearing.\"Tangning, don't go too far!\" Han Ruoxue quickly growled as she glared at Tangning, \"This is a decision between us, you don't have the right to question it.\"\"You used my popularity to bring Mo Yurou to the US and then used my name to boost your newcomers. You've used me so thoroughly, am I not allowed to ask a few questions?\" Tangning asked sharply as she smiled at Han Ruoxue.\"Tangning, you really don't know how to be tolerant.\"\"My tolerance isn't used to tolerate jerks, tramps and their wonderful relatives...\" Tangning said towards Han Ruoxue before she turned back to Miss Mina, \"Since you haven't seen any of my shows, then let's not bother putting on this act. How about this, let's bet...before we even hit tomorrow morning, you will already regret your decision.\" After the words left her mouth, Tangning took big steps as she led Long Jie and Lin Wei out of the room; putting on her sunglasses as she went.Miss Mina was stunned by Tangning's confidence. After Tangning left she immediately questioned Han Ruoxue, \"Who is this model?\"Han Ruoxue was so angry her face was glowing red. She straightforwardly replied, \"A newcomer model that will never get anywhere - no one important.\"Miss Mina didn't think much of it as she turned around to leave the meeting room, ready to hand over the rest of the meeting to other staff to discuss costs. At this time, Mo Yurou stood up and fueled Han Ruoxue's anger, \"Ruoxue Jie, Tangning's really beginning to not show any respect. She doesn't even have any regard for you.\"Han Yufan wasn't present; this was a fight amongst the girls. So, Han Ruoxue didn't have to hold back, \"She wants me to regret? Has she even taken a look at herself? Prepare yourself, once your value goes up, Tangning will have to kneel before you and polish your shoes.\"\"Yes Ruoxue Jie, I will not disappoint you.\"Mo Yurou promised to herself, she was going to teach Tangning a lesson and even if Tangning was to retaliate, she wasn't going to have a fighting chance.After leaving Secret's headquarters, Tangning returned to the manor with Lin Wei and Long Jie. Although they had mentally prepared themselves, Long Jie was still trembling in anger.\"I've never seen such a shameless person. The members of the Han family keep getting worse and worse.\"\"Tangning, what do you plan on doing now?\" Lin Wei questioned Tangning. \"We've already drawn the line with the Han siblings.\"\"You think if I hadn't drawn the line, they would have let me off easily?\" Tangning laughed, \"As I said earlier: Secret will personally give me a call tomorrow, or perhaps, they won't even be able to wait until tomorrow morning.\"\"OK, since you already have everything planned, we will just wait patiently for the result.\"Lin Wei was extremely curious how Tangning was going to turn the tables, but she also knew Tangning was a very careful person. Until she had 100% certainty, she wasn't going to reveal anything. So, all they could do now was sit and wait patiently.The truth was, even before Mo Ting had handed her an invite to the American Photography Exhibition that morning, Tangning already had other plans to deal with the situation. But Mo Ting's intention was obvious: since Mo Yurou recruited the help of Han Ruoxue, why couldn't she depend on him for once? After all, Mo Ting promised he wasn't going to come forward or help her pull relations; he simply gave her a chance at a fair fight with Mo Yurou. So, in the end, Tangning agreed to attend.The exhibition was to be attended by many famous photographers, magazines and personalities, including...people from Secret. Most importantly, her mentor, the editor of Royal Magazine was the organizer.The exhibition was scheduled for that night. So, after returning to the manor, Tangning quickly went to prepare. Even though the Entertainment Industry had its rules, it didn't mean there was no chance of change.Han Ruoxue thought she was in control, but tonight, Tangning was going to let her know, in reality, she was nothing. The consequences of her arrogance was, she would only be able to control B-grade models like Mo Yurou to satisfy her ego.She didn't need to remind everyone she was Kira, all she needed to do was stand beside her mentor and everyone would know, her status was above average.Her? A newcomer? Who said so?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He even personally picked out a gold-patterned strapless dress with a white lining. The pattern resembled an oriental ink painting. As the dress gave off a strong oriental aura, once worn on Tangning's body, she completely exuded the classic elegance of an oriental beauty - there was no doubt they matched perfectly. Paired with Tangning's slender waist and long legs...her feminine beauty and charm, in an instant, emanated from her body like a fragrance in the wind.Mo Ting stood behind Tangning and used his chest to firmly press against Tangning's back as he wrapped his hands around her waist - not willing to let go, \"You are like a piece of art.\"\"It's because you have good taste,\" Tangning returned the praise. She never knew Mo Ting understood her to this extent - he knew Secret wanted to shoot the Oriental Trend and knew Secret humiliated her for being a newcomer - so, he intentionally picked out this dress for them to see, by not picking Tangning, they had made a huge loss.\"Why must you be a model, I just want to keep you to myself,\" Mo Ting placed his chin on Tangning's shoulder and complained.\"Look who's talking, why not mention that even Han Ruoxue was going crazy at the sight of you?\" Tangning immediately complained back before she let out a laugh, \"Don't worry, aren't we only allowed to have physical contact with each other?\"\"Of course.\" After speaking, Mo Ting turned Tangning around and kissed her lips as they stood before the mirror, the two were extremely affectionate. Tangning could see her own expression through the mirror; Mo Ting's kiss really brought a person pleasure. Most importantly, whether it was affectionate or passionate, his lips belonged to only her. Just the thought of another woman kissing him made her heart uneasy.\"That's enough, I'm going to be late,\" Tangning's face flushed red as she gently pushed Mo Ting away from herself.\"When you get home, you better think of a way to compensate me,\" Mo Ting released her from his embrace.Tangning nodded as she kissed Mo Ting on the ear, \"You can have whatever compensation you want...\"The photography exhibition was to be held at 7pm inside one of America's abandoned parks. Tangning arrived not too late nor too early because, by the time she handed over her invite, there were already loads of famous people inside. Of course, amongst these people were her mentor, Ms. Bertha.Everyone was trying their best to stand out, but most of them had a Western style. Only Tangning was dressed in a charming oriental mini dress, immediately drawing the attention of people around her, including...the person in charge of Secret who had just rejected her earlier that day, Mina.She walked over to Tangning holding a glass of champagne with an amused expression before she spoke in a ridiculing tone, \"I never thought, for the sake of the front cover of our magazine, you would follow me all the way here.\"Tangning laughed gently in a dignified manner, \"I think you have misunderstood, Miss Mina.\"\"I don't think so. You obviously knew our theme would be the Oriental Trend so you deliberately dressed like this and appeared here. Unfortunately, once I've made a decision, I don't take it back.\" Mina thought, when Tangning said she would regret, she was referring to her appearance at this moment. Although she was indeed beautiful, Secret wasn't going to change their mind for the sake of one model.\"Also, Tianyi's President Han said you have a bad personality. Judging by what I see before me, he is right, you are indeed taking advantage of the situation to promote yourself.\"\"I've said it already, my appearance today has nothing to do with Secret,\" Tangning emphasized again with a louder voice attracting the attention of Ms. Bertha, who was currently showing some guests around the exhibition.\"You've really put in a lot of effort, no wonder Ruoxue told me to be careful of you.\"\"Miss Mina, you must really think highly of yourself.\" After speaking, Tangning's gaze diverted to the person standing behind Mina - it was Bertha. A smile appeared across her face, \"Mentor.\"Bertha looked at Tangning surprisingly before she emotionally wrapped Tangning in her embrace, \"Oh, my precious dear, it's been a long time. How have you been?\"\"I've been good. But mentor, I've got a problem,\" Tangning explained.After hearing this, Bertha remembered why she had walked over here in the first place, she had heard two people arguing. So, she released Tangning and turned to Mina, \"What is all this?\"How could this be?Mina was shocked. Wasn't Tangning here because she wanted to get back her front cover shoot?How does she know the editor of Royal Magazine? And why is their relationship so close?Tangning didn't hold back, she explained the entire incident to Bertha. Upon hearing everything, Bertha absolutely felt the people at Secret were out of their mind. In a straightforward manner, she released her anger upon Mina, \"This is why your magazine has been failing. How dare you reject my precious and choose a B-grade model instead, yet be so proud of yourself? My god, this is ridiculous. Did you know how many awards Kira received when she walked down the runways in France?\"\"She...isn't she a newcomer?\" Mina was dumbfounded.\"She's appeared at Master Bonne's show, in fact, she was in the finale. At that time, she was only 17 and you were still a nobody!\" After speaking, Bertha affectionately hugged Tangning, \"My precious, don't be upset. Whatever front cover you want, just let me know.\"Mina watched in disbelief as the two walked into the distance. Her blood began to boil. Because she had listened to Han Ruoxue, she gave up on Tangning. She couldn't believe she was stupid enough to 'buy the case and return the pearl*'.She couldn't let this happen, she had to get Tangning back.Inside, Mina only had this new objective, she had completely forgotten what she said earlier about changing her mind for the sake of one model.Tangning did not look back at Mina, because she could already guess what Mina was thinking right now. She turned down Bertha's offer as she began to recount all that had happened to her in the past few years, \"Mentor, I am clear on my position right now. I will take one step at a time to completely get back what was mine...I'm thankful for your good intentions.\"\"My precious, the most important thing in life is to know what you want. It's never too late to start again,\" Bertha nodded understandingly.\"Thank you, mentor.\"\"Look at you, you completely stand out in the crowd. You haven't changed at all.\"Upon hearing her praises, Tangning smiled humbly. She was humble because she knew there were so many people in this world with amazing abilities; she felt she was nothing in comparison.After the photography exhibition ended, Bertha ordered someone to escort Tangning home. At this moment, Mina suddenly came running out and stopped Tangning's car, \"Can you give me 5 minutes for a chat?\"\"What else do we have to chat about?\" Tangning asked directly.\"As long as you are willing to shoot our front cover, you can make whatever request you want - I will make sure to fulfill it.\"\"Even at the expense of going against Han Ruoxue?\" Tangning asked as she looked out the car window, in a casual but dangerous tone, \"I am a vengeful person.\"\"I've said it already, you can make whatever request and I will fulfill it, regardless of the expense.\"\"Then...I'll wait for you to show your sincerity,\" Tangning laughed as she wound up the car window and asked the driver to leave.Han Ruoxue, tomorrow you will realize, everything's changed...Translators Notes:* Buy the case and return the pearl (\u4e70\u691f\u8fd8\u73e0) - used to explain someone with poor judgment that doesn't know the true worth of something. This idiom originated from a story about a man that tried to sell his pearl by making a case from molan wood, embellishing it with gems and fumigating it with incense. In the end, a buyer buys the case and returns the pearl. Although the original story was more a mockery of the seller who failed to sell his pearl. The idiom these days is used to mock the buyer who failed to see that the pearl was worth much more than the case.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tangning simply laughed. She wasn't going to disappoint their expectations; especially not the man that thoughtfully helped her so much.Long Jie noticed Tangning's gaze was focused on the man sitting on the sofa flipping through documents. She smiled cheekily as she pushed Tangning towards him, \"We won't be light bulbs anymore, hurry over and keep him company!\"After speaking, Long Jie and Lin Wei returned to their own respective rooms. However, not long after, Long Jie ran back out holding her phone towards Tangning helplessly, \"Han Yufan is calling, do you want to pick up?\"Tangning took a quick glance at Mo Ting before she nodded, grabbing the phone from Long Jie's hands.\"Tangning, since the magazine has decided not to use you, you should return home first. There's no point for you to stay in the US. Don't blame my sister for being ruthless, she did it for the sake of Tianyi. The magazine wasn't happy with you, so you don't have the right to blame anyone,\" Han Yufan said, speaking like everything he and his sister did was right.\"After using me, you kicked me aside, now you want me to gladly accept all this?\" Tangning's tone was calm but contained a slight sense of ridicule.\"Why won't you give up? Why must you go against Mo Yurou? Why can't you just let us off?\" Han Yufan asked impatiently. Tangning felt like a heavy and annoying baggage that he was desperate to get rid of, but she just kept following him around.\"There is no reason for me to let despicable people off!\" Tangning's tone was firm, \"I know how the industry is like. Today Mo Yurou has backup, so she is capable of stepping all over me and is using me to benefit herself. But, that doesn't mean she will still be this fortunate tomorrow...\"\"You already have no chance, just let it go! The fact that I love Yurou, is not her fault. My sister was right, you indeed do not have any tolerance.\"Tangning suddenly clenched her left fist. Sensing the change in her emotions, Mo Ting reached out his comforting palm and pulled her into his warm embrace.Han Yufan was indeed a heartless person, otherwise, he wouldn't be able to treat Tangning this way. He took her love and destroyed her career, now he wanted her to support his new relationship - he was practically draining her of everything she had.\"Your selfishness will only push Mo Yurou further into hell.\" After speaking, Tangning hung up the phone and tried her best to calm herself down.Mo Ting put down his documents, held onto her hands and gently swayed her body.\"I'm fine. It's normal to be annoyed once in a while, it helps me train a stronger heart.\"\"Did you see your mentor?\" Mo Ting did not ask any further as he changed the topic.\"Uh huh, it went smoothly.\" Tangning naturally sat beside Mo Ting as she leaned against his arms, \"I also met a few famous photographers. Mo Ting, I was so happy...all that was missing was you. I couldn't help\u00a0thinking, if I could attend an event like that holding your hand, how perfect it would be.\"\"You will have plenty of chances in the future,\" Mo Ting responded suggestively.\"Are you tired? Should I give you a massage?\" Tangning asked as she knelt beside him. However, before she could do anything, Mo Ting turned towards her, grabbed hold of her hand and picked her up in his arms; carrying her horizontally.\"I want you to massage a different part of me...\"\"Hubby...I won't make you wait much longer...\" Under the moonlight, Tangning hugged Mo Ting and as the moment became more passionate, she mumbled, \"...because I realized, when I think of you kissing someone else, I feel extremely uneasy.\"...Early the next morning. Secret's Headquarters. Mina once again notified Mo Yurou and the others to attend a meeting. After writing up the contract yesterday, today they had to officially sign it.Mo Yurou wanted to take part in the magazine shoot as soon as possible because the child in her stomach was already over 1 month old. If things kept getting delayed, people would easily discover soon.The Top Ten Model Awards was to take place in half a months time. She wanted to use the results from Secret's shoot to obtain an award, that way she would be able to climb up the ranks to become an A-grade model. As Secret was a weekly publication, her appearance in the magazine would be before the awards ceremony. So, whether she would be able to influence the Oriental Trend, would go towards her assessment for the Top Ten Model Awards qualifications.5 minutes later, Mina entered the meeting room. She glared at Mo Yurou and Han Ruoxue with a mocking expression, however, they didn't realize.\"Mina, we are ready to go. We can get started with the shoot as soon as you are ready. Don't worry, Yurou is an extremely professional model, she will definitely complete the task given by Secret and ignite the Oriental Trend.\"\"Also, we have already organized for Tangning to fly home, she won't be causing us any more trouble...after all, you know she's not easy to deal with.\"Mina sneered as she played with the pen in her hand, \"What should we do now? Sorry, Ruoxue, unfortunately, I didn't ask you here to sign the contract...I...asked you here to change models again.\"After speaking, Mina tore the contract in Mo Yurou's hands into shreds, \"I'm no longer using either of your models. This is the condition the model I want has given me.\"Upon hearing this, Han Ruoxue slammed her hands on the table angrily, \"Mina, what do you mean by this?\"Han Ruoxue had never thought Secret would go back on their words.\"Can't you understand what I'm saying? I said I won't be signing Mo Yurou. For the sake of your family's personal matters, you've shoved an unworthy model into my hands. Han Ruoxue, is this how you treat your friends?\"\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Han Ruoxue had a surprised expression.\"Fine, let me ask you one thing: why did you tell me Tangning is a newcomer? She is already internationally renowned and has received multiple awards. She is even the disciple of Royal Magazine's editor, yet you intentionally told me she's a newcomer. Were you afraid I wouldn't take Mo Yurou, so you deliberately defamed her?\" Mina exclaimed loudly.\"I...\" Han Ruoxue was choked up.\"Did you know, because of your selfishness, how humiliated I felt at last night's photography exhibition?\"Mina continued to blame Han Ruoxue regardless of their past friendship, \"Han Ruoxue, I don't care what you do when no one is looking, but in front of me you better contain your scheming.\"\"But, you can't just say you don't want her like that. You've seen Mo Yurou's abilities before...\"\"Regarding this matter...I have no say - I've already made a promise to the model I've worked so hard to sign. If you want to plead, go speak to her. As long as she agrees to work with Mo Yurou, I have no opinion.\" Mina placed the shredded contract on the table and turned to ask her assistant, \"Has she arrived?\"\"Yes, she's arrived.\"Hearing all this, Han Ruoxue clenched her teeth, \"Let me see who this model that has made you shred up our contract and sever our ties is.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, Han Yufan and Mo Yurou also stared angrily at the door. Who was it this time that was ruining everything for them?Mo Yurou felt like her heart was about to explode from anger. It wasn't easy to get rid of Tangning, yet who would have thought, 'the mantis stalks the cicada, but behind them lurks the oriole*'. She was surprised there was someone else trying to challenge them.The atmosphere in the meeting room was extremely intense. At this moment, the meeting room's door flew open and in walked a beautiful figure who caught everyone's attention.Tangning!It's actually Tangning!It's Tangning again!Han Ruoxue clenched her fist; she never thought Tangning would be able to convince Mina to go back on her words. Mo Yurou and Han Yufan stood up in shock simultaneously.This was impossible, Tangning was already eliminated. How did she make Secret change their minds?\"After careful consideration, everyone at Secret has decided to use Tangning as our model,\" Mina announced in front of the people in the room. She then gave a trivial look at the trio, \"As I'm aware, she is also a model from Tianyi, but why do I feel like you aren't happy at all. Is it possible that Tangning isn't actually a model of yours?\"\"Tangning, what schemes did you use? Why did you have to steal the front cover that belonged to me?\" Mo Yurou couldn't hold back her anger as she questioned Tangning.\"The front cover that belonged to you?\" Tangning maintained her smile, not allowing anyone to see through her emotions, \"You used my popularity to go overseas, under the guise of sharing the stage; you used me to created a topic of discussion to distract the public from your scandal; as soon as we arrived in the US, you got rid of me after I no longer had any use; you defamed me in front of the client and faked my portfolio. So, tell me, how does this front cover belong to you?\"\"I only retrieved what belonged to me and recovered the fairness I deserved.\"\"You used your background to step all over me for your benefit, while I used my own capabilities to retrieve my front cover. I don't steal from anyone...but, I'm not going to let others step all over me - it's that simple.\"Each word that came out of Tangning's mouth was clear and precise - full of power. Making Mina, who originally misunderstood her, look at her in admiration.What a strong character!\"Tangning, I've said it before, this is the most important time for Mo Yurou. Everyone in Tianyi should be helping her get through this obstacle.\" Han Yufan verbally attacked Tangning angrily, \"Can you not be so selfish?\"\"The reason she's faced with an obstacle is because of you. I've said it before, no matter how much you want to support her, I have no opinion and don't care, but...if she wants to advance by stepping on me, I will only make her fall pitifully.\"\"Tangning, Mina mentioned...as long as you say it, Yurou can still participate in the Secret photo shoot. She doesn't have much time left, she will be partaking in the Top Ten Model Awards soon.\"\"Why must I agree? If she is having difficulties, it is her problem, why is it my obligation to help her? Is there a law for it?\" Tangning asked in an amused tone. \"Isn't Ruoxue Jie really capable? Get her to secure a job with another magazine...\"\"Tangning, don't go too far,\" Han Ruoxue stomped her feet in anger.Mina couldn't be bothered to continue watching Tianyi's people fight amongst each other. She gently patted Tangning's shoulder and said, \"Tangning, I'll wait outside. Tell me your decision after half an hour. Whether it will be a solo shoot or a shoot with you and Mo Yurou, you decide.\"\"Thank you, Mina,\" Tangning nodded. It was good timing, as she had much more to say that wasn't convenient to say in front of outsiders.\"I've asked for a few bodyguards to stand guard at the door, if anyone wants to do anything to you, just scream.\"Tangning smiled again and looked at Lin Wei and Long Jie, hinting that in this situation, she may not necessarily be at a disadvantage. As soon as Mina left the room, Han Ruoxue slammed her hand on the table and questioned Tangning, \"What is it that you want?\"\"This is not how you treat someone you are asking a favor from...\" Tangning said firmly to Han Ruoxue. \"What your brother has done, I am sure you already know. In this industry, it is clear that the strong get all the support, while the weak get stepped all over. I know it doesn't matter what I say to you. Since we both hate the look of each other, what's the point of working together? You should go plead to someone else.\"Han Ruoxue's eyes were red, but at this moment, there was nothing she could do.After all, she was the manager of a different company. The fact that she was helping Tianyi was already a breach of her contract; she couldn't help Mo Yurou out in the open.Plus, chances didn't come around easily.So, she had no choice but to soften her tone, \"Tell me what you want Tangning, if you go too far, both of us won't benefit from it.\"\"Mo Yurou said I stole something that belonged to her.\"\"No, Mo Yurou needs your guidance,\" Han Ruoxue clenched her teeth as she responded to Tangning. In reality, she wanted so desperately for Tangning to immediately disappear.Tangning also felt the same towards her. However, the provocation from these people in front of her, made her understand, if she couldn't reason with them, she should make a choice to benefit herself. So, after taking a quick glance at Mo Yurou's defiant expression, she raised her eyebrows and said, \"I'll give Mo Yurou a chance...under one condition.\"\"Speak,\" Han Ruoxue said as she held back her anger.\"I want Tianyi to promise from now on, who I work with, will be decided by me personally. In other words, I will take on whatever job I want, Tianyi has no right to step in. They also have no right to arrange for jobs I do not agree to,\" Tangning said straightforwardly.\"That's impossible,\" Han Ruoxue was firm, \"What difference would this be to canceling your contract or opening a personal studio?\"\"You can turn it down, after all, in the end, I will still make it happen. But, are you sure, Mo Yurou can continue to wait?\"Han Ruoxue glanced at Han Yufan. They both looked down and contemplated for a moment. In the end, Han Ruoxue told Tangning: \"At most, I can only allow you to voice your opinion. In other words, we won't arrange jobs for you without you knowing. In regards to your choice of clients, the company definitely needs to be in control, otherwise, if you randomly choose to work with cheap no-name companies, what would happen to our company's reputation?\"\"Tangning, no artist can tread on top of their company's head.\"\"The company can be in control, but...I need all the higher-ups to be present whenever a decision is made because I no longer have trust in Han Yufan.\"\"Other companies provide their artists with the best resources. I don't expect you to do that for me, I just don't want you to interfere. One more thing...do not tie Mo Yurou into everything.\"Han Ruoxue sneered. She didn't believe Tangning was capable of much, all this was just a rash decision. Once Mo Yurou's status was elevated, Tianyi wouldn't have any difficulty defaming Tangning again. When the time comes, she would create a problem for Tangning that she was sure Tangning wouldn't be able to get herself out of.So she agreed - right now, this was the best decision she could make.Since she couldn't directly step all over Tangning, all she could do was...make her share a stage with Mo Yurou. She couldn't wait to see, with a top manager like herself, whether Tangning could manage to be better than Mo Yurou.\"I agree,\" Han Ruoxue responded as she nodded her head.Translator's notes:* the mantis stalks the cicada, but behind them lurks the oriole (\u87b3\u8782\u6355\u8749\u9ec4\u96c0\u5728\u540e) - an idiom used to explain someone who is short-sighted and only focuses on the gains before them without seeing the bigger picture; unaware of other dangers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn't just throw her temper around, instead, she directly approached Han Ruoxue and demanded for her rights!From now on, Tianyi no longer had the right to interfere with her jobs. In other words, she was partially independent from her contract.Because Tangning understood these despicable people too well, she definitely had to make sure she had the right to make her own decisions - she couldn't let what happened with Secret happen again.What she did was better than simply humiliating them.Tangning's mind was clear.Lin Wei sincerely believed, even if Tangning didn't have her as a manager and didn't have an assistant, she could still get far on her own. On that note, which artist had the capability to lead their manager instead? However, even though she knew this, Lin Wei was still not willing to leave Tangning. By following Tangning, there was so much for her to learn.Especially when Tangning said she was only recovering the fairness she deserved, it struck a chord with Lin Wei. In this industry, she didn't believe fairness existed, but, Tangning was different...she wasn't worried at all about sharing a stage with Mo Yurou. With Tangning's abilities, disposing of Mo Yurou was way too easy.All along, in Tangning's heart, she had been hoping for a chance to challenge Mo Yurou in a fair fight. Since she had previously been a substitute for Mo Yurou, she needed to use this opportunity to prove to the public, by substituting Mo Yurou, it didn't mean she wasn't capable. For her, winning against Mo Yurou was like playing a simple game.Ultimately, now that the two parties had come to an agreement, Tianyi could no longer casually plan out Tangning's jobs. From now on, Tangning's jobs would have to pass through a vote by the company's higher-ups. With their supervision, Han Yufan would no longer be able to hide the truth from the masses. From now on, the jobs that Tangning was to propose would have the potential to make so much money...there was no way they would reject them.Meanwhile, Tangning agreed to allow Mo Yurou to participate in the Secret photo shoot with her. The two of them would work together to influence the Oriental Trend...After hearing Tangning's decision, Mina was surprised by her willingness to accept Mo Yurou. Towards Tangning, she couldn't help but gain a sense of respect. How strong-willed was she to tolerate her enemy's attacks of humiliation, even when they almost destroyed her?\"Tangning, you really surprise me. I am looking forward to seeing you on the front cover. Regarding the multiples times that I have misjudged you, I feel extremely apologetic.\"\"It's OK,\" Tangning showed that it didn't bother her. Tangning understood these business people well, and because of this understanding, she was aware, it was more advantageous to convince them than to offend them.\"I wish our cooperation goes well.\"Before leaving, Han Ruoxue and the others glared at Tangning - there was a chilling look in their eyes. From now on the Han family and Tangning were completely at odds with each other. But, it didn't matter. If she was afraid, she would not have spoken out at the meeting today.As she was exiting Secret, Han Ruoxue gave Tangning a word of warning, \"I don't know if you are too smart or too stupid. Tangning, even though you have been famous before, that is all in the past. How dare you go against the company for the sake of gaining such a small benefit, especially when you don't have a strong backing. Although you will get to enjoy a few days of happiness, it won't last for long.\"\"You don't need to worry about this,\" Tangning replied calmly.Long Jie sneered from behind. Tangning had Mo Ting; even if Tangning wasn't anything, she was still the wife of Hai Rui Entertainment's CEO. Wait til' the day the truth comes out, you idiots will be shocked beyond belief.\"Tangning, originally I still remembered all the good times we had together, but after today, all I have for you is disgust,\" Han Yufan said towards her while Mo Yurou was wrapped in his embrace. The look in his eyes was icy cold and filled with hatred.Mo Yurou was pleased, this was the first time Han Yufan seriously expressed his hatred towards Tangning. This also meant, from now on, no matter what Tangning did, there would be no chance they would get back together...To Tangning, this was the ultimate blow...Of course, this was all in Mo Yurou's mind, because at this moment, Tangning who had heard these words as she was leaving, simply laughed, \"I thought you would have sensed the disgust I have towards you ages ago.\"Tangning's calm response made Long Jie and Lin Wei burst out in laughter. Afterwards, the three of them boarded their car and drove out of sight, not glancing back even once.\"Ahhh....\" Long Jie shouted in satisfaction, \"Today was so refreshing, haha. Tonight I must drink some champagne to celebrate. Just the thought of Han Ruoxue's screwed up face makes me want to take a photo of it and show it to her so she can see how ugly she is.\"Lin Wei turned around to look at Tangning from the front passenger seat. There were things she wanted to know, \"It was all part of your plan to make them allow you to voice your opinion right?\"\"If I didn't do this, up until Mo Yurou gets pulled down from her perch, they will continue to use me to boost themselves. So, I had to get the right to voice my opinion.\" Tangning looked down at the supplementary contract written by Han Yufan and carefully analyzed if there were any flaws. She realized she didn't understand a lot of the legal terms;\u00a0Mo Ting would need to handle this.\"Does that mean...you are going to bring down Mo Yurou?\" Lin Wei was not aware that Mo Yurou was pregnant yet.\"The time is not yet right...\"Lin Wei looked into Tangning's eyes and stopped asking. If Tangning was to tell her something, she would say it sooner or later. Right now, the only thing Lin Wei could do was convince Tangning to trust her more. This was the only way for their bond to become unbreakable.\"Haha! Mo Yurou actually wants to compete with you. Tangning, make her into your backdrop!\"Of course, there was no point thinking too far ahead. Secret's photo shoot was the most important thing in front of them and all the fans were waiting to see who was better.After returning to the manor, Mo Ting wasn't home yet. The three women sat on the rug in the living room casually drinking some red wine, \"Tangning, can you cook for us? I'm so sick of the American fast food.\"\"But, I don't want to do anything...\" Tangning leaned against the sofa lazily.\"Dear God, we still have to eat a whole week of steak, chips and hamburgers...\"\"Ask my husband to cook...\" Tangning smiled, \"However, I don't think he'll cook enough for you two.\"\"Are you saying Big Boss can cook?\" Long Jie looked like she had just made a huge discovery as she grabbed onto Tangning's arms and asked.\"His cooking isn't too bad either.\"\"Tangning...Tangning, please give our mouths the honor to experience his cooking...\" Long Jie joined her hands together full of sincerity - she wanted to know if Big Boss was really as great as Tangning made him out to be, \"Just a small bite, a small bite is enough.\"\"That's not difficult to do,\" at this time Mo Ting's voice resounded from behind them. Tangning looked at Mo Ting - under the sun, his handsome face was irresistible. \"To celebrate Tangning retrieving what originally belonged to her, I will cook. However, from now on, if anyone asks Tangning to go into the kitchen again, I won't be nice to them.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Long Jie was too intimidated to say anything as she thought to herself. On the other hand, Tangning gently laughed - Mo Ting's thoughtfulness made her heart feel warm, like the sun on a winter's day.Tangning shared the outcome from Secret's meeting by handing over the amended contract to Mo Ting. Mo Ting sat on the sofa gently running his hand through Tangning's hair. The scene was so natural and heartwarming - like the world's most beautiful painting.\"The entertainment industry changes as often as the wind and clouds; it\u2019s common for a newcomer to make a break every day, so it's hard to predict what would happen tomorrow. Han Ruoxue must be still dreaming about giving Mo Yurou a comeback, that's why she agreed to amend the contract so easily. She must be thinking, if Mo Yurou successfully makes a comeback, she could easily step all over you again.\"\"That's right, that's right! I just browsed the news and did a search for Mo Yurou's name. The search results were all about the battle between her and Tangning. All the 'so-called modeling industry experts' have started comparing the works between the two and a few 'so-called people within the industry' have stepped out to say, since Tangning has been a substitute for Mo Yurou, if they were to share a stage, Tangning would only become a second Mo Yurou. They also said Mo Yurou is the most beautiful oriental model and that she has the capability of starting up the oriental trend...\"\"If that\u2019s not enough, they are even comparing different parts of their body, saying, apart from her legs, Tangning has no advantage in any other aspect.\"\"They are spreading opinions like, Mo Yurou was born stylish, whereas Tangning was born dull. What a joke! Mo Yurou isn't even on the same level.\" Just the thought of it made Long Jie angry.\"This is what they typically do to create hype, it's not worth getting angry over. Just let Mo Yurou enjoy it while she can,\" Tangning comforted Long Jie.Mo Ting remained silent as his obsidian-like eyes lit up with amusement and mockery. Tangning took a quick glance at Mo Ting and shook his knee as she asked, \"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\"\"Let her overconfidence kill her,\" Mo Ting responded simply.Tangning held tightly onto Mo Ting's hand. As expected, there was only one person who understood her the most and didn't require her to waste time and effort to explain to - this was Mo Ting.Since the statement that Han Ruoxue released was solely focused on supporting one while stepping on another and was obviously biased towards Mo Yurou, then they should give Han Ruoxue what she wanted. They planned to inflate Mo Yurou's ego and make everyone have high hopes for her. At the same time, they would make her become known as an upcoming superstar in the modeling industry so she gains the attention of current famous models. Like this, the higher Mo Yurou climbs, the harder she would fall after everyone sees her skills.\"When the time comes, we won't have to say anything or help others gain more popularity...all you have to do is show your skills and that would be your best attack.\"Lin Wei listened to Mo Ting and then looked at Tangning. In front of Han Yufan, Tangning was sharp like a hedgehog - no one could get close enough to take advantage of her. However, in front of Mo Ting, Tangning was a delicate little woman that needed her husband to protect her. She didn't depend on Mo Ting, but she would listen attentively to Mo Ting's opinions. It seemed, deep down, only Mo Ting could make her completely submissive.To everyone, Tangning was strong and firm; only in front of Mo Ting, did she show her weaknesses - she definitely treated him differently.This married couple...is a perfect match, Lin Wei thought.Looking at the intelligent team in front of her, deep down, Lin Wei was already looking forward to the miracle Tangning would create for Secret.As for the overconfident Mo Yurou, she was curious how Tangning would be able to destroy her now that Han Ruoxue had raised her ego so high.Inside the kitchen, Mo Ting had already rolled up his sleeves and was busy preparing dinner. At this time, Tangning had just finished washing up and was wearing Mo Ting\u2019s shirt as she slowly approached him from behind and gave him a hug, \"Ting\u2026\"\"It\u2019s greasy and smoky in here, go wait for me outside,\" Mo Ting was focused on the fish in his hands.\"What should I do? You\u2019re so nice to me, I\u2019m starting to get scared,\" Tangning said as she leaned in closer to Mo Ting\u2019s back, \"You know that when it comes to relationships, I don\u2019t have a sense of security. I\u2019m afraid, one day, you will abandon me and run off as well\u2026\"\"Then are you going to just stand there and watch me leave? If that day really comes, the Tangning that is so ambitious with her career, won\u2019t she have the courage to hold on to me? I also need to be coaxed sometimes\u2026\"Hearing Mo Ting\u2019s last sentence, Tangning smiled cheekily as she grabbed one of his hands and forced herself between his arms. She then slowly undid the top two buttons of his shirt to faintly reveal his chest muscles, before placing her head inside his shirt. From his shirt came her eyes...\"You are really distracting me from cooking,\" Mo Ting let out a laugh.Up to this point, Tangning had her back against Mo Ting\u2019s chest, but after hearing his words, she suddenly turned around, her ice cold lips pressed firmly on his chest, \"Are you referring to\u2026this?\"Mo Ting calmly washed his fishy hands under the sink before wrapping his arms tightly around Tangning, \"Are you planning to give me dessert before dinner?\"Tangning's finger drew circles inside Mo Ting's shirt, \"Am I sweet enough for you?\"Mo Ting stopped breathing as he pulled Tangning's finger out from his shirt. He then lifted her chin and forcefully placed his lips on hers, \"I'll need to have a taste to see how sweet you are...\"Mo Ting loved how Tangning had so many different sides to her when it came to moments like this - it was so different to her usual gentleness. Sometimes she was enchanting; sometimes she was out of control; sometimes she would let herself loose. No matter how she acted, the result was the same - it always made him want her.Their dancing tongues were mixed with ambiguous breaths - dinner had become a lot more satisfying. Mo Ting's hand brushed against Tangning's legs.This reminded him\u2026it was about time to give her the other surprise he had been preparing...By the time dinner was ready to be served, 2 hours had passed. Upon seeing the feast before her, the word surprise was not enough to describe how Long Jie was feeling\u2026never would she have expected, the famous CEO of Hai Rui, The Big Boss of the Entertainment Industry, was so thoughtful - no wonder Tangning was so willingly obedient towards him.\"Thank you Big Boss, for this reward!\"\"Control your impulsive look of wanting to auction this food off,\" Tangning couldn\u2019t hold back her laughter as she giggled. \"How did you know I was thinking that Tangning? I feel so lucky\u2026\" Long Jie rubbed against Tangning\u2019s arm. \"By the way, what were you and Big Boss doing in the kitchen for 2 hours?\"\"Hurry and eat. After dinner we have something important to do,\" Mo Ting quickly changed the subject.\"What do you have planned?\" Tangning showed interest.\"You will know when the time comes\u2026\" Mo Ting brushed his hand through her hair lovingly. Long Jie and Lin Wei were completely envious; from their observation, no one else in this world could make Tangning so obedient and full of admiration.However, the biggest surprise of the night, was yet to come\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When they arrived, there were already a few American men sitting inside waiting for them.Tangning did not understand what Mo Ting wanted to do, but Mo Ting gently comforted her, \"No need to be nervous.\"Not long after, the American man in charge stepped forward and started chatting to Mo Ting. It was at this time that Tangning overheard their conversation and finally understood what was going on \u2013 Mo Ting wanted to purchase insurance for her legs.It wasn\u2019t unusual for famous people to insure parts of their body, but\u2026they mostly did it to create attention, so Tangning quickly grabbed onto Mo Ting, \"Mo Ting\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026\"\"Don\u2019t overthink it. Your legs need protecting because they are the most beautiful legs I\u2019ve ever seen on the modeling stage\u2026\"\"But\u2026\" Tangning was still unsure.\"Listen to me,\" Mo Ting nudged her towards the valuer. \"You never let me do anything for you. Are you going to deny me the right to buy you insurance as well?\"Tangning couldn\u2019t refuse. Even though her legs were beautiful, at the moment she wasn\u2019t very famous, so she assumed the cost wouldn\u2019t be too high. With this in mind, Tangning gave up resisting and let the valuer do his job.However\u2026before the valuer could give a quote, Mo Ting stepped in to say, \"No matter what the final estimated value is, I want to increase the insured amount by ten times.\"If that\u2019s the case\u2026\u2026then that would be over 100 million dollars!Standing quietly to one side, Lin Wei and Long Jie were in shock over what they were witnessing. Most importantly, Mo Ting wasn\u2019t doing this to create attention, he was merely helping Tangning secure a guarantee. The final benefactor of this insurance would be Tangning; from now on, no matter what happened to her legs, she would be covered by insurance.Mo Ting really spoilt Tangning!Tangning was quiet the entire time, a million thoughts were running through her mind. However, Mo Ting placed his arm around her shoulder and said, \"This complex industry is chaotic and unsafe; I can\u2019t guarantee that 10 or 20 years from now, Hai Rui will still be as successful. So, I want to do all that I can to give you a peace of mind. I want the path ahead of you to be protected.\"\"Then, why don\u2019t you also buy one for yourself?\" A tear slowly snuck its way out of Tangning\u2019s eye.Mo Ting leaned over and chuckled into Tangning\u2019s ear, \"Because I don\u2019t have beautiful legs like yours\u2026\"In that moment, under the beautifully lit room, Tangning only had Mo Ting in her eyes \u2013 the Mo Ting that did things for her without expecting anything in return. She had originally married him with a motive, but he never minded, instead he gave her faith that he loved her wholeheartedly.\"Because of what you\u2019ve done, do you know how many promises I am making to myself?\"\"Huh?\"\"I\u2019ve promised myself to never leave this man, unless I die,\" Tangning responded in seriousness.Mo Ting laughed with his usual poise and charm. As long as it was something he found worth it, he would be willing to give up anything without regrets \u2013 Tangning was the first person that made him do things without asking anything in return...Such was life: one person trampled over her heart, while another treated her like treasure. That's why no one should ever be broken hearted over a jerk; as long as one is persistent, there will always be someone better out there who is willing to give them the warmth they wish for.\"Tangning is now precious\u2026\" Long Jie whispered quietly to Lin Wei.\"She\u2019s insured for over 100 million dollars\u2026that\u2019s enough to buy Tianyi outright.\"\"You don\u2019t know how tempted I am to thank Han Yufan the jerk, for sparing our Tangning from marrying him,\" Long Jie winked at Lin Wei. \"I want to see him hug that shameless B-grade model and get out of our sight, as far as possible\u2026\"\"Never would Han Yufan imagine, while he is using all his brain power to think of ways to go against Tangning, there is someone who is willing to invest 100 million dollars on insurance for her.\"\u2026Indeed, as the Secret shoot was fast approaching, Han Yufan was endlessly contacting the Chinese media \u2013 trying to give Mo Yurou as much exposure as possible. He released statements about Mo Yurou being better than so-and-so and Mo Yurou completely out-shining so-and-so, making her exposure inflate dramatically. In comparison, Tangning who also released statements, only got mentioned here and there and whenever she was mentioned, it was always just a few lines amongst news about Mo Yurou.Fans became anxious. Members of the Official Fan Club contacted Lin Wei multiple times to ask her how Tangning was going, but Tangning always gestured her to stay quiet.Lin Wei understood. Overseas, Secret Magazine was merely a third-class publication, there was no need to make such a fuss over it \u2013 this would only make Tangning appear short-sighted and shallow.So, Lin Wei simply responded with 4 words: Have faith in Tangning.With these 4 words, Tangning\u2019s fans felt a sense of relief. Judging by how Tangning handled herself previously, they knew she held a low profile and kept to herself; no matter what happened, good or bad, she was clear about what she wanted and always had a plan.\"President Han, back at home, Mo Yurou\u2019s support has increased once again\u2026\" Mo Yurou\u2019s assistant said as he looked at the comments online.\"And how are the reactions towards Tangning?\" Han Yufan questioned.\"All thanks to Ruoxue Jie\u2019s PR, we successfully used Tangning to boost Yurou\u2019s popularity and then we used the names of top celebrities to boost Yurou\u2019s value, hence the newer statements we released naturally didn\u2019t require Tangning. Although we have offended the fans of others, but Tangning\u2019s rate of being mentioned is only a small portion of Mo Yurou\u2019s.\"\"This is the result of the statements\u2026\" Han Ruoxue looked at the path she was laying out for Mo Yurou and sneered, \"Right now, we have interest and popularity all in the palm of our hands, however\u2026to truly win against Tangning, we have to wait for the result from the Secret photo shoot. If Yurou\u2019s performance is as good as our results so far, then once we return home, Tangning won\u2019t even exist anymore\u2026\"\"I am confident,\" Mo Yurou promised to the few people in front of her, \"I\u2019ve seen Tangning\u2019s shows. I don\u2019t feel like I am any worse than her. Plus, don\u2019t forget, she was previously my substitute.\"Of course, this was because Mo Yurou had no idea, in order to imitate her, Tangning had to dramatically drop her standards.\"With regards to the photographer, I will go work my PR magic. For the front cover shoot I will arrange for them to make you the main focus. Yurou, make sure to think carefully about how you will pull off the theme of Oriental Trend.\"\"I will think about it carefully.\"\"This will be your first time sharing the stage with Tangning. You should know, it's not just your reputation that's on the line. If you fail, the whole of Tianyi will be humiliated along with you. As for Han Yufan, people will end up doubting his judgment, so this battle, you must win,\" Han Ruoxue told Mo Yurou in a serious tone.\"After yesterday's humiliation, I will definitely make sure to get revenge,\" Mo Yurou said with determination. Because of her rise in popularity, she was now full of confidence.Tomorrow, her and Tangning would be having a battle of life and death!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They of course knew, this was all Han Ruoxue's effort to boost Mo Yurou. The Internet Age had always been like this: only yesterday, Mo Yurou was still the mistress on everyone's lips, but today, the tramp had become a goddess - she was the perfect model in their eyes. This was the Entertainment Industry where no one could predict what would happen to them the next day.However, there was no doubt, Tianyi was completely invested in Mo Yurou...Before the magazine started their shoot, Mo Yurou's team had already arrived at the entrance of Secret's headquarters.\"For the sake of Mo Yurou, the jerk has given all he's got. I heard there will be an interview between the two of you before the shoot,\" Long Jie looked at the photos online unhappily. At the same time, she expressed her concerns, \"Tangning, are you really not going to do anything? Look at Mo Yurou, she has 3 appearances a day, she interacts with her fans and she has a team to help her - she is being treated like an international superstar.\"\"She's out-shining some of the most famous international supermodels, it's normal for her to be treated like a superstar,\" Tangning sat in the car flipping through a previous edition of Secret's magazines. \"Today, the two of you must learn how to compliment others and improve your manners.\"\"There's nothing to compliment about!\" Long Jie didn't understand what Tangning had in mind. Meanwhile, Lin Wei had already caught on as she turned her head towards Long Jie and reminded her, \"Have you forgotten what Tangning said last night?\"Long Jie thought for a moment before finally remembering, \"Oh yes, let her overconfidence kill her.\"This was a common trick used in the industry. Many management agencies used this method to teach their artists a lesson, especially the ones that were arrogant after gaining a little bit of fame. They would boost them to the top, make them and others believe they were on top of the world, then they would pull them down from their perch and let them realize, they were but a tiny speck in the world - small like an ant.Since Mo Yurou wanted to be on top of the world so badly, they would let her be. Han Ruoxue had already made enough enemies for her...Of course, everything Han Ruoxue did was to convince Mo Yurou she had no choice but to rely on Tianyi; it was a warning that once she became famous, she better not think about finding another company.\"For Mo Yurou, Han Ruoxue has really put in her all. Too bad Mo Yurou's ability can't support her ambitions.\"\"Whether she can continue to support her, we will have to see after the shoot,\" Tangning was calm as usual, this was her normal expression whenever she wasn't around Mo Ting - no one could ever tell what she was thinking. Her smile was a mask she wore to fight back against all the fakeness in the world.Not long after, they arrived at the Secret Headquarters. Tangning was escorted to the waiting room that was prepared by the magazine - of course, this room was to be shared with Mo Yurou.Secret's fashion stylist quickly measured Tangning's body whilst praising her pair of stunning legs. Afterwards, she handed Tangning a traditional Chinese dress, \"With your personality, I feel like you suit clothing with lighter colours.\"Tangning smiled, towards the stylist's suggestion, she had no comment.Probably because they were from different professions they didn't think the same way, but Long Jie still couldn't help but cut in, \"Our Tangning can handle any clothing you give her, she's not picky.\"At this time, Mo Yurou entered the room accompanied by her assistant. Upon seeing Tangning sitting in front of the mirror, she stormed over to her fiercely. She had a proud expression on her face as she grabbed the lipstick in Tangning's hand and said, \"Must be because you are too used to being a substitute with no choice in clothing, that's why you've forgotten how to be picky.\"After speaking, Mo Yurou sauntered over to the clothing rack. Pointing to a few pieces of clothing, she faced the designer and said, \"I want to try all these.\"Mo Yurou was indeed good at picking clothes because she understood what complemented her body.Whereas, Tangning indeed did not know how to pick clothes, because..she felt, she should be able to handle any clothing - it was what she was here to present. The fashion shows in the world weren't designed to suit one particular model and it was normal to not have time to check whether clothes suited a model before doing a show...So, whatever one wears, they present...no matter if it suits them or not.Because of this understanding, Tangning had her own unique way of presenting all different kinds of clothing.\"Our Yurou isn't some outdated model. In this profession, wearing clothes is a serious matter, how can you be so casual about it?\" Mo Yurou's assistant added.\"No matter what a mistress wears, isn't it just 'The Emperor's New Clothes*'? In the eyes of men, no matter what you wear, you are naked...what's the point of picking something nice to wear?\"\"You...\"\"Yurou, don't be angry, it's not beneficial to your body\" her assistant comforted. \"The interview is about to start, let's go out and get ready...\"Tangning turned to face Lin Wei and Long Jie as she whispered, \"We should go too.\"The interview was scheduled for 9am, the current time was 8:40am. As it was going to be streamed live online, Han Yufan pulled the two aside to remind them, \"In this kind of situation, you better think before you speak. I'm sure you both know what you should and shouldn't say. Especially you Tangning, control yourself, this is going to be streamed live. If you start up any negative discussions, we won't be able to handle the implications and I don't see how that could be beneficial to you.\"\"Regarding the topic of sharing a stage, you both better prepare an answer and place the focus on the magazine's front cover.\"\"No worries Yufan. I'm just not sure if someone has bad motives,\" Mo Yurou said as she hooked her arm around Han Yufan's.\"I will do my best,\" Tangning responded calmly. But, after the recent incidents, Han Yufan was a little scared to see Tangning's calmness...the more she hid her emotions, the more schemes she had hidden up her sleeve. He really wanted to know, at this moment, what Tangning was actually thinking.\"Yufan, let's go in...\" Mo Yurou shook his arm, she couldn't stand watching Han Yufan stare at Tangning.Han Yufan gave a look of warning to Tangning. If Tangning behaved today, in the future...when Mo Yurou made a comeback, he would consider giving her a chance.The three of them entered the interview room, but only Tangning and Mo Yurou sat on the seats inside. Han Yufan stood quietly amongst the reporters. If Tangning made any flaws, from where he was standing, he could quickly jump in and control the situation...But today, Tangning wasn't going to play her cards the way they expected.Translators Notes:*The Emperor's New Clothes (\u7687\u5e1d\u7684\u65b0\u88c5) - A short story by Hans Christian Andersen about an emperor that was tricked by weavers into believing his new clothes were invisible to those that were unfit for their positions, stupid or incompetent. In reality, he was actually naked and everyone was just too afraid to tell him. In the novel, Mo Yurou is pretty much being teased as appearing naked no matter what she wears.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Welcoming Tangning and Mo Yurou!\" the reporter used fluent English to greet the two. At this moment, Mo Yurou had to take a moment to listen to the translator in her ear before giving a response. However, she could only respond in Chinese. On the other hand, Tangning's English was as equally fluent as the reporter's, so she easily conversed with her. In an instant, the reporter felt a closer bond with Tangning.\"I'm aware the two of you have gained a lot of popularity due to your upcoming 'battle'. I want to know, regarding this collaboration, what are your thoughts?\"After hearing the reporter's tricky question, Han Yufan was worried Tangning would say something negative, but, Tangning maintained her smile as she replied, \"I respect every job I do...that is my attitude towards things.\"\"Me too,\" Mo Yurou followed Tangning, easily escaping the need to answer.\"OK, what are your opinions towards each other?\"Another extremely tricky question. Han Yufan could feel himself breaking out in a cold sweat, because at this time, if Tangning was to step on Mo Yurou like she did at the stage event recently, he would have no way to stop her. But, who would have expected, after thinking for a moment, Tangning finally replied with one word:\"Confident.\"To most people, this would sound like a compliment, but in reality, Tangning was actually mocking her. As Mo Yurou always thought greatly of herself, she thought Tangning was seriously praising her. Her expression became more proud as she looked down at Tangning. In this type of situation, does Tangning have the choice not to behave and accommodate?Han Yufan let out a sigh of relief. The reporter looked at Mo Yurou. She originally thought she would answer in the most appropriate way, however, her response shocked everyone, \"The Tangning in my eyes, isn't very humble...\"Isn't very humble!Han Yufan's heart dropped, he had to hold himself back from running on to the stage. Did Mo Yurou bring her brains today? Or had she been praised so much lately that she thought she could do whatever she wanted? They had compared her to others because they knew she wouldn't have the chance to work with them, hence no chance to make a comparison in real life, but Tangning was different; they were about to partake in a photo shoot together - everyone would be able to see the results instantly. How could she not hold back a little and leave herself a chance to retreat in case something went wrong?Everyone was surprised by Mo Yurou's response.Not only had they never seen such an arrogant model, they also felt she had an almost non-existent EQ.In comparison, Tangning's confident response was well thought out and meaningful.The reporter froze for a moment, not sure how to recover the conversation. At this moment, Tangning smoothly continued talking and saved the awkward moment, \"Miss Mo even appeared in the same news article as Senior Huo, I am definitely not that capable - there's still a lot for me to learn.\"The Senior Huo that Tangning spoke of was the infamous supermodel Huo Jing Jing who had previously appeared on the Victoria's Secret runway - the reporters were all familiar with her. At the same time, the reporters could tell Tangning was only being polite, because...if Mo Yurou was really that great she wouldn't be appearing in a simple 3rd-class publication.Mo Yurou continued to smile confidently. After she was praised by Tangning her expression was smug.\"From what you're saying, Miss Mo must be very impressive.\" The reporter looked at Tangning thankfully as she followed her lead and praised Mo Yurou.It was a short 20-minute interview, but Han Yufan's heart almost jumped out of his chest while standing on the sidelines.He was originally worried about Tangning, but today, Mo Yurou had completely disappointed him.\"Yurou, why did you step on Tangning during the interview?\" After the interview ended, Han Yufan questioned Mo Yurou angrily.\"Yufan, why are you sticking up for Tangning? This was our opportunity to pull her off her high horse, of course I wasn't going to let it go to waste. I've already received so much abuse from her, I had to get revenge.\"Not too far away, Tangning was watching the argument between the two with a smirk on her face. Upon seeing her expression, Han Yufan felt uneasy.\"Don't tell me, deep down you actually think I'm not comparable to Tangning or Huo Jing Jing.\"Han Yufan had no choice but to comfort Mo Yurou as he placed his hand to his forehead. Mo Yurou was smart sometimes, but at times like this, she was extremely stupid - especially after getting praised by people. That's why Tangning had stated Mo Yurou was confident.\"OK, it's time to prepare for the photo shoot. This battle, you must win, there's no room for losing, or else...you will have no chance at the Top Ten Model Awards,\" Han Yufan reminded Mo Yurou.\"Don't worry...\" Mo Yurou was filled with a determination to win.Meanwhile, on the other side of the room, Tangning received a phone call from Mo Ting, \"The interview just now, I was watching it...I asked Lu Che to pass a copy on to Huo Jing Jing. Huo Jing Jing didn't care too much after seeing it, since she's used to being compared all the time. So we directly passed it on to the legal team...\"That's right, Huo Jing Jing was currently signed with Hai Rui.The husband and wife were completely in sync. Why couldn't the B-grade model be more humble? Since she didn't know how to stop and was determined to hold herself so high, then there was no choice but to put her in an unexpected difficult position.\"Did you really...\"\"Since she had the courage to bully my wife, she will definitely have to face the consequences...Tangning, apart from being nice towards you, I am not easy to deal with.\"A man who could control the life and death of the entertainment industry was definitely not an average character - Tangning knew this a long time ago.\"You only saw her bullying me,\" Tangning was speechless, she had already pushed Mo Yurou to the brink of no return, why didn't this man say anything about that?\"Later, when your photo shoot is over, I will come pick you up,\" Mo Ting laughed gently; to him, everything his wife did was right and deserved support!Tangning also laughed as she nodded her head...she couldn't refuse Mo Ting's thoughtfulness.Afterwards, accompanied by Lin Wei and Long Jie, Tangning entered the waiting room to get changed. As the front cover featured two people, Tangning and Mo Yurou's clothes and makeup were very similar - this magazine shoot was destined to be a challenge of skills.Deep down, they both thought about making the other into their backdrop, but how they were going to play their cards......depended on their abilities.As usual, before any shoot, Tangning was graceful and quiet - she didn't say much at all. This made Mo Yurou appear extra confident. She felt Tangning was this way because she knew she wasn't good enough. Meanwhile, she thought of herself as having complete control over the set...As the theme was 'Oriental Trend', the two models both wore traditional two-piece costumes. On top they wore a beautiful high collared shirt, buttoned at the neck with a detailed pattern on the sleeves. From the waist up to the collarbone, there were delicately embroidered orchids blooming magnificently. On the bottom, they wore an elegant long skirt. Like the shirt, the skirt also had a stunning display of embroidery. After putting on the clothes, Tangning's expression was blank like a white piece of paper; she was still in her containment stage.Meanwhile, at this time, Mo Yurou was already flaunting the feminine vibe of a woman from the ancient times...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because of her charming and energetic personality, Mo Yurou demanded everyone's attention. Whereas, in comparison, when not working, Tangning was quiet and peaceful; she didn't like talking. This kind of introverted personality, especially when compared to Mo Yurou, made it easy for people to overlook her presence and beauty.\"Miss Mo, since you are ready, please make your way into the studio to get your solo shoot taken first.\"As well as the front cover shoot, there were also solo photos inside the magazine, so Mo Yurou entered the studio ahead of Tangning. As she got up from her seat in front of the mirror, a provoking look went across her face accompanied by a confident aura - it was like she was sure she would win. This confidence definitely could not be found on Tangning. As a result, based on a favorable impression, all the staff had faith in Mo Yurou more.Inside the studio. The set was ready. Under the traditional wooden window stood an old table. Atop the table, sat a delicate blue and white porcelain vase and appearing out of the vase was a beautiful pink rose that had recently bloomed. Beside the table sat a Taishi chair; Mo Yurou's task was to sit on this chair and take a photo.Upon seeing Mo Yurou enter the studio, the photographer was captivated by her look. All this Oriental beauty had to do was sit on the chair and she would be as beautiful as a painting. If she could utilize her skills to take it a step further, the Oriental Trend would definitely be ignited in the Western market.\"It's rumored this model is comparable to Huo Jing Jing,\" the photographer's assistant praised, \"She must be very professional.\"\"I have high hopes.\" The tall handsome photographer reminded everyone to get in position before telling Mo Yurou, in a friendly manner, that the shoot would be about to start.As Mo Yurou was very ambitious, she understood, apart from putting in extra effort for the shoot with Tangning, she also could not treat this solo shoot casually.\"Let's take a few shots from the side,\" the photographer instructed Mo Yurou. With the help of the translator, Mo Yurou understood the photographer's expectations, so she immediately turned her body to one side. She then used her right arm to lean on the back of the chair and placed her left hand on her dress - revealing the left side of her refined face as she smiled seductively.The photographer furrowed his brows - he was expecting an Oriental beauty, not an Oriental temptress...The photographer captured a photo regardless. He thought maybe she hadn't gotten into the momentum yet, so he directed her to express the intellectual beauty of an Oriental woman by holding a traditional red basket. This time, Mo Yurou sat up straight; the angle was right, but...she had her head down...all the photographer could see was her wide forehead.The photographer again took a few shots, his expression was unimpressed. How could this model be compared to Huo Jing Jing?Worst of all, throughout the entire shoot, although Mo Yurou's personality stood out, she could only pull off one smile and one facial expression...The photographer was silent, he just wanted to complete the job at hand. When the shoot was finally over, Mo Yurou was shameless enough to approach him and ask how she went.The photographer didn't respond while his assistant turned to Mo Yurou, gave her a thumbs up and said, \"Very good...\"Mo Yurou gave a proud smile. Underneath her refined appearance was a model with no self-awareness - it suddenly felt so easy to hate her.\"Pfft!\" The photographer let out a sound of digust behind her back before turning to his assistant and asked, \"Is there still one more?\" At this moment, Tangning gently entered the studio. She started off by greeting the photographer politely.Her smile didn't seem forced nor unfriendly, but because of Mo Yurou's shoot, the photographer was currently in a bad mood, so he could only respond to Tangning in an expressionless manner.Deep down he thought, even though the model that just left wasn't skilled, at least she had a bright personality. Whereas the model in front of him, was quiet and dull - he was expecting her to be even worse.Because of his expectations, his attitude towards Tangning was very casual. He casually prepared and casually started the shoot without giving Tangning any directions. All he mentioned to her were the underlying themes of each photo.\"I really don't know how these women can be called models,\" the assistant next to the photographer also did not have high expectations for Tangning.Theme 1: The gentleness of an Oriental woman.The photographer wasn't worried at all about this theme because Tangning just had to be herself and the task would be completed. However, she did something he did not expect. Indeed, she did not need to do anything fancy, she just had to maintain her usual composure and simply sit on the chair, but...she added in one important factor......her eyes...Unlike the calm, emotionless expression she originally had, Tangning's gaze was now focused in front of her; alert and clear. Her eyes were slightly watery with a tinge of red - like she was looking at something she loved, but had to resist...This was exactly the shy, reserved personality of an Oriental woman!Most importantly, Tangning didn't only bring attention to her eyes, she also led onlookers with her emotions to focus on the clothes on her body...she looked like a woman that had dressed up for the person she loved, only to find...the person she loved was with another person. Therefore, she felt her appearance was disgraceful and a joke...Emotion and setting blended together; her gaze and the product became one...Wow...The photographer couldn't contain his excitement. Throughout the entire shoot, he endlessly shouted, \"Perfect!\"He had never seen such a skilled model. His heart was so excited it was about to burst...In a mere 5 minutes, Tangning managed to portray a story, and most importantly, this story was related to the clothes she was wearing!This was how a professional model should be. No matter how beautiful she was, she was meant to be an accessory for the product she was presenting. Most models had the capability to show off their clothes, but how many could become one with it?This time, the photographer was filled with excitement. He finally felt he found a chance to show off his photography skills. Most importantly, Tangning was a model that knew how to pick her own poses. She didn't require much direction, every pose she pulled was exactly what was required and every photo she took would make one not willing to delete it...Thinking about it, the previous model compared to Tangning...was completely overshadowed.The difference between 'just-a-pretty-face' and a 'real model' was like the difference between the sky and earth.Afterwards, the photographer asked Tangning to pull off a few more looks. What made him even more surprised was the fact that no matter what he requested from Tangning, she would be able to respond within a second. Flirtatious, sad, innocent, seductive - she could pull it all off with a simple gaze and her detailed approach.

She also needed to put on a new set of clothes. However, upon returning to the waiting room, Mo Yurou's assistant was standing guard at the door with a provoking look towards her.\"President Han is inside, you will have to wait for a bit.\"Tanging glanced at Mo Yurou's assistant calmly before gently pushing him aside and opening the door.Inside the room, Mo Yurou was sitting on Han Yufan's lap - the two were immersed in a passionate moment. The scene in front of her was like the night she discovered the two of them cheating on her. This kind of provocation and disregard for other people around them seemed like they thought they had already won.Upon seeing the two, Tangning wasn't angry or hurt like the first time she had discovered them this way. Instead, her eyes looked at them in mockery and ridicule.Mo Yurou did not expect Tangning to walk in so sudden. Seeing Tangning act naturally, she couldn't continue what she was doing.Realizing the situation, Han Yufan also pushed Mo Yurou off his lap, \"Let's continue back at the hotel tonight.\"\"I love you, Yufan,\" Mo Yurou took the opportunity to confess her love proudly. After all, she had stolen the best thing Tangning owned, Han Yufan...or so she thought.\"I also love you, babe.\" After reassuring the woman in his arms, Han Yufan stood up and warned Tangning, \"You will both be doing your photo shoot together in a moment, make sure to coordinate well with Yurou. You too, Yurou, don't cause trouble for each other. We can't afford to make an even bigger joke of ourselves, understood?\"\"Yufan, don't you understand Tangning by now? Isn't her purpose of being here to cause us trouble? Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her.\"Tangning was quiet the entire time. Using her fluent English, she just simply asked the stylist and makeup artist to continue with their work. Han Yufan left the room with an angry expression on his face. Passing by some staff, he took the opportunity to ask them how Mo Yurou's photo shoot went.They all responded with, \"Not bad\", \"She has a promising future\", \"Very good\" and \"She will go viral\". Whereas, when asked about Tangning, they just smiled meaningfully with no opinion.Tangning was so perfect, they couldn't find words to express it. However, in Han Yufan's eyes, he thought Mo Yurou must have left a stronger impression.As the photo shoot was approaching, the stylist sincerely prepared one black and one white piece of clothing for them. The plan was to make them appear like a pair of sisters. Originally, Mo Yurou's provocative character was more suited to black, whereas Tangning's gentleness was more suited to white. But because white was more eye-catching, Mo Yurou ran over first and snatched the white one for herself.\"This...\" The fashion designer was put in a difficult position.\"Give it to her\" Tangning said without even blinking an eye. \"As long as Miss Mo is sure she won't regret!\"However, Long Jie was not willing to accept this situation. Standing behind Tangning, she threw a verbal grenade at Mo Yurou, \"Are you addicted to snatching things from others?\"\"Tangning already agreed, what right do you think you have to disapprove, you're merely an assistant,\" Mo Yurou picked up the white clothing proudly.Long Jie slightly stomped her feet, however, Tangning turned to her and said, \"That piece of clothing indeed suits her better.\"Hearing this, Long Jie immediately understood - there was no way Tangning would simply give her clothing to someone else. So she calmed down.Like this, the two models ended up swapping their clothes; there really wasn't much difference, they were both cheongsams (a.k.a qipao). After putting on the white cheongsam, Mo Yurou looked bright and lively - it was a refreshing sight to see. The detailed embroidery on the cheongsam especially made her appear like a goddess; it matched her well.Mo Yurou wasn't stupid, she knew light colors were more eye-catching, that's why white was her first choice - who would wear such a lifeless color like black? But, thinking about it, Tangning's dull personality was perfect for it; Mo Yurou couldn't help but laugh at the thought.\"Black suits you well.\"Judging by the situation at hand, if Tangning was to wear black, wouldn't she become her backdrop? Mo Yurou was daydreaming.Tangning smiled as she returned the compliment, \"White also suits you.\"\"The shoot is starting, could the two models please get ready,\" the photographer's assistant called from outside.Mo Yurou took a quick glance at Tangning, her heart was racing - this was the first time she was to a stage with Tangning. Her opportunity had finally come to show off her skills; she was going to make everyone realize Tangning was an outdated model who was not comparable to her in a million ways.Following closely, the two models entered the studio one after another. This time, the backdrop was a modern street scene that gave off a melancholy aura.The photographer watched as Tangning and Mo Yurou stepped on set. A sudden thought came to his mind: not only did Tangning have a strong modeling foundation, it was possible she even understood photography. He could see from the way Tangning chose her angles and worked the lighting that she also understood the use of complementing colors.Why did the photographer suddenly think this? Because the backdrop behind them was old and melancholy, whereas the sky was white. If you imagine placing something white on a blank piece of paper, it would only disappear into the background. On the other hand, what would happen if you placed something black?No matter how small it was, it would still catch the attention of whoever's looking at it.To confirm his thoughts, the photographer turned to his assistant and asked, \"Did Tangning see us change the background?\"\"I think she only saw us carrying the backdrop in...\" the assistant replied.Indeed...She was professional and understood how to take advantage of the situation. If a model like her didn't become famous, there was something wrong with this world.The photographer was impressed with Tangning even more.On the other hand, all Mo Yurou knew how to do was go with the flow. She only knew to stand in front of Tangning because standing in front of Tangning would make her stand out more...Tangning let her have her way and did everything to satisfy her...and support her.\"Come, get ready...we need to get started. The first set of shots will have Miss Mo standing in the foreground holding onto Miss Tang's hand. Miss Tang will be following behind. I want you to both look excited, like it is the first time you are out on the streets.\"Hearing she was to stand in the foreground, Mo Yurou smirked to herself. Indeed...picking white was the right choice. There was no doubt she would get famous from this magazine shoot, so her prideful expression increased. She simply turned around, grabbed Tangning's hand unwillingly and pulled a pose like she was anxious to move forward...However, what pose did Tangning do? She simply placed her focus on a small street vendor pictured in the backdrop. The street vendor was selling lots of beautiful fabric and she appeared to be fascinated by it. By looking at her, you could feel how badly she wanted to stay and not be pulled forward. At the same time, she showed off the smooth curves of one side of her body while drawing Mo Yurou into the scene...But because her expression was so vivid...all the attention was on her...Hence......Mo Yurou......simply became part of the backdrop...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From her position in front of Tangning, there was no way she could see Tangning's expression, plus, she was overly confident (she thought she was comparable to Huo Jing Jing) so...upon hearing the photographer and his staff clapping and cheering, she actually thought it was for her. After all, Tangning was behind her and she was blocking her...\"OK, let's shoot the next set!\"Because of their clothes, Tangning mostly ended up standing behind Mo Yurou. Even when they stood side by side, Mo Yurou always led.This made Mo Yurou quite proud...After the final set of photos were done, the photographers once again couldn't help but applaud Tangning's amazing performance. Mo Yurou acted like a supermodel as she stood in front of Tangning accepting all the cheers for herself. Eventually, Mo Yurou left the studio first, giving the photographer a chance to approach Tangning, \"That model is so annoying, however...I won't point it out. Once the magazines front cover is released and everyone sees the comparison between you two, she will experience a big slap to her face. There will be plenty of people helping you to teach her a lesson.\"The photographer was indeed a senior in the industry, stuff like this was not unusual to him.\"Thank you,\" Tangning smiled.\"No need. You were really the most skilled model I have ever worked with. I can't deny, you are on the same level as Western models.\" The photographer raised his thumb at her, \"The weekly publication will be released next Wednesday. Look forward to it...you will definitely ignite the Oriental Trend.\"\"That's not something I can decide, all I did was give my best,\" Tangning felt that the industry was not short of hardworking people; there were so many artists with talent and skills, but many only got halfway to fame - apart from hard work, luck was an important factor.When she returned to the waiting room, Mo Yurou jumped right into Han Yufan's embrace as she recounted how she had received an applaud. After listening to her, Han Yufan wrapped his arm around her waist - he knew she would succeed. However, he had no idea, the applauds had nothing to do with Mo Yurou.At this time, Tangning also entered the room. Upon seeing her, the staff that was tidying the studio raised his thumb at her, \"You are really the best model I've ever seen.\"Mo Yurou didn't understand what he was saying - after all her English was limited - but...Han Yufan understood he was praising Tangning.Most importantly, the staff knew Mo Yurou didn't understand English. So assuming Han Yufan also did not understand, he looked at Mo Yurou in extreme disgust and said, \"I really can't believe that woman is your colleague. She can't possibly be called a model, she has no professional skills at all and views herself too highly. It's bad enough that she doesn't understand English, she even thought we were all praising her. There's something wrong with her.\"After speaking, the staff left. Tangning turned to look at Han Yufan's expression as the corners of her lips slightly curved up.\"Yurou, are you sure the photographer praised you?\"\"Yufan, don't you believe me?\" Mo Yurou nodded her head in certainty, \"What I said was all real. If you don't believe then go ask the photographer. Yufan, have trust in me, this time, I am definitely going to revive Secret...\"Han Yufan stared at Tangning's back; his mind couldn't stop thinking about what he just heard the staff say. His heart felt uneasy, but the front cover had already been shot. Even if Mo Yurou didn't stand out, at least she still appeared in an international magazine - this would still be beneficial towards the Top Ten Model Awards.Originally, the discussion about the shoot had already ended, but Long Jie entered the room ecstatically and said excitedly to Tangning, \"Tangning, do you know what I just heard? The photographer said in the solo shoot, Mo Yurou looked like a...temptress.\"Upon hearing her, Mo Yurou wiggled out of Han Yufan's embrace and walked over to Long Jie. She raised her hand with the intention to hit her, luckily, Tangning's reaction was quick as she pulled Long Jie out of the way and grabbed onto Mo Yurou's wrist, \"What do you think you're doing?\"\"If you have the guts, tell her to repeat what she just said,\" Mo Yurou said threateningly as she shook her hand loose from Tangning's grip and pointed at Long Jie with a sneer, \"Tangning, don't be a sore loser. I know you aren't satisfied with having to stand in the background today, but you were wearing black, so there was no choice.\"\"Wasn't it because you snatched the clothes?\" Long Jie once again swapped positions with Tangning, stepping in front to protect her. \"Mo Yurou, I'm not going to waste my time with you anymore. Whether the photography team was impressed or disappointed by you, you will find out next Wednesday.\"\"Fine, when that day comes, you will see whose side the public are on!\" After speaking, Mo Yurou threw her hands across the makeup table and swiped everything onto the ground. Glass shattered across the floor. A few small pieces flew past Tangning and left small cuts on her legs.Upon seeing this, Long Jie erupted, \"Mo Yurou, what are you doing? You've injured Tangning's legs, do you know how much they are worth? You better apologize!\"\"Apologize?\" Mo Yurou looked at Long Jie like she had said something ridiculous, \"You're dreaming.\"\"You...\"\"Long Jie...\" Tangning held her back, \"Give a phone call to my insurance company and ask them to come collect the evidence. There's no need to apologize, I am covered by insurance, however...the insurance company won't let this matter off so easily. I'm sure they will sue the person that injured me.\"Upon hearing Tangning's words, Han Yufan's face turned pale, \"What do you mean by that?\"\"What I mean is...my legs are covered by an extremely expensive insurance policy. If Mo Yurou does not apologize, then I'll just have to let the insurance company handle it...\"\"Tangning, I never thought you could be this malicious,\" Han Yufan said to Tangning, \"It was only an accident...\"Hearing him call it an accident, Tangning turned around, grabbed the bottle of makeup remover on the table and smashed it in front of Mo Yurou. Similarly...Mo Yurou's legs now had small cuts on it, \"This was also an accident, my hands were slippery...\"\"You...\"Seeing Han Yufan's enraged expression, Tangning remained calm as usual, \"Are you going to be upset about my unintended mistake? If that's the case, aren't you more malicious than I am?\"\"Tangning, let's make a bet. The magazine will be released next Wednesday. If my level of support is higher than yours, then you better retreat from the modeling industry and never take a step back in again.\"Mo Yurou impulsively declared a war on Tangning as Tangning responded with a slight smile, \"Who do you think you are? You want me to retreat from the modeling industry because of you? You really think highly of yourself...\"After speaking, Tangning left the room with Long Jie. As they were leaving, they heard Mo Yurou give out a frustrated scream.\"Tangning, I'm so sorry, today I didn't know how to judge the situation,\" Long Jie apologized to Tangning.\"It's ok, even if it wasn't because of you...Mo Yurou still would have found a way to cause trouble for me,\" Tangning responded in an indifferent manner, \"Let's just leave everything for Wednesday...\"Let's wait and see how Mo Yurou will return in low spirits...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their eyes met but they didn't say anything. As they passed by each other, Han Ruoxue said to Tangning, \"The day Secret magazine is released is the day you will leave the modeling industry.\"\"Looks like you have a lot of faith in Mo Yurou.\"\"Even though she hasn't had as much exposure as you, she already has experience internationally and has gained extra points from the judges of the Top Ten Model Awards. In comparison, you've lost all value,\" Han Ruoxue said ruthlessly.\"Really? Then let's wait for the results...\" Tangning wasn't taken aback at all as she responded calmly; her words were strong - nothing dark in the entertainment industry was going to crush her.Han Ruoxue glared at Tangning full of hatred - her desire to destroy Tangning was getting stronger. An artist that could not be controlled, whether tied up or free, always posed a hidden danger. Only when she stepped all over them and ensured they couldn't get back up, would she be completely at ease. Especially since Tangning had such a strong hatred towards her and her brother!\"Tangning, there's something strange about Han Ruoxue's expression.\" Long Jie turned around to glance at Han Ruoxue, she felt a bit a worried.\"Right now, she wants so badly to crush me!\" Tangning understood; she knew how much the Han siblings hated her, \"If I really fail with the magazine this time, I can imagine what a bleak future I will have.\"\"It won't happen...Lin Wei and I both have faith in you. Plus, even if you do fail, it doesn't matter, you still have Big Boss!\"Speaking of Mo Ting, Tangning remembered Mo Ting had said he would come pick her up. So after getting not far from Secret, she picked up her phone to call him. On the other side of the line, Mo Ting laughed as he told her to turn around. Around the corner, a Lincoln Limousine was standing under a tree.A tall man leaned against the car, his fit body was accentuated by the black and white striped retro suit he was wearing. He didn't have a smile on his face, but the contours of his face were soft. The mole on his right ear was dazzling - Tangning looked at him dumbfounded. This emperor-like man should be surrounded by an army of people. But for her, he was willing to stand all alone in this quiet corner.Tangning's eyes began to swell up; the incident from earlier had already disappeared into the back of her mind. She was a model, but she was also this man's wife.From the day they were married, this man had been accepting of her faults and had been fulfilling all her wishes. Was she going to continue making the sun wait because she was still focused on a fallen star?It wasn't worth it!\"What's wrong?\" Mo Ting asked gently; he noticed Tangning looked a little depressed.Tangning shook her head without saying a word.The words \"I like you\" hung to the back of her throat.\"Is it because you are too tired from the magazine shoot?\" Mo Ting looked her up and down. He noticed the cuts on her legs as his pupils dilated in anger, \"What happened?\"Long Jie was about to explain when Tangning cut in, \"Mo Ting, let's go home, I have something to tell you.\"Mo Ting glanced at Long Jie, it was obvious what had happened. This debt, he was going to make them pay back - but not just yet.Afterwards, they all boarded the Limousine. However, the entire journey Tangning was nervous and quiet.Mo Ting did not question her. When they finally reached the manor, he carried her in his arms straight to the bedroom. Now, it was just the two of them. Mo Ting placed Tangning on the bed and instructed the maids to bring the medicine box in.Tangning watched as Mo Ting knelt on the ground and helped her apply medicine; she could no longer contain the rush of emotions in her heart as she instinctively clung onto his neck. In a nervous but stable voice, she said, \"I see everything clearly and I understand everything now. Mo Ting, I like you and I want you.\"\"I thought I wouldn't be able to like someone in such a short period of time. I even denied this feeling I had in my heart. But now, when I face Han Yufan and Mo Yurou, although I am still angry, my heart no longer hurts.\"After saying this, Tangning slowly loosened her arms and looked into Mo Ting's dazzling gem-like eyes as she enunciated each word clearly, \"I know everything I have now is because of you. So, I like you and I want you. I want the entire you.\"\"Can you give it all to me?\"No woman could make these words sound so touching and natural. As they had previously promised to be truthful to each other...Tangning did not hide her feelings and said everything straightforwardly.I want you.After hearing her confession, Mo Ting looked up and grabbed onto her cheeks as he forcefully pushed her onto the bed. He was going to use his actions to express how overjoyed he was feeling inside.\"I'll give myself to you, only you.\"Tangning was startled for a moment before she wrapped her arms around Mo Ting's waist tightly and passionately responded to his kiss. She closed her eyes and savored the feeling of his tongue dancing with hers...Tangning didn't notice when it happened, but she suddenly noticed her skirt had been lifted up and the back of her waist was wrapped in a warm embrace. The fiery passion in her heart was slowly ignited...She didn't want to care or worry about anything. At this moment, she just wanted to truly become his wife and become one with him.As it was still daytime, the sunlight was strong. The rays of light beaming into the room allowed Tangning to see Mo Ting's body, it was emanating with a healthy glow. Her face flushed red, but she wasn't left with much time to react because Mo Ting's kiss was slowly following the lines of her collarbone down her body, pass her curves, eventually reaching her lower abdomen...Tangning was nervous. Even though they had already been this intimate on their wedding night, the thought of that instant of pain made her scrunch up her eyebrows. She had no experience. Even though she now knew how to kiss well, thanks to Mo Ting, the real thing was about to happen - all she could do was immerse herself in his kiss...Amongst their passion, Tangning unconsciously bit Mo Ting's shoulder as the two perfect bodies intertwined together not leaving a single gap.A thin layer of sweat gradually covered Tangning's delicate body. The pain she expected didn't happen. Tangning looked at Mo Ting disappointedly, her eyes were dewy...Mo Ting resisted the urge to possess her as he lingered around her collarbone, \"Over the next few days, do you still have work?\"\"I need to ask Lin Wei...\" Tangning replied gently.\"Tell her not to arrange anything...\" Mo Ting moved away from her collarbone and looked straight into her eyes, \"Because...I might make it impossible for you to get out of bed over the next 3 days...\"\"What about your job?\"\"My most important job right now...is you.\" Mo Ting once again locked lips with Tangning. In between his kisses, he looked at her with a narrow smile and asked, \"Do you want me to enter now?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She leaned in and whispered, \"I want you...\"Mo Ting's eyes turned red as he got up for a moment to grab a condom from the drawers. He thoughtfully shielded himself to protect Tangning - he knew her career was currently on the rise and couldn't afford to have a child. Why was there such an item in their bedroom, though? Tangning wondered.Mo Ting returned to Tangning's body and stared into her eyes. Noticing a coldness in her gaze, he realized she may have had a misunderstanding as he explained, \"We are husband and wife, I am always prepared. It's not something left over from someone else. I've been waiting for you all along.\"\"I haven't...done it with anyone else. I've only gone as far as the halfway experience we had on our wedding night...\"Upon hearing this, Tangning's eyes twinkled as she kissed Mo Ting between the hollows of his throat, \"Sorry...\"\"It will still hurt a bit,\" Mo Ting tried his best to hold back as he gently reminded her.Too afraid to look down at the place that made her shy, Tangning simply nodded her head in certainty, \"It's alright...I've experienced the pain once before.\"Mo Ting wrapped his arms around her shoulder, making sure to pay attention to her feelings. While kissing her cheek, he slowly made her his. He patiently moved inch by inch, until...he felt himself inside her.In this world, nothing was more beautiful than sharing an intimate moment like this, where two souls became one. Mo Ting looked at Tangning and watched as the pain dissipated, before he slowly started moving. He wanted to give her the best first time - he wanted her to remember this for the rest of her life...After this, they would truly belong to each other...Outside the window, the moon was quietly hanging above the treetops. While, inside, an activity that made one's face blush and heart race had just finished.After experiencing the full force of Mo Ting's energy, Tangning was so tired she couldn't open her eyes. Her body felt weak and her mind was half awake. At this moment, she felt someone wiping down her sticky body before helping her change into a tidy set of pajamas. She then felt a gentle kiss on her forehead ushering her to sleep.All this, she did not regret at all, because she knew, it was all worth it. Deep in their sleep, the married couple clasped onto each other's hand tightly. Mo Ting embraced Tangning as he gently kissed her on the forehead.\"Hello, Mrs. Mo.\"The next morning, Tangning awoke in Mo Ting's arms. Looking at the man that now belonged to her, a satisfied smile appeared across her face. From now on, no matter how dirty and filthy the entertainment industry was, she had someone to rely on - her heart was filled with faith.Unfortunately, this happy moment didn't last for 3 days like Mo Ting had hoped. Because early in the morning Lin Wei started knocking on the door. Mina from Secret had invited everyone from Tianyi to lunch and of course, Tangning had to attend.Secret's magazine was currently in full swing and Tangning's dedication to her job wouldn't allow her to be called arrogant the day before the magazine's release.She just never thought, Han Yufan and Mo Yurou had planned another attack on her at this event.In front of everyone at lunch, Han Yufan and Mo Yurou announced, they were getting engaged!Han Yufan was tall and handsome, while Mo Yurou was delicate and lovely. Their hands were held tightly together as they stood side-by-side, looking like the perfect match.Apart from people from Tianyi, there were also a few higher-ups from Secret in the room. They weren't aware of the relationship between Tangning and the two, so they stood up and clapped their hands to congratulate the couple. Only Tangning, Lin Wei and Long Jie stayed still.\"Tangning, aren't you going to congratulate them?\" Han Ruoxue held up her glass as she forced Tangning. She wanted to revel in the sight of Tangning being heartbroken. No matter how unaffected she looked on the outside, inside she must be in torment, in pain, dripping in blood...\"Oh yeh, that's right, with your temper, there's no way you can congratulate others. Even if you were once Han Yufan's fiancee, that is now in the past. Since you are in this industry, you should be prepared to have things snatched from you at all times. You should be more open-minded...\"\"When will they be officially engaged?\" Tangning asked calmly.\"After the huge sales of Secret Magazine...\" Han Ruoxue said confidently. With the aid of Han Ruoxue's PR, Mo Yurou still had articles written about her back in China. On top of that, the discussions amongst fans had made Secret famous even before it's release.Although the news about Mo Yurou being a mistress couldn't be cleared, because of her popularity, a few companies had already contacted Tianyi for collaboration. She had high hopes for the Top Ten Model Awards...So, Han Ruoxue was confident, Secret would have a huge number of sales.\"Then I have to say congratulations in advance,\" Tangning maintained her smile as she also raised her glass at the couple across from her. However, as these words landed on Mo Yurou's ears, they somehow didn't sound sincere.\"Tangning, stop acting. I know you don't actually want to see Han Yufan and I get engaged. You hate me so much.\"\"Don't tell me I'm supposed to like you?\" Tangning laughed questioningly.Mina watched blankly as they argued. From the translator, she found out about their relationship as she looked at them in surprise. No wonder they were against Tangning from the start.She was accustomed to the bias nature of the industry; it was normal to see people take advantage of situations to promote themselves as well as people humiliating others right in front their face. But, wasn't Tianyi aware of Mo Yurou's level?Mina looked deep and meaningfully at Tangning before retreating from Tianyi's internal argument.After lunch, Secret's staff all left, leaving the few of them behind. Mo Yurou took advantage of the situation to point at Tangning and laugh, \"Did you think, by obtaining a semi-independent contract from Tianyi, you would really be able to find a way out? Let me tell you, without Tianyi, you are nothing. Tianyi can support you, at the same time, they can also step all over you.\"\"You've wasted so much energy to create all these schemes. In the end, you've only been helping me prepare for my wedding. Both Yufan and the title of international supermodel are mine. Whereas, you can only return to your position as an outdated model with no way to make a comeback!\"\"Yes, you're right, you're much more amazing than me. After Secret's magazine is released, your popularity will rise dramatically, whereas I'll be left with nothing,\" Tangning agreed with Mo Yurou.Mo Yurou never expected Tangning to admit defeat. Seeing Tangning give up, she felt a sense of satisfaction she had never experienced before.\"Since you are aware of your status, after we return home, as long as you stay within your boundaries, Yufan will still accept jobs for you. But...if you still have the intention to rise above me, then don't blame us for being ruthless!\"\"That's enough babe, let's sit down and talk.\" Han Yufan was affectionate towards Mo Yurou as he slightly lifted his gaze to Tangning, \"Tangning, you heard what she said?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Mo Yurou spoke up to hold her back.\"Tangning, I know you are not willing to accept being stepped on by me; I will definitely convince you.\"Hearing Mo Yurou speak like she was swearing on an oath, Tangning sneered as she turned around to leave. Before she started striding away, without turning back to look at the trio, she said, \"This trip has been wasted on listening to your commotion...\"\"Since you are feeling so impatient, you can leave first...You have no business being here anymore,\" Han Yufan said as he lifted his brow.\"My pleasure.\"Han Yufan and Mo Yurou assumed Tangning had taken a huge blow and was trying to avoid seeing them getting engaged. They were glad she was leaving. After the release of that week's Secret Magazine, Tanging would no longer pose a threat to them and Han Yufan would have her in the palm of his hands. Mo Yurou felt she no longer needed to care about Tangning as she had so many other competitors. There was no point wasting all her energy on one outdated model.Han Yufan and the others watched as Tangning left. At this time, Han Ruoxue calmly suggested, \"We can't let her leave unnoticed. Yufan, release an article: [Tangning returns home after failing miserably: flees from her lost American battle].\"\"Jie, don't worry, I know what to do,\" Han Yufan embraced Mo Yurou as he nodded.The entire situation was ridiculous. In order to give up on an artist, a management agency actually trampled them to this extent.Behind her back, they were plotting away. Meanwhile, Tangning held her head high; she was not afraid at all.Outside the hotel, Mina's assistant was waiting to escort Tangning. After arriving at Secret's headquarters, Mina pulled out a document and started explaining, \"The photographer and I have passed on the highlights from your shoot to a few famous brands. After seeing your photos, they have expressed their interest towards you. Amongst them was a famous French makeup brand. They want to make you their spokesperson for the Asia region. The premise is, they want you and their product to make a debut in Secret Magazine and open them up to the Asian market...\"\"Tangning, we have all witnessed how your management agency treats you, but we don't want to let you go to waste. We will not spread news about this for now, but after the Oriental Trend issue is released, we will make a public announcement.\"Tangning looked at the information in her hands. Noticing it was the French brand, ISN, her eyes slowly lit up. It was a French domestic brand that was founded over 100 years ago. And...it had never opened up to the Asian market.This was such a pleasant surprise!\"Mina, do you have that much faith in me?\"\"You and I know it in our hearts. Tangning, do you know what impresses me most about you?\" Mina smiled slightly, her voice contained traces of admiration, \"Your casual and calm nature and the fact that you're not arrogant or impatient. You were born to be a model and will someday become a supermodel. I believe in my judgment.\"Hearing their conversation, Long Jie immediately started clapping. She was so happy she wanted to scream. Mo Yurou would have never imagined, while she was still thinking of despicable methods to destroy Tangning's reputation and force her to take on cheap endorsements, Tangning had already become the Asian spokesperson for a French brand.Who knows how upset Mo Yurou would be once she finds out?\"The day after tomorrow, I will arrange for you to have a secret meeting with ISN to go over the details of your collaboration. We will discuss further then.\"\"Thank you, Mina.\" Tangning stood up to shake her hand.\"No need to thank me. I'm not just helping you, we are helping each other,\" Mina hugged Tangning warmly. She was lucky she wasn't blinded by Han Ruoxue's lies, or she would have missed out on working with such an outstanding model. She was also lucky, she didn't let a moment of pride destroy this opportunity to revive Secret...Tangning smiled as she placed the documents in her bag secretly.Lin Wei looked at Tangning from behind and let out a smile of admiration. She knew Tangning had been through a lot, but because of her hard work, she was finally getting what she deserved.\"Let's open a Champagne to celebrate once we get home...this time, Han Yufan and the others are going to explode from anger,\" Long Jie revealed a child-like smile.\"Tangning, does this mean we won't be returning to China first?\" Lin Wei asked.\"Han Ruoxue is going to be disappointed; she's probably already prepared a news article to make a fuss about me returning home. On the other hand...would you believe it if I told you Mo Yurou will be happy? This means she can humiliate me in front of my face.\"Tangning could completely see through them. Lin Wei smiled as she agreed; looks like that's how things were gonna be...\"In that case, I will give them a call in a moment to tell them we are not returning yet. We will wait for the arrival of the Oriental Trend together...\"\"Lin Wei, can you find out more information about ISN for me and run some background checks. I want to make sure everything is flawless,\" Tangning instructed carefully.\"Your choices are never wrong.\"Regardless of everything else, Tangning felt working with Lin Wei was getting better each day. As a result, her trust towards her was getting stronger. Whereas Long Jie, although she was capable of a lot of things, Tangning felt she was better off as an assistant because of her attitude.In the car, Tangning was feeling a little uncomfortable, so she naturally changed her position. Upon seeing this, Long Jie raised an eyebrow, \"Is your waist sore?\"\"Uh huh,\" Tangning nodded.\"And are your legs tired?\"After hearing this question, Tangning lifted her head innocently and looked at Long Jie. It turned out Long Jie was teasing her.\"Mrs. Mo, why are you blushing?\"Tangning was thinking about the intimate scene from the previous night: Mo Ting's sexy body, his gentle strength, his deep and charming voice and his magical hands...In the short span of an afternoon, she already missed him...\"Since we have the next 2 days off, go keep your husband company.\"\"Yep,\" Tangning already intended to do that.Meanwhile, after receiving Lin Wei's call, Han Yufan's face was covered in anger. He had already prepared the article and contacted the media, but Tangning had simply decided she didn't want to leave anymore...\"Yufan, this is also good. Let's all wait for the results from the magazine together. I can't wait to see the look on her face when she fails miserably,\" Mo Yurou hugged Han Yufan as she spoke. \"After all, she's already suffering anyway. We will have plenty more opportunity to step on her in the future.\"\"I wanted to get back at her for you!\"\"I know your intentions and that's enough...after all, we are to be engaged,\" Mo Yurou responded shyly.After being comforted, Han Yufan calmed down. Since Tangning wanted to disgrace herself, then she had no one to blame.However, while they were enjoying themselves, Tangning secretly met up with ISN. Both parties were satisfied and the contract was quickly finalized. There was no way Tianyi's higher-ups would disagree to this contract...The ultimate attack...was not too far ahead...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I've bought it already. Originally I was going to buy Royal Magazine, but I was attracted by the front cover of Secret.\"\"Are you guys crazy? Secret hasn't done anything good for years...they don't understand fashion at all...\"\"Quick, quick! Go buy it...Secret really lives up to it's expectations this time. You will regret it if you don't buy it!\"That's right, after all their hard work, Secret finally released their newest issue, named Oriental Trend. Originally, Secret had already lost it's status amongst magazines and their sales weren't something to brag about. However, after the release of the Oriental Trend issue, the melancholy black and white cover actually stood out amongst the other colorful magazines; everyone passing by the newsstands couldn't help but stop for a moment to take a look...In just three days, all the major news agencies contacted Secret, requesting for a reprint. They wanted to increase the circulation of the magazine because it deserved a spot on their stands. Many companies that didn't expect much from Secret were now regretting their decision to not work with them.At the same time, the woman on the super popular front cover climbed up search rankings. On one of the biggest search engines in the US, her name was almost at the top. Meanwhile, some of the most searched phrases included, 'Secret Oriental Trend', 'Secret Oriental woman'...and 'Oriental beauty Tangning'.The huge sales from the Oriental Trend issue, unexpectedly helped Secret make an impressive revival; people in the industry critiqued it and once again acknowledged it. In three days, the sales of the issue broke the records of many big publications. Like that, they became the new favorite amongst the fashion industry, as the fresh winds of the Oriental Trend swept across the casual and free Western countries...Secret had finally succeeded and the model on the front cover definitely deserved praise. Mo Yurou couldn't wait to show her results to the judges of the Top Ten Model Awards. However......that night, Han Ruoxue stared at the search engines for a long time......but, no matter how hard she searched, she couldn't find any mentions of Mo Yurou. No model had ever appeared on a front cover and received no mentions. What conniving scheme did Tangning pull off this time?Han Ruoxue didn't mention this issue to Mo Yurou because, apart from Mo Yurou being busy planning her engagement party with Han Yufan, Han Ruoxue also wanted to investigate it further...Next to her hand lay the magazine featuring Tangning and Mo Yurou. She couldn't deny, Tangning's skills were way beyond her expectations; she had definitely underestimated her......Two days later, Secret held a dinner to celebrate their revival. Mo Yurou and Tangning were both guests of honor. This would be the first time they faced the media together since the interview before the photo shoot.That night, Mo Yurou wore a long black dress that dragged across the floor; her chest was dotted with sparkling diamonds. She attended the dinner accompanied by Han Yufan and Han Ruoxue. Upon arriving at the entrance, they ran into Tangning. Compared to the magazine's front cover, Tangning seemed to have swapped outfits with Mo Yurou. Mo Yurou was wearing black and gave off a calm aura, whereas Tangning was wearing an off-shoulder white dress, looking heavenly.\"Tangning, I need to thank you for using all your strength to help my entry into the Top Ten Model Awards,\" Mo Yurou lead the conversation, \"Did you know how many endorsements I've received in this short amount of time?\"\"So you are still using Huo Jing Jing to create news for yourself about becoming an international supermodel?\" Tangning slightly smiled. This smile made Mo Yurou angry and made Han Ruoxue clench her fists; she wanted so badly to gouge her eyes out.\"Oh my god...is that the Asian model, Tangning?\"\"Yes, it's Tangning, it's really her...\"\"Hurry, let's interview her!\"After speaking, Tangning simply brushed past Mo Yurou; she had no time to deal with her questions. A bunch of foreign reporters rushed towards Tangning, and in order to avoid them, she had to leave Mo Yurou and the others behind; quickly exiting the\u00a0hotel. Unfortunately for Mo Yurou, nobody paid any attention to her.\"We should head in as well...\" Han Yufan wrapped his arm around Mo Yurou. In this American fashion capital, because he was too busy planning his engagement party, Han Yufan had no idea why Mo Yurou wasn't receiving any attention. However, Han Ruoxue, knew everything clearly.\"My god, Tangning is here...\"\"Tangning finally appeared!\"\"Tangning! Tangning!\"The atmosphere in the celebration dinner had become full of excitement as soon as Tangning entered. Whereas, towards Mo Yurou, who was behind Tangning, no one even knew she existed. Seeing this, Mo Yurou sneered inside. They both appeared on the same magazine, how was it possible Tangning was so popular, yet no one even mentioned her name? Tangning is so despicable; she must have paid for these fans to boost herself.Afterwards, Mina looked at Tangning from the stage. She also noticed Mo Yurou. Without being biased, she invited both of them onto the stage. But...\"Thank you, everyone, for coming. The heroes of this issue of Secret are currently in front of us. Let me introduce our front cover models: Tangning and Mo Yurou.\"Hearing Tangning's name, everyone wasn't surprised. Although her name hadn't spread to the ends of the earth, her photos and news had impressed everyone...On the other hand, Mo Yurou......who was she?The reporters below the stage looked at each other confusedly. Although this issue of the magazine was a success and they had looked over it numerous times...they never noticed the front cover had anyone else apart from Tangning.So, when Mina introduced Mo Yurou, everyone was puzzled.\"Who is that?\"\"Oh! I remember now, she must be the one holding onto Tangning's hand as part of the set.\"\"I thought she was part of the backdrop. Look, doesn't she look like a typical American streetwalker?\"\"My god, if I didn't look again I wouldn't have noticed. Now that I look at it carefully, how is she shameless enough to stand beside Tangning...they are worlds apart.\"Hearing the discussions, Mo Yurou's expression changed. Never would she have thought, apart from buying fans, Tangning had instructed them to defame her and humiliate her. So, she turned sideways towards Tangning and complained, \"Tangning, your heart is vicious. Do you think by defaming me, you can cover up how amazing I am? I also had a role in making Secret receive such huge sales, but I would have never thought, you would be so despicable as to defame me at this dinner...\"\"You think too highly of yourself...\" Tangning turned her head and smiled calmly.Mo Yurou stood on the stage awkwardly. She believed everyone below the stage belonged to Tangning. She even pointed at them and asked straightforwardly, \"How much did Tangning pay you to praise her and criticize me so much? Are you dogs?\"Mina looked at Mo Yurou as she listened to the translation from her assistant. Afterwards, she walked over to Mo Yurou angrily and spoke, \"I invited you out of respect and courtesy. Miss Mo, is this your professional attitude? How dare you offend the reporters at such a public event?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But Miss Mo, I've never seen a magazine with two models on the cover, where one model becomes the hottest topic and the other practically receives zero mentions.\"\"Zero...\"\"Do you know what that means? It means, as well as the people present, anyone in the US or even the world that has seen this magazine - did not notice your existence.\"The translator translated for Mo Yurou, word for word...After hearing the translation, Mo Yurou's face turned pale...\"This is impossible! This must be a conspiracy between the two of you. This is all your doing...\" Mo Yurou found it hard to believe; she was definitely on the front cover of the magazine, how could she receive no mentions?This couldn't be true...\"Are you not aware of your own abilities? Before this issue was released, we were already prepared to accept that you would merely serve as a contrast. But who would have thought, instead of being a contrast, you stooped to the level of being part of the backdrop - without even a trace of existence...\" Mina took out a copy of Secret and handed it to Mo Yurou.If not for attending this dinner, Mo Yurou would have still acknowledged her own existence.But after hearing everyone calling her part of the backdrop......her confidence came crashing down.Tangning was so good at adapting to her surroundings that Mo Yurou was made to look like part of the background. Above all, Tangning's eyes were so lively that Mo Yurou's arrogant stare looked lifeless in comparison...This was the reason Mo Yurou had no mentions!Because no one could tell she was alive!Mo Yurou held onto the magazine as she took a few steps back. If not for Han Yufan holding onto her, she would have fallen off the stage.\"I heard in China, there is an article comparing you to Huo Jing Jing...If I were you, I would hide in the US for the rest of my life, because I would be too ashamed to go back.\"Mo Yurou looked like she had been struck by lightning...her mind was blank as she stared at herself on the cover. This couldn't be...everyone had previously praised her on her skills, there was no way she couldn't compare to Tangning. This is impossible, Tangning must have done something...she must have...\"Tangning, I never thought you would sabotage me in this way!\" Mo Yurou accused Tangning angrily.Han Yufan glared at Tangning, \"For the sake of revenge, you would really go to any length.\"\"Revenge?\" Tangning smiled sweetly. \"President Han, tell me, a person like myself, with no background and no top class manager, that even got her clothes snatched from her, what lengths can I go to?\"\"You...\"\"Was I the one that caused her to receive no mentions? It was obviously because she wasn't skilled enough...\"\"Also, was I the one that made her too ashamed to return to China? It was because you guys shamelessly used someone else's fame to boost her...\"\"If you consider this revenge...then the real revenge is yet to come.\" After speaking, Tangning and Mina looked at each other before Mina welcomed the representatives from ISN onto the stage.Two tall and handsome French men walked up the red carpet towards Tanging and Mina. They gave each other a friendly hug before turning to the guests and speaking, \"We are pleased to announce, Tangning will become ISN's spokesperson for the Asia region...\"ISN...A top French brand with a century-old history. Upon deciding to go international, they actually got Tangning to be their spokesperson...for the entire Asia region!In comparison, the deals that Mo Yurou received as a result of using someone else's fame - although not a small amount - not a single one of them had a big budget or ranked highly in Beijing. How could they compare to a top international brand?Mo Yurou's face turned even more pale; her body felt like it was crumbling on its own weight. If word got out about the incident in US, she may not be able to hold onto even these cheap deals...\"When did you accept this deal? Don't you know it has to pass through the company's approval?\" Han Yufan questioned Tangning angrily in front of everyone.Tangning turned around and faced Han Yufan as she spoke, \"The contract has already been seen by the company's higher-ups, I forgot to mention it to you. They all approved. As for when I accepted the deal...of course, it was during the time you and Mo Yurou were affectionately organizing your engagement party...While I was working, what were you doing? If you don't know how to be the CEO of Tianyi, you can pass it to someone else, there are plenty of people that want your position. What? Is this considered revenge as well?\"\"Han Yufan, as of now, let me give you a warning: If you continue to protect Mo Yurou, Tianyi...will eventually give up on you...\"As Tangning had already risen high above Mo Yurou, Tianyi's shareholders weren't pleased by Han Yufan's decision-making; always causing trouble for Tangning, even at public events like this. Tangning endorsing an international brand was a huge step forward for Tianyi. It was bad enough that he didn't support her, he even went as far as to defame Tangning for the sake of Mo Yurou.On top of everything, because they had high hopes for Mo Yurou, they had wasted all their time and energy on her. In the end, nothing resulted from Secret and she didn't even receive any mentions...She went to the US under the guise of being on the same stage as Tangning. In the end, she only became a part of the backdrop...Was this the level of skills Han Yufan was boasting about that was comparable to Huo Jing Jing?It goes without saying, at this moment, Mo Yurou the international supermodel with a promising future was about to fall into the depths of the abyss and become abandoned. She was overshadowed by Tangning so much, people even thought she wasn't alive. Who was going to look up someone that appeared to be part of the backdrop?Han Ruoxue glared at Tangning fiercely. She had never thought, while they were relaxing, Tangning managed to accept a deal with such a famous French brand; increasing the distance between her and Mo Yurou by thousands of miles...As a manager, this was the first time she didn't know how to deal with an artist.After this issue of Secret, Tangning's popularity and status would be increased; whereas Mo Yurou would go the opposite direction.Originally, all Mina wanted, was a simple celebration dinner, but instead, it had now turned into Tianyi's internal fighting grounds. So, she called the security guard over to escort Mo Yurou out of the hotel. However, she was stopped by Han Ruoxue, \"We can show ourselves out...\"\"Tangning, you are ruthless.\"No matter how ruthless she was, it was only fair.But, it didn't matter if Tangning had won this battle or signed a deal with ISN, it wasn't enough. Even watching the three being sent out helplessly wasn't enough. Han Yufan was still the president of Tianyi and Mo Yurou had not been pushed completely to the depths, so an even more impressive show was yet to come.After leaving the hotel, Mo Yurou knelt on the ground dumbfounded. At this time, this helpless scene was captured by Mo Ting who was waiting for Tangning in his car; he secured a recording on his phone.She only received such a small blow and she already couldn't handle it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trial Marriage Husband: Need to Work HardCH 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAmongst the darkness, Mo Yurou and the others couldn\u2019t see Mo Ting at all. All they could do was stand around with faces full of resentment as they used all types of insults to complain about Tanging. From his hidden position, Mo Ting watched their helpless expressions as the corners of his mouth slightly curved up. How dare they insult his wife...if he hadn\u2019t heard, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered\u2026but since he heard it\u2026\u2026then\u2026\u2026luck must not be on their side...In the dark, Mo Ting picked up his phone and made a call to Lu Che, \"Help me find out which agency Han Ruoxue works for.\"\"Yes, president!\" Lu Che answered swiftly.Before leaving the US, he definitely needed to leave something behind for Han Ruoxue. After all, she had done so much to Tangning, including tricking her into coming all the way here to be Mo Yurou\u2019s stepping stone. He thought about it, what he was about to do was after Tangning had already won her battle against them, so it wouldn\u2019t be considered as interfering in her business, right?Amongst the bright and colorful celebration dinner, Tangning maintained her smile as she mixed with the guests and reporters. As she didn\u2019t want Mo Ting to wait too long, she said she wasn't feeling well as an excuse and left the dinner midway, taking Lin Wei and Long Jie with her.After walking out of the main entrance of the hotel, Tangning successfully spotted Mo Ting amidst the darkness. This man, who was the center of attention, always seemed to disregard his own identity and wait for her amongst various hidden corners. Lin Wei and Long Jie didn\u2019t want to be lightbulbs\u00a0so they took their own taxi back to the manor, leaving Tangning on her own to board Mo Ting\u2019s car.Mo Ting watched as Tangning approached. Seeing her shoulders were still exposed, he quickly removed his suit jacket and placed it on her, \"Didn\u2019t you think of asking Long Jie to prepare a jacket for you when you left the manor this morning?\"\"If I had asked Long Jie to prepare one, would I still have had the chance to wear this jacket that contains your warmth?\" Tangning smiled, before continuing, \"President Mo\u2019s jacket can\u2019t simply be worn by anyone.\"Mo Ting was completely defeated by her as he caringly held onto her icy cold hands and helped her into the car, \"Let\u2019s go home\u2026\"Upon returning to the manor, the whole place had been transformed. The bedroom was covered with fresh flowers and fragrant candles were lit throughout the entire house.Mo Ting hugged Tangning from behind as he placed a kiss on her back, \"This is to celebrate you returning with glory\u2026\"\"These past few days, you haven\u2019t had a proper night\u2019s rest. Since we finally had a day off\u2026\" \u2013 Tangning\u2019s voice sounded a little choked up \u2013 \"\u2026why didn\u2019t you get some rest? We will be flying home tomorrow. After that, you will be busy again\u2026\"\"If you feel guilty, then why don\u2019t you give me a massage later?\"Tangning looked around as she enjoyed the fragrance. She grabbed onto Mo Ting\u2019s arm and pushed him onto the bed. Then, with the essential oils she got from Long Jie, she poured some into her hand and gently pressed against Mo Ting\u2019s back. Mo Ting\u2019s body had always been worth mentioning, as it had always been built and firm, however, because of the demanding work he had been doing over the past few days, his muscles had become extra tense. Tangning was a bit upset; ever since marrying Mo Ting, it seemed she hadn\u2019t spent much time taking care of his health.\"I will reflect on this\u2026\" Tangning reminded herself.\"Huh?\" Mo Ting didn\u2019t know what she wanted to reflect on, so he made a questioning sound.\"I will take good care of you\u2026\" Ever since the incident with Han Yufan, Tangning had learned to cherish everything she had; she had already lost too much, she wasn\u2019t going to let anyone snatch anything else from her, especially not\u2026Mo Ting.Hearing her words, Mo Ting turned around and pulled her close to his chest, \"From what I see, I think you need to be taken care of more, but\u2026when it comes to reflecting, you really need to do some reflecting. Ning\u2026I want you.\"Tangning looked at Mo Ting, her eyes were clear and sincere, \"What a coincidence\u2026me too\u2026but, you need to slow down\u2026\"The married couple were extremely in sync when it came to this. Tangning didn\u2019t put on an act and Mo Ting didn\u2019t play around; everything they did was purely based on their passion and love for each other....[Tangning Sets Off The Oriental Trend: A Big Hit in Europe And The States!] , [Tangning Pressures Mo Yurou: Makes Her Become The Backdrop] , [Tangning Endorses ISN: Becomes The Well-Deserved Favorite In The Western Market!] ; These were the headlines plastered all over the Oriental Daily News. The Tangning that had kept a low-profile while being stepped all over by Mo Yurou, had ultimately used her most professional self to instantly defeat Mo Yurou - she used her own capabilities to show everyone what was the true Oriental Trend.And thanks to the aid of Secret and ISN, Tangning\u2019s status was no longer on the same level as the day she arrived on US soil.Of course, apart from fans overseas, fans back at home were also cheering Tangning\u2019s impressive results. Back when Lin Wei told everyone to have faith in Tangning, it put confidence back into the hearts of many fans as they waited patiently for her victory. As expected, Tangning did not disappoint. She truly rose up, not allowing anyone to ever see her as an outdated model again...Upon seeing the news, Han Ruoxue and Mo Yurou smashed everything in sight. Tangning\u2019s popularity not only meant Mo Yurou had failed, but also meant, from now on, there was no way they could suppress her...On the other hand, Mo Yurou who had originally been praised so highly and had even been compared to Huo Jing Jing, went the opposite way. How ashamed would she be to return home?A model that shot the front cover of a magazine received no attention and had become Tangning\u2019s backdrop; this joke would be spoken about for years to come.\"That\u2019s enough, you two can stop smashing things!\" Han Yufan was getting a headache from watching them. Deep down his emotions were even more complex than Mo Yurou and his sister\u2019s. Tianyi\u2019s shareholders had already pressured him earlier on; they were unimpressed by his persistent support of Mo Yurou. They had invested so much manpower and resources into Mo Yurou, only to find in the end, the results were shocking...No mentions!This was not because Mo Yurou was unlucky though\u2026it was because Tangning was too powerful. As business people, the most important thing to them was profits. If Han Yufan continued on like this, they weren\u2019t going to sit around and do nothing!\"Yufan, how about we get mum to help.\"Han Ruoxue suggested to get help from their mother, but Han Yufan never mentioned his mother because he didn\u2019t feel like his mother was anything worth mentioning. Ever since the death of his father, his mother couldn\u2019t handle being lonely, so, she eventually broke up a happy family and became the wife of a director. All these years, they barely contacted each other because, on top of everything, his mother had also become somebody\u2019s stepmother.\"Jie\u2026this issue\u2026let\u2019s talk about it when we get home,\" Han Yufan responded impatiently.\"Yufan, you couldn\u2019t possibly be blaming me, right?\" Han Ruoxue could sense Han Yufan was upset, \"Yufan, it\u2019s true that I planned everything, but who do you think I did it for? I did everything for you guys. Mo Yurou didn\u2019t meet expectations, how could you blame me for that? Why don\u2019t you blame Tangning, the b*tch?\"Not long after Han Ruoxue spoke, the phone in her hand started ringing. As soon as she saw it was from her company, she quickly stabilized her emotions and answered, \"Hello?\"\"Han Ruoxue, J-King is in trouble, where have you been?\" the person on the other side of the phone questioned.She had been spending so much time sticking her nose into other people\u2019s business, that she didn\u2019t even pay attention to her own artists. As a result, a recently famous girl band of hers was discovered doing drugs by their fans. It wasn\u2019t easy to accumulate the fame, yet in one night, it was all destroyed. Worst of all, while all this was happening, Han Ruoxue was nowhere to be seen.\"President\u2026\"\"From tomorrow onwards, you don\u2019t need to come to work anymore. I am going to make sure you are blacklisted in America!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You used the resources provided by the company to help your brother, did you think we wouldn\u2019t find out? Secret was originally one of our resources. If one of our own models appeared on the front cover this issue, the Oriental Trend would have been under our own control, but what did you do instead? Han Ruoxue, prepare the compensation for breaching your contract.\" After speaking, he hung up the phone; not allowing Han Ruoxue the chance to redeem herself.Han Ruoxue was dumbfounded as she dropped her arms. Her mouth continuously mumbled similar words, \"It\u2019s over\u2026everything is over. My career\u2026is also over.\"\"Jie\u2026what happened?\"\"It was all because of you!\" Han Ruoxue screamed with all her might, \"Because of you, I was fired. On top of that, I have to pay 10 million dollars for breaching my contract\u202610 million US DOLLARS!\"Han Yufan and Mo Yurou were stunned\u2026they never expected the consequences would be so dire.\"Not only that, I will also be blacklisted. Do you know what that means? It means\u2026in the US, I can no longer make a living here. All the effort I have put in over the years has all been wasted.\" After Han Ruoxue was finished screaming, she dropped to the floor bitterly. At this moment, she was filled with regret and hate. Why did she help this useless brother? Why did she help Mo Yurou go against Tangning?\"Jie\u2026you haven\u2019t lost everything, you still have me.\"\"Go away! You only have Mo Yurou in your eyes,\" Han Ruoxue pushed Han Yufan away.\"Jie\u2026I will help you.\"\"Fine, if you want to help me, then\u2026help me pay off half of the compensation for breaching my contract. Also, I want to become Tangning\u2019s manager. If you guys won\u2019t support her, then I will. I am going to use Tanging to help me make a comeback,\" Han Ruoxue snapped. \"Do you have the courage to agree to this?\"Han Yufan and Mo Yurou glanced at each other; this was absolute nonsense. Not only would he not allow his sister to help an enemy, even if they were to agree, there was no way Tangning would allow it. However, on the surface, he still had to find a way to brush her off, so he used Tangning as an excuse, \"I can help you with your compensation by selling some shares, we will get over this together. However, if you think about how we previously treated Tangning, there is no way she would let you become her manager. Plus, she already has Lin Wei.\"\"How does Lin Wei compare to me? Since Tianyi can no longer control Tangning\u2019s progress, then why don\u2019t we personally help her to the top? At least that way we can boost our own reputation. Most importantly, I can keep an eye on Tangning; this is like killing THREE birds with one stone!\" Han Ruoxue was dreaming about controlling Tangning.She was full of hate and an unwillingness to accept defeat. She wanted to see, if she was to become Tangning\u2019s manager, whether Tangning could still do as she liked.Listening to Han Ruoxue\u2019s reasoning, Han Yufan started to reconsider: even if they couldn\u2019t suppress Tangning, at least Han Ruoxue would be able to stop Tangning from causing trouble. If he was to agree to this, he and Mo Yurou would be able to breathe a sigh of relief.\"Jie, I\u2019ll agree to it.\"\"You guys return to China first, after I\u2019ve sorted everything out here, I will come back and take over Tangning.\"Taking over Tangning? Let\u2019s see if Mo Ting would allow that!\"OK\u2026\" Han Yufan replied.Mo Yurou wasn\u2019t happy with this decision. She couldn\u2019t believe they were going to personally make Tangning famous. However, this incident with Secret Magazine, was indeed her fault for implicating Han Yufan and Han Ruoxue. So, at this point, there was nothing she could say; all she could do was look at Han Yufan with a sulky expression, \"Don\u2019t you want me anymore?\"\"What are you talking about? You saw it too, there is no way we can suppress Tangning. Let\u2019s leave it to my sister to handle her, that way we can have some time to relax. Yurou, I won\u2019t give up on you.\"Mo Yurou thought, as long as she still had Han Yufan in her grasp, she would still eventually become the first lady of Tianyi. If this was to happen, she would have a chance for a comeback.As for Tangning spreading her wings, they still had plenty of time!On the same day that afternoon, KLA agency released an announcement about canceling their contract with Han Ruoxue. During their announcement, they pointed out three major mistakes she made and claimed they would chase her for compensation. They also announced they would be blacklisting her.Of course, she was only a manager, even if she was to break ties with her company, it wouldn\u2019t cause much commotion. However, upon seeing this news, Tangning was surprised. Her gaze unconsciously turned towards Mo Ting. This man\u2026he really couldn\u2019t help himself.ISN\u2019s photo shoot was nearing and as it was to be located in Beijing, Tangning had to immediately return to China.This time, Tangning finally didn\u2019t have to catch the same flight as Han Yufan and Mo Yurou. Also because of her fame in the US, her fans no longer had to hold back their cheers. Her fan club even organized an event for all the fans to welcome her at the airport. So, early in the morning, the airport was completely packed.\"Tangning, did you know Han Yufan and Mo Yurou are also flying today?\" Lin Wei asked while they were on the way to the airport.\"Yeah, I know\u2026so, you should know what to do, right?\" Tangning was reading the newspaper while holding onto Mo Ting\u2019s hand. Previously, when she flew to Liusen, Mo Yurou had revealed her schedule online and got anti-fans to cause her trouble. This time, Mo Yurou was returning defeated and had become a joke in the industry; she definitely needed to pay her back. How could she be considered a joke until she experiences being surrounded by anti-fans?\"Tangning, you still haven\u2019t used the information about Mo Yurou being pregnant, what do you plan to do?\" Long Jie suddenly asked.Mo Yurou\u2019s pregnant? Lin Wei thought.\"All along she\u2019s been aiming for the Top Ten Model Awards. But, don\u2019t forget about the selection criteria. Pregnant women\u2026aren\u2019t qualified to receive an award,\" Tangning replied calmly.\"Then what are you waiting for? Let\u2019s just release it\u2026\"\"According to Mo Yurou\u2019s personality, she will definitely use whatever means to qualify. I\u2019m going to wait until she appears on stage to receive the award\u2026at that time, I\u2019ll send her to her grave.\"After hearing what Tangning said, Long Jie understood.To receive something and immediately lose it\u2026this was the true experience of pain.Above all, until the day Mo Yurou receives an award, Tianyi would still feel like she has hope. So by making her receive it and then lose it, was the only way to guarantee she wouldn\u2019t be able to make a comeback - the Top Ten Model Awards only gave each model one chance.Mo Ting held onto Tangning\u2019s hand tightly the entire time, because he knew, even though Tangning had made Mo Yurou into her backdrop, it still would not be enough to satiate the pain she had previously received; she would continuously pick away at Mo Yurou, until...the day came when Mo Yurou no longer had the strength to revive herself and Han Yufan completely gave up on her. She wanted Mo Yurou to experience being thrown away.Mo Ting didn't want to see Tangning so depressed, so he pulled out his phone and looked for the photos he took the night before. He then handed his phone to Lin Wei, \"Place this photo online...\"It was a photo of Mo Yurou kneeling on the ground...A photo of Mo Yurou at her lowest point...Lin Wei looked at the scheming couple as her and Long Jie both gave a sly smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though the temperature was hot, Tangning wrapped herself up tightly. However, before she stepped out of the car, Mo Ting gently patted her on the head as he spoke, \"There are a lot of fans at the airport, if they see us together it will cause you trouble; I will wait for you in the first class cabin. You are currently on the rise, you can't have any scandals.\"Tangning lifted her head to look at Mo Ting with an apologetic look in her eyes. In reality, she was Mo Ting's wife, but they could never be seen in the public together; sometimes they even had to act like complete strangers. But, she also understood, Mo Ting didn't want her hard-earned achievements to go to waste.Thinking of this, Tangning gave a reassuring smile as she held onto Mo Ting's hand, \"Wait for me...Wait until I am on the same level as you. I will personally announce to the world that we are husband and wife; an invincible married couple.\"Mo Ting wrapped his hand around her neck as he pulled her in for a kiss. His eyes twinkled like a vast sea of stars, \"You should get going...\"In reality, Mo Ting really wanted to keep Tangning hidden away in his home, that way only he could come in contact with her beauty. However, Tangning was born for the runway; her superstar aura couldn't be denied. So, sending Tangning to the pinnacle was his mission and aim in life...This feeling...made him feel helpless, but also happy.Tangning stepped out of the Lincoln Limo, changed into another luxury car and headed to the airport with Long Jie and Lin Wei. Because the Oriental Trend was a big hit, there was no way the airport would be as peaceful as when Tangning first arrived, so Mo Ting organized for 4 bodyguards to follow her.\"Ahhh...it's Tangning...\"The screams of the people coming from inside the airport could already be heard from the sidewalk outside.Tangning unconsciously started walking faster. Deep down she sighed, how could these people have such good eyesight? She wrapped herself up so tightly, yet they still recognized her.\"Tangning, things have really changed,\" Long Jie sighed behind her. \"You have the option of taking the VIP entry to avoid the fans, do you want to do that?\"\"Of course not,\" Tangning immediately rejected the option. \"If I can't even handle this, how many fans would be disappointed? My fans are supporting my career, there is no reason for me to avoid them,\" Tangning decided to hold her head high as she headed into the airport. Upon seeing her, fans and reporters all flocked to her side. Mo Ting's bodyguards quickly formed a human barrier and escorted her pass the security checks into the waiting area.\"Tangning...can we get your autograph?\"\"Tangning, we really like you, you need to keep going...\"\"Tangning, you are always welcome to come back to the US.\"Tangning maintained her smile. When she came across smaller groups of people, she would generously give them an autograph. After entering the terminal, she took multiple photos with fans. Eventually, Lin Wei had to intercept and regretfully turn them away by telling them Tangning hadn't had much rest lately because of work, hopefully they could understand.While sitting in the terminal, Tangning glanced around for Mo Ting. Finally, in the middle of the seating area, she spotted Mo Ting sitting peacefully with sunglasses on as he flipped through the latest issue of Secret. The old American lady next to him noticed the magazine in his hands and smiled as she asked, \"Young man, after you're finished with that, may I take a look? This magazine has been so popular lately, I haven't been able to buy it anywhere.\"Mo Ting nodded gently, \"Of course.\"Tangning sat two rows behind Mo Ting and stared at his handsome back. She really wanted to ask him how he felt holding onto his wife's magazine. In reality, Mo Ting had the choice to sit in the VIP lounge and wait, but in order to accompany her...Tangning's eyes welled up as she pulled out her phone and typed a few words, \"Your back looks good.\"Mo Ting handed the magazine in his hands to the old lady and took a look at his phone. The corners of his mouth curved up as he replied, \"After we return home, get Lu Che to change the person holding your hand in the front cover to me. There won't be zero mentions anymore, right?\"\"You can't do that President Mo! If you do that, then no one will notice me anymore.\"The smile on Mo Ting's mouth increased as a thought crossed his mind; he wanted to enlarge Tangning's solo photo in the magazine and hang it all over their bedroom.\"I really want to turn around and look at you...\"Seeing those words, Tangning's heart ached. At this time, the airport announced their flight was ready for boarding. Tangning stood up and walked to the front. Following closely behind, Mo Ting also got up and walked behind her. Like this...he wouldn't need to turn around to look at her.During the boarding process, many people gradually recognized Tangning. They wanted to move forward to talk to her, but, not knowing if Mo Ting was doing it on purpose, he kept standing in front of them, until Tangning finally headed into the first class cabin...She was his wife...of course he would take care of her and protect her...At least, within his sight, he had to do that....At the same time, a very entertaining photo started spreading through Beijing's online community. The B-grade model, Mo Yurou, who gloriously went overseas, was meant to overcome all obstacles and rise to a new level in her career. After all, after going overseas, she compared herself to many famous supermodels, used the fact that she was an Asian model as a gimmick and secured a few endorsements. However, as soon as Secret's magazine was released, Tangning became a legend, whereas she became a joke.'Zero Attention' became her nickname. But, all the ridicule from the public wasn't enough. Early in the morning, an extremely long meme was posted up online. The meme consisted of 10 photos of models she had previously been compared to; the model's photos were on the left, her photos were on the right. Their photos were from all different shows, whereas her photos...consisted of the same photo......the photo of her kneeling on the ground...After this meme went viral, it grabbed the attention of many famous online personalities; they all began to ridicule her.This devastating result would have never been predicted by Tianyi. Also, because of Mo Yurou's defeat, all her previous scandals started resurfacing; humiliating her once again.This was how the entertainment industry was like; the winner takes all...\"Yurou, how about you stay in the US?\" Han Yufan was worried she wouldn't be able to handle the blow and it would hurt her pregnancy.\"No need. I want to see how Tangning plans to step on me.\" Most importantly, the final selection for the Top Ten Model Awards was in 4 days. She wanted to make a gamble...since she didn't get good results, all she could do now was...look for the judges...\"Fine then, we will go home as soon as we get off the plane,\" Han Yufan responded. He had no idea at this moment what Mo Yurou was planning.However, even if they were to head straight home, they still had to leave the airport. At this time, paparazzi were lurking; they had their eyes set on them for a long time. Their cars surrounded them and started chasing them.After seeing the humiliation online, Mo Yurou finally started crying in the car...She had failed too miserably and fallen too painfully!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was ridiculously wrong about her; the girl that had once been willing to do anything for him no longer showed him any mercy. Even if she was to exhaust all the strength in her body, the purpose would be to make Mo Yurou crumble beneath her feet.It was only because it wasn't his turn yet, that he didn't feel any urgency.Outside the arrivals gate, Tangning's fans were scattered all over the place. Some were holding signs with Tangning's name on it, others were screaming her name. Originally, this was something Tianyi should have been proud of, but...deep down, Han Yufan wasn't even the tiniest bit happy. Tangning's value had now increased dramatically and she was no longer under the control of Tianyi. Apart from placing all his hope in Han Ruoxue, there was nothing else he could do.Otherwise, he would only fall into the depths of the abyss along with Mo Yurou.Did he really have no choice but to contact his mother?Tangning's return was full of glory. After signing the deal with ISN, she was pretty much guaranteed that every job she took from now on would be even better. Most importantly, her low-profile personality meant she never depended on creating hype to gain people's attention. This helped her gain many loyal fans. As a result, her foundation was stable and she now occupied a spot in the modeling industry.Han Yufan looked at the news about Tangning and Mo Yurou; his eyebrows scrunched up. After returning home he ignored Mo Yurou and locked himself in his room to make some phone calls.Mo Yurou felt uneasy about this because she knew Tianyi did not solely belong to Han Yufan. With her current bad reputation, Han Yufan would definitely be trapped in a difficult position between her and the company.\"You Ge, help me find out who the judges are for the Top Ten Model Awards...\"\"Yurou, what do you want to do?\" Mo Yurou's assistant had mixed emotions, \"Don't do anything silly. I'm sure if you just rest, with time, you can return to the runway.\"\"Without the last gamble, I am not willing to give up. Just go do what I asked you to do. How long do you think Han Yufan can endure? Tianyi's shareholders are pressuring him non-stop to give up on us; it's only a matter of time. Do you want to return to your life of opening a stall by the side of the street?\"Mo Yurou's assistant froze for a moment. He obviously didn't want to do as she requested...he also didn't want Mo Yurou to go down a dangerous path. By doing what he assumed she'd do, she would be putting a tear in her relationship with Han Yufan - one that may never be reversed. But he knew, apart from sleeping with one of the judges, what else could she do to turn the tables?\"Yurou, you still have a child in your stomach...\"\"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing,\" Mo Yurou said with a solemn expression.The industry had always been this dark. She had once thought Han Yufan was the best person she could rely on, but...after the incident with Secret Magazine, Han Yufan could only watch as she returned defeated; he couldn't think of any methods of redemption. That's when she understood, this man wasn't reliable at all.A wise person chooses the right environment - that's only right.Within the study room, Han Yufan was still stressing over how to protect Mo Yurou. Meanwhile, the people outside were already thinking of how to betray him...Tangning's return, Secret's popularity, ISN's deal; this was all meant to take him to new heights and increase the value of Tianyi. But Han Yufan, the president, wasn't happy.ISN's commercial was currently being shot, so from the moment Tangning returned from the US she hadn't taken a single step into Tianyi. It was not until 2 days later, when the commercial was finished, that she finally returned to the office.Inside the CEO's office, Han Yufan was looking at Tangning with complex emotions, \"Tangning, you've already gotten what you want, don't be too forceful, give her a chance to survive.\"Tangning looked at Han Yufan as she replied calmly, \"When we were in the US, did you give me a chance? If you can't do it, then don't expect others to do it?\"\"You...\" Han Yufan's tongue was tied for a moment, because he knew, if the situation was flipped and Mo Yurou was the successful one, they would have used the most extreme measures to prevent Tangning from ever making a comeback. So, at this moment, apart from anger, he was also feeling regret. He no longer looked at Tangning, instead he turned his gaze to Lin Wei and ordered, \"Lin Wei, pack your things and prepare to work with a different artist, I've already organized a new manager for Tangning.\"After hearing this, Lin Wei's face turned pale as Tangning frowned, \"What game are you trying to play now?\"\"Tangning, your contract still has 3 years left. Lin Wei is a manager under our company, I can make her do what I want, you have no right to interfere.\"Contract?Did Han Yufan think he could still control her contract?\"Then, the least you can do is tell me who you have organized for me,\" Tangning chased him for an answer as she gave Lin Wei a comforting look. With this little bit of assurance, Lin Wei's flustered heart immediately calmed down. She knew Tangning would get a better manager sooner or later, but she definitely couldn't continue to stay in Tianyi; she had previously betrayed Mo Yurou and took on Tangning's side, if she was to leave Tangning, Mo Yurou would definitely make her suffer.However, Tangning's gaze told her...Even if she couldn't keep her, she wouldn't let her be sent into the tiger's mouth......and anything Tangning wanted to do, she would do. So, she trusted Tangning and remained patient.\"Tomorrow, the company will hold a celebration dinner for you. At that time, she will appear. Don't worry, this manager will definitely be more skilled than Lin Wei; you won't be worse off. Unless you still think I am trying to suppress you?\" Han Yufan felt embarrassed that Tangning had slowly achieved so much without him noticing.Tangning didn't say anything and did not refuse. Of course, she couldn't trust that Han Yufan would be doing something good for her, but she couldn't just refuse or else there would be no end to this.She had to make sure she remained in power.As Tangning left the room, Lin Wei was left behind. Tangning gave her a look, gesturing her to drag on as long as she could and to not let Han Yufan find out about the details of her work. Lin Wei subtly nodded her head, if she couldn't even do something this simple, all that she had learned from Tangning would go to waste.\"Where's Lin Wei?\" Long Jie asked as she saw Tangning return on her own.\"Han Yufan arranged for her to take care of other artists and has organized a new manager for me,\" Tangning replied.\"Who is it?\" Long Jie was on guard as she asked.Tangning did not respond, she simply put on her sunglasses and left Tianyi with Long Jie. She returned to Hyatt Regency and entered her home. At that time, Mo Ting was already home. Hearing what had happened to her, the couple had the same thought.\"Ting, are you thinking what I'm thinking?\" Tangning questioned.\"Han Ruoxue!\" Mo Ting replied.As expected. Tangning revealed a slight smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Plus, her dream is to control you and make you surrender to her...\" Mo Ting gazed at Tangning with a serious expression as he analyzed what Han Ruoxue was thinking. \"Of course, it's not hard for you to shake her off.\"Tangning smiled slightly, she already had everything thought out. Upon seeing her expression, Long Jie knew a small obstacle like this wouldn't be able to stand in Tangning's way; she felt a sense of relief.Tangning's plan was to take place after The Top Ten Model Awards. So anything that was to happen between now and then, she already took into consideration. The only thing Long Jie could do for her now, was to comfort Lin Wei.After Long Jie left, the couple entered the bedroom together and changed into home clothes. Mo Ting hugged Tangning in front of the wardrobe mirror as he asked in her ear, \"You still don't plan on leaving Tianyi?\"\"It's not time yet...\" She only needed one final step to completely destroy Mo Yurou; there was no way she would let the two off so easily.\"But, you should decide on your next goal.\" Mo Ting knew Tangning didn't like to take shortcuts, so he didn't mention signing with Hai Rui. \"Now that you have popularity and people are talking about you, your next goal should be...\"\"I need a notable award,\" Tangning replied gently. She understood where she stood and she understood the entertainment industry was like a pool of deep water; today she could still keep people talking about her, but tomorrow, the attention could easily be snatched away by some new entertainer. So, by obtaining a notable award, she would be able to establish a status in the industry, \"However, Ting...I am already 26 years old. I can no longer act like I am 17 and compete in a modeling competition. And the awards I received in the past have lost their value ever since Star King Entertainment blacklisted me...back then, I retreated too desperately and burnt my own bridges.\"In the past, she really did everything she could for Han Yufan...A model's best years, their most glorious years...she had selflessly given them all to Han Yufan. But in the end, what did she get in return?However, Tangning did not regret. After all, it was the road that she chose. It's just, now she had to face the consequences of her silly mistakes.After hearing her, Mo Ting's heart ached for her. If he had met her earlier, maybe she wouldn't have had to go through all this pain. He planted a kiss on Tangning's neck and comforted her with a gentle voice, \"It doesn't matter...If you can't enter a competition, it doesn't matter, just work hard as a model. If you need to attend shows or appear in magazines, I will accompany you...We can make use of good exposure. After all, the industry is where the true battle is. Honey, don't give yourself too much pressure...\"Tangning took a deep breath as she turned around and wrapped her arms around Mo Ting's waist. She buried her head in his chest and sighed, \"Don't worry, with you as my goal, I won't be easily destroyed.\"Mo Ting took a deep breath as he lifted Tangning in his arms. After returning to the bedroom, he placed her on the bed and gently pressed his body on top of her, \"I think, the best way to make you forget about the past, is to...love you deeply.\"After hearing this, Tangning's ears flushed red. She could tell his words contained two meanings, \"You haven't eaten yet. After working hard all day, do you still have the energy?\"\"I guess the only way to find out, is if I prove it...\" After speaking, Mo Ting's kiss lowered onto her lips......Because of Tangning's popularity, Mo Yurou became the target of everyone's hatred. So, Tianyi's celebration dinner, Han Yufan was not going to allow her to attend. It was exactly at this time, that Mo Yurou a chance to meet with the judges for the awards. Research into the judges was done behind Tianyi's back by Mo Yurou's assistant. In total, there were 7 people: 3 females, 4 males. Mo Yurou quickly brushed the 3 females aside and placed her focus on a 40-something-year-old male judge. He had a dark history which always seemed to be covered up.\"Yurou...\" Mo Yurou's assistant watched as she picked up the male's photo; his heart was racing, \"You...\"\"You Lin, help me find out when I can meet with this judge.\"\"Yurou...\"\"I know what you are thinking. If I don't take this step, I will lose Han Yufan, and not only this, I will have nothing left,\" Mo Yurou spoke in a cruel manner. Right now, she had no way to survive in Beijing. If she didn't help herself find another way out, she didn't know how much lower Tangning would push her, \"I definitely need to get the award, at all costs!\"Mo Yurou's assistant had no choice but to pull out his phone and stand to one side as he phoned the man with respect. At first, the man on the other side didn't plan on answering, but, after You Lin called three times in a row, he finally picked up.Mo Yurou's assistant expressed his thoughts in a simple manner and the man understood their intention. In the end, he requested to speak to Mo Yurou personally.\"Yurou...\"Mo Yurou reached out her hand and grabbed the phone. With a smile she answered, \"Mr. Li\" As he was a high-profile artist, she lowered herself when talking to him.\"So, you are Mo Yurou? I've watched your shows. Actually...you aren't that bad, but as I'm sure you are aware, your reputation hasn't been very good recently...how about tomorrow at 7pm, you come to Hong Fan Hotel, we can have a chat.\"\"Yurou...is this what you want? You are pregnant and that old man is despicable...\"\"Do I have another choice?\" Mo Yurou turned her head and questioned her assistant, \"Tangning has pushed me into a corner, I can't let her succeed. If she wants me to surrender, she must be dreaming!\"The assistant was helpless. All he could do was grind his teeth, \"Then tomorrow I will help you take some photos for evidence, in case that old man gets what he wants and leaves.\"Han Yufan had no idea, Mo Yurou had already made such a filthy decision. While he was desperately trying to fix things on the outside, he lost Mo Yurou's vain heart. Of course, this was all karma; like the way he betrayed Tangning, Mo Yurou was now betraying him in the same way.On the same day, early in the morning, Han Ruoxue had already dealt with her contract in America and had returned to Beijing. Han Yufan went to the airport on his own to pick her up. As soon as Han Ruoxue entered Han Yufan's apartment, she asked about where Tangning was living.\"Jie...Yurou hasn't been in a good mood the past few days. Don't provoke her...keep your voice down.\"\"She didn't live up to expectations, she can't blame others,\" Han Ruoxue responded coldly.\"Tangning lives in Hyatt Regency,\" Han Yufan replied impatiently.\"How does she live in such a good place? In that case, I will move to her place tomorrow. It will make work more convenient.\" Han Ruoxue had no intention of living in Han Yufan's apartments and didn't want to see Mo Yurou.But, Hyatt Regency was not the type of place a person like her could live!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tangning wasn't invited to the meeting, the excuse was that it was only a pitch. However, Lin Wei was clear about Han Ruoxue's true intentions - Han Ruoxue merely treated Tangning as a chess piece. No matter how high Tangning's status was, she was still going to maintain her power to control her artist.Lin Wei projected Tangning's job offers onto the projector screen - there were 23 of them! Seeing this, Han Yufan was shocked. Amongst the offers, there was no lack of 2nd-tier magazines. He never expected the public had such a high degree of acknowledgment for Tangning.Of course, Lin Wei did not reveal the offers Tangning was currently considering. These included the offers from...Creative Century and Star Age; two big superstar factories who had thrown her an expensive offer.With Tangning's current status, a small studio like Tianyi, could no longer be of much help to her. Plus, the contract that hung to Han Ruoxue's lips could no longer bind Tangning.It seemed Han Ruoxue had already forgotten the battle with Secret and still believed Tangning's success was due to luck.\"At present, because of the Oriental Trend, Tangning is extremely popular; she has gained quite a bit of fame in the European and American markets. As long as we take advantage of the current situation, with my contacts, we can speedily get her onto multiple stages. However, she needs to be obedient towards me...otherwise, I can also destroy her...\"It appeared, tonight's celebration dinner for Tangning, was more like an announcement dinner for Han Ruoxue taking on her new role.A manager that had been blacklisted by the Americans - with a blink of an eye - returned to Beijing to continue to wreak havoc on the world.Meanwhile, Tangning already found out about the morning's meeting from Lin Wei; Han Ruoxue had planned out her career path overseas. Of course, that would be ideal for most models, after all, this path had the most potential, but...Tangning was no longer 17 years old. Without enough background support, she couldn't be like a young model and start from the beginning as a fit model. It's not that she was afraid it would be too difficult, but she didn't have much youth left. The next 3 years for her, was critical!\"Tangning, what do you plan to do now? Han Ruoxue isn't going to give up on you.\"\"I...have my plans...Lin Wei, thank you,\" Tangning thanked her sincerely.\"Tangning, this is actually a good opportunity for me to leave you. I know your manager will only get better and better...I am not good enough to stay by your side. You've taught me so much and made me understand a lot of things. Don't worry, we have a confidentiality agreement between us, I will not reveal your business to others. I just hope, in the end, Tianyi can let me go.\" Lin Wei was determined; if she continued to work for Tangning, she would only continue to be led by her and not have the opportunity to show off her managerial skills. She was impressed by Tangning, but she also had her own goals.\"As you wish,\" Tangning nodded.\"Are we still friends?\"\"Of course...\" Tangning replied calmly.\"My photos...I'll leave them with you; it can serve as a warning for me. Tangning, I will keep an eye on you; I'll watch as you leap onto the international stage.\"\"Lin Wei, I also wish all the best for you.\"Lin Wei understood she had already completed her mission and it was time for her to retreat. According to Tangning's personality, she never held back on her enemies. At the same time, she never made things difficult for her friends. So, of course, she preferred to be her friend....Not long after, Beijing's night sky was densely dotted with stars. At the same time, Tangning was well prepared for a battle with Han Ruoxue.On the way to the hotel, Mo Ting held onto Tangning's hand; giving her strength. Tangning looked at Mo Ting and smiled, \"No need to worry about me, I'm already used to it...I'm well prepared for a big battle, even if Han Ruoxue is a tough enemy.\"\"I just care about you...\"\"Hubby, there is no need to wait for me tonight. Be a good boy and go home to sleep. You work so hard every day, don't tire yourself out because of me.\" Tangning gripped onto Mo Ting's hand, \"I promise, I won't allow myself to suffer any loss.\"\"You said it. If Han Ruoxue makes you suffer at all, I will get Hai Rui to step in.\" Mo Ting embraced Tangning and gently placed a kiss on her forehead. The longer they were a couple, the more he grew to understand her and the more his heart ached for her. She had gone through so much difficulty to go from a caterpillar to a butterfly; the road to revival was not all smooth sailing.Tangning lifted her head and looked at the mole on Mo Ting's earlobe; that was his mark, one that completely charmed her and made her feel light-headed.\"I will not give you the chance to step in, I've already prepared a present for Han Ruoxue; how dare she dream of being my manager! I'm going to make her have the guts to think it, but no chance to say it...\" After all, she was well experienced at tearing apart her enemies.Mo Ting looked gently at Tangning, at her confident eyes; it seemed he really wouldn't get the chance to step in....7pm.\u00a0Tangning arrived at the celebration dinner. At the same time, Mo Yurou entered Hong Fan Hotel.As Tianyi's status was limited, they could only invite a few famous people. Even though Tangning was the protagonist of tonight's celebration dinner...it was obvious Han Yufan only wanted to lure her in. His real intention was to allow Han Ruoxue to step out on the stage.After Tangning got tired of mixing with the guests, she sat down to rest. At this time, she found a waiter and whispered some instructions into his ear; he nodded obediently...Afterwards, amongst the cheers of everyone, Han Yufan walked up the red carpet to the stage.\"Today, apart from celebrating Tangning becoming the Asian spokesperson for ISN, we also have an important decision to announce.\" Han Yufan was wearing a handmade brown suit; he looked absolutely handsome on stage, \"The role of Tianyi's Artists Director will be taken over by my sister, the top manager, Han Ruoxue. Let's welcome her to the stage to continue telling everyone about the good news.\"Han Ruoxue stepped out on the red carpet wearing a long silver dress and a pair of 10cm high high-heeled shoes. She had a proud expression, like a queen, as she looked around. In the end, her gaze focused on Tangning.Her gaze was scheming and sinister with a desire to conquer. Upon seeing her, Tangning's eyebrows furrowed slightly...\"Hello everyone, I am Han Ruoxue. From today onwards I will be Tianyi Entertainment's Artists Director. I also have one more important announcement to make...\"Han Ruoxue continued to look at Tangning...like a hunter locked on its prey...\"I would like to announce...\"As soon as those words left her mouth, the waiter Tangning had instructed earlier, suddenly walked on stage holding a phone and handed it to Han Ruoxue breaking her off mid-sentence. Upon seeing the contents on the phone, she immediately glared at Tangning; she was surprised, angry and unwilling to accept what she saw.But, Tangning maintained her smile the entire time...for Han Ruoxue, this smile was painful to look at.\"I would like to announce...early next year, we will be creating an amazing new band. We have already invited many superstars to be involved. Everyone keep your eyes peeled.\"Han Yufan looked at Han Ruoxue confusedly; she was meant to announce she would become Tangning's manager...why did she suddenly change her mind?\"Jie...what's wrong? The company already knows you will take over Tangning, why are you suddenly like this?\"\"Tangning!\" Han Ruoxue exclaimed as she ground her teeth.Han Yufan turned to look at Tangning. She intervened? How did she intervene?\"What did she show you?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If I dare to publicly announce I am to become her manager, she will also publicly announce she is canceling her contract with Tianyi,\" Han Ruoxue spoke to Han Yufan with an extremely cold tone as she looked at Tangning. \"Yufan, she is using this method to tell us we should be grateful that she is staying in Tianyi and that we shouldn't treat her casually.\"\"She has no shame, so cheap!\"\"I have never hated an artist to this extent. I hate her so much that I want to tear her into a million pieces. Go speak to her, this can't be her only request.\"From the looks of it, after all the times they had confronted each other, Han Ruoxue had developed a certain level of understanding towards Tangning.She had never thought, as a top manager, she would fall into the hands of someone like her.Han Yufan looked at Tangning and motioned her to meet in the waiting room. Accompanied by Long Jie, Tangning headed backstage. The three of them stood in a room as Long Jie looked cautiously at Han Yufan.\"What do you want?\"\"Give Lin Wei her freedom,\" Tangning set out her condition, \"Or else I will set both Lin Wei and myself free - far away from Tianyi.\"\"Fine, I agree to let Lin Wei go. But you can't leave,\" Han Yufan spoke coldly. The waiting room was silent for a while before Han Yufan continued, \"How badly do you hate me for you to think of so many sinister plans to force Yurou and I to this point? My sister wanted to be your manager so she could support you. Who would have thought you'd use canceling your contract to threaten Tianyi...\"\"Han Yufan, to you, everything Mo Yurou and your sister do are right, whereas my counterattack is sinister and scheming. I've said it before...I don't initiate an attack on others, but no one should be calculative towards me,\" Tangning's voice was calm, but also contained an undeniable power. \"By the way, how come we don't see Mo Yurou?\"\"Did you think I would allow Yurou to come here and get hurt?\"\"Whether she would get hurt, I'm not sure. I just know that you should keep your eye on her...don't tell me you don't understand what kind of person she is? The cutoff for the Top Ten Model Awards is tomorrow. What do you think she would do to get what she wants?\"Han Yufan was stunned for a moment, but he remained stubborn, \"Did you think she is calculative like you? To me, she is a bit careless, but...she would never be ruthless like you - stabbing your ex in the back and stepping on the sister that treated you like family.\"\"Really?\" Tangning asked as she looked at Han Yufan, suggesting she thought otherwise. Afterwards, she turned around to leave the room. Not long after, Han Ruoxue entered the room to question Han Yufan.\"What does she want?\"\"She will stay, but Lin Wei will be set free,\" Han Yufan replied.\"Yufan, I'm guessing, with other big companies throwing her alternative options, the fact that she's choosing to stay in Tianyi, must mean she has an even bigger plan ahead. Tangning obviously wants to destroy the Han family; she hates you so much. Yet, we can't seem to do anything about it,\" Han Ruoxue gripped onto the wine glass in her hand as if she was strangling Tangning's neck.\"Then, what's our next move?\" Han Yufan felt powerless towards Tangning.\"I think it's time I go look for mum...\"As the wife of a famous director, Mother Han had many contacts within the industry. They would have to see if she had any ideas on how to easily defeat Tangning....Hong Fan Hotel. In a strictly confidential room. An ambiguous atmosphere lingered. Mo Yurou lay in the arms of a stranger and successfully obtained a promise, \"My precious, you don't need to worry, go home and wait for the good news. The Top Ten Model Awards is pretty much guaranteed.\"Mo Yurou smiled as she peeled\u00a0away the bed sheets and got up. While she put on her clothes she asked, \"Mr. Li, for the sake of insurance, you don't mind that I recorded a video, right? After all, you and I are both clear about this industry; nothing is guaranteed. So...I need to have all bases covered.\"\"What? You recorded a video?\" he had no idea Mo Yurou would do something like this.\"As long as I receive an award, the video will immediately be returned to you. Mr. Li, I'll go home and wait for the good news...\"Mr. Li's face twitched. In the end, all he could do was watch as Mo Yurou left. He never imagined he would have to suffer the consequences of his carelessness.Mo Yurou walked out the main lobby of the hotel and boarded the car her assistant had prepared for her. In the dark of the night, she left without anyone noticing.\"Yurou, should we go to the hospital for a check-up?\" the assistant looked at her and asked.\"No need, I'm fine,\" Mo Yurou shook her head. In order to please Han Yufan in bed, she had already trained herself previously and understood the best way to protect herself. \"Hurry, let's go home. I don't want Yufan to suspect anything.\"\"Yurou, you've given up too much.\"\"If not, what would I use to go up against Tangning?\" Mo Yurou looked out the window; her face was full of hatred. However, she had no idea, all the effort she was putting in to get the award, was in fact...throwing herself into Tangning's trap.This was the entertainment industry; an industry where people were eaten whole. On the outside, it appeared bright and glamorous, but, within it, how many people actually managed to keep their bottom line?Hyatt Regency. 10pm.After Tangning finished speaking to Lin Wei on the phone, she turned around and looked at Mo Ting who was sitting on the sofa. On the table sat her 20-30 offers. No matter how big or small they were, he was going to personally look through each one.Tangning's heart ached as she sat by his side, \"Don't look at them anymore, leave these contracts for Long Jie to handle, it's not an issue.\"\"It's OK for Long Jie to look at the contracts, but she doesn't know how to pick out the good ones.\" Mo Ting wrapped his arm around her and spoke, \"Is the issue with Lin Wei sorted?\"\"Tianyi has canceled her contract and allowed her to go,\" Tangning nodded. \"Ting, you really don't need to look at them anymore, I want you to get some rest...\"\"Do you think I would look at just anyone's contracts? Mrs. Mo, no matter how small of an issue it is, if it is yours - then in my heart it is important.\"\"In that case, let me give you a massage,\" Tangning stood up and walked behind Mo Ting as she started massaging his back.\"Tianyi definitely would have figured by now they can't hold on to you. Throughout the judging period of the Top Ten Model Awards, I will help you take note of what they are doing. Han Ruoxue definitely won't let you go easily. So, during this time, all your contracts - I'll look at them.\"\"Who else's contracts have you looked at?\" Tangning asked with a slight smile, this wasn't something that had ever crossed her mind.\"Do you really want to know?\" Mo Ting asked her back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He couldn't help but smile as he spoke, \"Are you jealous?\"\"Uh huh, a little bit,\" Tangning admitted as she nodded her head.\"Did you think apart from you, there would be someone else in this world that qualifies? Only you...no one else...\" Mo Ting pulled her onto his lap and wrapped his arm around her before showing her how to look at the contracts.Tangning was smart when it came to most things, but when it came to anything with a lot of words, her head would hurt. So not long after, Tangning fell asleep in Mo Ting's embrace. A slight smile was on her face.Mo Ting embraced his wife as he continued to look at the contracts. Although he was tired...he was happy. He leaned over and whispered in Tangning's ear, \"Ning, the day that you return to being Beijing's top model, I will become your personal manager...\"Tangning was sleeping soundly. Upon hearing this, she subconsciously answered, \"Then...I really need to work hard.\"Mo Ting let out a gentle laugh. Amongst the 20-30 contracts, he picked out the one from Trendy Queen; this would be Tangning's first job after returning to the country.Of course, Tianyi would definitely have an opinion towards Mo Ting's decision, because...TQ wasn't in the best-selling magazine category. But, he knew something that other's didn't know; the target audience of TQ were fashion designers and upper-class consumers. Right now, Tangning had to utilize the Oriental Trend to promote herself to fashion designers and those that had hold of fashion resources...This was a risk, but if things worked out, the next half of the year, Tangning's shows would be guaranteed. As long as the shows maintained plenty of exposure and the magazine followed - a beneficial cycle would be formed.Most importantly, appearing in shows would allow her to come in contact with even more endorsement opportunities. This would be easier than relying on her team.Of course, what if it didn't work out?There was no way he would let that happen...The next morning, Tangning woke up. Seeing Mo Ting place the TQ contract in front of her, she was a bit surprised.\"Do you trust me?\" Mo Ting asked as he wrapped his arm around her.Tangning squeezed Mo Ting's tired cheeks and planted a kiss on his lips, \"I'll shoot this one.\"\"You're not going to ask why?\" Mo Ting had originally thought of multiple reasons to convince her. Who would have thought, she simply took one glance at it and decided to trust him.\"The big brother of the entertainment industry stayed up all night to pick this for me. Even if I fail, I am willing,\" Tangning said as she wrapped her arm around Mo Ting's neck. Seeing Mo Ting look at her helplessly, Tangning explained to him in a serious tone, \"First of all, I trust you wholeheartedly, this is needless to say. Secondly, I have also looked at all these contracts and haven't found one that is suited to the awkward state that I am in now, to work towards. I can only make small plans, but I need you to help me see the future.\"A man's ego had always been this easy to satisfy; as long as their own woman says they need them, they would do anything.\"Then it's decided...Contract...\"\"Right now, I no longer have a manager, just an assistant. Which means I have to personally go discuss my own deals even though ISN still has a few things to finish off and Mina still has one more cover for me to shoot. Fortunately, she will be sending someone here and I won't need to fly back to the US.\"Mo Ting touched her hair and admired her confidence as he smiled, \"Give me your email login. When I have time...I'll help you discuss.\"\"Mr. Mo, you promised you won't interfere with my business...\"\"I haven't provided you with any resources, nor have I used any money to help you create contacts...as your husband, can't I share your responsibilities a little?\"Tangning had no choice but to nod her head, \"OK Mr. Mo, but just this once.\"The married couple worked well together to decide on the job. Afterwards, they got out of bed and enjoyed their breakfast. However, just as Tangning was to leave the house, she received a phone call from Long Jie, \"Tangning, Mo Yurou has received an invitation from the organizing committee of the Top Ten Model Awards, the whole company is filled with excitement.\"\"When is the awards ceremony?\" Tangning's eyes held a deeper meaning as she asked.\"In 10 days. During this time, Mo Yurou will be proud again. I wonder how she managed to bribe the judges\" - Long Jie couldn't contain her curiosity - \"Tangning, do you think she did something sneaky behind Han Yufan's back?\"\"Since you can't help but be curious, I'm sure Han Yufan will feel the same way.\" Tangning maintained her usual calmness, \"Let her be proud. After all, it will only be for 10 days...after these 10 days, Mo Yurou will no longer exist in the modeling industry.\"\"One more thing. The organizing committee has invited you to be a guest presenter on the night.\"\"OK Long Jie, I will be dropping by the office in a bit.\" Since she had decided to take on the TQ contract, according to the supplementary contract, she would have to present it to the higher-ups at Tianyi. However, she had a bad feeling the higher-ups would reject this job.\"In that case, I'll come pick you up now. Mo Yurou is currently at the office; she's turned back into a crab - walking sideways all over the company (Translator's note: in Chinese, they often call people crabs that walk sideways when they do what they want, like they own the place).\"Tangning laughed in disapproval.Half an hour later, Long Jie arrived at Hyatt Regency with a car. Upon seeing Tangning's refreshed expression, she couldn't help but tease her, \"The big president has been serving you well, it seems...\"\"Be serious,\" Tangning couldn't help her cheeks from blushing red.\"Oh yeah, now that Lin Wei has gone, Tianyi must want to organize a new manager for you, what do you plan on doing about this?\"\"I don't need a manager,\" Tangning shook her head. \"I can discuss my own contracts and you can sit by my side and give me your opinion.\"\"Are you sure you will do it yourself?\" Long Jie was doubtful; even if Tangning was willing, there was no way Mo Ting would allow her.\"I can't hide anything from you...Ting is helping me out...\" Tangning had no choice but to reveal the truth.\"Wow! Big Boss' abilities are super impressive. Let me tell you Tangning, you are not using him to his full potential.\"The two chatted and laughed as they entered Tianyi. However, the office's vibe was a bit different today.Tangning wanted to see Han Yufan, but Han Yufan's secretary told Tangning he was currently in a meeting. However, when Long Jie went to have a look, there was obviously no one in the meeting room. Whereas, a woman's laughter could be heard coming from Han Yufan's room.Tangning sneered, but she didn't want to make things difficult for the secretary.It seemed, Han Yufan and the others were inside celebrating; not wanting to see her...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Originally, she had already given up on Mo Yurou, but who would have thought, while swords were drawn between Tianyi and Tangning, she managed to turn the tables; qualifying for the Top Ten Model Awards and becoming an award winner.\"Congratulations Yurou! As you are one of the award winners, you have also been invited to the 'Model Elections Bright Night Gala'. There will be famous artists from all different companies attending and plenty of fashion resources; you need to make the most of this opportunity. There are also rumors going around that there will be a special guest on the night. Of course, Tangning is also invited...but...\" Han Ruoxue held up Tangning's invitation letter in front of Han Yufan and Mo Yurou and tore it in half, \"...she shouldn't dream of going.\"\"Jie, do you think this is a good idea?\" Han Yufan was sitting on the table. He laughed mockingly at Tangning.\"I don't know anything...On the night of the ball, if the organizers ask, we will just say Tangning is putting on a front and deliberately didn't show up. She was only Tianyi's guard dog once, even if she transforms from a low-class breed to a high-class one, she is still - just a dog,\" Han Ruoxue looked at the two firmly and sinisterly. Needless to say, even though Tangning didn't allow them to interfere with her jobs, it didn't mean they couldn't scheme against her in other ways. After all, she still belonged to the company and organizers of events would always contact the company; not the artist directly.After Han Ruoxue left the room with a victorious expression, silence fell between Han Yufan and Mo Yurou. Finally, Han Yufan spoke up, \"Yurou, don't you think the judges of the Top Ten Model Awards are a bit strange?\"Mo Yurou froze as an uneasy look swept across her face. Holding back her uneasiness, she replied, \"Did Tangning say something to you?\"\"Don't throw the focus onto Tangning everytime something happens to you. All I'm asking is, did you do anything behind the scenes with the judges?\" Han Yufan looked at Mo Yurou with a disheartened expression. He lifted her jaw and looked straight into her eyes, \"The darkness in this industry, do you think I'm not more familiar with it than you? For you...I almost involved my mother. If you betray me...then our relationship - is over.\"\"Yufan, I'm also surprised I got an award,\" Mo Yurou forced herself to remain calm and act like she normally did.\"Don't let me find out you've done something dirty. For you, I've gotten to this point with Tangning; don't you dare stab me in the back.\"\"I still have your child in my stomach, as if I would do anything reckless.\"The child was Mo Yurou's ultimate guarantee. Han Yufan analyzed Mo Yurou for a while. In the end, he decided to trust her, \"Fine, fine, I trust you.\"If God wanted to destroy a person, he would first make them do crazy things, and right now, Mo Yurou was amongst this craziness...She had no idea she was playing with fire. All she was dreaming about was...standing on the awards stage.As Mo Yurou was notified to receive an award, changes were made to Tianyi's upcoming jobs. Han Yufan gathered all the company's higher-ups for a meeting. He told them about the incident where Tangning threatened Han Ruoxue with canceling her contract; he wanted them to give up on Tangning and focus on Mo Yurou, as well as support newcomers. Upon finding out Tangning would leave sooner or later, the higher-ups had no choice but to accept Han Yufan's suggestion.At this time, Tangning was still shooting the ISN commercial. After work was done, Long Jie quickly approached her with a jacket and covered her up, \"Now your work is done, do you want to return to Tianyi to discuss the TQ contract with him?\"\"Let's not talk about TQ for now,\" Tangning replied. She was certain, now that Mo Yurou was to receive an award, there was no way Tianyi would be lenient towards her. At the same time, Tianyi's higher-ups were focused on profits; TQ posed too much of a risk. If she was to present it now, it would definitely be rejected straight away.\"Tangning, during this time, you have to be careful. Han Ruoxue and the other two are now working together to go against you; it's hard to tell what they would do behind your back.\" Long Jie helped her remove her makeup and change into her own clothing. She then escorted her out of the studio as she interacted with the fans waiting outside.\"I just need to stay out of their way before the awards ceremony...\" Tangning smiled.\"Should we find evidence of Mo Yurou bribing the judges?\"\"Long Jie, it's not beneficial for us to offend the judges. It's probably what Mo Yurou wants us to do, as it's so easy to burn ourselves by doing that. Let's not risk it. We already have her life and death in our hands, we don't need to do anything extra,\" Tangning had thought everything over carefully. Since Mo Yurou was brave enough to do something like this, she was definitely prepared.She was even brave enough to betray Han Yufan...What else wouldn't she do?They would let her go ahead and receive the award, there was no need to stop her. After all...in the end, she would still...fall down into the depths of the abyss.\"Where should we go now?\"\"To Hai Rui...let's pick Mo Ting up from work,\" Tangning lifted her twinkling eyes. Since she had finished work now, all she wanted to do was be a wife.Long Jie smiled slightly; the relationship between Tangning and Big Boss were improving day by day and she couldn't help but feel happy for her.5pm. The entire Beijing was still busy at work. Tangning arrived at the cafe opposite Hai Rui Entertainment and sat herself down as she sent Mo Ting a message, \"After work, please go directly to the hotel opposite your building. I want to share a dinner with President Mo.\"Mo Ting just finished an extremely long meeting. Upon seeing Tangning's message, he immediately replied, \"Do you want to come keep me company at the office?\"\"If I come, it will grab everyone's attention, it's best if I don't.\" Tangning actually wanted to go; she wanted to see how grand the office of the entertainment industry's Big Boss was.\"Come to the basement carpark, I will get Lu Che to bring you up through the secret entry.\" If Hai Rui didn't have arrangements for confidentiality, how could they be known as an entertainment empire?\"In that case, wait for me.\" After typing, Tangning wrapped herself up and headed to the basement carpark with Long Jie; Lu Che was already waiting. He escorted her through the secret entry straight up to the 42nd floor - The CEO's Office.\"Madam, as long as you want to come, just let the president know and I will come down to get you. At Hai Rui, you don't need to worry about confidentiality,\" Lu Che explained, \"All the staff in the company have already signed an agreement; if any gossip is spread through the company, they will have to compensate 1 billion dollars for breaching their contracts. So, even if they see anything, you don't need to worry about them saying anything...\"As expected, Mo Ting had his own way of ruling his empire...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trial Marriage Husband: Need to Work HardCH 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs the lift went directly to Mo Ting's office, Tangning didn't need to worry about running into any of the staff in Hai Rui. As soon as she stepped out of the lift, she saw Mo Ting's huge office; Tangning was relieved.The office was styled very differently to the Spanish-palace-look they had at home. Mo Ting's office was minimalist with angular metal furnishing; this showed his efficient, concise and dignified approach to work, making those that entered the room to subconsciously feel a sense of respect.At present, the man behind the office table was focused on signing the documents before him. The mole on his right earlobe made him appear reliable yet seductive; so they say, 'men are the most attractive when they are serious'. Tangning stood in the distance in a daze...until Mo Ting lifted his head and noticed her standing there...\"Go take a seat on the sofa for a bit,\" Mo Ting said gently as he instructed Lu Che, \"Go prepare some English black tea and pastries. Also, grab a blanket on the way.\"\"Yes, president.\"Tangning watched as Mo Ting quickly signed all the documents and walked to sit beside her, \"Why didn't you bring Long Jie up?\"\"She said she didn't want to be a lightbulb.\"Lu Che entered the office with the pastries and handed a blanket to Mo Ting. Mo Ting immediately covered Tangning's legs with the blanket, \"The air conditioner is a bit strong.\"Tangning smiled before reaching out her hands to nudge Mo Ting, \"Go do your work, don't disturb me from enjoying the beautiful scenery.\"\"Beautiful scenery?\"\"The sight of you working...\"Mo Ting had no choice but to stand up and return to his table to continue working. Meanwhile, Tangning resisted her tiredness for a while before leaning against the sofa and falling asleep. Mo Ting got up to reposition her body horizontally on the sofa, placing a pillow under her head and covering her with a blanket. She actually wanted to keep him company even though she was so tired from work...People went in and out of Mo Ting's office. Not only Lu Che, but also his secretary and a few company higher-ups. Every person that entered, would have a different expression as they walked out.As they entered, they were calm. But upon exiting, they were so surprised their eyes almost popped out of their heads.The Big Boss is taken!Who was the beautiful woman in the Big Boss' office?There's actually a person that is bold enough to fall asleep in the boss' office!The way that Big Boss looks at that beauty is gentle like water!My God! This is big news!However, after leaving the office, as they weren't allowed to gossip, each person felt like they were going to explode. How amazing would this woman have to be to get the Big Boss' affection? Could she be a current famous superstar?Tangning was resting peacefully; she slept well. She had no idea, she had already put Hai Rui into a frenzy.8pm. Mo Ting finally finished his work and carried Tangning in his arms out of the building into his Rolls Royce. Because of the noise outside, Tangning finally awoke. She opened her eyes and gazed at Mo Ting gently, \"You've finished work?\"\"What would you like to eat?\" Mo Ting started the engine as he gently asked her.\"You decide,\" Tangning tilted her head and wrapped her arm around Mo Ting's right arm as she continued to nap.The sports car drove out of the basement carpark. At the same time, behind them, Hai Rui's curious onlookers were gathered around. Although they couldn't gossip, they wanted to at least have a look; it didn't matter if they couldn't see clearly. Who was this woman that was affectionate with Mo Ting...Mo Ting did not take Tangning to a restaurant, instead, he decided to cook and prepare a feast for the two of them. Tangning watched Mo Ting's busy figure. She couldn't help but approach him from behind and give him a hug, \"How could you be so good to me...\"\"You are so easy to take care of...just a simple dinner and you are already touched...\"Tangning did not respond, instead, her hands wandered into Mo Ting's shirt and caressed his chest muscles, \"Mr. Mo, I'm hungry...\"\"The food is on its way.\"\"But, I want to eat you up.\"Mo Ting stopped what he was doing. Without saying a word, he turned around and carried Tangning horizontally in his arms, out of the kitchen. What his wife requested, he, of course, had to immediately fulfill...Late at night. The news was covering the Bright Night Gala that was to take place in 3 days time. After glancing at it quickly, Mo Ting lowered his head to question Tangning who was in his embrace, \"The Bright Night Gala, I've looked at the guest list. Both you and Mo Yurou are invited.\"\"Bright Night Gala?\" Tangning lifted her head confusedly.\"Seems like Tianyi hasn't told you about it, and probably doesn't intend to...\" seeing Tangning's reaction, Mo Ting's voice lowered.The Annual Model Awards was one of the biggest events of the year. The Top Ten Model Awards was only a part of it. The most important thing was the awards, which would definitely be taken home by some of the most famous models. Amongst them, 80% were awarded to models from Hai Rui and Star King.Tangning straightened her body; she felt a little tense.Mo Ting noticed her reaction and quickly stroked her hair as he gently comforted her, \"Let's pretend you don't know about it. Let them think you won't attend. On the day, I will send someone to escort you down the red carpet. Ning, you have already considered all possibilities, don't let this upset you...\"Tangning slowly calmed down as she gently nodded her head, \"If not for you, I would probably be tricked again!\"\"But there is no 'if', you indeed have me.\"Tangning tightly wrapped her arms around Mo Ting's waist; he was her safest harbor in the world...The next morning. As discussed, Tangning indeed pretended she didn't know a thing as she entered Tianyi with Long Jie. Inside his office, Han Yufan was in an extremely good mood. After their multiple battles with Tangning, they had finally learned to hide their true intentions. So, in front of her they no longer flaunted or showed off - they simply pretended nothing happened.\"After the collaboration with ISN, are you going to continue working? There have been many magazines and endorsement offers for you, have you made a decision?\"\"I want to work with TQ,\" Tangning placed TQ's collaboration plan in front of Han Yufan.Han Yufan was surprised for a moment; he did not understand why Tangning would pick TQ. Although this was a high-end magazine, in terms of sales and reputation, it did not compare to other magazines. Why did she insist on picking this one?\"Are you sure?\" Han Yufan completely did not understand what Tangning was thinking. She had just taken a step towards success, but instead of riding the wave to increase her exposure, she chose something out of the ordinary and selected a path that no one else was confident about. \"I am sure...\" Tangning nodded. \"Mo Yurou will be receiving an award, I believe you will be using all your resources to support her. There is no reason for you to interfere with what I want to do, right?\"\"Are you afraid the higher-ups will reject it?\" Han Yufan asked coldly. \"Tangning, you think too highly of yourself. If you want to do it, then do it. As for the higher-ups, I will convince them. However, you need to be aware of the dangerous choice you have made.\"\"I am completely aware...\" After speaking, Tangning stood up. She had nothing else to speak to Han Yufan about.\"Tangning, you must be desperate to destroy yourself. Are you really going to make our wish come true?\"After hearing this, Tangning's footsteps stopped for a moment.\"I think you should care about you and Mo Yurou first...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don't tell me you want to be covered in wounds,\" Han Yufan said anxiously to Tangning's back, \"Turn back, stop seeking revenge.\"Tangning kept walking. The words that were coming out of Han Yufan's mouth sounded funny and ridiculous after all the hurtful things he had already done to her.As she was walking out, Tangning turned her head and subconsciously looked at the bin in Han Yufan's room. The invite that belonged to her, still sat in the bin - torn to pieces.Revenge?\"Han Yufan, all I want is fairness; I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. Have you ever been fair to me?\"Han Yufan's reaction was slow as he tried to follow Tangning's gaze. However, Tangning had already turned around and all he could see now was the back of her head.Han Yufan wondered whether Tangning already knew about the Bright Night Gala.After leaving Han Yufan's room, Tangning headed for Tianyi's main entrance. However, Mo Yurou couldn't help but parade herself proudly around the building as she stopped Tangning at the entrance. She gave a proud and provoking look, \"Isn't this Beijing's New Upcoming Model, Tangning? She is so popular these days.\"\"Move,\" Tangning said calmly.\"I've received an invitation from the Bright Night Gala, what about you? Miss New Upcoming Model...\" Mo Yurou placed her head on Tangning's shoulder as she spoke mockingly, \"So what if you shot the Oriental Trend? In the end, aren't you still unwelcome in the modeling world? I'm sure you understand how important the Bright Night Gala is to a model.\"Mo Yurou pulled out her invitation and flaunted it in front of Tangning, \"I have it...but you don't. Oh, that's right, not only do you not have an invitation, you don't even have a manager, who's going to discuss your contracts?\"Tangning's face remained calm as she stood in place allowing Mo Yurou to be as arrogant as she wanted. After Mo Yurou finally stopped talking, Tangning revealed a slight smile as she used a voice that could only be heard between the two of them, \"The judge's bed...is it softer than Han Yufan's?\"Mo Yurou froze.\"The Bright Night Gala and whether anyone is discussing my contracts for me isn't something you should worry about. You better focus on applying more perfume, to cover up the smell on your body...the smell of cheating is so strong. How long do you think Han Yufan will remain blind to it?\"After speaking, Tangning watched as a look of guilt crossed Mo Yurou's eyes. Afterwards, she let out a laugh as she pushed Mo Yurou out of the way and walked out of Tianyi, leaving Mo Yurou standing all alone cursing.Mo Yurou's professionalism had remained stagnant for a long time because she spent too much time scheming against others and caring about her own pride. She also spent too much time flirting with Han Yufan. Otherwise, after 4-5 years in the industry, how could she still be a B-Grade model and not someone already at the top of their game.After exiting Tianyi, Long Jie was waiting for her in the car with a mysterious smile. Tangning looked at her curiously as she let out a laugh, \"What is it?\"\"I'll take you somewhere.\" After speaking, Long Jie started the car and drove Tangning to Beijing's most expensive downtown area and led her into one of the most expensive branded stores.\"Why did you bring me here?\" Tangning looked at the open display afraid she would be seen by fans.\"Buying your battle gear...\"A deep voice, not Long Jie's, resounded from the VIP area. It was Mo Ting, who had been waiting for a while. He was wearing a dark blue suit which wrapped around his alluring body. He took confident and poised steps towards her with a bold and seductive smile; he looked like an emperor from a painting.\"Ting...\"\"The Bright Night Gala, Tianyi does not want you to attend, but I intend on making you the center of attention,\" Mo Ting walked around and hugged her from behind to draw attention to her perfect curves. She owned a pair of beautiful slender legs, that even the gods would be envious of.Long Jie knowingly retreated from the store, allowing the couple to be affectionate. Tangning could feel the warmth from his body as she asked, \"Aren't you busy at work?\"\"No matter how busy I am, I can't forget to care about you...\" Mo Ting whispered into Tangning's ear as he gently rubbed her earlobe between his lips, \"Did I tell you...I am the Bright Night Gala's special guest?\"Tangning was stunned for a moment before calming down again. Hai Rui won so many awards, of course Mo Ting would attend.\"This will be the first time since we got married, that we will share a stage. The show with hf doesn't count, so this opportunity is very important to me.\"\"The reason I brought you to this particular store, is because they have a high degree of confidentiality. Also, they have just released a series of couple designs. In the entire world, there is only one of each.\"After hearing this, Tangning finally understood Mo Ting's intention. He wanted them to wear clothes from the same series and wear matching jewelry that only they knew about. Even though they couldn't announce their relationship......he wanted her to know: no matter what position he was in and where he was, in the end, they were husband and wife......and she was the only person that could be by his side.Even if people couldn't tell their clothes were from the same series, knowing the logo inside was the same......Tangning felt safe and warm. Most importantly, it symbolized they were in this together.\"From the sounds of it, you've already selected something?\" Tangning's heart felt warm; she was surprised that Mo Ting's thoughtfulness would go to this extent. She had no doubt Mo Ting already prepared everything.\"Follow me,\" Mo Ting grabbed her hand and pulled her towards the change room. Behind the partition, she could see the dress on the mannequin's body; her eye's looked stunned.\"Go try it on.\"Tangning held back the burn in her throat as she entered the change room. Her hands trembled as she removed the dress from the mannequin. She had been a model for so many years and worn so many clothes, yet...this was the first time a piece of clothing had ever made her feel like crying.This was a champagne colored mermaid dress with transparent shoulders. The cutting was just right, making Tangning's body look even more slender and perfect. The body of the dress didn't use the usual crystals, instead, it was embellished in bright and elegant pearls. On her body, it appeared soft and graceful; she looked like she had come straight out of a painting.Tangning stood speechless in front of the huge mirror; her heart pounded harder and harder......until Mo Ting changed into his suit and stepped out behind her.At this moment, Mo Ting was wearing a grey retro handmade suit with a leopard-print tie. Out of his front pocket sat a matching handkerchief; he looked poised like an English gentleman. In fact, he looked even more calm and confident than an aristocrat.Tangning looked at the couple in the mirror as she grabbed onto Mo Ting's hand, \"We look like the perfect couple, what should we do if someone figures it out?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, deep down he understood, according to her current status in the industry, Tangning still had a long way to go before she was on the same level as him. Even top superstars found, the closest they could get to Mo Ting was a simple tinkering of wine glasses; everyone in the industry knew, he did not like people that rode on other's coattails.As for announcing their marriage, he could do it anytime, but he had promised Tangning he would give her time to prove herself; he would wait until the day they were on the same level. He gently stroked Tangning's hair; the palm of his hands emitted a sense of encouragement. He believed Tangning had the ability to climb to the top, so he didn't want her to spend the rest of her life merely being a pretty face by his side.\"I forgot to tell you, TQ magazine's front cover has been finalized.\"Tangning looked up sweetly and teased, \"The people from TQ must have no idea they were chatting to the infamous President Mo.\"\"I also had a rare experience of the joys of being a small assistant. Most importantly, I have invited the editor of TQ to escort you down the red carpet and protect you.\"Escort and protect...After hearing this, Tangning turned around and wrapped her arm around Mo Ting's neck. Her eyes contained a touch of warmth, \"You've given me so much, what can I do for you in return? Everything I have, you have...and everything I don't have, you already have the ability to obtain.\"Mo Ting gently returned her embrace and answered her in a simple manner, \"All I need is you...\"Tangning buried her head into Mo Ting's shoulder as tears flowed from her eyes. Mo Ting helplessly patted her back; he realized the woman in his embrace was so easily touched and satisfied....The next day, Tangning met up with the photographer sent from the US by Mina and started work on the front cover of Secret's October Issue. Afterwards, all she had left to do with ISN was a stage event. Whereas, TQ's front cover, was to be shot after the Bright Night Gala.Regarding the Bright Night Gala, Tianyi handled it with a low-profile. After all, there were so many big shots and superstars attending, they had to remain modest; unlike last time when Mo Yurou shamelessly compared herself to someone famous. Above all, they didn't want Tangning to pick up on any clues. So this time around, they decided not to speak about it openly...\"If it wasn't because you broke up with Tangning, according to her current fame and popularity, it wouldn't be hard to make her into an international supermodel. As a result, Tianyi would also go up in value. However, look what happened now,\" Han Ruoxue looked at the comments about Tangning online. Fans were contacting Tianyi through all different methods, asking them about Tangning's current state; Han Ruoxue honestly felt it was a waste.Worst of all, Tangning was always up against Tianyi......and always seemed to get in the way.\"Jie, I have a plan. After the awards ceremony, Yurou will be going overseas to study. When that time comes, I'm not sure how long Tangning will stick around. So, I want to train a newcomer. Let's look for someone that resembles Tangning and we will utilize her fame to debut our newcomer. After all, Tangning is already 26 years old, whereas the newcomer we find will have unlimited possibilities...\"Han Ruoxue looked at Han Yufan; she suddenly realized her younger brother still had some use. At least at this important moment, he managed to suggest something useful.\"In that case, I'll instruct my staff to prepare a newcomer,\" Han Ruxue responded. \"Since Tangning is still one of our models, we should make use of her.\"\"Definitely...\"\"Tomorrow will be the Bright Night Gala, hopefully, nothing goes wrong. According to Tangning's current status, if she was to appear at the event, she will definitely gain even more fans. That will definitely be unfavorable for us,\" Han Ruoxue's eyes looked full of schemes. \"Tangning, is indeed hard to control.\"Han Yufan didn't know how to respond. But, to be exact, the thing he really didn't know, was the true Tangning.After all, in the past few years, to him, Tangning appeared to be like a sheep that allowed others to tell her what to do. On top of that, everything she did, revolved around him. But, he noticed...ever since the relationship between him and Mo Yurou was revealed...Tangning was no longer the same Tangning.\"Jie, I'm still not sure. I need to ask Long Jie about Tangning's schedule tomorrow night and make sure she won't make an appearance at the Bright Night Gala.\"Han Yufan couldn't stop thinking about the words Tangning had said the previous day...words that seemed to have a hidden meaning...He wasn't certain if Tangning knew they had torn her invitation.\"Ring her then,\" Han Ruoxue nodded.Han Yufan pulled out his phone and dialed a number he hadn't dialed for a long time, it was Long Jie's number, \"What does Tangning have planned for tomorrow night?\"\"She will be shooting Secret's October front cover,\" Long Jie responded calmly. \"As she needs to shoot a night scene, the shoot will take place at 8pm. What's wrong?\"\"Nothing. Take good care of her in case she is affected by not being invited to the Bright Night Gala.\"Hearing these words through the phone, Long Jie felt disgusted. It was obvious he wanted to know Tangning's whereabouts tomorrow night, yet he pretended he cared about her.So fake...\"What did Han Yufan say?\"At this moment, Tangning was currently applying her makeup in the waiting room as Secret's shoot had already begun. As Mina was aware of Tangning's situation, she instructed her team to cooperate accordingly and make sure to help Tangning.\"He's asking what you are doing tomorrow night,\" Long Jie put away her phone and smiled. \"Tangning, from what I see, the jerks are extremely cautious of you...ha ha...so, they would never imagine, you won't be simply attending tomorrow night, you'll even be attending with TQ's editor.\"Everyone knew, although TQ wasn't a best-selling magazine, it was still a high-end magazine. As for the founder, Lin Weisen, he was born into a finance family; he had a rich financial background. So, he didn't rely on the magazine to make money, he was in the entertainment industry simply because he enjoyed it.\"Tangning, tomorrow night, you will definitely grab everyone's attention.\"Tangning didn't tell Long Jie, Mo Ting was the Bright Night Gala's special guest; she wanted to give Long Jie a surprise. Tomorrow night...she not only wanted to destroy Han Yufan and the other's dreams, she also thought of it as the perfect opportunity for her to gather extra fashion resources.Meanwhile, at this time, Mo Yurou was carefully making preparations. She knew the event would determine whether she could make a comeback.She had already decided, if she managed to secure extra connections and resources after the awards ceremony, then her child...she would abort it. If she was to give birth to Han Yufan's child, it would waste at least 8 months of her life. What would she get out of it?Love? Compared to fame and fortune, this word was worth nothing...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As a safety net, organize someone to keep her busy; only then will I be rest assured.\"\"Don't worry, I know what to do,\" her assistant's words seemed to hide a deeper meaning; when it came to bullying Tangning, he was well experienced. After all, Tangning had previously been Mo Yurou's substitute and he had secretly caused a lot of trouble for her.\"While you're at it, help me contact the hospital in secret. After the awards ceremony is over, I am going to go get rid of this child...\"Even though he knew her dream in life was to chase fame, after hearing Mo Yurou's plan, her assistant still felt, giving up on her own child was taking things a step too far. At the same time, he was worried, if Han Yufan was to find out, what would be the consequences for Mo Yurou?Look at Tangning and how much effort she put in to get to where she is today.Even though her assistant didn't say it, inside he knew, if Mo Yurou was to go against Han Yufan, there was no way she would be able to follow in the footsteps of Tangning. No matter if it was professionalism or people skills - Tangning was well ahead of Mo Yurou.Of course, Mo Yurou did not think this way......The next morning. Tianyi Entertainment, CEO's office.Han Ruoxue had always been a woman of action: only yesterday, they were discussing finding a newcomer and straight away she started considering suitable candidates. So, early in the morning, she sent someone to go pick them up - there were a total of three girls.They were all roughly 16 years old, tall with long legs, young, beautiful and vibrant.Han Ruoxue looked at the three girls as she sat on Han Yufan's table. She lifted her eyebrows and asked, \"What do you think? I happened to come across a model search competition; this here is Lan Yu, she is at least 70% similar to Tangning.\"Han Yufan looked at the three girls and took particular notice of the tallest one in the middle. On the outside, she indeed looked similar to Tangning; especially her nose, that was tall and straight. However, her temperament was incomparable.\"I know, compared to Tangning she is still miles apart, but she is young, whereas Tangning is already 26 years old. How much success do you think Tangning can achieve at her age? Look at her right now; how much energy has she wasted just to get this far?\"\"Have you already done a background check?\" Han Yufan still had a lot of questions.\"Of course. Although Lan Yu's family isn't extremely rich, they are well educated; they aren't too bad.\" Han Ruoxue placed Lan Yu's information in front of Han Yufan.\"I am confident I can make Lan Yu appear on the biggest international runway.\"The siblings continued their heated discussion in the office, while Tangning stood outside listening to the whole conversation. She had dropped by the building because she had been asked to come pick up some gifts left by her fans. However, never would she have expected to find, her gifts had been torn open and thrown everywhere by the staff.A moment later, the office room opened; three beautiful young girls walked out. They all started sizing up Tangning with their eyes - especially the girl named Lan Yu.Tangning sneered inside. There were times when she couldn't help but admit, there was no limit to how sinister these siblings could be.\"Oh, it's you!\" Upon seeing Tangning, Han Ruoxue immediately looked disgusted.Tangning threw her torn up gifts in front of Han Ruoxue, \"After paying your compensation, were you so poor that you had to tear up my gifts?\"\"Tangning, watch your attitude,\" Han Ruoxue pointed at Tangning as she yelled. \"Even though you have a bit of fame now, you are still the company's artist, and I am the Artists Director. Plus, if a model hasn't been invited to the Bright Night Gala it means they aren't being acknowledged as part of the industry, so what right do you have to speak loudly to the company's higher-ups?\"\"Did I really...not get invited?\" Tangning looked at Han Ruoxue; her eyes were filled with ridicule and disdain.Han Yufan's heart skipped a beat; he was becoming more and more certain that Tangning knew what had happened......it was just that she was too good at enduring and too good at controlling her emotions; pretty much no one could tell what she was thinking.\"Of course not...\" Han Ruoxue replied in certainty. \"What? You can't accept the truth? Do you want to go as well? Too bad, you won't have the chance...\"\"Tangning, tonight just focus on your magazine shoot. Stop thinking about the Bright Night Gala. You don't want to be easily distracted,\" Han Yufan gripped onto the pen in his hand as he tried to convince Tangning. \"The Bright Night Gala definitely did not invite you, so stop wasting your time doing useless things.\"Tangning gently laughed; she wasn't angered by Han Ruoxue at all. In fact, just the thought of what was to happen soon...she was extremely amused.\"I will definitely play my part as a model, but, next time someone tears apart my gifts, they should expect a letter from my lawyer!\"\"I never thought, the daughter of a perfume empire would fancy a few simple gifts.\"\"The gifts are not the main issue...the main issue is, when it comes to Tianyi, I won't allow you to reap any benefits...\" After speaking, Tangning was ready to leave, but Han Yufan stopped her.\"Have you already finalized TQ's contract?\"\"Of course,\" Tangning responded.\"It's rumored TQ aren't easy to deal with, how did you manage to do it?\"\"You don't need to worry about that,\" Tangning's voice was calm and contained a sense of pride.After all...Mo Ting's abilities were beyond what Han Yufan could achieve in a lifetime.Han Yufan stopped responding because everything he said was to test Tangning, but looking at her back as it got smaller and smaller, he still could not figure what she was thinking.\"Jie, I suspect Tangning already knows about...the Bright Night Gala.\"After hearing this, Han Ruoxue paused for a moment before speaking, \"It doesn't matter if she knows or not; I will not allow her to appear at the scene. Yufan, keep her busy; I don't care if you make her shoot a magazine or anything else you can think of, we need to watch over her carefully. We can't allow anything to go wrong.\"\"Otherwise, we can only watch as her threat towards us grows stronger and stronger.\"\"Understood,\" Han Yufan responded sincerely, \"I will definitely not repeat the same mistakes.\"They couldn't allow Tangning to have the opportunity to scheme against Tianyi again!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Outside the venue lay a magnificently long red carpet and a signing wall.The scene was surrounded by excited reporters and fans; they were either holding phones, cameras or LED signs. The signs had the names of their idols on it and they flashed like stars in a vast night sky.In front of the signing wall, stood the smartly dressed event hosts, each holding a microphone, recording their opening speeches. It had been a long time since an event of this caliber had been hosted in Beijing and this event signified the start of a series of awards ceremonies.8pm. Superstars started arriving one by one. Amongst the loud screams, Han Yufan held onto Mo Yurou's hand accompanied by Han Ruoxue as they walked down the red carpet. No matter if it was the 'American Blacklisted Han Ruoxue' or the 'Mo Yurou who had an affair with Han Yufan', Tianyi was a popular topic of discussion.But, Tangning was missing!The Tangning that was riding the popularity of the Oriental Trend.The Tangning that had defeated Mo Yurou in an instant and made her have zero mentions.The Tangning that was announced as ISN's first Asian spokesperson.She did not attend!The hosts were confused; they were sure Tangning's name was on the invite list.\"Walking up the red carpet right now, we have the CEO of Tianyi Entertainment, Han Yufan; the famed model, Mo Yurou and the extremely skillful Han Ruoxue.\"\"Please come on stage so we can give you a short interview,\" the hosts invited them onto the stage and immediately took the opportunity to ask them a sensitive question, \"May we ask why Tangning...isn't here today?\"\"Or have President Han and Tangning decided to arrive separately?\"Han Yufan furrowed his eyebrows, ready to respond, however, Han Ruoxue stepped in first and replied, \"We notified Tangning, but maybe because of a lack of communication lately, she hasn't been able to tell you that she has decided not to appear at the Bright Night Gala. Tianyi also wishes, from now on, no matter her decision, she can notify us earlier.\"After hearing Han Ruoxue's reply, the hosts could tell Tangning and Tianyi were at odds. Especially with the tone Han Ruoxue used when she spoke about Tangning not attending, she seemed to be accusing Tangning of being arrogant and selfish because of her popularity.\"I think Tangning might just be unwell, it's OK, we are looking forward to the next gathering!\" One of the hosts tried his best to smooth out the situation.But it was obvious to anyone with eyes what Tianyi's true motive was behind accusing Tangning. Judging by the previous incidents, if they were to choose someone to trust between Tianyi and Tangning, the two hosts would not hesitate to choose Tangning.Han Yufan's betrayal, Mo Yurou's pressuring and Tianyi's multiple methods of suppression did not crush this woman. So, it wasn't easy for Tangning to stay strong and get to where she was today. Most impressive of all, she was extremely easy going and kept a low profile.Gazing out at the crowd, signs with Tangning's name could be seen. Upon hearing Han Ruoxue's words, they were tempted to run up on stage and tear her mouth out.They were sure they knew what type of person Tangning was...The Tangning that had received so much suppression, yet assured them to wait for her patiently, had always been grateful for everything she had; there was no way she wouldn't attend the Bright Night Gala.Tianyi is defaming Tangning; Han Ruoxue should die!\"You are lying...Tianyi is lying!\" a fan who couldn't restrain himself screamed out. However, because the scene was so noisy, his voice was lost amongst the crowd.\"All I can say is, we can't do anything about her!\" Han Ruoxue knew the host was trying to save the situation, but she insisted on causing trouble; defaming Tangning was her aim for coming to this event.The hosts smiled awkwardly as they got ready to invite the trio to sign the wall, but...at that moment, a Lincoln Limousine pulled up at the head of the red carpet. The person that got out of the car was the editor of TQ...Mr. Lin Weisen. Most importantly, he wasn't alone...This was the first time he attended an event with someone!Everyone watched as he walked around the front of the car to the other side and opened the door. Afterwards, he could be seen helping a woman out like a gentleman...Onlookers looked carefully and noticed, the beautiful woman was...Tangning!The Tangning that had supposedly said she wouldn't make an appearance, had a warm smile on her face as she hooked her arm on Lin Weisen's arm and walked down the red carpet. Tangning's fans immediately started cheering.She had arrived...Tangning had arrived.Hearing the cheers, Han Yufan subconsciously turned to see what all the commotion was about. When Tangning appeared in front of the trio, Han Ruoxue's face turned pale...it was not a good look.Didn't they agree to watch over her? How come she was here?Upon seeing Tangning, the two hosts lit up in excitement because this meant, Han Ruoxue's plan had gone down the drain.They quickly invited Tangning and TQ's editor in front of the signing wall and stood her next to the trio.\"Tangning, you are so beautiful today...\"\"Thank you,\" Tangning humbly clasped her hands together and bowed thankfully to the hosts and her fans. This action made everyone present like her even more.\"Just now we were questioning President Han. We were asking why you didn't attend such a big event with them. So it turns out you were with Mr. Lin...I was wondering how the Bright Night Gala could not include you.\"\"But, Tangning is attending as my accompanying guest, the organizer's never sent her an invite...\" Lin Weisen said directly to the hosts.These words couldn't come from Tangning, but it was OK to come from Lin Weisen because he was well known for being straightforward. As soon as he spoke, the hosts were stunned as they fought to give an explanation, \"Mr. Lin, there must be a misunderstanding, Tangning is definitely on our invite list. The invite was sent to her agency...\"As soon as the word 'agency' left his mouth, the host realized where things must have gone wrong.Tianyi Entertainment!Tianyi Entertainment must have hidden her invite.As an agency, how could they treat their artist so shamefully? Fans on the scene all glared at the trio...Shameless!To think, just a moment ago Han Ruoxue was trying to push the blame onto Tangning.\"Tangning is a model that I have high hopes for. Because of Tianyi's actions, I will now officially announce, I will use all my resources to pave a new path for Tangning. I could even open up a studio for her,\" Lin Weisen announced; his announcement was like a huge slap to Han Ruoxue's face.Tangning simply smiled the entire time...She wanted to know, with Han Yufan using Tianyi's name so many times, whether he was trying to ruin his own reputation.Most importantly, the incident with the invitation allowed everyone to see Tianyi's true motive. It seemed since they couldn't keep Tangning, they were going to do all they could to defame her...Unfortunately for them, not only did things not go to plan, everything ended up backfiring.\"Distinguished guests, please head in...not only is the atmosphere exceptionally lively tonight, we are also expecting a special guest.\"The host couldn't allow the vibe to become stale even though they knew of Tianyi's wrongdoings. After all, in the end, they were guests that had officially been invited...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had received a huge blow and all she could do now was walk in with her tail between her legs; she wanted so bad to find a hole to hide in.Han Yufan looked at Tangning, his eyes contained a complex look, \"She must have already known we tore up her invitation, so no matter how well we prepared, her true intentions were well hidden while she watched our every move.\"\"As if she's that smart,\" Han Ruoxue continued to blame everything on Han Yufan's bad management. \"Just wait and see. Since we haven't been able to stop her today, it's going to be even harder to stop her in the future.\"Mo Yurou glanced at the siblings beside her, especially Han Ruoxue who claimed to be special. Her eyes flashed a moment of ridicule; Tangning wasn't too smart, everyone just underestimated her and let their guard down - including herself...But, no matter how hard Tangning tried to climb up, it didn't matter. Since Mo Yurou managed to secure a Top Ten Model Award, she was confident she would be able to beat Tangning.The trio caused such a commotion before entering the venue that word of them failing to suppress Tangning quickly spread to the ears of everyone present. Han Yufan looked at the ridiculing gazes of the guests as he tried hard to hold back his anger. They soon found their seats. According to their status in the industry, they were seated towards the back; temporarily hidden from sight, giving them a bit of relief. However, what they didn't expect was that Tangning would be seated two rows from the front.On her left sat TQ's editor and on her right sat one of the judges of the Top Ten Model Awards. This judge just so happened to be the man that slept with Mo Yurou.Why is Tangning always so lucky?Although Tangning wasn't familiar with the man, Mo Yurou still felt uneasy - because she felt guilty.\"Yurou, what's wrong? Your palms are sweaty.\"\"Nothing's wrong, I'm just a bit nervous,\" Mo Yurou brushed Han Yufan off with a smile.The Bright Night Gala was like the opening ceremony for the annual awards ceremonies, so many celebrities were gathered. As many people in the entertainment industry loved fashion, there were a large number of attendees.Tangning was concentrated on the stage as the hosts gave their opening speeches. However, the judge sitting to her right was mesmerized by her legs; Mr. Li was well known for being sleazy, hence why Mo Yurou managed to get her way with him.Worst of all, not only did he merely look at Tangning's legs, he even turned to her and said, \"Miss Tang, you are so beautiful. I saw a recent article about you and found that you are extremely professional; I have high hopes for you.\"After hearing him speak, Tangning could sense he was hinting something else to her. She decided to respond politely, \"Thank you for your praise.\"Upon seeing the judge inching closer and closer to Tangning, TQ's editor patted her on the shoulder and requested, \"Take my seat, I have something I want to ask Mr. Li.\"Tangning understood that Lin Weisen was trying to help her out of this sticky situation and quickly gave him a grateful smile before swapping seats with him.To Lin Weisen, Tangning was an extremely professional model with a promising future, so he didn't want any negative news to arise about her.Seeing Tangning unwilling to play along, the judge glared at her; they were obviously from the same company, but why was Mo Yurou so easy to bed, yet Tangning was so stuck-up? Wasn't she just a fallen outdated model that recently got back on her feet?Tangning continued to concentrate on the stage as she pretended to be unaware of what was happening. But deep down she knew, today she may have offended this judge...Mo Yurou watched from the back and focused on their movements; she noticed the old sleazebag had his eyes set on Tangning. If Tangning decided to follow the same path as her, then...wouldn't that mean she would have to be stepped all over by Tangning again?After all, who wouldn't choose a shortcut to success?Why did Tangning have to fight with her over everything?On the stage, the hosts were throwing out punchlines one after another making the audience roar in laughter. After the head of the organizing committee gave his speech, it signaled the launch ceremony had officially started and the special guest would be about to appear...Mo Ting...Mo Ting...Tangning chanted her husband's name in her heart. He was an untouchable superstar that everyone looked up to; in fact, he possessed a presence which even some of the most famous celebrities couldn't compare to. He was more attractive than anyone else, and tonight he would appear at the same event as his wife for the first time, even though......no one actually knew they were married.\"In a moment, the person that will be making an appearance...\"The host only started speaking, yet below the stage, the crowd was already cheering loudly. The host smiled waiting for everyone to quiet down, before continuing \"...he is more popular than any superstar or even famous celebrity. He is the CEO of Hai Rui Entertainment, Mo Ting!\"As soon as the host's words left his mouth, Mo Ting appeared from behind the stage. Under the spotlight, his sculpted body looked even more perfect and built. Most importantly, the presence he exuded was similar to that of a king; it was like he was born to stand intimidatingly where no one could reach...Mo Ting swept his gaze across the hall before spotting Tangning; their eyes met. Their feelings for each other were quickly expressed through their gaze, but it only lasted 2 seconds before Mo Ting quickly glanced away.\"President Mo, please speak,\" the host welcomed him to the stage.Mo Ting's eyes twinkled; the mole on his right earlobe was magnificent like obsidian, \"Hai Rui's door has always been open to winners.\"Mo Ting only said one simple sentence - one very simple sentence - and it was enough to tell everyone one honest truth: Hai Rui only accepted powerful artists. At the same time, he also gave Hai Rui's artist's an affirmation: they were the top of their game because behind them was Hai Rui Entertainment - an undefeated legend of the industry...Hearing these words, Tangning also understood, this was encouragement from Mo Ting. Only after she becomes the most powerful, would she be able to stand wherever she wanted.\"Ohhh...Our President Mo's suit color matches that of Tangning's.\" Tangning's dress was imprinted in the host's memory; especially since she was seated just below them on the right; a quick glance made the comparison even more obvious.So, after seeing Mo Ting wearing clothes in a similar color group, he couldn't help but point it out.Tangning did not expect her name to be called out. After being stunned for a few seconds, she quickly stood up and smiled, \"It is my honor.\"Everyone knew Mo Ting hated artists that rode on other's coattails, so they wondered whether Tangning's outfit meant she had deliberately inquired about Mo Ting's outfit to create hype?Those below the stage waited for Mo Ting's reaction and for Tangning to be humiliated...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just because she's slightly attractive, she thinks she can start scheming. Didn't anyone tell her our president hates people that ride on other's coattails? Especially those that use him to create hype? She's asking for it.\"\"Let's just sit back and watch the show...\"\"She's a nobody, but she sure is brave...\"Hushed whispers echoed from below the stage. Pretty much everyone present was waiting to see how Tangning would be humiliated and how pitiful she would end up being, while Han Yufan and the others couldn't help but cheer inside.If Tangning was to offend the CEO of Hai Rui, it would be equivalent to being blacklisted by the entire industry. This result would be better than anything they could do to suppress her - what a pleasant surprise.Meanwhile, standing on the stage, Mo Ting knew exactly what was going through everyone's minds. He knew they wanted to see Tangning get humiliated. But, unfortunately for them, this woman was his wife...How could he allow his wife to become a joke?So, he simply smiled and exclaimed in front of everyone, \"I hope this kind of coincidence happens more often, after all...Miss Tang is very beautiful.\"After hearing Mo Ting's words, everyone was shocked as they looked at each other in disbelief; he didn't say anything bad to her.His words were gentle and simple; full of politeness. It didn't contain any trace of ridicule. He was genuinely praising Tangning!It didn't take long for everyone to realize what Mo Ting meant. If Tangning had indeed contacted his assistant or others around him, Mo Ting would not have let her off easily. So it was obvious, all this was truly a coincidence - simply a beautiful coincidence.Meanwhile, Tangning did not appear to be sucking up or defensive. This gave her extra points and made everyone present find her very pleasing. Without trying to explain herself; she just simply smiled and sat back down elegantly, leaving a lasting impression.At first, everyone thought this incident was over, but Mo Ting suddenly spoke up, \"I remember Miss Tang's performance at The Crown's Star show in Yi Hai Centre. I hope you continue to work hard!\"These words completely stunned everyone. The video from the time he stuck up for her at the show was still being circulated online, so he couldn't deny he didn't know her. But the fact that he told her to work hard suggested to the public, Hai Rui did not give her any offers.......because Hai Rui only wanted the most powerful artists......but, it didn't mean she wouldn't receive any offers in the future. A model like her, that was so professional and conducted herself well, had a promising future. No one could predict how far she would go.All the fashion personalities looked at Tangning with fascination.Meanwhile, Tangning looked at Mo Ting helplessly. He had agreed not to interfere in her private matters, yet here he was doing all he could to boost her fame.Mo Ting also looked at Tangning. Today was a rare occasion for them to appear together, he didn't know when the next opportunity would be; so what was wrong with saying a few words for his wife? After all, it wasn't like he was going out of his way to help her, he merely said a few honest truths.The hosts adored Tangning, especially her non-competitive attitude. Plus, after witnessing how Tianyi treated her earlier, the female host gathered her courage and suggested, \"President Mo, since this coincidence has happened, why don't we close off with a happy ending...You should take a photo together?\"A photo together!The venue was in an uproar...This was Hai Rui's almighty king! Even those that had won best actress didn't dare to request such a thing. Did this host want to get fired?The male host sensed the atmosphere was a bit awkward so he prepared himself to step out and save the situation. However, at this moment, everyone was once again in awe as Mo Ting responded.\"I don't think I can refuse such a happy ending...\"\"Great, in that case, could we please ask Miss Tang onto the stage...\" The host immediately smiled happily as her voice echoed through the microphone to all corners of the building.Tangning looked around at the envious gazes. She quickly gathered up her courage; she knew no matter if she was to agree or not, in the end, people would still gossip about her. Since that was the case, why should she give up the chance to take a photo with Mo Ting?So, she calmly stood up and took composed steps towards the stage, not allowing anyone to see what she was thinking. Not long after, she approached Mo Ting's side looking elegant and poised...Looking at them, one was handsome and respectable, the other was gentle and elegant; they indeed matched each other well. However, no one suspected they had any relations, as they both appeared modest; all they did was nod at each other politely. Everyone present ended up being more focused on how Tangning was so lucky...Hmmph...just a small artist, yet she has the opportunity to take a photo with Mo Ting...she sure is lucky.Let's wait and see...this small artist will definitely take the opportunity to create hype tomorrow.\"Tangning, don't be shy, move a little closer...\"Hearing the host say this, Mo Ting stretched out his arm, placed his hand on Tangning's shoulder and pulled her towards him - the two were immediately so close together they were touching...Everyone's eyes were about to pop out. Tangning was also surprised by Mo Ting's actions as he looked down at her and said, \"We can't get any closer, or else when I get home I'll be forced to kneel on the scrubbing board*\"A surprised expression swept across everyone's faces...so Mo Ting already has a partner?He was indeed the low-profile and mysterious big brother of the entertainment industry; he sure knew how to keep things under wraps...Tangning maintained her smile as she wondered whether she should really make him kneel at least 5 minutes once they got home. Although everything that happened tonight was within Mo Ting's control, all this fluctuation of emotions was making it hard for her to handle.The two stood still for a photo and then quickly separated. Tangning politely shook Mo Ting's hand before being escorted back to her seat by one of the staff.After all that had unfolded, the judge that had previously flirted with Tangning, no longer dared to do anything to her. He now understood, this model......was not one he could mess with. Although she didn't appear to be competitive, in reality, she was someone that knew exactly what she wanted and what she should do to get there. On the other hand, only someone like Mo Yurou, who took shortcuts, would easily let him play around with her and do as he pleased.All that happened was just a small interlude. After taking their photo, Mo Ting also stepped off the stage and sat at his seat.As Mo Ting already had a partner......Han Ruoxue watched the scene unfold before her before sneering, \"Mo Ting hates it when people use his name to hype themselves up. The Tangning I know has no idea how to create hype, I guess tomorrow we will have to help her.\"Translators Notes:*Kneel on the scrubbing board (\u8dea\u6413\u8863\u677f) = An expression used to symbolize a man being punished by his wife. Or a man that is afraid of his wife.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Once again, Tangning destroyed all hopes Tianyi had of suppressing her. At the same time, at the launch ceremony, a small newcomer like herself that shouldn't have gotten much notice - because of Mo Ting and her own calm demeanor - ended up leaving a lasting impression on everyone. Amongst these people were leading professionals in the fashion industry including the CEO of Star Age who had previously given her an offer.Tangning......a model that Star Age had tried to poach multiple times. A model that had been blacklisted by Star King 3 years ago and ended up announcing a comeback 3 years later. Someone that had been schemingly suppressed, yet she managed to calmly get to where she was today; even being fortunate enough to take a photo with the CEO of Hai Rui...Because of all this, the CEO of Star Age, approached Han Yufan before the launch ceremony was over and said, \"I've been trying to poach Tangning for 3 years now, yet she's never accepted my offer even once. However, looking at how Tianyi has been treating her, I feel like I need to try again.\"Han Yufan looked at the tall, built and powerful man before him. Originally he was going to say this was a matter that concerned Tianyi themselves, but thinking about all the years Tangning had been with Tianyi and how she had not only been loyal to him, but also missed many opportunities, Han Yufan's mouth twitched a little but no words came out.\"When that time comes...don't regret it.\"Han Yufan was silent because the man before him had a more capable agency than his. At the same time, his mind was a mess, because he had never expected Tangning would ever leave Tianyi.It turned out, all along he had been too focused on himself: on one side he was cheating with Mo Yurou, on the other he was hanging on to Tangning. Never had he considered Tangning was a gem; her tolerance, all that she had given, her honesty...all of it would cease some day.\"Yufan, don't tell me you are feeling merciful?\" Han Ruoxue exclaimed loudly upon noticing her brother was unusually quiet.\"No way!\" Han Yufan wrapped his arm around Mo Yurou as he responded stubbornly. However, the fear in his heart was slowly seeping through.It was a bright night; lights were flashing and wine glasses clinked. At this moment, Han Yufan and Tangning's distance was no longer as simple as a few rows of seats....After the launch ceremony was over, TQ's editor recommended Tangning to multiple fashion companies and personalities as they mingled amongst the guests. During one of their conversations, Lin Weisen couldn't help but ask out of curiosity, \"Where is your manager? May I meet him, I feel like we got along really well during our conversations.\"After hearing Lin Weisen's request, she was dumbfounded for a moment as she looked around the hall for Mo Ting. Finally, she spotted him clinking wine glasses with a group of successful personalities. Their eyes met as Mo Ting looked at her caringly.He seemed to be asking her: What's wrong?Tangning quickly shook her head. The husband and wife understood each other's thoughts:\u00a0I was just trying to see where you were.Mo Ting's lips curved to an attractive angle before turning back to the man beside him and continuing his conversation.Tangning also turned her attention back to TQ's editor and replied, \"He is overseas. Next time I will definitely introduce you.\"\"OK, I look forward to it...\"He's right here, Tangning thought to herself. However, if she was to tell anyone the CEO of Hai Rui Entertainment was her manager, no one would believe her.Han Ruoxue and the others sat in a corner watching Tangning the entire time. Because of Tangning, no matter where they went, as soon as they heard they were from Tianyi Entertainment, people would give them a look that said:\u00a0So it's you, the stupid agency that suppressed your own artist.Seeing all the attention Tangning had gained, they were filled with regret...Hence, the Han siblings were too ashamed to walk around anymore. But this meant, Mo Yurou was missing out on the opportunity to make friends.\"I need to go to the bathroom.\" Mo Yurou tried to loosen herself from the siblings' control because she and Mr. Li had already been sending messages through their eyes a good few times.\"Go ahead,\" Han Yufan did not question the woman that slept by his side at all.Mo Yurou lowered her head as she stood up. As she passed by Mr. Li she deliberately brushed the back of her hand against his. The two entered the bathroom one after another. Not long after, some ambiguous pants could be heard coming from the women's bathroom...\"After the Annual Model Awards Ceremony is over, I want to leave Tianyi Entertainment and join Creative Century.\"During their moment of passion, Mo Yurou set her price; she knew men were the most vulnerable at times like this.\"Sure,\" the man replied from behind her, \"But are you sure you won't miss your little boyfriend?\"\"He's always just been a stepping stone for me.\"\"Haha, you sure are ruthless...\"The two spent half an hour in the bathroom before tidying themselves up and walking out. Han Yufan and Han Ruoxue were busy chatting to some guests so they didn't take notice of her. Mo Yurou did not rush back to them, she just sat to the side by herself as she observed everything that was happening in the hall.After the Bright Night Gala, Tangning's value would definitely go up, but in the end, she still did not possess any big awards. Even though Star Age were determined to get Tangning, if Mo Yurou was to sign on with Creative Century, it would mean she'd have better resources than Tangning.When that time comes......she would definitely make Tangning experience how being stepped all over and humiliated felt like.Seeing Mo Yurou sitting quietly, Han Ruoxue held onto her wine glass as she returned to her side. Her voice sounded a little surprised, \"You don't seem to be the low-profile type, what are you thinking?\"\"Tangning's already got all the attention, do you think I can compete?\" Mo Yurou asked back as she laughed.\"I've already contacted the paparazzi and organized a free headline for her. I'm curious how Mo Ting will react once he sees the article.\" Han Ruoxue gently shook the wine glass in her hand while her eyes were glued to Tangning.However...Han Ruoxue would have never considered, the reason Mo Ting managed to keep such a low-profile was because he had connections with the news. So, as soon as Han Ruoxue made her phone call, Mo Ting received a recording of it.The person that reported it asked Lu Che what they should do.As it involved Tangning, Lu Che didn't dare to make the decision on his own, so he quickly stepped towards Mo Ting and whispered into his ear.Mo Ting was silent for a few seconds before apologizing to the guests beside him and heading for one of the guests' waiting rooms. He then took the recording from Lu Che and listened to it.\"I am Tangning, at the Bright Night Gala I took an intimate photo with the CEO of Hai Rui. I want you to create hype for me with an ambiguous headline...I want to be the main headline on the front cover no matter how much it costs!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From this recording alone, it is hard to decipher who it is,\" Lu Che explained. Things like this, he had seen multiple times before. After all, the industry had always been this dark. \"Looks like someone that's experienced.\"\"Contact the media source and instruct them to return the phone call. When they have the culprit on the phone, ask the culprit to repeat what they said earlier. Be careful not to let the culprit figure out what we are trying to do. While the phone call is being made, look around and see who from Tianyi is talking on the phone. Quietly follow them and secure evidence.\" Mo Ting put away his phone; he had an intense look in his eyes.\"Yes, president,\" Lu Che replied with a nod as he took composed steps out of the room.Meanwhile, Mo Ting returned to the hall. His sharp gaze swept across the Han siblings. In reality, he didn't need to test them to already know who the culprit was. The only person capable of doing such a thing was the well-experienced Han Ruoxue. If Han Yufan had the capability of scheming like his sister, he would not merely be where he was today.Maybe because she noticed a change in Mo Ting's expression, Tangning gazed over questioningly amongst the crowd. Mo Ting contained his anger, picked up his phone and answered with four simple words: \"Let's talk at home.\"In reality, Mo Ting had underestimated Tangning's sensitivity towards his emotions. After living with Mo Ting for so long, she had gotten a grasp of his temper; he only ever got upset when something concerned her as it was the only time he found it worthy of getting angry over.Tangning glanced over at the Han siblings; she could vaguely guess what was going on.Tonight she had been too outstanding and impressive. Even though she knew there was a possibility she would be stabbed in the back, she didn't expect the Han siblings to really have no restraint.10 minutes later, Mo Ting watched as Han Ruoxue stood up from her seat. Holding onto her phone, she walked to a hidden spot. Less than 5 minutes later, she once again returned to her seat. At this time, Lu Che gestured to Mo Ting that he had secured the evidence...Everything was as expected...He had wanted to make a move on Han Ruoxue for a long time. He just hadn't found the right reason since everything she did was within Tianyi. Who would have thought, in the end, she'd be brave enough to offend him.After the gala was over, Tangning left the venue with TQ's editor. Han Ruoxue and the others followed closely behind - so close Tangning could practically feel their piercing glares...Afterwards, TQ's editor left first; he had an issue to deal with. Han Ruoxue took this opportunity to step in front of Tangning. She looked her straight in the eyes and said, \"I've really underestimated you. You managed to make an appearance even though we tried to hold you back.\"\"However, Tangning, no matter how smart you are, you've still done something you shouldn't have. How dare you take a photo with the CEO of Hai Rui. Did you think you could elevate your value by using him? Let me tell you, you will only make enemies for yourself.\"\"If that's all, I need to go home and rest,\" Tangning didn't take anything Han Ruoxue said to heart.\"Do you think you are Mo Ting's woman? He was only playing around with you. How could you think highly of yourself?\"Hearing this, Tangning quickly turned around and glared sharply at Han Ruoxue, \"Han Ruoxue, I must bow down to your capability of forever maintaining a jealous heart. Because of you, Tianyi's destruction will be just around the corner.\"Han Ruoxue looked at Tangning with ridicule; just the thought of the news that would be exposed tomorrow filled her heart with joy.Tangning knew what Han Ruoxue was thinking; this was not the first time Han Ruoxue had looked at her with this provoking smile. She was waiting to bully her and see how her fate was to unfold. However, things never went her way. And this time...was no different.\"While we're talking, when will you be leaving Tianyi?\" Han Yufan butted in as he questioned Tangning seriously, \"Star Age has already tried to poach you multiple times, why aren't you leaving? Haven't you sought enough revenge on me?\"\"It's because I want to see whether you still have an ounce of humanity left in you...\" After speaking, Tangning boarded the sports car Long Jie had driven to pick her up in and left. At this time, Han Ruoxue turned her attention to Mo Yurou as she carefully scrutinized her.\"Why were you so quiet tonight?\"\"I wasn't feeling well,\" Mo Yurou replied; her face was pale. She was cheating with someone while she was pregnant, how could things not go wrong?\"Then hurry home and rest.\" Han Ruoxue looked at the two and continued, \"The awards ceremony will take place soon, don't let anything go wrong between now and then. Don't think of going to the hospital, stay at home and rest.\"\"Yes, Ruoxue Jie...\"Of course, she had to rest, otherwise how would she have the energy to watch tomorrow's show unfold?...Late at night. Hyatt Regency.Tangning and Mo Ting did not drive home together, because after the gala was over, celebrities and reporters were everywhere. In order not to attract any trouble, the two took separate paths home.As Tangning's route was shorter, she got home first. As soon as Mo Ting walked in through the front door she handed him his home clothes so he could get changed first and be more comfortable. She also prepared some soup for him to sober up; earlier on at the gala he must have drunk a lot.\"What happened today? How come your gaze was so abnormal at the gala...\" Tangning gently rubbed Mo Ting's stomach, hoping it would make him feel better.\"What do you think?\" Mo Ting pulled her onto the sofa before handing her a recording and a video.Tangning was confused, but after looking at the two items, her expression became calm as she let out a laugh, \"Looks like Han Ruoxue has her methods.\"\"Too bad she's not applying it to any good,\" Mo Ting said as he gently stroked Tangning's hair. \"You don't need to worry about this matter. Since it involves me, I will not show any mercy...\"Tangning understood what Mo Ting meant. He had been waiting for this opportunity for a long time. Since she had made a move first, from now on her destiny no longer belonged to her.\"Since you secured evidence, why are you still upset? I've already been schemed against so many times, did you think I would be affected by another time?\"Mo Ting took a deep breath and placed Tangning's head in his embrace.\"I am upset because my heart breaks for you. Luckily I have the ability to protect you.\"Tangning calmly wrapped her arms around Mo Ting's waist as she tried to take in his scent. She then pulled out her phone and showed Mo Ting their photo from the night, \"Does this look like a wedding photo?\"\"Uh huh, my wife looks beautiful,\" Mo Ting's gaze softened.He knew Tangning didn't want him to worry about her, so even though she was being schemed against, she didn't show any signs of unhappiness...Since they were brave enough to make things difficult for Tangning......tomorrow, he would make Han Ruoxue pay back a thousand-fold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, she completely forgot about the man that stood at the pinnacle of the entertainment industry...since he possessed so much power, how could he be used so easily?In reality, the fact that Mo Ting had allowed the photo to be taken in the first place, meant he accepted what was to come, even if it was to create hype...But, Han Ruoxue did not realize this and insisted on framing Tangning. Truthfully, it's possible this opportunity may have been deliberately given to her by Mo Ting so he could deal with her.After all, Han Ruoxue's obstacles for Tangning had been laid out at Tianyi; if he was to deal with her, he'd have to use his own name.Han Ruoxue was happy the entire night, however, the news that was released the next morning was nothing like what she expected...[Exposed! Tianyi's director carefully schemes against her own artist!][Han Ruoxue pretends to be Tangning to frame her for creating hype: intends to push her to death!][Tianyi's internal war continues: Tangning gets close to Hai Rui for hype?]All the media outlets seemed to be under a spell as they thought up of various headlines. At the same time, they revealed that Han Ruoxue was trying to frame Tangning but instead everything backfired on herself; they even attached a video as proof.The news first started from a famous weekly publication which attached a manuscript from a phone conversation they had with Han Ruoxue on the night of the gala. They also explained how she had pretended to be Tangning and tried to frame Tangning for creating hype with Mo Ting. On top of everything, if anyone was to say they had no proof, they also attached a video. Although the person in the video was shown from the side, no one could deny it was Han Ruoxue as she was easily recognizable.Within this short 3-4 minute clip, it was clear that she was discussing headlines and price with the publication, under the guise of being Tangning.With the appearance of this video, Han Ruoxue couldn't even smooth out everything with her PR...The news had already spread everywhere; it was practically on every single possible media form. Also, because the news involved the mysterious and low-profile CEO of Hai Rui, Mo Ting, and news like this didn't come around often, all forms of media wanted to report on it as soon as possible.In merely 2 hours, Han Ruoxue's evil deeds were known by everyone...\"Who would have thought, the entertainment industry was so dark. Luckily god punishes those that are evil!\"\"Full support for Tangning! She has always kept a low-profile, yet Tianyi treated her like this; they have no conscience.\"\"If Han Ruoxue likes to act so much why doesn't she become an actress? She is really the cheapest person.\"\"This really pisses me off, how could there be such a despicable woman? Does anyone want to form a group and go hit her with me?\"Tianyi Entertainment, CEO's Office. Han Ruoxue looked at the viral discussions and articles online; she was at the brink of insanity. The person that should have been scolded today was Tangning...However, a surprising twist had happened!Han Ruxuo's face looked lifeless as her whole body trembled. Because of the news, she was about to fall apart.There was mumbling in her ears as Han Yufan tried to work his PR on the phone beside her. Meanwhile, her hand trembled as she held onto her phone; there were a few times she subconsciously punched in Tangning's phone number.\"Tangning, was it you? Was it you that schemed against me?\"\"Han Ruoxue, you've flipped the situation around. You were the one that tried to frame me,\" Tangning pointed out the truth calmly from the other side of the line.\"Come out, come out and clear things up for me. This was all part of your scheming, you wanted to frame me...it was all because of you...\"Han Ruoxue's voice was harsh and sharp; her words were cruel and broken. She was too angry; she wanted to tear Tangning into pieces through the phone. However...Tangning remained calm; her cool and composed attitude made her appear like she had everything in the palm of her hands and all she was waiting for now, was to see Han Ruoxue's fate...\"You already knew this would happen, didn't you? Tangning, I am ruthless, but compared to me, you aren't any better. I was merely scheming behind your back, but you took things a step further!\"\"Han Ruoxue, you should go see a doctor...\" After speaking, Tangning swiftly hung up the phone and turned her attention back to her invite-filled email inbox.Was she so easily angered?Of course not.Compared to all that she had suffered from the Han family, Han Ruoxue's words were nothing...\"So refreshing! That b*tch tried to frame you but hurt herself in the process,\" Long Jie danced around in joy, \"Let's see how she continues in the entertainment industry after this.\"\"There is no defined line between black and white in the entertainment industry. Let's not be happy too soon,\" Tangning reminded Long Jie. \"If Han Ruoxue wants to clear her name, she will have her ways. After all, there are plenty of agencies that hurt their own artists, it's just they've never been exposed.\"\"Have you forgotten? Big Boss hasn't responded yet...Thinking about it, the incident has already occurred a few hours ago, why hasn't he said anything?\"Tangning looked at Long Jie as she giggled, \"When a cat catches a mouse, does he eat it immediately?\"It would play with it for a while. Make it afraid and fight for survival.Han Ruoxue had tormented Tangning so many times, for so long. If Mo Ting didn't take the opportunity to get back at her...then he wouldn't be Mo Ting...\"Aiyo, as soon as Big Boss leaves the house, he really becomes a king that no one dares to provoke. He's more calculative than anyone else.\"Tangning smiled, as usual, her heart felt warm. The feeling of being protected and taken care of...could only be felt when she was with Mo Ting. At the same time, as Mo Ting's lover, she would do anything for him....Of course...Tangning's predictions were right; at this moment, Han Ruoxue was frozen in place, because...she was panicking.The reactions online were so intense and netizens emotions were so angry, whereas Hai Rui...was yet to release an official statement.Before they were to respond, there were two possibilities: 1. Hai Rui didn't care about such a small issue and Mo Ting had no time to deal with such an unimportant person, 2. Hai Rui were currently preparing something...Inside, Han Ruoxue was leaning towards the first option. After all, she wasn't the first person to create hype using Mo Ting's name, he couldn't possibly have the time to deal with each and every one of them.If this was the case, as long as Hai Rui didn't react, she would still have the chance to revive; this was how the entertainment industry was like.That's right...for now she couldn't give up hope. Who knows if the situation would change?However, while she was hopeful that she still had a chance to escape a horrible fate...Hai Rui's PR news...was finally released...appearing on top of all the headlines!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Anyone that dares to work with her will be going against Hai Rui and be encouraging this type of unethical practice in the industry. On the other hand, after clarification with the media company involved, we have concluded that Tianyi\u2019s model, Tangning, was not involved in creating hype. In order to revive artists\u2019 faith in this situation, Hai Rui hereby acknowledges Tangning's innocence as per all audio and visual evidence presented!\"As soon as this statement was released, the entire entertainment industry was shaken up.Hai Rui had never treated a situation like this so seriously. The fact that Han Ruoxue was completely blacklisted meant that she could no longer survive in the entertainment industry, no matter what role she took on.The public assumed Mo Ting used Han Ruoxue as an example; he used the most extreme methods to warn everyone within the industry that if anyone dared to use him to create hype, they would be digging their own grave.Of course, this was how it appeared to the public. Compared to the public, those within the industry were trembling in fear.How Mo Ting managed to intercept Han Ruoxue\u2019s plan was extremely obvious: the main media sources were all under Hai Rui\u2019s control. No matter if it was framing someone or creating hype, as long as it involved Hai Rui, they would be able to uncover the truth and throw the culprit into a place beyond redemption.With the release of this statement, Han Ruoxue was over\u2026Completely over...Everyone thought the reason Tianyi wasn\u2019t affected was because Hai Rui was being fair; only targeting the individual involved. However, Tangning knew deep down, it was because she was still contracted to Tianyi. If Mo Ting also blacklisted Tianyi, her jobs would end up being affected.This man really took everything into consideration; all that he did, he did it with her in mind.\"Hai Rui is indeed the top entertainment agency. They are quick, accurate and firm with their decisions. So cool!\"\"That\u2019s why so many people exhaust their resources trying to get into Hai Rui. Hai Rui has really provided a fair platform for everyone.\"\"Not only did they punish Han Ruoxue, they even proved Tangning\u2019s innocence. A big company is indeed a big company; they are noble and classy.\"\"We have faith in Tangning. If she was the type to create hype, she wouldn\u2019t have endured all that Tianyi did to her.\"\"Oh, I am suddenly so in love with Tangning! She is the perfect combination of skills and beauty. She also possesses a great character.\"\"Han Ruoxue should go die. Hai Rui did well putting an end to unethical practices in the entertainment industry!\"\"Han Ruoxue die!\"In an instant, Hai Rui\u2019s statement appeared on the front page of all media sources. On top of everything, many famous personalities stepped out to support Tangning and Hai Rui. However, Han Ruoxue\u2019s torment didn\u2019t end there. Someone decided to expose the news of her being previously blacklisted in America and multiple pieces of scandalous information related to her. Anyone that had ever had any ties with her also took the opportunity to throw their attacks; hitting her while she was down.Meanwhile, Han Ruoxue locked herself in her office the entire day. From the moment Hai Rui released their statement, she had no hope of ever stepping into the entertainment industry again. This time, she was completely destroyed.She hid herself in a dark corner, not eating and not drinking. But her ears still rang with noise, because at this moment, there were too many people that wanted her to die\u2026way too many...\"Jie, are you inside?\" Han Yufan knocked on her door with a worried tone, \"You haven\u2019t eaten all day. If you continue on like this, you will get sick. If you can\u2019t be a manager, you can do something else, don\u2019t give up hope.\"\"Destroyed\u2026Everything is destroyed\u2026\" Han Ruoxue mumbled.The Han family had never been a rich family; if she was to change careers now, not only would she not have the ability to do so, she also wouldn\u2019t be able to get used to not wearing tailor-made clothes and limited edition handbags. If she couldn\u2019t be a manager, she would have to return to a life of being poor, how could she possibly handle that?\"That\u2019s right, I can go beg Tangning. Tangning\u2026\" Han Ruoxue seemed to have found her last glimmer of hope as she searched around frantically for her phone so she could call Tangning, \"Tangning, Tangning\u2026I want to see you.\"\"If you have something you want to say, say it over the phone,\" Tangning rejected her straightforwardly.\"Please\u2026I beg you. Help me put in a few good words. I don\u2019t want to leave the entertainment industry, I really don\u2019t\u2026\"At this moment, Han Ruoxue finally removed her arrogant mask and turned into a pitiful woman.\"I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have kept going against you. I can kneel before you and bow, can you please give me a chance for survival?\"On the other side of the phone, Tangning gently laughed as she asked, \"If I was the one that had been exposed for creating hype this morning and Hai Rui had decided to blacklist me, what would you have done?\"\"Would you have taken advantage of the situation and frozen my jobs? Or would you have taken the chance to debut your newcomer whilst ruthlessly kicking me out?\"\"Han Ruoxue, right now you are only admitting to your wrongdoings because you are not satisfied with the outcome. It's not that you feel any regret, you only feel it's not fair that you didn't manage to damage me...\"\"Han Ruoxue, all that you owed has now been officially cleared. From now on, we don\u2019t owe each other anything. Of course, this is only if you remain honest.\"Han Ruoxue responded with silence because everything Tangning said was the truth. If they had swapped places and Tangning was the one being blacklisted by Hai Rui, she would have found someone to mess around with her before kicking her out of the company. All this would have been done without showing even the slightest bit of sympathy.Han Ruoxue couldn\u2019t think of a reason for Tangning to help her; all she could do was get drunk at the hotel by herself.She had never imagined, she would fall this hard and be hurt so bad.Han Ruoxue ended up getting completely drunk at the nightclub. At this time, the men that frequented the club noticed she wasn\u2019t very precautious, so they took the opportunity to not only cop a feel, they even almost took her to the hotel. Luckily, Han Yufan arrived just in time to stop them, or else being blacklisted wouldn\u2019t have been the worst thing to happen to her...\"Jie, you should go to England tomorrow, I\u2019ve already booked a flight for you.\"\"Even you want to get rid of me?\" Han Ruoxue gripped onto Han Yufan\u2019s shirt as she sneered, \"You\u2019re afraid of being dragged down with me, aren\u2019t you?\"\"Jie, I\u2019m sorry, I have to look at the bigger picture. The company will make the announcement tomorrow that we will be removing you from your role.\"Han Ruoxue continued to sneer before pushing Han Yufan away, \"Don\u2019t make yourself sound so high and mighty; looking at the bigger picture my ass! Everyone says I\u2019m ruthless, but you, Han Yufan, are even more ruthless. After you make use of people- as soon as something goes wrong \u2013 you immediately turn your back on them like you don\u2019t know them.\"\"Do you really think, without me, Tianyi would be able to return to business as usual?\"\"Let me tell you: by blacklisting me, Hai Rui has indirectly blacklisted Tianyi too. The only person to come out on top is Tangning; she is the only one that hasn\u2019t been affected at all.\"\"I should have known. Tangning was with you for 4-5 years and you dumped her just like that. I thought as your sister, I would be able to avoid being treated the same way, but it turns out, to you, we aren\u2019t as important as your profits.\"\"Do you think that now I have fallen, Tangning would just let you and Mo Yurou go?\"\"I\u2019m not leaving! If I am to leave, I want to witness both your fates first!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

During the entire time that she tried to frame Tangning, the person that benefited the most was Tangning, followed by Hai Rui Entertainment.After being mentioned by Hai Rui, Tangning\u2019s fame increased dramatically while she gained more fans. At the same time, Hai Rui reconfirmed their status in the industry; killing THREE birds with one stone.Night hit. Tangning returned home to find Lu Che pacing back and forth outside the front door. She turned to him questioningly, \"Lu Che, why aren\u2019t you going inside?\"\"Madam, you\u2019re back.\" Upon seeing Tangning, Lu Che seemed to have seen his savior as his eyes lit up.\"What\u2019s wrong?\"\"The president\u2019s mood isn\u2019t too good today\u2026\"\"Why?\" Tangning looked at Lu Che and understood he was afraid of getting in trouble with Mo Ting, so she assured him, \"Don\u2019t worry, speak, I will handle this matter carefully.\"\"It\u2019s because of Hai Rui\u2019s statement. The higher-ups felt it wasn\u2019t necessary to mention your name and boost your exposure; there was a disagreement,\" Lu Che explained, \"Of course, they weren\u2019t brave enough to stop the president, but\u2026\"Tangning\u2019s heart sunk. She understood what Lu Che was trying to say, \"It\u2019s ok, I will comfort him.\"Even a small company like Tianyi had their power struggles, so of course, Hai Rui was no different.Obviously, Mo Ting\u2019s authority was being questioned and she was the one that ignited it.After Lu Che left, Tangning calmed down and entered the villa. Upon seeing Mo Ting standing by the study room window drinking wine, she gently approached him and reached out her arms to hug him from behind, \"President Mo, you appear to be upset.\"\"Did Lu Che say something?\" Mo Ting guessed. \"It\u2019s not a big deal; nothing to be upset about.\"\"To you, I am your wife, so it\u2019s normal for you to be biased towards me. But, to the staff at Hai Rui, I am not related to you at all, so it\u2019s expected that they would have their opinions,\" Tangning said gently.\"That\u2019s not the main issue,\" Mo Ting turned around and put down his wine glass as he wrapped Tangning in his embrace.\"Is it because someone wants to challenge your power?\" Just the thought of this made Tangning hug Mo Ting tighter, \"You\u2019re well aware that there are so many people eyeing your position, how could you help me in such a high-profile way. Mo Ting, I won\u2019t allow you to do this again. This time, it has made you unhappy, but what about next time? This incident with Han Ruoxue, I know you had it all figured. You had been waiting for this opportunity for a long time and the photo at the Bright Night Gala was it. But, it wasn\u2019t necessary for you to prove my innocence in your statement; don\u2019t do it again.\"\"Are you complaining that I was meddling in your business?\" Mo Ting\u2019s expression was slightly disappointed.Tangning froze for a moment before grabbing hold of Mo Ting\u2019s hand and placing it atop her heart. She looked at him seriously as she spoke, \"It hurts here. Everyone knows you are like a king; you are beyond reach. But I know, behind you is an abyss waiting for you to fall into.\"\"I, Tangning, am not worthy. Even if I was to accept your help, it would be the day when everyone acknowledges my abilities.\"\"The entertainment industry is a dark place, I can\u2019t just accept your protection as if I deserve it. While people are attacking you, I can\u2019t just sit still. There\u2019s nothing else I can do, can\u2019t I at least protect your heart?\"Hearing Tangning\u2019s words, Mo Ting was stunned, dumbfounded and shocked.However, it only lasted a second before he violently grabbed onto Tangning\u2019s cheeks, wrapped one arm around her waist and passionately kissed down on her lips. The reason why his love for Tanging was growing stronger and stronger was because their souls were connected. This thought made him grasp onto Tangning\u2019s hands as he applied more force to his kiss\u2026until Tangning\u2019s lips became red and swollen.Afterwards, he returned to his usual poised and confident manner as he spoke into Tangning\u2019s ear, \"I feel like I should thank the bunch of old dirtbags\u2026for giving me the opportunity to hear words from your heart.\"\"But\u2026Ning\u2026you\u2019ve underestimated your man. In the entertainment industry, there\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t do. Did you think anyone that challenges the king\u2019s power would have a good ending?\"\"Then why were you upset\u2026\"\"You\u2019ve been tricked by Lu Che\u2026\" Mo Ting was slightly amused as he spoke.Tangning froze. She then smiled as she spoke, \"It\u2019s good that he gave me this warning, in case I\u2019m unaware of the difficulties you face.\"After hearing Tangning\u2019s words, Mo Ting smiled as he lifted her in his arms and carried her into the bathroom, \"I want you\u2026\"Tangning slightly blushed, but she still lifted her hand to undo Mo Ting\u2019s buttons. Seeing this, Mo Ting couldn\u2019t help but think of the words she had just said; she wanted to protect his heart. He instinctively lifted Tangning\u2019s jaw and kissed her on the ear sensually, \"Not only must you protect my heart, you must also protect my body\u2026\"Mo Ting\u2019s pure white shirt was thrown to one side atop Tangning\u2019s patterned A-line skirt. As one piece of clothing hit the ground after another, the couple looked at each other; they only had each other in their eyes as a passionate fire ignited\u2026Tangning was a model; every part of her body was important, so\u2026Mo Ting made sure to remain gentle. Tangning could sense his restraint, so\u2026she grabbed onto his neck and said, \"I am not made of porcelain, I will not shatter with the slightest force.\"\"Is my wife telling me to\u2026use more force?\" Mo Ting entered her body and satisfied all her needs. After the married couple were finished being intimate in the bathroom, Tangning was so tired she fell asleep.Mo Ting looked at the tired look on Tangning's face as he gently leaned over and gave her a kiss, \"With your words, everything I do is worth it. No matter what you want to do, I will accompany you to the end of time...\"...After the Han siblings had their argument, Han Ruoxue disappeared while Han Yufan had a gloomy expression the entire night. On the other hand, Mo Yurou appeared to be unaffected. She did not comfort Han Yufan like she normally did, instead, she just minded her own business as she read the news.\"Mo Yurou, don't you think you've been acting a bit strange lately?\"\"Yufan, it's hard enough that I have to carry around this child, did you expect me to get involved with the internal battle between you and your sister?\" Mo Yurou asked back in disdain. \"However, I do feel you made the right decision in giving up on your sister. After all, Tianyi is currently being trampled by Tangning. With her being blacklisted by Hai Rui, you only did what a CEO should do.\"\"How long has it been since we've been intimate?\" Han Yufan questioned. He noticed Mo Yurou had changed way too much. In the past, she had always clung to his embrace and acted cute to get her way, but now she treated him like he didn't exist.\"Yufan, the child is growing, it's making me feel unwell.\"Thinking of the child, Han Yufan stopped questioning her. He simply stood up and walked into the bathroom to have a cold shower. It was normal for a man to have his needs, but it wasn't normal for Mo Yurou to act this way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tianyi's higher-ups had reached their limit with Han Yufan; he couldn't suppress Tangning and he couldn't win her over either - he was even more useless than the security guard guarding the front door. He was the reason Tianyi had become such a foul place.A few shareholders expressed their intention to withdraw their shares; they had lost hope in Tianyi as they mocked and pressured Han Yufan. After returning to his office, Han Yufan was so angry he smashed everything in sight; every single bone in his body was filled with hatred towards Tangning.At this time, the newcomer models Han Ruoxue had scouted previously, arrived at the office to sign their contracts. Upon seeing Lan Yu, Han Yufan immediately called her over, \"Have you ever done a runway show?\"\"Yes I have. I am the winner of the Model Search Competition,\" Lan Yu replied respectfully.That's right, Han Ruoxue had discovered this girl at the Model Search Competition.\"In that case, you don't require any training,\" Han Yufan exclaimed. A thought crossed his mind; many companies had contacted the agency directly in hopes of working with Tangning as they didn't want any disputes with their contracts. Hence, in his hands were multiple collaborations that weren't selected for Tangning. He decided to select one and recommend Lan Yu. If the client rejected the recommendation, he would simply cancel the contract preventing Tangning from ever contacting them again.\"Lan Yu, I will prepare a manager for you soon and she will help guide you.\"\"Thank you, President Mo.\" Lan Yu was only 16 years old, so as expected, she wasn't as mature as Tangning; revealing a childish smile. Upon seeing her smile, Han Yufan felt a little taken aback; once upon a time, Tangning was also this easy to work with, but...the thought of Tangning now made him want to tear her to pieces.Looking at Lan Yu, Han Yufan felt a mix of emotions; she was too similar to Tangning. He couldn't help but feel angered when he saw her, but he was determined to quickly make her famous. So he had to get her to imitate Tangning in order to borrow Tangning's fame.\"That's it, you may leave.\"Outside the door, Mo Yurou listened in on Han Yufan and Lan Yu's conversation. She immediately pushed open the door and questioned Han Yufan, \"Are you still planning to use this fake copy?\"\"I'm planning to give Tangning's resources to her and let her give them a try,\" Han Yufan calmly explained.\"Although Tangning does not possess any big awards, she has the same amount of resources as an A-Grade model. Why are you giving such good resources to a newcomer that hasn't even officially debuted? Yufan, why don't you give them to me?\" Mo Yurou's mood became a bit agitated, \"Haven't you considered that I will be receiving an award soon? Not only that, I also have your child in my stomach. No matter what, you should have my best interests in mind...\"\"That's enough! In my meeting with the shareholders, they were already unhappy that I was showing you too much favoritism.\"\"Han Yufan, you are so fake. Is it because you found someone younger that you've decided to dump your second woman?\" Mo Yurou sneered, \"Your sister was right, you have no loyalty and all you care about are profits. In order to reach your goals, you could sacrifice anyone.\"Hearing Mo Yurou's words, Han Yufan's expression showed a trace of ridicule, \"Anyone has the right to say this to me except you. Mo Yurou, I sacrificed Tangning for you.\"\"In that case, you should give Lan Yu's resources to me.\"Han Yufan looked at Mo Yurou's greedy face and how she had no self-awareness; he suddenly felt like laughing, \"Must you wait until I am kicked out of Tianyi for you to be happy?\"Mo Yurou was dumbfounded.The couple argued loudly. At this time, a tall figure was eavesdropping from outside. A mocking expression swept across her childish face before she walked downstairs to Tangning's room.\"Come in,\" Tangning's voice resounded from the room. She was here because every couple days she would visit the office to see if her fans had left her any presents. While here, she would also check on Tianyi's progress.Lan Yu pushed open the door and entered the room. She had a timid expression on her face, but upon seeing Tangning's calm and introverted demeanor, she was lost for a moment before speaking, \"I am a new model that just signed on with Tianyi, I am called Lan Yu.\"She had previously left a deep impression on Tangning, \"I remember you.\"Tangning remembered her as the substitute Han Yufan had found for her.\"Can I discuss a trade with you?\"Were all 16-year-olds this mature? Tangning couldn't help but smile as she responded, \"Let me know what your conditions are first.\"\"Actually, President Han has decided to give me one of your resources and the manager that was originally intended for you. But I know, it's pretty much impossible for me to fully take advantage of this opportunity. Since you have plenty of runway shows lined up, could you just give this one to me? I can report to you about Han Yufan and Mo Yurou whenever you want.\"\"No need,\" Tangning replied calmly. \"Right now, I am already used to Han Yufan's actions, even if he was to find a substitute for me and get you to steal my resources.\"Lan Yu was silent...she looked a little disappointed.\"You are still young, I don't want to get you involved in the adult's battle. Of course, if you manage to secure the show yourself, then it would mean you are capable and I will not stop you.\"All her shows and magazine cover jobs were currently being selected by Mo Ting, whereas the companies that went via the agency weren't aware of the situation and just wanted to seek benefits, how good could they be?\"Thank you, Miss Tang,\" Lan Yu's eyes suddenly lit up.Tangning smiled in disapproval. The fact that she was so young and already knew how to negotiate with others to benefit herself proved she wasn't a very innocent person. Tangning decided not to do anything and just sit back and watch what troubles this 16-year-old would cause.After Lan Yu left, Mo Yurou stormed into Tangning's room and glared at her in hatred, \"I can't believe you would actually support a newcomer.\"\"Mo Yurou, you should be careful. Lan Yu seems to be younger and more beautiful than you. The fact that Han Yufan could get rid of me to be with you, means he could also get rid of you for her.\"Mo Yurou glared at Tangning's back and sneered, \"Tangning, you must have had support to get to where you are today too, right?\"\"I've suspected it for a long time. All along, everything has been going your way; don't tell me it's because you are capable. The CEO of Star Age has already revealed he's been trying to poach you multiple times...you don't appear to be very clean. Stop acting all pure and innocent in front of other people.\"\"You've claimed that I've bribed the judges, what about you? What has the CEO of Star Age promised you? Is his bed soft?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trial Marriage Husband: Need to Work HardCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTangning turned around. The look in her eyes were so indifferent it would cause others to tremble in fear as she gave off a sense of ridicule and disdain.Tangning wanted to say, \"Not everyone is like you\", but...she couldn't be bothered because she knew Mo Yurou would find a way to twist her words around.In the doorway, Han Yufan looked at the two with an icy gaze. He was especially cold after hearing Mo Yurou's last words; was it really because of Star Age that Tangning had gotten to where she was today? Han Yufan was upset so he sneered at Tangning, \"Come to my office.\"Tangning got out of her seat and followed behind Han Yufan, they both entered his office one after another. Han Yufan leaned over his desk. Without looking at Tangning, he asked, \"Is what Yurou said true? Do you have an unspeakable relationship with the CEO of Star Age?\"\"No, I don't,\" Tangning replied straightforwardly.\"How could you still lie to me. That night at the Bright Night Gala, the CEO of Star Age told me personally he had been trying to poach you multiple times in the past. Tangning, who would have thought you'd act all innocent and pure in front of me. You even made me feel guilty.\"\"Since everything Mo Yurou says is the truth to you, then what's the point of asking me?\" Tangning's reaction was unfazed; towards Han Yufan, her heart was cold.\"Great, that's great Tangning! All along you had been criticizing Mo Yurou and I, but it turns out you were actually the most skilled cheater.\" Han Yufan turned around and approached Tangning full of hatred. He really wanted to know when Tangning had started hooking up with the CEO of Star Age; was it when they were still together?3 years ago, Star Age had already started scouting Tangning - 3 years...meanwhile he was fearfully trying to hide Mo Yurou!\"Sl*t!\"Although this was a word he had wanted to say for a long time, today was the first time he had actually said it - right in Tangning's face.Tangning's eyes went icy cold as she glared at Han Yufan and responded articulately, \"Because of what you said, I swear I will destroy Tianyi ten times faster.\"\"Han Yufan, not everyone is as despicable as you. Just because Mo Yurou and Han Ruoxue can't do anything to you, do you think I wouldn't be able to either?\"\"In half a month! I will let you experience what it feels like to lose everything.\"Han Yufan looked at Tangning as she made her vow. He suddenly felt feeble compared to her; after all the recent clashes he had with Tangning, he knew Tangning was not someone to easily give up. Above all, she kept a low-profile, so it was hard to predict what her next move would be. Every time he thought he had her figured out, she would turn the tables miraculously.Han Yufan was a bit regretful of the words he just said, but...Tangning had already walked off into the distance.How could he have called her a sl*t...he was way too emotional.At this time downstairs, there were indeed people from Star Age who had arrived. Star Age's CEO came to invite Tangning to dinner, but she refused just as she did in the past 3 years; not giving him even half a chance.\"Sorry President Zhou, I have my own car.\"He was once again rejected as he watched Tangning drive off into the distance and around the corner. It was at this time that Lan Yu appeared out of nowhere, stretched her arms out and blocked their way; her appearance was at least 70% similar to Tangning.\"If Tangning doesn't want to go, can I go in her place?\"Zhou Yanqing furrowed his brows; this girl was too brave, how dare she jump in front of their car. But, he couldn't deny that although Lan Yu did not have the professionalism and elegance of Tangning, she was indeed younger - being younger was a huge advantage. If they couldn't get Tangning, then picking up a Lan Yu wouldn't be too bad of a consolation prize; it would simply mean they'd have to invest more in the early stages.He considered this option even though deep down, he still wanted Tangning more....On the way home, Long Jie noticed Tangning's expression wasn't well; something was wrong. She promptly asked, \"What happened? Tangning, did you have an argument with the sl*t and jerk again?\"Sl*t...Upon hearing this word, Tangning was reminded of what Han Yufan said earlier; it seemed she had been too gentle on Tianyi. Luckily...the awards ceremony was just around the corner, she would definitely destroy Mo Yurou this time! Everything that was in the past was in the past, but what Han Yufan and Mo Yurou owed her, she was going to make them pay her back; no holding back.Long Jie saw Tangning's expression was gloomy so she stopped asking. She simply escorted Tangning back to Hyatt Regency and told her to rest early. After all, TQ magazine's photo shoot was about to start, so it was important for her to recharge her batteries.Upon returning to the villa, Mo Ting was already home. Next to his hand sat a few documents. As usual, this was all for her.Seeing one side of Mo Ting's charmingly handsome face, Tangning took a deep breath. She already had such an amazing person by her side, she couldn't wish for everything to always go to plan, so she tried her best to calm her emotions.\"What are you looking at?\" Tangning walked over to Mo Ting and sat down as she asked.\"Helping you select a suitable management agency. Although I can assist you from behind,...you still don't have anyone to represent you. So after leaving Tianyi, you require a better and stronger team,\" after explaining, Mo Ting placed some information in front of Tangning.Tangning thought Mo Ting would suggest she join Star Age, but instead, he placed the name Cheng Tian in front of her.Although Cheng Tian couldn't be considered as a leading entertainment agency and was still far from top agencies like Hai Rui and Star King, they were still considered as a top-notch company. On top of that, in terms of creating international supermodels, they were well experienced.According to Tangning's current status, going to Cheng Tian seemed to be asking for too much.\"Has an appointment been arranged with Cheng Tian?\"\"No, you will need to fight for it yourself. They will be holding auditions\u00a0soon. When that time comes, I'll take you there to give it a try.\"Tangning nodded, she never doubted Mo Ting's decisions. Mo Yurou wanted to enter Creative Century while Lan Yu wanted to steal Star Age's offer from her, yet, Mo Ting didn't select either of them. Instead, he wanted Tangning to join Cheng Tian Entertainment who were on a much higher level. If they succeeded, the announcement would once again create chaos.Thinking of Mo Ting's thoughtfulness, Tangning grabbed onto his hand and intertwined her fingers with his, \"During the day you need to deal with your company's issues, and at night, after returning home, you need to look through my documents, aren't you tired?\"\"No matter how tired I am, I don't want to see you be at a disadvantage. I can't allow my wife to suffer,\" Mo Ting planted a kiss on Tangning's lips.\"Like this, could we consider that you created me?\" Thinking about how Mo Ting had supported her behind the scenes all along, it wouldn't be unreasonable to think this way.\"My dear wife, I am waiting to become your personal manager!\" Mo Ting smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was Tangning's wish and aim. Looking at Mo Ting's tired expression, she gently massaged his shoulder. Feeling his tense muscles, her heart ached. She remembered she would need to fly to France in a couple days, so she immediately reminded Mo Ting, \"In two days I will need to do a location shoot, would you like to come with me?\"\"Where is it?\"\"France. You've had so much work, I don't want you to be tired. Ting...let's make a pact. Whenever I need to go to another country, you will come with me. Like this...anywhere with my presence, would also have your footprints.\"Mo Ting was silent for a moment. He had flown all over the world, but it had always been for work; never once did he think about stopping down and resting.Accompanying Tangning meant he would be able to relax and have a break. Most importantly, Tangning was the most beautiful scenery. Just the thought of being able to stay by her side and take care of her was a beautiful thing - so he nodded.\"As you wish. I'll get Lu Che to make arrangements.\"Tangning was satisfied as she turned her attention back to Cheng Tian Entertainment's profile; no matter if it was for Mo Ting or herself, she was going to use all she had to fight for this opportunity....A few days after the incident with Han Ruoxue, a huge scandal was released online about a young actor being caught taking drugs; in an instant, this became the hottest topic online. As the annual awards ceremonies were approaching, it was normal for celebrities to spill information about their competitors around this time.The Annual Model Awards was just around the corner. As one of the guest award presenters, Tangning didn't need to be wary of people scheming against her. However, with Mo Yurou's arrogant and domineering attitude, how could she not make a move after knowing she'd receive an award?\"Tangning, do you remember what day tomorrow is?\" Long Jie asked on the way to TQ's headquarters.Tangning flipped the magazine in her hands and replied without lifting her head, \"Han Yufan's birthday.\"\"Do you want to do anything?\" Long Jie asked.\"That money, I'd rather donate it to charity,\" Tangning responded calmly.Yesterday she had said some harsh words in front of Han Yufan; he probably thought of it as a joke...but he had no idea, the awards ceremony would be the end of Mo Yurou's road.\"You're right. This year, let's disregard him,\" Long Jie laughed. The thought of how Tangning had exhausted her efforts to celebrate Han Yufan's birthday in previous years only to be stood up, made Long Jie's heart break. Luckily Tangning had been awoken. \"Another thing to consider, Tianyi definitely won't survive, so your contract will definitely be canceled soon, what do you plan to do? I heard the newcomer Han Yufan signed on has stabbed you in the back and stolen the contract with Star Age.\"\"Tangning, what are you and Big Boss planning to do?\"\"Are you planning to sign with Star Age or Creative Century?\"\"Neither,\" Tangning replied calmly, \"Mo Ting wants me to go to Cheng Tian.\"Long Jie was stunned for a moment before smiling...\"If Big Boss has faith in you, so do I.\"\"In regards to the companies that Lan Yu and Mo Yurou have their eyes on, Mo Ting already eliminated them, so they can take it if they want. To me, it's not a loss at all.\" Tanging continued to flip through the magazine. At this time, Long Jie caught a glimpse of a sharpness in her eyes.The two women were happy with themselves; thinking they were so capable to steal something from Tangning. However, the truth was, what they had stolen, held no value in Tangning's eyes.Cheng Tian Entertainment: that was where Tangning wanted to go. She was originally a superstar and aiming to advance was a normal human desire.TQ magazine's photo shoot was scheduled for two days later, but at this time Lin Weisen requested for Tangning to drop by the headquarters. Tangning had a feeling she knew why he had called her. However, when Lin Weisen actually announced she was invited to attend a fashion show in France and to walk down the runway during the opening of Luxury's collection, she was still so surprised she froze in place.\"Tangning, actually, for the October front cover, I am planning to take a photo of one of your poses from the show. This is a big opportunity for you, it will be very helpful in your return to the international stage.\"\"This was suggested by your low-profile manager. I feel he is right, you indeed have the capability; so I decided to recommend you. We could treat this as a way for me to fulfill the promise I made to the media at the Bright Night Gala.\"Tangning looked at Lin Weisen, she was suddenly speechless; she knew TQ's shoot would be an important turning point in her comeback and this turning point was created by Mo Ting.\"There's no need to be emotional. If you want to thank me then show how professional you can be. Only the best models are worthy of the best resources.\"Tangning held back her tears as she gave Lin Weisen a hug and nodded, \"I will definitely not disappoint.\"\"Your current agency is too messed up, so I've decided to keep this news under wraps for now.\"\"Thank you, Editor Lin.\"\"'Hard work pays off'; I think that phrase suits you well.\"Tangning smiled. Towards this man, she was extremely thankful. She had always been the type to seek revenge when needed and to show gratitude where required.Returning to the international stage...This was something Tangning didn't dare to dream about, but now, her opportunity had come. While Mo Yurou was wasting all her efforts on seducing the judge and Lan Yu was thinking of ways to convince the CEO of Star Age, Tangning had secured a critical chess piece...Of course, all this was because of Mo Ting, who loved her and spoilt her...She was hardworking, but she was also lucky, because she had married the best husband in the world.Han Yufan had no idea Tangning would once again go up another level.Tianyi office. Han Yufan was currently watching the video of Lan Yu's runway walk which she filmed for her interview. The job had originally been intended for Tangning, but the client didn't seem upset. From the looks of it, they were quite satisfied with Lan Yu.Mo Yurou sat beside him and sneered. She is but a nobody, how could she take on Tangning's jobs and receive the attention of everyone in Tianyi.\"Yurou, do you know what day it is tomorrow?\" Han Yufan suddenly turned to the woman beside him and asked.Mo Yurou thought carefully and suddenly started getting nervous; tomorrow she had arranged to secretly meet with Mr. Li, why was Han Yufan asking this? Did he know?No...that can't be possible. If he had known, he wouldn't be asking in this tone...\"Yufan...you should be aware, my pregnancy has been affecting me really badly, I've been having really bad memory. How about you just tell me.\" Mo Yurou used her child as a shield.\"Tomorrow night I have reserved a room at Champagne Hotel; we can celebrate there.\"Champagne Hotel!?Mo Yurou was suddenly nervous.That was the place she had previously had an affair with Mr. Li and tomorrow they had also reserved a room there.As she was nervous she would be discovered, she completely forgot about Han Yufan's birthday...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mo Yurou looked around and realized she had forgotten Han Yufan's birthday...Previously, for his birthday, she had always planned something special to hold onto him so Tangning would be left to wait around stupidly. However, times had changed. After experiencing the excitement of cheating, Mo Yurou realized she could no longer turn back.\"Yufan, I've been unwell the past few days, so...I haven't prepared a present for you,\" Mo Yurou said as she hung on to Han Yufan's shoulder and drew circles on his chest with her delicate fingers; she knew this was his weakness.As expected, Han Yufan grabbed onto her right hand and responded forgivingly, \"I know, it's hard for you to be pregnant, but tonight, you need to make up for it...\"Han Yufan's ambiguous words passed through her ear. At the same time, she could also feel his hot breath on her earlobe. Mo Yurou smiled shyly as she nodded, \"OK...\"After all, they had been together for a few years now; she couldn't possibly disregard him completely...thinking that Tangning may take this opportunity to get back with Han Yufan, she felt like she had to protect her pride.Even if she didn't want him......she couldn't let Tangning have him!So, she decided she'd cancel the meeting with Mr. Li and spend the night with Han Yufan.\"Yufan, do you think...amongst these presents, there would be one from Tangning?\"In reality, Han Yufan had already questioned this. Would Tangning still care about his birthday? In previous years, she had always prepared a present for him wholeheartedly; but he always ended up spending the night beside Mo Yurou making Tangning wait all night by herself. At that time, he thought Tangning would always be like that; in the palm of his hands...\"Let me have a look...\" Mo Yurou was determined to humiliate Tangning as she searched through the presents, however, she was disappointed to find nothing, \"Seems that sl*t has learnt to behave. But Yufan, it's been a while since we've had a meal with the staff. How about we...call Tangning to join us for lunch?\"Han Yufan understood her intention as he furrowed his brows. In the end, he nodded in agreement, \"You give her a phone call then.\"Mo Yurou gave a girly smile before grabbing the phone from Han Yufan's pocket and ringing Tangning's number.\"Tangning, today is Yufan's birthday. We are having a staff lunch, will you come?\" Mo Yurou asked with the attitude of a winner; she felt proud that she was using Han Yufan's phone to call her.\"Oh, Tangning is busy. She is currently filming something for TQ...\" Long Jie's voice responded from the other side of the phone.\"Is she busy or is she not brave enough to attend?\"\"Miss Mo, I know you are desperate for Tangning to see your live show of affection, but Tangning does not have the time to attend so-and-so's birthday. You don't have any work, but her schedule is full...\"\"You!\"Long Jie sneered as she hung up the phone. She couldn't be bothered to continue with Mo Yurou.Tangning noticed Long Jie smiling at her and she smiled back; this would be Tianyi's final celebration....Night hit. Han Yufan and Mo Yurou entered Champagne Hotel together. Han Yufan had blacked out from drinking too much, so after placing him on the bed she started unbuttoning his shirt.At this time, she received a phone call from Mr. Li. Mo Yurou anxiously ran into the bathroom to pick up the phone, \"Mr. Li, didn't we agree tonight was canceled?\"\"Then do you still want Creative Century's contract? I am in room 3029...\"Hearing Creative Century being mentioned, Mo Yurou's heart raced. This was an opportunity she had been waiting for for a long time, she couldn't let it go. After all, Han Yufan was completely drunk, he probably wouldn't know she's gone.After weighing the pros and cons, Mo Yurou stopped hesitating. She helped Han Yufan settle into bed before catching the lift to the 30th floor. However, she never expected, Han Yufan would wake up in the middle of the night...Realizing Mo Yurou wasn't in the room, Han Yufan immediately sat up and rang Mo Yurou's phone; Mo Yurou didn't pick up. It was the middle of the night, where could she have gone?He ended up questioning the reception desk and checking with the monitoring room; afraid that Mo Yurou may have gotten in danger. But, after the hotel showed him the security footage, he realized Mo Yurou had gone to the 30th floor and snuck into room 29.\"Mr. Han, do you want us to send someone with you?\" the security guards asked.\"No, it's OK,\" Han Yufan's face looked sick. Although he hadn't witnessed it himself, he could already guess what was going on. So he clenched his fist tightly where others couldn't see.Normally, the hotel respected their guests' privacy; footage like this was normal, but they never dared to expose it. However, this man had just caught them in the act!Everyone looked at Han Yufan in sympathy. The feeling of humiliation tore his heart apart painfully.\"Mr. Han, are you OK?\"Han Yufan's face was pale and his legs were weak. However, he maintained his calm attitude as he stepped out of the monitoring room and boarded the lift to the 30th floor.He didn't know when he ended up knocking on the door of room 29. He pretended to be a staff member...until the door opened and Mo Yurou stood in the doorway wearing her nightgown...Upon seeing her, he slapped her square across the face like a lion releasing its anger; Mo Yurou fell to the ground. Meanwhile, at this time, the man that was having an affair with Mo Yurou was lying sideways on the bed; sound asleep...\"Yufan...Yufan, don't offend him, you can't offend him,\" Mo Yurou held onto Han Yufan and pushed him out of the room before closing the door.\"Go away...\" Han Yufan pushed Mo Yurou away.His tall figure quickly disappeared at the end of the red-carpeted hallway.Mo Yurou collapsed; her eyes contained a sense of fear as she trembled...Everything had happened too quickly and too suddenly...A while later, the room door opened and Mr. Li stepped out to help Mo Yurou back in the room as he convinced her, \"What do you need a man like that for? You will be leaving Tianyi soon and you will be receiving a Top Ten Model Award. It doesn't matter if your relationship is destroyed at this point...\"\"As for Tangning, she's so arrogant, do you think she can continue on like this? Sooner or later she will be stepped all over by you.\"Hearing these comforting words, Mo Yurou slowly calmed down; this was the truth.Han Yufan, you should blame yourself for being useless, not me for being heartless...\"But, he holds important evidence against me...\"\"Precious. If he exposes it, it won't be beneficial for him either. If he is smart enough, he will stay quiet!\" Mr. Li sneered.Just to make sure, he got someone to erase the footage from the hotel later that night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So this was how it felt to be betrayed; anger, embarrassment, shame and loss of control - a thousand emotions coursed through his veins.For Mo Yurou, he had given up everything...He even broke up with Tangning...Yet, in the end, this was what he got in return: catching her in bed with someone else. He felt that his sincere heart had been played like a game by Mo Yurou...Ah...So back when Tangning discovered him cheating with Mo Yurou, this was how she felt. He wanted to crumble Mo Yurou in his hands; he wanted to skin her and break all her bones. But, even if he did all that, it still would not be enough to curb his hatred because he had already given so much and sacrificed so much of his youth.For Mo Yurou, he threw away Tangning and abandoned Han Ruoxue; he gave up everything to help her advance. In exchange, he found her in bed with someone else.The indescribable pain was rooted in his heart as it sprouted into anger and other complicated emotions...swallowing him whole. Three years of love ended in nothing...Tangning...He had once treated Tangning in the same way. Thinking of Tangning, Han Yufan remembered all the humiliation and torture he had put her through. If this was meant to be the most painful form of karma, he was already at the point where he was in so much pain he'd rather die.Han Yufan kneeled on the floor defeated; this kind of humiliation, he would only allow it to happen once!In the end, Han Yufan phoned Tangning. In a calm voice he spoke, \"Tangning, can you come back?\"On the other end of the phone, Tangning was packing her and Mo Ting's luggage. Hearing Han Yufan's question, she was slightly stunned, \"What do you mean?\"\"Come back to my side...I'll give the best to you...\"Tangning stopped what she was doing. Her eyes contained a sense of ridicule which Han Yufan could not see, \"If I want something, I can get it myself, I don't need you. President Han, if that's it, I will hang up first.\"\"Can you not leave Tianyi?\"Tangning hung up the phone without responding and continued to pack her luggage; she could roughly guess what had happened between Mo Yurou and Han Yufan. Originally she thought she would look forward to this day, but this wasn't the result she wanted to see. Han Yufan was turning back, not because he was truly regretful, but because he probably experienced the same kind of betrayal as her...Not long after, Mo Ting packed away his documents and headed into the bedroom. Seeing Tangning standing beside the bed in a daze, he stretched out his arms and hugged her, \"Sorry, I've been working till so late.\"Tangning returned Mo Ting's hug as she tried her best to absorb the warmth from his body, \"I know you are trying to make time to go overseas with me...\"\"What's wrong?\"Mo Ting noticed a slight change in her voice; they had developed an understanding between each other over time. Although Tangning wasn't someone that usually spoke much, Mo Ting could still sense a change in her emotions by simply looking at her expression.\"I think Han Yufan and Mo Yurou have split...\"\"I just suddenly feel a sense of realization. I've figured out whether I've done all this to seek revenge on them or to do something for myself. I understand now: of course it is important to make them face their consequences, but...more importantly, I want to stand side-by-side with you, on the same level.\"Mo Ting gently stroked her black hair comfortingly before carrying her over to the bed, \"Good girl, close your eyes. We will be going overseas tomorrow...I will always keep you company...\"Tangning closed her eyes peacefully; within Mo Ting's embrace she fell asleep sweetly because she knew, the day they return from overseas would be the day she'd take care of Mo Yurou, once and for all!Early the next morning, before Tangning even got the chance to board the plane, Creative Century leaked the news that they had actually been after a different model in Tianyi, not Tangning.Everyone assumed, Creative Century only said this because they had been repeatedly rejected by Tangning and this was the only way for them to save their pride. As for the other model they mentioned, it couldn't be anyone else but Mo Yurou.Is Mo Yurou about to make a comeback again?Did she steal a big contract from Tangning?Sl*t! She's not worthy of it!The netizens snorted in contempt; they did not think Mo Yurou's personality deserved any compliments. If Creative Century was really going to work with her, then it would be hard to imagine how many contacts and schemes she used; or even how many higher-ups she slept with. However, these negative reactions didn't stop Mo Yurou from climbing up the hottest topic rankings.\"Tangning, do you want me to investigate what happened?\" Long Jie looked at the news in discomfort.No matter what Mo Yurou wanted to do, it was her own business. But the fact that Mo Yurou used Tangning to create hype made Long Jie disgusted.\"This may not have happened for no reason,\" Tangning replied. \"Long Jie, I have a feeling Han Yufan and Mo Yurou have split. If this is the case, take notice of Mo Yurou, she may get an abortion. We have to make sure she at least keeps it until the awards ceremony.\"Long Jie froze for a moment before nodding, \"I understand...I will do something about it.\"\"It doesn't matter how her relationship with Han Yufan is - since she owes me - I will definitely make her pay for it!\"...Meanwhile, Han Yufan also saw the news online. His handsome face immediately swept over with a cold expression; it seemed Mo Yurou really did sleep with a big shot. No wonder she managed to secure a Top Ten Model Award; now she also had the opportunity to join Creative Century.Did she want to just leave like this?As if it would be that easy.Just as Han Yufan was about to take action, Mo Yurou threw open his office door and entered as usual. She looked exhausted with swollen red eyes...\"What are you here for?\" Han Yufan's voice was a little hoarse like he was trying to restrain himself.\"Yufan, I'm here to beg for your forgiveness,\" Mo Yurou suddenly started shedding tears, she had a pitiful look in her eyes, \"I really had no choice; that man had his eyes set on me. He used you and Tianyi to blackmail me; I couldn't do anything. Can you give me 5 minutes to explain?\"Han Yufan looked at her in ridicule like he was looking at an enemy, \"Did you think I would still trust your words?\"\"Didn't you already hook up with Creative Century? What? You still have an interest in my small company?\"\"Mo Yurou, you really disgust me...\"Seeing Han Yufan not budge at all, Mo Yurou immediately sucked up her tears and laughed coldly, \"You can't blame anyone for this. If you had the ability to protect me and was capable of stepping on top of Tangning, I wouldn't have had to go down this path.\"\"I've been your lover for 3 years...\"\"But what have you given me? All you have given me is failure...\"\"Han Yufan...don't forget, I still have your child in me...\"\"What do you plan on doing about this child?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was well-aware that after being with Han Yufan for so many years, it would be impossible to end things completely. Everything that was once a secret had now turned into something he could hold against her; if he was to mention any of them, she would be pushed into a point of no return.Han Yufan looked quietly at her with a sharp gaze, like he could see through to her soul.\"Of course you should give birth to it. I've already given up so much for this child, did you think I would give up on it so easily? Mo Yurou, let me tell you, if you dare to abort my child, I will do everything I can to destroy your career.\"Han Yufan's words were deep and sinister, carrying a warning. If Mo Yurou wanted to shake herself off from him and Tianyi, it wouldn't be that easy!Mo Yurou looked at Han Yufan dumbfounded. She thought, according to Han Yufan's temper, there was no way he would accept this child's existence, but...who would have thought, he'd ask her to keep the child.If she was to keep the child, how would she be able to sign with Creative Century?The news about her changing agencies had already spread like wildfire, if she couldn't get rid of the child, how was she to explain to Mr. Li and Creative Century?Han Yufan looked at the speechless Mo Yurou as the corners of his lips slightly curved up. There was no way he'd let her retreat in one piece after betraying him. He was going to wait and see what other disgusting things she could do, now that she 'had the tiger by the tail'*.Thinking of this, Tangning once again crossed Han Yufan's mind; how she once felt and her state of mind - in this moment - he felt like he finally understood it all...So, being betrayed by someone could make one so ruthless and so hopeful for the other person to be destroyed. Not long after, Han Yufan pulled out his phone. In front of Mo Yurou, he made a phone call to Long Jie, \"Give me Tangning's schedule, I will book a flight to France tonight.\"On the other side of the phone, Long Jie froze. Han Yufan actually wants to come to France? It seemed he was dreaming of reconciling with Tangning.Seeing Long Jie didn't respond, Han Yufan's voice turned cold as he spoke more aggressively, \"Long Jie, I am still the CEO of Tianyi and Tangning is still my artist, I have the right to know what she is up to!\"In reality, Tangning had already heard his words resounding from Long Jie's phone, so she instructed Long Jie, \"Send it to him.\"\"But...\"Tangning shook her head, reminding Long Jie there was no need to clash with Han Yufan. Long Jie nodded as she unwillingly replied to Han Yufan, \"I will send it to your phone.\" Afterwards, she hung up the phone and looked at Tangning confusedly.\"You are supposed to keep Big Boss company, why did you agree to Han Yufan?\"\"Couldn't you tell? Mo Yurou was beside him; he just wanted to spite her. With all that's going on with Creative Century, did you think he would really come? Don't worry. Plus, we aren't even staying in the hotel we originally scheduled,\" Tangning explained while she unpacked Mo Ting's clothes.After hearing her, Long Jie relaxed as she sent Tangning's schedule to Han Yufan.\"OK, tomorrow morning I will come to pick you up. I'll leave you and Big Boss to exchange some warmth in the meantime,\" Long Jie winked as she left the room and returned to the hotel organized by TQ.Not long after, Mo Ting walked out of the shower after washing up; from head to toe, all he was wearing was a pure white towel. Tangning quickly stood up to help him dry his hair. She hung to him gently and considerately as she asked, \"Did you want to sleep first, or would you like to go for a walk with me to the beach and wait for the sunrise?\"\"Of course I want to go see the sunrise,\" Mo Ting responded gently. In reality, ever since he had been in charge of Hai Rui, he had never been this relaxed; this was all thanks to Tangning who didn't allow him to bring any work along.Tangning smiled as she pulled out a set of fresh clothes and helped Mo Ting get changed before holding onto his hand and intertwining her fingers with his.The couple stayed in a beachside villa; their surroundings were extremely peaceful. Unlike her usual model image, Tangning wore a yellow A-line dress with a straw hat; around her neck hung a camera. Mo Ting had his arm around her shoulder the entire time as they walked barefoot on the beach.The sound of the crashing waves passed through their ears as a glow appeared in the distant horizon. The couple sat side-by-side on the beach as they admired each other. Tangning couldn't help but hold up her camera and take a photo of Mo Ting's face side on.Mo Ting turned his head and smiled as he reached out his arm and pulled her towards him before grabbing the camera and taking a selfie.\"I can't keep this photo, can I? If the paparazzi discover this...\" Tangning looked at the photo regretfully as she spoke.\"Of course you can keep it...\" Mo Ting grabbed onto her chin as he kissed her passionately, \"This is a memory of ours.\"\"Be careful, there are people around...\"\"At this time of day, where would you find people?\" Mo Ting looked at her amusedly as he once again gave her a kiss; their tongues danced together as their hearts filled with an unexplainable sweetness. Watching the sunrise with the person they loved and walking along the beach together made everything around them seem to stand still; if only the sun would rise later.Unfortunately, Luxury's show was that morning. As the opening model, Tangning played an important role, so after the couple finished being affectionate on the beach, Tangning freshened up and headed to the venue. Looking at all the unfamiliar foreign faces, Tangning was suddenly reminded of when she was 18 years old and worked hard in France.She was nervous as usual, but, she was no longer the inexperienced little girl. Her calmness made the makeup artist extremely impressed, \"Luxury's show is filled with newcomers, but you are the only one that doesn't look frightened.\"Tangning smiled as she turned to glance at the other models.\"Oh yeah, the opening was originally meant to be done by a different Asian model, but...because she was too nervous, they ended up replacing her with you. She is over there.\" The makeup artist pointed her chin towards the right, gesturing Tangning to look over. Sitting on the sofa with a defeated expression was a girl in her early twenties, \"She's now become a substitute.\"Tangning glanced at the model; she did not recognize her. Afterwards, she changed into her clothes and sat quietly in her chair.Tangning inspected herself in the mirror. This show would be her opportunity to secure an impressive report card before auditioning for Cheng Tian, so...to her, it was extremely important. The show would also determine whether she could jump over Creative Century and Star Age; placing herself above all of them...Luckily, Mo Ting was also present.This was something that made her feel warm just by thinking about it.Not too far from Tangning, a figure glared at her with hatred. The opening wasn't something she was willing to give up...Tangning had stolen it.Of course, she recognized Tangning; she had been slightly famous in Beijing recently. But, what right did she have to steal someone else's job?She was just an outdated old model from a small company!Translator's Notes:* The actual term used by the author was \u9a91\u864e\u96be\u4e0b, which literally means: Riding a tiger but finding it hard to dismount. This expression is used to describe when a person is forced to continue because there is no alternative; they've already gone too far to turn back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her arms were crossed as she glared at Tangning.She was aware Tangning had her methods, otherwise, how could an outdated model come out successful in a fight with Mo Yurou and end up where she was today. Even so, she couldn't believe Tangning would dare to steal a Cheng Tian model's job. If they didn't stop her now, Tangning would become an even greater threat in the future.Of course, they had no idea Tangning's next aim would be to join Cheng Tian!The manager looked at Tangning. Through her contacts, she managed to find out how Tangning secured Luxury's opening; it was because of Lin Weisen.He's a pretty big name...But, now that Tangning was in the industry, the manager felt she should no longer dream of being able to suck up to the powerful while still maintaining her reputation. After all, she was hanging around with the ill-reputed Han Yufan and Mo Yurou; she might as well join them...Not long after, the opening began to the sound of retro music. As the first model on stage, Tangning immediately became the center of attention. Her professionalism, her charm and her style held the show that was filled with newcomers together. It also opened the international media's eyes to the unlimited possibilities of an Asian model. At that time, a few of the guests even recognized Tangning as Kira, who had once gone home with many newcomer awards; they were shocked but also pleasantly surprised......because on the runway, no one could compare to her radiance...she was completely dazzling.At this time, Mo Ting was sitting below the stage; this was his first time seeing Tangning do a show from close up. It was hard for him to imagine: this was his wife. Lin Weisen was also close by, as well as TQ's photographer who was snapping away on the camera; the scene in front of them was absolutely perfect. Everyone couldn't help but be amazed by her performance...After the models took their bow and left the stage, Lin Weisen headed to the back of the stage to congratulate Tangning, \"You are the best.\"Tangning smiled as she politely shook Lin Weisen's hand, \"Thank you, Mr. Lin.\"\"I'm already looking forward to TQ's October edition...\"After talking to Lin Weisen, Tangning changed back into her own clothes with Long Jie's help and left the venue; she couldn't wait to walk the streets of France hand-in-hand with Mo Ting. Not long after the show ended, Long Jie received a phone call from Tianyi. Han Yufan wanted to know what was going on with Tangning.Long Jie searched the news online and immediately came across some hot articles about Tangning: [Tangning Vs Mo Yurou: The Support Behind the Scheming], [The Men Behind Tangning]. The main point behind every article was that after every single battle between Tangning and Mo Yurou, Mo Yurou had been completely defamed, while Tangning continued to advance forward; the reason may not be because Tangning used the right methods, but because she had more men supporting her from behind.One of the articles even mentioned Star Age and Lin Weisen who had been showing her support.Most of the netizens still trusted Tangning, especially her fans who immediately started spreading videos of her shows and images from her magazine shoots. They wanted to prove, she completely depended on her own abilities to get to where she was today.However, there were also some anti-fans. They claimed Tangning's EQ was too high and her IQ was frightening; she was too deceitful and was someone people should watch out for.At that time, the internet was in chaos.\"How could having a high EQ be considered a negative trait...I really have to give it to them,\" Long Jie looked at the discussions online; she was so angry she was about to explode.Tangning glanced at the discussions and laughed. After casually disguising herself, Tangning headed into the parking lot with Long Jie and boarded Mo Ting's car.\"I saw the news...\" Mo Ting said before he started the car, \"Now that your fame is increasing, attacks from all different direction will also increase. When faced with competition, people will scheme, you understand what I'm trying to say?\"\"Of course. It's just that this time, Mo Yurou has once again been given a chance to insult me...\" Tangning understood well, so as usual, she wasn't going to respond; she knew the more she tried to explain herself, the more it would seem like she was hiding something. Since someone was helping her gain exposure, she might as well accept it; this was the reality of the entertainment industry.\"You don't want to contain it?\" Long Jie questioned Tangning. To be exact, she was chasing Mo Ting for an answer.However, Mo Ting and Tangning already had an agreement: he wasn't gong to interfere in her career. He had already broken his promise with the Han Ruoxue incident, so this time, he didn't have enough reason to forcefully help his wife.\"Long Jie, don't forget. My management agency is still Tianyi.\"Seeing the couple remaining calm, Long Jie relaxed, \"OK, you guys have fun. I will keep my eye on the situation in Beijing.\"Tangning smiled at Long Jie in relief, \"Help me reassure the fans. Tell them I have not been affected.\"Meanwhile, it was almost night time in Beijing. Under Han Yufan's coercion, Mo Yurou agreed to keep their child. Of course, she only did this to buy time. With the sudden release of Tangning's news, Mo Yurou sat in Han Yufan's office and sneered, \"I told you before...there was no way Tangning would be pure...now that she has been exposed, will you help her? or will you take the advantage to step on her even harder?\"\"Shut up!\" Han Yufan warned.After the incident with Mo Yurou, Han Yufan had become warier than before. Although he did consider reconciling with Tangning...the thought of Star Age's CEO and Lin Weisen, made his heart become cold like ice.Mo Yurou was disgusting, but Tangning wasn't any better.It seemed he couldn't place his hope on either woman.\"If you won't get PR to help her, then I won't be able to resist defaming her. It wasn't easy to get this opportunity,\" Mo Yurou laughed.Han Yufan did not respond; it didn't seem like a bad idea to damage Tangning's spirit a little.Afterwards, Mo Yurou rang her assistant, \"Leak some information: while shooting for the magazine in the US, Tangning didn't follow the organizer's arrangements, instead she was fooling around with an unknown man and went to live with him. Releasing this information right now would be perfect timing...be careful not to let anyone know you did it.\"Mo Yurou was an eyesore to Han Yufan as the coldness in his heart thickened...However, he didn't realize, he was merely the pot calling the kettle black...Of course, it was expected that Mo Yurou would defame Tangning like this; Tangning just treated it like Mo Yurou's last hurrah because as the Annual Model Awards approached, Mo Yurou was getting closer to falling into the depths of the abyss...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She changed into a Bohemian-style maxi dress and relaxed on the deck of a yacht with Mo Ting, who was wearing a casual white suit. All she brought along was a camera; even her phone was left in the drawers of the villa.Mo Ting looked down at her as he wrapped her in a warm embrace. At first, he thought she was forcing herself to stay strong, but, Tangning was indeed calm like she had completely stripped herself of her model identity.\"Do you really not want to return home first?\"\"Why do we need to return straight away?\" Tangning turned her head and questioned Mo Ting. \"President Mo, did you think I would easily give up on the holiday that I made you work so hard towards? My career is important, but...right now, you are the most important...\"Mo Ting gazed at Tangning as he planted a kiss on her lips.\"Do not feel burdened and have faith in me. I will find a solution.\"Mo Ting nodded before grabbing the back of her head; he couldn't help but deepen his kiss. Amongst the beautiful scenery of the Seine River, the couple indulged in a passionate kiss as their bodies overlapped each other...In an instant, the 'Entertainment Industry's Big Boss' and the 'Outdated Model' no longer existed. All that was left, was a simple husband and wife, strolling through the streets of France hand-in-hand.As they strolled, they happened to come across a small alley filled with couples that were kissing. They were stunned for a moment before looking at each other and smiling; in their eyes, there was no trace of awkwardness.It seemed, although the couple didn't have a heartwrenching love story, their relationship would still be longlasting...The couple continued to stroll around casually for the rest of the day. After returning to the villa, apart from Tangning's camera being almost full, Mo Ting's hands were also filled with Tangning's belongings. But, he didn't mind, because this was a rare moment of relaxation in his life and he felt extremely fortunate.This amazing woman......because of her, it felt like his life had once again found meaning.That night, Mo Ting embraced Tangning in their huge bathtub. Both of them had their eyes closed as they enjoyed the peace and quiet of the moment. After being silent for a while, Mo Ting finally reached out his hand and touched Tangning's partially wet hair as he leaned her closer to him, \"Let's return tomorrow...\"\"Huh?\" Tangning slowly opened her eyes as she questioned him.\"One day is enough for me. I know what kind of situation you are in, but since you won't let me interfere, I am really worried about you. Miss Tang, don't you know I am your fan?\"As Tangning's status was hard earnt, it was very important to Mo Ting. She had been walking on thin ice to get to this point and had given so much, he didn't want her to let it go to waste.\"People often say, 'The amount of people that like you, is equivalent to the amount of people that hate you; the amount of people that adore you, is equivalent to the amount of people that are waiting to see you humiliated.' Mo Ting, I am well aware of this...\"Mo Ting hugged Tangning tightly without a word. After she finally fell asleep, he got up to phone Lu Che, \"Have you found out who released the information?\"Lu Che assumed Mo Ting would ask this as he promptly replied, \"Cheng Tian's manager: Yang Jing. Her younger sister is a model signed with Cheng Tian who was originally invited to do the opening for the Luxury show. However, she was replaced with the madam. Later on, Tianyi added oil to the fire by also spreading some false rumors.\"\"Since it's Cheng Tian, we'll leave it for now.\"As for Tianyi......their days were numbered!After all, once Tangning was signed with Cheng Tian, she would have plenty of opportunities to teach these self-righteous people a lesson. Most importantly, Tangning's ultimate goal at the moment was to completely defeat Han Yufan and Mo Yurou; by holding back, she would make them doubt themselves.Tangning predicted Mo Ting would phone Lu Che about her situation, so she wasn't in a deep sleep. She sat up and wrapped her arms around Mo Ting's waist, \"Are you not going to listen to anything I say?\"\"Just trying to gain some important information so my mind can be at ease,\" Mo Ting smiled.\"President Mo, I think you must not be tired enough...\" Tangning said with a double meaning. Her nose brushed past his back muscles, sending tingles down his spine; the passion in his body was reignited, \"Come, let's do some exercise in bed...\"...10pm in France; 4am in Beijing. Han Yufan awoke from his sleep. He walked over to the guest bedroom with a frustrated expression. He could see Mo Yurou lying under the glow of the moonlight, however...the thought of this woman sleeping with another man, made his heart fill with hatred. He was so angry his eyes started to turn red...Online, news of Tangning using men to advance her career was spreading like wildfire; at the same time, Mo Yurou had just been caught cheating...Han Yufan endured for half a second. In the end, he couldn't help but pick up Mo Yurou's phone to see the messages Mr. Li had sent her.Mr. Li wanted her to calm Han Yufan down while he tried to find a way for her to break free from his control. Scrolling down, Han Yufan saw Mo Yurou's response and fell apart.\"He actually wants to keep the child...I'm really not sure who the child will look like after it's born.\"Han Yufan clenched his fist before saving the phone number.Rather than waiting to be dumped, used and treated like a stepping stone, it would be better for him to swap Mo Yurou for something more useful. So, he made a phone call to Mr. Li as he held in his humiliation and demanded, \"I can let Mo Yurou go, under one condition!\"The man smiled shadily; he knew Han Yufan would do this, so he calmly responded, \"Go ahead.\"\"Any competition or awards presentations that you are a judge in, if there is someone from Tianyi, you will need to guarantee them an award!\"Mr. Li was silent for a while, before laughing out loud, \"It's just Mo Yurou...as if I would do something like this for her. Unless...\"\"Unless what?\"\"How about you add in Tangning. All along, I had thought she was pure and clean. But it turns out, she was just another cheap model that uses men to advance herself. Since that is the case, why don't you let me play with her...I can give her some benefits.\"\"You also want Tangning?\" Han Yufan's voice got louder and more aggressive.\"Both women have betrayed you. Using them to exchange for opportunities for your newcomers, is worth it, right?\"Han Yufan's eyes deepened. His chestnut-colored pupils contained a sense of hatred. So it turned out this old sleazebag not only slept with Mo Yurou, he also had his eyes set on Tangning.On the night of the Bright Night Gala, he was frightened by Mo Ting, so he was careful. But now that he found out Tangning used men to advance, he, of course, did not have to hold back.\"Deal?\"\"Words mean nothing, we need to sign an agreement!\" Han Yufan was worried Mr. Li would lie to him.\"That's fine with me...you select a meeting place.\"Han Yufan's voice echoed from his bedroom. At this time, Mo Yurou was leaning against the door listening to the conversation without making a sound..She did not know that Han Yufan had sold her off, all she heard was Tangning's name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he finally returned home in the evening, his body was covered in the stench of alcohol. Mo Yurou approached him and gently shook his shoulder, \"Yufan\u2026Yufan.\"In his drunken state, Han Yufan mumbled under his breath, but it was hard to tell what he was saying. Mo Yurou flipped open his briefcase and spotted an agreement between Han Yufan and Mr. Li; she immediately picked it up to take a closer look as she took out her phone and snapped a photo. She then placed it back where she found it.A moment later, Han Yufan opened his eyes. Upon seeing Mo Yurou, he immediately sobered up and pushed her away, \"Mo Yurou, you are free; you can abort the child as you please. You\u2026can also move out when you are ready; there is nothing else between us\u2026\"After speaking, Han Yufan stood up and headed into his bedroom, slamming the door shut; an ear-shattering bang echoed through the apartment...Mo Yurou glared coldly at the back of Han Yufan\u2019s head as he disappeared from her sight. She then glanced down at the picture of the agreement; Han Yufan was Party B and he had agreed to Party A\u2019s first condition of setting her free and no longer causing her any trouble. The second condition\u2026was Tangning!Mo Yurou sneered. At that moment she wanted to ridicule Han Yufan\u2019s naivety; as if that old sleazebag would be so generous. Agreeing to give away awards, was so that he could get a continual supply of newcomers in his bed...Unknowingly, Han Yufan hadn\u2019t merely betrayed just these two women, he technically also sold off all his future artists.But, it didn\u2019t matter to Mo Yurou\u2026thinking about Han Yufan selling the high and mighty Tanging off for such a cheap price\u2026was so satisfying. Plus, she was about to go home with a Top Ten Model Award and a contract with Creative Century. Luckily, she had evidence in her hand against the old sleazebag; once everything was over, she would get rid of him...Tangning, you were just ruthlessly sold off by the man you once loved!Mo Yurou smirked as she looked at her slim waist; she could finally get rid of the child. Unfortunately, the next few days wouldn\u2019t be the best time; the awards ceremony was fast approaching and there were too many eyes on her. So, she decided to wait until after the ceremony to carry out her secret arrangements.Everything seemed perfect\u2026she had never imagined she would have the chance to be reborn like this....Early in the night, Tangning\u2019s flight landed in Beijing. As her schedule was confidential, not many people knew of her return.The news about her using men to advance her career was still being discussed, but as usual, she did not respond; not even a simple explanation.Outside the airport, Lu Che had arrived to escort Tangning and Mo Ting home. The couple left the airport separately before boarding the same Lincoln Limousine.\"President and Madam, you have both worked hard\u2026but regarding the news created by Cheng Tian, will Madam really not respond?\" Lu Che turned around to ask as he sat in the driver\u2019s seat.\"Has Mr. Li made any moves?\" Tangning slightly lifted her head and asked gently.\"No, Mr. Li doesn\u2019t care about gossip like this,\" Lu Che shook his head. \"At the same time, Star Age is keeping everything ambiguous on purpose. They want to keep an unclear relationship with you so that your relationship with Tianyi will continue to fall apart. Also, from what I\u2019ve gathered, Star Age and the newcomer, Lan Yu, have been getting very close\u2026\"Tangning let out a gentle laugh and took a deep breath, \"Then, let\u2019s disregard this scandal. Once the time is right, the truth will naturally be revealed.\"\"The fact that someone is starting a scandal about you means you are standing in someone\u2019s path. It also means\u2026you are in an important position,\" Mo Ting said before tightening his embrace on Tangning. After 9 years of emotional training, Tangning no longer had a heart like glass that was easy to shatter. A scandal like this did not affect her at all. After all, an even bigger news was about to be released......as if a small scandal like this would be enough for the public to continuously discuss in their spare time.Thinking of this, Tangning turned to question Long Jie who was currently flipping through the news, \"Is Mo Yurou\u2019s child still alive?\"\"Of course, I guarantee!\" Long Jie swiftly nodded her head as she smiled. \"I\u2019ve been keeping a close eye on her. Since the awards ceremony is approaching, news is easily leaked; even if she wants to take a risk, it would definitely be after she gets the award.\"\"Good\u2026\" Tangning replied calmly; her eyes looked deep with meaning. She had been waiting long enough for this day to come...Mo Ting looked at Tangning and suddenly realized all his worries were in vain. But even so, he still instructed Lu Che to keep an eye on what was to follow with The Annual Model Awards Ceremony.He held onto Tangning\u2019s right hand and comforted her gently, \"Don\u2019t worry, your wish will come true.\"\"Even if the whole world was to go against you, I would take on the whole world for you\u2026\"Tangning responded by also holding onto Mo Ting\u2019s hand as she smiled softly; she knew Mo Ting always did as he said.In the back seat, Long Jie watched as the two put on a show of affection. She realized Tangning only revealed soft expressions like this in front of Mo Ting. Although she often smiled in front of everyone, the feeling she gave off was merely cold and polite; and when she wanted to be ruthless, she didn\u2019t hold back.Of course, Lu Che was already accustomed to this sight. How Mo Ting displayed himself to the public was obvious. On the other hand, when he was with Tangning, he was a gentle and responsible husband; it was like he wanted to give all the best things in the world to her.These two people\u00a0were like one extreme meeting another extreme...\u2026In the past two days, the entertainment news was focused on the awards ceremony, but unfortunately, Tangning was merely a guest award presenter.Mo Ting watched as Tangning stared at the TV in a daze as he turned to comfort her, \"If I remember correctly, you\u2019ve already received this award a long time ago\u2026so, the feeling of receiving the award must not be foreign to you.\"\"That was many years ago\u2026\" Tangning turned to him and responded. \"Plus, at that time the award had only been created; the rules weren\u2019t set in stone yet and it wasn\u2019t as valuable as it is now.\"\"Do you regret it?\" Mo Ting asked as he rubbed his hand on Tangning\u2019s shoulder.Tangning shook her head and smiled, \"Of course not\u2026although the value is different, look at how easily Mo Yurou managed to secure one by using her contacts. It proves that the award selection is no longer fair\u2026what use do I have for an unfair award?\"\"This award ceremony will become the battlefield for me to take down Mo Yurou\u2026\"\"Tomorrow night\u2026she will be more nervous than when I received my award.\"Mo Ting smiled as he pinched her nose, \"I will not make an appearance at the ceremony, but as usual, I will be looking forward to your performance\u2026as I watch it being broadcasted live.\"Tangning nodded as she straightened her body and kissed Mo Ting, \"When have I ever let you down?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why is it him?On the side, Long Jie continued to chatter about things to take note of for the awards ceremony. However, Tangning's heart felt uneasy, \"Long Jie, can you help me prepare a hidden camera?\"\"Hidden camera? I don't have anything like that. But I do have a voice-recording brooch. Why?\"\"I don't think Li Yu has good intentions,\" Tangning said as she lifted her head to look at Long Jie. \"There have already been many reports about him within the industry. The fact that he has been organized to enter with me, I need to be wary of it.\"\"OK, I will help you prepare it in a moment,\" Long Jie replied after realizing the situation. She held the back of her head in frustration, \"Tangning, you deserve an assistant that is more capable and thoughtful. I've realized all I can do is ride your coattail.\"\"You've been good to me these past few years, I don't wish for anything else.\"There was no harm in having a smart support team, but...they wouldn't be guaranteed to always be loyal to her.Whereas, Long Jie was just right. All she needed now, was a capable manager to take over the work from Mo Ting. She didn't want Mo Ting to be so hands-on; it was too tiring for him.The two looked at each other and smiled; they understood each other. It was at this time that Long Jie received a phone call from Lu Che asking her to tell Tangning to look at the entertainment news.Long Jie turned on the TV with a confused expression before seeing Mo Yurou full of spirit in front of the camera receiving an interview.\"Mo Yurou has signed on with a new agency, ending her relationship with Tianyi!\"\"Exposed: Creative Century's newly signed artist. So, it really isn't Tangning, but her?!\"\"Mo Yurou announces the cancellation of her contract with Tianyi. All is revealed about her betrayal to Han Yufan.\"Seeing these headlines, regardless of when it happened, one thing was clear: Han Yufan and Mo Yurou had split!\"Mo Yurou must be feeling proud again,\" Long Jie shook the remote in her hand as she gave a 'Hmmph'.\"Let's see if she can still be proud after tonight.\" Tangning looked at Mo Yurou who was being interviewed on TV. Towards this woman, she had long lost her patience and sympathy.\"Thinking of it, she is quite pitiful. After just signing on with a new company, she will have to fall from her perch straight away.\"Tangning smirked. The reason Mo Yurou had been so rash in making an announcement was because she was afraid something bad would happen if she delayed it too long. The child in her stomach was a ticking time bomb. But, as if Han Yufan would be so tolerant to allow Mo Yurou to leave so easily.\"Right now, I want to thank two people. The first one is the CEO of Tianyi, Mr. Han, for helping me and protecting me. The second person is my colleague, Tangning. Without you, there would be no me!\"After Mo Yurou spoke, the Artists Director from Creative Century stepped out to help put on a show in front of the media, \"This entire time, the person Creative Century wanted was Miss Mo Yurou. In regards to all the rumors, we are sorry. As for all the fake reports, I would like to request the media distinguish between lies and the truth. Lastly, we would like to welcome Mo Yurou to the Creative Century family!\"The rumors she referred to was obvious; it was the rumor about them wanting to scout Tangning.Since Tangning was suffocated by scandals and had no relations to the awards ceremony, of course, they would take advantage of the situation to clear their name of rumors.\"They are so shameless. Have the people at Creative Century forgotten about the documents they sent to your email?\"\"Just because you are faced with a small problem, these people are all pouncing on the opportunity to clear their name. What about Mo Yurou? She's had so many scandals, yet they are still willing to take her?\"\"That's because once Mo Yurou secures her award, all the scandals can be easily covered up. In the entertainment industry, there is no definite right and wrong.\" Tangning stared at Mo Yurou's face on the TV and glared at the smile across her face as she answered the reporters' questions in a poised manner. As long as she could keep advancing, didn't she care about being shameless?\"Miss Mo, may I ask, the gratitude you just showed Tangning, did that come truly from your heart?\"\"Yes that's right, everyone knows there is a huge competitive streak between you and Tangning. What do you think will be in store for the both of you in the future?\"The people from Creative Century glanced at Mo Yurou, reminding her to think before speaking. If the Artists Director didn't speak up earlier to distract the media, Mo Yurou would be currently in a lot of trouble.Mo Yurou was stunned for a moment, before smiling, \"I am Mo Yurou, I'm not good with words. May I please ask the media to stop making it difficult for me.\"In other words, she was trying to hint that Tangning's words were a beautiful facade. However, in reality, even though Tangning didn't face the media often, whenever she did, she would be hard at work or trying her best to avoid them.But, those that loved to spread rumors held onto this point and claimed that Tangning wasn't sincere. On the other hand, for being so frank, they found Mo Yurou to be quite lovable.\"So, does that mean you have retreated from standing between Han Yufan and Tangning? Do you think they will reconcile? Is that why Tangning won't leave Tianyi? because she's been trying to get back with Han Yufan?\"\"This...you will need to ask Tangning yourself,\" Mo Yurou passed the hot potato onto Tangning. The media assumed, by saying this, Mo Yurou was admitting that Tangning still loved Han Yufan and still thought about him...Most importantly, the media guessed, the reason Mo Yurou left Tianyi was because Tangning's methods were too extreme...She was forced to leave!In an instant, Tangning went from being a pure and innocent artist to someone that was dishonest and sinister. It was like the words from Mo Yurou and Creative Century's mouths were all against Tangning; confirming her ruthlessness.Tangning stopped watching the rest of the interview. After all, it was the same rubbish going around and around...Long Jie looked at Tangning's expression and realized within her eyes, there was a sense of tolerance and wisdom.Tangning liked being like this. She liked staying silent before making a fatal blow on her enemy. If Mo Yurou wanted to go against her......she was still miles from succeeding.\"We should get ready, it's almost time for the awards ceremony...\" Long Jie reminded Tangning as she looked at the Quartz watch around her wrist. \"Don't worry, the evidence and people needed for exposing Mo Yurou of not qualifying for the awards is ready. All you have to do is relax and watch the show.\"\"Tangning, all that you have suffered...we will make Mo Yurou pay it all back at once.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was already 6pm and celebrities were slowly making their way into the ceremony.Mo Ting watched as the models tried to outshine each other, but his attention did not stop on any of them, until...Tangning appeared at the head of the red carpet.She was wearing a long red dress and her arm was elegantly hooked around a 40-something-year-old man's arm; this man was the infamous sleazebag of the entertainment industry...Mo Ting paused the frame temporarily. His narrow eyes carried a quiet, well-experienced aura that was sharp and fear-inducing. He called Lu Che over, \"Help me find information on this man.\"\"President, do we need to warn the madam?\"\"No need, she knows what she is doing and I have faith in her. I am just afraid someone will attack her from behind.\" Mo Ting pressed the remote to resume broadcast. As he turned his head, he revealed the black diamond-like mole on his left ear.Because he had spotted the brooch on Tangning's chest earlier - and he knew she didn't normally like wearing accessories - Mo Ting had a feeling his wife came well prepared....6:10pm. Annual Model Awards Ceremony.Amongst the star-studded event, camera lights were flashing. Tangning endured her body's feelings of rejection and disgust as she hooked her arm on Mr. Li's and stepped out onto the red carpet...This was the first time since her scandal that she had appeared in front of the public. She did not appear to be affected at all by the rumors. She was calm and composed as usual as she maintained a constant smile.How can she remain so calm when her arm is hooked on the arm of a well-known sleazebag?Does she want to take advantage of this opportunity to advance in her career? The media were making their own assumptions. First, it was Star Age, then it was Lin Weisen, wasn't that enough for her?The hosts introduced Tangning and the artist beside her in an exaggerated and excited tone before they headed over to the signing wall and accepted an interview with the media.\"Miss Tang, have you taken notice of the recent news?\"\"In regards to assumptions made about you, would you like to defend yourself?\"\"Your colleague, Mo Yurou, has announced this afternoon that she will be moving to Creative Century. What do you think of this?\"\"An insider has revealed that you've got a big boss backing you up. What's your opinion on this?\"The reporters' questions were like bombs being endlessly thrown at Tangning; she wasn't even given a chance to breathe. However, Tangning did not show a trace of panic; she listened quietly before giving them a smile.\"I am a public figure. In front of the public, I need to be conscious of what I say; one never knows if the words that are coming out of their mouths may affect their fans in any way. A simple word can skew their views on the world. That's why...I prefer to be cautious.\"\"I've seen the discussions online, but...I believe they have the right to voice their opinions.\"\"As for the scandal itself, I believe everyone can make their own judgment; I am confident it will not affect my fans. The reason why I am liked must be because there is something unique about me that everyone is moved by...\"The reporters never expected Tangning would reply to them directly; especially in such an honest and concise way. Just because she had a high EQ, people thought she wasn't being truthful. But by explaining her responsibility as a public figure, she was able to retaliate against these claims. Towards the insults from netizens, she responded with her belief that they had the right to voice their opinion and showed her respect for the truth. And as for her fans, from the beginning, she had already developed a trusting relationship with them...She even pointed out that her fans weren't easy to waver; they liked her because they had discovered something unique about her...The reporters didn't know how to continue as they looked at each other wondering if they should keep making things difficult for her.She had already exposed her heart in front of them, if they were to continue insulting her, that would be unreasonable.So, the reporters fell silent as they took the opportunity instead, to snap a few more photos.Tangning passed the obstacle easily as Mr. Li looked at her with an impressed expression.This was proof enough that Tangning's EQ and IQ was on a level beyond many in the entertainment industry, especially those around her age.\"Miss Tang, you are amazing.\"After entering the venue, Li Yu tried to wrap his arm around Tangning, but she swiftly stepped aside and avoided him, \"You are being too kind, Mr. Li.\"\"Has Mr. Han said anything to you by chance?\" Li Yu tried to test Tangning. Tangning could roughly guess what was going on, but she didn't know what the two had agreed on exactly. So she shook her head as she remained on guard.\"He hasn't told me anything.\"Li Yu wanted to move closer to her, but at this moment, one of the hosts approached the two as he spoke to Tangning, \"Miss Tang, there has been a change to your seating arrangements, please follow me.\"Li Yu looked confused. Tangning was originally meant to sit beside him, why was her seat changed?Who was trying to go against him?Tangning nodded. She had a feeling this was something Mo Ting had done in secret, so she followed the host and sat down at her seat comfortably.The award recipients were seated in the front row, whereas Tangning was seated in the last row. Mo Yurou had entered early on and her eyes were set on Tangning and Li Yu.Li Yu's making a move!\u00a0Mo Yurou sneered.However, she didn't understand why Li Yu walked the red carpet with Tangning, yet did not get to sit next to her; what a shame.Tangning lifted her head and looked towards Mo Yurou; between them, there was only one row.Today, Tangning was to present the Top Ten Model Awards. In other words...Mo Yurou was to receive her trophy from Tangning. But...would she really be able to hold onto this award?In reality, this arrangement was something Mo Yurou had requested from Li Yu. She wanted to take the trophy from Tangning's hands; she wanted to provoke Tangning and make her suffer.She also wanted Tangning to know, Han Yufan - who she had treated like a treasure - had now been thrown away by her like rubbish.You've given up so much for Tianyi, yet, in the end, you've only been a stepping stone for me!Tangning, you were brought to this earth to help other people prepare their wedding dress.The two women smiled to themselves; each deep in their own thoughts. The true victor was about to be revealed!Atop the stage, the ceremony had officially started. The awards at the beginning weren't very important; the important ones were left for the climax. As for The Top Ten Model Awards, that was to be presented in the middle...\"Please welcome our guests, the cutting-edge model Tangning and the artist Li Yu, to the stage to present the next award...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Holding the recipient list in her hand, she approached the stage elegantly as everyone watched. She deliberately avoided Li Yu as they made their way behind the microphone and stood in front of the screen.Below the stage, there was an ocean of stars; Beijing's hottest models had all gathered. As she had the opportunity to stand at such a high position, Tangning realized, as a model, she still had a long way to go.Close by, Mo Yurou's gaze was sharp and proud, containing a sense of disdain and ridicule. She had been looking forward to this day for too long. She was going to take the trophy from Tangning's hands; the hands of a woman who always seemed to fight over everything with her. Once she had this trophy in her hands, it would signify the start of her road to glory.\"Miss Tang has been very famous in both Europe and the US lately because of the Oriental Trend. She is also a model with an extremely promising future, I am truly impressed with your professionalism,\" Li Yu said before he started presenting the award. \"I hope you can continue to work hard.\"\"Thank you, Mr. Li,\" Tangning replied in a calm and polite tone; she had her guard up around Li Yu.\"You are a miracle. Believe me, luck is on your side...\" Li Yu said, hiding a deeper meaning as he gestured for her to announce the recipient list. By allowing her to make the announcement, he was satisfying Mo Yurou's request as well as displaying his respect towards Tangning.Tangning smiled as she opened the envelope in her hands. She pulled out the recipient list and announced, \"The 7th Annual Model Awards Top Ten Model recipients are...\"One after another, model's photos and their names appeared on the big screen showing off some of their best works. Mo Yurou was the last one. From the looks of it, it was obvious she had been forcefully squeezed in. She had crawled her way up and amongst her works on display was the Oriental Trend's magazine cover.Below the stage, everyone giggled. At the sight of the cover, she was once again a joke as everyone was reminded of how she had received no mentions.Tangning looked so alive, while she became a human backdrop.Under the spotlight, the Top Ten Models made their way on stage in the order their names were announced. Meanwhile, ten beautiful female assistants walked out with the ten trophies and flowers. Tangning followed the order and presented the trophies one at a time, from left to right. Mo Yurou was last in line and her heart felt like it was about to stop.She was about to succeed...She was about to succeed really soon...Seeing Tangning stepping closer and closer and hearing the applause of the audience, Mo Yurou felt a little nauseous as her mind became blank. An extreme sense of joy swept over her like a hurricane knocking over everything in its path...Finally, Tangning stood before Mo Yurou. After smiling at her gently, she stretched out her hand, \"Congratulations.\"Afterwards, Tangning handed her a bunch of flowers before presenting the trophy to her. However, just as Mo Yurou stretched out her hand and got a touch of the trophy, a young man urgently ran onto the stage and whispered something into Tangning's ear. Tangning immediately pulled the trophy away from Mo Yurou.Seeing this scene unfold, the audience was stunned...What happened? Why isn't she presenting the award? Why did Tangning take back the award? Isn't Mo Yurou supposed to receive the award?Could it be that Tangning is jealous of Mo Yurou for both receiving an award and signing on with a new company?She can't be that stupid right?Mo Yurou looked at the uproar happening below the stage before looking at Tangning with a cold and frustrated expression, \"Tangning, what is the meaning of this?\"\"Do you really not understand what this means? This award...will not be presented to you,\" Tangning smirked as she replied softly in a definitive manner.Will not be presented...Will not be presented to you...Everyone watched on, confused as to what was happening. Most people were just watching the two put on a show.What exactly happened?While everyone questioned the situation and Mo Yurou looked on in frustration, the man that had whispered something to Tangning, once again approached the stage holding some documents. Rather than presenting the information first, he turned to the audience and announced, \"Mo Yurou is disqualified from receiving the award!\"Mo Yurou was stunned, what was all this?The trophy was already in her hands, why was she disqualified?Subconsciously, Mo Yurou focused her hatred onto Tangning as she accused in a loud voice, \"Tangning, was it you? Did you do something behind-the-scenes? What kind of a rubbish award is this? How can you just disqualify me like that? Where are the judges?\"Mo Yurou released her temper on stage in front of everyone because she couldn't believe the award she had wanted for so long; the award that she had given up so much for; the award she almost had in her hands, was gone, just like that. She wasn't willing to accept it, she couldn't believe it! She reached out her hand and shook Tangning's arm, \"Tangning, did you do this to me? Was it you?\"Tangning let her shake her without retaliation; her arm was starting to get bruised, yet she didn't fight back. Mo Yurou eventually tripped on her own dress and fell to the ground, but no one came to her aid as she was too emotional, \"What is this Annual Model Awards, it has no authority at all, how can they just disqualify someone like this?\"\"I want to sue you, I want you to apologize to me!\"Apologize? Most of the people below the stage looked at her in amusement; she was way too arrogant.\"I will sue you!\" Mo Yurou's sharp voice echoed through the hall.\"Before Miss Mo sues us, I would like to make an announcement on behalf of the Annual Model Awards. On the screen behind me are the rules for the awards selection: pregnant models are not allowed to compete. However, I would like everyone to look at the pregnancy report in my hand. It is clearly stated here that Miss Mo Yurou has been pregnant since July. Which means, she applied for consideration even though she knew she was pregnant; this is what you call lying!\"\"So, after discussions with the organizing committee, we have decided to disqualify Miss Mo Yurou and will be strictly dealing with this shocking behavior,\" the man announced loudly. \"She will become the Annual Model Awards' first blacklisted model. After all this, we will release an official statement...in other words, Miss Mo Yurou should no longer dream of being a model. This lousy artist has not upheld her responsibility to the public.\"Just a few short words was like a rain of grenades; there was no way of avoiding its power.Everyone quickly realized what had happened...Mo Yurou was pregnant...Stealing another person's man and being pregnant before marriage was bad enough, yet she even tried to lie her way into receiving an award!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But, who would have thought she'd be so brave to compete for an award when she was carrying a child.\"The award flew right out of her hands, how pitiful. However, it's what she deserves. A person like her should be taught a lesson and experience falling to her death!\"\"This was a live broadcast, not just a simple bit of humiliation.\"The private whisperings below the stage was a huge contrast to the scene above. Mo Yurou widened her eyes and glared at Tangning, her pupils were filled with a deadly hatred.She had realized, the only person that hated her so much and would take her down like this...was Tangning!Tangning must have known about her pregnancy. She must have kept her knowledge hidden while she planned out the perfect trap.Tangning was too good at enduring and too ruthless!She didn't report Mo Yurou when she was showing off, nor did she retaliate when she was being stepped all over, she waited for a time and place like this to push her into a place of no return; a place so horrible she would rather die...What a clever scheme...Mo Yurou covered her face and cried; she had really underestimated Tangning. She felt regret and pain; how could she have not been wary of her?\"Tangning, how could you be so ruthless?\" Mo Yurou said through gritted teeth as she held back her anger and tears.Tangning looked at Mo Yurou, she was calm and collected. Her eyes were glowing like she was looking at a joke, \"Don't tell me this isn't what you deserve. Mo Yurou, you are officially eliminated.\"Mo Yurou clenched her teeth as she looked at the tricky woman. She suddenly let out a mournful laugh as her body started to feel heavier and heavier...\"Blood...Quick look, Mo Yurou is bleeding, could it be a miscarriage?\"\"Oh god, so her pregnancy is true...how disgusting.\"\"A person like her that steals someone's fiancee then parades around town, deserves to have a miscarriage. This is justice, even God couldn't take it.\"Following the guest's screams, the organizers called for the First Aid nurses. They put her on a stretcher and carried her out while she glared at Tangning. With her lips, she mouthed the words, I am pitiful, but you won't be any better off. You still haven't found out Han Yufan has sold you off yet.Mo Yurou thought Tangning would reveal a sense of fear, but she remained calm; unaffected by her words.Mo Yurou smiled to herself in realization; Tangning had used such extreme measures on her and completely taken her down, as if she would be afraid of one measly Han Yufan.Tangning, oh Tangning, you are terrifying beyond belief!The entire incident was just a small interlude in the ceremony. Mo Yurou was immediately sent to a partner hospital, resulting in the news of her pregnancy and miscarriage spreading to everyone in the country, including all the reporters.Afterwards, the ceremony was temporarily paused for 20 minutes. Once the organizing committee got everything back in order again, they continued the awards presentations. At this time, Tangning had already returned to her seat.Li Yu was sitting on the seat furthest to the left. He got up and weaved through the crowd of people towards the peacefully seated Tangning; he was slightly afraid. He had always thought Tangning was at a disadvantage in the battle with Mo Yurou. But, not until the scene that just happened played out in front of him, did he realize, Tangning wasn't someone he should mess with. It was hard to know how much she could endure and how much support she had behind her.As for Mo Yurou, now that she had been taken down, Li Yu only hoped she would keep their secret hidden as promised. If not, she shouldn't be surprised if he did something ruthless.Awards were presented one after another. After the biggest award of the night was presented, the host stood on the stage with a mysterious smile, \"This year, The Annual Model Awards has introduced a new category: the Special Contribution Award. The recipient for this award was selected based on their skills in all aspects and was specially created for those that had made a special contribution to the fashion industry. Votes were cast anonymously by the judges. Coming up, we will be presenting the Special Contribution Award. Please welcome the guest presenter to the stage, the CEO of Cheng Tian Entertainment, Miss Lan Xi, to announce the recipient.\"Below the stage, the audience erupted in applause; they were curious about this new Special Contribution Award.Not long after, the CEO of Cheng Tian swiftly headed on stage and tore open the secret envelope; the corners of her mouth curved upwards slightly into a smile as she spoke, \"I am honored to be invited to present this award which no one has any idea about.\"\"Th recipient is someone amongst you.\"\"Let us congratulate, the recipient of the Special Contribution Award, Miss Tangning. Please come to the stage to receive your award!\"Tangning!It's actually Tangning!Everyone was stunned as they looked at Tangning. As for Tangning, she was even more stunned than everyone else...Special Contribution Award!\"Tangning, hurry to the stage, they called you,\" the person beside her leaned towards her and spoke. She awoke from her daze. This was something she never expected.\"The front cover of Secret, not only helped a forgotten magazine return to its former glory, it also ignited the Oriental Trend in the European and American markets. It gave the Asian culture a step forward and has made a huge contribution to the promotion of the Asian culture. According to the largest online portal in the US, Tangning's Oriental Trend has broken many records in the magazine industry; beating its opponents by a long stretch. As for Tangning's professional performance, she was able to bring out the charm in the Oriental culture, help foreigners develop an understanding of Asia as well as fall in love with the Oriental Style. So for her, this award is well-deserved!\"On the big screen, the sales numbers of Tangning's Oriental Trend magazine and images of the hype surrounding the Oriental Trend in the foreign market were shown.Everyone below the stage fell silent; they knew, even the most popular models didn't have the ability to achieve the reaction Tangning received...Tangning slowly approached the stage, this was a result she never expected; she was about to receive the Special Contribution Award. She suddenly felt like she wanted to cry...Especially when Cheng Tian's CEO placed the trophy in her hands, she couldn't endure any longer as tears trickled down her cheek.\"Come, give us your speech.\"Tangning approached the microphone, her voice was a little stiff. After a little while, she managed to hold back her emotions as she spoke, \"I really never expected the committee would present this award to me. I feel a little ashamed because when I was shooting for the magazine, I didn't actually think about what kind of contribution I could make, I simply just wanted to do the best I could.\"Tangning lifted her head and stared ahead like she wanted someone in front of the screen to see her clearly...Right now, she really wanted to see Mo Ting; she had so much she wanted to tell him...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing this person who once had so much self-control become impulsive, it was hard not to feel a sense of admiration...Whilst driving his black Rolls Royce, Mo Ting listened to Tangning's acceptance speech as he approached the location of the awards ceremony. The longing he saw in Tangning's eyes, he understood completely.This wasn't an extremely important award, but...it was the first award Tangning received since her comeback. He wanted to be by her side at this moment to acknowledge her hard work...Atop the stage, Tangning was dazzling, however, the words she most wanted to say couldn't be said. She had no way of thanking the most important person in her life; this was her biggest regret!\"Actually, I have a lot I want to say, but all these words can be concluded with one simple sentence: thank you, everyone, I will become even better!\"Below the stage an eruption of applause echoed through the hall. Everyone felt, out of all the awards presented tonight, this was the award they felt was most deserving; Tangning had truly showcased her responsibilities of being a model and set a good example. It turned out, this was the true climax of the awards ceremony...It was because of Tangning!Finally, the ceremony approached its end. Tangning, who had received the Special Contribution Award, did not leave early, she remained seated until the very end.During this time, Li Yu didn't give up on trying to have his way with Tangning. Especially when he saw Tangning receiving her award on stage, her beauty was beyond that of an average model. But...Li Yu knew, the most important thing at hand, was to first go to the hospital. He had to find Mo Yurou and make sure their relationship wouldn't be exposed.The Beijing night sky had never been as bright as it was today; sparkling with superstars. Tangning exited the TV station and spotted Long Jie waiting quietly for her in front of the car. She smiled and quickly ran up to give her a hug.\"Tangning, congratulations. I'm really happy for you.\"\"You have worked hard too, Long Jie,\" Tangning thanked her sincerely. After all, Long Jie had helped a lot in the process of taking down Mo Yurou.\"Let's stop talking. Big Boss has been waiting for you for a long time. I'll take the trophy home. Big Boss should take you for a bit of a drive,\" Long Jie released Tangning from her embrace and gave her a cheeky wink.Tangning lowered her head slightly and spotted the man sitting inside the car; her heart began to race. With the help of Long Jie, Tangning boarded the car.First, the couple drove Long Jie home, before Mo Ting sped out onto the streets of Beijing with Tangning. Tangning's heart was welling up with emotions as she leaned her head on Mo Ting's shoulder and held tightly onto his right hand.\"Aren't you going to ask where I'm taking you?\"\"Anywhere is just as good.\" Tangning stared at the road in front of her, \"I'm just curious. Mo Ting, how can you understand me more than I understand myself? How did you know the person I want to see the most, is you?\"\"Because our hearts are connected.\"Tangning smiled as she tightened her grasp on Mo Ting's hand, \"Find a place with no people and stop the car.\"\"Huh?\"\"I really want to kiss you,\" Tangning said as she admired Mo Ting's face side-on; her eyes sparkled like diamonds.Mo Ting's lips curved up to an attractive angle as he smiled at her, \"We've already arrived.\"Tangning glanced in front of her. That's when she realized the car had stopped on a hilltop with the view of half of Beijing below them sparkling like gems.\"Don't worry, no one can come here except for us.\"Tangning relaxed as she turned her body sideways, hooked her arm around Mo Ting's neck and pulled him in for a kiss. She slowly savored the softness of his lips.Mo Ting supported the back of her head as he applied added force to the kiss; the couple became more passionate until they both felt like they had lost their breath...\"Honey, now that you have received an award, how would you like me to reward you?\"Tangning kissed Mo Ting's ear and gently nibbled the mole on his earlobe. After a little while, she finally responded in a soft voice, \"I don't want anything else but...you.\"Mo Ting laughed gently, \"Are you sure you want to do it here and not on our soft bed at home?\"\"I don't need anything else, all I need is you.\"Hearing these words, Mo Ting immediately lowered his seat, carried Tangning over to his lap and wound up the windows.His big gentle palms carefully undid the zipper on Tangning's back. His every touch sent tingles down her spine as she let out soft moans of pleasure...Tangning was still the same Tangning, but tonight there was something different. Tonight she was a lot more direct and provocative; this drove Mo Ting crazy as he lost control, trying to obtain as much as he could from her body...\"Honey, you have really turned bad...\"\"I told you from the start, I'm not a good person,\" Tangning responded in a husky voice. \"There's so much I want to do with you and say to you, however, when I see you, I find I am speechless because I know - you already understand everything.\"Mo Ting brushed his hand across Tangning's bare back as he remained stuck to her body before gently smiling, \"You don't need to say anymore, let me take you home. This posture isn't exactly the most comfortable for you.\"\"OK,\" Tangning said as she gave Mo Ting one more kiss on the neck....Beijing Hospital. It had been 3 hours since Mo Yurou had been sent into the operating theatre. Creative Century had sent people to hold back the media while Mo Yurou's assistant stood by her bedside; Mo Yurou had just the passed the critical stage and her face was weak.\"Water...water...\"Hearing her cries, her assistant immediately handed her a cup of water, \"Be careful.\"Mo Yurou's mind was finally a little clearer as she stared blankly at the hospital ceiling, \"You Ge, has the awards ceremony ended?\"\"Yes, it ended a while ago. Don't think too much, have a good rest,\" her assistant tried to persuade her caringly.\"Tangning...\" Mo Yurou smiled as tears rolled down her face, \"Did Tangning win?\"\"Yurou, don't be like this. I'll go look for President Han.\"\"No need. Do you think he would still come to see me?\" Mo Yurou held onto her assistant's arm, \"He and that disgusting Mr. Li are both the same...they were both just a game.\"\"That Tangning is a shameless sl*t. I don't know what methods she used to receive a Special Contribution Award.\"As soon as Mo Yurou heard this, she couldn't believe Tangning had received an award. Her mind immediately awoke, \"Award? Ha Ha Ha, award?\"\"Since the world is so heartless, then...I can't be blamed. I won't allow myself to be the only person that is miserable.\" After speaking, Mo Yurou pointed to her phone and spoke, \"You Ge, inside my phone is a photo. It is a photo of an agreement between Han Yufan and Li Yu. Help me expose it and point out that Tangning only received her award because Li Yu bribed the judges for her.\"\"Since I'm destroyed, then let's go down together...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yurou...I don't agree to this!\" her assistant snapped, trying to stop her. \"Even if we are no longer in this industry; even if we have to go back to the life we once led, we'll just suck it up a little. We don't need to sacrifice ourselves to damage the enemy.\"\"You Ge...don't you understand this industry yet?\" Mo Yurou's gaze was filled with sadness, \"Did you think because I've failed, Li Yu will just let me go? He won't! Don't forget, I have evidence against him in my hands, he won't go easy on me. Rather than waiting for that to happen, I might as well take the initiative and attack first.\"\"Do you really...have to do this?\"\"I want Tangning and Han Yufan to go down with me!\" Mo Yurou clenched the pure white bedding in her fist; her eyes looked ruthless and were filled with certainty.Her assistant took a deep breath, he was helpless against Mo Yurou, \"OK, calm down, I'll go organize it now.\"If she wanted to advance like Tangning, it was almost impossible. But, if she wanted to destroy herself, it was much too easy. Mo Yurou's assistant was afraid Han Yufan and Li Yu would find her and blackmail her, so he found a way to get her out of the hospital. Afterwards, they found a place no one knew of and rented a small room. Her assistant took care of her as he contacted some trustworthy reporters; making sure the news they were about to release wouldn't be blocked by any big companies....[Shocking turn of events: Tianyi Entertainment has fallen into a ditch!][The secret behind The Special Contribution Award: Tangning slept with the judges!][Agreement exposed: Tianyi reportedly the dirtiest agency in history!]The scandal between Tianyi and the judges was exposed the next morning throughout Beijing. Details of the agreement signed between the parties involved Mo Yurou, newcomers and also Tangning! The media started making assumptions that Mo Yurou and Tangning received their awards because of 'Judge Li'. They suspected them of doing something under-the-table and claimed they had no right to receive any awards.In an instant, the industry was in an uproar. Tianyi was scolded for being like a brothel, Tangning and Mo Yurou were called sl*ts and Li Yu was called a brothel client...Netizens gathered and made their verbal attacks. The fact that Tianyi and Mo Yurou were involved wasn't surprising; they'd always had a bad reputation, but, they didn't expect Tangning would be like that too. It was just last night that they were happy for Tangning for receiving an award...Because of this, their attacks towards Tangning was the strongest. They claimed Tangning was too good at acting and should go be an actress.Seeing these reports, Han Yufan exploded with anger as he sat in his office. He knew the only person that could get close enough to him to obtain this evidence was Mo Yurou. He couldn't believe Mo Yurou had chosen to sacrifice herself.The news this time came too ferociously and was too shocking, unlike previous rumors. This time...Mo Yurou had evidence and his name was clearly on it; he couldn't deny it. Tianyi was over, and with it went all the hard work he had put in over the years.Staff started handing in their resignations and Tianyi's higher-ups were frustrated. Han Yufan knew deep down, as soon as the board of director's held a meeting, he would be immediately kicked out of the company and be left with nothing.Mo Yurou, you sl*t!Han Yufan phoned Mo Yurou angrily over and over again, he even drove all the way to the hospital, but Mo Yurou had already hid herself away; he had no chance of finding her.In the end, Han Yufan phoned Mo Yurou's assistant threatening him with his family. Finally, Mo Yurou took the phone from her assistant's hand, \"Yufan...\"\"Where are you? Mo Yurou, you sl*t, show yourself!\" If Han Yufan had been hiding his true self all along, then today, he had truly revealed himself, \"Show yourself or I will kill you.\"\"Kill me? Did you think I would be afraid of that at this stage?\" Mo Yurou grunted coldly into the phone. \"Did you think you didn't need to face the consequences of selling me off like that? Han Yufan, thanks to your untrusting personality, you signed this agreement and gave me an opportunity to secure a piece of evidence against all of you. No matter if it's you, Li Yu or Tangning, I want you all to go down with me!\"\"You are crazy!\"\"Crazy? Last night I had a miscarriage. While I was in the operating room, did you even consider the child in my stomach was yours? Did you feel an ounce of guilt? I know you didnt...so, don't blame me for being heartless. Han Yufan, you deserve it.\" After speaking, Mo Yurou hung up the phone. A sinister yet pitiful smile appeared across her pale face.Han Yufan screamed in anger as he smashed everything on the floor...If he didn't cheat in the first place and had chosen to marry Tangning, then the situation right now would not be the same.As for Tangning who didn't do anything wrong, she now had to carry around this scar to her name...She had to carry around the name of being a 'bed-climber'...Han Yufan was helpless and Li Yu refused to answer questions; he was no longer contactable. Li Yu's actions made it obvious, all the under-the-table operations were true; Tangning and Mo Yurou climbing into others' beds was also true...All the media could do was make these assumptions.Hyatt Regency. Tangning watched the TV from the sofa. As she watched the reports about her, she couldn't help but feel overcome by complex emotions.Mo Ting embraced her tightly providing her with support and letting her know not to be afraid.\"Tangning, what should we do now?\" Long Jie asked as she looked worryingly at the news. \"Seems like Mo Yurou has been pushed into a dead end, that's why she decided to go down together. It's OK for her to be destroyed, but what about you? You're innocent and deserved the award, yet things have now turned out like this...\"\"I forced Mo Yurou, so I'm not entirely innocent,\" Tangning mumbled.\"But, Mo Yurou can't be found at the moment, Li Yu isn't responding and Han Yufan obviously has no idea how to deal with this situation. The evidence is already out there, aren't we being too indifferent?\"\"I lacked premeditation, everything ran too smoothly up until now. I've forgotten how painful it is to fall,\" Tangning replied helplessly. Although she had been wary of Li Yu, she never expected, Li Yu and Han Yufan would end up working together.\"There are only two solutions to this. Number one: Look for either Li Yu or Han Yufan. Number two: Announce our relationship,\" Mo Ting reminded Tangning. \"Of course, the best solution is to find Li Yu, but from what I know, he has already left the country to hideout. In that case, we can only go look for Han Yufan. Only the two of them know what other verbal agreements they had made between them. Secondly...\"\"I understand, but even if I look for Han Yufan, he won't help me.\"\"Who told you to look for him? I'll go look for him,\" Mo Ting replied in a serious tone. \"Did you think an incident like this could be dealt in any other way other than with me making an appearance? I am not appearing in front of him as the CEO of Hai Rui Entertainment, but simply...your husband.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will also ask my lawyer to release a statement on my behalf,\" Tangning understood what Mo Ting wanted her to do. With the words 'bed-climbing Tangning' growing ever more vicious, the only people that could deter them were the police.\"You need to be firm with your position. Following on, we will slowly clear your name. Don't be afraid...\" Mo Ting gently stroked Tangning's hair. \"No matter what happens, I'll be right here by your side.\"\"I know,\" Tangning looked at Mo Ting with an assured smile. Compared to being blacklisted by Star King 3 years ago and going from a famous model to nothing in one day, how could this small incident compare?She had pulled through such difficult times. This incident was nothing, especially since she had Mo Ting by her side....\"Tianyi has really gone too far this time. Both their bed-climbing models aren't stepping out to respond, seems it must be true. Cheap sl*ts!\"\"Tangning, I am only 17-years-old and am about to compete in a modeling competition. You were originally my role model, but I never expected you would do something like this; you are disgusting. You should leave the industry and not continue to set a bad example for the youth.\"\"Ehhh...I told you guys ages ago, Tangning is an outdated model. To be able to get to where she is today, she must have had her methods!\"\"Stop talking rubbish. The contract that was exposed only mentioned Tangning's name. I believe in her, she couldn't have done something to disappoint us.\"\"Are you a worm in her stomach? It is because both her EQ and IQ are too high that she has you all consumed in her lies. Grow up, child.\"\"You moronic fans should go die...\"After Tianyi's scandal spread through all forms of media, all the discussions online were filled with hatred. Random people made accusations, using sharp and vicious comments. Meanwhile, loyal fans were too afraid to say anything; worried they would attract even more insults. All they could do was sigh and not let the negativity get to them.It had only been 1-2 hours since the scandal was exposed and people were already using the term 'bed-climbing Tangning' for profit; claiming they had a video of Tangning in bed with someone.The scandal became more and more vicious and had already started to tarnish Tangning's reputation. However, neither Tianyi nor Li Yu stepped out to clear the matter nor apologize; there were zero PR efforts. There was only one simple statement released on the Annual Model Awards website: \"We will do an internal investigation and give the public an answer as soon as possible.\"At this point, no one that had worked with or were about to work with Tangning stepped out to speak for her. Even when they were faced with discussions involving Tangning, they would quickly avoid it.In reality, most people didn't even care about the truth.How could an outdated model become famous throughout the US? And what right did she have to become the spokesperson for an International French brand? Isn't it all because she slept with someone?No one cared about how much hard work was put in and how much suffering it took to get to where she was.This was the cruel reality of the world; especially the entertainment industry.Popularity is a double-edged sword: it can help one overcome obstacles, but at the same time it can stab them until they are dripping in blood.Under such bad circumstances, Lin Weisen made a phone call to Tangning to check on her; proving he was a person with nothing to hide.\"Tangning, are you OK?\"\"I'm fine, thank you, Mr. Lin,\" Tangning was both thankful and apologetic towards him, \"I am so sorry to have implicated you and TQ.\"\"I am confident I have not judged you incorrectly. If you need any help, let me know.\"\"Your trust is already the biggest help,\" Tangning sighed. Adding to the situation right now wasn't hard, but how many people could offer assistance at a time like this?Lin Weisen expressed that he would not be canceling her magazine front cover and would instead wait for her to clear her name to the public.Tangning hung up the phone feeling grateful before turning to Mo Ting, who had stayed at home to keep her company. The couple's relationship was strong and they understood each other.Afterwards, Tangning swiftly started making a move as she asked her lawyer to release a statement on her behalf, \"The 'bed-climbing' scandal was completely fabricated and Tangning has never undertaken in any abnormal activities in the industry. Her relationship with Mr. Li Yu is purely one of passing and has never gone any further than a simple exchange of greetings. Could all those involved please clarify these false rumors or else legal action will be taken against them.\"Apart from this, Tangning also asked her lawyer to release her schedule from the past half a month online. This meant the netizens could examine the schedule and do their own research on her whereabouts.With the release of her statement, the fans that supported her immediately came back alive as they left comments of support under the lawyer's statement. The fans were well aware of their idol's schedule, so they knew all along - there was no way she could do anything with the despicable Mr. Li.Tangning was a model that stayed at home whenever she wasn't working; she barely even attended private events, nor did she ever hang out with friends or go out to dinner.So,\u00a0Tangning's gentle-toned statement and the release of her schedule created a gradual turn of events.However, this wasn't all...At this time, the upright man, Lin Weisen expressed his thoughts in an interview, \"Tangning sleeping with people? Everyone in the industry knows how I am, I detest those that are dishonest and dirty. If she was such a person, I would not be friends with her.\"\"The Tangning I know is extremely professional and thoughtful with a cool personality. She is exceptionally clear where her bottom line stands. If she was really to do such a thing, she would have so much more; why would she need to go look for a disgusting old man?\"\"Don't forget, previously someone framed her for creating hype with the CEO of Hai Rui...and the result? They were blacklisted by Hai Rui. From this, we can see, there is nothing wrong with Tangning's character.\"\"As for the agreement, I also read it. I think we are all clear about how Tianyi has treated Tangning in the past, need I say more?\"With Lin Weisen's words, all the people that were insulting Tangning were furious...They refused to accept his words as they claimed Lin Weisen was a pretentious person.Lin Weisen's response was that he didn't care. To be able to stick up for a friend was worth it.Meanwhile, Hai Rui Entertainment's Artists Director was also in the middle of an interview. Since Hai Rui had previously stepped out to clear Tangning's name in another incident, the media wanted to know their thoughts about Tangning this time. At first, everyone thought the director would ignore any questions about Tangning, but instead, he smiled mysteriously before responding to the reporters, \"You should never look at things from the surface. Just like if one day, you find your name on a suspects list, does that mean you are a murderer?\"\"Isn't it possible you could also be a victim?\"Upon seeing the interview, Tangning was stunned for a moment before turning to Mo Ting, \"Did you get Hai Rui to voice their opinion?\"\"Even Lin Weisen has stepped out to defend you. Did you think I could just watch on without doing anything when my heart is in so much pain?\" Mo Ting placed a kiss on Tangning's forehead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Someone like Mo Ting could have found a smart and beautiful wife; someone that didn't cause him trouble, make him worried or force him to clash with the other people at Hai Rui.However, since they were destined to meet, she was never going to let him go. So, she lowered her head and looked at Mo Ting's right-hand before slipping her fingers between his and enjoying his warmth.\"When a person is in a difficult situation, they become extra vulnerable. If there is something I can do for you, I will do it. And even if I can't, I wouldn't easily give up.\"After hearing these words, Tangning cried and smiled at the same time; her tears forced their way out of her eyes. Because in this entire world, only she knew, how good Mo Ting treated her.Mo Ting was afraid of seeing her cry, but it just so happened this woman of his enjoyed crying, so all he could do was gently pat the back of her head; it was his way of showing comfort and support...Seeing the scene in front of her, Long Jie didn't want to break up the happy atmosphere, but, Han Yufan had already repeatedly rung over ten times. Long Jie hesitated before handing the phone to Tangning.Tangning adjusted her mood. After she calmed down, she picked up the phone, \"What do you want?\"However, all she heard was silence on the other side of the phone. Tangning got impatient. Just as she was about to hang up, Han Yufan finally spoke, \"Tangning...I've been kicked out of the board of directors.\"\"That's how it should be,\" Tangning replied calmly.\"The company will be faced with bankruptcy soon and the court will seize my house and car. I have nowhere to turn now, that's why I've decided to go overseas; I want to take you with me. I've already seen your statement, but it won't do anything, it's just a useless attempt. You won't be able to clear your name!\" Han Yufan quickly blurted out. It seemed he had truly lost everything without the slightest chance of recovery.\"Tangning, as long as you come with me, I won't mind what you've done with Mr. Li. We can go back to how we used to be; we will be happy.\"\"I know you still love me, or else you wouldn't continue staying in Tianyi. Come back to me...\"Hearing this, Tangning revealed an expression of ridicule and mockery. She wanted to know how Han Yufan still had the audacity to say such words.After a few seconds of silence, she responded with a cold voice, \"I remained in Tianyi, not because I love you, but because I wanted to see you suffer.\"\"It's just that I never expected Mo Yurou would be so ruthless that she'd sacrifice herself in order to destroy you.\"\"Han Yufan, you go to hell by yourself, I won't be going with you; no one will be going with you...\"As soon as Tangning's words left her mouth, Han Yufan wanted to respond, but at that moment...Mo Ting spoke beside Tangning's ear, \"I will be going to the study room to handle some things.\"Tangning was stunned for a moment before understanding Mo Ting's intention; he no longer wanted to hide in front of Han Yufan. So, she gently nodded her head and replied to Mo Ting, \"Don't turn the air conditioner on too high.\"\"OK,\" Mo Ting nodded. Although Mo Ting felt quite rest assured to enter the study, he still gave Lu Che a phone call, \"Send someone to keep an eye on Han Yufan. Don't let him go anywhere he shouldn't and don't let him go near the media.\"\"Yes, President.\"After putting down his phone, Mo Ting flipped open the documents beside him like nothing had happened. Did Han Yufan think he could just run off like that after hurting Tangning so many times?Over the phone, Han Yufan heard the voice of a man coming from Tangning's end and heard their affectionate tone of speaking. His voice suddenly turned cold, similar to when he caught Mo Yurou cheating, \"Who was the man just then?\"\"It's none of your business,\" Tanging replied calmly.\"Tangning!\" Han Yufan yelled angrily, \"Tell me, did you really sleep with Li Yu? And are you cohabiting with another man now? How could you be so shameless?\"\"Han Yufan, don't forget, our relationship ended a long time ago. You have no right questioning who I'm with.\"\"We were once engaged...\"\"I'm already married,\" Tangning suddenly cut him off mid-sentence. By using this explosive piece of news, she made Han Yufan completely speechless, \"From now on, my business really has nothing to do with you.\"\"Married? Tangning are you lying? You? Getting married? You think with your current state someone would marry you?\" Han Yufan exclaimed hysterically. Rather than saying he didn't believe a word, in actual fact, he was just lying to himself.On the other side of the phone, the response was complete silence...\"So you're really married?\" Han Yufan brushed his hand across his head; he suddenly felt like a knife had stabbed through his heart. The pain made it hard for him to breathe.This wasn't right, he shouldn't feel this way. He had loved Mo Yurou all along and never had feelings towards Tangning...However, suddenly hearing Tangning had married someone else, Han Yufan felt like his soul had been pulled out of his body and all that was left was an empty shell.No, this can't be, how could this be happening? The Tangning that had followed him around and done everything for him, how could she now belong to someone else?In Han Yufan's heart, he had always been dreaming; a dream that no matter how badly he treated Tangning and how much he hurt her, as long as he waved a finger, she would come running back to him; a dream that all along she only argued with him for the sake of it.However, just a moment ago, Tangning had actually announced she got married...Han Yufan suddenly exploded in laughter as tears sneaked its way out of the corners of his eyes, \"Tangning, would you rather marry an old man than to reconcile with me?\"\"Don't tell me you don't know you are disgusting,\" Tangning's voice got colder.She realized, in Han Yufan's heart, no matter what she did, he would assume she'd done something wrong. He had always been domineering without even the slightest bit of trust or respect for her.\"Then tell me, who did you marry?\"Although Mo Ting had already decided to reveal himself in front of Han Yufan, Tangning didn't want to make her own decisions without consulting him. So she pushed open the study room door, covered the phone and asked Mo Ting, \"Han Yufan wants to know who you are...\"Mo Ting glanced at Tangning's phone. His chestnut-colored eyes looked deeply as he waved Tangning over to sit on his lap. After a little while, he finally responded, \"Let's meet him then...\"\"I will send someone to get him so he can meet me.\"With Mo Ting's identity, he wasn't someone Han Yufan could just rock up casually and see. Han Yufan wasn't worthy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though Tangning had stepped in at a reasonable time to give a response and make PR efforts, she couldn't get the other people involved to cooperate. So, within the complex entertainment industry, her statement quickly got lost and forgotten.Not long after, Tianyi Entertainment released a simple apology letter. However, the letter was useless; not only did it not recover the company's image, it even made the incident drag on for longer.As for the shows\u00a0that Tangning was currently negotiating, the clients decided to replace her with other models. As well as that, all the endorsement events she had already agreed upon suddenly lost contact.\"Tangning? Aiya! Sorry, but we don't dare to use you, we've already replaced you.\"\"Tangning, I don't think your image suits us. Sorry, but we will have to replace you.\"\"Since you're not afraid of climbing into other's beds, why would you be afraid of losing an advertisement?\"These few clients were considered polite, there were a few that cursed straightforwardly.Long Jie put down her phone and looked helplessly at Tangning. Tangning gently pat her on the shoulder, \"It's OK, just don't let Mo Ting know about this.\"\"Do you think Big Boss doesn't already know?\" Long Jie sighed. She understood this industry was all about fame and fortune and the reality was too frightening. \"I'll continue to call, as long as there is still hope,\" after speaking, Long Jie phoned the next number. Surprisingly, they agreed to meet Tangning in person to discuss.However, when Tangning turned up, they asked for her to be a nude model.\"You are being too offensive...\"\"You've already done worse...what's the point of keeping your dignity,\" the man looked at Tangning sleazily. Between his thin eyelids was a look of disregard and mockery.Tangning did not speak. She simply took one look at the man's name card and imprinted the name in her mind. The man felt slightly threatened by Tangning's icy cold gaze as beads of sweat appeared on his forehead.\"Long Jie, help me find out if,\u00a0amongst the media, there is a reporter that is familiar with Li Yu,\" Tangning suddenly instructed Long Jie on the way home. She thought for a bit and continued, \"Look at the agreement between Han Yufan and Li Yu, the first condition is to release Mo Yurou. This must mean Han Yufan already knew about their relationship...\"\"But, the most important point is, when did he find out?\"\"Han Yufan's birthday,\" Tangning carefully searched through her memory and remembered the phone call she had received from Han Yufan. That day was the first time he had asked her to return to his side, \"Long Jie, go find Han Yufan's secretary, she will probably know something about what happened that day...\"\"Also, keep looking into Li Yu.\"\"During the awards ceremony, I already told Mo Yurou we were even. I originally planned to let her go, but...who would have thought she'd go and ruin herself. If that's what she wants, then we'll give it to her then.\"\"We might as well send Han Yufan and Li Yu off to keep her company\u2026\"\"Tangning\u2026\" Long Jie was a little surprised.\"Sorry, my mind has been elsewhere lately, I almost forgot this was an industry where you have to depend on yourself. The mockery from the man just then was like a wake-up call - I\u2019m now fully awake. I know now that if I don\u2019t work hard, I may have to start all over again, or even worse.\"\"I can\u2019t believe, in people\u2019s eyes, I have now stooped as low as a nude model\u2026\"Long Jie looked at Tangning, her eyes were wise and calm; it seemed she was no longer lost and had regained her confidence. When someone gets knocked down, don\u2019t they just get back up again? The worst case scenario was to start again...Online, people were still putting forward their arguments regarding the incident; for example, some people argued the date and time the agreement was signed was not long before the awards ceremony, so there was no way Li Yu had time to convince the judges to give Tangning an award. However, others responded by saying, just because the agreement was signed at that time, didn\u2019t mean Tangning hadn\u2019t already gotten in touch with Li Yu prior to that. The most direct evidence was when they sat next to each other at the Bright Night Gala and even walked the red carpet together...Tangning had a look at the discussions, but they didn\u2019t matter to her as much as what had just happened.She knew she would be able to make these angered people feel embarrassed by the words they were spewing today.After returning to Hyatt Regency, Lu Che was waiting for Tangning at the front door, \"Madam, President has asked me to escort you.\"\"Are we going to Hai Rui?\"\"No, he wants to have lunch together.\"\u2026A little while later, Han Yufan arrived at a restaurant curiously to find Tangning sitting all alone inside. Han Yufan looked at himself and realized how out of place he was; he couldn\u2019t help feeling self-conscious. He realized Tangning looked comfortable and relaxed in this type of setting.The woman that once stood by his side, was now elegant and dignified; she was once someone he disregarded, but now she was like a shining pearl that he couldn\u2019t even get close to.\"You\u2019re here\u2026\" Tangning took a simple glance at him.\"Of course, I had to come see who your new husband is. I really didn\u2019t expect you\u2019d do something so stupid under impulse.\"Tangning lifted her head and looked at Han Yufan\u2019s serious expression; she couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh, \"Han Yufan, you really overestimate yourself.\"\"Don\u2019t tell me your husband is really so tolerant that he can endure all the widespread scandals that are currently going around about you? Even I couldn\u2019t help but suspect that you slept with Li Yu. I really doubt he had no reaction at all!\"\"You\u2019re not worthy of being compared to him,\" Tangning responded in a cold tone. \"Han Yufan, do you know what I\u2019ve been thinking every day since marrying him? I\u2019ve been thinking about all the years we spent together and how although it has already happened and is set in stone, I still regret it deeply.\"\"Even if you regret it, you can\u2019t get rid of it\u2026\"Tangning\u2019s lips twitched; she was about to respond, but\u2026at the entrance to the restaurant, a silhouette had just appeared...Han Yufan recognized the figure straight away, the CEO of Hai Rui Entertainment. Who would have thought he\u2019d run into Mo Ting here.He was well aware of his difference in status compared to this man; Mo Ting could crumble him to pieces without lifting a finger. At that moment, he remembered how Han Ruoxue had previously offended Hai Rui, so he lowered his head and avoided eye contact; even he didn\u2019t understand why he felt this way...Looking at him, Tangning could tell - what he was currently feeling was inferiority.Han Yufan pretended to be looking at Tangning to cover up his awkwardness, while Tangning sneered inside. She then greeted Mo Ting with a gentle smile, \"I\u2019ve already ordered your favorite: steak.\"Mo Ting made his way in front of the two people while Han Yufan stared at him in shock. He gently leaned over and placed a kiss on Tangning\u2019s forehead before sitting down beside her, \"Have you waited long?\"\"I also just arrived.\"\"From now on, I will try my best to be earlier than you.\" Mo Ting stroked Tangning\u2019s hair apologetically. Meanwhile, Han Yufan sat still wishing he could dig a hole for himself to hide...Compared to this man, he was like a poor and disgusting beggar!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His cold piercing eyes were like that of an eagle looking at its prey. His sexy plump lips moved slightly, \"It seems Mr. Han isn\u2019t used to the food here\u2026\"His deep and mellow voice was enough to make anyone\u2019s heart shudder...Han Yufan felt a shiver down his spine as he swallowed nervously. After hearing Mo Ting\u2019s icy cold words, he fell out of his chair and landed on the floor; his embarrassing reaction made it hard for the waitstaff to hold back their laughter.\"You..you guys enjoy your meal, I\u2019m going to leave first\u2026\" Han Yufan wanted to get up off the floor, but...\"You want to go?\" Mo Ting lifted his gaze nonchalantly as he continued, \"Where do you want to go?\"Hearing Mo Ting\u2019s voice, the waitstaff near the exit immediately blocked the doorway. It was obvious, from the moment Han Yufan stepped foot in the restaurant, he wasn't going to leave that easily.\"Didn\u2019t Mr. Han want to see me? We haven\u2019t even spoken much and you already want to leave?\" Mo Ting gently cut the steak in front of him as he took one glance at Han Yufan. After cutting the steak, he thoughtfully placed it in front of Tangning.Han Yufan remained seated on the floor as he trembled; there was no way he could reject Mo Ting.\"I\u2026I can step out to clear Tangning\u2019s name\u2026to make it clear that she didn\u2019t climb into anyone\u2019s bed,\" Han Yufan thought this was what Mo Ting wanted and was the reason he had decided to see him.However, Mo Ting smiled slightly, \"Did you think Tangning needs your help?\" Mo Ting stopped cutting and looked at Han Yufan, \"She hasn\u2019t needed you for a long time\u2026\"\"With me around, you are nothing.\"Han Yufan was frightened; he suddenly realized he had no idea what Mo Ting\u2019s purpose was for seeing him. If it wasn\u2019t because he wanted him to clear Tangning\u2019s name, then what could it be?Did he simply want to\u2026humiliate him?Or perhaps, did Mo Ting want to see him being completely defeated and helpless?\"President Mo\u2026in that case\u2026what do you plan to do with me?\" Han Yufan was too nervous; Mo Ting simply wanted to question him, but Han Yufan somehow felt a sense of danger from his words. He felt his pride had been completely trampled on by Mo Ting.\"Regarding that, you will need to ask my wife\u2026\" Mo Ting turned his head and handed the reigns to Tangning. His tone of voice was caring and gentle - completely different to when he spoke to Han Yufan.Han Yufan suddenly understood Mo Ting\u2019s intention: he was seeking revenge for Tangning!Han Yufan lifted his head and looked at Tangning, the woman that appeared to be unaffected by the world had secretly married the Big Boss of the entertainment industry. His heart was cold as he sneered; he felt all men were the same:\u00a0A man with an identity and status like Mo Ting, could have anyone he wants by his side, how long do you think he would want you?Tangning could see through the mockery in Han Yufan\u2019s eyes, but she didn\u2019t care.\"Tangning, you\u2019ve already turned me into a joke, what else do you want? Just tell me directly. I never expected you were so scheming\u2026\"\"Do you want to know what day Mo Ting and I got married?\"\"August 19th,\" Tangning cut off Han Yufan\u2019s words in a cold tone.After hearing Tangning\u2019s words, Han Yufan looked into her eyes surprisingly.August 19th, that was the day he was supposed to marry Tangning and also the day he abandoned her to be with Mo Yurou. Above all\u2026that was the day he forced Tangning to be Mo Yurou\u2019s substitute at the Crown\u2019s Star Show.\"Then why\u2026why didn\u2019t you use\u2026\"\"Use Mo Ting\u2019s hands to seek revenge on you?\" Tangning continued his question for him; her tone of voice contained a sense of ridicule, \"Because I don't want to dirty Mo Ting's hands.\"After hearing Tangning's words, a cold chill swept through Han Yufan's body.All Tangning had to do, was announce her relationship with Mo Ting and no one would dare look down at her again, yet she chose to endure all the misunderstanding and suffering he had put her through to get to where she was today.She could rely on Mo Ting...But she didn't, why?\"So, you really didn't rely on any dirty methods to get where you are today?\"\"Not everyone is like you and Mo Yurou. Han Yufan, 3 years ago I was the top model in Beijing; now, 3 years later, I can do it again. I will prove myself to everyone. Of course, that includes you...\"Han Yufan listened to Tangning's words and suddenly let out a loud laugh; his laugh was so fake even he felt it was a bit forced, \"Don't tell me the people that know Mo Ting is your husband hasn't treated you differently.\"\"Only you know...\" Tangning stressed as she looked at Han Yufan. \"As of now, you are the only one that knows of our relationship.\"Han Yufan looked at Tangning in shock. In the end, he looked down with a defeated expression, \"I can't believe there is someone like you in this world: you have such a great resource, yet you don't use it. I can't believe there is really someone like you...haha...\"\"In this world, not every relationship is based on using one another; just like the way I once treated you, and from now on, the way I will be treating Mo Ting. I can depend on my own abilities to achieve my goals and get back to the high point I was once at. Maybe to you, he is considered a resource, but to me, my relationship with Mo Ting is not about using one another - this is something you will never understand...\"At this moment, Han Yufan felt like his heart was wounded; he too once owned Tangning's sincere heart, however, he treated her thoughtfulness as a benefit; a requirement; a tool for exchange...So it turned out, without him, Tangning's life was better and more amazing. She could even......marry whoever she wanted.The CEO of Hai Rui. Even if he worked hard for 10 lifetimes, he wouldn't be able to get to Mo Ting's level.How could he be so dumb and stupid to be blinded by Mo Yurou?If he never betrayed Tangning, would everything be different right now?\"I once thought of a thousand ways to torture you, but...who would have thought, Mo Yurou used the worst method. Han Yufan, you've finally lost everything.\"\"I do not wish for anything else, nor do I have the intention to step on you while you're down; I still need to continue on with my life and in the scheme of things, you are nothing. So, Han Yufan, get lost...\" Tangning raised her head; her eyes were colder than before, \"From now on, do not appear anywhere in Beijing and definitely do not appear in front of me!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All he could do was helplessly get up off the floor and leave the restaurant in front of everyone's amused gaze.After leaving the restaurant, he found a secluded spot and punched the wall angrily. But, even though he had his regrets, he could no longer turn back; not only had he lost his status and reputation, he also lost his self-esteem...This was the consequence of cheating and having an affair; it was a choice that he had made and karma followed closely behind him.Not long after, Mo Ting and Tangning also left the restaurant. After holding back for a moment, Han Yufan couldn't help but run after Tangning. However, he was stopped, \"Haven't you given up yet?\"He had almost forgotten, Tangning and Mo Ting were already a married couple, what was the point of him chasing after her? Tangning had already married the best man in Beijing and this man could give her everything she wanted!\"I just want to make up for all that I've done to Tangning, I can do anything...\"\"No need,\" Lu Che said coldly, \"With our president around to protect her, there is no way madam will suffer, please do not make yourself sound on the same level of importance as our president!\"\"No...\"\"Lu Che.\"Tangning seemed to have heard their conversation as she called Lu Che over. After listening to the couple's instructions, Lu Che turned back to Han Yufan and asked, \"The madam wants to know when you discovered there was something going on between Mo Yurou and Li Yu?\"\"Champagne Hotel, Room 3029. I caught them in bed together. The hotel has security footage.\"\"Thanks.\" After responding with one simple word, Tangning closed the car door. She didn't take another single glance at Han Yufan, nor did she turn back.Hearing this reply from Tangning, made Han Yufan feel like a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders as he finally relaxed.Why did he have to get to this point to realize how great Tangning was?Tangning...Tangning...Han Yufan watched as Mo Ting's sports car drove off into the distance, his gaze followed Tangning. However, he gave up all hope, because he knew, there was no way he could steal her from Mo Ting's hands.The truth was, Tangning thanked Han Yufan out of politeness, like she would to a stranger. Most importantly, she wanted Mo Ting to understand where she stood regarding this matter: it was all over and she was going to continue moving forward with Mo Ting by her side.\"Mo Ting...\"\"Don't feel regretful, this is all a part of your past,\" Mo Ting saw through Tangning immediately as he gently touched her cheeks, \"If you can't find relief, then find yourself an excuse: all the suffering you went through, was so that you could meet me.\"Tanging let out a laugh; Mo Ting's words cheered her up, \"President Mo, thank you for being so good to me.\"\"Mrs. Mo, you are being too polite,\" Mo Ting tilted his head and kissed Tangning gently on the ear.Tangning relaxed in Mo Ting's embrace, not worried at all that Han Yufan would reveal their relationship. Apart from knowing no one believed in Han Yufan's words anymore, Mo Ting had already taken precautionary action.Even though Han Yufan was now defeated, Tangning was still stuck in a difficult position.She was still the 'bed-climbing sl*t' on everyone's lips, whereas Mo Yurou and Li Yu had escaped implication.Didn't Mo Yurou always think highly of herself? For the sake of advancing in her career, she would do anything. If she found out Tangning had married Mo Ting, how would she react?Mo Yurou spent most of her life playing tricks and stealing things, yet in the end, she was left empty handed.Maybe because Han Yufan had finally found his conscience, he left Tangning a clue; telling her where he had caught Mo Yurou cheating. However, before Tangning reacted, Mo Ting was already one step ahead, \"Lu Che, send someone to investigate Champagne Hotel, I want all the records of Li Yu's stays.\"At the same time, Long Jie also made a new discovery, \"Tangning, I found a reporter that's been following that jerk for the past 6 months, he has lots of evidence of Li Yu breaking the rules. You will be able to clear your injustice very soon.\"\"Let's take one step at a time.\"Tangning didn't want to get ahead of herself because no matter how much evidence she found, she would still not be able to prove she had received her award fair and square.She still needed time to work on it. However, while she was stressing over this, the organizing committee of the Annual Model Awards released a statement.Firstly, they admitted that Li Yu had indeed violated the rules by partaking in under-the-table operations and The Top Ten Model Awards had accepted fake votes, allowing Mo Yurou to receive an award instead of another model. Towards all this, the organizing committee were extremely apologetic and regretful.Secondly, they wanted to address the Special Contribution Award. The organizing committee listed all the judges involved in selecting the winner; Li Yu's name was not on the list. Most importantly, the award was based on real data and actual influence.Tangning's Oriental Trend indeed remained on the top of search rankings in the US and stirred up the public.Data like this could not be destroyed. Even anti-fans couldn't deny it.Not only did the organizing committee release a statement, at 7pm that night they also held a press conference to answer any questions about the incident.Although the organizers had already stepped out to clear the situation, Tangning knew she was still missing one final piece of evidence.Her innocence and award; she was going to prove both to the public. She was going to prove that all she depended on was her own hard work...\"The reason why this incident has become so viral is not only because it was scandalous, but also because there was someone fueling it secretly,\" Mo Ting said as he looked at the reports given to him by Lu Che.He was clear which media sources Hai Rui had control over and which ones his competitors had control over.\"Look at all these media companies, they are all under Cheng Tian Entertainment. From the looks of it, your show in France really created enemies for you. But don't worry, your innocence will be proven sooner or later.\"Tangning leaned on Mo Ting's body, it was warm and comforting, \"In that case, do you still want me to go to Cheng Tian?\"\"Of course. The only reason why this incident was so difficult to deal with was because you didn't have your own team. Ning...if you want something, would you be afraid to fight with Cheng Tian for it?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Compared to models whose career was smooth sailing, she had experienced her fair share of ups and downs and seen through the darkness of the world. So, what could she be afraid of? Nothing was more painful than being betrayed by a lover, being trampled by a mistress and being cornered by one of the top modeling agencies. Instead, the people that were currently stabbing her in the back should be the ones to be afraid.Thinking of this, Tangning calmed down; the anxiety in her heart also started to fade.\"Honey, you need to know, although Hai Rui belongs to me...I belong to you. So, as long as you are willing, no one in this industry can be your opponent. It's just that you don't want to handle things that way.\"Tangning buried herself deeper in Mo Ting's embrace, trying her best to absorb the warmth from his body - he was like a drug that she couldn't quit. \"Yes, I have you,\" Tangning murmured. After she spoke, she sat up and kissed Mo Ting between the hollows of his neck, \"I want you.\"\"Huh?\" Mo Ting did not hear clearly so gave her a questioning sound as he looked at her curiously.Tangning grabbed Mo Ting's neck and repeated into his ear, \"I want you.\"As soon as her words left her mouth, Mo Ting lifted her up in his arms and headed into the bedroom. Tangning's face swept over with a satisfied smile, she wanted to be intimate with him. She wanted the feeling of having him in her; being able to get closer to his heart and hearing his stable heartbeat....7pm. The press conference for The Annual Model Awards organizing committee was being held under the spotlight. The person-in-charge was sitting on stage waiting to be interviewed; he was specifically here to answer all questions regarding the judge violating the rules at this year's awards selection.\"Is the agreement between Tianyi and the artist, Li Yu, real? Which female artists were involved in the bed-climbing scandal?\"\"Yes, it is real. According to our current investigations, the only artist involved with this scandal was Mo Yurou from Tianyi. Although Tangning was mentioned, she did not break any rules,\" the organizer emphasized the truth.\"How can you guarantee Tangning's innocence?\"\"Even if Li Yu did not take part in the voting process of the Special Contribution Award, how do we know he didn't bribe any of the other judges?\"\"Tianyi Entertainment is a cheap company. For Tangning to get to where she is today, she must have climbed into someone's bed, right?\"Dressed in a suit and leather shoes, the organizer realized what was going on after hearing the reporters' questions: they weren't here to chase the truth or to find out about the judge violating the rules, they were here to make things difficult for Tangning...He was already used to seeing scenes like this; within the industry, it was normal for people to talk badly about each other behind their backs. But, if they wanted to use The Annual Model Awards as a platform to challenge Tangning, they were being too sinister and confident.The organizer smiled slightly before questioning the reporters, \"Our website has already released the voting process for the Special Contribution Award. The most important thing to note is, the model's contribution makes up 70% of the selection points - I think it's clear what Tangning has achieved - only the remaining 30% is made up of the judges' votes. Did you really think that either Tangning or Li Yu have the power to bribe all the judges?\"\"The reason I am sitting here today is because I believe in telling the truth. If the media is here to be selfish; disregarding the truth and manipulating the public, then I'd suggest you use another platform to defame Tangning.\"The few media companies whose true intentions had been revealed quickly avoided eye contact and stopped talking.\"Tianyi Entertainment is indeed cheap, but not everyone from there is bad. For example, if your parents were criminals or gamblers, does that mean you are the same? I have no right to evaluate what type of person Tanging is, but words mean nothing anyway. The fact that you guys have been spreading the word of Tangning climbing into other's beds without evidence, shows that for the sake of getting the public's attention, you've abandoned your conscience. I think you guys are the root of all evil, yet here you are, humiliating Tangning for being a bed-climber; you are merely the pot calling the kettle black...\"\"Regarding any negative effects on the public that happened because of the Annual Model Awards, I want to give my sincere apology on behalf of the organizing committee...\"Tangning was sitting on her sofa at home watching the live broadcast of the press conference in silence. The organizer had actually been so upright and bold to snap at the reporters in front of everyone; in such a difficult situation, they stood up for her innocence.\"It's rare to see someone in this world that is still brave enough to speak the truth.\"As soon as Tangning finished speaking, she received a phone call from Long Jie. The reporter that held evidence against Li Yu refused to cooperate; he was asking for a huge sum of money. It seemed people picked on her because she was kind; even this mere reporter wanted to take advantage of her.\"Long Jie, come back then, I hate being blackmailed,\" Tangning's voice remained calm.\"But...\"\"We will think of something else, trust me...\"Long Jie had no choice but to return empty handed after arguing with the reporter, \"Tangning, reporters like this only want money. Since he can help us - if we don't give him money - he can also turn on us.\"\"If you start him off, he will continue to extort us. If you don't believe me, you can give it a try,\" she was experienced with things like this. Since she was innocent, she had no reason to give away money.\"I understand,\" Long Jie nodded her head; she shouldn't have been so impatient, she almost created trouble for Tangning.If she had really used money, instead of clearing her name, she could have made people suspect there really was something wrong with her...In reality, with the organizing committee's words, Tangning's situation was already changing. After all, she had many loyal fans who continuously pointed out flaws in the incident. At the same time, she also improved her impression amongst the public.Afterwards, Tangning once again released a statement. This time she announced that she had already asked her lawyer to send a letter to Tianyi, suing them for defamation.With the release of this statement, it was obvious Tangning was determined to mend her reputation. During the time her popularity was rising, she had never considered leaving Tianyi, however, Tianyi returned her kindness with ingratitude making her suffer multiple misunderstandings and damaging her reputation.Even so, she did not sue Han Yufan personally, nor did she list all the unfairness Tianyi had given her. All she wanted was to target the negative response she had received from the bed-climbing incident. She was determined to prove she did not violate any rules or climb any beds.Towards Tianyi and Han Yufan, she only had one simple sentence, \"We no longer owe each other.\"Meanwhile, news had gotten out that Tangning was definitely going to leave Tianyi!If that's the case, which agency would she go to now?Sitting in his office, Mo Ting was continuously paying attention to all the predictions from the media. In reality, he wanted so badly to sign Tangning with Hai Rui...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trial Marriage Husband: Need to Work HardCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHowever, Mo Ting also understood, Tangning did not like to take shortcuts - she liked taking things one step at a time.If he was to give her a place in Hai Rui, she would only feel that her position did not come from her own hard work and would feel uneasy. Rather than doing that, it was better for him to keep her company while she grew. Like this, their relationship would also become stronger.His peaceful and sharp gaze turned away from the TV as he gave a gentle cough. Seeing this, Lu Che quickly questioned him, \"Was it because you've been busy all night that you are now feeling sick?\"Mo Ting gently touched his own forehead. His perfectly chiseled face did indeed appear tired under the lights. However, he still instructed Lu Che, \"Don't tell Tangning.\"\"President, you have seriously exceeded your workload,\" Lu Che reminded Mo Ting as he adjusted the black-framed glasses on his nose.\"Cancel the meeting tonight,\" Mo Ting replied simply before ending the conversation. Lu Che nodded and left the office. He had already pulled out his phone, but thinking about Mo Ting's instructions, he could only sigh.This almighty man never allowed anyone to see his weak side; he even hid it from the person closest to him....After Tangning released her statement about suing Tianyi, Tianyi did not respond for quite some time; the person that had taken over from Han Yufan had no experience dealing with urgent matters.No longer owing each other, how was that so?According to evidence presented by fans, Tianyi had used Tangning multiple times to achieve their own goals.From the Crown's Star substitute incident to now, all the suffering Tangning had gone through was hard for anyone to endure. Yet, she was forgiving enough to tell Tianyi they no longer owed each other.Under her current circumstance of constantly being insulted and finding it hard to even fend for herself, she was able to let go of Tianyi so freely; this was clear proof that her character was nothing like the negative rumors. Hence, the shows that had previously paused their jobs with Tangning got in contact with her again and apologized.Meanwhile, a famous radio station invited Tangning to be their special guest.Everything was going well. Although there were still opposing opinions here and there, compared to all the scolding from the previous days, everything Long Jie looked at was a lot more pleasant. She realized Tangning had already stepped out of the storm and clear skies were ahead.7pm. Tangning left home to make her way to the radio station for a quick meeting. However, when she rang Mo Ting, Lu Che answered instead; he said Mo Ting was currently in a meeting, but Tangning could hear a muffled cough coming from the other side of the phone.The voice was not obvious but sounded dry and hoarse. And, although Lu Che quickly hung up the phone, Tangning could sense something was wrong.\"Long Jie, turn the car around, let's go to Hai Rui,\" Tangning suddenly instructed.\"But...we've organized to go to the radio station at 8pm, if we go to Hai Rui, we will not be able to make it,\" Long Jie had a look at the time; she didn't understand Tangning's intention.\"Just go to Hai Rui first,\" Tangning repeated herself.Long Jie was dumbfounded for a moment before obediently turning the car around, \"How about I go to the radio station first to hold onto them while you drive over by yourself?\"\"Tangning, you've only just recovered a bit of popularity and the radio station today is not one you can afford to offend. At this time, you can't have news about you being arrogant.\"Tangning thought for a moment before nodding her head, \"Thank you, Long Jie.\"\"I understand, you are not the type of person to act rashly. I'll get out first,\" Long Jie waved her hand, showing she didn't care; she knew very well what type of person Tangning was. During all this time, she had not been able to help Tangning much, right now she had a rare opportunity to show off her ability.Tangning looked thankfully at Long Jie before moving to the driver's seat. 20 minutes later, she arrived downstairs at Hai Rui and parked her car in a hidden spot.When Lu Che received her phone call, he was extremely confused, but once he got downstairs and saw Tangning standing by the lift, out of breath, he immediately greeted her, \"Madam, why are you here? What happened?\"\"Where's Mo Ting? Take me up...\"\"The president is still in a meeting.\"\"Then I'll go up and wait for him,\" Tangning insisted.Lu Che had no choice - he couldn't just leave Tangning here - so he escorted her through the secret entrance to the CEO's office. Finally, Tangning spotted Mo Ting lying on the sofa, his right hand was covering his eyes from the bright lights.Tangning immediately turned off the main lights and trod lightly towards Mo Ting's side as she placed her hand gently on his forehead...\"He has a fever. Has he seen a doctor yet?\"Lu Che originally thought Tangning had come to find Mo Ting because she was in trouble, but, judging by her anxious expression, he realized she must have caught on during their phone call. After all, Tangning was never the kind of person to request anything from Mo Ting or implicate him.\"Sorry, madam...\" Lu Che apologized sincerely. \"The president refused to go...he said to leave it and it will pass.\"\"He really thinks he's invincible...\" Tangning sighed. \"How about the family doctor? Have you called him?\"Lu Che: \"...\"Just as Tangning was about to make a phone call to the doctor, Mo Ting suddenly woke up. Upon seeing Tangning, he asked her in a hoarse voice, \"Why are you here? Don't you have a meeting at 8pm?\"\"You didn't tell me you were sick. Since I found out, my heart wasn't at ease,\" Tangning replied.\"It's just a little sickness, let me drive you over there now.\" After speaking Mo Ting wanted to get up, but Tangning gently pushed him back down.\"All that other stuff isn't as important as you.\" After speaking, Tangning's eyes reddened; even she was surprised by how worried she was when she found out Mo Ting was sick and even more so, by how angry she was after she realized he was hiding it from her.Mo Ting was stunned. He watched as Tangning's eyes reddened and immediately responded by reaching out his hand to touch her face, \"Really, I'm just a little unwell, you don't need to be worried. I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was a big deal.\"\"Come on, let me drive you over.\"This time Tangning did not refuse. She helped Mo Ting stand up, \"Anything regarding you, no matter how small, matters to me.\"\"Plus, between a husband and wife, it's because of not caring about small issues, that they slowly build up into big issues.\"\"I can go, but on the way, you need to buy medicine and I have to watch you take it.\"Tangning's attitude was firm. Looking at her, Mo Ting felt like his armor had been sliced open. He wasn't angry, all he could do was admit defeat.He couldn't continue to act strong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trial Marriage Husband: Need to Work HardCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the way to the radio station, Tangning got out of the car halfway to buy some medicine and fetch some warm water; only after she watched Mo Ting take the medicine did she feel rest assured. Mo Ting looked at the anxious look on her face and revealed a slight smile, \"I've already taken the medicine, are you still angry?\"\"Next time this happens, are you not going to tell me again?\" Tangning stared at him and asked.\"I know you are strong and can always find a way to tackle a problem. You only ever allow people to see the good side of you. However, true married couples should be able to rely on each other when they are at their weakest. You might think it's a small issue, but it still makes me worried...\"\"Mo Ting, the type of love I want is not complex. I just want a person that cares about me and that I can also care for in return.\"After hearing her words, Mo Ting was silent for a couple seconds before he reached out his arms and pulled her into his embrace, \"I won't hide this from you again...I will listen to you.\"Tangning gently punched Mo Ting's chest in protest before tightly wrapping her arms around his waist.As the king of an entertainment empire, it was normal for Mo Ting to make decisions without batting an eyelid. After all, this was a cruel world and the entertainment industry was probably the cruelest industry of all. Although he hadn't gotten to the stage of being fake, he was still not the kind of person to show his true self to others. However, the woman in his arms......was so anxious over a simple flu...It was like she had displayed the most basic and pure form of human interaction to him.That's right...if you love someone, then go ahead and express your love, whine in front of them, get angry in front of them and give all you have to them. Why must you hold back even in front of the person you love?The couple happily embraced each other in silence, like they were absorbing each other's warmth. A moment later, the alarm on Tangning's phone went off, it was 7:50pm; the meeting at the radio station was about to start, but Tangning was still on her way...Tangning furrowed her eyebrows but didn't say a word. However, Mo Ting took the phone from her hands and said, \"I won't let you suffer...\"...Inside the meeting room of the radio station.The station manager, announcer and other guests had already arrived, however, Tangning had yet to make an appearance. The station manager glanced at Long Jie who was sitting in Tangning's seat, a look of disgust flashed across his face. Long Jie's heart sank, she had a bad feeling.This radio station was very famous in the industry. Although their radio show wasn't broadcasted live, they still had a great reputation because of its fine production and workflow.Naturally, there were plenty of celebrities that wanted to go on this show. As a slightly famous model, Tangning had the least amount of influence amongst the 4 guests that had been invited, yet she was uncaring enough to only have her assistant attend the meeting.The station manager was a 30-something-year-old man. As he already had a bit of white hair, he appeared a lot older than he was. He pointed at Long Jie and said, \"Fatty, you can go. And tell your model she will never get the chance to go on our show again.\"It's not that Long Jie didn't try to save the situation, but the man was unwilling to listen to her. No matter what the reason was, if someone didn't show up at the organized time, to him, it simply meant they weren't professional enough and had no work ethics.The other people in the room also looked at Long Jie impatiently. It was like they were telling her to hurry up and leave so she could stop delaying the progress of their work. Everyone had rushed over from various locations, Tangning wasn't the only one that was busy...Long Jie unwillingly got up out of her seat. Just as she was about to leave, Tangning arrived at the doorway trying to catch her breath, \"Sorry, I'm late.\"Seeing Tangning, the station manager stood up and yelled at her angrily, \"Do you think this is a marketplace where you can arrive at whatever time you want? Tangning, let me tell you, take your assistant and leave. For a person that depends on bed-climbing rumors to get famous, how dare you treat yourself like someone of importance!\"Tangning was dumbfounded for a moment before calming herself down and pulling Long Jie to her side, \"Let's leave immediately.\"\"Tangning...\"\"It's OK,\" Tangning shook her head as she looked at the people in the meeting room. She didn't feel humiliated at all as she walked out in confidence.\"That's the first person to be late for one of my shows! Who does she think she is?\" After releasing his anger, he returned to his seat to continue the meeting. However, at this moment, his assistant walked in with a man.The man was dressed in a tidy suit and had a pair of black-framed glasses perched atop his nose.\"Assistant Lu Che, it's you. I didn't know you'd be coming, sorry I didn't come out to greet you...\" the station manager stood up and greeted Lu Che respectfully.\"No need to be polite. I am here on behalf of President Mo to announce something: Hai Rui has decided to end its sponsorship for this radio station.\"The man was stunned; when did he get on Mo Ting's bad side? He quickly invited Lu Che outside for a talk, \"What...what is the meaning of this? The show is going well...did we do something Mo Ting isn't pleased with?\"\"Since you won't give other people an opportunity to explain, our president can also do the same to you. That model, Tangning, was late because of our president. It's OK for her not to go on your show, but our president has to return her favor. So...let's just say: you guys are out of luck.\"After hearing it was because of Tangning, the man felt a chill down his spine...All his results over the years had given him a proud personality; he had long forgotten how to give others a chance...Who would have thought he'd be faced with this challenge.\"Assistant Lu Che, can you please help me plea to the president? We can't just stop this show...\"\"To President Mo, stopping a show simply means a new show will start...\"\"I will take note, from now on I will no longer be so arrogant,\" the station manager's forehead was already breaking out in a cold sweat. This was his career...something he had worked hard on; he couldn't just give it up.\"She was only late by less than a minute. It's bad enough that you asked her to leave without letting her explain herself, was it necessary to insult her? You can call Tangning yourself and beg for forgiveness. Also, President Mo doesn't want to hear any ridiculous rumors, so watch what you say.\"Just thinking of having to contact Tangning, the man was reminded of how arrogant he was when he told her to leave. He didn't want to do it. But, for the sake of the show and to not offend Hai Rui, he immediately asked for Tangning's contact details from his assistant.Long Jie picked up the phone, they were already back at the car. The station manager requested for them to return, his tone was a lot nicer than before...Tangning received the phone from Long Jie and listened as the man spoke, \"Miss Tang, I was too impulsive; I didn't ask for your explanation before talking to you in such a rude way, I am extremely apologetic. Can you please come back?\"\"Today, I was indeed late, you don't need to be sorry. It's a shame I won't be going on your show...\"\"Then...what about President Mo...\"Tangning suddenly remembered what this man had said about her bed-climbing earlier, so her voice became cold, \"Since I have paid for my mistake, you must also face the consequences of your words!\"This station manager and the man that had asked her to be a nude model...She remembered them clearly...Just because she was polite, it didn't mean she had no temper. Since the bed-climbing incident had been turned around, it was also time...for her to fight back!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But, that didn't mean Tangning couldn't do anything to them...She had not completely rid herself of the words, bed-climbing, yet.\"Tangning, all the magazines and runway endorsements have gotten in contact again. What are your thoughts?\" Long Jie asked as she browsed through Tangning's emails.\"Reply to them and tell them I need some time to rest and won't be taking on any jobs. Mo Ting said Cheng Tian Entertainment will be holding auditions in the next few days, so I want to prepare myself. Plus, I also have other things I want to sort out,\" Tangning replied after having a quick look through the emails.Long Jie looked straight into Tangning's eyes. Although, as usual, she couldn't see completely through Tangning, after their years of cooperation, she could roughly guess what Tangning was thinking.\"Are you referring to Mo Yurou? That woman seems to have turned to dust...\"\"If we want to know where she is, it's not hard. After all, her assistant is married and has a family to take care of. Long Jie, help me find her and tell her there is a big company looking to sign with her.\"\"And you are that big company, right?\" Long Jie tested Tangning.\"She is the same as Han Yufan...she can't prove my innocence. But, she can't continue to be like this; she can't do what she wants and cause problems as she pleases,\" Tangning replied after thinking for a bit. Although her tone was quite gentle, Long Jie could sense the viciousness in her words.If someone else had defamed Tangning, she may not have taken things to the extreme, but...people like Mo Yurou only appeared to be pitiful on the outside; in reality, they were not worthy of sympathy.Seeing Tangning like this, a scary sense of realization suddenly crossed Long Jie's mind: after the bed-climbing incident, Tangning had become more ruthless and clear-minded.Just looking at how she sued Tianyi, for example, a normal person would have battled with Tianyi and Han Yufan to the end - after all, Han Yufan was the main perpetrator - but instead, she chose to tell them they no longer owed each other after her name was cleared by the Annual Model Awards.If she didn't go after Han Yufan, netizens would have said she was feeling guilty so she wasn't brave enough to sue him.However, if she did go after him, she would have been placed under the firing line. After all, her previous relationship with Han Yufan couldn't be erased from everyone's minds. As a result, scandals would have arisen about her being shameless and fighting with her ex.Putting on a strong fight would only attract strong reactions and the power of online would only make the situation more complex. So, she sued them, but she held back a little by letting her ex off the hook.This showed how classy she was. On the other hand, Han Yufan, who appeared to have disappeared, was getting scolded even more online.By doing this, all the anti-fans that were prepared to cause chaos, suddenly realized they were merely punching cotton.Their punches didn't make much impact at all!If the words that the Annual Model Awards organizing committee had put in for her left netizens in an unsure position of whether to trust her, then the way she dealt with Tianyi gave them that one last nudge to her side.After all, she had been clear about her standpoint from the beginning.A person with both manners and class, even if she didn't receive an applause, would still bring people to a point of realization...so, in this battle, she was the winner.From this point onwards, this was the true beginning of her counterattack!\"Tangning...I really haven't gotten to know you well enough over the years.\" Long Jie knew Tangning wasn't stupid, she had just been too emotional and that's why she gave all she had to Han Yufan.However, she was now awoken. With all the pain she had gone through, her ability to deal with things had naturally improved.\"Are you familiar with me now?\" Tangning gently laughed, revealing a vulnerable smile; Long Jie was in a daze.This was how she was in front of her own people; her enthusiasm always came from the heart.\"I'll go look for news on Mo Yurou.\"Tangning nodded as she prepared some plain congee and vegetables and took them to the bedroom. Mo Ting had just awoken, he was so hot his body was covered in sweat, so he opened up his robe and leaned back on the bedhead to read some documents.\"You really can't rest can you?\"\"I'm just checking out the artists that belong to Cheng Tian Entertainment.\" Mo Ting reached out his hands and pulled her into his arms.\"Why are you suddenly curious about that?\"\"The same as usual...\"\"You can only be rest assured once you have everything in the palm of your hands, that's why you are so tired.\" Tangning picked up the towel sitting on the bedside table and helped wipe the sweat off Mo Ting's body.\"Judging by your character, I expect you to have rejected all your previous jobs. After all, with your current status, you don't need to turn back. If you want to go to Cheng Tian, I will definitely prepare to stand guard. This has nothing to do with whether I'm tired; I don't stress myself over other people.\"After hearing him, Tangning was dumbfounded...Indeed, the person that understood her the most was Mo Ting. Even though she hadn't communicated anything to him, he still knew her intentions. Even Long Jie, who had been with her for so many years, was slow on the uptake.Tangning placed her delicate face upon Mo Ting's chest and murmured, \"Back then, was this how you became the CEO of Hai Rui?\"\"Yes, and this was how I advanced one step at a time.\"This was why they could sympathize with each other and could understand each other's difficulties and methods. Even if she used schemes, he understood the cruel hardships she was facing.\"Honey, if you want to make me sweat, you don't need to stick to me like this...there are other methods.\" Mo Ting was originally feeling hot, but with the addition of his little wife in his arms, his body couldn't help but react.However, thinking about how he was sick, he didn't want to infect Tangning, so he gently pushed her away, \"I'm going to go have a shower.\"Tangning looked at Mo Ting questioningly.\"I'm afraid of infecting you...\"Tangning smiled as she swiftly pushed Mo Ting back on the bed and pinned him under her body, \"Then so be it...this can be considered as sharing our joys and hardships...\"Although the sick Mo Ting didn't look like he normally did, he still unexpectedly made Tangning want him...thinking about this, Tangning removed Mo Ting's robe revealing his sweaty chest.Mo Ting's face was indeed slightly pale, but...within his deep eyes, there was still an amused look, especially when Tangning took the initiative.It seemed, it wasn't bad to be sick; he was obviously receiving more benefits than he normally did...Being with Tangning, he was both physically and mentally satisfied. After all, with their mutual protection of each other, how could anyone not like it?During this happy night, however, Mo Yurou was still hidden in her rental home; she practically never left the apartment. Seeing the entertainment news, she was devastated; the incident had become viral and she was in the heat of it. Whereas, everything was going good for Tangning...So good that she was a bit jealous!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His wife is still quite young and all she is doing is playing games in her room.\"\"How sick is she?\" Tangning furrowed her brows. How important was Mo Yurou to this man, for him to care about her so much?\"She won't stop crying and seems to be having both a fever and the chills. This poor child.\"Tangning could hear the crying coming through the phone. If they hadn't come across this child, then it wouldn't have concerned them, but since Long Jie was witnessing this situation, she instructed her, \"Take her to the hospital and pay for the bills.\"Long Jie understood, so she quickly called the ambulance to take the child to emergency. While they were leaving, the child's mother was still watching a movie with her headphones on.\"This child had such a high fever she almost had pneumonia, what were you adults doing?\" the doctor asked Long Jie as he examined the child's body.Just as Long Jie was about to respond, Mo Yurou's assistant rushed over and looked at his daughter anxiously, \"Doctor, how is my daughter?\"\"Lucky she arrived in time or else it would have developed into pneumonia!\"After hearing his daughter was OK, You Lin gave a sigh of relief. However, when he turned his head and saw Long Jie, he was cautious, \"What are you doing here?\"\"She was the one that brought your daughter to the hospital,\" the doctor explained after figuring out the relationship between the three.You Lin had mixed feelings. After seeing his daughter had fallen asleep, he pulled Long Jie outside, \"What is the meaning of this? Are you trying to find out the whereabouts of Mo Yurou? Let me tell you, it's impossible!\"Long Jie scoffed as she pulled out some cash from her wallet and handed it to You Lin, \"Tangning instructed me to send this child to the hospital. This money is also from Tangning, she told me to give it to you. You Lin, do you know which part of you I look down on? You've given Mo Yurou everything, but has she even considered the circumstances of you and your daughter? In the end, you needed the help of your enemy to save you...\"You Lin looked at the cash in his hands. He thought about how even in her current state, Mo Yurou still wanted to live in luxury. Thinking of her greedy expression, You Lin held back for a moment before speaking up, \"Thank you for saving my daughter. I will help you guys just this once to repay your favor.\"Long Jie turned around and looked into You Lin's eyes. As expected, a person like Mo Yurou couldn't keep even her most loyal dog by her side; she deserved to be abandoned...\"You Lin lied to Mo Yurou that he found a big boss that is willing to sign her on as the front cover model of a men's magazine. After hearing this, Mo Yurou was extremely excited. We've already arranged to meet 7pm tonight at Glory Hotel.\"\"Long Jie, it's been hard on you,\" Tangning's voice was calm like she had everything under control.\"Not hard at all. I also want to see Mo Yurou's fate.\"...Tangning continued to receive invites from multiple companies, and as usual, she continued to decline them by saying she was resting. Her response to most companies was polite, except for one. In response to one particular company, she instructed Long Jie to give them a name and thank them for personally inviting Tangning there for an interview.After hearing this, the editor of the magazine immediately went to investigate the name he was given. It turned out the b*stard had invited Tangning to be a nude model!In the fashion industry, offending others was a huge taboo. Who would have thought, that b*stard had asked her to be a nude model!\"You don't need to work here anymore, get lost! At that time, we were indeed trying to avoid being implicated by the bed-climbing incident so we declined working with Tangning, but it was bad enough that we canceled the contract, you even wanted to make her a nude model? What did I say at the time? I told you to stay away from her, yet what stupid thing did you do?\"\"Editor...I was wrong...\" the man was taken aback. He didn't expect karma to hit him so quickly.\"Hurry and get lost...her assistant already remembers your name, do you think you can still survive in this industry?\"Because of the incident that recently happened, everyone in the magazine industry was in awe of Tangning.To be able to climb out of a situation like the bed-climbing scandal, how could a normal person do that?...5pm. Hyatt Regency.Mo Ting was still in the early stages of his sickness as he sat in the study room dealing with some important business. Lu Che arrived from the office with some documents. They were records of Li Yu's whereabouts over the past month; the records were extremely detailed. It seemed Lu Che had put in a lot of effort to get this information. Of course, the information Hai Rui wanted was confidential and no one knew about it.\"Have you guys finished?\" Tangning pushed open the door and asked as she pointed to her watch.\"You've come just in time, come here,\" Mo Ting waved her over. After she arrived by his side, he pulled her into his arms and showed her the information on his laptop, \"This old artist has supported 4 models in the last month. Amongst them is a model from Cheng Tian.\"Tangning looked at the extremely detailed report and scrunched up her eyebrows, \"Jerk.\"\"No matter what, with this report, we can clearly prove your innocence.\"\"President Mo, you can really find out everything,\" Tangning was a little surprised. She turned her head and looked at Mo Ting in disbelief, \"Don't tell me you've hired the police to be your paparazzi?\"\"This old sleazebag has gotten used to sleeping around; he isn't very discreet. If I want to investigate him, it's not hard, I just need to waste a bit of time.\"Tangning browsed through the information and looked at the names of all the models that were involved. She was quite surprised, but of course, she couldn't reveal everything. By revealing it, she would prove her innocence, but...she would also implicate all these other models.She couldn't do that because she would be making too many enemies and creating too many hidden dangers for herself. Plus, the models involved had never done anything bad to her, so she only needed to target a few specific people.\"This report came too late,\" Mo Ting was actually heartbroken that he hadn't presented this report back when Tangning was being defamed, making her go through so much pain and suffering.Tangning was dumbfounded for a moment before shaking her head, \"It's never too late for the truth.\"\"The bed-climbing scandal was started by Mo Yurou, however, the huge number of anti-fans and marketing around the scandal...\"\"...was created by people at Cheng Tian. The manager, Yang Jing, really has her methods,\" Tangning was aware she had stepped on someone's toes.\"I know you will make good use of this report,\" Mo Ting wasn't worried at all. Afterwards, he had a look at the time and realized it was already 5:30pm, so he quickly reminded Tangning, \"Don't you need to go see Mo Yurou? Why aren't you getting ready?\"\"Are you OK to be at home by yourself?\" Tangning gently stroked Mo Ting's handsome face.\"Silly.\"Tangning smiled. The couple hugged each other affectionately before Tangning left the study room. After she left, Mo Ting picked up his phone and rang Lu Che, \"Check that there are no reporters or any hidden dangers in and around Glory Hotel. Also, Lu Che, you may need to do some overtime.\"\"President, do you want to...\"\"Of course I want to personally go support my wife.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Trial Marriage Husband: Need to Work HardCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Beijing night sky was filled with twinkling stars. As she hadn't left her room in days, Mo Yurou stared eagerly at the sky. Ever since her abortion, her body had been weak; to hide from the media, she hadn't had the chance to go to the hospital for an examination.Of course, she also didn't have the money!\"You Ge, wait until I recover my jobs, I will buy the property beside Xiangxi River. When that time comes, we can go back to how we once were and live the wealthy life. I have faith, all this suffering has not knocked me down. Since we've escaped death, I'm sure good things are awaiting us.\"You Lin didn't speak, he just revealed a forceful smile.\"Are you still angry? I only took your money to buy clothes, do you need to give me attitude?\"You Lin remained quiet. The money was given by Tangning so he could take his daughter to the doctor...However, Mo Yurou took his money without a word and went to buy clothes and accessories.\"Yurou, what do you think of how I've treated you over the years?\" after enduring for a while, You Lin could no longer hold back. His voice trembled a little, but he hid it well.\"Good...\" Mo Yurou responded casually, \"Do you need to ask me this? I am about to go shoot a magazine. When I make the money, I'll give it back to you, why are you so petty?\"You Lin looked straight ahead; his throat was dry and burningHe finally understood the difference between Mo Yurou and Tangning. While Mo Yurou was doing whatever she wanted, Tangning was planning out her future. Although he knew he was also a part of Tangning's plan, he was still willing to do things for her, because she treated him like a person - that was one of the most impressive things about Tangning.\"That was money I needed to save my daughter,\" after a while You Lin finally spoke up. His voice was filled with sadness.Mo Yurou was stunned for a moment before turning to look at You Lin, \"Well, I used it already, what can you do about it? Isn't your wife at home? If I dress all sloppy, people will look down at me...\"You Lin's face turned pale. Mo Yurou's narcissism was overwhelming. She had already reached this point, she was already known as a bed-climber, why couldn't she reflect on her own actions and change? Was pride really that important?Not long after, the two finally arrived at Glory Hotel's entrance. For the sake of her pride, she even hired a car.As usual, Mo Yurou acted like a big-shot; wherever she went, it was like she was a superstar making an appearance. Maybe this was Mo Yurou's only way of clinging onto her pride. It seemed, even at this point she still did not want to admit defeat...The two people entered the main hall of the hotel, however, the staff behind them were pointing and whispering.\"Isn't that the bed-climbing model, Mo Yurou?\"\"It's her, yes it's her. Amazing, she just had an abortion and she's already out looking for her next target.\"\"Seems like there's something new to gossip about...\"It's not that Mo Yurou didn't hear them, she just simply gave a \"hmmph\" and pretended like she didn't care.Afterwards, the two entered the room they had agreed to meet in. However, from the moment Mo Yurou entered the room, she ended up waiting for 2 hours. Her face went from full of confidence to a lifeless expression, \"You Ge, do you think they're not coming?\"You Lin was silent. Deep down he knew they would definitely be making an appearance.\"Don't worry, they will definitely come.\"Mo Yurou tried her best to endure, until finally, a hotel staff pushed open the door. She focused her gaze and was surprised to see Tangning and Long Jie. Mo Yurou's heart nearly jumped out of her chest as she stood up and pointed at Tangning, \"Tangning, you are amazing! How could you fight with me over even a men's magazine front cover?\"Tangning was silent, her expression was calm as usual. However, Long Jie couldn't help but giggle behind her, \"Does our Tangning need to fight with you over a magazine that doesn't even exist?\"\"What do you mean?\"\"What I mean is, the boss of the magazine is Tangning,\" Long Jie told Mo Yurou in a pitying tone.Mo Yurou suddenly turned her head to look at You Lin as You Lin looked back at her sadly. Their eyes met. Mo Yurou's expression was one of disbelief, \"You...betrayed me?\"You Lin scoffed as he shook his head. His voice was calm, \"The word betray doesn't sound too good. Mo Yurou, I've already done all I can for you, yet you even took my daughter's life-saving money. I really don't owe you anything.\"Mo Yurou looked at You Lin angrily, at the man that once promised he would never leave her; she was so angry her heart felt like it was about to burst open.\"Is it really because your daughter's sick? Isn't it because I no longer have money and power? Don't you dare use your daughter as an excuse.\"Tangning glanced at Long Jie. Long Jie immediately pulled a card out from her wallet and handed it to You Lin, \"There's not much money in here, but there is enough to save your daughter.\"You Lin's hand trembled as he received the card. He swallowed and responded, \"Thank you.\"\"Are you crazy? You Lin? How dare you betray me because of money? I hope your daughter dies a painful death!\"You Lin never expected Mo Yurou would say such horrible words. So he sneered and replied honestly, \"Mo Yurou, truthfully, you can never win against Tangning. You just wait and see.\"After speaking, You Lin stumbled out of the hotel, leaving the trio behind.Tangning remained calm. Even at this time, she didn't reveal any trace of emotion.Mo Yurou, on the other hand......was extremely cautious.The fact that Tangning had made her stay must be because she had something bad planned. So she quickly looked around, afraid that there was a hidden camera or voice recorder.\"Tangning, what do you want to do with me?\" Mo Yurou was on her own, so she was cautious. After all, Tangning also had Long Jie and everything in front of her was possibly a trap.\"Don't be so anxious, Mo Yurou. Just act like you normally do. I just want to share my thoughts with you; I feel like we have a lot to talk about.\"\"What do you want to talk about? About how I stole Han Yufan from you? Tangning, even if you are more powerful than me at the moment, you can't change the fact that I stole Han Yufan from you,\" Mo Yurou said to Tangning; forcing herself to be brave.It's not that she was afraid of defeat. She was just afraid of being defeated by Tangning!The thing she wanted the least, was for Tangning to see her live such a hopeless life.\"Do you know how intimately affectionate we were the night before you and Han Yufan were to get married? He said you were shamelessly following him around, he was sick of you!\"Mo Yurou thought she could anger Tangning, but...\"Actually, I really should thank you...\" Tangning sat on a chair and looked at Mo Yurou with a smile, \"Because you must not know...on the day you pretended to be injured and prevented Han Yufan from marrying me, I...ended up marrying someone else.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
