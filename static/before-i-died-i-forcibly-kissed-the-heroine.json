    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 \u2013 You can only become the protagonist after going through a lot of hardship and hard work.\u201cDo you have any last words?\u201dUnder the moonlight, Zhan Qingchen stood with her sword pointed above his head, staring down at Shu Shi.Shu Shi was lying on the ground, his chest had been pierced, blood rushing out like a fountain that instantly dyed the surrounding ground red.A direct hit to the heart, his death was certain.Judging from the wound, he would not survive less than half a burning incense stick.\u201cIt\u2019s finally all over\u2026\u201dShu Shi was a transmigrator.He was forcibly transferred to the cultivation world.But unfortunately, he was not the protagonist of this story.As a villain, his role was merely a tool to draw hatred from everyone.Destined to be a tool, he knew what fate awaited him.Fortunately, Shu Shi got the system.According to the system prompt, as long as he played a role based on the plot and eventually died under the heroine\u2019s sword, he would be reborn as the protagonist in another world.And finally that day came!\u201cYou can only become a protagonist after going through a lot of hardship and hard work!\u201d\u201cFinally, it\u2019s my turn to have some fun!\u201dZhan Qingchen slightly furrowed her brows and asked in surprise \u201cYou\u2019re going to die soon, how can you still laugh?\u201dCould this man be going crazy?Shu Shi returned to his senses.The woman in front of him was wearing a white dress, her facial expression was cold, and she looked like an extravagant fairy under the moonlight.Zhan Qingchen.She was the chief disciple of Tianji Pavilion, the number one genius of Linlang Kingdom.She had already practiced Qi at the age of eight, built a foundation at the age of 10, and entered the Realm of Golden Elixir at the age of 21!Her beauty was alluring, her temperament was refined, and she had been in the top five of the Stunning Beauties list for many years, and had countless fans from various countries.She was the perfect heroine template.They were both mortal enemies who had fought openly or secretly.But how can a villain be her enemy?Although Shu Shi had all sorts of means, all he could do was obey the plot arranged and pressured by Zhan Qingchen from all directions.Recalling the humiliation he suffered so far, Shu Shi felt hatred in his heart.\u201cI\u2019m going to die soon anyway, it\u2019s better to leave a memory for her.\u201dShu Shi\u2019s eyes rolled, and he said with a cough.\u201cCough, cough! Come closer, I have something to say.\u201dZhan Qingchen hesitated for a moment, but immediately moved towards him.If someone was about to die, his last words usually had an important meaning.After all, this devilish demon had only one breath left, so there was no harm in letting him finish his last words.\u201cCloser, I don\u2019t have the strength to speak out loud.\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s just consider it a good deed.\u201dZhan Qingchen leaned over slightly and turned her ears.\u201cGo ahead, I\u2019m listening.\u201d\u201cActually\u2026.\u201dShu Shi suddenly grabbed her wrist.Zhan Qingchen\u2019s expression changed,\u00a0\u201cSure enough, after all he is from the Demon Sect, he even cheated before his death!\u201dShe raised a hand to ward it off.But Shu Shi\u2019s Qi surged, the blood in his wound was completely burned, creating a strange force of thin air, and Zhan Qingchen couldn\u2019t break away temporarily.\u201cBlood-Burning Secret Technique?\u201dZhan Qingchen let out a low groan.After being seriously injured, he still forced himself to burn his own blood?\u201cFool! You\u2019re no match for me in your primal state! And now you\u2019re dying! This is no threat to me at all!\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s spiritual power flared, then her long sword floated in the air, preparing to finish him off completely.But in the next second.Shu Shi pulled her into his arms and forcefully k!ssed her pretty face.\u201cPuff!\u201dThe air froze.Zhan Qingchen lay in his arms, her expression listless, as if she had been paralyzed.Because the kiss was too fierce, it even left a faint h!ckey on the cheek.\u201cWhat, what are you doing!\u201dWhat had just happened?She was actually being k!ssed by Shu Shi!\u201cCough cough!\u201dThe effects of the Blood-Burning Technique had subsided, Zhan Qingchen\u2019s face flushed as red as a tomato, blood rushing from the corner of his mouth, but his smile seemed brighter.He was familiar with the plot and knew Zhan Qingchen very well.This extraordinary fairy in the eyes of the world was actually obsessed with extreme cleanliness and hated men, and had never had contact with anyone of the opposite s*x since childhood.This kiss will surely haunt her with disgust for the rest of her life.This was the most effective revenge.\u201cGoodbye, Zhan Qingchen.\u201dSu Shi closed his eyes in satisfaction.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe atmosphere was very quiet.Zhan Qingchen stood blankly, a blush spread across her cheeks, and the long sword in her hand trembled uncontrollably.\u201cP*rvert! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dShe was so embarrassed that she raised her sword and was about to slash, but her movement was stopped.She saw Shu Shi\u2019s eyes close tightly, there was no breath, and his face looked pale.Looking at the man who smiled until his death, Zhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes flashed in confusion.Obviously he died under her sword, yet Shu Shi had no trace of hatred, nor anger and regret.Instead, he had a satisfied expression on his face.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhen he was about to die, he forcefully burned his blood just to\u2026 k!ss me?\u201dZhan Qingchen touched her red cheek, but instead of the imagined disgust, an inexplicable feeling rose from within her heart.\u201cNo! I must ask him clearly, otherwise I\u2019m afraid my heart will never feel at ease!\u201dShe took out a golden leaf, vibrant vitality filled the air, the air was dense with a quaint aura.The leaf was placed between Su Shi\u2019s eyebrows, the golden light entered his body, the leaf dissipated into flying ash, and his pale cheeks surprisingly regained a trace of blood.Zhan Qingchen flew a ribbon from her sleeve robe, wrapped Su Shi firmly, stepped on the flying sword and carried him away into the air.\u201cWant to die? It\u2019s not that easy!\u201d\u201cWait until I\u2019ve asked you everything clearly, then kill you again with my own hands!\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 \u2013 Who told you to save me?Qingzhou City, Yushu Building.This was the largest building in Qingzhou City and was one of the secret places in Tianji Pavilion.In the elegant room on the third floor, the green-clothed maid was cleaning the room.Boom!The window opened, and a white-colored figure floated in.The green-clothed maid\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cChief, you\u2019ve returned! Looks like that demon Shu Shi has been killed by you?\u201dZhang Qingchen looked complicated, \u201cyeah.\u201dThe maid in the room said with a smile. \u201cI already know that demon is absolutely no match for you! He has committed many evils, so he deserves to die!\u201dShu Shi was a person with a demonic nature, and he had always been feuding with Zhan Qingchen.But it was just a small friction before.This time, the sect sent out a mission to wipe out the demon forces in the southwestern region, causing the two to have a life and death battle.Obviously, Shu Shi was not the opponent of this peerless genius.At this moment, the maid noticed that there was a \u201ccocoon\u201d wrapped in a ribbon behind Zhan Qingchen, and asked curiously, \u201cChief, what is this?\u201d\u201cNothing special.\u201dZhan Qingchen retracted the ribbon, revealing the man\u2019s pale cheeks, \u201cThis is Shu Shi.\u201d\u201cShu Shi!?\u201dThe green-clothed maid was startled.Zhan Qingchen replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s already lost consciousness.\u201dShu Shi was a demon general under the Nether Demon Emperor, and had a splendid reputation in the Southwest Region. Although his strength was not as strong as that of the peerless genius Zhan Qingchen, it was not something this little maid could handle.\u201cWhy did the chief bring back this demon?\u201d\u201cIs it for a public execution, to give the Nether Demon Emperor a disgrace?\u201dThe green-clothed maid pondered it to herself.Zhan Qingchen said: \u201cXiaoqing, go to Medicine King Valley and invite Old Medicine King over.\u201dXiaoqing was stunned for a moment, then nervously said: \u201cChief, are you injured?\u201dZhan Qingchen shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cThen what are you looking for the medicine king for?\u201d\u201cI want to save Shu Shi.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dXiaoqing\u2019s mind was a little dazed.Save Shu Shi?Aren\u2019t these two mortal enemies?Then what was the point of this assassination mission if he was saved in the end?Zhan Qingchen said: \u201cI know you have many questions, but I can\u2019t explain now. Just obey my orders and do it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAlthough Xiaoqing still had many doubts, but she did not dare to ask any further.Just when she was about to leave, she stopped.Zhan Qingchen furrowed her brows and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dXiaoqing pointed to her cheeks and said carefully, \u201cChief, there\u2019s a little rouge on your face.\u201d\u201cNonsense, when did I use rouge\u2026\u201dWhen Zhan Qingchen was halfway through speaking, she suddenly reacted, and her pretty face instantly flushed red.She hurriedly covered his her, turned around, and stammered, \u201cNo! Don\u2019t mind that matter, hurry up!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAfter Xiaoqing went out, Zhan Qingchen became calmer and looked at Shu Shi, her eyes full of embarrassment and anger.\u201cPervert! That kiss was so fierce, I almost got caught!\u201d\u2026\u2026..Shu Shi had a dream.In the dream, he became the \u2018favored son of heavens\u2019, a peerless genius that everyone admired, fairies and saintesses fell in love with him.His archenemy Zhan Qingchen became his servant, massaging his shoulders and feet obediently.\u201cMaster~\u201dQingchen\u2019s fairy face flushed, looking up at him with affection, her bright eyes as if they had autumn waves1.(Autumn Waves literally means the fluctuations and ripples of the autumn wind blowing over the water surface.

I have become Xu Xian?\u201dThe Reckless Hero!!!\u201cXu Xian is Xu Xian after all, she is the protagonist, much stronger than the cannon fodder villain.\u201dShu Shi cleared his throat and said: \u201cXiaoqing, I already know your true identity.

Shu Shi, you don\u2019t even remember your own name?\u201dShu Shi\u2019s expression stiffened.\u201cShu Shi?\u201dHe realized something, and looked down slowly, only to see that he was covered in bandages, and the wound on his chest was still aching.It was the place where Zhan Qingchen had stabbed him.Shu Shi didn\u2019t want to believe this: \u201cI\u2019m not dead?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dXiaoqing clutched her shoulders and coldly snorted, \u201cYou were badly injured and would have died for sure, but fortunately the Medicine King senior was highly skilled in medicine and pulled you back from the gate of death.\u201dXiaoqing thought he was too excited to talk, and continued: \u201cIn order to save you, I do not know how much spiritual medicine was spent, and even used Golden Leaf, which barely saved your life\u2026.\u201dShu Shi looked up at the sky with a long, anguished cry, \u201cWho told you to save me!!!\u201dXiaoqing: \u201c???\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Not to let me die so easily!\u201dCold sweat fell down Shu Shi\u2019s back.\u201cNo! I need to get out of this immediately!\u201dHe was not her match in his prime, and now that he was in a state of severe injury, how could he deal with her?Plus, now that the reincarnation function was closed, if he died this time, everything would be completely over!Shu Shi ignored his pain and struggled to get up and leave.But the door suddenly opened.Shu Shi frozeSlowly looking up, he saw a familiar figure standing in the doorway.He twitched the corners of his mouth and smiled: \u201cFairy Zhan, long time no see.\u201dZhan Qingchen was wearing a veil, and her expression was indistinct, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201dShu Shi said with embarrassment: \u201cI had some sudden business\u2026 cough, but not anymore.\u201d\u201cXiaoqing, you go out first.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXiaoqing backed out.Only two people remained in the room.Zhan Qingchen closed the door, arranged the soundproof array, came over and sat on the chair, staring at Su Shi quietly with her black and white eyes.Su Shi didn\u2019t dare to act rashly, and leaned against the edge of the bed stiffly.After a long time, Zhan Qingchen said, \u201cDo you know why I saved you ?\u201dShu Shi smiled bitterly: \u201cFairy Zhan might feel uncomfortable, afterall I\u2019d been\u2026.\u201dSpeaking of this, he paused and did not continue.Zhan Qingchen looked embarrassed and gritted his teeth: \u201cSo you all remember, I thought you would pretend to have amnesia.\u201dSu Shi shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m a manly man. A kiss is a kiss, what is afraid to admit?\u201dZhan Qingchen took a short breath.Although this is true, hearing the other party say it still made her feel uncomfortable, and the place where she had been kissed became hot for a while.She silently recited the Heart Clearing Mantra, forcing herself to regain her composure.\u201cThe reason why I saved you is to make this matter clear.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s phoenix eyes stared at him, \u201cWhy on earth did you kiss me?\u201dSu Shi bowed his head in silence.Why?Because I want to disgust you before I die?Su Shi was very sure that if he said this answer, he would definitely be pierced by the ten thousand swords through the heart.His brain was racing, thinking about how to answer to escape death.As time passed by, Zhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes gradually became indifferent.\u201cAre you speechless?\u201d\u201cIt seems like you just want revenge on me, or you\u2019re just a h*rny lecherous b*stard.\u201dFor some reason, she was inexplicably disappointed.Just when she was about to get up and leave, Su Shi slowly raised his head, with a bright smile on his pale face.\u201cBecause I like you.\u201dZhan Qingchen: \u03a3(\u2299\u25bd\u2299)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You and I, righteous and evil, have always been hostile and do not understand each other, not to mention that I almost killed you before.\u201dThere was constant friction between the two, but there was no deeper intersection.Most of Zhan Qingchen\u2019s understanding of Su Shi came from sect intelligence.A demon practitioner who commits all evils, a playboy rich b*stard, and the son of Yun Qiluo, the Nether Demon Venerable\u2026The reason why she wanted to kill him was also a task given by the sect, to clean up Yun Qiluo\u2019s influence in the Southwest Region.\u201cDon\u2019t you know me well enough?\u201dShu Shi said, \u201cZhan Qingchen, your nickname is Zhaozhao, taken from \u2018l\u00e0n zh\u0101ozh\u0101o x\u012b w\u00e8i y\u0101ng\u2019 , it means \u2018sparking bright\u2019, only your master calls you by that name.\u201d(TLN: this is an ancient poem called \u2018Lord within the Cloud\u2018 by\u00a0Qu Yuan, for a translation of the lyrics, please go here https://frankwatsonpoet.com/lord-of-clouds/)\u201cYou love to meditate, love sweets, hate men, hate disorder.\u201d\u201cSometimes you go to enjoy poetry, but you only hum \u201cNine Songs\u201d in the medicine house.\u201d(Tln: Nine Songs is a compilation of 11 poems by Qu Yuan, and \u2018Lord within the Cloud\u2019 is also one of them)\u201cHas a severe obsession with cleanliness and doesn\u2019t like to come into contact with anyone.\u201dListening to him speak, Zhan Qingchen couldn\u2019t help but be stunned, her eyes full of disbelief.Overall, the points he brought up had nothing wrong with them.Although those things are not secret, there are some small hobbies that even the closest friends don\u2019t know, but the person in the demon sect in front of her understands it very clearly.Zhan Qingchen was puzzled: \u201cHow can you know this stuff?\u201dSu Shi said lightly: \u201cWhen you like someone, you will naturally find a way to understand everything about that person.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s ears turned red, and her slender hands calmly grasped the hem of her clothes.It turns out that there are really people in this world who love me secretly!This made her feel numb, at a loss, flustered and shy, not knowing what to do.Su Shi breathed a sigh of relief.In order to find an excuse for his previous behavior, he could only take risks and choose to confess affectionately.This was a test of acting ability.Yet it seemed to have gone well.Although his cultivation base is average, he has given birth to a good complexion, coupled with the pale face caused by the unhealed injury, it is easy to arouse woman sympathy and pity.Who would have the heart to hurt an emotionally and physically wounded man?What\u2019s more, this man loves you very much!Even the most indifferent woman would melt in the end!Zhan Qingchen was completely tricked by him, yet she wasn\u2019t easy to fool either.\u201cSince you like me, why did you fight me everywhere before?\u201dSu Shi sighed and said in a low voice, \u201cI am a person of the demon sect, I have no other choice. But, although I am not a good person, I have never really hurt Chief Zhan.\u201dZhan Qingchen frowned.Thinking about it, it seemed to be the case.Although Su Shi opposed her everywhere, he was resolved by her every time, and never caused her any great harm.So those were all his intentions?\u201cI know that I will die. If I can choose, I hope to die at the hands of Chief Zhan.\u201dThere seemed to be a faint light in Su Shi\u2019s eyes, the corners of his mouth curled upwards in a bright arch, \u201cIf this life is destined to not be able to love you, then I am willing to use my own death to add another merit to Chief Zhan, this is the last little thing I can do for you.\u201dZhan Qingchen was stunned.\u201cI regard you as an enemy, but you always think of me, even at the risk of dying in my hands?\u201dThinking of Su Shi\u2019s satisfied smile \u201cbefore he died\u201d, a string seemed to break in her heart.Su Shi took a breath, \u201cEverything that needs to be said has been made clear, Chief Zhan can do it now.\u201dZhan Qingchen regained his senses, \u201cDo what?\u201dSu Shi frowned and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you come to kill me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201dZhan Qingchen hesitated.According to the sect\u2019s mission, it was indeed to kill Su Shi, but after knowing the other party\u2019s intentions, how could she still do it?She even began to doubt the accuracy of the sect\u2019s intelligence.Was this gentle man in front of her really a villain who committed all sorts of evils?At the same time, an order sounded in Su Shi\u2019s mind:[The plot has changed][Zhan Qingchen changed her mind and influenced the subsequent plot trend, gaining 5 plot points.][Please continue your efforts.]\u201cThat\u2019s a change of plot?\u201dSu shi\u2019s eyes lit up.He just wanted to save his little life, but he didn\u2019t expect a windfall!Zhan Qingchen was one of the female leads.Her every move, even a single thought, could change the plot, which was a treasure for Su shi!At this moment, Zhan Qingchen stood up and said, \u201cYou should rest first, other things \u2026\u2026 I will talk about it later.\u201dShe prepared to leave, leaving me alone?\u201cIs this the way to go?\u201dSu Shi was immediately anxious.She was a treasure, how could he let her go so easily.\u201cChief Zhan, I like you!\u201d\u201cI know, don\u2019t shout too loud.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s cheeks turned red and she wanted to make a hole in the ground and hide in it soon.Seeing that she was about to leave, Su Shi exclaimed in his desperation, \u201cPlease accept my feelings!\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s movements froze, and he stayed in place like a puppet.\u201cAccept, your feelings?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 \u2013 Please Accept My Feelings!After Shi Shi finished speaking, he regretted it.How could he say to accept his feelings when she had just been overwhelmed by heat of moment?If these words were to spread, there was no need for Tianji Pavilion to kill him, even his own family would gladly dismember him into a thousand pieces.But with Zhan Qingchen\u2019s character, I think it\u2019s impossible to accept it\u2026Accept her love?Zhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes were blank.Those were words that were too far away for her.As the Chief disciple of Tianji Pavilion, her status was high and noble, and although she had countless fans in the world, no one dared to pursue her.Moreover, under the influence of her Master, she naturally had a hatred for men.If it was as it was, she would be single for her entire life.But now that peace had been shattered!She was confessed!And that person was her sworn enemy!Looking at Su Shi\u2019s handsome cheeks, a pair of eyes as wide as stars, looked at herself with deep and tender affection, Zhan Qingchen\u2019s beautiful face flushed, like a deer, her heart seemed to want to jump out of her chest.No, absolutely not!I\u2019m righteous way, and he\u2019s demonic, how can we be together?But he\u2019s really gentle, how can I refuse?Since he\u2019s ready to die for me, what if he kills himself if I reject him outright?Zhan Qingchen\u2019s mind was in a war of heaven and earth, and for a moment she didn\u2019t know what to do.Seeing that the other party didn\u2019t say anything for a while, Su Shi was about to seize this opportunity to act.He let out a long sigh and said sadly: \u201cForgive me for being so abrupt. Chief Zhan is a genius and has a bright future. How can she be with me? It seems that we cannot love each other in this life, yet I hope we will be destined in the next life\u2026\u201dNext life?Zhan Qingchen said anxiously, \u201cAlright.\u201dShu Shi was surprised, \u201cHuh?\u201dZhan Qingchen lowered her head shyly and said in a voice like a gnat, \u201cIf it\u2019s to prevent you from killing yourself, I accept it.\u201dShu Shi: \u201c???\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019ll say this first. Even if I say I accept it, you must not let others know about this!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi panicked.\u201cUh, actually, you don\u2019t have to rush to accept it, you can think about it some more\u2026\u201dBut before he finished his sentence, Zhan Qingchen said in a low voice, \u201cShu Shi, if you dare to lie to me, I will kill you with my own hands!\u201dAfter saying that she turned around and ran away.Looking at her rushed back, Shu Shi\u2019s eyes froze.She actually accepted it?But the real problem is\u2026 I don\u2019t really love her!Her face was coated with sunshine, her skin was smooth as jade, and she was flawless in appearance and body shape.She has been in the top five of the most beautiful women list for many years, and is recognized as the most beautiful woman in the world.The two had clashed before, but it was all a plot arrangement. Under normal circumstances, Shu Shi would have liked this fairy.But now the situation was different.He was one of the Nether Demon Emperor\u2019s men!\u201cIf the master finds out about my relationship with Zhan Qingchen \u2026\u2026\u201dThinking of the Demon Emperor\u2019s character, Shu Shi couldn\u2019t help but let out a cold sweat at his temples.[The plot has changed.][Zhan Qingchen accepts the host\u2019s confession, which affects the subsequent plot trend and gets 15 plot points.][The host please keep the good work.]Keep the good work you say?Shu Shi couldn\u2019t help but want to cry.However this was the result, there was no point in regretting it now.What he needed to do now was to recover from his injury and increase his strength.The conversation with Zhan Qingchen earlier gave Shu Shi a total of 20 plot points.Plot points could be used to purchase items\u201cOpen system store.\u201dA dazzling page appeared in front of him.There were all sorts of heavenly treasures there, weapons, and even supreme bones and ancient blood, but they were very expensive, and even the cheapest items cost dozens of plot points.Not something he could afford right now.Seemingly aware of his dissatisfaction, the system prompt sounded:[The system opens the \u201cblind box function\u201d, and 10 points of plot value are drawn once to help the host pass the early stage smoothly.]\u201cBlind box?\u201dA prize pool popped up in front of Su Shi.Inside there were several prize boxes shimmering in various colors.According to the system, the prize pool will then be refreshed with different prizes such as feats, magic treasures, pills and a special prize that may appear.The higher the quality of the prize, the lower the probability of its appearance.The probability of a special prize appearing was less than 1%.Su Shi took a closer look and found that there was no difference between the boxes except for the difference in light.\u201cLet\u2019s try this one.\u201dThe gift box opened and a bright light flashed before his eyes.It was a legend-ranked item![Special Prize: Holy Talent Perfect (with Essence Cleansing)]\u201cSeriously? This is a Holy Talent!!!\u201dShu Shi was breathing heavily.He knew what this prize meant.In the Nine Realms Continent, cultivation was the priority.Cultivators\u2019 talents were divided into lower, middle, upper and super grades, as well as the legendary holy grade.Su Shi\u2019s previous talent was upper grade, which was already considered top among ordinary people, but was somewhat inadequate for top-tier heavenly talents.One must know that Zhan Qingchen\u2019s talent was Super Grade Perfect!Her cultivation speed was one in a thousand compared to his, and she was able to crush Su Shi effortlessly.What Su Shi drew now was a Holy Grade talent that only existed in legends.And that was the Holy Talent Perfect!Whether it was the speed of cultivation, the speed of perception, or the speed of recovery, they had all reached the pinnacle!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 \u2013 Breakthrough to the Realm of Golden Elixir, Get Mystical Ability!The Gift Box opened.Golden light slowly drifted upwards and entered Su Shi\u2019s eyebrows.It was as if a warm stream had been injected into his body, constantly flushing his meridians and removing impurities, transforming his bone roots into perfect harmony without the slightest flaw.Spiritual energy flowed into his body, replenishing the nearly dried up Dantian.Even the chest wound healed quickly, the weak qi and blood became full and surging, and the body was filled with inexhaustible power.\u201cAmazing!\u201dShu Shi let out a long breath.He stretched and moved his muscles, making a \u201ccrackling\u201d sound like fried beans.Open the system panel![Host: Su Shi][Status: Full of Qi and Blood, refreshed][Talent: Holy Talent Perfect][Cultivation Base: Realm of Golden Elixir (Early Stage)][Cultivation Method: The Breathing Technique of Netherworld (Great Success), Netherworld Divine Cultivation (Small Success)][Plot Value: 10 points]\u201cWait, Early Stage of Golden Elixir Realm?\u201dNoticing the change, Su Shi hurriedly looked into his dantian.He saw a golden core hanging in the center of his dantian, as if it was a blazing sun emitting a dazzling light.Spiritual qi was continuously compressed by the golden core, and its quality was an unknown number of times stronger than before.A real breakthrough!He couldn\u2019t come back to his senses for a moment.This was the Realm of Golden Elixir!As the saying goes, \u201cFoundation Establishment exists to enlighten the soul, while Golden Elixir exists to transform the bones\u201d.If Foundation Establishment is the beginning of cultivation, then the Realm of Golden Elixir is the true transformation of bones.But how difficult is it to train Qi to become Dan?Throughout history, very few people entered the Golden Elixir at the age of twenty.Su Shi was at the Late Stage of Foundation Establishment and seemed to be one step away from reaching the Realm of Golden Elixir, but he knew in his heart that without a great opportunity, it would take at least ten years to get past the shackles.But now, he managed to refine the Golden Elixir1\u00a0as if it was brewing a cup of tea!The effect of the Holy Talent, coupled with the cleansing of the essence and marrow, was terrifying!\u201cAmazing!\u201dThere were exactly 10 plot points left, so Su Shi opened another blind box while the iron was still hot.[Mystical Abilities: Eight Desolate Six Harmonious Palms]Su Shi\u2019s eyebrows shot up, \u201cMystical Abilities?!\u201dMystical Abilities were divided into four levels, \u201cHeaven, Earth, Mystery, and Gold\u201d.Most of the Mystical Abilities circulating in the world were Gold grade, while those of Earth grade were already considered rare, and if one mastered Mystery grade Mystical Abilities, one could become a first-class sect leader.As for the most powerful Heaven-grade Mystical Abilities, most of them were firmly held by the top sects and imperial dynasties.Only core members were qualified to learn them.Su Shi, as the Demon General of Netherworld, was in charge of some of the Southwest Region\u2019s affairs, but he only learned \u201cquasi-mystery-level\u201d Mystical Abilities.That\u2019s what the sect bestowed upon him.Su Shi couldn\u2019t wait to swallow the golden light, and his spiritual platform was instantly filled with enlightenment, and he mastered this divine ability perfectly within moments.Spiritual energy flowed within his body and converged on his right hand, and a green lotus bloomed in his palm, surrounding him with an aura of desolation and destruction.Before he even made an attacking move, he could feel its terrifying destructive power!And it would become stronger and stronger as his cultivation level increased!\u201cEight Desolate Six Harmonious Palms is mine.\u201dA smile lifted the corners of Su Shi\u2019s mouth.Although he did not draw any special gifts, the quality of this gift was quite good.\u201cTalent plus Mystical Abilities, now the situation has completely turned around!\u201d\u201cBut \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about Zhan Qingchen\u2019s side?\u201d\u201cIf she knows I lied to her, she will definitely beat me to death \u2026\u2026\u201dSu Shi\u2019s smile narrowed and he rubbed his eyebrows in distress.\u2026.Next room.Zhan Qingchen sat frozen on the bed, her eyes blank and unfocused.\u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201dFaced with Su Shi\u2019s \u201cconfession of love\u201d, she had agreed to accept his feeling in a moment of enthusiasm!Only now that she had calmed down did she realize how outrageous this decision was.She was the Chief disciple of the Righteous Sect and the other party was a member of the Demonic Sect, so if this matter came to light, it would cause a huge uproar.Not to mention the fact that Tianji Pavilion would definitely not be able to tolerate it.\u201cI\u2019m so impulsive, how can I accept Su Shi\u2019s confession?\u201d\u201cAlthough his feelings are so sincere \u2026\u2026 but he is a member of the Demonic Sect after all!\u201d\u201cBut looking at his appearance today, if I rashly propose to refuse, he will definitely choose to commit suicide, right?\u201dZhan Qingchen knew nothing about the affairs of men and women.The fact that the other party had confessed so plainly, even to the point of laying down his life for her, was a great shock to her heart.\u201cIs this love?\u201dRecalling Su Shi\u2019s gentle but firm eyes, her heart trembled, and her head seemed to be buried in the pillow like an ostrich, without the slightest trace of the Chief Disciple\u2019s appearance.Knock, knock, knock!At that moment, there was a knock on the door of the room.Zhan Qingchen hurriedly sat upright, her expression returning to a cold expression.\u201cCome in.\u201dXiaoqing pushed the door in, holding a stack of documents in her hand, \u201cChief, the information you requested has been collected.\u201dZhan Qingchen nodded, \u201c Hmm, put that down.\u201dXiaoqing put the information on the table, then bowed and retreated.Just as she reached the door, she heard Zhan Qingchen say, \u201cBy the way, don\u2019t let anyone know about Su Shi being here for now.\u201d\u201cWhat about the sect?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, including the sect.\u201d\u201cAlright \u2026\u2026\u201dXiaoqing hesitated for a moment and cautiously said, \u201cChief, you seem quite interested in Su Shi?\u201dZhan Qingchen had always been cynical about evil and would never show mercy when dealing with those in the demonic dao.Now not only did he help Su Shi heal his injuries, she even let him stay in the Medicinal House, which was something unprecedented.\u201cI have my own plan for this matter, just do as you are told, no need to ask more.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s tone was bland, but the tips of her ears were faintly red.\u201cAlright.\u201dXiaoqing didn\u2019t dare to ask any more questions.When she left, Zhan Qingchen sat in silence for a while before walking to the table and picking up the documents.Turning to the first page, the dense text came into view.[Su Shi, twenty years old, the first son of the Su family in Nanli City \u2026\u2026]1. \u4e39 (read Dan), litteraly means energy, pill, and elixir (immortality potion). Dantian is loosely translated as \u201celixir field\u201d, 'sea of qi\u201d, or simply \u201cenergy center\u201d. Dantian are the \u201cqi focus flow centers\u201d, important focal points for meditative and exercise techniques such as qigong, martial arts such as t\u2019ai chi ch\u2019uan, and in traditional Chinese medicine. There is a history to why Dan is associated with the elixir of immortality. Qinshihuang, the first king of the Qin dynasty, wanted an immortal body so he ordered the royal alchemists to find a potion for immortality, which gave birth to Waidan (\u5916\u4e39) which means medicinal discipline. I translated Jidan (\u91d1\u4e39) as Golden Elixir because Zhan Qingchen was a cultivator who specialized in medicine, but it seems that the translation is not quite right. I found the same cultivation level from the novel Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation and they translated this as\u00a0Golden CorePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Before I Died, I Forcibly Kissed The HeroineCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhan Qingchen had no experience in love, but that didn\u2019t mean she was stupid.Even if Su Shi\u2019s feelings for her were sincere, she couldn\u2019t accept a relationship with a crazy killer.So she mobilized the power of the sect and investigated Shu Shi\u2019s background in detail.[Shu Shi, the first son of the Shu family in Nanli City. At the age of seven, he joined the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, and at the age of twenty, he stepped into the Late Stage of Foundation Establishment and became a Demon General under the Netherworld Demon Emperor, in charge of Fengsha City\u2019s affairs in the Southwest Region.]Zhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes flickered.The Shu Family of Nanli City.Nanli City was located in the southwest, a strategic location connected to the Central Plains.The Shu family, on the other hand, was a large and prestigious family in Nanli, and its power could be described as deep-rooted.As the first son of the Shu family, Shu Shi was born with a golden spoon in his mouth and was a true playboy.But with Shu Shi\u2019s cultivation level at the Realm Foundation Establishment, he would not be enough to hold the position of Demon General.Not to mention managing the affairs of the city.The reason why the Netherworld Demon Emperor, made such an arrangement was clearly because he favored Shu\u2019s family background.If they could enter Nanli City, it would be very important to the layout of the Demonic Sect, and they could even take this opportunity to obtain the Central Plains.\u201cThat\u2019s a good calculation.\u201dZhan Qingchen snorted coldly.Then looked down.[To prove himself, Shu Shi had launched several raids against Righteous Cultivators in the Southwest Region, but without exception all of them ended in failure, and it weakened the Demonic Sect in Fengsha City instead][It is rumored that the Demon Emperor has many opinions about him and his position in the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect is in danger.]\u201cNot once did he succeed?\u201dZhan Qingchen froze.On the surface, the Southwest Region ostensibly belonged to the imperial dynasty, but in reality it had been completely infiltrated by the power of the Demonic Sect, so it made sense that Shu Shi should have had home-field advantage and his raid against the Righteous Cultivators should have gone smoothly.But every time, he would reveal a flaw and then be defeated by the Righteous Cultivators and destroyed in one fell swoop.\u201cOne or two mistakes are understandable, but if every time is like this, then there can only be one explanation.\u201d\u201cSu Shi did it on purpose!\u201dZhan Qingchen quickly thought of the cause and effect:\u201cSu Shi was forced to join the Demonic Sect, yet he did not succumb to the Demon Emperor\u2019s lustful authority and repeatedly sabotaged the Demonic Sect\u2019s actions in secret! He even risked his own life to stop the Demonic Sect from extending its hand to Nanli City!\u201dThinking of everything that had happened before, she became even more certain of her conjecture.If Su Shi was such an evil person, how could he be willing to die?When she thought of Su Shi\u2019s ordeal, the smile on his face when he fell under her sword, and the gentle look in his loving eyes.Zhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes were slightly red.She rubbed her eyes and whispered, \u201cThis fool! Does he not think of himself at all?\u201dIf Su Shi knew what she was thinking, perhaps his brain would be buzzing.Intentionally revealing a flaw?Of course not! It was all an arrangement of that shitty plot!If it wasn\u2019t for the system, I would have killed those righteous hypocrites long ago!\u2026\u2026Perhaps because of being \u201creborn\u201d, Su Shi\u2019s entire body relaxed.He slept soundly.When he opened his eyes, it was already dawn and the sun was rising.\u201cAaah~\u201dHe was just about to stretch his back when he suddenly caught a glimpse of a white figure in the light.\u201cChief Zhan?\u201dSu Shi was surprised, \u201cWhen did you get here?\u201dZhan Qingchen was a little embarrassed and explained, \u201cI came to bring you breakfast, and seeing that you were sleeping soundly, I didn\u2019t call you.\u201dOnly then did Su Shi realize that a food box was placed beside him.\u201cNo need to trouble Chief Zhan with such things, I\u2019ll go to the dining room and eat myself.\u201d\u201cHow will you do that?\u201dZhan Qingchen said, \u201cYou still can\u2019t do normal activities because your wounds haven\u2019t healed yet. Besides, I was the one who stabbed you in the first place, so it\u2019s only fitting that I take care of you.\u201dSu Shi shook his head and said, \u201cChief Zhan is too polite.\u201dLooking at his handsome face, Zhan Qingchen hesitated for a moment and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t you \u2026\u2026 hate me at all?\u201dThat sword of her was quite fierce.If it weren\u2019t for the leafe of the Golden Arcane Tree, even if the Medicine King came, it wouldn t help.\u201cOf course I don\u2019t hate you.\u201dSu Shi said with a smile, \u201cI am a member of the Demonic Sect, it is Chief Zhan\u2019s duty to kill me, it is I who should thank you for saving my life.\u201dThis was Shu Shi\u2019s true heart.Zhan Qingchen killing him was a plot arrangement.Although he was almost killed, it opened up a new mission by accident, which was a blessing in disguise for him.Zhan Qingchen lowered her head.The more relaxed Su Shi\u2019s tone was, the more guilty she felt.\u201cBefore, I didn\u2019t understand things clearly, so I took the opportunity to stab you, I was too careless.\u201d\u201cSu Shi, I apologize.\u201dZhan Qingchen apologized to him in a sincere manner.\u201cUh \u2026\u2026 it\u2019s okay.\u201dSu Shi scratched his head.Is this still the same Fairy Qingchen who has always been indifferent?The change is too great!\u201cTo make up for my mistake, I will take good care of you this time.\u201dZhan Qingchen sat on the edge of the bed with a lunch box and took out a steaming medicinal food from it.\u201cThis is a recipe left by Medicine King, I boiled it myself this morning, it is very helpful for your recovery.\u201dShe scooped out a spoonful with a spoon, blew on it coldly and passed it to Su Shi\u2019s mouth.\u201cChief Zhan, this is \u2026\u2026\u201dSu Shi did not respond for a moment.Zhan Qingchen\u2019s cheeks flushed slightly as she shyly said, \u201cYou\u2019re seriously injured and it\u2019s inconvenient for you to do it yourself, so it\u2019s better for me to feed you.\u201d\u201cAh? That\u2019s inappropriate!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s inappropriate? Aren\u2019t we in a relationship?\u201dWhen she said these words, Zhan Qingchen\u2019s voice was like a gnat, Shu Shi was at a loss for words.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLooking at her beautiful cheeks like a sunset reflecting the snow, Su Shi\u2019s heart beat faster and he couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cChief Zhan, you\u2019re so beautiful.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s wrist twitched and the medicinal food almost spilled out.A blush spread from her cheeks to her neck, and her bright eyes sparkled.Biting her lip, she snapped, \u201cPervert, are you going to drink it or not?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll drink!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 \u2013 Medicine is bitter, while Chief Zhan is sweet!Under Zhan Qingchen\u2019s 'service\u201d, Shu Shi drank all the medicinal food.Looking at the clean bottom of the bowl, she had astonishment in her eyes.Zhan Qingchen said amusedly, \u201cLook at your face, is it that good?\u201dShu Shi smiled and said, \u201cMedicinal food is very bitter, but Chief Zhan is very sweet.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s cheeks burned, \u201cYou\u2019re a flirt, you\u2019re talking nonsense again!\u201dFor twenty years, she had cultivated with a clear mind and had never ventured into the \u201cred world\u201d, so she was helpless against such honest and fiery words of love.After calming down, Zhan Qingchen put away the bowl of soup, \u201cTake a rest, I will continue brewing your medicine tomorrow.\u201d\u201c Wait a moment.\u201dShu Shi pulled her back.Zhan Qingchen\u2019s body instantly stiffened, her expression panicked, \u201cWhat, what are you doing?\u201dThis man isn\u2019t trying to kiss me again, is he!In that case, should I refuse or not?Although it didn\u2019t feel bad being kissed by him, we had just established our relationship, wasn\u2019t this a bit too soon?In an instant, a million thoughts swept through her mind and her whole body couldn\u2019t help but freeze in place.Shu Shi said, \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, I just want to talk to you.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dZhan Qingchen breathed a sigh of relief.But a hint of inexplicable disappointment swept through her heart.Shu Shi didn\u2019t know what was on her mind and continued, \u201cBy the way, there\u2019s something I haven\u2019t had a chance to tell you, but my wound has actually healed.\u201d\u201cImpossible.\u201dZhan Qingchen shook her head, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, I know how heavy your wounds are, and Medicine King also said that it will take at least three months of healing to completely recover.\u201dSeeing that she did not believe him, Shu Shi simply pulled up his clothes, revealing his strong and sturdy chest.\u201cOh my!\u201dZhan Qingchen hurriedly covered her eyes and said incoherently, \u201cSpeak up, why did you, you, you take off your clothes? I\u2019m not a frivolous woman like you think!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi said helplessly, \u201cI really didn\u2019t lie to you, if you don\u2019t believe me, see for yourself.\u201dShe quietly opened her fingers and blinked her eyes to look through the cracks.She saw his smooth and flat chest, and his wounds had disappeared, leaving not even the slightest scar.Zhan Qingchen was a little incredulous.Her delicate fingers touched him carefully to make sure his wound had completely healed.\u201cHow is that possible?\u201dShu Shi shrugged, \u201cProbably because I had a good constitution and recovered quickly.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s heart jumped.She knew how badly Shu Shi was injured.Being stabbed in the chest by a sharp sword and then forcibly burning his blood, it was a miracle that he survived, how could he heal so quickly?If he had this kind of skill, he wouldn\u2019t have lost to herself in the first place!The only possibility is that \u2026\u2026He did it on purpose!He hid his strength from the start and didn\u2019t fight back even when he was stabbed in the chest with a sharp sword!\u201cShu Shi, I hate you to death!\u201dShu Shi: \u201cHuh?\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes misted up, \u201cYou idiot, why don\u2019t you ever think of yourself? Your life is precious too!\u201dAt this moment, the pent-up emotions completely exploded.Zhan Qingchen threw herself into his arms and sobbed uncontrollably.Shu Shi was dumbfounded.Unaware of the fact that the other party had regarded him as a great hero who was willing to sacrifice himself.After a while, her sobs gradually stopped.Zhan Qingchen raised her head, her face still streaked with tears, \u201cDon\u2019t do that again, I want you to live well!\u201dAlthough Shu Shi was unsure, he nodded and said, \u201cI won\u2019t die, I must continue my love affair with Chief Zhan.\u201d\u201cFlirtatious! Talking nonsense again.\u201dZhan Qingchen smacked him sullenly, but was reluctant to use any strength.The two embraced each other quietly.The air felt warm and calm.Only after Zhan Qingchen calmed down did she realize how intimate the two were in their position.Her cheek was buried in Shu Shi\u2019s chest and she could clearly hear the strong and powerful heartbeat.His hands were on her waist, and she could feel the searing heat coming from them even through her clothes.Zhan Qingchen\u2019s cheeks were flushed and her entire body was dizzy, unable to gather any strength at all.She was so shy, but she was reluctant to let him go.\u201cShu Shi, I\u2019m \u2026\u2026\u201dAt this moment, footsteps sounded outside the door.The two separated like lightning, and Zhan Qingchen turned around, a faint blush still on her face.Xiaoqing pushed the door open and walked in.\u201cHuh? Chief, you\u2019re here too.\u201dZhan Qingchen frowned and said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you knock on the door?\u201d\u201cI came to get the food box and didn\u2019t know that you were also here. You \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAhem, I just came in too.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes fluttered, \u201cWell, hurry up and come out, don\u2019t disturb Mr. Shu\u2019s rest.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXiaoqing always felt that something was wrong.The two walked out of the room.Xiaoqing asked, \u201cChief, are you still going to brew the medicinal food yourself tomorrow?\u201dZhan Qingchen shook her head and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to brew it, Shu Shi\u2019s wound has already healed.\u201d\u201cSo fast?\u201dXiaoqing was surprised, \u201cBut I remember yesterday his wound hadn\u2019t healed yet!\u201dZhan Qingchen frowned, \u201cHow do you know that?\u201dXiaoqing said, \u201cI\u2019ve been wiping his body all this time, so of course I can see how his wounds are healing.\u201d\u201cWiping, wiping his body? !\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s breath caught.Xiaoqing said casually, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wanted me to take good care of him? He\u2019s unconscious and no one else is allowed to know his whereabouts, so I\u2019m the only one who can take care of him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cChief doesn\u2019t need to praise me, it\u2019s all what I have to do. But then again, Shu Shi has a very nice body \u2026\u2026\u201dZhan Qingchen clenched her silver teeth and said coldly, \u201cYou just entered the room without knocking, you will be punished with a fine of half a year\u2019s salary, plus one month of cleaning the hut.\u201dXiaoqing: \u201c????\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 \u2013 He is one of my people, not something you can kill just because you want to.The Southern Border of Northern Region.A cliff stretches for thousands of miles.Deeply shrouded in mist, the view is less than half a meter and you cannot see where the other side is.Yet beneath this cliff, which is difficult for birds to cross, lies a great demonic sect that makes the world tremble.The Rakshasa Sect of Netherworld!Through a layer of mist, a shocking array of buildings came into view.Houses were scattered all over the place.It was a wonder who had the power to create such a huge complex of buildings under a steep cliff!The palace in the center was extremely luxurious. With a shiny golden roof emitting endless light, a black plaque hung above the door with two large blood-colored letters that read:Rakshasa!Inside the palace.A beautiful figure could be faintly seen behind the phoenix curtains.Her silhouette leaned lazily on the embroidered sofa, although her appearance could not be seen, her every behavior moved the heart.The messenger in black knelt on the ground, his head bowed low and his eyes unblinking.Because he knew that if he dared to look up once more, his head would leave his body forever.\u201cYour Majesty, a clue has come from the Southwest Region.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201dThe woman\u2019s voice sounded lazy.The messenger in black said, \u201cFive days ago, Su Shi, the leader of Fengsha City, dueled with Zhan Qingchen, the Chief Disciple of Tianji Pavilion, and the outcome of the fight is unknown.\u201d\u201cBut Zhan Qingchen returned to her sect that night, while Su Shi we haven\u2019t heard anything so far, most likely \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHe is already dead.\u201dThe woman said indifferently, \u201cZhan Qingchen is at the Realm of Golden Elixir, while Su Shi is only at the Late Stage of Foundation Establishment, he will certainly die if he insists on duel .\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, I still want to use the Shu family to enter Nanli City, but now it seems that plan will be put on hold for the time being.\u201dHer tone did not fluctuate in the slightest, as if she did not care about Su Shi\u2019s death.The messenger in black asked, \u201cWith Su Shi\u2019s death, what about Fengsha City\u2019s affairs?\u201d\u201cJust find someone to take over, it\u2019s just a small place, not worthy of undue attention.\u201dSpeaking at this point, the woman looked a little tired and waved her hand, \u201cYou can leave.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe messenger in black bowed and retreated.The great hall became deathly quiet.After an unknown period of time, a sigh came from behind the phoenix curtain.\u201cSu Shi \u2026\u2026 He seems to have been in my care since he was seven years old, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cAlthough he has average talent and a stupid brain, but after all, he is one of my people, not something you can kill just because you want to.\u201d\u201cGhost Twelve.\u201d\u201cThis subordinate is here.\u201dThe air swirled in the corner of the palace and a shadow-like figure knelt on one knee.\u201cTell Cen Baihu to issue the Black Killing Order, I want Zhan Qingchen dead!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u2026\u2026Medicinal House.Su Shi wore a pure white brocade robe, outlining a straight and erect figure.He was a handsome and dashing man, with his sword brows and starry eyes, like a true gentleman in a turbulent world.Zhan Qingchen stared at him with unblinking eyes.Why didn\u2019t I realize that he looked so handsome before?\u201cSu Shi, do you really want to leave now?\u201dZhan Qingchen asked aloud.Su Shi nodded, \u201cThere is no impenetrable wall in this world, should news of my being here spread, it would not be a good thing for you and me.\u201dAfter all, Medicinal House was the residence of Tianji Pavilion.As a Demon General, it was already a very risky act for him to stay here for a few days.Moreover, his duel with Zhan Qingchen was no secret.After so long without any news, he still did not know what kind of chaos would occur in Fengsha City.But with that Nether Demon Emperor\u2019s character, I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t care whether I live or die.Su Shi shook his head and smiled bitterly.Zhan Qingchen looked a little glum.She understood all his reasons, but when it came time to part, her heart was still full of longing and unwillingness.It was strange to say.She had been alone before and didn\u2019t feel anything wrong, but after spending these few days with Su Shi, the loneliness became so unbearable.Su Shi said comfortingly, \u201cThis place is not far from Nanli City, Chief Zhan can come and sit at my house sometime.\u201d\u201cTo your house?\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s heart skipped a beat.Doesn\u2019t that mean I\u2019m going to meet his parents?Su Shi saw her thoughts and said with a smile, \u201c Don\u2019t be nervous, an ugly daughter-in-law has to meet her father-in-law sooner or later.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not ugly!\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not even a daughter-in-law yet!\u201dZhan Qingchen exhaled in anger and pinched him.After he interrupted, the sadness of separation faded a little.Su Shi reached out and took her in his arms, gently stroking her satin hair.\u201cChief Zhan, I will miss you.\u201dIt started off as a misunderstanding.But after a few days together, he was deeply touched by this cold-hearted fairy.Zhan Qingchen snorted, \u201cBut I don\u2019t miss you at all.\u201dAlthough she said so, her hands clung to him, refusing to let go in any way.Smelling the refreshing scent of her body, Su Shi\u2019s eyes twinkled, \u201cSince we are separated, can Chief Zhan grant me one wish?\u201dZhan Qingchen raised her head, \u201cWhat wish \u2026\u2026 Mmm!\u201dThe words suddenly stopped.Her beautiful eyes opened wide, her eyes were colored with mist, even her earlobes gradually turned red, and her body stiffened like a doll.After a long time, the two separated.She remained frozen in place, as if she had lost her soul.Su Shi leaned closer to her ear and whispered, \u201cChief Zhan, you are really sweet.\u201d\u201cYou, you temptress!!!\u201dZhan Qingchen regained consciousness, her pretty face flushed and she raised her hand to hit him.But Su Shi had already escaped in an instant.She stomped her feet in shame and anger.\u201cThat p*rverted bastard!\u201dAfter a while, she calmed down and her eyes glazed over slightly.\u201cIs this what it feels like \u2026\u2026 to be in love?\u201dConfused, embarrassed, uncomfortable, and with a hint of longing.An unprecedented feeling filled the heart and for a moment made Zhan Qingchen a little obsessed.At this moment, Xiaoqing walked in.\u201cHuh, where\u2019s Su Shi?\u201dZhan Qingchen whispered, \u201cGone.\u201d\u201cThat ungrateful bastard, he didn\u2019t tell me when he left.\u201dXiaoqing muttered angrily, \u201c How could he not say anything after I took care of him for days?\u201dZhan Qingchen glared at her, \u201cHave you finished cleaning the hut?\u201d\u201cYes. Chief, why is your mouth red? Is the rouge not evenly spread?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve already decided.\u201d\u201cDecided what?\u201d\u201cTo fine you another six months\u2019 salary.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 \u2013 Is Su Shi really dead?Fengsha City.The city was located in a remote area, adjacent to the Western Desert, and was named so because of the wind and sand that blew through over the years.Originally it was under the jurisdiction of the imperial dynasty, but the entire Southwest Region had been infiltrated by the Demon Sect, and the so-called City Lord had already existed in name only.It was no exaggeration to say that this was a place beyond the law.In the center of the city, the Demonic Sect\u2019s residence.Inside the hall, crowds of people sat on both sides in turn, but the topmost seats were empty.\u201cSo, it\u2019s been five days and still no news of Shu Shi?\u201d\u201cNot yet, I have sent people to look for him, but his fate is unknown dead or alive!\u201d\u201cI think he might die this time!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of courage he has, how dare he go looking for Zhan Qingchen by himself?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s probably gone mad!\u201d\u201cHmph, a punk who relied on his background to reach the top, who can he blame for seeking his own death?\u201dThe crowd murmured.Su Shi was not particularly strong, yet he was able to become the commander of Fengsha City, clearly relying on his Shu family background.Of course this would not be well received in the meritocracy-based Demonic Sect.Moreover, the five and three times tumultuous operations all ended in failure, the City could no longer tolerate losing more than a third of its strength.His reputation had even fallen to the bottom.There were many people in Fengsha City who hoped for his death.At that moment, a sturdy man slowly walked in.The hall was instantly silent.This man was muscular like a dragon, with qi and blood like an iron tower, and exuded a forcing pressure.The second in command in Fengsha City.Lion King, Shi Meng!Shi Meng looked around, and where his gaze went, the crowd fell silent.He nodded in satisfaction and said in a low voice, \u201cI just received news from the sect that it has been determined that Commander Su Shi is dead, so I will take over Fengsha City\u2019s affairs for now.\u201dHearing these words, the lobby fell silent for a moment, followed by a round of applause.\u201cGood!\u201d\u201cThat stone-head punk deserves it!\u201d\u201cFengsha City has suffered because of Su Shi for a long time!\u201d\u201cWith Commander Shi, Fengsha City\u2019s revival is imminent!\u201dWhether they were sincere or not, the crowd clapped and clapped, giving Shi Mang quite a face.Shi Meng was also beaming red.She had waited for this day for too long.Being at the Early Stage of the Realm of Golden Elixir, but having to listen to a little kid from the Realm Foundation Establishment, it filled his heart with hatred and anger.But after all, Su Shi was a Demon General appointed by the Sect Patriarch, so even if he was displeased, there was nothing he could do.But to his surprise, that person had made a fool of himself by daring to challenge Zhan Qingchen who was beyond his realm!\u201cAlright.\u201dShi Meng clenched his hands into fists and pressed them against his chest, then said dramatically, \u201cCommander Shu\u2019s life and death have not yet been determined, so I am only temporarily in charge, and if Commander Shu returns someday, this position should still be returned to him. \u201dAfter all, he still has to do his best to save face.\u201cDon\u2019t say that, his return will only bring disaster!\u201dA dark-skinned and depraved-looking man sneered, \u201cZhan Qingchen is the Chief Disciple of Tianji Pavilion, the first genius of the righteous path! Isn\u2019t killing him no different from killing a chicken?\u201dShi Meng did not say anything, but the smile in his eyes grew stronger.The depraved man cleared his throat and said, \u201cSince Commander Shi has taken over Su Shi\u2019s position, then naturally, Shu Shi\u2019s mansion and property will also belong to Commander Shi, so everyone shouldn\u2019t have a problem with it, right?\u201d\u201cNo comment.\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201dIt was obvious that the depraved man was Shi Meng\u2019s person.Even before Su Shi\u2019s corpse was found, this party was already thinking about property, and indeed it was not something appropriate.But there was no one who would stand up and object.Who would dare offend Shi Meng, who was the center of attention, for the sake of a dead person?This was the reality.The depraved man smiled and said, \u201cCommander Shi, there\u2019s nothing else to do anyway, why don\u2019t we go and see your new house first?\u201dShi Meng had long wanted to see it, so she nodded and said, \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt to take a look.\u201d\u201cPlease.\u201dThe two men left the lobby directly, leaving the crowd of people to stare at each other.\u2026\u2026Su Shi\u2019s mansion was located in the center of the city.With five gates and seven entrances and a spacious courtyard, it is a mansion in the true sense.But at this moment, Shi Meng stopped in front of the door.Only a young girl with a clean appearance stood at the door and frowned, \u201cDeputy Shi? What are you doing here?\u201d\u201cDeputy?\u201dThis address caused Shi Meng to frown slightly, and mist swept across the bottom of his eyes.The depraved man angrily reprimanded, \u201cPresumptuous! The one standing in front of you is Commander Shi!\u201d\u201cCommander?\u201dThe young girl frowned, \u201cThe Commander of Fengsha City is my master, when did he become you, Shi Meng?\u201d\u201cHeh, so you still don\u2019t know.\u201dThe depraved man laughed coldly, \u201cShu Shi is dead, his bones are gone! The sect has appointed Commander Shi to take over the position, and all of Shu Shi\u2019s houses and properties belong to Commander Shi!\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201dThe young girl was struck by lightning at his words.If Shi Meng had no doubts about it, then there was a high probability that it was true!\u201cMy master is \u2026\u2026 dead?\u201dHer face was pale, her figure swayed and she almost sat on the ground.With a perverted look in his eyes, the depraved man came to Shi Meng\u2019s ear and said, \u201cCommander Shi, this servant should also be part of the property, right? Since Shu Shi is dead, isn\u2019t the girl now yours?\u201dLooking at the beautiful face of the young girl, Shi Meng couldn\u2019t help but lick his lips.\u201cThat makes sense, first tie her up for me, then I will slowly concoct her at night!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe bastard man smiled fiercely and reached out to grab the young girl.Faced with a large, grasping hand, the young girl had no time to dodge and could only close her eyes in despair.However, the palm did not touch her.The young girl opened her eyes in confusion, only to see a sturdy figure standing in front of her, and a familiar cold voice sounding.\u201cShi Meng, how dare you touch my woman.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now that you have returned, this position should naturally be handed back to you.\u201dHe said this with his mouth, but he was distressed in his heart.He thought that with Su Shi\u2019s death, he would be able to take the seat easily, but even before his ass was warmed up, this person had actually returned alive!However, there was nothing he could do.The instruction given by the sect was to \u201ctemporarily take over\u201d.\u201cIs that so?\u201dShu Shi turned to look at Bai Qing, \u201cWhat did they say just now?\u201dBai Qing said honestly, \u201cThey said that you have died and Shi Meng will take over the commander position. They also said that your mansion and propei all belong to Shi Meng, even including the maid.\u201dWhen she said this, she looked embarrassed and angry.If master had come late for even just a second, my fate might have been\u2026.She didn\u2019t dare to think about it!Shu Shi looked at Shi Meng, \u201cWhat is your explanation for this?\u201dShi Meng\u2019s face was grim, unable to speak.The depraved man\u2019s eyes rolled and he said in a low voice, \u201cIt seems that Shu Shi won\u2019t let this matter off the hook easily. Rather than waiting for him to take revenge, it\u2019s better for us to strike first.\u201d\u201cBut \u2026\u2026\u201dShi Meng understood what the depraved man meant.But the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect\u2019s rules were very strict and it was a serious crime to break the rules by killing a fellow disciple!Otherwise, how could he endure it for so many years?\u201cThe person who killed Shu Shi was Zhan Qingchen, what does that have to do with Commander Shi? Besides, in the eyes of the sect, he is already a dead man!\u201dSeeing that he was still hesitating, the depraved man added fuel to the fire and said, \u201cIf you miss this opportunity, it will be difficult to sit in the position of commander again!\u201dA murderous aura appeared under Shi Meng\u2019s eyes.\u201cMakes sense!\u201d\u201cI already offended Shu Shi to death today, if I miss this chance, he probably won\u2019t let me go!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better to just kill him!\u201d\u201cYou go and kill that maid, I\u2019ll take care of Shu Shi, make sure no one sees!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe depraved man took the lead and pointed at Bai Qing, angrily scolding, \u201cLittle girl, how dare you slander Commander Shi, you must pay for it with your life!\u201dWith that, he was about to slap her with his palm.He didn\u2019t care about Su Shi, who was standing nearby.Shi Meng was a cultivator in the Realm of Golden Elixir, so he could deal with someone in the Realm Foundation Establishment with ease.The depraved man\u2019s smile was extremely fierce.However, in the next second, his movements froze.There was a sharp pain in his chest and his qi was drained out quickly.Slowly, he looked down and saw a white palm on his chest, with throbbing flesh and blood cupped in his hand.Is that\u2026.My heart?Bang!His palm clenched and blood splattered!Poof!!The depraved man planted himself on the ground, his wide-open eyes filled with confusion, not understanding what had happened until his death.Shu Shi retracted his right hand.His palm was crystal clear like jade, untouched by a trace of dirt.Staring at Shi Meng, he smiled and said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything yet?\u201dShi Meng\u2019s expression was very serious.When did Shu Shi move?He hadn\u2019t seen him at all!This person had actually hidden his strength!Yet now that he had come to this point, there was no turning back, only one of the two of them could leave alive!\u201cHaaa!\u201dShi Meng breathed backwards as his body surged, his clothes were torn apart, and his already sturdy body swelled several times!His muscles bulged and her qi and blood were dragon-like, as if he was a ferocious beast in human form!\u201cSu Shi, prepare to die!\u201dShi Meng\u2019s eyes turned red like blood and his ferocious light was revealed!Shu Shi stretched out his hand and green light emerged from his palm, his expression calm and indifferent.\u201cThe first step to fighting the fate of the heavens is to clear Fengsha City.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That\u2019s really stingy.Shu Shi snorted unhappily.Back then, he could get 20 plot points for talking to Zhan Qingchen, but now that he had killed Shi Meng with his own hands, he was only given 3 points alone.A bit shabby indeed.But that\u2019s understandable.Shi Meng was just a minor supporting character, his life and death had little impact on the rest of the plot.Just like that depraved man, who didn\u2019t even have 1 plot point after killing him, showing that he was just an insignificant little ant.It seems that this system encourages me to be more involved in the main plot.The corner of Shu Shi\u2019s mouth curled up slightly, \u201cBased on the timing, it shouldn\u2019t be long now\u2026\u201dBai Qing was still obediently covering her eyes when a familiar voice sounded in her ears.\u201cOkay, you can open it now.\u201dShe released her hand and looked up, only to see that amidst the rain of blood, Shu Shi was dressed in white, untouched by dirt, his eyes looking at her gently.\u201cYou were scared earlier, weren\u2019t you?\u201dBai Qing deflated her mouth, tears welling up in her eyes, but in the end, she couldn\u2019t help herself and threw herself into his arms like a baby to its mother.\u201cHuuuuuuu~~\u201d\u201cMaster, I was so scared, I thought you were really dead!\u201dShu Shi rubbed her tiny head and joked, \u201cI already died once, I\u2019m now immortal.\u201dIn his heart, he secretly pondered.Looks like I have to find a way to strengthen Bai Qing, I can\u2019t always be there to protect her.I just don\u2019t know if the rewards exchanged by the system can be used for others?It took a while for Bai Qing to subside.She raised her head and saw Su Shi\u2019s chest wet with tears, and her little face couldn\u2019t help but blush.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, master, I lost control.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201dShu Shi didn\u2019t mind anything about it.Seeing the mess nearby, Bai Qing was worried, \u201cMaster, what should we do about this?\u201dKilling a fellow disciple was a big taboo.Although Shu Shi had a good reason, no one else could prove that he was the one actually targeted for murder.Shu Shi smiled, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dHe looked towards the Demon Palace, and a cold glint crossed his eyes.\u201cShi Meng is just the beginning.\u201d\u2026\u2026Demon PalaceThe crowd of people still gathered here.Without Shi Meng\u2019s approval, they dared not leave without permission.\u201cIsn\u2019t what Commander Shi did too extreme?

This is commander Shi Meng!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dBefore they had time to react, a man and woman slowly walked in.The man walked to the first place and sat down, while the young girl stood behind him in a docile manner.\u201cEveryone, long time no see.\u201dShu Shi smiled brightly.There was silence in the hall!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 \u2013 My rules are the rules!The lobby was eerily quiet.Looking at the head on the floor, the faces of the crowd turned blue and their eyes were filled with disbelief.This face was too familiar to them.It was none other than Shi Meng!Just a moment ago, he was so proud of himself, but in just half an hour, his head had been cut off!Shi Meng was a cultivator in the Realm of Golden Elixir, with his Blood Beast Demonic Body at its peak, his flesh had been refined to the extreme, and his combat strength was superior to others in his realm!Even in the Southwest Region, he was a famous strong man!How could he die so suddenly?And \u2026\u2026How did Shu Shi come back?The changes that occurred made everyone step back slightly.At this point, someone broke the silence and asked aloud, \u201cCommander Shu, what, what\u2019s going on here?\u201dShu Shi said lightly, \u201cShi Meng tried to break the law by hurting me, and together with his accomplice, the two were directly executed by me .\u201d\u201cExecuted on the spot?\u201dHearing his casual tone, the crowd couldn\u2019t help but shiver!Yet at the same time there were some doubters:Could Shu Shi really kill Shi Meng?\u201cShu Shi, my brother is the second in command at Fengsha City, do you have any solid evidence to prove that he is plotting against you?\u201dA strong man stood up and asked loudly.This man was well-built and looked slightly similar to Shi Meng.At this moment, his fists were clenched and his eyes were bloodshot as he gritted his teeth and glared at Shu Shi.He looked like he wanted to eat his flesh alive.Shi Jin.Shi Meng\u2019s own brother.Although his cultivation was not as good as Shi Meng\u2019s, he had reached the late stage of Realm Foundation Establishment and was known as a good fighter in Fengsha City.\u201cEvidence?\u201dShu Shi pointed at the head on the ground, \u201cIsn\u2019t this the proof? If he wasn\u2019t trying to harm me, how could I move to kill him?\u201dShi Jin snorted coldly, \u201cThat\u2019s just a one-sided statement, is there anyone else who can prove it?\u201dShu Shi asked rhetorically, \u201cWhat if no one can prove it?\u201d\u201cMy brother is a cultivator at the Realm of Golden Elixir while you are only at the Realm Foundation Establishment, there is absolutely no way you can be my brother\u2019s match.\u201d\u201cWhere have you been these past few days since you disappeared? Why didn\u2019t Zhan Qingchen kill you?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t explain yourself clearly, I have every reason to suspect you of colluding with outsiders and killing fellow disciples!\u201dShi Jin got up.Without even mentioning what Shi Meng had done, he came haughtily towards Shu Shi.The eyes of the crowd flashed.This time there was a good show to watch.Shu Shi\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly, \u201cI did something and need to explain to you?\u201dShi Jin\u2019s scalp tingled, his spine was cold, and his body sweat stood up.There was a sudden creeping sense of fear.\u201cI will report this matter to the sect, and then the sect will make its own decision on what is right and what is wrong!\u201dWith that, he was about to get up and leave.A bad feeling grew in his heart, and his intuition told him that he shouldn\u2019t stay here for long!Shu Shi did not stop him, but gave him a playful look.Just as Shi Jin walked to the door, the door slammed shut with a bang.No matter how hard he pushed or pulled it, it remained motionless.\u201cShu Shi, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cShi Meng confessed before he died that you were one of his accomplices, and according to sect\u2019s rules, you can be executed on the spot!\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not possible, you\u2019re slandering!\u201dShi Jin looked puzzled and angrily rebuked, \u201cEmpty words are not evidence, you must show real evidence! Even if you suspect me, you can only report it to the sect, you can\u2019t punish me personally, it\u2019s not according to the rules!\u201dShu Shi\u2019s voice was ice-cold, \u201cIn Fengsa City, my rules are the rules!\u201d\u201cYou \u2026\u2026\u201dSwoop!The sound of breaking air rang out and Shi Jin froze in place.A red line appeared on his neck and blood gushed out like a spring, and he fell to the ground with a \u201cpop\u201d.His breath was gone in an instant!The crowd looked on in awe at this scene.Shi Jin was still a cultivator at the Late Stage of Realm Foundation Establishment, but he didn\u2019t even have the strength to resist!Shu Shi spoke sternly without compassion, as he looked around, all eyes avoided and no one dared to look at him.\u201cShi Jin planned a rebellion and was killed by this commander himself, do you have any complaints?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIt was Shi Jin who deserved to die.\u201d\u201cWe can testify for the commander.\u201dEveryone exclaimed in unison.Now that even Shi Meng\u2019s brother was dead, who would dare to offend Shu Shi?\u201cAlright, the post of deputy commander is temporarily vacant, those who are interested can come and talk to me.\u201d\u201cAlso, you should always remember that in Fengsa City, only my orders are absolute.\u201dAfter saying that, Shu Shi got up and left, with Bai Qing following behind him.The hall once again became deathly quiet.The corpse lay desolate on the floor, blood snaking at everyone\u2019s feet.After a long time, someone whispered, \u201cWhy does it feel like Commander Shu \u2026\u2026 is a different person?\u201dHis strength was unfathomable, his methods ruthless, and even his demeanor became extremely arrogant .However, the more things happened, it made everyone\u2019s hearts full of anticipation.\u201cFengsa Xity, might really rise!\u201d\u2026\u2026The two people walked out the door.Bai Qing asked anxiously, \u201cMaster, is it really okay to kill someone in public like this?\u201dShu Shi said indifferently, \u201cIf you don\u2019t cut the grass to the root, the spring breeze will blow and it will grow again. Whether Shi Jin will jump out or not, I will not let him leave alive.\u201d\u201cAs for the others, there is absolutely no need to worry.\u201d\u201cDemonic paths fear power more than virtue, only when they are made to fear will they understand what power is!\u201dBai Qing looked at him dumbfounded, always feeling that her own master was different now.But what exactly was different could not be told.Looking at Su Shi\u2019s handsome face, she shook her head, driving away the distracting thoughts, her eyes smiling into a curved crescent moon.No matter what, master will always be my master!And at that moment, in Shu Shi\u2019s ears, a system alert sounded.[Fengsa City\u2019s prestige is rising, affecting the next plot trend, gaining 10 plot points!]\u201c10 points?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After use, the target\u2019s cultivation will be raised by one small realm, and life and death will be completely under the host\u2019s control].[Instructions for use: The target must be completely voluntary, and his/her cultivation base can never be raised after use].\u201cIt\u2019s a bit too restrictive\u2026\u201dShu Shi thought about it and asked, \u201cDoes this little realm rising ignore the realm threshold? For example, if I use it for someone at the Late Stage of Foundation Establishment, what effect will it have?\u201dThe system quickly provided an answer.[If used on someone at the Late Stage of Realm Foundation Establishment, it will automatically advance to the Early Stage of Golden Elixir Realm].\u201cHoly cow! What a good thing!\u201dShu Shi looked excited.There were six Talismans of Life and Death here, which meant that he could create six cultivators in the Realm of Golden Elixir who were completely within his control!One should know that previously, in the entire Fengsa City, there was only one person who was in the Realm of Golden Elixir, namely Shi Meng!Six Early Stage of Golden Elixir Realm practitioners would be enough to walk arrogantly in the Southwest Region as long as they did not meet someone in the Realm of Nascent Soul!As for the candidates, there was absolutely no need to worry.There were too many people who had been stuck in the Realm Foundation Establishment and had no hope of reaching the Realm of Golden Elixir in their entire lives.If he could help them reach the Golden Elixir Realm, even if the conditions were difficult, there would be people who wanted to participate!Shu Shi rummaged through the store.The Yin Yang Talisman of Life and Death had a price of 30 plot points per piece.\u201cThe price is acceptable, if there is still a need for it in the future I just need to go back and buy it again.\u201d\u201cWait, 30 plot points \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat means I spend 10 points and unlock 180 points worth of prizes?\u201dShu Shi scratched his head.It had multiplied eighteen times out of thin air!How lucky I am!\u2026\u2026Land of the Great Clouds.There is a fairyland in the depths of the white clouds.If you pass by a large sect protection formation, you will be greatly surprised by the sight before you.Amidst the vast sea of clouds, the peak seems hidden.At the top of the peak is an ancient pavilion, shadowed by clouds, and from afar you can feel the endless rhythm.The melodious sound of bells and white cranes flapping their wings is the perfect picture of fairyland.This is where Tianji Pavilion, a major Righteous sect, has its mountain gate.In a quiet room.Zhan Qingchen sat cross-legged on the mat.Her eyes were slightly closed and her five senses were facing heaven, as if she was already absorbed in meditation.However, she only lasted less than half a quarter of an hour before she collapsed to the floor in a heap.\u201cDamn it, I can\u2019t meditate at all!\u201dShe clutched her hair dejectedly, her hair becoming disheveled.Meditation was the best way to experience heaven and earth.Every day, Zhan Qingchen would set aside an hour to sit and meditate.This habit had been maintained for over ten years.However, ever since she separated from Shu Shi, she seemed to have lost the ability to meditate.As soon as she closed her eyes, that handsome and hateful face would appear, and the places he had kissed would become itchy.It was as if there was a kitten scratching around in her heart.\u201cPlease, am I being poisoned?\u201d\u201cWhy is my mind full of that Shu Shi guy!\u201dZhan Qingchen covered her hot pretty face and rolled on the floor.No wonder Master always said that the love between men and women is a poison that pierces the heart!\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing I can do about it\u2026.\u201dKnock knock.There was a knock on the door of the room.Zhan Qingchen immediately sat up straight, \u201cCough, What is it?\u201dThe voice of a maid came from outside the door, \u201cChief Zhan, Sect Master has summoned you.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, I will go there immediately.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe maid turned to leave.Zhan Qingchen cupped her fair, round chin and wondered, \u201cWhat is Master suddenly looking for me for?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way she knows that I\u2019m in love!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Shu Shi is dead?\u201dSikong Lanyue was puzzled, \u201cThe person you killed with your own hands is still unclear to you?\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes drifted and she said faintly, \u201cI did stab him in the vitals at the time, but then there was a slight accident \u2026\u2026 cough, how did you determine that he was dead?\u201dSikong Lanyue didn\u2019t think much of it and said, \u201cNetherworld Demon Empress issued a Black Killing Order to kill you to avenge Shu Shi, isn\u2019t the answer obvious?\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201dZhan Qingchen breathed a sigh of relief.It was clear that this was a misunderstanding.Shu Shi is not dead at all, it\u2019s just that the Demon Empress doesn\u2019t know it yet.But there was no way she could explain this, in case it aroused the Master\u2019s suspicion.Seeing her silent, Sikong Lanyue thought she was afraid and said comfortingly, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be too afraid, this Black Killing Order is complicated but as long as you remain in the sect, no one can touch a single hair on your head.\u201dSaying this, Sikong Lanyue was actually also somewhat uneasy.Because when the Black Killing Order came out, they would not stop until the target was dead.As the highest level killing unit of the Demon Sect, it had been decades since the Order had appeared.This time, it was suddenly issued without warning.They even sent Western Saint Cen Baihu!Under the Demon Empress were four Saints, twenty-eight constellations, and one hundred and ninety-six demon generals.Being a demon general was enough to be in charge of city affairs.A constellation was in charge of a continent.And the Saints did not go out at will and represented the top combat power of the demonic sect.This time, sending out the Western Saint showed how strong the Netherworld Demon Empress\u2019 killing intent was!And that was to fight Zhan Qingchen, a Chief Disciple, who had nothing less than declared war on the entire Tianji Pavilion!Although Nanli City was important, but the Shu family was not the only way to control the city. Why would they go to such lengths?Sikong Lanyue pondered darkly.Zhan Qingchen frowned, \u201cDoes Master mean this disciple can only stay in the sect from now on?\u201dSikong Lanyue nodded, \u201cUnless the Demon Empress retracts the order, it\u2019s too dangerous to venture outside.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dZhan Qingchen lowered her head sadly.Didn\u2019t that mean I wouldn\u2019t be able to see Shu Shi for a long time?\u201cThe mundane world is flashy and chaotic, it\u2019s good to stay in the sect, lest you let the mundane world affect your dao heart.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s cheeks flushed slightly.Her daoist heart has been corrupted by Shu Shi \u2026\u2026\u201cMaster, is the mundane world really as terrifying as you say?\u201d Zhan Qingchen couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cOf course.\u201dSikong Lanyue said, \u201cWhen treading the path of immortality, you must forget your emotions and forget your desires. The affairs of men and women will only cloud the dao and undermine your foundation, pulling you into the abyss of degradation.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dZhan Qingchen said curiously, \u201cThen how does Master know all this?\u201dSikong Lanyue replied, \u201cMy Master told me about it.\u201dZhan Qingchen understood, \u201cThat means you haven\u2019t actually tried it?\u201dSikong Lanyue frowned and said, \u201cHow could I possibly try such a dirty thing?\u201dZhan Qingchen bit his lip and said carefully, \u201cAction is a way to confirm whether knowledge is true before coming to a conclusion. Master must fall in love first, what if it is completely different from what you imagined?\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201dSikong Lanyue froze for a moment, and then the clouds fluctuated violently.\u201cHow dare you ask me to fall in love?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just giving you advice \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cPresumptuous! You will be punished with half a month of seclusion!\u201d\u201cI \u2026\u2026\u201dBefore Zhan Qingchen could finish her sentence, Sikong Lanyue waved her sleeve robe and directly threw her out.\u201cThis rebel, getting more and more impudent, how dare you utter such obscenities in front of me!\u201dSikong Lanyue\u2019s body was surrounded by clouds and mist, clearly not feeling happy.After a long time, humming could be heard in the room.\u201cThe love between a man and a woman is a poison that pierces the heart. I will never be fooled!\u201d\u2026\u2026Fengsha City.In the study, Shu Shi leisurely sipped his tea, and the fragrant aroma of the tea permeated the air.Opposite him stood six men, looking somewhat frightened and agitated.\u201cCommander Shu, what were your orders to summon us here?\u201dOne of them asked cautiously.After seeing Shu Shi\u2019s methods, facing this Commander again, several people were under great pressure in their hearts.Shu Shi put down his teacup and cleared his throat.\u201cI will give you all an opportunity, it depends on you whether you can achieve it, though.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 \u2013 We swear to follow Commander Shu to the death!\u201cOpportunity?\u201d\u201cWhat the commander means is \u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi did not reply, but asked rhetorically, \u201cHow long have you guys been stuck at the Late Stage of Foundation Establishment Realm?\u201d\u201cSix years.\u201d\u201cEight years.\u201d\u201cMore than seven years so far.\u201dSeveral people gave their answers.\u201cThat long?\u201dShu Shi shook his head, \u201cWith your talent, I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to reach the Realm of Golden Elixir in your lifetime.\u201dSeveral people looked at each other with bitter expressions.Although his words were blunt, it had to be recognized that this was the truth.They were just ordinary people, without talent or resources, and the Late Stage of Foundation Establishment was the limit of what could be achieved.As for the Golden Elixir Realm?One did not even dare to dream of it.\u201cIt is already a great blessing for us fools to be able to qualify to be accepted into this sect, how can we dare to expect more?\u201d\u201cIt is good to be self-aware.\u201dShu Shi smiled, \u201cBut what if I say that I can let you break through to the Golden Elixir Realm?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cGolden Elixir Realm? Don\u2019t joke about it, Commander.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?\u201dSome people clearly did not believe it.Their own situation was clear to themselves, trapped in the Foundation Establishment for so many years, their roots and bones had long since decayed.Even if they were given more resources now, their cultivation base would not improve in the slightest.Shu Shi said indifferently, \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m joking? Wu Mang.\u201d\u201cThis subordinate is here.\u201dA strong man stepped forward.This man stood behind several people and was silent without speaking just now.Shu Shi gestured, \u201cLet them take a look.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWu Mang\u2019s eyes changed.His clothes were tempestuous, and the spiritual energy around him surged as if it were a shocking wave!Feeling that terrifying aura, the faces of the crowd couldn\u2019t help but change.\u201cWu Mang, you, you \u2026\u2026\u201dWu Mang\u2019s voice was low, \u201cThanks to the commander\u2019s help, I have entered the Golden Elixir Realm.\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes were dumbfounded.Although they couldn\u2019t believe it, the Wu Mang before them was indeed really in the Realm of Golden Elixir!Did Shu Shi really have the power to make people break through the realm?Their breath caught slightly.If they could step into the Realm of Golden Elixir, not to mention Fengsha City, they would even amount to a powerhouse in the Southwest Region!If they had the chance to become Demon Generals, then their future would become even more boundless!But \u2026\u2026There is no free lunch under the heavens, would Shu Shi be so kind?Shu Shi took out five pieces of talisman paper and threw them in front of him.\u201cSwallow these talismans and you can enter the Golden Elixir Realm, but from now on your life will be in my hands, so you can think about it before you make a decision.\u201dLooking at the dark talisman paper in front of them, the crowd\u2019s expressions changed as they quickly thought about the pros and cons.The atmosphere was quiet for a while.Shu Shi was not in a hurry either, his fingers gently tapping on the table.Each tap seemed to ring in people\u2019s hearts.At this moment, Wu Mang spoke, \u201cIn this chaotic world, it is even difficult for people in the Realm Foundation Establishment to protect themselves, so one day you might die on the streets. Why not seize the opportunity to change your fate and follow Commander Shu to achieve some hegemony?\u201d\u201cYou already have nothing, what else is there to doubt?\u201d\u201cDamn it, let me come!\u201dOne of them grabbed the talisman paper, put it directly into his mouth and swallowed it.In the next instant, his aura skyrocketed!The remaining few people also pressed and swallowed the talisman paper.Boom!The wind whistled and spiritual energy stirred.In an instant, the five of them had entered the Golden Elixir Realm!\u201cIs this the power of the Realm of Golden Elixir?\u201dFeeling the unprecedented power within their bodies, those people looked extremely excited.This feeling was too wonderful!Poof.Wu Mang knelt down on one knee and said in a loud voice, \u201cI am willing to follow Commander Shu to the death!\u201dThe remaining five people reacted and knelt down, their eyes amazed and excited.\u201cWe swear to follow Commander Shu to the death!\u201dShu Shi nodded in satisfaction.These people were carefully selected by him.Their foundations were extremely clean, and most importantly, they were not tied to anything or anyone.\u201cThe five of you will take the name \u2018Shadow\u2019, with serial numbers from one to five, you will all be under Wu Mang\u2019s command.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t remember everyone\u2019s names.\u201cThank you, Commander.\u201dThe five people bowed their heads.Shu Shi waved his hand, \u201cWu Mang stays behind, the others may leave.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe five people bowed and retreated.After they went out, Shu Shi said, \u201cThe position of deputy commander, for now, will be yours.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWu Mang did not refuse either.Shu Shi asked again, \u201cWhat is the situation in the sect?\u201dWu Mang replied, \u201cReporting to the commander! The sect envoy has already arrived in the Southwest Region, and if we calculate the time, he will soon arrive in Fengsha City.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dSu Shi stood up, \u201cLet\u2019s go, follow me to greet the envoy.\u201dHis expression was calm, with a cold light flashing under his eyes.\u2026\u2026Demon Palace.In the center of the hall, the black-clothed envoy sat down hard in the top seat, \u201cWhere is Commander Shi, why doesn\u2019t he come to see me?\u201dThe Demon Sect disciples below bowed their heads in silence.Seeing this, the black-clothed envoy\u2019s brows furrowed and he slapped the table hard.\u201cI ask you, are you all mute?\u201dThe crowd remained silent.It was as if they had collectively gone deaf.\u201cSassy!\u201dJust as he was about to attack, a faint voice rang out.\u201cI didn\u2019t know the messenger have arrived, so I apologize for not welcoming you, I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dThe envoy in black looked up.Only to see a sturdy figure walking slowly in.The crowd, which had previously remained silent, moved in response and fell to the ground on one knee, saying in unison, \u201cGreetings, Commander Shu!\u201dSeeing that fair and handsome face, the black-clothed envoy\u2019s eyebrows couldn\u2019t help but jump!\u201cShu Shi?!\u201dThis guy isn\u2019t dead yet?!Su Shi walked towards him.Standing straight and smiling brightly.\u201cExcuse me, please, you are sitting in my seat.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 \u2013 Su Shi is actually the Supreme Genius?The envoy in black froze.Shu Shi?Didn\u2019t this person die at the hands of Zhan Qingchen?The Sect had just decided not long ago to let Shi Meng take over the post of Commander of Fengsha City.However, this Shu Shi in front of him seemed to be in good health.\u201cEnvoy, you have taken my seat.\u201d\u201cYou \u2026\u2026\u201dThe black-clothed envoy was just about to say something when his eyes met Shu Shi\u2019s.The pair of eyes were dark and deep, as if they were a bottomless sea, concealing waves of tyrannical and turbulent horror.The black-clothed envoy\u2019s heart trembled and he stood up uncontrollably.Shu Shi sat down indifferently and said, \u201cGo, bring a chair for the envoy.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWu Mang picked up a chair and placed it beside Shu Shi.\u201cMr. Envoy, please sit down.\u201dThe black-clothed envoy came back to his sense, and his face suddenly looked a little ugly.I had actually been bullied by this brat?\u201cCommander Shu is actually unharmed? It seems that your ability to escape is indeed good.\u201dThe black-clothed envoy\u2019s tone was full of mockery.Shu Shi sighed, \u201cI am ashamed to say that Zhan Qingchen is truly exceptional in her strength, I used all my strength and she was still able to escape.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe black-clothed Envoy said amusedly, \u201cFrom what you said, it seems like you have the upper hand?\u201dShu Shi thought seriously and said, \u201cActually it should be considered a draw.\u201dHe kissed Zhan Qingchen twice after she stabbed him with a sword.So it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to call it a draw.The envoy in black was almost exasperated.Brat, you can still boast when you were made to almost die?Zhan Qingchen is the Chief Disciple of Tianji Pavilion, the number one genius of the Righteous path\u2019s younger generation.You are only at the Realm of Foundation Establishment, how are you qualified to compete with her?At that moment, the envoy in black remembered something and looked around, \u201cWhere did Shi Meng go? Why haven\u2019t I seen him yet?\u201d\u201cOh that\u2019s unfortunate, but it\u2019s a long story.\u201dShu Shi sighed, his voice low, \u201cI have always treated Deputy Shi as a brother, but he attempted to kill me, fortunately I found out in advance and had him executed on the spot.\u201d\u201cExecuted on the spot?\u201dThe envoy in black froze, and then exclaimed, \u201cYou mean you killed Shi Meng?!\u201dShu Shi corrected, \u201cIt was an act of self-defense.\u201dThe envoy in black swallowed.Shi Meng was a person in the Realm of Golden Elixir, and he had just died so easily?\u201cYou said that he attempted to kill you, can anyone prove it for you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWe can all testify for Commander Shu.\u201d\u201cShi Meng deserves to die for plotting that assassination.\u201dThe crowd below advanced one after another.Shu Shi stretched out his hand with an innocent look as if to say 'see?\u201dThe envoy in black saw this and frowned.The previous Fengsha City could be described as scattered chaos.Although Shu Shi was the commander, he was completely unable to control the people.Moreover, after several failures, his prestige had fallen down.But now.This group of disciples looked at him and their attitude was completely different from before.The envoy in black was puzzled, \u201cEven so, Shi Meng is a powerful Golden Elixir Realm, how did Commande r Shu kill him?\u201dShu Shi smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like Fengsha City only has one Golden Elixir Realm practicioner.\u201dThe envoy in black startled.\u201cYou mean\u2026.\u201dUnable to continue his words, the envoy fell silent only to see a faint light flickering in Shu Shi\u2019s eyes, as if two green lotuses were slowly blooming, emitting a terrifying aura that destroyed everything.The black-clothed envoy\u2019s spine tingled.Shu Shi had actually broken through to the Golden Elixir Realm!No wonder he could kill Shi Meng with his own hands!For being a Golden Elixir cultivator at age of twenty, one could already be ranked among the top heavenly talents!So he wasn\u2019t bragging when he said he had a draw against Zhan Qingchen!The black-clothed Envoy had completely put away his disdain.With Shu Shi\u2019s age and endless future potential, even he didn\u2019t dare to offend him so easily from now on.\u201cI believe in Commander Shu, but Shi Meng has a position, I still have to report this matter to the sect.\u201dShu Shi nodded and said, \u201cIt should be.\u201dThe envoy in black breathed a sigh of relief and said with a smile, \u201cMany thanks to Commander Shu for understanding.\u201dThere was a one hundred and eighty degree change in attitude.\u201cI came here this time to inform Commander Shu that the sect is preparing to completely rid of Righteous force from Southwest Region.\u201d\u201cCommander Shu is requested to lead the Fengsha City backbone to Yulin City as soon as possible to discuss this matter together.\u201d\u201cYulin City?\u201dShu Shi\u2019s eyes flashed.The timeline was basically the same, it seemed like the main storyline was about to begin!His heart was turbulent, but on the surface he still seemed calm, \u201cUnderstood, I will go there as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cAlright, then I won\u2019t bother you any further .\u201dThe envoy in black stood up and cupped his hands, \u201cI\u2019ll take my leave first.\u201dShu Shi nodded his head, \u201cTake care, envoy.\u201d\u201cMay Commander Shu be blessed with good health.\u201dThe envoy in black turned around and walked out of the lobby.Looking at his back, Wu Mang whispered, \u201cCommander, if Shi Meng\u2019s matter is known by the sect, it might be a little troublesome, should we escort the envoy halfway \u2026\u2026?\u201dHe said and made a motion of cutting his throat.Shu Shi shook his head and said, \u201cNo need.\u201dIt was Shi Meng who had intended to kill him from beginning, so even if the sect investigated this he was not afraid.If he pursued the envoy in secret, he would be asking for trouble instead.\u201cPack up and prepare to leave for Yulin City!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u2026\u2026There were nine cities in the Southwest Region.Except for Nanli City, which was still under the control of the imperial dynasty, the other eight cities had been infiltrated by the Demonic Sect.Yulin City was the richest and most powerful among these cities.Its city walls were tall and sturdy, and above its gates were the words \u2018Yulin\u2019 painted with silver and iron hooks.The streets of the city are wide and paved with bluestones, and the streets are lined with shops and pavilions with ancient charm.The town was bustling with people.A man and a woman walked slowly through the streets.The man was tall and erect, with a handsome face, while the woman had clear eyebrows and a graceful figure.It was Shu Shi and Bai Qing.They were like a beautiful couple, very eye-catching, attracting the attention of pedestrians.At this moment, a group of merchants passed by, and the streets became a little crowded.\u201cBe careful.\u201dShu Shi naturally grabbed Bai Qing\u2019s hand.Bai Qing shuddered.Feeling the heat coming from her palm, her heart almost jumped into her throat.Am I really holding hands with master?It\u2019s so intense!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 \u2013 Green Frost Sword, Heavenly Sword Draw Technique!Bai Qing followed behind Shu Shi even as he walked.Feeling the warmth coming from his palm, her small face burned slightly.Master\u2019s hands are so warm.Looking at Shu Shi\u2019s handsome face, there seemed to be a ripple in Bai Qing\u2019s eyes as she secretly gripped his hand a little tighter.Shu Shi did not notice her small movement.He looked like he was taking a walk, but in reality he was sketching out a road pattern in his mind.Although Shu Shi was familiar with the plot, a novel was a novel after all, and the description of the city was basically a passing commentary.One had to see it for themselves to understand it.At that moment, the two of them passed through a small alley, and a burst of iron sounds rang out from within.Shu Shi\u2019s footsteps suddenly stopped.\u201cMaster, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dBai Qing raised her head in confusion.Shu Shi smiled faintly, \u201cIf I guessed correctly, I should have found something good.\u201dThe two of them walked into an alley.They only saw a dilapidated blacksmith shop at the end of the alley.A burly man with bare shoulders stood outside, swinging a hammer and banging away at the hot iron.Sparks flew and an incessant \u201cclanking\u201d sound could be heard.\u201cExcuse me, is this Yu the blacksmith?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dThe strong man stopped knocking and looked at the handsome man in front of him, puzzled, \u201cMy surname is Yu \u2026\u2026 You recognize me?\u201dShu Shi\u2019s smile increased even more, \u201c I am here because I heard of your good reputation and want to buy a sword.\u201dBlacksmith Yu didn\u2019t think much of it and nodded, \u201cThe sword is inside the house, come in and have a look.\u201dShu Shi walked into the room and saw that the walls were covered with all kinds of long swords.Although sharp, they were all of mortal quality.He swept his gaze across and stopped at a pile of sword embryos in the corner.Walking over and rummaging through it, he picked up a lump of dark-colored iron.\u201cHow much are you selling this for?\u201d\u201cThis?\u201dBlacksmith Yu shook his head, \u201cThese are just sword embryos, they haven\u2019t even begun to be forged yet.\u201d\u201cI know, I only like sword embryos.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNot waiting for him to say anything, Shu Shi directly threw the gold bar, \u201cI\u2019ll take this one, just take the change.\u201dThen he turned around and left with Bai Qing.Weighing the gold bar in his hand, Blacksmith Yu couldn\u2019t help but scratch his head for a while.\u201cWhere did this fool come from, exchanging gold for scrap metal?\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cMaster, is this the good stuff you were talking about?\u201dAfter walking out of the alley, Bai Qing asked with a puzzled look on her face.This thing was so dark that it really couldn\u2019t see what value it had.\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken \u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi\u2019s spiritual power flowed and was injected into the sword embryo.Ka-ching.With a crisp sound, the sword embryo cracked inch by inch and shattered into pieces under Bai Qing\u2019s astonished gaze.A long sword like autumn water was revealed.The sword\u2019s aura was extremely attractive as it shone with a cold light!Bai Qing was astonished.So there was a treasure sword hidden within this sword embryo!But how did my master know about it?It was as if he had prior knowledge!Shu Shi snapped his fingers at the sword, and the long sword clanged, its light as green as ice and snow.\u201cGood sword.\u201d[The host has obtained a high-grade spiritual treasure, \u201cGreen Frost Sword\u201d, successfully deprived the main character of luck and affected the subsequent plot, gaining 8 plot points.][Keep up the good work]\u201cNot bad.\u201dShu Shi nodded in satisfaction.This sword was named Green Frost Sword and had been stored in a blacksmith shop in Yulin City.It was later acquired by the protagonist \u201cYe Xiao\u201d and greatly improved his combat power at that time.Thinking of the so-called \u201cFavored Son of Heaven\u201d, Shu Shi\u2019s eyes gradually became cold.When he played the role of the villain, this Ye Xiao would not infrequently jump out and challenged him.With the aura of a protagonist, he acted brainlessly and recklessly.Stupid and narrow-minded.Shu Shi had several opportunities to get him killed, but had to continue playing the role as a tool to keep the plot going.But it was different now.The Green Frost Sword is just the beginning.You want to reach the top just by relying on your luck? Sorry, but the luck of heaven is not on your side this time!I wonder how many plot points can be earned for killing the protagonist?Shu Shi was very curious about this.Checking the system panel.The last time he killed Shi Meng, he earned 3 plot points, plus 8 points this time, which was enough to open the Blind Box.Opened the prize pool and touched a random prize box.A light flashed and a signal sounded.[Mystical Ability: Heavenly Sword Draw Technique]Just now I got the Green Frost Sword and then Sword Draw Technique?And it\u2019s also heavenly ranked?Shu Shi himself froze,\u00a0This luck is too inexplicable, it can\u2019t be I\u2019m the real protagonist, right?The mass of light entered the sea of consciousness, and the feeling surged into his mind.This Mystical Ability is simple!So simple that there was only one action: drawing the sword.However, this simple move was a terrifying killing move that could cut through everything!At the peak of cultivation, even the heavens could be cut in half!Shu Shi held the Green Frost Sword in his hand, but his feelings were completely different from what he had just felt.The sword seemed to have spiritual properties, vibrating and chirping, connected with his mind, like an extension of his body.It seems that this mystical ability has also strengthened my perception of the dao of the sword.This is a big jackpot!Shu Shi\u2019s heart soared.It was a pity that he was in the middle of the city center and could not try out the power of this might mystical ability.\u2026\u2026After obtaining the treasure, this walk was almost complete.They found a clean inn and decided to get two rooms to stay in first.\u201cOnly one room left?\u201dShu Shi frowned at the innkeeper.The innkeeper said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where so many out-of-towners have come from these days, but all the inns in this town are full, and this inn just got one room vacated.\u201dShu Shi\u2019s eyes flashed, \u201cOut-of-towners?\u201dIt seemed that people from the Demon Sect in other cities had arrived one after another.The innkeeper asked, \u201cDo you want to stay, customer? If you don\u2019t stay, there are people waiting for this room.\u201d\u201cThis is \u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi hesitated for a moment.Bai Qing\u2019s small face flushed as she whispered, \u201cMaster, I, I don\u2019t mind \u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 \u2013 Bai Qing wants to be with Master forever!Shu Shi and Bai Qing ended up staying in the same room.After all, all the inns in Yulin City were full, so they couldn\u2019t sleep on the street, right?Push open the door and enter the room.They saw pink curtains hanging over the bamboo couch, and even the mattress had a red mandarin duck design.Bai Qing\u2019s face flushed slightly when she saw it.\u201cThis inn is so unworthy, why is the living room decorated like a wedding room?\u201dShu Shi sat on the bamboo couch and said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, go to bed and rest, I\u2019ll just meditate here.\u201dBai Qing shook her head, \u201cHow can there be a master sitting while his servant is sleeping?\u201dShu Shi said, \u201cI always treat you as a friend, there is no difference between master and servant in my heart, so I don\u2019t need to care about these empty courtesy.\u201d\u201cA servant girl is a servant girl, you may not care about it, but I care about it.\u201dBai Qing said stubbornly, \u201cIf you insist on meditating, then I will sit with you.\u201dSaying so, she actually moved to the bamboo couch and sat beside him.Shu Shi frowned slightly.To him, there wasn\u2019t difference between meditating and sleeping.But for Bai Qing, it was totally different.She didn\u2019t have any cultivation in her body, and sitting like this overnight would be too much for her body.Looking at that stubborn little face, Shu Shi simply stopped thinking about it, \u201cAnyway, that bed is big enough, so it won\u2019t be a problem for both of us to sleep at the same time.\u201d\u201cAt the same time?\u201dBai Qing\u2019s eyes rolled upwards.Shu Shi took off his robe and hung it up, then lay comfortably on the bed.\u201cWhy, you insist on meditating with me, but not sleeping with me?\u201d\u201cI \u2026\u2026\u201dBai Qing couldn\u2019t even speak clearly, her heart racing.Does this master of mine really want to share a bed with me?This is too embarrassing!She hesitated for a long time, but finally walked carefully to the bedside.\u201cMaster, I\u2019ll just sleep next to \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShhh.\u201dBefore the words were finished, she was instantly pulled into Shu Shi\u2019s arms.Bai Qing was stiff, as if she was a doll.Leaning against that broad chest, she couldn\u2019t lift any strength, and her eyes were misty and seemed to be steaming.Her cheeks burned and she whispered, \u201cMaster, this will make it impossible for me to get married in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt seems that I can only serve you as a maid for the rest of my life.\u201dShu Shi said amusedly, \u201cIs that your plan?\u201dBai Qing raised her small face with a determined look, \u201cAnyway, I will live with master.\u201dShu Shi pinched her cheek, \u201cI know, you will always be by my side.\u201dBai Qing\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly, and a satisfied smile appeared on her pretty face.She didn\u2019t know if it was because she was too tired from walking or Shu Shi\u2019s breath was too fragrant.In no time, she was already fast asleep.Shu Shi gently let her go and got up to sit on the chair at the side.Half an hour later, there was a small knock on the window.\u201cCome in.\u201dThe window was pushed open and a figure floated in, kneeling on one knee in front of Shu Shi.It was none other than Wu Mang.\u201cThis subordinate salutes the Commander. \u201dGlancing at Bai Qing lying on the bed, his heart skipped a beat and he lowered his head without looking away.Shu Shi knew he misunderstood, but didn\u2019t bother to explain, and asked, \u201cHave Shadow #1 and the others already found a place to settle down?\u201dWu Mang nodded and said, \u201cYes, they are nearby here.\u201dShu Shi asked again, \u201cHave you already found out anything about the information I asked you to?\u201dWu Mang replied, \u201cIt seems that some key disciples of Righteous Sect have infiltrated Yulin City, their number is still uncertain, but there is no figure of Zhan Qingchen among them.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not coming?\u201dShu Shi frowned slightly.This was not the same as the original plot.What he didn\u2019t know was that Zhan Qingchen would be in solitary confinement in the sect \u2026\u2026Wu Mang thought about it and said, \u201cDemon Empress issued a Black Killing Order and sent Western Saint, vowing to behead Zhan Qingchen, so maybe that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t dare to come.\u201d\u201cBlack Killing Order?!\u201dShu Shi got up, \u201cAre you sure the information is correct?\u201d\u201cThis subordinate is sure.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dShu Shi paced anxiously,\u00a0\u201cWhy is the Demon Empress suddenly hunting down Zhan Qingchen? Demon Sect\u2019s priority is not to go to war with Tianji Pavilion right now!\u201dWu Mang\u2019s eyes were puzzled.This was the first time he saw the Commander so confused.Moreover, the Commander seemed to be very concerned about Zhan Qingchen\u2019s matter?\u201cAs long as she does not leave Tianji Pavilion, even Western Saint cannot touch her, but this is not a long-term solution.\u201dShu Shi frowned thoughtfully,\u00a0\u201cI must find a way to make the Demon Empress revoke the Black Killing Order before they actually do.\u201d\u201cIt seems that when this is over, I will have to travel back to the sect!\u201dThe thought of that graceful and charming, yet cold-blooded and ruthless woman gave Shu Shi goosebumps.\u201cThat witch!\u201d\u201cWhen I go through the tribulation to prove my dao, I will make you kneel and sing a congratulatory song!\u201dAlthough that day was still far away, it did not stop Shu Shi. from practicing it in advance in his mind.\u201cHm~\u201d\u201cMaster, give me a hug~\u201dAt this point, Bai Qing hugged the blanket and mumbled sleepily in a daze.\u201cCough!\u201dShu Shi\u2019s face turned red.Wu Mang arched his hand and said, \u201cA moment of spring is worth a thousand gold pieces, so this subordinate will not disturb the Commander any further.\u201dHe said and instantly fell out of the window.His movements were extremely fast, not daring to stay even a second longer.Shu Shi rubbed his eyebrows.\u201cMy image, everything is ruined now!\u201d\u201cMaster~\u201d\u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming, so stop shouting!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 \u2013 Strong Shu Shi!Yulin City, Zuifeng Building.Several well-built men in black guarded the door, surveying the surroundings with sullen eyes.The surrounding pedestrians were silent, avoiding far away and not daring to come even half a step closer.Inside the hall.The Demon Commanders from each city took their seats in turn.At the highest place was a pitch-black wooden chair, on which a pale man sat upright.He was the Commander of Yulin City.Bloodthirsty Demon Wolf, Qiu Ao!Although he was also a city commander, no one could match Qiu Ao in terms of strength or status.Qiu Ao\u2019s voice was hoarse as he looked towards audiences, \u201cIs everyone here?\u201d\u201cJianshu City has arrived.\u201d\u201cTiger Peak City\u2019s commander has arrived.\u201d\u201cQianyang City has also arrived\u201d\u201cKaisei City is present..\u201dThe crowd responded.Qiu Ao swept his gaze around and frowned, \u201cWhere is Fengsha City? Why don\u2019t I see anyone coming?\u201dCao Jie, Commander of Qianyang City, jokingly said, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re busy with the funeral ceremony?\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201dThis remark drew laughter.\u201cThis is a valid point.\u201d\u201cThat Shu Shi is not talented, it would be better if he did not offend anyone, yet he foolishly provoked Zhan Qingchen instead?\u201d\u201cAfter all, Fengsha is the weakest, so it makes no difference if they come or not, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, they\u2019ll just get in the way of coming here.\u201dFengsha City was originally a small town on the frontier.Its overall strength was at the bottom of the eight cities in the Southwest Region.Moreover as their commander, Shu Shi\u2019s cultivation level was only at Late Stage Foundation Establishment, no one would take him seriously at all.Qiu Ao shook his head.He also did not have a good feeling about this commander who had risen to power with his background.\u201cThe goal of our operation is to expel the Righteous force from the Southwest Region completely, and we must unite every force.\u201d\u201cCommander of Fengsha City should be replaced by Shi Meng, right?\u201d\u201cIf I remember correctly, he is a Golden Elixir realm, so he can be of little help.\u201dJust then, a shout came from outside the door.\u201cCommander Fengsha City is here!\u201dQiu Ao\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cLooks like Shi Meng has come.\u201dA group of people walked in.The man at the head of the group was dressed as white as snow, with an erect figure and a handsome face that was lazily unrestrained.\u201cShu Shi?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not dead?\u201dEveryone fell silent.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m late.\u201dShu Shi walked to his seat and sat down himself.He didn\u2019t mean to come late, it was really because Bai Qing\u2019s little girl was too sticky, like an octopus that he couldn\u2019t get rid of \u2026\u2026\u201cHo, so brother Shu is still alive.\u201dCao Jie looked playful and said with a sneer, \u201cWith your strength, it is impossible for you to escape under Zhan Qingchen, probably because of this face, right?\u201d\u201cDid you become a gig*lo during the five days you were missing?\u201dA low, stifled laugh rang out from all around him.This man indeed had a fair face.Shu Shi had white skin, red lips and white teeth, and really had a nice body.Yet this was a great insult to the Demonic path, which worshipped strength.Shu Shi looked indifferent, as if he hadn\u2019t heard it.\u201cPresumptuous!\u201dWu Mang took a big step to Cao Jie\u2019s side and was about to slap him.\u201cHmph, who are you, how dare you move against me?\u201dCao Jie laughed coldly and casually greeted him with his hand.He did not put Wu Mang in his eyes at all.However, as soon as they made contact, Wu Mang\u2019s aura surged and his right arm grew thicker!Crack!He broke Cao Jie\u2019s arm!The arm was covered in blood, broken at a strange angle, and the white bone stumps poking through the muscles were so hideous!\u201cHow, how is it possible?\u201dCao Jie couldn\u2019t wait to cry out in pain, and his eyes were full of disbelief.\u201cLet go of Commander Cao!\u201dThe disciples of Qianyang City reacted, shouting and rushing towards Wu Mang.Bang!Wu Mang squeezed Cao Jie\u2019s head and pressed it violently on the table, his Golden Elixir Realm aura unleashed shamelessly.\u201cIf you want him to die, just try it!\u201dSeeing that fierce and cold gaze, the Qianyang City disciples averted their eyes and could only stand still for a moment.A dead silence enveloped the hall.This man was actually a Golden Elixir Realm practitioner?The crowd\u2019s expressions stiffened and their brows furrowed.This was completely out of their expectations.Originally, Cao Jie was also in the Golden Elixir Realm, so he would not be so vulnerable.But he had misjudged his opponent\u2019s strength and made a blunder.\u201cShu Shi, it is a serious crime for fellow disciples to kill each other, so many people are watching, you dare to touch me?\u201dCao Jie\u2019s voice was hoarse as he struggled to resist.Wu Mang\u2019s big hand grasped his death point, and the surging spiritual power firmly suppressed him, so that he could not use his cultivation power at all.Shu Shi was indifferent, his expression unchanged.He leaned back in his chair, as if he had nothing to do with any of this.At this moment, Qiu Ao, who have been silent, spoke, \u201cCao Jie, apologize to brother Shu.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dCao Jie was stunned, \u201cI apologize to him?\u201dQiu Ao\u2019s eyes were deep and his voice was cold, \u201cYou were the one who provoked him in the first place. Besides, with the big war coming, if we delay the main event, are you willing to take responsibility?\u201d\u201cI \u2026\u2026\u201dCao Jie\u2019s heart trembled.After hesitating for a moment, his face turned red as he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cShu, forgive me, I\u2019ve gone too far!\u201dShu Shi said indifferently, \u201cLet go of that man.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWu Mang released his hand and stood back behind Shu Shi in silence.Cao Jie used his spiritual power to seal his injured arm.His head was lowered, his eyes were red, and his teeth were about to fall out.The crowd looked at him with a slight chill in their hearts.Ruthless, powerful.Was this still the same Shi Shi who had no presence before?Qiu Ao looked at Shu Shi, his eyes darting around as he said, \u201cIf I\u2019m right, brother Shu should have already broken through the Golden Elixir Realm, right?\u201d\u201cGolden Elixir Realm?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

To break through the Golden Elixir Realm at such a young age, this talent is truly enviable.\u201dShu Shi smiled and did not deny it.The audiences\u2019 hearts soared upon hearing it!It seemed that this was true!The Golden Elixir Realm was not an unusual thing.But, a twenty-year-old child in the Realm of Golden Elixir, there was a lot of meaning behind it!Tianji Pavilion Chief Disciple Zhan Qingchen, a Super Grade Perfection talent, had been hailed as the number one genius of the Righteous path when she was exactly twenty years old when she broke through the Realm of Golden Elixir.So, what is this Shu Shi?The number one genius of the Demonic path?If he truly had such potential, they were worried that his future was boundless!The crowd\u2019s attitude now seemed different and began to think back to whether they had offended Shu Shi before.The commander sitting next to Cao Jie quietly moved his chair to sit further away, clearly wanting to clear his relationship with him.A moment ago the two called each other brother, but in the blink of an eye he avoided him like a snake and a scorpion.Cao Jie\u2019s face became increasingly ugly.\u201cThe sect has given us the mission to thoroughly cleanse the Southwest Region from Righteous forces so that we can lay a solid foundation for the next march into the Central Plains.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that the Righteous force is too scattered, so I\u2019m afraid that if we take the initiative, we\u2019ll scare the snakes away.\u201dQiu Ao looked at Shu Shi, \u201cCommander Shu, what do you think about this?\u201dFengsha City was originally the weakest.But now that there were suddenly two Golden Elixir Realm practitioners in addition, their strength surged upwards, and they were considered the main force in this operation.Shu Shi did not reply, but asked rhetorically, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Commander Qiu feel too silently here?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dQiu Ao was puzzled, \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201dShu Shi said, \u201cZuifeng Building is located in the most prosperous part of Yulin City, and there are no less than dozens of shops and vendors in the vicinity, but after all this time, can you hear the bustling sounds outside?\u201dQiu Ao frowned slightly and realized something, \u201cYou mean \u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the people around here have been cleaned up.\u201dQiu Ao\u2019s pupils shrank.\u201cSomeone!\u201dBang!The main door was kicked open.The guard outside the door flew to the side and fell to the ground panting.A group of men entered in single file.\u201cWho is coming?\u201d\u201cHow dare you, who let you in!\u201dSeveral commanders uttered angry rebukes.Qiu Ao couldn\u2019t help but inhale a cold breath when he saw who came.\u201cTian Yi?

Since when did the war stop?\u201dQiu Ao gritted his teeth and said, \u201cThis is in the city, do you want the people of Yulin City to be buried with you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not for you to worry about.\u201dChen Qingluan shook his head, \u201cIf you demon pricticioners don\u2019t die, the righteous people won\u2019t have peace forever!\u201dQiu Ao\u2019s face was very ugly.The other party had obviously made preparations, taking advantage of the fact that the Demonic force had not fully gathered, to take the lead in eliminating the commanders of the various cities!This was an extermination operation against the Demonic path in the Southwest Region!Shu Shi looked indifferent, having prepared himself for this scene.\u201cChen Qingluan?\u201dIt seemed that the plot had indeed changed, and instead of Tianji Pavilion being present, it had become the Demonic Extermination Division.Feeling noticed, Chen Qingluan raised her eyes to look.It was right in front of Shu Shi\u2019s calm eyes.She raised her eyebrows slightly, feeling a little unhappy in her heart, as if she had been completely seen through.Clang!Chen Qingluan\u2019s long sword clanged and her voice was clear, \u201cDemon Extermination Division, listen to my orders, follow me to kill these demons, don\u2019t let anyone live!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cZheng Yi follow me!\u201dQiu Ao slammed the table, and the solid solid wooden flower table turned to dust.\u201cI was looking for you, but you voluntarily appeared before us!

    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 \u2013 Heavenly Sword Draw Technique, Ye Xiao\u2019s Great Crisis!Ye Xiao mingled among the crowd.His parents had died when he was young and he was born with a shattered vein body.Not only did he suffer bullying from his sect members, he was also annulled from the marriage with his childhood sweetheart, so it could be said that he was the target of ridicule.It was reasonable to say that he would not be able to cultivate in his lifetime.However, there were countless strange encounters and opportunities that helped him to embark on the path of cultivation.No matter how dangerous the situation was, Ye Xiao was able to turn danger into safe one.No matter how powerful the enemy was, in the end, it only gave him experience.Not only did he join the Tianyi Sect, but he also successfully crossed all paths and became an inner disciple!Not long ago, he even broke through the Realm of Golden Elixir and stepped into the ranks of the top genius!Ye Xiao even vaguely felt that he was the real Favored Son of Heaven!One day, he would stand at the peak of the Nine Realms!Looking at the fierce battle in front of him, Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes were slightly excited.This time, he had taken the initiative to attack the Demon Sect, and as long as he could sweep the Demonic Sect in the Southwest Region, his status in Tianyi Sect would increase once again.He would become the strongest contender to become the Chief Disciple!Ye Xiao swept his gaze over the battlefield.According to the previous plan, Qiu Ao, the strongest, would be handled by Chen Qingluan, and they only needed to take care of a few other demon generals.At this moment, Ye Xiao noticed Shu Shi standing in the corner.\u201cIt seems that face is a bit familiar \u2026\u2026\u201dI feel like I\u2019ve seen this guy somewhere before.However he had attracted hatred so many times from people before that it was hard to remember exactly who this guy was for a while.\u201cWhatever, let\u2019s start with you!\u201dYe Xiao looked innocent and had a natural disgust towards handsome men.Moreover, this man was very young and had been hiding in a corner, so he thought that his strength shouldn\u2019t be good.\u201cDemon, die!\u201dYe Xiao raised the dark large ruler and lunged towards Shu Shi with a murderous aura.Shu Shi froze for a moment at the sight, \u201cBravo, are you happy to die under my sword?\u201d\u201cSky Cutter Flame Waves!\u201dYe Xiao roared, and the black ruler wrapped in blazing flames slashed out violently.Shu Shi shook his head, \u201cDo you think shouting the name of the technique will increase the damage?\u201dBang!The black ruler was set in front of Shu Shi.Ye Xiao froze.He saw that Shu Shi\u2019s palm bloomed with green light, and he actually held the black ruler firmly, unable to advance an inch no matter how hard he tried!That unstoppable killing move was actually received by this young man in front of him with his bare hands!Shu Shi\u2019s eyes sneered as a green lotus seemed to bloom in his palm.\u201cDie!\u201d\u201cEight Desolate Six Harmonious Palms!\u201d\u201cMis, mistycal ability?\u201dFeeling the terrifying aura, Ye Xiao\u2019s soul was scared to death as he released the Black Ruler and retreated to escape.\u201cShowing your back to your enemy? Indeed, you\u2019re an idiot!\u201dShu Shi\u2019s palm wind was like thunder, directly imprinting on his hind heart.Boom!The ring on Ye Xiao\u2019s right hand flashed with a faint light, and a light blue shield wrapped around it, blocking the palm for him.Seeing this, Ye Xiao breathed a sigh of relief and said with a satisfied expression, \u201cI almost forgot about this treasure.\u201d\u201cThis is my high-level spiritual treasure, the Heavenly Primodial Shield, which can withstand an attack even from a Nascent Soul Realm practitioner, it is impossible for someone in the Realm of Golden Elixir to penetrate it, so don\u2019t waste your efforts.\u201dShu Shi laughed coldly, \u201cIs that so? How about the six Golden Elixir Realm practitioners then?\u201dSeveral figures swept in, their auras moving and their moves hitting the shield unimpeded.Boom boom boom boom!In the midst of the flames, the Heavenly Primodial Shield made a creaking sound, shaking slightly.Ye Xiao froze.Only then did he realize that he seemed to have chosen the wrong opponent\u2026.Although this spiritual treasure could withstand the attack of a Nascent Soul Realm practitioner, its energy was limited, and if six Realm of Golden Elixir practitioners attacked simultaneously, its energy would be quickly depleted.Crack!!!There was a soft sound and cracks crawled all over the shield.Then, as Ye Xiao watched in horror, it crumbled into dust with a loud noise!Shu Shi did not move.He held the sword in his right hand, his eyes slightly closed, his breathing slow and long.Every time he breathed in, the spiritual energy in his body ran a little faster.The long sword shone with powerful spiritual energy, and the silvery sword light rose like a blazing sun.All the audience stopped moving, staring at the scene in awe.Chen Qingluan\u2019s sword brows sank slightly, her eyes slightly surprised.\u201cWhat kind of sword technique is this?\u201dThe moment the shield broke, Shu Shi\u2019s body pressed down and his right hand trembled slightly.In an instant, it was as if the entire world became darkness.Only the cold light on the sword blade remained.\u201cStop!\u201dA roar sounded as a middle-aged cultivator shot out from the sky.Shu Shi ignored him and his Green Frost Sword slashed at Ye Xiao boldly!\u201cSlash!\u201dHeavenly Sword Draw Technique!The sword light cut through the darkness as if cutting through the sky in one fell swoop!Ye Xiao did not even have time to react before the sword light was already in front of him and would cut him in half in the next second!\u201cHow dare you!\u201dThe middle-aged cultivator threw his duster, and the air instantly turned stagnant.The sword blade stopped in front of Ye Xiao, sword qi cut his cheek and blood dripped all over his face, yet no matter how hard he tried, Shu Shi could not advance his sword slash.\u201cTsk, when there is only one step left.\u201dShu Shi had an unhappy face.The middle-aged cultivator fell from the air with a murderous look in his eyes, \u201cKid, how dare you move against my sect\u2019s genius, do you want to die?\u201dThe duster in his hand bloomed with a mist of light, emitting a terrifying aura.\u201cA Nascent Soul, Nascent Soul Realm practitioner?\u201dThe Demonic Sect crowd had desperate expressions on their faces.This siege, there was actually a Nascent Soul Realm cultivator who came personally?F*ck! Now what should we do!Shu Shi\u2019s face didn\u2019t change as he said in a loud voice, \u201cSenior Shenxiu, how much longer do you have to wait?\u201dIn the corner.The shadow blurred for a moment.A sharp-looking man with a curious face revealed himself and stared at Shu Shi.\u201cKid, how did you know I was here?\u201d1. The large black ruler is the weapon always carried by Xiao Yan from BTTH, yup Ye Xiao is an imitation of that character.2. If you look at the cultivation levels that have been revealed so far, it seems to follow the mainstream cultivation level settings such as\u00a0Xian Ni\u00a0and\u00a0Rebirth The Urban Immortal Cultivation.3. Here is the duster, I don\u2019t know how this is called in english:3. \u53c2\u5bbf [sh\u0113n xi\u00f9] / Betelgeuse in English is one of the constellations. It is likely that he is one of the Demon Empress\u2019s direct subordinates.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 \u2013 One of Constellations, Shenxiu! Ye Xiao, die for me!Seeing this sharp-tongued man, the Demon Sect members present froze for a moment, then knelt on one knee in unison.\u201cGreetings to Lord Shenxiu!\u201d\u201cShenxiu?\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s expression froze.This demon really came!Under the Netherworld Demon Emperor were four Saints, who were in charge of twenty-eight constellations and were the backbone of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect.If one were to guess correctly, this person should be the leader of the Southwest Region.Western Vermilion Sky, Constellation, Shenxiu!After the middle-aged cultivator saw him, his expression also became serious.However, Shenxiu ignored the crowd and looked at Shu Shi, who was standing aside, curiously said, \u201cKid, how did you know I was here?\u201d\u201cI just guessed.\u201dShu Shi shrugged, \u201cThe Southwest Region has always been under our sect\u2019s control and can be described as impregnable, with Yulin City being the most important.\u201d\u201cHow is it possible that the Righteous force could sneak in silently, and even set up a formation in advance?\u201d\u201cEven I have sensed that something is wrong, how could Lord Constellation not know?\u201d\u201cThe reason for the delay in your appearance is that you should want to take the opportunity to annihilate them.\u201dThe praying mantis caught the cicadas, but the bird stayed behind.In the end, they, the commander group, were just bait.The Demon Sect crowd was all confused.They had gathered here to annihilate the righteous force, but they were instead surrounded by them.And now they were being told that it was actually the righteous force that had fallen into the trap?\u201cClever.\u201dShenxiu laughed and clapped his hands, \u201cI didn\u2019t think there were smart people like you among the demon generals. Then, why did you enter this game if you saw all that?\u201dOnce a battle ensues, the risks are uncontrollable, and casualties are even more inevitable.Who would be willing to risk their lives when they only had one?If there was even the slightest sign of flaw, these righteous people wouldn\u2019t take the bait.Shu Shi said indifferently, \u201cAs a commander, one must be ready to sacrifice for the sect at any time. Since Lord Shenxiu wants to play games, what harm is it for me to be a pawn?\u201dIn short, he actually just wants to get Ye Xiao killed \u2026\u2026Shenxiu nodded with satisfaction, \u201cIt\u2019s rare to find someone as loyal as you.\u201d\u201cShenxiu!\u201dAt that moment, an angry rebuke interrupted the conversation between the two.He only saw the middle-aged cultivator glaring angrily, clearly annoyed at feeling ignored.\u201cHow dare you, demon, show yourself? Good, I\u2019ll eliminate you at once and return the Southwest Region to bright and clear skies!\u201dShenxiu glanced at him and said disdainfully, \u201cWhen I speak, I hate it when people interrupt!\u201dHe stepped forward and his thin body swelled rapidly, his hair growing wildly on his body, turning into a giant ape nearly ten meters tall!His muscles bulged and his qi and blood were like that of a dragon!A terrifying aura that made people tremble in fear!The faces of the righteous force crowd turned white, this was a true beast in human form!\u201cPiece of shit from Tianyi, die!\u201dShenxiu threw his fist, and a strong whistling wind overturned the roof!The middle-aged cultivator didn\u2019t flinch, his fly whisk glowing with light and his hands cupped in a spiritual knot to meet it.Boom!The two fought in a clash, spiritual energy roaring and exploding out!The entire Yulin City shook!The crowd stood frozen in place.No one had expected this siege to bring in two Nascent Soul Realm practitioners!A battle at this level was not something they could interfere with.Qiu Ao was the first to react and said in a loud voice, \u201cCommanders listen to my orders, kill all these righteous people, don\u2019t let a single one live!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThe people of the Demon Sect roared and rushed forward.The appearance of a constellation had boosted their morale, and although they were outnumbered, they actually had the upper hand for a while.Looking at the chaotic scene, Ye Xiao swallowed his saliva and quietly moved his feet.This was completely beyond his prediction.The bad premonition in his heart was getting stronger and stronger.His instincts told him that this was not a place to stay for long!Just then, a cold and stern voice rang in his ears.\u201cAdvance, kill Ye Xiao!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWu Mang and the five Shadows made their movements in unison, and Shu Shi\u2019s hands clinked with green ice as the attention-grabbing sword Qi slid out!Without wasting any time and bullshit, the goal was to kill him!\u201cHelp, help!\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s heart and guts trembled as he ran with all his might in a panic, while crying out.Although he was stronger than an ordinary Golden Elixir practitioner, he could not withstand seven Golden Elixir cultivators attacking him simultaneously.What\u2019s more, the man in white was so extraordinarily strong that he was simply no match for him!\u201cI can\u2019t die!\u201d\u201cI am the Favored Son of Heaven, an existence that will stand at the peak of the Nine Realms, how can I die here?!\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s eyes were red, and his expression was filled with unwillingness.At this moment, he noticed Chen Qingluan who was busy fighting on the side, as if he had grabbed the straw would save his life:\u201cFairy Chen, save me!\u201dYe Xiao ducked behind her in an instant.Seeing his cowering appearance, Chen Qingluan\u2019s sword brows frowned slightly, and a hint of disgust swept across the bottom of her eyes.I thought this Ye Xiao had courage, but I didn\u2019t expect him to be so cowardly!Hmph, why would Tianyi Sect send trash like him?Although she hated it in her heart, she could not sit back and do nothing, because after all, he was a fellow righteous path.Chen Qingluan crossed her swords and blocked in front of Su Shi.\u201cStop, you demon \u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi did not dodge, directly slashing his sword, \u201cOld bitch! Don\u2019t get in my way!\u201dThis was a great opportunity to kill the Son of Heaven\u2019s Destiny!\u201cBitch, old bitch?\u201dChen Qing Luan was silent for a moment hearing the humiliation, and then her eyes flashed with a blazing flame.\u201cI leave Qiu Ao to you, I will deal with this demon!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe people of the Demon Extermination Division surrounded Qiu Ao in a group.Looking at the woman in green in front of him, Shu Shi\u2019s eyes turned icy, \u201cDare to stop me? Then, I\u2019ll kill you together!\u201dKilling two main characters in a row, the rewards should be very bountiful, right?Although there was still a lot of drama to follow for this Chen Qingluan, he could not care too much at the moment.No matter what, Ye Xiao had to die here!\u201cHeavenly Sword Draw Technique!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 \u2013 Cheng Qingluan\u2019s humiliating, total defeat of Righteous force!\u201cDon\u2019t mind me, go kill Ye Xiao!\u201dShu Shi shouted sternly, slashing his sword towards Chen Qingluan!Chen Qingluan\u2019s eyes were extremely cold as her Autumn Water Longsword met his head-on!Boom!Green Frost and Autumn Water collided, sword Qi whistled and cold light erupted!The two figures, one white and one green, were like lightning, and their sword qi was like a biting cold wind, making it impossible for people to approach even half a step closer.Qiu Ao\u2019s pupils contracted slightly.He knew that Shu Shi was a Golden Elixir practitioner, but he did not expect his strength to be so strong!Afterall, his opponent was a Demon Exterminator Chen Qingluan!Even Qiu Ao who was at the Late Stage of Golden Elixir Realm alone was suppressed by this woman to death, yet right now Shu Shi could match her equally!Shu Shi frowned slightly.This woman was truly difficult to deal with!Chen Qingluan was born with sword intent down to the bone, and her control of the sword dao was already very good. Although the Heavenly Sword Draw Technique was powerful, it could not be used continuously in haste.It was not easy to determine the winner in a short period of time.On the other hand Ye Xiao escaped with all his might, going into the crowd like a small fish, and although he was beaten by Wu Mang and the others, his life was not in danger for a while.\u201cHow dare you call me an old bitch!\u201dAt this moment, Chen Qingluan didn\u2019t care whether Ye Xiao lived or died, and only had Shu Shi in her eyes.Her chest rose and fell, hee anger level drawn to the full, one sword faster than the other, one sword crueler than the other!Shu Shi said indifferently, \u201cYou tigress, you\u2019re not done yet?\u201d\u201cTigress?\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s eyes spewed flames, and he instantly slashed even harder.Shu Shi retreated, and with a green frost clanging in his hand, he threw it directly at her as a javelin.\u201cThrowing away your own weapon? Fool!\u201dChen Qingluan dodged to the side and was just about to counterattack when she suddenly felt a strange sensation coming from her chest.The air was instantly silent.Her body stiffened and she slowly looked down.Only to see Shu Shih\u2019s palm pressing against her without resistance.Chen Qingluan\u2019s face quickly turned red, her eyes couldn\u2019t believe it, her voice trembled, \u201cNasty, nasty bastard, how dare you act indecently towards me!\u201d\u201cSorry, but you\u2019re overthinking it.\u201dShu Shi\u2019s palm exploded with green light.Eight Desolate Six Harmonious Palms!Boom!An extremely powerful spiritual force instantly erupted, and Chen Qingluan\u2019s blood spurted wildly as she was instantly sent flying.Like a green meteor, it was hitting a home.Her breath was gone, her life and death unknown.\u201cCensor\u00a0Chen!\u201dThe people from the Demon Extermination Division were in a great hurry.They wanted to come to support Chen Qingluan, but how could Qiu Ao let them go?Qiu Ao drew a dividing line, kept the crowd in place and said in a loud voice, \u201cCommander Shu, you go about your business, leave this side to me!\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dShu Shi\u2019s finger twitched slightly and the Green Frost Sword flew back into his palm.Without caring about Chen Qingluan, he turned his gaze towards Ye Xiao, his dense killing aura undisguised!\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201dWhen Ye Xiao realized this scene, his heart and guts split and both his legs became weak for a while.\u201cI have no grudge with you, why do you keep obsessively chasing me!!!\u201dHe was confused in his heart.It was as if this man had a blood feud with him!Shu Shi didn\u2019t bother to explain, he just did.It was undeniable that this thing called heaven\u2019s luck did exist.Just like Ye Xiao, even if he stepped in dog shit on the street, he could still find some really good medicine in that dog shit.But then what?\u201cYou are the Son of Destiny, taking all the fortune of heaven, but you are cowardly, timid, and stupid.\u201d\u201cDo you think I should just stand by obediently waiting for you to kill me?\u201cYou\u2019re the one who first made the move to kill me, in my eyes it\u2019s already unforgivable!\u201d\u201cDie!\u201dSword Qi crossed heaven and earth!Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes were filled with despair.\u201cStop!\u201dThe middle-aged cultivator noticed this scene and instantly his eyes widened in anger as he raised his hand and threw the fly whisk.But he was still a step too slow.The ruthless sword qi pierced through Ye Xiao\u2019s chest like a bolt of lightning.Shu Shi still wanted to slash out a second sword.But the fly whisk had already flown in, and a blinding light separated the two.\u201cDon\u2019t get distracted while you fight.\u201dShenxiu slammed his fist into the middle-aged cultivator\u2019s chest.\u201c Buhoo !\u201dThe cultivator spurted blood, his chest was dented and he fell down like a kite with a broken string.In mid-air, he forcibly endured severe pain, his blood burned like a flame, and instantly appeared behind Ye Xiao.\u201cRun!\u201dPulling the unconscious Ye Xiao, his body disappeared like a bubble.\u201cWant to run?\u201dShenxiu condensed the stone spear in his hand and threw it forcefully, a muffled groan came from the void.After leaving behind a large pool of blood, the two figures completely disappeared.As the Righteous path disciples watched, they couldn\u2019t help but freeze in place.\u201cThat Nascent Soul cultivator\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEscaped?\u201dThe crowd looked distraught.They had just been abandoned?What happened to the promise to live and die together, to share hardships?Qiu Ao\u2019s smile was fierce as he said in a firm voice, \u201cFellow commanders, follow me to eliminate those righteous people!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThe people in the Demon Sect looked excited.Chen Qingluan had fallen, Ye Xiao\u2019s life and death was unknown, and the Soul Nascent great power had fled.Righteous force had completely lost the ability to resist.What followed was a completely one-sided massacre.Shu Shi had no interest in the others and stood silently, waiting for the system\u2019s notification.About a stick of incense later, a beep sounded.[The storyline has changed.][The host defeated Chen Qingluan, influencing the next plot trend and gaining 10 plot points.][The host helped kill Lin Quan, a monk from Tianyi Sect, affecting the next plot trend and earning 10 plot points.][The host has severely injured Ye Xiao, affecting the subsequent plot, earning 40 plot points.[Please continue your good job.]\u201cHeavy damage?\u201dShu Shi\u2019s eyes sank slightly, \u201cTsk, it\u2019s true that he didn\u2019t die.\u201dHis sword had hit right on the chest, and it was probably Lin Quan who had saved Ye Xiao\u2019s life before he died.This was also in line with his expectations.If he is really easy to kill, he will not be called the protagonist.Even if it is well prepared, it will only inflict heavy damage on the other party.But it made him certain of one thing.The so-called Son of Heaven\u2019s Destiny was not immortal!\u201cYou won\u2019t be so lucky next time.\u201dThe corner of Shu Shi\u2019s mouth curved up slightly.Ye Xiao was still alive, the next plot was still predictable, and he still had more room to play.\u201cSixty plot points?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a big jackpot.\u201d1. Censor, in traditional East Asia, governmental official charged primarily with the responsibility for scrutinizing and criticizing the conduct of officials and rulers.2. As alluded to in the first chapter, burning blood is equivalent to spending your remaining life-span in exchange for a drastic increase in strength in a short period of time.

    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 \u2013 Shenxiu Shows Goodwill and Take Chen Qingluan Home!\u201cAs expected of a Favored Son of Heaven, it actually grants me forty plot points!\u201dShu Shi was extremely satisfied.It was not in vain that he had prepared well.\u201cIf I beat Ye Xiao to a pulp every time from here on out, won\u2019t I be able to rack up unlimited plot points?\u201d\u201cAnd he can also act as a treasure hunting rat for me.\u201d\u201cAfter all, some opportunities still have to be opened by him.\u201dShu Shi cupped his chin and poked darkly at the good idea.For Ye Xiao, he didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit of guilt.It didn\u2019t matter if he killed him.After all, Ye Xiao was the one who first made the move to kill him.If Shu Shi didn\u2019t have the strength he currently had, would Ye Xiao have let him go?The two were opposites by nature, and there was no room for reconciliation.\u201cYour opportunity, is my opportunity, your treasure, is my treasure, your woman \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry, you don\u2019t have a woman.\u201dThe corner of Shu Shi\u2019s mouth smiled coldly.The battle was almost over at this point.Righteous force has no leader and Demonic force has the upper hand, almost destroying it unilaterally, Righteous force has no ability to resist.Shenxiu fell from the air, his figure already back to normal.His clothes had exploded during his transformation, and his body was as thin as a rib, with no sign of the extraordinary and powerful appearance he had just had.\u201cKid, you did a great job.\u201dShenxiu looked at Shu Shi approvingly, \u201cYou have a brilliant idea.\u201dThat middle-aged cultivator, Lin Quan, wasn\u2019t as strong as him, but he was a solid Nascent Soul practitioner after all.If they really wanted to drag things out, it would be normal to fight for several hours.Shu Shi, however, had captured Lin Quan\u2019s lifeline.That was Ye Xiao.Lin Quan was obviously Ye Xiao\u2019s protector and was distracted by Shu Shi\u2019s sword, which allowed Shenxui to take the opening.But what he didn\u2019t know is that Shu Shi didn\u2019t care about Lin Quan at all \u2026\u2026\u201c That cultivatior forcibly burned his blood and ended up getting hit by one of my blows, so he will definitely die!\u201dShenxiu\u2019s eyes were very excited.Today\u2019s operation could be considered a great success.Not only had he destroyed the Righteous force, he had also gotten a powerhouse in the Nascent Soul Realm, killed, completely consolidating the Demonic Sect\u2019s grip on the Southwest Region.This was no small feat!And all of this is inseparable from Shu Shi.Shenxiu said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll explain your credit to the sect.\u201dShu Shi shook his head, \u201cThe main thing is that Lord Constellation planned carefully, it has nothing to do with this subordinate.\u201dShenxiu smiled and said, \u201cEven if the plan was well thought out, didn\u2019t you see through it as well?\u201dShu Shi scratched his head, \u201cThis is \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, don\u2019t be modest, it\u2019s only proper that I reward you for your service, and I won\u2019t take advantage of a small commander like you.\u201dShenxiu was satisfied with Shu Shi.He was intelligent, capable and most importantly, loyal.Such talents could not be found very often.Moreover, with the talent Shu Shi had shown, it was definitely impossible for him to stop at only the Golden Elixir Realm in the future, so showing goodwill now would be a kind of investment.Seeing Shenxui\u2019s friendly appearance, the other city commanders\u2019 eyes fluttered.That was a Constellation, an existence in charge of a continent. If they could make good relations with such a big man, they would be able to walk arrogantly all over the Southwest Region!\u201cShu Shi\u2019s strength is too strong, he can completely destroy Chen Qing Luan!\u201d\u201cYes, sword cultivators are recognized as strong in battle, and he can compete a top genius like Chen Qingluan!\u201d\u201cI just wonder \u2026\u2026 Why are there so many Golden Elixir Realm practitioners in Fengsha City?\u201d\u201cThere are seven including Shu Shi, that\u2019s too many!\u201dAfter this battle, people were well aware of one thing.Fengsha City, had risen!Cao Jie, the commander of Qianyang, was deathly pale.Before the big battle, he had just broken his arm and could only exert fifty percent of his strength, almost dying in the melee.But none of this mattered \u2026\u2026\u201cWhy should I offend Shu Shi ah!\u201dCao Jie wanted to cry.Revenge?Stop it, all he hopes now is that Shu Shi does not hold a grudge on him\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Shu Shi stood by the ruins and looked at the unconscious woman in green.Chen Qingluan.One of the main characters.The youngest imperial official of the Demon Extermination Division and considered a once-in-a-thousand-year genius of the dao of the sword.In addition, she has an important identity.Zhan Qingchen\u2019s best friend!\u201cJust now, my attention was on Ye Xiao, so I didn\u2019t think much of it, before I realized it I beat her up like this.\u201dShu Shi rubbed his eyebrows, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit troublesome now.\u201dShenxiu changed his clothes and walked over to him, \u201cWhy, are you excited?\u201dShu Shi froze, \u201cHuh?\u201dShenxiu smiled and said, \u201cA young man is full of passion, I can understand that. Besides, this woman is very beautiful\u2026\u201dAfter saying that, he looked around and lowered his voice, \u201cTake this woman away, I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t see her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi didn\u2019t say much either, and directly carried Chen Qingluan.\u201cMany thanks to Lord Constellation.\u201dThis is a ready-made plot point!Shenxiu waved his hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t thank me, I don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d\u201cI understand, then this subordinate will leave first.\u201dShu Shi carried Chen Qingluan until he ran.Looking at his back, Shenxiu nodded his head and sighed, \u201c It\u2019s good to be young.\u201dAt this moment, Qiu Ao walked over and said in confusion, \u201cLord Shenxiu, why did Commander Shu take that woman away? She is an imperial official of the Demon Extermination Division, she should be escorted back to the sect \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat woman?\u201dShenxiu frowned and said, \u201cI don\u2019t see that woman you\u2019re referring to, did you see her?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dQiu Ao swallowed and carefully said, \u201cThen \u2026\u2026 I didn\u2019t see her either?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 \u2013 Why Don\u2019t You Just Tie Me Up If You Really Can\u2019t Help It\u2026!At the inn.Bai Qing opened her eyes in a daze.\u201cHmm? Where did my master go?\u201dHer face took on a puzzled look.This place was far from the scene of the melee, and Shu Shi had placed an isolation barrier before he left, and gave Bai Qing another tranquilizer pill.Thus, she had slept soundly until now and had no idea what had happened in the city.\u201cI remember that when I woke up in the morning, it seemed like I slept in my master\u2019s arms?\u201dBai Qing recalled the scene.She herself was not dressed, hanging on to Shu Shi like an octopus, and she was acting like a spoiled child to prevent him from leaving\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s all over, now what should I do!\u201d\u201cAlthough it is my master, but it\u2019s too embarrassing!\u201d\u201cHuuuuu! I don\u2019t have the face to meet him~~!\u201dBai Qing covered her hot little face, hoping that she could find a crack in the ground to dig and hide.At that moment, the door to the room was suddenly pushed open.Bai Qing hurriedly hid under the quilt, like an ostrich, not daring to look up.Shu Shi\u2019s voice sounded, \u201cDon\u2019t pretend, I know you\u2019re not sleeping.\u201d\u201cPeople have also just woken up\u2026\u201dBai Qing poked her head out shyly.The next moment, her entire body froze.He only saw Shu Shi, exhausted and messily dressed, with an unconscious woman in green on his shoulder.\u201cMaster, what are you\u2026?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, give some space so that I can put her down.\u201dBai Qing stood up in confusion.Shu Shi threw Chen Qingluan onto the bed, then took out a thick rope from nowhere and tied her into a large dumpling in three movements.\u201cPerfect.\u201dShu Shi clapped his hands in satisfaction.Bai Qing\u2019s eyes froze.Only to see the woman in green with her hands tied behind her back, her already delicate figure tied and shaped in a very strange way\u2026.Bai Qing\u2019s voice twitched, \u201cMaster, what are you doing?\u201dShu Shi shook his head, \u201cThis woman is too fierce, when she wakes up I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to restrain her, so I have to tie her up first.\u201dBai Qing whispered, \u201cSo you have a hobby like this?\u201dShu Shi was stunned, \u201cHuh?\u201dBai Qing\u2019s fingers tangled and hesitated for a moment before gathering enough courage to say, \u201cMaster, kidnapping a civilian girl is wrong, why don\u2019t just tie me up if you really can\u2019t help it\u2026?\u201dDang!Shu Shi raised his hand and knocked her head, and said without any good grace, \u201cWhat are you thinking? This is the Imperial Censor Demon Extermination Division, the enemy I caught!\u201d\u201cEnemy?\u201dBai Qing rubbed her forehead and muttered, \u201cBut isn\u2019t this enemy too beautiful?\u201dChen Qingluan had delicate skin and even flesh and blood, and even with her eyes closed, she could still feel the valiant heroic aura between her eyebrows and eyes.Her brows were slightly furrowed and her face was pale, like a violet flower that made him feel sorry for her.Shu Shi frowned.Although the two stand opposite each other, she was Zhan Qingchen\u2019s best friend after all, and with all the commotion in Yulin City, it was likely that the world would find out soon.If he kills her, Zhan Qingchen will definitely be sad.But if not \u2026\u2026Thinking of Chen Qingluan\u2019s murderous appearance, Shu Shi had a headache.\u201cForget it, let\u2019s put her here for a while, and wait for her to recover.\u201dShu Shi looked at Bai Qing, \u201cI will trouble you to take care of her first during this period.\u201dHe had tied her up, Chen Qingluan was seriously injured and would not be able to break free, so she would not threaten Bai Qing\u2019s safety.\u201cOkay.\u201dBai Qing nodded.A quiet sigh of relief came out from his heart.\u201cI\u2019m glad she doesn\u2019t have that kind of relationship with my master \u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026A great war broke out in the city, and although it didn\u2019t reach here, the guests had fled.Shu Shi opened the room next door and asked the maid to boil a bucket of hot water and bring it here.Soaking comfortably in the bathtub, Shu Shi let out a comfortable sigh.After all, he had gone through a ferocious battle, and although he did not break any bones, his spirit was somewhat exhausted.\u201cOpen the system panel.\u201d[Host: Shu Shi][Status: Full of Qi and blood, slightly exhausted][Talent: Holy Talent Perfect][Realm: Early Stage of Golden Elixir Realm][Cultivation Method: The Breathing Technique of Netherworld (Great Success), Netherworld Divine Cultivation (Small Success)][Plot Value: 61 points]\u201cSixty-one points.\u201dThe corners of Shu Shi\u2019s mouth curled upwards, \u201cThis time I was completely freed from poverty and became rich!\u201dDefeating Chen Qingluan gave 10 points, helping Shenxiu kill Lin Quan gave 10 points, and seriously injuring Ye Xiao gave a full 40 points!With more plot value, how to spend it became a problem.According to experience from previous times, continuing to open blind boxes should be the most cost-effective.But the problem was, he might not be lucky every time.And the randomness of the blind box was so strong that it was likely to attract something she didn\u2019t need.Shu Shih thought about it carefully.He decided to take 10 points to open the blind box first, and save the rest of the plot value for now.Soon, he would have to return to the sect, and he might face the Netherworld Demon Empress then, so he had to save some plot value for emergencies.Open the prize pool.The prize boxes flickered with light.Shu Shi grabbed one with his hand.[Talent: Super Perfect (with Essence Cleansing)]\u201cAnother talent?\u201dShu Shi frowned.He himself was already a Holy Perfect Talent, and this gift was completely useless to him.Shu Shi pondered for a moment and asked, \u201cSystem, can this reward be given to someone else?\u201dThe system gave an answer.[Yes, but it can only be used if the other party does not resist].\u201cOf course she won\u2019t refuse.\u201dShu Shi revealed a smile.He was already thinking about who this gift would be given to.Just then, an angry roar suddenly came from next door.\u201cLustful bastard, I will kill you!\u201dShu Shi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 \u2013 Broken Chen Qingluan!Chen Qingluan\u2019s sword brows were knitted together.She had just woken up from her coma and found herself tightly bound with ropes and lying on a sofa covered with red mandarin duck mattress sheets.Even as calm as she was, she was a little confused for a moment.Upon closer inspection, she found that her clothes were still intact and she let out a long sigh of relief.Chen Qingluan exerted her remaining strength and tried to break free from the ropes.\u201cHiss!\u201dA sharp pain came from her chest, and the last of her strength disappeared.\u201cMy breastbone should be broken.\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s face was as pale as paper.The power of the palm strike was too strong, and although she had forged her body with sword intent for many years and her body was much stronger than those cultivators of the same realm, she was still seriously injured by the strike.Recalling the scene in the melee, Chen Qingluan looked solemn.\u201cLooking at today\u2019s situation, this siege is likely to fail.\u201d\u201cEven the guests of the Tianyi Sect are no match for the Constellation of Demonic Sect?\u201d\u201cAnd that guy \u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi\u2019s face flashed before her eyes.A biting sword aura, cold eyes, and a huge hand pressing down on her.\u201cDamn it!\u201dChen Qingluan clenched her silver teeth.She had never been humiliated like this before!However, what she could not accept the most was that she had lost in the sword arts!\u201cI was overcome with anger back then, if I had calmed down and dealt with it calmly, I might not have had a chance to win.\u201dChen Qingluan began to reflect on herself.One had to admit that the man was indeed very powerful.Whether it was cultivation, mystical ability, or fighting talent, everything had reached an almost perfect level.Especially that terrifying sword technique.Even though she grew up in the sword pool since she was a child, she never felt such pure sword intent.\u201cFor someone of that caliber in the Realm of Golden Elixir, there aren\u2019t many people like him.\u201d\u201cHow come I\u2019ve never heard of such a genius in the Southwest Region before?\u201dChen Qingluan silently pondered, \u201cQiu Ao seems to have called him \u2026\u2026 Commander Shu?\u201dRight at this moment, Bai Qing carried the dinner plate and pushed the door in.\u201cHuh? You are awake?\u201dShe put the dinner plate on the table, took out a bowl of white porridge and said with a smile, \u201cYou have been unconscious for a long time, you must be hungry, right? It\u2019s not convenient for you to eat like this, so it\u2019s better for me to feed you.\u201dChen Qingluan snorted coldly, \u201cGirl from Demonic Sect, don\u2019t get close to me!\u201dBai Qing shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m not a girl from the Demonic Sect, I\u2019m just my master\u2019s maid.\u201d\u201cMaid?\u201dChen Qingluan looked carefully.She only saw that the other party had weak legs and unfocused eyes, and was really an ordinary person without cultivation.\u201cCould it be that I was saved by someone?\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s tone eased a few points, \u201cSorry, may I ask who your master is?\u201dBai Qing smiled and said, \u201cMy master\u2019s family name is Shu.\u201dChen Qingluan froze and asked hesitantly, \u201cIt\u2019s not Shu, the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect Commander, is it?\u201dBai Qing nodded her head vigorously, \u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s my master\u2019s family name.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean that I did fall into the hands of the demonic sect?\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s chest rose and fell as she breathed heavily.She herself had actually been kidnapped by that man!Thinking of the humiliation she had suffered earlier, and then seeing the way she was tied up now, Chen Qingluan could not help the anger that rose from her heart.\u201cThat lustful bastard! I will kill you!\u201d\u2026\u2026Bang!Shu Shi pushed open the room door and walked in.\u201cWho are you calling a lustful bastard? Who are you going to kill?\u201dHe had an exasperated look on his face.He had just soaked in the bathtub and ran over when he heard the commotion, not even having time to put on his clothes.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s you!\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s eyes spewed fire as she struggled to get up.However, the rope seemed to have spiritual properties, the more she struggled, the tighter she was bound, and finally she couldn\u2019t move at all.Shu Shi hugged her shoulders, \u201cYou should feel lucky, if not for me, you would have fallen into the hands of the Netherworld Sect.\u201d\u201cHow they will deal with you, you know better than anyone.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t pretend to be kind here, all of you demons are one and the same!\u201dChen Qingluan snorted coldly, \u201cIf you really wanted to save me, why did you tie me up like this?\u201dShu Shi snorted, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid? If I hadn\u2019t tied you up, you would have cut me with your sword!\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s tone was stagnant and she was speechless.\u201cHumph, bastard!\u201dShu Shi frowned, \u201cCursing when you can\u2019t say no?\u201d\u201cSo what if I cut you? You depraved bastard!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cRotten bastard!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing her cursing more and more loudly, Shu Shi walked to the bed with a black face, reaching out to take off his shoes and take off his socks.There was a hint of panic in Chen Qingluan\u2019s eyes.\u201cYou, what are you doing \u2026\u2026 Ah!\u201dShu Shi stuffed the socks directly into her mouth and clapped his hands with satisfaction, \u201cNow you\u2019re finally quiet.\u201d\u201cMmmmmmmmmmmmm!\u201dThe look in Chen Qingluan\u2019s eyes wanted to bite him.Bai Qing on the side whispered, \u201cMaster, but then she won\u2019t be able to eat.\u201dShu Shi said, \u201cNo problem, she is a cultivator, she can endure hunger for ten days and half a month.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dBai Qing said nothing more and walked out with her lunchbox in her hand.Shu Shi sat on his chair, yawning lazily.After a while.Chen Qingluan finally stopped making noise and lay down on the bed as if she had resigned herself to her fate.Shu Shi saw this and frowned slightly.Could it be that the rope was tied too tightly?Chen Qingluan\u2019s injury is serious, and if it keeps going like this, there might be a problem.He walked to the bedside and asked, \u201cIf you are willing to calm down, you can blink your eyes.\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s eyes blinked for a moment.Shu Shi took out her smelly socks.Chen Qingluan breathed heavily, her voice a little sharp, \u201cMy sternum is broken, the rope is tied too tightly, this will pierce my heart.\u201dShu Shi sent his spiritual energy into her body and discovered that she was indeed not lying.The sternum was broken in two places, and a slight deflection would puncture the internal organs.\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll loosen the rope for you, so don\u2019t make any crooked ideas.\u201dChen Qingluan nodded, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I still have a heart even though I have no strength right now\u2026\u201dAs a result, as soon as Su Shi let go of the rope, she suddenly lunged with a jerk.Shu Shi was prepared for this and held her firmly with one hand and said with a smile, \u201cI know you have a heart\u2026.\u201dIn the midst of his words, he suddenly felt that something was wrong.What he had pressed seemed to \u2026\u2026Looking down, the air was instantly silent.Chen Qingluan\u2019s body trembled slightly, his eyes seemed to be misty, and his voice was tinged with a slight cry.\u201cYou, are you still denying that you are not a lustful bastard?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe corner of Shu Shi\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cWould you believe me if I said it was a misunderstanding?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 \u2013 Chen Qingluan\u2019s Big Decision!A familiar location, a familiar feeling.Shu Shi looked at his right hand, and then at Chen Qingluan\u2019s watery appearance.\u201cThis is a misunderstanding \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIn that case, why don\u2019t you hurry up and take your hand off!!? \u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s face was pale and there was a slight redness at the tips of her ears.She was so badly injured that she had used up almost all her strength in her movements just now, and now there was a tingling pain coming from her chest, and even her breathing had become a little difficult.She couldn\u2019t help but feel scared.She had lost all her spiritual power and was like a fish on a cutting board. If Shu Shi really wanted to do something indecent, she wouldn\u2019t be able to resist at all.Chen Qingluan was not afraid of death.But, how could she maintain her chastity if she didn\u2019t even have the ability to kill herself?\u201cCough.\u201dShu Shi slowly removed his hand and said awkwardly, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it, it was my right hand moving on its own.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing that she made no further movement, Chen Qingluan\u2019s hanging heart dropped slightly.She curled up in a corner, biting her lip and lowering her head in silence, different from her angry expression just now, surprisingly, she had a kind of pitiful feeling.Shu Shi scratched his head.The other party was suddenly so calm, he was still somewhat unaccustomed to it.\u201cIf I want to do something to you, I will do it while you are unconscious, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201dShu Shi explained.Chen Qingluan whispered, \u201cBut I\u2019ve heard that there are several types of depraved kidnappers, some of which are \u2026\u2026 the more the woman resists the more excited they get in return \u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi didn\u2019t know whether to cry or laugh at her words.What is all this nonsense.No wonder she was so quiet, so it was because she was afraid he would do something nasty to her?\u201cOtherwise, why didn\u2019t you kill me?\u201dChen Qingluan did not understand.Judging from his performance in the big battle, Shu Shi was not a kind-hearted person at all, and if she hadn\u2019t forged her body with sword qi since she was young, she was afraid she would die under that blow.For the sake of lusting after women?Now that she was powerless to resist, it seemed unnecessary for him to pretend to be a good guy.\u201cI don\u2019t care whether you live or die.\u201dShu Shi\u2019s eyes looked out the window and he said softly, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to make that girl sad.\u201dThe silhouette of the girl in white floating appeared in his mind.To Zhan Qingchen, Shu Shi\u2019s emotions were very complicated.On the surface Zhan Qingchen looked like she was \u201ckilling\u201d him, but in reality, it was Shu Shi who was using her.He used her to push the plot forward, to die under her sword in every way possible.Yet when the plan failed, he confessed his love for her, thus changing the plan and regaining his life.And what about Zhan Qingchen?That silly girl trusted him unconditionally and seemed to really like him too.Shu Shi\u2019s eyes were as wide as the stars, suffused with a faint warmth.Seeing his gentle appearance, which was like a different person from the fierce and cruel figure before, Chen Qingluan had a moment of daydreaming.\u201cGirl?\u201d\u201cTo make a demon show such an expression, I guess she should be an extraordinary figure.\u201d\u201cBut what does that have to do with me?\u201dFor some reason, Chen Qingluan inexplicably had a feeling.This demon \u2026\u2026Didn\u2019t seem to be as bad as people thought?But she immediately shook her head hard to drive away those disturbing thoughts.Those demon sects are all the same, can they be trusted easily?It must be because I am too weak to have such a weak mind.Chen Qingluan regained her composure and her eyes became ice-cold and indifferent.Shu Shi took the rope and tied her hands and feet tightly once again, saying indifferently, \u201cYou\u2019d better get rid of your killing aura.\u201d\u201cFor her sake, I will give you a chance, but only this once.\u201d\u201cIf you dare to show even the slightest bit of killing intent again, I won\u2019t hesitate to break your neck.\u201dChen Qingluan winced, sweat pouring out, as if she was being targeted by a predatory beast!She looked flustered and lowered her head, not daring to look at Shu Shi anymore.\u201cAlright.\u201dAfter Shu Shi tied her up, he took out a pill and gave it to her mouth, \u201cTake it and your wounds will heal faster. Once your wounds are healed, this rope won\u2019t be able to trap you, so you can leave on your own.\u201dChen Qingluan opened her cherry lips and swallowed the pill.She was not afraid of the other party poisoning her, as there was no need for it.The pill melted in her mouth and a warm current flowed through her body, her originally dry dantian greedily absorbed energy, and her paper-pale cheeks regained a trace of blood.\u201cWho are you?\u201dChen Qingluan was silent for a long time and asked without thinking.Shu Shi said, \u201cDemon general of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, commander of Fengsha City, Shu Shi.\u201d\u201cShu Shi.\u201dChen Qingluan repeatedly recited it silently, as if engraving the name in her mind.\u201cShu Shi, you hurt me but you also saved me, I consider us even.\u201d\u201cBut you repeatedly committed indecent acts on me, I will remember this hatred!\u201dChen Qingluan clenched her silver teeth.Her chastity was more important to her than her life.Shu Shi didn\u2019t bother to listen.Seeing the other party\u2019s stubborn gaze, a sudden wave of mischief surfaced in his heart.Shu Shi leaned closer to her ear and whispered, \u201cAlthough Imperial Censor Chen has a hard mouth, she still has a soft part over there.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s show eyes rolled, her pupils trembled slightly, and her bright red instantly spread from her cheeks, even her ears were red and hot.\u201cLu, lustful bastard!!!\u201d\u201cI, I\u2019ll bite you to death!\u201dSeeing that she was about to go berserk again, Shu Shi directly wiped his feet and ran out in a huff.Chen Qingluan\u2019s chest rose and fell with an expression of shame and anger.\u201cThis bastard!\u201d\u201cShu Shi, one day sooner or later, I\u2019ll have to tie you up too!\u201dShe was so angry that she rolled around like a caterpillar and ended up accidentally hitting her wound.\u201cHiss, pain, pain, pain~\u201d\u2026\u2026Shu Shi stood outside the door, listening to the explosion of angry roars inside the house, and shook his head helplessly.\u201cThis tigress is too excited.\u201d\u201cI originally intended to milking plot points, but it seems that I\u2019d better stay away from her.\u201dJust then, an order came to his ears.[Chen Qingluan\u2019s heart has changed, made a big decision that affects the next plot trend, earning 5 plot points].[Please keep your good work]Shu Shi: \u201c????\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 \u2013 Bai Qing\u2019s Determination, Qiu Ao\u2019s Sincerity!In the room.\u201cMaster, what did you just say? Cultivation?\u201dBai Qing guessed she had heard wrong.Shu Shi nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right, if you are willing, I can help you set foot on the path to immortality.\u201d\u201cBut the path of cultivation is paved with corpses, and one wrong step could lead to eternal destruction, so I hope you can think about it.\u201dAccording to the system, the \u201cSuper-Grade Talent\u201d opened in the blind box could be used by others.The only person he could think of was Bai Qing.For many years, this girl had been with him, and their relationship had long been more than just master and servant.When Shu Shi played the villain, he had tried to get rid of Bai Qing many times before he was ready to die.Risking failure in his mission, he tried to change her fate.But the girl refused to leave no matter what.In Bai Qing\u2019s words.If my master dies, this servant cannot afford to be alone.\u201cThis is the path to reversing my fate against heaven, I may face countless crises, if you want to follow me, you should at least have the ability to defend yourself.\u201d\u201cIf you refuse, I\u2019m sorry but I will send you away by all means.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to accept it, I will at least give you a life full of glory and wealth.\u201dShu Shi silently made a decision.Bai Qing seemed to have sensed something and her expression became tense.\u201cMaster, are you trying to drive Qing\u2019er away?\u201d\u201cQing\u2019er\u2019s talent is very poor and not suitable for cultivation, but as long as Qing\u2019er can follow master, I can accept it at any price.\u201d\u201cAlthough I can\u2019t fight, I can wash your clothes and cook for you, I can squeeze your shoulders and massage your feet, I \u2026\u2026 really don\u2019t want to leave you.\u201dHer voice trembled slightly, and she had tears in her eyes.Thinking Shu Shi was trying to use this excuse to force her to leave.Shu Shi froze.He paused for a moment, smiled and rubbed Bai Qing\u2019s hair, \u201cSilly, who said I would kick you out?\u201d\u201cClose your eyes, I\u2019ll give you a gift.\u201d\u201cA gift?\u201dBai Qing wiped her tears and meekly closed her eyes.Shu Shi spread out his palms, and a golden ball of light slowly appeared, emitting a bright and dazzling light.The ball of light automatically flew towards Bai Qing and entered her eyebrows.Swoosh!A soft sound seemed to come from within the body.Bai Qing\u2019s figure was hanging in the air, her clothes were flying over, her spiritual power was roaring back towards her, and her root bone meridians were rapidly transformed.Her body was dense with light, exuding a pure and flawless aura.After a long time, the swishing sound stopped.Bai Qing slowly descended from the air.Opening her eyes, streams of light flashed.She was originally beautiful with clear eyebrows, and after the impurities were removed from her body, she became even more radiant and beautiful.Her pupils were clear and bright, her eyebrows arched, her eyelashes slightly twitching, her fair and flawless skin translucent with a faint pink-red, her lips like rose petals delicate and l*stful.Shu Shi gulped his saliva.Why didn\u2019t I find this girl so beautiful before?Bai Qing\u2019s eyes were filled with curiosity, \u201cMaster, I feel like the world has become a different place!\u201dAfter acquiring Super Grade Talent, her perception of things became completely different.Everything became clear and palpable.Shu Shi smiled, \u201cCongratulations, you are already a genius cultivator.\u201dSuper Grade Perfect Talent was indeed worthy of being called a super genius.\u201cReally?\u201dBai Qing blinked, \u201cThen am I allowed to stay by the master\u2019s side?\u201dShu Shi sighed weakly.This silly girl.\u201cOf course, you have signed a contract with me, never leave me in this life.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dBai Qing excitedly jumped into Shu Shi\u2019s arms.Feeling the warmth in her embrace, Shu Shi could barely keep his composure.\u201cI will help you find a suitable cultivation method, and you don\u2019t have to worry about resources, just work hard at your cultivation.\u201d\u201cMm~\u201dBai Qing replied in a nasal voice, hugging Shu Shi like a kitten and rubbing him.\u201cMaster smells so good \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not even listening, are you!\u201d\u2026\u2026Next day.Knock Knock.There was a knock on the bedroom door.Shu Shi opened his eyes and yawned.Looking at Bai Qing who was sleeping soundly beside him, his expression was a little helpless.Last night this girl used the excuse of asking for advice on cultivation and staying in his room, then she also had to warm up his bed, saying that this is the duty of a maid \u2026\u2026\u201cShe doesn\u2019t think of me as a man, does she?\u201dShu Shi frowned slightly.It seemed that next time she would have to show what I were really made of.Getting up, he opened the door to his room.Seeing the man in front of her, he couldn\u2019t help but freeze for a moment.\u201cCommander Qiu?\u201dQiu Ao smiled while arching his hand, \u201cCommander Shu, I\u2019ve taken the liberty to interrupt your rest by coming to the door.\u201d\u201cNo harm, come in and sit down \u2026\u2026\u201dThe words were only halfway through when Shu Shi paused in his tone, suddenly remembering that Bai Qing was still sleeping in his room.Damn, the servant woke up later than his master.Exactly who was serving whom?Qiu Ao was a smart guy and saw that his face was embarrassed, so he immediately realized, \u201cNo need, it\u2019s not a big deal, let\u2019s talk at the door.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dShu Shi nodded his head, \u201cI wonder what\u2019s matter with Commander Qiu?\u201dQiu Ao clapped his hands, \u201cBring it up.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSeveral subordinates presented jade plates and walked over.On it were various pills and spiritual treasures, as well as several storage rings that emitted a faint glow.Shu Shi said in confusion, \u201cCommander Qiu this is \u2026\u2026\u201dQiu Ao said with a smile, \u201cThis is the spoils of war seized from the Righteous people, after discussing with several other commanders, it is considered that this should belong to Commander Shu, who has the most credits.\u201d\u201cAnd please don\u2019t refuse it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And after careful discussion, we all agreed that Commander Shu deserved the most credit, so that\u2019s why we sent this.\u201dShu Shi understood.He knew in his heart that even if he had some credit, it was not to this extent\u2026These people were deliberately showing their good intentions.Whether it was Shenxiu\u2019s attitude, his own potential, or Fengsha City\u2019s current strength, it all made the other commanders see through the fact that in the Southwest Region, Shu Shi was going to the top!Nevertheless, there was still a need to save face.\u201cCommander Qiu praised me too much, this victory belongs to everyone, how can it be for me to have it all alone?\u201dShu Shi had a simple face.Qiu Ao shook his head and said, \u201cCommander Shu, don\u2019t make things difficult for me, if you don\u2019t accept it, I won\u2019t be able to explain to the other commanders.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 My bad.\u201dShu Shi said helplessly, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then I apologize. I will accept it.\u201d\u201cGood, good.Qiu Ao was all smiles.Shu Shi had just picked up the jade plate when he saw Qiu Ao take out another ring.\u201cWhat else \u2026\u2026 is it?\u201d\u201cThis was prepared by Cao Jie, the commander of Qianyang City personally. He is sorry for what happened last time and specifically asked me to send it to you.\u201d\u201cCao Jie?\u201dWithout saying that Shu Shi had almost forgotten this person.Qiu Ao pushed the ring into his hand, \u201cQianyang City has a lot of money, there is no need for Commander Shu to be polite.\u201dShu Shi shook his head.It was true that power determined status.Thinking back to the attitude of the previous people, it was hard not to sigh a little.\u201cCommander Shu \u2026\u2026\u201dAt this point, Qiu Ao wanted to say something but stopped.Shu Shi said, \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate if you want to say something, Commander Qiu.\u201dQiu Ao hesitated for a moment, straightened his back, and said in a low voice, \u201cCommander Shu is young and has a lot of passion, which is understandable, but that Chen Qingluan is no ordinary person!\u201d\u201cAs the youngest imperial censor in the history of Demon Extermination Division, she has a very deep background and is said to have a relationship with the royal family \u2026\u2026 If Commander Shu has had enough fun, remember not to leave any clues.\u201d\u201cChen Qingluan? Enough fun?\u201dShu Shi sniffed for a moment, then reacted.\u201cCommander Qiu misunderstood, I am not interested in that crazy b!tch at all \u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his words, he heard Chen Qingluan shout from next door.\u201cShu Shi! Your rope is tied too tightly, I can\u2019t breathe, come and help me loosen it !\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe atmosphere became eerily silent.Qiu Ao gulped and gave a thumbs up, \u201cEven Chen Qingluan can be tamed, Commander Shu is really amazing! But this hobby well \u2026\u2026 cough cough, is indeed rather unique haha.\u201dThe corner of Shu Shi\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cCommander Qiu really misunderstood!\u201d\u201cI understand, right now I don\u2019t hear anything.\u201dQiu Ao clasped his hands together and said, \u201cThen I won\u2019t bother Commander Shu any further, I\u2019ll leave.\u201dAfter saying this, he didn\u2019t even look back, and led the group of people to leave in a hurry.Shu Shi shook his head and smiled bitterly.\u201cThis time it\u2019s even harder for me to clear my name.\u201d\u201cChen Qingluan, you can not blame me, who let you shout so loudly\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026The battle in Yulin City soon became famous all over the world.Righteous force deliberately infiltrated to conduct a siege in secret, but still ended in a tragic defeat.Lin Quan, a guest from Tianyi Sect, died tragically, Ye Xiao, the future chief disciple, was seriously injured, and Chen Qingluan, the Imperial Censor of the Demon Extermination Division disappeared \u2026\u2026Every single one of them was a heavy blow to the Righteous path!This was one of the few tragic defeats for the Righteous people since the clash between the Righteous force and the Demonic force.It also meant that, aside from Nanli City, the Southwest Region had completely fallen into the palm of the Demonic path!This matter had become a furor, and the people were in a state of anxiety.Rumors of the deaths of cultivators from the Righteous path were heard all the time.However, amidst this chaos, one name jumped to the attention of the major sects.Shu Shi.A minor commander in Fengsha City.He was originally an unknown figure, yet later he defeated Chen Qingluan in battle in Yulin City, severely injured future chief disciple Ye Xiao, and determined the course of the battle with his own strength!The key was that he was only twenty years old this year!A twenty-year-old Realm of Golden Elixir practicioner!With such a terrifying talent, he could almost rival the Number One Genius, Zhan Qingchen!The sects of the Righteous path were even a little confused.A genius of this caliber, instead of staying in the sect to be nurtured, was instead sent to the drab Fengsha City?Demon Empress was truly elusive!\u2026\u2026Youzhou Rift Valley.Netherworld Rakshasa Sect.In the bedroom, behind the phoenix curtain.Yun Qiluo leaned lazily on the phoenix sofa, the long silk dress outlining her slender figure, her slender jade fingers unconsciously curling her long hair, shocking with a hint of innocence only found in a young girl.Who would have thought that this was the Demon Empress of Netherworld, who had the constitution of heaven in her mouth and ruled the demons?\u201cReport to the Sect Patriarch, the Constellation of the Southwest Region has come to see Her Majesty.\u201d\u201cLet him in.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA moment later, Shenxiu walked in with large strides and knelt down on one knee, \u201cConstellation Shenxiu, saluting the Patriarch.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard about the great victory in the Southwest Region. Good, very good.\u201dYun Qiluo said indifferently, \u201cWhat rewards do you want?\u201dShenxiu was very happy, but still said in a modest manner, \u201cAll this is thanks to the plan Patriarch made, this subordinate dare not claim credit\u201d\u201cBesides, this isn\u2019t the work of this subordinate alone, it\u2019s the result of the joint efforts of all the commanders in the Southwest Region, such as Shu, the commander of Fengsha City, who \u2026\u2026\u201dBang!With a muffled sound, Shenxiu was crushed to the ground!The air became extremely heavy, and the terrifying pressure seemed to crush him alive!His face flushed and his veins rippled, and even his breathing became extremely difficult.\u201cPatriarch, Majesty?\u201dShenxiu\u2019s heart and guts trembled as he wondered where he went wrong.There was silence behind the phoenix curtain.After a long time, Yun Qiluo\u2019s voice sounded again, this time with a hint of emotion.\u201cThe Commander Shu you mentioned, is his name Shu Shi?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 \u2013 Demon Empress\u2019s Sweet Gourd, Zhan Qingchen Comes Out!\u201cYes, he is indeed called Shu Shi.\u201dShenxiu looked terrified.Who was this Shu Shi actually that could make the Demon Empress so emotionally out of control?Yun Qiluo paused for a moment and said indifferently, \u201cExplain, what has Shu Shi done?\u201dShenxiu didn\u2019t dare hide it, and told the whole story.\u201cHe broke through to Golden Elixir Realm?\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s delicate brows furrowed slightly.If she remembered correctly, Shu Shi\u2019s talent was only High-grade ordinary.Although it was not too bad, if he wanted to break through to the Golden Elixir Realm, he would need at least ten more years of hard work.\u201cLooks like he had some strange encounters.\u201dWhen she heard that Shu Shi had defeated Chen Qingluan and helped kill Lin Quan, a smile swept across Yun Qiluo\u2019s eyes.However, upon hearing that Shu Shi had taken Chen Qingluan away, the smile instantly disappeared without a trace.\u201cHumph, I thought you had improved a little, but I didn\u2019t think you were still as stupid as before!\u201d\u201cAfter touching Chen Qingluan, do you think the imperial dynasty will be kind enough to let you go?\u201d\u201cTo make such a big enemy just for that small selfish desire, what a fool!\u201dShenxiu slumped to the ground, terrified.Brother Shu, don\u2019t blame me if I can\u2019t keep my promise, who knew that Her Majesty the Patriarch would be so interested in you!After a long time had passed, the tremendous pressure gradually dissipated.Shenxiu remained prostrate on the ground, not daring to get up.Yun Qiluo resumed her languid posture and waved her hand, \u201cYou may leave.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dShenxiu, as if receiving forgiveness, quickly retreated and left.How could he dare think of reward?It\u2019s already a good thing he was allowed to live!\u201cShu Shi \u2026\u2026\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s eyes were slightly dreamy.Memories surfaced in her mind.A boy with clear eyebrows holding a sweet gourd in the cold snow, tilting his head and saying, \u201cBig sister, I\u2019ll treat you.\u201dYun Qiluo was about to leave, but somehow stopped in her tracks.She picked up the sweet gourd and gently took a bite.It was sweet.\u201cDo you want to cultivate, little kid?\u201dThe little boy asked back, \u201cWhat is cultivate? \u201dYun Qiluo thought for a moment and said, \u201cCultivation is \u2026\u2026 being able to make everyone afraid of you and being able to kill the people you want to kill.\u201dThe little boy tilted his head and said, \u201cThen can I protect the people I want to protect?\u201dYun Qiluo nodded, \u201cI guess you can.\u201dThe little boy smiled brightly, \u201cThen I want to cultivate, because I want to protect big sister.\u201dYun Qiluo wondered, \u201cWe have never met before, why do you want to protect me?\u201dThe little boy said correctly, \u201cBecause big sister is very beautiful. Father said that the most beautiful things are fragile and need to be protected.\u201dYun Qiluo froze.As a demonic path cultivator, she was synonymous with cold blood, murderous and ruthless, as she had the Constitution of Heaven in her mouth to command the Demonic force.The world dared not call her by her name, and even her sect disciples would feel fear when confronted with her.But this little kid actually said that he wanted to protect her?After a long silence, Yun Qiluo stretched out her hand, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe little boy, unsuspecting, pushed his little hand into her palm.The two figures floated away, lost in the snow and wind.\u2026\u2026Shu Shi was merely a cultivator at the Late Stage of Realm Foundation Establishment, but he was able to break through to become a demon general and even take command of a city.Everyone felt that it was because of Shu\u2019s family background.But no one knew that Yun Qiluo only wanted to pay for that sweet gourd back then.Yet as a result, it almost killed Shu Shi.She even issued a Black Killing Order for it \u2026\u2026\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that you didn\u2019t die.\u201d\u201cA twenty-year-old Golden Elixir practicioner? That\u2019s not bad.\u201dYun Qiluo raised her delicate chin, \u201cBut if you want to protect me, you\u2019re still too far away for that.\u201d\u201cSomeone!\u201dA shadow appeared from the corner, \u201cThis subordinate is here.\u201d\u201cInvite Shu Shi, the commander of Fengsha City, back to the sect to see me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAlso, cancel the Black Killing Order, that stinky woman Sikong Lanyue must have gone crazy by now.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe shadow disappeared without a sound.Yun Qiluo swung her legs, a small part of her snow-root-like feet peeking out from the hem of her skirt, and hummed softly a tuneless song that echoed longingly in the empty hall.\u2026\u2026Land of the Great Clouds.Tianji Pavilion.Zhan Qingchen stepped out of the Cliff of Reflection, pale sunlight rained on her body, squinting comfortably.Half a month of seclusion.Originally, for her, it was as easy as eating and drinking water.Usually within the sect, she was also basically in a reclusive state.But now was different.Once she closed her eyes, all she could think about was Shu Shi, and she couldn\u2019t calm at all.This caused her to spend the past half month like a year, and it was extremely agonizing.\u201cI don\u2019t know how Shu Shi is doing right now, I wonder if he misses me\u2026\u201dZhan Qingchen regained her senses and shook her head vigorously, \u201cHuu! I can\u2019t think of him right now!\u201dShe took to the air and flew in the direction of her residence.There was a vague feeling that the atmosphere was not quite right along the way.The disciples of the sect looked serious and hurried, as if something big had happened.Back to the residence.Pushing open the door, Xiaoqing greeted her with a smile, \u201cChief, you\u2019ve come out of seclusion?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dZhan Qingchen was puzzled, \u201cHas something happened recently? It feels like there\u2019s a strange atmosphere within the sect.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know yet?\u201dXiaoqing said, \u201cRighteous force cooperated with Demon Extermination Division to encircle Demonic force in Southwest Region, but the result was a complete defeat, losing several Golden Elixir practicioners and a Nascent Soul practicioner.\u201d\u201cSouthwest Region?\u201dZhan Qingchen was stunned, \u201cIsn\u2019t Shu Shi also in the Southwest Region?\u201dXiaoqing nodded, \u201cRight, he\u2019s become a key figure in these events. Tsk! I knew I shouldn\u2019t have let that demon go\u2026\u201dThe words were stopped in mid-sentence.Only to see Zhan Qingchen gripping her arm hard, her face pale and tense, \u201cShu Shi, is he alright?\u201dXiaoqing: \u201c????\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You answer first, how was Shu Shi in the end? Was he injured?\u201dXiaoqing shook her head and said, \u201cNot only was Shu Shi unharmed, but he also soared to great heights, defeating Chen Qingluan in public and becoming the Number One Genius in the Demonic path.\u201d\u201cThank goodness.\u201dZhan Qingchen breathed a sigh of relief and suddenly froze for a moment.\u201cWait a minute, what did you just say? Chen Qingluan?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, in the battle of Yulin City, Imperial Censor Chen disappeared and her whereabouts are still unknown.\u201dHearing what Xiaoqing said, Zhan Qingchen\u2019s delicate brows frowned slightly.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect Qingluan to be involved in this as well.\u201d\u201cBut she should be fine, otherwise, the Demon Extermination Division would have already issued a notice as soon as possible.\u201dChen Qingluan bound the Soul Jade.In the event of an accident, the jade will break.As for missing\u2026For some reason, she always felt that this had something to do with Shu Shi.\u201cLooks like it\u2019s time for me to travel to the Southwest Region.\u201dHmph, I\u2019m doing it for Qingluan, not to see that p*rvert \u2026\u2026Thinking of that kiss when they parted, Zhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes rippled and her fair and beautiful face faintly shone with a blush.Seeing her shy appearance, Xiaoqing said with concern, \u201cChief, your face is so red, you don\u2019t have a fever, do you?\u201d\u201cYou, who are you to say to have a h*rny 3 ?!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be fined another one year\u2019s salary!\u201d\u201cHuh??\u201d\u2026\u2026Yulin City.Shu Shi stood in the empty room, looked at the ropes scattered on the floor, and sighed, \u201cLooks like she recovered faster than I thought.\u201dChen Qingluan was a genius of the sword dao.Born with sword intent engraved in her bones, she had been forged with sword qi since she was young.Whether it was the strength of her physical body or her ability to recover, she far surpassed ordinary Golden Elixir practitioners.\u201cTsk, how could she just leave without saying a word after I took care of her the past few days?\u201d\u201cThat ungrateful woman.\u201dShu Shi snorted unhappily.At that moment, a slurred voice sounded behind him.\u201cWho are you calling ungrateful?\u201dShu Shi turned to look.He only saw Chen Qingluan standing in the doorway, holding a stack of pastries in his arms, her mouth stuffed full and both cheeks puffed out like a hamster.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi said suspiciously, \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dChen Qingluan slurred as she ate the pastries, \u201cMy body had just recovered and I was really too hungry, so I went downstairs to buy some food.\u201dSaying that, she casually handed a piece of plum blossom pastry to Shu Shi.\u201cWould you like to try it?\u201dOnly after handing it out did she realize something was wrong.The plum pasty was missing a piece and there were faint tooth marks on it, obviously she had just bitten into it.She just wanted to take it back, but Shu Shi had already picked it up and put it in his mouth.\u201cNot bad, it tastes good.\u201dShu Shi nodded his head.Chen Qingluan pursed her lips, a hint of embarrassment sweeping across her eyes.Shu Shi scanned her chest, \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve healed all your wounds?\u201dChen Qingluan frowned slightly and covered her collar, \u201cYou p*rverted bastard, which way are you looking?\u201dShu Shi shrugged, \u201cHey what else do you need to cover up? Besides, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve never touched them\u2026\u201dShu Shi had to admit that Chen Qingluan had a good build.Her waist was slender, her legs were long, and her br*asts were round and smooth like jade.Perhaps due to the many years of sword qi softening her body, her skin was not as rough as other sword cultivators, instead it was white and smooth, like solid white jade.\u201cYou!\u201dChen Qingluan stomped his foot hard.I should have known that I should have just left, I would really be pissed off by this p*rverted bastard!Thinking of what happened two days ago, her eyes were so embarrassed and angry that she wanted to pounce and bite him!But then a sense of helplessness arose in her heart.She can\u2019t beat this guy \u2026\u2026\u201cBy the way, I have something for you.\u201dShu Shi took out a long sword from his storage ring and casually tossed it to Chen Qingluan.It was found among the spoils of war sent by Qiu Ao.\u201cAutumn Water?!\u201dChen Qingluan froze.Surprise filled her eyes as she felt the blood connection from it.Although this sword was not a supreme divine weapon, she had long been attached to it, having kept it close to her body for many years.Now, after it was lost and found, hee heart was filled with unspeakable joy.\u201cThank you.\u201dChen Qingluan whispered.Shu Shi waved his hand, unconcerned, \u201cYou treat me to a plum blossom pastry, I return this broken sword to you, and we\u2019re even.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a broken sword!\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s nose wrinkled slightly.Then she burst out laughing.This man didn\u2019t seem so obnoxious.Seeing her flowery smile, Shu Shi nodded and said, \u201cImperial Censor Chen should smile more often.\u201dChen Qingluan blushed and snorted, \u201cWhat difference does it make to you if I smile or not?\u201dShu Shi said seriously, \u201cImperial Censor Chen is easily offended and has serious violent tendencies. I am doing this for your own good.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s smile froze.The long sword in her hand trembled slightly.I retracted my previous thought, this Shu Shi is so obnoxious!1. \u6709\u628a\u67c4\u5728\u4eba\u5bb6\u624b\u91cc = having the handle in the hand of another, means that someone has a knwoledge of your disgrace, bad deed, or something inappropriate so he/she can blackmail you at any time.2.

It was as if you had rabies.\u201dAlthough Chen Qingluan was unsure what rabies was, but she could tell that it was not a good word.She said angrily, \u201cIt\u2019s because you teased me first!\u201dNo man had ever dared to touch her, and Shu Shi was the first, and in such an important place!\u201cI\u2019m so angry with you!\u201d\u201cCough cough.\u201dShu Shi\u2019s face turned red, \u201cIt was an accident.\u201d\u201cAnyway, you insulted me, I will definitely take revenge for this!\u201d\u201cAlthough I am not your opponent now, in five or ten years, I will definitely become stronger than you!\u201d\u201cAt that time \u2026\u2026\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s eyes glared at Shu Shi, \u201cAt that time, I will tie you up as well!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing her puffed up appearance, Shu Shi couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cThat kind of revenge.\u201d\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll wait for that day. If you can really beat me, I have no complaints, but if you lose again \u2026\u2026\u201dHe came to Chen Qingluan\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cI won\u2019t be able to let you go easily.\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s heart skipped a beat!\u201cWhat do you mean, do you want to \u2026\u2026\u201dHer pretty face instantly turned red as she stammered, \u201cHow dare you! If you dare to think dirty, I will, I will cut you!\u201dWhile saying so, she also pointed her finger to his face.It was as if she was amusing him.Seeing that colorful appearance, Shu Shi rubbed her hair and said with a smile, \u201cActually, sometimes you are quite cute.\u201d\u201cCute?!\u201dFeeling the warmth of the large palm, Chen Qingluan froze in place.Redness began to spread from her cheeks, slowly invading her neck and ears, and her entire body seemed to be burning as if she had a fever, with a faint white mist billowing from the top of her head.Ever since she was a child, she had never lacked for praise.Some said she was a natural talent, some said she was the hope of the sword dao, and some said she was the future enemy of the demonic path.But no one had ever called her cute.Even she herself had almost forgotten that she was still a young girl in her early ages.\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi\u2019s voice twitched, \u201cCensor Chen, you\u2019re smoking.\u201dChen Qingluan came back to her senses and bit her lip without speaking.She looked at Shu Shi seriously, as if she wanted to engrave his appearance in her memory, before she turned around and walked towards the door.When she was about to exit, she stopped in her tracks.\u201cShu Shi, one day, I will kill you.\u201dAnd with that, she left without looking back.Shu Shi scratched his head, \u201cIs she angry? I didn\u2019t say anything bad though.\u201dAlthough the other party said she would kill him, he did not take it to heart.This was because unlike the previous times, there was not a hint of killing intent in Chen Qingluan\u2019s voice this time.At that time.[Chen Qingluan underwent a transformation in her heart, affecting the next plot trend, gaining 10 plot points].[Host, continue your good work.]\u201cTen points?\u201dShu Shi almost suspected that he had heard wrong.When Zhan Qingchen had received his confession, it only gave 15 plot points!\u201cI didn\u2019t expect Chen Qingluan to be a \u2018treasure\u2019 girl too?\u201d\u201cSuddenly a little sorry for letting her go \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut how exactly did her heart change?\u201dShu Shi muttered to himself.Above Yulin City.Chen Qingluan\u2019s green clothes fluttered as she glided through the air with a flying sword at her feet.Looking towards the inn, her eyes were blank, not knowing what she was thinking.After a long time, she picked up a piece of plum blossom pastry and gently bit into it with her slightly parted cherry lips.\u201cThe pastries in Yulin City are indeed quite delicious.\u201dBuzz.The autumn water trembled lightly.It swept into the distance like sword light.\u2026\u2026During this trip to Yulin City, Shu Shi gained a lot.A total of 75 full plot points were obtained!Together with spoils of war and Chao Jie\u2019s apology gift, a rough calculation showed that there were four golden marrows alone, nearly a hundred high-grade spirit stones, and thousands of medium-grade spirit stones!That was a huge jackpot!These resources were enough for him and Bai Qing to cultivate to the Late Stage of Golden Elixir Realm!\u201cThose who kill and set fire are rewarded with gold waist belts 1 .\u201dShu Shi shook his head, \u201cIsn\u2019t this villain role more tantalizing than the protagonist?\u201dThe only pity was that he did not get Ye Xiao and Lin Quan\u2019s storage rings.It went without saying that Lin Quan was the powerhouse of Nascent Soul.And as the protagonist, Ye Xiao should still have a lot of good things on him.\u201cNo problem, there will still be many opportunities later, if I remember correctly, there is a hidden place that will be opened soon.\u201dShu Shi silently pondered.Just then, a hoarse female voice sounded in his ears.\u201cCommander Shu.\u201d\u201cWho?!\u201dShu Shi fiercely turned around, his Green Frost Sword instantly released, sword Qi surging out.Someone had entered his room, but he was completely unaware of it!Only to see a shadow twisting in the corner, a black-clothed figure slowly surfaced.This person\u2019s face was covered with black mist, as if it was an evil spirit, and it was impossible to see his true face clearly.\u201cGhost Guard?\u201dShu Shi\u2019s pupils shrank.Twelve Ghost Guards, the Netherworld Demon Empress\u2019 personal bodyguards, whose strength was said to be no less than the Four Saints!\u201cHer Majesty has ordered to summon Shu Shi, Commander of Fengsha City, back to the sect.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShu Shi nodded his head.There was no answer after a long wait.When he looked up, he realized that the Ghost Guard figure had already disappeared.Shu Shi\u2019s eyes flickered.Sure enough, it had already come.From here on, returning to the sect was not in the plot, and he had no idea what the future would hold.Thinking of that beautiful but cold-blooded woman, an absurd thought appeared in his mind.\u201cI wonder if I can get the Demon Empress\u2019 plot points?\u201d1.

This is Commander Shu\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cThe one I\u2019m looking for is Shu Shi.\u201dZhan Qingchen bolted and took a deep breath, \u201cTell him to come out and see me!\u201dNo matter what happened.She decided to give him a chance to explain.Bai Qing rolled her eyes, \u201c Who are you? How can you meet my Master just because you want to?\u201d\u201cMaster?\u201dNoticing the other party\u2019s tone, Zhan Qingchen frowned slightly, \u201cYou called Shu Shi like that, are you his servant?\u201dBai Qing snorted, \u201cYes, what\u2019s the problem?\u201dZhan Qingchen froze.A genius with Super Grade Perfect talent was actually willing to work as a servant for Shu Shi?!It seemed as if she was even proud of herself!This was too outrageous!Swoosh!At that moment, a slight rattling woke her up.Looking back, she saw six men standing by her side, vaguely forming a group.Six people in the Golden Elixir Realm?!Zhan Qingchen was stunned for a while.Isn\u2019t Fengsha the most remote and weakest city in the Southwest Region?But in just a short period of time, she had already seen six Golden Elixir practitioners and a Super Grade Perfect genius!And that did not even include Shu Shi, who was the commander!Crouching tiger, hidden dragon!1Sure enough, my suspicions were right, he deliberately lost to me from the very beginning\u2026.Zhan Qingchen\u2019s cherry lips curled slightly.It seems that she is really important in Shu Shi\u2019s heart!Wu Mang blocked in front of Bai Qing and said vigilantly, \u201cWho come to visit?\u201dThis female cultivator was very strong.He could not see through it.Zhan Qingchen gathered her emotions and said, \u201cI am \u2026\u2026 a friend of Shu Shi, and I came all the way here to see him.\u201d\u201cA friend of the commander?\u201dWu Mang asked in a deep voice, \u201cIs there anything that can prove it?\u201dZhan Qingchen hesitated for a moment, her cheeks flushed slightly under the veil, \u201cJust say that Zhaozhao has come to see him, he will naturally understand when he hears it.\u201d\u201cSo this is the guest of honor.\u201dWu Mang\u2019s expression changed and he arched his hand, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that it was you who came to the door, so I hope you will forgive me if I offended you.\u201dZhan Qingchen was puzzled, \u201cYou know me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dWu Mang said, \u201cBut the commander has instructed that if a girl named Zhaozhao comes here, he must fulfill all her requests and treat her as his guest, not to drive her away.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s heart felt sweet when he heard that.So Shu Shi had been waiting for her all this time!\u201cThen where is he, why didn\u2019t he come out to see me immediately?\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s voice jumped with joy, already looking forward to seeing him.Wu Mang scratched his head, \u201cThis might be a bit difficult, the commander was summoned by the Demon Empress and already left to Youzhou yesterday.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not here?\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s mood instantly sank.It seemed that she had traveled to no avail?Wu Mang thought for a moment and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, you can stay in the residence for a while, the Commander will be back in a few days.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Alright.\u201dZhan Qingchen nodded and said, \u201cBut you must remember not to let anyone know that I am here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWu Mang replied, \u201cThen please go inside.\u201dI wonder what Shu Shi\u2019s face will look like when he sees me when he comes back?Zhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes narrowed as if they were curved crescents.Seeing her aloof and cloudy aura, Bai Qing was a little puzzled for a moment.When did master have a friend who was a female cultivator?\u2026\u2026Youzhou Rift Valley.Under the fog, the magnificent buildings were like layers of mountains, with drastic and rough air.Disciples and deacons walked by, looking like an underground city-state.A man in white slowly stepped into the mountain gate.The air instantly became silent.All eyes were focused on him.He was the genius of the demonic path who had destroyed Chen Qingluan, occupied the Southwest Region and rose to the pinnacle of fame.Shu Shi!1. The name \u201cCrouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\u201d is a literal translation of the Chinese idiom \u201c\u5367\u864e\u85cf\u9f99\u201d which describes a place that is full of talented or extraordinary people who remain hidden and undiscovered, or simply means \u201ctalented or extraordinary people hidden from view\u201d.

That talent is only comparable to Zhan Qingchen!\u201d\u201cBut when he entered the sect, his talent was only high-grade ordinary, so I guess he should have had some strange encounters.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s acceptable, after all, luck is also part of one\u2019s strength.\u201d\u201cCommander Shu is very handsome \u2026\u2026\u201dListening to the whispers around him, Shu Shi looked bland and unperturbed.Great people are those who do not fall when insulted, and do not fly when praised.Of course.That only applied if one did not seek a fight with him.\u201cYo, isn\u2019t this Junior Brother Shu?\u201dA woman with a sexy body stopped in front of him and sneered, \u201cWhat, you just finished making merit and you can\u2019t wait to come back to ask for rewards?\u201dShu Shi stopped in his tracks, his brows furrowed.The person she least expected to see had appeared.Cen Yiren.An inner disciple senior sister of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect.Although her name was Yiren, it had nothing to do with her character.1Hot-tempered, brutal, and arrogant, she screamed for blood the moment someone offended her.If Chen Qingluan had violent tendencies, then this senior sister was an extremely violent maniac!Ever since Shu Shi first joined the sect, Cen Yiren had looked at him with displeasure.Finding fault and fighting against him at every turn.Shu Shi was familiar with the storyline, so he naturally knew why.Cen Yiren was a loyal admirer of Demon Empress.But Demon Empress treated her coldly, instead treating Shu Shi, who had an ordinary talent, very special.Not only did she teach him netherworld cultivation methods, but she also promoted him to the position of Commander of Fengsha City exclusively.This made Cen Yiren extremely jealous inwardly.And blamed everything on Shu Shi.\u201cGet out of the way.\u201dShu Shi said indifferently.Cen Yiren froze for a moment, then her expression became colder, \u201cIt seems like Junior Brother Shu has become so arrogant and no longer puts me, his Senior Sister, in his sights.\u201d\u201cSenior sister?\u201dShu Shi\u2019s voice was calm, \u201cAlthough you joined the sect before me, you have no position in it, and you and I are neither superiors nor subordinates, so I really don\u2019t need to put you in my sights.\u201d\u201cInstead, you should call me Commander Shu.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dCen Yiren was furious, her chest heaving violently.When did this brat become so stubborn?Shu Shi glanced at her secretly.What a good girl.Not bad for an older sister!Cen Yiren said sternly, \u201cHow dare you speak to me like that? Do you know who I am?\u201d\u201cOf course I know.\u201dShu Shi said, \u201cYou are the daughter of Saint Cen Baihu, but so what? Can you make a Saint kill me?\u201dCen Yiren\u2019s breath hitched.She indeed could not.Although Cen Baihu was his father, he would never attack a fellow sect disciple for her.Shu Shi sighed, \u201cSenior sister Cen, if you want to gain the favor of Her Majesty, you must rely on your own efforts, not play these childish tricks like playing house.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really calling me childish?\u201dCen Yiren almost died of anger.As if to prove herself, she pushed her chest up hard, \u201cNow, do you still dare to call me childish?\u201d\u201cCough cough!\u201dShu Shi almost choked to death from swallowing his saliva.\u201cPhysical maturity doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the mind is mature, as the saying goes, that big ones usually have no brains! \u2026\u2026 senior sister still has a long way to go.\u201dAfter saying that, he walked right past her.This place is not suitable for staying for a long time.Who knows what else this brainless senior sister can do?\u201cYou, you, you, you said I have no brain?!\u201dCen Yiren reacted, her eyes almost spitting fire.She turned her head and roared towards Shu Shi\u2019s back, \u201cWho said I have no brains, can\u2019t you see it when it\u2019s so obvious!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so angry!\u201dIf it weren\u2019t for the ban on fighting randomly within the sect, she would have definitely beaten Shu Shi to death!Seeing Cen Yiren with her teeth and claws, the surrounding disciples fell silent and rushed to hide far away for fear of being caught by this tigress to vent her anger.In the far corner.The burly man with short silver hair couldn\u2019t help but clap his hands as he watched the scene and said with a smile, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that girl to be at a loss for words.\u201dA thin man next to him shook his head and said, \u201cYiren is getting upset, and you\u2019re still laughing as a father?\u201dThe burly man shook his head and said, \u201cWhat do you know? With her temperament, if no one helps her to heal her, I don\u2019t know how much suffering she will have in the future. \u201d\u201cEveryone in the sect is afraid of her because of her identity, only this Shu Shi doesn\u2019t put her in his sights.\u201d\u201cAlright, this is a little interesting.\u201dThe burly man\u2019s eyes filled with laughter.\u2026\u2026Rakshasa Demon Palace.Standing in front of the luxurious room, Shu Shi said in a loud voice, \u201cShu Shi, Commander of Fengsha City, has come to see Your Majesty.\u201dA moment later, an indifferent voice rang through the air.\u201cCome in.\u201dShu Shi took a deep breath and lifted his foot to step into the hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 \u2013 Facing with Demon Empress, you can go to hell!The hall was carved with pillars and painted with splendor, showing luxury and nobility.Yun Qiluo was reclining on a phoenix chair, and even through its silk curtains, one could still feel her stunning beauty and brightness.The incense burnt in the incense burner makes people sway in the heart.Shu Shi stood with his hands down and did not look away.Netherworld Demon Empress.Ruthless, cold and ambitious.When facing a woman like this, one must not harbor the slightest fantasies, or else the bones might disappear in the next moment.Even if she is truly beautiful.There was silence in the great hall.After a long time, Yun Qiluo inexplicably said, \u201cShu Shi, I didn\u2019t expect you to have grown up so much.\u201d\u201cReporting to Your Majesty! this subordinate is already twenty years old this year.\u201dShu Shi replied.Yun Qiluo nodded, \u201cI already knew that, but for some reason, my impression of you has always stuck in your childhood.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s normal.\u201dShu Shi said, \u201cIt\u2019s been twelve years since this subordinate saw Your Majesty.\u201dHe had joined the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect at the age of seven.Yun Qiluo personally taught him the Netherworld cultivation method.This was something unprecedented and caused an uproar in the sect at the time, with everyone believing that she was preparing her heir.A year later, on the aptitude test, Shu Shi, the highly anticipated \u2018heir of Her Majesty\u2019, only had ordinary high-grade aptitude.This shocked the everyone.From then on, Yun Qiluo had never seen him again.It was as if she had forgotten this man, leaving him alone.Only after Shu Shi reached Late Stage of Foundation Establishment was he promoted to the position of Fengsha City Commander.However, this time, people had different thoughts.How could such a mediocre person be worthy of Her Majesty\u2019s attention?The only thing Her Majesty cares about must be Shu\u2019s family background!Yun Qiluo said in a deep voice, \u201cAre you still complaining about me?\u201d\u201cThis subordinate doesn\u2019t dare.\u201dShu Shi clasped his hands and said, \u201c This subordinate has mediocre talent and dull qualifications, so I\u2019m already lucky to join the sect, how can I dare to ask for more?\u201dSeeing his calm appearance, Yun Qiluo\u2019s heart inexplicably felt uncomfortable.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to take care of you, but if I pay too much attention to you, I\u2019ll end up harming you instead.\u201dShu Shi was right on one point.His talent was only that of a high-grade ordinary.Although it was not too bad, it was far from enough to become the Demon Empress\u2019 heir.For the sake of the century-long plan to fight for the Central Plains, the fanatics in the sect would never allow this to happen.The situation would then be extremely dangerous.So Yun Qiluo\u2019s distance was actually an attempt to protect me?Shu Shi thought no more and shook his head, \u201cThis subordinate dare not ask for more. \u201dYun Qiluo frowned, \u201cYou are indeed still complaining about me.\u201d\u201cThis subordinate dare not \u2026\u2026\u201dBang!Yun Qiluo smashed the armrest of the phoenix chair with a slap!\u201cDare not this, dare not that, then why did you dare to give me a sweet gourd that time to me?\u201dShu Shi froze, \u201cSweet gourd?\u201dThrough the silk curtain, Yun Qiluo looked directly into his eyes, \u201cWhy did you dare to give me sweet gourd, why did you dare to say you would protect me, and why did you dare to come with me?\u201d\u201cAnswer me!\u201dFaced with a series of persistent interrogations, Shu Shi fell silent.It\u2019s been thirteen years, but I didn\u2019t expect the Demon Empress to still remember this matter.Could it be that it was important to her?He suddenly had difficulty seeing the woman in front of him.After a long time, Shu Shi averted his gaze and said in a low voice, \u201cBack then, this subordinate was young and full of childish words, so I hope Your Majesty can tolerate it.\u201dYun Qiluo leaned back in her chair and said indifferently, \u201cDo you mean that what you said back then is no longer valid?\u201dThere seemed to be a faint glow in her phoenix eyes, as if she was expecting something.\u201cYour Majesty has suppressed all over the world and is invincible, how could she still need the protection of this subordinate?\u201dShu Shi lowered his brows and lowered his eyes, \u201cBut if Your Majesty give the order, this subordinate is willing to go to hell and pass ten thousand deaths for Your Majesty.\u201dThere was silence in the hall.The light in Yun Qiluo\u2019s eyes disappeared, once again becoming as deep as an abyss, like a cold and dead sea.\u201cTen thousand deaths?\u201dShe nodded and said indifferently, \u201cGood, then you can go to hell.\u201dBoom!A terrifying pressure rushed down, and Shu Shi seemed to be crushed by heaven and earth as he spat out a mouthful of blood and fell helplessly to the ground.His meridians seemed to be torn apart inch by inch, and he was unable to use a single ounce of his spiritual energy.Even his consciousness became a little hazy.In a vague way, he saw a flash of robes walking in front of him, accompanied by a refreshing scent.Yun Qiluo\u2019s voice sounded, \u201cIs there anything else you want to say?\u201dShu Shi struggled to lift his head, blood reflecting even paler on his cheeks.\u201cThis subordinate knows what Your Majesty want to hear\u201d\u201cBut even if I say it, what difference does it make? It\u2019s not me you care about, it\u2019s that little boy in the past.\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s face was expressionless, \u201cSo what? Do you regret it?\u201d\u201cThe mountains and seas cannot be leveled.\u201dShu Shi smiled, \u201cHowever, if I\u2019m allowed to live a second life, I\u2019ll still treat you a sweet groud.\u201dYun Qiluo was silent.Her eyes were downcast, unable to see her emotions, but the slender hands behind her back were calmly clenched.\u201cIs that all?\u201dShe stretched out her slender fingers and rubbed Shu Shi\u2019s eyebrows.As if turning back time, in almost an instant, his injuries were completely healed, even the blood on his body disappeared.\u201cThank you, Your Majesty, for not killing me.\u201dShu Shi\u2019s voice was very calm.It appeared calm on the surface, yet he was already cursing inwardly.Damn it, I almost died!The Demon Empress was too powerful and her character was so temperamental that even if he knew the storyline well, it was difficult for him to deal with her.It was too dangerous to be around such a character.If he was not careful, he would be annihilated into ashes!At this moment, Yun Qiluo suddenly asked, \u201cYou just said that the mountains and oceans cannot be leveled \u2026\u2026 There should be half a sentence left, right? What\u2019s the rest?\u201dShu Shi shook his head, \u201cThis subordinate is unable to say it.\u201d\u201cSay it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSu Shi swallowed and said, \u201cThe person I love is separated by mountains and oceans, and mountains and oceans cannot be leveled.\u201d 1Yun Qiluo\u2019s expression was stunned.\u201c The person I love is separated by mountains and oceans\u2026 and the mountains and oceans cannot be leveled.\u201dShe chewed silently for a long time, then coldly snorted, \u201cWhat a bad poem.\u201dShu Shi breathed a sigh of relief, \u201cIt is indeed a bad poem.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dYun Qiluo turned around and walked towards the door.Su Shi scratched his head, confused, \u201cYour Majesty, where are we going?\u201d\u201cTo accompany me for dinner.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShu Shi followed behind.For some reason, he felt that Yun Qiluo\u2019s steps were a little lighter.She seems \u2026\u2026 happy?1. A complete sentence is \u6240\u7231\u9694\u5c71\u6d77\uff0c\u5c71\u6d77\u4e0d\u53ef\u5e73\u3002It means\uff1aThe person I love and I\uff0camong us\uff0cThere are mountains and seas\u3002If I remove mountains and fill up seas\uff0cI could have met her\uff0cand she may love me\uff0cAnd, of course, I cannot do this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 \u2013 Shu Shi, Let\u2019s eat!In the dining room.The serving girls passed by silently as mountains of food were brought to the table.The jade plates filled with delicacies were so fragrant that one could even see the billowing spiritual energy.Shu Shi sat beside Yun Qiluo.It was a close call.He looked calm, but in his heart he was agitated.He thought that the Demon Empress summoned him to fight in the Southwest Region, but unexpectedly she didn\u2019t say anything about it.In fact, she had been very interested in that 'sweet gourd\u201d in the past.Thinking back to a snowy night more than ten years ago \u2026\u2026When he was seven years old, Shu Shi had just crossed over.As required by the plot, he had to join the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect.However, even if he did nothing, he would be put into the sect due to his status as the \u201cfirst son of the Shu family\u201d.However, Shu Shi was so amazed by Yun Qiluo\u2019s beauty that he gave her a sweet gourd \u2026\u2026He thought it was just a fleeting scene, but he didn\u2019t expect that the other party would remember it until now.This is important to her?Shu Shi frowned slightly.Just now in the main hall, Yun Qiluo was acting strangely.She seemed to be trying to prove that he was still the same boy who once said that he would \u201cprotect her\u201d.Shu Shi could not understand what she was thinking.He could only try to calm down and control himself, not triggering her anger as much as possible.But as a result, he almost died.Fortunately, after some extreme pulling, he finally managed to escape with blood.In the presence of such a powerful person, who treats human life like dirt, the slightest mistake could lead to the end of the world.Do you need a reason to trample an ant to death?Shu Shi understood the reason.But this only aroused his anger!So what if you are a Demon Empress?A man can only die when his gaze is turned toward the sky!1Since I have decided to go against the destiny of heaven, I must live sacrificially, how can I reach the top if I am afraid?With this thought in mind, Shu Shi\u2019s mind became clear.He picked up his silver chopsticks and put a piece of cod meat into his mouth.The meat was soft and tender and melted in his mouth.It turned into a stream of spiritual energy that flowed into his dantian.Shu Shi\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cDelicious!\u201dNot only was it delicious, but it also increased strength!These ingredients were all rare spiritual items in the world, and only the Demon Empress could be so extravagant as to make them into delicacies and bring them to the table.Although to Yun Qiluo, this amount of spiritual power means nothing.But to him it was a great tonic!\u201cLet\u2019s eat!\u201d 2Shu Shi swung his chopsticks and sweep up his meal.The surrounding servants were dumbfounded.No one had ever been able to dine with Her Majesty before.\u201cThis Shu Commander should have been afraid of this Her Majesty, but instead he was so unconcerned?\u201d\u201cIt was as if he was actually here to eat!\u201dYun Qiluo was also stunned for a moment.It felt like Shu Shi had suddenly become spontaneous and relaxed.Seeing how he was eating, she couldn\u2019t help but ask curiously, \u201cIs it delicious?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bad, Your Majesty can try it.\u201dShu Shi took a piece of fish and put it into Yun Qiluo\u2019s bowl.\u201cHiss!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s actually serving dishes to Her Majesty!?\u201d\u201cAnd with his own used chopsti cks?!\u201dThe servants were terrified.The next scene, however, almost made their jaws drop to the floor.They saw Yun Qiluo pick up the fish, her cherry mouth slightly open and she gently took a bite.\u201cHmm, hmm really not bad.\u201d\u201cIf you like it, I can have someone make it for you every day.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Majesty, but that is not necessary.\u201dShu Shi shook his head, \u201cThe impression when tasting a dish for the first time is the most amazing. If you eat it every day, even the delicacies of heaven will taste like chewing wax.\u201dYun Qiluo pondered for a moment and nodded, \u201cThat makes sense, no wonder I made people search all over Nanli City but could no longer find that delicious sweet gourd.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi scratched his head.Not sure what to say.Yun Qiluo smiled and said, \u201cToday\u2019s meal, however, seems to be a bit tastier than usual, so it seems that who we eat with is also an important thing.\u201dSeeing her smile, Shu Shi was a little confused.The corners of her mouth smiled lightly, like a blooming jade orchid, and her eyes were watery and misty, as if a bright pearl was born with a halo.The beauty of her was so bright that it made the mountains, rivers, sun and moon pale in comparison.A smile that would enchant an entire city, and another smile that would enchant an entire country.\u201cIf a woman\u2019s beauty is measured by light, then Her Majesty\u2019s beauty is like sunlight. And if that light were edible, with Your Majesty at my side, where would be the need for these delicacies?\u201dShu Shi regretted it as soon as he finished speaking.Have I really gone crazy, how could I tempt the Netherworld Demon Empress?Although I should give her a good impression.But that doesn\u2019t mean that I should actively seek death!Yun Qiluo\u2019s smile tightened as she said, \u201cBe careful of what you say in public.\u201dShu Shi hurriedly said, \u201cThis subordinate got too carried away, I hope Your Majesty forgives this subordinate.\u201d\u201cEat.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI also want to eat that fish.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShu Shi took another piece of spirit cod and placed it in her bowl.At this time, a deacon came in and knelt on the ground and said, \u201cReport to Your Majesty, West Saint requests an audience.\u201dYun Qiluo ate the fish in small bites as if she had heard nothing.The deacon lowered his eyebrows and bowed his head, not daring to get up.After eating the fish in the bowl, she took a fragrant handkerchief and wiped the corners of her mouth.\u201cLet him come in.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe deacon retreated.A moment later, a burly man stepped in, his voice like a bell.\u201cI, Western Saint Cen Baihu, pay my respects to Your Majesty!\u201d\u201cI hope Your Majesty doesn\u2019t mind that I interrupted your meal \u2026\u2026 Huh, Commander Shu is here too?\u201dCen Baihu froze.\u201cGreetings to the Western Saint.\u201dShu Shi raised his head.The burly man in front of him was nearly two meters tall, with a sturdy and strong body, short silver hair that was valiant and slender, and an aura of courage and strength.He is like a ferocious tiger on the mountain!Yun Qiluo glanced at him, \u201cDon\u2019t mind him, continue eating your food.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShu Shi continued to bury his head into the meal.Cen Baihu\u2019s throat was dry and his pupils constricted slightly.What is this Commander Shu\u2019s true identity!?1. It means that a man must fight bravely. Even if he should die, he must not turn his back to the sky. Generally speaking, it is a metaphor for running away from battle and getting hacked from behind so that his back faces the sky.2. This is Chinese slang \u5e72\u996d!

If the major forces of all parties fight and kill each other, it is feared that the world will be destroyed, which is not in the interests of all parties.The other is that the main heir must not be deliberately targeted.This is because it represents the future of the sect.If you kill the opponent\u2019s heir, the opponent can also kill your heir, which will consume the inheritance in vain, and the end result is that both parties are harmed.And the Black Killing Order previously issued by the Demon Empress had completely touched these two red lines.This is undoubtedly a declaration of war against Tianji Pavilion!Cen Baihu frowned and said, \u201cYour Majesty, the Black Killing Order is not child\u2019s play, since it was issued there is no reason to retract it. With such irregularities, I am afraid that some people might question Your Majesty\u2019s mightiness\u2019.\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s voice was low, \u201cAre you teaching me to do something?\u201dCen Baihu\u2019s spine went cold and he fell to his knees with a\u00a0\u201cpoof\u201d.\u201cI dare not!\u201dHis face was white and cold sweat soaked through his shirt.Yun Qiluo said indifferently, \u201cI know that you\u2019re the outspoken type, so I\u2019ll ignore it this time.\u201d\u201cAs for the Black Killing Order \u2026\u2026\u201dShe glanced at Shu Shi who was eating his rice, \u201cSince Shu Shi is not dead, there is no reason for me to kill Zhan Qingchen.\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201dShu Shi, who was drinking soup, spit out a mouthful.\u201cCough cough!\u201d\u201cSorry!! You both keep talking, I don\u2019t hear anythin g.\u201dHe wiped his mouth awkwardly and shouted in his heart.What\u2019s with this Demon Empress!Did she issue the Black Killing Order to avenge me?There was no such part in the original plot!Could it be that the plot secretly changed when I gave her the sweet gourd back then?Shu Shi suddenly felt that things seemed to be moving in an uncontrollable direction \u2026\u2026Cen Baihu was also confused.\u201cWhat does Your Majesty mean by this?\u201d\u201cZhan Qingchen is the main heir of Tianji Pavilion, while Shu Shi is just one of the many demon generals, his status is very different, \u2026\u2026 this also doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201dHer words were not insulting.Zhan Qingchen, a genius with Super Grade Perfect talent, she\u2019s the treasured child of Tianji Pavilion.And Shu Shi is just a little demon general, even if he died, she will still have 197 generals left.The two were not even comparable!Yun Qiluo\u2019s voice was calm, but the words that came out were extremely cold.\u201cTherefore I intend to choose Shu Shi as the main heir.\u201d\u201cIf Tianji Pavilion kills my Chief Disciple, I will kill their Chief Disciple, is there a problem with that?\u201dThud.The spoon fell to the ground.Shu Shi looked dumbfounded and confused.\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cChief Disciple?\u201d\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re alright, Your Majesty?\u201dHe himself had just given the Demon Empress two bites of food and the she was going to make him the main heir?What the hell is this!Cen Baihu couldn\u2019t understand it either.\u201cYour Majesty please think twice!\u201d\u201cThe position of heir is a very important matter, it should not be taken lightly!\u201d\u201cBesides, his talent is not very good either!\u201dThe position of sect heir had been vacant for many years.Now it was said to be passed down to a little demon general with ordinary talent?Maybe Shu Shi had a few encounters and was able to defeat Chen Qingluan, but in the long run, this was definitely not a wise decision!\u201cRight, right, I can\u2019t do it!\u201dShu Shi nodded vigorously.He just wants to make a fortune in silence, but he doesn\u2019t want to be a winner!Yun Qiluo glared at him, \u201cIf it was before, I wouldn\u2019t force you, but right now, what kind of talent do you have, don\u2019t you clearly know it?\u201dWhen she first met Shu Shi, she could tell that something was wrong.Originally, she also couldn\u2019t believe it in her heart.But in the process of hitting this man hard and healing him again, she had completely mapped out his roots and bones.Shu Shi\u2019s talent today was countless times greater than Zhan Qingchen\u2019s!This was not something that could be achieved by chance!Could this \u2026\u2026 be the will of heaven?A smile swept across the bottom of Yun Qiluo\u2019s eyes.\u201cThis is \u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi touched his nose, his expression not quite natural.Could it be that the Demon Empress had seen through me?Seeing that he was unwilling to admit it, Yun Qiluo hummed, \u201cIf I remember correctly, this year\u2019s Talent Testing Event has already started, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect time, Shu Shi, you go and take the test.\u201dCen Baihu breathed a sigh of relief at her words.As long as he participated in the Talent Testing Event, then everything would be self-evident.When the facts were laid out before her, in the face of opposition from the entire sect, I believe that Her Majesty could no longer remain stubborn.Shu Shi had a bitter expression on his face, \u201cCan I not go?\u201dYun Qiluo was very firm, \u201cNo!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 \u2013 The Figure in White, the peerless genius in history!Netherworld Rakshasa Sect.As the number one demon sect, the depth of its legacy and strength was so great that it was a powerhouse that could compete with the Righteous path and the Imperial Dynasty.The Netherworld Demon Empress, was a peerless behemoth.She was a devastating and invincible existence.There were only a few who could compete with her in this world.So even though the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect was a demonic sect, there were still many people who strived to enter.But it was not an easy task to enter this sect.First of all.The Netherworld Rakshasa Sect only had half a month to recruit disciples every year.All of them had to go through a strict screening process to ensure that their identities came from a clean background.The next step was talent.The Netherworld Rakshasa Sect was very strict about aptitude.Each class was divided into: Ordinary, Premium and Perfect.High-grade and Middle-grade were just the minimum requirements to enter the sect. If you want to enter the inner sect, you should at least start with High-grade ordinary.As for the direct disciples \u2026\u2026So far, no one has been able to meet the requirements.The valley of the shadow of death.This valley is located in the deepest part of the Rift, right between the Inner Gate and the Outer Gate, like a chasm separating the two worlds.On one side it was prosperous like a royal city and imperial capital, while on the other side it was like a remote and desolate area.This is where the Talent Testing was held.This valley was now filled with young people, even small children under ten years old.Everyone\u2019s faces were filled with nervousness and anticipation.If you were talented enough, you would be able to enter the inner sect and enjoy a complete inheritance and abundant resources.If you were not talented enough, you would be sent back to where you came from, or at best become nameless ordinary disciples in the outer sect.For them, this was the moment that would decide their fate.In the center of the valley was a green stone cube with a white jade as tall as a person standing in the center.Soul Perception Jade.If you place your hand on it, you can feel the root of your talent, and the brighter the light, the stronger the talent.The deacon holds the list in his hand.The person whose name was read out came forward to touch the jade.\u201cFan Debiao, Middle-grade ordinary talent, may not enter the sect.\u201d\u201cZhang Sirui, High-grade ordinary talent, may enter the inner sect.\u201d\u201cLi Fuer, Middle-grade perfect, can enter the outer sect.\u201d\u201cSun Xiang \u2026\u2026\u201dAfter hearing the results, some people jumped for joy, others slumped, and there were even some who screamed hysterically on the spot.There were all sorts of people.Cen Yiren sat on the high stage, crossed her legs and watched the scene boredly.As the Senior Sister of the inner sect, she had to be there for the talent testing event.\u201cNot even High-grade perfect, this year\u2019s disciples don\u2019t seem to be very good.\u201dHer talent was Super-grade ordinary, and she was already among the ranks of Heavenly Proud\u2019s first class, so she did have some capital to boast about herself.At this moment, a figure flashed through Cen Yiren\u2019s mind.\u201cShu Shi is only a High-grade ordinary, how can he be favored by Her Majesty?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it just because he defeated Chen Qingluan?\u201d\u201cIf I become the commander, I can definitely do better than him!\u201dThinking of Shu Shi\u2019s disdainful gaze, Cen Yiren was furious.\u201cThat bastard, how dare he call me childish and brainless?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make sure he regrets it next time we meet!\u201dNo disciple in the sect would ever dare to speak to her like that!At that moment, the deacon looked slightly stunned, as if he had received some instructions.\u201cThe Talent Testing Event is suspended!\u201d\u201cBy order of the Sect Patriarch, Commander of Fengsha City is welcome to take the stage for talent testing!\u201dThe air became silent.The crowd parted on either side and gazed towards the back, only to see a figure in white slowly approaching.\u201cCommander Shu?\u201d\u201cThe hero credited for the victory in the Southwest Region?\u201d\u201cHe must be very talented to defeat Chen Qingluan, right?\u201d\u201cUgh, he\u2019s such a handsome guy!\u201dOn the highest platform.Cen Yiren looked puzzled.\u201cShu Shi?\u201d\u201cWhy is he here?\u201dSeeing the white-clothed figure and the admiring gazes of the disciples, she was furious.\u201cOnly a High-grade ordinary, how dare he come to the Talent Testing Event to show off?\u201d\u201cJust wait until you\u2019re embarrassed!\u201dAgainst everyone\u2019s gazes, Shu Shi\u2019s footsteps were extremely heavy.He only wanted to gain some fortune, but he did not expect to be forced to this point.What exactly does the Demon Empress want to do?I haven\u2019t seen her for twelve years, and she just met me and made me the main heir?Isn\u2019t this a joke!If he was just a little demon, he could still throw dirt in Demon Empress\u2019 face.But if he became the Chief Disciple, he would become a real villain, and it wouldn\u2019t be that easy to get away from it later!But now, there was nothing he could do.\u201cForget it, let\u2019s just take one step and see what happens.\u201dShu Shi stood in front of the Soul Perception Jade, sighed slightly and reached out to place his hand on the jade.The jade lit up with a luminous white light.\u201cShu Shi, High-grade ordinary \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI knew it.\u201dCen Yiren gave a satisfied smile.However, the next second, her smile froze on her face.Buzz!With a soft sound, the Soul Perception Jade exploded with a dazzling light, like a blazing sun rising, a blinding glare that made it impossible to see straight.\u201cHigh-grade perfect?\u201d\u201cNo, Super-grade perfect?\u201dThe deacon was already confused.The brightness was still increasing, even the air temperature was rising, and the searing heat wave made the crowd retreat involuntarily.The dazzling white light illuminated the entire valley, even penetrating the mist above the Rift!\u201cHoly, Holy-grade?!\u201dBoom!A muffled voice rang out.As everyone watched in horror, the Soul Perception Jade exploded into countless pieces with a bang!The fragments hung in the air, emitting endless light like a vast cosmic river of stars!Under the starry sky, Shu Shi stood tall and silent.He was dressed in white, like a heavenly deity!The valley was deathly silent.After a long time, the deacon\u2019s trembling voice rang out.\u201cShu Shi Talent is\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHoly-grade perfect!!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 \u2013 Shu Shi\u2019s helplessness? Cen Baihu\u2019s bad idea!\u201cShu Shi, talent: Holy-grade perfect!\u201dThe deacon\u2019s voice echoed for a long time.The valley of the shadow of death was deathly quiet.Everyone\u2019s expressions were dumbfounded, and they did not return to their senses for a long time.There is no shortage of geniuses in this world, but geniuses are also divided into three, six and nine classes.Among them, Zhan Qingchen, who is a Super-grade perfect, already stands at the peak and is known as a top-level genius that is rarely found in a thousand years.Like a mountain towering into the clouds, others could only stand at the foot of the mountain and sigh in admiration.This has already happened at the Super-grade perfect level.What is the concept of Holy-grade perfect?To merge with the Great Dao, to harmonize with the heavenly realm, to control heaven and earth, to control yin and yang!The innate heart of Dao will be no flaw, and there will be no obstacles on the path of cultivation!This is a realm that only exists in legends, but now it stands before them in a living state.The first genius in history!\u201cCommander Shu \u2026\u2026\u201dA low shout rang out from the crowd.In an instant, everyone\u2019s emotions were ignited.\u201cCommander Shu, Commander Shu, Commander Shu!\u201dThe shouts were like a mounting roar.The crowd swarmed around him, their faces filled with madness.Today, they had witnessed history!At high platform.Cen Yiren\u2019s eyes were blank as she stared blankly at the man in the center of the crowd.Clad in white clothes, wrapped in starlight, his incomparably handsome face was undisturbed, as if he didn\u2019t care about any of this.\u201cHow is that possible?\u201dAlthough unwilling to believe it, she knew that the Soul Jade Perception stone could not be wrong.Holy-grade, was the limit of what the Soul Jade Perception stone could detect.If it reached Holy-grade perfect, then the Soul Jade Perception Stone would shatter into a sky of starlight.It was exactly the same as the astonishing scene earlier.Thinking of what he said, and recalling Shu Shi\u2019s disdainful gaze, Cen Yiren\u2019s cheeks seemed to burn like fire.Talent, it had always been something she was proud of.Now she was being stepped on by a man she hated.\u201cSo all this time he was making fun of me secretly and thought of me as a joke?\u201d\u201cShu Shi, you bastard!\u201dClick.There seemed to be a soft click in the ear.That was her shattered pride \u2026\u2026Above the valley of the shadow of death.Two figures were hidden in the mist.Yun Qiluo said indifferently, \u201cNow do you have anything else to say Saint Cen?\u201dCen Baihu\u2019s mind was buzzing.Say what?There was nothing more to say!It was Holy-grade after all!There might not be one in tens of thousands of years!What kind of heavenly pride is this?If Shu Shi was a diamond, then everyone else was just a pebble!If this genius could be obtained, and if the sect could cultivate it, the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect would stand at the peak of the Nine Realms!And she still asked for his opinion regarding Shu Shi?\u201cThis subordinate is stupid and ignorant, I hope Your Majesty forgives me!\u201dCen Baihu looked excited, \u201cYour Majesty is wise, having such a genius is indeed a blessing from heaven, our sect will experience great prosperity!\u201dThe speech was a bit incoherent.Yun Qiluo looked at Shu Shi from afar and sighed, \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t seem too willing.\u201d\u201cThere are still people who can refuse the Chief Disciple position?\u201dCen Baihu was puzzled.Chief Disciple had a noble status, endless resources, and if everything went smoothly, he would be the future heir to the sect\u2019s throne.He really couldn\u2019t think of any reason for the other party to refuse.Yun Qiluo shook her head, \u201cNot everyone cares about power and status, Shu Shi he \u2026\u2026 is very special.\u201d\u201cSeven emotions and six desires are human nature, and since he is a human being, he must have desires.\u201dCen Baihu cupped his chin and muttered to himself, \u201cSince Shu Shi does not care about power and status, what he cares about must be \u2018beauty\u2019.\u201dYun Qiluo froze for a moment, \u201cBeauty?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dCen Baihu said with certainty, \u201cIn my experience, at a passionate age like his, what he likes most is something gentle and soul-stirring.\u201dYun Qiluo wanted to reply.Suddenly she remembered what Qiu Ao had said:\u00a0Shu Shi had taken Chen Qingluan away in public \u2026\u2026\u201cCould it be that he really \u2026\u2026\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s phoenix eyes glazed over slightly as she quietly spat.\u201cThat slutty brat!\u201dAt this moment, Cen Baihu\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cYour Majesty, this subordinate has a wonderful plan!\u201dYun Qiluo said curiously, \u201cTell me!\u201dCen Baihu said seriously, \u201cI am willing to marry off my daughter to Shu Shi, so that she can guard his soul and heart!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s eyebrows jumped wildly, \u201c This is the wonderful plan you are talking about?\u201d\u201cYour daughter is hot-tempered, stupid, and wishful thinking, are you trying to scare Shu Shi?\u201dCen Baihu had an embarrassed look on his face, \u201cYour Highness is too blunt.\u201dYun Qiluo coldly snorted, \u201cI\u2019m warning you, don\u2019t do anything nasty to Shu Shi!\u201d\u201cEven if you want to use beauty \u2026\u2026, it\u2019s not your tigress\u2019s turn!\u201dHaving said that, she waved her sleeve robe, and her body disappeared into clouds and mist.Cen Baihu scratched his head.\u201cOther than Yiren, who else in the sect is more suitable?\u201d\u2026\u2026Shu Shi looked helpless.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, there\u2019s no use crying over spilled milk.\u201d\u201cWind always harms the outstanding tree among a forest. I just want to flourish without attracting attention!\u201d 1After this incident, the news that he was a Holy-grade perfect talent would spread throughout the Netherworld.He would then become the focus of all power, and it would be difficult for him not to attract attention when moving.Hearing the sound in his ears and seeing the crowd around him, Shu Shi frowned slightly and was annoyed for no reason.At that moment, Cen Yiren came from a distance.\u201cWhat are you all doing here? Have you never seen a man before?\u201dSeeing this fierce Senior Sister, the crowd retreated and dared not speak.The scene instantly became deathly quiet.\u201cNow that Soul Jade Perception has been damaged, the Talent Testing Event is temporarily suspended until further notice.\u201d\u201cYou all have half a breath to quickly disappear from my presence.\u201d\u201cScram!\u201dCen Yiren placed her hands on her waist in an imposing manner.The crowd did not dare to stay, and they soon disappeared without a trace.Only the two of them remained in the empty valley.Shu Shi smiled, \u201cMany thanks to Senior Sister Cen for helping me alleviate this situation.\u201d\u201cI was just annoyed with them, helping you? Don\u2019t be silly.\u201dCen Yiren snorted coldly and turned to leave.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi shook his head.It was then that the system notifications appeared in his head.[Cen Yiren undergoes an inner transformation, affecting the next plot trend, gaining 5 plot points].[Yun Qiluo made a big decision, affecting the next plot trend, gaining 20 plot points].[Increased Netherworld Rakshasa Sect prestige, affecting the next plot trend, gaining 10 plot points.]Shu Shi: \u201cHoly cow!\u201d1. It means to say, that public opinion always finds fault with big names.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 \u2013 Heavenly Sutra, Yun Qiluo\u2019s Sorrow.Listening to the successive beeps in his ears, Shu Shi could not help but freeze.\u201cWith so many beeps I wonder how many plot points are gained?\u201dThe Netherworld Rakshasa Sect\u2019s reputation was increasing.This was understandable.After all, he was displaying his talent in public, and that was unprecedented Holy-grade perfect.Coupled with the success of the previous operation in the Southwest Region, it was inevitable that people would be in an uproar.Not to mention in the Underworld.In a matter of days, Shu Shi\u2019s name would be heard throughout the Nine Regions!As for the \u201cbig decision\u201d made by Yun Qiluo, supposedly she wanted to make him the main heir.This would indeed have a huge impact on the storyline.It made sense that twenty plot points were given.But what he can\u2019t understand the most is \u2026\u2026\u201cCen Yiren underwent an inner transformation?\u201dShu Shi cupped his chin and frowned, \u201cThat cruel she-bear also changed?\u201dThinking about how Cen Yiren acted just now, it seemed like she was not the same as before.Although still loud-mouthed, she did help him.Shu Shi shook his head and thought no more about it.Focusing his attention on the system panel.[Host: Shu Shi][Status: Full of Qi and blood, refreshed][Talent: Holy-grade Perfect][Cultivation Base: Early Stage of Golden Elixir Realm][Cultivation Method: The Breathing Technique of Netherworld (Great Success), Netherworld Divine Cultivation (Small Success)][Plot Point: 101]Although he was already mentally prepared, Shu Shi could not help the excitement in his heart when he saw the high three-digit plot points.This time, he had obtained a total of thirty-five points, plus the sixty-six points he had accumulated earlier.That was 101 points!\u201cAmazing!\u201dShu Shi revealed a smile, \u201cSo it seems like showing off this time is not a bad thing?\u201dAlthough it was said that the bird that takes the lead gets shot first.1But what if he is Kun Peng covering the sky?2As long as he grows fast enough and strong enough, then no one can target him!So much plot value, enough to spend on the shop.Opening the shop, there was an assortment of dazzling items.[Illusionary Yin Infinity Method, price: 500 plot points][Nine ghostly demon phase incarnation, price 998 plot points].[Heaven and Earth Yin and Yang Illusionary Heart Sutra, price: 888 plot points].[Heavenly Azure Wind Blade (equipped with Peerless Sword Intent), price: 666 plot points.]3[The Great Wilderness\u2026.]Countless supreme treasures and mystical abilities appeared in front of his eyes.Any one of them spreading out would be enough to make the world go crazy!Shu Shi did not hold back as his eyes darted past.These items, while appealing, are completely beyond his current capabilities.Don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew.4What he needed now was something that could increase his strength quickly.At this moment, Shu Shi noticed an object shining with faint light in the corner.[Heavenly Sutra (recommended), price: 100 plot points].\u201cThe system will still actively promote it?\u201dAfter taking a closer look at the item description.[Heavenly Sutra: Auxiliary merit].[After understanding it, the spiritual energy will run by itself according to the set route, the speed of cultivation depends on the host\u2019s own talent].\u201cRun on its own?\u201dShu Shi\u2019s pupils shrank.He knew what this meant.As long as he understood the Heavenly Sutra, his spiritual power would be able to operate automatically, and his cultivation would continue to improve without the need to meditate and practice.\u201cThen, won\u2019t I not need to cultivate all the time!\u201d\u201cSuch a good item, and it\u2019s only sold for a hundred plot points?\u201dShu Shi smacked his lips for a while.The price was actually quite reasonable.The Heavenly Sutra was merely an auxiliary merit, not directly increasing strength.The exact effect also depended on the Host\u2019s own talent and cultivation method.Except that Shu Shi happened to be a Holy-grade perfect talent and cultivated the Demon Empress\u2019 own Netherworld cultivation method!It was as if it was tailor-made for him!Shu Shi did not hesitate to click purchase.The plot value instantly disappeared, leaving only 1 miserable point.A flash of spiritual light drifted to his eyebrows, and the sky was suddenly illuminated with clouds and shadows between spiritual platforms as mysterious energy flew up to comb his dantian meridians.It was as if the spiritual energy in his body had been given some sort of guidance, traveling automatically along the route of his Netherworld Divine Energy.Shu Shi took out a spiritual stone.The spiritual energy was quickly absorbed and incorporated into the meridians, continuously improving his cultivation.\u201cThis sutra is suitable for lazy people!\u201dShu Shi was extremely satisfied.No matter walking, eating, or even sleeping, he would continue to cultivate automatically, there was no need for him to do it all himself.Free your hands and enjoy life!\u201cPerfect!\u201dJust then, a voice transmission from Yun Qiluo suddenly sounded in his ears:\u201cShu Shi, come to Rakshasa Palace.\u201dShu Shi\u2019s smile froze and he bowed his head, \u201cYes.\u201dHe was so excited now that he almost forgot about it.The Demon Empress had summoned him, most likely for the position of Chief Disciple.Chief Disciple meant high status, and almost unlimited resources.But at the same time, he would also be bound to the chariot of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect becoming a thorn in the side of another power!\u201cSikong Lanyue, Feng Chaoge, Chen Wangchuan \u2026\u2026\u201dIt was not a good thing for him to venture into the eyes of these great powers now that his wings had yet to flap.Besides, accompanying a sovereign was like accompanying a tiger.The Demon Empress\u2019 personality and temperament were too elusive.Although she treats him well now, no one knows what will happen in the future.Moreover, in front of Yun Qiluo, he feels exposed, as if she can see all his secrets.\u201cI know that I shouldn\u2019t have treated her to sweet gourds back then.\u201dShu Shi muttered in his heart.\u2026\u2026Rakshasa Demon Palace.Yun Qiluo sat on the phoenix chair, looking at Shu Shi who stood with his hands dangling in front of him.\u201cYou have proven yourself, I believe that after today, there will be no more opposition in the sect.\u201dHoly-grade perfect.If this kind of talent could not become the chief disciple, then there was no one else in the world who had this qualification.Shu Shi bowed his head and said, \u201cYour Majesty, please think twice, this subordinate\u2019s ability is very little and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not qualified to be Chief Disciple.\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s phoenix eyes narrowed slightly, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to follow me?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty has misunderstood.\u201dShu Shi shook his head, \u201cThis subordinate only wants to become a minor commander and open up territory for Your Majesty on the frontlines.\u201dThe air became silent.After a long time passed, Yun Qiluo\u2019s low voice sounded.\u201cYou said that mountains and seas cannot be leveled, but now that you have stepped on them, why do you still not dare to approach me?\u201dShu Shi froze for a moment and raised his head to look.He only saw that the Demon Empress who had lived to kill, was gently biting her lips at this time, and there seemed to be a watery mist covering her bright eyes.There seems to be a faint hint of \u2026\u2026Sadness?\u2026\u20261. The person in the limelight bears the brunt of attack.The figuratively means the person who takes the lead or who is outstanding in the field is more likely to be targeted at or attacked upon.2.3.

The aura in the air changed in an instant. Qingfeng was emanating surges of green glow. The Qingfeng sword was originally the ancient divine sword. It\u2019s said that it\u2019s very efficient to slay ghosts. When the sword struck, it brought with it a powerful airflow.4.

    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 \u2013 Yun Qiluo\u2019s beauty trap!Shu Shi stared blankly at Yun Qiluo.How could this ruthless and cold-blooded Demon Empress reveal the appearance of a little girl?He had to admit that Yun Qiluo was truly beautiful.Her black hair and smooth skin were like jade, her arched eyebrows were like mountains from a distance, and her eyes were like thin clouds covering the moon.The plain dress could not cover her graceful figure, and the white wrists and neck she occasionally showed were whiter and smoother than frost and snow.She looked like someone from a painting.Although Shu Shi had seen many beauties, he was still very amazed by this beauty.\u201cAt first, in order to protect you, I could only let you go to the Southwest Region as a free commander.\u201d\u201cNow that you have such outstanding talent, I will remove all obstacles and let you become the main heir with a noble status.\u201dYun Qiluo looked at him steadily, \u201cOut of a hundred steps, I have taken ninety-nine, why are you still unwilling to take the last step?\u201dShu Shi swallowed.Why did this sound like a confession?\u201cDon\u2019t forget, you yourself said that you would protect me from the start.\u201d\u201cThose were just childish words in the past\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I took it seriously.\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s cherry lips pouted slightly, seemingly somewhat stubborn and dissatisfied.Shu Shi\u2019s heart beat faster for a while.What was up with the Demon Empress today?Without her usual oppressive dominance, she was like a heartbroken girl!Calm down!The woman in front of me is unmistakably the ruthless Netherworld Demon Empress!Shu Shi secretly pinched himself.Yun Qiluo got up and walked towards him, the hem of her dress was full of fragrance.\u201cAs long as you are willing to become the Chief Disciple, you will stand above everyone and have unlimited resources for cultivation.\u201d\u201cIf everything goes well, the entire Netherworld Rakshasa Sect will be yours in the future.\u201d\u201cWealth, status, women, there is nothing in this world that you cannot obtain.\u201dHer voice seemed to have an alluring charm.Looking at the worldly beauty nearby, Shu Shi timidly said, \u201cIncluding Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dYun Qiluo was silent for a moment, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dShu Shi\u2019s eyes were deep as he said, \u201cSince the entire Netherworld Rakshasa Sect belongs to me, it naturally includes Your Majesty as well?\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s heart was pounding!A faint blush crept across her cheeks, like a charming afternoon sunset in the sky.She had not expected the other party to dare to say such a dangerous thing.But strangely, there was no anger in her heart, but rather panic and embarrassment.\u201cYou, you want me?\u201d\u201cEveryone has a love for beauty, and isn\u2019t it normal for a subordinate to favor Your Majesty who is blessed with great beauty?\u201dShu Shi\u2019s mouth was dry, his thoughts were chaotic, and his words were spoken without thinking at all.Yun Qiluo\u2019s chest rose and fell, her eyes filled with light, \u201cCan you pay the price? Desiring me will probably cost you your life.\u201d\u201cIf I should die beneath a peony flower, I will still be charming as a ghost.\u201d 1Shu Shi gently raised his chin and said in a deep voice, \u201cThis subordinate is willing to die for Your Majesty.\u201dYun Qiluo bit her lip, and there seemed to be mist in her eyes.The two of them were getting closer and closer.Shu Shi could smell the intoxicating fragrance, see his own reflection in her slightly glazed eyes, and even feel Yun Qiluo\u2019s slightly rapid breathing.Something was not right!He found himself in a very wrong situation!Common sense told him that he should stop, but his body was completely out of control, and all he could see was a delicate face like a flower.Just then, the deacon\u2019s voice sounded from outside the door.\u201cYour Majesty, the evening meal is ready.\u201dThe charming atmosphere was instantly broken, and the two flew apart as if they had been shocked by electricity.Shu Shi\u2019s eyes cleared and he stammered, \u201cThis subordinate\u2026 this subordinate got too carried away, I hope Your Majesty forgives me. \u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s pretty face turned red as she pretended to be calm and said, \u201cAlright, go to the dining hall first, I\u2019ll catch up in a moment.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShu Shi fled in despair.Looking at his bewildered back, Yun Qiluo covered her hot cheeks.\u201cI must have gone crazy!\u201dJust now they were almost \u2026\u2026Thinking of those close eyes, she couldn\u2019t wait to find a hole in the ground to hide!\u201cWhat kind of cultivation technique is this!\u201dHe took out an ancient book with five big words \u201cThe Glazed Beautiful Girl Technique\u201d written on the cover.Cen Baihu said that Shu Shi loves beauty, so she planned to try it herself, and in order to confirm the effect, she found this guide in the Book Collection.This cultivation technique has the ability to force the mind, make people stop thinking, deprive them of their common sense and stimulate their deepest instincts.But I didn\u2019t expect that even I would be affected!She had intended to bewitch Shu Shi, but she didn\u2019t want to involve herself!\u201cShu Shi really is a playboy, how dare he be so reckless with me!\u201d\u201cBut, why am I also \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt must be because of him, I\u2019m not that kind of cheap woman!\u201dYun Qiluo stomped her feet in shame and anger.Finally concluding, \u201cIt\u2019s Cen Baihu\u2019s fault!\u201d\u201cSomeone!\u201dThe deacon outside the hall walked in, \u201cThis subordinate is here.\u201dYun Qiluo gritted his teeth and said, \u201cTell West Saint to go to the frontier to suppress the enemy immediately, and don\u2019t let him come back without my order!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe deacon retreated.The redness on Yun Qiluo\u2019s face has not disappeared.She casually wanted to throw away the ancient book, but Shu Shi\u2019s obsessed eyes suddenly appeared in her mind.She hesitated for a moment and quietly put down the ancient book.\u201cThis technique is too evil, and it\u2019s not good to spread it around, so it\u2019s better for me to keep it to myself.\u201d\u2026\u2026In the dining room.Shu Shi sat dumbfounded.Looking at the table full of food and delicacies, he could not whet his appetite.\u201cIn life, all kinds of delusions are testing us all the time, and sometimes a single thought can make people fall into the abyss of desire.\u201d 2Thinking of the scene just now, she looked very bitter.\u201cI\u2019m really trying to kiss the Demon Empress?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that seeking death!\u201d\u201cI have to find a way to escape from here, otherwise everything will be over when she comes here.\u201dBut it was too late, Yun Qiluo walked into the dining room.Her demeanor has returned to its coolness, her indifferent eyes can\u2019t see any emotion.She sat down and fell silent.The atmosphere is very quiet.Shu Shi swallowed and said with difficulty, \u201cYour Majesty, about what just happened \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dYun Qiluo instantly snapped and glared at him in embarrassment, \u201cEat your food!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d1. \u7261\u4e39\u82b1\u4e0b\u6b7b\uff0c\u505a\u9b3c\u4e5f\u98a8\u6d41Literally: If I should die under a peony flower, I will still be charming as a ghost.Note: peony flower is a metaphor for a beautiful woman.Proverb: \u7261\u4e39\u82b1\u4e0b\u6b7b\uff0c\u505a\u9b3c\u4e5f\u98a8\u6d411.)

    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 \u2013 Foreign treasure in Tianqu Mountain, Cen Yiren becomes the guard!The atmosphere was a little awkward as the two sat in silence.Shu Shi bowed his head in contemplation.After regaining his composure, he clearly sensed that something was wrong.Although Yun Qiluo was beautiful, it was not enough to make him lose his mind, but just now his passion seemed to be magnified many times over and he could barely control himself.If he was not interrupted, he would probably pounce on her.What was going on here?Shu Shi could never have imagined that this was a \u201cbeauty trap\u201d prepared by Yun Qiluo especially for him.But in the end, it almost became a fiasco and got herself into trouble.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating?\u201dYun Qiluo broke the silence and asked aloud, \u201cThe food is not to your taste?\u201dShu Shi shook his head, \u201cThis subordinate is not hungry.\u201dThinking of what had just happened, Yun Qiluo\u2019s cheeks brushed a little red, and she said lightly, \u201cGiven that you did it by accident, I won\u2019t blame you.\u201d\u201cRegarding the position of Chief Disciple, you can think about it, there is no need to rush to give me an answer.\u201dShu Shi frowned slightly.Why was she acting as if nothing had happened?This was not like the Netherworld Demon Empress\u2019 temperament he knows.Yun Qiluo glanced at him, \u201cCan we eat in peace now?\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Majesty.\u201dShu Shi moved his chopsticks.Yun Qiluo raised her delicate chin, \u201cI want to eat that.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShu Shi put a piece of mushroom into her bowl.Yun Qiluo bowed her head and finished it off in small bites.\u201cMore.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dGradually, the two cooperated better.Often, with a glance from Yun Qiluo, Shu Shi knew which dish she wanted to eat.And she only ate what Shu Shi helped her to put in her bowl.Before long, the dish was gone.Yun Qiluo took a fragrant handkerchief to wipe the corners of her mouth.\u201cI\u2019m already full.\u201dShu Shi released his chopsticks, \u201cThis subordinate is also full.\u201dYun Qiluo looked at his handsome side face and said, \u201cThere is a golden light that penetrates heaven and earth in the Tianqu Mountain of the Northern Region, there should be supreme treasures coming out, all the great powers have sent their disciples there, so you should go there on behalf of this sect.\u201dNorthern Region? It\u2019s really here!Shu Shi\u2019s eyes flashed.Tianqu Mountain, even if Demon Empress didn\u2019t say anything, he would also go by himself.That golden light is not a supreme treasure, but a signal for the ancient emperor\u2019s inheritance to be opened!Yun Qiluo said, \u201cYou can set off today, choose some good people to take with you.\u201dThen she added, \u201cCome back early so that you can eat with me.\u201d\u201cYes.Shu Shi replied and got up to leave.Looking at his back, Yun Qiluo\u2019s eyes filled with light.After the Talent Testing Event, Shu Shi\u2019s talent that was Holy-grade perfect would be known to the world.Now he was heading to Tianqu Mountain on behalf of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect.At that time, no matter if it was the righteous force or the imperial dynasty, Shu Shi would become the focus of attention, and it no longer mattered what his identity was.Shu Shi, you won\u2019t be able to escape, so you must follow me obediently.Yun Qiluo hooked a smile, as cunning as a little fox.\u201cFeng Zhongque.\u201dSwoosh~A strong wind blew and a crane chirped faintly.A thin man appeared from the air, \u201cThis subordinate is here.\u201dYun Qiluo instructed, \u201cYou go first to Tianqu Mountain and clear the road for Shu Shi, if there is any mistake, I will hold you accountable.\u201dFeng Zhongque nodded, \u201cThis subordinate follows orders.\u201dHis body once again disappeared like the wind.Although the Righteous path and Demonic path would not harm each other\u2019s heirs by default, but after all Shu Shi is someone with Holy-grade perfect talent!Were they willing to let such a genius flourish just like that?Even at the risk of an all-out war, great powers would probably step in to finish him off.At that moment, the servants came in to clear the table.Seeing how there was no food left on the table, she asked, \u201cYour Majesty, will we still prepare your meal tomorrow as usual?\u201dWith the current Demon Empress realm, she had long since given up food and only maintained the habit of eating.But in the past, she used to eat at most once a week, and each time she only ate light meals.How could she eat so much?Yun Qiluo looked at the nearby empty seat and shook her head with no interest, \u201cNo need, I have no appetite, let\u2019s wait until Shu Shi returns.\u201d\u2026\u2026Shu Shi walked out of the Rakshasa Palace.The passing disciples all seemed excited to see him, and the female disciples even had sparkling, excited eyes.He was a hero of the Southwest Region, a genius possessing Holy-grade perfect talent, Your Majesty\u2019s favorite person, and he was so handsome!How could there be such a perfect man in this world?\u201cCommander Shu is so handsome!\u201d\u201cIf I could be his woman \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWake up, did Commander Shu even put you in his sights?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m willing even if it\u2019s one night!\u201dListening to the words of the hungry tigers and wolves around him, Shu Shi could not help but quicken his pace.There was no way this was the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect!This place shouldn\u2019t be so perverted!All roads lead outside the mountain gate.Shu Shi\u2019s thoughts ebbed and flowed.Although the time spent back this time was short, many things had happened.However, what surprised him the most was the Netherworld Demon Empress, Yun Qiluo.In the original plot, Yun Qiluo, as the main villain, was so powerful and overwhelming that she almost turned the Nine Realms Continent upside down!Her personality was cold and brutal, and her hands were extremely bloody and cruel!That was why Shu Shi had always been wary.But Yun Qiluo\u2019s attitude towards him was a little too intimate, and even occasionally let out an attachment-like gaze.This was something that could never be disguised.\u201cCould it be that my actions at a young age have changed her in some unseen way?\u201d\u201cAnd then I did not die, causing the Demon Empress to fail in her fall into darkness?\u201dShu Shi felt that this possibility was strong.Yun Qiluo had issued a Black Killing Order for him, which did not happen in the original plot.\u201cAfter all, she treated me well.\u201dThinking of the Demon Empress\u2019s flushed, bashful, and flirtatious face, Shu Shi felt a tremor in his heart.It was hard to overcome it!\u201cCommander Shu.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dShu Shi stopped in his tracks and looked up.He only saw Cen Baihu standing in front of him at an unexpected time, followed by an unhappy-looking Cen Yiren.Shu Shi clasped his hands, \u201cGreetings, West Saint.\u201d\u201cIs Commander Shu leaving?\u201dCen Baihu looked friendly.Shu Shi didn\u2019t hide anything and said, \u201cThere is a strange movement in Tianqu Mountain, it seems that foreign treasures have come out, Her Majesty has ordered me to go and check it out.\u201dCen Baihu nodded, \u201cSince there are foreign treasures out there, then the imperial dynasty\u2019s righteous force will definitely send their experts as well. And it would be too dangerous for Commander Shu to be alone.\u201dShu Shi said, \u201cI am grateful to Saint for his concern, but I am used to being alone \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHow can you do that?\u201dCen Baihu said correctly, \u201cCommander Shu is a person with Holy-grade perfect talent, the future hope of our sect, there must not be the slightest mistake!\u201d\u201cYiren, I order you to guard Commander Shu strictly and always be on standby!\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dCen Yiren reluctantly replied.\u201c??\u201dThe corners of Shu Shi\u2019s mouth twitched.Letting this violent maniac protect him?What a joke!Shu Shi frowned and said, \u201cSaint Cen, shouldn\u2019t you ask my opinion first?\u201dCen Baihu came up to him and whispered, \u201cI know that Commander Shu is reluctant, but Yiren has made a fuss about going out of the sect to check it out \u2026\u2026With her temper, she will definitely suffer a big loss. Only by following you can I rest assured.\u201dCen Baihu said helplessly, \u201cI really can\u2019t do anything, Her Majesty suddenly sent me to the frontier, I don\u2019t know when and how long it will take to return.\u201d\u201cYou can think of this matter as me owing Commander Shu.\u201d\u201cIf she disobeys, you can teach her a lesson, no need to give me face!\u201dCen Baihu\u2019s heart was like a clear mirror.With Shu Shi\u2019s talent, Her Majesty would definitely organize an expert to protect him.With that Cen Yiren\u2019s safety would not be a problem, and it would be the perfect time for Shu Shi to grind her temper.\u201cBut \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a deal, I\u2019ll buy you a drink when we get back!\u201dBefore Shu Shi could finish his sentence, Cen Baihu flew up and faded away as a shooting star.The two were left staring at each other with wide eyes.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dShu Shi sighed helplessly.Ceng Yiren snorted, \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not like I wanted to follow you, were it not for my father \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSaint has said that you are ready to help me in any situation.\u201d\u201cSo, so what?\u201d\u201cI ordered you to be quiet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 \u2013 Sikong Lanyue\u2019s Decision, Although Chen Qingluan lost but she was still honorable!Land of the Great Clouds.\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201dSikong Lanyue\u2019s voice was surprised, \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s a Holy-grade perfect talent?!\u201dThe gray-robed Daoist standing in front of her replied, \u201cYes I am, back at the Demon Sect Talent Testing Event, where the Soul Jade Perception Stone exploded in front of public and turned into a starburst in the sky, is a symbol of Holy-grade perfect.\u201dSikong Lanyue fell into silence.The clouds around her were like turbulent waves.Holy-grade perfect talent.With her nature, she naturally understood what these four words meant.Perfect and flawless, with the rules of Dao in his mouth, he was born as a son of Dao.Even Zhan Qingchen who is a Super-grade perfect talent would find it hard to look at him.This is a legendary talent, but now it has actually appeared in the world, and it is a person of the Demonic path?\u201cHas that person\u2019s identity been clearly investigated?\u201dSikong Lanyue asked aloud.The gray-robed Daoist replied, \u201cThe investigation is clear, it is none other than Shu Shi who defeated Chen Qingluan a few days ago.\u201dSikong Lanyue was stunned for a moment, \u201cIt was actually him?\u201dShe thought it was a disciple who had just joined the sect, but she never expected it to be a small commander of the Southwest Region!He was actually a Holy-grade perfect talent!\u201cNo wonder the Demon Empress didn\u2019t hesitate to issue the Black Killing Order.\u201dSikong Lanyue\u2019s thoughts turned and sneered, \u201cHiding a genius in the wilderness for ten years, Yun Qiluo\u2019s mind is quite deep.\u201dIn the eyes of the world, although the Demonic path is powerful, it does not have much power behind it.The position of Chief Disciple has been vacant for many years, and there are no top talents like Zhan Qingchen or Chen Qingluan among the younger generation.Everyone thought that as long as the younger generation rose up, the scales of victory would definitely tip in favor of the Righteous path.But to their surprise, this was actually an illusion created by the Demonic path!The super genius that the Demon Empress had secretly cultivated was now at birth!The gray-robed Daoist said in a deep voice, \u201cIf we let Shu Shi grow, I\u2019m afraid there will be endless trouble ahead, we should nip it in the bud before the trouble gets bigger.\u201dSikong Lanyue shook her head, \u201cDemon Empress is not a fool, such a genius must have great experts to protect him, it\u2019s not something we can kill just because we want to.\u201d\u201cEven if we manage to kill him, we will then face the Demon Empress\u2019 terrible anger, Tianji Pavilion is not afraid, but what about the people in this world?\u201dWith Yun Qiluo\u2019s nature, it\u2019s afraid she will turn the Nine Regions into a sea of blood!The gray-robed Daoist frowned, \u201cBut if Shu Shi grows up, he will become the next Demon Emperor in the future, and people will still suffer.\u201dHow could Sikong Lanyue not understand this truth?She hesitated for a long time, and after weighing her options in her heart, she said, \u201cTalent is indeed important in the path of cultivation, but opportunity, heart and effort are also indispensable.\u201d\u201cI believe in Qingchen, she may not be weaker than Shu Shi in the future.\u201dAlthough the gray-robed Daoist was resigned, there was nothing he could do.In his heart, he secretly thought that the Sect Leader was unreasonable!Chief Zhan was indeed a genius, but on the other side was the genius of geniuses!One was at the top of a mountain, the other was in the vast sky!How could it possibly be compared?As the gray-robed Daoist retreated, Sikong Lanyue sighed silently.There was actually another reason she didn\u2019t say.If Shu Shi really laid a hand on her, then there was no way Yun Qiluo would let Zhan Qingchen go!She really didn\u2019t want to risk the life of her beloved disciple.\u201cLet\u2019s hope that I\u2019ve made the right choice \u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026Weiyang Capital.Outside the main gate of the Demon Extermination Division, a green-clothed figure hid behind the wall and inspected the division yard.It was none other than Chen Qingluan.With her speed, she should have returned long ago.It just that, she had been lagging behind and had lost a lot of time on the road.Ever since she set out to fight demons at the age of fourteen, she had not lost a single battle in ten years, and was known as the mythical invincible of the Demon Extermination Division.Now not only did she lose to the unknown Shu Shi, but she was also captured for days \u2026\u2026\u201cThis is so embarrassing!\u201dChen Qingluan covered her forehead, \u201cThey will definitely laugh at me!\u201dShe hesitated outside the door for a long time before finally summoning the courage to tiptoe inside the Censor\u2019s office, close to the wall.But before she could take a few steps, a startled shout rang out behind her.\u201cImperial Censor Chen?!\u201dChen Qingluan moved stiffly and slowly turned around.Only to see a deacon staring at her with an excited expression, \u201cImperial Censor Chen, you\u2019ve returned?\u201dThe corner of Chen Qingluan\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cTsk \u2026. ..\u201d\u201cWhat, Imperial Censor Chen has returned?!\u201d\u201cWhere is it?\u201d\u201cImperial Censor Chen has really returned!\u201dThe crowd, startled by the voice, came into the courtyard and flocked around Chen Qingluan.The atmosphere was noisy and frenzied for a while.This is a great disgrace!Chen Qingluan bowed her head in defeat, ready to face their ridicule.\u201cLord Chen is here!\u201dSomehow someone shouted, and the noisy crowd instantly fell silent.The crowd retreated and parted ways as a middle-aged man with a slightly white beard slowly walked towards her.Chen Wangchuan.Commander of the Demon Extermination Division and Minister in charge of the Emperor\u2019s Escort!\u00a01His Majesty had bestowed upon him the title of \u201cGrand Master\u201d!\u201cFather.\u201dChen Qingluan lowered her head, \u201cI am incapable \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cQingluan, you have done well.\u201dChen Wangchuan patted her shoulder, revealing a friendly smile.Chen Qingluan froze.This father of her had always been iron-faced, although she had been in the Demon Extermination Division for over ten years, she had never heard him praise her even once.Now that she had failed, he was saying that she had done a good job?She asked carefully, \u201cThis siege failed and I also lost \u2026\u2026 Why don\u2019t you criticize me?\u201d\u201cVictory and defeat are common in the military.\u201dChen Wangchuan shook his head, \u201cWhat\u2019s more, you are facing Shu Shi, it is already very good to be able to defend yourself.\u201dChen Qingluan scratched her head, \u201c Huh?\u201d\u201cYou still don\u2019t know? That Demon Shu is a Holy-grade perfect talent, a super genius who has been hidden in the Demonic path for over ten years!\u201dChen Wangchuan praised, \u201cOf those who went to lay siege, only you managed to escape unscathed, as expected of my daughter!\u201d\u201cAs expected of Imperial Censor Chen!\u201dThe crowd echoed.Chen Qingluan\u2019s eyes froze.That depraved kidnapper was actually a Holy-grade perfect talent!Her cheeks burned slightly as she listened to the admiration of the people around her.She knew in her own heart that there was no such thing as escaping unscathed, she was released by Shu Shi \u2026\u2026She had even been carelessly flirted with by that man \u2026\u2026When she thought of the vow she had made, Chen Qingluan\u2019s eyes were filled with confusion.Does this \u2026\u2026 revenge still have a chance to be carried out?\u2026\u2026Southwest Region, Fengsha City.Looking at the sandy and dusty small town in front of him, Cen Yiren couldn\u2019t help but frown.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that we were going to Tianqu Mountain? What\u2019s the point of running to this shitty place?\u201dShu Shi glanced at her, \u201cYou can go home if you don\u2019t want to come.\u201dCen Yiren said angrily, \u201cShu Shi, mind your manners, I\u2019m your Senior Sister! How can you say that?!\u201dShu Shi shrugged, \u201cBut West Saint himself gave his word that you are now only my bodyguard.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d\u201cI command you to be quiet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI order you not to look at me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd not to show off your teeth.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t be silly!\u201d1.\u00a0Luan Yiwei\u00a0(\u92ae\u4eea\u536b )The authority in charge of the emperor and empress\u2019 carriages and ceremonies.Luang Yiwei, headquartered in the southeast corner of the Forbidden City, was the division in charge\u00a0of the emperor and empress\u2019s carriage in the Qing Dynasty, which was set up in the central part of the palace.

    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 \u2013 A world where only Cen Yiren is injured.Looking at Cen Yiren who showed her teeth and claws, Shu Shi snorted coldly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, does Senior Sister Cen want to devour this Master?\u201d\u201cNonsense, you\u2019re not my Master!\u201dCen Yiren\u2019s cheeks turned red and her chest rose and fell.Shu Shi didn\u2019t bother to pay attention to her and walked straight ahead.Seeing his back, Cen Yiren wanted to turn her head and walk away, but she refrained herself from doing that.Although she was upset in her heart, she had to admit that Shu Shi, a Holy-grade perfect genius, was the hope of the entire sect.She had to ensure that this man did not get hurt.\u201cThis is for Her Majesty\u2019s sake.\u201dCen Yiren breathed deeply, her large chest almost bursting through her shirt.\u201cBesides, if I really go back, I will instead follow this man\u2019s wishes.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t he just trying to piss me off? The angrier he gets, the more I\u2019ll follow him and see what he can do to me!\u201dCen Yiren stomped her foot and lifted her leg to follow him.The two of them walked down the street.The pedestrians avoided Shu Shi when they saw him, their eyes full of admiration.It was still some time before the Tianqu Mountain inheritance was opened, and now the signal was just beginning to be released.Fengsha\u2019s direction happened to be along the way, so he returned to see how the Bai Qing girl was doing in her cultivation.He soon arrived at the commander\u2019s residence.Shu Shi had just pushed open the door and happened to bump into Bai Qing.\u201cMaster?\u201dBai Qing froze for a moment, then cheerfully jumped into his arms and hung onto him like an octopus.\u201cMaster, you\u2019re finally back!\u201dShu Shi said with a smile, \u201cHave you been cultivating seriously in my absence recently?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dBai Qing nodded her head forcefully, \u201cQing\u2019er has been cultivating seriously!\u201dShu Shi released his spiritual energy to probe her meridians.Her Qi was firm, her roots were solid, she had already touched the late stage of Qi cultivation, and it was estimated that it wouldn\u2019t be long before she could successfully build her foundation.Even if she was exceptionally talented, she would never reach this level if she didn\u2019t work hard.Shu Shi rubbed her little head and nodded, \u201cYou\u2019re doing well.\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u201dBai Qing smiled brightly.\u201cI must say\u2013\u201dOn one side, Cen Yiren frowned, \u201cYou two are too much, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cOh my!\u201dOnly then did Bai Qing realize that there was another person there.Hastily hiding behind Shu Shi, her face looked like a red apple as she timidly asked, \u201cMaster, this girl is \u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi casually said, \u201cShe is my bodyguard.\u201d\u201cBodyguard?\u201dBai Qing tilted her little head.This bodyguard is too buxom, isn\u2019t she?Looking at Cen Yiren and then down at herself, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little inferior.Cen Yiren glared at Shu Shi, \u201cI wonder why you had to return to Fengsha City, so it was to meet your little sweetheart? \u201dBai Qing\u2019s pretty face flushed as she stammered, \u201cI\u2019m, I\u2019m his maid! I\u2019m not his little sweetheart!\u201d\u201cHumph, do you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201dCen Yiren sneered.What kind of maid could be so close to her master?At that moment, Bai Qing remembered something and said, \u201cBy the way, master, you have a friend who has been waiting for you.\u201dShu Shi frowned, \u201cA friend?\u201dBai Qing turned around and shouted in a smooth voice, \u201cSister Zhaozhao, Master is back!\u201d\u201cZhaozhao?\u201dShu Shi\u2019s body shook as he jerked his head up to look.He only saw a white moon figure standing at the entrance of the room, looking at him with fascination, wanting to move her feet, but seeming to be a little shy.\u201cZhan, Zhan Qingchen! It\u2019s Zhan Qingchen!\u201dCen Yiren\u2019s face was pale as she pointed towards the white-clothed female cultivator, \u201cTianji Pavilion is here, prepare\u2026\u201dSnap!Shu Shi cut her neck with a hand slash.Spiritual power instantly blocked all five senses, and Cen Yiren\u2019s body went limp and lost consciousness.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Senior Sister Cen.\u201dShu Shi reached out a hand to hold on with a somewhat regretful expression and gently placed her on the ground.Bai Qing looked stunned.What is this?Why did master make his bodyguard faint?Before she could regain her sense, the next scene made her pupils flutter.Only to see Shu Shi stepping up to Zhan Qingchen.The two stared at each other for a moment, then hugged each other tightly!\u201cThis this this this this \u2026\u2026\u201dBai Qing\u2019s mind was already spinning.Shu Shi gathered the beautiful woman in his arms, gently stroked the long brocade hair, and said in a soft voice, \u201cZhaoge, I didn\u2019t expect you to come.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s face flushed, she shyly whispered, \u201cI happened to pass by the Southwest Region, so I just stopped by to have a look.\u201dAlthough she said so, her hand was clung to her man arms, not wanting to part for a moment.\u201cZhaozhao.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI missed you so much.\u201d\u201cI, I miss you too.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s beautiful face was buried in Shu Shi\u2019s shoulder, smelling that longed-for fragrance, and her mind, which could not calm down, finally calmed down.In her heart, she secretly thought.Master said that the love between men and women is poison, but I think it should be the antidote. \u2026\u2026Suddenly, she felt something and hee body stiffened abruptly.\u201cPerv, pervert! Where do you think you put your hand!?\u201dShu Shi put his hands back on his waist and smiled sarcastically, \u201cThe clothes are too slippery, the clothes are too slippery.\u201dZhan Qingchen glared at him in anger, \u201cScrew you!\u201d\u2026\u2026The two of them made out for a while before they separated.Looking at the unconscious Cen Yiren on the ground, Shu Shi frowned, \u201cThis is trouble.\u201dZhan Qingchen said curiously, \u201cWho is she?\u201dShu Shi said helplessly, \u201cCen Yiren, the daughter of West Saint Cen Baihu.\u201d\u201cCen Baihu?!\u201dZhan Qingchen drew a cold breath back.Under the throne of the Demon Empress, there are four Saints from the North, South, East and West. They are Yu Jiaolong, Wu Xuanming, Cen Baihu and Feng Zhongque respectively.Each of them was a Demonic path\u2019s behemoth with supreme strength!Among them, Cen Baihu was known for his ferocity and tyranny.When Cen Baihu was in the sky, there would be endless disasters!This girl was actually the daughter of that ferocious Demon!Zhan Qingchen realized what was going on and her face suddenly paled, \u201cShu Shi, have I caused you any trouble?\u201dIf the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect knew about their relationship, Shu Shi would definitely be in big trouble!\u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t think too much about it.\u201dShu Shi pinched her small face and said with a smile, \u201cLeave it to me to solve it.\u201dZhan Qingchen said uneasily, \u201cThen what can I do?\u201d\u201cAll you have to do is accompany me.\u201dShu Shi grabbed her waist and strode towards the room without looking back, \u201cQing\u2019er, take bodyguard sister to the living room.\u201dHe had used his spiritual power to block Ceng Yi Ren\u2019s meridians, so she definitely wouldn\u2019t wake up in a few hours.\u201cYes.\u201dBai Qing replied and carried Cen Yiren on her back.She was already at the Qi Practitioner realm, and her strength was unknown how many times greater than before, so carrying a woman on her back was not a problem at all.Feeling the tenderness behind her, Bai Qing\u2019s eyes were slightly envious.\u201cI wonder what this bodyguard sister was eating?\u201d\u201cHmph, Sister Zhaozhao lied by saying that she was a friend of master, the two of them obviously have a special relationship!\u201d\u201cMaster, you liar!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 \u2013 Zhan Qingchen was \u201cbeaten back\u201d and then escaped, it was a fierce battle!In the room.Shu Shi leaned on Zhan Qingchen\u2019s lap, their eyes met, and the air was filled with a touch of warmth.Thinking of the loving tenderness just now, Zhan Qingchen\u2019s pretty face flushed slightly.\u201cShu Shi, isn\u2019t it too dangerous for us to do this?\u201dShe asked in a small voice.She was a direct disciple of Tianji Pavilion, and after growing up under the influence of her Master, deep down she was very disgusted with the love of men and women, and even felt disgusted when she saw a man.But Shu Shi was an exception.It was as if she had been struck by a thunderbolt of tribulation, and in front of this man, she could not lift an ounce of energy.This made her panic and at the same time there was a vague feeling of guilt.She seemed to have betrayed her Master\u2019s trust \u2026\u2026\u201cDangerous?\u201dShu Shi smiled, \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything more dangerous though.\u201dZhan Qingchen looked at him blankly and frowned, \u201cBastard.\u201dThere was a slight tension in her heart.If this man really played this kind of idea, she was worried that there was nothing she could do to resist\u2026.Shu Shi saw through what she was thinking, shook his head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know what\u2019s your thinking, and I won\u2019t do things that are excessive.\u201d\u201cYour master has a profound way of doing things. If she were to find out, it would not be a good thing for you.\u201dTianji Pavilion was, after all, a Daoist cultivation sect.1And with Sikong Lanyue\u2019s character, if she found out about the relationship between the two of them, besides, Zhan Qingchen would definitely not be able to become the main heir.When Zhan Qingchen saw that he was thinking of her, she was touched and at the same time apologized slightly.\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t \u2026\u2026 now.\u201dBefore she could finish her words, her cherry lips were blocked by her fingers.Shu Shi said, \u201cNo need to apologize, I\u2019m not in too much of a hurry, besides, you are my woman, sooner or later we will eventually be able to be together.\u201d\u201cHumph, who do you call your woman?\u201dZhan Qingchen hummed softly, but her eyes were full of laughter.At that moment, she remembered something and asked, \u201cBy the way, do you know where Chen Qingluan is?\u201dShu Shi shrugged, \u201cI let her go a long time ago, so she should have already returned.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dZhan Qingchen breathed a sigh of relief.Shu Shi pinched her snowy face, \u201cThere are treasures in the Northern Region\u2019s Tianqu Mountain, so you should also go there, you should get something.\u201d\u201cOh. \u201dZhan Qingchen didn\u2019t ask more questions and nodded her head obediently.Shu Shi sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity we can\u2019t travel together.\u201dWith Cen Yiren as a bodyguard, they could only go their separate ways.Zhan Qingchen gave her a quick peck on the cheek and said with a red face, \u201cI will wait for you at Tianqu Mountain.\u201dAfter saying that, she was about to get up and leave.As a result, she was pulled back by Shu Shi, \u201cWant to escape?\u201d\u201cIs not that easy!\u201dHalf an hour later.Zhan Qingchen floated above Fengsha City, with an unbroken red halo still on his face.\u201cThis bastard, my mouth is swollen again \u2026\u2026\u201dSwoosh!At this moment, an eagle split the long sky and landed on Zhan Qingchen\u2019s shoulder, holding a jade in its mouth.\u201cIs this a letter from the sect?\u201dZhan Qingchen took the jade, and as its spiritual energy entered into her, the contents naturally appeared in her mind.\u201cTianqu Mountain?\u201d\u201cWhat a coincidence, Master also wants me to go there.\u201dImmediately afterwards, the wind whistled and another eagle flew over.\u201cTwo messages in a row?\u201dZhan Qingchen curiously picked up the jade, and his whole body froze when he saw the contents.The second jade contained only ten words recorded inside.[Shu Shi, Holy-grade perfect talent, avoid him for now!]\u201cHoly, Holy-grade perfect?!\u201d\u2026\u2026Guest Room.Cen Yiren opened her eyes in a daze.Looking around her at the unfamiliar surroundings, her eyes quickly regained their clarity and she rolled like a leopard.\u201cShu Shi!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here, don\u2019t shout.\u201dShe heard the voice and looked up, only to see Shu Shi sitting on a chair with his legs crossed.Cen Yiren sighed in relief.It was good that this man was fine.\u201cWhere is Zhan Qingchen?\u201d\u201cI clearly saw her just now, could it be that Tianji Pavilion attacked you?\u201dShu Shi shrugged, \u201cShe was the only one who came, and she was already beaten by me.\u201d\u201cShe was alone?\u201dCen Yiren froze, confused, \u201cHow dare she barge in here alone?\u201dNow that the Soutwest Region was under the control of the Demonic path, the slightest bit of Zhan Qingchen\u2019s existence was revealed, it could lead to disaster.\u201cBy the way, how did you fight her?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 I first attacked her weak points using my hands, then spat pearls into her mouth to mess with her mind, and finally she was beaten back and fled.\u201dCen Yiren nodded, \u201cIt looks like it was a fierce battle.\u201dShu Shi agreed, \u201cIt was very intense.\u201dCen Yiren frowned slightly, \u201cBut how could I faint? At that time, Zhan Qingchen was standing in the distance, so if she was just alone, then who knocked me out?\u201d\u201cCough\u2026. it should have been because of her dao.\u201dShu Shi rubbed his nose awkwardly and looked a little unnatural.\u201cIt should be.\u201dCeng Yiren did not think much of it.Shu Shi breathed a sigh of relief and said, \u201cRest up, and we\u2019ll set out again in the morning.\u201dCeng Yiren hummed, \u201cIt turns out that you still have a bit of a conscience.\u201dShu Shi secretly sighed.Although Cen Yiren was a cruel and brainless maniac, she was indeed a dedicated \u201cbodyguard\u201d who always thought of his safety.Instead, he slapped her unconscious\u2026. \u2026\u2026This made Shu Shi feel vaguely guilty.After thinking about it, he took out a piece of golden marrow and threw it to her.Ceng Yiren was puzzled, \u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201dShu Shi said expressionlessly, \u201cYou are too weak, how can you be a competent bodyguard if you don\u2019t cultivate properly?\u201dAfter saying that, he got up and left.\u201cNonsense, I am not weak!\u201dCen Yiren waved her fist dissatisfiedly.She then looked at the jade in her hand flickering with divine light, her expression slightly puzzled.Golden marrow is an extremely precious cultivation resource.Not only does it reserve several times the spiritual power of high-grade spirit stones, it may also contain fragments of Dao intent.If one could successfully comprehend it, this would be extremely beneficial to one\u2019s cultivation.Even if she was of high status, she would never have too many of these treasures.\u201cHmph, thinking that a piece of golden marrow can buy me?\u201dCeng Yiren had an arrogant face, but the corners of her mouth were slightly curved upwards.\u2026\u2026\u201cReporting to the commander, Chief Zhan has left the Southwest Region, and this subordinate is confident that no one is following her.\u201dWu Mang knelt down on one knee.\u201cGood job.\u201dShu Shi nodded.After all, this was Demonic path territory, and he was worried that Zhan Qingchen might be targeted, so he deliberately asked Wu Mang and Shadows to escort her in the shadows.\u201cTomorrow I will leave for the Northern Region, and I will leave all of Fengsha City\u2019s affairs to you.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWu Mang replied.He hesitated for a moment and asked, \u201cDoes the commander want to take Shadows with you? It would be good to have someone to look after.\u201dShu Shi shook his head, \u201cNo need, let them stay behind to protect Bai Qing.\u201dThe journey to Tianqu Mountain might be dangerous, and five Shadows would not be much help, and he did not want to cause any unnecessary sacrifices.Knock, knock, knock.At this moment, there was a knock on the door of the room and Bai Qing\u2019s voice came, \u201cMaster, Qing\u2019er has come to help you warm up your bed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was a hint of awkwardness in the atmosphere.\u201cThis subordinate will take his leave!\u201dWu Mang quickly walked to the window and turned around.Shu Shi had a black face, \u201cCan\u2019t you take the front door?\u201d1. I wasn\u2019t too sure at first, but their sect is a sect full of Daoist Priests who naturally forbid male-female relationshipsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 \u2013 Take Cen Yiren to visit a brothelThe Linlang Empire\u2019s territory was vast, divided into nine continents.Of these, the three continents south of the Central Plains have been encroached upon by the Demonic path, while the remaining six continents are under the control of the imperial dynasty.The Northern Region, located in the northern part of the Chengtian Continent, contained 18 cities and was a truly fertile and prosperous land.Shu Shi and Cen Yiren flew along the shortest route with little rest, but it took them three days to reach the border of the Northern Region.The size of the Nine Continents was evident.Linfeng City.The two people flew above the night sky, looking at the snow-covered city beneath their feet.\u201cFinally, we\u2019re here.\u201dCen Yiren looked a little tired.Although she had spirit stones to replenish her spirit power and did not lack, she was mentally exhausted after traveling day and night for several days in a row.But the arrogance in her bones made her steel herself and refuse to rest.If Shu Shi could do it, why couldn\u2019t she do it?From the bottom of her heart, she didn\u2019t want to be underestimated by this man.Looking at her pale face, Shu Shi said, \u201cIt\u2019s not far from Tianqu Mountain, and I\u2019m a bit tired, let\u2019s find an inn to settle in first.\u201dCen Yiren breathed a sigh of relief and nodded, \u201cAlright.\u201dNews of the foreign treasures coming out of Tianqu Mountain had spread throughout Nine Regions.The Demonic path, Righteous path, Imperial dynasty, and scattered cultivators all rushed towards the direction of the Northern Region.No one wanted to miss the opportunity, even if it was just a sip of soup.The city was even more crowded, and cultivators with swords and knives could be seen everywhere.They searched all the inns in the city, but not a single room was available.Cen Yiren looked tired.She wanted to take a hot bath and lie down on the bed for a good night\u2019s sleep.But her mouth said, \u201cActually, I\u2019m not that tired, so why don\u2019t we go outside the city and find a secluded place to meditate?\u201dShu Shi ignored her and swept his gaze around.Suddenly, he saw something and said with a smile, \u201cCome on, I\u2019ve found a good place.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dCen Yiren was a little confused.But still, she followed him forward.Seeing the brightly lit, luxurious and beautiful building in front of her, with the sound of laughter and the rich scent of oil and perfume coming from inside, the corner of Cen Yiren\u2019s mouth twitched.\u201cIs this what you call a good place?\u201dIsn\u2019t this a brothel?How dare this man take her to a dirty place like this!?Shu Shi shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a place to rest, not as dirty as you think?\u201d\u201cBut \u2026\u2026\u201dCen Yiren was still hesitant.Shu Shi reached out, \u201c Are you sure you don\u2019t want to come? Then I can come in and rest myself.\u201dCen Yiren said helplessly, \u201cOkay, but we agreed to stay and rest, don\u2019t even think about doing something silly.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not that kind of person.\u201dShu Shi promised with his mouth full.The two of them walked into the Spring Breeze Pavilion.Looking around at the bright and strange scene, Cen Yiren spat darkly.Although she was not afraid of heaven and earth, this was her first time being in such a place.The heavily made-up pimp lady smiled as they entered and said enthusiastically, \u201cHello handsome little brother, you look new here, it\u2019s your first time here, right?\u201dSeeing Cen Yiren at the side, the pimp\u2019s eyes were surprised.Is it normal for someone to bring a girl to a brothel?Shu Shi threw a gold bar and said, \u201cI reserved two rooms upstairs, boil two buckets of hot water, and don\u2019t let anyone disturb us.\u201dCen Yiren breathed a sigh of relief at his words.\u201cNo problem.\u201dThe pimp smiled.Although both were strange and odd, money was the master, and who would have a problem with gold?\u201cCustomers, please go upstairs.\u201dThe pimp guided them towards the stairs.At this moment, on the railing of the first floor, an extraordinary woman noticed Shu Shi and her pupils contracted suddenly!So it\u2019s her!Shu Shi seemed to realize it.He looked up, but only caught a glimpse of her back.\u2026\u2026In the room.Shu Shi sat on his knees, feeling the spiritual power flowing freely within his body.It had to be said that purchasing the Heavenly Sutra was a very wise decision.With twelve hours of uninterrupted cultivation every day, and with the blessing of a Holy-grade perfect talent, the realm increase could be described as a sudden leap forward.Not long after he broke through to the Golden Elixir Realm, his cultivation was now completely solid and he was not far from the Middle Stage of the Golden Elixir Realm.However, to maintain this level of cultivation, relying on the spiritual energy in the air alone was not enough and required the consumption of large amounts of spirit stones.Fortunately, he had a good harvest in Yulin City, enough to sustain him for some time.\u201cSo it seems that being a Chief Disciple isn\u2019t bad, at the very least, I won\u2019t lack spirit stones.\u201dShu Shi cupped his chin and silently pondered.Knock knock knock.At this moment, there was a knock on the door of the room, \u201cMaster, the bath water is ready for you.\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201dThe door to the room was pushed open and two servants walked in carrying a bath bucket, followed by a young girl with a beautiful face.\u201cServant An Hondou, come to your service, Master.\u201dThe woman bowed slightly.The servants smiled and said, \u201cThis is Flower Bath from Spring Breeze Pavilion, have a pleasant evening, Master.\u201dWith that, they retreated.Only the two of them remained in the room.Shu Shi frowned slightly, \u201cI don\u2019t remember ordering a girl.\u201dAn Hongdou blushed slightly and said shyly, \u201cThis servant saw you on the first floor and was attracted to you with just one look, I really couldn\u2019t help it, so I ventured to see you, I hope you won\u2019t be offended.\u201dShu Shi cupped his chin and nodded, \u201cUnderstandable, after all, a man as handsome as me is indeed rare.\u201dAn Hongdou hid her mouth and smiled lightly, her eyes flowing, \u201cYour words are so funny.\u201dShe walked behind Shu Shi, her slender jade hands massaging his shoulders and neck with just the right amount of force.Shu Shi closed his eyes and looked like he was enjoying himself, \u201cLet\u2019s be clear beforehand, I have no money to give you.\u201d\u201cTo be able to spend a night with a handsome man like you, this servant is even willing to pay you back.\u201dAn Hongdou came to his ear, her voice tugging at his heartstrings, \u201cI am a pure Yueji, but I want to comb for you.\u201dA Yueji sells her art, not her body.\u00a01The meaning of \u201ccombing\u201d was the first time a woman in a brothel accepted a guest to sleep with her.She was willing to give herself to Shu Shi.\u201cGood.\u201dShu Shi appreciated, \u201cWhether it\u2019s your breath or tone of voice, the proportions are well mastered, and it seems like you have gone through rigorous training.\u201d\u201cBut you still have two obvious glitches.\u201dAn Hongdou froze at his words and said in confusion, \u201cWhat does master mean?\u201d\u201cYou have hidden your cultivation well, even I didn\u2019t see it at first, but you should never use charm techniques to lure me.\u201d\u201cOther than that.\u201dShu Shi smirked, \u201cThose two servants have stayed at the door, I\u2019m afraid they are waiting for your signal, right?\u201dAn Hongdou\u2019s eyes changed.\u201cDo it!\u201dThe dagger slipped from her palm and stabbed him like lightning!But Shu Shi was even faster, grabbing her soft and boneless wrist with one hand.\u201cThis is a brothel, and you\u2019re talking nonsense by saying you don\u2019t need money?\u201dShu Shi\u2019s smile was ice-cold, \u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid?\u201dCrack!The tendon ruptured and her slender arm was instantly broken!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Cen Yiren\u2019s humiliation, I believe in Su Shi!An Hongdou\u2019s expression changed.Trying to pull away, but it was too late.Shu Shi\u2019s palm gushed with power and her tendons crackled and popped as it was bent to a strange angle!An Hongdou\u2019s arm hung helplessly, and the white bone could still be seen in the blood dripping from it.Shu Shi sighed, \u201cWhat a pity, even though your massage technique is quite good.\u201d\u201cDemon of Demon Sect, die!\u201dHer eyes were full of killing aura as she opened her mouth and bit down on the dagger, stabbing it ferociously!Bang!The door to the room slammed open.Two servants came towards Shu Shi with a low roar.Boom!There was a muffled sound in the air.The three people\u2019s movements halted, the air pressure became unbearably heavy, and they couldn\u2019t move an inch no matter how hard they tried.All that could be seen was their shadows being pulled into silk threads, one end of which was firmly stepped on by Shu Shi.Netherworld Secret Technique, Shadow Binding!Shu Shi frowned slightly, \u201cWho sent you here?\u201dThese people were too weak.If Tianji Pavilion or the Imperial Dynasty wanted to kill him, they would definitely not use such a clumsy way, at least a powerhouse of Nascent Soul Realm should attack to ensure that there would be no mistake in killing him in one blow.But if not them, who else would have a grudge against him?Shu Shi thought of something and asked, \u201cAre you guys from Tianyi Sect?\u201dAn Hongdou\u2019s face turned pale as she gritted her teeth and said, \u201cDemon, you injured my sect\u2019s heir and killed my senior, and now you still dare to come to my door? You have no respect for my sect!\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dShu Shi came to his senses, \u201cSo this is Tianyi Sect\u2019s residence?\u201d\u201cYou still ask?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi was silent for a while.\u201cWho would have thought that the Righteous Sect would also open a brothel?\u201dPlaces like inns, teahouses, and theaters were mixed like dragon among the fishs, suitable for hiding one\u2019s identity and good for prying for information.When he first recovered from his injuries, the Medicinal House, which looked like a theater, was actually the residence of Tianji Pavilion.Come to think of it, it was quite normal for Tianyi Sect to have a brothel.An Hongdou laughed coldly, \u201cI\u2019ve already sent someone to inform my fellow members of Righteous path, they\u2019ll be here soon! You can\u2019t escape, so why don\u2019t you be nice and surrender\u2026.\u201dCrack!An Hongdou\u2019s head was twisted one hundred and eighty degrees.Those fading eyes were still dark with disbelief and confusion.Isn\u2019t this man should holding her as a hostage?Why wasn\u2019t he playing by the rules?Shu Shi shook his head, \u201cI hate it when people threaten me, even if they are pretty.\u201dTo be merciful to your enemies is to be cruel to yourself.Spiritual power gushed out from under his feet, and his shadow instantly spread.The other two servants also died of asphyxiation.Shu Shi sighed helplessly, \u201cI just want to have a good rest, why is it so difficult?\u201dSuddenly, he remembered something and ran out of the room like lightning.\u201cNot good, Cen Yiren might be in danger!\u201d\u2026\u2026The room was steaming with heat.Cen Yiren was soaking in the bathtub, looking very relaxed.The warm water washed away the fatigue and blood returned to her pale cheeks.Fiddling with the flower petals on the surface of the water, she couldn\u2019t help but smile, \u201cThat Shu Shi is quite smart, he can still think of coming to a brothel to rest.\u201d\u201cBut looking at his relaxed appearance, he must often come to dirty places like this.\u201d\u201cHmph, none of the men are really nice.\u201dJust as she was thinking, the door to the room slammed open and a figure rushed in.\u201cSister Cen, I\u2019m here to save you!\u201d\u201cWho is it?\u201dCeng Yiren subconsciously stood up.The two people met each other with four eyes.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dA high-decibel shout resounded in the Spring Breeze Pavilion.Shu Shi\u2019s eyes froze and his voice stuttered \u201c I, I didn\u2019t know you were taking a bath \u2026\u2026\u201dCeng Yiren took a bath towel and blocked it in front of her body, and said with embarrassment and anger, \u201cDon\u2019t look, quickly turn around!\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dShu Shi turned around, still a little dizzy in front of his eyes.This is too dangerous!This is too dangerous, shameful and humiliating!\u201cBastard, I will kill you!\u201dCeng Yiren had just finished dressing when she pounced like a little leopard and bit Shu Shi\u2019s arm fiercely.Shu Shi\u2019s face turned green.\u201cSenior Sister Cen, I\u2019m here to save you!\u201d\u201cYou want to save me from taking a bath? Do you think I\u2019ll drown to death?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 This is Tianyi Sect\u2019s residence, someone just came to kill me!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201dCeng Yiren continued to bite him hard and refused to let go.Shu Shi knew that he was wrong and didn\u2019t want to use his spiritual power to hurt her, so the two of them just froze in a deadlock.At that moment, there was the sound of messy footsteps outside the door.\u201cThat demon Shu Shi is here!\u201d\u201cSearch room by room!\u201d\u201cBe careful, he has accomplices!\u201dBefore the two of them could react, a group of people had rushed into the room.Chen Qingluan, who was dressed in green, was among them.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing the strange appearance of the two people, the crowd of people stared wide-eyed and the atmosphere was silent and a little awkward.Chen Qingluan\u2019s eyes trembled slightly, \u201cYou both are really\u2026..\u201dShu Shi patted Ceng Yiren, \u201cLet me go, people are coming.\u201dCen Yiren let off him and reached out to wipe her mouth, her cheeks slightly flushed.Chen Qingluan\u2019s eyes were downcast, her emotions inexplicable.A bearded old man pointed at Shu Shi and said angrily, \u201cShu Shi, did Hongdou die in your hands?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dShu Shi did not deny it.Chen Qingluan\u2019s body trembled slightly.\u201cDemon, you will pay with your life!\u201dThe aura of the long-bearded old man erupted, and the crowd behind him lit up with their Daoist aura.Shu Shi\u2019s face did not change as he sneered, \u201cTry touching me? Believe it or not, if I die here, the entire Tianyi Sect will be wiped out and their bones will become like mountains!\u201dThe bearded old man was trembling with anger, but his expression was clearly hesitant.Shu Shi was a super genius of the Demonic path.If he killed him in public, the Demon Empress would definitely not rest in peace.When they thought of that existence, which had destroyed the Nine Regions region, those people were a little scared.Although Tianyi had a deep grudge with Demonic path, it didn\u2019t mean that they were willing to endure Demon Empress\u2019s wrath.\u201cImperial Censor Chen, Shu Shi dared to commit murder in the city, you must give a statement on this matter!\u201dThe bearded old man threw a hot potato at Chen Qingluan.Linfeng City was under the control of the Imperial dynasty, and as the Censor of the Imperial Demon Extermination Division, Chen Qingluan was naturally obliged to maintain law and order in the city.Chen Qingluan lowered her head.She had just arrived in Linfeng City when she heard the news of Shu Shi\u2019s appearance and rushed over without thinking.She did not expect that when they met again, there would be a scene like this.\u201cShu Shi, why are you killing people in the city?\u201dChen Qingluan asked in a low voice.Shu Shi said indifferently, \u201cAn Hongdou wants to kill me, should I just keep stand still?\u201d\u201cLiar!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re clearly coveting Hongdou\u2019s beauty!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s after Senior An, but she\u2019d rather die than follow his will, so this Demon got angry and killed her!\u201d\u201cThat makes sense, after all he is a demon!\u201d\u201cPoor Senior Sister An.\u201dThe crowd spoke accusingly.They even made up explanations to make it make sense!All of them present were Righteous people, so who would believe what a Demon said?The bearded old man laughed coldly and said, \u201cYou said Hongdou wanted to kill you, do you have any proof?\u201dFaced with a thousand accusations, Shu Shi looked indifferent, \u201cThere is no evidence, it\u2019s up to you to believe it or not.\u201d\u201cOf course I don\u2019t believe it \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI believe it.\u201dAmidst everyone\u2019s astonished gazes, Chen Qingluan raised her voice, \u201cI believe what Shu Shi said.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 \u2013 Chen Qingluan\u2019s Choice!There was a dead silence in the room.The crowd\u2019s expressions were dumbfounded, and even Shu Shi froze.\u201cImperial Censor Chen, what did you say?\u201dThe bearded old man guessed that he had misheard.Chen Qingluan said word for word, \u201cI said, I believe what Shu Shi said.\u201dThe bearded old man frowned and said, \u201cImperial Censor Chen, Shu Shi is a member of the Demonic path, have you thought about the consequences of saying that?\u201dChen Qingluan glanced at him, \u201cAre you threatening me?\u201dThe bearded old man\u2019s breath caught and his face turned red.He never expected that Chen Qingluan would side with Shu Shi!And with such a strong attitude!Although Tianyi was not bad, it was only a first-class sect, and there was still a huge gap compared to behemoths like the Demon Extermination Division.They couldn\u2019t afford to offend the Demon Empress, but they couldn\u2019t afford to offend the Demon Extermination Division either.\u201cThen Imperial Censor Chen has to give us a reason, right?\u201dThe bearded old man gritted his teeth and said, \u201cI can\u2019t accept if my sect\u2019s disciples die in vain!\u201d\u201cThe Demon Extermination Division will investigate this matter clearly.\u201dChen Qingluan said, \u201cAn Hongdou just died, and you all arrived in afterwards, so obviously someone had passed on the news beforehand.\u201d\u201cCall the person who sent the message, and find out what An Hongdou actually said.\u201dThe bearded old man\u2019s face changed and he said, somewhat unnaturally, \u201cIt seems to be a little servant, and I no longer know where he went.\u201dHongdou had indeed asked someone to report the message.The content was simple.Shu Shi is here, kill him for revenge!When the old man received the news, he rushed here, not to kill Shu Shi, but to stop An Hong Dou!Even if Shu Shi had to die, he must not die in the Tianyi residence!Unfortunately, he was a step too late.Chen Qingluan\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly, \u201cIn this Linfeng City there is not a single case that the Demon Extermination Division cannot investigate, so don\u2019t forget the Holy Emperor\u2019s command.\u201dThe Holy Emperor has decreed that all people are equal under the empire, and fighting is prohibited within the city.Anyone who makes trouble will be considered an enemy of the Imperial Dynasty.When the foreign treasures are opened in Tianqu Mountain, either the Righteous people or the Demonic people will all gather here, and disputes are very likely to occur.In order to protect the people of the city, the Imperial Dynasty must remain neutral.This long-bearded old man naturally understood what was at stake.If this matter was truly pursued to the end, Shu Shi would not fear the Demon Extermination Division, but the Tianyi residence would definitely not be defended.\u201cBack in Yulin City, Imperial Censor Chen lost to this demon, why are you now speaking for him?\u201dThe long-bearded old man sneered.The crowd was also whispering.It was obvious that they all suspected that she and Shu Shi had some sort of ulterior motive.Chen Qingluan\u2019s face did not change and her voice was clear and cold, \u201cThat is my business, so you all don\u2019t need to know, but if someone dares to cause trouble in the city \u2026\u2026\u201dShe pushed her thumb lightly, revealing the sword blade, the sword qi raging like a shocking wave, \u201cDon\u2019t blame me if I\u2019m not being polite.\u201dThe crowd averted their eyes, not daring to meet her gaze.The bearded old man thought twice and said with hatred, \u201cShu Shi, this isn\u2019t over yet!\u201dWith that, he turned to leave.Shu Shi said indifferently, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to clean my room, I paid for this.\u201dThe bearded old man stopped, stomped his feet angrily and walked out of the room with large strides.With the elder gone, the crowd naturally did not dare to linger.Before long, the three of them were left in the room.Chen Qingluan said, \u201cThat old man is a guest from Tianyi Sect, his strength has reached the Late Stage of Nascent Soul Realm, so you\u2019d better be careful.\u201dShu Shi shook his head, \u201cActually, you don\u2019t need to, this will only make people suspect you of colluding with the Demonic path.\u201dChen Qingluan said indifferently, \u201cMy stance has been clear from the start, I have a clear conscience, what do I care about what others say?\u201dShu Shi smiled and said, \u201cThen why do you trust me?\u201dChen Qingluan was speechless.Just now, when she saw the way Shu Shi faced the accusations of the crowd but did not stand up for himself, she instinctively wanted to defend him.\u201cAlthough you were h*rny, you didn\u2019t kill in doing so. And An Hongdou is not good enough for you to do violence to her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi laughed bitterly, \u201cHow am I h*rny?\u201dChen Qingluan glanced at Cen Yiren and said coldly, \u201cYou know very well in your own heart, continue your SM activities with that Big Bear Sister.\u201d 1She said and walked out of the room shaking her shawl.Cen Yiren was so angry that she rolled up her sleeves and shouted, \u201cWhat are you two talking about? Who is she calling Big Bear Sister?\u201dShu Shi rubbed his temple.It seemed that he could not get rid of the lustful man label.Cen Yiren grabbed his shoulders and looked at him with a suspicious expression, \u201cWhat exactly is your relationship with Chen Qingluan? Why did she not even care about her own position for you?\u201dChen Qingluan was the imperial censor of the Demon Extermination Division and was known to be cynical and ruthless.Even if Shu Shi had more reasons, the fact that he had killed three people was an indisputable fact, but she left it at that?If he said there was no suspicious relationship between the two, she wouldn\u2019t believe him.Shu Shi said earnestly, \u201cI guess she was impressed by my sincerity.\u201d\u201cSincerity? There is no one more evil in this world than you!\u201dThinking of what had just happened, Cen Yiren gritted her teeth angrily.She had actually been seen through by this man!Shu Shi scratched his head, \u201cIt was an emergency, and I didn\u2019t know you were in the bath \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYour eyes are still staring so wide then!\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t see them if I don\u2019t open my eyes wide!\u201d\u201cI, I\u2019ll bite you to death!\u201d\u2026\u2026Next day.Tianqu Mountain.At the foot of the mountain, a crowd of cultivators gathered here.The crowd was divided into two camps, with the Righteous people on one side and the Demonic people on the other; the two groups were clearly separated.There were also scattered small groups of cultivators, all of whom had chosen to side with the Righteous path as well.\u201cI heard that this time Tianji Pavilion is also coming?\u201d\u201cOf course, the Land of the Great Clouds is not far from here, so there\u2019s definitely no reason to miss the opportunity.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s Fairy Zhan who comes, with such a prominent heavenly pride sitting here, I believe the demonic path will not dare to move.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I caught a glimpse of Fairy Zhan.\u201d\u201cBut this time, the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect has also come, and it is none other than the genius Holy-grade Perfect Shu Shi!\u201d\u201cHoly-grade perfect? Really!\u201d\u201cThat demon even committed a murder at the Spring Breeze Pavilion last night!\u201dJust as the crowd was discussing, a green-clothed figure swept in from afar.\u201cThis is Imperial Censor Chen!\u201dWithout seeing her appearance, one could tell her identity from her incomparable sword Qi alone.Demon Extermination Division, Chen Qingluan!Chen Qingluan fell from the air and quietly walked to the side, grasping her long sword with the appearance of a figure who should not be approached.The people from the Righteous path looked excited.Although she was from the palace, she was still considered the pride of the Righteous path, and with her presence, the people of the Demonic path would not dare to go wild!Only the faces of the people from Tianyi were slightly different.At this moment, the crowd suddenly moved.\u201cIt\u2019s Fairy Zhan!\u201d\u201cFairy Zhan is here!\u201dA Daoist Priestess wearing a moon-white Daoist robe was seen slowly stepping into the air.Her expression was cool and her eyes were calm, as if the white moon was in the sky.It was none other than Zhan Qingchen.Upon seeing her, Chen Qingluan couldn\u2019t help but smile.\u201cQingchen!\u201d\u201cQingluan? You\u2019re here too!\u201dThe two laughed and hugged, their beautiful and stunning looks reflecting each other so well that even the sunlight seemed to dim by a few degrees.1. Given what Shu Shi did to Chen Qingluan when he kidnapped her, the impression of Shu Shi as an SM is now even stronger and unstoppable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 \u2013 Changes in Tianqu Mountain, Imperial Palace Rules!Zhan Qingchen had never liked to associate with other people.But there were two exceptions: one was her Master, Sikong Lanyue, and the other was Chen Qingluan.The two had known each other since childhood and had similar interests, and were good friends who had nothing to say to each other.By the way, it has now been supplemented with Shu Shi \u2026\u2026Zhan Qingchen smiled and said, \u201cQingluan, I didn\u2019t expect you to come too, I was worried for a long time when I heard you were missing before.\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s pretty face swept a little red as she stammered, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m just taking a little time to recover from my injuries.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dZhan Qingchen secretly sneered and deliberately said, \u201cI heard you lost to that Shu Shi?\u201dChen Qingluan stomped her foot and scolded, \u201cYou, why are you bringing that up now?!\u201d 1Zhan Qingchen shook her head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Shu Shi is a Holy-grade perfect genius, losing to him is not a disgrace, even I \u2026\u2026\u201dThe words suddenly stopped in mid-sentence.Chen Qingluan said curiously, \u201cYou also fought with him?\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes drifted, \u201cSomething like that.\u201dShe almost blurted out\u2026.Chen Qingluan vaguely sensed that something was not right with her best friend.It seemed that there was no longer the cold and lonely feeling of the past, but instead it was replaced by\u2026\u2026Cheerfulness?\u2026\u2026With the arrival of the two geniuses of the Righteous path, their auras had completely overwhelmed the people of the Demonic path.They seemed to be cowering in a corner with indignant expressions.\u201cThose people from the Righteous path are too arrogant!\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, after all, they have two heavenly prides present.\u201d\u201cIt feels like Zhan Qingchen\u2019s aura is even stronger, it\u2019s not like she broke through again, is it?\u201d\u201cWhere are the people from the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect? Why haven\u2019t they come yet?\u201dAt this moment, the sound of breaking air came from the air, and two figures flew down from the air.The noisy crowd instantly became quiet.The eyes of the people of the Righteous path and Demonic path were focused on that person.The legendary Holy-grade perfect talent, the super genius of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, Shu Shi!Naturally, the people of the Demonic path were extremely excited.Although it was said that opportunity was a matter of each individual\u2019s ability, but if the Righteous people and the Imperial Dynasty came together, it was likely that the people of the Demonic path would be cleared first before the competition even began.But with Shu Shi\u2019s appearance, the other side would have to consider their options again.The views of the Righteous people on the other hand were much more complicated.Although his rare talent was terrifying, not many people had seen Shu Shi fight, and no one could get a clear picture of his true strength.Was he really a super genius, or was he just a fake?Shu Shi didn\u2019t care about their gazes.His eyes swept through the crowd and did not find Ye Xiao\u2019s figure.\u201cIt\u2019s true that he\u2019s not there, he should have entered the mountain earlier.\u201dShu Shi drew a cold smile.Cheating was the Son of Heavens\u2019 usual privilege.Cen Yiren pointed not far away and said with an exasperated look on her face, \u201cYour old swordplay buddies are also there.\u201d\u201cOld buddies?\u201dShu Shi froze for a moment, then turned his head to look.He only saw Zhan Qingchen and Chen Qingluan standing together and looking at him calmly.Shu Shi smiled and winked.Zhan Qingchen\u2019s face turned red and she lowered her head nervously,\u00a0\u201cThis bastard, isn\u2019t he afraid of our relationship being discovered!?\u201dChen Qingluan also averted her eyes in panic,\u00a0\u201cThis pervert, he\u2019s too bold!\u201dThe two were so confused that neither of them realized that something was wrong with the other.Buzz~Just then, a soft sound rang through the air.Only to see the golden light blooming behind Tianqu Mountain, a huge light pillar pierced the sky, exuding a strong spiritual light and treasure aura, and it seemed that the voice of the Great Dao could be faintly heard.\u201cSupreme treasure, obviously it is a supreme treasure!\u201dThe crowd breathed heavily, staring at the divine light with fascination.With such an aura, there must be a supreme treasure out there!This was a great opportunity!A golden chariot flashed through the sky, and a majestic voice rang out from the air.\u201cThe Holy Emperor has spoken. Now that the opportunity is here, everyone should rely on their abilities. In case the monsters attack the city, Nascent Soul Realm and above are not to enter the mountain!\u201dThe meaning of these words is clear.As long as they don\u2019t destroy Linfeng City, they can fight to their heart\u2019s content, the imperial palace will not intervene easily.As for the restriction of the realm, it is an old rule.Since Chengtian Continent is within the territory of the imperial dynasty, it doesn\u2019t matter if juniors fight to the death, but if Nascent Soul or stronger forces fight, the damage caused is unpredictable.It is the usual practice of the Imperial Palace to be moderate and relaxed.After the decision was given, the dragon horse whinnied and the carriage rose into the sky.At the same time, the ban on blocking Tianqu Mountain was lifted.The scene was silent for a moment.\u201cGo!\u201d\u201cSeize the opportunity!\u201dThe crowd exploded and swarmed towards Tianqu Mountain, afraid that if they were one step behind the treasure would be snatched away.The foot of the mountain suddenly became empty.Cen Yiren was also a little excited, \u201cShu Shi, let\u2019s quickly follow them!\u201dShu Shi shook his head, \u201cWhy rush? Let them go and clear the path first.\u201dThe ancient emperor\u2019s legacy, was it that easy to seize?\u201cRoar!\u201dA deafening hiss came out, the trees fell to pieces, and the majestic Qi wave pushed hundreds of meters!Ceng Yiren\u2019s face turned white.She had almost forgotten that Tianqu Mountain, where the demonic beasts lay, was one of the most dangerous places in the Northern Region!Shu Shi did not care about them, but walked towards Chen Qingluan and Zhan Qingchen.Only the two of them were left here now.Shu Shi smiled and said, \u201cThis Tianqu Mountain is dangerous and unknown, why don\u2019t we temporarily discard our prejudices and travel together in a group?\u201dChen Qingluan snorted coldly, \u201cWho wants to go with you?\u201dAfter saying that, she broke through the air with her sword and left.Zhan Qingchen hesitated slightly, but seeing Cen Yiren on the side, she still whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s very uncomfortable with outsider around.\u201dShu Shi nodded and took out a jade and handed it to her, \u201cYou and Chen Qingluan will accompany each other, break it if there is any danger.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dZhan Qingchen reached out to take it and scratched it in her palm, blushing as she said, \u201cDemon, you should also be careful.\u201dThen she also rose into the air and chased the green sword light.Ceng Yiren walked over and said curiously, \u201cWhat were you guys talking about just now?\u201dShu Shi glared at her, \u201cShe said you were an unwanted guest!\u201d 2Cen Yiren scratched her head, \u201cHuh?\u201d1. \u54ea\u58f6\u4e0d\u5f00\u63d0\u54ea\u58f6 litteraly means \u201cto pick the kettle that is not boiling\u201d.

Opportunities are not easy to come by, those who rush will have a hard time.\u201dTianqu Mountain was full of ferocious beasts, and those who entered the mountain first would be surrounded by a large number of demonic beasts.Not to mention the fact that there was friction between Righteous people and Demonic people.Roar!Ferocious beast roars resounded throughout the mountains, accompanied by faint wails of misery.Cen Yiren shivered.\u201cThat seems reasonable.\u201dGreat opportunities often came with great risks as well.Since one wanted to go out and grab it, then one must be prepared to die.After a long time, the roar faded away.The wave of beasts should have chased the cultivators towards the interior of the mountain range.\u201cIt\u2019s almost time, let\u2019s go.\u201dShu Shi got up and headed towards Tianqu Mountain.Cen Yiren followed him with the same steps.Although she felt irritated with this man, she had to admit that he was wise and thought things through more thoroughly than she did.But before he could take a few more steps, Shu Shi stopped.Only to see an old man standing not far ahead.His hair was white and his long beard reached his chest, and he was none other than the Palace guest from Tianyi Sect that he had met at Spring Breeze Pavilion.\u201cShu Shi, I\u2019ve been waiting here for a long time.\u201dThe bearded old man rubbed his beard and his smile was ice-cold.Shu Shi frowned slightly, \u201cYou want to kill me?\u201dAt a time like this, the other party\u2019s purpose for appearing here was already quite clear.\u201cHave you thought about the consequences? Can Tianyi Sect bear Her Majesty\u2019s wrath?\u201dThe bearded old man snorted, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to scare me with Demon Empress, besides you obviously died in the mouth of a demonic beast, what does that have to do with my Tianyi Sect?\u201dHoly Emperor suddenly issued a decree that no one cultivators above Nascent Soul Realm should enter the mountain.The old man thought that there was no chance, but it turned out that Shu Shi had procrastinated and delayed entering until now.Now that no one was around, this was the perfect time to kill this demon!\u201cYou go first, I will stop him.\u201dCeng Yiren said in a deep voice, \u201cWhen the fight starts later, you run straight to the mountain, as long as you enter the mountain, you will be safe.\u201dShu Shi frowned, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dCen Yiren took out a large sword and stood in front of him with a fearless expression, \u201cMy mission is to ensure that you are safe and sound. Remember to tell my father so that he can annihilate the entire Tianyi Sect!\u201dShe knew in her heart that this old man was at the Late Stage of Nascent Soul Realm, she couldn\u2019t even block a single move from her opponent.But still, she was willing to die!Shu Shi fell into silence.At this moment, he seemed to understand what the system meant when it said that Cen Yiren had undergone an inner transformation.The old man smiled fiercely, \u201cNo need to rush, neither of you two can escape, today I will take revenge for brother Lin Quan!\u201d\u201cWhen this old man is done killing you two, I will go and take the life of that mongrel Shenxiu!\u201dShu Shi levitated.No wonder this old man had such a strong killing aura.It turned out that it wasn\u2019t for An Hongdou, but for Lin Quan, the Tianyi Sect member who died in Yulin City!Shu Shi looked indifferent, \u201cYou can\u2019t kill me.\u201dThe old man didn\u2019t respond, but his murderous aura could be seen in his eyes, \u201cAlthough you\u2019re a genius that hasn\u2019t been seen in ten thousand years, you\u2019re only at the Early Stage of Golden Elixir Realm, while I\u2019m one realm above you, so it doesn\u2019t take much effort to kill you!\u201dBoom!The old man took a step forward, the boundless curtain of night instantly isolated this place, and the terrifying pressure of a cultivator of the Nascent Soul Realm burst out!He didn\u2019t intend to speak anymore.No matter how genius he is, he must die here today!Shu Shi said with an unhappy face, \u201cI said, have you seen enough of this drama? If you don\u2019t take action soon, I will complain to Her Majesty!\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dThe old man\u2019s brows furrowed and he had a bad feeling in his heart.\u201cScreech!\u201dA sharp screech sounded and the night curtain was instantly engulfed in raging flames!A huge vermilion bird hung in the air, its body blazing with flames, just like the blazing sun in the sky!The bearded old man\u2019s knees became weak and he fell to the ground with a thud!Seeing the divine bird in the air, his body trembled slightly and his eyes were filled with fear.\u201cIs that him?\u201d\u201cUncle Feng!\u201dCen Yiren\u2019s eyes lit up and he waved his hand vigorously in greeting.The vermilion bird shook its wings and transformed into a single slender figure amidst the burning flames.His position was just below after the throne of Demon Empress, South Saint, Feng Zhongque!Feng Zhongque descended from the air and frowned at Shu Shi, \u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d\u201cJust guessing.\u201dShu Shi shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m the sect\u2019s precious treasure, how could Her Majesty not send someone to protect me?\u201dFeng Zhongque was a little helpless.This person is quite intelligent, even though I want to take this opportunity to see his strength \u2026\u2026Shu Shi glanced at the old man, \u201cI said, you can\u2019t kill me, I have someone behind to protect me, do you understand?\u201dThe bearded old man trembled.This man actually had a Saint of the Demonic path personally protecting him?Shu Shi didn\u2019t bother looking at him, \u201cSaint Feng, I\u2019ll trouble you here, the two of us will go to the mountain first.\u201dFeng Zhongque nodded and said, \u201cAlright, I can\u2019t enter Tianqu Mountain, you two take care of yourselves.\u201dThe Holy Emperor\u2019s ban was no joke.The Demon Empress could ignore it, but not Feng Zhongque.As he watched the two enter the mountain, Feng Zhongque looked at the old man and said coldly, \u201cTomorrow, half a day from now, Tianyi Sect will become history.\u201dHalf a day.An indifferent response sounded in the air, \u201cThe Imperial Palace will not interfere, but don\u2019t involve innocent people!\u201dIt was the mysterious voice of the dragon and horse carriage.The old man\u2019s body trembled for a moment, his eyes filled with the ashes of deadly despair.\u201cInnocent?\u201dFeng Zhongque sneered, \u201cNo one in this world is innocent!\u201dWith that, he stepped into the wind and left.Boom!The old man\u2019s body burst into flames all around him and turned into ashes in a miserable wail.A Late Stage of Nascent Soul Realm powerhouse simply disappeared into nothingness.\u201cFool, does he think Shu Shi is that easy to kill?\u201dThe mysterious voice sighed slightly, \u201cTo end the old and new hatreds, Tianyi Sect already touched the red line by provoking the Demon Empress\u2019 wrath instead.\u201d\u2026\u2026Shu Shi and Cen Yiren meandered amongst the dense forest.The beasts outside had all been lured by the cultivators who had entered the mountain first, and the two had an unobstructed journey.Of course, this also meant that the closer they got to the interior, the more dangerous the situation became.As she watched the trees fall and blood splatter around her, she couldn\u2019t help but shiver as she witnessed the hell on earth.Shu said amusedly, \u201cAre you afraid? Didn\u2019t you just have a lot of courage?\u201dCen Yiren gulped, \u201cWho said I was afraid?\u201dAlthough she had a fiery temperament, she rarely left the sect and had never seen such a tragic scene.Shu Shi reached out and rubbed her hair, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will protect you.\u201dCen Yiren\u2019s body stiffened and she glared at him with a red face, \u201cI don\u2019t need your protection! Also, don\u2019t touch my head, I\u2019m not a puppy!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a puppy!\u201d\u00a0But her heart warmed as she said that, and the slight discomfort disappeared.At that moment, a rang sounded in Shu Shi\u2019s ears.[Guest from Tianyi Sect, Wang Mu died, affected the next plot trend, gained 10 plot points].Although Wang Mu was not killed by him, he died because of him, so he would still receive plot points.\u201c Roar!\u201dAt this moment, a hanging white-furred tiger stopped in front of the two of them, its red eyes staring at them deadly, its eyes full of greedy killing intent!Shu Shi was just about to make a move when Cen Yiren had already rushed forward with his broadsword.\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 \u2013 Tianqu Mountain Demon Beast Tide, the unlucky Ye Xiao!With one foot on the corpse of a ferocious tiger and a sword larger than herself on her shoulder, Cen Yiren snorted coldly, \u201cA mere cat, how dare you stand in the way of your grandmother?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShu Shi shook his head.Sure enough, she still the same.\u201cCompared to it, it\u2019s still Senior Sister Cen who is more like a tiger. \u201d\u201cHmph, that\u2019s of course \u2026\u2026 wait, are you insinuating me?\u201dSuddenly, a low, suppressed growl sounded in her ears.\u201cDid you hear that just now?\u201dThe two people looked in the direction of the sound, only to see a dense forest illuminated with intense red light, and a pack of ferocious tigers slowly stepped out of the darkness, their fishy saliva dripping on the ground.Those blood-red eyes were wild with killing intent!Cen Yiren gulped and quietly withdrew her foot from stepping on the tiger\u2019s corpse.\u201cShu Shi, what should we do now?\u201d\u201cWhat else can we do \u2026\u2026 run!\u201dShu Shi lifted Cen Yiren and flew away.\u201cRoar!\u201dThe sound of a roar was deafening, the tigers surged after them like a tidal wave, the trees fell to pieces, raising dust that covered the sky!\u201cAren\u2019t demon tigers solitary? How can they be in a pack !\u201dFeeling a gust of fishy wind behind him, Shu Shi\u2019s brows jumped wildly.It seemed that the demon beasts here had also become less normal due to the influence of the ancient emperor\u2019s legacy.Although the tiger demons weren\u2019t very powerful, The both of them would be overwhelmed if there were too many of them, so there was no need to waste time on them.Shu Shi\u2019s gaze swept around and darted towards the interior of the dense forest.\u2026\u2026A dense forest.A group of people carefully crossed the forest.They were none other than Tianyi Sect disciples.They were dressed in rags and looked tired, and some of them were already covered in the color of blood.The sky above Tianqu Mountain was a forbidden area, with a large number of thunderbirds circling around it, almost every one of them comparable in strength to cultivators from the Golden Elixir Realm.Only the forest was the safest.\u201cThat was close, I was almost caught by that tiger demon.\u201d\u201cThis Tianqu Mountain is truly the most dangerous place in the Northern Region!\u201d\u201cIf only I could travel with Chief Zhan and Imperial Censor Chen.\u201d\u201cImperial Censor Chen? Have you forgotten how she spoke for Shu Shi last night?\u201d\u201cHmph, in my opinion, there must be a hidden connection between her and that demon!\u201d\u201cI also heard that she was actually with Shu Shi during the days she disappeared \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSeriously?\u201dRumble.Just at that moment, the ground suddenly shook violently.They looked back in confusion, only to see smoke and dust rolling in the distance, as if an earthen dragon was sweeping towards the area.\u201cWhat happened? An earthquake?\u201d\u201cIt looks like Shu Shi!\u201dThey only saw Shu Shi with Cen Yiren in his arms, and speeding towards them.They hurriedly took out their weapons and looked on guard.However, Shu Shi didn\u2019t even see them and swept straight past.They couldn\u2019t help but freeze for a moment.This demon didn\u2019t come for them?Just then \u2026\u2026\u201c\u201dRoaar!!!\u201d\u201dOnly to see that within the flying dust, countless tiger demons ran wildly towards this place, with a terrifying aura that made people\u2019s hearts tremble!\u201cDamn it! Run!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a tiger pack!\u201d\u201cThat demon must have done it on purpose!\u201dThe people couldn\u2019t think too hard, turned around and ran with a huff.The loud noise here attracted more demon beasts, which surprisingly gathered into a wave of beasts, and the dense forest was filled with flying chickens and leaping dogs, with bursts of curses.\u2026\u2026Ye Xiao was alone in the forest.In his hand was a compass with a golden needle guiding the way.This was the Spiritual Treasure Demon Seeker Compass, which could sense demonic beasts within a radius of tens of miles.Coincidentally, he had learned that there were foreign treasures coming out of Tianqu Mountain, so he sneaked in before the Imperial Palace closed the mountain, relying on this demon-seeking disk to dodge all the way and surprisingly arrived deep in the dense forest without any bloodshed.\u201cHmph, those guys should have just entered the mountain, right?\u201d\u201cTianqu Mountain is full of crises and beasts, how difficult is it to enter the depths?\u201d\u201cBy the time you guys got here, I had already left with my opportunity!\u201dYe Xiao smiled with satisfaction.He touched the scar on his chest and a trace of cynicism flashed in his eyes.\u201cShu Shi!\u201d\u201cWhen I get this ancient emperor\u2019s inheritance, I will settle things with you properly!\u201dAt the beginning in Yulin City, Shu Shi had left a huge psychological shadow on him.Especially the sword that pierced through his chest, which almost took his life!\u201cHoly-grade perfect genius?\u201d\u201cSo what!\u201d\u201cI am the Son of Dao destined by the heavens, and one day you will be my stepping stone!\u201dJust then, the compass suddenly shook violently, almost slipping out of his hand as the golden needle spun for some time and pointed violently behind him!Ye Xiao frowned, \u201cWhat on earth is going on \u2026\u2026\u201dAt this moment, he heard a thunderous and terrifying roar from behind.His body stiffened and he slowly turned around to look.He saw a group of people running wildly towards him, and behind them, amidst the smoke and dust, countless beasts rushed in like a tidal wave!Snap.The compass fell to the ground.Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes froze and he gulped.\u201cDamn!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been hiding for two days to avoid danger, who attracted the tide of beasts here!\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s eyes turned red as he turned around and scattered his feet, joining the troops fleeing for his life.\u2026\u2026He didn\u2019t know how long it took, but the roar gradually faded away.Shu Shi released his footsteps and a burst of white vapor billowed from his body.As the Heavenly Sutra continued to operate, his spiritual energy seemed endless, and he raged like a bulldozer all the way, arriving deep into the dense forest in just half an hour.\u201cThere are too many beasts in this Tianqu Mountain, luckily I run fast.\u201d\u201cYou, can you drop me off now?\u201dCen Yiren\u2019s faint voice sounded in his ears.\u201cHmm?\u201dShu Shi looked down.Only to see Cen Yiren squeezed in his arms, and his hand \u2026\u2026\u201cCough.\u201dShu Shi\u2019s face turned red and he hurriedly released her, \u201cSorry, the situation is urgent, I didn\u2019t think too much about it, I really didn\u2019t mean to do it this time.\u201dNo wonder she was so easy to grasp all the way!The greater the mass, the greater the pulling force is, Newton didn\u2019t deceive me!Cen Yiren\u2019s legs and feet were slightly limp, her cheeks were red as blood, and he whispered, \u201cIf you dare to do it again, I will cut off your hands!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201dShu Shi scratched his head.She wasn\u2019t angry?That was not like her character.The two of them continued to walk towards the place where the golden light was.Cen Yiren followed him, her head lowered, not knowing what she was thinking.Suddenly, Shu Shi\u2019s footsteps stopped.She almost bumped into him.Dazed, she looked up and saw a huge stone monument not far in front of her, tens of meters high, with dense and mysterious inscriptions engraved on it.The pillar of light that pierced through heaven and earth came from the monument.And in the open space in front of the monument, several figures faced each other.Two of them were dressed in white and one in green.It was none other than Chen Qingluan and Zhan Qingchen!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 \u2013 Who are you to deserve to join me?Zhan Qingchen and Chen Qingluan had a lucky break.Their journey was smooth, as if all the demon beasts had vanished, and they arrived near the stone monument without much effort.However, shortly after arriving, the groups of people from the Demonic path arrived one after another.The atmosphere suddenly became tense.\u201cChief Zhan, we\u2019re all here for an opportunity, no need to fight and kill each other now, right?\u201dA fat monk smiled and said.He was fat and greasy, and although he was wearing robes, he didn\u2019t have the slightest buddhist appearance, but instead reeked of lust and evil.Huanxy Buddha, the Demon Monk Shin Yu!1There were many demon sects of all sizes in the world both small and large. However only the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect was a behemoth so the other sects were not so noticeable.In fact, they were the ones who had really done all the evil things, but had thrown all the dirty water on Demon Empress.Huanxy Buddha was a first-class sect, and its Chief Disciple, Shi Yun, was a Golden Elixir Realm practitioner.He was famous on the Heavenly Pride List of the Demonic path.\u201cYes, it\u2019s better to look for opportunities first.\u201dThe people of the Demonic path echoed their voices, but faintly surrounded them in the center.Now only the two of them have arrived from the Righteous path, although they are the highest heavenly pride, but two hands can\u2019t beat four hands, so it is likely that they will have no chance!If the two of them could be expelled, their chances of getting a opportunity would greatly increase!The people of the Demonic path were extremely excited.Only a slender figure wearing a black veil stood in the corner, watching with cold eyes.Looking at the ugly faces in front of her, Zhan Qingchen frowned slightly, and her cold eyes were full of disgust.She thought Su Shi had already cured her hate for men\u2026She didn\u2019t expect that seeing another man other than Su Shi would even increase her disgust.Chen Qingluan was silent, her thumb slightly above her sword sheath, ready to strike.Shi Yun silently pondered.Although another party were only two people, their strength was extremely strong, and the people of the Demonic path each had their own agenda \u2026\u2026This is an uncertain situation!Just as he was hesitating, he suddenly caught a glimpse of a white figure.\u201cHe\u2019s here too?!\u201d\u201cCommander Su!\u201dLooking at Su Shi who slowly walked in, those people looked overjoyed.He had come!Then everything was a foregone conclusion!Su Shi saw the confrontation and said with a frown \u201cWhat are you guys \u2026\u2026\u201dHe said in a loud voice, \u201cCommander Su has come at the right time, now is the perfect time to take down Zhan Qingchen and Chen Qingluan!\u201d\u201cTake down\u2026 Zhan Qingchen?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dShi Yun said excitedly, \u201cChen Qingluan is your opponent to defeat, while Zhan Qingchen will be left to us to deal with!\u201d\u201cWhile the Righteous path\u2019s main force hasn\u2019t arrived yet, we can kick them out first, and if we join forces, this opportunity will definitely be under our control!\u201d\u201cAnd after that, if Commander Su is interested \u2026\u2026 hehe, with this monk\u2019s skills, even a Daoist Priestess will be obedient and want your embrace!\u201dIf I\u2019m not mistaken, the woman beside Su Shi is also a Golden Elixir Realm practitioner.Now that the situation is confirmed, there\u2019s no need to hesitate!!Shi Yun\u2019s smile grew more and more fierce by the second.However, the next second, his smile froze on his face.The raging sword qi swept towards him like a spinning galaxy, wrapped in a terrifying pressure!Shi Yun was just about to move when he realized that the shadow under his feet had somehow become entangled in the ground, and he was unable to move for a moment!Swish!A breeze seemed to sweep across his neck.The world spun and the hand sank slightly.Looking at the horrified gazes of the people, Shi Yun was still a little confused.What was going on?Then he was plunged into the boundless darkness.The scene was silent.Only to see Shi Yun, who had spoken so highly just a moment ago, standing in place like a statue.What he was holding was his own head!The Green Frost Sword in Su Shi\u2019s hand trembled slightly, the sword slash was so fast that no blood could be seen!Poof.Shi Yun\u2019s corpse fell to the ground.Dead.Killed with a single slash!Like a thunderbolt in broad daylight, the spine of the crowd went cold and they fell into fear!A Golden Elixir Realm practitioner had died just like that?\u201cShu, Commander Su, what are you doing? Shi Yun is one of us!\u201dThe people of the Demonic path were both frightened and confused.Not understanding why Su Shih would do this.\u201cIs that so?\u201dSu Shi sneered, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you all step back voluntarily and leave the opportunity to me, just for me alone?\u201dThe crowd looked at each other speechlessly.Step back?How could that be!When the opportunity arises, even blood relatives can be killed, let alone strangers they have never met!Someone ventured to say, \u201cBut we can join forces and drive the Righteous people out first \u2026\u2026\u201dSu Shi said disdainfully, \u201cWho are you to deserve to join me?\u201dThose people turned red in the face, but no one dared to look him in the eye.The other party did have the capital to boast.Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, a Holy-grade perfect genius.Besides, wouldn\u2019t it be easier to kill them than to kill Zhan Qingchen and Chen Qingluan?After thinking about this, the people of the Demonic path silently turned away from Su Shi.He was a true demon lord!Cruel and ruthless, killing without blinking an eye!Snap, snap, snap.The applause was loud.The woman in black who did not join the crowd earlier and stood and watched indifferently.She was slender, wearing a black veil, and her bright eyes looked at Su Shi with interest.\u201cKilling and decisive, not sharing the same stream as the weak, as expected of Commander Su.\u201d\u201cI am very interested in Commander Su, I wonder if I can join you?\u201dShe blinked her clear eyes, and her voice was crisp and clear, \u201cMy strength is not weak at all, if you don\u2019t believe me, you can check for yourself.\u201dThe breeze ruffled the hem of her skirt, revealing her calves that were like snow roots.The fact that she wanted to reveal but still concealed made people want to find out more.Su Shi said indifferently, \u201cGet lost.\u201dThe woman\u2019s expression tightened, \u201c Huh?\u201d\u201cYou have three breaths to get out of my sight.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cPfft~\u201dChen Qingluan couldn\u2019t help but laugh.The woman\u2019s chest rose and fell, her eyes turned icy cold, and her voice no longer had a hint of charm, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll remember this!\u201dHaving said that, she turned around and left.The atmosphere from the beginning of the confrontation was shattered, and everyone went their own way with wary eyes.The fragile \u201calliance\u201d was destroyed with a single slash of Su Shi\u2019s sword.Chen Qingluan looked at Su Shi calmly, her cheeks flushed lightly, and she was inexplicably confused.Is he blatantly helping me to avenge what happened last night?Or is he \u2026\u2026Chen Qingluan\u2019s heart was racing, not daring to think further.Zhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes were full of tenderness and she couldn\u2019t wait to jump into Su Shi\u2019s arms immediately.Although she was not afraid of them, it felt so good to be protected!\u201cSu Shi~\u201d\u2026\u2026Time passed.People from the Righteous path and Demonic path had arrived one after another.They were all in tatters with many of them having red stains on their bodies, obviously having suffered greatly in the wave of beasts just now.When they saw the corpses on the ground, their faces changed.Clearly, the strife had already started before there was a chance to see them!At that moment, Ye Xiao staggered out of the forest and collapsed helplessly on the ground.His clothes were in tatters, his body was covered in blood, and his face was as pale as paper as he cursed breathlessly, \u201cWho \u2026\u2026 triggered the beast tide?!\u201d1. \u6b61\u559c\u4f5b (huanxy buddha) litteraly means \u201chappy buddha\u201d, also known as Twin Buddha, Yin and Yang harmony, male and female double cultivation, it is a Buddha statue where men and women have face-to-face s*x.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 \u2013 The world is shocked as the inheritance opens!Ye Xiao was about to spit out blood in anger.He had entered the mountain first and had the spiritual treasures to hide from the demon beasts, the others had just set off and he was already in the interior of the mountains.It can be said that compared others, he is one step ahead!He thought that the opportunity was within his grasp, but somehow he had been caught in the tide of beasts.Not only was he being chased by wild beasts, but he was also being attacked by despicable Demonic people, who said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to outrun the wild beasts, just outrun the righteous people\u201d!This is outrageous!In order not to be trampled to death by the ferocious beasts, Ye Xiao could only choose to fly through the air.As a result, he crashed into a flock of thunder birds, nearly electrocuting them to a crisp!Ye Xiao, who had always possessed invincible qi, began to doubt life for the first time \u2026\u2026\u201cWho, exactly, triggered the beast tide?!\u201dYe Xiao looked at the sky and let out a roar.But then he happened to glance at a white figure, his pupils contracted abruptly and his voice stopped abruptly.Su Shi!The man who haunted his dreams and kept him awake at night!Ye Xiao\u2019s throat was slightly dry.He quietly moved his feet and retreated towards the back.Although he was angry in his heart, he had to admit that he was no match for this man now.The battle in Yulin City had left a huge psychological shadow on him.\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for it, wait for me!!!\u201dYe Xiao hid in the crowd of Righteous people.Only by following a heavenly pride like Zhan Qingchen could he have some sense of security.Su Shi cupped his chin with a pleasant expression.\u201cSure enough, Ye Xiao has entered the mountain early, but he seems to come a little slow.\u201d\u201cLooking at his appearance \u2026\u2026 Did he encounter a beast tide?\u201dAt this moment, a command sounded in his ears.[The host has triggered a wave of beasts, causing minor injuries to Ye Xiao, affecting the next plot trend, earning 10 plot points].\u201cI got points?\u201dSu Shi froze for a moment, \u201cEven though I didn\u2019t do anything specific?!\u201dDid minor injuries count too?Was he too lucky, or was Ye Xiao too unlucky?\u201cSure enough, he really is a treasure guide mouse!\u201dSu Shi smiled

teeth, Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t help but grimace, his back faintly a little cold.Su Shi opened the system panel.Wang Mu died and Ye Xiao was injured, giving twenty plot points.It was enough to draw the

satisfied.\u2026\u2026Buzz~At that moment, a soft voice sounded.Only to see a stone tablet blooming with golden light slowly dimming.The inscriptions on it also disappeared.Looking at the huge stone tablet in front of them, the crowd was momentarily confused, wondering what kind of opportunity this was.Did they have to take the monument home?Some people were curious and touched the tablet, only to have some inscriptions light up, while a faint rumbling sound came from the air.[High-grade perfect talent, can enter the Dust Realm]\u201cWhat is the Dust Realm\u2013 \u201dBefore the words were

knocker!This was not some strange treasure that came out of!This was a legacy from the past!People scrambled to press their hands on the stone tablet.The inscription flickered with light.One by one, the cultivators were drawn into the stone tablet.They soon discovered that High-grade was the minimum requirement, below that talent people were not even qualified to enter!And for most of them, this threshold might not be too high!Many looked disappointed and full of resignation.It is so difficult to enter the inner of Tianqu Mountain, only to have no chance to touch the opportunity?But reality was so cruel.How could a mortal touch the legacy of an ancient emperor?Cen Yiren jumped to the side, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I go and try too?\u201dSu Shi nodded, \u201cGo ahead, there is no danger in this first level.\u201d\u201cHuh, the way you talk is as if you\u2019ve been here before.\u201dCeng Yiren looked at him blankly.But in her heart, she was much more at peace.She walked over and touched the stone tablet.The inscription lit up again, this time with a much stronger light, and a rumbling sound rang out.[Super-grade ordinary, can enter the Stone Realm]A Super-grade ordinary is already considered a first-class talent!Amidst the envious gazes of the crowd, her body slowly disappeared.The sound of thunder resounded again.[Super-grade premium, can enter the Mountain Realm]This is Ye

was said to have never been seen in ten thousand years!Many people were skeptical, and this tablet was the best way to test it!Su Shi looked calm as he walked over and pressed the stone tablet.The air was silent and the sound of a pin drop could be heard.Someone sneered in a low voice, \u201cI knew it, he\u2019s not \u2026\u2026 at all. \u201dBoom!The tablet shook violently, and all the

At that time, people\u2019s lives will be ruined, wouldn\u2019t that be a sin committed by our Tianji Pavilion?\u201d\u201cFor the sake of something called \u2018Righteous Path\u2019, thus risking the lives of many people, do you think it still deserves to be called \u2018Righteous path\u2019? \u201dIf Su Shi was a little commander, he would have already been killed.But now that he has become a Holy-grade perfect genius, he cannot be touched!It was important to finish off the geniuses of the Demonic path, but the people of this world must not bear the cost!\u201cEnough, let\u2019s never discuss this matter again. You may leave.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe gray-robed Daoist Priest\u2019s face turned pale as he bowed and retreated.Sikong Lanyue stood alone for a long time before finally letting out a silent sigh.\u201cThe white moon is in the sky, the stars are dim, the demon star has come out, who else can claim the word Peerless Genius?\u201d\u201cQingchen is very talented, but she happened to be born in the same era as him \u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026Su Shi didn\u2019t realize what kind of uproar was happening in the outside world.He was in a vast and boundless universe, as if he was a flat boat wandering in the Milky Way.Starlight that had traveled through billions of years flowed over his body, coalescing into a glorious light that enveloped him like a cocoon of light.Each starlight contained an infinite image, and although the universe was silent, the sound of the Great Dao resounded in his ears.This was a gathering gift from an ancient great emperor, given to a true genius.As for how much could be understood, it depended on one\u2019s creation.As the Heavenly Sutra ran automatically, points of starlight entered his body, and as spiritual energy flowed unceasingly, it continuously infiltrated his meridians and dantian.[Perception of Star Will Fragments \u2026\u2026][Understanding the Star Will Fragment \u2026\u2026]Intense beeps rang in his ears, but Su Shi was so immersed in the starlight that he didn\u2019t even notice.After an unknown period of time, the river of stars gradually dimmed, as if all the light had been absorbed.Amidst the chaos, he faintly saw a door of white light.Unconsciously, he drifted towards it.\u2026\u2026The air fluctuated and rippled.Poof.One by one, figures fell to the ground like dumplings.The people opened their eyes in confusion.\u201cWhat did you just see?\u201d\u201cI saw the yellow sand in the sky and seemed to have some feelings\u2026\u201d\u201cI, I don\u2019t really remember\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything at all.\u201dAagh~At that moment, the cultivator was seen turning into wild sand, like a sweeping storm, before regaining his human form once more.\u201cI, I\u2019ve sensed divine power!\u201dThe cultivator looked at his hands in shock.\u201cDivine power?\u201d\u201cCould this be the so-called opportunity?\u201d\u201cDamn it, why can\u2019t I!\u201dPeople feel envious or disappointed, hating themselves for not realizing it properly now.But things like enlightenment are mysterious and mysterious.It is not something that can be obtained just by being serious.After a while, the figures of the Heavenly Prides also appeared.Each of them looked thoughtful.Zhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes glittered and her breathing hardened, obviously having made considerable gains.It seemed that she had just entered the Earth Realm and felt the pulse of the earth, and now her dao heart was as solid as a rock!Her sense of heavenly dynamics is becoming more and more clear, which is of great benefit to her cultivation realm!\u201cQingluan, what are you feeling?\u201dShe looked at the young girl in green beside him.\u201cI just fell into the earth\u2019s lava core \u2026\u2026\u201dThe Autumn Water in Chen Qingluan\u2019s hand groaned softly, and the sword was ignited with red light, as if it was magma rolling around, and the searing heat made people dare not look directly at it.Sword Qi is now equipped with attributes!Both of them have entered the Earth Realm, but the enlightenment they have gained is completely different.\u201cThis stone tablet is very mysterious, it seems to be the inheritance of an ancient great power.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, it can really polish my Sword Intent.\u201dThey were already Heavenly Prides from the start, and this enlightenment made them even greater!Ye Xiao fell from the air with an incomparably joyful expression!He had already broken through to the Middle Stage of Golden Elixir Realm in just one sweep!\u201cMountain Realm!\u201d\u201cI have comprehended the Mountain Will!\u201d\u201cThe fall of mountains and water, the changing of seasons, the withering of grass and trees, the rising and setting of the sun and moon!\u201dThinking of that man, Ye Xiao\u2019s smile was very gloomy.\u201cHmph, so what if his talent is good? My enlightenment is unrivaled in the world!\u201d\u201cOne day I will trample you under my feet!\u201d\u201cYou guys, you guys, look!\u201dAt that moment, someone pointed to the sky and exclaimed.Ye Xiao looked up in confusion, and a smile froze on his face.He saw the air fluctuating like water, and the void looked like an open curtain.Amidst the dazzling universe of stars, a dazzling white dress came striding into the air!Clad in the Milky Way, her feet stepped on the stars!Su Shi slowly opened his eyes, and in his eyes seemed to be the evolution of the sea and the stars!The crowd stared blankly at the upright figure.There was no sound!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was a cluster of stars, the scene is too spectacular!\u201dSu Shi did not hide it and said, \u201cI entered the Star Realm and felt the power of the stars.\u201dCen Yiren said enviously, \u201cStars power? That sounds amazing.\u201dSu Shi said amusedly, \u201cWhat about you, what did you feel?\u201dCen Yiren scratched her head, \u201cI entered the Stone Realm and turned into a stone statue, not much enlightenment, it\u2019s just that \u2026\u2026 my strength seems to have grown a little stronger.\u201dSu Shi was stunned, \u201cStrength?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dCen Yiren raised her arm, and her white skin shone, surprisingly becoming as clear as jade.With a relaxed fist, she slammed downwards.Boom!The fist did not touch the ground, but his legs trembled as if it was an earthquake!The rolling smoke dissipated and a huge deep crater appeared in front of it, as if it had been struck by a heavenly meteorite!Cen Yiren moved her neck and her tendons crackled like firecrackers.\u201cThis is really stronger than before.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSu Shi gulped.You call this a bit stronger?I\u2019m afraid this punch can instantly kill a Golden Elixir practicioner!But I have to say, it suits her very well \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Everyone had appeared.Some are happy and some are sad.Since they have been recognized by the stone tablet, they are all at least geniuses of the High-grade perfect, but things like enlightenment are too ethereal.It wasn\u2019t something that could be comprehended with hard work.Nor could everyone catch the flash of spiritual light just now.Just as those people lowered their heads in despair, thinking that they would return without success, there was suddenly a flash of light before their eyes and their surroundings changed completely.All they saw was that they had arrived in another dimension.There were rows of furnaces and in front of them, exactly corresponding to the number of people.In the distance was Medicinal Mountain, with curls of immortal aura and dense spiritual light, it seemed to contain countless spiritual materials!The air once again resounded with the sound of thunder.[Eight taels of sun and moon essence, half a catty of cloud and mist crumbs, put them into the jade gourd, never divulge the secret].[Take spiritual medicine, go up to the platform and, refining spiritual pills, those with higher grades can enter the next level.]\u201cPill Refining?!\u201d\u201cThere is still a test!\u201dSo, the legacy doesn\u2019t end there!Or rather, it had just begun!The crowd was in an uproar!It doesn\u2019t matter that they didn\u2019t feel enlightenment before, now everyone has returned on the same page!As long as they can practice high-grade pills, they will be rewarded and enter the next inheritance!\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cWe must seize the opportunity this time!\u201dThe crowd scrambled to fly towards Medicinal Mountain.The higher the level of refined pills, the higher the failure rate and the longer it would take.Can\u2019t afford to waste any more time!In terms of talent and roots, they are not as good as top-level heavenly talents like Su Shi or Zhan Qingchen.But in terms of insight and vision, these decades were not lived in vain!In the art of alchemy, experience was even more important than talent!Ye Xiao could no longer help but smile.\u201cWhat a boon!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a sixth-grade pill refiner who is well-versed in the Dan Sutra, has mastered techniques and is top-grade and reigns over the Alchemy Conference!\u201d\u201cNo one knows more about alchemy than me!\u201dHe glanced at Su Shi and proudly flew towards Medicine Mountain.He would find the most precious spirit ingredients, practice the highest ranked pills, and ruthlessly trample this man under his feet!\u201cThis time, I\u2019ll take the top spot!\u201d\u2026\u2026Cen Yiren scratched her hair with a depressed look, \u201cWhat should I do, I don\u2019t know how to make pills at all!\u201dAs the daughter of the West Saint, her status was very prestigious and her resources were inexhaustible.She couldn\u2019t even use all the elixirs and immortal pills, so where was the need to make her own?Not to mention refining pills.She didn\u2019t even know what the furnace looked like.Su Shi lay leisurely on the ground, his hands behind his head, with immortal grass in his mouth, casually crossing his legs.Seeing his calm appearance, Cen Yiren frowned and said, \u201cLooks like you know a lot about the alchemy? \u201dWhy else would he look as if he was confident of victory?Su Shi shook his head, \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way, as far as alchemy is concerned, I know nine out of ten steps.\u201d 1Cen Yiren was puzzled, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCen Yiren covered her face, \u201cThen why are you so calm?!\u201dThis is an ancient heritage!If you can\u2019t practice the pill, the opportunity will belong to others!\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of rushing?\u201dSu Shi smiled and said, \u201cBesides, who said that pills should be refined by oneself?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dCen Yiren was a little confused, not understanding what he meant.Su Shi looked at the fish-like figure on the Medicinal Mountain, and the corners of his mouth curled into a smile.\u201cNo need to panic, we still have a way!\u201d1.

There\u2019s no harm in preparing more.\u201dZhan Qingchen nodded, \u201cThat makes sense, you are indeed wise, then I will also take a little more.\u201d\u201cUm \u2026\u2026\u201dThe two of them, \u201ceach with their own agenda\u201d, started picking medicine in silence.\u201cChief Zhan, Imperial Censor Chen!\u201dHearing the voices, they saw a young man walking quickly towards them.Looking at those two stunning faces, Ye Xiao could not help but marvel in his heart.There really were amazing beauties on earth!Zhan Qingchen\u2019s brows furrowed slightly as she quietly took a few steps back.Ye Xiao did not notice and said as he cupped his hands, \u201cI am Ye Xiao, I have heard a lot about Fairy Zhan, and today I was able to see it for myself and you are truly like a heavenly being.\u201d\u201cAs for Imperial Censor Chen, we are old friends.\u201dHe was very well-mannered and his eyes were clear.Despite his unremarkable appearance, he had a strong sense of intent.Zhan Qingchen tilted his head, \u201cYour friend?\u201dChen Qingluan shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know him.\u201d\u201cCough \u2026\u2026\u201dYe Xiao laughed forcefully, \u201cImperial Censor Chen is a noble but forgetful person, back in Yulin City in the Southwest Region, I even fought alongside Censor Chen.\u201d\u201cYulin City?\u201dChen Qingluan pondered for a moment and said absentmindedly, \u201cYou were the Tianyi Sect disciple who was chased and beaten by Su Shi and finally stabbed with a sword?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t actually die?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s eyebrows jumped wildly for a while.Although this was true, there was no need to say it in detail!\u201cIt is true that I am no match for that Su demon\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut no matter how hard the effort and how long the time, one day I will eradicate that demon and return the world to the bright and clear sky!\u201dHe looked resolute, his eyes firm.The young man had his own ambitions, to live according to the flow of the immortal Yellow River!That was what a man should do!Ye Xiao\u2019s blood burned wildly, but the atmosphere was calm and a little awkward.Zhan Qingchen and Chen Qingluan looked at each other.This man couldn\u2019t be stupid, could he?Chen Qingluan frowned and said, \u201cSu Shi is stronger than you, more talented than you, and looks more \u2026\u2026 cough, what are you relying on to eradicate him? Relying on this mouth of yours?\u201dYe Xiao didn\u2019t take offense and said, \u201cAs long as I catch the opportunity, I will be able to surpass him one day!\u201d\u201cAnd now is the most opportune time!\u201d\u201cAs long as Su Shi can be expelled, won\u2019t this opportunity be under my control?!\u201dChen Qingluan was curious, \u201cBut how did you expel Su Shi?\u201dYe Xiao looked around and said in a low voice, \u201cSu Shi is too confident, he hasn\u2019t even started collecting medicinal materials yet, and he must be the last one to concoct pills!\u201d\u201cWhen the pill is about to come out of the furnace, the three of us will attack at the same time to destroy the furnace, he definitely won\u2019t have time to concoct a second one!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Imperial Censor Chen also lose at the hands of this demon? This is a good opportunity for revenge!\u201dThis was the plan he had just devised.Not only did he want to successfully pass the exam, he also wanted to kick Su Shi out!The more Ye Xiao spoke, the more excited he became.But he did not realize the icy expressions of the two people in front of him.Chen Qingluan\u2019s eyes were extremely cold, her thumb was slightly above her sword sheath, and a wisp of murderous Qi escaped.Should\u2026I kill this person first?At this moment, Zhan Qingchen, who hadn\u2019t spoken yet, spoke, \u201cYe Xiao, from Tianyi Sect, isn\u2019t?\u201dYe Xiao nodded his head, \u201cIt is.\u201dZhan Qingchen said indifferently, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll remember that.\u201dAfter saying that, she turned straight and left.Chen Qingluan hesitated for a moment, but still lifted her foot to follow.Looking at their backs, Ye Xiao scratched his head, \u201cSo is this a deal?\u201dFor some reason, he felt that something was off, but he did not know exactly.\u2026\u2026The two girls walked out far away, silent all the way.Chen Qingluan hesitated slightly and asked in a low voice, \u201c What will you do if he makes a move against Su Shi \u2026\u2026?\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes were indifferent and did not answer.If not for Chen Qingluan being here, this Ye Xiao would already be a corpse!If the other party dared to make even the slightest movement during the concubinage process later, even in front of all the righteous people, she would definitely behead him mercilessly!Chen Qingluan\u2019s face instantly changed when he felt the rich killing aura on his body.\u201cQingchen, you\u2019re not really serious about fighting Su Shi, are you?\u201d\u201cSo should I come along too-\u201c\u201cI will not interfere, even if there is a battle later, I will kill that Ye Xiao first.\u201d\u2026\u2026The crowd finished taking the spiritual materials and returned from the Medicinal Mountain one after another.Finding that Su Shi was still lying down and sleeping, Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t help but smile coldly.\u201cToo arrogant!\u201d\u201cYou will suffer in a moment!\u201dHe sat cross-legged in front of the herb furnace and skillfully lit the furnace and flame, and began refining pills.After all, refining a high-level spirit pill first and completing the test is serious business.Looking at Su Shi, who was sleeping peacefully, Zhan Qingchen shook her head amusedly.That big idiot, he definitely doesn\u2019t know how to refine pills, so it seems like I should do it right away.Chen Qingluan also noticed the scene.Fortunately I prepared twice as many herbal potions, this fool!\u201c\u201dAlright \u2026\u2026 forget it, let\u2019s help him concoct one first.\u201d\u201dThe two quickly began to light a fire to refine the pill.Ceng Yiren looked towards the busy crowd and then towards Su Shi who was sound asleep, pulling his hair all over the floor in despair.\u201cThis time it\u2019s over!\u201d\u201cHuaaaaaaa~ My ancient emperor\u2019s inheritance!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 \u2013 If you don\u2019t know how to refine pills, isn\u2019t it still possible by robbing?8-10 minutes\u201cWhen the cinnabar in the corner of the pit gives off brocade clouds, the lead color of the tortoise hair is dense with radiance. I have come to bring it to the refining furnace and refine it until the energy of nature can no longer be separated.\u201d 1\u201cIn the art of alchemy, it\u2019s all about the breath of dragons and tigers, exhaling the old and the new!\u201d\u201cThe choice of spiritual materials, the control of the fire, the temperature of the furnace, and even the concentration of spiritual energy around it, will all affect the quality of the pill!\u201d\u201cOnly by achieving perfection and precision can a truly perfect spirit pill be made!\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s palm spouted flames, and the furnace and suspended in the air as rolling green smoke billowed.One hand controlled the spiritual energy, while the other hand controlled the fire.Very detailed.Every movement was a detail!\u201cRise!\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s gaze was like a torch, and the furnace burned brightly!Buzz~The furnace shook for a while, and the lid lifted into the air.A dark purple potion flew out, dripping and swirling in the air, blooming with seven-colored mist!Dark clouds converged in the air, and there seemed to be a rumble of thunder in the clouds.Moments later, a rainstorm descended!A vision of heaven and earth!It was the legendary sign of the Heavenly Elixir coming out of the furnace!\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201dYe Xiao looked surprised.He did not expect that not only had he refined a seventh grade Spirit Pill, but it was also a perfect grade Heavenly Spirit Pill!Even he had never concocted a pill of this quality before!\u201cAs expected of me!\u201dYe Xiao was satisfied.There was no failure this time, and definitely now people would not look down on him!The other cultivators were also stunned.Who would have thought that there would be someone who could make Heavenly Spirit Pill here?Even the old pill masters from the Elixir Tower probably couldn\u2019t do it!Yet at the same time they considered this a great nuisance, because as a result many of them could not control the fire properly, and their spirit pills were instantly burnt to charcoal.There were also some of them whose furnace was doused by a rainstorm, and their work was instantly ruined.People cursed and cursed, but there was nothing they could do but return to Medicinal Mountain with blackened faces to collect materials.Looking at the messy scene around hi., Ye Xiao crossed his arms and laughed coldly.\u201cHmph, a bunch of cannon fodder!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cSu Shi, don\u2019t sleep, people have finished concocting their pills.\u201dCeng Yiren pushed Su Shi.Su Shi opened his eyes in a daze, \u201cWho has finished concocting the pills?\u201dCen Yiren pointed towards Ye Xiao, \u201cThat\u2019s him, he has refined a seventh grade Heavenly Spirit Pill.\u201d\u201cJust in time.\u201dSu Shi got up and stretched, \u201cI\u2019ll go and snatch it.\u201dCen Yiren: \u201cHuh?\u201d\u2026\u2026Looking at the man in white in front of him, Ye Xiao frowned, \u201cSu Shi, what are you trying to do?\u201d\u201cRobbery.\u201dSu Shi said frankly.Ye Xiao gulped, \u201cWhat do you mean by that? This is a test to concoct pills, not to rob pills!\u201dSu Shi shook his head, \u201cThis was originally my pill, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s in your hands temporarily.\u201d\u201cSu Shi, you bastard!\u201dYe Xiao was furious, his Qi energy erupted and his clothes fluttered, \u201cDo you really think that I\u2019m a soft cake that anyone can take advantage of?!\u201dSu Shi said suspiciously, \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cChief Zhan, Imperial Censor Chen, it\u2019s time to take action, this demon is too arrogant!\u201dYe Xiao took out a pitch black heavy ruler and said with a murderous aura, \u201cLet\u2019s join me to expel him away!\u201dThe air was silent and the sound of cricket can be heard.The two girls sat down on their knees as if they hadn\u2019t heard anything.Zhan Qingchen: \u201cThis Heavenly Spirit Pill has perfect quality, Su Shi will definitely be able to pass the test if he takes it.\u201dChen Qingluan:\u00a0\u201cHmm, not bad, saves me from helping him concoct it.\u201dSeeing the appearance of the two people, Ye Xiao\u2019s back faintly felt cold.The situation did not seem to be the same as expected!\u201cFellow daoists of the Righteous path, are you just going to watch this demon bully people?!\u201dYe Xiao tried to arouse the sympathy of the others.Unfortunately, no one cared.These people\u2019s pills had just been destroyed because of him, obviously they looked at him with displeasure.Besides, who would want to offend a genius of the Demonic path who was popular only for sake a stranger?Su Shi\u2019s eyes narrowed, \u201cIf I kill you, I can easily take the pill from you, now the question is, are you willing to give the pill voluntarily or do you want me to do it myself?\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s expression changed.He knew that this demon was not joking!Thinking of the other party\u2019s ruthless tactics in Yulin City, Ye Xiao hesitated and handed the spirit pill to the other party with a red face.A great man knows how to measure his opponent!Right now he was not comparable to Su Shi!Su Shi weighed the pill and said, \u201cGo, it shouldn\u2019t be too late to go and concoct the second one now.\u201dYe Xiao while holding back anger flew towards Medicinal Mountain.Where there was life there was hope!As long as he could pass the test, everything still had a chance!This time, time was very tight, so he did not show off his abilities, but chose the surest way to pass it.Making a sixth-grade pill!Gathering the materials, lighting the fire, preparing the furnace, and it was done!All in one go!Although it was not a Heavenly Spirit Pill, the quality was still first class, Ye Xiao was indeed a professional in this field of pill making!However, before the pill even cooled down, a shadow covered his body.Ye Xiao\u2019s expression froze as he slowly raised his head to look, only to see Su Shi smiling gently.\u201cHello, I came to rob.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you already have one?!\u201d\u201cBut I still have one more partner.\u201d\u201cBastard!!!\u201d\u201cDo you want to give it up or not?\u201d\u201c\u2026I give!\u201dLooking at Su Shi\u2019s back, Ye Xiao\u2019s body trembled with anger.If only he was strong, he would have killed this demon long ago!\u201cIt\u2019s too late to concoct pills now \u2026\u2026\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s eyes swept gloomily over the crowd, \u201cLooks like I can only rob!\u201dHe took out a heavy ruler and walked towards a Demonic cultivator.Perhaps inspired by Su Shi, those who couldn\u2019t refine the pill all started to rob as well, and those who were robbed were naturally unwilling to do so, and for a while the square was in chaos!Su Shi tossed the pill to Cen Yiren, \u201cHere, take it.\u201dCen Yiren reached out and took it with a dumbfounded expression, \u201cThere\u2019s still hope?\u201dSu Shi patted her shoulder, \u201cRemember, leave professional things to professionals, if you don\u2019t know how to refine pills, isn\u2019t it still possible by robbing?\u201dCen Yiren\u2019s eyes opened wideIt seems to make sense!Boom!The battle intensified.The two camps between the Righteous path and the Demonic path, were in chaos, and they even began to turn to attack their own people.The young girl in black moved lightly and darted out of the crowd.In her hand, she held a bright green spirit pill.\u201cHaha, how convenient to snatch it.\u201d\u201cA fifth-grade Spirit Pill \u2026\u2026 should be enough.\u201dBuzz~At that moment, the air fluctuated and a booming sound rang out:[Time is up, the test is over.]The fighting people were separated by an invisible force.A golden tray appeared in front of each person, and when a pill was placed on it, its quality was naturally revealed.[Fourth-grade Profound Spirit Pill, eliminated].[Fifth-grade Earth Spirit Pill, can enter the next stage].[Fifth-grade Earth Spirit Pill, can enter the next stage.][Fifth-grade Earth Spirit Pill, can enter the next stage.]Those who advanced were overjoyed, while those who were eliminated were hysterical.Zhan Qingchen had refined a sixth-grade Earth Spirit Pill, while Chen Qingluan had a sixth-grade Earth Spirit PillTheir qualities were comparable.Ye Xiao grabbed a five-grade Golden Spirit Pill and was able to advance to the next level.Su Shi placed the pill on the tray.The sound of lightning was extremely loud:[Seventh-grade Heavenly Spirit Pill, able to enter the next stage, rewarding Blue Sky Heavenly Flame]\u201cBlue Sky \u2026 Heavenly Flame?\u201d1. This is a poem about alchemy, unfortunately I couldn\u2019t find a translated version for this on the internet and just guessed how it translates with some modifications.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 \u2013 Walking the Labyrinth with Chen Qingluan!Green-blue flames slowly fell from the sky.Although it was a flame, it had a cold and piercing sensation, and the surrounding temperature dropped so quickly that even the air condensed into ice.Su Shi raised his palm.The flames fell onto his palm and surged like flowing water, as if showing affection for him.Blue Sky Heavenly Fire.A top-tier fire and the fire that pill refiners dreamed of!Devouring impurities and purifying the origin.With this fire, the chances of refining a Heavenly Spirit Pill were greatly increased!Not only that, it can also extinguish itself and remove impurities from spiritual energy, which is extremely beneficial to the breakthrough of cultivation!People\u2019s eyes looked envious.This inheritance is truly extraordinary!Right after entering the stone monument, he was blessed with fortune.Now, in the first stage, he had a treasure like Heavenly Fire!How terrifying would the next opportunity be?Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes turned red and his fists were clenched tightly, his nails clenched into his palms and seeping out traces of blood.\u201cThat Heavenly Fire should be mine!\u201d\u201cSu Shi, you deserve to die!\u201dIt had always been him who had snatched away others\u2019 opportunities, but now he has been snatched away by this demon!!!If fire and this were given to him, promotion to a ninth-grade pill refiner was imminent!\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Zhan Qingchen and Chen Qingluan make a move just now?\u201d\u201cIt seems that they want to maintain their power and don\u2019t want to clash with this demon too quickly.\u201d\u201cWhat Heavenly Prides of Righteous path, it\u2019s all nonsense!\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s eyes were grim and cold, clearly holding a grudge.In his eyes, anyone who did not help him was a villain!Although he was not currently comparable to them, he would definitely not let them go if he gained strength!As Su Shi watched, the corners of his mouth curled up in a cold smile.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy being a tool for the first time, is it?\u201d\u201cYou yourself should know best, when the role of a tool is drained, its existence is no longer needed.\u201dBuzz~A rumbling sound rang through the air:[Enter the next stage.]A light flashed, and those who were eliminated looked resigned as their forms slowly disappeared into the air.They were instantly taken out of the secret realm.There were as many cultivators as those who entered Medicinal Mountain, but after two rounds passed, there were only twenty left today.The air fluctuated like water and the surroundings changed once again.Su Shi opened his eyes.He saw that everyone around him had disappeared, and in front of him was an elaborately landscaped garden, as if it was a royal back garden.Under his feet was a circular path that split into several ramifications in front of him.The sound of rumbling thunder resounded.[There are portals in all directions, when you want to return, there is no way out][Those who enter the center can enter the next stage]Su Shi cupped his chin, \u201cWell \u2026\u2026 it really is a labyrinth.\u201d\u201cSu Shi?\u201dA familiar voice sounded from behind him.Turning back to look, he only saw the young girl in green standing not far behind him.Su Shi smiled and said, \u201cImperial Censor Chen? It seems that fate has brought us together.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s eyes fluttered.Everyone\u2019s positions were randomly scattered, but the two of them managed to appear in the same place.It seemed like it really was fated.\u201cThank you very much when at the stone monument before\u2026\u201dChen Qingluan said in a low voice.When they had first arrived at the stone monument, she and Zhan Qingchen had been surrounded by a group of people from the Demonic path.The two of them were so powerful that despite the huge difference in their numbers, the people from the Demonic path were hesitant to make a move.But if Su Shi was added to the group, the situation would be completely different.Even if they could survive, they would definitely be severely injured and drop out of this test, completely losing their inheritance.However, Su Shi chose to kill Demon Monk Shi Yun with a single slash.The alliance was instantly broken.\u201cActually, that Demon Monk is right, without me and Qingchen, your two formidable rivals will be reduced so your chances of gaining an opportunity are greatly increased.\u201dChen Qingluan shook hee head, \u201cHowever you prefer this way, there will be suspicion of you colluding with the Righteous path, you know?\u201dFrom her point of view as an enemy.This choice really wasn\u2019t a wise one.\u201cHaven\u2019t we been colluding for a long time?\u201dSu Shi laughed, \u201cEven Imperial Censor Chen is not afraid, what am I, a demon from Demon Sect, afraid of? Besides, in my heart, some people are far more important than opportunities.\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s heart skipped a beat!There were some people who were more important than opportunities?Who is the person he is talking about?It can\u2019t be Qingchen, can it \u2026\u2026 Could it be that the person who is important to him is me?Chen Qingluan was confused and stammered, \u201cNonsense, who, who has colluded with you?\u201dThis seducer!Su Shi didn\u2019t think much of it.Looking at the complex surroundings, he frowned and said, \u201cAccording to the clues of the thunder sound, this should be a huge labyrinth formation. Imperial Censor Chen, do you know anything about formations?\u201dThe stone tablet tests aptitude, while the alchemy exam tests control.And this labyrinth formation, the test should be about insight.Chen Qingluan calmed his mind and nodded, \u201cI\u2019ve dabbled, but I\u2019m not really proficient.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dSu Shi took a branch and sketched on the ground, \u201cThere are portals on all sides, and when you want to go back in a hurry, there is no way out, this is definitely a hint of the Eight Gates Golden Lock Formation.\u201dThe eight gates are divided into:Xiu Men (\u4f11\u9580 / Door of Rest)Sheng Men (\u751f\u9580 / Door of Life)Shang Men (\u50b7\u9580 / Door of Injury)Tu Men (\u675c\u9580 / Door of Fabrication)Jing Men (\u666f\u9580 / Door of Scenery)Si Men (\u6b7b\u9580 / Door of Death)Jing Men (\u9a5a\u9580 / Door of Fright)Kai Men (\u958b\u9580 / Open Door)Entering the [Door of Life], [Door of Scenery], [Open Door] is fortunate; entering the [Door of Injury], [Door of Fright] and [Door of Rest] is wretched; entering the [Door of Fabrication] and [Door of Death] is death.Chen Qingluan nodded and said, \u201cSo we just need to find the [Door of Life]?\u201dSu Shi shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple, remember the second sentence that the voice of thunder said?\u201dChen Qingluan thought for a moment and said, \u201cWe have to walk to the center?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, there is no way out when you want to go back.\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t walk out of the formation, we will move in the opposite direction, so what we are looking for is \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDoor of Death.\u201dSu Shi circled the [Door of Death] location.This level was not explained in detail in the book, and the specifics were simply skipped.Based on his privilege as a \u201cSon of Dao\u201d, Ye Xiao passed the exam in an almost underhanded manner.Su Shi could only rely on his own analysis.\u201cMakes sense.\u201dChen Qingluan looked up into the air, green aura flickering in her eyes.It was forbidden to fly in this labyrinthine formation, so it was impossible to get a full view, but it was possible to tell where it was by looking into the air.\u201cFive hundred steps south and three hundred steps west\u2026\u2026 I found it!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe two walked forward along the path.The closer they approached the [Door of Death], the more they could feel the dense aura of death, and low growls could be heard faintly from the dark rooms around them.It seemed that a predatory beast was lurking.It sent a chill down the back.After walking for quite a while, the two stopped in their tracks.They had reached the place where the gate of death was.But in front of them was a high wall, completely blocking the way.The ground trembled as the murderous aura boiled, and the hiss of countless beasts charged behind them.\u201cLooks like I guessed wrong.\u201d\u201cThere is not only one Eight Gates Golden Locks Formation here, but countless formations surrounding it, while the center is completely isolated!\u201d\u201cThe [Door of Life] path is inaccessible!\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s expression was cold.She drew his long sword and prepared for battle.Su Shi glanced at the dry well in the garden next to him and shook his head, \u201cWho said center, meaning formation center?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dChen Qingluan froze.Su Shi smiled and said, \u201cAlthough the ground is flat, but it\u2019s actually a little curved; there\u2019s a super huge ball under our feet.\u201d\u201cThe center that the sound of thunder refers to is actually the center of the earth!\u201dHe pulled the dumbfounded Chen Qingluan and took large steps towards the dry well.Then they jumped in!The \u201cEight Gates Golden Locks Formation\u201d is a fictional military formation invented by Luo Guanzhong in the novel \u201cRomance of the Three Kingdoms\u201d. It uses an intricate system of shielded walls and formations of soilders to trap and isolate enemy troops. In reality, formations as complex as this were never used in Ancient China as not only were they far too complex to deploy on short notice but also would not be effective due to their own troops being divided into smaller and therefore more easily defeated units.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: It turns out Su Shi likes me!Before Chen Qingluan could react, she was pulled by Su Shi and jumped into the well.They both plunged down.It was normal to think they would reach the bottom immediately, but after all this time they had yet to see the end.This deep well was like a tunnel to the heart of the earth.It was narrow enough for two people to pass through, and Chen Qingluan subconsciously leaned into Su Shi\u2019s embrace.Listening to the sound of his strong heartbeat, her eyes slowly became misty.After an unknown period of time, light appeared before their eyes and their feet finally landed on solid ground.\u201cImperial Censor Chen, we have arrived.\u201dSu Shi\u2019s warm and gentle voice rang out.Chen Qingluan came back to her senses.Only then did she realize that she was still wrapped around his shoulders, and the two of them were almost tightly pressed together.Her pretty face flushed red, she hurriedly released her hand and took two steps back in panic.Fortunately there were only the two of them here, and no one else saw the scene.The two of them were in the center of a large cave, the roof of the cave is slightly curved, and Su Shi guessed the right thing.This level might seem simple, but one wrong move and there was no way out for them.With only two clues, he was able to determine the correct route and bravely jumped into the well.This requires not only insight, but also tremendous faith in your own judgment.I didn\u2019t see it before, this man is quite smart \u2026Chen Qingluan secretly said in her heart.If she hadn\u2019t met Su Shi, she probably would have found her way out as well, but it definitely wouldn\u2019t have gone so smoothly.Su Shi sighed.\u201cWith Cen Yiren\u2019s intelligence, it will be a little difficult to clear this hurdle.\u201dThe two of them were not in the same formation, so even if he wanted to help, there was nothing he could do.Chen Qingluan glanced at him, \u201cWorried about your sweetheart?\u201dSu Shi froze, \u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThat is \u2026\u2026 big bear sister.\u201dChen Qingluan stretched out her hand and gestured.Su Shi cried and laughed, \u201cWhat are you talking about, she is my Senior Sister, she only accompanies me.\u201d\u201cI see, so it is Senior Sister.\u201dFor some reason, Chen Qingluan inexplicably heaved a sigh of relief.Looking at that incomparably handsome face side, she ghostly asked, \u201cEarlier in Yulin City, you had mentioned a girl that \u2026\u2026 you seemed to really like?\u201dAs soon as the words left her mouth, Chen Qingluan regretted it.Why am I asking this?What does it matter to me who he likes?Hearing this question, Su Shi was also a little surprised.But not avoiding it, he nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I really like her.\u201dChen Qingluan was silent for a moment, \u201cShe must be pretty, right?\u201dSu Shi\u2019s eyes were like stars, she hooked a smile and said softly, \u201cShe\u2019s the most beautiful girl I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dSeeing his delicate appearance, Chen Qingluan\u2019s chest felt tight, suddenly a little out of breath.However, she couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cShe, what kind of person is she?\u201dWhat kind of mesmerizing beauty, exactly?What kind of beauty is this man worthy of seeing?Su Shi thought about it and said, \u201cIn short, both of our identities require us to be enemies.\u201d\u201cShe is the heavenly pride admired by many, appearing cold on the outside, but has a gentle heart inside.\u201d\u201cAlthough there are heavy obstacles between us, one day, I will remove all these obstacles and stand before her openly and honestly!\u201dChen Qingluan froze as she listened.An identity that required the two to be enemies?Admired by many?Could it be that Su Shi favored a Heavenly Pride from Righteous path?She seemed to think of something and asked carefully, \u201cYou guys must have gone through a lot between you, right?\u201dSu Shi smiled bitterly and said, \u201cActually not long ago we were still fighting to the death in the Southwest Region.\u201d\u201cBut also when I was injured and I spent a few days with her, it made me understand my own heart.\u201dChen Qingluan was struck by lightning!Heavenly Pride of the Righteous path, appearing cold on the outside, fighting to death in the Southwest Region not long ago, spending a few days together due to injury!Each of them was a perfect match detail!Could it be that the girl Su Shi likes is\u2026Actually me?!No wonder he risked his life to save me in Yulin City, no wonder he wanted to help me in front of the stone tablet, no wonder he said there were people more important to him than chance!So Su Shi liked me all along?Chen Qingluan\u2019s heart is about to jump out!Thinking about what Su Shi had just said.\u201cAlthough there are heavy obstacles between us, one day, I will remove all these obstacles and stand before her openly and honestly.\u201dBecause the Righteous path and the Demonic path are sworn enemies, so he doesn\u2019t dare to say it directly, and can only confess to me in this subtle way?Chen Qingluan gripped the hem of her dress with her slender hands, her pretty face as red as blood, her thoughts in turmoil.I clearly have a bad temper and a cold personality, but in his eyes I am beautiful and gentle?Although he bullied me and belittled me, he also saved me and helped me.What should I do?After a long hesitation, she gathered her courage and whispered, \u201cSu Shi, I understand your feelings. But we\u2019ve known each other too briefly, we can, we can start as friends first, but you must promise not to bully me in the future\u2026.\u201dSu Shi frowned tightly, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dBuzz~At that moment, the air trembled and several figures fell from the air.Others had already passed through the labyrinth.Chen Qingluan held back her words and quietly withdrew.Others she doesn\u2019t care, but this absolutely can\u2019t let Zhan Qingchen know \u2026\u2026The first to fall was none other than Zhan Qingchen.The moon-white daoist robe was like a floating cloud, light and delicate as it flew towards him.\u201cQingluan? You\u2019ve passed the formation too?\u201dZhan Qingchen revealed a smile.Chen Qingluan\u2019s eyes fluttered, \u201cI followed Su Shi here.\u201dZhan Qingchen was silent for a moment and said anxiously, \u201cThe two of you didn\u2019t fight, did you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen why are your cheeks so red?\u201d\u201cI \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m just a little overheated.\u201dChen Qingluan was too vain to look at her.Zhan Qingchen didn\u2019t think much of it and said, \u201cThis labyrinth is so difficult, it took me half an hour to completely unravel it.\u201dThere were many ways to get through the formation.Su Shi\u2019s way was the easiest and fastest, but it also required extreme insight, while Zhan Qingchen had disassembled and rearranged the big formation and analyzed the correct route the hard way.Su Shi is still superior to me.Chen Qingluan thought to herself.Ye Xiao slowly descended from the air.Looking at the three people who had already passed through the formation, his brows immediately furrowed.I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not the fastest?Although he knew nothing about formations, he had once, by chance, obtained a cone of Formation-breaking Divine Incense.As long as he lit the divine incense and followed the direction in which the green smoke drifted, he would be able to find the correct route.There was absolutely no need to think.But to his surprise, he still only landed in fourth place.Cheating, they must be cheating! How else could they be faster than me?Ye Xiao was very upset.Several other people also arrived one after another.Originally twenty people had entered the labyrinth formation, but now only nine people had made it through, and the girl in black was also among them.Su Shi shook his head helplessly.\u201cIt seems that Cen Yiren is really unlucky \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dBANG!A figure fell from a great height and landed solidly in front of him.\u201cCough!\u201dOnly to see smoke and dust rolling around, Cen Yiren climbed up with a dusty face and sat frozen on the ground with a puzzled expression.\u201cDoes that mean I\u2019ve made it?\u201dSu Shi froze, puzzled, \u201cHow did you get down?\u201dCeng Yi Ren scratched her head, \u201cI wandered around inside for a long time, but I couldn\u2019t find a way at all. I can\u2019t fly, and I can\u2019t push the wall, so I have to dig into the ground.\u201d\u201cDig?\u201dSu Shi gulped, \u201cSo \u2026\u2026 You dug into the ground?!\u201dCen Yiren nodded, \u201cMy arms hurt from digging.\u201dSu Shi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: True Dragon Qi Perceiving Technique, Cen Yiren\u2019s Illusion!7-9 minutesSu Shi stared blankly at Cen Yiren.It was impossible to use spiritual power in this formation, so she had dug the ground with brute force?It was the same as a mole, wasn\u2019t it?Cen Yiren\u2019s hands shone with jade luster.\u201cIt\u2019s good that I have improved my strength in the Stone Realm, otherwise, I would be a little incapable of digging \u2026\u2026 By the way, did you also dig all the way down?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSu Shi rubbed his eyebrows, \u201cI\u2019m not as smart as you.\u201dThere are no restrictions on how to pass through this formation, as long as you reach the \u201cearth core\u201d, you will be considered successful.Cen Yiren also found a different way.As the ten people arrived, a thunder voice rang out.[The first to reach the center will be rewarded with the \u201cMyriad Formations Solution\u201d and the \u201cTrue Dragon Perceiving Tec hnique\u201d]Two ancient books appeared out of thin air.One floated in front of Chen Qingluan and one floated in front of Su Shi.Su Shi stretched out his hand and picked it up.On the cover, four large words flew in the dragon\u2019s eyes: \u201cTrue Dragon Perceiving Technique\u201d.Qi Perceiving.Seeing is more than just seeing, but seeing to the heart.At the deepest level of cultivation, one can see a kind of mist rising upwards, thin and light.This is what is called Qi.If it is bright, you will prosper; if it is dark, you will meet failure; if it is red, you will be rich; if it is black, you will be in trouble; if it is purple, you will be rich.It can be used to turn bad luck into good luck, and to read people\u2019s faces.Emperors and kings of all times valued this technique.It is said that there are now some masters in the imperial court who specialize in perceiving the fate of the country for the sake of the emperor.This ancient book is a top-level qi perceiving technique.If one could cultivate enough, he could even reverse the dragon veins and change the sky!\u201cGood stuff, but it will take a lot of time to learn.\u201dThis supernatural technique was too profound.Even if one specialized in studying it deeply, it would take at least a few years to achieve any results.At this point, the system beep sounded.[Acquiring a special technique: \u201cTrue Dragon Qi Perceiving Technique\u201d, can be obtained automatically by consuming 40 plot points].Su Shi was stunned, \u201cAutomatically obtained?\u201d\u201cPlot points have this kind of effect?\u201dThe system gave an explanation.The divine techniques and abilities obtained from the system would be obtained directly and automatically, while those obtained by other means could be obtained by consuming Plot Points.There was no difference in effect between the two.\u201cQuite thoughtful!\u201dSu Shi nodded in satisfaction.This would save him a lot of time.Compared to the value of the True Dragon Qi Perceiving Technique, forty plot points was not much, but he had just drawn two Blind Boxes and was currently out of ammunition.\u201cAnyway, we\u2019ll put it off until later.\u201dHe had just put down the ancient book when a familiar voice sounded in his ears, \u201cSu Shi \u2026\u2026\u201dHe only saw Chen Qingluan silently looking at him from afar and transmitting, \u201cThere are too many people now, so this formation solution will be carried with me for the time being, and I will give it to you when we go out.\u201dSu Shi frowned and said, \u201cThis is your reward, what\u2019s the point of giving it to me?\u201dChen Qingluan said, \u201c If I don\u2019t meet you, even if I pass the exam, I will definitely not be the first champion, this should be yours.\u201dSu Shi shook his head, \u201cYou are the one who discovered where the Door of Death is, this is the result of both of us working together.\u201d\u201cBut you could have \u2026\u2026 done the same thing without me.\u201dChen Qingluan said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t meet you, even if I pass the exam, I will definitely not be the first champion, this should be yours.\u201d\u201cDo what you\u2019re told!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Uh.\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s cheeks were slightly red, no longer arguing with him, the corners of her mouth couldn\u2019t help but rise slightly, her heart was sweet as if she had eaten honey.\u2026\u2026Of the ten people left today.Besides Su Shi and Cen Yiren, who were from the Demonic path, and the woman in black, whose identity was unknown, the remaining seven were all from the Righteous path.As he saw Su Shi get another opportunity, the cynicism in Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes grew thicker.\u201cCalm down, it\u2019s almost time for the final inheritance.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I lose the first few times, I have to grasp it this last time!\u201d\u201cBefore, alchemy was the first stage, so it is understandable that Zhan Qingchen was reluctant to make a move, but in front of the final inheritance, they will definitely not hold back!\u201d\u201cSeven against two, the advantage is mine!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s kick Su Shi out first!\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s eyes were ice-cold.He could not accept someone seizing the opportunity right in front of him!The air fluctuated and his surroundings changed once again.They were standing at the edge of a cliff, with a staircase leading to the sky in front of them, the top of which was lost in the clouds, and they had no idea what was at the end.The sound of thunder was heard.[Dreams and illusions are just images created by the mind, while wind, flowers, snow and the moon are real, delusions of love and clouds confuse consciousness, rising and falling are still different.][Those who climb to the top can get the chance of good fortune.]The test this time is simple and easy to understand.Climb the heavenly ladder.If you climb to the top, you will get the chance to be creative.But can it really be that simple?After the first few trials, everyone became more alert, and no one was slow to move.But after observing for a long time, they couldn\u2019t see any clues.Finally, someone pressed on and stepped forward.But as soon as his foot stepped on the step, he stopped like a statue, and he didn\u2019t respond to the shouts of the people shouting at him.Cen Yiren wondered, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he moving?\u201dSu Shi said indifferently, \u201cBecause he has entered the Illusory realm.\u201d\u201cIllusory realm?\u201dCen Yiren froze.\u201cDreams and illusions are just images created by the mind, while wind, flowers, snow and the moon are real.\u201d\u201cEvery step of this is an illusion, and the further you go, the stronger the effect, magnifying the desire in one\u2019s mind many times over.\u201dSu Shi admonished, \u201cSo, you must remember that any scenery you see after stepping onto the stone steps is fake.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have a pure heart and don\u2019t have any desires.\u201dCen Yiren was full of confidence.She walked to the heavenly stone steps and stepped onto them with a wide smile.In the next instant, she was frozen in place.Su Shi covered his face, \u201cI knew it!\u201dWalking towards Cen Yiren, he only saw her cheeks red, her eyes misty, and her mouth still muttering in a small voice.Su Shi frowned slightly.What does this girl see?As he brought his ears a little closer, he heard Cen Yiren\u2019s voice that was both embarrassed and excited, \u201cNo, no, Su Shi, I\u2019m your Senior Sister, this is wrong! Put your clothes on now!\u201dSu Shi: \u201c????\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s on your head?!\u201d\u201cHey wake up!!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 \u2013 This illusion is too Exciting!Su Shi sensed that something was wrong with Cen Yiren.Having a pure heart?Have no desires?She was clearly h*rny!\u201cBut why did she see me in her illusion? Isn\u2019t the only thing in her heart the Demon Empress?\u201d\u201cThis idiot Senior Sister likes me?\u201dSu Shi shuddered and shook his head vigorously.Although Cen Yiren\u2019s appearance and figure were perfect, this did not change the fact that she was a violent maniac!Terrifying.Too terrifying!After a while, Cen Yiren\u2019s eyes returned to clarity, and her mind escaped the illusion.Her body was dazed, as if her legs were weak.\u201cThis illusion is too real!\u201dShe covered her hot pretty face, her racing heart yet to subside.\u201cSister Cen?\u201d\u201cUm?\u201dLooking back, she saw Su Shi holding her shoulders and looking at her coldly, \u201cWhat did you see in that illusion?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCen Yiren rolled her eyes and said solemnly: \u201cI saw the Demon Empress preach, heard the voice of the Great Dao, and my cultivation increased by leaps and bounds, directly breaking through the Nascent Soul Realm!\u201dSu Shi sneered, \u201cReally?\u201dCen Yiren furrowed her brows and said angrily, \u201cAlas, I\u2019m a person who has a pure heart and has no worldly desires, and I\u2019m so obsessed with cultivation that even the illusory realm is too boring \u2026\u201dSu Shi suddenly asked, \u201cWhat is my figure?\u201dCen Yiren gave a thumbs up, \u201cExcellent!\u201dThe atmosphere was so awkward.Cen Yiren\u2019s cheeks were as red as tomatoes, and she lowered her head, hoping to find a hole in the ground to hide.Su Shi gritted his teeth and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Senior Sister Cen to be coveting me all the time!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201dCen Yiren was embarrassed and angry, but she didn\u2019t know how to refute it.She also didn\u2019t understand why she was doing this.I clearly hate this person\u2026Su Shi wondered, \u201cThen how did you get up?\u201dCen Yiren twitched briefly, then whispered: \u201cSince you called me little darling, I knew it was fake, you bastard wouldn\u2019t be so gentle with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I beat your dog\u2019s head to a pulp!\u201dShu Shi frowned wildly.What a violent girl!First they need to move on to the next stage.Although they know that this is an illusory realm, there is no way to obtain inheritance unless they ascend the heavenly ladder.People have no other choice but to accept it. The first few hurdles are tests of talent, control and insight.This one, on the other hand, is a test of will!Only those with strong minds will be able to attain the Dao!The clearer your mind, the easier it is for you to reach the top of the ladder. But how many people can do it?Zhan Qingchen and Chen Qingluan stepped onto the stairs one after another. Their expressions changed, sometimes shy, sometimes nervous, but after they regained their clarity, they both looked at Su Shi in unison.Su Shi frowned slightly.When Zhan Qingchen looked at him, it was understandable.But why was Chen Qingluan looking at him shyly?\u201cI feel something is wrong.\u201dSu Shi touched his nose, lifted his foot and stepped on the stone steps.The scene in front of him suddenly changed:He found that he was lying on a luxurious sofa, surrounded by phoenix-embroidered silk curtains, and the air was filled with a refreshing scent.He felt the breath of someone nearby.He slowly turned his head to look, and found a woman lying beside him.The exquisite pretty face is beautifully dreamy, a few strands of hair scattered in the gelatinous ears, like a fairy descending to earth, there is a kind of unreal beauty.\u201cDemon, Demon Empress?\u201dSu Shi froze.Although he knew this was an illusion, he should be seeing Zhan Qingchen, right? Why was he seeing the Netherworld Demon Empress instead?Yun Qiluo\u2019s eyelashes trembled slightly, and the moment she opened her eyes, it seemed like a river of stars turned.The red lips opened lightly, and the voice was soft and gentle: \u201cHusband, are you awake?\u201dSu Shi gulped.He now understood why Cen Yiren was so excited.This illusion\u2026It was too much exciting!Ye Xiao climbed up the heavenly ladder early.Taking a step, his eyes became dazed.Inside the illusion:He stood proudly at the peak of the Nine Realms, overlooking all living beings, taking lives and killing, awakening world power, and lying drunk on the knees of beautiful women.Just when he was drunk, coolness came from the jade pendant hanging around his neck, forcibly bringing him back to reality.This was the treasure Ye Xiao had obtained in a secret place.To be able to concentrate calmly and keep a clear mind at all times.Looking at the people struggling below, Ye Xiao showed a sneer.\u201cHmph, what can you compare me to when I am favored by the heavens?\u201dActually, he was indeed invincible in his luck.For the alchemy test, he was a sixth grade pill refiner, for the labyrinth test, he had the incense of breaking the formation to lead the way, and to to test his will, he had a treasure to stay awake.It was as if all the tests had been prepared for him!If not for Su Shi, all those opportunities would have already been his!\u201cDamned Su Shi\u2026\u201dAt this moment, a figure caught his attention.It was the mysterious girl in black.She regained consciousness very quickly, walking up the stairs one by one.Soon she would catch up with him!Ye Xiao frowned, \u201cWhat is this woman\u2019s origin?\u201dWith a sense of crisis, he did not dare to care anymore, turned around and climbed up.The higher the ladder, the stronger the hallucinogenic effect. Even if you know it\u2019s fake, you can\u2019t convince yourself subconsciously.The speed of the two of them is getting slower and slower.Puff!Ye Xiao knelt on the stone steps, his face was pale as paper, and he was panting heavily.Almost!He almost got lost in the illusion!The woman in black stood beside him, her legs trembled slightly, and sweat dripped down her temples, soaking her black veil.Although she had a special physique and mastered the illusion-breaking technique, she still felt a lot of pressure.\u201cAs expected of an ancient heritage!\u201d\u201cThe difficulty of this level is beyond imagination!\u201dLooking at the fairy palace faintly visible in the clouds, her eyes were full of longing and longing.There is only one-third of the distance left, but she has not dared to take the next step.If you fail, you will lose all your efforts!\u201cHas anyone actually made it to the top?\u201dThe woman in black looked a little shaken.Just then, there was the sound of footsteps behind them.The two looked back, their expressions instantly dull.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026.\u201dThey saw Su Shi\u2019s entire body blooming with golden light, emitting a peerless brilliance like the scorching sun.Carrying Cen Yiren on his shoulder, he strode upwards, barely pausing for a moment.This illusion had no effect on him!Su Shi passed by the two of them, with an indifferent expression and no squint, as if he wasn\u2019t even interested in seeing them.The black-clothed girl\u2019s pupils contracted.\u201cHe really brought someone with him?\u201dThe staircase effect is superimposed. If you insist on bringing someone with you, you will be under twice the pressure!How does this person do it?\u201cUnder such a strong illusion, he can still maintain his original mind and not be affected.

    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 \u2013 Su Shi becomes a porter, Ye Xiao vomits blood!\u201cPut me down!\u201dCen Yiren gritted her teeth and took out her claws.Although she knew Su Shi was helping her, but this was too embarrassing!\u201cShut up!\u201dSu Shi looked impatient, raised his hand and slapped her b\u00f9tt.Slap!The world fell silent for a moment.\u201cYou, how dare you hit me!\u201dCen Yiren\u2019s pretty face turned red, she was embarrassed and angry at the same time, but all she could do was bite his shoulder.\u201cYou bit again?\u201dSu Shi\u2019s face turned green.Slap!\u201cAahh!\u201dSlap!\u201c\u2026..\u201dBefore long, Cen Yiren was defeated, and lay on Su Shi\u2019s shoulders exhausted, and didn\u2019t even have the strength to lift a finger.In a weak voice she said, \u201cSu Shi, you\u2019re bullying me\u2026\u201dSu Shi was too lazy to respond.The Unsurpassed Golden Body rotated to an extreme level as he walked with firm steps.The heart was like a clear mirror, and the mind was hard as a rock, so what if the illusion was strong?Under the blessing of Heavenly-grade Mystical Ability, all false illusions were shattered, dream bubbles burst with a single touch, not a single illusion could stop him!Stepping on the last heavenly staircase, all those illusions instantly vanished.In front of him was a magnificent palace.With a magnificent red door with a golden roof, bright pillars that seemed to clang with bells, singing melodious music in the air, and gilded tiles that shone brightly in the sunlight. It was like an immortal palace!\u201cWhat a marvelous sight!\u201dCeng Yiren gazed at the palace in awe, \u201cIs this, the final inheritance?\u201dSu Shi looked indifferent, put her down, turned around and walked downstairs.Cen Yiren was surprised for a moment, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dSu Shi did not look back, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m just going for a walk.\u201d\u201cWhat?Cen Yiren was confused.Just as she was about to follow, she suddenly turned red and placed her hand on her butt.\u201cUgh~\u201d\u201cIt hurts!\u201d\u2026\u2026At the heavenly stairs.Ye Xiao knelt on the stone steps with an dumbfounded expression on his face.\u201cImpossible!\u201cHow can he be faster than me!\u201dThis god-level illusion is so strong that even if he has a treasure, it is difficult to resist, but Su Shi is like walking on the ground!Why?He could not accept this fact.Ye Xiao gritted his teeth and let out a growl that wouldn\u2019t come out of his throat.At this moment, footsteps sounded again, but this time from above.The two looked up suspiciously.They saw Su Shi pass by them and step down!\u201cGo, go down~?\u201dYe Xiao was dumbfounded.This test was clearly heading towards the sky, why would this person want to go in the opposite direction?\u201cCould it be\u2026\u201dThe woman in black thought of something, and an dumbfounded look flashed in her eyes.After a while.Su Shi turned around again, carrying a moon-white figure on his shoulders.\u201cSu Shi, let me go!\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s cheeks turned red, and she didn\u2019t dare to look up.Su Shi smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everyone is in the illusion, and they can\u2019t see anything.\u201dFertilizer water must not flow into other people\u2019s fields.1In this test, you will only get a reward if you reach the top within a limited time.Of course, there\u2019s no way to give that opportunity to outsiders.Ye Xiao\u2019s expression was dull.\u201cDoes he still have time to help others?\u201dBefore he could regain his senses, Su Shi ran down the stairs and carried Chen Qingluan up!\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe air became deathly quiet.Ye Xiao was paralyzed on the ground, his face deathly pale, as if he was a defeated dog.He had a special treasure to support, yet road to the sky was still difficult.But Su Shi was like a porter, not only was he the first to reach the top, but he also brought others to the top!The gap between them was like clouds and mud!Ye Xiao\u2019s heart turned pale. With defeat after defeat and being crushed by his opponent, his confidence as the Son of Destiny was completely shattered.Su Shi was like a huge mountain pressing down on him.\u201cYou have a grudge against Su Shi?\u201dAt this moment, the woman in black asked loudly.Ye Xiao was silent for a moment, then gritted his teeth and said, \u201cI have a deep hatred towards him!\u201dThe woman in black gave him a pitying look, as if she was looking at a dead person, \u201cBe a good person in your next life.\u201dAfter saying that, she started walking.\u201cYou!\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s face turned red. Anger, hatred, cynicism and shame\u2026.All sorts of emotions rushed into his heart, when the fire reached his heart, he unexpectedly spurted out a mouthful of blood!\u201cI can\u2019t accept it!\u201d\u2026..Cloud Platform.The women looked at each other with blank faces.The few people who had reached the top were now all carried by Su Shi.Cen Yiren asked in a low voice, \u201cWhy did you bring the enemy with you?\u201dObviously we are already in the lead, isn\u2019t this just causing trouble?Su Shi said solemnly: \u201cI have a bad feeling that there may be danger in a while, and more people feel safer.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dCen Yiren cupped her chin.Even with her simple mind, she could sense that there was something fishy going on here.Suddenly a bold idea appeared in her mind, but then she shook her head in denial.\u201cHow could it be \u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dZhan Qingchen and Chen Qingluan stood together. The two had lots of thoughts in their hearts, bowing their heads, neither dared to look at the other.\u201cCough.\u201dZhan Qingchen cleared her throat and playing dumb: \u201cI don\u2019t know what Su Shi is thinking, why did he bring us?\u201dChen Qingluan shook her head, \u201cI don\u2019t understand either.\u201dA moment of silence.Zhan Qingchen said, \u201cBut he shouldn\u2019t have any bad intentions.\u201dChen Qingluan nodded, \u201cWell, I think so too.\u201d\u201cBy the way, what did you see in the illusion?\u201d\u201c\u2026I-I was practicing the sword, what about you?\u201d\u201cI was meditating.\u201dBoth of their jade cheeks flushed slightly.They were telling the truth, but it was not complete.One was practicing the sword with Su Shi, and the other was meditating in Su Shi\u2019s arms.\u2026\u2026Half an incense stick later.The girl in black also climbed onto the platform.She was bathed in sweat and her body swayed slightly, obviously her spirit was greatly depleted.She took out a pill and swallowed it.Then sat cross-legged and started meditating.Another half stick of incense.With one hand on the edge, Ye Xiao struggled to climb up.He shouldn\u2019t be this bad.In the beginning, he was bullied by Su Shi, and his temper peaked when talking to the woman in black to the point of vomiting blood.His breathing was heavy and irregular.Even with the special treasure blessing, he was still almost lost in illusion.Ye Xiao glanced at Shu Shi, and a trace of fear flashed in his eyes.If the other party attacked now, he had absolutely no strength to fight back!But Su Shi was just watching from the sidelines and didn\u2019t seem interested in him at all.Ye Xiao let out a sigh of relief.At the same time, he felt something bit off.With Su Shi\u2019s character, would he miss such a good opportunity?The air rippled, and thunder sounded:[Six people made it to the top, and the rest were eliminated.]The heavenly staircase disappeared instantly.The four people who were still struggling instantly fell.They turned into streams of clouds and mist and were sent outside the secret realm.[Anyone who reaches the top within a stick of incense will be rewarded with an infusion of spiritual power.]Four golden lights fell from the sky and were projected on the top four people who reached the peak.Those people\u2019s bodies floated into the air, as if they were enlightened, and their breath rose rapidly as if they were sitting on flying swords!They were all the heavenly pride of Golden Elixir Realm, under the infusion of raging spirit Qi, they directly broke through to the Middle Stage of Golden Elixir Realm!The sound of thunder rang out again:[The first person to ascend to the peak, and withstand the strongest illusion, will be rewarded with a double spiritual power infusion.]Hum~A soft voice.The golden light that enveloped Su Shi became strong and dazzling.His robes fluttered, his qi surged, his blood surged like a river, and his body roared like a bell!After a long time, the golden light disappeared.Su Shi slowly fell from the air.Feeling the surging spiritual power in his body, the corners of his mouth couldn\u2019t help but smile.It was the Late Stage of Golden Elixir Realm!1. Profits must not fall to outsiders.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 \u2013 So you are in the same group from the start!Su Shi himself didn\u2019t even expect it.There is a \u201chidden reward\u201d?He\u2019s not only the first to reach the top, but also bearing the strongest illusion.These conditions were harsh.But along with that, the rewards were also extremely impressive!Directly letting him ignore the shackles and break through two small realms in a row!What\u2019s more, his spiritual power had been tempered and was extremely pure without the slightest impurity, so even though he broke through quickly, his foundation was still solid and strong.A true Late Stage of Golden Elixir Realm!Feeling the power surging in his body, the corners of Su Shi\u2019s mouth twitched slightly.Late Stage of Golden Elixir was twenty years old?Not only was there no one in the past, but there would most likely never be any comers in the future!The girls looked at Su Shi with sparkling eyes.If not for Su Shi\u2019s help, even if some of them could reach the peak, the speed would not be this fast.To some extent-This was the opportunity Su Shi gave them!Zhan Qingchen had a light smile in her eyes.\u201cThis bad guy, in order not to arouse suspicion, even brought Qingluan along with him?\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s face was slightly red.\u201cSu Shi was so bold, he almost got spotted by Qingchen!\u201dCen Yiren lowered her head.\u201cAlthough this bad guy likes to bully people, but this time I really owe him\u2026\u201dThe three of them had completely different thoughts\u2026The despair in Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes deepened.Su Shi broke through again.Originally, their strength was not comparable as opponents, but now the gap between them was widening, and a sense of helplessness rose in his heart.\u201cNo, I can\u2019t give up, I still have a chance\u2026\u201dAt the same time, system prompt sounded in Su Shi\u2019s ears:[Chen Qingluan has made a decision, influenced the next plot trend and gained 10 plot points][Cen Yiren underwent an inner transformation, influenced the next plot trend, and gained 10 plot points.][Ye Xiao was depressed and his luck decreased, which affected the next plot trend and gained 20 plot points.]Su Shi couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.He accidentally harvested plot point again and again.Originally, he just wanted to help them, but he didn\u2019t expect that he would be the biggest beneficiary.Not only did he break through two small realms in a row, but he also gained 40 plot points![Do you want to learn a special technique: \u201cTrue Dragon Qi Perceiving Technique\u201d?]\u201cSure!\u201dSu Shi did not hesitate at all.Although this technique could not directly increase combat power, its effect was not comparable to any cultivation technique!The pages of the ancient book automatically turned, and words appeared in the air, and finally turned into bright light and entered between his eyebrows.The world in Su Shi\u2019s eyes suddenly changed!He saw as if mist was all around him, and his eyes were filled with colorful \u201cqi\u201d.Perceiving Technique.Through seeing the yin and yang aura, we can seek good fortune and avoid bad luck, and guess fate.The higher your cultivation realm, the clearer you can see it, and you can even reverse your life line if you cultivate to the depths!Su Shi\u2019s eyes swept over the people.Everyone looked bright and prosperous.They were heavenly prides, they were favored by fate, and their luck naturally far surpassed ordinary people.At the sight of Ye Xiao, Su Shi\u2019s eyes stopped slightly.He saw that the other party\u2019s face was dim, and there was a faint black mist going on, it was a sign of defeat!Recalling System Prompt:\u00a0Ye Xiao was depressed and his luck decreased.Su Shi shook his head and sneered.It seemed that stage after stage in this test had dealt a huge blow to Ye Xiao, and he even began to doubt himself.\u201cHis mind is not strong, his will is weak, and to fall down just because of a slight setback, he dares to call himself Son of Destiny?\u201dThere was no sympathy in Su Shi\u2019s eyes, only a frosty coldness!If Ye Xiao gained strength, he would only be worse than this!The other party would only move to kill him, and that was a foregone conclusion!At this moment, the sound of thunder rang out:[What is the existence of an immortal path when everything is illusory?]There seemed to be a hint of self-deprecation in its voice.And then there was complete silence.\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201dEveryone was a little surprised.There was no order or inheritance, just a small poem with no beginning and no end.This made them a little confused for a while.Looking at the immortal palace in front of her, Zhan Qingchen pondered: \u201cCould it be it wants us to enter the palace to find it ourselves?\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201dChen Qingluan stepped forward and pushed it, and the red door remained motionless.There was no response even with the use of spiritual power.\u201cCan\u2019t be opened.\u201dChen Qingluan frowned slightly.Ye Xiao showed a sneer, and secretly said in his heart:\u00a0\u201cOf course you can\u2019t open it! Without me, no one can have the inheritance!\u201dSuddenly, he found that Su Shi\u2019s eyes were funny, as if he had seen it completely.\u201cYe Xiao, what are you waiting for?\u201dYe Xiao was stunned, \u201cYou, what do you mean by that?\u201dSu Shi said indifferently: \u201c You entered Tianqu Mountain first, and you are fully prepared for every stage. Obviously, you know this inheritance very well. You should be the only one who can open this gate, right?\u201dYe Xiao had corresponding breaking methods for almost every stage, including alchemy, formation breaking, and illusions.This was definitely not a coincidence.Ye Xiao came prepared!Everyone moved slightly and surrounded Ye Xiao in the center.\u201cChief Zhan? Censor Chen? You guys\u2026\u201dSeeing their indifferent expressions, Ye Xiao finally realized, \u201cSo you guys have been colluding with this demon from the start!\u201dRidiculous!Originally, he wanted to utilize the number of people to drive away the demon Su Shi first.He didn\u2019t expect to be the target of these people instead!Except for him, these people were all one gang!Ye Xiao\u2019s face was pale.One Su Shi could leave him breathless, and with these top talents, what else could he do to turn the situation around?His expression changed, and he gritted his teeth: \u201cI can open the door, but this final inheritance must be mine, otherwise, I would rather leave this secret world!\u201d\u201cIn your dream\u2013\u201dBefore Cen Yiren finished speaking, she saw Su Shi nodding and said, \u201cOkay, I promise.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201dYe Xiao frowned, \u201cYou won\u2019t tell me to come back after opening the door, will you?\u201dSu Shi said indifferently: \u201cAnyway, I have enough opportunities, so it doesn\u2019t matter whether there is a final inheritance or not. It\u2019s up to you whether you want to open it or not, but I will kill you if you choose the latter.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s that simple.\u201dHe did not expect that the other party would say it so straightforwardly.Ye Xiao was silent for a while.Su Shi might not care much about the latter\u2019s inheritance, but he couldn\u2019t possibly let him have it either!Besides, with Su Shi\u2019s ruthless temperament, he would never let him leave alive!Must fight!Ye Xiao stood up and walked to the palace gate.He took out a golden ring and slowly stuffed it into the mouth of the beast head at the door.The horrible beast head seemed to come back to life, and two dim lights flashed in its eyes.Ye Xiao muttered an incoherent incantation and pulled the door knocker hard.Boom!With a dull loud noise, the red door slowly opened.The divine light shone, and there seemed to be countless treasures inside!The long quiet thunder sounded again:The long silent thunder sounded again:[All sorts of spirit and mystical treasures are all gathered in the Immortal Palace]1[Enter the Immortal Palace and gain immortality!]Finally the final inheritance begins!1. This poem contains idioms, each of which is very confusing to translate, but the point is that there are many treasures there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 \u2013 Ancient Emperor\u2019s Inheritance, who wants it?The gates of the Immortal Palace opened in front of them.Spiritual light shone brightly inside, immortal auras were everywhere, it seemed to contain endless treasures, and there was a faint musical voice calling for people to walk into it.Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes were very greedy.All sorts of spirit and mystical treasures are all gathered in the Immortal Palace.Enter the Immortal Palace and gain immortality!According to that voice of thunder, within this Immortal Palace are the legacies of ancient emperors, containing the laws of immortality!What cultivator could resist such a treasure?But he didn\u2019t dare to make any rash moves, and his eyes looked towards the upright figure.Su Shi!The Immortal Palace has opened, yet he lost his right to speak, and now the situation is completely controlled by this demon!If the other party really intended to kill him\u2026Ye Xiao quietly took a few steps back.Su Shi stood with his hands behind his back, looking at the luxurious palace in front of him, his eyes deep-wise.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAfter saying that, he raised his foot and stepped into the palace gate.The people followed behind.Ye Xiao breathed a sigh of relief and followed them in, keeping a safe distance.Opportunity was important, but it was not worth his life!Entering the palace.The hall is white and bright, reflecting the light of crystal pearls, and it is so delicate and illusory like flowers in the clouds, that it is difficult to tell whether it is a reflection or reality.The clouds flowed under their feet and the roof was carved with golden dragons.It was so luxurious, as if it was really the Immortal Palace!On a tall golden dragon throne, a man sat.Clad in golden armor, wearing a beaded curtain hat and holding a large, sharp, and incomparable sword in his hand, he was a king who looked down on the world!\u201c This is\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone was stunned.Unexpectedly, there is still someone living in this Immortal Palace!Ye Xiao\u2019s breath was slightly short, \u201cCould this be the legendary Emperor Hanjiang? He\u2019s actually still alive!\u201dAncient Emperor Li Hanjiang. The immortal ruler who trampled the world under his feet. He had leveled mountains and rivers for 90,000 miles and conquered the world for hundreds of years!Such a powerful person has inexplicably disappeared, and no one in the world can find the slightest trace of him.Some people said he had died in seclusion, and some people said he had ascended to the upper realm.No one had expected him to appear before their eyes at this moment!Ye Xiao got the key to open that gate by chance, and learned that the ancient emperor\u2019s inheritance was about to be opened.Now that he saw it with his own eyes, his blood was almost boiling!A majestic voice resounded:\u201cTo be able to enter the Immortal Palace and see this Emperor, one must have the talent, perseverance, and incomparability to be as solid as a rock.\u201dThe ancient emperor slowly raised his head.He was under a beaded curtain hat, they couldn\u2019t see his face clearly, but they could still feel his torch-like gaze:\u201cHoly-grade perfect? This is truly rare.\u201dHe referred to Su Shi.Su Shi\u2019s expression was calm, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, compared to my good looks, my talent is only average.\u201d\u201c???\u201dEveryone was almost dumbfounded.His words were too presumptuous!The one sitting in front of them was the ancient Emperor!The ancient Emperor was slightly speechless.He didn\u2019t seem to know how to answer.The beaded curtain swayed, and the voice came again:\u201cThis is fate, I will give you the final inheritance.\u201dThe ancient emperor stretched out his hand and seemed to call out to him.Ye Xiao lowered his head and clenched his fists hard.This was really the Hanjiang Ancient Emperor\u2019s inheritance!Not to mention the entire inheritance, just a little leaking from the cracks of the fingers is enough to cultivate into the immortal realm!The malice and unwillingness in his heart was burning, almost devouring Ye Xiao!However, Su Shi\u2019s answer shocked him.\u201cI always keep my promises, I will give this inheritance to someone else.\u201dGive it to someone else?Everyone was stunned.Had Su Shi gone mad?The ancient emperor seemed a little displeased: \u201cPresumptuous! My supreme inheritance, how can you so easily pass it on to someone else!\u201dSu Shi shrugged and said guiltlessly, \u201cI don\u2019t want it anyway, you can give it to whoever wants it.\u201d\u201cI want it!\u201dYe Xiao shouted loudly.He knelt down and kowtowed before the ancient emperor, \u201cYour Majesty, my emperor, you who have ruled for centuries! I am willing to accept your inheritance!\u201dHis words were incoherent, for fear that Su Shi would retract his words!\u201cThis idiot!\u201dThe black-clothed woman was also a little nervous.But she still kept her sanity, and her instincts told her that something was wrong!The ancient emperor was silent for a long time, sighing, \u201cForget it, I will give it to you.\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s face was red and excited!Su Shi\u2019s eyes were very deep.Can the inheritance really be passed to someone else?He was not stupid!Under the blessing of the True Dragon Qi Perceiving Technique, the ancient Emperor in his eyes was filled with a strong aura of death!The black mist billowed, and the atmosphere of death billowed like clouds, covering the sky and the sun!Holy fuck!This is definitely an ancient undead!Seeing the ancient emperor\u2019s palm caressing Ye Xiao\u2019s forehead, Su Shi whispered: \u201cGet ready!\u201dZhan Qingchen and the others saw that something was wrong long ago, and they all stood beside him and waited.Boom!Just as a palm pressed on Ye Xiao\u2019s forehead, a thick black mist instantly engulfed the two!\u201cAaaaah!\u201dThe sound of a beast roar boomed out accompanied by Ye Xiao\u2019s heartbreaking shrieks within that black mist.The girl in black shivered and looked at Su Shi in surprise.Could it be\u2026.\u201cHe\u2019s even counting this?\u201dAfter an unknown amount of time, the shouting stopped abruptly.The black mist gradually dissipated, revealing a ferocious and terrifying monster!The tens of meters high body is composed of black mist, like a rolling and boiling swamp, and the four powerful arms are waving, and the appearance is extremely terrifying!The face that was originally blocked by the beaded curtain hat is now clearly visible.That is Ye Xiao!The monster\u2019s voice was deafening, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that I can\u2019t get the perfect body of the Holy-grade perfect.\u201dRed eyes stared at Su Shi, the greed and unwillingness in his eyes were not hidden!Cen Yiren said with difficulty: \u201cThis, this doesn\u2019t look like an ancient emperor!\u201d\u201cWho said it was an ancient emperor?\u201dSu Shi\u2019s eyes were cold, \u201cThe ancient emperor\u2019s inheritance ended after climbing the stairs!\u201dEverything was an illusion, so there was no way that the treasure of immortality existed.The sound of thunder had already said it clearly:[What is the existence of an immortal path when everything is illusory?]As for that thing in front of them, it\u2019s just a demon occupying a magpie\u2019s nest!No one can get out without killing it!This was also the reason why Su Shi kept Ye Xiao!\u201cRoar!\u201dThe roar resounded in the hall, and the voices of Ye Xiao and the monster overlapped, \u201cSu Shi, damn you!\u201dCrazy killing intent brought the temperature down to freezing!Although Ye Xiao had lost consciousness, the hatred towards Su Shi in his heart was completely aroused!Clang!Chen Qingluan\u2019s face was extremely cold, and Autumn Water came out of its sheath, \u201cTianyi Sect Waste, I want to kill you for a long time!\u201d\u201cDie!\u201dHer body shot out like lightning.Cen Yiren carried the big sword, jumped up, and smashed the monster in the face!Zhan Qingchen\u2019s robe flew up, and the divine light was as bright as the scorching sun!And Su Shi\u2026He was rummaging through the boxes and cabinets on the side.Even the dragon-carved eyeballs on the pillars were prying.The girl in black frowned and said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cLooting treasures, don\u2019t you see?\u201dSu Shi didn\u2019t look back and said, \u201cAlthough this ancient emperor is fake, this palace is real, and if you pay attention, everything is antique!\u201dThe black-clothed woman looked at the fighting people, \u201cYou\u2026 are you not nervous at all?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a monster, it can wait for later.\u201d\u201cSince I brought them, the monster won\u2019t be able to do anything for a while.\u201dSu Shi pointed at her feet and said, \u201cExcuse me please, this carpet seems to be a spirit treasure.\u201dThe woman in black swallowed.Apparently, this person was an actual monster!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 \u2013 Let\u2019s watch the meteor shower together!Looking at Su Shi who was rummaging through the box, the black-clothed girl\u2019s eyes flickered.He had a strong and ruthless personality, and he could take advantage of every opportunity he had. His determination was very strong and could even ignore the heavenly staircase test.Even in the face of the ancient emperor\u2019s inheritance, he still remained calm and sharp.Although the girl in black seemed displeased with him, she had to admit that this man was the strongest of all the geniuses she had ever seen.Not one of them!His strength, temperament, and talent were all perfect. It was as if he was a behemoth covering the sky with one hand!However, such an image was completely nowhere to be found at the moment\u2026But the girl in black showed no disdain.As a Peerless Genius of the demonic path, he should have inexhaustible resources, but he did not miss the slightest opportunity to improve himself!This man was the most terrifying!\u201cBeing his enemy should be miserable, right?\u201d\u2026.For some reason, this idea suddenly appeared in his mind.As everyone knew, Su Shi didn\u2019t think much at all.Although the final inheritance was fake, the Immortal Palace itself had an extraordinary origin. It should be one of the Ancient Emperor\u2019s Palaces. Even some of the decorations were high-level spiritual treasures of excellent quality.It would be a waste if it wasn\u2019t utilized!Even if he couldn\u2019t use it himself, he could give it to Zhan Qingchen and Bai Qing.\u201cUnfortunately, he\u2019s not a real Ancient Emperor, so there are no Legendary Heavenly Treasures\u2026\u201dAt this point, Su Shi noticed something.He saw a simple wooden box lying silently under the gold-carved dragon chair.He reached for it.After opening it, there was an unknown ancient book inside.Opening it casually, it was full of complicated ancient seals, and Su Shi didn\u2019t even know a single word.Suddenly, a system prompt sounded in his ears.[Acquire Cultivation Method: The Great Harmony of the Nine Revolution Elements of Heaven and Earth, can be obtained automatically by consuming 300 plot points]Su Shi was first surprised by such a long name.Then he was confused by the huge amount of points.\u201cThree hundred points? That\u2019s too expensive!\u201dSu Shi was slightly stunned.There were many expensive cultivation methods in the store, and the price even reached 1,000 points, but that included the value of the cultivation technique itself.If it was a cultivation method he obtained himself, the plot points required were relatively cheap to learn it.The \u201cTrue Dragon Qi Perceiving Technique\u201d for example, only required 40 plot points.But this mysterious technique actually required a full 300 points!\u201cThe origin of this cultivation method is definitely not simple!\u201dSu Shi took the ancient book into his arms.Although he still could not learn it now, there was still tomorrow to fulfill dreams.The monster fighting with everyone noticed this scene, and suddenly let out a piercing scream: \u201cPut it down, that\u2019s my treasure!\u201dBoom!The monster opened its huge mouth and suddenly took a breath, and its body grew rapidly as if it was inflated.The black energy in the four big hands condensed, forming the shapes of swords, axes, and tomahawks.The spiritual power surged, and it was invincible!Everyone was forced back by the pressure of that spiritual power.Chen Qingluan frowned slightly.The strength of this monster was not too strong, but it was extremely difficult to deal with. That black energy was truly unbearable, my sword slash barely had any effect on it.Even if the creature was cut into pieces, it would quickly reorganize itself.Only Zhan Qingchen\u2019s Daoism technique could cause great damage.But because of its huge body the Daoism technique was clearly not enough.\u201cThis is really troublesome\u2026\u201dAt this moment, Su Shi\u2019s voice rang out: \u201cThank you for your hard work.\u201dThey saw him walk slowly to the front of the monster, looked at Ye Xiao\u2019s hideous pale face, and said lightly, \u201cLet me put an end to all this.\u201d\u201cSu Shi!\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s voice was sharp and hoarse, \u201cBastard, I want to crush you!\u201dSu Shi\u2019s eyes were indifferent, \u201cYou only have the courage to say such things through a monster body, right?\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dPiercing Ye Xiao\u2019s pain point, it seemed to hit the nail on the head, the monster instantly swung its sword!The raging demon aura was wrapped in killing intent, and the powerful spiritual energy pressure made the spine cold!Zhan Qingchen exclaimed: \u201cSu Shi, be careful!\u201dSu Shi\u2019s expression did not change, and he took a step forward.The world was suddenly quiet.The movement of the monster seemed to slow down many times.The dome above the palace disappeared, revealing an endless cosmic void, where dazzling galaxies spun and shone!The monster looked up, his body trembled slightly, and its voice seemed amazed, \u201c The power of the stars? You actually comprehended the full power of the stars?!\u201dHow could it be!Even if he was a Holy-grade perfect genius, he was only at the Golden Elixir Realm!Su Shi raised his right hand, palm facing the sky.A giant star approached quickly, hovering above the monster\u2019s head, and the breath of cosmic vastness made people tremble!\u201cSon of Destiny?\u201d\u201cToday, I will bury you, with your destiny, together!\u201dThe palm pressed down suddenly.Mystical Ability \u2013 Shooting Stars!Boom!The earth collapses!\u201cNo!\u201dThe monster tried to raise its hand to resist, but was instantly annihilated into flying ash!The black energy wanted to reorganize again, but the cosmic shone brightly, and the second star fell quickly!The third!The fourth!The hem of Su Shi\u2019s clothes fluttered, his black hair danced wildly like a snake, and the spiritual energy of the Late Stage od Golden Elixir Realm rotated to an extreme level!The stars fell with a tail of blazing flames!The entire palace trembled violently, and the luxurious palace instantly turned into ruins\u2026It\u2019s like the end of the world!Looking at the violent meteor shower in front of them, everyone standing there was dumbfounded.Was this really the power of the Golden Elixir Realm?The girl in black swallowed.No wonder this guy wasn\u2019t in a hurry\u2026It turned out that he was so powerful!\u201cWhen I home I must tell the sect not to offend this person!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s scary!\u201dBoom!With the last star falling, that black aura had completely disappeared.Su Shi\u2019s face paled slightly.Although this Mystical Ability was powerful, it also consumed a lot of spiritual energy.If not for the support of the Heavenly Sutra, he might not have been able to reach this level.The Shooting Star was a Mystical Ability that he had comprehended, yet its power was difficult to measure at the level of use.With his cultivation level now, he could only imitate a trace of the star\u2019s power.If he could comprehend the Dao and ascend to Immortal, he could even pull the stars from the nine heavens and inflict real destruction on the world!The smoke was gone.Ye Xiao was lying on the broken wall, his face was like worn paper, he was dying, and blood kept flowing out of his mouth.There was a black reptile beside him, crawling away with difficulty.Blue flames blazed, the reptile turned into ashes.At that moment a system prompt sounded:[The host killed the \u201cAncient Emperor Heart Louse\u201d, affecting the next plot trend, earning 20 plot points].This monster is actually a stray mind in the heart of the ancient emperor, who gained enlightenment after countless years of spiritual power accumulated.\u201cA mere flea dares to pretend to be the emperor, trying to take over my body?\u201dSu Shi shook his head.Walking in front of Ye Xiao, he stared at the \u201cSon of Destiny\u201d.The power of the magical force was absorbed by the monsters, Ye Xiao was able to survive, but he almost died from serious injuries.\u201cSu Shi, you can\u2019t kill me!\u201d\u201cI, I\u2019m Chief Disciple of Tianyi Sect, if you dare to touch me, Righteous path won\u2019t let you go!\u201dYe Xiao looked terrified, and his voice was hoarse.Su Shi was about to speak when a beep sounded in his ear again:[Yun Qiluo destroyed the \u201cTianyi Sect\u201d, which affected the next plot trend and got 30 plot points.]Su Shi was stunned for a moment, then smiled brightly.\u201cTelling you the bad news, Tianyi Sect has just become history.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 \u2013 Son of Destiny Killer! Destruction of the Secret Realm!When Su Shi heard the prompt, he was also slightly stunned.Tianyi was destroyed by the Demon Empress?Although Tianyi was a Righteous Sect, it was not a good thing in reality. From the bottom to the top, they did all sorts of shady things behind the scenes.This was evident from the fact that the sect residence was chosen as a brothel.In the plot of the novel:Tianyi Sect was just the first stepping stone for Ye Xiao, who left after gaining enough benefits, and finally he discovered the dark side of the sect, then ruthlessly destroyed \u201chis own family\u201d with a great move of justice, which reflected the greatness of the protagonist\u2019s personality.Thus, even if the Demon Emperor did not destroy Tianyi Sect, it would eventually be destroyed by Ye Xiao, the \u201cheir\u201d.\u201cBut of course Demon Empress didn\u2019t do it for the sake of justice, she attacked for only one reason \u2026\u2026\u201dBefore entering Tianqu Mountain, a guest official from Tianyi Sect moved against Su Shi and was killed by Saint Feng Zhongque.This had apparently offended the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect.Yun Qiluo wanted to make a reckoning!From now on, apart from the powerhouses, there would be no one from the Righteous path who dared to touch Su Shi!Ye Xiao frowned, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dSu Shi shrugged, \u201cA moment ago, the Demon Empress trampled Tianyi Sect, your sect no longer exists.\u201d\u201cHuh, don\u2019t lie to me, how can\u2013\u201dThe words suddenly stopped.Ye Xiao stared stupidly at the broken jade pendant on his wrist.It was a spiritual jade that his Protector kept nearby so that he could sense his location in times of crisis, but now it had been shattered into pieces for no reason!His Protector had died!So Su Shi didn\u2019t lie \u2026\u2026It was destroyed in just one day!Ye Xiao panicked, and a mouthful of blood gushed out, his face turning pale.Seeing the almost substantial death aura, Su Shi groaned softly, and said lightly, \u201cYou think luck will be on your side this time?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t kill me, I have a great chance! I know many hidden secrets, as long as you don\u2019t kill me, I, I will tell you everything!\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s speech was unclear and his expression was frightened.Under the shadow of death, his psychological defenses completely collapsed.Su Shi shook his head indifferently, \u201cYou\u2019re noisy\u2026.\u201dSwish!Green frost flashed, sword qi spreading.Ye Xiao\u2019s neck was cold, and his expression was completely frozen on his face.\u201cImpossible \u2026\u2026 I am favored by Heaven \u2026\u2026 standing at the peak of the Nine Realms \u2026\u2026 I haven\u2019t \u2026\u2026\u201dConsciousness completely slipped into the abyss of darkness.A series of beeps sounded in Su Shi\u2019s ears:[The host has killed \u201cYe Xiao\u201d, significantly changing the plot trend, gaining 270 plot points.][Favored Son of Heavens has fallen, his fate has been reversed and his destiny has fallen.][The Host\u2019s wealth has increased, and the wealth of the current camp, \u201cNetherworld Rakshasa Sect\u201d, has increased.][The host has been given the title of \u201cSon of Destiny Killer\u201d.]\u201cOnly less than 300 plot points?\u201dSu Shi\u2019s brows sank slightly.This plot point seems to be quite a lot, but one should know that the other party is Ye Xiao!As the protagonist and Son of Destiny, doesn\u2019t he deserve a higher price?The top-grade technique in the store alone was worth 998 more!\u201cWhat a scammer!\u201dSu Shi secretly spat out.As if hearing his heart, the system responded:[The number of plot value rewards depends on the extent of the next plot change, the reincarnation of heavenly destiny does not stop, the Nine Realms are vast and boundless, keep working hard.]Su Shi understood what the system meant.Although Ye Xiao is the protagonist in this book, reality is not a novel, it does not revolve around one person, it is a real and cruel world.Even without Ye Xiao, the wheels of the Nine Realms would still continue to roll.Righteous force and Demonic force will still battle in the Central Plains.Feng Chaoge, Yun Qiluo, and Sikong Lanyue \u2026\u2026, the heaven-favored people would continue to dominate each other.What Su Shi must change is not just the plot, but the entire world!\u201cAlright, I already understand.\u201dSu Shi also didn\u2019t complain anymore.Aside from the plot points, he also gained other benefits.The thing is that luck was illusory, yet it affects everything invisibly.What appealed to Su Shi the most was the title \u201cSon of Destiny Killer\u201d.He looked at the details:[Son of Destiny\u2019s Assassin: When crossed with a \u201cDestined Character\u201d, physical and mental states are temporarily enhanced, including but not limited to: spiritual power operation speed, spiritual power recovery speed, physical body strength, blood strength, and willpower \u2026\u2026]Looking at the dense text in front of him, Su Shi couldn\u2019t help scratching his head.This status bar is too long!\u201cI can understand everything else \u2026\u2026 but what the heck is charisma enhancement!\u201dAt this moment, Chen Qingluan walked up to him.\u201cSu Shi, we have to-\u201dBefore she could finish her words, her entire body froze.She saw Su Shi\u2019s face handsome and unpretentious, his eyes looked like starlight in it, and his pupils were extremely deep when she looked at them, like a mysterious black hole for people to sink into.\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dSu Shi reached out and waved his hand in front of her.Chen Qingluan came back to her senses, her face faintly hot, her heart almost beating.\u201cDamn it!\u201d\u201cWhy is this guy getting better and better looking?\u201dShe had never cared about his looks, but now she couldn\u2019t get enough of Su Shi\u2019s face!\u201cKeep calm, this guy will only affect my sword cultivation!\u201dChen Qingluan took a deep breath and looked up, \u201cI said, we should go\u2026. no, you, you should turn your face away first.\u201dSu Shi: \u201c????\u201dAt that moment, the ground suddenly shook violently, and the entire palace shook.Boom!The dome collapsed violently!Only to see that the world outside quickly collapsed, revealing a pitch-black crack in the void.\u201cNot good, this place is going to collapse!\u201dSu Shi\u2019s face turned pale.There was no such episode in the book, could it be a chain reaction caused by killing heart louse?\u201cLet\u2019s go, there is an exit under the heavenly stairs!\u201dThe people left the palace with quick steps.The illusion attached to the stairs has disappeared, but the aura in the secret realm is so disturbed that it is impossible to fly in the air.This cloud peak is not a safe place, so they can\u2019t stay here for long!\u201cWe can only go down on foot.\u201dSu Shi said: \u201cYou guys go first, I\u2019ll hold it back!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it. \u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dThe girls scrambled to be the one to hold it back.Su Shi said impatiently, \u201cShut up!\u201dThe air immediately became quiet.At that moment, the girl in black said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it. \u2026\u2026\u201dSu Shi nodded, \u201cAlright, you can do it.\u201dThe girl in black laughed bitterly.This person was really indifferent.\u201cWithout using my spiritual power, my physical ability should be better than all of you.\u201dShe was not a compassionate Mother Earth.It was just that just now in the Immortal Palace, if Su Shi had not warned her, she might have actually left to fight for the \u2018Ancient Emperor\u2019s Inheritance\u2019.When she thought about Ye Xiao\u2019s terrifying appearance, she was still vaguely afraid.\u201cIt\u2019s just that if it wasn\u2019t for him, I might have become an ugly monster.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just say it\u2019s even!\u201dBoom!The secret realm is on the verge of collapse!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 \u2013 Your Fox Tail is Exposed!Boom!The Secret Realm fluctuated violently, the luxurious Immortal Palace had completely collapsed, and the platform under everyone\u2019s feet was covered with cobweb-like cracks.This place was already in danger, and no one knew when this place would be completely destroyed.\u201cWe can\u2019t linger any longer.\u201dSu Shi led them down the stairs.The sky below them shattered like glass, an abyss in the void that stretched through the air. If they fell into it, they would instantly be torn apart by the turbulence of the void!Chen Qingluan had a strong body, quick movements, and had been tempered by sword aura for many years. So even though she couldn\u2019t use spiritual power, her physical strength was far superior to ordinary cultivators.Not to be outdone, Cen Yiren followed closely behind. Zhan Qingchen wanted to keep up with their pace, but was stopped by Su Shi.\u201cYou are a Daoist Priestess, don\u2019t push yourself, follow me obediently.\u201dHe didn\u2019t care about avoiding suspicion at this point, and tightly pulled Zhan Qingchen\u2019s delicate hand.\u201cI understand.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s heart felt sweet as she followed Su Shi\u2019s lead. The black-clothed girl in charge of the back saw this scene and her eyes were slightly surprised.\u201cThe two of them really have that kind of relationship!\u201d\u201cOne is a genius of the Demonic path, the other is a genius of the Righteous path\u2026 Isn\u2019t this the forbidden love written in the books?\u201dDespite the differences between the Demonic faction and the Righteous faction, despite the opposition between their two sects, despite the world\u2019s strange look at them, they chose to fall in love with each other with determination \u2026\u2026This is so touching!In just a few seconds\u2026She already has a heart-wrenching and heartbreaking love story in mind.\u201c\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dSu Shi turned around in confusion.The black-clothed girl gave a thumbs up, \u201cI\u2019m rooting for you!\u201dSu Shi: \u201c????\u201dThey ran on the wobbly stairs. The high platform had collapsed, and the stone steps behind them continued to fall, swallowed up mercilessly by the void abyss below.\u201cAlmost there!\u201dOn the cliff at the end of the stairs, there was a white ball of light as tall as a person shining.It was a boundary gate that allowed one to leave this realm.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s green robe fluttered as she jumped onto the cliff.Looking back.She saw Su Shi holding Cen Yiren in one hand and Zhan Qingchen in the other, stepping on the green rocks and rising into the air, like an eagle.Seeing this scene, she couldn\u2019t help but regret a little in her heart.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t run so fast, wouldn\u2019t I also be grasped by Su Shi? Chen Qingluan, what are you thinking at a time like this~?\u201d\u201cBut I remember Qingchen hates men so much, why doesn\u2019t he seem too disgusted?\u201dThe two of them were led up the cliff by Su Shi.The white light of the boundary gate in front of them was extremely intense.It was the Ancient Emperor\u2019s legacy that kept everyone alive. Even the cultivators who were demilitarized earlier were all sent out safely.The reason for the collapse of the secret realm was mainly because of the heart louse.The Immortal Palace had collapsed and the Great Dao had fallen.Son of Destiny and that monster would be buried here forever.\u201cGetting out of here should be Tianqu Mountain.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThey immediately jumped into the boundary gate.But just as Su Shi was about to leave, an exclamation sounded from behind him.He turned his head to look, and his pupils instantly shrank!\u201cWatch out!\u201dThe girl in black was just about to jump onto the cliff when the stone steps shattered under her feet!Since there was no foothold, she fell down like a kite with a broken string.The black void below her was like the mouth of an abyss ready to devour a human.If she fell into it, there would be no bones left!\u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201dThe black-clothed girl looked desperate.At this moment, her spiritual power was in shambles, she couldn\u2019t fly in the air, and there was no one to help her, all she could do was resign herself to watching herself being devoured by the abyss!The next second.A strong hand seized her.The black-clothed girl looked up in confusion.She saw Su Shi\u2019s sword stabbing into the cliff, one hand gripping the hilt of the sword and the other hand hugging her tightly.Su Shi\u2019s face was gloomy, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you had strong physical strength?\u201dThe girl in black was slightly embarrassed, \u201cIt\u2019s accident, pure accident.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who volunteered to guard the back, but in the end I had to come rescue you myself.\u201dSu Shi had an unhappy face.But he still reached out and pulled her up.To prevent the girl from falling, his palm was naturally underneath her.\u201cHmm? This is \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dSu Shi seemed to have touched something, groping and squeezing, \u201cTail?!\u201dHe looked at the girl suspiciously. A breeze blew, revealing two small furry ears.\u201cSo you are a little fox.\u201dSu Shi was slightly amused.There was no mistaking it.The girl in black trembled, her eyes misty and her voice crying, \u201cNo, don\u2019t squeeze my tail!\u201dIt was over.Now she was found out.She hasn\u2019t completely transformed, she usually covers it with a spell to cover it up, but now her spiritual power is sealed, so her fox tail is naturally revealed.The girl in black wanted to die.Su Shi stifled his laughter as he stepped on the cliff and climbed up.The secret realm was on the verge of collapse, with black cracks like spider webs.As the two of them jumped onto the gate,Boom!The secret realm collapsed!Tianqu Mountain, inside a dense forest.The air rippled as two figures fell from the sky and landed on the ground with a thud.The girl in black let out a sigh of relief, \u201cThat was close. I was almost buried in the secret realm!\u201d\u201cBut from such a high place to fall, it actually didn\u2019t hurt at all?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you crushed me.\u201dThe girl in black looked down and saw that she was sitting on Su Shi.Her black veil had been blown away by the wind at that moment, and not a single stain could be found on her delicate and beautiful jade cheeks, and her empty eyes and fury ears had a strange beauty that was a mixture of innocence and charm.\u201cOh!\u201dThe girl in black got up in a panic and ran away to hide behind a tree as if she would not be seen.Su Shi shook his head.He had already guessed the identity of this little fox.When they first met, she acted so flamboyant, but in reality she was stupid and ignorant love brains.\u201cAlright, you can go alone. The Imperial Palace has no room for strangers in its eyes.\u201dHe said and then turned and left.The girl in black bit her lip.She had already thought of the worst consequences of her identity being exposed, but the other party just left?Looking at Su Shi\u2019s back, she whispered, \u201cThank you \u2026\u2026\u201dAlthough the process was a little embarrassing, but Su Shi managed to save her life.Thinking of what had just happened, the black-clothed girl\u2019s beautiful face flushed.\u201cThis venture into the hinterland of mankind, not only did I gain nothing, but I almost lost my life.\u201d\u201cMy tail was even snapped off\u2026\u201dShe hugged the tree trunk, looking desperate.\u201cNoooo, I\u2019m no longer pure~\u201dSu Shi meandered through the dense forest.The system prompt rang in his ears:[Yu Ren\u2019er underwent an inner transformation, affected the next plot, gained 10 plot points.]\u201cSure enough, she made it.\u201dOutsider Frontier.The northern border of Linlang Empire abuts the barbarian realm, and after the border is the outsider fiefdom.In recent years, the border competition has become more and more serious, and when the relationship between the two races is so tense, Yu Ren\u2019er still dares to come to the hinterland of Linlang Empire, she is too bold.At this moment, Su Shi sensed something and looked up sharply.In the distance, there was black vapor and a faint glow of blood.Bloody disaster!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 \u2013 Unfortunately, I have someone above me.Outside Tianqu Mountain.The diligent Imperial Guards are on standby, a 100-mile radius has been completely blocked off so that not even a fly can get out.Han Chen, commander of the Imperial Guards, stood with his arms folded.The deputy next to him reported with clasped hands.\u201cReporting to the commander, all cultivators who came out of the mountain have been detained. According to them, the opportunity is the ancient emperor\u2019s legacy.\u201d\u201cThe legacy of the ancient emperor?\u201dHan Chen frowned slightly, \u201cDid that Su Demon get it?\u201dThe deputy shook his head, \u201c Not sure, but Su Shi\u2019s skills are extraordinary, the probability of getting the last inheritance is very high.\u201dHaving a body with Holy-grade perfect talent made his potential limitless. If he gets the inheritance of the ancient emperor, who will be able to stop him in the future?Han Chen\u2019s gaze was heavy, \u201cThe birth of such a demon star is a great disaster for the Linlang Empire and should be strangled in the cradle!\u201d\u201cBut His Majesty only told us to blockade Tianqu Mountain.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think His Majesty wants to blockade the mountain?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dHan Chen sighed: \u201cThere are some things His Majesty can\u2019t say explicitly, but as an Imperial Guard, you should understand his intentions.\u201dThe deputy was enlightened.\u201cReport!\u201dAt this moment, a guard came running quickly, \u201cMy Lord, the demonic cultivator who was with Su Shi has been found!\u201d\u201cBring her here!\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dSeeing that the guard had a difficult expression, Han Chen was puzzled, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201dThe guard said, \u201cImperial Censor Chen and Chief Zhan are also there, they, they are obstructing this subordinate, this subordinate dare not take action, so I came to ask the commander for instructions.\u201d\u201cWhat do you say?\u201dHan Chen froze for a moment, \u201cTake me to see it!\u201dAt the foot of the mountain.Zhan Qingchen and the others faced the Imperial Guards.The atmosphere was tense.Zhan Qingchen asked in a low voice, \u201cQingluan, what is the situation?\u201dChen Qingluan frowned and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, they are obviously the guards of the Imperial Capital, why would they come to the Northern Region?\u201dThey had just come out of the secret realm when they encountered this group of people.They were about to attack Cen Yiren directly.Chen Qingluan\u2019s pointed brows frowned slightly, \u201cBig bear sister, what trouble have you caused?\u201dCen Yiren shook her head blankly, \u201cNothing, I\u2019m just accompanying Su Shi.\u201dThe two people looked at each other.\u201cQingluan.\u201dA majestic voice sounded.Chen Qingluan looked up, only to see an armor-clad Han Chen stepping in.\u201cUncle Han?\u201dThe Han and Chen families are family friends.Chen Wangchuan and Han Chen are both officials in the same palace and have a good personal relationship.Chen Qingluan asked, \u201cWhat is Uncle Han doing here?\u201dHan Chen said frankly, \u201cTo execute Su Shi, a member of the Demon Sect! This demon girl is his accomplice, so of course we have to kill her too!\u201dThe faces of the two people turned pale at those words.Sure enough.They had come for Su Shi!A trace of anxiety flashed through Zhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes, could it be that the Holy Emperor had decided to take action against Su Shi?With Chen Qingluan\u2019s position, it was certain that she was on the side of the palace.Just as he was about to step forward, he heard Chen Qingluan say, \u201cSu Shi\u2019s execution? What\u2019s the reason?\u201dHan Chen sneered, \u201cEveryone who comes from the demon sect must be killed because they are demons, what other reason is needed?\u201d\u201cOf course there is!\u201dChen Qingluan said in a deep voice: \u201cIt\u2019s true that Su Shi is a member of the Demon Sect, but he is also a citizen of my Linlang Empire! If Commander Han wants to kill someone, then you must explain which laws he has broken!\u201dHer demeanor was extremely powerful, and her address had changed from uncle to commander.Han Chen frowned.Does this girl have a problem with me?\u201cSu Shi killed a disciple of the Righteous path in the middle of Linlang City, it is a big crime!\u201dChen Qingluan shook her head, \u201cLinlang City is under the jurisdiction of the Demon Extermination Division, whether Su Shi kills someone or not, the Demon Extermination Division will investigate clearly, it is not your turn to lead the Imperial Guards!\u201dHan Chen\u2019s eyes narrowed, \u201cDo you mean to obstruct me?\u201dChen Qingluan did not retreat in the slightest, \u201cCommander Han who obstructs the law in Linlang City!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dLooking at her determined eyes, Han Chen\u2019s expression changed for a moment.What is wrong with this girl?This girl has always hated the demon, but now she is defending Su Shi?Zhan Qingchen was also a little confused.I feel that my best friend is a different person \u2026\u2026\u201cWhy do I need to explain to you when this commander does things? I\u2019ll call Patriarch Chen to come talk to me.\u201d\u201cArrest them!\u201dHan Chen waved a big hand.\u201cI\u2019ll see who dares!\u201dZhan Qingchen took a step forward, and her body was enveloped in white light.Han Chen was stunned to hear this, \u201cChief Zhan, why are you doing this?\u201d\u201cSince you can\u2019t give an explanation, then I don\u2019t need to explain it to you either.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s voice was indifferent, \u201cCommander Han is so domineering, why don\u2019t you kill me first?\u201dHan Chen swallowed.Kill her?That\u2019s ridiculous!He is friends with Chen Wangchuan so he can ignore Chen Qingluan, but Zhan Qingchen is the Chief Disciple of Tianji Pavilion!Tianji Pavilion\u2019s leader, Sikong Lanyue was a powerful figure to be on par with the Holy Emperor!What\u2019s wrong with the two of them, why are they helping Su Shi?Han Chen froze for a while.\u201cHey!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201dPeople instantly turned their heads only to see a figure in a white robe slowly approaching.\u201cSu Shi!\u201dClang!The Imperial Guards pulled their swords out of their sheaths in unison.Swish!Chen Qingluan drew her long sword and looked at all of them coldly.Zhan Qingchen was ready to attack at any time, with her hand drawing a magic seal.Feeling the murderous aura of the two girls, Han Chen\u2019s eyebrows jumped wildly.This image is not right!Su Shi looked at this scene, and his heart was like a mirror.He looked up at Han Chen, \u201cYou want to kill me?\u201dHan Chen said coldly, \u201cSo what if I do?\u201dSu Shi asked again, \u201cIs it the Holy Emperor\u2019s order?\u201dHan Chen gritted his teeth and said nothing. The Holy Emperor didn\u2019t explicitly say it, but only ordered the mountain to be sealed, so he had taken the initiative himself to take action against Su Shi.But what was the point of sealing the mountain without arresting Su Shi?Su Shi said understandingly, \u201cHoly Emperor wants me dead, but doesn\u2019t want a full-scale war, so he exchanged your life for mine?\u201dAs a genius of the Demonic path, if he dies, someone will definitely pay the price.Han Chen is definitely the one who will be blamed.Han Chen was silent for a moment and said bluntly, \u201cI dare not speculate on the His Majesty will, but if I can eradicate a big problem for the country, my death is a small price.\u201dIf the country was in trouble, the king would die for the country, so why shouldn\u2019t he die as a citizen?Su Shi looked at him admiringly, \u201cYou are a person who values the country over your own life.\u201d\u201cBut unfortunately, you can\u2019t kill me, I have someone above me.\u201dHan Chen sneered, \u201cYou mean Feng Zhongque? Now that the four Saints are not in the Northern Region, no one from the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect will protect you!\u201d\u201cIf I kill you today, no one can stop me!\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dIndifferent voices rang out, as if a heavy hammer had struck everyone\u2019s heart.A shadow slowly covered the people.They people looked up, only to see a huge and luxurious flying boat suspended in the air, nine demon dragons hissing with their heads held high, exuding huge demon flames!A terrifying pressure covered the sky!Su Shi shrugged, \u201cAs I said, there is someone above me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 \u2013 The mere intention of killing is already a deadly crime, the majesty of the Demon Empress!The huge flying boat covered the sky, as if it was a dark cloud in the sky.Nine black demonic dragons spouted flames, emitting an aura of destruction.Nine Mysterious Dragon Boats!This is the imperial boat of the Demon Empress of the Netherworld!Han Chen swallowed, his scalp tingling.The Netherworld Demon Empress has come to the Northern Region without a sound?This is the inner region of the imperial dynasty!The Imperial Guards froze in place, not daring to make the slightest movement, because one glance at this moment could cause bloodshed!A cold voice rang out:\u201cHow dare you not kneel when you see this Empress?\u201dPoof!Except for Su Shi and the others, everyone was forced to kneel on the ground.Including Han Chen!His body trembled and his veins were sticking out, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t straighten his back, as if he was bowing down to the Demon Empress!As the commander of the Imperial Guards, Han Chen\u2019s strength had reached Transformation Realm, but in front of the Netherworld Demon Empress, he couldn\u2019t even lift a finger.The Heavenly Constitution is in her mouth, and her words are the law.Only then can one be called Emperor!He thought that the absence of the four Saints was the best chance to kill Su Shi, but to his surprise, the Netherworld Demon Empress had arrived in person!Su Shi had his own Demon Emperor to protect him!Han Chen looked bitter, \u201cNo wonder this kid has no fear \u2026\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s true that he\u2019s not afraid of death, but he doesn\u2019t want a futile death.The indifferent voice once again came from the flying boat:\u201cYou intend to harm this Empress heir, you must die.\u201dBoom!Han Chen\u2019s body burst into flames, black flame tongues came out of his mouth and nose, and his whole body instantly turned into a fireball.A heart-breaking fire.It burned his flesh and annihilated his soul!Even a strong man like him couldn\u2019t help but let out a deafening wail!The Imperial Guards\u2019 eyes turned red, but they could not move a muscle, they could only watch as their commander was engulfed in flames.\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dAt that moment, a mist of light flashed.The black flames were extinguished.Wisps of smoke rose from Han Chen\u2019s body as he lay on the ground, unknown whether dead or alive.Clouds of mist drifted, and within the mist, a human figure could be faintly seen.Not far away, a middle-aged man with slightly white hair dismounted from his flying sword.\u201cFather?\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201dTwo exclamations sounded.Those who came were none other than Sikong Lanyue and Chen Wangchuan!As Chen Wangchuan looked at his friend, who was panting heavily, a trace of regret flashed through his eyes.If he had come a step later, Han Chen would have been ashes!The Demon Empress\u2019s voice rang out: \u201cSikong Lanyue, do you want to stop me?\u201dSikong Lanyue\u2019s voice came from the clouds: \u201cHan Chen hasn\u2019t done anything yet, so why should you kill him?\u201d\u201cJust the intention of killing deserves the death penalty.\u201dDemon Empress sneered, \u201cOr do you mean I have to wait for him to kill Su Shi first before I intervene?\u201dSikong Lanyue shook her head and said, \u201cIf killing intent alone deserves the death penalty, then you\u2019re saying you\u2019re going to kill everyone who has it in this world?\u201dThe Demon Emperor said indifferently: \u201cThen I will kill them one by one, seeing the mountain of heads and the river of blood, they will naturally know what fear is.\u201dIn just a few words, the Demon Empress\u2019 power and cruelty were revealed.In this woman\u2019s eyes, human life was no different from grass and trash!\u201cBesides,\u201d Demon Empress sneered, \u201cDo you really think that I want everyone dead?\u201dSikong Lanyue fell silent.If it weren\u2019t for the Holy Emperor\u2019s hint, Han Chen wouldn\u2019t have come this far.In the end, all the blame goes to the Holy Emperor.\u201cSigh. Qingchen, let\u2019s go.\u201dThe clouds and mist escaped and lifted Zhan Qingchen up.Sikong Lanyue has come for his disciple.As for Han Chen, it was something for Feng Chaoge to worry about.Zhan Qingchen looked at Su Shi with worry. Su Shi secretly gave her a flying kiss.Her face suddenly flushed, \u201cIn front of Demon Empress and Master, how dare he be so reckless?\u201dSikong Lanyue suddenly said, \u201cQingchen, you seem tense.\u201d\u201cNo need to fear the Demon Empress, I will protect you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Thank you, Master.\u201dZhan Qingchen breathed a sigh of relief, her eyes angry. Because of this bad guy, she was almost seen by her master!The two figures disappeared with the clouds.Demon Empress coldly snorted: \u201cSigh, really boring.\u201dIt was as if she felt disappointed that Sikong Lanyue did not make any movements.Chen Wangchuan looked up at the flying boat in the sky, \u201cDemon Empress, it\u2019s over. Han Chen has suffered enough punishment.\u201d\u201cWho allowed you to stand up and talk to this Empress?\u201dBoom!A terrifying pressure rushed in, and Chen Wangchuan was forced down.But then the peerless sword-qi rose into the sky, and the whole one looked like a supreme divine sword, surprisingly restraining himself to kneel.The Demon Emperor was slightly surprised: \u201cInteresting, then you guys can die together.\u201dThe black heart flame exploded and bursted out!Chen Wangchuan struggled to hold on, the peerless sword Qi was swallowed up quickly!\u201cFather!\u201dChen Qingluan looked anxious, but she couldn\u2019t move at all.At this moment, Su Shi said: \u201cYour Majesty, why don\u2019t we just forget about it.\u201dDemon Empress made a deep voice: \u201cGive me a reason.\u201dSu Shi scratched his head, \u201cThus subordinate are already tired after recently seeing a lot of death blood, so let\u2019s kill these two next time.\u201dThe scene was deathly silent.What was all this nonsense?The Demon Empress\u2019s words were the Constitution of Heaven, and no one she said she would kill survived!The Demon Empress was silent for a moment, \u201cVery well.\u201dThe black flames were extinguished instantly.\u201c???\u201dPeople had question marks above their heads.Su Shi breathed a sigh of relief.It doesn\u2019t matter if Han Chen dies or not, but after all, Chen Wangchuan is Chen Qingluan\u2019s biological father.And Chen Qingluan is Zhan Qingchen\u2019s best friend \u2026\u2026Su Shi rubbed his eyebrows, \u201cThis is the price to pay for daring to fall in love with someone from the Righteous faction.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe ghostly light swept over, carrying Su Shi and Cen Yiren onto the flying boat, and the demon dragons hissed their heads and shot off into the distance.Only after the flying boat had completely disappeared did people regain their freedom of movement.The guards collapsed to the ground, their faces pale and panting.The Demon Emperor\u2019s power was so terrifying!\u201cFather, are you alright?\u201dChen Qingluan asked with concern.Chen Wangchuan let out a bitter laugh, \u201dHan Chen is really too stupid to even dare to mess with the Netherworld Demon Empress! If Su Shi didn\u2019t stop her just now, everyone will die here today!\u201dThen there was confusion: \u201cBut why did that Su Demon help me to speak?\u201dChen Qingluan looked down and twiddled her thumbs, her heart becoming sweet.Only she knew that Su Shi had dared to disobey Demon Empress for her sake.\u201cHe\u2019s so good to me!\u201dChen Qingluan could not hide the smile at the corner of her mouth.Chen Wangchuan frowned: \u201cSeeing your father being beaten up, you seem to be very happy?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cChen Qingluan said shyly, \u201cI\u2019m just happy that my father made it out safely.\u201dChen Wangchuan didn\u2019t think much of it, and advised: \u201cRemember, don\u2019t become Su Shi\u2019s enemy in the future, this person has immeasurable potential, and has a very high status in the Demon Empress\u2019s heart!\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dChen Qingluan hesitated for a long time, blushing and squirming: \u201cWhat if, I mean what if \u2026\u2026 Su Shi becomes one of us?\u201d\u201cOne of us?\u201dChen Wangchuan did not take it seriously, \u201cA genius like him, if he is willing to submit to His Majesty Holy Emperor, let alone giving him a noble title or honor, treasures of heaven and earth, I will even voluntarily give him my daughter.\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cThat\u2019s it! You can\u2019t pull it back!\u201dChen Wangchuan: \u201c???\u201dI\u2019ve skimmed through the chapters ahead and found out that Feng Chaoge a.k.a Holy Emperor is actually female, should I change her title?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 \u2013 Yun Qiluo\u2019s cherished baby!Zhaotian Palace.Dressed in a bright yellow phoenix robe, she stood by the window. The phoenix\u2019s eyes and eyebrows were beautiful and graceful, with an intimidating majesty in its beauty and charm.\u201cYun Qiluo had come personally .\u201dA female official behind her bowed and said, \u201cSikong Lanyue also came, but did not make any movements, only took Zhan Qingchen away.\u201dThe hall was silent for a moment, and then a soft and distinctive voice sounded:\u201cThe Righteous faction has never been our ally, we only have a common enemy for now.\u201dWhether it is the Righteous faction or the Demonic faction, as long as it is a force that threatens the empire, they are all traitors and rebels in Feng Chaoge\u2019s eyes.It was just a matter of different priorities.The female official said, \u201cYour Majesty, your actions towards Su Shi this time, I\u2019m afraid it will provoke a backlash from the Demonic path.\u201dFeng Chaoge shook his head, \u201cWhen did I take action against Su Shi?\u201d\u201cThen Commander Han \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s his own decision.\u201dListening to that indifferent voice, the female officer felt a chill in her heart.Han Chen almost died and is now seriously injured. Most likely his cultivation level has regressed and even crippled.But according to the words of the Holy Emperor, it is a trivial matter.Feng Chaoge glanced at her, \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, do you think I\u2019m too ruthless?\u201dThe female official lowered her head, \u201cThis servant does not dare.\u201dFeng Chaoge sighed, \u201cIf I really want to take action against Su Shi, I will strike with lightning and kill him in one blow, so why should I send Han Chen alone?\u201d\u201cBlocking the mountain this time was just a test, but Yun Qiluo\u2019s reaction was beyond my expectation.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019m afraid this Su Shi can\u2019t be touched.\u201dIn governing a country, excellently organizing a sector means nothing if you ignore the perspective of the overall situation.\u00a01Yun Qilou was capable of anything, but Feng Chaoge could not gamble with the entire empire at stake.\u00a02\u201cOpen the treasury, gather the royal doctors, and do your best to treat Han Chen\u2019s injuries.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe female official nodded her head.Just as she was about to retreat, she heard Feng Chaoge say: \u201cChen Qingluan seems to have a good relationship with Su Shi?\u201dThe female official frowned slightly, \u201cSomething is indeed wrong.\u201dIn order to defend Su Shi, Chen Qingluan went out of her way to fight with Han Chen.The relationship between the two was clearly abnormal.The female officer said, \u201cYour Majesty, should we investigate?\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dFeng Chaoge said, \u201cSu Shi has excellent talent and is handsome, and Chen Qingluan is a young girl, so it is natural for her to fall in love with him.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe female official was surprised, but did not dare to ask more.She bowed and withdrew.Feng Chaoge looked out the window, her bright eyes filled with laughter.\u201cYun Qilou\u2019s cherished baby, if Chen Qingluan snatches it, her expression must be amazing, right?\u201d\u201cPfft.\u201dLight laughter, as if the ice and snow had melted.\u2026\u2026..The flying boat shot through the air.As the Demon Empress\u2019s royal vehicle, the boat was very luxurious and large, even the decoration was very exotic and precious, as if it was a palace flying in the air.The scent of tea curled up in the room.Su Shi sipped his tea nervously.Yun Qiluo sat opposite him, silently looking at him, not saying a word.The atmosphere was rather quiet.After a long time, she suddenly said, \u201cDo you like Chen Qingluan?\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201dSu Shi spit out a mouthful of tea.\u201cCough cough, I like Chen Qingluan? How is that possible!\u201dHe thought the other party would ask about the matter of opportunity, but he didn\u2019t expect the picture to go off the rails as soon as she opened her mouth.Yun Qiluo frowned, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like her, why did you defend Chen Wangchua just now?\u201dTired of seeing a lot of blood and death? Does he think I\u2019m stupid?Su Shi was silent for a moment and said in a low voice, \u201cActually, I\u2019m worried about Your Majesty.\u201dYun Qiluo was stunned, \u201cWorried about me?\u201d\u201cAlthough Your Majesty is very powerful, but the Northern Region is after all the inner of the imperial dynasty, if the Imperial Palace unites with the Righteous people to attack, I\u2019m afraid the situation will not be in your favor.\u201dSu Shi looked at him seriously, \u201cThis subordinate does not want Your Majesty to be in the slightest danger.\u201dLooking at those deep eyes, Yun Qiluo\u2019s heartbeat increased slightly.Strange, why does this man seem to have become more handsome?\u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201dYun Qiluo shifted his gaze, \u201cI\u2019ll ignore it this time, but you\u2019re not allowed to get in touch with those disciples of the Righteous path!\u201dSu Shi nodded vigorously, \u201cI only have Your Majesty in my heart.\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s cheeks were slightly red, \u201cYou are presumptuous, who allowed you to put me in your heart?\u201dThis sounds like a confession!For not being allowed to have contact with those disciples of the Righteous path, she instead laid her eyes on me?Su Shi hurriedly said, \u201cYour Majesty has misunderstood\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need an explanation.\u201dYun Qiluo was silent for a moment, then asked: \u201cDid you get anything in Tianqu Mountain this time?Su Shi nodded, \u201cThis subordinate has reached the Late Stage of Golden Elixir Realm.\u201d\u201cLate Stage of Golden Elixir Realm?\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s eyes were astonished, her eyes looked closely\u2026She saw that Su Shi\u2019s aura was solid and majestic, his spiritual energy was abundant and surging, he was indeed someone in the real Late Stage of Golden Elixir Realm!It had only been half a month since he broke through the Golden Elixir, and he had already broken through two small realms in a row!A twenty-year-old at the Late Stage of Golden Elixir Realm?Even if he was a Holy-grade perfect, it was too much!She was somewhat overwhelmed for a while.Su Shi scratched his head and said, \u201cThis subordinate is just lucky to get an infusion of spiritual energy.\u201dYun Qiluo shook her head, \u201cLuck itself is also part of strength.\u201dLuck never favors the weak.Otherwise, of all the cultivators, why was Su Shi the only one given a chance?Yun Qiluo pondered slightly, \u201cIt seems that this time the opportunity is not trivial, no wonder Zhan Qingchen and Chen Qingluan are both-\u201cSeeing that they were about to get involved again, Su Shi hurriedly changed the subject: \u201cBy the way, this subordinate also brought a gift for Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cA Gift?\u201dYun Qiluo froze.She saw Su Shi take out a pendant and said with a smile, \u201cI found this in the Immortal Palace, it has the effect of calming the mind and qi, although it is not a precious treasure, I feel it will look good on Your Majesty.\u201dYun Qiluo stared blankly at the crystal clear pendant, her pretty face flushed red, she bit her lip and said, \u201cYou, what do you mean by gifting this kind of thing?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dSu Shi looked puzzled at first, but then he was also surprised.The pendant was a red jade, and it happened to be heart-shaped!Oh no, I didn\u2019t notice what I just picked up \u2026\u2026He had already gotten to this point and couldn\u2019t possibly take it back, Su Shi could only make up a story, \u201cCough, this represents this subordinate\u2019s pure heart.\u201d\u201cYour pure heart?\u201dYun Qiluo snorted.She couldn\u2019t believe it!Just now he said that she was the only one in his heart, and now he gave a heart-shaped pendant \u2026\u2026Although she is not involved in the \u201cred world\u201d and knows little about the relationship between men and women, she would be a fool not to understand this!Seeing that she hadn\u2019t spoken for a long time, Su Shi said embarrassedly: \u201cYes, this is just an ordinary spiritual treasure, how could it be worthy of Your Majesty? This subordinate is too frivolous, I hope Your Majesty is not offended.\u201dSaying that, he put the pendantbitun back away.\u201cWait.\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s face was slightly red, her eyes seemed to have ripples, she said softly: \u201cWho said I don\u2019t want it? You can wear it for me.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 \u2013 I, fall in love with the Demon Empress?Su Shi gulped, \u201cThis subordinate will help you wear it?\u201dYun Qiluo blinked her watery eyes and said amusedly, \u201cWhat, you dare to give something, but you dare not wear it for me?\u201dSu Shi hesitated for a moment, then stood up and walked behind her.Yun Qiluo did not wear a bun, her hair was like a waterfall and fell straight to her waist.Su Shi gently pulled her long hair, revealing her long, white neck.As he stands behind her, his eyes catch a glimpse of the dazzling snow light.His throat became slightly dry.Her Majesty\u2019s body was so good?Seeing that he hadn\u2019t moved for a long time, Yun Qiluo was puzzled, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dSu Shi came back to his senses and put the jade pendant around her neck, carefully tightening the button.Yun Qiluo turned around and asked softly, \u201cHow is it, does it look good?\u201dThe jade pendant fell on the delicate collarbone, making her skin even whiter, less majestic and more feminine and beautiful.Who would have thought that this was such a powerful and ruthless Demon Empress of Netherworld?\u201cBeautiful.\u201dSu Shi nodded his head.Yun Qiluo asked, \u201cIs it the jade pendant that looks beautiful, or is it me that looks beautiful?\u201dAs soon as the words left her mouth, she regretted it.Given her status, such a question was rather frivolous.Su Shi was silent for a long time and said, \u201cYour Majesty is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.\u201dAnd so it was.In terms of beauty alone, Zhan Qingchen and Chen Qingluan did not lose to anyone.But as Demon Empress, Yun Qiluo has a unique aura, cold and delicate, cruel and gentle, like a poisonous but beautiful mandala flower.Yun Qiluo\u2019s cheeks are flushed, like the setting sun reflecting off the snow.No one had ever said such a thing to her before.Her eyes fluttered and she snorted coldly, \u201cYou\u2019re not teasing me, are you?\u201dSu Shi shook his head, \u201cThis subordinate was only seven years old back then, and when I saw Your Majesty, I was stunned, and children will never lie.\u201d\u201cPfft~\u201dYun Qiluo couldn\u2019t help but laugh.When she thought of that snowy night, a gentle look flashed in her eyes.The little boy had a serious face and said that he wanted to protect her.This made Yun Qiluo\u2019s heart rustle for the first time. It was also Su Shi\u2019s words that made her believe that there were still people in this world who deserved to live.So even though the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect had penetrated the three continents, it had never oppressed or harmed the people, and had even maintained order to ensure their livelihood.\u201cSu Shi.\u201dYun Qiluo looked at him seriously, \u201cIf you dare to betray me, I will definitely kill you.\u201dSu Shi scratched his head.I wonder if having a relationship with a girl from the Righteous path is considered betraying the Demon Empress?At this moment, the flying boat trembled gently. The servant\u2019s voice sounded from outside the door, \u201cYour Majesty, we have arrived at Fengsha City.\u201d\u201cFengsha City?\u201dSu Shi wondered, \u201cAren\u2019t we going back to the sect?\u201dYun Qiluo said: \u201cI want to see the place where you live.\u201dSeeing those crystal eyes, Su Shi couldn\u2019t help but freeze.The two of them walked on the road.Looking at the yellow sand and dust around them, Yun Qiluo\u2019s brows wrinkled slightly.\u201cSo the conditions in Fengsha City are so bad?\u201dWhen Su Shi was first asked to be the Commander of Fengsha City, it was because this city was the smallest and relatively easy to control.Otherwise, with his cultivation level in the Realm Foundation Establishment at the time, she was afraid she wouldn\u2019t be able to appease the cynical looks from other cities.She didn\u2019t expect the environment here to be so bad.Su Shi shrugged, \u201cActually, it\u2019s fine if you get used to it, although this place is remote and poor, the customs of the people are still very simple.\u201dYun Qiluo pursed her lips and did not speak.She intended for Su Shi to be a laid-back commander, but now it seemed like he had been exiled to the frontier.No wonder he doesn\u2019t want to be the Chief Disciple, I guess it\u2019s because I have destroyed his heart?That was an oversight on my part.Yun Qiluo sighed in her heart.When Su Shi saw that she was in a low mood, he scanned the surroundings and said, \u201cYour Majesty, please wait here.\u201dThen he ran to a side alley.Yun Qiluo was a little confused by this.A short while later, Su Shi ran back with a bamboo stick in his hand, carrying some red cakes.Yun Qiluo was a little stunned, \u201cThis is \u2026\u2026\u201dSu Shi smiled and said, \u201cThere are no haw sweets in this season, so this subordinate searched for some peach cakes and got a lot. Don\u2019t you want to try it?\u201dYun Qiluo looked at the strands of 'sweet gourd\u201d, her eyes a little dreamy, her delicate hands clenching her robe.After a moment of silence, she reached out to pick it up and opened her mouth to gently bite it.\u201cVery sweet.\u201dThe corners of Yun Qiluo\u2019s mouth curled up slightly, outlining a bright smile.Looking at the beautiful smile like melting ice and snow, Su Su Shi\u2019s heartbeat was thumping.\u201cIt\u2019s good that Your Majesty likes it.\u201dYun Qiluo handed him a peach blossom cake, \u201cDo you want to try it too?\u201dSeeing the faint tooth marks on the cake, Su Shi\u2019s voice moved.Realizing his gaze, Yun Qiluo reacted and hurriedly tried to withdraw her hand.But Su Shi had already taken a bite of the cake.\u201cThis is really sweet.\u201dHe said faintly.Yun Qiluo\u2019s cheeks heated up slightly, and she pushed the bamboo stick into his hand, \u201cThen take your time to eat.\u201dAfter saying that, she walked quickly towards the front.Looking at her slightly flustered back, Su Shi shook his head amusedly, \u201cBeing with Demon Empress, why does it feel like I\u2019m falling in love?\u201d\u201cThis must be an illusion \u2026\u2026\u201dThis Fengsha City was very small, the two of them quickly finished the tour.Looking at the residence in front of them, Su Shi said with a smile, \u201cThis is the residence of this subordinate.\u201dYun Qiluo was a little curious, \u201cCan I come in and take a look?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dSu Shi walked over and pushed open the door.\u201cMaster?\u201dJust as the door opened, a figure jumped into his arms like a swallow into a forest.Bai Qing hugged him tightly and rubbed her delicate face against his chest, pouting:\u201cMaster, you\u2019re finally back, I missed you so much.\u201dThe atmosphere was silent, the sound of a pin drop could be heard. Su Shi swallowed his saliva, his back was faintly cold, a murderous aura fell on him like ice.Yun Qiluo\u2019s faint voice rang out: \u201cWho is she?\u201dBai Qing raised her head when she heard the voice, and saw the brilliant and beautiful woman standing beside him, he wondered: \u201cMaster, this is your friend too? Sister Zhaozhao just left, how can another great beauty come?\u201d\u201cAnother? It seems that there are other girls coming?\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s chest rose and fell as she gritted her teeth and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you only have me in your heart?!\u201dSu Shi\u2019s scalp tingled slightly.What\u2019s going on here?Why does it feel like a cheating scene caught in the act?Su Shi explained, \u201cYour Majesty misunderstood, Qing\u2019er is my maid.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dYun Qiluo sneered, \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, she should be a Super-grade Perfect talent, right? A top talent like this would be your maid? I thought she was responsible for warming the bed!\u201dBai Qing was stunned when she heard the words.\u201cHow did you know?\u201dSu Shi covered his face.It\u2019s over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 \u2013 This Demon Emperor is so damn sweet!\u201cNo wonder you rarely return to the sect, so you hid your little sweetheart in this house?\u201dYun Qiluo had a cold smile on her face.This damned man!Just now he said that he only had me in his heart, and he gave ne a red heart pendant, but it was all a lie?Men are really not good!Looking at her resentful and bitter eyes, Su Shi swallowed nervously.Why do I feel like Demon Empress\u2026 Jealous?\u201cYour Majesty has completely misunderstood, Bai Qing grew up with this subordinate since she was a child. She is a maid brought from the Su family, as for her cultivation talent\u2026. it was discovered by chance recently.\u201dSu Shi explained.Bai Qing also nodded vigorously beside him.Although she was stupid, she was not an idiot, there was only one person who could make his master refer to her as Your Majesty.The legendary Netherworld Demon Empress was cold-blooded, ruthless, and morderous!Yun Qiluo\u2019s brows furrowed slightly.Dark light flashed in her eyes as she stared intently at Bai Qing.She could see that her eyes were clear and bright, and her eyebrows had not spread, so she was indeed a virgin.Could she really be a maid?Yun Qiluo hesitantly said, \u201cThen warming the bed means\u2026.\u201dBai Qing blushed and said: \u201cI\u2019m just warming up, I\u2019m not doing anything inappropriate.\u201dYun Qiluo somehow felt relieved.The gloom in her heart disappeared and her emotions subsided.\u201cHmph, so you know your place-\u201d 1\u201cCough.\u201dSu Shi patted his chest and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Majesty, I\u2019m as pure as jade, I\u2019m definitely not that obscene.\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s cheeks flushed slightly and she hummed, \u201cWhat does it have to do with me if you\u2019re obscene or not?\u201dAfter saying that, she walked into the hall with her hands behind her back.Her steps were light, the hem of her skirt fluttered, and beneath her robe was a beautiful and bright aura.Su Shi swallowed his saliva.This demon emperor is so damn cute!In the hall.Yun Qiluo sat at the top.Looking at the few people in front of her, her eyes were slightly puzzled.\u201cIs it all this \u2026\u2026 you have cultivated?\u201dShe saw six people kneeling on one knee, their qi was very majestic, they were all Golden Elixir Realm cultivators.Although this strength was insignificant to her, it was a powerhouse in the Southwest Region!There was an unwritten rule that the strong and powerful should not interfere with mortals at will.\u00a02The city leaders in the southwestern state were all at the Golden Elixir level, and even Su Shi, who was only at the Late Stage Foundation Establishment, was able to take the Fengsha City leader position.Six Golden Elixir practicioners.Fengsha City was the first of the eight cities in the Southwest Region!\u201cSix Golden Elixir subordinates, one Super-grade perfect genius~\u201dYun Qiluo originally intended for Su Shi to be an easy-going commander, but she never expected him to run this small town so strongly!A trace of appreciation and pride flashed in her eyes.\u201cWell done, you are worthy of being a man that this Empress looks up to and appreciates.\u201dSu Shi modestly said: \u201cIt is thanks to Your Majesty that I was able to obtain this accomplishment.\u201dYun Qiluo deliberately frowned: \u201cAre you being sarcastic to me?\u201dOver the years, she had never provided any favors.Su Shi hurriedly said, \u201cYour Majesty misunderstood, this subordinate-\u201c\u201cBut it\u2019s okay.\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s beautiful eyes flashed, \u201cI will train you well in the future.\u201dSu Shi\u2019s heart beat faster.Why was this Demon Empress so provocative?At this moment, Yun Qiluo looked at Bai Qing and asked,\u201cYou are very talented, are you interested in joining my Netherworld Rakshasa Sect?\u201dThe Netherworld Demon Empress personally extended the invitation.So far, only Su Shi had been given this honor.Bai Qing did not reply, but lowered her head and said, \u201c I only serve my Master.\u201d\u201cYou are loyal.\u201dYun Qiluo was not angry and asked Su Shi, \u201cIn that case, do you want to let her join the sect?\u201dSu Shi hesitated for a moment and shook his head, \u201cI thank you for your offer, but I don\u2019t want to involve Qing\u2019er in the dispute between Righteous path and Demonic path. She is a Super-grade perfect talent, she will be the second Zhan Qingchen. The presence of another super genius in the Demonic path will only create ripples in the Nine Regions, and If the Imperial Dynasty and Righteous path take action against Bai Qing, I\u2019m afraid the consequences will be unthinkable.\u201d\u201cOkay, I understand.\u201dYun Qiluo nodded, but did not force the issue.Su Shi said carefully, \u201cYour Majesty, you are not angry?\u201dAfter all, he had refused the Demon Empress\u2019s invitation.Yun Qiluo smiled lightly and said, \u201cOf course I\u2019m not angry, it\u2019s enough that I have you.\u201dAfter saying that, she realized that something was wrong and hurriedly changed her words with a red face, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s enough for me to have you as my disciple.\u201dBai Qing beside him was stunned.Didn\u2019t they say that the Netherworld Demon Empress was the most cold-blooded and heartless?But this woman in front of her was so beautiful and charming that one couldn\u2019t take their eyes off her.\u2026\u2026..Land of the Great Cloud.At the top of a mountain in the clouds.Two figures sat facing each other.The two figures were still shrouded in clouds and mist, and their voices were indistinct, \u201cQingchen, you have made a breakthrough?\u201dZhan Qingchen nodded, \u201cThere is an inheritance opportunity in Tianqu Mountain, and this disciple has entered the Middle Stage of Golden Elixir Realm.\u201d\u201cNot bad.\u201dSikong Lanyue said in satisfaction, \u201c It seems that this trip to the Northern Region was not in vain.\u201dThen she asked, \u201cWhat about Su Shi? What about him?\u201dZhan Qingchen replied, \u201c Su Shi is the top of all tests, and his realm has already entered the Late Stage of Golden Elixir, so no one can match him.\u201dThe air became silent.After a long time, Sikong Lanyue sighed and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that no one will be able to stop him in the future.\u201dYun Qiluo is very protective, Feng Chaoge would not dare to act rashly.But if this child is allowed to grow up, will it be a blessing or a curse to the world?Zhan Qingchen hesitated for a moment and said, \u201cMaster, actually Su Shi is not a bad person \u2026\u2026\u201dSikong Lanyue wondered, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dZhan Qingduan said, \u201cIn the secret realm of inheritance, Su Shi has helped many times, not only helped this disciple pass the test, but also saved everyone\u2019s life in the end.\u201d\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for him, this disciple would have fallen in the secret realm.\u201dThe monster pretended to be an ancient emperor and the secret realm collapsed and shattered.If it wasn\u2019t for Su Shi, several people would have been buried along with the Immortal Palace.Sikong Lanyue froze, \u201cReally?\u201dZhan Qingduan nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely true.\u201dSeeing that she didn\u2019t seem to be lying, Sikong Lanyue fell silent.The best time for the Demonic path to get rid of the Righteous path\u2019s Heavenly Pride was this time.But not only did Su Shi not point the sword at her, but he even saved Qingchen\u2019s life?Yun Qiluo was so cold-blooded and crazy, treating human life like grass, how could she train such a disciple?The clouds were swirling, obviously not calm inside.\u201cNo wonder you and Chen Qingluan blocked Han Chen, so Su Shi is actually your life-saving benefactor?\u201d\u201cHe is also this disciple\u2019-\u201cBut this is something that Zhan Qingchen dare not say.Thinking of what happened in Tianqu Mountain, her eyes were cold and her face was icy, \u201cSu Shi didn\u2019t do anything evil, just because his talent is too strong, he deserves to die?\u201d\u201cFeng Chaoge is too unreasonable!\u201dSikong Lanyue shook her head, \u201cFor the Imperial Dynasty, how can there be any distinction between good and evil? As long as the Imperial family is threatened, they are all enemies.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes lit up and she cautiously said, \u201cMaster, why don\u2019t we bring Su Shi to become one of us?\u201dSikong Zhangyue: \u201cHmm?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 \u2013 Su Shi smells good, if you don\u2019t believe me you can smell it yourself!\u201cBecome one of us?\u201dSikong Lanyue was confused, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201dZhan Qingchen analyzed solemnly, \u201cSu Shi is kind-hearted and extremely talented. Isn\u2019t it a pity that such a person would become a demon?\u201d\u201cIf Master accepts him as a disciple he will naturally have Righteous identity, isn\u2019t that equivalent to weakening the power of the Demonic path without bloodshed?\u201dZhan Qingchen played out her subterfuge.If Su Shi could join Tianji Pavilion, then the two of them would be able to meet every day.Without the gap between the Righteous path and the Demonic path, it was possible for them to be together.The more Zhan Qingchen thought about it, the happier she became, and almost burst out laughing.\u201cYou think Yun Qiluo is stupid? There\u2019s no way she\u2019d let go of a High-grade perfect genius that easily.\u201d\u201cBesides\u2026.\u201dSikong Lanyue said unhappily, \u201cHow could I possibly take a man as a disciple? How could I get along with something dirty like that?\u201dZhan Qingchen said disapprovingly, \u201cSu Shi is not dirty, he is fragrant!\u201d\u201c???\u201dSikong Lanyue frowned, \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about?\u201dZhan Qingchen lowered her head and murmured in a low voice, \u201cHe is very fragrant. If you don\u2019t believe me, Master can smell it yourself.\u201dSu Shi\u2019s body had a special fragrance.It made people blush and heart palpitate when conversing with him, and made people feel at ease when he was silent.Master doesn\u2019t understand it at all!Sikong Lanyue said indifferently, \u201cYou\u2019ll be seclused for a month, get lost!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dZhan Qingchen descended the stairs with a bitter face.Looking at hee back, Sikong Lanyue snorted coldly.\u201cThis rebel is really getting more and more insolent, how dare she suggest me to smell a man?\u201d\u201cNo need to find out, it definitely stinks!\u201d\u201cBut her suggestion to bring Su Shi over to our side\u2026\u201dSikong Lanyue pondered slightly.This was not entirely unfeasible.There was a tacit agreement between the Righteous path and the Demonic path that they could not deliberately kill the main heir, otherwise it would be seen as a signal to declare war.But if Su Shi was brought to the Righteous path and his life was not in danger, I believe Yun Qiluo would have nowhere to vent his anger.\u201cBringing the demon star to the righteous path is a good idea.\u201d\u201cBut how can I take a man as my disciple?\u201d\u201cBut other Righteous Sects might not even be worthy of Su Shi\u2026.\u201dThe clouds swirled for a while.\u2026\u2026\u2026.Fengsa City, the commander\u2019s residence.Inside the room.Su Shi sat cross-legged.He thought the Demon Empress would return after walking around the city, but he didn\u2019t expect the other party to say that her body was too tired and she would stay here for the night.He naturally didn\u2019t dare to slack off and had Bai Qing clean the guest room for her.\u201cI feel that Demon Empress is becoming more and more strange.\u201dSu Shi squeezed his chin and thought silently.When she was with him, she was sometimes embarrassed and sometimes angry, as if she was a girl in love.But when at the foot of Tianqu Mountain, that powerful aura told the truth. This proved that she was still the Netherworld Demon Empress that made the world afraid.\u201cThere\u2019s no way the Demon Empress likes me, right?\u201dA bold thought appeared in Su Shi\u2019s head. But then shook his head vigorously.Don\u2019t be ridiculous, the Demon Empress is in love?I\u2019m afraid no one in this world would dare to have such an idea!But after all, the Demon Empress was indeed very kind to him.When the Four Saints were secretly sent away, Yun Qiluo didn\u2019t hesitate to personally protect her.This touched Su Shi\u2019s heart.\u201cI killed the Son of Destiny, Ye Xiao, and increased the prosperity of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect. This should be enough in return.\u201dThis time, on the way to obtaining the ancient emperor\u2019s inheritance, the harvest could be said to be bountiful.Star power, Blue Sky Heavenly Flame, realm enhancement, True Dragon Qi Perceiving Technique\u2026.In addition, he also gained a large number of plot points.Open the system panel.[Host: Son of Destiny Killer \u2013 Su Shi][Status: Full of Qi and Blood, Refreshed][Talent: Holy-grade perfect][Cultivation Base: Realm of Golden Elixir (Late Stage)][Cultivation Method: The Breathing Technique of Netherworld (Great Success), Netherworld Divine Cultivation (Small Success)][Plot Points: 341]341 plot points.That was a huge amount of money!Su Shi took a slightly short breath.Although it was not enough to buy the best cultivation method, yet he himself already had one!From his storage ring, he took out a worn out ancient book.[Are you going to learn the technique of The Great Harmony of the Nine Revolution Elements of Heaven and Earth?]\u201cSure!\u201dSu shi did not hesitate.Just to learn it, he had to consume 300 plot points, this cultivation technique must be extremely powerfulPlot points were deducted.The ancient book rose into the air, the pages turning automatically, and the ancient seal script seemed to fly towards Su shi as if it had a spirit.Like a tattoo, it was engraved on his body.Boom!Divine light appeared between the spiritual platforms!It was as if the universe had been born, the first ray of light in heaven and earth!The glorious divine light shone brightly, and there seemed to be the sound of the Great Dao in his ears, and countless information rushed into his sea of consciousness.The first ray of light of heaven and earth.This technique has nine revolutions.It is to plant true seeds within oneself, use heaven and earth as a furnace, use oneself to melt the pills, and ultimately see the infinite realm of creation!At the highest level of cultivation, you will be able to see the creation of the world, and experience all the changes of Yin and Yang!The true body is seen through the void.Yin and Yang are reversed, and the true form is revealed!Su Shi\u2019s eyes were tightly closed as his body floated into the air, and the divine flames from the blue sky billowed out automatically, as if forging him like a pill refining!His clothes instantly turned to ashes, and the ancient seal on his body shone brightly!The first revolution of elemental mixing:Vajra was refined by fire, and fire produced its true form!In the guest room next door.Yun Qiluo was lying on the bed, holding a bronze mirror in her hand, carefully admiring the heart-shaped pendant on her collarbone.Occasionally, she even showed a silly smile.\u201cSu Shi has good eyes, this suits me perfectly.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t even a holy treasure, but now she was deeply addicted to this ordinary spiritual item.The texture of the jade was gently stroked, and Yun Qiluo\u2019s cheeks flushed slightly.Although she has a high and powerful position, she has never received a gift before, let alone from Su Shi.When she thought that he still thought of her even though he was in the inheritance of the ancient emperor, her heart was like a honey pot.Then her nose wrinkled slightly:\u201cBut there must be something fishy between him and that Chen Qingluan!\u201d\u201cShenxiu once said that Su Shi took Chen Qingluan away, could it be that something happened between the two ?\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s eyes flashed with cold light.\u201cShould I kill her?\u201d\u201cChen Wangchuan\u2019s strength is not too bad, but he definitely can\u2019t stop me.\u201dShe cupped her shiny chin and began to think about it seriously.In the end, she shook her head.\u201cIt\u2019s just that, if Su Shi finds out, he will definitely be angry with me.\u201d\u201cThis person is very careful.\u201dAt this moment, she felt a movement coming from the next door, Yun Qiluo\u2019s heart jumped slightly.\u201cThere\u2019s no way for that maid to warm up the bed again, right?\u201dThinking of this, she couldn\u2019t sit still.She got up and walked out of the room.She gets to the next door and carefully pushes it open.The sight in front of him made his cheeks flush!\u201cWhy isn\u2019t this person wearing any clothes?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 \u2013 The Netherworld Demon Empress\u2019s Persona Collapses!Yun Qiluo looked at Su Shi in a dumbfounded manner.He was suspended in midair, his green and blue flames burning, and mysterious seal characters hovering around him, exuding a mysterious aura.It was obvious that Su Shi was cultivating.The mysteriousness of this technique wasn\u2019t even less than the Netherworld Divine Art.But Yun Qiluo\u2019s focus was not on this at all.\u201cHe actually has a good body shape?\u201dSu Shi was usually dressed in white, as if he was a handsome scholar, but she did not expect his body to be so strong!His muscles are knotted, his qi and blood are dragon-like, but he doesn\u2019t look bloated in the slightest, his lines clear and smooth.He exudes a strong masculine charm.Yun Qiluo\u2019s cheeks instantly turned red and she hurriedly turned her head away, not daring to look again.But after a while, she quietly turned around again, her phoenix eyes curiously and shyly looking at him.\u201cI\u2019m just worried about him in case something goes wrong, yeah, that is it.\u201dShe assured herself silently.After an unknown amount of time, the fire gradually went out, the ancient seal on Su Shi\u2019s body disappeared and he fell from the air.Yun Qiluo hurriedly came forward and caught him.She saw that Su Shi\u2019s eyes were tightly closed and his brows were locked, as if he had fallen into a coma.She exerted his spiritual power to check on him, only then did she breathe a sigh of relief.Su Shi was not seriously injured.Instead, his meridians were like jade, his roots and bones were perfect, his spiritual energy was like a river, and his physique was several times better than before!The only thing was that the improvement was too fast to be fully absorbed, resulting in confusion in his consciousness.It would be fine when he woke up.\u201c\u2026.\u201dLooking at Su Shi, who was holding her hand and refusing to let go, Yun Qiluo\u2019s expression tightened, \u201cWhat should I do now!\u201dSu Shi was dreaming.He dreamed that he fell into the Taishang Laojun pill furnace, and was burned and tempered by the blazing alchemy fire.After an unknown period of time, the fire was finally extinguished.His body felt hot and burning, and he felt uncomfortable like he had a high fever.But he suddenly found a touch of coolness, as if he had found ice in the desert, and immediately clung to it for dear life.In a daze, Su Shi opened his eyes and found himself hugging a silhouette.\u201cQing\u2019er?\u201dIt was the figure he first thought of, and then he lost consciousness.It was dawn.Su Shi opened his eyes, his mind was clear, and he stretched comfortably.\u201cWow!\u201dThe power of [The Great Harmony of the Nine Revolution Elements of Heaven and Earth] was beyond his imagination!He was a Holy-grade perfect talent with flawless roots and bones, but this cultivation method had surprisingly improved his physique once again.It was as if his meridians had been melted into jade! The most crucial thing was that every revolution of this technique would come with divine ability.Its power was immeasurable!\u201cThese 300 points are well spent, and this is just the first revolution.\u201dThe corners of Su Shi\u2019s mouth curved upwards slightly.His potential is limitless!Suddenly, he smelled something and sniffed carefully.\u201cWhat is this smell, it smells very good \u2026\u2026\u201dTurning his head to look, his expression instantly froze, as if he had been hit by a stun spell.\u201cYour, Your Majesty?\u201dHe saw Yun Qiluo lying beside him, her face flushed, her clothes messy, her eyes staring at the ceiling.Su Shi\u2019s scalp felt tingling.After looking around, he was certain that it was his room.\u201cYour Majesty, what have you done to this subordinate?\u201dHe grabbed the blanket and curled up in the corner, weak and helpless, \u201c I\u2019m not that cheap, even if you get my body\u2013\u201d\u201cCrap!\u201dYun Qiluo gritted her teeth and said, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re the one who won\u2019t let me go!\u201dThinking of what happened last night, she couldn\u2019t wait to find a hole in the ground.She wanted to put him on the sofa and leave, but she didn\u2019t know what this man dreamed of, his hands and feet didn\u2019t want to let her go at all.Her heart was throbbing with panic, but she couldn\u2019t even use her cultivation power, let alone break free.She was like a stiff log, held by Su Shi and slept through the night.\u201cThis bastard!\u201dYun Qiluo was extremely embarrassed and angry.She was the Supreme Lord of the Netherworld, a supreme demon, synonymous with killing and destruction, a cold-blooded empress, brutal and merciless!How could she sleep with this man?If this was exposed, how could she face the sect people?Su Shi scratched his head, \u201cBut this is my room, why would Your Majesty appear here?\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s breathing stopped.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCough cough, I noticed there was movement in the room, and I came to check it out out of concern, who would have thought you would be so presumptuous?\u201dSu Shi recalled last night, \u201cCould that ice be the Demon Empress?!\u201dThinking of this, he hurriedly got up and said, \u201cThis subordinate has offended you, I hope Your Majesty will forgive me!\u201dYun Qiluo turned her head and said with a red face, \u201cYou, you put your clothes on first.\u201dSu Shi hurried over.He had just finished dressing when he found that Yun Qiluo had already disappeared.His cold voice rang through the air:\u201cI will return to the sect, if you dare to spread this matter, I will kill you myself!\u201dThe room returned to silence.Su Shi looked at the messy bed mattress, there was a kind of not-so-real feeling.He had slept with Demon Empress?And was still alive?Outside the room.Yun Qiluo leaned against the wall, covering her hot face, her heart beating hard.\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201dThroughout the night, Su Shi did not let go.\u2026..He leaned on his chin and stared blankly.\u201cI really slept with Demon Empress?\u201dAlthough it wasn\u2019t 'sleep\u201d as you think, but sleep was still sleep after all.\u201cWhen she calms down, she will definitely kill me to silence me!\u201dSu Shi shivered.He began to think seriously about whether he should run away.Knoc, knock, knock.At that moment, there was a knock on the bedroom door.Su Shi gathered his wits, \u201cCome in.\u201d\u201cCommander, Commander Qianyang City is here.\u201d\u201cCommander of Qianyang City?\u201dSu Shi thought for a moment, remembering Cao Jie who had his arm broken in Yulin City.\u201cWhy is he here? Let him in.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWu Mang retreated.A moment later, Cao Jie entered, followed by several officers carrying boxes.\u201cCome, come, put it over here.\u201dSu Shi was stunned to see this, \u201cCommander Cao, what are you doing?\u201dCao Jie smiled warmly and said, \u201cCommander Su, it\u2019s been a long time, I missed you, so I came to bring you some specialties from Qianyang City.\u201dThe attendant opened the box, which was full of high-grade spirit stones that emitted a dazzling light.Su Shi said amusedly: \u201cThis is the specialty you mentioned? So the land in Qianyang City is full of spirit stones.\u201d\u201cCommander Su is joking, it\u2019s just a small souvenir.\u201dCao Jie rubbed his hands together with a smile.This was not a small souvenir at all.This was almost his entire fortune during his years as commander!It would be a lie to say that this amount was nothing.But there was nothing he could do, after all he had offended Su Shi.He thought the other party was a man who had risen to the top because of his background, but he did not expect that in just a few months, he had already soared to the top!A Holy-grade perfect talent, plus having the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect personally protecting him!Who in this world could compare to him?If the other party made reckoning with him for revenge\u2026.Cao Jie shivered.He was afraid!1.

    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 \u2013 Su Shi\u2019s female Fan Club!Cao Jie was really scared.After seeing Su Shi\u2019s strength in Yulin City, he had already realized that he had offended the wrong person. But he never thought that he would be so wrong!Holy-grade perfect talent!This kind of super genius, how could he possibly be a minor commander in Fengsha City?It was obviously just a trick of the Demon Empress.In the future, he would definitely become the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect\u2019s main heir!The matter in Tianqu Mountain had also spread, the Netherworld Demon Empress had almost eliminated Sword Master Chen Wangchuan to vent her anger in favor of Su Shi!He was just a small commander, if the other party wanted to get rid of him, wouldn\u2019t it be as easy as killing an ant?Su Shi saw what he was thinking and said indifferently, \u201cThere is no need for Commander Cao to be concerned, bygones are bygones.\u201dAlthough the other party had spoken harshly, he had broken his arm, and had sent many spiritual stones as an apology.It was just a small matter, there was no need to make a big deal out of it.\u201cI-\u201cCao Jie said with a bitter smile, \u201cI know that Commander Su is generous and will not be offended, but if you don\u2019t accept these things, I, I will have trouble sleeping or eating!\u201dSu Shi said helplessly: \u201cWu Mang, put those into the warehouse.\u201dWu Mang carried the boxes out.Only then did Cao Jie breathed a sigh of relief.Su Shi said, \u201cSomeone, please serve tea.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201dCao Jie said with a smile: \u201cI feel relieved now that the items have been received.\u201d\u201cToday, there is an official sale in Qianyang City, and I need to be there in person, so I won\u2019t trouble Commander Su any longer.\u201d\u201cOfficial sale?\u201dSu Shi\u2019s eyes flickered slightly.Official sales were auctions held by the government.The auctions usually included a wide variety of items, including spiritual treasures, houses, potions, cultivation methods \u2026\u2026 and even slaves and women.The proceeds are split equally between the government and the Chamber of Commerce.The city had been dominated by the Demonic path for many years, and the government had long existed in name only, which, frankly, was Cao Jie\u2019s gray income.Cao Jie cupped his hands and said, \u201cThen I will go back first, Commander Su can come to Qianyang City to have fun when you are free.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dSu Shi nodded his head, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026. huh?\u201dCao Jie was stunned, \u201cUs?\u201dSu Shi shrugged, \u201cCommander Cao\u2019s generosity is unbearable, so I\u2019ll have to respectfully comply.\u201dCao Jie said with a forced smile, \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid Commander Su has a lot of work to do-\u201cSu Shi shook his head and said, \u201cI have too much time in my hands\u201dCao Jie swallowed his saliva.He was just being polite, but he didn\u2019t expect this man to take it seriously!It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to, it was just that this Commander Su had such an extraordinary background, if he were to offend him again, he had no money left to make up for it.But at this moment, Cao Jie could only smile and said, \u201cAlright, as the host I will do my part.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dSu Shi stood up.The auction in Qianyang City.Although it was not the main storyline, he had the impression that there would be some good things.After all, he did not dare to return to the sect now, so it was good to go there for a walk while he was free.Qianyang City is not far from Fengsha City, only an hour by air.The city is located north of the Fengjiang River.Although it is not as big and important as Yulin City, it is very rich because it faces the Fengjiang River.Otherwise, how could Cao Jie, who was only a small commander, have obtained so many high-grade spirit stones?They entered the city.Cao Jie invited, \u201cThe official sale will only start in the evening, why don\u2019t you come to my place for tea first?\u201dSu Shi shook his head and said, \u201cNo need, Commander Cao please, I\u2019ll take a walk myself.\u201dSeeing that he was really impolite, Cao Jie couldn\u2019t insist, so he told him the official sales location and then turned around and left.Su Shi walked down the street with his hands behind his back.Although Qianyang City was not big, it was very lively here and there were many buildings, the prosperity was comparable to Yulin City.\u201cI thought Cao Jie\u2019s strength was average, but I didn\u2019t expect that his business skills were quite good.\u201dSu Shi silently nodded his head.No one who could be the commander of a city was a simple person.After walking around for a while, he passed by a restaurant.It was noon, so he went in for lunch.The restaurant had three floors, and although the decor was not luxurious, it was still decent.Su Shi randomly found a seat on the first floor and sat down.There was an old man on a high stage in the center who was telling stories, speaking at length and passionately.From time to time, he even received a standing ovation.Su Shi didn\u2019t care at first, but the more he listened, the more he found something wrong.Wasn\u2019t he the protagonist the old man was telling about?Hearing the old man tell the story eloquently, Su Shi got up from his seat:\u201cWhat kind of person is Su Shi?\u201d\u201cA genius with Holy-grade perfect talent, one of the few people in ten thousand years!\u201d\u201cThere is no one like him before or after. Not even Tianji Pavilion\u2019s Chief Disciple can match him!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s even more personable and dashing, with a handsome face!\u201d\u201cThis world only has three types of people, one is a man, one is a woman, and one is the handsome Su Shi!\u201dThe female guests were so excited, they kept throwing money on the stage.Su Shi covered his face.This was too embarrassing!He even suspected that this was a deliberate arrangement by Cao Jie.\u201cPfft~\u201dAt this moment, a laugh came from the seat next to him, and the sound was heart-wrenching: \u201cNonsense, have you ever seen Su Shi with your own eyes?\u201dSu Shi was stunned.This voice seemed somewhat familiar.The old man said unconvincingly, \u201cI am just an ordinary human being, of course I have never met such genius, but this is all recognized by everyone! You say I\u2019m talking nonsense, have you met him before?\u201dThe woman\u2019s voice hummed: \u201cOf course I have met him, and I also \u2026\u2026 cough, after all, Su Shi is not as you say.\u201dThe old man asked, \u201cThen tell me, what\u2019s wrong with what I said?\u201dThe woman\u2019s voice paused for a moment and said, \u201cSu Shi is eight feet tall, green-faced and ferocious, with a hideous and ferocious appearance that eats people without leaving a bone!\u201dSu Shi: \u201c????\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking nonsense!\u201d\u201cCommander Su is a first-class handsome man!\u201d\u201cYou slandered our Su Shi just like that!\u201d\u201cYou must apologize to Su Shi for this!\u201dThe other female guests were not happy, starting to make a scene and arguing with her.Although Su Shi had just started making a name for himself, he was very popular in the Southwest Region and even had a fan club made up of young girls.The woman was too lazy to argue with them, so she just snorted and didn\u2019t say a word.Only then did the restaurant gradually quieten down.After a while, the woman got up from her seat.A figure with a black veil and a tightly closed body came out.After leaving the restaurant, she turned around and entered the alley.She took off her veil and took a breath, revealing a beautiful face.\u201cShouting, what a bunch of nymphomaniacs!\u201dThe young woman snorted in disgust.\u201cCough.\u201dAt this point, a voice sounded behind her: \u201cHello again, little fox.\u201dThe young lady\u2019s body stiffened and she slowly turned to look.She saw Su Shi leaning against the wall while crossing his arms, looking at her with a cold smile on his face.Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s expression stiffened and she smiled, \u201cBrother Su Shi~\u201d\u201cStop right there.\u201dSu Shi pointed at his own face and gritted his teeth, \u201cCome on, take a closer look, where\u2019s my green face and fangs?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 \u2013 Your love will be taken care by me!Su Shi gritted his teeth.Although the old storyteller had embarrassed him, but \u201cgreen-faced and fanged\u201d was so outrageous, wasn\u2019t it?This naughty little fox!Yu Ren\u2019er smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019m just kidding, Su Shi brother is handsome, gentle and jade-like, he is simply a rare beautiful man in the world!\u201dSu Shi sneered: \u201cActually you\u2019re right. I like to eat people until there are no bones left, I especially like to eat little fox meat!\u201dYu Ren\u2019er\u2019s beautiful face turned red, her hands involuntarily closed behind her back and she stammered: \u201cNo, you can\u2019t eat little fox!\u201dThe last time she was touched in the ancient emperor\u2019s secret realm, it was clear that she had been left with a scratch on her heart.Su Shi held her shoulders and said unhappily: \u201cI had saved your life, but how can you end up smearing me behind my back?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s not true! I know that you are a good person, and I am always grateful.\u201dSu Shi asked, \u201cThen what happened just now?\u201dYu Lian\u2019er hesitated for a moment, then said in a low voice, \u201cI was just displeased when I saw those idiots.\u201dSu Shi pinched her chin and looked at her, \u201cCould it be, you like me, don\u2019t you?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er\u2019s cheeks flushed, and she stomped her foot: \u201cNo, I\u2019m just fighting for Chief Zhan.\u201dSu Shi froze for a moment, \u201cWhat does that have to do with it?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you in a relationship with Chief Zhan?\u201d\u201cOne is a genius of the Demonic path, the other is a genius of the Righteous path. The two are separated by the prejudices of the sect and the world, but they are still determined to be together. What a beautiful love story. How could those vulgar fans be allowed to intervene?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er raised her small fist and her eyes shone, \u201cYour love will be taken care by me!\u201dThud!Su Shi knocked her head and said, \u201cI thank you, but please just take care of yourself.\u201dThis silly and stupid love brain!Yu Ren\u2019er rubbed her forehead and said pitifully, \u201cThen can you stop getting angry, brother Su Shi?\u201dSu Shi said unhappily, \u201cDon\u2019t call me brother, it takes at least hundreds of years for a fox to mature, right? Maybe you can be my grandmother.\u201dYu Lian\u2019er said with a bloated face, \u201cI am not a fox spirit, but a white fox from Qingqiu! I just turned eighteen this year!\u201dOutsiders and Spirit Beasts were fundamentally different.A Spirit Beast is a Demon that forms after the beast is stimulated by spiritual power.Ordinary beasts are not spiritually intelligent and only retain the instinct to kill, while some powerful beasts can use their spiritual power, but it is difficult for them to embark on the path of cultivation.Outsiders are born in human form, but retain some beast characteristics.Their spiritual intelligence is equal to human spiritual intelligence, and they even have a better understanding of cultivation.Therefore, in the ancient emperor\u2019s stone tablet test, Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s talent was \u201cHeavenly Bone Charming\u201d, which is basically the same as humans.\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201dSu Shi was puzzled, \u201cAfter coming out of Tianqu Mountain, didn\u2019t you go straight back to the barbarian territory? How did you get here?\u201dThis was far from the Northern Region, and there were human cities along the way, how did she get here?\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201dYu Ren\u2019er sighed.When she was about to leave, Tianqu Mountain was blocked by the Imperial Guards, so she had to hide in the forest.It was difficult to wait until the Imperial Guards retreated, but then another conflict broke out in the barbarian territory and the border was completely closed by the Empire.She had no choice but to follow the Fengjiang River southward, trying to detour back through the Western Desert.Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s face was bitter, \u201cFortunately, I have a magic treasure spirit boat, so I can take the water route, otherwise, I will really be captured.\u201dCovering up the outsider\u2019s characteristics will continuously consume spiritual energy, and the slightest carelessness will make the disguise wear off. In the Southwest Region controlled by the Demonic path, if her identity is revealed, it will be a disaster for her.\u201cI\u2019m so miserable, brother Su Shi.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know if she was already familiar enough with Su Shi, but she grabbed the corner of Su Shi\u2019s shirt and cried.He said, \u201cHow dare you make quarrel with people in the restaurant, when you know it\u2019s dangerous here?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er sobbed, \u201cFor your love, I \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dLooking at the bustling crowd outside the alley, Su Shi said helplessly, \u201cForget it, you\u2019d better follow me first. \u201cThe two of them have gone through life and death experiences, and it is really not good to leave her alone here.\u201cYou are very kind, brother Su Shi!\u201dYu Ren\u2019er cried and smiled.Su Shi shook his head.Although this girl\u2019s brain is not good, her mouth is quite sweet.Baifeng Building.This was where the official sale was held.There were many people at the gate, all of them were officials, rich merchants and even cultivators.Cao Jie stood at the entrance with his men. The guests greeted him respectfully.But he only nodded slightly, his expression solemn, as if he was waiting for someone big. At that moment, a golden palanquin came slowly and stopped in front of the door.The attendant lifted the curtain and a luxuriously dressed young man stepped out of the palanquin.His face was white and beardless, his eyes were long and slanted, and he was not ugly, but he exuded a viper-like coldness.\u201cUncle Cao.\u201dThe young man greeted him with a smile.Cao Jie also showed a smile, \u201cNephew Li, you are here too?\u201dThis person was Li Yu, the eldest son of the Li family in Qianyang City.The Li family was a long-established family in Qianyang City, and its power was deeply rooted in the city.Li Yu said, \u201cI just came to join in the fun and show my support for Uncle Cao.\u201dCao Jie nodded and said, \u201cNephew is very kind, if you have something you like, just ask.\u201dThe two of them talked in front of the door, attracting many glances from the crowd.They thought this was the Li Yu Cao Jie had been waiting for.He said with a smile, \u201cUncle Cao, don\u2019t stand at the door, let\u2019s go in and talk.\u201dBut Cao Jie shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not in a hurry, nephew Li can go first.\u201dLi Yu stared vaguely.He was about to say something when Cao Jie suddenly left him and walked forward quickly.\u201cHuh?\u201dHe looked back in confusion.He saw Cao Jie bowed slightly and stood in front of a young man with a smile on his face, \u201cCommander Su, you\u2019re here, just as the official sale is about to start, I\u2019ll take you in.\u201dCommander Su?People were slightly stunned.How many commanders were named Su in Soutwest Region?And if he could even make Cao Jie so humble, his identity was obviously obvious.\u201cSu Shi!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Su Shi!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s actually here too!\u201dPeople sucked in a breath of cold air.This newly promoted pride of Demonic path, the super genius who had destroyed Zhan Qingchen, had actually come to Qianyang City?!Looking at the mysterious veiled young girl beside Su Shi, Cao Jie was puzzled, \u201cCommander Su, this\u2026\u201dSu Shi said indifferently, \u201cI picked her up on the street.\u201dCao Jie: \u201c\u2026..\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 \u2013 Good people according to Yu Ren\u2019erCao Jie was slightly stunned.When they first separated, Su Shi was still alone, but now there was a woman in black beside him.Although she was wearing a veil and couldn\u2019t see her face, her aura was unclear and unpredictable, at least she was a Golden Elixir cultivator!Picking up a Golden Elixir cultivator on the street?Of course Cao Jie didn\u2019t believe it.Most likely this was Su Shi\u2019s woman.No wonder he followed me to Qianyang City, so he hid a woman in this city.Cao Jie\u2019s thoughts changed, but his smile remained unchanged, \u201cPlease come inside.\u201d\u201cThank you, Commander Cao.\u201dSeveral people walked towards the Baifeng Building. People looked at the white-clothed man, upright and handsome, his eyes full of vigor.Su Shi.Originally, he was just a little-known town commander, but he rose to fame in a single battle in Yulin City and rose like a comet, becoming the hot new star of the Demonic path!In the Southwest Region, you might know Cao Jie, or Qiu Ao.But you definitely couldn\u2019t help but recognize Su Shi!They wanted to greet him, but they didn\u2019t know Su Shi\u2019s temperament yet, so they hesitated for a while.\u201cCommander Su.\u201dLi Yu smiled as he came over and said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard about Commander Su for a long time, but now that I\u2019ve seen it, you really are like a man from heaven!\u201dSu Shi raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cYou are \u2026\u2026\u201dCao Jie hurriedly introduced him, \u201cThis is the son of the Li family from Qianyang City, the Li family is one of the subordinate families of our Netherworld Sect.\u201dAs he spoke, he looked at Su Shi\u2019s expression, for fear of making him unhappy.Su Shi nodded, \u201cIt turns out Young Master Li.\u201dSince he was a follower of the Demonic path, he must have had a good relationship with Cao Jie, so he didn\u2019t need to put on an act.Cao Jie let out a sigh of relief.Li Yu\u2019s smile grew even bigger.Being able to talk to someone like Su Shi was a great honor.Noticing the envious gazes from people, Li Yu straightened his back slightly.At this moment, Yu Ren\u2019er whispered, \u201cBrother Su Shi, this man smells bad.\u201dSu Shi\u2019s heart was moved.The outsider race\u2019s senses were the sharpest, so she had reason to say so. But he didn\u2019t think much of it. He had nothing to do with this Li family\u2019s young master. Whether the other party is a good person or not, what does that have to do with him?\u201cCommander Su, please~!\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dSurrounded by the crowd, Su Shi entered the Baifeng Building.The pavilion was very large, and the interior was decorated very luxuriously, with display shelves made of spirit yuan wood on both sides, with many treasures and spiritual materials displayed on fans.Su Shi looked around, \u201cCommander Cao is indeed very rich.\u201dCao Jie smiled and said, \u201cThese all belong to the Chamber of Commerce, they have nothing to do with me.\u201dSu Shi laughed and did not expose him.The Thousand Suns Chamber of Commerce was made up of some of the city\u2019s major clans, and all the goods on this official sale were provided by them.The Chamber of Commerce, as a follower of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, was also Cao Jie\u2019s money pot.This was an unspoken fact that everyone knew.The official sale was held on the ground floor.Cao Jie tactfully organized Su Shi and Yu Ren\u2019er to go to the elegant room of the first floor.The view and privacy were excellent.After making sure no one was snooping around, Yu Ren\u2019er took off her hood, revealed her beautiful face, and let out a sigh of relief.She was a little nervous from being in the middle of the crowd just now.It was a good thing that people were in awe of Su Shi and did not dare to pay too much attention to her.Yu Ren\u2019er said curiously, \u201cBrother Su Shi, they all seem to be afraid of you?\u201dSu Shi glanced at her, \u201cAre you not afraid of me?\u201dStrange to say the least.This little fox was very defensive towards others, but she was very trusting and affectionate towards him.This was only the second time they had met, and she dared to go with him.Yu Ren\u2019er shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid, because I know you\u2019re a good person.\u201d\u201cI am a demon of the Demonic path, you know.\u201dSu Shi sneered, \u201cHow did you come to that conclusion?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er came up to him, her nose wrinkled slightly and she sniffed like a puppy.\u201cBecause brother Su Shi smells good.\u201d\u201cSmells \u2026\u2026 good?\u201dSu Shi froze for a moment.Yu Ren\u2019er said with a serious face, \u201cEveryone\u2019s body odor is different, the more evil thoughts people have, the more rotten and unpleasant they smell, I can smell from hundreds of meters away, brother Su Shi is really different.\u201d\u201cThe fragrance of your body is very special, it is clean and fresh and has a kind of fresh and delicate fragrance, as if it has been sealed for many years like heavenly fairy wine.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dSu Shi scratched his head.Smelling someone\u2019s fragrance and knowing that person\u2019s personality?This was the first time he had heard such words.Yu Ren\u2019er said, \u201cBesides, if you wanted to harm me, you wouldn\u2019t have saved me in the Ancient Emperor Secret Realm in the first place.\u201dSu Shi shook his head.Although he was not a good person, he also had his own principles.In that crisis situation, Yu Ren\u2019er chose to take the initiative to guard the rear, so he naturally wouldn\u2019t stand by and watch her die.Looking at Su Shi\u2019s handsome face, Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s face flushed slightly.She seemed to understand why the girls were so obsessed with him.Brother Su Shi is really handsome!Recalling that he grabbed her own tail in the secret realm, Yu Lian\u2019er lowered her head and her cheeks were hot.A strange thought appeared in her mind.#######The sale officially began.\u201cTen South Sea Spirit Grass, starting price: three middle-grade spirit stones!\u201dDONG~When the bell rang, everyone present could place their own bids.The auctioneer would repeat the highest bid three times, and if no one exceeded it, the auction would be successful.Looking at the silent audience below, the main auctioneer was stunned for a moment.\u201cNo one bid?\u201dIn the past, the official sales of the Thousand Suns Chamber of Commerce were the hottest, and the prices of valuable items could even be raised by more than ten times.But this time, the first item had to be sold out?After a while, someone wavered and said, \u201cFour middle-grade spirit stones.\u201d\u201cFour middle-grade spirit stones, first bid\u2026. second bid\u2026.\u201d\u201cSold!\u201dThe main auctioneer and the bidders breathed a sigh of relief at the same time.One was happy that the auction was not canceled, and the other was happy that Su Shi did not want the item.\u201cNext item, Bright Thousand Flame Curtain, starting price: five middle-grade spirit stones.\u201dAfter the bidding, the scene once again became deathly quiet.The main auctioneer was dumbfounded.What the hell is this!On the first floor, Su Shi\u2019s helpless voice rang out, \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much, I\u2019ll only bid on items that I really want.\u201dWith these words, the scene gradually became more lively.The official sale continued.However, as each item was put up for sale, people would wait for a while to make sure Su Shi didn\u2019t want it before bidding.\u201cSanyang Yi Qi Sword, starting price: four middle-grade spirit stones.\u201d\u201cHundred Refining Pills, starting price: three \u2026\u2026 sold.\u201d\u201cHoam.\u201dSu Shi yawned, his interest lacking.To ordinary people, these might be treasures, but to him, they were completely unworthy in his eyes.At this moment, an item was presented.Su Shi frowned and sat up straight.\u201cThis is \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOne mysterious fire seed, starting price: three high-grade spirit stones!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 \u2013 Yu Ren\u2019er, Goddess of the weaboo!\u201cIt turned out to be a fire seed?\u201dSu Shi\u2019s eyes were astonished.There was a piece of jade on the stage that exuded a cold aura, and within it was a teardrop-shaped red flame.The flame wavered slightly, and even through the cold jade, one could still feel the searing heat.\u201cThis is a good item!\u201dOn the stage, the main auctioneer introduced, \u201cThis is a mysterious fire found in the cold northern land, no method can extinguish it, its function is unknown for now, starting bid: three high-grade spirit stones.\u201d\u201cTen high-grade spirit stones.\u201dSu Shi\u2019s voice came from the first floor.Although there would be no one to raise the price with him even if he only added one spirit stone.However, he still offered the high price of ten high-grade spirit stones.After all, this was an official sale organized by Cao Jie, and since the other party was giving him face, he couldn\u2019t let others suffer too much.Besides, the fire might be useless to others, but to him, it was a treasure that couldn\u2019t be exchanged for a thousand pieces of gold!Cao Jie understood, and cupped his hands towards the first floor.After three repetitions, the main auctioneer dropped his hammer: \u201cTen high-grade spirit stones, sold!\u201dThis was Su Shi\u2019s first time bidding, so naturally no one wanted to spoil his excitement.\u201cCongratulations, Commander Su.\u201d\u201cCommander Su has a great sense of style!\u201d\u201cYou have good eyesight.\u201d\u201cEven though I don\u2019t understand it, this fire is certainly marvelous!\u201dThe audience clapped and cheered, very excited.Private room on the first floor.Knock, knock, knock, knock.There was a knock on the door.The slender maid entered with a tray and said in a smooth voice, \u201cCommander Su, Commander Cao asked me to bring something for you first.\u201dThe servant girl\u2019s eyes were clear and she looked at Su Shi without blinking.How handsome he is!Commander Su was even more handsome than rumored!Seeing the servant girl\u2019s growing appearance, Yu Ren\u2019er said coldly, \u201cIf you dare to look at him one more time, I will gouge out your eyes!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dThe servant girl was shocked, \u201cI, I apologize!!!\u201dAfter putting down the jade, she hurriedly retreated.Su Shi said helplessly, \u201cWhy are you scaring that girl?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er\u2019s fierce feigned expression melted in an instant, muttering in a small voice: \u201cIt\u2019s her own fault for looking at you!\u201dSu Shi shook his head.He stretched out his hand to pick up the cold jade, smashed it directly, and the sealed fire seed fell into his palm.The room was instantly heated by heat waves!This kind of fire cannot be absorbed or controlled, and the Chamber of Commerce does not know what it does.In fact, this is the \u201cfuel\u201d of the Fire Core!By devouring the flames, the power of the Fire Core could be increased.If it\u2019s consuming enough, the Fire Core might even metamorphose and become an even stronger fire!Su Shi\u2019s palm lit up with Blue Sky Heavenly Flame and inserted a fire seed into it.The blue-green flame surged!The divine flame became purer, as if a clear spring flowing quietly, but containing explosive power!\u201cIts power has increased by at least thirty percent!\u201dSu Shi\u2019s eyes were shocked.This fire energy was surprisingly high!Without mentioning anything else, this fire seed alone already made his journey worthwhile!Feeling the terrifying aura coming from the first floor, the people\u2019s backs chilled slightly.Most likely this aura is close to the Late Stage of Golden Elixir Realm, right?As expected of Commander Su!There were only a few items that Su Shi could see in the next auction.When he stopped bidding, the crowd was no longer worried and the bidding became much more intense.Yu Ren\u2019er yawned in boredom.Suddenly, a strange object was brought to the front of the stage.It was a pure black ring with a ring of sharp spikes on the outside.\u201cBeast ring, starting price: one high-grade spirit stone!\u201dYu Ren\u2019er immediately sat up straight and stared straight at the ring.Su Shi wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cWhen I saw it, I felt my countryman\u2019s aura from there.\u201d\u201cCountryman?\u201dSu Shi froze for a moment.At that moment, Li Yu said loudly, \u201cI will pay four high-grade spirit stones! \u201dHe could see that he was panting, and his pale face looked excited.It was obvious that he had come for this item!Li Yu stood up, smiled, and cupped his hands: \u201cThis is just a gadget for fun, and it\u2019s not useful for everyone, so please let me have it.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Li is too polite.\u201d\u201cIf Young Master Li likes it, you can have it.\u201dThis is an unknown item, and probably not everyone can use it, so it\u2019s better to let Li Yu buy it.\u201cFour high-grade spirit stones, first offer\u2026.\u201dLi Yu\u2019s smile grew bigger and bigger.Just then, a voice came from the first floor:\u201cTen high-grade spirit stones, I will buy it.\u201dThe scene instantly became deathly quiet.Li Yu\u2019s smile froze on his face.How could Su Shi make another offer?He changed his expression, hesitated for a moment, but sat back down silently.Even if he had ten guts, he wouldn\u2019t dare to compete with Su Shi!\u201cStrange, what does Su Shi want this thing for? Could it be that he is also \u2026\u2026\u201dLi Yu\u2019s eyes flashed, not knowing what he was thinking.\u201cTen high-grade spirit stones, sold!\u201dThe main auctioneer dropped the gavel.Just like last time, the item was quickly sent to the first floor, this time the maid lowered her head, not daring to look at Su Shi.Su Shi picked up the beast ring and casually threw it to Yu Lian\u2019er.Yu Lian\u2019er was stunned for a moment, \u201cThis\u2026 is for me?\u201dSu Shi frowned, \u201cYou don\u2019t want it?\u201d\u201cI want it!\u201dThe smile on Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s face broke out and she said sweetly, \u201cThank you brother Su Shi!\u201d\u201cNo problem, it\u2019s just some spirit stones.\u201dSu Shi didn\u2019t think anything of it.This thing is called a beast ring, it should be used to tame beasts, it has no use for him.Yu Ren\u2019er played with that thing for a long time.There was a hook on it that could break the ring, but there was no response when she injected spiritual energy.She was puzzled: \u201cHow does this thing really work?\u201dSu Shi looked at the shape and said, \u201cIf I\u2019m right, it\u2019s a neck ring.\u201d\u201cA neck ring?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er curiously placed it on her neck.It clicked!The clasp automatically locked and the neck ring tightened violently.Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s body froze, and her spiritual energy was sealed as if it had been sealed!Two pointed ears emerged from her veil, and her furry tail swept under her black dress.She sat on a chair, her face flushed, her eyes misty, and she said sadly, \u201cHelp me, I have no more energy~\u201dSu Shi covered his forehead.\u201cI said it\u2019s a neck ring, who told you to put it on yourself?\u201dThis stupid fox!Yu Ren\u2019er had a pretty face, long animal ears, and a thorn neck ring on her snow-white neck.It looked very beautiful in a different way.Su Shi cupped his chin and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity there are no weaboos here, otherwise you would be considered a goddess by them.\u201dYu Ren\u2019er was so embarrassed that she covered her face and said, \u201cBrother Su Shi, please take it off for me quickly.\u201dIt was too embarrassing to look like this!Su Shi got up and walked over.\u201cNo, don\u2019t scratch my ears!\u201d\u201cSo this is real?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s real! Ah, my tail, don\u2019t touch my tail either!!!\u201d1. \u4e8c\u523a\u8788 ===> Two Spiked Salamander, is a term to refer to \u201ctwo-dimensional\u201d used as a mockery, for English translation it may be equivalent to otaku or weaboo.

    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 \u2013 Brother Su Shi, I want to kill this guy!The auction officially ended.The people dispersed one after another.After a long time, the door of the elegant room on the first floor opened.Su Shi walked out with his hands behind his back.Yu Ren\u2019er wore a veil, her head bowed low, and her steps staggered slightly.\u201cThis is embarrassing.\u201dShe could not cry.When she thought of what had just happened, she wanted to find a hole in the ground.Who would have thought that a beast ring could limit an outsider\u2019s spiritual power?Looking at Su Shi\u2019s back, she bit her lip, her face red.This bad guy!He\u2019s not just laughing at me, he\u2019s seizing the opportunity to bully me!My tail was squeezed again, I really can\u2019t get married this time, woo woo woo~Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s heart was filled with sadness and anger.She walked out of the Baifeng Building.Cao Jie was waiting outside the door.When he saw the two of them come out, he immediately greeted them and said with a smile, \u201cCommander Su, did you get something you like this time?\u201dSu Shi nodded and said, \u201cIf there are any more auctions in the future, please let me know.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201dCao Jie\u2019s chest was racing, \u201cIf there are good things, I will definitely contact Commander Su.\u201dSu Shi smiled, \u201cThank you very much.\u201d\u201cYou are too kind.\u201dCao Jie said enthusiastically, \u201cSince you are here in Qianyang City, why don\u2019t you stay for a few more days and stay in my house if you don\u2019t mind.\u201dSu Shi glanced at Yu Ren\u2019er and shook his head, \u201cI have something to do, I\u2019ll come back next time to trouble Commander Cao.\u201dCao Jie looked at him and his heart was like a clear mirror.\u201cGood, then be careful, Commander Su.\u201d\u201cCommander Cao, take care of yourself.\u201dSeeing that their backs were getting farther and farther apart, the boulder finally came off Cao Joe\u2019s shoulder.Although they were both commanders, their statuses were very different.In the first place, Cao Jie would likely never break through from the Golden Elixir Realm in his entire life, and becoming the Commander of Qianyang City was the pinnacle in his life career.However, Su Shi had boundless potential and talent, and would never be limited to the Southwest Region alone.He might even be able to take over the entire Netherworld Rakshasa Sect in the future!He was under a lot of pressure to associate with such a person.At this moment, the chambermaid came out, \u201cCommander Cao, here is the money for the items that Commander Su bid on at the auction just now\u2026.\u201dCao Jie waved his hand and said, \u201cIt\u2019s only twenty high-grade spirit stones, forget it.\u201dThe income he earned should have been more than 20 high-grade spirit stones. But this time, because of Su Shi\u2019s participation, the guests did not dare to bid, and he indirectly lost a lot of money.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not \u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe servant took out a jade shining with divine light and swallowed, \u201cCommander Su gave a golden marrow .\u201dCao Jie was stunned.After a long silence, he spoke: \u201cTell the Chamber of Commerce, in the future, if they find a similar fire, keep everything for me!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201cCommander Su \u2026\u2026 has a big heart!\u201d#######\u201cCommander Su, wait a moment!\u201dThe two of them had not gone too far when a call came from behind them.They both looked back and saw Li Yu walking quickly.Yu Ren\u2019er quietly took a few steps back.For some reason, she had a deep dislike for this man.Li Yu walked over and asked, \u201cIs Commander Su going home?\u201dSu Shi frowned and said, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201dLi Yu said with a smile, \u201cSince you\u2019re here, why don\u2019t you go to the Li residence and let me do my best to entertain you.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dSu Shi was not interested in talking to him.Li Yu saw this and hurriedly said, \u201cCommander Su, actually I also have the same hobby!\u201dSu Shi was stunned for a moment, \u201c The same hobby?\u201d\u201cWhat I mean is that beast ring.\u201d\u201cThat thing \u2026\u2026 hehe, you know exactly what I mean. I have a lot of good things there, why doesn\u2019t Commander Su go to my place to have fun?\u201dLi Yu smiled strangely.Su Shi seems to have thought of something, \u201cYou mean \u2026\u2026\u201dLi Yu looked around, lowered his voice and said,\u201cOf course it is outsider slaves!\u201dYu Ren\u2019er\u2019s body trembled slightly.The outsiders have a special appearance and have unique beast features, and some rich people are fond of keeping such slaves.But their endings are often very miserable.\u201cBrother Su Shi \u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Ren\u2019er quietly grabbed the corner of his clothes.Su Shi was silent for a moment, then nodded: \u201cAlright. Young Master Li, you can lead the way.\u201dLi Yu looked very happy and hurriedly said, \u201cThis way, please!\u201dIf we could get closer to Su Shi, it would be a great blessing for the Li family!We must treat him well this time!Li Yu quietly made up his mind.Li family residence.Li Yu pushed open the door and shouted, \u201cCommander Su has arrived, why don\u2019t you guys come out to greet him?\u201dEveryone in the residence was shocked.Li Xun, the head of the Li family, stepped out.\u201cCommander Su?\u201dSeeing the handsome man dressed in white, Li Xun was slightly overwhelmed for a moment.Su Shi?That legendary super genius?!How does this great god come here!Li Yu glowed red and had a satisfied expression on his face.He could invite Su Shi to his home, which gave him a lot of face!Su Shi didn\u2019t bother to greet each other, and said directly: \u201cDidn\u2019t Young Master Li say that there are good stuffs? Take me to see it first.\u201dLi Yu led them to the backyard.When they got to a room, they saw a big lock on the door.Li Yu took out the key, opened the door, and bowed, \u201cPlease go ahead.\u201dHe walked into the room.Looking at the scene in front of him, Su Shi let out a small sigh.Sure enough.It was just as he thought.Several outsiders were locked up here, panting and dying, looking at their injuries, they should have suffered a lot of torture.Li Yu smiled gloomily and said, \u201cThe Empire has been tight recently, so I had to try hard to get these. Commander Su can take any one as you like.\u201dSu Shi asked: \u201cIs this all?\u201dLi Yu shrugged, \u201cThe previous ones are all dead.\u201dYu Lian\u2019er trembled slightly and said in a low voice , \u201cBrother Su Shi, I want to kill this guy.\u201dSu Shi did not speak, turned around and walked out of the room leaving the two of them behind.Looking at the closed door of the room, Li Yu scratched his head in confusion, \u201cCommander Su this\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAn, an outsider?\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201dOutside the compartment.Su Shi stood at the door.Listening to the miserable wailing in the room, Li Xun\u2019s throat was a little tight, \u201cCommander Su, what is this? Why does it sound like Yu\u2019er\u2019s voice?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be able to hear it later.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHalf a column of incense later, the shouting stopped abruptly.The door to the room opened and Yu Ren\u2019er came out, her face expressionless.Su Shi asked, \u201cWhere are your clanmates?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er said in a low voice: \u201cThey were determined to die and I granted their wish.\u201d\u201cYu\u2019er?!\u201dSeeing the tragic situation inside the house, Li Xun almost fainted, pointing a trembling finger at them, \u201cYou, you really killed my son?!\u201dYu Ren\u2019er said coldly, \u201cHow many more people did your son kill?\u201dLi Xun\u2019s eyes turned red as he hissed, \u201cBut it\u2019s the outsider race! The outsiders\u2019 lives are worth nothing, how can they compare to my Yu\u2019er!\u201dYu Ren\u2019er was stunned.Her face was pale, her chest was tight, and her body trembled slightly.She wanted to say something, but no words came out.Swish!Sword Qi swept past.Li Xun\u2019s head flew into the sky.Su Shi shook the ice blue sword and held his cold hand, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to his nonsense, you are very precious to me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 \u2013 Your Majesty Empress and Little Fox, Su Shi\u2019s Complicated Relationship.The head of the family and the first son died tragically, the Li residence instantly exploded into a frenzy.The crowd was filled with horror.The guards with swords in their hands surrounded them, but no one dared to take half a step forward.That man was a figure they absolutely must not touch.This was Su Shi!Without even considering his background, who would be his opponent based on his strength alone?They thought Li Yu had brought a precious guest, but they did not expect that he had brought a deadly disaster!Su Shi\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly.Yu Lian\u2019er grabbed his arm tightly.\u201cBrother Su Shi, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dSu Shi led her towards the gate.The guards retreated and consciously made way, watching the two walk out.No one dared to move as they looked at each other.It didn\u2019t take long for Cao Jie to arrive with a large group of people.Looking at the bodies of Li Xun and his son, Cao Jie\u2019s eyes were cold and he said angrily, \u201cWho? Who did it!\u201dAs a member of the Thousand Sun Chamber of Commerce, the Li family was a long-established pillar, bringing it huge profits every year!Who else in Qianyang City would dare to touch his money pot?\u201cIt\u2019s Su Shi!\u201dThe Li family elder said sadly: \u201cYu\u2019er kindly invited him as a guest, but he suddenly went on a killing spree, and even our clan leader did not escape him!\u201d\u201cSu Shi?\u201dCao Jie froze.Why would Su Shi want to kill Li Yu?Looking at Li Yu\u2019s mutilated corpse, and thinking about the beast ring Su Shi auctioned off, he vaguely understood something.\u201cCommander Cao, you must do something for us!\u201d\u201cWe must be given an answer to this matter!\u201d\u201cOur Li family has donated a lot of money to the You Luo Clan!\u201dAs soon as Su Shi left, the crowd\u2019s emotions immediately rose.\u201cWant an explanation?\u201d\u201cGood, then I\u2019ll give an explanation.\u201dCao Jie said in a loud voice: \u201cLi Xun and his son kept the outsider slaves personally and violated the laws of the Empire, so Commander Su did the right thing for heaven and killed them on the spot!\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201dThe crowd was dumbfounded.Breaking the laws of the empire?Since when did the Demonic path start talking about laws?\u201dThe elder of the Li family gritted his teeth and said, \u201cI can\u2019t accept it \u2026\u2026\u201dBang!A bloody hole appeared on his brow and he slowly fell to the ground.Blood flowed freely.Cao Jie\u2019s fingertips smoked and his gaze swept the crowd, \u201cIs there anyone else who can\u2019t accept it?\u201dThe crowd fell silent, their faces pale and a chill ran down their spines!\u201cFrom today onwards, the Li family is no longer a family affiliated with the Netherworld Sect.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201dAfter saying that, Cao Jie led his men to leave.There was no sound in the Li residence.At this moment, a thought appeared in everyone\u2019s minds:The Li family, it\u2019s over!They couldn\u2019t understand how,Li Yu only participated in the official sale, but why was the entire Li family involved?#####The boat swam down the river.The northern border was blocked, so Yu Ren\u2019er had to take a detour through the Western Desert to return, and it happened to pass through Fengsha City.Thus, the two of them were traveling together.Yu Ren\u2019er sat on the bow of the boat, her eyes blankly looking into the distance.Su Shi stood behind her and sighed, \u201cThere are actually many people who have such thoughts.\u201dIn the eyes of most people, the lives of outsiders were truly worthless.\u201cI know.\u201dYu Ren\u2019er said in a low voice: \u201cOn the border of the Barbarian Realm, this kind of thing also happens every day.\u201dThere are nine realms in this world.The Linlang Kingdom belongs to the Shuojin Realm, which borders the Barbarian Realm where outsiders live, and the border conflicts have never subsided since ancient times.The conflict between the two races has a long history, and it is not something that can be explained in a simple way.Yu Ren\u2019er suddenly asked: \u201cSu Shi brother, you said I am very precious to you \u2026\u2026 is that true?\u201dSu Shi nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201dYu Ren\u2019er said curiously, \u201cIn that case, how much am I worth?\u201dSu Shi thought for a moment, \u201cTen high-grade spirit stones.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er was a little confused.Su Shi smiled and said, \u201cBecause that beast ring consumed ten spirit stones.\u201dYu Ren\u2019er\u2019s pretty face turned red and she hit him hard.\u201cBastard!\u201dThinking of the effect of the beast ring, Su Shi\u2019s smile tightened and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s not a good thing, you\u2019d better throw it away.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dYu Ren\u2019er shook her head, \u201cIt was a gift from you, I won\u2019t throw it away.\u201dSu Shi said helplessly, \u201cYou won\u2019t wear it anyway, so what\u2019s the point of keeping it?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er was silent for a moment and blushed, \u201cDo you, want to see me wearing it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026\u2026\u201dSu Shi was at a loss for words.To be honest, he really wanted to see it.Yu Ren\u2019er whispered and muttered, \u201cThen you must promise first, not to hold my tail.\u201dAfter half a cup of tea.Looking at the shy girl in front of him, Su Shi\u2019s heartbeat slightly increased.Yu Lian\u2019er was wearing a black neck ring, her tail swayed slightly, her pretty face seemed to reflect the snow in the morning sun, and she said nervously:\u201cOkay, does it look good?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut I thought you would reject something like that. Moreover, you just experienced a terrible thing just now.\u201dYu Ren\u2019er\u2019s fingers intertwined and said softly, \u201cBrother Su Shi is different from others \u2026\u2026 Ren\u2019er is willing to show it to you.\u201dThe waves hit, and the spirit boat shook.Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s legs faltered, and she fell into Su Shi\u2019s arms.Looking at the beautiful face so close, Su Shi sighed, \u201cBe careful.\u201dAlthough he was unintentional, but after all he is someone with the talent of Heavenly Bone Charming, and every move has a charming charm.It was hard to bear it!Looking at Su Shi\u2019s deep eyes, Yu Lian\u2019er\u2019s heart fluttered, and those glittering eyes seemed to be filled with mist.I kind of feel bad for Chief Zhan.No, no, isn\u2019t this the same as the fox spirits written in the book that destroy people\u2019s relationships?But\u2026. brother Su Shi\u2019s hug is so warm.Forget it, let\u2019s hug for a while.Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s mind wandered, then \u2026\u2026Looking at the little fox purring in his arms, Su Shi frowned slightly, \u201cDoes she have too big a heart, or does he not treat me as a man?!\u201dFengsha City, the commander\u2019s residence.Bai Qing looked nervously at Yun Qiluo who was drinking tea.\u201cDidn\u2019t Your Majesty Empress leave, why did you suddenly come back?\u201d\u201cMy Master happened to be out.\u201dYun Qiluo asked aloud, \u201cDid Su Shi say when he would return?\u201dBai Qing grimaced, \u201cHe said he should be back tonight.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dYun Qiluo nodded her head.It was not Su Shi\u2019s fault for what happened that night, after all, he was the one who took the initiative to go to the other party\u2019s room.Besides, he was still in a coma at the time.My words were a bit outrageous when I left, I don\u2019t know if it will scare him?What if he doesn\u2019t return to the sect for a few more years?Yun Qiluo\u2019s heart was anxious.She had already arrived at the sect, but finally returned to Fengsha City, just to explain to Su Shi.Unexpectedly, the other party had gone to Qianyang City \u2026\u2026\u201cMaster is back!\u201dAt this moment, Bai Qing\u2019s voice sounded.\u201cSu Shi, you\u2019re back \u2026\u2026\u201dYun Qiluo raised his head to look.Pop.The teacup fell to the ground and broke.Only to see Su Shi holding a soundly sleeping young girl, looking at him with a dumbfounded expression.\u201cYour, Your Majesty?!\u201d1. In Chinese and East Asian folklore, foxes are depicted as a spirit possessed of magic powers. These foxes are often depicted as mischievous, usually tricking other people, with the ability to disguise themselves as a beautiful woman.Although the specifics of the tales vary, these fox spirits can usually shapeshift, often taking the form of beautiful young women who attempt to seduce men, whether for mere mischief or to consume their bodies or spirits.2.

After getting off the ship, he carried her back to the commander\u2019s residence, intending to let her rest for a while first.The result \u2026\u2026Looking at Yun Qiluo, whose jade cheeks were cold in front of him, Su Shi froze in place like a statue.Why did the Demon Empress come back again?\u201cAhem, wake up, don\u2019t sleep.\u201dSu Shi shook the little fox in his arms.Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s mouth gaped as she muttered something and changed her position to hug his neck.Noticing Yun Qiluo\u2019s increasingly cold face, Su Shi quietly grabbed her fox\u2019s tail.\u201cMmmm \u223c!!!\u201dYu Ren\u2019er\u2019s body trembled slightly.She opened her dazed eyes and wriggled her body in defiance, sneering, \u201cBastard, pinching my tail again~\u201dThe corner of Su Shi\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come down first?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dRealizing something was wrong, she looked back in confusion.She saw a bright and beautiful woman looking at her coldly.The cold air spread from her spine to the back of her head, and her outsider race instinct told her:This woman is extremely dangerous!Even the powerful clan leader had never given her this feeling!Yu Ren\u2019er hid behind Su Shi and said timidly, \u201cBrother Su Shi, who is she?\u201dSu Shi did not answer.He bowed to the fair-skinned woman and said, \u201cI welcome Your Majesty Demon Empress.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er froze for a moment, and then her scalp instantly exploded.\u201cDemon, Demon Empress?!\u201dA cold-blooded, ruthless, and vicious Demon Empress from the Netherworld who killed people like drinking water?Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s legs became weak.In Tianqu Mountain, hiding in the forest, she had seen the Demon Empress\u2019 overwhelming power with her own eyes!With the Constitution of Heaven in her mouth, her words were law!The mighty Imperial Guards Commander was almost reduced to ashes!Now that terrifying woman was standing in front of her?Yun Qiluo\u2019s expression was indifferent, \u201cDidn\u2019t you go to Qianyang City?\u201dSu Shi nodded his head, \u201cI did go to Qianyang City.\u201dYun Qiluo asked again, \u201cThen?\u201dSu Shi said honestly, \u201cI took part in an official sale and killed two people.\u201d\u201cOfficial sale?\u201dYun Qiluo said indifferently, \u201cSo you bought this fox back?\u201dSu Shi scratched his head, \u201cThat\u2019s not right, it should be regarded as picking it up \u2026\u2026\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s phoenix eyes narrowed slightly, sneering: \u201cQingqiu fox tribe, the nobility of the outsider race, and also has the body of Heavenly Bone Charming, the talent is no less than High-grade perfect, you said you picked it up?\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you go and pick one up for me?\u201dQingqiu fox tribe is a noble tribe among outsiders!This young girl is extremely talented and is the best talent among outsiders, how could such a genius appear in the inner of a dangerous human race settlement?Moreover, looking at their intimate appearance just now, their relationship was definitely not simple!Besides, the two of them were very close.Yu Ren\u2019er flew into his body and hung in the air like a puppet on a string.Looking at the frightened eyes, Yun Qiluo\u2019s voice was indifferent: \u201cWhat is your name?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er said in a trembling voice, \u201c My name is Yu Ren\u2019er.\u201d\u201cWho is Yu Yuan to you?\u201d\u201cUh, that\u2019s my father.\u201d\u201cSo you are the daughter of the Patriarch.\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s eyes flashed with a murderous aura, \u201cNow the situation at the border is tense, if you die in the Linlang Empire, it will be like pouring oil on the fire, the outsider race will never stop, then Feng Chaoge will go crazy.\u201d\u201cMy sect can take advantage of the situation and attack from the north and south to form an encirclement, to fight for the Central Plains and attack the Imperial Palace!\u201d\u201cSo for the sake of my sect\u2019s hegemony \u2026\u2026\u201dYu Ren\u2019er was terrified, tears merged in her big eyes, and she shouted in a loud voice.\u201cI don\u2019t want to die, I\u2019m not even married yet!\u201d\u201cHuuu~, Brother Su Shi, without me, you should be fine on your own.\u201d\u201cWhen I die, please take my corpse back to the Barbarian Realm, and remember to burn a few chicken legs every year on the anniversary of my death, I heard that it is cold and dark there and there is no food\u2026. Huuuu~~!!!\u201dHer cheeks were puckered, her speech was incoherent, and her tears flowed like a fountain.Su Shi said helplessly: \u201cYour Majesty, she\u2019s timid, so don\u2019t scare her.\u201dYun Qiluo glared at him, \u201cYou think I\u2019m joking?\u201dSu Shi shook his head, \u201cYour Majesty is not that cruel.\u201dYun Qiluo coldly snorted, \u201cI am cold and cruel, slaughtering people like grass, there is no one more cruel than me in the world!\u201d\u201cBut I know that it\u2019s all an illusion. Your Majesty looks cold on the surface, but inside she is gentle and beautiful.\u201dYun Qiluo: \u2211 (\u2460V\u2460?She looked a little confused, \u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201dIt was clear that she was so cold and cruel that even the sect elders and the four saints dared not look her in the eye.But in Su Shi\u2019s eyes, she was gentle and beautiful?That must be a lie!Su Shi shrugged his shoulders, \u201cI speak from my heart.\u201dNo matter how the Demon Empress treated others, she was indeed very kind to him, that was an indisputable fact.Yun Qiluo was silent.After a long time.She raised her hand and the void broke, revealing a vast wilderness in darkness!\u201cBabarian, Barbarian Realm?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er is dumbfounded.Before she could react, Yun Qiluo threw her straight into it.As if traveling through time and space, Yu Ren\u2019er instantly arrived at the Wilderness of the Barbarian Realm and fell from a height.Bang!Falling on the soft grass, she was still a little dazed.I can\u2019t believe I survived the Demon Empress?Looking at the slowly closing crack, Su Shi said with a smile: \u201cThank you for your Majesty\u2019s kindness.\u201dHe said and walked out with his hands behind his back.Su Shi stood awkwardly in place.After a while, Yun Qiluo returned to the door and said with a frown, \u201cWhat are you waiting for, why don\u2019t you follow me?\u201dSu Shi froze for a moment, \u201cThis subordinate is going back with you?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to?\u201d\u201cOf course I do.\u201dSu Shi hurriedly and quickly followed.The two of them took to the air and flew towards the southern border.Looking at the slow-moving scenery below them, Su Shi wondered, \u201cYour Majesty, why don\u2019t we just cross the void?\u201dEven Your Majesty was able to break through the Barbarian Realm, so wouldn\u2019t returning to the sect just be a matter of a blink of an eye?Yun Qiluo\u2019s eyes flashed, and she said, \u201cCrossing the void consumes too much energy, so I can\u2019t use it continuously, I just used it once, and now I can only fly slowly.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dThe two of them flew in silence, and the atmosphere was quiet, with only the wind whistling in their ears.After a while, Yun Qiluo suddenly asked, \u201cDo you like fox spirits?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSu Shi lost his balance and almost fell out of the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 \u2013 Your Majesty, you are not jealous, are you?\u201cWhat does Your Majesty mean by this?\u201dSu Shi froze.Yun Qiluo turned her head and said in a low voice, \u201cI heard that some people have unique preferences and likes with the appearance of half-human half-beasts, and you are so close to that white fox, so you must have such a fetish.\u201dSu Shi touched his nose.I didn\u2019t expect the Demon Empress to know so much!The combination of a young girl, furry ears, and a tail did have a strange charm.Of course, the prerequisite was that they were beautiful. For example, Yu Ren\u2019er.She had a slender and delicate figure and looked sweet.After wearing the neck ring, she was so soft and weak that even her ears turned pink, which would have made thousands of otakus go crazy in his previous life.It was a bit hypocritical if Su Shi said that he didn\u2019t like her.Seeing him not speaking for a long time, how could Yun Qiluo not understand, coldly said: \u201cDisgusting!\u201dSu Shi smiled bitterly and said, \u201cEveryone likes beauty, so why do you find me disgusting?\u201dYun Qiluo glared at him, \u201cThen you think she\u2019s beautiful?\u201d\u201cCough cough, of course, Your Majesty is much more beautiful.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dYun Qiluo turned her head away from him.Seeing that cold side of her face, Su Shi\u2019s brows furrowed slightly.The Demon Empress seems to be interested in my feelings?Chen Qingluan, Bai Qing, Yu Ren\u2019er \u2026\u2026 Whenever a woman appeared by his side, Demon Empress would act extremely angry.It is reasonable to say that this sect does not prohibit love between men and women, and even fellow brothers and sisters have formed cultivation couples.Su Shi was already twenty years old, so it was normal to have a woman.However, the Demon Emperor was very concerned about this.Su Shi said carefully, \u201cYour Majesty, you\u2019re not jealous, are you?\u201d\u201cJealous?\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s body swayed and she almost fell through the clouds.Her ears were slightly red and her eyes were slightly panicked, \u201cNonsense, why should I be jealous of you?\u201d\u201cBut-\u201c\u201cShut up!\u201dBefore he could finish his words, Yun Qiluo broke through the void and ran away.Su Shi cupped his chin and thought deeply.\u201cThe Demon Empress she \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way she really likes me!\u201d#####Youzhou Rift Valley.Cen Yiren lay on her bed, like a salted fish.\u201cWhere did Su Shi go?\u201d\u201cHe must have gone out for fun, he really didn\u2019t invite me~!\u201dSince returning from Tianqu Mountain, she had not seen any trace of Su Shi.Thinking about the time they had spent together before, it felt like she was dreaming.Although Cen Yiren was the senior sister of the inner sect, a Super-grade heavenly pride, and her strength was considered second to none in the younger generation.But Cen Baihu rarely let her leave the sect. He said that she was too hot-tempered and had a bad brain, and that she was easily deceived.This time she went to the Northern Region with Su Shi. This was the first time she was in the \u201coutside world\u201d in the true sense.Although Su Shi\u2019s attitude was bad, he actually took care of her and saved her life at a critical moment.Cen Yiren hugged a pillow and punched the pillow as if she imagined it was a vile man.The door knocked.At that moment, the door to the room knocked.A disciple\u2019s voice came from outside the door, \u201cSenior Sister Cen, the new disciples of the inner sect have gathered and are waiting for you to go and give them a lecture.\u201dCen Yiren did not even look up and said, \u201cThere is nothing to lecture, let them disperse.\u201dThe disciple said, \u201cThis is a request from the elder.\u201d\u201cWhat a nuisance.\u201dCen Yiren got up helplessly.Wendao Terrace.A group of young disciples stood here, their expressions full of excitement and anticipation.Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, the top-tier demon sect that oppressed the Nine Regions!To enter the inner sect meant that they would have access to true inheritance and abundant cultivation resources!The status of this sect was even greater than before!Who would not dare to give face to the Netherworld Sect in the three continents to the south?Cen Yiren crossed her arms,, her expression cold.It wasn\u2019t like she was intentionally intimidating them, but she really didn\u2019t know what to say.She was good at beating people up, but it was rather difficult to lecture them.Time passed.The atmosphere gradually became somewhat awkward.At that moment, a familiar voice rang out: \u201cSenior Sister Cen.\u201dCen Yiren looked back immediately.She saw a white robe slowly descending from the air.\u201cSu Shi, you\u2019re back!\u201dHer smile unconsciously expanded.Seeing that beautiful smile, the disciples on the side all froze.Is this the same cold-faced senior sister who was cynical a moment ago?\u201cIt\u2019s Su Shi!\u201d\u201cHis talent surpasses Zhan Qingchen and his strength destroys Chen Qingluan, the new super genius of the Demon Path!\u201d\u201cI saw him destroy the Soul Jade Perception stone with my own eyes!\u201d\u201cCommander Su is even more handsome than rumored!\u201dThe eyes of the disciples were filled with praise.The name of this new star of the Demonic path was too loud!Su Shi was confused, \u201cSenior Sister Cen, what are you guys doing?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re \u2026\u2026\u201dWith a twinkle in her eyes, Cen Yiren cleared her throat and said, \u201cCommander Su happens to be here, so let\u2019s let him give you all a lecture.\u201d\u201cLecture?\u201dSu Shi froze for a moment.There was loud applause.Seeing Cen Yiren\u2019s satisfied face, Su Shi reacted and shook his head helplessly.Clearly, he had been framed.But the matter had already come to this point, he can\u2019t just turn around and leave, or just say a few words.His eyes swept over the crowd.They were all new disciples in this sect, most of their faces were young, and there were even children who were seven or eight years old.Su Shih was silent for a long time, and then said: \u201cWhy did you join the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect?\u201dPeople looked at each other when they heard this question.\u201cDon\u2019t dare to answer?\u201dSu Shi said: \u201cThen I will say it for you.\u201d\u201cSome of you are interested in the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect\u2019s power, some are interested in its status in Demonic path, and some are interested in the resources for cultivation\u2026\u201d\u201cBut have you considered the consequences?\u201d\u201cConsequences?\u201dThe disciples were a little confused.What consequences could there be for joining this sect?\u201cJoining the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect means that you will become an absolute villain! You are an enemy of the Empire and the Righteous people, and the world will want your death!\u201d\u201cBy joining the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, you will become a pawn in Her Majesty\u2019s desire for the Central Plains, or even become a foothold under the cornerstone of our sect\u2019s hegemony!\u201d\u201cBy joining the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, your life no longer belongs to you, but to the Netherworld Demon Empress!\u201d\u201cYou can die for Her Majesty at any time!\u201d\u201cIt could be tomorrow, or it could be now!\u201dSu Shi\u2019s eyes swept through the crowd, \u201cYou guys, are you really ready?\u201dThe voice was not loud, but it was deafening!The disciples\u2019 faces turned slightly white.Even Cen Yiren froze.She had thought that the other party would say something to boost their morale, but she did not expect that it would be such a terrifying reality!The scene was silent.\u201cHegemony is a bloody path.\u201d\u201cYou may become the corpses that pave the way, but it is also possible to claim the Central Plains and witness the ultimate glory!\u201d\u201cIf you want to quit the sect, it\u2019s not too late.\u201dSu Shi said, \u201cI will make a request to Her Majesty Demon Empress, and this is your last chance to choose.\u201dA moment later a faint voice rang out from the crowd:\u201cFor Her Majesty!\u201dLike a stone thrown into a lake, it instantly stirred up a thousand waves:\u201cFor Her Majesty! For our Empress! For Her Majesty!\u201dThe disciples went into a frenzy, waving their hands and shouting as loud as they could!Su Shi stood with his hands in the air and said indifferently: \u201cWelcome to the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect.\u201dCen Yiren looked at him blankl y, with incredible splendor in her eyes.This man, truly handsome!Above the clouds.Yun Qiluo looked at Su Shi, her eyes seemed to have bright waves of light, proudly saying: \u201cSee? This is the heir chosen by me!\u201dOn the other side stood a woman in rough clothes.Carrying a jug of wine in her hand, she tilted her head and took a sip.\u201cYour Majesty does have a good eye.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 \u2013 Demon Empress even confesses?The woman was unkempt, unadorned, dressed in rough and shabby clothes, carrying a jug of wine in her hand, and occasionally tilting her head to take a sip.The wine flowed down her neck, soaking her collar, but she didn\u2019t care.She had a sassy and impolite air about her.Yun Qiluo frowned and said, \u201cI called you here to see Su Shi, could you please stop drinking for a while?\u201dThe drunken woman blurted out, \u201cI use my mouth to drink, and my eyes to look at that person, the two aren\u2019t contradictory.\u201dYun Qiluo shook her head, \u201cBut you can barely open your eyes!\u201dThe woman said with a smile: \u201cEven with my eyes closed, I can still feel that this Su Shi is indeed extraordinary.\u201dWhat she meant by extraordinary was not his talent.It was his thinking.The words just now seemed to give those people a choice, but in reality he changed their mindset.If you wanted to be the backbone of a sect, strength alone was not enough, the most important thing was loyalty.Su Shi had given them a sense of mission, and this was the beginning of cultivating loyal people.Those at the top would attack the heart, those in the middle would attack strategy, and those at the bottom would attack courage.This man has an extraordinary talent!Yun Qiluo had a proud expression on her face, \u201cOf course, after all he is the man I chose!\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dThe woman looked puzzled.Yun Qiluo knew that she had slipped up and cleared her throat, \u201cAhem, I mean a man suitable to be the main heir.\u201dThe woman was unimpressed and said, \u201cBut Your Majesty seems to have been single for a long time, right? It\u2019s time to find a man too\u2013\u201d\u201cYu Jiao Long!\u201dYun Qiluo looked at her coldly.The woman instantly came to her senses and bowed with a terrified expression, \u201cThis subordinate has made a mistake, I hope Your Majesty forgives me!\u201dIt\u2019s all the wine\u2019s fault!I almost forgot that this person in front of me is a Demon Empress!Although she is an Eastern Saint, she is nothing in front of Demon Empress!Yun Qiluo\u2019s face was ice-cold, \u201cGet lost.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe woman ran away.Seeing the woman\u2019s frantic back, Yun Qiluo\u2019s expression shattered and she coldly snorted, \u201cYou\u2019re a single yourself, how dare you laugh at me?\u201dThe corner of her mouth curled up in a smile as she thought of what Su Shi had just said about \u201cgiving his life for the Demon Empress\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want your life, I want you to live well \u2026\u2026\u201d###Cen Yiren looked at Su Shi in a dumbfounded manner.She didn\u2019t expect him to be so eloquent!The lecture just now made her blood boil!The disciples\u2019 emotions were even higher.Hegemony!They suddenly felt a mission on their shoulders!A beep sounded in Su Shi\u2019s ears:[Netherworld Rakshasa Sect\u2019s prestige has increased, affecting the next plot, gaining 5 plot points.][Yu Jiao Long\u2019s change of heart affects the next plot, gaining 10 plot points.]Su Shi frowned slightly.This name was both familiar and unfamiliar.She was the strongest of the Four Saints, but her existence was always mysterious and she was never seen.In all the years he had been a member of the sect, he had never seen this Saint even once.\u201cCould she be nearby?\u201dSu Shi looked around, but found nothing.\u201cBut it\u2019s good to have plot points, at least it\u2019s not a waste of time.\u201dAt this moment, a young girl raised her hand, \u201cCommander Su, I have a question.\u201dSu Shi nodded, \u201cSay it.\u201dThe girl shyly said: \u201cActually, when I joined the sect, what I saw was not status and resources, but you\u2026 Commander Su, may I pursue you?\u201dSushi: \u201c???\u201dThe scene was silent.The disciples covered their mouths, and even Cen Yiren froze.Public confession?This is too bold!In the clouds high above, Yun Qiluo was just about to leave when she heard these words and stopped in her tracks.Su Shi was silent for a moment and nodded, \u201cOf course you can.\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d\u201cCommander Su!\u201dA heartbreaking voice rang out from the female disciples.Yun Qiluo\u2019s delicate hands were tightly clenched, her face slightly pale.The young girl said excitedly, \u201cReally?\u201dSu Shi said, \u201cOf course, it is your right to pursue whoever you want, no one can stop you, but I can tell you clearly that I will not accept it.\u201dThe young girl was confused, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I have someone I like.\u201dFacing everyone\u2019s surprised eyes, Su Shi said with a smile: \u201cI know you are curious, but she has a special status and I cannot mention her name.\u201d\u201cIn my eyes she is the most gentle and beautiful girl in the world.\u201d\u201cMost importantly, she has changed my life completely.\u201dAnd with that, he turned and left.The arena was silent for a moment, then completely exploded.\u201cCommander Su really has a girlfriend?\u201d\u201cThat must be true, look at the way he looked just now, it\u2019s like there are stars in his eyes!\u201d\u201cThen who is so lucky?\u201d\u201cCommander Su was so gentle just now, my heart melted!\u201d\u201cUwooogh!! Commander Su!!!\u201dAbove the clouds.Yun Qiluo covered her beautiful and hot face, her eyes seemed to be able to release water.Su Shi said that the person she likes is so special that he can\u2019t even say her name.He also said that she is the most gentle and beautiful girl in the world, and this was just said to her!And the most important thing was, that woman had changed his life!\u201cSassy!\u201d\u201cHe, he dares to declare his love for me in public?\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s heart skipped a beat!Subconsciously touching the heart-shaped pendant on her collarbone, she bit her lip and muttered to herself, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\u201cCan I\u2026.?\u201d\u201cNo, I can\u2019t agree to it easily!\u201d###Su Shi said helplessly, \u201cSenior Sister Cen, what do you want?\u201dThis girl had followed him all the way.Cen Yiren hesitated for a moment and asked in a low voice, \u201cDo you really have someone you like?\u201dSu Shi nodded, \u201cYes.\u201dThe woman seemed a little distressed, \u201cThen does she like you?\u201dSu Shi affirmed, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSo you \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe will try our best to have a big fat boy in future, and then ask Senior Sister Cen to be his nanny.\u201d\u201c????\u201dThe sadness vanished instantly.Cen Yiren\u2019s chest rose and fell, gritting her teeth, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dSu Shi joked: \u201c But if Senior Sister Cen wants to be a concubine, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cBastard, I\u2019ll kick your ass!\u201dCen Yiren pounced with her teeth and claws.Su Shi wiped his feet and ran away in an instant.Cen Yiren stomped her foot angrily, \u201cYou\u2019re dreaming, I will never be your concubine!\u201dSu Shi ran far and stopped only when he was sure it was safe.\u201cThis tigress, can\u2019t even take a joke \u2026\u2026\u201dAt this moment, a servant came quickly:\u201cCommander Su, Your Majesty wants you to come.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dSu Shi gulped.My words just now, couldn\u2019t have been heard by Your Majesty right?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 \u2013 You\u2019re not allowed to call me Master!Rakshasa Palace.Su Shi cautiously said, \u201cYour Majesty, you summoned me?\u201dSeeing his cautious appearance, Yun Qiluo subtly hummed, \u201cWhy, weren\u2019t you brave enough just now in front of the disciples?\u201dSu Shi\u2019s heart jumped.Oh no, the Demon Empress had heard about it!If his relationship with Zhan Qingchen is discovered \u2026\u2026He couldn\u2019t help but grimace.Fortunately, Yun Qiluo didn\u2019t ask any further questions, \u201cI called you here because I wanted to ask, what do you think about becoming the Chief Disciple?\u201dSu Shi heaved a sigh of relief, \u201cSince Your Majesty trusts me, then I will take on this important task~\u201dSeeing him so happy, Yun Qiluo was a little puzzled, \u201cYou won\u2019t consider it once again?\u201dSu Shi shook his head, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to think about anymore.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to become a Chief Disciple before, mainly because he wanted to make a lot of money and didn\u2019t want to attract too much attention.okBut now that his talent was well-known, he had become a thorn in the side of the Righteous path and the Imperial Dynasty.It made no difference whether he was a Chief Disciple or not.Yun Qiluo\u2019s pretty face flushed slightly.He looks happy right now, I guess it\u2019s because he has expressed his feelings to me.You finally know your place!She was in a very good mood and said with a smile, \u201cThen, let\u2019s hold the ceremony as soon as possible, I\u2019m sure the elders can\u2019t wait.\u201dThe elders were overjoyed at the sudden appearance of a genius with Holy-grade perfect talent, but they feared that they would not be able to keep him, and they had urged her for him to become the Chief Disciple every day.Su Shi nodded and said, \u201cI leave it to Your Majesty to arrange it.\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s arrange it for tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cFor now, first accompany me to eat.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe corners of Yun Qiluo\u2019s mouth curled up slightly.Since Su Shi is the Chief Disciple, the two of them will meet frequently in the future.They can eat together, shop together, and sleep together\u2026.Bah bah bah, the last time was a complete accident!She thought about it, smiling and embarrassed for a while, and Su Shi was shocked for a while.At this moment, he thought of something and asked: \u201cYour Majesty, if I become the Chief Disciple, do I need to change the way I call you as Master?\u201dThe Chief Disciple was the main disciple, and was also the next successor to the sect leader. Moreover, Yun Qiluo also taught him the Netherworld Cultivation Method. There was actually no problem calling her Master or Your Majesty.But Yun Qiluo\u2019s face changed and she gritted her teeth and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to call me Master! I don\u2019t want to be your Master!\u201dSu Shi said in confusion, \u201cWhy?\u201dYun Qiluo turned his head and said quietly, \u201cYou obviously know the reason! Or are you deliberately provoking me?\u201dIf the two became Master and Disciple, how could she accept his love confession?This bad man must have done it on purpose!The two of them are in a relationship with each other\u2026\u2026.Su Shi was a little dazed, scratched his head and said, \u201cIf I call you Master\u2026 Isn\u2019t this very exciting?\u201d\u201cShut up !\u201dIn the dining room.Su Shi skillfully helped Yun Qiluo to eat the food, Yun Qiluo lowered his head and ate in small bites.The two cooperated very well.The waiters on the side were not surprised anymore.Since the last time they ate together, Her Majesty only ate the dishes that Su Shi served, and if Su Shi was not in the sect, Her Majesty was not even in the mood to eat.Could it be that the dishes served by Commander Su tasted better?The servant girl was puzzled.\u201cBy the way\u2026\u201dYun Qiluo asked in a loud voice: \u201cThe Li family\u2019s father and son in Qianyang City, did you kill them?\u201dAlthough this matter was suppressed by Cao Jie, it still reached his ears.Su Shi didn\u2019t hide it and said, \u201cI killed them, the Li family, father and son, they were torturing and killing outsiders.\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s no harm in killing them.\u201dYun Qiluo didn\u2019t mind it, but warned, \u201cBut you\u2019d better not get too close to outsiders.\u201d\u201cThe situation on the border is very tense these days, the relationship between the two races is deteriorating rapidly, and the Empire is already dealing with outsiders on the border.\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t send the little fox back, I\u2019m afraid it will be difficult for her to leave the Linlang Empire.\u201dSu Shi frowned, \u201cWhat happened?\u201dYun Qiluo shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly, but according to the information I got, the Spiritual Beasts in the Barbarian Realm seem to have gone crazy and has invaded the borders of the Linlang Empire.\u201d\u201cThe Imperial Palace thinks that it was driven by outsiders.\u201d\u201cSpiritual Beasts gone mad?\u201dSu Shi\u2019s heart jumped.Could it be that the unrest in the Barbarian Realm was about to begin?But it was too early this time.Yun Qiluo said, \u201cRight now either the Righteous Sects or the Demonic Sects have gone to the border to fight the Spiritual Beast, and I plan on sending some people there as well.\u201dAt times like this, even if there are differences between Righteous path and Demonic path people, prejudices must be put aside.The interests of mankind must come first.Su Shi thought about it, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me go?\u201dHe was not convinced, and wanted to go and see for himself.\u201cYou want to go?\u201dYun Qiluo frowned slightly and shook her head, \u201cNo, it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201dSu Shi said with some amusement, \u201cYour Majesty asked me to be the Chief Disciple, is it just to accompany you to dinner?\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s pretty face turned red.She didn\u2019t want to let Su Shi leave so quickly.After all, they had just returned and they had only exchanged a few words.But Su Shi had a point, she couldn\u2019t hold him back forever.\u201cI will think about it.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe two of them fell silent, each thinking of something.After a while, Yun Qiluo said, \u201cI want to eat that fish.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dSu Shi was distracted and picked up a piece of fish and subconsciously handed it to his mouth.The servant girl\u2019s eyes rounded.However, the next scene almost made her jaw drop to the ground.She saw Yun Qiluo\u2019s cheeks blush, her cherry lips parted lightly, shyly biting the chopsticks.The servant hurriedly lowered her head, cold sweat sliding down her forehead.What did I just see?Illusion, it must be an illusion!I, I won\u2019t be silenced by the Supreme Lord God, will I!?Today the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect was very lively.The disciples walked around the sect, talking to each other in twos and threes, all with excited faces.Today was a big day!The long vacant position of Chief Disciple of Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, finally found a candidate!And this was also the unanimous approval of everyone!This also meant that the younger generation of the Demonic path would finally rise!The Great Hall of the Nine Mysteries.The hall was filled to capacity.Yun Qiluo sat on the phoenix seat, the four Saints sat in the second place, the inner sect elders sat in turn, and the inner sect disciples sat below.Even the square outside the hall was filled with outer disciples.There was a lot of noise and bustle.DONG~The gong rang and the fog cleared.The crowd calmed down.The crowd parted into a path and turned their heads to look back.They saw a man in white slowly approaching.His face was calm, handsome and beautiful, and his deep eyes looked like stars.\u201cCommander Su is here!\u201d\u201cKyaaa, it\u2019s Commander Shu!!!\u201dThe disciples looked very enthusiastic.Especially the female disciples, they were already fainting with excitement.Their idol, Commander Su, would be witnessed by everyone soaring into the sky today!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 \u2013 Demon Star ascends to the throne, and the world is astonished!Chief Disciple.It was a position that was truly above all others!In the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, his status was only lower than Demon Empress. Even the Elders and Saints had to call him Shu Shengzi when they met!(\u82cf\u5723\u5b50= Shengzi means Son of God)Su Shi slowly walked into the main hall.Everyone\u2019s eyes were on him.The eyes of the elders and disciples were excited and frenzied.A genius with Holy-grade perfect talent!If such a genius became the Shengzi of Demonic path, he would shine in the future, and Demonic path would not worry about hegemony.The eyes of the four saints are also full of interest.Cen Baihu crossed his arms and sighed: \u201cI have to say, Her Majesty\u2019s eyesight is indeed good.\u201dWhen Su Shi first entered the sect, it was clear that only High-grade ordinary.But despite all the opposition, Demon Empress had to personally guide him in his cultivation.This caused quite a stir at the time.But now that it was proven, there was nothing wrong with Demon Empress\u2019 vision!Feng Zhongque nodded and said: \u201cSu Shi is indeed good, his talent and heart are excellent.\u201dThe short and hunchbacked old man beside him said enviously, \u201cHe is very handsome and has a good body. If only I had that kind of looks, I would have thousands of girls mesmerized.\u201dCen Baihu frowned and said: \u201cWu Xuanyi, can you not act disgusting?\u201d\u201cYou can spit if you feel disgusted.\u201d\u201cFuck\u2026\u201dThe two conversed with each other.Yu Jiao Long didn\u2019t say a word, holding the jug of wine and gulping it down.Su Shi walked to the center of the hall, bowed and said, \u201cThis Disciple Shu Shi, pay respect to Holy Master.\u201dYun Qiluo nodded her head, \u201cGo ring the bell.\u201dShe disliked boring and complicated rituals, and no one would question Su Shi\u2019s talent.But that didn\u2019t mean this ceremony could be omitted.Nine Profound Bell..The ancient bronze bell hanging above the main hall.The bell had mysterious origins and had existed since the beginning of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect.The louder the chimes sounded, the more convinced the person was of their power.\u201cYes.\u201dSu Shi flew over and arrived in front of the bronze bell.The bell was ancient in shape and rugged in appearance, seemingly having endured rain, snow and wind for ten thousand years.The bell was engraved with complicated ancient mysterious seals.Su Shi felt that it looked somewhat familiar.He stretched out his hand and slowly touched the ancient bell.Surprisingly, there was a feeling of fusion with the ancient bell, as if he was connected to it through blood!The bronze bell shone with a faint divine light. Yun Qiluo frowned slightly, \u201cThis seems to be the same as that night \u2026\u2026\u201dTime passed by one minute.\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he rung the bell yet?\u201d\u201cThere is no way he can\u2019t get the approval of the ancient bell!\u201d\u201cImpossible, Commander Su is a Holy-grade perfect talent!\u201d\u201cBut that Nine Profound Bell see more than just talent.\u201dThe disciples whispered about it, and even the elders couldn\u2019t sit still.Yu Jiao Long seemed to notice, and a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes.\u201cInteresting.\u201dSu Shi\u2019s eyes closed, and the divine light was clearly visible under his slightly trembling eyelids!Heaven and Earth blended together, forming the Nine Elements Harmony Revolution.This bronze bell actually came from the same source as \u201cThe Great Harmony of the Nine Revolution Elements of Heaven and Earth\u201d!Countless information flooded into his consciousness, as if they were commentaries on cultivation methods, continuously deepening his understanding of The Great Harmony.The first revolution was becoming more and more perfect and closer to completion!\u201cI haven\u2019t used the Mystical Ability of the first revolution, have I?\u201dSu Shi opened his eyes with a sudden jolt, and a dazzling light burst out!The power of creation, the inversion of yin and yang!Heaven and earth instantly fell into darkness.Only he and the ancient bell shone with brilliant light.The hall was filled with endless visions, the ceiling was tumbling, the earth was filled with golden lotuses, and fire and green-blue covered the dome like auspicious clouds.The sound of Dao was deafening, and the image of Dao was like boiling water!Boom!The ancient bell erupted with a tremendous heart-shaking sound, and the mist above Youzhou Rift Valley was scattered!A thunderous rumbling sound spread across the sky.The sound of bells resounded throughout the entire Nine Regions!At this moment, the whole world knew!The crowd in the hall was stunned.Even the Four Saints were shocked.Although it was said that the louder the bell, the more meaningful the person who ascended the throne had been affirmed, but the fact was that this Nine Profound Bell was made of special materials, no matter how high the realm or how powerful the person was, it was already a great achievement if they could just ring it!But this Su Shi \u2026\u2026Cen Baihu swallowed, \u201cThis is too loud!\u201d\u201cThe aura on his body seems to have the same origin as the Nine Profound Bell.\u201dYu Jiao Long hooked a smile, \u201cIt seems that Her Majesty has indeed found a treasure.\u201dLooking at the smile that was like melting ice and clean snow, Wu Xuanyi licked her face and said, \u201cLong\u2019er, you look so beautiful when you smile, like a spring flower\u2013\u201dBang!He was slammed straight to the ground.Cen Baihu also followed up with a kick.The bell stopped ringing, the darkness disappeared, and the hall was bright again.The crowd looked at Su Shi wildly.It was so shocking!What kind of being could accomplish such a feat?However, Su Shi\u2019s body trembled and fell like a kite with a broken string.A silhouette flashed by, and Yun Qiluo caught him in his arms.\u201cFool, you\u2019ve used up all your spiritual power.\u201d\u201cYou can tap it lightly, why are you working so hard?\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s eyes were angry as she picked up Su Shi and flew away\u2026The voice echoed in the hall:\u201cNine Profound Bell rings, the ceremony is over, from now on, Su Shi will be the Chief Disciple of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect!\u201dThe hall was silent for a moment, then boiled!###Weiyang Capital.Chen Wangchuan watched as the clouds in the sky were dispelled by the sound of thunder, and his eyelids twitched slightly.\u201cThe Nine Profound Bell rang.\u201d\u201cIt should be Su Shi\u2019s ascension as the Shengzi of Demonic path.\u201d\u201cBut this sound is too loud !\u201dThinking of the young man who saved his life, Chen Wangchuan sighed softly, \u201cUnfortunately, he cannot be used to my Empire.\u201dNext to him, Chen Qingluan smiled brightly.\u201cSu Shi is amazing!\u201d###Zhaotian Palace.The hall was eerily quiet.The Demon Star had ascended the throne, overturning the Heavenly Platform!The civil and military officials looked solemn.Feng Chaoge looked out the window and said indifferently, \u201cThe last time the Nine Profound Bell rang, it was Yun Qiluo who rang it, right?\u201dThe ministers all grimaced in unison.The last time the bell rang, the Demon Empress came out and opened a bloody chapter to seize imperial power!Then this time \u2026\u2026\u201cYour Majesty, this Su Shi cannot be allowed to live!\u201d\u201cHoly-grade perfect talent, and having a high compatibility with the Nine Profound Bell, how terrifying is the future \u2026\u2026 I dare not think about it!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better to take action as soon as possible!\u201d\u201cWe must make sure to kill him!\u201dThe ministers spoke up.Feng Chaoge nodded and said, \u201cAlright, then I leave the matter of killing Su Shi to the ministers who suggested this.\u201d\u201cYou guys can take treasures and heavenly weapons at will, and whether you succeed or not, I will give you a high reward.\u201d\u201cThis is \u2026\u2026.\u201dPeople looked at each other, and all bowed their heads.Killing Su Shi?What a joke!They can only come up with opinions, even the commander of the Imperial Guards Han Chen can\u2019t do it, how can they have the ability to kill Su Shi?These first-class officials\u2026.There is no way they are willing to sacrifice their own lives.Feng Chaoge\u2019s phoenix eyes were cold.A bunch of scum who only wanted to protect themselves!\u201cSince no one wants to leave, then I don\u2019t want to hear such remarks anymore.\u201d\u201cThe current situation, the border is the priority, Su Shi\u2019s matter, don\u2019t mention it again!\u201d###The land of Great Clouds.Sikong Lanyue listened to the sound of rolling thunder, the surrounding clouds rolling around endlessly.\u201cSu Shi is nothing more than a Golden Elixir cultivator, but he has such amazing strength?\u201d\u201cYun Qiluo has truly found a treasure!\u201d\u201cIf only I have such disciple\u2026.no, how could I possibly take a man as my disciple?\u201d\u201cImpossible, absolutely impossible!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 \u2013 The outrageous blind box, this time it\u2019s really done!Su Shi slowly woke up.He saw that he was lying on a luxurious bed, with phoenix-embroidered silk curtains in front of him. The air was filled with a refreshing fragrance.\u201cWhere is this?\u201dHe tried to sit up, but pain engulfed his body.He had to lie back down weakly.Sensing the empty Dantian and meridians, Su Shi couldn\u2019t help but shake his head and smile bitterly.\u201cThere is not a single drop left.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just ringing a bell, but I\u2019ve really used up all the spiritual energy?\u201dThe mysterious ancient seal on the Nine Profound Bell actually came from the same source as The Great Harmony of the Nine Revolution Elements of Heaven and Earth.Guided by an inexplicable force, he unknowingly used its first Mystical Ability:Reversing Yin and Yang.Using the power of creation to afflict himself, he poured out the power of heaven and earth, exploding with a force far beyond his own realm!The price was that the spiritual power in his body was emptied \u2026\u2026\u201cIt can be concluded that my realm is too low. With the cultivation base of the Golden Elixir Realm, the strength to use such a Mystical Ability is still not enough.\u201d\u201cBut that ancient bell is quite beneficial to me.\u201dIn the beginning, Su Shi consumed 300 plot points to comprehend The Great Harmony of the Nine Revolution Elements of Heaven and Earth.But with his current realm, he was only able to understand the first revolution.The Nine Profound Bell had improved his understanding of The Great Harmony.Now that he had mastered the first revolution, he had just touched the threshold of the second revolution.Su Shi frowned slightly, \u201cThis technique was obtained from the ancient emperor\u2019s inheritance, while the Nine Profound Bell is an incredible treasure since the beginning of the sect.\u201d\u201cIs there a connection between the two?\u201dThe two are related?[The host has been crowned as the Shengzi of Demonic path, the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect\u2019s reputation has increased significantly, gaining 50 plot points][Sikong Lanyue has experienced a slight tranformation in her heart, affecting the subsequent plot, gaining 4 plot points.]Su Shi was stunned for a moment.He could understand that the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect\u2019s reputation had increased.But what did it have to do with Sikong Lanyue?\u201cCould it be that the commotion made was so great that it caused her to want to kill me?\u201dSu Shi silently pondered.This Daoist Priestess was not someone to be messed with.Although her killing intent was not as strong as the Demon Empress, her realm cultivation was not weak at all.There was also the Linlang Empress who held the kingdom in her hands and sat at the edge of the cold sky.If he chose to stand by Yun Qiluo\u2019s side, then they would all become his enemies.\u201cNo matter what, I must increase my strength as soon as possible.\u201dOpen the system panel:[Host: Son of Destiny Killer \u2013 Su Shi][Status: Spiritual energy depleted, spirit depleted][Talent: Sacred Perfection][Cultivation Base: Golden Elixir Realm (Late Stage)][Cultivation Method: The Great Harmony of the Nine Revolution Elements of Heaven and Earth (First Revolution), Heavenly Sutra (Perfect), The Breathing Technique of Netherworld (Great Success), Netherworld Divine Cultivation (Small Success)][Plot Points: 110 points]\u201cAlthough the state is very poor, the plot points are quite a lot.\u201dSu Shi rubbed his hands together and decided to open the blind box first to know how he felt.The gift pool rotated, and divine light flowed.\u201cCome to papa!\u201dHe shouted a three-word incantation\u2026The light bloomed and the box opened.[Obtained: Phoenix Motif Royal Robe with Peony Flower]\u201c????\u201dSu Shi took a piece of red cloth in his hand, a question mark written on his face.It was as smooth as silk, with a delicate texture, perforated everywhere, and with a faint scent.\u201cIsn\u2019t this a fucking apron?\u201d\u201cI get this for 10 plot points?\u201dIt\u2019s a scam!Sure enough, there is no such thing as Immortal Treasure, there is only an immortal trap!His face is now black like an African.[Royal Robe: This robe is embroidered with a phoenix design with peony motifs and is endowed with mystical powers. By wearing it, you will always be rich and prosperous, and you will always have kindness, light and happiness.]Su Shi\u2019s eyebrows shot up wildly.What nonsense!That\u2019s obviously a scam!Even if it really worked, there\u2019s no way he would have put it on, right?It was too embarrassing!\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201dAt that moment, footsteps came from afar, and a familiar voice sounded.Demon Empress?Su Shi suddenly fumbled.If this thing was seen by Demon Empress, he would die!But his spiritual power was so dry that he couldn\u2019t even open his storage ring, so in panic he could only stuff it under the blanket.Yun Qiluo lifted the curtain, carrying a bowl of soup and medicine in her hand.Looking at Su Shi, who was sweating profusely, she said with concern, \u201cWhy are you so pale? Are you sick?\u201dSu Shi wiped his cold sweat and said with a sarcastic smile, \u201cNothing, I\u2019m just a little weak\u2026 \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s natural.\u201dYun Qiluo said, \u201cYou forcibly activated Mystical Ability, and the spiritual power in your body was exhausted. Fortunately, the foundation is not damaged.\u201dShe said, her tone slightly complaining, \u201cI just let you do a few moves, who told you to be so serious?\u201dSu Shi shook his head and said, \u201cYour Majesty trusts me, so I naturally can\u2019t embarrass you.\u201dYun Qiluo smiled, \u201cHmm, you are indeed good at sweet talk.\u201dSu Shi really did not embarrass her.Instead, he gave a great boost to the entire sect.The sound of the Nine Profound Bell resounded throughout the Nine Regions, and the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect\u2019s strength rose to an unprecedented level.Seeing that beautiful smile, Su Shi\u2019s throat moved, \u201cYour Majesty\u2019s smile is much sweeter.\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s beautiful face instantly turned red.She looked a little flustered, and snorted coldly: \u201cYou bastard, your words are getting more and more presumptuous. \u201c\u201cThen, I won\u2019t say anything in the future.\u201d\u201cI, I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201dSeeing the way he held back his bad smile, Yun Qiluo glared at him angrily.This annoying brat!\u201cThis is made of the Nine Revolutions Golden Pill, coupled with the Thousand Yang Blood Essence, drink it and you will recover soon.\u201dHe picked up the soup bowl, scooped out a spoonful of soup and thrust it into his mouth.Su Shi scratched his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t dare to trouble you, I\u2019d rather do it myself.\u201dYun Qiluo glared at him, \u201cAre you not happy with me?\u201d\u201cNo, of course I\u2019m happy.\u201d\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201dSu Shi obediently drank the soup and medicine.He remembered the last time he was fed medicine like this by Zhan Qingchen \u2026\u2026\u201cOpen your mouth, ah\u223c\u201dThe effect of the medicine boiled by Demon Empress herself was truly extraordinary.The effect was amazing, within moments, his dantian was filled with spiritual energy, and his meridians were flooded with spiritual energy.He felt refreshed and rejuvenated, wiping away his previous lethargy.Su Shi arched his hand. \u201cThank you, Your Majesty.\u201dYun Qiluo shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\u201cBy the way, your new residence has already been prepared by me.\u201dSince he was already the Chief Disciple he could no longer jostle with the inner disciples.However, Su Shi frowned slightly, looking hesitant.Yun Qiluo coldly snorted, \u201cI know you don\u2019t have to worry about Bai Qing, even if she doesn\u2019t join the sect, you can still bring him into the sect, and the position of Fengsha City Commander will also still be held by you.\u201dSu Shi heaved a sigh of relief and said gratefully, \u201cYour Majesty, you are very kind to me.\u201dThe corner of Yun Qiluo\u2019s mouth curved slightly, \u201cGood to know.\u201dAt that moment, her eyes flickered and she saw a red corner under the quilt.\u201cHmm? What is this?\u201dSu Shi\u2019s pupils jerked, \u201cWait!\u201dBut it was too late, Yun Qiluo had already taken out a piece of cloth.Looking at the red apron in her hand, her cherry lips opened slightly, her pupils trembled, and her beautiful face was enveloped in red.Even redder than the color of the apron!\u201cSu, Shi!\u201dSu Shi bowed his head, unable to cry.This time it was really over!1.

    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 \u2013 How dare you make me wear garment like that!Looking at the red apron in her hand, Yun Qiluo\u2019s chest rose and fell as she breathed heavily.This is definitely not his garment!Why would Su Shi, a grown man, carry women\u2019s underwear?\u201cDisgusting, pervert!\u201dSu Shi said in embarrassment, \u201cYour Majesty, this is really a misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cMisunderstanding?\u201dYun Qiluo asked: \u201cSo you mean, this is yours?\u201dSu Shi lowered his head, \u201cThis is indeed mine\u2026\u201dYun Qiluo clenched her white teeth and said, \u201cI just thought you liked outsiders, but I didn\u2019t expect you to have such a fetish! You, you are a mature man, how can you wear such embarrassing clothes?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSu Shi was silent for a moment and hurriedly explained, \u201cAlthough this garment is mine, it\u2019s not for me to wear, besides, I can\u2019t wear it in this size!\u201dYun Qiluo frowned slightly.Not for him wear himself?Could it be \u2026..The thought flashed through her mind and she trembled, her eyes full of disbelief.Does he want me to wear it!This, this, this is too ridiculous!Yun Qiluo was so embarrassed and angry that she said incoherently, \u201cYou bastard, you dare to have such a dirty idea, I, I will never agree!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSu Shi scratched his head and said: \u201cYour Majesty, this is a misunderstand-\u201cBefore he could finish his words, his body lifted into the air.After that beautiful throw, he was immediately kicked out of the bedroom.Yu Jiao Long had just walked to the door.Bang!Su Shi fell head-first in front of her.Yu Jiao Long stopped in her tracks and said in confusion, \u201cShengzi Su, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cCough cough.\u201dSu Shi stood up and patted the dust, \u201cNothing, I was just taking a walk.\u201dThen he limped away.Looking at his back, Yu Jiao Long looked a little puzzled.\u201cSassy, really sassy!\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s cheeks rolled, \u201cHow dare you try to make me wear such garment~?\u201dLooking at the thin phoenix peony embroidered garment, imagining the image, she bit her cherry lips, her phoenix eyes shy, \u201c Even if I wear it, there is no way I will show it to you!\u201dAt this moment, the servant\u2019s voice sounded from outside the door:\u201cYour Majesty, the Eastern Saint requests an audience.\u201dYun Qiluo hurriedly put on the cloth and cleared her throat, \u201cLet her in.\u201dMoments later, Yu Jiao Long walked in and bowed, \u201cI pay my respects Your Majesty.\u201dYun Qiluo nodded her head, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2026..\u201dYu Jiao Long raised her head and was about to speak, but her expression froze slightly.Yun Qiluo frowned, \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201dYu Jiao Long frowned slightly. She vaguely saw that there was a red star moving above the Demon Empress\u2019 head?That must be an illusion!\u201cReport to Your Majesty, the situation in the north is getting serious. All the sects have sent their disciples. Will our sect send people to help?\u201dYun Qiluo pondered a bit.The border issue was everyone\u2019s problem.Even Righteous people and Demonic people must put aside their prejudices for a while.It is definitely necessary to send someone, but the question is who to send?Yu Jiao Long suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we send Shengzi Su, he has just ascended the throne, so he can take this opportunity to make a name for himself.\u201d\u201cSu Shi? \u2026\u2026\u201dRecalling that Su Shi had said before that he wanted to go to the border, Yun Qiluo nodded and said, \u201cAlright, let him go, bring a few more experts, and you will protect him in secret.\u201dYu Jiao Long frowned and said, \u201cI will protect him?\u201dYun Qiluo said in a deep voice: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true, it\u2019s just that my identity is sensitive, if my existence is exposed, I\u2019m afraid it will cause dissatisfaction from the Righteous people and the Imperial Dynasty.\u201dYu Jiao Long was the strongest among the Four Saints.At the same time, she was also the object of intense scrutiny by the Righteous path and the Imperial Palace.If she appeared on the border, it would definitely cause thousands of waves, and all forces would suspect the motives and goals of the Demonic path.Yun Qiluo said indifferently: \u201cWhoever gets in the way, you will kill them, do you need me to teach you this?\u201d\u201cRemember, if something happens to Su Shi, you don\u2019t need to go back.\u201dHearing that indifferent tone, Yu Jiao Long\u2019s body trembled and he lowered his head and said, \u201cYes.\u201dThen she bowed and retreated.Yun Qiluo sighed.That indifferent expression was shattered, leaning on her chin with crumpled eyes.\u201cI thought if I made him Chief Disciple, he would be able to stay in the sect to accompany me more.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect him to go out again so soon \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWait, he really wants to go to the border, not for the sake of meeting that little fox, right?!\u201dYun Qiluo\u2019s face changed as she suddenly began to suffer from a sense of uncertainty.Inner Palace.Seeing the white clothes in front of them, the disciples looked excited and frenzied.Commander Su, no, Shengzi Su!Nine Profound Bell rang and the world was shocked.This was Su Shi\u2019s first mission out of the sect since he became Chief Disciple.It was a great honor for them to be chosen to go with him.Su Shi swept his gaze around and couldn\u2019t help but be a little surprised.They were all Golden Elixir cultivators!Looking at their ages and temperaments, it was clear that they were not youngsters just starting out, and that they should be very experienced in battle.To the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, this was just the tip of the iceberg of strength.This was when Su Shi discovered a sly figure in the crowd.\u201cSenior Sister Cen?\u201dThe crowd turned to look.They saw a gray-robed disciple hiding at the back, with his head down, covering his ears.Su Shi frowned and said, \u201cStop pretending, I\u2019ve seen it all.\u201dCen Yiren raised her head, with a mustache painted on her face, and said helplessly, \u201cI\u2019ve changed into men\u2019s clothes, how did you find me?\u201dSu Shi shook his head and said, \u201cThe clothes you\u2019re wearing are almost poking out, do you think I\u2019m blind?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dCen Yiren\u2019s cheeks flushed slightly as she covered her chest and glared at him.Su Shi frowned and said, \u201cI can\u2019t take you without West Saint\u2019s permission.\u201dThis time was different from the trip to Tianqu Mountain.If something went wrong, he could not afford it.Cen Yiren coldly snorted and emitted her voice: \u201cI don\u2019t care, if you don\u2019t let me go, I will tell my father about you making me your concubine!\u201dSu Shi laughed bitterly: \u201dIt\u2019s just a joke!\u201dCen Yiren snorted: \u201cYou can explain to my father yourself, and see if he thinks this is a joke?\u201d\u201cAnd what if he agrees?\u201d\u201cYou, you crap, my father couldn\u2019t possibly agree!\u201dThe two were arguing when a servant came walking briskly into earshot.\u201cShengzi, Her Majesty asked me to give this letter to you.\u201d\u201cHer Majesty wrote a letter to me?\u201dSu Shi took out the letter and saw two large lines written on it:\u201cDon\u2019t go to that bitch, or you will die!\u201d\u201cCome back early, I have \u2026\u2026 a surprise for you.\u201dThe last few words were in a messy script, obviously Yun Qiluo was a little nervous when she wrote them.\u201cSurprise?\u201dSu Shi cupped his chin, \u201cWhat surprise can Demon Empress have for me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 \u2013 You don\u2019t really want to be my concubine, do you?The edge of the Youzhou Rift Valley.Two figures stood together, looking down through a layer of mist.Yu Jiao Long took a sip of wine and asked, \u201cDo you really not mind letting Yiren come along?\u201dCen Baihu shook his head: \u201cWith you as protector, what do I have to worry about?\u201dYu Jiao Long said lightly: \u201cMy mission is to protect Su Shi, I don\u2019t care if others live or die.\u201dCen Baihu smiled foolishly, \u201cIt\u2019s your niece anyway. You will definitely protect her.\u201dYu Jiao Long glared at him.This guy looked like a big man, but he was actually more cunning than anyone else.She rubbed her fingers together, \u201cTen pots of Hundred Year Fairy Drink.\u201d\u201cFive pots.\u201d\u201cEight pots.\u201d\u201cDeal!\u201dCen Baihu directly took out eight jugs of wine and pushed them towards Yu Jiao Long, as if he was afraid she would regret it.Yu Jiao Long was silent for a moment and said, \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve already made up your mind.\u201dCen Baihu rubbed his head and said awkwardly, \u201cSu Shi has great luck, I want Yiren to have more contact with him.\u201dThe last trip to Tianqu Mountain, Cen Baihu just wanted to let her out for practice, not really hoping to get anything.It turned out that not only had Cen Yiren made a realm breakthrough, but she had also obtained Stone Intent, and her personality had also changed a lot.Obviously, this was all because of Su Shi.Yu Jiao Long hesitated for a moment, but did not say anything.Su Shi was very talented and handsome, and was most likely favored by young girls.Although Cen Yiren had a rough personality, but which young girl would not be happy with him?If the two are in contact for a long time, I\u2019m afraid\u2026She glanced at Cen Baihu and thought to herself:If something really happens to the two of them, should I stop it or pretend not to know?\u201dForget it, I\u2019d better stay away, hide and not interfere.The flying boat shot up in the sky. It was powered by spirit stones and flew extremely fast and smooth.Although it was not as big as Demon Empress\u2019s, it was no less luxurious.Inside the room, the scent of tea was shrill.Su Shi sat quietly on a chair.Cen Yiren was beside him with a grumpy face, making tea for him.In the end, he still brought Cen Yiren with him. But the condition is, the other party must listen to his arrangements unconditionally \u2026\u2026\u201cShengzi, please have the tea .\u201dCen Yiren gritted her teeth and handed him the teacup. Su Shi took it and tasted it, nodded and said, \u201cNot bad, there is progress.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dCen Yiren looked depressed.This person was getting more and more glorious by the day.If it was before, she could still use her status as a Senior Sister to bring him down. But now that Su Shi had become the Shengzi of Netherworld, his status was much higher than her.In the past\u2026Thinking of her previous outrageous attitude towards him, Cen Yiren lowered her head silently. Su Shi not only did not mind it, but also paid great care to her on the journey to the Northern Region, which made her feel a little guilty in her heart.When Su Shi saw her staring, he reached out and waved his hand in front of her eyes.\u201cAre you angry?\u201dCen Yiren shook her head, \u201cNo.\u201dSeeing Su Shi\u2019s handsome face, she hesitated for a moment, got up and walked behind him.Su Shi wondered, \u201cWhat are you \u2026\u2026 doing?\u201dCen Yiren stretched out her slender hand and gently squeezed his shoulder for him, her face flushed, \u201cMaster, is this strength enough?\u201d\u201c???\u201dSu Shi gulped, \u201cAre you alright?\u201dThe other party was suddenly so gentle, making him uncomfortable!Cen Yiren said shyly, \u201cThis time, we didn\u2019t bring a maid, so I will take care of your food and clothes.\u201dSu Shi was silent for a moment and wondered, \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to be my concubine, do you?\u201dCrack!Cen Yiren\u2019s face was expressionless.Her hand shone with jade and almost crushed Su Shi\u2019s shoulder.\u201cI will never be a concubine in my life!\u201d####Northern border.Huangyuan City.This place bordered the Barbarian Realm, and hundreds of miles further was the endless wilderness.The atmosphere in this originally peaceful small town was now very heavy.The city walls are guarded by a post at five steps and a guard at ten steps, and the gates are also heavily guarded, and all passers-by are carefully checked.Outside the city, a large number of practitioners had gathered, all of whom were disciples from various sects of both the Righteous path and the Demonic path who rushed to help.Zhan Qingchen and Chen Qingluan were also among them.Looking at the patchy city wall, with crimson blood stains drying on it, Zhan Qingchen frowned: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that the spirit beasts had forced their way here!\u201dChen Qingluan said in a deep voice: \u201cIt seems that the situation is more severe than we imagined.\u201dThis Huangyuan City belonged to the territory of the Linlang Empire.This meant that the fierce Spirit Beasts had crossed the border!Zhan Qingchen pondered, \u201cCould it really be directed by outsiders?\u201dChen Qingluan said, \u201cOutsiders have denied it, saying that they also don\u2019t know why those Spirit Beasts are uncontrollable, but who can say whether that\u2019s true or not?\u201dThe relationship between the two races was already strained, and now they were almost at odds.\u201cYou\u2019re right. By the way\u2026\u201dZhan Qingchen remembered something and asked, \u201cAfter the Tianqu Mountain incident last time, did someone make trouble for you?\u201dAfter all, the two of them confronted the Imperial Guards in public and almost collided.Zhan Qingchen was the Chief Disciple, so she had nothing to worry about, but Chen Qingluan had an official position, so it was likely that she would have a hard time facing the Imperial Palace.Chen Qingluan shook her head, \u201cNothing.\u201dStrange to say the least.Not only did she not receive any punishment for what she did at Tianqu Mountain, but no one mentioned it anymore.It was as if everyone had lost their memories. By all rights, the Holy Emperor should not be so merciful \u2026\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dZhan Qingchen breathed a sigh of relief, \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t expect that at that time you would help Su Shi speak.\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s pretty face was slightly red, \u201cReciprocity is reciprocity afterall, although Su Shi is a member of the Demonic path, but he helped me more than once in the Secret Realm, I certainly can\u2019t see Han Chen taking action against him.\u201d\u201cYou \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have always hated men, yet you are willing to help Su Shi, you can\u2019t be \u2026\u2026\u201dChen Qingluan looked nervous.Does Qingchen know that Su Shi likes me?Chen Qingluan heaved a sigh of relief and nodded her head, \u201cI think he\u2019s a good guy!\u201dThey both had their own thoughts and their eyes drifted slightly.At that moment, a group of soldiers came out of the city, led by a middle-aged man in armor.His beard was messy and he looked tired.\u201cI am Wang Mao, chief warrior of the Northlands, and I am taking over the position of city lord for the time being, thanks to all of you who have come to help Huangyuan City.\u201d\u201cThe inn in the city has been arranged, but the rooms are very limited, so we can only ask you to squeeze into one room.\u201dThis town was too small.Even so, there is not enough space.\u201cYou are very kind, Chief Warrior Wang.\u201d\u201cWe are not here to enjoy ourselves.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay to make do with what you have.\u201dWang Mao smiled, \u201cThank you for understanding, then please come in-\u201cBefore the words were finished, a shadow covered their heads.People looked up, only to see a luxurious flying ship coming across.The Netherworld Rakshasa Sect had arrived!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 \u2013 Hugging the wrong person!The flying boat slowly descended.The luxurious and precious atmosphere contrasted with the ruined scenery around it.A group of people stepped out of the flying boat.The man in the lead was dressed in white, handsome and delicate, and was rubbing his shoulders with a painful expression.It was Su Shi!The atmosphere suddenly fell into tension.All cultivators and soldiers stared at this man.The man who rang the Nine Profound Bell, making it ring throughout the Nine Regions, informing the world of Demon Star\u2019s ascension to the throne!He actually came in person!The people of the Righteous path quietly took a few steps back.Although they had put aside their prejudices for a while, they were still a little nervous seeing this Shengzi of Demonic path.When Zhan Qingchen looked at him, her feet moved slightly and she almost couldn\u2019t help but lunge forward.He is also here!I\u2019m so happy!Chen Qingluan\u2019s eyes flashed, and there seemed to be a different color in her eyes.Wang Mao was the first to react.Seeing this man who made the Imperial Palace feel uneasy, his expression was a little complicated, \u201cSu Shengzi, you\u2019re here. \u201cSu Shi nodded and said: \u201cI heard that Spirit Beasts are running rampant, Her Majesty ordered me to come and see if there is anything I can help with.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026thanks to Demon Empress\u2026\u201dWang Mao\u2019s tone was not quite natural.As a palace official, he never thought that one day he would express his gratitude to the Demon Empress \u2026\u2026He felt a little strange.\u201cPlease enter the city first, but rooms are limited in the city, so I\u2019m afraid Shengzi Su will have to jostle with others.\u201dLooking at the desolate and dilapidated city, Su Shi shook his head and said, \u201cNo need.\u201dWang Mao frowned slightly.Is it because he dislikes harsh environments?You should know that the soldiers under him didn\u2019t sleep for days and nights!In order to make room for the cultivators, they even had to camp outside the city, and Su Shi and the others were not even willing to go in, they were too spoiled!\u201cSu Shengzi-\u201cBefore he finished speaking, Su Shi suddenly asked, \u201cLooking at your state, you must have gone through several days of fierce fighting, how many are injured now?\u201dWang Mao didn\u2019t know why the other party asked this question, but answered anyway: \u201cNearly forty people.\u201dSu Shi nodded, turned his head and ordered, \u201cLand this flying boat.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe Netherworld Rakshasa Sect disciples landed the flying boat, and it looked as if a luxurious palace was standing on the ground.Su Shi looked at Wang Mao, \u201cThis flying boat is not very big, but it can still accommodate dozens of people, so let the injured get on and rest.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dWang Mao froze for a moment, \u201cWhat about you guys?\u201d\u201cDisciples of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, listen to orders.\u201d\u201cYes Sir!\u201d\u201cYou all go to the city wall and rotate with the imperial guard posts.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe disciples of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect flew towards the city wall.Su Shi said, \u201cWe are here to fight the beasts, as for the room, better leave it to those who need it.\u201dWang Mao gave him a puzzled look.He didn\u2019t expect the other party to make such a decision.This Heaven Destroying Demon Star, it seems that he isn\u2019t as fierce as the rumors said?Thinking of the bad thoughts on him just now, Wang Mao couldn\u2019t help but be a little embarrassed, \u201cThank you, Shengzi Su, I didn\u2019t expect you to throw away your prejudice \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is a temporary abandonment.\u201dSu Shi said lightly: \u201cLeave Huangyuan City, you and I are still enemies. When our sect\u2019s iron hooves break through the rivers and mountains, you will not be treated well.\u201dWang Mao shook his head and smiled wryly.This person is very good at talking.Nevertheless.He liked it!\u201cChief Zhan, Imperial Censor Chen!\u201dCen Yiren jumped up and down towards the two.Although there was a dispute between the Righteous path and the Demonic path, they had experienced life and death on Tianqu Mountain, and the two had protected her in front of the Imperial Guards, so Cen Yiren felt close to them.Zhan Qingchen smiled and nodded, \u201cYiren, you are also here.\u201dChen Qingluan gripped her long sword with a disgusted face, \u201cNoisy big bear sister \u2026\u2026\u201dThe three of them were so enthusiastic, the cultivators from both the Righteous path and Demonic path were confused.The two Heavenly Pride of the Righteous path, always cynical towards evil, why were they so close to this demonic girl?Before they could react, they saw Su Shi walking towards them.\u201cShengzi Su is here!\u201d\u201cWhat does that demon want?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way this will be a battle right?!\u201d\u201cI heard that this demon is very ferocious \u2026\u2026\u201dThe people of the Righteous path looked tense all at once.But the next picture made them all freeze.Only to see Su Shi standing in front of the two, smiling, \u201cLong time no see.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Shengzi Su.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s face was slightly red and her smile was bright.Chen Qingluan lowered her head and laced her fingers together, \u201cYou, you came from the southern border, you must be very tired on the way, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not tired.\u201dSu Shi said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to the city?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe two girls nodded obediently, and they turned around and walked towards the city.\u201cWait for me!\u201dCeng Yiren followed quickly.People were silent as they watched their harmonious backs, questions written all over their faces.\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d####This Huangyuan City was not as dilapidated as expected, but had a distinct beauty.People, despite their fears and anxieties, continued to live, and the arrival of the \u201cImmortals\u201d added a sense of security to them.They walked through the streets.Cen Yiren ran around like a curious baby.Chen Qingluan held her long sword, her eyes downcast, wondering what Su Shi was thinking.Su Shi walked beside Zhan Qingchen and quietly grabbed her hand.Zhan Qingchen was startled and looked around nervously.This is in public, idiot, you\u2019re too bold!Qingluan is still around you know!Su Shi scratched his palm, \u201cQingchen, I miss you.\u201dZhan Qingchen blushed and said shyly: \u201cBad guy, I miss you too.\u201dSu Shi smiled and said: \u201cThe rooms on the flying boat are given to the wounded, and the inns in the city are already unavailable, so it looks like we can only share a room.\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s cheeks were hot and her heartbeat was racing, \u201cBut, but what about Qingluan?\u201dSu Shi thought about it, \u201cIt looks like the three of you can only share a room.\u201d (~_~)They came to the inn arranged by Wang Mao.Normally, two people should share a room, but the three of them were too shy to share a room with Su Shi.As a result, the three of them crammed into one room, and Su Shi slept in one room alone.Lying on the empty bed, Su Shi had a grumpy expression on his face.\u201cIf only I didn\u2019t have Ceng Yiren as a follower, everything would have been much easier\u2026.\u201dThere was nothing to do, he just sat on his knees and began to comprehend The Great Harmony.The information about the Nine Profound Bell was huge, enough for him to break through to the second revolution, and his intuition told him that there should be more than one existence similar to the Nine Profound Bells.The origin of The Great Harmony of the Nine Revolution Elements of Heaven and Earth is definitely not simple.While Su Shi was in his cultivation, he suddenly realized that the door to his room was quietly pushed open.A figure tiptoed in.His eyes were slightly closed and the corners of his mouth curled upwards.Qingchen, this girl is so shy that she can only come to me secretly when no one is around.The closer the person came, the more Su Shi pretended not to know.When the woman approached, he reached out and pulled her into his arms.\u201cOh my!\u201dA cry of surprise.Su Shi frowned slightly.The sound isn\u2019t right, and it doesn\u2019t feel right either?He opened his eyes in confusion, only to see Ceng Yiren\u2019s beautiful face flushed, her expression panicked, stammering: \u201cWhat are you doing? I haven\u2019t agreed yet!\u201dSu Shi: \u201c\u2026..\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 \u2013 The same incident happened 3 times in a row, the girls\u2019 fake friendship!Cen Yiren covered her collar and hid in a corner with a red face.She didn\u2019t look as strong as usual, she looked so sad and pitiful.I have been bullied again!When she thought about it, she didn\u2019t know how many times she had been abused by this man.He had seen and touched her, and there were almost no secrets left.How could I marry someone like this?I couldn\u2019t really be his concubine, could I?She bit her lip in shame and anger, \u201cWhy do you always harass me?\u201dSu Shi said helplessly, \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was you, I thought it was \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWho did you think it was?\u201dCen Yiren frowned slightly.He was just cultivating and didn\u2019t think much about it, so he thought it was Zhan Qingchen who came to look for him.But he didn\u2019t expect it to be \u2026\u2026Cough\u2026 the sensation in my hand is indeed different!He frowned: \u201cWho let you sneak into my room anyway?\u201dCen Yiren sulked, \u201cDidn\u2019t I say that I will take care of your food and needs from now on?\u201d\u201cI wanted to help clean your room, but you jumped on me without saying a word!\u201d\u201cI said I would take care of you, but that doesn\u2019t include warming your bed\u2026.\u201dSu Shi was a little embarrassed, \u201cAccident, it was an accident.\u201dCen Yiren\u2019s nose wrinkled slightly, \u201cFortunately, the person who came was me. If it was Censor Chen or Chief Zhan, I\u2019m afraid you wouldn\u2019t have escaped even if you jumped into the Yellow River!\u201dSu Shi secretly shook his head.It would be good if it was really Zhan Qingchen!Chen Qingluan\u2019s voice came from outside the door, \u201cShengzi Su, are you resting?\u201dCen Yiren froze for a moment.\u201cImperial Censor Chen? What is she doing here?\u201dChen Qingluan carefully pushed open the door to the room.She also froze when she saw the two people in the room.\u201cBig bear sister, are you here too?\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s pointed eyebrows sank slightly, her eyes puzzled, \u201cWhat are you doing in Shengzi Su\u2019s bed?\u201dCen Yiren pretended to be calm and said, \u201cI\u2019m here to help Shengzi make the bed\u2026 On the contrary, Imperial Censor Chen, what are you doing here?\u201dChen Qingluan turning her head, she said unnaturally, \u201cI want to discuss the matter of Spirit Beasts with Su Shengzi.\u201dAt that moment, the door to the room was pushed open again.A moon-white figure slipped in.\u201cSu Shi, I\u2019m coming \u2026\u2026 Huh, Qingluan?!\u201cQingchen?!\u201dZhan Qingchen froze in place, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you went to the city wall to help defend?\u201dChen Qingluan also stared blankly. She said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you were going to meditate?\u201dThe two stared at each other with wide eyes.The atmosphere suddenly became awkward.Even if Cen Yiren was stupid, she could see that something was wrong at this moment.She laughed coldly in a low voice, \u201cIt seems that Shengzi Su\u2019s room is very popular.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dSu Shi covered his forehead.This was too much of a coincidence!Inside the room.The four people looked at each other.Zhan Qingchen frowned, \u201cQingluan, how could you lie to me?\u201dShe said she was going to the city wall to help defend the city, but instead she secretly came to look for Su Shi!He is my man!Chen Qingluan\u2019s cheeks flushed, \u201cI did want to discuss something with Shengzi Su \u2026\u2026 but didn\u2019t you also lie to me?\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes flashed, and she hesitated: \u201cI was restless, so I wanted to go for a walk.\u201d\u201cYou went for a walk to Su Shi\u2019s room?\u201d\u201cCough, I happened to be passing by.\u201dThe two felt guilty, their gazes were erratic, and no one dared to look at each other directly.The friendly relationship between the two was being tested at the moment.They were both in the same boat.Cen Yiren squeezed her chin. Looking at their unnatural appearance, and thinking about what Su Shi said, an electric light suddenly flashed in her mind.The girl Su Shi likes can\u2019t be one of them, right?No wonder this guy didn\u2019t dare to mention the girl\u2019s name, so they were the top heavenly talents of the Righteous path?This, this is too ridiculous!Ceng Yiren\u2019s head buzzed.But \u2026\u2026Seeing the beautiful appearance of the two of them, her face flushed slightly.Looking at their small size, it seems that I am slightly superior.Wait, I don\u2019t like Su Shi, why would I think that?!Ceng Yiren shook her head violently.She felt ashamed of her ridiculous idea.Looking at the increasingly strange and bizarre atmosphere, Su Shi was about to say something when an ear-piercing whistling sound suddenly sounded.\u201cThat\u2019s a ferocious Spirit Beast!\u201d\u201cThose Spirit Beasts are attacking!\u201dThere was a chaotic sound of shouting from outside.Several people looked at each other and flew out of the room.They saw that the streets were in chaos, and the cultivators were all worried and flew towards the city wall.Seeing the scene in front of them, their eyes were shocked.In the distance, dark clouds swept by with lightning bolts wrapped around them.Accompanied by a sharp and piercing whistle\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s a flock of lightning birds!\u201d\u201cHow can there be so many of them?\u201dWang Mao\u2019s throat was slightly dry.There had been Spirit Beasts attacking the city before, but most of them were just ordinary Spirit Beasts, occasionally interspersed with some Golden Elixir Spirit Beasts.But this time, the scale was huge!It was all a flock of Thunderbirds from the Realm of Golden Elixir!There were nearly a hundred of them!The cultivators\u2019 faces turned pale.They thought that this expedition to the border was just a formality, but they never expected that this expedition would be so dangerous!This level of Spirit Beast swarm was no longer something that ordinary sect disciples could face.Many of them retreated slightly, seemingly already having the intention to retreat.Wang Mao regained his senses and shouted, \u201cListen to orders, all generals, get out of the city for 30 miles, defend to the death and don\u2019t retreat, absolutely don\u2019t let the beasts enter the city!\u201dHe didn\u2019t care what the disciples of the sect thought, but the officers and soldiers of the empire must fight to the last minute!If they die, they must die outside the city!\u201cYes!\u201dThe generals sheathed their swords and rushed out of the city gate to meet up with the Thunderbird flock.Wang Mao looked grim, \u201cStrange, weren\u2019t the previous Spirit Beasts not this powerful?\u201dSu Shi fell from the air, \u201cObviously, this is to welcome us.\u201dWang Mao frowned, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cThe official soldiers are of average strength, and the Spirit Beasts that came also have average strength. But right after the cultivators of the various sects arrived, the Spirit Beasts of the Golden Elixir Realm also came.\u201d\u201cThe strength is only slightly higher, but it won\u2019t attract a large force to attack.\u201dSu Shi said indifferently: \u201cThis is an organized attack, the purpose is also not to seize Huangyuan City.\u201dWang Mao\u2019s heart jumped and recalled, \u201cEvery time those Spirit Beasts attacked, it was superficial, as if their purpose was just to kill people\u2026. Could there be some kind of conspiracy?\u201dSu Shi\u2019s eyes were slightly sunken.Sure enough, and he guessed the same thing.\u201cBut they seem to have underestimated us too much.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dWang Mao looked at him in confusion.Only to see Su Shi\u2019s eyes cold, smiling coldly, \u201cThey don\u2019t think that with this flock of Spirit Beasts alone, it can kill us all, right?\u201dChen Qingluan walked to his side and silently drew out her Autumn Water longsword.Zhan Qingchen\u2019s Dao Technique flowed around her, her moon-white Daoist Robe fluttering in the wind.Cen Yiren carried a greatsword on her shoulders, her hands glittering with jade.Wang Mao swallowed his saliva.There is no trace of timidity on the faces of these people, but rather more faintly \u2026\u2026It seems that they are even excited?1. You might already know this but I translated Spirit Beast as Demonic Beast before, I honestly don\u2019t see any difference between the two.2. The title of this chapter are all idioms.\u6885\u5f00\u4e09\u5ea6,\u5851\u6599\u59d0\u59b9\u60c5! \u2013 Three braces, plastic sisterhood!\u2013 Three Braces refers to the same event happening 3 times in a row. In this chapter it refers to the girls who successively sneaked into Su Shi\u2019s room.\u2013 Plastic Sisterhood, plastic here refers to plastic flowers, which are fake but beautiful and long-lasting.

    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 \u2013 Is this the strongest genius power in the Nine Regions?Outside Huangyuan City.Two figures were hidden in the shadows, both with ugly evil ghost masks on their faces.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect reinforcements to come so quickly.\u201dOne of them asked, \u201cTogether with these cultivators, there are almost enough, right?\u201dThe other nodded, \u201cYes, these practitioners don\u2019t have low strength and their blood energy is much stronger than the offici al army.\u201d\u201cHehehe, master must be very satisfied, he might even reward us heavily.\u201d\u201cBut those sect disciples, they won\u2019t cause any trouble, right?\u201dThe man was a little worried.If we were to attract great power, it would be a waste of resources and manpower.\u201cWhat are you afraid of? It won\u2019t take long to solve everything, even if human experts come, they won\u2019t find us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe two of them chatted with each other.Clearly, in their eyes, there was no longer any tension.Nearly a hundred Golden Elixir Thunderbirds, how could these cultivators possibly stop them?Boom!At this moment, a loud explosion came from the distance.The two people looked up in confusion and froze.\u201cThis is \u2026\u2026\u201d###Seeing the Thunderbird swarm getting closer and closer, the cultivators on the city wall looked tense.It was almost a hundred Spirit Beasts from the Golden Elixir Realm!How could they fight against them?Although most of them were in the Golden Elixir Realm as well, how could they compete with the fierce Spirit Beast swarms that weren\u2019t afraid of death?They came to support the frontier, but they didn\u2019t want to risk their lives!But if they ran away like that, they wouldn\u2019t be able to succeed in the Nine Regions in the future.Just as the group was hesitating, there was suddenly an oppressive rumbling sound beside them.They looked at the voice.\u201cShengzi Su?\u201dThey only saw Su Shi holding his sword in his left hand, his right hand gripping the hilt, and the Green Frost Sword was constantly shaking, letting out a clang of excitement!Chop!A slash like thunder!Heaven and earth suddenly went dark, leaving only the dazzling light of the sword!Heavenly Sword Draw Technique!Like a galaxy hanging upside down, the dazzling sword light instantly spanned tens of miles and slashed into the dark cloud formed by the Spirit Beasts.Boom!The \u201cdark cloud\u201d instantly dispersed!Nearly half of the Thunderbirds were cut in half and their limbs fell like raindrops!Even the blood was vaporized by the sword qi!This sword was like cutting through the sky!A dead silence enveloped the city walls.People stared at Su Shi in disbelief.If I remembered correctly, Shengzi Su was only in the Golden Elixir Realm, right?One sword had killed dozens of Spirit Beasts that came from the same realm?How could this be possible?Wang Mao\u2019s back was slightly cold.Is this the strength of the strongest genius in the Nine Regions?This is too much!Su Shi put his sword into its sheath.His breathing was regular and his face did not change.Cen Yiren said dissatisfiedly, \u201cDamn it, there aren\u2019t many of them, but you cut half of them with one slash!\u201dZhan Qingchen and Chen Qingluan were indifferent as they flew into the Thunderbird flock like flash.One roared with dao and the other surged with sword energy.The two seemed to be busy in their own battle, slaying beasts with ear-piercing wails.Both were truly heavenly pride, they were also practicing the best heavenly techniques and abilities.Other than the opportunities gained in the ancient emperor\u2019s secret realm, their combat strength was far from comparable to these Spirit Beasts.\u201cWait for me!\u201dCen Yiren\u2019s feet exploded under the boulders and she flew out with a sword on her shoulder.The originally aggressive Spirit Beasts were killed in an instant, and the rest wailed and fled for their lives. The soldiers and practitioners stood in place, their expressions slightly dumbfounded.Is this the end of all this?This group of thunderbirds made everyone\u2019s hearts and guts cold, but they never expected to be chased and killed by the four of them \u2026\u2026Wang Mao shook his head with a bitter smile.Could this be the difference between an ordinary person and a genius?\u201cShengzi Su\u2026\u2026 eh?\u201d\u201cWhere is Shengzi Su?\u201d####In the shadows.The two people froze in their tracks.\u201cWhat, what is this?\u201d\u201cDid you see sword qi earlier? Is this really an ability that a cultivator from the Golden Elixir Realm can use?\u201d\u201cIt seems that this group of cultivators is even more terrifying than we imagined!\u201dThey thought it was a very easy task, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be cleared in the blink of an eye.There were only four of them on the other side, yet they destroyed nearly a hundred Golden Elixir Thunderbirds!Especially the man in white robe carrying that sword!It was terrifying!\u201cSomething is wrong, we must inform Master as soon as possible!\u201dThe two men had just turned around, but they saw a man in white standing behind them.It was the man who had performed the stunning blow!Su Shi smiled and said, \u201cHave you seen enough good show?\u201dThe two men looked at each other and gulped, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t need to know.\u201dSu Shi\u2019s palm lit up with a blue halo, like a slowly blooming blue lotus.His icy handsome face reflected the blue light.\u201cJust die in peace.\u201d\u201cRun!\u201dThe two flew almost simultaneously.However, the next second, the palm wrapped in blue light was already pressing against their backs.Bang!Their tendons and bones were broken and their hearts were crushed.Their lives were instantly cut off!The two men\u2019s eyes lost focus and slowly became dim.They couldn\u2019t understand how such an easy task could turn out like this.Su Shi reached out and removed their masks.Human face, beast ears, canine teeth.\u201cThis is truly an outsider race.\u201dSu Shi\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly.He turned his head to look towards the desert, and a trace of cold flashed under his eyes.####\u201cTrash, bunch of trash!\u201dInside the luxury tent, a man with hidden tiger stripes on his forehead overturned the table.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that blood energy is imminent, but something went wrong at a time like this!\u201dThe man with the green ghost face mask on the side bowed his head and said, \u201cReinforcements from the Linlang Empire have arrived, disciples from various sects, some of them are very strong.\u201d\u201cHow strong are they?\u201dThe tiger-striped man gritted his teeth and said, \u201cBut they are only Golden Elixir practitioners! If it was human experts who really came, then we wouldn\u2019t stand a chance!\u201dThe man in the ghost mask asked, \u201cThen what should we do now?\u201d\u201cWe must execute the plan ahead of schedule!\u201dThe man in the tiger mask said in a deep voice: \u201cThe old ancestor\u2019s body won\u2019t last long, and Yu Yuan is starting to suspect me, even if the blood energy is insufficient, we can\u2019t help it, we must start the formation as soon as possible!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe ghost masked man bowed and retreated.\u201cYou are the one who forced me to do this!\u201dThe tiger-striped man\u2019s eyes were grim.####Green Hill Plain.Smoke was billowing in the bedroom.Yu Ren\u2019er was lying on the bed, her white legs open under the hem of her skirt, playing with the black neck ring in her hand.The expression on her beautiful face changed, sometimes smiling, sometimes shy.\u201cI wonder what brother Su Shi is doing? Did he miss me?\u201dThen she thought of something, like a deflated ball, \u201cHe must be with Chief Zhan, right?\u201d\u201cSo annoying~\u201dYu Ren\u2019er rolled on the bed with her neck ring.Although she knew it was wrong, she couldn\u2019t help but think of Su Shi.Knock knock knock.At that moment, there was a knock on the door.\u201cRen\u2019er, are you asleep?\u201d\u201cFather?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 \u2013 Happy Yu Ren\u2019er, Formation of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands of Blood Slaughter!A middle-aged man wearing a black robe with a velvet collar walked into the room.He had bright cheeks and a slender figure, as if he was a frail scholar.Yu Ren\u2019er hurriedly hid the beast ring and sat down, \u201cFather, what brings you here?\u201dSeeing her small movements, Yu Yuan shook his head helplessly.Since she came back from the Linlang Empire, she seemed a bit uncomfortable, and he didn\u2019t know what she was thinking about all day.\u201cI came to tell you, from now on don\u2019t sneak out again, especially not to Huangyuan City.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dYu Ren\u2019er replied in a breathless voice.The last time she sneaked out, she was severely reprimanded by Yu Yuan after he found it.Seeing that she was in a bad mood, Yu Yuan sighed and said, \u201cRecently, Huangyuan City has been attacked frequently by Spirit Beasts, and the Linlang Empire suspects that outsiders are responsible for this. Your status is special, and if you are discovered by humans, you may be in big trouble.\u201dYu Ren\u2019er frowned and said, \u201cWhat exactly happened?\u201dYu Yuan said in a deep voice, \u201cIt\u2019s likely related to the Tiger Clan, but I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re doing.\u201dThe Barbarian Realm was vast, but they were not united.Similar to the human kingdom, there were hundreds of other races and clans scattered throughout the Barbarian Realm.Those with noble bloodlines and powerful clans were called \u201cnoble clans\u201d and usually had many smaller clans that followed.The Dangshan Tiger Clan and Qingqiu Fox Clan are both among the top noble clans.However, the relationship between these two clans was very bad.The tiger clan was originally very powerful, but since the death of its ancestor, it had fallen into decline and had been suppressed by the fox clan for many years.\u201cThere are nearly 100 Golden Elixir Thunderbirds, if it is said that there is no one controlling them, I don\u2019t believe it at all.\u201dYu Yuan\u2019s eyes flickered.What exactly is the tiger clan thinking?Yu Ren\u2019er staggered, \u201cSo many! In that case, Huangyuan City should have suffered many deaths and injuries, right?\u201dAlthough she didn\u2019t have a good impression about the human race \u2026\u2026 of course, except for brother Su Shi.But most of them are innocent people.Yu Yuan shook his head: \u201cNot a single person died.\u201d\u201cReinforcements from the Linlang Empire have already arrived, came some sect disciples, the strength is not bad, especially Su Shi, with his sword he slashed dozens of Thunderbirds~\u201d\u201cAs expected of someone with Holy-grade perfect talent, his strength can\u2019t be compared to someone in the same realm.\u201dThe Linlang Empire had a super genius, and this had spread to the Barbarian Realm.But Yu Yuan did not expect the young man to be so powerful.\u201cSu Shi?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er froze for a moment and said in disbelief, \u201cBrother Su Shi is also here?\u201d\u201cBrother\u2026. Su Shi?\u201dYu Yuan looked at her with a suspicious face, \u201cYou two know each other?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er blushed and stammered, \u201cWe just had the chance to meet last time I went to Linlang Empire.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dYu Yuan cupped his chin, always feeling that something was wrong with his daughter.Yu Ren\u2019er lowered her head, and there seemed to be starlight in her eyes.Brother Su Shi is in Huangyuan City!Then, won\u2019t I be able to meet him again?I am very happy!####Huangyuan City, the Great House of the City Lord.In the council hall, representatives from various sects sat.Their faces were full of smiles and they spoke eloquently.\u201cI told you, with Shengzi Su here, what kind of beast can be a match?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that sword is truly amazing, it\u2019s like cutting through heaven and earth!\u201d\u201cDozens of Golden Elixir Spirit Beasts were instantly killed, what kind of concept is this!?\u201d\u201cAnd Chief Zhan and Imperial Censor Chen, ckck, worthy of top heavenly prides!\u201d\u201cTo be honest, my legs were a little weak just now.\u201dWang Mao also had a smile on his face.The Spirit Beasts that attacked this time were extremely powerful.Originally, the officers and soldiers already had a death wish, but in the end, there were no casualties at all, and the main credit for this goes to Su Shi!Wang Mao said: \u201cSu Shengzi, why don\u2019t you say a few words?\u201dThe atmosphere was instantly quiet.Everyone looked at the man sitting in the first place.Su Shi, who had been silent, raised his head and said indifferently: \u201cIf you want to hear my opinion, all of you should go back, no need to risk your lives.\u201dPeople\u2019s expressions froze.They didn\u2019t expect Su Shi to say such things.Zhan Qingchen and the others also froze.Wang Mao frowned, \u201cShengzi Su, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cExactly what I said literally.\u201dSu Shi raised his palm and threw two corpses.Looking at the human-faced and beast-eared corpses on the ground, Wang Mao\u2019s pupils shrank, \u201cOutsider?\u201dSu Shi said: \u201cThe Spirit Beasts that attacked Huangyuan City, the outsiders are behind it. The Thunderbird flock is not the end, on the contrary, the real danger has just begun.\u201dWang Mao frowned: \u201cThen what was the purpose of their attack on Huangyuan City?\u201d\u201cTo set up a formation.\u201dSu Shi said bluntly, \u201cThe outsiders want to set up a Blood Slaughter Formation in Huangyuan City, using the city as a furnace, using blood qi as the formation guide to refine all living things in the city into blood essence.\u201dHis voice was not loud.But in the ears of the people, it was like a boom of thunder!\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cRefining the entire city into a formation?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 that\u2019s too horrible!\u201dThe people\u2019s scalps tingled and cold air rose up their hairs.Wang Mao rose to his feet, \u201cShengzi Su, are you sure?\u201dSu Shi sighed and said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t so sure at first, but now \u2026\u2026.\u201dThe first time he got off the flying boat today, he saw the black air condensing over the city, the color of blood rushing into the sky.This is the harbinger of a great evil!Plus that flock of thunderbirds and those two outsiders\u2026 this was exactly like in the book!The formation of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands of Blood Slaughter!Wang Mao helplessly sat back in his chair.Su Shi wouldn\u2019t joke about such things, this crisis in Huangyuan City is far beyond everyone\u2019s imagination!The other party actually wanted to slaughter hundreds of thousands of humans!\u201cThe Thunderbird flock has been defeated, the other party will probably start early to avoid exposing their plans, so \u2026\u2026\u201dSu Shi\u2019s gaze swept through the people, \u201cYou guys can still run now.\u201dThis group of people were just cultivators in the Golden Elixir Realm, even if they stayed, they couldn\u2019t do anything.It was better to make it clear.Those people\u2019s faces turned pale and their heads lowered.The atmosphere became extremely silent and oppressive.Wang Mao was silent for a long time and said in a loud voice: \u201dWhat about the people in the city?\u201dSu Shi said: \u2018 \u2018Try to evacuate them.\u201dWang Mao laughed bitterly, \u2018 \u2018There are more than 200,000 people, how can we evacuate them?\u201dHuangyuan City was located on the border, remote, and the nearest city was thousands of miles away, and they only had a few hundred men in total \u2026\u2026Even if he sent a letter to Weiyang Capital now, it would take at least two days to get there.By the time reinforcements arrived, it might already be too late.Wang Mao let out a strangled breath, his expression becoming stern, \u201cI will never abandon the people! Whether you go or stay, go ahead, I will bring the officers and soldiers to fight to the last moment!\u201dDespite his courage, it didn\u2019t help.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, General Wang.\u201d\u201cThis is no longer a problem we can solve.\u201d\u201cI will return to the sect and bring help.\u201dThe cultivators got up and left the table.No one was willing to die in vain, whether they were from the Righteous path or the Demonic path.Before long, there were only a few people left in the crowded council room.Wang Mao\u2019s face turned white as he looked at Su Shi, \u201cShengzi Su, you\u2026\u201dAt this moment, this demon star became the only thing he could rely on.Su Shi got up and stretched his back.\u201cNow, there should be enough room for tonight, right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 \u2013 I don\u2019t care about people\u2019s lives, I only care about you!Su Shi walked out of the council room with his hands behind his back.Cen Yiren got up and followed him out.Wang Mao fell into silence.At a time like this, no one wanted to stay in Huangyuan City, even all the disciples of the Righteous path had basically fled.There was no reason for them to stay.After all, these cultivators weren\u2019t on the Empire\u2019s payroll, so they couldn\u2019t be asked to risk their lives either.But this demon star was willing to stay?Looking at his spontaneous back, Wang Mao\u2019s eyes were somewhat puzzled.\u201cWhat kind of person is he?\u201dZhan Qingchen bit her lip, her heart swaying.Chen Qingluan gripped her sword with her slender hands, not knowing what she was thinking.They walked out of the City Lord\u2019s residence.Cen Yiren fell silent, following Su Shi\u2019s footsteps.Su Shi paused in his steps and said without looking back: \u201cTonight you bring people back to the sect to report the news and inform Her Majesty so that she can send reinforcement as soon as possible.\u201dCen Yiren shook her head, \u201cLet them go back, I won\u2019t go.\u201dSu Shi said lightly, \u201cThis is an order, not to argue with you.\u201dCen Yiren frowned, \u201cBut I \u2026\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish speaking, Su Shi interrupted, \u201cWhen you set out, what did you promise me?\u201dCen Yiren lowered her head and said, \u201cI will listen to any orders from you\u2026 \u2026\u201d\u201cBut why aren\u2019t you coming?\u201dSu Shi was silent for a long time, and said lightly, \u201cBecause there is someone I have to protect here.\u201dLooking at the handsome side of his face, Cen Yiren bit her lip and clenched her hands tightly around her shirt.\u201cUnderstood.\u201dWith that, she turned and fled.Su Shi sighed.Before arriving in Huangyuan City, he still had the leeway to allow her to come along.After all, according to the plot of the book, this event would not start until at least a few months later.Otherwise, he would never have brought Cen Yiren out.\u201cThis event is still too early, I wonder if this is the effect of the plot change?\u201d\u201cTiger Clan, huh?\u201dA hint of bitterness swept across the bottom of Su Shi\u2019s eyes.#####On the city wall.Su Shi sat alone on the edge of the wall, looking at the wilderness bathed in darkness in the distance.It\u2019s unknown what he was thinking about.Rustling.The sound of soft footsteps rang out.A moon-white robe, with a faint scent, sat beside him on the ground.Neither of them spoke, and they sat in silence for a long time.After a moment of hesitation, Zhan Qingchen spoke to break the silence, \u201cSu Shi, you\u2019d better leave quickly.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSu Shi nodded, \u201cThen you and I will leave together.\u201dZhan Qingchen bowed her head and said, \u201cI \u2026\u2026 can\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cTianji Pavilion is revered by people, and I am the Chief Disciple, even if I can\u2019t afford it, how can I leave the people in this city?\u201dThe people of the Righteous path are revered by the people, so it must have the consciousness to die for the people.But Su Shi was different.In the eyes of the world, he was a demon child that was a scourge to the world.This time, he had already done enough to withstand the spirit beasts\u2019 attacks, and he really didn\u2019t need to endure these things.The other party\u2019s answer was really expected by Su Shi.He shook his head and said, \u201cActually, before I came to Huangyuan City, I already had a vague premonition.\u201dZhan Qingchen didn\u2019t understand, \u201cThen why did you come?\u201dSu Shi said with a smile, \u201cBecause I knew that you would definitely come.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dZhan Qingchen froze.\u201cYou are a good person, with a good heart, willing to protect the people with your life.\u201d\u201cBut I am a demon, what do I care if the people live or die?\u201dSu Shi looked at him and said softly, \u201cI only care about you.\u201dZhan Qingchen looked at him in a daze, her eyes trembling slightly.The man\u2019s face became a little hazy as water mist billowed in her eyes.What about the Taoist heart, what about the discipline of cultivation, all of that was left behind at this moment.I only care about you.I would rather be a burden to the world than someone\u2019s heart.Behind them were ten thousand lights, and in front of them was endless darkness, but in their eyes there was only the figure of each other.Su Shi smiled and said: \u201cI can take you away by force, but afterwards, when you find out the tragic state of the city, I\u2019m afraid your heart will collapse in an instant, and it will be worse than death for you.\u201d\u201cSo, I will destroy this Blood Slaughter Formation with my own hands.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not for the sake of the people, it\u2019s just for you.\u201dZhan Qingchen threw herself into his arms, not caring whether anyone would see it or not.Letting her tears soak his chest, she said in a low voice, \u201cBad guy, I want you to live well.\u201dSu Shi rubbed her hair and said softly, \u201cFool, you\u2019ve given me a better life.\u201dZhan Qingchen raised her beautiful face.Her pearly face was amazingly delicate.Her lips gently opened, \u201cKiss me.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cMmm~\u201dIn the distant shadows.A woman in rough and rumpled clothes was leaning against the city wall.She picked up a jug of wine and tilted her head to take a sip.\u201cNot caring about people\u2019s lives\u2026 only caring about you?\u201dHer eyes were blank and unfocused.She looked a little drunk.####Three o\u2019clock in the morning.Su Shi pushed the door open and walked into the room, stunned for a moment.He saw the flickering candlelight.The female swordsman in green was sitting quietly on a chair.\u201cCensor Chen?\u201dSu Shi wondered, \u201cYou don\u2019t go to the wrong room again, do you?\u201dChen Qingluan shook her head, \u201cNo, I\u2019m here to see you.\u201dSu Shi sat opposite her, \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201dChen Qingluan said: \u201cI have ordered someone to go to Weiyang Capital to ask for reinforcements, this news will arrive in two days.\u201d\u201cWe have also informed the nearby cities to send reinforcement to evacuate the people.\u201d\u201cYou should also leave as soon as possible.\u201dSu Shi nodded, \u201cI\u2019ve already asked Cen Yiren and the others to return.\u201dChen Qingluan frowned and said, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dSu Shi smiled, \u201cI have a reason to stay.\u201d\u201cA reason to stay\u2026\u201dChen Qingluan looked at him blankly.The heart beat a little faster, a sweet red secretly spreading.She turned her head and whispered, \u201cSu Shi, for my sake\u2026. you don\u2019t need to do this.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSu Shi froze for a moment, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dChen Qingluan\u2019s face turned red and he snapped, \u201cDon\u2019t pretend, I already know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\u201cAlthough the world thinks of you as a terrifying scourge, but, in my eyes, I know you are not what people say-\u201cThe more she said, the more embarrassed she became, and she couldn\u2019t even lift her head.Su Shi: \u201c\u2026..\u201dBang.Just at that moment, the door to the room was pushed open.Cen Yiren walked in haughtily. Su Shi frowned and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I ask you to bring people back?\u201dCen Yiren nodded and said, \u201cThe disciples are already on their way back to the sect.\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dCen Yiren shook her head with a serious face, \u201cI can\u2019t leave because there\u2019s someone I need to protect here as well.\u201dSu Shi frowned.He looked at the timid Chen Qingluan, and then at the stubborn Cen Yiren.Apparently, there\u2019s something wrong here..\u201cYou two could it be\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go back first!\u201dChen Qingluan picked up the long sword and fled.Cen Yiren crossed her arms and snorted coldly: \u201cSu Shi bastard, I\u2019m not willing to be your concubine in this life! \u201dSushi: \u201c\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 \u2013 The method of breaking the formation, the little fox that suddenly appeared!Early morning.Due to the withdrawal of cultivators, Huangyuan City has become much quieter.The entrance to the city was empty, there were only officers and soldiers standing in twos and threes.Their faces were slightly white and they looked a little nervous.\u201cI heard that outsiders are going to form a formation to slaughter the city, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not.\u201d\u201cNine times out of ten it\u2019s true, otherwise, why would those practitioners be able to escape overnight?\u201d\u201cHmph, they came yesterday and left overnight, what righteous? They are all just cowards who are afraid of death!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, they\u2019re not as good as Shengzi Su of the Netherworld Sect.\u201d\u201cShengzi Su is really a good person.\u201dCurrently, Su Shi\u2019s reputation among the officers and soldiers was extremely high.Although it had only been less than two days.But right after he arrived, he handed over his flying boat to the wounded, slaughtered the Thunderbird flock that attacked the city, and investigated the \u201ctruth\u201d of the Spirit Beasts\u2019 attack on the city.Most importantly, even though he knew it was dangerous, he was still willing to stay in the city to protect the people.This was in stark contrast to the disciples of the Righteous path who were so wise to protect themselves.\u201cAnd Chief Zhan and Imperial Censor Chen, they are the real righteous cultivators!\u201d\u201cBy the way, I should say there\u2019s really no need to guard this city gate, I mean, who\u2019s got the guts to come to Huangyuan City at this time?\u201dAt that moment, a woman in black came from afar.The soldiers froze for a moment and stepped forward to block the way.\u201cWho are you ?\u201dThe woman wore a black veil and her voice was clear and pleasant, \u201cI\u2019m Shengzi Su\u2019s friend, and I\u2019m here to see him.\u201d\u201cWhat is the evidence-\u201cThe officers still wanted to ask. But the light in the woman\u2019s eyes flickered, and their eyes instantly turned dazed.\u201cSo it is Shengz Su\u2019s friend.\u201dThe officers gave way, \u201cPlease enter.\u201dThe woman walked into the city gate with quick steps.Only when her figure disappeared did the officers\u2019 eyes clear.\u201cWhat exactly happened?\u201dThey scratched their heads, not remembering what had just happened, as if nothing had happened.###As if people knew something big was about to happen, the doors were closed and the streets were empty.Su Shi and the others were walking on the streets.His eyes flickered with light, and the True Dragon Qi Perceiving Technique was activated, filling his vision with black and red Qi.Black Qi rushed into the sky and blood light filled the air.The fierce and destructive power was even stronger than yesterday.\u201cIt seems that this formation has been formed a long time ago.\u201dSu Shi\u2019s eyes sank.Huangyuan City was originally a pure land.Although it was not rich, it could still be self-sufficient and its people lived and worked happily.But now, under the influence of the Blood Slaughter Formation, it had forcibly gathered Heavenly Evil Black Qi and turned it into a place of great evil!Those who died in the city would turn into blood spirits and could never be reincarnated!This was a cruel and vicious place!Wang Mao asked: \u201cIs there any way to break this formation?\u201dSu Shi shook his head, \u201cThis is not an ordinary formation, but is based on yin and evil, using blood energy as a guide, it cannot be caught or touched, it is impossible to break.\u201dWang Mao\u2019s face turned white, \u201cSo we can only wait for the other party to make a move without being able to do anything?\u201dAlthough aware of the other party\u2019s conspiracy, but nothing can be done.This feeling was even more desperate.Su Shi said, \u201cAlthough it is impossible to break, but as long as it is a formation, there will be a formation core, there must be a trace \u2026\u2026\u201dThe True Dragon Qi Perceiving Technique was pushed to its limit. The black death aura gradually became clear.A stream of black air was faintly visible, rising from the distant land.This was the source of the deadly Qi.Following the airflow, Su Shi arrived at a small mound of earth and took out a palm-sized silver nail.It was pure silver in color and shone with a faint light.Demon Slaying Spike.He obtained it from Ye Xiao\u2019s storage ring.Su Shi pressed the silver nail into the ground, but there seemed to be great resistance underneath, so he couldn\u2019t nail it for a while.His palm shone with green light and his spiritual power surged out.He pressed the silver nail hard!Boom!The ground trembled, and a boundless black aura rose upwards, as if it were thick smoke covering the sky!People shuddered in unison.Although they couldn\u2019t see the fierce Qi, they could still feel the cold air rising from their bodies.It was like being in a cold mass grave!It was unknown how long it took, but the evil Qi gradually faded away, and the silver nail and a small mound of earth disappeared.\u201cWith insufficient blood energy, and death energy leaking out, the power of the Blood Slaughter Formation will be greatly reduced, this is all I can do.\u201dSu Shi sighed, \u201cBut when the time comes, what the specific situation is, I dare not guarantee.\u201dWang Mao bowed deeply and said sincerely, \u201cThank you, Shengzi Su, for your help. No matter what the outcome, Huangyuan City will always remember your great kindness!\u201dSu Shi shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t need you to remember, I did it for my own sake.\u201dZhan Qingchen and Chen Qingluan lowered their heads shyly at the same time.Both of Cen Yiren\u2019s cheeks were puffed up, and her eyes were sour.At this moment, Su Shi thought of something, \u201cImperial censor Chen, when in the ancient emperor\u2019s secret realm, you obtained a copy of the\u2019Myriad Formations Solution\u2019, did you take it with you?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201dChen Qingluan took out an ancient book and handed it to him, \u201cBut I have read it carefully last night, and there is no record of the Formation of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands of Blood Slaughter.\u201d\u201cIn this world there are thousands of paths, and the same goal can be achieved by different paths.\u201dSu Shi said, \u201cAs long as you truly understand this ancient book, other formations will naturally be solved.\u201dChen Qingluan smiled bitterly, \u201cEasy to say, this ancient book is so profound, how can it be so easy to understand?\u201dSu Shi smiled and said nothing.Beep sounded in his ears:[Acquired formation technique: \u201cMyriad Formations Solution\u201d, can consume 40 plot points to learn it automatically.]Forty plot points, equal to the True Dragon Qi Perceiving Technique.The Ancient Emperor\u2019s Inheritance was not biased, and the two rewards were exactly the same value.\u201cForty points isn\u2019t bad.\u201d\u201cThink of it as an additional insurance policy.\u201d[Would you like to learn the formation technique: \u201cMyriad Formations Solution\u201d?\u201cConfirm.\u201dPlot points were deducted.The ancient book lit up and the words jumped into his consciousness, and the outlines of countless formations swirled in his mind.Of course, this scene could only be seen by him.Su Shi had a feeling of enlightenment, almost instantly he understood countless formations, and even had a different understanding of the entire world.His eyes scanned his surroundings, and he quickly deconstructed in his mind.\u201cSure enough, the demon embrio was buried in the city a long time ago.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid the Tiger tribe has been preparing this scheme for no less than ten years!\u201d\u201cWhat a cruel plan!\u201dSu Shi\u2019s eyes were cold.At this moment, a black figure came into view.At the same time, the other party also saw it.The two looked at each other.Su Shi froze, \u201cYu-\u201c\u201cBrother Su Shi!\u201dThe young girl in black ran into his arms and hugged him like a koala.The young girl raised her watery eyes, \u201cBrother Su Shi, I missed you so much!\u201dThe atmosphere became deathly quiet.\u201cBrother\u2026. Su Shi?\u201dZhan Qingchen\u2019s low voice rang out.Chen Qingluan didn\u2019t say a word, her gaze colder than sword qi.Cen Yiren carried the sword in her hand, carefully sizing up the young girl, seemingly thinking about where it would be more appropriate to cut.Feeling the murderous aura, Wang Mao swallowed and said with difficulty, \u201cCough cough, I\u2019m a little hungry, I\u2019ll go to the tavern first, you guys please have a chat\u2026.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he ran away.Seeing Yu Ren\u2019er clinging in his arms, Su Shi frowned.\u201cWhy are you here?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 \u2013 Formation launched, wall of flesh and blood!Yu Ren\u2019er looked at Su Shi dumbfoundedly, \u201cBrother Su Shi, do you miss me?\u201dFeeling a colder murderous aura around him, Su Shi gulped, \u201cHow about you go down first?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er regained consciousness, raised her head and looked around. \u201cChief, Chief Zhan!?\u201dShe hurriedly released Su Shi and lowered her head with a red face, as if she was a child who had done something wrong.It\u2019s over!Just now, I only saw brother Su Shi, I didn\u2019t even see anyone else there.In Chief Zhan\u2019s eyes, I must be a bad woman, right?Zhan Qingchen\u2019s brows furrowed slightly.This figure seemed somewhat familiar \u2026\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re the mysterious girl from the Ancient Emperor\u2019s Secret Realm?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er raised her head and smiled sarcastically, \u201dRight, long time no see, my name is Yu Ren\u2019er.\u201dZhan Qingchen was slightly stunned for a moment.She had worn a veil before, and she didn\u2019t know what she really looked like.She never thought she would look so beautiful!Her eyebrows were like a painting, her cheeks were like peach blossoms, like a delicate porcelain doll, not a single flaw could be found.\u201cSo, you are a beauty.\u201dZhan Qingchen glared at Su Shi, her heart sour.This playboy!Chen Qingluan\u2019s eyes were cold as she asked, \u201cYou seem to be on good terms with Shengzi Su?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er scratched her head, \u201cI do.\u201dChen Qingluan gritted her teeth and said, \u201cWe have been together for quite a while before, but you two rarely talk to each other, but now that your relationship has become so close, could there be something going on between you two?\u201d\u201cWhat has happened?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er gripped the corner of her dress with her delicate hands.How to answer her?That the two of them almost died, Su Shi pinched her tail, and she slept in Su Shi\u2019s arms?She looked at Su Shi with pity and her lips made a mouth shape:\u201cBrother Su, please!\u201dSu Shi said helplessly: \u201cAlright, please don\u2019t put too much pressure on her\u2026 She is my friend.\u201dYu Ren\u2019er nodded vigorously, \u201cYes, yes, we are friends.\u201d\u201cFriends?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201dThe two of them are very close to each other, and the girl also calls him \u201cBrother Su Shi\u201d, obviously their relationship is not simple.Zhan Qingchen\u2019s eyes were sultry, and her mouth pouted slightly.What the heck! I\u2019ve never even called him brother before!Su Shi looked at the little fox and frowned, \u201cWhy did you suddenly come to Huangyuan City?\u201dYu Ren\u2019er said: \u201cI heard from my father that Huangyuan City was attacked. And you killed those thunderbirds. So I sneaked over to meet you.\u201dSu Shi shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s really not the right time for you to be here now.\u201dThe news that the outsiders had formed a formation in an attempt to refine the people had spread.The city was now in an uproar, and the hatred towards outsiders had reached its peak.Although this is the action of the Tiger Clan and has nothing to do with the Qingqiu white fox, in the eyes of mankind, all outsiders are in the same gang, so there is no difference between tigers and foxes!If Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s identity is revealed, it is likely to cause a big mess!\u201cThe situation in Huangyuan City is dangerous, you should return as soon as possible.\u201d Su Shi said.\u201cPrecisely the reason why I have to stay here is because there is danger, I want to protect Brother Su Shi!\u201dHe raised his pink fist with a serious face.Su Shi said helplessly: \u201cBut this is not something you can solve \u2026\u2026\u201dHe briefly explained that the Tiger Clan was setting up a Blood Slaughter Formation, preparing to purify all living beings residing in the city.\u201cWhat?!\u201dYu Ren\u2019er took a breath, \u201cQiu Hu actually went to such lengths to be cruel?\u201dThere are many civilians in this city!More than 200,000 lives, that is truly heartless!Realizing the seriousness of this matter, she became serious, \u201cI will go back and tell my father that the Barbarian Community will not tolerate such a thing!\u201dThis was no longer just a matter of friction between the two races.This was a declaration of war against mankind that would contaminate countless souls and plunge the entire Barbarian Realm into war!Just as Yu Ren\u2019er was about to leave, dark clouds drifted across the sky, blocking the sunlight.Their surroundings instantly became dark.\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201dSu Shi looked gloomy, \u201cThey\u2019ve already made their move.\u201dBoom!A blood-red veil flashed, holding the entire Huangyuan City upside down.A winding blood-red moon hung in the sky.Vision dimmed and the air was filled with the stench of blood.A dark crack opened within the void, and a deafening roar of spirit beasts came from it!\u201cPrepare for battle!\u201dOfficers and soldiers poured out onto the streets, staring nervously at the dimensional cracks.Click.A monstrous claw extended.\u201cRoar!\u201dIn the next instant, endless spirit beasts swept in like a tidal wave!Among the dark clouds\u2026Qiu Hu and the figure of the ghost masked man were hidden, looking down at the desolate town with the blood moon hanging upside down.\u201cIs there enough blood energy?\u201dQiu Hu asked.The ghost-faced man shook his head, \u201cStill not enough, it\u2019s a pity that group of cultivators escaped, otherwise \u2026\u2026\u201dAt this point, he seemed to realize something and exclaimed, \u201cWait, why is there also less and less evil aura?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dQiu Hu frowned and looked.He saw that the evil and blood aura above the city had indeed become much thinner.It was like thick smoke before, but now there was only a faint layer.He had a bad feeling in his heart.\u201cIt seems that the plan has been revealed, someone has broken the evil Qi before!\u201dBut now, there was no turning back.Qiu Hu\u2019s eyes were cold.\u201cNo matter what, we must successfully hatch the demon embryo! This is our last chance!\u201d\u201cOpen the crack to the maximum and replenish the blood qi as soon as possible!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe man in the ghost mask replied, and the blood jade in his hand flashed with red light.\u201cRoar!\u201dThe ferocious Spirit Beasts seemed endless, rushing through the streets like a flood.The entire ground trembled, and houses and pavilions shook and fell.The officers and soldiers were pale, their hands trembling slightly as they gripped their swords.Although they had prepared themselves to face death, when faced with such a terrifying scene, they couldn\u2019t help but feel a chill down their spine!Who would want to be the food of a wild beast?At this point, Wang Mao drew his sword and said loudly, \u201cThe civilians are right behind you, if you\u2019re afraid, 200,000 people will die!\u201d\u201cWithout reinforcements, one person will be used as two people!\u201d\u201cWithout a wall, your flesh and blood is the wall!\u201d\u201cEven if we become the food of these beasts, we can\u2019t let them harm the people in this city!\u201dWang Mao looked around him, \u201cAll of you, listen to my orders!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cOnly advance, no retreat, kill!\u201d\u201cKill!The officers and soldiers, their eyes red with blood, roared and charged towards the wave of spirit beasts.If you are afraid, you will die, if you are not afraid, you will die too!Kill!However, someone was faster than them.\u201cKill.\u201dAn indifferent voice sounded, seemingly echoing in everyone\u2019s hearts.The green ice sword light wrapped in sword Qi, like an endless cosmic galaxy, cut off the beast tide of the nine heavens.Boom!The tide was cut off, blood and flesh flying everywhere!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Great Sage of the Big Dipper, the mighty light of a thousand lights!\u201dThe light in her palm exploded, like the morning snow that met the sun, instantly turning the horde of spirit beasts into ashes!Chen Qingluan rose into the air with her sword.Autumn Water\u2019s long sword trembled slightly, turning into countless long swords and floating in the air.\u201cHaa!!!\u201dA rumbling sound was spat out, and the swords rained down, cutting the horde of spirit beasts to a pulp with a wailing sound!Yu Ren\u2019er sprouted lotuses with every step, and as her clothes fluttered, the horde turned around and started killing each other!Cen Yiren\u2019s two arms shone with jade, and lifted the empty house next to her.\u201cDie!\u201dShe threw it towards the horde of spirit beasts that flooded in like a tide!Boom!!! Swoosh!!! Clank!!!The four people, along with the soldiers, charged into the ferocious stream of spirit beasts!Daoist techniques roared and sword qi shot out like waves!The officers and soldiers looked at this scene in astonishment.\u201cIs this the power of the top heavenly pride?\u201d\u201cThis is too terrifying!\u201d\u201cThey, with this kind of strength, are only in their twenties?\u201dWang Mao was the first to come to his senses and said in a loud voice, \u201cEveryone spread out, look for spirit beasts in the city, look after each other, and make sure that people are safe!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeeing the great strength of Su Shi and the others, the morale of the officers and soldiers was greatly boosted at this moment!Wang Mao gripped his sword tightly in his hand, and rocks cracked under his feet as he slashed at the spirit beast!\u201cKill!\u201dEven if the blood moon is in the sky, even if the tide of beasts is like a flood!As long as they didn\u2019t give up, there was still hope for everything!Su Shi\u2019s spiritual power surged like a river, the Heavenly Sutra rotated rapidly, and his sword energy cut endlessly.Slash, slash, slash, slash, slash!!!Boom, boom, boom, boom!The Heavenly Sword Draw Technique did not stop.The beast in front of him was fragile like paper, constantly cut into two halves, and the corpses at his feet piled up like a mountain!But as soon as another cracks appeared, it would fill up with spirit beasts in front of him.Those spirit beasts are too many!Slash!After the twelfth time the Green Frost Sword slashed, the inexhaustible sword qi finally came to a halt.Those spirit beasts seemed to have found their chance, roaring and running wildly towards him.Then they were greeted by a pair of cold eyes and a blooming green lotus.Eight Desolate Six Harmonious Palms!Boom!The green light penetrated nearly a thousand meters, and countless spirit beasts were annihilated into mush!Those spirit beasts paused in their steps, their eyes slightly scared.They finally realized that the man in front of them was not prey.Instead, he was a true hunter and slaughterer!However, the next moment, under the light of the blood moon, their eyes were again filled with blood, filled with cruel and insane killing intent!\u201cRoar!\u201dThe spirit beast wave came again!Seeing the dimensional cracks in the air, Su Shi frowned slightly.\u201cWhere did they come from? Ferocious Spirit Beasts are practically endless!\u201d\u201cMust find a way to seal these cracks!\u201dRight at that moment,The void shook, only to see several cracks actually merge together, forming a huge black hole.It was as if the sky had been torn apart.Boom, boom!The void trembled, footsteps came, and a huge black hand poked out of the black hole!It was so muscular and huge that its arm alone was almost as wide as this street!Can you imagine how terrifying that would be?\u201cIt\u2019s a demon!\u201dWang Mao\u2019s voice trembled, \u201cIt\u2019s a vicious demon in the Realm of Nascent Soul!\u201dThe black demon struggled to crawl out of the black hole.Its shape was similar to a human, with a bloody mouth full of sharp teeth and a huge ugly face with nearly a hundred eyes!\u201cRoaaar, human, food \u2026\u2026\u201dThe ferocious demon was drooling, a hundred eyes greedily looking at the people.\u201cHe can spit out human words?

    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 \u2013 You Jiao Long attacks, the Blood Slaughter Formation is unleashed!Qiu Hu froze like a wooden chicken.\u00a01The failure of the previous Thunderbird flock to attack the city had taught him a lesson.This time, he used the blood jade to connect to the depths of the Barbarian Realm, directly dropping Spirit Beasts into the city, a continuous stream of Spirit Beasts slaughtering living things to make up for the previous lack of blood qi.As long as the blood energy is sufficient and the blood moon is complete, then the Blood Slaughter Formation can be successfully activated.The blood essence would be refined to nourish the demon embryo.That\u2019s more than 200,000 human blood essences!If the old ancestor demon embryo could be successfully hatched, the Tiger Clan would have supreme strength!At the same time, it would trigger a war between the two races, and the entire Barbarian Realm would be reshuffled, and the Tiger Clan could seize the opportunity to return to the top of the Barbarian Realm!He had planned this game for nearly ten years!Yet now it had been destroyed by some Golden Elixir Realm practitioners?The ghost masked man whispered: \u201cI said that among the supporting cultivators this time, there are some very powerful ones \u2026\u2026\u201dQiu Hu gritted his teeth, \u201cThen you didn\u2019t say they were that strong!\u201dHe was already cautious enough.Those fierce waves of Spirit Beasts, or that terrifying demon, were definitely not something Golden Elixir Realm practitioners could withstand.It was impossible to make any mistakes.But the other side only had four people, yet they had turned the tide!The ghost masked man said with difficulty, \u201cThey are the top heavenly pride of Linlang Kingdom, especially the man in white, he is the Shengzi of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, Su Shi, a Holy-grade perfect genius not seen in ten thousand years.\u201dQiu Hu froze for a moment, \u201cNetherworld Rakshasa Sect? The sect of Netherworld Demon Empress, Yun Qiluo?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe man in the ghost mask nodded.Qiu Hu\u2019s expression changed, and a trace of fear flashed in his eyes.\u201cNo, we absolutely cannot allow this!\u201d\u201cEven if the blood energy is insufficient, we can\u2019t wait, prepare to activate the formation and catalyze the hatching of the demon embryo!\u201dThe man in the ghost mask hesitated: \u201cBut the blood moon is not complete, even if it successfully hatches, the power of the old ancestor will not be able to reach its peak.\u201dThere was not enough blood energy and evil energy leaked out.The power of the Blood Slaughter Formation was only 1/10th left.Qiu Hu frowned and said, \u201cWe can\u2019t delay any longer! If the human experts arrive, you and I will both be finished~!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe ghost-faced man squeezed the blood jade in his hand.At that moment, an indifferent voice sounded:\u201cHa, I found you.\u201d\u201cWho?!\u201dThe two men jerked back only to see a woman dressed in extremely rumpled clothes standing behind them, shaking the jug of wine in her hand.The ghost-masjed man froze, then took a cold breath, \u201cBlue, Blue Dragon?!\u201dYu Jiao Long tilted her head, curious, \u201cYou really know me?\u201d\u201cMy lord, run away, she is the Eastern Saint of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect!\u201dThe ghost masked man turned around and ran away instantly.The next second, his feet left his body, like a kite with a broken string falling into the clouds.Qiu Hu didn\u2019t even see how his opponent attacked!He finally realized that something was wrong, his forehead flashed with tiger stripes and his body stretched hundreds of miles in an instant!Yu Jiao Long hesitated for a moment.After looking at the city below, she shook her head and said, \u201cJust run, just run, my mission is just to protect Su Shi.\u201dShe slowly descended from the air and walked towards the ghost masked man.His body was almost cut off at the waist, and he had fallen ten thousand feet in the air, but the ghost-faced man was still alive.He was lying on the ground, twitching and convulsing, his blood flowing freely on the ground.Lifting the green ghost mask, Yu Jiao Long frowned slightly.\u201cA human?\u201dThe face of a middle-aged man was behind this ghost mask!Yu Jiao Long shook her head, \u201cYou\u2019re human, but you like to be a dog for outsiders, your hobby is quite unique .\u201dThe man in the ghost mask spat out blood from his mouth and laughed, \u201cUnfortunately, you are still a step too late.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dYu Jiao Long lowered her head.Only to see that the blood jade was drenched in his blood and emitted an intense red light!And the huge formation that enveloped Huangyuan City actually began to slowly rotate!\u201cNo!\u201dShe quickly flew into the sky above Huangyuan City.But the blood-colored shield blocked her out.Yu Jiao Long spread out her palms, and a silver King\u2019s Spear appeared out of thin air!\u201cOpen it for me!\u201dBoom!####Inside Huangyuan City.The dimensional cracks closed, and without the constant influx of Spirit Beasts, the Spirit Beasts in the city were finally slaughtered.Corpses filled the streets, piling up into mountains, and the pungent smell of blood filled the nostrils.Su Shi\u2019s face was slightly pale.Even with the blessing of the Heavenly Sutra, such intense use of his Mystical Ability had almost drained his spiritual energy.The soldiers were in even worse shape.They sat on the ground and took out spirit stones and began to rest.Most of the officers and soldiers were covered in the color of blood, and many were buried in the mouths of beasts, but overall the casualties were very small.Wang Mao limped in, panting, and said, \u201cShengzi Su, are we safe for now?\u201d\u201cCan be said that way\u2013\u201dBut before he could finish his words, he looked up sharply.He saw a blood moon blooming in the sky with a dazzling light, and a red mist faintly filled the air.Su Shi\u2019s pupils contracted, \u201cThis is bad! The formation is activated!\u201d\u201cWaaaaa!!!\u201dA baby-like cry rang out.Against the background of the blood moon, an infant child with a dark demonic aura hung in the air.Its eyes were red, its skin was pitch black, and its mouth was full of horrible sharp teeth!A demonic baby!Qiu Hu had attempted to refine 200,000 living beings for the sake of this old ancestral demon embrio!\u201cWaaaa!!!\u201dThe baby\u2019s cry was sharp and piercing.The bodies of those people suddenly sank, as if a thousand pounds were weighing on them.Blood flowed from the mouths and noses of the officers and soldiers, but instead of dripping down, it rolled backwards and flew into the air, coalescing into blood-colored crystals.As the blood crystals grew larger and larger, the blood in their bodies boiled.Even their skin began to ooze clots of blood!If the soldiers alone were like this, what happened to the civilians you can imagine!Suppressing the surge of blood, Su Shi clenched his teeth, \u201cThe blood energy is insufficient, and evil energy is leaking out, and even so, they want to forcefully activate the formation?\u201dThis is crazy!Zhan Qingchen came over with difficulty and asked, \u201cWhat should we do now?\u201dSu Shi\u2019s eyes were cold.He managed to weaken the power of the Blood Slaughter Formation temporary.Nevertheless, it was not something that ordinary people could withstand.If enough blood essence accumulated and this demonic embryo actually managed to hatch, it was likely that everyone would die here!\u201cCackle.\u201dThe tire demon\u2019s crimson eyes looked at the people and opened its huge and terrifying mouth, revealing a greedy smile.\u201cThe only thing that can be done right now is\u2026\u201dSu Shi looked at the blood moon and said indifferently, \u201cTo remove the moon.\u201dZhan Qingchen didn\u2019t understand, \u201cRemoving the moon?\u201dHow could this be done?Su Shi took out his Chalcedony Aura, swallowed a drop of spiritual liquid, and his pale face regained a trace of blood.Then he took out a pile of spiritual weapons and immortal treasures, and quickly made a formation around several people.A bright light flashed to protect them.The pressure on the formation immediately eased.Su Shi looked at Zhan Qingchen with a bright smile.\u201cYou wait here, don\u2019t move, I will go and remove the moon to show you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 \u2013 All of you, watch me pluck the stars and embrace the moon!The blood moon was in the sky.Red light spilled out at every corner.The Blood Slaughter Formation seemed to be slowly spinning like a grinding wheel, as if it wanted to smash all living things in the city into pieces.The blood in people\u2019s bodies churned as they looked at the monstrous demonic embryo in horror.The blood moon was still so powerful even though it wasn\u2019t full. If the blood energy became a full moon, it was likely that all living things would turn into blood in an instant!Wang Mao\u2019s eyes shuddered.If it weren\u2019t for Su Shi, the magnificent Huangyuan City would have been completely reduced to a ghost domain!But now \u2026\u2026\u201cShengzi Su!\u201dJust when Su Shi was about to take a step.Wang Mao stopped in front of him.Su Shi frowned, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dWang Mao said, \u201cLet me do it, I will go and destroy that demon embryo.\u201dKilling the Thunderbirds, finding out the truth, destroying the evil Qi and stopping the tide of spirit beasts.This demon, which in the eyes of the world was a scourge to humans, had provided so much help to humans.\u201cIt is my duty to guard Huangyuan City, thank you for everything Shengzi Su has done, let me do the rest.\u201dWang Mao\u2019s expression was firm and fearless, \u201cI will burn my blood and destroy myself, and I will perish with that demon. I request that Shengzi Su protect the people in the city!\u201d.He already had a death wish!This was the territory of the Linlang Empire, how could outsiders be so arrogant!But Su Shi shook his head and said, \u201cI understand General Wang\u2019s feelings, but even if you burn your life, it won\u2019t help.\u201d\u201cThe demon embryo and the formation are one and the same, as long as the Blood Slaughter Formation is not broken, you won\u2019t be able to harm that demon embryo in any way.\u201dWang Mao\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of despair.He remembered that Su Shi said that this formation could not be broken at all.Could it be that after all they had done, in the end, they could only wait for death?\u201cThe reason we couldn\u2019t break the formation before was because we couldn\u2019t find the eye of the formation.\u201dSu Shi looked at the blood moon and said indifferently, \u201cNow the eye of the formation is right in front of us\u2026.\u201dHe slowly stepped into the air and swung against the red moonlight, \u201cEveryone, watch me pluck the stars and embrace the moon.\u201d\u201cSu Shi!\u201d\u201cSu Shi, you hurry back!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it, let me break the formation!\u201dThe women\u2019s hearts burned with anxiety.If they were under such pressure just by staying on the ground, how much more terrifying would it be to be in the eyes of the formation high in the sky?They wanted to fly to stop him, but they were trapped by Su Shi\u2019s formation.They were unable to break free because their own spiritual energy was almost depleted, so they could only watch as he took off into the air.Wang Mao looked at the white-clothed figure in a daze.\u201cShengzi Su \u2026\u2026\u201dOutside the formation.Yu Jiao Long saw this scene, and her indifferent eyes finally made a wave.Anyone can die, but Su Shi really can\u2019t die!Boom boom boom!Her spear shot out like a dragon, a silver spear carrying the laws of the Great Dao, pouring out like a storm.The blood-colored barrier trembled and fell.But this was a ten-year-old Tiger Clan formation, and it had already become one with the entire Huangyuan City.Even she couldn\u2019t forcibly destroy it in a short time.####Green Hill Plain.Yu Yuan\u2019s black robe fluttered in the wind.Looking at the blood light in the distant sky, he couldn\u2019t help but frown.\u201cGrind wheel, Refining \u2026\u2026 What kind of formation is this?\u201d\u201cWhat exactly does the Tiger clan want to do?\u201dHe felt a vaguely bad premonition in his heart.\u201cPatriarch, this is bad, this is bad!\u201dOne of the clan members ran over with surprising speed.Yu Yuan said in a deep voice, \u201cWhy are you panicking, what\u2019s going on?\u201dThe clan member looked terrified and said in a trembling voice, \u201cYoung Lady, Young Lady has disappeared!\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201dYu Yuan froze for a moment.Then she turned around and saw the city surrounded by blood in the distance.Thinking of his daughter\u2019s appearance last night, his heart suddenly raced.\u201cRen\u2019er she \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNot good!\u201dYu Yuan took a step, his body instantly disappeared!###Su Shi longitudinally flew towards the blood moon. The demon embryo looked terrible, his voice was sharp and piercing.\u201cIt\u2019s useless, the blood wheel will rotate, living things will be destroyed, you and others will become the meal of my body, chuckle!\u201dUnder the nourishment of blood essence, its face gradually became clear, and tiger stripes faintly appeared on its forehead.It can even speak human words!\u201cAlthough this formation only has 1/10 of its original strength, it is enough to hatch the embryo of this old demon.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that I won\u2019t be able to reach the supreme demon body.\u201dThe demon eyes were slightly resigned.He was the ancestor of the tiger clan, and his strength was feared by a hundred clans, but even so, he could not escape the cycle of life and death.As he was dying, he took a mouthful of demonic energy and used it to create a demonic embryo in an attempt to go against the will of the heavens.If his plan succeeded, he would not only be able to rise from the dead, but would also attain an immortal demon body!He would become a true supreme being!\u201cBlood evil energy is really insufficient, that bastard Qiu Hu!\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s enough, as long as I come back alive, it\u2019s not a complete failure.\u201dThe Demonic Embryo obviously didn\u2019t take Su Shi seriously.How could a mere Golden Elixir practitioner break through the Formation of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands of Blood Slaughter?Su Shi also ignored it.Because he knew that the demon embryo was not the key, and the only way to reverse the world was to destroy the formation!The closer he got to the formation, the greater the pressure became, as if the entire heaven and earth was pressing down on him.Su Shi\u2019s body shone with starlight.Clad in the starry sky, he flew towards the moon in the sky.When he saw that he was getting closer and closer to the blood moon, the demoni embryo finally realized that something was wrong.\u201cIs this the will of the star?\u201d\u201cHow can a mere Golden Elixir Realm practitioner master the intent of the stars?\u201dBefore it could react, Su Shi had already crashed into the blood moon!As if falling into an endless sea of blood, Su Shi was like a lone boat drifting with the waves.Countless cruel thoughts raged in his mind.Su Shi\u2019s eyes flushed red, his veins shot up, and he was filled with frenzied and tyrannical killing intent!The demon embryo laugh rang out, \u201cCackle, so you\u2019re a demon too?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t hold back, kill, kill all the living beings in this city, and reach the supreme heavenly demon with me!\u201dBuzz~There was a soft sound.Su Shi\u2019s body shone with golden light, and his eyes instantly regained their clarity.An unwanted golden body, breaking all distracting thoughts!\u201cDemon you say?\u201dSu Shi laughed coldly and said, \u201cUnderstand the Laws of Creation, rule over heaven and earth, do whatever you like, and replace heaven with yourself.\u201d\u201cThis is the way to become a demon!\u201d\u201cAs for you \u2026\u2026\u201d he looked cynical.\u201cBuried in the ground for ten years, you have to rely on human life to survive. Look at your ridiculous appearance, what\u2019s the difference between you and a maggot?\u201dThe demon embryo was furious and exasperated.\u201cHow dare you! I\u2019ll tear you apart with my own hands when I get my power back!\u201dSu Shi shook his head, \u201cUnfortunately, you don\u2019t have that opportunity.\u201d\u201cHeh, you\u2019re just a Golden Elixir-\u201cA demonic embryo expression froze before it could finish its words.A mysterious ancient seal appeared on Su Shi\u2019s body, and the sound of the Great Dao resounded throughout the world.He seemed to turn into a furnace, burning the boundless sea of blood to a boil!\u201cThe void was broken to reveal my true self.\u201d\u201cInfinite elements, Yin and Yang reversed!\u201dBoom!The sea of blood rolled back, and heaven and earth changed!In Huangyuan city.The people watched in awe as the blood moon shattered.Amidst the vast blood mist, the blazing sunlight faintly shone!Changing the sky, reversing Yin and Yang!Wang Mao\u2019s throat dried up, his lips opened and closed, \u201cShengzi Su\u2026\u2026 he really remove the moon.\u201d1. \u529f\u53c2\u9020\u5316 = luck, nature, heavenly ability, nature power.In cultivation novels this idiom usually means enlightenment, understanding the Law of Creation, understanding the mistrust of nature, the power of nature, etc.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 \u2013 Insulting Shengzi Su, seeking death!The blood moon broke.As if a balloon had burst, scarlet blood gas flew out and filled almost the entire sky.Amidst the blood mist, Su Shi turned into a furnace, his body shining brightly, like a blazing sun, emitting a searing light.The blood moon disappeared, and the scorching sun was in the sky.The pressure on people was reduced.The blood essence hanging in the air turned into blood rain and flowed down, returning to people\u2019s bodies.\u201cImpossible, this is absolutely impossible!\u201dThe demonic embryo let out a tremendous roar.Just a young man at the Golden Elixir Realm who was only twenty years old, how could he break this huge formation that had formed over ten years?Moreover, looking at his Mystical Ability, he was able to reverse Yin and Yang!The other party had clearly mastered the power of creation!That Demon Embryo couldn\u2019t understand.Only ten years had passed, yet the world was no longer as it knew it!The Blood Slaughter Formation slowly stopped rotating, and the blood light that enveloped the sky above Huangyuan City dimmed.A glimmer of sunlight broke through the dark clouds and fell on the Demon Embryo.\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201dDemon Embryo\u2019s body burst into flames, its black demon aura continued to dissipate, and its already ugly face became even more hideous!\u201cDamn it, aaaaah!\u201d\u201cI was so close, so close to coming back to life!\u201d\u201cI want you all to be buried with me!\u201dDemon Embryo roared, and its body surged.Its body was covered with cracks like spider webs, and a dark demonic light shot out from its body.\u201cNo, he\u2019ll blow himself up!\u201d\u201cSu Shi!\u201d\u201cBrother Su Shi is still in the sky!\u201dSeveral people struggled hard with their remaining strength and finally broke free of the formation.But now, the demon embryo had also risen to its limit.\u201cLet us die together.\u201dThe Demon Embryo smiled hideously.An indifferent voice sounded, \u201cThe only person who will die is you.\u201dClang!Silver light flashed.A long spear pierced through its body and nailed it directly to the ground.Yu Jiao Long flew down and stepped on the tip of the spear with her toe.The will of spear instantly shattered the demon embryo, not even giving it a chance to explode itself.\u201cQiu Hu, that bastard!\u201dThe demon embryo\u2019s eyes were filled with hatred.This formation had been prepared for ten years, yet it had been destroyed by a youngster at the Golden Elixir Realm!It had every chance of reaching the Supreme Demon Body!Yu Jiao Long said indifferently, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, soon the entire Tiger Clan will be buried with you.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dDemon Embryo\u2019s pupils shrank.Just as it was about to speak, its body exploded into bloody foam violently.Its head rolled away with fear and horror in its eyes!Tiger Clan is over!The huge formation stopped functioning and Su Shi\u2019s light disappeared around him.Reversing Yin and Yang had drained him completely, and his body was empty without a trace of spiritual energy.He fell helplessly from the clouds, the wind whistling in his ears, and his vision became blurry as he looked at the people running towards him.\u201cI\u2019m too tired.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s over, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHe closed his eyes slightly and lost consciousness completely.Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s body was like lightning, floating into the air and darting towards Su Shi.However, a black cloak was in front of her.\u201cBrat, didn\u2019t I tell you not to run around!\u201dLooking at the tragic state of the corpses around, Yu Yuan\u2019s eyebrows jumped wildly.What a mess!\u201cCome with me!\u201dYu Yuan grabbed Yu Ren\u2019er\u2019s neck collar.With all the commotion, the strongest people of the human race would arrive soon, and it was not right for them to stay here with their status.Yu Ren\u2019er said anxiously, \u201cFather, save him!\u201dYu Yuan looked at the fallen young man, and didn\u2019t have time to think too much, grabbed him with one hand, and his body disappeared instantly.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhere did he take him to?\u201dZhan Qingchen and the others all froze. They didn\u2019t even see Yu Yuan\u2019s movements.They only felt a flash of black light in front of their eyes, and Su Shi suddenly disappeared.Yu Jiao Long put away his silver spear and walked over, \u201cWhere is Su Shi? Why don\u2019t I see him?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, he was there just now.\u201dCen Yiren scratched her head.Yu Jiao Long\u2019s eyelids jumped, \u201cYou mean, Su Shi left?\u201dHer consciousness instantly covered the entire Huangyuan City, but there was no sign of Su Shi at all.It was as if he had vanished into thin air.Zhan Qingchen looked left and right and said, \u201cYu Ren\u2019er also left, she should have taken him away.\u201d\u201cWho is Yu Ren\u2019er?!\u201dYu Jiao Long was a little indignant.Chen Qingluan gritted her teeth, \u201cSo that bitch!\u201dYu Jiao Long: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe blood mist dissipated and sunlight broke through.The sun shone brightly again.The people in the city came out of their homes.There was no fear on their faces as they looked at the bloody scene before them, only the joy and emotion of life after a disaster.It was the darkest moment of their lives when the blood moon was in the sky.But fortunately for them, there was someone who cut through the thorns, to pierce the darkness, to face the torrents alone, to protect the 200,000 souls behind him.The figure that appeared in the sky was specially imprinted in everyone\u2019s hearts.They quietly cleared the streets, helped the wounded officers and soldiers to bandage their wounds, and helped the wounded into their homes to rest.Wang Mao\u2019s legs trembled and he fell to his knees.Huangyuan City was still here!The safe life and glory of mankind still exist!It is unknown how long it took, but there was a whistling sound in the distance, and a flying ship came quickly.The reinforcements of the Empire have arrived!The flying boats hung over the city and the officers and soldiers descended like a tidal wave.As soon as they disembarked, they were shocked by the scene before them.What kind of horrifying sight is this?Countless spirit beast corpses littered the streets, and as far as the eye could see, there were limbs and skeletons everywhere, blood almost reached the knees, and the stench of blood filled the nostrils.It was like hell on earth!General Yu Ze looked around in astonishment.What had happened to Huangyuan City?He saw Wang Mao sitting on his knees and walked over, \u201cGeneral Wang?\u201d\u201cGeneral Yu.\u201dWang Mao looked up, but didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of getting up.Yu Ze didn\u2019t think, said in a deep voice, \u201cWe received the news and rushed to support, but it seems that we are still one step too late \u2026\u2026 How about the casualties of the people in the city?\u201dHe had already prepared for the worst in his mind.\u201cNo one was injured or killed from the civilians.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dYu Ze froze for a moment.The corpses of the spirit beasts were boundless, but there were no casualties among the people?With only a few hundred officers and soldiers?How could this have happened!Wang Mao\u2019s voice was hoarse as he said, \u201cShengzi Su of the Netherworld Rakshasa Sect, who had discovered the outsiders\u2019 plot earlier, sweep a wave of spirit beasts with Chief Zhan and the others.\u201d\u201cIn the end, he even broke the formation with his own body and saved the entire city.\u201dYu Ze\u2019s eyebrows jumped, astonished, \u201cYou mean \u2026\u2026 Su Shi saved Huangyuan City?\u201dWang Mao nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dBefore Yu Ze spoke, the aide beside him sneered in a low voice, \u201cA man from the Demonic path, how can we trust him? I think this is a conspiracy from the Netherworld Sect-\u201cBefore he finished speaking, a sharp shot flashed by.Bang!The aide\u2019s head exploded like a watermelon!Yu Jiao Long drew her silver spear and said coldly, \u201cI\u2019m in a bad mood, so shut your mouth if you don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\u201cBlue Dragon of the East?!!!\u201dFacing a great enemy, Yu Ze and the soldiers behind him in unison drew their swords.But the next moment, they were surrounded!Zhan Qingchen, Chen Qingluan, officers and soldiers defending the city, and even ordinary people were among them!Everyone surrounded them with killing intent!Yu Ze gulped, \u201cGeneral Wang, this\u2026\u201dHow could these people be on the same side as the Demonic path?Wang Mao stood up with difficulty and said in a loud voice, \u201cShengzi Su is the hero who saved Huangyuan City!\u201d\u201cTo insult Shengzi Su is to dishonor humanity and the 200,000 souls living in this city!\u201d\u201cGeneral Yu, shut your mouth and the mouths of your subordinates, otherwise \u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWang Mao\u2019s sword was drawn and pointed directly at Yu Ze\u2019s throat, \u201cWe will kill you.\u201dLooking at the eyes around him, Yu Ze\u2019s scalp was slightly numb.Su Shi, what exactly had he done?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
