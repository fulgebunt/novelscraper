    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1At the end of June in 1970, the summer heat was scorching at noon. In the past, the members of Shanzui Village would be resting for a while, but today, they were all gathered in the yard of the brigade headquarters.There was a sharp shrill from the crowd, \u201cTell him that if he doesn\u2019t come back, [1] I will drink these pesticides and just let him collect my dead body!\u201d\u201cOh my gosh, did she really drink it?\u201d\u201cThe 1605 pesticide is very poisonous!\u201d\u201cAiyo, mother! There\u2019s a dead person! There\u2019s a dead person!\u201dThe crowd screamed, and the crowd became chaotic.The captain yelled, \u201cHis wife is already dead, Doctor Chijiao!\u201dThe party secretary glared at him and said: \u201cGo and send a telegram again. This is urgent!\u201d. . . . .Headache, dizziness, and thirst. These are Lin Lan\u2019s biggest feelings about having a hangover.Last night she was in a bad mood and drank two more glasses. She went back to her apartment and fell asleep. The nightmare kept going all night and constantly heard the sounds of calls and the door slamming in her ears.Unexpectedly, when she woke up, there was another buzzing sound in my ears that disturbed her dreams.\u201cSecond brother, do you think Mother really drank pesticides and died?\u201d\u201cShhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Keep it quiet. Mother is acting to scare them. She just wants Dad to come back home. Let\u2019s go cut grass.\u201dLin Lan tried her best to open her eyes, but her eyelids seemed to be stuck together by something, and she couldn\u2019t open them.After a while, there was another harsh voice, \u201cThe Third Eldest [2] is in the army. I\u2019ve seen her taking care of her five children, spending the whole day on her kids. She doesn\u2019t even help us out. If she doesn\u2019t want to live, she can just go back to her maternal home. No one even cares about her. It\u2019s not like she hung herself, she just drank some pesticides. This is just showing that she dislikes this mother-in-law, wanting to let me die first. Goodness, gracious! Never have I ever seen such a malicious daughter-in-law! You want to separate the family? Why don\u2019t you just get a rope and choke me to death? Stop poking her. Just go do whatever work you have to do. Don\u2019t try to be lazy!\u201dThen, there was the sound of the door slamming.What was this about drinking pesticides and separating the family?What a mess.Lin Lan had a splitting headache and almost exhausted all of her energy just to open her eyes.When she opened her eyes, she first saw the narrow and cramped room. She didn\u2019t see any windows, only a broken grass curtain hanging. The walls and roof were black and smokey, and the corners of the room were covered with black ash. There was an unpleasant smell mixed with various scents. Lin Lan couldn\u2019t tell whether it was animal feces or urine from the children as well as a moldy smell and some other kind of strange smell.This kind of environment was bound to make people unhappy and irritated.Lin Lan suddenly thought, \u201cDid I\u00a0cross over and transmigrate?Lin Lan waited for a long time with her eyes closed, and then opened her eyes. It was still the smoky yellow mud wall.At this moment, she was convinced that she had really crossed.The reason for this conclusion is that some information that did not belong to her had appeared in her mind, as if she had read a book or a movie, and was deeply engraved in her mind.She was in the 1970s of ancient China, Province D, a small village in the north of China, Shanzui Village.The original owner has the same name as her. Her maternal family was Lin Jia Village. Her husband\u2019s surname is Han, and her husband, Han Qingsong, is a soldier. The two have five children.The original owner had never gone to school and only attended a literacy class for a few days. She could not recognize more than fifty words. Since she was a child, she had been strong and violent. Her temper was not very good. She was ignorant and not cultured. When she encountered problems, she wouldn\u2019t calmly think of a solution. The most common method she used was making a fuss so when she went to her mother\u2019s house, she was not welcome.She was married to Han Qingsong at the age of 16. He was not at home all the time. She was suppressed by her mother-in-law and her sisters-in-law. She couldn\u2019t think of a way to resolve conflicts and to ease the relationship.Han Qingsong served as a soldier at the age of 17. After more than ten years of hard work, he is now a company commander.His future was promising.Because of this, the original owner was not at ease, always suspecting that he looked down on her and wanted to climb higher to have a better future.This was why\u00a0she kept making a fuss to make him go home to live so he wouldn\u2019t be hooked by those educated, young, and beautiful foxes outside.The reason why she drank the pesticides this time was because the original owner had heard some people discussing the news a demobilized soldier had brought back\u2014Han Qingsong had someone outside, and she was the daughter of a certain commander!Han Qingsong definitely wanted to talk with her about his desire to divorce her! This had become the last straw that crushed the camel. The original owner ran to the commune to telegraph the troops again and again. He had to change his job and go home. If he didn\u2019t go home, she would just die! And she would bring all five of their children to go die together.This matter was known by her mother-in-law, and she naturally disagreed. The good future of her son was the glory and financial support of the old Han family. If her son was brought back, wouldn\u2019t that be like going back to the liberation overnight? [3]This absolutely could not happen!Then the original asked her mother-in-law to give her man\u2019s salary to her. Otherwise, she would force her man to come home. If she didn\u2019t agree, she would drink pesticides!She asked her second son, Han Wangjun, to quietly pick up an empty 1605 bottle and return, thinking that there were no pesticides inside. When she poured the water in, she couldn\u2019t see any pesticides with water so she pretended to drink pesticides to scare them.Of course, there was also the meaning of making her family see how awesome she was.How could she have known that this 1605 is highly toxic, and if the liquid drops on the skin when the pesticides are sprayed, she will be poisoned? What\u2019s even worse is that she directly drank the pesticides with some water.Although she pretended to take a sip, it was enough to kill a woman with an unhealthy body all year round.Hence, Lin Lan was transmigrated over.In the original story, this time, the original had actually succeeded.Her husband, Han Qingsong\u00a0was frustrated by the trouble and had no intention of having an official career. He finally applied for a job change with the army and would go home in a few days.But even though he went home, this didn\u2019t make the family reconcile but opened the prelude to the tragedy.The original owner vowed that as long as the man returned home, she would live in peace, but when the man came back, she suspected again that the man looked down on her and suspected that he had an affair with other women. As long as he left her sight, she would wonder if he has a tryst with someone.The village\u2019s eldest unmarried women and even widows were part of her suspicions.As long as the man didn\u2019t follow what her heart wanted, she would make a lot of noise and threaten to kill herself.Han Qingsong became the director of the commune public security bureau after he changed his job and was later promoted to the deputy director of the county public security bureau. At that time, the Cultural Revolution was coming to an end so control was loosened. Some public servants didn\u2019t follow the law so public security in the county became more and more chaotic.He was busy with official duties and was troubled internally and externally. Finally, after she made a big fuss, he was physically and mentally exhausted and was stabbed to death in the process of performing official duties.After his death, she became even more twisted. She resented her children and used them to vent her anger, but she would also shield her children\u2019s shortcomings and spoil her children. She raised them all into wastes, and in the end, none of them had a good death.Wait for a second!***\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Lin Lan suddenly realized that this familiar plot seemed like a novel she had read a long time ago. The male and female protagonists in the book are childhood sweethearts and were busy making a fortune for a well-off life. The female partner is impressive because of her natural style. She is the daughter of the original owner, Han Maisui, with a pretty, youthful, and lively personality. Since childhood, she has been raised by the original owner to be more vain and vain. She always feels that she is a princess, and she wants what she wants. Anyone that is not good to her is a bad person. The original owner helped her daughter devote herself to pestering the male protagonist, and several of her sons were also crooked and did not have good endings in the end.The fundamental reason is inseparable from this twisted family.She actually transmigrated into this kind of home\u2026What should she do?Going back? That\u2019s impossible.Running away from home? Getting a divorce?No one gets divorced during this time period. If she just divorces herself,\u00a0 her maternal family probably wouldn\u2019t want her. It is impossible for a divorced woman to return to her maternal family in this era. This time period was just this feudal.And at this time, she couldn\u2019t go anywhere without her household registration, work points, or letter of introduction. She can\u2019t find a job. She can\u2019t make money. Eating a meal has even become a problem. She can barely even survive. It seems like she can only live as the original owner\u2019s identity.The only problem was if she suddenly stopped being evil and became a nice person. Who knew if people would become suspicious? But even if people became suspicious, she really couldn\u2019t live her life the same way as the original owner did.She suddenly came up with an idea. She can use this disaster to survive. Suddenly she thought of an idea and was no longer disheartened. She could use the reason of no longer wanting to entangle the past to have a steady life. [4]En,\u00a0not bad!But it was because her mother-in-law who suppressed her husband so he had no affection for her. This wasn\u2019t an urgent thing. She still had many ways to pass the days.For her, the scariest thing is\u2026Notes[1] I will drink these pesticides \u2013 Pesticides can also be translated to farming chemicals. This is highly toxic and poisonous to the human body and can cause death.[2] Third Eldest \u2013 In Chinese, they will refer to children by the order in which they are born.[3] Liberation \u2013 I didn\u2019t quite understand this sentence. Here\u2019s what it is in Chinese.\u00a0\u8981\u662f\u628a\u513f\u5b50\u5f04\u56de\u6765\uff0c\u90a3\u4e0d\u662f\u8981\u4e00\u591c\u56de\u5230\u89e3\u653e\u524d? The first part is definitely \u201cif she was to bring her son back\u201d. The part I don\u2019t get is\u00a0\u89e3\u653e. The definition of this word is liberation or emancipation. If anyone knows how to translate this, feel free to leave a comment below to help me out.[4] I found this small paragraph a bit hard to translate into English. Basically, she thought of an excuse/reason as to why she became nice and stopped being mean in case people became suspicious of why her personality had such a big change. She said that she would use this incident of drinking pesticides and not dying as the reason for not wanting to keep mentioning the past and to live a steady life.Translator\u2019s Note: This novel seems to fit with the kind of novel that I\u2019m currently interested in. I found the original owner to be quite stupid and annoying, but I\u2019m excited to read how Lin Lan will adapt to her situation.

    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Those five children!The most terrifying thing in her whole life is children. In her limited interaction with kids in her past, most of them are bear children [1].The most feared thing in her life is the child. In her limited experience with children, most of them are bear children.For example, her colleague\u2019s six-year-old daughter would always want her to buy stuff for her whenever she entered the office. She would continue to act cute and look for opportunities to hug her and pull on her earrings and necklace to tell her that she wants to wear it but would also beg her to not tell her mother.If it was only once or twice, she would just let it go, but after a few times,\u00a0she finally couldn\u2019t help telling her colleague. The colleague apologized in front of her, saying that her child was ignorant and not sensible but turned around and complained to her colleagues behind her back that she was stingy and unloving and was too harsh on the child.There were also the children of her own relatives and her younger brothers\u2019 kids. Every time they went to her house, they would go through the place like bandits. If she didn\u2019t put away her cosmetics, jewelry, and electronics in advance, it would be a disaster. Thousands of skincare products and cosmetics would be spread around all over the place.Not to mention that when she got angry, even if she didn\u2019t smile and say that it was okay, her relatives would complain to her mother, \u201cWhy is Lan Lan getting more and more stingy, lowering herself to the same level as a child. When a girl becomes old enough, she has to quickly get married and have children, or she\u2019ll just become an old antique with a perverted character.\u201dEven if her thousands of skincare products and cosmetics were ruined by her nieces and nephews, her mother would scold her several times. In the end, she bought a house by herself instead of leaving the money to her brother to buy a house for his wedding and then developed to the point that she would not get married or have children.\u201cYou don\u2019t have children anyway. Won\u2019t this house and money become theirs in the future? What\u2019s wrong with giving it to them now? Don\u2019t give it to outsiders. Don\u2019t waste it.\u201dIn short, she is afraid of marriage, afraid of children, afraid of being a mother. She doesn\u2019t want children who are like little devils, and she doesn\u2019t want to be a mother like her own mother.She made up her mind to stay single for the rest of her life, not to harm or be harmed by others.Now that she has worked hard for ten years and has achieved success in her career and life, why does she need to find a man to give birth to a child who would reduce her quality of life?Who knows why, but god didn\u2019t want her to live comfortably so he actually let her transmigrate into a shrew [2], with five bear children and a wooden husband [3]!She thought to herself, \u201cI can\u2019t live this kind of life!\u201d.She closed her eyes tightly, wondering if she could transmigrate back again. Maybe this was a dream?At this time, a child\u2019s timid cry came from her ear. \u201cMother\u2026dead\u2026dead\u2026\u201d A little hand groped around her face and neck. It wasn\u2019t a lightweight and pressed so hard that her eyes and neck hurt and her breath was uneven.Lin Lan had to open her eyes and pull the little, black hand away, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dAfter speaking, she regretted it. Her tone was too fierce and might\u2019ve scared the child.But the little child didn\u2019t care, staring at her with a pair of big eyes, scared that she was really dead.Although Lin Lan didn\u2019t like children, she also admitted that the little child had very beautiful big eyes which were shining in the dark, but he was too thin. Adding on to the fact that no one took care of them, and his body looked very dirty.This is Wang Wang, the youngest son of the original owner, who is 4 years old. He had a lazy eye, was weak-sighted, was introverted,\u00a0and felt excessively inferior because he was born prematurely. The original owner dislikes him very much, thinking that he is a little blind, a fool, and a burden.Lin Lan didn\u2019t think he was stupid. How could a fool\u2019s eyes be so focused and bright?\u201cMother, eat.\u201d He stretched over his dark little hand which held a piece of melted, sticky candy.It looked dirty and made Lin Lan feel a bit nauseous.But she couldn\u2019t bear to be angry with him. After all, her own transmigration was a very mysterious issue, and it had nothing to do with him.She closed her eyes and said, \u201cYou eat it by yourself. Don\u2019t touch me.\u201dThe sticky, little black hands made her so nervous and sweaty.The child was very afraid of her. He shrank to one side and did not dare to touch her anymore, but his eyes were stuck on his mother in fear that his mother would die like others said.Kid\u2026Lin Lan sighed. Having her raise five children is simply an impossible task.She closed her eyes and went through the lives of her five cheap children. She quickly broke into a cold sweat. The original owner was really good enough to raise these\u00a0children into the story\u2019s big villains.Lin Lan was silent for a long time, feeling that although she was not afraid to live as the original owner, she did not have the courage to manage the five children.Their future is seriously too . . . Once she enters the role, she has to bear the responsibility of correcting them and guiding them on the right path.Oh my god, she\u2019s most afraid of children, okay!Even if the cute, little angel is afraid of her, she could suddenly enter hell mode!She is also convinced by this luck.She was thinking about it, and hearing a 'squeak\u201d, someone stomped in.\u201cMother, I caught a big crucian carp. It\u2019s so big!\u201d A sturdy boy rushed in and danced excitedly, \u201cMother, guess how I caught it? When I was drinking water, I grabbed it with my hand. Yes, haha!\u201dLin Lan reluctantly opened her eyes and looked at him. This is the third son. Seeing that he was wearing only a pair of shorts, his body was tanned, and only the whites of his eyes and teeth were shining in the dim room which was especially funny.This Sanwang [4], ever since he learned to swim in the river at the age of three, he has fallen in love with the water. Unless the river freezes and cannot be entered, the rest of the time he would secretly go swim.But as the old saying goes, drowning is caused by being able to swim [5], and later on, this kid ended up drowning.Ai\u2026 Lin Lan sighed.Sanwang was puzzled, \u201cMother, what\u2019s wrong with you? Are you still unhappy with a fish this big?\u201d\u201cSanwang!\u201d Another boy walked in from the outside, closed the door and walked to the edge of the kang, and whispered, \u201cMother, Sanwang, this silly boy. If it wasn\u2019t for me pulling him along, he would\u2019ve just wanted to send the fish to the main room.\u201d He pushed Sanwang\u2019s head,\u00a0 \u201cStupid!\u201dSanwang was indignant and pouted, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t push my head!\u201d\u201cMother, are you feeling better now? I\u2019m going to go make some fish soup for you to drink. Or else, grandmother would send the fish to my aunt and uncle to eat. Today, she asked the eldest brother and eldest sister to deliver the chicken eggs and forced eldest sister to wash Aunt\u2019s clothes. She\u2019s really too biased!\u201dLin Lan glanced at him. This is Erwang. He has been very shrewd and astute since he was a child. He is more mindful than other children, has a small mouth and is good at coaxing people, and is even more similar to the original owner\u2019s little padded jacket than her daughter is. However, hearing unpleasant words is just having a glib mouth and being honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted. Anyway, when he grows older, he will rely on his mouth to walk around the world, and eventually, in the end, his big mouth would cause bad things to happen.Right now, these children are still small. All of them are innocent. Even if they are crooked, they aren\u2019t really crooked yet. They have to wait for Han Qingsong to die, and then, they will really become evil.Lin Lan wondered if she started to guide them now, she would be able to lead them the right way to avoid those tragic endings, right?Ai, there is a long way to go.At this time, old lady Han\u2019s harsh voice came from the main room, and the loud voice was clearly scolding her on purpose.Lin Lan frowned. Although the original owner was wrong, the old lady\u2019s butt was too biased and treated the original owner too badly.She stopped the idea of having Erwang to send the fish to the main room. After all, she was a bitch and an old lady. If she knew how to respect the elders, she would frighten them.She said: \u201cErwang, take your brothers outside to grill fish to eat.\u201dIt is common for the children to make a fire-grilled sweet potato at the bottom of a bridge or at nooks and crannies. The original owner used to steal things and take the children to eat outside.\u201cOkay, Mother. Wait until it\u2019s done grilling and I\u2019ll bring it back to let you eat.\u201d Erwang said this while he greeted Sanwang and ran out, ignoring Xiaowang who was huddled in the corner on the kang.This poor child, everyone ignored him.Lin Lan also knows that Erwang was just saying nice words to hear, and the fish won\u2019t be brought back. Most of it will go into his own stomach. If Sanwang could eat two bites, that would already be pretty good.. . . . .Regiment Command Headquarters at a certain military station in Province D.Regiment Commander Chen looked at Han Qingsong in front of him, and in a blink of an eye, ten years had passed, and the young recruit egg had become a company commander. More than a decade of working in the military made his handsome face no longer tender, but his posture is still upright and strong, and his momentum is calm and concise.Although this person is not good with words, he is outstanding in his profession, loyal and keen, and has a bright future.And now he says he wants to change jobs? The brain is kicked by the donkey! [6]\u201cHan Qingsong, you have become a regular worker, and our division will set up a top team in the coming year. The headquarters has decided to appoint you as the captain of the special training. Now you have to change your career? You have to think clearly!\u201dWho knows how many people have their eyes on this position\u00a0and there are many people who tried their best to get this position.Han Qing pressed the corners of his lips tightly and stopped talking, clenched his fists, and nodded for a moment.There are very few ordinary rural conscripts who can make it to his military position. As long as there is a little bit of hope, no one is willing to demobilize and change jobs. Not only do his comrades do not understand, but even his old company commander is also puzzled, so he immediately looked for him for an explanation.But he didn\u2019t want to explain too much.Although he has shown a lot of talent through these years, there was also the price of blood. In particular, he has suffered two serious injuries. It is a blessing for him to be alive. With his current physical fitness, going to the special training team will actually affect the training.The most important thing is: Now that he has to make a choice between his family and his career\u2026 he doesn\u2019t want to go back on his word.After more than ten years away, every time he visits relatives for a few days, he has no time and energy to fulfill his duties as a husband and father. Therefore, he is responsible for the current situation in the family.His wife was seeking death and even threatened to take the children to jump into the river. Although he knew she was threatening him with her old tricks, he was tired.He didn\u2019t want to keep doing this over and over again.He had repeatedly promised her that he would apply for his family to join the army in the coming year and let her and the children follow.She clearly agreed as well, but now she has changed her mind again, and as long as she makes trouble, there will be a lot of drama. Jumping into the river and drinking pesticides will not make her give up when she is upset.After careful consideration, he decided to go home and live with his wife and children.Regiment Commander Chen knew that Han Qingsong was a boring gourd and wouldn\u2019t speak. He had offended many people for this He couldn\u2019t pull back the things he was looking for, and it would be useless for anyone to persuade him.He said, \u201cYou are allowed to visit your family for half a month. Go home and take care of your housework\u201dWhen Han Qingsong returned to the dormitory, he received another telegram from home, which was different from the previous telegrams that asked him to return quickly, seek death, or he would not be allowed to return.This one is for him to divorce his wife quickly!Notes:[1] bear children \u2013 In Chinese, it says\u00a0\u591a\u534a\u90fd\u662f\u718a\u5b69\u5b50 which translates directly as \u201cmost of them are bear children\u201d. This means that children are wild and similar to bears. Personally, I find this term kind of cute and I have a feeling this will be showing up a lot in the future so I will continue translating it as bear children.[2] a shrew \u2013 The Chinese is\u00a0\u6cfc\u5987. It directly translates to a shrew, but I feel like this translation is a bit insufficient. It refers to the animal, the shrew. This word is also part of the title. In the title, I wrote \u201cShrewish Wife\u201d because it wouldn\u2019t make a lot of sense if it said, \u201cShrew of the Seventies Manages the Household\u201d. Shrews are highly aggressive. When used to describe a woman, it can be understood as a woman with a violent, scolding, or nagging temperament.[3] wooden husband \u2013 This means that her husband is cold, straightforward, and stiff, like wood. Most of the time, these kinds of husbands don\u2019t know how to show affection or be romantic.[4] Sanwang \u2013 This refers to the third child. I\u2019m not sure if this is really the third child\u2019s name or if it\u2019s more of a nickname. The eldest/first-born child will probably be Dawang, the second-born child is Erwang, the third-born child is Sanwang, the fourth-born child Siwang, and the fifth-born child is Xiaowang.\u00a0 Should I write it as San Wang or Sanwang? Which one do you guys prefer? Lin Lan is the character\u2019s full name; Lin is her last name and Lan is her first name.[5] drowning is caused by being able to swim \u2013 I\u2019m not 100% sure that I translated this part correctly. This is the Chinese.\u00a0\u00a0\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4fd7\u8bdd\u8bf4\u6df9\u6b7b\u4f1a\u6c34\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c0f\u5b50\u540e\u6765\u6b63\u662f\u88ab\u6df9\u6b7b\u7684[6] The brain is kicked by the donkey \u2013 This is a Chinese idiom. I think it means, \u201cAre you stupid? Did you get your brain kicked by a donkey?\u201d.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Although she didn\u2019t directly drink pesticides, this 1605 is a highly toxic pesticide. Even if she sipped a little with a bottle of water, it is still enough to kill someone.Lin Lan only felt dizzy, ringing in her ears, and nausea. She prayed that the poison didn\u2019t damage her liver, kidneys, and nerves.After lying down for a long time, she didn\u2019t feel so uncomfortable anymore so she wanted to move around.The room was narrow and dark, and she almost tripped when she put her feet on the ground. Seeing that the broken grass curtain made the room dark and unventilated, she tore it off.Xiaowang on the kang thought she was going to lose her temper again and shrank into the corner in fright.Lin Lan strolled for two steps, and her chest felt tight and suffocated. She wanted to drink some water and then remembered that the earthen jar and bowl had been broken by the original owner.She wanted to go to the hall to pour water to drink, but she was too weak and exhausted so she had to go back to the kang and sit down.At this moment, Erwang came back. He put a leaf bag on the kang which had a few pieces of the grilled fish and two turtles.Erwang grinned, \u201cMother, the fish has already been eaten by Sanwang. I am unwilling to eat it so I left it for you.\u201dLin Lan knew it well, and glanced at him, \u201cErwang, your father is not at home. It is not easy for us to live each day. It is not a big deal to eat more and eat less. You can\u2019t lie to your mother and play tricks.Erwang smiled and said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, mother. I have never lied to you before.\u201dLin Lan just asked him to pour a bowl of water for her to drink.Soon Erwang slipped back with the water and whispered: \u201cMother, it\u2019s terrible. Grandfather and the others are hiding in the house, holding a meeting to decide how to deal with you.\u201dLin Lan had already heard vague sounds from the main room before, mixed with the old lady\u2019s cursing, and guessed they were discussing how to deal with the original owner.She took the bowl, realized that the rim of the bowl was sticky, and she suddenly felt nauseous. When she brought the bowl to her mouth, she smelled a strange smell in the water, and she didn\u2019t feel like drinking it anymore.She remembered that there was very little oil and water at home.\u00a0Even if there is no detergent, this bowl should not be so dirty.She endured the nausea and took a sip, thinking that in the future, she definitely had to keep the house nice and clean and not be this disgusting.\u201cDid your grandmother say she wants to drive me back to my maternal family?\u201dErwang was surprised: \u201cMother, how did you know?\u201dFrom where they were, they couldn\u2019t hear anything that they were saying.Lin Lan snorted, \u201cI just guessed.\u201dEr Wang looked at her, thinking that in the next moment, his mother would roll up her sleeves and rush over to make a fuss, and then subconsciously moved to the side to avoid being affected.Lin Lan didn\u2019t move like Erwang thought she would. Lin Lan put the bowl down, and asked, \u201cWhere is Sanwang?\u201d\u201cHe was being lazy while cutting the grass and went to the river again. Mother, wait till he comes back and I\u2019ll punish him for you.\u201d Erwang looked like a good older brother.Lin Lan glanced at him, \u201cGo to the hall to listen to what they say, and then come back and tell me.\u201dErwang immediately went out, and Xiaowang in the corner crawled forward and said,\u00a0 \u201d . . . to drive the Lin family out and split the family.\u201dLin Lan looked at him curiously, and then remembered that although Xiao Wang has a lazy eye, his hearing is better than ordinary people\u2019s, but later on, the original owner became more and more twisted. She used him to vent her anger and despised him. Since then, he had become a severely autistic patient.At this moment, he was still a normal child. He just to spoke a little later than others.Because the children call him a little blind boy and a little stupid boy, he became even less talkative, and there was no one to protect him so he naturally became more and more autistic.Lin Lan waved at him. Xiao Wang didn\u2019t respond, she had to say: \u201cXiao Wang, come here.\u201dXiao Wang crawled to her side.Lin Lan coaxed him in a soft voice, \u201cWhat did you hear them say? Tell your mother everything.\u201dAt first, Xiaowang could only say a few words. Under Lin Lan\u2019s guidance, he was slowly able to say a whole sentence.Through Xiaowang\u2019s broken vocabulary, what they were saying was the same as what Lin Lan guessed.After a while, Er Wang returned to report what he heard which confirmed Lin Lan\u2019s guess.Sure enough, the old lady first said that she wanted her son to come back and divorce her, and she had already sent a telegram to Han Qingsong. The old man disagreed. He felt that they had already been in-laws for so many years, and it wasn\u2019t okay to be so cold. It didn\u2019t look good, and it made their family lose face. They also supported separating the family. It seems that the eldest brother and eldest sister-in-law\u2019s family agree with separating the family. After all, the husband and wife together were the main laborers in the family and worked the hardest. But second brother and second sister-in-law disagreed. This was probably because they wanted to spend Han Qingsong\u2019s money but also wanted their eldest brother and eldest sister-in-law to do more work so they could relax.\u201cWhat my grandmother means is that my father\u2019s allowance should be given to her to hold onto, not a cent given to Mother. She doesn\u2019t even think of giving us a couple of points. She said that besides a few rations left, there was nothing else, and they needed to earn their own work points to eat.\u201d Erwang said angrily, \u201cMother, you say, how can they be so low, keeping Father\u2019s allowance and not giving it to you. And they still want us to earn our own work points for our meals? Aren\u2019t eldest uncle and second uncle are both at home earning work points? Why don\u2019t they go out and earn their own money to spend?\u201dLin Lan motioned to him to calm down, \u201cYour father will come back in a few days and talk about it.\u201dErwang looked at her in surprise, why didn\u2019t my mother bother? Momma and they all said they were going to kick her out, why didn\u2019t she fight?\u201cMother, they want to drive us out!\u201dLin Lan said, \u201cI know, I won\u2019t let them succeed.\u201dSeparating the family is fine, but how can you keep the money earned by the Third branch [1] but kick out the Third branch\u2019s wife and children?No way!Erwang stared at Lin Lan as if he didn\u2019t recognize her.Lin Lan touched Xiaowang, smiled approvingly, and praised him, \u201cXiaowang is awesome! What you just said is almost the same as what your brother said.\u201dMother praised him!She praised him like she praised his sister and brother!Xiaowang looked up at her with wide eyes, trying to see her face clearly.Seeing that the child was so excited that he was about to faint, Lin Lan quickly rubbed his head again. He seemed to like her touch a lot, and the furry head rubbed her hand like sunflowers look for the sun.Inexplicably, Lin Lan had a feeling of deja vu. She was frightened and withdrew her hand quickly.Xiao Wang felt his mother\u2019s disgust, the light in his eyes dimmed again, and the whole body shrank back down again.Lin Lan\u2019s heart felt a bit sour. She didn\u2019t. have the heart to bear it and smiled. She turned to the window with her face, motioning to go there to listen.Xiaowang thought that his mother was playing games with him, and his eyes were shining with joy.He crawled down the kang. Although his eyesight was not good, he was familiar with the environment around him, and he didn\u2019t bump into it. He stepped on a small tree stump bench to eavesdrop from the window.Erwang was dumbfounded. What\u2019s wrong with Mother?Although he thought it was strange, he didn\u2019t want to be left behind so he ran outside again to eavesdrop.Just now, his mother actually praised that little fool and didn\u2019t praise him for what he said. He can\u2019t be left behind.Lin Lan hugged Xiaowang and listened for a while. Even though she was a chill person, everything that she heard made her angry. The old lady Han is really good enough. It was wrong to take the initiative to make a fuss and look for death, but the old lady is not much better. She was probably on par with the original owner.Not to mention anything else, the money Han Qingsong earned. The old lady only gave good things to her younger son and daughter. They were obviously the sons and daughters of two poor and middle peasants, but she had to be the same as the young masters of the landlord\u2019s family. But the children in the family qre so young that they can\u2019t go to school. They all have to cut grass, pick up dung, and go to the fields to earn work points. Everyone is dark and thin. She who doesn\u2019t like children even feels bad for them.No matter how bad the original owner was, how could she not feel bad for her children? Of course she wants to earn money to improve the lives of my children.She had an idea right now and said a few words to Xiaowang, \u201cDo you know what you have to do?\u201dXiaowang nodded, \u201cMother, I know what I have to do.\u201dLin Lan brought him down, \u201cWait until they have left and then go.\u201d She smoothly took out a wooden stick.Xiaowang was so frightened that he immediately hid in the corner, thinking that his mother was going to hit him again.Lin Lan hurriedly said: \u201cXiaowang, Mother is giving this to you to use so you won\u2019t run into anything when you walk.\u201dXiaowang\u2019s eyesight is not good. Staying all day was not good for him. In the future, she wouldn\u2019t be able to watch over him all the time so she needed to let him practice walking around by himself.If she had money, she would first take Xiaowang to go get his eyes checked and get treatment early. Maybe his eyes could be fixed to a certain extent.Xiao Wang just laughed, \u201cOkay, Mother.\u201d He used the wooden stick to find his way out.Lin Lan greeted Erwang when he came back again and said a few words.Erwang hesitated, \u201cMother, we are stuck with grandmother. Don\u2019t you already know that?\u201dLin Lan said: \u201cAfter the separation, you don\u2019t want to follow your mother? Do you want to follow your grandmother?\u201dEr Wang immediately shook his head, \u201cOf course, I will follow Mother. My eldest brother will definitely want to follow Grandmother and abandon Mother, but I am not like this.\u201dLin Lan said: \u201cYour eldest brother will not abandon Mother. Your eldest brother is a man, and he knows how to protect your mother and you guys after our families separate. Go ahead.After the meeting in the main house was over, the men left the house, and the women stayed at home to cook, Er Wang and Xiao Wang went to the main house as Lin Lan ordered.Sister-in-law Han and the old lady went to the vegetable garden. Sister-in-law Han was cooking, and there were many children in the family. As long as she made sure the kids didn\u2019t fall and get hurt, everything would be fine, and she didn\u2019t have to care a lot.Soon, Erwang took something, headed back to the east wing and handed it to Lin Lan. \u201cMother!\u201dThis is Lin Lan and Han Qingsong\u2019s marriage certificate, similar to a primary school student\u2019s certificate, with one-inch photos of the two people.Lin Lan above was young and pretty with a bit shy and bold gaze. Han Qingsong next to her was dressed in a military uniform, sitting upright and handsome. They matched each other quite well.It\u2019s just that there are a few small holes in Lin Lan\u2019s photo which look like she was stabbed by a needle.Originally, having their own marriage certificate in their own house was good enough, but old lady Han insisted on putting her son\u2019s marriage certificate in her own house, saying that it was as nice as a painting and looked good.Lin Lan rolled up the marriage certificate and said with a smile: \u201cErwang, Mother promises you that after the separation, your mother will let you have a good life, and let you eat noodles made with white flour, eat meat, eat sugar, and go to school!\u201dNotes:[1] Third branch \u2013 Lin Lan\u2019s husband is the third son of the family so his family is considered the Third branch. For the first son, the eldest brother, his family is the First branch. For the third son, his family is the Third branch.\u00a0The Chinese is \u4e09\u623f (san fang) which directly translates as \u201cthird room\u201d, but Third branch seems to make more sense in English.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4During dinner time, the whole family came back, but Dawang and the Mai Sui brother and sister pair did not come home.Right now the security was pretty safe. There aren\u2019t a lot of kidnappings on the road, and there is only one road from Shanzui Village to the town. It\u2019s hard to get lost. The 11-year-old boy is leading his 9-year-old sister so there is nothing for the adults to be worried about.Lin Lan was actually a little worried. She wasn\u2019t worried about their safety, but she was worried about Dawang and the two Mai Sui children. They went to town with their younger aunt and younger uncle and they would not learn anything good from following their youngest uncle and aunt.In the future, she has to find a way to make her children stay farther away from their youngest uncle and aunt.Because her sister-in-law and brother-in-law were Mrs. Han (old lady Han) children who she gave birth to at a late age, they were extremely spoiled and precious to her. The family reluctantly gave up food and clothing and were frugal in order to save food and cloth tickets for them to attend high school.Her brother-in-law spent all day outside like a rich, young master, drinking and eating meat at restaurants.Her sister-in-law, like a landlord\u2019s family\u2019s young lady [2], did not even put her fingers in the spring water. She was raised white and fat, and her niece was sent to wash her clothes.After not seeing each other for ten days and a half months, the old lady still feels like she has wronged them.The money they spend is all earned by Han Qingsong, but Han Qingsong\u2019s children spend less than a cent, and it wasn\u2019t the original owner\u2019s fault.Lin Lan cleaned up and took Xiaowang\u2019s hand to go eat.The Han\u2019s eldest sister-in-law was busy working in the hall, and when she saw her coming out, she greeted her with a smile as if nothing had happened. \u201cDawang\u2019s mother, you\u2019re probably hungry already. Come and eat.\u201dThe Han\u2019s second sister-in-law glanced at Lin Lan and sarcastically said: \u201cOh, I say the third family, your life so good that you can spend all day laying around doing nothing. When you wake up, there\u2019s already someone to serve you food, just like a landlord\u2019s wife [2].Lin Lan ignored her, greeted the eldest sister-in-law, took Xiao Wang to get water to wash her hands. \u201cWhy are my little hands so dark\u2026\u201d Before she finished speaking, she felt that her voice was too soft, not in line with the original host\u2019s savage and rude image. Then let go of his voice, \u201cWash your hands frequently to avoid diarrhea.\u201dXiao Wang squatted down obediently and put his dirty hands covered with scars in the black crockpot to rinse them out and rubbed them against his clothes even though they were drenched in water.Lin Lan frowned and hurriedly caught his hand and had no choice but to squat down and wash him clean while teaching him how to wash his hands.\u201cYou got it?\u201dXiaowang nodded.Lin Lan led him into the house for dinner.The Han\u2019s second sister-in-law looked at her as if she was a stranger. She said that so she would jump up and beat her. Why didn\u2019t she respond as if she was deaf?Lin Lan lay down all morning and all afternoon, and did not go to work, but the Han\u2019s second sister-in-law was arranged to do more work, and she was very unhappy. She wanted to run Lin Lan to make her jump and make trouble so she would definitely rush back to her maternal family which would anger her mother-in-law.How would she know that Lin Lan would ignore her!This was too abnormal.Lin Lan led Xiao Wang into the house, and the others immediately stared at them. Xiao Wang got scared so he hid behind Lin Lan.Lin Lan also found that he was very resistant to leaving the room that they lived in, being in front of people, and talking in front of them. If she didn\u2019t help him out in time, after a long time, he would have a very serious autism, and even his mother would be shut out from his heart.Fortunately, he is still looking for love and affection from his mother, and he isn\u2019t very sick.She subconsciously softened her voice, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Xiaowang. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d She abruptly swallowed the phrase, \u201cThis is all a family\u201d, trying not to say words that would ruin the peace.Even so, everyone in the room looked at her as if she was an aliens\u2014the original owner hadn\u2019t spoken like this normally in many years. As long as she opened her mouth, either cursing or coldly sneering and laughing.Sister Han couldn\u2019t hold back, and said in surprise: \u201cDa Wang\u2019s mother is . . . what\u2019s wrong?\u201dWhy did was it similar to a blind date where the unmarried woman is shameless and still speaks gently and kindly.Lin Lan tried to make herself sound a bit ruder, dragged a small bench to sit down, took a pancake, broke it apart, and gave Xiaowang a piece. She then said, \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. I just saw the gate of death and chatted with Yama, King of Hell. I\u2019ve seen through it.Because they believed in ghosts and gods, the ignorant people easily believed what she said.Moreover, it wasn\u2019t impossible that she had met the gate of death and her temperament changed drastically.Anyway, she wouldn\u2019t explain. Whatever they made up themselves doesn\u2019t matter.Although the Han family has enough food to be full, the food is not that great. It is nothing more than cornmeal pancakes, boiled sweet potatoes, pickles, soy sauce, onion, garlic and so on. There are vegetables in the summer and autumn vegetable garden, and there is also salt water for cooking. There wasn\u2019t a lot of meat.But compared to those who don\u2019t have enough to eat and drink three times a day, this is quite good.After taking a bite, Lin Lan almost spit it out. It was bitter and rough. How could this go down her throat?What a terrible taste!When she is in charge of her own home, she must eat fine noodles and meat dishes!Everyone at the full table was watching her and Xiaowang eat so intensely that they forgot to eat themselves.Second sister-in-law Han couldn\u2019t help but continue to provoke, \u201cThird family, do the pesticides taste good? What\u2019s the flavor like?\u201dLin Lan snorted, \u201cYou want to drink it that badly? If you just try it yourself, won\u2019t you know how it tastes.\u201dThe second sister-in-law Han was immediately unhappy. \u201cThird family, how can you say something like that?\u201dLin Lan finally swallowed the pancake stuck in her throat and deliberately ignored her. \u201cI heard that I\u2019m going to be driven back to my parents\u2019 house?\u201dEldest sister-in-law immediately got on guard, for fear that the third family would lift the dining table up. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like that going on. Dawang\u2019s mother, don\u2019t worry.\u201dThe others also looked at Lin Lan nervously.Lin Lan smiled and turned to look, \u201cErwang and Sanwang, these two preserved eggs [3], where did they go now?\u201dThey were still at home a few moments ago. In a blink of an eye, they weren\u2019t there anymore. They really are naughty boys who couldn\u2019t obediently stay at home.A few adults almost choked like their breath had turned into stone. If you have something to say, just finish saying it. Why do you have change the subject?The Han\u2019s second sister-in-law snorted and said, \u201cWho knows . . . You spend all day not cutting the grass and not earning work points. You only know how to be rude. Da Zhuang and Da Tian all . . .\u201d\u201cSeparating the family, right?\u201d Lin Lan nodded, \u201cSeparating the family is good!\u201dThe Han\u2019s second sister-in-law, \u201c\u2026\u201dDid this shrew really go to the King of Hell, Yama? Why was it so irritating!The old lady Han knocked the chopsticks on the table, \u201cI\u2019m going to say some ugly things. We are a big family. We aren\u2019t like those kinds of family who don\u2019t understand rules and talk nonsense. If we want to separate the family, besides your own rations for each person. After we split the family, you guys have to earn your own work points, take care of your own children and their food, I . . .\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. They still have a father.\u201d Lin Lan looked nonchalant.Han Qingsong is coming back anyway.The old lady Han was interrupted, and her breath suddenly stagnated.Although the original author could be noisy, but to be honest, it didn\u2019t matter if it was asking for money, having her man come back, or whatever else, she would make a fuss and shout, but it was all self-inflicted. She had never scolded her mother-in-law straight to her face.Moreover, Lin Lan\u2019s soft-spoken speech gave the old lady the illusion that this is her eldest daughter-in-law, not her third daughter-in-law. She subconsciously made a face and made a mother-in-law type of move, \u201cThe mother-in-law is speaking. How can the daughter-in-law interrupt?\u201dLin Lan looked at her in surprise, \u201cOh, I see. You want me to slap the table and scold my mother, right?\u201dShe rolled up her sleeves as she spoke.Compared to the original owner, she is very temperamental, and she is afraid that they will not be able to adapt to her deliberately gradual and orderly progress. Since she was not used to the way she normally spoke, then she still had to slap the table and curse someone?Lin Lan is a little uncertain. It couldn\u2019t be that this person was used to being abused?\u201cOh, Da Wang\u2019s mother, don\u2019t.\u201d Sister Han hurriedly pressed her arm, \u201cIf you have something to say, don\u2019t get angry.\u201dDon\u2019t lift up the table.Lin Lan smiled, \u201cYeah, isn\u2019t that how it is? The judge Cui said the same. He told me that quarreling and losing my temper can\u2019t solve the problem so I have to sit down and have a good talk. He also said that my heart was borrowed when I was born. If he opened it for me, I will understand the truth, and I won\u2019t be able to be like that anymore.\u201dSeeing the family was shocked by her as if they had seen a ghost, she smiled again and continued to add fire, learning the drama, holding a fist and shaking it to the old man and the others, apologized, \u201cI used to be confused. When I\u2019m doing something not right, Dad, eldest brother, second brother, eldest sister-in-law, you have to bear with me.\u201d\u201cPatter.\u201d Someone dropped their chopsticks on the table.The old lady Han was so surprised that she forgot to scold her, and she kept looking at her, wondering if she had drank the pesticide, died, and was possessed by something?Second sister-in-law kept screaming at the men, trying to get the men to support herself.Lin Lan didn\u2019t care if they lost their souls one by one, but first made sure she, herself, and Xiaowang finished eating.This thick pancake was stuck in her throat, and she couldn\u2019t swallow after a few mouthfuls so she had to keep drinking water.When she finished eating, she noticed that everyone else was peeking at her while eating, making it obvious that they were nervous.Don\u2019t look at how the old lady Han scolded her so vigorously behind her back, but when she was actually in front of her, the old lady Han was not an opponent. She could win over her. The original owner also wouldn\u2019t let the old lady Han hit her, and the original owner was also very shameless so her mother-in-law Han who still wanted a bit of face really had no way to win.Only after it was all over and the original owner was not there anymore could anyone criticize and scold her.After all, the old lady doesn\u2019t have the name of a shrew, and she still has to have face.Thinking that the old lady wanted to drive herself and the children out but would not give any money, Lin Lan didn\u2019t want her to eat peacefully.She put down her chopsticks, \u201cFather, I have something to say.\u201dWithout waiting for the old man Han, the old lady Han slapped her chopsticks like a frightened rabbit, pulling her face and cursing nervously, \u201cWhat kind of dog shit do you have? I warn you, drinking pesticides again won\u2019t scare people. Next time you want to drink pesticides you won\u2019t need to get a bottle, I\u2019ll buy you a full bottle!\u201dLin Lan touched Xiaowang and told him to eat his own food and said to the old lady, \u201cMother, regarding what you said, pesticides are materials and can\u2019t be randomly bought whenever you want to buy some. I want some money to bring Xiaowang to the town\u2019s hospital to have a look at his eyes.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have any money!\u201d The old lady was like a cat whose tail was trampled on. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know our family\u2019s situation? Where would we get the money to see a doctor? Besides . . .\u201dHe\u2019s just a stupid fool. What kind of illness is there? Raising him hungry but not dead is already good enough.Lin Lan sneered. Since that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ll have to offend you. I\u2019ll take the money for this quarter first!Notes:[1] In this chapter, Lin Lan\u2019s husband side of the family is introduced. The uncle and aunt are younger than normal because the old lady Han or Mrs. Han gave birth to them at an older age. The Chinese is \u5c0f\u53d4\u548c\u5c0f\u59d1 so it means that most likely, they are Lin Lan\u2019s children\u2019s youngest paternal aunt or uncle so I used the term their youngest uncle and their youngest aunt. They are also Lin Lan\u2019s sister-in-law and brother-in-law so you might have seen the two terms used interchangeably.[2] In this time period, a landlord\u2019s family was considered rich so whenever they mention this, it\u2019s similar to saying you\u2019re someone from a rich family.[3] these two preserved eggs \u8fd9\u4fe9\u76ae\u86cb- This is sort of like saying those two naughty boys/rotten eggs. In Chinese, preserved eggs is pi dan \u76ae\u86cb, and naughty in Chinese is tiao pi \u8c03\u76ae. It\u2019s like a play on words with the word pi \u76ae.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Han Qingsong\u2019s allowances were sent once every three months. However, it wasn\u2019t personally sent by him as all payments were entrusted to the army\u2019s logistics for unified processing.These two days were the arrival dates for the remittance of the second quarter. First, it would go to the county town and afterwards, the postman would send the remittance list to the house. Because of the lack of staff, the postman would take at least three days to send the order to the house.Lin Lan wanted to make the most out of this time difference. She would go to the county town tomorrow to obtain the remittance list first and take out the money beforehand just like the old lady Han.When Han Qingsong provided the remittances early on, the recipient was written in the name of the old man Han. But the old lady Han would take the referral letter and the old man Han\u2019s personal seal to withdraw the money.Later, the original owner gave birth to Xiaowang. In the past few years, she had been causing trouble annually, insisting that Han Qingsong had to remit the money to her. The old lady Han naturally refused to agree, so Han Qingsong simply allowed Lin Lan\u2019s name to be written on it as well. Both names were capable of withdrawing the money, it\u2019s just that the original owner never had a chance to do so.Lin Lan waited for Xiaowang to finish eating before she led him out for a walk to digest the food.In the alley, she met a boy in the village who would always be playing with Sanwang. She quickly asked him, \u201cXiao Niu, where is Sanwang?\u201dXiao Niu was taken aback by her presence. Not daring to look at her, he dashed away, \u201cThe Southern River.\u201dLin Lan carried Xiaowang on her back and headed to the southside of the village. On the way, many villagers that passed by were silently and sneakily taking glances at her direction.\u201cShe\u2019s fine now? Didn\u2019t she die after spewing white foam from her mouth?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t speak of nonsense, it\u2019s probably just water mixed inside the empty medicine bottle.\u201d\u201cHey, do you think Han Qingsong really wants to divorce her?\u201d\u201cShhh, she\u2019s here.\u201dLin Lan walked by with Xiaowang on her back and glanced at the woman who was gossiping about her divorce. She was considered one of the former enemies of the original owner. She mimicked the expression and tone of the original owner, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t marry you even if I get divorced.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d The woman was so angry.Lin Lan left leisurely.\u201cIs she possessed?\u201dWhy don\u2019t you continue?\u00a0Before that, the original owner would definitely be retaliating angrily as she jumped around in rage. People who had nothing better to do often liked to irk her to see her funny and enraged exclamations.Lin Lan came to the Southern River as she carried Xiaowang. There, she saw the little brat Sanwang swimming around in the river like a happy duck.Stupid brat, you even forgot about eating.\u201cSanwang, come up here!\u201d Lin Lan called him.Sanwang heard his mother\u2019s voice but he dived into the water like a fish. He proceeded to remain submerged underwater for a long time.Lin Lan was startled to see that, \u201cHan Wangmin, get out of there quickly!\u201dPeople who came out of their houses to find cicada larvaes heard her yell and they knew that the Shrewish Wife was at it again. However, they did gather round to watch the scene unfold, be it consciously or subconsciously.Sanwang was reluctant to leave, but in the end he was afraid that Lin Lan would get angry, so he reluctantly swam over and climbed ashore with a dazed look, \u201cMother, why are you here?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6\u201cWhere is your second brother?\u201d\u201cDid he not bring the melon home? I found a wild melon when I was cutting the grass and asked my second brother to send it home for mother to eat.\u201dLin Lan guessed that Erwang had probably hidden somewhere and ate it by himself. She told Sanwang to go home for dinner, \u201cIn the future, you\u2019re not allowed to swim in the river alone or at night.Thinking of the possibility of this kid drowning in the water, Lin Lan felt that it would be appropriate for him to stray further from the body of water.Sanwang didn\u2019t care, \u201cMother, I\u2019m good with water.\u201dA modernised 7-year-old wouldn\u2019t be considered sensible, but like a little adult, he was better at cutting weeds and catching fish on a daily basis than his elder brother.\u201cHave you heard that those who drown are those who can swim(1)? Why would those who do not know how to swim approach the river?\u201d Lin Lan urged him to go home.(T/N: A saying that one\u2019s skill may bring misfortune as well. The logic comes from the concept the ones who are unable to swim knows better than to go in the water, so the ones who drown were always the people who could swim)Although Sanwang followed her home, he didn\u2019t take it seriously and talked about it excitedly.After returning to the village to watch Sanwang enter the house, Lin Lan went to the brigade headquarters with Xiaowang on her back because the branch officers would frequently idle here after dinner.At this time where every other family was having a hearty dinner, the men gathered in duos and trios to enjoy the coolness as they made small talk. The summer season was all about weeding, so there was nothing much to do at night. The roads and reservoirs did not need the additional maintenance recently, so the members were relatively free.Even from a distance, she heard the sound of the phonograph that was brought by theSecretary as the Peking Opera \u2018Red Lantern\u2019 was played.Seeing Lin Lan coming with her child on her back, the villagers looked at her one after another.\u201cWhat is she doing with the little fool on his back?\u201dThey used to hear rumours that she disliked Xiaowang and had never seen her taking him out to play.Did she really get possessed today?When she was just making a scene and fussing about, everyone said that she had succumbed to the evil; and yet, once they were used to her loud tantrums and she remained calm, no longer being enraged, it was ironic that the villagers seemed to think that the possibility of her being possessed this time was significantly higher.Lin Lan thought that it was good to have a reputation as a shrew to protect her body. Anyway, her reputation was already at rock bottom, so there was basically nothing to be ashamed of as the others gossiped about her.For example, she pretended not to see the gathering of wives and walked past with her head high, so she definitely didn\u2019t have to say hello.Saying hello would scare them.It was an unwritten rule that there were only men in the Brigade(2) team. Men will find men to play together and women will be teased if they come over. At this time, countrymen were not good at expressing feelings with their own partners. The weird part was that besides working, some men would never gossip and exchange feelings with their own wives for the rest of their lives.(T/N: A board of committee members typically in charge of management and service. It functions kind of like a Student Council\u2014 instead of students, the members comprised of adults and the school\u2019s settings would be a village to a town/city.)Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7\u201cSecretary, Leader, let me write a letter of introduction!\u201d Lin Lan was not afraid of being heard. Instead, she learned to shout loudly, just as the previous owner did before.The advantage of this was the fact that there were many microphones that were almost synchronized. The Secretary and the Leader of the Brigade heard it and someone responded for them.She knew where the two were, so she went to them with her child on her back.\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u00a0 Qingsong\u2019s daughter-in-law, are you okay?\u201d The cadres didn\u2019t have much prejudice against her and they even took the initiative to care about her.Lin Lan tried not to be as out of character as she could, so she said with a rough expression, \u201cI\u2019m okay. I just wanted a letter of introduction to go to the county town tomorrow.\u201d\u201cWhy are you going to the county town?\u201d\u201cLook at my Xiaowang\u2014he is four years old and his eyes are not in a good condition, so I want to take him to the hospital.\u201dEveryone breathed a sigh of relief. They were going to see a doctor, not to complain.She had made trouble before. She thought that Han Qingsong would not come home and her mother-in-law treated her harshly, so she wanted to file a complaint with the county\u2019s Revolutionary Committee.If a soldier\u2019s family were to file a complaint or a report, that would become a very serious matter.Fortunately, she didn\u2019t make it.The Leader exchanged glances with the Brigade\u2019s Secretary,\u00a0should we ask the old man Han?The secretary winked at the accountant next to him as the latter hurried to ask the old man.Lin Lan said again, \u201cSecretary, can I borrow five dollars? I will return the remainder if I can\u2019t finish it. As for the rest, you can just deduct them from my work points later on.\u201dSoon the accountant came back and made a gesture\u2014 there was such a thing.The Brigade\u2019s Secretary happily approved as he went back to the room. Taking the paper, he wrote a few words and sealed it before letting Lin Lan press her fingerprint on it.\u201cThank you, Secretary. Thank you, Leader,\u201d Lin Lan accepted the letter of introduction and the money, even asking Xiaowang to thank them again.Everyone was at a loss seeing her being so polite. Something is\u2026 not right.The tigress even said\u2019 thank you\u2019? This kind of courtesy belonged to a city dweller that was knowledgeable.Lin Lan didn\u2019t say much, leaving them to think about it by themselves as she went home with Xiaowang on her back.As soon as she left, the office broke into chaos and they asked what was going on.The old man Han was still angry about the fact that a lady had gone to the men\u2019s den. Later, he heard that she was borrowing money for her child to see a doctor and he felt his old face become flushed again. That was because his family was the one that treated her third family harshly and refused to help her obtain treatment for the child.\u201cThis woman, she said at home that if she wasn\u2019t busy, she would send him to the doctor\u2019s place. I didn\u2019t expect her to go there personally, though,\u201dThose who were empathetic could also understand her point of view\u2014she would get busy as the Autumn Harvest was only a few days away, so when would there be ample time to go by then?Or, it was probably old lady Han who would not give her the funds. If it was their youngest son or daughter who were ill, she would have rushed them to the hospital long ago.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8With Lin Lan\u2019s previous foreshadowing, the old head Han didn\u2019t think much about it. He even took the initiative to keep it from the old lady Han that Lin Yan had borrowed five Yuan from the Brigade. He was going to refer back later to tell them to put the money on the family tab as well.That night, Lin Lan told Erwang to watch Sanwang carefully. Then, she asked Erwang to quietly go to the kitchen cupboard to get some snacks.As a result, Erwang took out two palm-sized covers, \u201cMother, they finished eating them all.\u201dTheir family was big, so it was normal for them to finish up the food that was made on that day. Then, they would start a new batch of food the next.Lin Lan had to give up, and then quietly took the military kettle brought back by Han Qingsong. She filled it with water and hid it.In the West Kang (3), the old lady Han heard the movement and she wanted to take a look, but she was restricted by the old man, \u201cI guess the child is drinking water, just go to sleep.\u201d(T/N: \u2018Kang\u2019 is a term for a small platform that is used for working, sleeping etc. Think of it as a Chinese version of a Japanese tatami, but with a hole that is connected to the chimney pathway. This makes the \u2018bed\u2019 warm in winter as the fire burns in the fireplace.)Early before dawn the next morning, Lin Lan got up and took Xiaowang to the county town.Because there was not enough dry food and no food stamps, she had to go around to the vegetable garden and pick up two cucumbers quietly to satisfy her hunger. If the old lady Han wanted to lecture her for it, then so be it.Shanzui Village had only one dirt road that led to the county town. Walking East along the Southern River, it was less than fifty miles away. However, she had to walk for a long time with her child.After all, she was a squeamish modern civilian. Surrounded by air conditioning in hot weather and heating in the cold, she had never carried a child like this against the blazing sun.She was hot and tired, feeling that the sun above her head had now turned into a big fireball to scorch her. The dirt road under her feet was also rather bumpy as she walked very painstakingly.Soon, her back, legs and feet started to hurt and become sore.Xiaowang was also a very sensible child. Hence, he took the initiative to walk as he held hands without letting her carry him.Lin Lan tried to persuade Xiaowang to talk, but he didn\u2019t like to communicate after he left the house. His mouth was tightly sealed, especially since they left the Shanzui Village.Lin Lan spoke to him with a dozen sentences. It would be considered good if he could reply with a word or two; should it be outsiders, he wouldn\u2019t bother to reply at all.Lin Lan didn\u2019t force him to talk. She was a bit nervous, to be honest\u2014 if he had started to chat away with her, she really didn\u2019t know what to talk about.After all, she really didn\u2019t know how to bring up children.Later, they encountered a mule cart. After hitchhiking for a while, she was considered lucky to get a free ride.After the carpooling, they finally entered the county town within a few days. However, she didn\u2019t know the way around. She didn\u2019t know where the post office was, so she asked the security officer with red armbands and indigo clothes for directions.When the people heard her tone and looked at her posture along with a skinny child, they knew that she was an average or lower-classed peasant. They immediately showed her the way enthusiastically, and a kind person even gave them two pieces of candy.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Lin Lan took Xiaowang to drink some water and eat a piece of cake on the side of the road. She pondered as she thought about buying a bicycle; her legs would definitely break if she ever went out without a bicycle.There was not enough dry food. They each had a few bites and drank a few mouthfuls of water to continue the journey. The county town was not too big, so they arrived at the post office soon.At this time, the county\u2019s Posting and Telecommunications Office was not big.It was also very conspicuously next to the department store.Lin Lan entered the lobby and looked at the window where there were a few people queuing up. Some of them called and sent telegrams, and there were two or three people at the remittance window.She pretended not to understand anything, so she asked someone to ask where to get the remittance.A female staff member in a gray-blue uniform helped her, asking her where she came from and how much she would withdraw.Lin Lan tried to imitate women from other countries who had never seen the world before. The timid eyes and timid tone of voice naturally made people want to help.\u201cDid you bring the remittance slip?\u201d\u201cThe remittance slip hasn\u2019t been sent home yet, it\u2019s been at the post office in the past two days. Can you check it for me? If it arrives, I will wait outside for the night to pass, collect the money, and then take the baby to the hospital for treatment,\u201d Lin Lan said, trying to make the tone of her voice as troubled as she could to spark the other party\u2019s feelings of sympathy for her.Sure enough, the female staff member looked at Xiaowang and asked what was wrong. It was a pity to know that his eyesight was not good.\u201cThis kid has such handsome eyes, why can\u2019t you see clearly?\u201d She raised her hand and put it in front of Xiaowang\u2019s eyes. Naturally, he couldn\u2019t respond.\u201cWait for a moment, I\u2019ll check it for you.\u201dSoon, the female staff member smiled and greeted Lin Lan, \u201cYou came here at the right time; we were just about to send the order. If you hadn\u2019t come this time, it would have taken at least two or three days to get the order.\u201dLin Lan happily thanked her.She took out the letter of introduction and the marriage certificate, \u201cI am a woman of no education. I can\u2019t write my name, so I only know how to press fingerprints. This is a marriage certificate that was issued by the government, can it prove that I am the wife of Han Qingsong?\u201d\u201cIt can!\u201d The staff inside was amused by her.Lin Lan\u2019s eyes were clear, \u201cThen, please take it out for me quickly.\u201dThis time it was 260 Yuan\u2014 40 Yuan more than what it was before!!!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10The remittance slip did not come with a message. Hence, it was natural to have no explanation as to why there was an increase in money. Things like this could only be understood through a family letter.Lin Lan pressed her handprint onto the documents before dividing the portion of the money into two. Then, she proceeded to put the two parts into her pockets and thanked the staff members.\u201cHurry, go to the hospital and get your child cured early.\u201dAfter Lin Lan left, several female staff members gathered together to gossip, \u201cIt\u2019s 260 Yuan! What does her husband do? Why is there so much money?\u201d\u201cThe remittance address belongs to the army.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an officer. It\u2019s truly amazing how the countryside managed to conscript an army officer.\u201d\u201cHow did she get such a great marriage partner?!\u201dLin Lan, who was envied to have a successful marriage, was currently very tired as she journeyed with the child. Although the body belonged to the original owner, the pain, fatigue and the sense of accomplishment seemed to have stemmed from her soul.So the fact that she couldn\u2019t endure hardships, couldn\u2019t deal with troubles, and couldn\u2019t cope with exhaustion was entirely because of her.(T/N: The author was very ambiguous about this but it means that everything she feels now is from her emotions alone. Only the outer shell, that is the body, belongs to someone else but everything she is experiencing is because of her emotions alone)She must have a bicycle, she must be able to eat white noodles and meat!Leaving the post office, she wondered if she should go to the school to find Dawang and Maisui first. However,upon looking at the weather, she thought it would be best to go to the hospital first.It was not the first time for the siblings to go into the county town to deliver items to her brother-in-law and sister-in-law\u2014 they would be able to go home by themselves without a problem.So, she brought Xiaowang along and sat on a stone in front of the hospital to rest as she truly couldn\u2019t walk any further.Before this, her energy and will to continue came from her determination to withdraw money. Now, she wanted nothing more than to find a restaurant\u00a0 and have a good meal before having a good rest in a guest house.It\u2019s a pity that she didn\u2019t have any food stamps with her. Hence, even if she had the money, she couldn\u2019t buy anything to eat\u2014\u00a0how annoying.Xiaowang slumped next to her, leaning on her to gain a sense of security.Lin Lan patted him, motioning that there was nothing to be afraid of.After resting for a while, Lin Lan got up. As her movement was too abrupt, her vision blackened for a moment and her entire being swayed.\u201cBe careful\u2014\u201d Someone helped steady her in time, which was why she didn\u2019t end up collapsing onto the ground.Lin Lan knew that this was probably caused by her low blood sugar levels or the low blood pressure. It took some time for the darkness to dissipate from her eyes, needing about an entire minute to regain her sight gradually.\u201cWell\u2026 my friend, are you okay?\u201d The gentle and warm voice made her relax involuntarily.Lin Lan rubbed her eyes, \u201cThank you, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just a little dizzy.\u201dShe thanked the person and saw that it was a male doctor in a white coat. He was probably around 26 or 27 years old, born with gentle features and handsome traits with a unique bookish spirit.He was looking at her with a faint smile, his eyes coated with an odd expression.Lin Lan hurriedly moved away from the male doctor slightly. She held Xiaowang\u2019s hand and the child hugged her thigh tightly with no intention of letting go.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11The doctor smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re probably here to get some treatment for your child, am I right? My name is Yanghan\u2026\u201d He paused slightly, but seeing that Lin Lan did not respond to the name, he continued, \u201cI\u2019m a surgeon here, let me send you two in.\u201dLin Lan hurriedly declined, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t want to bother you. We can just go there by ourselves.\u201dBecause both of their destinations were the same, Yang Han still accompanied the two into the hospital. On the way, he learned about Xiaowang\u2019s situation and introduced Lin Lan to a senior doctor with the surname Liu, who could attend to ophthalmology and pediatric problems.At this time, the hospital did not specifically cater to autism. At most, issues like that would be handled by the pediatric section.Lin Lan thanked him once more before she left with Xiaowang.Yanghan, \u201cDo you not think that I seem a bit familiar to you?\u201dLin Lan glanced at him, wondering if this person was just being funny. If one was just interested in her, normally people would say, \u201cI think you look good,\u201d so she was confused as to why he said something like that.As that train of thought flashed through her mind, she found it slightly ironic. She was a village woman with a child after all, but to have this kind of luck\u2026\u00a0It\u2019s best to just forget it.What else was there to do but to forget about it?She walked to the door of the senior doctor\u2019s office. As she looked back, her eyes met with Yanghan\u2019s smiling orbs.She couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly excited as she quickly led Xiaowang to open the doors.The person who welcomed them was an old doctor who had a white beard and grey hair. There were a pair of reading glasses on the bridge of his nose, but the legs of his glasses were broken as they were tied with a rope.First and foremost, he had a look at the boy\u2019s condition and asked him a few things. Then, he directed a lot of questions to her and spoke a lot of technical terms. Lin Lan couldn\u2019t understand it and she didn\u2019t bother to ask how any of them originated either.At any rate, when the original owner was pregnant, she had to fight with a \u2018vixen\u2019 during a certain village meeting. As a result, she had a physical conflict with the woman, which caused a specific injury to her stomach and resulted in premature delivery\u2014 that was why Xiaowang suffered eye injuries.She guessed that there was congestion that affected his blood pressures and eye nerves.The old doctor said that he could opt to wear a pair of glasses as he prescribed some eye drops for the child.Lin Lan wondered if he could have an operation to just solve the issue. \u201cDoctor, you can issue a CT scan for him.\u201dThe old doctor looked at her from his reading glasses, \u201cI\u2019ll say, sister-in-law, how do you even know of the existence of CT scans? We don\u2019t have this thing yet,\u201d He heard the youngsters mention that only foreigners knew of such a thing, yet a sister-in-law from the countryside could unexpectedly name it.Lin Lan immediately pretended to be silly and smiled, \u201cOh no, I only heard the doctor in my village say that there was such a scan.\u201dThe old doctor smiled and said, \u201cX-rays can\u2019t be taken in our small county, so we would have to go to the province. But I also understand the logic behind it. A broken bone could be scanned, but for the child\u2019s sickness, it\u2019s not something that a CT scan is able to solve.\u201dLin Lan was neither a doctor nor did she understand this.\u00a0Let\u2019s just listen to him and try using some eye drops.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12The old doctor called a young doctor to help him as he proceeded to take Xiaowang to check his eyes.Xiaowang was always scared, holding Lin Lan tightly and refusing to let go. There was no other way to do things so Lin Lan had to go in with him.After working for a long time, he finished the inspection. Finally, the doctor filled out the form and let her choose the glasses.The old doctor suggested she take the cheapest one as it could be used anyways. The country folks don\u2019t have much money; it was already a feat to be able to afford glasses.In the end, he saw the country woman pondering and selecting, before she finally picked the best one\u2014 silver frames over crystal lenses with copper legs that cost more than 7 Yuan.He couldn\u2019t help but glance at Lin Lan\u2014 it\u2019s rare for a country woman to have this kind of courage to spend money.It\u2019s a habit for Lin Lan to buy good things. She firmly believes in the saying that \u2018you get what you pay for\u2019. Since the days when she had financial independence, she had always insisted on buying good things instead of cheaper ones.It was only when she paid the money did she find it really expensive. The total cost was more than 8 Yuan. Seeing a doctor in the country costs only a penny or two, so this was really expensive in comparison.Lin Lan only felt the pain for a second but she paid the money happily.After all, to see a doctor for a child, no matter how much money was spent, she chose the best and the most expensive glasses with special silver frames, crystal lenses and copper legs.Those glasses were pretty good-looking anyway. If Xiaowang didn\u2019t need to wear them in the future, they could be considered antique items instead of a waste.It wasn\u2019t possible to get the glasses in a day; they had to wait for three days.Lin Lan was startled. It took her almost half a day to get everything done. To go back to the village and return was something she didn\u2019t really want to do either.She tried to bargain with the old doctor, \u201cDoctor Liu, from dusk till dawn, we walked step by step from Shanzui Village, which is about 50 or 60 miles away. If we were to go back now, we would have to come again, but it\u2019s not an easy journey. We can\u2019t afford to live in the guest house and I don\u2019t have any food stamps with me. Can I take it today? It doesn\u2019t matter if it gets too late\u2026\u201dThe old doctor smiled and said, \u201cSister-in-law, I can\u2019t rush this matter. Three days is already considered quite fast as these special lenses have to be sent here from the district hospital.\u201dLin Lan had to give up.She wondered how difficult it was for farmers to enter the city.Let\u2019s not mention the letter of introduction; obtaining food is also a problem. I only ate twice with the amount of food I brought, but it would turn bad after some time. To have a meal in the city means that I need food stamps, but how am I meant to obtain them as a country villager?In the countryside, if you wanted food stamps, you could use the harvests to exchange them with the Harvest Control Office. There, they would only give the food stamps but not the money. But when we go out to eat, you\u2019d have to pay with both food stamps and money. With all these exchanges, how do farmers even profit? How could anybody ever own that much grains and harvests? Those measly supplies wouldn\u2019t even fill any stomachs.But to make a second trip here made her very worried. Even now, both of her legs ached to no end.I really want to know why changing a body can make me this squeamish!Sigh, I really want to have a bicycle.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13She took Xiaowang and left. Both of them were tired and hungry at the moment, but unfortunately they\u00a0 finished all of their pancakes. Without food stamps, even if they had the money, they weren\u2019t eligible for a meal at the restaurant.She hesitated, wondering if she should go to the hospital cafeteria to use some techniques and invoke some feelings of empathy from others. This way, she wouldn\u2019t have to use food stamps or money to get a steamed bun.(T/N: Once again, it was very ambiguously written, but this implies the art of seduction to get others to buy food for her.)However, as most of the residents had eaten dinner, the stalls were no longer open. Besides, there were only a set number of steamed buns available each day.\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Xiaowang spoke unconsciously.Lin Lan thought for a while, \u201cLet\u2019s go around and see if we can spend some money with the residents to buy a cake to eat.\u201dShe had no hopes for the plan to work. At this time, food stamps were more important than money and there was absolutely no way to buy food without food stamps.Many country folks came into the city with eggs to exchange for some food stamps with the city people.They would agree to the exchange with harvested items and not money.After all, food stamps fulfilled the qualifications to buy food, whereas money did not have the same rights.When she left the hospital with Xiaowang, she unexpectedly met Yanghan again.Lin Lan subconsciously pressed the money in her pocket.\u00a0Why is he being so kind? It can\u2019t be that he truly has feelings for me right?She looked at Yanghan\u2019s delicate eyebrows, accented with a gentle and clear pair of eyes. If anything, he certainly didn\u2019t look like a bad person, so she wasn\u2019t really afraid of him.Yanghan asked in a very familiar tone, \u201cIs the child okay?\u201dLin Lan glanced at him suspiciously asif he seemed to know her well, but she still smiled and said, \u201cThank you, Doctor Yang, for your concern. Doctor Liu prescribed him some glasses and asked for us to return in three days.\u201dYanghan looked at her and the child. Knowing that they were hungry, he suggested, \u201cI have some extra steamed buns that I bought this noon. You can bring your child to the cafeteria to eat them.\u201dLin Lan had some thoughts now.Why is he treating me so nicely for no reason?Even if he was that kind, there were so many people coming and going from this hospital. He couldn\u2019t possibly offer to help every single one of them, right?After all, no one would have any extra food stamps at this time; anyone who buys more food would probably save it for dinner. So why did he choose to give it to me?Is he really interested in me?Actually, the original owner\u2019s appearance was quite pretty. Although she had five children, she was still slender and slim. It\u2019s just that her usually outrageous and vixen-like behaviour masked her beauty.See how the slightest normality could even attract the attention of the opposite sex. Sometimes, even gentle and handsome doctors would have no choice but to pay attention.What a pity; I already have a husband.\u201cThank you, Doctor Yang, but there is no need.\u201dUpon hearing her politeness, his eyes became even more curious. With a smile, he asked, \u201cI\u2019ll say, Lin Lan, do you not recognise me?\u201dStop flirting with me, I\u2019m a married woman!Lin Lan smiled as she replied, \u201cDo I know you?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14In the original owner\u2019s memory, apart from Han Qingsong, her husband\u2019s family, and her family\u2019s old enemies who fought all year long, there was really no one else that she could recall, let alone a neat and organised man.Yanghan could see that she didn\u2019t seem to remember him, causing his smile to hint a tinge of playfulness, \u201cAren\u2019t you Lan Huahua?\u201dLan Huahua?\u00a0Her hair was going to stand erect; who the hell is Lan Huahua?Oh.\u00a0She remembered that the original owner\u2019s name could technically be interpreted as Lin Lan.She was from the countryside, after all. The people there would name their daughters after the names of flowers, plants, crops and so on but never really naming them with the word \u2018Lan'(1).(T/N: Lan\u2014 orchid and Lan\u2014haze/ mist,\u00a0 have the same pronunciation but different ways of writing. Here, it is said that MC\u2019s Lan came from the origins of the word \u2018haze/ mist\u2019\u00a0 instead of the orchid)But seriously, Lan Huahua\u2026is way too cheesy.Yanghan looked at her and saw her horrified expression before he laughed hysterically, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I am not a bad person.\u201dDoesn\u2019t reassure me when actual ill-intent people never openly declare that they have bad intentions.Lin Lan never forgot about Lan Huahua, though.Yanghan quickly said, \u201cLin Lan, I\u2019m Panpan,\u201d If he didn\u2019t clarify it, he was worried that the person in front of him would start to hit him.\u201cPanpan\u2026 Ah, it\u2019s you, Yang Pangpang(2)!\u201d Lin Lan suddenly remembered, she remembered!(T/N: His name is similar to how one would address a plump person in a cute way. Fat in Chinese s read as \u2018pang\u2019 so instead of calling him \u2018Panpan\u2019, his nickname was \u2018Pangpang\u2019 because he was chubby as a child)When the original owner was a child, she had a friend whom she knew of as Panpan. However, everyone called him \u2018Pangpang\u2019 because he was truly fair and chubby at the time.It\u2019s quite strange now that she thought about it. In the 1950\u2019s, everyone lived less than comfortable lives where there was never enough food or never enough warmth. Everyone had skinny frames due to the uncertainties of the limited resources, yet Yang Panpan was able to become fat under those circumstances.Everybody thought that it was odd, secretly wondering if he actually ate ten eggs a day!At that time, two people in a family were only allowed to rear one chicken. With the number of people in his family, they were allowed to raise two and a half chickens. However, his grandmother surprisingly reared six chickens and was never caught in the act. All she wanted to do was to make sure that her one and only grandson remained well-fed.She recalled another memory\u2014 this time the original owner was younger. At the age of eight years old, she started working and Yang Panpan went to school. Boys and girls never really mixed or interacted at the time, because once they did, they\u2019d be teased by the other kids.For young children who simply thought that women would become pregnant if they hugged or kissed each other, it was true that male and females wouldn\u2019t play together unless they intended to start a relationship.But when the original owner got older, she was busy fighting with her third sister. Indeed, she didn\u2019t care much about what was going on with the other people around her,\u00a0 so Yang Panpan was also forgotten and placed in the back of her mind.Despite hearing Lin Lan call him \u2018Yang Pangpang\u2019 again was like a payback for him addressing her by her nickname, Lan Huahua, there was no awkwardness in his actions. He smiled and said, \u201cYep, that\u2019s me. Come on, let me take you for some steamed buns.\u201dLin Lan was overjoyed, \u201cFinally, I found someone that I know here. I;m going to have a good, hearty meal\u2026\u201d Realizing that she was a little ecstatic, she smiled embarrassedly, \u201cNo offense, but I\u2019m kind of starving.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15\u201cI know, that\u2019s why I was waiting here to invite you to have some steamed buns,\u201d Yang Han asked them to go to the cafeteria with him.Not only was there a basket of white steamed buns, there was even a bowl of seaweed egg drop soup!Although it was nothing fancy compared to the modern delicacies that the foodie had eaten before, Lin Lan became excited. Food tastes the best when one is hungry, after all.She quickly took out some money.Yanghan said sternly, \u201cWe are from the same village; don\u2019t treat me like I can\u2019t afford a few steamed buns and a bowl of soup. That would be looking down on my abilities.\u201dLin Lan said to Xiaowang, \u201cXiaowang, say \u2018thank you\u2019 to uncle.\u201dXiaowang glanced at him quickly. His lips moved slightly as he called him uncle.Yanghan touched his head.Xiaowang was so scared that he hurriedly avoided his touch, gripping onto Lin Lan desperately.Lin Lan patted him comfortingly, implying that there was no need for him to be nervous.Yanghan laughed and teased him, \u201cLet go of your restrictions and eat as much as you want; uncle can afford it.\u201dLin Lan smiled and said, \u201cWell, excuse us then, thank you for the meal.\u201dSigh, who would have ever thought that there would come a day where steamed buns and seaweed egg drop soup were considered delicacies; no one would believe me if I was in the modern world!What a pity though, that I can\u2019t communicate with my friends in the other world. Otherwise, I would have definitely broadcasted this live on social media for them to see!Lin Lan and Xiaowang ate deliciously, not forgetting to remind Xiaowang to close his mouth when he was eating. She made sure that he didn\u2019t make sounds while munching, using small mouthfuls to drink soup and not snorting all over the place\u2026Yanghan looked a little startled.At this time, Lin Lan looked up and asked him, \u201cYanghan, how did you recognize me?\u201dYanghan pointed to his eyes, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? I have small eyes but they see really well. To be honest, you look pretty much the same; my change was the drastic one.\u201dLIn Lan glanced at him, wondering if \u2018pretty much the same\u2019 was a compliment or if he was still the adorable and childish boy from her memories.He\u2019s the epitome of \u201918 changes of a grown man\u2019 (3)\u2014 turning into a hottie from a fatty.(T/N: The phrase refers to boys who have a drastic change in appearance or sometimes, attitude, once they reach adulthood)She smiled and continued to eat, quietly speculating about Yanghan.Yanghan looked at her calmly.This is odd.\u00a0 Although she had a little bit of a fiery temper when she was younger, she was still a normal little girl. She was also quite upright\u2014 when people teased and bullied him for being fat and chubby, she stood up for him righteously.Why would she be named a tigress or a shrew once she got married? They even said that she would cause tantrums\u2014 first crying, second annoying and third hanging(4)?(T/N: A phrase to describe her as over dramatic and annoying to get what she wanted. Crying for the 1st time, then using rage and anger to annoy someone after that. And if nothing worked, hanging herself would get her attention)Maybe she was too used to picking on fights with her third sister? But that time, she was hitting her sister and not harming herself; so why did she not beat up her in-laws and chose self-depreciation instead?Maybe her husband\u2019s family was worthless, after all\u2014 driving a perfectly normal girl into a corner of madness.He heard about her jumping into the river, hanging herself, and indirectly drinking pesticides more than once.He originally thought that she must be like the other unhappy rural women now\u2014 features sloppy and unkempt with a swollen face and dull eyes. With her insane actions and violent nature, he thought she would turn out to be like his sister-in-law Xiang Lin, complaining about her \u2018unjust life\u2019 every day as her constant nags drove everyone away from her.He didn\u2019t expect that he would actually see her at the entrance of the hospital today. Although she looked a little haggard, she seemed rather normal and even had a certain temperament to her!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16To call it temperament would not do Lan Huahua justice, but he felt a feeling of slight amiss because the calm and collected aura of Lin Lan didn\u2019t seem to give off the vibe that a woman from a rural village should have.She doesn\u2019t look like a shrew anyway.Where will you ever find a shrew that eats as mannerful as this?Yang Han pondered as he came to the conclusion that rumours were never credible.When Lin Lan was full, the two recounted the past and talked about Xiaowang\u2019s condition and glasses.Yanghan said, \u201cHow about this\u2014 when the glasses arrive, I will ask the postman to pick them up and send them to your place so you don\u2019t have to make another trip here again.\u201dIt\u2019s not convenient to bring a child anywhere on a hot day.\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea, why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d Lin Lan secretly asked herself. Perhaps she was too hungry to think rationally just now, so she completely missed the idea of getting a postman to deliver it.Looking at the darkening sky, she touched Xiaowang\u2019s slightly bloated stomach and bid farewell to Yanghan to make her journey home.Originally, she wanted to go to the department store to make some large purchases, but she remembered that she didn\u2019t have any tickets with her. So, she could only dejectedly feel the pain of being unable to buy things despite having money.Yanghan said in surprise, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to walk home, right?\u201d\u201cWell, we came here by walking,\u201d Lin Lan didn\u2019t care. At this time, she could only act as if she was the public bus of the 11th street, having the soles of her shoes rub against the road as the means of travel for her journey.\u201cWait here, I\u2019ll ask if there is a car going towards your commune.\u201dAfter saying so, Yanghan went out.Soon, he came back, \u201cNo one is heading to your commune, but there are some going to the upper commune. Hitch a ride there and then you can make the rest of the journey home by walking.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll accept that. Thank you so much for your help, I never expected to find an acquaintance at the hospital today.\u201dLin Lan planned to find a way to bring Yang Han some eggs, vegetables, and whatnot for Yanghan on her next visit to the county town. Goods and eggs were the best gifts for ordinary people at this time.Yanghan sent her to the car and gave Xiaowang a handful of candy in the form of a magic trick.Xiaowang wore a pair of shorts and a waistcoat, but he didn\u2019t have any pockets. As he couldn\u2019t hold it, Lin Lan had to take it for him.\u201cWe ate your share of food and now you\u2019re even giving him more, I\u2019m absolutely embarrassed.\u201dYanghan smiled, \u201cI\u2019m an uncle, aren\u2019t I?\u201d He didn\u2019t have a sister either, so he treated her like one ever since they were kids.Lin Lan held Xiaowang\u2019s hand and waved goodbye to him.It\u2019s much more convenient to go back by car.The car ride covered about two-thirds of her journey and it only cost her two cents, which made Lin Lan almost squeal at the cheap deal.She took Xiaowang and got out of the car. At this time, the sun was setting and the afterglow was gleaming on the river, forming sparkling gold reflections on the surface of the water.Their faces were muddled with a layer of gray dirt, so she took Xiaowang to wash their faces.When she got up, she found Xiao Wang with his small face upright, eyes closed as his long eyelashes were dancing in fine golden awns. The evening breeze was blowing his messy hair, like a child in an oil painting\u2014 quiet and peaceful with an angelic luster.She couldn\u2019t bear to disturb him.After a while, Xiaowang opened his eyes, looking in the direction of the setting sun before he whispered, \u201cMother, listen!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Lin Lan pricked her ears to listen. She heard the symphony of the forest\u2014 the cicadas and the frogs sang as the insects\u2019 chirps were accompanied by the rustling wind. It was really nice.\u201cMother, did you hear that?\u201d\u201cListen.\u201d\u201cThere is a sound of\u2026\u201d He said before he closed his eyes and hummed, which was actually rather delightful to hear.Lin Lan looked at him in surprise\u2014this kid is really not just any kid. He was much better than those children who could only sing simple and straightforward propaganda songs.Besides learning how to play the suona and the bass drum, how could a country boy know the fundamentals of music?\u2026After resting for a bit and drinking some water, Lin Lan took Xiaowang home.The field was full of workers who were tending to the crops and managing the pesticides. When they saw her bringing Xiaowang, they were rather shocked as they continued to stare unapologetically.Lin Lan naturally didn\u2019t care, anyway. Under the name of a shrew protecting her like a dark halo, what was there to be afraid of!\u201cMother!\u201d A voice called out crisply.Lin Lan followed the source of the sound and found a little girl running in the fields from the north. She was 8 or 9 years old with a lively and pretty appearance\u2014 that was Maisui, all right.Maisui ran over quickly, \u201cMother, did you go to the county town to look for me?\u201dMai Sui was a precocious girl. At the age of 9 this year, she already developed a love for beauty and her vanity also began to take shape.This was the child that the original owner loved the most. However, Maisui was not as close to her mother as the original owner thought, not wanting to be \u2018her parents\u2019 little girl\u2019. Instead, she was closer with her grandmother and aunt who were rich in wealth.She said flatly, \u201cI took your brother to the doctor.\u201dMaisui sensitively noticed that her mother\u2019s tone was a little cold before she glanced at the little carrot that was holding onto her thigh. With contempt in her eyes, she wondered why her mother didn\u2019t address him as a little fool.\u201cI thought you went to the county town to pick me up because I didn\u2019t return at night,\u201d Mai Sui\u2019s tone was a little lost.Her mother would usually take care of her needs and wants the most. But now, her position was ranked behind her little brother.An uncomfortable feeling stirred in her heart.Lin Lan asked casually about her progress in school and about the girl\u2019s uncle and aunt. Then, she asked her about Dawang\u2019s activities these past two days.She was afraid that Dawang would go to the county town to meet some unconventional people and return changed and negatively influenced.However, Maisui answered the wrong answers. She kept talking about the colorful world in the city, how well the people in the city dress, how many good things the department store sells\u2014 flower skirts, nice hairpins, small leather shoes, and so on.Lin Lan was getting a little impatient, \u201cLet\u2019s talk at home.\u201dMaisui saw Xiaowang holding their mother\u2019s hand tightly, which would have been an impossible act before as she hated Xiaowang and wouldn\u2019t ever bring him for an outing.So why is she favoring him over me?\u00a0She felt uncomfortable, so she ran to take Lin Lan\u2019s other hand intimately, \u201cMother, I didn\u2019t come back all night, I miss you.\u201dLin Lan said, \u201cYou nearly wouldn\u2019t ever see your mother again.\u201dYour mother drank some pesticides yesterday. I\u2019m sorry, but you really can\u2019t see your mother anymore.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18When Maisui and her eldest brother went home, they had already heard their grandmother and aunts talk vividly about their mother\u2019s actions of messing around and drinking pesticides. She even added a few snarky comments of her own.The look on the face of her eldest brother was cold, appearing as if he wanted to commit an act of murder. Wordlessly, he ran out to tether to the weeds as she ran towards the south to wait for her mother. Others said that her mother took Xiaowang to the county town to see a doctor, but she was sure that mother intended to pick her up from the county town.Who would have thought\u2026\u201cMother, you have the money to pay for Xiaowang\u2019s medical fees? Why don\u2019t you buy me a pair of leather shoes?\u201d Maisui said frankly as her tone of voice was even laced with a tinge of unhappiness.After all, her mother used to buy things for her whenever she had any sort of change. Hence, she got used to it and felt that it was natural.Lin Lan looked at her seriously.\u00a0Yea, this girl is seriously spoiled out of habit. She\u2019s going to become aunt Number 2 and transform into a high-maintenance side character.Lin Lan looked at the clean and beautiful little girl. Currently, she wasn\u2019t very crooked in terms of greed and she might be able to change her ways of life. She said, \u201cMaisui, starting from today, every penny of our family will be prioritized to treat Xiaowang first before giving the rest of you some more lunches for school. As for things like dressing up all pretty and accessorized, we\u2019ll leave that to a later day when we become wealthy.\u201dWhat? Mother refused me?Maisui was a little dazed as she looked at Lin Lan helplessly.Mother changed! She\u2019s like a stepmother now!\u2026Lin Lan had a panoramic view of everything that was going on, but she did not change her expression.The relationship between the original owner of the body and her daughter was actually easy to explain.The original owner had always longed for someone to love her. As a daughter, she hoped to be pampered like a little princess. It was a pity that her parents didn\u2019t care for her, however. Although her grandmother did not favour sons over daughters, she remained as the little girl who couldn\u2019t be doted on.Especially when her grandmother presented her undying love for the younger aunt, it made the original owner very envious. This kind of unwilling love made her project her thoughts on her daughter invisibly, providing her with all the maternal love that she wanted.Her daughter was her own incarnation.Maisui had a special place in her heart ever since she was a child, but she still couldn\u2019t give her daughter the generously luxurious life she wanted. Instead, her doting actions were constantly perceived as annoying by her daughter. From the moment she started to mature in her thoughts, Maisui was tired of her mother being so agressive and stupid. On the contrary, she envied her younger aunt for being able to wear pretty clothes and afford to eat well.\u00a0 She was one of the more fortunate people who was educated and loved. When she was still in her schooling years, both men and women envied her to no avail.The original owner had no education as she was only equipped with little knowledge and short-sightedness. Lin Lan was merely a bystander, but she was able to see through the problems very clearly.At the end of the road, her daughter was now crooked in terms of intentions and was never exposed to the feeling of gratitude. Instead, what should have been thankfulness and love was replaced with nothing but hatred and condemnation for her fate.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19T/L: SterFor Maisui, who was doted on from the start, it was second nature for her to assume that it was a given for her mother to treat her like a princess, so she was never really required to consider any other factors. For example, in the case of her going off to the county town, she didn\u2019t pause to consider the possibility of her mother or her younger brother falling ill, nor did she consider any other circumstances. Instantly, the little girl thought that her mother went over to find her.The typical attitude of one who assumed the world revolved around them.Of course, the original owner was the one who made the biased treatment a habit, so it was a given for her to think that way.Naturally, Lin Lan wasn\u2019t going to continue treating her that way.First and foremost, she didn\u2019t like children; her taking care of them now was out of obligation. Two, she wouldn\u2019t be soft-hearted since they weren\u2019t her own children.Haha.As soon as she returned home, Lin Lan heard the voices of the old lady and the Han family\u2019s second sister-in-law coming from the hall.The Han family\u2019s second sister-in-law was angry and enraged, \u201cHow could there be such a person who borrows money from the Brigade to go to the hospital? How are we supposed to know if she just wanted to spend the money on herself under the guise of her child? Why didn\u2019t she take the child to a doctor before and care for them? And now, why is she starting to pretend?\u201dThe money was always managed by the old lady Han\u2014 every single cent and penny was to be given by the old lady herself. The young aunt was upset by the fact that she didn\u2019t even get a single fraction of the money yet, the shrew actually had the guts to borrow it on her own from the Brigade.How shameless!She drank pesticides and pretended to be dead to escape from working. That matter wasn\u2019t even over yet, and she still went to borrow some money? How the heck did she become this shameless?The old lady Han was also angry, but the old man had calmed her down and extinguished most of her anger. He told her that Xiao Wang\u2019s illness would have to be treated sooner or later; otherwise, they would be gossiped about.She took 5 dollars for the treatment but it wasn\u2019t completely cured anyways. The third house can just give up and they wouldn\u2019t have an excuse in the future to argue about.Old lady Han was slightly open-minded in regards to her thoughts\u2014 she wasn\u2019t going to argue with the shrew as he was also her grandson after all.But thinking about the vixen who dared to borrow money from the Brigade\u2014 a loan of 5 dollars, she felt that she was going to lose her life.Every penny of the family\u2019s money was always distributed or given from her hand. Therefore, having even a penny taken by others was also a provocation against her authority, which was really unbearable.What\u2019s more was that 5 dollars was not a small amount; how many people could just simply hand that amount over upon request?The old man said directly to her, \u201cDidn\u2019t Old Three (1) send you a few thousand dollars? How can that be compared to a mere 5 dollars?\u201d(T/N: Parents would address their kids as \u2018old\u2019 followed by the sequence the child was born in. For example, the 2nd child of the family would be called \u2018Old Two\u2019 and the 3rd would be called \u2018Old Three\u2019 and so on.)When he mentioned the word \u2018thousand\u2019, the old lady Han started to feel her muscles ache as she hurriedly ushred the old man to stop speaking. She didn\u2019t want any outsiders to spread the rumor of her taking advantage of the Third House\u2019s money and cause an even bigger ruckus.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20\u201cMother, are you going to take action against her or not? If this continues, she\u2019s going to be the one in charge sooner or later!\u201d Han family\u2019s second sister-in-law said angrily, \u201cI think mother should drive her back to her maternal family. Old Three is now an officer, so there\u2019s no need to worry about not finding a virtuous partner. If that\u2019s the case, why the heck are we going to insist on keeping this shrew of a tiger who is unfilial and problematic?\u201dIt happened that Lin Lan entered the yard and said with a smile, \u201cThank you for worrying, second sister-in-law, but don\u2019t tire yourself out. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t be virtuous; I won\u2019t ever be virtuous in this life. However, Old Three won\u2019t have a divorce with me either.\u201dGo on, be mad as I\u2019ll indulge in your anger.With Han Qingsong\u2019s nature, despite the original owner\u2019s tantrums, he wouldn\u2019t go as far as to divorce her for the sake of the children. He would rather silence his own voice than attempt to care for the children and educate them on his own without the prospect of having their mother\u2019s help.\u201cYou!\u201dShe was too arrogant!The old lady Han said in an unpleasant manner, \u201cYou\u2019re really capable, aren\u2019t you? Loitering around and not going to work every single day; do you think that the county town is somewhere you can go whenever you wish?\u201dLin Lan smiled and said, \u201cEven if I don\u2019t go to work, the childrens\u2019 father earns enough for me to eat.\u201dYou want me to get involved with physical labour? It\u2019ll be impossible for me to exert any form of energy. This lady has no strength, alright? Even a 50-kilometre walk is already enough to make me tired.She saw that the old lady and Han family\u2019s second sister-in-law were very angry, but she was not at all angry as she fanned the flames, \u201cOh yes, Maisui went to the county town and her young aunt had accidentally torn her clothes as she was washing them. Sigh, my poor daughter couldn\u2019t bear for her to take the brunt of the blame. Her young aunt then brought her to the mall to look at some leather shoes, saying that her grandmother would get her a pair.\u201dThe old lady Han was now uprightly fuming\u2014 that 5 dollars was enough for her to grit her teeth, but now, she had the audacity to talk about leather shoes. A pair of leather shoes costs about 7 or 8 dollars; was it something that could be bought casually?She put on a displeased expression, targeting her anger onto Maisui as she scolded, \u201cHow old is that daughter of yours? Why doesn\u2019t she look in the mirror and check out for herself if she is worthy of wearing leather shoes?\u201dExcept for her own precious little girl, no one else was worthy of leather shoes in her eyes; especially the daughter of the Third House\u2014 she was amongst the most unworthy amongst the unworthy.Lin Lan listened to her words and started to take action. Her true motive behind those words was to segregate the relationship between Maisui and the grandmother-aunt duo, in case the two continued to worsen the relationship between the little girl, Dawang and their mother.She added fuel to the fire, \u201cWhat sort of blasphemy is that? Why can your daughter wear the leather shoes, but my daughter can\u2019t? Her father was the one who earned the money!\u201dMaisui heard every single word as she teared up watching Lin Lan. She thought that her mother was protecting her and speaking up for her.Grandmother has money to spare for the youngest aunt and not for me, but the money was earned by dad.Wahhhh~Maisui cried sadly, covering her face and ran back to the East Chamber to continue sulking.

What kind of attitude was this!Old lady Han cursed, \u201cIt would have been better for her to jump into the river and die or drink pesticides!\u201d At least she would still be the one who was harming herself. At this moment, she was indifferent about living or dying, seeming exactly like a smiling tiger whose sole purpose was to infuriate others!But she really was becoming a rather cunning smiling tiger; did she find an outstanding fairy to rely on?Lin Lan returned to the East Chamber and asked Xiaowang to lie down and rest before going to eat later. She took out a piece of the candy that Yanghan had given and stuffed it in Maisui\u2019s mouth.Slap one and then treat them nicely later on(2); It worked especially for this little girl. She had to heal her quickly while she was still mentally hurt\u2014 this way, she could get closer to her daughter in her heart.(T/N: A concept that one would be strict and harsh first, before treating one nicely afterwards to attempt to get closer to them. Psychologically, it is a twisted method but pretty common for a lot of manipulative people to use on others)Maisui was enjoying the piece of candy as she buried her head into Lin Lan\u2019s embrace, bitterly complaining against the sweet contrast of the sweet, \u201cMother, grandmother is picking favourites.\u201dLin Lan suddenly felt slightly at a loss as her entire body became stiff. She broke out in a layer of cold sweat, wanting nothing more than to escape from this confrontational situation.Xiaowang was only 4 years old, so it was fine to just hug a small child like that; Maisui however, was a grown child. Lin Lan didn\u2019t know whether to hug her or to push her away, so she was caught in a slight dilemma.Worried that Maisui would become suspicious of her lack of actions, she gently patted the little girl\u2019s back, \u201cI brought Xiaowang to see the doctor. There, someone gave me a few sweets\u2026\u201dMaisui sobbed to the point where she almost choked on her own tears, \u201cMother treats me the best!\u201dGrandmother would constantly ask the girl to serve her youngest aunt, so she did several jobs like washing the elder\u2019s clothes, filling cups of tea and water and yet, they made no attempt to praise her for a job well done. In retrospect, it was her mother that couldn\u2019t bear to see her daughter do those tasks.Boohoo!! Mother is the best, after all!Lin Lan stroked her hair, learning how other mothers coaxed their daughters with her voice as she said softly, \u201cMaisui, don\u2019t worry. After the family is properly divided and we become wealthy, mother will buy you new leather shoes and pretty flower dresses.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 according to grandmother, if the house ever divides, we\u2019re going to be evicted out of here and she wouldn\u2019t give us the money either.\u201dLin Lan smiled and replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not up to her to decide.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22The weather morphing from sun to rain, a daughter becoming a daughter-in-law, a son that wants to change his career\u2014 these were things that could not be controlled by mere human capabilities.After a moment, a wailing cry was heard coming from the West Wing. It was none other than Han family\u2019s second sister-in-law.She cried for the fact that her family was poor and the treatment was unfair. The Second House and the First House had to squeeze themselves into the West Wing\u2014 one family sleeping in the Northern kang whereas the other slept in the Southern kang. The kids followed their grandparents to sleep in the East Room of the main house.However, Old Three\u2019s House could have the entire East Chamber all to themselves.She could even pretend that she was dead in order to skip her work every single day to prevent labour, leaving the family to raise her pointlessly.On what basis?!She saved up the Fabric Coupon for a long time, but she was worried that it might expire. Still, she had to wait for a long time to save up for the sufficient amount of coupons in order to exchange with someone else. However, she didn\u2019t have the money to sew the fabric into proper clothing, so she might have had to wait until the New Year\u2019s arrival before trying to get a few dollars from grandmother.Who would have ever thought that the shrew just went over to the Brigade to borrow some money directly!If that was the case, then she should go over to borrow some money too!Sister-in-law Han came back and heard someone crying in the house. At first she thought it belonged to the Third Family, but when she listened carefully, she\u00a0 realised that it was from the second family and she suddenly muttered in her heart.She thought that it was because she had come back late and dinner wasn\u2019t made that made old lady Han angry. She assumed that the elder had instructed the Second Family\u2019s wife to cook for them as she felt a little guilty.\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll cook.\u201dAt this moment, Lin Lan emerged from the East Chambers and smiled, \u201cFirst sister-in-law, let me help you.\u201dThe Han\u2019s first sister-in-law shuddered in fright and subconsciously said, \u201cNo need, no need; you took your child to the county town so you must be tired. Have a break.\u201dIn the past, the original owner would always put on a cloudy expression. She always looked as if one owed her a bottle of pesticides. She was grumbling every time she opened her mouth, so no one ever dared to speak to her.Which was why her friendly demeanour and assertiveness to help out raised several red flags for the Han family\u2019s first sister-in-law. She wondered if the woman had any other malicious intentions\u2014 perhaps adding pesticides into the soup itself and poisoning the entire family.She was so scared that she hurriedly made her way to cook in haste, all the while thinking that she should probably watch her work carefully and not allow the Third Family\u2019s wife to try anything suspicious.It was said that a dog that bites never barks\u2014 in the past, she was the one who was met with consequences when she always \u2018barked but never bit\u2019; however, she wouldn\u2019t be barking from now on, only focusing on bites.Thinking about things this way, she thought that she really had to find a way to evict the Third Family from their home.Lin Lan spreaded her arms in defeat. It wasn\u2019t that she was lazy to make a living herself; the problem was that no one dared to employ her.She glanced around and took the initiative to sweep the yard. There were several chickens in the house and the yard was dirty, after all. Then, she cleaned the patio and had her dinner outside under the cool breeze of the night.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23After cleaning, Lin Lan realised that her three boys weren\u2019t home yet, so she went out to find them.Erwang was fine\u2014 his sly tongue packed a bunch of insincere words but he could adapt to daily changes really well. However, Sanwang was spontaneous\u2014 could he be controlled by just being stricter?Besides, she had no experience in educating children; everything she had done so far was by idly being a bystander plus the experiences of the previous owner\u2019s memories that she had inherited.There was also Dawang who was no longer a little boy. He had caused her a bunch of headaches as well.She wanted to go to the Southern River to check, worried that Sanwang might have his leg cramped or something of the sorts. With the not-so-nutritious diet he was having, a slip-up would easily cause a leg cramp.And leg cramps were the most worrisome fear when one was swimming.When she reached the entrance of the village, she saw a few boys playing war and fighting games.The leader had a shaved head, thick eyebrows and long eyes. He was young but he had a heroic spirit whereas his small body was as strong as a calf. He was directing his friends to do this and that, speaking with a tone that was full of righteousness.It was Dawang.He enjoyed being the leader of the children and having the other kids listen to him well; whoever opposed him would be hit with his wrath.However, there was another child who was older than him, unconvinced and provocative.The two children fought.The other children surrounded them in excitement, clenching their fists to hype up the mood, \u201cFight! Fight! Dawang, fight!\u201dAlthough Dawang was about two or three years younger than the other child, he was not at all apologetic as he locked the older child in his grasp and wrestled him.Soon, Dawang tripped the opponent to the ground with a kick, rousing a round of applause from the spectators.Immediately afterwards, he was pressed down by the weight of the older boy\u2019s body. The boy put pressure on Dawang\u2019s smaller frame and taunted, \u201cAre you going to yield, kid?\u201dNaturally, Dawang refused to accept defeat. He neither complained out of pain nor begged for mercy as he tried to push the opponent off.Soon, he exerted a wave of strength from his waist. Then, he held the opponent\u2019s shoulders with both hands and slammed the opponent onto the ground. He managed to be the one sitting on the boy as he bent his knees to suppress the opponent\u2019s arms and squeezed his ears, \u201cI\u2019m not going to yield!\u201d\u201cAh\u2014 that hurts!\u201d The older child cried instead, kicking his legs indiscriminately in an attempt to kick Dawang away,\u201dIt hurts to death! Han Dawang, you dare to beat me up? I\u2019ll have my dad and my older brother to do the same to you!\u201dDawang didn\u2019t care as he maintained his iron-like grip on the boy\u2019s ears, asking coldly, \u201cWill you yield? Will you? Are you going to continue being disobedient to me in the future?!\u201d\u201cI will\u2026listen\u2026 to you\u2026\u201d\u201cCall me boss!\u201d\u201cBo\u2026.Boss\u2026\u201d\u201cHahaha,\u201d the children around him laughed.At this time, there were adults all over the village calling for the children to eat, which made the children scatter all at once as they made their way back home to eat.Soon, there was only Dawang left. He stood there a little dazed, as if he couldn\u2019t accept the sudden loss of followers.No one called him and he didn\u2019t want to go home either, so he turned around and walked over to a large rock to sit down.\u201cDawang,\u201d Lin Lan called out to him.Dawang was taken aback as he wasn\u2019t expecting anyone to call his name. He looked up and saw Lin Lan standing not far away from where he sat. So he stood up, turned his head and ran.\u201cDawang, why are you leaving? Let\u2019s go home for dinner,\u201d Lin Lan hurried after him.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Lin Lan knew that he hated the original owner\u2019s disregard of his reputation\u2014 making huge deals out of nothing and attempting suicide numerous times embarrased him as her son as he felt like she wasn\u2019t behaving like an adult. In addition, the original owner always ranted to him that Han Qingsong didn\u2019t send money to her, the old lady playing favourites, or the fact that she was getting picked on by everyone in the family and whatnot. With all that, he really didn\u2019t want to be categorised with the original owner for even one second lest he was only going to have to hear her rant pointlessly again.Lin Lan could understand and empathise with his feelings. After all, when her parents were nagging her in her previous life, she was adamant on wanting to disappear there and then.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that her younger brother finally got married and had children, she felt that in the eyes of her parents, he would become her responsibility. This would have meant that if he wasn\u2019t able to get married, somehow, her parents would pin the fault on her as a failure of an older sister.Hence, she could understand his feelings towards his parents.Now she was most anxious about Dawang. After all, 11 years old was a very awkward age for a child. He had begun to enter the rebellious period of his youth and his world was either painted black or white. If his parents failed to become his role models or just someone that he respected, they would be pinned as adults that couldn\u2019t understand him, ultimately becoming his enemies in life.The \u2018Chunibyo'(1) disease was a really terrible disease; everything could potentially go downhill if it wasn\u2019t handled well.(T/N: Wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a disease, but a mental state of mind where adolescents and teens who desperately want to stand out in any way possible, some even having grandiose delusions of having powers etc)Otherwise, why would there be so many remarks of parents all over the world receiving hateful backlash from their children?What\u2019s worse was the fact that the original owner had, in a way, become his role model. If he doesn\u2019t start to change his ways now, it would be too late.Lin Lan felt that since she had taken over this body, she couldn\u2019t bear the risk of ruining the reputations of the owner\u2019s relatives. It was her duty to lead the children on the right path to avoid a final tragedy.It was a pity that as a growing boy, he had already formed his own ideas and opinions, so she really didn\u2019t know how to control him as a mother. Lin Lan didn\u2019t even have a chance to prove that she wasn\u2019t going to nag at the boy.She was afraid that there was truly nothing she could do about Dawang.She had no choice but to go home. At this time, all the family members came back except Dawang and they were setting the table for dinner.As it was in the middle of summer, the table would be set up at the patio and they would eat while it\u2019s not dark out. This act would save them the use of the oil from lighting the oil lamps.The Han family\u2019s second sister-in-law appeared as if she was just taken out of a vinegar jar(2) as she looked unbelievably dissatisfied with Lin Lan. If things would go her way, she wanted to use the duration of the family dinner to officially initiate an argument with Lin Lan.(T/N: Jealousy or dissatisfaction is the same word as \u2018vinegar\u2019 in Chinese. So, unless specified otherwise, any context with the word vinegar would usually mean the two emotions)Lin Lan felt that she was trying to push her over the edge. If this had occurred before, the original owner would have most definitely started to yell at her and wouldn\u2019t dream of speaking politely with her. She wouldn\u2019t try to twist her words in a roundabout way in front of so many people either.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Which was why she was testing the waters with how much Lin Lan could handle, but her lack of outburst was something that the Han family\u2019s second sister-in-law wasn\u2019t used to.During the meal, the old man Han asked about Xiaowang\u2019s condition first before he finally had to comment, \u201cThird family, taking your child to treat his sickness is a good thing and the family agrees with your actions as well. However, privately borrowing money on your own accord is something that I must speak up about, so make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201dLin Lan was sure that they were supportive of taking Xiaowang to the doctor\u2019s, the problem lied in the fact that they weren\u2019t going to provide the financial support for it.However, she didn\u2019t retort and nodded, \u201cNoted.\u201dThe old lady Han was even more irritated when she saw thatLin Lan didn\u2019t even try to apologise for her actions and maintained her imposing demeanour.It\u2019s just the fact that the old man Han was giving her looks of disapproval for a while, making the old lady Han give in to his means and desperately suppressing the growing anger in her heart. Feeling petty, she thought that as payback, she could just minimise the food portions of the third family.The old lady Han held the rice basket and snorted coldly, \u201cThe autumn grains haven\u2019t been divided and the younger aunt and uncle are still pursuing their education, so we\u2019ll have to use the Grain Exchange Ticket for that. Our house is running out of food soon, so from now on, we\u2019ll be rationing them.\u201dThe men would receive cornmeal pancakes and a bowl of pumpkin pea porridge. Children would opt to eat thick porridge whereas women would have dried sweet potatoes and what was left of the porridge.Lin Lan and the eldest sister-in-law have the worst meal allocations.Eldest sister-in-law seemed to be used to it. She wouldn\u2019t ever have the guts to bring up any of the troubles and grievances that rained down upon her.Lin Lan looked at the muddy bowl of soup and portrayed a very disgusted expression, but she was too hungry to care, so she ate some steamed dried sweet potatoes.Ah pui! This is bitter and it\u2019s sour\u2014 what the heck is this?It\u2019s so hard to swallow!I really miss Yang Han\u2019s steamed buns.When the family divides, I will have to get myself a good bowl of white noodles and lean meat; then, it will be your turn to starve!Lin Lan wasn\u2019t aware, but the sweet potatoes and the dried sweet potatoes of this season weren\u2019t considered delicious.Sweet potatoes were generally harvested after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Some of the sweet potatoes would be dried and stored in the cellar for winter after the cold. If they were stored properly and prevented rotring, they could probably last till the next spring. However, if they started to rot after the New Year\u2019s, the bad parts had to be cut off before anyone was to eat them.But even so, they definitely wouldn\u2019t last till this season!What she was eating now was actually the \u2018mother seed\u2019 of the sweet potatoes. This one was used to germinate the sweet potatoes before it was sliced and dried, eaten only when the food on the table wasn\u2019t sufficient for a meal.This kind of sweet potato that bore the possibility of being poisonous and unfilling would naturally be granted to women.But the Han family wasn\u2019t desolate to the point where they had to resort to eating this. It was just old lady Han being petty, purposely dragging the eldest sister-in-law into this trouble just to spite Lin Lan.Xiaowang was holding his own bowl and drinking porridge. Suddenly, he held the coarse porcelain bowl and put it in Lin Lan\u2019s hand, \u201cMother, eat.\u201dEveryone was eating their own food when Xiaowang said something like this all of a sudden. Besides, his manner of speech wasn\u2019t very clear either, so it came across as very abrupt.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26When Xiaowang said that, Erwang hesitated while holding his bowl, whereas Maisui glanced at her share and didn\u2019t respond, prioritising on eating her fill.Sanwang turned his head and took a glance before he exclaimed in surprise, \u201cMother, why is your porridge so dilute?\u201d He turned his head to look at the others\u2019 and found that no one else had such a pitiful excuse for a bowl of porridge. Then, he looked at his own and scratched his head, \u201cMother, I\u2019ll split half of mine with you.\u201dWhen he said that, he poured half of his porridge into Lin Lan\u2019s bowl.It was customary for women to eat the worst meals of the family in the countryside, unless those women consisted of the strong, weak or had special circumstances that exempted them from the treatment.However, once someone spoke up about the unspoken rule, the men on the table masked their feelings with a dull expression.Eldest sister-in-law Han took a look at her man and her few children. Unfortunately, each of them knew that they were buried themselves in faked innocence, gobbling away with no intention of splitting their meals with her.The old lady Han couldn\u2019t hold her expression as she pointed her chopsticks at Sanwang, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one surprised, kid; just eat your meal.\u201dSanwang was curious, \u201cGrandmother, can we not afford to have a proper meal anymore? If so, I will dig some wild vegetables when I\u2019m mowing the grass tomorrow. I\u2019m pretty sure I saw Xiao Niu digging them before.\u201dOld lady Han almost choked to death by his words.The old head Han had to cut in, \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201dHe glanced at the basket\u2014 there were some pancakes in it and he motioned to the old lady to let the children eat them.The old man Han was in charge of any external matters, whereas the housework was handled by the old lady. She was in charge of the money and food, but she still had to listen to the old man Han in some matters.After all, you can\u2019t refute the old man\u2019s image in front of the children. This also concerned the rules of the country and the decentness of men.She angrily put the basket on the table.Sanwang immediately stood up and grabbed the biggest pancake before\u00a0 Erwang snatched it over and handed it to Lin Lan, \u201cMother, you eat the pancake.\u201dSanwang got used to it, so he ate his own food.Lin Lan split the pancake and gave them to several children. Seeing Maisui\u2019s listless look, she forced a piece on her plate as well.Eldest sister-in-law took her daughter to clean up the dishes as they started brushing the pots and bowls after dinner. However, the second sister-in-law couldn\u2019t get past her complaints and directed her anger towards Lin Lan.\u201cI\u2019ll say, third family, you\u2019re the one who borrowed the money from the brigade, so pay it back yourself and don\u2019t expect the family work points to be deducted because of you.\u201dBefore Lin Lan could speak, Sanwang shouted, \u201cMy father will send the money back to repay it.\u201dSecond sister-in-law was so angry that her teeth hurt, \u201cYour father\u2019s money belongs to the whole family, so it doesn\u2019t count!\u201dSanwang was puzzled. He was a straightforward and honest child, so he wanted to talk to his second aunt. \u201cSecond aunt, think about it\u2014 my father is the one who earns the money, so why doesn\u2019t it count?\u201dThe old lady Han waved her hand in annoyance, \u201cGo go go, go ahead and play.\u201dSpeaking of sending money back, she was busy counting the days of the LUnar Calendar with her fingers, \u201cHey, today is the 18th or the 19th; Old third should be sending the money back by now.

    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Although it was sent about this time annually, the logistics personnel of the army also have a lot of work to deal with on their part, so it was normal for the payment to have a delay of one or two days. The money wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere else anyways, so there was usually no problem waiting a day or two longer.Lin Lan pretended that she didn\u2019t know anything as she had hidden the money. It was impossible to confess despite the general fact that any actions taken after a confession would be handled with lenience. However, with the old lady Han, nothing could ever be handled with lenience as long as the matter involved money, so she might as well just wait till the truth becomes known.At noon, two days later.When the workers were leaving after work, they saw a postman in uniform entering the village and a group of kids chasing the postman\u2019s bicycle to the Han house.The postman arrived at the door and shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s a package!\u201d\u201cOh, my remittance is here!\u201d The old lady Han was so happy that she smiled to the point where her eyes were squinted, almost losing its visibility as they formed straight lines on her face. She didn\u2019t even complain about her weak frame and sore legs, practically jumping in joy as she went to receive the package.\u201cXiao Dong, where\u2019s the order?

Is Lin Lan at home?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d The old lady Han was stunned.It was as if her chest had been pierced by a sharp arrow as she felt her strength sapping away. Subconsciously, her entire being was slipping onto the ground.After a long while, a scream tore out from her throat, \u201cGod, this unfilial son! Once he has a wife, he forgets about his own mother-\u201cThe postman looked at the old lady in astonishment. In every previous meeting with the old lady Han, she was always refreshed and elated. The excitement of her brows would be evidently raised as if she had met Chairman Mao(1).(T/N: Former President of the People\u2019s Republic of China, one of its Founding Fathers. Also the Chairman of the Communist Party during the revolution and the Civil War)So why exactly does she look like she is about to cry anytime soon?\u201cMadam, what are you\u2026\u201dThe old lady Han ignored everything else\u2014she just thought that her son had changed his mind. In doing so, he betrayed her and even sent the money to her daughter-in-law instead of giving it to his mother.The sky was falling!She could not accept this fact.She forgot about her image and dignity as she slapped her thighs and cried out, \u201cHe sends it to me every time; how come it\u2019s changed now? This is because he was pressured by his wife\u2019s threats to kill herself! Sons that are wedded with wives will always forget their mothers. Ah, what an unfilial son; I no longer want to live! Don\u2019t stop me, I would like to bang my head on a wall as well\u2026\u201dThe postman was very knowledgeable as he had watched many plays in the operas. To help alleviate her embarrassment, he pretended to assume that she was making an impromptu parody of a certain act.

He also mentioned that her mother-in-law must not be allowed to touch the parcel.Now the old lady realised that she had a dignity to uphold.

Regardless of the old lady\u2019s intimidating gaze kept on her the entire time, she pressed her handprint on the papers and took the glasses, thanking Xiao Dong before she went to find Xiaowang.The old lady Han could not believe that the remittance list had not arrived, so she pulled Xiao Dong in an attempt to make him stay, asking him to provide her a good explanation of what was going on.Sister-in-law Han, who was going home to make dinner, also persuaded her, \u201cMother, maybe it hasn\u2019t arrived yet.\u201dThe old lady Han had an ominous premonition. She felt uneasy and she had to ask Xiao Dong what was going on.Xiao Dong knew that she regarded this money as something that was more important than her life. In order to avoid getting involved, he just stated that he knows nothing of the issue, not wanting to involve himself in others\u2019 family matters.He firmly held the handlebar of the bike, raised his leg and stepped up, \u201cMadam, as you can see, I have a lot of letters to send, so I\u2019ll be taking my leave now.\u201dWith a sharp force that he exerted under his feet, he cycled away as his desire for survival was extremely strong.The old lady Han mumbled suspiciously and had nowhere else to go but home.As soon as she entered the yard, she saw Lin Lan pulling Xiaowang to try on glasses at the East Chamber\u2019s kang.Lin Lan looked at the pair of glasses. The material was really good and the workmanship was exquisite, worthy of a big price.\u201cXiaowang, come here. Mother will put it on for you.\u201dXiaowang closed his eyes obediently.Lin Lan put it on and couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cIt\u2019s not dazzling, so just open your eyes.\u201dXiaowang slowly opened his eyes as the light pierced into his eyes through the glasses, providing him a sight of natural colours.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Although he could already see things before, they were vague as if the objects were covered up in a dense fog. Even if it was in front of him, he still wasn\u2019t able to see clearly. In addition, other people laughed at him by calling him a fool and a blind person. Besides, his mother didn\u2019t like him then, so he didn\u2019t dare to take a closer look. Over time, his mental instability combined with his physical illness made his eye disease deteriorate badly.The last time he went to the hospital, the senior doctor had cleaned his eyes for him and also gave him a treatment of acupuncture and moxibustion. After adding a few eye drops for him, his eyes\u2019 condition improved.But after he put on his glasses now, the fog seemed to be blown away by the wind, his orbs clear and bright for the first time.He saw a pair of beautiful eyes, the black and white contrast of her pupils and the sclera evident to him. She looked gentle and she was smiling. Like the gently-blowing breeze in March whiffing across his cheeks, like the warmth of the morning sun, like the moisture of the light and drizzling rain, it felt beautiful. It was even similar to the feeling of comfort that he relished in when he closed his eyes and heard the sound of the wind\u2026Mother, it\u2019s so pretty!He stared at Lin Lan with the gleaming eyes that blinked profusely, as if he would never be able to finish taking in the sights of his surroundings. He shouted \u2018mother\u2019 and hugged Lin Lan\u2019s neck as he rubbed his head against it and let out a grumble, sounding as satisfied as a small beast.Towards hugs like this that needed no words to be exchanged\u2026 Lin Lan was not used to them.Even so, she let Xiaowang hug her for a while before she pulled off his little hand and straightened the crooked glasses, \u201cAfter wearing it for a while, take off and rest your eyes. Mother will pick some wild chrysanthemums and dry them in the sun. Then, we\u2019ll boil some water to wash your eyes.\u201dXiaowang obediently agreed.\u201cYou can go to school if you can see clearly,\u201d Lin Lan was very happy for him.Xiaowang was still young and he hadn\u2019t been affected much, so she could very well just send him to school.\u201cTo hell with going to school, every single one of the kids think they\u2019re some sort of prodigy, and yet they can take a piss anywhere to reflect that so-called virtue,\u201d The old lady Han got angry and vented whenever she got the chance to do so.At this time, all of the children came back. When they saw Xiaowang\u2019s glasses, they said that it was really good-looking. They inquired how much they cost, but most of them just wanted to try it out for themselves.Lin Lan, \u201cXiaowang\u2019s glasses are specially made. Your eyes will spoil if you wear them, so no, don\u2019t try to wear them.\u201dSanwang was not convinced and insisted on wearing it. As a result, he started to feel dizzy as soon as he put it on. He immediately yelled and fell to the ground, \u201cOh no, I have a headache. Empty your mind\u2026 empty your mind\u2026 This disciple knows he is wrong(2).\u201d(T/N: The child is imitating how abbots constantly chant to meditate and find peace. All in all, it\u2019s a very light and harmless joke, so please don\u2019t be offended)\u201cHahaha,\u201d The children laughed.Maisui laughed so much that her stomach hurt and she sprawled onto Lin Lan\u2019s lap, unable to get up as she became weak from her laughing fit.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Lin Lan took a comb with broken ends and combed her messy hair before she told Sanwang to get up, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who has to be extra all the time. The ground is cold, get up quickly.\u201dErwang pulled Sanwang up, \u201cYou\u2019re like a loach\u2014 you\u2019re slippery.\u201dSanwang said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m obviously a little fish, why do you call me a loach? Isn\u2019t a loach ugly?\u201dLin Lan looked outside, \u201cWhere is your eldest brother?\u201dErwang\u2019s expression immediately conveyed the message,\u00a0I don\u2019t know, why are you asking me?Sanwang rushed and said, \u201cI know! He\u2019s fighting with the iron pillars on the grounds.\u201dLin Lan,\u00a0this active kid!If it weren\u2019t for knowing that he was a troublesome young lad, any other parent wouldn\u2019t have the time to come and look for him every day.She wanted to find a chance to chat with Dawang, to at least let him know that his mother was changing, but he refused to give her a chance.Ever since she expressed her intentions to talk to him, he avoided his mother as if she was a plague with the senses of a wolf.Lin Lan was also powerless; it seemed that breaking the ice still needed some work.The old lady outside was making a fuss, \u201cWhere is Old Two? Did he come back yet? Hurry up and borrow a bike from the team to take me to the county post office! Hurry up, I have to get the money back quickly. My eyelids are twitching like crazy and I feel like something bad is happening.\u201dThe premonition was not good.When it came to money, the old lady couldn\u2019t even bear to wait for a second.But even if she were to ride a bicycle, it was going to take her an entire evening to come back, so it was inevitable to wait for Old Two to finish his work before she could go.Lin Lan didn\u2019t take the initiative to confess seeing that they were busy, so she only wondered how to deal with the old lady.After dinner, Lin Lan prepared to go to work, but the Han family\u2019s second sister-in-law said she had a headache and asked for a sick leave to rest at home.Because Xiaowang had glasses and refused to play at home, he had to go with Sanwang and Erwang to mow the grass. Lin Lan told his brothers to take good care of their younger brother, so she let them go.Although Erwang was slightly cunning, he was also wary and careful, so it was safe for him to watch over the younger children.At the county post office.The old lady Han sprawled her hands on the counter, looking at the staff\u2019s hands eagerly.When she heard that a person named Lin Lan had taken away 260 Yuan a few days ago, she felt her heart drop to the bottom, cracking into smithereens as if it was made out of glass.\u201cMother! This bastard daughter-in-law has gotten so brave to the point where-\u201cWithout waiting for her to slap her thighs and cry out in agony, Old Two hurriedly supported her, \u201cMother, what are you still hesitating for? Let\u2019s go home and ask her to get the money back.\u201dThis Old Third\u2019s Family was indeed a handful\u2014 she used to think that Lin Lan was stupid and contrived, but she didn\u2019t expect her to be so cautious and sly to the extent where she would secretly withdraw the money that was meant for the family and remain silent about it entirely.The old lady Han initially wanted to cry. But after hearing what her son said, she didn\u2019t care to look at the two that stood by her side as she hurried home.On the way, she gritted her teeth and became fierce. When she got home, she must teach the shrew what it meant to\u2026Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31In the evening, Lin Lan returned from work.The heat, tiredness and soreness made the hairs on her skin stand upright. These were her true feelings after she went to the cotton field to pick up insects. She really couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t ever do any physical work.Anyway, everyone was avoiding her. Since she didn\u2019t need to cross herself just to please others, she went home directly after work.As she was walking, she suddenly heard some cries of beatings and scoldings as well as the wails of children.Every family lived in a bungalow yard. Even the neighbours\u2019 voices were largely audible, let alone cries of pain.Who the heck is that unreasonable to the point where they have nothing else to do but inflict physical beatings on children?After pondering for a minute, Lin Lan realised afterwards\u2014 it was her own home!Unexpectedly, this home could still incur a fight even if the shrew herself wasn\u2019t home!She ran home quickly, \u201cWhy are you doing this? Why can\u2019t we talk it out if there\u2019s something that has to be said\u2026Wang Xiufen, why are you beating my son!\u201dShe saw the second sister-in-law holding a pitch-black fire plough in her hand, pulling Sanwang\u2019s slender arm and lashing at it headlessly.Maisui and the second sister-in-law\u2019s daughters were huddled together whereas Erwang followed the eldest sister-in-law to persuade one after the other, shouting, \u201cDon\u2019t fight, don\u2019t fight!\u201dWhere is Xiaowang?Lin Lan hurriedly looked around before she saw Xiaowang lying on the ground outside the west window with blood on his face!Her heart suddenly felt sore, as if it was impaled with a needle.\u00a0God damn! Taking advantage of this woman not being at home, you sneak up and dared to beat up my kids? You think you\u2019re some sort of hotshot, don\u2019t you?Pulling hair and scratching faces was not Lin Lan\u2019s style but she wasn\u2019t one to waste time on nonsense either. She drew a stick from the haystack at the base of the south wall as she raised her hand and drew it towards the Han family\u2019s Old Two\u2019s wife.\u201cYou hit my child, I\u2019ll hit you back!\u201d\u2026The second sister-in-law of the Han family was beating Sanwang with enthusiasm until she was suddenly slapped with a stick as she screamed in pain.Lin Lan didn\u2019t say a word as she continued to flog her with the thick poplar stick that was used in shaping biscuits.\u00a0Weren\u2019t you capable of bearing the pain? Keep hitting then!After hitting her a few times more, she left her sister-in-law and ran towards Xiaowang.The second sister-in-law of the Han family thought that Lin Lan was going crazy to kill her, so she jumped and ran away. However, she panicked and slammed into the wall of the hut in the southwest corner.With a \u2018pang\u2019, Han family\u2019s second sister-in-law swayed chaotically as her mind was bewildered.Her head hurt and itched slightly as it became a little numb as well. She raised her hand and scratched the bump. Feeling a slimy substance, she took her hand off and took a glance, \u201cBlood, ahhhh\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019m bleeding! My head is broken! I\u2019m dying!\u201dThen she felt a cold feeling crash through her forehead. Something was flowing down and her eyes were suddenly covered in red.\u201cAh-\u201cThe second sister-in-law of the Han family felt her body become lax and she limply collapsed on the ground. She couldn\u2019t get up no matter how much she tried to, but she felt like she was going to die soon.Everyone in the yard were shocked as the eldest sister-in-law hurriedly said, \u201cOh, goodness, don\u2019t die because of this.\u201dThe children of Han\u2019s second sister-in-law\u2019s family also ran over to see their own mother.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Second sister-in-law hurriedly ordered the older child to call the barefoot doctor to bandage her wounds.Lin Lan didn\u2019t care about her, so she hugged Xiaowang and asked Maisui, who was in a daze, to fetch them some water.\u201cMother~\u201d Xiaowang frowned and called out.Lin Lan hurriedly responded, \u201cXiaowang, where are you feeling uncomfortable? Do you feel dizzy?\u201dShe checked and found a big bump on Xiaowang\u2019s head. The blood on his face was caused by a broken nose, which had shed a lot of blood, but it had already congealed by itself.Xiaowang said weakly, \u201cMother, I\u2019m fine.\u201dErwang brought the water basin from Maisui, \u201cMother, let Xiaowang wash himself up quickly.\u201dLin Lan wiped Xiaowang gently to wash the blood on his face for fear of hurting him.Xiaowang was rather happy, \u201cMother, it doesn\u2019t hurt~\u201dThis child was so sensible to the point where Lin Lan felt even more distressed. Such a little child who was originally anaemic had shed so much blood\u2014how pitiful.While washing, the old lady Han arrived at the door of the house. Before Old Two stopped the bicycle, she jumped down and staggered to run home.As soon as she entered the yard, her eyes locked on Lin Lan like a lioness hunting locked her prey as she ignored everyone else.\u201cYou insolent thief!\u201d The old lady Han was so angry that her teeth hurt. She picked up the dark fire plough from the ground and rushed to Lin Lan to hit her head and face.While beating and cursing, \u201cYou thief! You\u2019re a bad person, a lost star, a failed child! You stole my money! You have the guts to do that now, don\u2019t you? You went behind my back to get the money! Scram! Scram back to your family; the Han family cannot afford to raise you!\u201dThough she could dodge, Lin Lan was afraid that she would hit Xiaowang, so she had to use her body to protect him. The stick hit squarely on her arms, shoulders and back as the pain made her tears flow out uncontrollably.Sanwang hurriedly protected Lin Lan while Maisui cried in fright on the sidelines. Erwang ran over to pull the old lady, \u201cDon\u2019t hit her! Don\u2019t hit my mother!\u201dThe old lady Han was crazy.\u201cAre you done?!\u201d Lin Lan was angry and she fought to win the fire plough from her grasp.Eldest sister-in-law was so scared that she hurriedly called her, \u201cThird Family, you can\u2019t beat mother!\u201d\u2026A tractor stopped on the South Road and a tall and upright man jumped off of it. He was dressed in military uniform and carried a military backpack that was half his size.He waved to the driver, lifted the shoulder strap of the backpack and strode towards Shanzui Village.Some people looked at him and asked around.\u201cOh, isn\u2019t that the third son of the Han family?\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah, Qingsong is back!\u201dAt this time, a few children ran out of the alley in a panic as they stood on the street and shouted, \u201cCome everyone! The Third madam is going insane! She\u2019s going to kill my mother and my grandmother-\u201cHan Qingsong\u2019s vigorous steps suddenly became heavier.\u2026In the small courtyard, Lin Lan was holding onto a fire plough. Her arms and shoulders were burning with aching pain as she glared at the old lady Han\u2014 she was embarrassed to beat an old woman after all.She slapped the fire plough severely and threw it on the ground.The old lady Han was convinced that Lin Lan would not have the guts to beat her. No matter how much trouble the youngsters made, they were nothing more than children who only knew how to cry, break into a tantrum or curse her behind her back. No one really dared to scold the old lady directly in the face, let alone beat her.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hurry and pay it back to the mother soon\u2014 that is the family\u2019s survival money.\u201dThe old lady Han was dizzy and she was experiencing a bout of tinnitus. She turned around while looking for a stick to beat Lin Lan with, \u201cYou got good skills now! I thought you were an idiot all along! Who would have thought that with your cunning self hidden behind your demonic persona, you would know how to steal the marriage certificate to get money as well!\u201d\u201cHow can I \u2018steal\u2019 my marriage certificate?

It\u2019s all spent,\u201d Lin Lan looked innocent, \u201cHow can only 200 be enough? How can Xiaowang\u2019s eyes cost only 1000 yuan? I still owe seven or eight hundred Yuan\u2026\u201d\u201cAh-you failed child! I-I had it with you!\u201d The old lady Han\u2019s sky collapsed and she yelled, bending her head and slamming towards Lin Lan.And why would Lin Lan gladly take the blow? She hurriedly avoided it, only to see old lady Han hitting the wall of the East Chamber before she could stop.If she really hit it, she guessed that her head would probably start bleeding, so Lin Lan subconsciously pushed her to change direction and throw her southwards to make sure that she would not hit the wall.\u201cHey!\u201d The old lady Han thrusted her head to the ground.A pair of sturdy and powerful hands held her, lest she would end up rolling on the ground.The visitor was dressed in a green military uniform and his face was cold, but even that could not hide his heroic appearance.The old lady burst into tears immediately, \u201cMy Old Three, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to see your mother if you had been one step later. Your mother is going to be beaten to death by your shrew of a wife!\u201d\u201cQuick! Quickly send her back to the Lin family! Our old Han family can\u2019t afford to take care of her-\u201cWhat a coincidence!Lin Lan raised her eyebrows and stared in dissatisfaction as her sight locked onto a pair of pitch-black eyes. Those eyes were as sharp as a falcon as they stared back at her, exuding a coercion that made the tension around them unbearable.Seeing how serious he looked, Lin Lan asked herself,\u00a0should I throw a tantrum like the original owner or remain cold and unyielding?How should one react when a husband meets his wife? What kind of scene should be depicted?She didn\u2019t know because she was completely inexperienced in that area.How awkward.Lin Lan decisively led Xiao Wang into the house, leaving the complaining old lady Han and Han Qingsong outside.She endured the pain in her arms and shoulders as she carried Xiaowang onto the kang. Then, she tried to find something to disperse the blood congestion on Xiaowang\u2019s forehead to avoid it from forming a nasty bruise later on.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When you\u2019re not at home, she acts like no laws apply to her. She does this every day and we can\u2019t even live properly.

Several children gazed at him curiously, but no one dared to meet his eyes as they all avoided him in fear.There were even a few timid kids hiding behind the older ones.Han Qingsong directed his attention to the eldest sister-in-law and after calling her, she looked towards him as he nodded his head. She then sprang into action to distract old lady Han, \u201cMother, is your waist okay?\u201dHe also tried to help the old lady into the house to rest.But the old lady refused as she grabbed his big hands forcefully, \u201cOld Three, hurry up and annul her back to the Lin family; our old Han family can\u2019t afford to take care of her. The Han family has lost its reputation by now and I can see that you don\u2019t take her seriously. She is such a shameless woman and she probably thinks that she has done a marvellous job at spending the money in secret, she\u2026\u201dThe old lady remembered that there were 260 Yuan, which was 40 Yuan more than what he usually provided them with. The pain in her heart grew as her mood dampened even more.She didn\u2019t believe that Lin Lan had spent it entirely, but in front of Old Three, she couldn\u2019t just tie his wife up and search her belongings; she had to think about her son\u2019s image as well.The old lady said inexplicably, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore, just hurry up and drive her out of this house! She even drank pesticides two days ago; what a waste it was to save her!\u201dHan Qingsong frowned, \u201cMother?\u201dSeeing that her son had yet to back her up on her claims, old lady Han immediately began to cry again, \u201cOld Three, our family can\u2019t survive; we\u2019re going to starve to death. The younger ones are in such a pitiful state as there\u2019s no food on the table. It was already so hard to pull off such a big promise to go to the county\u2019s school to study, but now we don\u2019t even have the funds or the grains to sustain that\u2014 how pitiful! \u201cSister-in-law Han hurried to persuade her, \u201cMother, third uncle is back, don\u2019t cry.

The old man Han asked him to go into the room to rest before inquiring with the eldest sister-in-law if the meal was ready.At this time, the sun had set. They were going to eat when the sun was still in the sky, because when it got dark, they would have to light up oil lamps in order to see.The Han\u2019s eldest sister-in-law replied quickly, saying that it was almost done as she brought her daughter into the house to prepare.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35It was actually only halfway complete as she turned up the heat.Eldest brother Han said, \u201cOld Three is back so quickly stir-fry a few dishes and make a few salted eggs. Father and I would be having a drink with him till late.\u201dThe old man added, \u201cAnd your uncle Dada\u2014call them all and let\u2019s have a chat.\u201dSeeing this, old lady Han waved her hands angrily, \u201cWhat are you doing? Let\u2019s get down to business first. There\u2019s a thief at home, so we must have a meeting to fight her!\u201dOld man Han and eldest brother Han still didn\u2019t know what was going on. Eldest sister-in-law glanced at Han Qingsong and euphemistically told them about Lin Lan stealing the marriage certificate to claim the money.Old man Han was stunned and his mouth couldn\u2019t close. What kind of ability does the third daughter-in-law have? She even dared to steal the marriage certificate to get the money?Under his impression, the third daughter-in-law was only capable of making a fuss. For example, when the eldest sister-in-law divided the money for the New Year, the eldest sister-in-law and the second sister-in-law were granted 5 Yuan but she only got 3 Yuan. Then, she became upset and threw a tantrum, saying that everyone would only bully her and pretend she was dead. She then let out a string of words that cursed her husband\u2019s death and stated that she didn\u2019t have a husband to begin with. After that, she would start to beat and yell at her children before seeking more horrifying ways to get attention\u2014 expressing her will to commit suicide.He didn\u2019t know about the reason behind the pesticide-drinking incident but his wife did explain, \u201cIt was probably because she wanted a few dollars to go back to her parents\u2019 house a few days ago. I didn\u2019t agree, so she started actually doing it,\u201d The old man was still a little puzzled. If the first request was ignored, she could have asked for a lesser sum; if twice her request was rejected, there wasn\u2019t the need to drink pesticides either.A woman who would only make a fuss and seek her own death when encountering a problem, never bold enough to confront her mother-in-law, would be daring enough to steal money now?Although the old lady Han never failed to mention that the Third Family was pissing her off daily and were never respectful towards her, even when they argued, Lin Lan\u2019s words were mostly all talk and just words that spewed out of anger. Despite all the previous fights, never once did she dare to directly criticise the old lady Han.Hence, old man Han only thought that the previous incident was just a matter to be settled on their own as it had nothing to do with him.However, stealing 260 Yuan was no small matter.Old man Han said nothing.Eldest brother Han also tried to smooth things out and asked his sister-in-law to get the money back.His eldest sister-in-law replied, \u201cThe third sister-in-law said that she has already spent all of the money.\u201dOld man Han was shocked, \u201cIt\u2019s all gone? What did she buy? There are no tickets out there, so what can she buy?\u201dIt\u2019s not a mere 10 or 50 Yuan!The old lady Han said angrily, \u201cWho knows to whom she gave it to!\u201dIt must have been secretly sent back to her parents\u2019 home. They must have told her to obtain the Old Three\u2019s money from his family whenever she got the chance!Han Qingsong didn\u2019t know what was going on at home. He heard that Lin Lan took the money but didn\u2019t give it to the old lady, so she refused to forgive her.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36It\u2019s just that he thought things were a little strange. Back in the day, when she grumbled and fussed about how the old lady Han was taking all the money, she wasn\u2019t spared a single cent despite the protests. Even after he added her name to the remittance slip for several years, she didn\u2019t dare to even take a penny out of it, so how was she so bold this time?Old lady Han exclaimed out of anger because she couldn\u2019t get the money. Then, she thought about Old Three\u2019s backpack, so she instructed the children in the second room to carry the backpack over. Because it was too heavy, it was difficult for the children to carry it unless they worked together.Sanwang went up to stop them and said that it was his father\u2019s bag. He questioned their rights to take his father\u2019s backpack, but in the end, he was just pushed aside.Sanwang got angry and shouted in rage \u201cFine! That\u2019s not my father\u2019s! It\u2019s no wonder that everybody has their own fathers but I don\u2019t!\u201dAfter he shouted, he ran out.Erwang was initially standing in the main room to eavesdrop on the commotion, but as he met Han Qingsong\u2019s gaze, he became so frightened that he hurried to the east wing.Maisui stood at the door of the east wing as she looked at the main house. Despite the conflicting emotions, she finally returned to the east wing in pique.Lin Lan was twisting a handkerchief with cold water before she placed it on Xiaowang\u2019s forehead. Seeing their angered appearance, she smiled and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You guys look as angry as toads with your cheeks puffed up.\u201dErwang was lying by the window, \u201cMom, aren\u2019t you angry? Our father just ignored us upon coming back and will only listen to grandma and the others. You see, a lot of things that he brought back were even taken away by grandma.\u201dOld lady Han was turning over the backpack. There were clothes, quilts, shoes, and some books. Naturally, there were also some goods such as canned food, malted milk, snacks, and candies.She poured it all out and she must take the food for herself.\u00a0 She thought that her youngest son adored military uniforms the most, so she set them aside for him. Seeing that the quilt was thick and light, it should be sent to the youngest daughter who was still attending school\u2026Han Qingsong saw the mess and he walked over, \u201cMother, take a break, I\u2019ll do it.\u201dMother is already of such old age, so how could he bother her to pack his bags?The old lady Han wanted to take those things, so she was naturally willing to clean them up. However, Han Qingsong on the other hand, was worried that she would tire herself out, so he put all the things back inside the backpack with his large hand.In the end, he put the malted milk and the bag of candies on the table. He gave the malted milk to the old lady and let the children have the candies, \u201cMother, I will put the luggage in the house.\u201dThe old lady Han was speechless and almost choked herself to death as she watched Han Qingsong take all those things away.He then shouted that there were goodies for the kids, so the children all rushed over to ask for the candy.The old lady Han said angrily, \u201cAll of you get lost!\u201dShe hurriedly put away the malted milk before splitting the candies. Older children get one each whereas younger children divided one into two to share; the rest were kept by her.\u201cOld man, you better remember this. You must send the bad guy back to her house as it\u2019s a scourge for her to stay at home.\u201dAnd when she goes back, she must return me the 260 Yuan\u2014 not a single penny shall be less!Old man Han sighed and mumbled, \u201cOld Three is an officer; what happens with his marriage is not up to the parents to decide.\u201dBut old lady Han didn\u2019t care.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37In the east wing, Lin Lan was about to ask Erwang to bring Dawang and Sanwang back, but the two children rushed back like scurrying mice as if their tails had been trampled on. Then, they stood beside her as if they were the commanding officers of the law, eager to protect her.Immediately afterwards, the light at the door dimmed and someone came in from outside.Han Qingsong was too tall and the lintel was short, so he could only walk in with his shoulders lowered.Carrying a huge backpack, he was tall and lean with muscle. When he stood in the dimly lit area, the whole room suddenly seemed to be even more cramped.Lin Lan suddenly felt the pressure of his presence. The person standing there made her feel very oppressed as the place she was struck at felt particularly painful.She said to the children, \u201cYour father is back, why haven\u2019t you greeted him?\u201dErwang greeted him with one word, \u2018father\u2019.Xiaowang didn\u2019t say anything but his nerves skyrocketed and Maisui remained pouting.Lin Lan saw that his figure was a little stiff and she suddenly gained a bit of confidence. Pretending to be relaxed, she spoke, \u201cGrandpa asked you to annul me? This is the New Republic of China, not the old feudal, so it is impossible for you to annul me(1). Divorce at most is what we can do. Since you want to divorce me, we have to make it clear. Let the children choose who they want to stay with from now on\u2026\u201d(T/N: Divorcing is the act of ending the marriage, but annulment would be as if the marriage never existed in the first place. It\u2019s important because annulments would have less issues to deal with\u2014 financially cheaper, property-division is nonexistent and overall, not considered a legal marriage. )\u201cMom!\u201d The three children shouted.Xiaowang got up quickly and put his arms around Lin Lan\u2019s arm, \u201cI want mom.\u201d Although he didn\u2019t understand what divorce was, the fact that he would follow his mother would not change.Maisui and Erwang also hesitated before they said that they would follow their mother. Grandma treats them badly, so if mother leaves and father finds a stepmother, would they still have a good outcome in this familyMany of their friends in the village have stepmothers, so they knew exactly what their future lives would be.As for her, she couldn\u2019t even think about it.Lin Lan patted their heads, motioning for them to calm down before she asked Xiaowang to lie down and put a cool towel over his forehead.She looked at Han Qingsong who was standing at the door, but his expression was even more sharp and oppressive.She felt a little uncomfortable, causing her to move her body and change her angle of perception. She was no longer looking directly into his eyes as she gazed at his chin.His expression was cold and his chin was particularly tense.\u201cIf we get divorced, you have to provide us with alimony. Not only would it be entitled to the children, but I have to have a share of that as well.\u201dHan Qingsong remained silent as his frame was shielded by the dark. However, he soon started to walk towards her.He wouldn\u2019t hit me, right?Although Lin Lan was sure that he wouldn\u2019t raise a hand against women based on his personality that was written in the book, when he approached, she felt an invisible chill of cold air rushing towards her, forcing her to fidget involuntarily.Han Qingsong walked closer as he raised his hand and put his backpack on the kang.Erwang and Maisui immediately stared at the backpack\u2014there was a horde of delicious food in it!The house was not big to begin with, so logically, the kang was even smaller.Xiaowang was lying in the middle as she stood in front of the kang to take care of him. But when he came towards her, the narrow room seemed to make it even harder for her to breathe.Just as Lin Lan was about to make an excuse to go out for a walk, he suddenly leaned over, making her back away hurriedly. His masculine hormones drowned her like a river and the impact was still too great for Lin Lan.Although they were husband and wife, he was a stranger to her.Han Qingsong took off the towel and looked at Xiaowang\u2019s forehead. His voice was slightly soft as he spoke, \u201cHow did you end up like this?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Lin Lan twitched the corners of her mouth. Did he say that to imply that she wasn\u2019t good at taking care of their children?Men were such scumbags\u2014 if they didn\u2019t see women working hard, they would automatically put the blame on them.She gave Erwang a look.She was busy fending off the attacks before so she didn\u2019t have time to ask what was going on, but she didn\u2019t have to think about it\u2014she instinctively knew that it was related to the second sister-in-law.Erwang understood, \u201cFather, you have to seek justice for us. When you\u2019re not at home, they bully my mother and us children all day long. Mother took Xiaowang to the county hospital for treatment and came back with a pair of glasses. But grandma and second aunt would refute every single one of our reasoning and proceed to drive us out of the house.\u201dTriggering his emotions as he spoke, Erwang began to wipe away his tears and sobbed, \u201cFather, if you hadn\u2019t come back, my grandma would have tied up my mother and fought her, wuuu(1)\u2026\u201d(T/N: It\u2019s an Onomatopoeia for Chinese cries. Sometimes, the spelling may differ depending on how many characters are written)\u201cGet to the main point,\u201d Han Qingsong put the towel back on Xiaowang.Xiao Wang threw the towel back as he was holding onto Lin Lan\u2019s hand.Han Qingsong, \u201c\u2026\u201dErwang continued, \u201cIt was mother who gave Xiaowang a pair of glasses and the second aunt didn\u2019t seem very pleased about him getting the glasses, so she didn\u2019t go to work in the afternoon. I brought Xiaowang back from mowing the grass and she claimed that he was an obstruction so she pushed him on the ground. Xiaowang fell on his nose and his glasses fell to the ground. Second aunt couldn\u2019t resolve her hatred and jealousy, so she stepped on it. Sanwang and I had tried to reason with her, but she took a poplar stick and beat him up\u2026 isn\u2019t that right, second sister?\u201dSpeaking of the matter, Erwang went to the straw box that was on the sides and took out Xiaowang\u2019s glasses. The crystal lenses had fallen off, but the frame was still intact despite one of the glasses\u2019 legs being broken.Maisui and Erwang were twins, so she had an extra voice backing her up. The girl tugged at the hair that was pulled to the point where it resembled a chicken coop as she angrily added, \u201cThat\u2019s right! I went to restrict second aunt, but Gaoliang came and tugged onto my hair! \u201cGaoliang was the daughter of the second house that belonged to the second uncle and aunt. She was also one year older than Maisui.Maisui also began to recount the events with grief and didn\u2019t dare to look for Han Qingsong to act coquettishly. Hence, she said to Lin Lan, \u201cMother, look at my head! My scalp hurts so badly\u2014 do you think it was damaged by Gaoliang?\u201dThe room was not bright, so it was impossible to see it clearly. Despite that, Lin Lan still said, \u201cPerhaps there\u2019s a little bit of damage. Look, that part of your scalp is already bleeding.\u201dHan Qingsong looked at her\u2014 this was the first time his wife ever spoke so calmly and methodically.At this time, the old lady appeared outside the window with her face full of anger, \u201cWhy did Old Three complain as soon as he came back?\u201d She hurriedly entered the house, \u201cTake out the 260 yuan first!\u201dIt just so happened that the second brother Han and the second sister-in-law Wang Xiufen also came back. Wang Xiufen rushed in and started scolding Lin Lan.\u201cThird brother, look at your second sister-in-law. I\u2019m in such a pitiful state because she almost killed me! Tell me, how dark-hearted you are\u2014 Forget about hitting my head with the stick, you even pushed me against the wall and made me bleed-\u201cPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39From there on, Old Lady Han continued as she cut her off, \u201cNot just that, she even hurt me too. She even wanted to hurt an elder like me and pushed me to the wall as if she wanted me to hit my head and die! If it weren\u2019t for Old Three who held onto me later, I\u2019m afraid I wouldn\u2019t have made it out alive!\u201dLin Lan watched them twist their words to suit their narrative as she cleared her throat.\u00a0Relying on Han Qingsong\u2019s return to give him a show, aren\u2019t you all? Fine then, it\u2019s my turn to take part in the acting roles!She looked at the old lady, \u201cI\u2019ll say mother, why are you still lying when you are this old? You bumped your head over towards me and I was afraid that you would hit your head against the wall with how fast you were heading. Even if you didn\u2019t appreciate it, you shouldn\u2019t have wronged a good person. And second sister-in-law, I\u2019m not done with you yet so I\u2019ll settle my accounts with you now. My children\u2019s father earns allowances to support our whole family by being in the army and I work every day to earn work points as well. I won\u2019t say anything if you avoid labor by remaining at home, yet you took advantage of my absence at home and pushed Sanwang on a rock and even used a stick to hit him? And that\u2019s something that I saw\u2014 could it be that you\u2019re hitting him every waking hour of the day when I\u2019m not present?\u201dThe old lady and the others were stunned. Unexpectedly, Lin Lan, who would cry and protest when she faced an unfavorable situation, could speak so fluently and sarcastically. No one interrupted her words due to the shock of her fluency.Wang Xiufen was so wronged;\u00a0what the heck did she mean by \u2018every waking hour of the day\u2019? What was \u2018avoiding labor\u2019? You\u2019re the one avoiding labor, aren\u2019t you? I just took a break for one day!Just as the old lady and Wang Xiufen were about to speak up for themselves, Lin Lan said first, \u201cAt any rate, let me reason with you about the matter of funds and spendings\u2014 since that\u2019s the only thing that you guys care about so gravely. Xiaowang was sick and we went to the doctor, so what\u2019s wrong with that? Why don\u2019t you see the good in me and instead, you guys tried to beat me up to death and also force me through a divorce. Isn\u2019t Xiaowang his father\u2019s son? Shouldn\u2019t he\u00a0 see a doctor with the money his father earns? I\u2019d dare to report this to the County Revolutionary Committee! Anyway, the money is all spent, so you don\u2019t have to think about getting it from me. Even if you beat me to death, I wouldn\u2019t be able to return it to you!\u201d\u201cBullshit, bullshit!\u201dAnother commotion broke out in the small room. Despite the eldest sister-in-law\u2019s cries to get them to eat, her voice was drowned out by the chaos in the room.Han Qingsong frowned and yelled, \u201cStop!\u201dThe noise disappeared instantly.Everyone looked at each other before they started to rant again.Han Qingsong motioned for them to go out and said that the room was too crowded. The rants and arguments of the three women were more than capable of making the air boil.When they all went out, Han Qingsong glanced at Lin Lan and motioned for her to go out and talk as well.Taking advantage of their absence from the room, Lin Lan slammed the door shut.Han Qingsong felt the gust of wind formed by the slamming of the door as his clothes ruffled along. His body jerked from the shock of the force as his eyebrows twitched slightly.Old Lady Han grabbed his arm, \u201cOld Three, you see what I\u2019m trying to tell you? What are you waiting for?!\u201dSecond sister-in-law, \u201cThird brother, what are you waiting for?! She even dares to beat your mother!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Han Qingsong looked at them before he glanced at the Old Man Han who was standing at the door of the main room. These people were all pressuring him to break up with Lin Lan.Lin Lan couldn\u2019t stand to see them being so arrogant so she said through the window, \u201cDivorcing is fine, but the alimony cannot be discounted for. It costs at least 12 Yuan a month for a child and 20 for an adult\u2014 go figure.\u201dSure enough, Han Qingsong didn\u2019t say anything and the Old Lady Han was going to jump up and down with rage once more.The Han family\u2019s eldest sister-in-law and her husband advised, \u201cMother, third brother has come all the way back from camp. He\u2019s probably tired and hungry, so let\u2019s eat first.\u201dIt was already dark.The Old Lady Han muttered, \u201cThe food in the army is better than ours, anyway. Every day, they eat a lavish serving of white noodles and meat, so what are you worrying about?\u201d\u00a0Besides, Old Three has so many goods with him, how is it possible that he wouldn\u2019t snack on something good on the way home?If it were up to her, she didn\u2019t feel like eating if she wasn\u2019t able to get the money back. How was she supposed to have the appetite to eat when she encountered such financial loss? The entire family should eat until they get the money back.Since it got dark, they could only light the lights in the main room as the Old Lady Han started to nag about the waste of fuel that was all caused by a certain unfilial person.The eldest sister-in-law was quite embarrassed as she gave a look of apology to the third brother. Old Three had just returned, so the least they could do was cut him some slack and think about his image; yet the old lady was criticizing his wife in front of his face.During the meal, no one came out of the East Wing. Old Man Han was upset as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s already time to eat, how many times should she be invited?\u201dThough, Old Lady Han wished they wouldn\u2019t come out to eat.Han Qingsong, \u201cI\u2019ll get them.\u201dHe went to the window and heard some low mutters from the room. Probably because of his presence, the faint sounds instantly became silent. He didn\u2019t speak through the window, but pushed the door as he went in, \u201cLet\u2019s eat first.\u201dThere was no light in the room and no one responded.His eyes got used to the dark and there, he saw Lin Lan laying on the kang with Xiaowang in her arms, whereas Maisui and Erwang were chatting there.The voices weren\u2019t this nasally just now, though.Han Qingsong, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dMaisui burst into tears, \u201cDad, look at mother\u2019s arms. Her shoulders and back are all purple with bruises.\u201dHearing that, Han Qingsong stepped forward and said, \u201cLight the lamp.\u201dErwang pursed his lips, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any lights in our room. Grandma said that we eat at dawn, sleep at night, and the sky will light up when we\u2019re awake, so what\u2019s the point of owning lights? She took the oil lamps to the youngest aunt and uncle\u2019s rooms.\u201dHan Qingsong, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe turned and walked out.Maisui said nervously, \u201cFather is angry.\u201dErwang immediately said to Lin Lan, \u201cMother, look at my father; he only has other people in his heart and never a place for us. Grandma\u2019s room, eldest aunt, second aunt and all the other rooms have lamps; we\u2019re the only ones left out!\u201dLin Lan secretly thought that this kid had a lot to say. Regardless, it didn\u2019t matter if Han Qingsong heard it or not; what\u2019s said was said, after all.But he must have thought that she taught Erwang to say so.She didn\u2019t expect that Erwang, who had a lot of sly intentions, would be willing to guard her instead of fsucking up to his father.Perhaps because of the fact that he was still quite young, his heart wasn\u2019t as cold or as selfish as it was in the original plot. Maybe, there was a chance that warmth could take place in it gradually.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41After a while, footsteps were heard outside once more.Han Qingsong strode in, enveloped in a warm yellow light and he actually held an oil lamp.Erwang and Maisui\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up as they realized that their father remained their father forevermore\u2014 he didn\u2019t leave in anger, but he just went to get the lamp.It seemed like complaining was rather useful.Han Qingsong placed the oil lamp in the lamphouse that was dug in the wall of the room. That area was made to place the lamp against the wind to make sure it wouldn\u2019t blow out easily.He put his hand into his backpack and rummaged around before he took out a large bottle the size of a palm. He put it on the kang and reached out to pull Lin Lan\u2019s shoulder.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lin Lan subconsciously avoided his hand.Han Qingsong, \u201cI\u2019m going to rub some medicine to disperse the congestion.\u201dLin Lan looked at the bottle of medicinal ointment that appeared to be pretty dark, \u201cI will do it myself.\u201dErwang immediately said, \u201cMother, I\u2019ll help you,\u201d He lifted Lin Lan\u2019s arm all of a sudden and pushed up half of her sleeves, revealing bruises from her arms to her shoulders\u2014 all of which were caused by Old Lady Han.\u201cMother, why do you think grandma is so cruel? You asked for money to help Xiaowang see a doctor but she wouldn\u2019t spare you a single penny. Then you didn\u2019t spend the money indiscriminately, but she even tried to beat you to death. Wuuuu~\u201dHe said it as if he truly cared about her, but Lin Lan pursed her lips, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201dGod damn it, it hurts like hell. It\u2019s a lie if I say it doesn\u2019t hurt. It\u2019s burning like crap and I don\u2019t think I can lift my arms.Maisui really started to cry as she thought about the time when she knocked her youngest aunt\u2019s flower cream onto the ground by accident. She was beaten with a rolling pin by her youngest aunt and her grandmother, but even though it was a brief punishment, it was painful.She knew that it was going to be a lot more painful for her mother as she saw her state.She cried even more when she thought about the fact that her father was not always home as he needed to earn wages for the family. Despite the money being her father\u2019s, her grandma never gave her a share of it to spend and only dolled up her youngest aunt with it. With that thought in mind, she cried even more desperately.Lin Lan felt like she was watching a fire(1), but it wasn\u2019t easy for her to say anything. Fine then, seeing a relative that she didn\u2019t have the chance to see a lot, Lin Lan felt that it was alright to let her cry it all out.(T/N: A saying to describe someone who observed a situation very clearly)Crying was the best form of complaint, after all.Just as she was letting her thoughts run wild, her arm was held by Han Qingsong.The heat exuding from his body was astonishing. When he approached, Lin Lan felt a masculine aura blowing towards her, let alone his hot palm that felt as if it could burn her.She was uncomfortable, hence the struggle, but was held by him effortlessly.\u201cHold still.\u201dHe unscrewed the cap of the medicine with one hand and poured a bit of the medicinal ointment in the palm of his hand. After rubbing it a few times, he held Lin Lan\u2019s arm and began to massage the medication over it.\u201cAh\u2014\u201d The splitting pain caused Lin Lan to sit up abruptly, \u201cIt hurts, it hurts, it hurts\u2026\u201dIt was very painful.His strength is practically carving my skin!Is this his way of getting back at me?Han Qingsong was at odds; he didn\u2019t exert any strength at all. If it were the soldiers under his command, he would have rubbed it hard without much thought, uncaring towards the fact that they were sweating from the pain.Lin Lan blinked back her tears, \u201cI- I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42\u201cAre you guys eating or what?!\u201d Old Lady Han had been eavesdropping outside for a while. She was so angry that she shouted at the top of her voice.Han Qingsong responded to her with a loud hum.He placed the medicinal alcohol on the shelf of the wall, \u201cYou two bring the food here for your mother and brother.\u201dErwang laughed exaggeratedly when he heard it, \u201cFather, you don\u2019t know the rules of our family. Our grandmother said, \u2018if you won\u2019t eat, then starve\u2019, so what\u2019s the point of bringing the food here?!\u201dOutside, the Old Lady Han was so angry that she asked someone to bring her a stick.Han Qingsong, \u201cDon\u2019t be disrespectful.\u201dErwang stuck out his tongue. He thought that it was fine if his father told his grandmother his exact words just now.He took Maisui along with him and they ran out. When he got to the main room, he quickly asked his eldest aunt to scoop up some porridge. Taking two pancakes and a bowl of several dishes, they then brought it back to the East room.Han Qingsong led the two children to the main room for dinner whereas Lin Lan relaxedly ate with Xiaowang.After the meal, the Old Lady hurriedly sent all the children on their way\u2014 the older one went to look for cicadas and the younger ones went to bed. She was going to preside over the family meeting.She shouted deliberately, \u201cWhoever dares to eavesdrop outside, I\u2019ll break their legs!\u201dErwang was so frightened that he dragged Maisui and ran away.The old lady presented the issue with her dramatic opening remarks, recalling the tough years they went through in the past, the difficulty of raising children, the agonizing suffering and pain they had to persevere through and so on.In short, it was meant to evoke Han Qingsong\u2019s distress and guilt towards his parents. After all, he hadn\u2019t been home for many years as he had to serve in the army, so he wasn\u2019t able to do much of his work as a filial son. According to the old lady\u2019s words, he was the one lavishly living in camp without a trace of worry for his next meal.Of course, she naturally left out an important part. When the rule mandated that someone from the family had to serve, the eldest son had to stay to keep things organized. The old lady\u2019s second son was someone who practically perfected the art of sweet-talking, so she felt bad for him to go. In the end, there was no other option than to send the 17-year-old third son to the army.And with that, she wouldn\u2019t think about the fact that Han Qingsong had been graced by near-death situations many more times than he could count. She also didn\u2019t know how many additional scars and injuries now decorated his body.Most of all, she didn\u2019t think about the fact that it was his hard-earned salary from the army that subsidized the entire family\u2019s livinghood.She only felt that she worked insanely hard to raise her son from a child to a man. Now that he was somewhat succeeding in life, he should spend his life repaying her efforts so she could enjoy a hassle-free life.Children should give back to their parents endlessly and unconditionally, which also meant that, if she told him to do anything, he would have to adhere to it.If she told him to annul the marriage, that\u2019s exactly what he should do!\u201cOld Three, don\u2019t you think I\u2019m right? After so many years of you being away, me and your father have gotten weary and tired. Us old folks were always tended to by your eldest, second and youngest brother. I understand that you had to be away, so I\u2019m not asking much from you work-wise. Without you at home, I also asked the others to tend to your wife and our kids a little more. Not trying to guilt-trip you, but I have been doting towards her and the kids.

    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43\u201cOld man, I\u2019ve made my decision\u2014 they will be divorced.\u201dOld Three was an officer. Even if he was divorced, would it be impossible to find a good and obedient daughter-in-law?If things went her way, he should find a wife who is the daughter of a Commander. That would truly be two peas in a pod\u2014 her status would be high enough for him and she could even aid in his promotion in the army as well.As a literate, she would know about filial piety. She wouldn\u2019t piss the family off and would even send money home\u2014 how nice would that be!The Han family\u2019s second brother and second sister-in-law clapped their hands as they agreed, \u201cMother is right. Third brother, you have to think about it.\u201dThe eldest brother and the eldest sister-in-law looked troubled, \u201cFather, mother, third sister-in-law is not that bad, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need to go for divorce. They already have a bunch of kids together; what would others think about us if they divorce and Old Three gets a new wife?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to worry about the kids? They can just stay here; with you guys and me here, how could the kids suffer?\u201d The Old Lady Han didn\u2019t see the point of that argument.She kept poking Old Han\u2019s head, trying to get him to speak.Although she could complain and rant all she wanted, it was the male parent who had the final say.The Old Man Han kept fiddling with the cigarette pot. His guilty conscience kicked in as he felt that it was a bit harsh to drive the third daughter-in-law out of the family.After all, she had given birth to a total of five children and she did her fair share of work as well as she wasn\u2019t the type to sit back and relax while the others worked.He thought that it was better for them to live separately. By doing so, they could still work together and it would prevent a lot of the sparking conflicts between her, the second sister-in-law and the old lady.\u201cOld Man, it\u2019s alright; I know you can\u2019t bring yourself to say it, so let\u2019s just leave the decision as it is,\u201d The Old Lady Han waved her hand, \u201cOld Three, go back and tell her that you will go to the Commune Revolutionary Committee tomorrow and divorce the marriage. Get her to return to the Lin family quickly\u2026\u201dThe second sister-in-law of the Han family added fuel to the flames, \u201cIt\u2019s really rare to see someone who had no second thoughts about hitting mother like that,\u201d She patted her head slightly and cried out in pain.The old man didn\u2019t say a word as he just looked at Han Qingsong.The old lady also forced him, \u201cOld Three, you have to say something, quick.\u201dThe atmosphere in the house became a little stagnant as no voices were heard. Even the swishing of the fan had stopped, and the only audible sounds were a mix of the collection of exhales and the buzzing of mosquitoes.Everyone looked nervously at Han Qingsong\u2019s mouth.At this time, his already serious face looked even more grave as his deep eyes were particularly darkened.Han Qingsong,\u201dNo.\u201d\u2026What?The old lady didn\u2019t understand; what went wrong with the offer?That one word of his was indeed a quick answer, but it wasn\u2019t the answer that she wanted to hear.The old lady\u2019s facial expressions suddenly fell, \u201cOld Three, after you\u2019ve become an officer, your wings are tough and sturdy now, so you don\u2019t see the need to respect this old woman anymore, do you?\u201dThe eldest brother of the Han family quickly nudged Han Qingsong , asking him to elaborate a little more. In response, Han Qingsong replied, \u201cMother, no.\u201dOld Lady Han was so angry. She knew for a fact that he wasn\u2019t the most eloquent when it came to speaking because everything he said would irk her. However, she thought that he would have picked up a few skills by now since he was an adult.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44\u201cThen, you\u2019re saying that I bullied your wife and children?\u201dThe Han family\u2019s eldest sister-in-law also hurried to smooth things out, \u201cMother, Old Three had always been reluctant to talk, so he isn\u2019t good at coaxing people. He didn\u2019t mean to disrespect you; he just doesn\u2019t want to divorce.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Old Lady Han almost jumped up.The Han family\u2019s second sister-in-law was afraid that she would be spreading false truths, so she hurriedly persuaded Han Qingsong to explain.Han Qingsong said, \u201cI am indeed ashamed that as a child, I haven\u2019t been able to take care of you two, who are now old.\u201dHe felt guilty towards his parents, but the same guilt applied towards his wife and children as well.\u201cFather and I are considerate, so we won\u2019t argue about that. You just need to listen to your mother\u2019s words and send back this woman who can\u2019t seem to settle for a day of peace.\u201dHan Qingsong nodded, \u201cFor the sake of mother\u2019s health, let\u2019s live separately.\u201dBy living separately, they would not eat from the same wok nor would they meet in the same courtyard. Naturally, things would be better as the anger would decrease as well.The Old Lady Han opened her mouth. She was talking about divorce; how did it end up becoming a problem of living separately?Old Three was always stupid when he was younger, but it appears that he was even more dense now.\u201cOld Man? Listen to him-\u201cOld Man Han also said, \u201cThis is also a way,\u201d He knocked the cigarette pot on the edge of the kang vigorously, \u201cSeparating the family, but not dividing our work. This way, everyone would contribute to working for the family and we can also split the rations accordingly.\u201dWithout the Old Three at home, a wife and so many children were hard to feed; she naturally had to earn her share of work as well. Of course, the allowance for the Old Three had to be sent to the extended family as well.The second sister-in-law and the second brother\u2019s brains processed the information quickly as they immediately asked, \u201cWhat about the Old Three\u2019s allowance?\u201dThe Old Lady Han said sternly, \u201cOf course it will be sent to me!\u201dAfter she finished speaking, she immediately said to him, \u201cWhat sort of nonsense are you talking about? What do you mean \u2018live separately\u2019? There\u2019s not a place for you out there, so what are you trying to do? Live on the streets?\u201dShe had forgotten she once mentioned that she would drive out Lin Lan and the children, making them sleep in the shack under the wall. Her thoughts now were preoccupied because if they truly lived separately, the shrew would have more of a reason to knock on their doors for money.But the Old Lady Han refused to ask her son to send the allowance to the shrew instead of her!She wouldn\u2019t ever allow Lin Lan to bring the children over to the army site as well. That was because they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about eating, sleeping and spending money over there. The entire family would be complete, so there wouldn\u2019t be a need to send money back here.This was her own son and she went through all the trouble before finally getting promising results. Now that he had the potential, naturally, he should be repaying them.It was only right and proper for a son to repay his parents.Han Qingsong said, \u201cI will apply for the residence from the Company Revolutionary Committee.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s not enough materials for that!\u201d Old Lady Han disagreed. At this sort of time, how could they build a house casually? There were so many families who crammed more than ten people into three rooms, even more so in tinier and cramped spaces.Although Han Qingsong had not done farm work at home these years, the troops often went to the countryside, so his knowledge about this wasn\u2019t all that shallow either.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45\u201cMother, let\u2019s build two small rooms first; it wouldn\u2019t take many materials to make,\u201d They\u2019d make do for two years first before he starts to build a new house.\u201cWhat sort of crap are you talking about?\u201d Old Old Lady Han said, \u201cThere is a shack outside the wall of the Third Master\u2019s house where firewood is usually kept. Just go and live there.\u201dThe eldest Brother of the Han family wondered, \u201cMother, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong about that? When the second son of the Liu family had no place to live when he got married, he just went to Yongshun Da\u2019s house to bunk in.\u201dHan Qingsong, \u201cI\u2019d better ask the Secretary Head first.\u201dIn the past, he was called the Secretary Head, but now he was the Director of the Company and Village Revolutionary Committee.The eldest sister-in-law hurriedly said, \u201cThey are all enjoying the shade at the Brigade Headquarters though.\u201dAt this moment, the men were basically making small talk and fooling around in the Brigade Headquarters.Han Qingsong nodded and told his parents that he was about to go.When the old lady still disagreed, the Old Man Han said, \u201cJust let him go, you\u2019re always fussing around; he is no longer a child that is a few years old and he is more than qualified to be in charge of his matters. Besides, it is inevitable for him to not visit the Secretary Head and the Captain now that he\u2019s back.\u201dOld Lady Han was still unhappy as she started pouting angrily, thinking about the allowances and the backpack that was full of items.Han Qingsong returned to the room and was startled when he saw Lin Lan doing needlework and telling stories to the children on the kang.In his memory and under his impression, this sort of scene was even more unlikely than an enemy\u2019s automatic surrender without resistance.He glanced at her, \u201cI\u2019m going to find the Secretary Head.\u201dLin Lan nodded, \u201cThen you should bring something for him as well.\u201dHe came all the way back from camp, so it made no sense for him to show up empty-handed when meeting the Secretary Head and the Captain.Han Qingsong brought his backpack over and opened the buckle. He took out two bottles of malted milk extract and grabbed two handfuls of candy.Lin Lan looked at it and pulled a piece of cloth from the clothes drying pole over the head of the kang and gave it to him to wrap it up with. This was to make sure that the items weren\u2019t too conspicuous.Malted milk extract was rare these days; not everyone can bring them home. Even if Han Qingsong came back, this wasn\u2019t something that could be simply given to others; there had to be a request that came with it.Han Qingsong pocketed his items and said, \u201cI was in a hurry to get back, so my backpack was stuffed in a mess.\u201dLin Lan looked at him,\u00a0is he implying that I should clean it?Isn\u2019t he worried that I would take the contents inside?Han Qingsong picked up the cloth and put the backpack in Lin Lan\u2019s hand. Before he left, he glanced at the children, \u201cEating a piece of candy will cause cavities if you don\u2019t take care.\u201dAfter that, he left.\u201cMother-\u201d Erwang and Maisui were excited. Did father want them to eat the candies?Lin Lan hurriedly shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to get Dawang and Sanwang to come home.\u201dThose two arrogant children were definitely used to listening to the nonsense of the men at the Brigade Headquarters. Some of the men specialised in spreading idiotic stories, so she was worried that Dawang would be affected.Listening to the sound of Han Qingsong\u2019s footsteps leaving, Lin Lan hesitated for a while but opened the backpack in the end. She reached in and tried to take something out, but the backpack was too deep and it took her entire arm\u2019s length to reach the bottom.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46The three children looked at her expectantly.Lin Lan cleared her throat and took out a large amount of candy. Just as she was about to spread the candy to them according to her habit of being lavish in her previous life, she suddenly remembered that these were Han Qingsong\u2019s and not her own.Maybe he had other uses for them, so she couldn\u2019t divide them completely like this.She counted them and put back half of it before dividing a piece of candy to each of the children whose eyes gleamed with joy.\u201cMother~~\u201d Maisui squeaked coquettishly.Lin Lan couldn\u2019t take it anymore and had to divide another piece for them, \u201cOkay, your father has other uses for these. You can hide it and eat it tomorrow. When you eat it at night, the bugs crawl into your mouth and bite your teeth.\u201dXiaowang stuffed the candy into Lin Lan\u2019s pocket, \u201cMother, keep it for me.\u201dErwang and Mai Sui couldn\u2019t wait any longer as they placed the candy in their mouths. The poor and horrendously big family was too overwhelming; only the items that reached their bellies could truly be considered as theirs.There was a risk of change should they keep it for later!\u201cMother, I\u2019ll close the door,\u201d Erwang quickly went to close the door.Lin Lan, \u201cIt\u2019s so hot, and your father and the others haven\u2019t come back yet.\u201dErwang, \u201cGrandmother won\u2019t be able to come in when she tries to.\u201dWith their father away, who knew if the old lady would come storming for the backpack.Sure enough, the old lady came and attempted to open the door. Upon finding it closed, she started yelling at them and demanding they bring the backpack to the main room.Erwang immediately tugged onto Lin Lan\u2019s sleeve.Lin Lan understood, \u201cOh, it hurts to death, my arm feels like it\u2019s crippled.\u201d\u201cMother, let father take you to the county hospital tomorrow,\u201d Erwang said.With the candy in her mouth, Maisui also vaguely said that she would rub it for her mother.Seeing that she couldn\u2019t make them budge, the old lady harrumphed loudly and went to find Han Qingsong angrily. After searching around, she couldn\u2019t locate him, so she had to come back and talk to the Old man Han and her two other sons at home.She didn\u2019t want to waste any kerosene, so she demanded they listen to her in the dark, but soon the Old Man Han snored loudly. With that, she got so enraged that she gave him a good hit.At this moment, Han Qingsong\u2019s soft voice and Sanwang\u2019s unhappy muttering echoed outside as the old lady got up all of a sudden, \u201cOld Three is back, ask him to come over quickly!\u201dThe Old Man Han woke up, \u201cIt\u2019s already so late, just go to sleep. He still has to settle things tomorrow.\u201dOld Lady Han, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t sleep if we don\u2019t explain it clearly.\u201dThe eldest brother of the Han family took the initiative to call Han Qingsong over.Dawang originally slept with his grandparents, but there was still an ongoing meeting in the room at the moment and the children were not allowed to listen. The other children went back to their parents\u2019 kangs, but he didn\u2019t want to go back to face his mother.He turned around and walked out, \u201cI\u2019m going to Zhuzi\u2019s house to sleep.\u201dSanwang looked at his father in horror before he shouted, \u201cBrother, wait, I\u2019ll go too.\u201dThe two children ran away and disappeared into the darkness. He could still hear Sanwang colliding with the tree outside the door and shouting in pain as Dawang scolded him for being stupid. Han Qingsong felt rather interested and unfamiliar as an indescribable feeling surfaced.This was a feeling that he hadn\u2019t felt before.Maybe this is life, this is home?\u201cThird brother, mother is calling you.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47The eldest son yawned; one day of chaos was too much to handle.Han Qingsong responded and put the cloth in his hand on the windowsill of the east wing before he followed him into the main room.The Old Lady Han said bluntly, \u201cOld Three, you can split up the family. I will discuss with your father and brother before we split a few of the wives out. The work will still be the same as before, so we can also divide the food and take care of them. But your allowance must be sent to your parents and you can\u2019t give it to her. You also know her temper\u2014 she goes crazy easily, so it wouldn\u2019t be wise to let her handle it. \u201cHan Qingsong hesitated but he decided to tell the truth, \u201cMother, there may be no more allowances in the future.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dNot only were the men in the room startled, but the Han family\u2019s eldest sister-in-law, who had always been a Buddhist practitioner, and the second sister-in-law exclaimed loudly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, why would you no longer have an allowance? \u201cWeren\u2019t there more and more people becoming officers these days? The entire family required his money to survive!Eldest brother Han,\u00a0did third brother make a mistake and was sent back by the troops?The old lady\u2019s hair on her skin stood up. Even the annoying buzzes of the mosquitoes that were flying around her no longer bothered her, \u201cOld Three, what\u2019s going on; you better clarify this properly!!!\u201dHan Qingsong, \u201cMy old injuries have relapsed and as such, I am not fit to serve in the army. According to the regulations, I am to change my career.\u201d\u201cChange careers?\u201d Old Lady Han jumped up from the kang and almost fell to the ground, but Han Qingsong quickly supported her from falling.Old Lady Han grabbed his arm tightly, \u201cWhat can you do with changing careers? Have you been assigned to take on any other positions? And how much will you be getting paid in the future?\u201dA flurry of words were being spoken all at once, making the room echo with a cacophony of voices. This made the eldest brother silence himself involuntarily, wanting but unable to bring up the concerns of his third brother\u2019s previous injuries.Han Qingsong shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know yet, I have to see how the arrangement turns out.\u201dOld Lady Han opened her mouth, but she didn\u2019t know what to say or what sort of reaction she should have.This was even more frightening than Lin Lan taking away 260 Yuan.This meant that countless more \u2018260 yuan\u2019 would no longer exist in the future.No, this is absolutely unacceptable!\u201cOld Three, is the army forcing you to change your career or was it you who really wanted to change it?\u201d If the old lady didn\u2019t get the full truth out of him, she wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep peacefully for her entire life.Han Qingsong didn\u2019t want to say anything more. After all, the scenario of the ongoing internal revolution and the camp\u2019s environment were both very complicated matters. It wasn\u2019t something that he could understand nor was it something that he could control, so speaking about it wouldn\u2019t do any good either.He looked at them, \u201cFather, mother, it\u2019s getting late, let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow.\u201dShould he continue, answering a question would only lead to another question; by then, no one would be getting a wink of sleep.He spoke to his eldest brother and his second brother, asking everyone to go back to their rooms to rest and resume the talk tomorrow.When he left, second brother Han complained to the old lady.The second sister-in-law was unhappy as well, \u201cSeparating the family is fine and all, but I should have a room to myself too.

    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48It wasn\u2019t their place to live in the second room nor the master room, so they could only squeeze in the west corner and sleep on the north and south kangs.She wasn\u2019t used to it at all!If it was up to her, she felt that she should sleep in the east kang, whereas the Old Three and his family would sleep in the west corner.The old lady got angry and scolded, \u201cGet out, get out, get out! Whoever wants to live separately can get out of this house; it doesn\u2019t matter to any of you if your father and I die anyways.\u201dKnowing that she was only speaking out of anger, everyone dispersed.The old lady leaned on the kang and said, \u201cOld man, my head is bulging and pounding painfully just like the frozen winter melon, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have a stroke out of anger. Quick, give me a piece of the ointment patch to paste it on.\u201dAccording to her, the son was the Company Commander and he was part of a specific cadre!Although the Eighth Route Army and the People\u2019s Liberation Army were also stationed there during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, she had also seen many Platoon Commanders and Company Commanders, so they weren\u2019t all that special to her back then.Although many young folks enlisted in the army in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, to the point where even several Company Commanders and Battalion Commanders returned to resist the US Aggression and aid Korea, she didn\u2019t bother to see how they were faring.But now, the situation is different!At that time, because of the wars that would inevitably cause the soldiers\u2019 deaths, many people did not want to join the army and the daughters of the country were not willing to marry soldiers either.Now, it was a popular career option to be a soldier!Soldiers, like workers and government agencies, were iron rice bowls(1)!(T/N: Refers to any job being \u2018stable and secure\u2019. Usually, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about not having income by taking these careers)Little Fourth(2) also said that if he could not get a good job after graduating from high school, he would go to the army to find his third brother.(T/N: The old lady\u2019s youngest son, but that\u2019s the way parents would typically address their kids)If Old Three were to change jobs, what could he do?The old lady also knew that many soldiers in the nearby village were demobilised and they returned home. If the conscripts were to be demobilised for three years, it would be necessary and there was nothing much to say about that.After being demobilised, the army would give them some money. Then, they would have to find a job by themselves, which would be nothing more than taking care of the Brigade Commune and becoming a civilian soldier or the Chief of Security in the village.Even if it were small cadres who wanted to change their jobs, sometimes even Platoon Commanders, they could at most be Company Leaders in a company or work at the Public Security Bureau of the commune, the Ministry of National Defence, the Militia Company, etc. The old lady had inquired about them, but ultimately, they had no future.Although the local members felt that these were jobs with rather proud titles and high-paying jobs, how was the old lady going to accept those? After all, she was also the old mother of the Company Commander of the army.She only felt a burst of sudden dizziness. Originally, she wanted Han Qingsong to make things clear, but he managed to run away. As a result, she couldn\u2019t breathe and almost suffocated herself.She didn\u2019t want to succumb to suffocation due to her overwhelming anger, so she nagged at the Old Man Han.Old Man Han was so sleepy to the point where he couldn\u2019t open his eyes. He hummed at first, but then, he snored loudly in the middle of his wife\u2019s nagging.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49The second sister-in-law of the Han family took the eldest sister-in-law back to the south kang in the corner west and complained.Eldest brother Han was so sleepy that he had to go to the north kang to sleep with second brother Han.When Han Qingsong returned to the room, the lights in the room had already been turned off and the children\u2019s soft breathing could be heard from the kang.Taking advantage of the dim light outside, he looked in and saw that Lin Lan was sleeping at the head of the kang with Xiaowang in her arms, followed by Maisui and then Erwang.His bed was placed at the end of the kang.According to most people in their village, the head of the kang was the best position. Hence, it was usually the position of the male parent who occupied that space, then the women and the children.Apparently, he was rejected.He stood in front of the kang as Lin Lan was sweating with nervousness.It was really hot in summer, especially in the east wing. They had to open the doors and windows to ventilate the space as they hung tattered grass curtains, but mosquitoes would sting them from time to time.She couldn\u2019t sleep at all!In the end, Han Qingsong was still standing beside her and a wave of heat rushed to her face in bursts. She wondered why she was feeling that flushed when she was obviously not a teenager with overpoweringly strong adolescence hormones.Just when she nearly couldn\u2019t hold back and wanted to explain herself, Han Qingsong had already stepped over to the kang\u2019s end.Lin Lan breathed a sigh of relief and went to sleep at ease.The rooster crowed the next day.Lin Lan got up quickly and found that Han Qingsong was no longer on the kang, but she was not in a hurry to wake the children up either. They were all in their growth stages, so she might as well let them sleep in for a little.There were many mosquitoes in the farmhouse. On one night, she was bitten twice on her face and neck and it was very itchy. When she scratched randomly and took down the tattered grass curtains to let the light in, she found that Xiaowang was bitten the most.She had to ask around for some aloe vera, mint grass etc, before bringing it back to apply it so that it could relieve the itching from the stings.But thanks to the medicinal wine that Han Qingsong brought back, she slept soundly all night. Her arms and shoulders did not hurt that much either; otherwise, it would have been too swollen to lift today.She tested her arm and felt that there was no problem in moving it, but she really wanted to use her arm pains as an excuse and ask for a leave of absence from work.Lin Lan felt that she was really squeamish as she couldn\u2019t do physical work at all.She went to work a few days ago, and at first she went to the cotton field to pick up some worms, but she nearly died there.Those squirming bugs made her numb and she felt her body tremble.Later, she switched to hoeing the field. There, she took the big hoe to plough the ground and clear the grass, but it didn\u2019t take long for her back to hurt\u2014 the big hoe felt like it weighed a thousand pounds! In addition, after 9 o\u2019clock in the summer, the sun would be unbearably hot, so her entire being felt like it was being barbecued with every passing minute.So, either she chose to find an iron bowl job, or Han Qingsong would give her some living expenses henceforth.However, these days, the cadres in the countryside were not full-time workers, and even the old Secretary Head of the village had followed suit in working laboriously, so she would not be able to do anything in the face of absolute policies.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Then, that meant that the only route left was Han Qingsong.Or could she persuade him not to change his career?After all, according to the plot in the original book, the reason why Han Qingsong changed his career was because the original owner had done too much to make him disheartened. Then, the army environment being complicated and fiercely fighting factions weren\u2019t helping his situation either.Old Lady Han was afraid that they were not going to send wages and allowances to her home after spending money in the army. However, the original owner was afraid that he would have a good future after divorcing her, so she would rather him change his career as a soldier to get her man back.But I\u2019m different\u2014 I don\u2019t make a fuss and I support Han Qingsong\u2019s work unconditionally.I have to get a chance to talk to him.Lin Lan went to the patio and was surprised to find that Old Lady Han had yet to get up. She used to carry a stick and knocked it around to get the entire family to wake up and go down.When she came out of the toilet, she found that each of the family members sported two large dark circles under their eyes as if they were tortured by not sleeping for ten days.Tsk tsk, how pitiful.The second sister-in-law of the Han family had a small bump on her head. There would have been no problem if it had been bandaged, but she practically mummified it with a large hand towel. She was not afraid of the heat it seemed, so she hummed, \u201cOh, it hurts to death and I can\u2019t go to work.\u201d\u201cMother, why did you come out?\u201d Erwang woke up at some point, so he ran out to support Lin Lan, \u201cMother, you can\u2019t move your arms, so just take a rest and don\u2019t go to work. My father is back!\u201dErwang was very proud that his father didn\u2019t listen to his grandmother\u2019s pesters of divorcing his mother, so he took the opportunity to show off that his father was back and indeed cared about them.Those who joked that their father was going to divorce their mother and those who never wanted them\u2014 hmph, take a good look!The second sister-in-law pouted and went back to the house to lie down in anger.Eldest sister-in-law prepared to cook and called the children to mow the grass to earn some work points.Children that were as old as Erwang, Maisui, and Sanwang, all had to mow the\u00a0 grass to earn their work points.Maisui tried acting coquettish and didn\u2019t want to go. She wanted Lin Lan to speak up for her, but Lin Lan pretended not to know what she wanted.Mowing the lawn was easy work, so Maisui had to go with the other children.At this time, Han Qingsong came back with some water and saw Lin Lan sitting on a stone staring at the broken tiled basin in a daze. So, he poured the water into the water tank, came out and said to Lin Lan, \u201cThere are two empty thatched huts in the field. Go and take a look at them today, if you don\u2019t mind it\u2026\u201dLin Lan immediately said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind it!\u201dWhat a joke; no matter how crappy the houses were, it would definitely be a lot better than living here.Han Qingsong didn\u2019t expect that she agreed readily without even looking at it or criticising it. Initially, he thought that he would have to spend some funds to patch things up nicer before she would be happy.Seeing her agree to it, he nodded and handed the glasses to Lin Lan.\u201cThe frames were broken, but the lenses are intact\u2014 it\u2019s not broken.\u201dAfter he picked up the water, he went out again.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51Seeing this, the eldest sister-in-law sighed and said to Lin Lan in a subconscious tone of envy, \u201cDawang\u2019s mother, don\u2019t be so angry. Actually, you see, the third brother is still quite affectionate. After looking for the house, he asked your opinion about them and even fixed the glasses.\u201dKnowing that she was not happy with her life at home, he took the initiative to suggest living separately and even made the first move to find a place.Should it be other men, no matter what sort of decision was going to be made, it was always going to be decided by them. Women would very rarely be involved in the discussions at all.Even a large number of men don\u2019t even talk to women on nights where they were supposedly connected to each other besides mentioning a few things about work.In their opinion, not gossiping with their women made them appear masculine!Lin Lan smiled and said nothing.After washing her face, she went back to the room and woke Xiaowang up. She then put on his glasses for him.\u201cWow, my glasses!\u201d Xiaowang was very happy.Lin Lan wiped Xiaowang\u2019s face with a towel, \u201cYour father repaired it, remember to thank him.\u201dXiaowang pouted and didn\u2019t answer.Lin Lan didn\u2019t force him to do so before she whispered, \u201cYour father has found a house that we can move into; let\u2019s go and have a look.\u201dShe placed the two pieces of candy in Xiaowang\u2019s pocket and took him to see the house.Although Xiaowang didn\u2019t like Han Qingsong yet, he was very excited when he heard that they could move out.Those two houses once belonged to the Brigade Headquarters. Later, when the Brigade was expanded to a new compound, these two houses were used to store sundries.Although it was a little dilapidated, the walls and beams were still in good condition. The grass on the roof was repaved and yellow mud was put on it for sealing.The other parts were the doors and windows. They needed to replace some of them and make up for the ones that needed to be repaired. After that, they could set up the kang.Han Qingsong was busy working with a few people. Not only was Erwang helping out, but Dawang and Sanwang were also there and there were also a few boys from the family.Naturally, there were also a bunch of people watching the development as they secretly pointed.\u201cLook, Old Three separated the family as soon as he came back. Which one did they get?\u201d\u201cWas he cornered by the shrew that was constantly looking for a way to die?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys say that they were kicked out by the old lady?\u201dGenerally, when families split up their living spaces, they would basically build a house on the basis of the original homestead. If they couldn\u2019t build a house, they would build a shack or even go to the neighbour\u2019s home to stay overnight. Very few of them would actually move out to a far place.The old Secretary Head Han Yongfang heard the criticisms and said, \u201cWhat are you all mumbling about? What is it, you have a long tongue to spew nonsensical words? They have four sons in their family and there are only three main rooms along with a small east wing. The eldest and the second live in one room and their fourth son would have to marry one day; where do you all expect them to live?\u201dWhen Han Yongfang said this, he immediately shut the mouths of many of the onlookers, especially those that were caught in similar situations.However, some people were jealous of Han Qingsong\u2019s reputation; they were envious of the fact that the Secretary Head gave out the two houses for him to live in.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Several families in the village have said that they want to borrow the two houses, but the old Secretary Head mentioned that too many wanted it and he didn\u2019t know who to give it to.The end result was that no one could get it.But now, he was generous enough to let Han Qingsong live in them.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a gift of sorts.\u201d\u201cWho knows? He is an official, so naturally, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to give in.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t the Old Three supposed to divorce the marriage with the shrew? So why are they moving out now? What\u2019s going on with that family actually?\u201d\u201cHow would I know what\u2019s going on? I\u2019m not the elder of their family.\u201d\u201cHey, speaking of the old lady, where is she?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, Han Qingsong is really a good young man. Hey, if it weren\u2019t for that, Chunxiang should have married him.\u201d\u201cTo hell with you, what sort of nonsense are you speaking of?\u201d\u2026Han Qingsong moved quickly, preparing the materials for the two rooms in half a day and borrowing ready-made adobes from headquarters to set up the kang.Fortunately, there were adobes in headquarters.Out of the two huts, half of one was left as the main room and the other half would be their bedrooms. It was equipped with a long kang and a rectangular box-shaped hole was carved in the middle to store sweet potatoes. It was also capable of separating the two sides, where gender could be divided. When the children grow up in the future, it would be more convenient for them as well.Nowadays, many people do not have separate kangs for men and women. The whole family would usually sleep together on a kang and the children would crowd on it together even after they grew up.Besides, some of the children who were married would end up sleeping on the same kang with their partners as well.Therefore, Han Qingsong\u2019s design was enough to spark the envy of the others.Lin Lan watched for a while before she went back to have a few more bites of her breakfast before going to work. Because of the pain in her arm, she couldn\u2019t pick up the big hoe, so she went to the cotton field to pick up some bugs with a fork.There were still people spraying some medicine over there, so the smell of 1605 pills(3) drifted ten miles downwind. The smell made Lin Lan\u2019s heart uneasy as she disliked it. She worked so hard to push her way through the afternoon heat, so by the time she was done, she had a splitting migraine and she quickly left the field.(T/N: 1605 pills is a medical term, used to name a butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine tablet)When she came back, she went over to the huts to check things out. There, she saw that Han Qingsong was squatting on the roof and throwing on some yellow mud.He was wearing a racer vest, revealing his strong and muscular arms as his sweat glistened in the sun as if he was smeared with oil.He glanced at Lin Lan before putting his hand on the roof. Then, he slipped out and slid down, jumping nimbly.Lin Lan was so startled by him that her heart felt like it had latched in her throat. What if his old injuries relapsed by jumping down like this?Han Qingsong walked to her in three or so steps, \u201cBring some food over for lunch, I won\u2019t be going back to eat.\u201dLin Lan pondered that once she went back, the old lady would keep asking her questions, so she would rather finish her work beforehand.\u201cAlright.\u201dHan Qingsong glanced at her, \u201cIs your arm okay?\u201dLin Lan rubbed, \u201cIt still hurts.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask for a sick leave when it hurts?\u201d Han Qingsong also thought that according to her habit, she would definitely ask for leave and not work if she was injured. He truly never thought that she wouldn\u2019t take the chance to call in absent, so he inquired.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53Lin Lan, \u201cWhat am I going to eat if I don\u2019t work? I have to earn work points too.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to earn work points in the future,\u201d Han Qingsong said and went back to work.Does he care about me?Lin Lan pondered these words. Did she not have to do any physical work from now on?It seemed like Han Qingsong\u2019s nature had not changed as he appeared to be the same as he was in the book. He was a person with responsibilities and dignity. Since he decided to come back, he would take up the responsibility of being a husband and a father.It\u2019s just that he felt like he was too blind before. He wasn\u2019t at home all the time, so he wasn\u2019t aware of the conflicts that constantly broke out in the house\u2014 to the extent where his wife would fight with his sister-in-law and his mother like that.He seems to have a low EQ level.Lin Lan first looked at the children who were here to help after mowing the grass. Xiaowang followed Maisui, wearing a wicker straw hat. Holding a few willow leaves in his hand and blowing his cheeks constantly, he insisted on blowing a whistle.Maisui said to Lin Lan, \u201cMother, Xiaowang runs like Sanwang now that he has glasses. He literally disappears every once in a while.\u201d\u201cWhy did he run away by himself?\u201d\u201cWho knows? He\u2019d either just stay put or lay on the grass when he\u2019s not allowed near the water. Today, he still laid down on a slope near a rabbit\u2019s nest and wanted to dig it, insisting that there was some sort of movement inside.\u201d\u201cThen, there must be something,\u201d Lin Lan said.Maisui,\u00a0\u2026mothers are always favouring their youngest sons, alright!Lin Lan asked her and Erwang to go back and serve food for them to eat here with their father.At noon, the old lady Han hadn\u2019t gotten off the kang, but she was only sitting on the eastern kang, \u201cHe\u2019s not going to come visit me even if I die, right?\u201dShe was sure that the Old Three was filial, and as long as she laid here, he would definitely come to apologise and admit his faults, saying that he would be obedient in the future.It used to be like this!The family members, however, remained silent.Eldest sister-in-law gave Lin Lan a look and she nodded.She took a pancake, set aside a bowl of vegetables and picked up a small scoop of pickles with her chopsticks.Just as she was about to leave, the old lady Han called out from the room, \u201cThird family, third family ah\u2014\u201dLin Lan tried to run away, but she was stopped by eldest sister-in-law, \u201cMother is asking for you, hurry.\u201dLin Lan pretended to be stupid, \u201cShe wants me?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you from the third family?\u201d As she spoke, she took Lin Lan\u2019s bowl back and asked her to hurry in.Lin Lan reluctantly entered the room.Old Lady Han was lying on the head of the kang. The quilt was layered over her and she had a round, fingernail-sized ointment patch stuck to her temples.Lin Lan couldn\u2019t tell what she wanted from her, but it seemed like the old lady appeared to be a few years older already. Her eyes were sunken and weary, so she guessed that the old lady didn\u2019t manage to sleep very well last night.\u201cThird family, I know you have complaints,\u201d Old Lady Han set the tone first.Lin Lan didn\u2019t want to be labelled by her, \u201cOld lady, I never cause trouble without reason.\u201dYou all forced me to!If it weren\u2019t for her \u2018playing favourites\u2019 from the beginning as she was always treating the original owner as an outsider, this would not be the case. If the old lady was willing to give a few portions of Han Qingsong\u2019s allowance to the original owner, things would have been better.After all, this was what the original owner should have taken.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54\u201cDon\u2019t talk about useless things. Were you the one who pestered Old Three to change his career? Are you forcing him or asking his leader to complain?\u201d The old lady thought about it all night. Ultimately, she felt that it wasn\u2019t the army who forced her son to return, but it didn\u2019t appear as if he wanted to return on his own accord either.In her opinion, although Old Three was a little dense since childhood, he was very filial and would never cut off their source of cash without consulting with her.Then, this act could only be said to be the act of the other one from the third family.Lin Lan shook her head, \u201cIt\u2019s not me, but one should change careers when they get older anyways.\u201dBut she was still stunned as she thought of something.If it weren\u2019t for the old lady who reminded her about it, she wouldn\u2019t have thought about it either.Looking at Lin Lan\u2019s appearance, though it seemed like she truly appeared as if she didn\u2019t know anything about it, the old lady thought that it was too absurd for her to remain clueless.Even this shrew can fool others now.In the past, besides throwing a stupid tantrum, this shrew wasn\u2019t capable of lying and didn\u2019t know how to hide things from others either.Lin Lan hurried out when she saw that the old lady had nothing to say. It seemed that Old Lady Han was very concerned about Han Qingsong\u2019s change of career.In the afternoon, she didn\u2019t have to go to work. Hence, she went back to the huts to clean up so she could move in when the renovations were done.There was nothing much to bring over anyways\u2014 the family\u2019s tattered clothes could fit inside a small wooden box and a basket was more than sufficient to put the remaining bits of their belongings.But in the future, she would have to cook and pack some food. She might have to buy some utensils too.Many people didn\u2019t like to split up their families, but when they did, they had to have two copies of everything(1). And at this time, iron pots, noodle jars and grain jars were huge expenses.(T/N: Refers to having two of the same things because they\u2019re living in two different places. Example, they could just share the pots and pans in one house to cook, but now they had to get their own since they live separately)Some people couldn\u2019t separate their families even after saving up for a few years, so they were really helpless.This also showed that Han Qingsong\u2019s salary, and his allowance for the family, was actually a pretty large amount.Lin Lan went to the Brigade to take a look at the huts, surprised that the kang was actually set up. They would soon be able to sleep here in a few days.\u201cMother, do you like it?\u201d Xiaowang trotted over with his glasses in one hand and a wicker stick stuck on his arm.Lin Lan nodded, \u201cI like it; the golden dens and the silver dens are not as good as my own dog kennel, after all(2).\u201d(T/N: A saying that no matter which sort of luxury place you live in, as long as it\u2019s not your home, you would miss it. In short, there\u2019s no place like home)When one gets married, they should live separately from the family as there should only be one wife in a family. If there were two housewives, accidents would happen.Seeing that Dawang was there, she went over, intending to say a few words to him. Who would have thought that Dawang immediately left when he caught sight of her.Sanwang embarrassedly said, \u201cMother, eldest brother probably just has something else to do.\u201dXiaowang, \u201cIs eldest brother mad that we didn\u2019t give him candy?\u201dSanwang, \u201cHa, you guys ate candy?!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55Erwang slapped him lightly, \u201cWhat sort of things would he have to do? He\u2019s probably just eager to please grandmother.\u201dLin Lan stopped Erwang from continuing, \u201cDon\u2019t speak of nonsense; your eldest brother is not that kind of person, he just doesn\u2019t like to talk.\u201dShe took two pieces of candy from her pocket and gave them to Sanwang before she took out another piece for Erwang and Xiaowang to share.At this time, Han Qingsong came from the back. She let the children play as she went to fetch him some water before beckoning him to wash his hands.Han Qingsong took off his muddy vest, revealing his strong upper body and Lin Lan was a little overwhelmed by his wordless undressing.Her initial reaction was to look away, but she also saw that he had several scars on his body, including stab wounds and gunshot wounds, which looked very scary. There was even a dent on his back, which looked like a gunshot wound. It looked fatal, so him surviving all of that was truly nothing short of a miracle.She scooped a scoop of water and first helped Han Qingsong wash the mud and grime off.After washing his hands, Lin Lan poured water into the earthenware basin and asked him to wash up well.However, Han Qingsong bent down, motioning for her to help him pour the water over his back and wash it.Lin Lan, \u201cThis is water from the well; it\u2019s cold.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dLin Lan, \u201cOr I\u2019ll have Dawang and the others carry some water from the river.\u201dThe river water would be nice and hot.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, pour it!\u201dHis voice was low and magnetic, laced with a tinge of irresistible pressure. In a strange way, Lin Lan poured the splash of water down, and it wasn\u2019t until she finished the act did she feel like something was wrong with her.She felt like she was controlled\u2014 why the heck was she so obedient?The cool water from the well poured on his body, which immediately formed a trail of goosebumps on his back, but it was indescribably refreshing.After repeating it a few more times, Han Qingsong washed his vest again and put it on a small tree to dry as he remained shirtless.When Lin Lan was talking to him, her eyes glanced around a little, but she didn\u2019t expect him to be so fair. Even though his face and limbs were all sunburnt, the place where he was wearing the vest remained so fair.It\u2019s truly such a\u2026 bliss.She unconsciously raised the corners of her lips.Han Qingsong just happened to look over, and when he saw her drooped eyelashes that made her appear like she was secretly snickering over something, he suddenly felt puzzled.He didn\u2019t know if something was wrong with his memories or if something was wrong elsewhere, but she didn\u2019t seem to be the shrew that everyone was talking about.Could it be that she suddenly changed her ways after this lesson?During dinner, Old Lady Han finally came out of the room, but her eyes were a little scary, especially when she looked at Han Qingsong and Lin Lan.There was still the patch on her temples as she hummed, \u201cAt that time, I said that the third family has to wait for a good month for the wedding. But you all didn\u2019t listen and they just had to step over the dragon\u2019s head(3). Great, now I\u2019m the one being stepped on.

Anyway, whether she had a headache, sore feet or even constipation, she would always relate it to the fact that her third daughter-in-law didn\u2019t marry into the family on a good month.Everyone remained silent and didn\u2019t seem like they cared.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What\u2019s the matter? You won\u2019t let me talk anymore? It\u2019s been like this for many years. At that time when I served the old grandmother and grandfather, when was I not being cautious and careful? When I got married, this place was so poor\u2014 I couldn\u2019t afford to wear something that was warm, so the old grandmother(4) threw me a ragged jacket and asked me to sew it. The ragged jacket was so shattered that the fabric was practically rotten and the cotton was already in shambles. Let me ask you, can it be sewn? Can it be sewn?\u201d(T/N: Refers to the Old Man Han\u2019s mother, I assume)\u201cYou- What are you trying to prove by bringing up something so unrelated?\u201d Old Man Han didn\u2019t like the fact that he was ridiculed in front of everyone.\u201cWhy do I have to be careful when I\u2019m a daughter-in-law? Now, when I\u2019ve finally become a mother-in-law, should I allow shit from my own daughter-in-law? Is there something wrong with me? As a grandmother, can I not lay around comfortably? Or do I still have to work for you too?\u201dEveryone knew that the old lady was using the topic to rant about her frustrations on her previous hardships. These words were not heard less often when they were younger; their ears were already calloused by the amount of times she complained and demanded justice.\u201cMother, let\u2019s have dinner first. We\u2019ll have a meeting after dinner, okay?\u201d Eldest brother Han was in charge of smoothing things out.The old lady began to wipe her tears, \u201cWhy does no one bother when you guys argue and you\u2019re not worried that the kids would mess around too, but when it comes to me, you\u2019re just scared of everything I do?\u201dHan Qingsong said, \u201cMother, I didn\u2019t change careers on purpose, it\u2019s all arranged by the army. You know, people from our village are so much less fortunate. At my age, I have already taken extra money for several years.\u201dThat\u2019s not wrong. There were thousands of soldiers who had once conscripted with him, but most of them have been demobilised. Out of all the peasant men in this village, he was the most promising one.But it stopped here; and that\u2019s a reality that they had to admit.Eldest brother Han and second brother Han have both inquired about it, and they felt that the third brother was not lying.Of course, Han Qingsong didn\u2019t tell them the whole story.Old Lady Han stared at him, \u201cThe army arranged for you to change careers? You didn\u2019t do it on purpose?\u201dWasn\u2019t he threatened by her daughter-in-law or hypnotised by her?Han Qingsong said lightly, \u201cMother, what are you thinking?\u201dThe old lady Han muttered, but picked up the chopsticks and tapped them on the table. Then, she brought up the porridge bowl, \u201cEat.\u201dHaving said that, she ate with a snort, as if it wasn\u2019t her who was making a fuss before.Lin Lan thought,\u00a0this family can be considered to even win in the commune\u2019s arguments; it must add a lot of laughs to the other families here.After the meal, Old Lady Han looked at Han Qingsong to ask, \u201cIs there a job arrangement for changing careers?

    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Those who were demobilized would receive a sum of money. Although it was not much, her son was a former Company Commander, so he should have received more. She guessed that there was at least a few hundred Yuan.If he were to get a paid job, then she had to make sure that his salary would be managed by her in the future.Han Qingsong had only one sentence to offer, that is, he would listen to the organisation\u2019s arrangements. After all, he couldn\u2019t decide all of this by himself and he didn\u2019t know how to arrange it either.Old Lady Han suddenly found out that the silly boy he used to be had changed! When he was a child, he was not close with her\u2014 he didn\u2019t talk much as he only worked and what his mother said was what he would do. That\u2019s why she could bear to let him serve as a soldier in his brothers\u2019 stead although he was young.She was powerless in the face of such a son.She didn\u2019t know why, but she felt like her son seemed to be a little different. In the past, her words were absolute to him.But this time, she had a feeling that he would hide when she asked him something and opt to not tell the whole story. Even when he looked at her, she felt like she was being aimed at with a sharp knife as if he could see her heart, which made her very uncomfortable.She was confident that her third son didn\u2019t have such a heart to say that his piercing gazes were intentional, but if it wasn\u2019t intentional, why would she feel this suppressed?This felt terrible!It was just like the first time she knew she couldn\u2019t handle the old man after she married him!If the old grandmother hadn\u2019t died, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to take it anymore.The more she thought about it, the more angry she became. She threw the chopsticks again, causing everyone to ask what was wrong.She was acting as if she was going to die, \u201cOh, it\u2019s uncomfortable, my chest is tight and I can\u2019t breathe.\u201dIf it was before, Old Three would have immediately said, \u201cMother, I\u2019ll go get you a doctor\u201d, \u201cMother, do you want to eat some canned food, I\u2019ll buy it for you\u201d, \u201cMother\u2026\u201dNow, Han Qingsong was indifferent, as if he didn\u2019t hear or see her suffering.The old lady waited for Han Qingsong to get up and help her into the house. She also waited for him to say \u2018whatever you say, mother\u2019.She stared at Han Qingsong hard, but he still ate as if nothing happened.Old Lady Han was absolutely furious.Han Qingsong put down his chopsticks and talked to Lin Lan, \u201cAfter dinner, go over to clean up; the walls and the fence need a little bit of cleaning.\u201dLin Lan replied with a hum and asked the children to eat quickly, \u201cErwang, come with your eldest brother tomorrow to cut some thorns and come back. Let\u2019s tie a fake shed after that.\u201dA fake shed, clean the layer of dust, the ceiling\u2014 just those kinds of stuff. Without those, the house would appear rather incomplete.Erwang readily responded and Maisui said that she would also go. Several children in the second room also said they would come along.After eating their third uncle\u2019s candy, they naturally have to help.Dawang continued eating as if he hadn\u2019t heard her.Han Qingsong, \u201cDawang?\u201dDawang nonchalantly replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201dOld Lady Han knew that her son was blaming Dawang for not agreeing to Lin Lan\u2019s words immediately. To educate her son, she immediately caused some trouble and said, \u201cWhat are you doing? What are you doing? We don\u2019t educate children when the family\u2019s eating. Dawang has his own stuff to do, why would you need him to cut the thorns as well?\u201dDawang dropped his chopsticks and left, looking impatient.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58Han Qingsong\u2019s thick eyebrows were twitching and he was about to burst.Lin Lan hurriedly pulled him to tell him not to be angry since they could just educate him slowly afterwards. Since he\u2019s already this old, yelling at him in front of the entire family would do no good.When the old man put down his chopsticks, she immediately put hers down and got up. Then, she went back to the house to clean up and asked Maisui to put her younger brother to bed before she followed Han Qingsong to check out their new home.As soon as they left, the old lady Han was furious as she pointed with chopsticks, \u201cLook at them, look at them! How ridiculous! What is an old man and an old lady doing so close to each other? Wouldn\u2019t this become a subject of gossip?\u201dIn the village, the husbands and wives were rarely seen outside together. Usually, it would always be men hanging out with men and women gossiping around with women, let alone a pair of husband and wife walking together in the middle of the night.It wasn\u2019t the standard!It was irregularly improper!Old Lady Han\u2019s temples began to pulse again and she felt like they were about to burst.At this time, the moon has yet to show itself. Only the stars were shining brightly as there were cicadas and frogs croaking with the night wind, making the atmosphere very pleasant.If you ignored the annoying mosquitoes.Han Qingsong walked very fast as she couldn\u2019t keep up when they left the courtyard. He didn\u2019t seem to wait for her either\u2014 he strode ahead and disappeared in a brief moment!Lin Lan originally wanted to take advantage of the beautiful night to chat with him about life, but it turned out\u2026what a waste of such a good starry night.By the time they got to the hut, Lin Lan was out of breath and couldn\u2019t help complaining, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you walk slower?\u201dHan Qingsong was surprised, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that you wanted to come?\u201dLin Lan: \u2026\u201cDidn\u2019t you ask me to come with you?\u201d This man was so boring.Han Qingsong, \u201cI said that I\u2019ll clean it up; it\u2019s dirty.\u201dShe gave up reasoning with him. She felt that this man really wasn\u2019t cut out to communicate and she didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s a natural thing or was he just not that good at expressing himself.Han Qingsong lit the oil lamp and placed it in the lamphouse. He seemed to be thinking about what his plans were when it came to cleaning and rearranging the huts.Lin Lan looked around. Noticing that he wasn\u2019t really planning to speak, she just looked around here and there.Lin Lan, \u201cJust speak up,\u201d\u00a0Why was he muttering in his inner voice?Han Qingsong looked at her, \u201cDo you want to hear it?\u201d\u201cThis is a house that I want to live in; of course I want to hear it.\u201dDo the men in your family, no, the men in your entire village not have the habit of discussing issues with their wives?This is obviously a family problem, okay? Why do you just keep mumbling to yourself?This is really just a consistent style of local men, but it really isn\u2019t common to discuss things with women at all.Han Qingsong didn\u2019t expect that she wanted to hear him out, so he told her that the roof should be used as a shed. The wall surrounding the kang also has to be treated. Otherwise, the skin of the wall would fall off once it was wet.\u201cThere is a kind of grass cloth which can let air ventilate, but not allow bugs to permeate through. It can be used as a mosquito net.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59Listening to him talk about mosquitoes, Lin Lan scratched the bag on her neck subconsciously. The mosquitoes were like the old lady\u2014 both equally ruthless and annoying to no end.It would be nice if there were mosquito nets.The Han family had only two mosquito nets, both of which were given to the youngest aunt and uncle. The mosquito nets in the second room were taken from their dowry. The original owner\u2019s family was so poor that they provided no dowry at all, so naturally, there were no mosquito nets provided for her.Not only did she have no dowry, she even wore the clothes provided by the old man Han\u2019s family, which was really too shabby.This was also one of the reasons why the old lady and the second sister-in-law looked down on the original owner so much.The original owner also owned a mosquito net later on as it was Han Qingsong who discreetly gave her the one from the army.However, in order to compete with her own third sister, the original owner took it back to her parents\u2019 home to flaunt her image. In the end, she and her children never got to use it and they were bitten every year.\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Lin Lan was very happy.Han Qingsong did not speak again.The narrow room, although unfurnished, was not spacious. It was dimly lit and Lin Lan felt a little nervous to be in a room alone with him.She quickly found a topic to speak of, \u201cThat, uh, do you really want to change careers?\u201dHan Qingsong turned his head to look at her, his dark eyes resembling a bottomless pit that made others panic, \u201cWeren\u2019t you the one who insisted that I change careers?\u201dLin Lan swallowed a mouthful of spit.\u00a0Yes, it\u2019s me, it\u2019s me, it\u2019s me! I\u2019m carrying the brunt of the impact for the original owner!\u201cWell, can you not change careers? I think\u2026 it\u2019s good to stay with the army,\u201d Her voice was a little hollow. After all, the original owner did her best to persist, using death as a way to threaten him to return. With that, it would completely eliminate the possibility of Han Qingsong annulling the marriage between them.\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d Han Qingsong said.Lin Lan\u2019s heart tensed up. He wasn\u2019t trying to blame her, but listening to his monotone voice, it wasn\u2019t really intended to rant either. According to the plot, he was disheartened, so was this just a tinge of regret?\u201cWhy is it too late? Did you submit the application already? The leader asked you to think about it, you-\u201d Before she could finish speaking, Lin Lan bit her tongue. She was in a hurry and she was confused, but why the heck did she speak about the plot of the story?It\u2019s all because of his strong aura, which made her feel too oppressed.She was very stressed.Han Qingsong looked at her, eyes focused on exploring her every move.Lin Lan coughed, \u201cThat is, you didn\u2019t tell the old lady a set answer, which meant that there was room for negotiation.\u201dAccording to Han Qingsong\u2019s style, if he really changed his career, he would have spoken about it decisively and swiftly. This attitude of his clearly showed that there was still room for consideration.Han Qingsong was even more surprised. When did she learn about empathism?\u201cWill you not be afraid anymore?\u201dLin Lan, \u201cWhat is there to be afraid of?\u201d She was afraid of being at home, afraid that she couldn\u2019t help but slap the old lady to death!Han Qingsong didn\u2019t say anything, but the corners of his lips lifted, meaning that he found this rather intriguing.Lin Lan suddenly realized why the original owner was afraid that he would annul his wife and marry another.Of course she was not afraid of divorce; what was there to be afraid of? It\u2019s better to get divorced. It\u2019s best if she could get a job arranged for her then, because she could even\u2026.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60She was thinking of her fantasies when the light before her eyes dimmed as Han Qingsong stood in front of her.The distance between them was a bit close and the strong masculinity of his body caused the heat to rush towards her face with a compelling aura, which made her overwhelmed. She took a step back subconsciously, \u201cIf you have something to say, just say it; don\u2019t get agitated.\u201dHan Qingsong\u2019s voice was low, \u201cHave you ever seen me agitated?\u201dThat she didn\u2019t.Even if \u2018she\u2019 secretly carried Sanwang and ran to the army to file a complaint, made a fuss in the army compounds, suspiciously caught a mistress or two that would make the whole army refer to them as a laughingstock, he would still talk to her in a good tone. He was not agitated at all, let alone scolding her or beating her. He never actually accused her either.Speaking of which, although he looked cold and serious, he was actually rather gentle towards people, unlike some men who looked kind and ended up either lecturing or beating their wives daily.\u201cHaha,\u201d She laughed dryly.My aura is too small and I want to pull it back; I can\u2019t be suppressed by him.She cleared her throat, \u201cIt\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t do your best; if you do well and give me a sense of security, I can still\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat does it mean to be \u2018doing well and giving you a sense of security\u2019?\u201d Han Qingsong looked at her with a heavy gaze.He had thick eyebrows and deep eyes, his face stoic and unsmiling. When he looked at others, he exuded a majestic aura.Lin Lan didn\u2019t dare to look at him directly, \u201cLook, there are so many beautiful female soldiers in the art troupe in your army, as well as beautiful female nurses and doctors in the army hospital. It was said that many people are interested in you, and you can\u2019t guarantee that you will continue to live a good life with me\u2026\u201d\u201cAs I said, you are a woman who bore children for me, Han Qingsong. No matter what mistakes the woman makes, I will protect her for the rest of my life. Do you not remember that?\u201dLin Lan thought about it for a while. It seemed like she had said it before, but the original owner didn\u2019t remember it clearly. Actually, the original owner misinterpreted it as protecting her for the rest of her life because he had a guilty conscience after the divorce. Naturally, she wouldn\u2019t accept it.The original owner has a certain characteristic of hers. It was easy for her to be convinced with rumors and once she pinned it as the truth, there was no persuading her out of it. No matter what he said, she thought that he was good-looking and had a potentially successful future, so countless beautiful women would swoon over him in the army. She heard that the daughter of a cadre fell in love with Han Qingsong and might convince him to divorce her or something along those lines.Lin Lan felt that she could still struggle a bit, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand this problem clearly and I was at fault, but you don\u2019t know the situation at home, so you can\u2019t blame me entirely for having conflicts with the old lady. I have five children at home, so I would definitely want a few Yuan to buy something to coax the children occasionally.\u201d\u201cDid I blame you?\u201d Han Qingsong became more and more puzzled.Seeing how innocent he was, Lin Lan started to question herself again. He really didn\u2019t blame her at all. This time, although the old lady and the second sister-in-law complained to him all day long, he never favored blood over marriage and he didn\u2019t blame her at all.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61Even before, it seemed like the original owner had never been accused.But didn\u2019t he come back once every two or three years since their marriage? At most, he would stay for five days and at least, he would stay for one. Regardless, how many oddities would he have noticed in that short time span?Lin Lan was also surprised that with such a limited number of contacts, they actually had five children without even doing so five times.She was unwilling to fail. If she loses in the first round, she must not be held down by him in the future.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s not right for you to give them all the allowances. Why don\u2019t my children and I have a single cent for ourselves? Do the children don\u2019t have to go to school? Do they not have to save money to marry in the future?\u201dDidn\u2019t I add your name after you wanted to get the money that time? One person gets half each?\u201dOnce, he went to the Sino-Indian border to perform a mission and was seriously injured in order to save his team. He returned to the Provincial Military Region Hospital to recover from his injuries and received a call from Lu Jinxiu. He said that his family sent several telegrams and his wife made a fuss at home to ask for money. Otherwise, she would jump into the river to commit suicide. So he asked Lu Jinxiu to tell the logistics to send over two copies, but later the logistics claimed that it was too much of a hassle, so he sent a remittance slip issued with two names. Doing so, one person would get half each.\u201cYou said it before, yes, but the old lady wouldn\u2019t give it to me.\u201dWhen the remittance slip came, the old lady was the one who went to pick it up. And although the original owner wanted to withdraw the money, she didn\u2019t dare to confront the old lady, so she wanted to make a fuss and make the old lady take the initiative to give her the money. Yet, it was impossible for Old Lady Han to be that kind when she was a sucker for money.Han Qingsong looked at her. Although she didn\u2019t speak, Lin Lan automatically interpreted his thoughts: How did you get it this time?Damn, she said before that Han Qingsong had a low EQ and was rather dense. Why was he here waiting for her step-by-step explanation?In the past, the original owner was unreasonable. She didn\u2019t know if her words suddenly making sense now would change anything\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of you bullying me?\u201d Lin Lan decided to shift the blame, \u201cIt\u2019s because you were wrong. My name was already added anyways, so why not just send two copies over to make sure that we claim our share each? Is there a reason for a pair of husband and wife trying to reason with one another? I don\u2019t see you basking in glory even though you won this argument.\u201dIn order to maintain her reputation, she snorted before she turned around and left, not wanting to reason with him any more.Han Qingsong, \u201c\u2026\u201dLin Lan went out and met the children who came out to catch cicadas.Sanwang ran around with Dawang as Lin Lan couldn\u2019t even get them to stop despite shouting.\u201cMother, my eldest brother and I are going to Zhuzi\u2019s house to sleep, so you don\u2019t have to think about us.\u201dI don\u2019t think I;m going to miss you arrogant children!Lin Lan went home angrily and Xiao Wang had already slept with a tattered towel in his arms.Maisui looked aggrieved, \u201cMother, who made Maomao this way? He just cried so sadly, asking who killed his Maomao. He wouldn\u2019t sleep until he managed to find it.\u201dLin Lan,\u00a0you guys can\u2019t give me a break, huh?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Maomao was a ripped towel, so torn that no color patterns could be seen. Instead, it had one hole after another all over it.That was Xiaowang\u2019s Maomo. If his mother was not there to coax him to sleep at noon or at night, he must have Maomao.The typical fetish of a child.Lin Lan didn\u2019t interfere much; it would be fine once he was older anyway.But who would have thought that Han Qingsong didn\u2019t know about it. Tonight, when he was washing his hands before dinner, he went back to the house and saw Maomaot. Thinking that it was merely a rag, he washed it and hung it on the windowsill outside.Originally, he should be considered rather diligent, but Lin Lan was almost pissed at him. Although he had five children, he didn\u2019t understand the temperament of any of them!Intellectually speaking, he had been in the army for so many years and had been in the presence of gracing death many times, so she could understand him when she thought about it. With the rationality of a citizen in a formerly modern society, she still had great respect for soldiers.But there really should have been a bit more of an emotional intelligence whipped into him as only he knows his pains and sorrows.When Han Qingsong came back, he went to the main room and talked to the old lady. The old lady was upset upon seeing his determination to change careers, but he refused to coax her. With that, she was so angry that she had a headache and went to bed early.When Han Qingsong returned to the house, he found that the children were sleeping. The head and tail of the kang were empty as he hesitated for a moment.Did this mean that she wanted him to sleep at the head of the kang?Just as he was about to get on the kang, Lin Lan sat up suddenly, hugging Xiaowang and placing him beside her.Lin Lan snorted as she ignored him and laid down.Han Qingsong, \u201c\u2026\u201dThree days later, the new house was completely repaired. With that, the family packed up and moved in.As there were no iron pots and other household items in their new place, they still had to return back to the family house to eat.When they came back for lunch at noon, the second sister-in-law\u2019s family had already moved into the east wing happily, \u201cOh, finally! We finally no longer need to crowd uncomfortably in one room.\u201dWhen the second sister-in-law was younger and still a newlywed, she was never as direct as she was now.Later on in her marriage, however, she gave up being polite.\u00a0What\u2019s the use of tip-toeing around them, anyway?\u00a0Instead of feeling awkward by her curtness, she decided to let the other party feel the tension. And true enough, once she started to do so, the eldest brother and his wife constantly stayed out of her way to avoid any unwanted spurs of negative emotions.When the second sister-in-law found out that the eldest couple had not been living together as husband-and-wife for a while, she was proudly ecstatic. She even deliberately tried to push the eldest sister-in-law\u2019s buttons in order to find some sense of superiority over her.While the women were setting the table, Han Qingsong went to talk to the old lady, \u201cMother, we have a shortage of iron pans, so I was thinking if we should go and get one.\u201dThe old lady Han looked half-dead as she replied, \u201cMm, go buy it then.\u201dHan Qingsong wanted the Old Lady Han to provide him with 20 dollars in order to be able to buy the pots.\u201cWhat?\u201d The old lady immediately stared at her son with eyes peered open wider than a bull. \u201cOld Three, do you have a conscience?

    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Seeing that she was about to start bringing up her rough times again, starting from getting married to the tales of serving her mother\u2013in-law,\u00a0 the eldest sister-in-law of the Han family hurriedly said, \u201cMother, they can\u2019t cook without a pot after moving.\u201d\u201cThen just come back to eat; what are you planning to cook? Asking me for money? Well, where is the money? You don\u2019t know because you\u2019re not at home, but your younger brothers and sisters are still in their school years. Besides, there are ten children at home who eat and freeloads off of the family. Thus, we have to spend money everywhere. Our family is going to be incapacitated and you still want to ask me for money?! Didn\u2019t that woman take all the money? Have her take the remaining out to furnish your home. \u201cShe snorted and slammed the door before going into the house.The eldest sister-in-law smiled at Han Qingsong, \u201cMother-in-law is just being angry. Here, I have two dollars here with me; you guys should take it first.\u201dHan Qingsong shook his head, \u201cEldest sister-in-law took a long time to save up the sum, I\u2019ll find another way.\u201dEldest sister-in-law, \u201cOld Three, did Dawang\u2019s mother truly spent the money entirely?\u201dNo matter how many times they recounted the amount, it was just impossible for one to spend it in one go. However, Lin Lan was going to keep it with her no matter what.According to the eldest sister-in-law\u2019s understanding of the original owner and her desire for money, she understood that once Old Three\u2019s wife obtained any form of fundings, she was never going to hand it over.The biggest possibility was for the money to end up in Lin Lan\u2019s maternal family, but she hadn\u2019t gone back at all these days, so the money must certainly be in her hands.At this time, when she saw Lin Lan approaching them from afar, the eldest sister-in-law smiled before remaining silent henceforth.Lin Lan knew that she had to buy some equipment and other daily items for the new house. However, she knew that she mustn\u2019t take out the money because it would practically be a public declaration to say that she still had the funds in her hands.She was the one who said that she had spent it all after all, but she hadn\u2019t used any of the remaining yet.At any rate, it was a good thing to return to this house for meals. There was no need to make a fire everyday during the summer, so she would rather wait till winter before doing much about it.Who would have thought that Han Qingsong went to the Secretary Head and the Captain to request for the item. Sure enough, after a while, a pot was sent to their place. Although it was evident that the pot went through some patch-ups, nowadays, no one had a really good pot either back at home. Most were used for many years because when it broke, it would be preferable to fix it and repair it than getting a new one.In addition to the iron pot, a few other people gathered tableware and other household items for them.Han Qingsong thanked them all.Lin Lan sighed, appalled by this display of status.If things depended on me, no one would bring anything.When the old lady Han heard that they were provided with a pot, she immediately asked the eldest sister-in-law to swap it with the one they had at home. The one that the Han family was using was way too old, so compared to the \u2018new\u2019 one, it was in a much worse state.Erwang and Maisui pouted unhappily and muttered, \u201cWhy is grandmother so biased? She practically takes all the good things in our house.\u201dHan Qingsong heard the comment and glanced at the pot, but he didn\u2019t say anything as he continued to keep himself busy.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Erwang and Mai Sui went over to Lin Lan to complain, \u201cMother, look at grandmother\u2014 she\u2019s so biased; will father be too? Will there even be some good things leftover for mother in the future?\u201d The children started to protest and whine.Lin Lan was practically applauding the children\u2019s words in her heart and she almost nodded fervently in agreement as well. Fortunately, she was able to stop herself.She felt that she had to work hard to distinguish her thoughts so as to not be led into the ditch by Erwang. After all, the views of children were influenced by adults. She couldn\u2019t deny that the environment he grew up in was toxic\u2014 Erwang grew into a boy with a slick tongue for words, became very calculative and found it easy to manipulate others for a reason.She was in total agreement in her heart. However, on the surface, she spoke, \u201cErwang, although your grandmother has her faults as well, your father is her son. Do you think that he could afford being unfilial to his mother just for an iron pot?\u201d\u201cWell then, from now on, she will come and ask for something good as long as we have it,\u201d Erwang was indignant, \u201cAnd after she takes it, she\u2019s going to give it to the youngest aunt and uncle.\u201dLin Lan thought so too. She truly wanted to teach the old lady a good lesson, but it\u2019s not something she could say out loud to her kids.After all, she was also a mother and was bound to become a grandmother at some point. There were just some things that she could say to her daughter but not to her son\u2014 this was the difference in treatments.Who wouldn\u2019t be selfish?Old Lady Han was thinking selfishly for her own sake, so she chose to carry out her actions for her own sake as well. After all, she wasn\u2019t being two-faced.She couldn\u2019t face this matter with her children\u2019s angry approach since the adults in their lives would eventually become role models that they would imitate. If she were to say that Han Qingsong being obedient to his mother was wrong, or say that being filial to the old lady was wrong, wouldn\u2019t her children think that they didn\u2019t have to treat their mother with respect?Lin Lan didn\u2019t want things to turn out that way!However, being blindly filial was wrong and she had to let her children know.She smiled and said, \u201cOf course not! For children to be filial to their elders, the elders must be kind and loving. If the elders do not have compassion, then the younger generations have no obligation to be filial. We respect the old and love the young. If the elders are behaving too much like a jerk, then we don\u2019t have to be polite either! Don\u2019t worry, mother has a way to deal with her.\u201dShe had to support her children with everything she got!The two children looked at her unpredictable and sophisticated demeanor and felt like she was actually a person of high status, immediately admiring her very much.Lin Lan fooled the children but she had to think about this issue with all her heart.

    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65The two children smiled and said, \u201cMother, what kind of wicked things are you talking about? We don\u2019t do such things.\u201dPerhaps not now, but in the future, I think there will be a lot.\u201cAnyway, now that the family is living separately, mother can call the shots. Hence, the two of you will go to school.\u201dIn times like these, children attended school in their later years. Children who lived in rural areas would go to school at the age of nine or ten. They couldn\u2019t handle chores that require a lot of physical labour anyways and they could mow the lawn before and after school. Children younger than eight years old had to be watched over as they tend to be unable to sit still when they attend school. Hence, they would usually stay home.Erwang immediately said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to school; even my eldest brother didn\u2019t go.\u201dMaisui also said, \u201cMother, didn\u2019t you say that we wouldn\u2019t have to go to school and those that attended classes are mentally ill? So why are you asking us to go to school now? I\u2019m not going.\u201dBoth the youngest aunt and uncle went to school, but the original owner scolded them for attending classes, claiming that they were insane. Her children didn\u2019t want to be labelled as crazy, so they didn\u2019t want to go.As long as they would have the money for new clothes and leather shoes, they could just find a job in the city. There was no need for any schooling and they weren\u2019t exactly envious of those who had the opportunity either.Lin Lan,\u00a0I guess it\u2019s still necessary to slowly brainwash the children to reverse the previous misunderstandings.When going to bed at night, the allocation of their sleeping positions diverged again.According to the rules, parents should take the youngest child to sleep on one side whereas the older children would sleep on the other side.But Maisui was nine years old, so Lin Lan felt that she should sleep on the kang separately, not always lumped together with her brothers.However, having her sleep here with Han Qingsong was a \u2018no\u2019 for her too.What\u2019s more was that she herself was facing a big mental obstacle to suddenly let her sleep with a man.Although he was handsome and had a good figure, coincidentally being the type that she admires, she still could not accept him without any sort of emotional foundation.Therefore, she decisively let Han Qingsong sleep over.She took Maisui and Xiaowang to sleep on her side of the kang and let the other males sleep on the other side.Anyway, since it was pretty big there, she could hang a curtain in the future to separate it.Han Qingsong, \u201c\u2026\u201dWas this truly the wife who used to want to tie him to the belt of her pants?This woman must have been replaced!He stood in front of the kang and looked at it before she brought a bowl of water for him to drink, \u201cHang a curtain over the kang to let the girls and boys sleep separately.\u201dLin Lan spoke, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you have to sleep with the boys. I made them wash their feet, so don\u2019t worry, it doesn\u2019t stink.\u201dEspecially Sanwang, who soaked his feet in the water all day to the point where it was practically borderline swollen\u2014 it definitely wouldn\u2019t stench.On the contrary, Dawang, that little brat, was not home as he was well-acquainted with Zhuzi.And since Zhuzi became his younger brother by bond, he simply obeyed Dawang like a good puppy.Han Qingsong looked at Lin Lan\u2019s whole-hearted look and he didn\u2019t think that she was faking it. Quite obviously, he could tell that she didn\u2019t want to sleep with him.This\u2026 hurt his self-esteem a bit. After all, a certain someone couldn\u2019t help but lay her eyes all over him in the past.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66If the news of the father sleeping with his sons and not his woman was spread out, the entire village would probably silently snicker and joke about his loss.Other men would never agree to it, anyway.Lin Lan was also afraid that Han Qingsong would be stubborn or even rough and she couldn\u2019t help but get nervous. She wasn\u2019t afraid of what he could possibly do; in front of the children, he couldn\u2019t do much either.But\u2026 she couldn\u2019t relax when she thought that sometimes, for the sake of their self-esteem, there were things that a man could resort to regardless of having an audience with them.After all, he had been abstinent for too long, so would there be a relatively strong demand? Not being home for such a long time, would he feel like his power was suppressed and resort to using force against her?Just when she was starting to feel the unease taking over, Han Qingsong walked to the other side and went to sleep on the kang silently.Lin Lan let out a sigh of relief.Fortunately, Han Qingsong didn\u2019t snore while he was sleeping, so Lin Lan slept more soundly, unlike the times when she was in Old Man Han\u2019s house. The snoring in the east and west rooms was so loud that she didn\u2019t get to fall asleep on the first day till dawn almost broke out. In fact, it took her several days to get accustomed to it.On the first night of their separation with the main family, Lin Lan had a good night\u2019s sleep.For several days, Han Qingsong went for a run early in the morning. Then, he cleaned up the house, built thatched huts, chicken coops and the walls of the courtyard before turning to the front and back yards of the house to grow some vegetables and trees.After cleaning up, Lin Lan told Old Lady Han that they would raise two chickens from home.At this time, the rules of the village was that two people could raise one chicken. As the numbers in the Han family was high, they could rear a lot of them.According to the population, Lin Lan\u2019s family could also raise three and a half. With Han Qingsong\u2019s special status, it was no problem for them to raise four.Generally, there was not enough food in the family. At most, two or three animals would be raised. The eggs would be sold in exchange for money to buy oil and salt or improve their lifestyle, but they would not raise many.Lin Lan felt that it would be fine to keep two for the time being because the old lady wouldn\u2019t want to provide them with more either.Who would have thought that the old lady wasn\u2019t agreeing on giving her any.The old lady Han was bothered when speaking to her now. Last time, the original owner would always lash out in frustration while the old lady felt satisfied to behave like a true mother-in-law. However, with Lin Lan\u2019s calm appearance this time, the old lady wasn\u2019t happy with the change.\u201cI\u2019ll say, third family, I never thought that you were this kind of person. Are you trying to trick me to play your games? The salt I ate is more than the noodles you had(2).\u201d(T/N: A saying that the older generation has been through more/have more experience in dealing with life\u2019s hurdles than the younger generation. Though it\u2019s true, it doesn\u2019t automatically mean that every elder you come across is always right, especially when they use this against the younger ones to earn some sort of validation like this woman)Lin Lan smiled, \u201cOld lady, you really aren\u2019t afraid of nature\u2019s play, I see. Be careful of your high blood pressure.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have the money? Did you give it all to your family?\u201d Even though she didn\u2019t see her return to her maternal family at all, the old lady was adamant on getting answers.Lin Lan smiled without saying a word.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Old Lady Han,\u00a0fine, you don\u2019t have to hand it out; I\u2019ll catch you later. At any rate, we don\u2019t have much food for now and I can\u2019t afford to unconditionally feed everyone. We still have winter to get through, after all.But the next day, Han Qingsong came back with two little ducklings that he brought back from someone else\u2019s place. They were a creamy shade of butter-yellow and were especially adorable.Xiaowang and the other children liked them very much.\u201cMother, the little ducklings are good. When they grow up, they can go to the river to find fish and shrimp to eat on their own and they eat less food than chickens.\u201d\u201cYes, ducks are easy to rear and not easy to die.\u201dIt was normal for five chickens to die out of ten.Lin Lan smiled and said, \u201cRemember to dig out young and leafy vegetables for them to eat.\u201dXiaowang raised his hand, \u201cI\u2019ll have the ducklings eat grass and insects in order to lay eggs for mother to eat.\u201dSanwang smiled and said, \u201cSomeone has to watch over them when they\u2019re out or they will run away with other big ducks. We\u2019ll have to be careful when they lay their eggs.\u201dHe had seen a lot of such occurrences. There would be one or two little ducklings reared at home, but when the ducklings ventured out the house, they would trail behind other adult ducks from other homes\u2014 it was so stupid.As soon as Xiaowang heard that they were going to face a big enemy, he immediately chased the two little ducklings to educate them about love, \u201cBig duck and little duck, I will sing while you lay eggs,\u201d Then, he began to sing, \u201cUnder the bridge in front of the gate, a group of ducks are swimming\u2026\u201dErwang asked, \u201cMother, where did he learn this song?\u201dLin Lan refused to admit it, \u201cHow would I know? I don\u2019t know where he heard it.\u201dOn another side, Maisui was calculating the price of a few cents for a duck egg. She was trying to count how many they needed to sell for a pair of leather shoes.Lin Lan couldn\u2019t help sighing when she saw her longing look, but then, she turned her head to meet Han Qingsong\u2019s gaze.He was using branches to make a duck pen. That way, the ducklings would have space to roam around but still be restricted within their compounds.When he looked at her, his eyes were filled with a complicated hint of emotions and slight doubt, but Lin Lan couldn\u2019t identify the actual emotion itself.Thinking that she was having a cold war with him, she turned her head sideways coldly.Han Qingsong, \u201c\u2026\u201dReturning from work in the evening, Lin Lan went back to the new house to clean up as usual. She checked on the ducklings and helped Han Qingsong grow vegetables that could still be nurtured this season.\u201cAsk the old lady if I can make a small bowl of noodles for Xiaowang? He has a weak stomach and he just had diarrhea, so coarse grains won\u2019t be easy for him to digest,\u201d Though he practically emptied his stomach\u2019s contents, Xiaowang didn\u2019t have an appetite to eat.Lin Lan felt sorry for him and wanted to get some finer grains to eat, but the old lady stored all the food at home.Han Qingsong was also very concerned about Xiaowang, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to my mother.\u201dAlthough he didn\u2019t say anything, he saw Lin Lan dressed in tattered clothes. She was so thin that there was practically no excess flesh on her body and her waist was so thin that it looked like he could snap it off with one hand. One by one, he looked at the yellowing faces and thin skin of every single child of his. Dawang disappeared all the time like a wild child and although Erwang and Maisui were a little cleaner than most, their clothes were unsightly. Not to mention Sanwang, who soaked himself in the river all day, was now only left with a pair of torn trousers on his body. Xiaowang\u2019s eyes were not good but his body was in even worse conditions\u2014 he was so thin and petite that it made others feel pity for him.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68He sent Erwang to talk to his mother, asking if they could make some noodles for Xiaowang. If he didn\u2019t like noodles, gnocchi(1) would be fine as well.(T/N: The more accurate translation would be something like a lump-shaped pasta that\u2019s slightly chewier. Added in soup dishes, it can substitute noodles. For easier identification, I will use gnocchi as the term as they are similar in size and feel)When it was time for dinner, Lin Lan found that not only Xiaowang\u2019s supposed noodles or gnocchi was nowhere in sight, the cornmeal cakes that they once had as a staple were now replaced with charred and rough bits of cornbread(2).(T/N: Denser texture than dumplings, usually made from flour. To depict an image, this was made out of coarse stems and bears a similar texture as eating dried clay)She tried tasting one of the cornbread.\u00a0This was clearly something that wasn\u2019t meant for humans; it may even be flour mixed with sweet potato leaves and coarse stems that are fed to the pigs? This was like eating the bran of the grains!It\u2019s only been two days since the family was separated and the food had already plummeted to such dire states. Perhaps they didn\u2019t want them to come home to eat or something?And this meal had no technical culinary elements in the slightest. For breakfast, they would have some cornmeal cakes, proper cornbread and even some boiled sweet potatoes. If there was only congee for lunch, the cornmeal cakes would at least be added for dinner along with some other simple vegetables. At the very least, there would also be some porridge made.Even if Lin Lan didn\u2019t like to cook in her previous life, she knew that these meals had no culinary input at all.But, why was the eldest sister-in-law\u2019s dishes so difficult to eat?It wasn\u2019t just unpalatable\u2014 these days, ever since the family split up, she found that the food at home was really getting worse and worse. She could now relate to the things that Sanwang said a while ago, something like, \u201cNo sweet potato rice or sweet potato soup; three meals a day was never a loop.\u201d(3)(T/N: Tried my best to translate it whilst rhyming, but basically it means that they never had anything to fill up their bellies. Three meals a day was also a pipe dream and never a routine.)This tough cornbread could practically kill a dog if you threw it at one!This kind of solid was probably mixed with sweet potato leaves and sweet potato stems, only eaten in desperation during the three-year period of famine by using \u2018starch\u2019 as a meal replacement. However, those who ate it would be met with constipation problems and in worse cases, the body would swell to the point where the stomach would be bulged to no end.The Han family were practically going back to the state of the night before their country\u2019s liberation!Lin Lan was angry\u2014 even adults wouldn\u2019t be able to eat this, let alone a child with such a weak stomach. Xiaowang was also sick and wasn\u2019t in his best condition!She glanced at the old lady, saying that she didn\u2019t have much of an appetite.The men, however, didn\u2019t say anything. The Han family\u2019s eldest sister\u2013in-law also ate silently, but the second sister-in-law merely drank a few sips of the sticky porridge and left her cornbread untouchedAs for the children, most of them drank the sticky porridge; only Dawang was nibbling on the cornbread that was difficult to eat. This child was stubborn and did not like to talk. He was very sombre, but he never complained and was never a picky eater. Thinking about her past life, he later mingled with bad influences and was shot dead\u2026 Lin Lan\u2019s heart skipped a beat at the thought.Erwang and Maisui took two bites of the cornbread and forced them down their throats. In the end, the remaining lumps were left uneaten as they were undesired.As soon as Maisui placed the cornbread down, Old Lady Han looked at it and immediately scolded, \u201cWhy are you wasting the food; you think it\u2019s not good, don\u2019t you? I\u2019m not starving you guys, am I? When I think about those three years where we were in absolutely dire times, we always ate such things. There are so many out there who have to starve themselves or eat things that were less than this, yet, here you are being ungrateful for the food that is given and also silently complaining that it\u2019s not good enough?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Sanwang pouted, \u201cGrandmother, this- this is simply inedible. Even the poorest and laziest people of the village didn\u2019t have to eat this.\u201dThese were basically food for the pigs, weren\u2019t they?He ate two mouthfuls of the cornbread in his hand before proceeding to stuff it into his pocket, intending to bring it back to feed the ducklings.Old Lady Han said angrily, \u201cYou guys don\u2019t live here, but do you know that firewood, rice, oil, and salt are expensive? What else do you know besides eating? The family is about to live in shambles\u2014 are you aware of that?\u201dAfter such a scolding, no one spoke.When Lin Lan heard Han Qingsong\u2019s footsteps entering the yard, she asked the old lady, \u201cMother, Xiaowang had diarrhea for the past two days; can I make some soup noodles for him?\u201dOld Lady Han slapped her chopsticks on the table harshly, \u201cWhy are there so many problems? Why can\u2019t you just live according to the standards that you are? We\u2019re all poor and lowly peasants, so why are you trying to eat like the wealthy rich landlords?\u201dLin Lan pretended to be aggrieved and said, \u201cI\u2019m not asking for it daily; I just want him to eat it when he\u2019s sick. He can\u2019t digest the cornbread properly with a weak stomach.\u201dHan Qingsong walked in, washed his hands and came to eat; he knew what was going on as soon as he heard it.He asked Erwang, \u201cDid you tell your grandmother about it?\u201dErwang pouted and said aggrievedly, \u201cOf course I did, father, I said it several times even.\u201dOld Lady Han spoke angrily, \u201cAnd do you think that the world will bend to your will once you say it many times? We don\u2019t have fine noodles here, so even the Gods can\u2019t help you. If you want to eat that, we\u2019ll talk about it later..\u201dWheat was only distributed in summer, hence, it was impossible to say that there was no fine flour.Han Qingsong, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any noodles, you can make eggs. Never mind, I\u2019ll make them.\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying to do?!\u201d Old Lady Han became angry, \u201cThere are only a few chickens in total and more than half of them still don\u2019t lay eggs. You\u2019re not earning any money now and we don\u2019t have any cash at home, so other than those chicken\u2019s eggs, how else do you expect us to earn a living? If you eat them now, what do I exchange for kerosene and salt?\u201dErwang pouted and whispered, \u201cJust keep it for the youngest aunt and uncle to eat.\u201dHan Qingsong glanced at the dining table. Xiaowang was languishing as the little girl Maisui was nibbling on the black and hard cornbread discontentedly. Lin Lan was wearing a dress that was obviously patched over and repaired numerous times, which was many times more shabby than the dress of the second sister-in-law who sat across from her.He had an indescribable feeling in his heart\u2014 it was sour and a little tingling, but his chest was suffocating.\u201cAn egg is three or four cents,\u201d Han Qingsong insisted.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, you want to settle accounts with your mother? When you were making money, you were away from home all day long. Now that you\u2019re home, not treating your parents with filial piety and you\u2019re unemployed, I haven\u2019t even gotten some financial subsidy from you while you were living under my roof! You haven\u2019t gotten a cent of your money back this quarter and you want to eat the eggs? Where else would I find such ungrateful-\u201c\u201cAlright already, it\u2019s just an egg!\u201d Old Man Han didn\u2019t say a word all along, but he couldn\u2019t take it anymore, \u201cMake one for the child; he\u2019s already so sick.

    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70Han Qingsong went into the house and Lin Lan quickly chased after him. The eldest sister-in-law hurriedly went after them, insisting, \u201cLet me, let me!\u201dHan Qingsong was not at home, so he didn\u2019t know what went on all along.But Lin Lan knew.She moved quickly and found the small urn where the eggs were usually placed. It was almost full of eggs and there were also another two jars of noodles.The old lady made pancakes every once in a while and took them to the county town for her youngest son and daughter. The whole family ate whole grains just to save the fine grains for the two of her precious children.The eldest sister-in-law was still one step too late. She could only smile awkwardly as she grabbed an egg.Lin Lan took advantage of the situation and took another one. She was going to make one anyways, so why not make sure that he would be full?Han Qingsong said, \u201cEldest sister-in-law, you can go back to eat; I\u2019ll do things here.\u201dIt took no time at all to make the eggs. He boiled a bowl of water at the bottom of the pot and cracked the eggs into it. Boiling them for a few minutes, they were both cooked. He even scooped out the soup and pinched a few grains of salt into it.In order not to provoke their anger, Lin Lan did not go out. Instead, she called Xiaowang into the house to eat.Xiaowang was very sensible and whispered, \u201cMother, you can eat one and I will eat one.\u201dLin Lan took a sip of soup symbolically just to show that she was eating, but gave the rest to Xiaowang.The old lady outside was sour with envy, \u201cHe knows how to get his mother to eat, but he doesn\u2019t care about his grandmother.\u201dAfter feeding Xiaowang, Lin Lan came back to eat.She immersed the cornbread in the sticky porridge. Seeing that Erwang and Maisui couldn\u2019t swallow their share, but forced by the old lady\u2019s arrogance, she winked at them and motioned for them to give it to their father to eat.Her playful look fell into Han Qingsong\u2019s eyes and he looked at it for a moment. Erwang then proceeded to take Maisui\u2019s share as well before quietly stuffing them into Han Qingsong\u2019s hands.Han Qingsong glanced at Lin Lan again, but he silently took and ate them.After dinner, the men were to go out and work whereas the women would take care of their children and do the housework at home. Lin Lan took the children home. On the way, she clarified a few things to Erwang and Maisui, asking them to find an opportunity to see how their eldest aunt makes the food.Erwang suddenly understood her intentions, \u201cMother, do you think the eldest aunt is deliberately cooking bad food for us to eat?\u201dLin Lan motioned to him in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s not your aunt; it must be your grandma. I guess she\u2019s angry that we managed to live separately so she doesn\u2019t want to provide our share of food any longer.\u201d\u201cReally? Why is she so bad!\u201d Sanwang squeezed himself into the conversation from one side, \u201cI\u2019ll go take a look.\u201dHe turned his head and ran back, only to be pulled back by Dawang, \u201cThe doors are already closed, what are you trying to do?\u201dWhen they came out, the children\u2019s second aunt had already closed the door.Dawang then proceeded to slip away with Sanwang.When they got home, Lin Lan sent the children to wash their faces and feet. Then, she took the mosquito-repelling mugwort plant and placed it by the door.She ushered the children back into the house and found a chance to talk to Han Qingsong alone.\u201cHave you seen the food these two days?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Han Qingsong washed his feet with water, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201d \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but ever since we came back and split up from the main family, the food had also gotten worse day by day. Even the substitutes for the usual dishes have been brought out today.\u201dHan Qingsong thought for a while, \u201cThe cornbread was a little rough.\u201d\u201cJust a little rough?\u201d Lin Lan looked at him and gave him a breakdown of things, \u201cEven in those years, the old lady and the others have never eaten this kind of cornbread!\u201dHearing her tone of voice that was full of complaint, Han Qingsong understood what she meant, \u201cDo you think mother is deliberately cooking this kind of meal?\u201dLin Lan sneered, \u201cWhy, you never would have seen that coming, would you?\u201dHan Qingsong frowned, feeling that the old lady\u2019s behaviour was somewhat unacceptable. But he also felt that the old lady, who had suffered through three years of famine, would typically behave as such and would scrounge and save every penny.After all, Xiaowang also managed to eat some eggs that night.\u201cTsk!\u201d Lin Lan rolled her eyes. Besides this stupidly filial son that never questions his parents, anyone could tell that Old Lady Han was purposely doing so.\u201cYou weren\u2019t home all year round, so I won\u2019t blame you for not knowing the situation. I won\u2019t say much either, just go see it for yourself,\u201d Being away from home all day, she was appalled that he thought of his mother as \u2018behaving reasonably\u2019. Did he not see through her persona this time around?The old lady didn\u2019t say a word about Han Qingsong unless she wanted money. And when she knew he wanted to change jobs, she immediately agreed to split up the family.The family didn\u2019t give them anything once they separated houses, but whenever Han Qingsong got anything, she would be the first to snatch it away.In the eyes of any discerning person, one could see that the old lady was doing it on purpose.In the past, the original owner was weak and incapable of thinking, so by playing the understanding mother-in-law at times, the old lady was able to bend her to her will.She didn\u2019t want to instigate the relationship between Han Qingsong and the old lady. After all, they were mother and child. She just wanted Han Qingsong to see the clear display of injustice she and her children received in this family.Also, she wanted him to see that the old lady wasn\u2019t as nice to them as he thought.Anyway, she planned to give Han Qingsong a little wake-up call first before he thought that she was the one being unreasonable.The next day, Lin Lan, Erwang, Maisui and Xiaowang whispered quietly, asking them to find a way to watch the aunt cook.They didn\u2019t let Sanwang know about this as he was a person who was incapable of hiding things. Moreover, he listened to Dawang all the time. The oldest child had a big prejudice against Lin Lan, so he could not know about this either.As a result, Erwang and Maisui went there several times and did not see their eldest aunt cooking a different kind of meal. They used the cornbread to replace their usual dishes. They even asked the other children , but they didn\u2019t discover anything. And anytime that wasn\u2019t mealtimes, the old lady would yell at them and instruct them to mow the grass to earn work points.The children all thought that Lin Lan might be overthinking things; after all, everyone was eating the same thing.Lin Lan didn\u2019t think so. According to her understanding of the old lady\u2019s attitude, there must be something up her sleeve.The two large jars in the east room were filled with grains and there was half a small room with grains in it.

    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72The eldest sister-in-law could absolutely take advantage of when the Third family wasn\u2019t home to cook other foods besides the cornbread and the cornmeal cakes; as for the children, with the threats of the old lady, who would dare to say otherwise?Lin Lan guessed that they were instructed to say that they ate the same things if they were ever questioned, so she thought for a while and came up with an idea.She wanted to catch onto their current scheme and see what they had to say for themselves.The next day, she got up early before dawn and crept on the kang before going over to the Han family\u2019s place.The gates were closed.She first sneaked to the back of the house, and sure enough, she heard the sound of the eldest sister-in-law making a fire as well as some occasional muttering.Then, she heard the sister-in-law shouting, \u201cGaoliang, Xiaofu, hurry up and get off the kang! Eat your pancakes! When your third aunt and their family comes, you will only be able to eat the cornbread.\u201dSure enough, they were playing tricks behind their backs!Lin Lan thought for a while before she hurriedly went back and asked Erwang and Maisui to go to the house together.Han Qingsong was up as he got some water to plant the vegetables. When he saw them scampering, he asked, \u201cWhat are you doing? Why are you all in such a hurry?\u201dLin Lan raised her eyebrows, \u201cI\u2019m getting the evidence for you!\u201d To show them that she was worthy of being feared, she wanted to catch them while they were in the act!When they got to the Han family\u2019s house, they didn\u2019t knock on the door. Lin Lan went directly over the low courtyard wall in the south. When she was climbing on the top of the wall, she happened to see the second sister-in-law leading a few children to grab the pancakes and said, \u201cSomeone go and watch the gates. When you see them, just give us a good shout. Hurry up and eat!\u201dLin Lan shouted unceremoniously, \u201cYou\u2019re all feasting!\u201dShe shouted out in a cold voice, frightening the women and children in the yard who were guilty of secretly eating as Xiaofu even dropped his pancake on the ground.The second sister-in-law almost threw the basket of rice away out of shock. She turned her head to look at Lin Lan and met her gaze. She was terrified as if she had seen a ghost because for a long while, she couldn\u2019t believe that Lin Lan was there.Lin Lan found out that in this family, instead of being rude, one had to be cold and intimidating. Then, when it was time to take action, she should do it without hesitation!She jumped down, ran forward and snatched the rice basket from the second sister-in-law\u2019s hands, \u201cI\u2019ll say, you guys are impressive.\u201dErwang and Maisui had also climbed in by now, \u201cHmph, how shameless!\u201dThe Han family\u2019s second sister-in-law\u2019s first reaction was to snatch the rice basket back because she hadn\u2019t eaten yet. But because of that reflexive reaction, she was so embarrassed that her face flushed red. She didn\u2019t know what to say for a while as her lips twitched, \u201cThird family, come, come\u2026 Today I am improving the food; I even told the kids to call you guys.\u201dThis sort of shameful situation could only be carried out by Old Lady Han. If it were to reach Han Qingsong\u2019s ears, what a dire situation that would be!The key point was that the food they served for the Third family wasn\u2019t completely made out of fresh sweet potato leaves. Many of the cornbread were made last year and they didn\u2019t want to know how it tasted. In fact, even in those three years of famine, the old lady didn\u2019t want to eat them.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73As a result, the old lady ruthlessly said that if anyone dared to tell the truth to the Third family, she wouldn\u2019t let anyone eat anything\u2014 not even the children.So, the second sister-in-law could only remain silent as well.However, they didn\u2019t expect that the Third family would see through their plans in just two days.How shameful.Old Lady Han shouted as she was seated on the kang, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Do you think I spent all the allowances? Weren\u2019t the money used to subsidise the family to buy food and rations? This time I didn\u2019t receive money, so of course I don\u2019t have food!\u201dIn the Han family, the old lady always liked to mention that everyone should carry their own weight. But she shouldn\u2019t forget that there was a certain young aunt and uncle outside the house that neither worked nor contributed to the financial aspect of things. Yet, their meals were paid for by the labour and the hard work of the others.However, Old Lady Han seemed to love bringing up the fact that she raised 11 children.Lin Lan didn\u2019t quarrel with them either, \u201cThen, let\u2019s divide our rations and we\u2019ll cook our own food in the future.\u201dThere was no need to mention the possibility of dividing the rations because the old lady would never agree to that. However, although this incident was indeed her fault, she didn\u2019t want to give the Third family a choice either, \u201cIf you want to divide the food, we will talk about it when the autumn rations are given out. Now, we\u2019re already hanging on by a thread, so there\u2019s no need to talk about distributions, yeesh!\u201dThe Han family\u2019s eldest sister-in-law silently brought out the pancakes for everyone to eat together. She lowered her head and was embarrassed to look at Lin Lan, for fear that she would go crazy and seek death once again. If Han Qingsong were to see this, he would definitely think that his wife was suicidal because of the treatment towards her from his own family members.At this time, Old Man Han and the other men also got up. They were embarrassed one by one as they stood awkwardly, but they pretended not to know.Old Man Han spoke, \u201cGo and plough the private space,\u201d He indicated that to the equipment that was placed aside and didn\u2019t even bother to eat the rice that was made.Eldest brother Han followed his father closely behind as he couldn\u2019t afford to lose his own reputation.Lin Lan looked outside and Erwang gestured to her. With that, she knew that Han Qingsong had led Xiaowang over as well.She took the rice basket and gave Erwang and Maisui the pancakes. Then, she said loudly, \u201cI\u2019ll say what I have to then\u2014 distribute the rations for us to make them ourselves; if it\u2019s not enough, I can\u2019t blame you either. But if you don\u2019t and I catch you purposely going behind our backs to give us, the Third family, pig food\u2026\u201dShe paused and glanced at both her sister-in-laws. After hearing Han Qingsong\u2019s footsteps reaching the gates of the courtyard, she said loudly, \u201cI\u2019ll smash the pot and destroy the table\u2014 no one will be allowed to eat!\u201dBoth the sister-in-laws were terrified as their children looked at the third aunt in horror.The shrew was still the same shrew\u2014 in fact, she was even more fierce!Her intimidating look appeared to be more powerful than a tigress!After saying this, Han Qingsong came over.Erwang immediately shouted, \u201cFather, look! They made pancakes to eat secretly! But when we come over, they make us eat cornbread!\u201dHan Qingsong paused before he glanced coldly at the yard full of women and children. Finally, his gaze stopped on the eldest sister-in-law.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74Eldest sister-in-law Han was so embarrassed that she wanted nothing more than to find a hole to crawl in. She smiled awkwardly, \u201cOld Three, n-no, it\u2019s nothing. Mother said that we\u2019re raising the quality of our lunch today; we were just worried that it would take up time so we just started earlier. The children were a little greedy so they just ate first without waiting. You see, even father hasn\u2019t eaten yet.\u201dHan Qingsong\u2019s emotions threaded as deep as the ocean, but he didn\u2019t say anything. His deep eyes were cold and his lips were pulled in a straight line.Xiaowang hurried over to grab his mother\u2019s hand as Lin Lan stuffed a piece of pancake at him. She also distributed the pancakes in the basket to the children, letting them eat the food one after another.At this time, Sanwang ran over from outside and wondered, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you guys get me when you all left? Has my eldest brother come home? Aiya, you\u2019re all eating now? There\u2019s even pancakes!\u201dLin Lan immediately gave him two pancakes, which this kid scarfed down happily.Sanwang smiled and showed his little canine tooth, \u201cMother, how is grandmother so generous today. Didn\u2019t she usually provide our family\u2019s meals reluctantly?\u201dListening to Sanwang\u2019s words that were full of innocent curiosity, Han Qingsong felt like a needle had made its way through his heart and it was not a sensation that he enjoyed.Although he knew that his mother and his wife were constantly at odds with each other and often quarreled about money, he never thought that she would give his children and his wife the worst servings of food.Lin Lan\u2019s words about pig food, especially, hurt his heart immensely.In the past, she only argued and insisted for him to come home; otherwise, she would demand him to give her a share of his earnings\u2014 never was there any mention of anything like this horrible treatment, however. Even when he did return home, he was always flocked by distant relatives and nosy neighbors that didn\u2019t know how to mind their own business. Because of his pliant nature, he would attend to them a lot, thus making the already low number of times they meet even less frequent. These days, he finally garnered the chance to speak to her at night, but if she wasn\u2019t resenting him, then she would be avoiding him.He didn\u2019t know what else to do.He suddenly felt a deep sense of guilt; perhaps it was right for him to change his career. He served the country gallantly, yet, he neglected his own family. Back then, he didn\u2019t think much of it as he was still carrying out his duties as a soldier of the army. But now that he had returned home, seeing his wife and children being so wronged, he felt that he could be the man of the family as long as he let go of his responsibilities as a soldier.He wanted to protect them and give them a better life.He walked to the main room and faced the door of the east room and asked, \u201cMother, what do you mean by this?\u201dOld Lady Han felt a little guilty at first, but she muttered, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to her nonsense; when have we let you suffer alone? Ask your sister-in-law, does she not eat the hideous steamed cornbread? And which child refused to eat it? You shouldn\u2019t pay much attention to that shrew\u2019s words because all she knows is how to spew nonsense all day long.\u201dWhen she said that, she became emboldened and scolded, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem now? You actually dare to start suspecting and interrogating your own mother? What do you take me as\u2014 another mission that you have to tackle?

    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75Being so unreasonably disturbed by her, Han Qingsong\u2019s eyes became slightly colder.Because of his status as a son(1), he really couldn\u2019t do anything to the old lady directly. Lin Lan saw his helplessness and coughed out in disgust, but started to commence her act of grievance by wiping away her tears that she made sure flowed uncontrollably.(T/N: Not sure if this works globally, but in Asian culture, age is a big hierarchy sort of thing. Being older would come with expectations that the younger generation would have to respect you. So to stand against your parents is a really big deal, especially in the older times like this novel is being carried out in)Maisui suddenly burst into tears, \u201cWhy do you keep scolding my mother like that all day long? This shrew this, that shrew that; which part of what my mother said was a lie? The fact that you don\u2019t give us food is nothing but the truth. All the good things we have are sent to the county town for my youngest aunt and uncle. They eat white noodles there every day, my uncle rides a bicycle over to a restaurant and my aunt wears that damn watch to show off all the time. She would even make me wash her clothes and not only hers, I would have to wash her classmates\u2019 clothes as well just to please her friend who was the principal\u2019s daughter! But why am I the one washing their clothes?!\u201dShe was so aggrieved as Erwang also began to complain.\u201cSanwang is right\u2014 grandmother is reluctant to give us food. During the New Year, when our aunt and uncle couldn\u2019t finish the dumplings, they could still heat it up for breakfast the next day; yet, our family can only eat four or five dumplings per person? We have our fair share of food as well, but why are we not allowed to have it?\u201d\u201cMy mother said she wanted to take Xiaowang to see a doctor but you haven\u2019t given her any money. Did you not basically force my mother to pull the trick of taking the money before it ever reached your hands? Last winter, Xiaowang had a fever and she just wanted one dollar for the injection. But you said to her that she had so many kids so what was there to lose, even asking her if she thought that Xiaowang was her only precious son? You gave my mother two cents! On one hand, you told us that you didn\u2019t have the money, on the other hand you bought a new pair of leather shoes worth 10 dollars for my aunt and a 5 dollar work permit for my uncle!\u201dErwang had a delicate mind and was good at observation.Xiaowang looked at this and with that statement coming from his brother, his mouth deflated as he began to cry.Sanwang was stunned as he nibbled on the pancake. Scratching his head, he asked in doubt, \u201cSuch a fragrant two-layered pancake- eh, why are you crying? And Xiaowang was sick? When did that happen?\u201dLin Lan,\u00a0besides playing in the water, this stupid boy doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on around him, huh?Maisui directed her frustration at him, \u201cYou know nothing but eating and playing with water, can you care about something else?\u201dAs Sanwang was scolded, he didn\u2019t know what he did wrong all of a sudden. However, he felt a compelling urge to cry along with his sister.So he let go of his hesitation and cried aloud.As someone always full of playfulness and laughter, with his voice no longer infused with happiness but wails, it kind of shocked the others in the room. As soon as he cried, his sadness that was too strong and infectious could be heard throughout, the two little ones in the main and second room both started to cry along with their cousin as well.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76Xiaofu, who was currently in the second room, could relate his feelings as the good and delicious foods were always left for his aunt and uncle under the insistence of his grandmother.The little girl in the big room, Gumi, also once served as a maid for her aunt before. When her aunt was at home, she was the one who served the water to wash her feet. As she now had to earn her share of the work points, it was only recently that her grandmother assigned that task to Maisui.It was as obvious as day to all of them that the old lady favored the youngest uncle and aunt. Every time they had pork to enjoy, the old lady would always make a delicious pork belly stew for her two favorites. Instead, the rest of the family would have to merely sip on some pork oil soup.Even that, apparently, was not considered \u2018favoritism\u2019 as she once defended. She argued that the youngest aunt and uncle were tired and worn out from going to school and she had to make up for it, even going to the extent of asking their nieces and nephews to love the two even more.What nonsense!Old Lady Han, upon hearing the commotion, decided that something was wrong\u2014 why was the entire yard focusing their anger on her?She jumped off the kang in anger and scolded, \u201cYou white-eyed wolves, did I raise you in vain for you all to condemn your mother or grandmother? Are there any children as insolent as all of you?\u201dShe started crying as soon as she sat down on the bench in the main room.Eldest sister-in-law quickly helped her up, \u201cMother, what are you thinking? No one is putting the blame on you.\u201dThe old lady looked at Han Qingsong and said, \u201cOld Three, what do you mean by this? Are you finding faults with your mother now? My son, you didn\u2019t stay home to serve your parents and went out to serve the military\u2014 perhaps was this act of defiance taught by the military? Did they teach you to not be filial?\u201dHan Qingsong, \u201cI couldn\u2019t serve you two at home because I simply had no choice since it meant that I needed to serve in the military. My allowances and wages\u2014 I kept not a cent of those and sent them back here. Half were meant for my parents and half were for my wife and kids.\u201dEldest sister-in-law Han quickly settled down the situation, \u201cMother, it\u2019s not easy for the Old Three as well. He had to stay away from his wife and children to the point where they\u2019re not even close with him anymore. If you keep saying stuff like that, you\u2019re going to really hurt him.\u201dThe second sister-in-law, however, was irritated, \u201cI\u2019ll say, Old Three, are you perhaps resenting your mother for making you enlist in the military? Father and mother are both old now, and it was true that you never remained home to fulfill your duties, so there is no need to bring up anything unrelated.\u201dLin Lan looked at them and said, \u201cThe old lady sent him to be a soldier and he has mailed his wages back to raise this entire family on his own without leaving a single penny for himself. Though, it appears that even though he contributed to our entire survival, you guys are trying to be calculative? If you\u2019re going to bring up everything, then you shouldn\u2019t have had him become a soldier in the first place. Well this is nice, isn\u2019t it\u2014 he\u2019s changed his career now, so your filial expectations can be carried out now, can\u2019t it?\u201dAren\u2019t you all used to your bad habits?

    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77\u201cBy the way, I forgot to tell you, but this pot is mine!\u201d Lin Lan snorted coldly and placed the basket in Sanwang\u2019s hands. She ran to the main room to get a rag and picked up the iron pot.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d The old lady was startled and immediately went to stop her.\u201cThird Family, leave it alone!\u201d The Han family\u2019s second sister-in-law was also anxious.This pot was only patched up twice so it was in very good condition. The previous pots were fixed five or six times before and would leak if there was too much water, so Lin Lan must take this one away.Lin Lan said angrily, \u201cMy man used his money to support your family. Over the New Year\u2019s, you give out fives and tens for the others, but it\u2019s always lackluster when it comes to my family. My kids never had their bellies full with dumplings before, you took my daughter to become a maid, you hadn\u2019t offered a single penny when my son was sick and needed treatment, so explain to me\u2014 why the heck should I care what becomes of you?\u201dWhen Old Lady Han asked for the pot before, Lin Lan, who was accustomed to the modern-day settings of luxury, even despised her behavior.\u00a0To ask for such a broken pot, what a trample of your ego.But later, she found out that the iron pot was very important to the family!Some people don\u2019t even own a broken pot as they even use clay pots and clay cans to cook!Why did she give them the advantage, indeed; she was going to take it back.Old Lady Han wanted to pull her, but she was blocked by Han Qingsong\u2019s tall figure.\u201cFirst Family, Second Family, stop her for me!\u201d The old lady was held back by Han Qingsong and she couldn\u2019t move at all.The eldest sister-in-law was embarrassed. The second sister-in-law went up to try and grab it, but she was pinched and twisted in the waist by Lin Lan. She rolled to the ground and cried out in pain. Her daughter and sons were coming over to help, so Sanwang and his siblings rushed over as well.Seeing that they were about to cause a larger mess, Han Qingsong shouted, \u201cStop!\u201dHis voice was strong and magnetic, so for it to be yelled out with such anger and demand, it carried a sense of order and threat.The children were too scared to move forward.Lin Lan was already holding back her strength, so with that, she pulled the pot out at once!When the eldest sister-in-law had steamed the pancakes before, she scooped out the water and put it in the soup pot and saved it to drink later on. She was about to add some water in to make it when Lin Lan jumped over the wall and came in.The pot was almost cold by now. Lin Lan put a torn rag on it and pulled it out effortlessly.A pot like that weighed over twenty pounds!Lin Lan was very proud.\u201cBastard! Put it down!\u201d The old lady howled as if her heart was gouged out as if she was already beginning to die.Erwang and the others have already run over to help their mother lift the pot.At this time, Dawang ran in from outside. He was stunned for a moment and shouted, \u201cWhat are you all doing?\u201dHe originally thought that his mother was looking for a way to die while shaming the family in the process once again, but when he came in, he saw that it was not his mother but his grandmother that was the cause of the drama. This time, it was his mother who was proud if he were to notice anything from her victorious appearance.He was stunned that she really learned the word \u2018patience\u2019.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She looked like an old hen who was protecting a bunch of chicks. The face that he used to think of as ugly and despicable, somehow\u2026 looked okay today.\u201cYou guys are going too far!\u201d Dawang snorted and stepped forward to grab the pot.Although he was young, his strength had far surpassed that of his peers as he carried the cast iron pot effortlessly.\u201cHey, that\u2019s our family\u2019s pot!\u201d Lin Lan thought he was helping the old lady and was so angry that she wanted to kick her useless brat.Everyone thought that he was going to put the pot back, so who would have thought that Dawang placed the pot on his head and said to the old lady, \u201cGrandmother, I\u2019ll bring the pot back later!\u201dSaying that, he ran away with the dark iron pot.Leaving the crowd speechless in shock.(T/N: I think that he tricked the family into thinking that he would bring the pot to his grandmother since they knew he was a suck-up to her, but maybe he changed his mind at the last second after looking at his parents. Either way, it confused me for a bit, but feel free to interpret it however you want as the author made it rather vague)\u201cMy pot-\u201d Old Lady Han made a heart-wrenching sound of agony.Lin Lan hurriedly advised, \u201cOld lady, you have to be more generous and open-minded\u2014 what\u2019s yours is yours, so you can\u2019t forcefully take what\u2019s not yours too. Isn\u2019t this the advice that you once gave me?\u201dWhen the original owner wanted some money from her, the old lady responded as such. At that time, she probably even felt like she was at the top of the world.\u201cY-you\u2026\u201dThe eldest sister-in-law hurriedly advised, \u201cGuys, just stop talking.\u201dThe Han family\u2019s second sister-in-law also cried and made a mess again.Whilst they were arguing, the Han family\u2019s eldest brother and second brother came back.At this time, Dawang carried another pot and was running back and the two of them looked at him from a distance. It was as if the pot was buckled upside down with two legs springing from its base; it ran pretty fast too.The second brother wondered, \u201cEldest brother, look at that pot. Pretty interesting to see legs underneath it, no?\u201dThe eldest brother asked, \u201cWhich kid is this?\u201dAs he said that, Dawang, who was already running over with the pot above his head, saw the two of them approaching. He let out a cry of exclamation and sped forward towards the house. He wasn\u2019t able to pay attention to the doorsill and tripped over it, nearly dropping the pot in the process.The eldest brother Han yelled out, \u201cBe careful of the doorsill!\u201dDawang then stabilised himself, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t break the pot.\u201dHe ran back to the main room without anyone else\u2019s help. Then, he used his arms to put the pot back at once, almost plunging his entire body weight along as well. Thankfully, he was truly a lot stronger than his peers\u2014 otherwise, he would have truly become overwhelmed.After finishing the job, he clapped his hands. With specks of ashes on his face, he said to the crying old lady, \u201cGrandmother, I have placed the pot back on the stove so don\u2019t cry. Didn\u2019t you once say that those who are useless and don\u2019t amount to anything worthwhile in their lives are the idiots who cry all day?\u201dNeedless to say, Lin Lan knew who the said idiot was.Lin Lan,\u00a0be careful boy, I\u2019m someone who holds grudges!The two Han brothers returned and were shocked to see the commotion, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in here?\u201dSecond sister-in-law rushed over to complain as she even added fuel into the fire(1). She talked about how the Third sister-in-law took the iron pot home and the fact that they lamented about the decision to send Han Qingsong to the military in their steads.(T/N: Worsening or exaggerating a situation.

That way, he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with this empty hatred.\u201dLooking at things this way, it seemed like everyone had an issue with Han Qingsong working in the army.\u00a0 They were all berating him for not needing to stay at home to work, bearing no responsibility to take care and serve the elderly\u2014 and most importantly, not needing to hear the profanities and complaints spewed out of the old lady\u2019s mouth.But why wasn\u2019t anyone mentioning the fact that he had to serve in the army as a substitute for his brothers?Why didn\u2019t they mention that he wasn\u2019t here because he had to earn the wages to keep this family alive?Eldest brother Han had been trying to cut into the conversation but he somehow couldn\u2019t find the right timing, so when Lin Lan paused, he hurriedly spoke, \u201cWhat are we talking about? We\u2019re a family of brothers; why are we all saying such hurtful words?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d The voice of the Secretary Head, Han Yongfang, echoed from outside. He came in with a bag of grain, \u201cQingsong told me a while ago that his family was short of grain and needed to borrow a bag of it for his family to last till the autumn so I quickly brought it over.\u201dHan Qingsong nodded to Han Yongfang, \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d He took the bag of cornmeal. He didn\u2019t look at the others and said to Lin Lan, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go back and cook.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing, what are you doing! You\u2019re acting against us, right?\u201d Old Lady Han shouted fiercely.Eldest brother Han and the second brother were also stunned.The second brother of the Han family stopped Han Qingsong, \u201cOld Three, what are you talking about? Didn\u2019t mother say that we would divide the rations after the autumn harvest? Why are you dividing it now? Are you not piercing our mother\u2019s heart this way? As a son, how could you?\u201dAlthough it was imperative to separate the family, they were also willing to do so. However, it had to be because the old lady wanted to separate the shrew from her family, and not be separated due to Old Three\u2019s resentment and anger towards his own family.(T/N: In case it wasn\u2019t clear, it meant that they should be separated because the old lady wanted it to happen. But, the families separated not because of her will, it\u2019s because Han Qingsong was fed up with her\u2014 the reasoning is important)These two reasons were starkly different. If rumours were to spread, the importance of the phrasing was very crucial as well!Who didn\u2019t want their reputation to be upheld?

    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80The eldest brother Han spoke as well, \u201cOld Three, don\u2019t be like this, it\u2019s unsightly. Other people might make fun of us; even the Secretary Head is still here.\u201dHan Yongfang said, \u201cI still have things to do, so I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201dHe came surprisingly and left just as quickly. Besides coming over to pass over a bag of cornmeal, it almost seemed like he never visited the Han house at all.Han Qingsong said, \u201cYou have to cook now that we have a pot over there.\u201dLin Lan took the cornmeal from him. This was something that he borrowed, so she couldn\u2019t let everyone take advantage and scarf it up while leaving the debts to be paid by him.Before she knew it, Dawang grabbed the bag of cornmeal from her. She couldn\u2019t even say anything as he ran back home, Erwang and Maisui trailing behind him quickly.Lin Lan, \u201c\u2026\u201dSanwang didn\u2019t cry anymore. He wiped a tear on his sleeve before he quickly packed the two-layered pancakes from the basket. Placing the delicacies in the folds of his shirt, he ran out after his eldest brother.Lin Lan led Xiaowang out and met Old Man Han at the door.In fact, the old man had been back for a while, but as he felt ashamed, he stood outside and didn\u2019t show up while they were trying to reason things out. Besides, precisely because he was standing outside, the nosy neighbours didn\u2019t have the galls to go over and check out the commotion.Now that he saw Lin Lan carrying the food out, he had to show his face. He looked pretty angry, appearing as if he was going to hit someone.Han Qingsong walked over in two or three steps.The old man didn\u2019t hit anyone, but he held the pipe of the cigarette bag and said angrily, \u201cThat\u2019s enough, let\u2019s not make our family a laughingstock; we\u2019re a family so what\u2019s all these? Let\u2019s have the Third family cook with us in the future.\u201dThe suggestion of cooking together was an apology in disguise. In the future, everyone would eat the same meal and there would be no second type of meals. No matter what, even if parents were in the wrong, they would never stoop to the point of apologising and admitting their mistakes to their children.Lin Lan looked at the old man\u2019s gully old face, which was full of traces of time\u2019s passing. She had no objection to the old man at all. He was a qualified farmer\u2019s head who didn\u2019t talk much, he was diligent and capable. Also, he was a kind person. The only point that he didn\u2019t do that well was being unable to keep the old lady in check\u2014 of course, it could be said inversely that he loved his wife a lot.She was about to give him some leeway, but the old lady in the room had already run out of the house as if she was greatly wronged, \u201cWhen I was a wife who had to serve my in-laws, I too, had to suffer everyday. Then? Did I complain and say anything about it? My goodness\u2026\u201dWith that, Lin Lan decided that she wasn\u2019t going to cut corners at all as she lightly said, \u201cFather, you\u2019re back! I\u2019m going to make food for my kids now\u2014 I still need to work later, after all.\u201dAfter she finished speaking, she led Xiaowang and left.Seeing that they were gone, Han Qingsong also greeted his father and was about to go home.The eldest brother of the Han family saw his father\u2019s less-than-pleasant face, so he wanted to persuade his little brother to take care of the family\u2019s reputation. After all, if they were to walk out like this, it would be very embarrassing for the family.Han Qingsong glanced at the resolute backs of his wife and children before he said decisively, \u201cEldest brother, I too, will be going home to cook,\u201d He then chased the silhouettes of Lin Lan and the children.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Not expecting Old Three to not care about his parent\u2019s reputations after\u00a0 marrying a wife, the old lady slapped her legs and scolded, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of raising a son? They all say raising a child can give you a companion; well, I think it\u2019s going to give me a quick death! A white-eyed wolf(3) who has a wife just forgets his mother; he couldn\u2019t even spare me the pot\u2026\u201d(T/N: Mentioned this before, but this refers to someone who doesn\u2019t remember favours and is ungrateful)\u201cAlright already! Are you done?!\u201d Old Man Han drooped his face and said in a loud voice, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want your daughter-in-law to be talking shit like this about you in front of your grandchildren all the damn time, then I suggest you stop!\u201d After he said that, he went to the main room angrily to smoke.Since Old Man Han\u2019s mother died, he hadn\u2019t said anything serious to her and she had the final say in everything that occurred at home. Now that the old man suddenly became stubborn, the old woman shrank back and flinched, but she in turn, felt like she was wronged.Eldest sister-in-law was very embarrassed as she was busy trying to persuade her parents not to be angry.Second brother Han and his wife scolded Lin Lan, \u201cThere is never a peaceful moment with this woman from the Third family. She so desperately wanted Old Three to return and now that he\u2019s back, she annoys him to the point where our family is split. If this goes on, there\u2019s going to be a riot occurring here.\u201d\u201cI know right? Look at her\u2014 she even snatched back the pot from our house. It seems like she resents mother for changing our pots, then.\u201d\u201cAnd that Dawang, the little white-eyed wolf, mother treated him well for nothing!\u201dThe eldest brother Han said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dIt was too much for them to make two completely different meals, after all.He knew that his father liked to maintain a good image, so he said, \u201cAfter we finish eating, I\u2019ll go over to Old Three\u2019s place and ask them not to misunderstand. Parents treat their children all the same and we are all a family, so why would we make two meals?\u201dThe second sister-in-law hummed, \u201cEldest brother, you\u2019re going to be the good guy while we be the bad guys? She was the one in the wrong\u2014 she practically asked for trouble herself.\u201dThe old man raised his voice from the room, \u201cWho came up with such an idiotic idea for the whole family to cook two kinds of meals, huh? Who was the one who wanted to bite off more than they could chew?\u201dBoth sister-in-laws remained silent. Obviously, this was ordered by Old Lady Han.The old lady also realised that the old man was blaming her, so she slapped her thighs in dissatisfaction, \u201cSecond family, this is all your fault! If you hadn\u2019t come up with this cowardly idea\u2026\u201d\u201cMother-\u201d The second sister-in-law of the Han family was extremely aggrieved; how could she put the blame on her? Wasn\u2019t it because Old Lady Han wasn\u2019t happy seeing the Third family enjoying a good life and grumbled? She simply supported the old lady and made a similar comment.So why did she blame her?\u201cIt\u2019s you, alright! I\u2019m a mother and a grandmother; how could I possibly treat my children harshly? It was you, the second aunt, who suggested such a stupid idea! Forget it, stop fussing. There\u2019s still some steamed cornbread at home; let\u2019s have the Second family finish those.\u201dThe second sister-in-law snorted towards the heavens and rushed back to the east wing to cry.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Lin Lan led Xiaowang home quickly. Though she was a little worn out with how fast they were going, she was happy once they got home.\u201cMother, let\u2019s cook by ourselves!\u201d The children cheered happily.\u201cWhere\u2019s your eldest brother?\u201d Lin Lan looked around but she didn\u2019t see Dawang.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82This child surprised her today. She originally thought he would help Old Lady Han in criticising his mother, but unexpectedly, he turned against her.Sanwang placed the few pancakes that he clutched onto the stove, \u201cEldest brother put down the grain before he took a pancake and went to cut the grass. Mother, look, I took the rest of them back, hehe.\u201dLin Lan,\u00a0this kid can be a handful at times, but he still has good sense. But is Dawang just embarrassed to meet me or has he yet to reconcile properly?She said, \u201cLet\u2019s make some vegetable soup to go with pancakes. In the evening, I\u2019ll make you some flatbread.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d The children were very happy.Maisui took the initiative to get some grass to help the fire burn, Erwang helped to wash the pot and Xiaowang also helped to scoop the water with the ladle to aid his mother in making the noodles.At this time, Han Qingsong entered the courtyard holding a handful of beans, two cucumbers, an eggplant and two tomatoes in his hand.She didn\u2019t expect him to come back.Lin Lan felt a little more comfortable with that thought in mind though. She originally thought that he would stay to comfort the old lady, but she greeted him with a gourd and said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t the old lady scold you for picking so many things?\u201dHan Qingsong looked at her, \u201cSecond aunt and another aunt gave it to me.\u201dOuch. See? This is the power of popularity. Being handsome has its perks.She happily took them and Han Qingsong hesitated.Lin Lan knew that he was probably embarrassed.She mentioned that the old lady was being biassed towards the Third family but he didn\u2019t believe her words. Nevertheless, he now found out that his trust was misplaced and his mother was the one in the wrong, which was why he felt ashamed because he was being put on the spot.Due to the fact that men\u2019s self-esteem were generally quite high, only a selected handful of them would be willing to admit their mistakes.Her original intention was not to embarrass him as she just wanted to let him know of the truth. Naturally, she did not plan to be unreasonable as she did not want to intensify the conflict between them as husband and wife.Besides, she never thought that Han Qingsong would go against the old lady like that. He was not such a person by nature and the customs of this era didn\u2019t tolerate behaviour like that, which was why it surprised her.Under normal circumstances, any child that treated their mother like this could practically be told off by the Secretary Head in front of the public.\u201cWash your hands and come eat the pancakes.\u201dHan Qingsong, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, let me.\u201dHe took the water ladle over to wash the vegetables and when he was ready to give it to Lin Lan, he softly said, \u201cThis was my fault.\u201dLin Lan lowered her head and chopped the vegetables, \u201cWe\u2019re all just a family who\u2019s trying to live as best as we can, so let\u2019s not ponder about whose fault it was. I\u2019m not going to say who was right and who was wrong either, as long as you can think of the children and take care of them properly in the future.\u201dBefore this, she was still thinking of ways to bring the pot home. She thought that he was going to protest and be angry with her, so who would have thought that he would be mad at his own mother?As such, the situation was not entirely hopeless.Han Qingsong nodded, \u201cI understand.\u201dNow that he was back, he thought that he should protect his wife and children. He should make sure that his family would live a good life.Maisui boiled the water and opened the cover, \u201cMother, it\u2019s done.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Lin Lan hurriedly threw the tomatoes in to make a hefty pot of tomato soup. Unfortunately, there were no eggs and oil at home.Even so, the kids were happy because it was the first meal of their own.The pot of tomato soup had golden red tomato oil floating on its surface from the extracts of the tomatoes. There were also some red, white and green shallots accenting around the soup. Even without eggs, it was very beautiful and seemed very appetising.\u201cDelicious! Mother\u2019s cooking is delicious!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s much better than our eldest aunt\u2019s cooking!\u201dLin Lan smiled that resembled a mother\u2019s kindness, \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense, your aunt\u2019s cooking is actually really delicious.\u201dShe just never showed her true skills.After eating, they hurried to work. The children went to mow the grass and there were ducklings that they were rearing at home, so she had to get some tender wild vegetables for them to eat.When she was about to finish work in the afternoon, the eldest sister-in-law came over and looked for Lin Lan, \u201cBrother and sister, come and cook with me at home. Father ordered it.\u201dLin Lan didn\u2019t plainly go with her wishes, \u201cEldest sister-in-law, how can I cook? I made a pasty tomato soup for the children in the morning; it was absolutely unsalvageable.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s still better than what I make, and don\u2019t worry, I know my level. So, let\u2019s go and make a quick meal.\u201dAs the eldest sister-in-law, she was responsible for maintaining the family\u2019s harmony and adjustment of conflicts. She could only try to brave her way through the tasks that were entrusted to her by Old Lady Han.Lin Lan still pulled away and said with a smile, \u201cEldest sister-in-law, don\u2019t worry about it. I still have some cornmeal that I prepped in the morning. If I don\u2019t make something out of them now, they might spoil, so I should probably heat them up just in case.The eldest sister-in-law of the Han family grabbed her as she pleaded with a request, \u201cSister-in-law, please, I\u2019m begging you to not get angry with our mother\u2014 how can the younger generation get angry with their parents? The family shouldn\u2019t speak in two languages(4) and yes, our mother is not the fairest or the most authentic person in the world, but no matter what, she\u2019s still older than us and we shouldn\u2019t be mad at her. If she were to make a fuss because of this, the three brothers\u2019 reputations wouldn\u2019t turn out great either. \u201c(T/N: Means that a family should stay united. Two languages in a family means there will bound to be secrets one knows of the other, and cause the division between members of the same blood)The way she spoke was meant to change the narration of things.Lin Lan said, \u201cSister-in-law, I\u2019m really angry about some things. I\u2019m already a shrew with a bad reputation anyways, so I won\u2019t please those who made me suffer just to improve my image. Let me just say it directly\u2014 I just want to split the family and make my own decisions without so many interventions and problems. With such a good opportunity, would you not grab it, eldest sister-in-law? \u201cThe eldest sister-in-law smiled bitterly.When it came to the separation of the family, she knew about it and yearned to have it more than anyone else.But as the eldest son and eldest daughter-in-law, unless the seniors specifically wanted the younger ones at home and sent the oldest ones out, it was practically customary for the eldest ones to bear the responsibility of taking care of the older generation. Would she dare to suggest something like this?The eldest brother of the Han family would instantly turn against her the moment she mentioned something like this. Don\u2019t be fooled by his honest appearance; in reality, he was a far cry from the well-mannered Old Three.Lin Lan wanted to give her some leeway and not make her life that difficult considering the fact that the eldest sister-in-law took care of them a lot back when they were still stuck at the house.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84So, she followed her back. But once they got there, she didn\u2019t intend to back down from her position as the decision-maker of her own family.Lin Lan and her eldest sister-in-law entered the house. The men hadn\u2019t returned home and they saw their second sister-in-law was gnawing onto a piece of hard and coarse steamed cornbread. Tears and snot were flowing down as she unhappily bit onto the food, expressing her utmost grievance towards her own situation.Lin Lan smiled and commented, \u201cSecond sister-in-law, I didn\u2019t know that you liked to have steamed cornbread that much?\u201dThese days, she wouldn\u2019t even have a bite of the steamed cornbread, so Lin Lan was genuinely curious as to why she was eating it now? Thinking about the time that she asked her how pesticides tasted like, her asking about the sudden tendency to have the steamed cornbread didn\u2019t seem too much of a rude request to her.The second sister-in-law glared at her angrily before she rolled her eyes and didn\u2019t answer. She remained chewing the steamed cornbread with crunches, as if she was gnawing onto a piece of meat.Lin Lan was not going to cook; in this life of hers, she was definitely not going to cook meals for Old Lady Han.Lin Lan walked directly into the east room.The old lady sighed while she stuck a medicinal plaster on her back, complaining about nothing more than stating that her life was hard, her son was not filial and her daughter-in-law was a scary woman.Lin Lan glanced at the old lady and her eyes pierced her facade unceremoniously, \u201cI\u2019ll say, old lady, you don\u2019t need to act anymore. Let\u2019s open the skylight and speak up. This time, no matter what you say or do, I will never seek death nor will I harm myself again. If you make me unhappy, I will return the favour in a different way. I just want to split up the family. Even if I go through hardships and struggles, I can at least eat comfortably by myself. Besides, I wouldn\u2019t need to stay here in a place where my family\u2019s bellies were never full and our nights were never warm whilst still having to deal with your eye rolls and insignificant anger.\u201dOld Lady Han was trembling with anger, \u201cYou, you\u2026you\u2026\u201dShe wanted to refute her but she could not find a chance.Lin Lan\u2019s logical and loud refutes were naturally something that an old rural lady who could only repeat such two-eyed and unfilial remarks could compare with. She continued, \u201cSince the family is divided, then the score should be split in a clear and refreshing way. Allotment, grain, household, and family savings, oh and also, our rations will definitely be taken back. If we don\u2019t get them, then you\u2019ll just have to divide a larger portion for us on the autumn harvest.\u201d\u201cYou- you don\u2019t want to care for the elderly\u2026\u201d the old lady shouted vigorously.Naturally, Lin Lan would not let the old lady interrupt her ongoing momentum, so she continued, \u201cAlso, about the allowance from my children\u2019s father. These years, I believe that you must have at least forked 1800 dollars. Don\u2019t tell me crap like the youngest aunt and uncle need the money for school; I don\u2019t give a damn! We have the responsibility to take care of the two elderly folks, not provide the allowances and the living fees for two useless twats. My own children never had their fill, never slept warmly, never attended school and never saw a doctor when they got sick due to the fact that we didn\u2019t have the money, so why should I take care of other children before mine? You should at least give me about 300 from the money that you have in your hands.\u201d\u201cIn your dreams!

    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85The second sister-in-law was dumbfounded while she still held onto the steamed cornbread. She wanted to speak rudely to Lin Lan but she forgot about it due to the third sister-in-law\u2019s fluency in her speech. She was shocked,\u00a0holy hell, the shrew must have had her mouth switched with the King of the Underworld!The second sister-in-law of the Han family remained stunned by the sidelines. She originally wanted to persuade her to open her mouth and refute everything she said, but her mind wasn\u2019t functioning all of a sudden and she didn\u2019t know what she could say.The mouth of the shrew was usually sloppy with words. So the fact that she became so eloquent in defending herself while shutting everyone up around her was terrifying.Listening to the words she said, they were all things that the second sister-in-law had thought about for a long time but couldn\u2019t say anything due to her standing.How did she know what to say?Every word spoke to her heart.That\u2019s right, why do we have to take care of the two useless beings?The youngest aunt and uncle were always hiding behind the pretence of \u2018studying at school\u2019, but those were just a bunch of nonsense that were conveniently moulded into excuses. If they weren\u2019t good at academics, what was there to learn?\u201cIf you don\u2019t agree, then we can plead the Secretary Head to make a ruling. Let us explain every single event that happened in the past few years. One by one, let\u2019s calculate everything to the last detail; let\u2019s see how you\u2019re going to get away with this! You want us to raise your own children? Not a chance! I still have five of my own that I have yet to raise properly!\u201dOld Lady Han had already started beating her chest and she felt her heart pumping quickly.Everyone had seen this act of hers more times than they could count. The moment Old Lady Han couldn\u2019t outwit her opponent with logic, she would always turn to this method as she was truly angered.Lin Lan still didn\u2019t bother, \u201cI have one more thing to tell you, old lady. Since we have split up the family, we will not refuse the responsibilities of taking care of the elderly either. However, that has to be negotiated and discussed\u2014 at what age should we start from? How should the four brothers take care of you\u2014 are they to take turns or send a representative from their families? However, before the other brothers split their own families, we would not be handing over a single cent or grain either. After all, we don\u2019t know if that counts as \u2018taking care of the elderly\u2019, do we?\u201dLin Lan glared at Old Lady Han, who was the culprit of her anger!The youngest aunt and uncle spent their third brother\u2019s money freely, but look what happened in the end? Not only were they not grateful, but they became insatiable and greedy. They took it for granted. After their third brother changed his career without providing them their allowances, they immediately complained about his incompetence.These were all the same to the veins!According to the story, the youngest aunt used Maisui as a servant and taught her to be vain and twisted. The original owner couldn\u2019t understand that and even thought it was a good thing. And Dawang followed his uncle as he was envious of his lifestyle there\u2014 riding a bicycle and wearing a green military uniform as if he was a main character, but as a result, he was led into fights and became ignorant.Otherwise, how could it be possible for the original owner, an unskilled rural woman, to be able to teach her children to become like that?Children that were spoiled or doted on in the village wouldn\u2019t take work seriously and would always find ways to be lazy. Once kids like these went to the city, where they saw the world and became led astray by others, they were the ones who would most likely become twisted.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Before this, Lin Lan didn\u2019t have much of a good relationship with the original owner\u2019s children. She only thought that it was important to secure a good future for herself.However, after getting along with them and dealing with Old Lady Han\u2019s unreasonable demands, she became extremely mad. She not only decided to change the future for the better, she was going to settle all the accounts from the past as well!After scolding the old lady, Lin Lan felt very comfortable\u2014it was as if she had experienced a full-body spa sensation. Happily, she clapped her hands and hummed a little song. She left afterwards because what point was there in staying behind, waiting for the old lady to put on a sob show again with an audience around?Ha.Old Lady Han remained on the kang and couldn\u2019t get up. She pointed towards Lin Lan\u2019s retreating back in a shaking manner, trembling as if she had Parkinson\u2019s disease.Lin Lan smiled at the dumbfounded eldest sister-in-law and the second sister-in-law, \u201cSecond sister-in-law, eat slowly and make sure you don\u2019t choke.\u201dWhen she walked out of the house, she saw Erwang poking his head in by the door as Maisui led Xiaowang to gaze over from the door of the courtyard. The children in the main room and the second room stared at them with a questionable intent.Wow, there was actually someone who dared to scold grandmother!Lin Lan felt a burst of warmth in her heart as she saw her children, \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong here, let\u2019s go home and have some flatbread.\u201dShe led her children out of the courtyard before she felt a little guilty, wondering if Han Qingsong would argue or fight her if he knew what transpired today.Forget it, I couldn\u2019t care less about him!As long as she didn\u2019t take up physical action, Han Qingsong\u2019s lectures and scoldings were nothing to her.Erwang saw Dawang hiding behind the haystack with his sharp eyes before he called him, \u201cEldest brother, why are you hiding there?\u201dDawang scolded, \u201cYou must have gone blind; I\u2019m no thief, so why would I be hiding? I\u2019m here to catch some birds,\u201d He hurriedly climbed up the tree beside him, causing the small birds that were once resting on said tree to fly away out of fright.Lin Lan, \u201c\u2026\u201dShe looked up and saw that Dawang was hiding his face with a tree branch. She said, \u201cDawang, it\u2019s time for dinner.\u201dThere was a muffled voice sounding from the tree, but she couldn\u2019t really tell if he agreed or disagreed.Lin Lan didn\u2019t want to force the child too consistently, \u201cWhere\u2019s Sanwang? Did he run off to play in the river again? Dawang, look after him for a bit and don\u2019t let him near the big drain in the Southern river; that would be too dangerous of a spot to play in.\u201dThis child, seriously\u2014 when there is a body of water, he wouldn\u2019t even know if pandemonium broke out at home.On the way back, Maisui smiled and said, \u201cMother, eldest brother is embarrassed.\u201dErwang pouted, \u201cNo, the word should be \u2018ashamed\u2019.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say things like that about your eldest brother. He is a good child; after all, the iron pot we now have at home was carried by none other than him.\u201dXiaowang smiled and said, \u201cAnd the rice noodles.\u201dLin Lan pondered,\u00a0was Dawang watching her change in personality on the sidelines with a scrutinising eye? This child!When she got home, she found that there was actually about half a bottle of oil on the stove, two eggs and a small basket of assorted vegetables.Lin Lan looked outside and didn\u2019t see Han Qingsong, but this must have been his doing.\u201cFlatbread, flatbread!\u201d The children jumped around with joy.Lin Lan smiled and said, \u201cToday I\u2019m making scrambled eggs with chives and some flatbread.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87It was rare for them to have such well-harvested chives in this season, so scrambled eggs were one of the best choices she could cook as of now. In her previous life, although her culinary skills were not outstanding, it was still good enough to make a few snacks in order to coax some hungry children.She chopped the chives, cracked two eggs, added a pinch of salt and stirred them well. Then, she also added a teaspoon of oil to the sizzling hot potThe amount of oil that was poured out was too little to be seen at the bottom of the pot, so Lin Lan simply put down the teaspoon and poured the oil out by the bottle.The children, \u201c!!!\u201dNot a single mouth could be closed.Xiaowang climbed on the cabinet and looked inside the pot from the side, \u201cLook, even oil can also form a shadow!\u201d He glared at the puddle of oil in the pot.Maisui dragged him away, \u201cDon\u2019t drip your saliva in.\u201d\u201cMother, this oil is enough for the eldest aunt to cook half a year\u2019s worth of vegetables,\u201d Erwang was stunned and shocked.The eldest sister-in-law did not add oil when making the dishes; she just boiled them in salted water and added a few drops of oil.Lin Lan was a little embarrassed. She was used to being extravagant in her previous life as habit was hard to change abruptly. If she kept this up, she would have to add a notoriety of greed to her name as a shrew in the future. \u201cThe scrambled eggs are not fragrant with less oil. It is better to eat two delicious meals instead of one hundred bland meals.\u201dThe children laughed as they collectively agreed to having delicious food.Erwang, however, was worried that in the future, the family would bottom out as soon as the oil was lathered into the pot. He didn\u2019t want his family to feed on greed for a year, only to return to the desolate states of his grandmother\u2019s extremely frugal lifestyle.Thinking about it like this made him agitated as he hurriedly said, \u201cMother, I\u2019ll help you cook in the future.\u201dMaisui thought that with his suggestion, he was going to take some chances to have some food in secret, so she replied immediately, \u201cWhy would boys be cooking? I\u2019m the girl here, so of course I will be the one to help.\u201dLin Lan felt that it was kind of a good thing for Erwang to help her in cooking. After all, who ever declared that women were the ones who cooked?She thought about Maisui\u2019s attitude in the past\u2014 she didn\u2019t like to study and would always dress up extravagantly. She\u2019d always pull tricks and use her\u00a0 feminine features to make other boys fall for her charms, treating her to lavish lifestyles to feel a sense of pride. Thinking about it, Lin Lan started to get a headache. Brainwashing was implemented when children were merely infants for it to have the best results; in one way, she had to make sure that she continued to teach her well at all times.\u201cMy daughter, no one stipulated that girls must cook and do the housework. Girls should study hard, nurture their self-esteem and self-love, because that is more important than anything else.\u201dMaisui didn\u2019t understand, \u201cIn our village, women are the ones who cook.\u201dErwang also joked around, \u201cGrandmother said that eating like a glutton and being lazy would cause us to not be able to find any partners in the future.\u201dLin Lan cut in, \u201cYour youngest aunt is more of a glutton and a lazy twat than anyone else, so why isn\u2019t she telling her that? Let me tell you\u2014 you will be able to find the person that you want.\u201dMaisui laughed and said, \u201cThen I want to find a family that has an endless supply of white noodles, oil and a load of tickets that will never run out.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88Erwang, \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass yourself\u2014 do you think that someone would want you just because you want them?\u201d\u201cSo what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Lin Lan said, \u201cAmbition should be established from an early age. Let me tell you, first of all, you have to be the type of person that you want to find. For example, if you don\u2019t want to cook and only desire to eat, then you have to be someone who is good at eating. Only then will you be able to find someone who is able to make you a bunch of good food. If you want more white noodles than you can eat, then you have to have the social skills and the ability to strike a deal with such people. If you don\u2019t want to study, you will spend your whole life dealing with people in the village, so at best you might probably have a partner who is a butcher. But if you study hard and go to high school later, you can work in the city. For that to happen, you have to study and do well in the tests to enrol in a university or perhaps, even a named university. Ha! Now that would be amazing! The people you will be in contact with are those from the upper class and the circle of activities would also be composed of cultural citizens. By then, rice noodles and oil will be the least of your luxuries. So, everything starts with you!\u201dLin Lan nodded at Maisui, \u201cFor example, what is the use if you\u2019re in high school and you don\u2019t want to make any sort of academic progress while dressing up all day and staring at the punks of the junior cadres in the class?\u201dMaisui suddenly realised, \u201cMother, are you talking about my youngest aunt?\u201dLin Lan,\u00a0I\u2019m talking about you!Xiaowang, \u201cMother, I want to hear the best voice!\u201dLin Lan kissed his little forehead, \u201cThen you must first develop a pair of ears that can hear.\u201dXiaowang immediately listened to her, \u201cMother, hurrah!\u201dLin Lan, \u201cGee, hurry up, I spent so long talking to you guys!\u201dAfter a while, the pot was sizzling, signalling that the chives and the eggs were finally fried.Lin Lan first scooped out the scrambled eggs, letting the children eat something to satisfy their hunger. Then, she added half a scoop of water to the oil pot and then poured the washed beans and eggplants into it before adding some farmhouse sauce. Then, she rolled the cornmeal into dough balls and flattened them, proceeding to place them in salted water and setting them on the side of the dishes as flatbread.Xiaowang and Erwang were also rushing to flatten the flatbread.The ground pot chicken that was eaten in the modern era was made of pancakes like this. In the future, she would also find a way to make some of that for the children.The chicken would be placed in the middle of the pot, decorated with crispy Chinese crackers on the side. There was no need to clarify how fragrant the aroma would be.While thinking about it, she swallowed her saliva before placing the lid on the pan to let things simmer.Soon, the scent wafted out.\u201cMother, what are you making that smells so delicious? I can smell it all the way from afar,\u201d Sanwang carried a wooden stick, his clothes and his pair of straw sandals. He ran back from the outside wearing only a pair of pants and couldn\u2019t wait to rush into the house, enamoured by the aroma of the food. When he saw a pot of scrambled eggs with chives on the table, his eyes immediately lit up as he reached out and wanted to grab it.Erwang lightly tapped on his brother\u2019s hand, \u201cIf you were going to be wandering around in the water all day, you could have caught a few fish before coming back.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89Sanwang patted his tiny chest, \u201cNo problem, I\u2019ll go get some after a while.\u201dLin Lan hurriedly told him, \u201cDon\u2019t soak in the water all day; you don\u2019t know how dangerous it is. There are leeches in the water, you know? What would you do if they latch onto you and sting you?\u201dSanwang disagreed, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cYou say it wouldn\u2019t, but when it does happen, it would be too late. You are not allowed to go to the Southern drain, so just play around in the West river.\u201dDeep waters were not the same as shallow waters, after all.Sanwang still wanted to quibble, but Han Qingsong came in from outside.When he saw his father, he took the initiative to say hello,\u201dFather, come and eat some scrambled eggs with chives; it smells divine.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t even taken a bite yet, but was already praising its fragrance. Hearing that compliment, Erwang was thrilled.Han Qingsong washed his hands and came in. Seeing that the oil in the wine bottle was almost used entirely, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s grow some peanuts in the front and back of the house in the future.\u201dPeanuts produce a lot of oil, so the family could also subsidise it. Otherwise, they could only wait until the supplement division process at the end of the year.The countryside was different from the city\u2014 certain supplies were not something that they could buy on a monthly basis.Lin Lan looked at his expression before she deduced that he probably didn\u2019t know that she practically scolded his mother. As long as he didn\u2019t hear it from her personally and relied on third-party stories, they would no doubt add their own twists to the incident.Who would have thought that Han Qingsong looked as if nothing had happened; perhaps he didn\u2019t know about it yet.Lin Lan simply didn\u2019t think about it and whispered to Han Qingsong, \u201cHow much can those few plants supply us though? Is there any other way to get some grain and oil..? Because, uh, relying on the supplies alone are not really enough.\u201dShe felt slightly guilty as she wondered how she was going to get him to use his connections to scramble for supplies, despite knowing that it was morally questionable to do so.Erwang was still worrying about things; was it really okay to be this greedy?Who knew that Han Qingsong not only did not resort to a fit of anger and instead, he nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll find a way.\u201dThe point of relying on the supplement division was simply not enough for a whole family to eat; this much was quite obvious.Before the family split up, the old lady restricted everyone from having a full meal. Now that the family was divided, she had the ability to decide for herself, so she would naturally want her children to eat better food and larger fillings.What\u2019s more was that there was still the youngest aunt and uncle who did not contribute their share of earning work points. It was clear that the entire family tightened their belts and starved all day, so it was not surprising that the children\u2019s daily statement was, \u201cMother, I am so hungry, when are we going to eat?\u201dAfter the family was separated, Han Qingsong\u2019s top priority was making sure that his wife and children were going to be well-fed. There was no longer any need to starve themselves daily.Seeing that Han Qingsong agreed so nonchalantly, Lin Lan was a little surprised. She thought that the man who originally upheld his moral principles would most definitely have told her off for being this selfish.But since he had a good attitude towards it, Lin Lan decided to take advantage of the small victory, \u201cWe\u2019ve all split up our homes, so should we ask the Captain to split the accounts for us?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90She could see that the old lady only agreed on the family to split and not the household registration book. The book that recorded the intakes of grain, oil, and non-staple food were still going to be returned to the old lady, which would mean that Lin Lan wouldn\u2019t be able to fully make decisions for her family.Having a household registration book would also record the work points that they earned for themselves. The autumn harvest would also be sent to their own house instead of being merged with the family.If Han Qingsong said something like, \u2018let\u2019s talk about this later,\u2019 she was going to settle this issue herself!Unexpectedly, Han Qingsong nodded again, \u201cLet\u2019s talk after dinner.\u201dLin Lan,\u00a0he\u2019s being this obedient?Did his heart turn cold towards his mother because of how the old lady treated him?\u00a0Thinking about the plot, he was initially mistreated by his wife, whereas in the present, he was mistreated by his own mother.This is kind of funny,\u00a0Lin Lan wanted to laugh at Old Lady Han\u2019s misfortune.Lin Lan looked outside and noticed that Dawang hadn\u2019t returned yet, so when she asked of his whereabouts, Sanwang said that his brother was running around with Zhuzi after bringing the pot home.Sanwang had never been magnanimous when it came to covering for his eldest brother.Lin Lan said to Han Qingsong, \u201cIt\u2019s a problem for Dawang to be outside all day. Should we discuss with the Secretary Head and the principal to send a few of our children to school?\u201dAfter he started to attend classes, Dawang wouldn\u2019t be able to go out that frequently and Sanwang wouldn\u2019t have the time to soak in water all day as well.As soon as she spoke about that, Sanwang instantly started to cry hysterically, hating the idea of it to the bone.Han Qingsong saw that the child was not very interested in going to school. Back then, she said it was crazy for someone to go to school when they could be at home. But now that her viewpoints have changed abruptly, the children might not be able to accept it in such a short time span.He said, \u201cWe\u2019ll figure things out as we go, let\u2019s eat first.\u201dAlthough Han Qingsong didn\u2019t talk much and wasn\u2019t good at joking as he was usually quite serious, he did not ever want to dampen his children\u2019s happiness. Instead, he wanted to focus on the fact that they separated their families and Lin Lan\u2019s efforts, so he shifted their attention back onto the food.\u201cThe flatbreads that mother makes are more delicious and I feel a lot happier compared to eating the time we ate during the New Year\u2019s!\u201d Sanwang bared his big white teeth with joy.Maisui laughed at him, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s more fragrant than the dumplings?\u201dSanwang opened his five fingers and exaggerated, \u201cOf course! I could only eat five dumplings! How could anything be more fragrant than mother\u2019s handmade flatbreads and scrambled eggs with chives?\u201dErwang pointed to his face, \u201cYou can vanquish the entire family\u2019s portion of sauce by yourself, it\u2019s no wonder grandmother doesn\u2019t give you a lot.\u201dSanwang always had sauce all over his face after eating, which was why his grandmother decided not to give him any of it after finding it futile despite telling him to change his eating habits.Xiaowang raised the flatbread in his hand to dip the sauce that was on Sanwang\u2019s face.Lin Lan quickly pulled him, \u201cThat\u2019s dirty, eat it from the bowl.\u201d\u201cMother, why do you still think I\u2019m dirty? I wash everyday to the point where lice wouldn\u2019t even crawl on me. There\u2019s practically no one cleaner than I am in the entire village.\u201dAt this time, the two little ducks shook their backsides and quacked by the door of the main room, poking their heads in.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91Lin Lan said, \u201cThey also soak themselves in water every day.\u201dSanwang pouted and wiped the sauce off his face with his fingers before tasting it himself.Maisui and Lin Lan both found that he was dirty again, so they forced him to wash his face. The whole room was filled with cheerful laughter.Han Qingsong was a little stunned for a while.Just then, the eldest brother and the second brother of the Han family pushed open the door and came in. The eldest brother smiled and said, \u201cI see you guys are eating.\u201dThe second brother sneered and snickered, \u201cI\u2019ll say, Old Three, you guys are becoming really arrogant the moment you split the family. What sort of good food are you guys having? Will you not even send some over to our mother\u2019s house?\u201dAs soon as she saw them, Lin Lan suddenly became nervous. The old lady couldn\u2019t have sent them to argue, could she?At this time, the eldest brother of the Han family was still a little stunned. Before, he and his second brother stood outside the gates of the wooden fenced courtyard. Listening to the laughter and giggles that were audible from inside the house, their hearts were very uncomfortable.Thinking about how they used to fight every day without a day of happiness going by, it made them conflicted to know that laughter and joy were all they could hear once the family split up.Old Three\u2019s family truly had become different.In the past, the third sister-in-law would only pull a dissatisfied expression, opening her mouth to either say dejected words or to curse as she never laughed.At this moment, the eldest brother not only heard her speaking softly, but she was also able to make the atmosphere of the house lively as if she had become someone else entirely.This was also a good thing.It seemed like the saying was true, stating that husband and wife really couldn\u2019t be separated for too long. He used to think that it was good for the Old Three to be a soldier. Now that he had returned, even though he could no longer be part of the military, the most important thing was to make sure that his family was harmonious and happy.Thinking of this, he thought that it was a good thing for the third brother to change his career. And as his eldest brother, he supported it wholeheartedly!Lin Lan hurriedly followed Han Qingsong out to greet them. Seeing that eldest brother Han was holding a small basket in his hand, she could not help but wonder if something was up\u2014 this was not the old lady\u2019s usual way of approach at all.However, upon seeing the second brother\u2019s sour look on his face, she became alert again.The second brother of the Han family had envy painted all over his heart. Besides jealousy, there really was no other emotion that he was feeling.In the past, the allowance of the Old Three made him not desire to split up the family. But now that the Old Three had changed his job and was currently not earning his wages, it was the second brother who wanted to split up the family.It\u2019s a pity that before, both he and his wife had pretended to be the \u2018good people\u2019 to please the old lady. Now, if he were to say that he wanted to split up the family as well, it would seem like he was slapping himself in the mouth.Old Lady Han was not as nice to him as she was to Old Four. It was evident in the way that she would yell and criticize him all the time.So the more he thought about it, the more frustrated he became.He originally wanted to come to the Third Family\u2019s house to see if the seven souls were starving and trying to ignore their thirst from a lack of both food and water. He wanted to see their embarrassment plastered on their faces from his visit.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92As a result, when he heard that they were laughing so happily from a distance, he felt uncomfortable.He was even more annoyed now as he watched them eat.So what better defense mechanism was there for him to instigate than just spew a bunch of words out of jealousy?\u201cI\u2019ll say, Old Three, even if our eldest brother hasn\u2019t been in the army, he knows that filial piety comes first. Yet, you\u2026\u201dLin Lan was not as polite to him as she was to his eldest brother. She grabbed the half-decent broom leaning against the wall in her hand and said coldly, \u201cIf you are not going to speak in a language used by normal humans, then go back to wherever you came from. Don\u2019t wait for my big broom to come and greet you.\u201d\u201cThird Family, what are you talking about?\u201d Second brother subconsciously took a step back for fear that Lin Lan would hit him.He shouldn\u2019t have thought that she was behaving similar to a normal person; in her bones, the shrew\u2019s wicked and violent behavior was very much still present.Eldest brother Han said to the second brother, \u201cYou should go back first, I will have a chat with the third brother.\u201dSecond brother Han was not happy, \u201cEldest brother, I have something to tell the third brother too,\u201d He then turned to look at Han Qingsong, \u201cThird brother, am I not welcome?\u201dHan Qingsong, \u201cSecond brother is thinking too much.\u201dSecond brother Han wanted to go inside the house to see what they were eating, but Erwang had already carried two wooden piers to the door, \u201cEldest uncle, second uncle, take a seat.\u201dEldest brother Han hurriedly said, \u201cMother is afraid that you will not be able to cook well, so she had me bring some pancakes here.\u201dLin Lan couldn\u2019t believe it\u2014 the old lady was willing to send a few pancakes over here? If it wasn\u2019t an underhanded trick to get something from them, then this must have been an initiative taken by the eldest brother and the eldest sister-in-law.Han Qingsong greeted them\u00a0 to have dinner together.Eldest brother Han stood at the door and glanced at the room. There was only a square table with eight chairs in the main room. This was something that was given to the Third Family during his marriage back then, but it could be seen that one of the legs of the table was broken and was subsidized with some bricks. There were two chairs with problematic legs that were set aside as the children didn\u2019t like to sit on. Instead, they grabbed their share of dinner and sat on bricks and logs that they picked up from outside.There was no place for them to sit.Life seemed to be hard for the Third Family.Eldest brother Han couldn\u2019t help feeling sad, \u201cThird brother, go back and get two boards. Then, go to the carpenter to nail some small benches for them,\u201d He sat down on the trimmed logs by the door and greeted the few children, \u201cEat the pancakes, and Mumu asked them to bring them.\u201dLin Lan asked the children to eat the scrambled eggs with their eldest uncle and second uncle. Although reluctant, Maisui still carried the pot out but did not put it down.It was a beautiful sight of green chives and yellow eggs. The two brothers have never seen such beautiful scrambled eggs with chives.Second brother Han was so greedy that his eyes were practically shining and he wanted to take it subconsciously, but he found that he didn\u2019t have chopsticks, so he secretly scolded the girl for being stingy. How was he supposed to eat if he didn\u2019t have the utensils?Then, he discovered something incredible\u2014 although there were fewer eggs and more leeks, the pan was full of oil!How much oil was used for this scrambled egg?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93The eldest brother Han felt distressed for a while.\u00a0Oh god, they just split up and now they\u2019ve used half-a-year\u2019s worth of oil already. How were they going to survive in the future?It\u2019s really not going to be a good life for the Third Family if this goes on.The second child was so jealous,\u00a0Wow, splitting up the family was a good move indeed. They can eat such luxurious scrambled eggs once they split up.\u00a0At home, his monthly intake of food couldn\u2019t even compare to this and he was a man. For women, their monthly intake of food wouldn\u2019t even amount to half of this.Merely watching but not being able to eat, second brother Han scratched his ears and cheeks anxiously.However, eldest brother Han worriedly talked to Han Qingsong, pointing out that it would not be easy to live his life like this. He must know that he should be frugal as firewood, rice, oil and salt were expensive items\u2014 things that he must\u2019ve not known about since he was outstation.Lin Lan responded graciously and thanked him, looking humble and educated.Eldest brother Han was very satisfied, but he started bringing up the split meals. He mentioned that Old Man Han had said that it was unsightly to split their meals. A family should behave like a family, so he asked Han Qingsong and Lin Lan to cease their anger. A family should be living in harmony and not in anger.Han Qingsong glanced at Lin Lan and said, \u201cEldest brother, don\u2019t take it to heart; I truly don\u2019t resent our mother. Even if we split up to take care of our children, we are going to make sure that father and mother are well-fed.\u201dEldest brother Han knew that he wouldn\u2019t lie, so he said a few words from the past to use some help from past sentiments, \u201cThird brother, we will discuss the separation of the family at home tonight. Do you think it\u2019s okay?\u201dHan Qingsong nodded, \u201cSure.\u201d\u201cThird brother, don\u2019t forget about caring for our parents after you split your family. Work points, food, and money shouldn\u2019t be lessened,\u201d Second brother Han guessed that the third brother would still be rich even if he changed his career.Lin Lan was afraid of Han Qingsong\u2019s urge to seal the promise, so she immediately said:, \u201cWe will definitely support the elderly, but they are still fine and not everyone has split their families. Our five children are waiting to eat, so we temporarily don\u2019t have the time to take work points and food. \u201cIf they were going to support the elderly, then they should wait till everyone had split their families. There was no way that their funds should be given to support the old lady\u2019s youngest children.Han Qingsong glanced at her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, elder brother and second elder brother, I will definitely follow my older brothers\u2019 examples.\u201dEldest brother Han felt that Lin Lan\u2019s words were a bit harsh, but he didn\u2019t say anything. He also felt that his third brother was different. If he had asked this before, the third brother would definitely say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry brother, your younger brother will definitely be the first to take care of father and mother,\u201dNow, it seemed like he knew how to take care of his own family first.Second brother Han was not having it, \u201cWhat are you talking about? We aren\u2019t separating our families now, so aren\u2019t we just raising the elderly? Our work points and money are used for the family, so why can\u2019t yours be in the pool either?\u201d\u201cHow about the fact that you have taken advantage of the family points all this time? Eldest brother and the eldest sister-in-law work more laboriously and earn even more; isn\u2019t it an easy life for you if you don\u2019t split up?\u201d Lin Lan sneered. There was no way that she was going to let him take advantage of their situation.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94After all, without Han Qingsong\u2019s allowance before, how could they be so relaxed?After separating, without the money from their side, she was going to see how they\u2019re going to live comfortably!Second brother Han choked on his words, as expected, so it was not surprising to hear his bitter tone reading a script from a play that he must have heard somewhere, \u201cAs expected, only villains and women are difficult to support!\u201dLin Lan confronted each other, \u201cIt\u2019s true that I am a woman, so are you the villain?\u201dSecond brother Han jumped up in anger, \u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201dHan Qingsong clapped his hand, \u201cSecond brother, don\u2019t get aggravated.\u201dWhen he clapped his hands, the loudness rendered second brother Han immobile out of shock, as if he was caught by big iron pliers. His face then turned pale with anger.\u201cOkay, I also know that you no longer place your brothers in your eyes once you split up. I\u2019m leaving,\u201d He lifted his feet angrily and walked away, ignoring the calls from his eldest brother.Eldest brother Han smiled a little awkwardly, \u201cThird brother, don\u2019t divide us brothers even if you are separated.\u201dHan Qingsong, \u201cEldest brother, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t.\u201dUpon listening to Lin Lan\u2019s harsh words, the third brother not only didn\u2019t stop her, but even protected her from his own brother. The eldest brother truly thought that the Third Family\u2019s wife had really binded his third brother\u2019s heart at this point.It seemed that there would be a commotion at home in the future.Eldest brother Han nodded, \u201cThird brother, if you say this, both your brother and father can rest assured. Sigh, mother is sick from grief as she is afraid that you will hold grudges in your heart against her and will not go home in the future.\u201d\u201cHow could it be? Eldest brother, don\u2019t worry, I really didn\u2019t take her words to heart; it just came out as anger.\u201dIn fact, Han Qingsong was not angry at all as he was only angry that he didn\u2019t do a good job in taking good care of his family. If it weren\u2019t for the saying \u2018seeing is believing\u2019, he would never have imagined that this would be the case.After all, after listening to the old lady talk like that, he was still a little cold towards his mother.He was taught by the theory that \u2018everything in the world is not as important as a parent\u2019 since he was a child. He could not resent his parents, but he felt that he was wrong.It was natural for men to be filial to their parents, but it was also their responsibility to protect their wives and children. She was wronged because he didn\u2019t do a good job at fulfilling that responsibility, so he could only find a way to be nice to her.At present, it seemed that he had to solve his wife and children\u2019s nutrition intake, because he could no longer let his wife and children suffer like that.But he was not a person who was good at words\u2014 he relied on actions more and spoke less. Otherwise, with his true abilities, he would not merely be a Company Commander without any real power at this moment. After all, a farm boy had limited knowledge and education, so it was already amazing for him to be able to get this far.Eldest brother Han also asked if they would go for dinner at their parents\u2019 house, but Han Qingsong did not agree to it himself. Instead, he glanced at Lin Lan.Lin Lan said, \u201cEldest brother, I have to cook our own meals after the separation of the family. Besides, I can\u2019t trouble my eldest sister-in-law. She has been cooking for so many years for the entire family, who knows how tired she actually is. Without cooking for another seven members of the family, she would be much more relaxed.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95Eldest brother Han was speechless and had to go home.When he told his parents about the matter, Old Man Han sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as the Old Three have no grudges. The family is made of flesh and blood, so don\u2019t try to aggravate our bonds any further. As brothers, you all would have to support each other.\u201dEldest brother Han repeatedly said yes.Old Lady Han was aggrieved and angry at the moment.She told the old man that the third daughter-in-law scolded her, but he didn\u2019t believe it at all.He said, \u201cIf you were to say that she was threatening you with death threats, I would believe you; but if you\u2019re going to say that she scolded you? If she could scold you, why did she try to hang herself and jump into the river before?\u201d Not only did he not believe it, even second brother Han didn\u2019t believe it.Although the second sister-in-law of Han testified, as the eldest sister-in-law did not say anything, naturally no one believed it.The more the old lady thought about it, the colder her heart became. The more she thought about how her third son questioned her like that and no longer trusted and respected her like he once did before, she felt\u00a0 annoyed and uncomfortable. She kept on feeling like she had something to lose, so she wanted to seize the thing that was going to slip away.Hence, when Old Man Han asked his eldest son to chat with the Old Three to persuade him, she initially agreed to it.Originally, she was sure that the Old Three would come back with the eldest son to make amends and apologise to her. Then, she would force him to give the shrew a good lesson; otherwise, he no longer needed to call her his mother!Who would have ever thought that he didn\u2019t show up! The old lady became more and more sullen and angry as she was eager to wait for Han Qingsong to come and show him what should be done.Just after dinner was over, Old Lady Han laid on the kang and was unafraid of the swelling heat as her heart was beating erratically.At this moment, she heard the children call out to their Third Uncle outside as she sat up instantly. The whirring sound of the fan was barely audible to her as she plotted on ways to show the Old Three just how pissed off she was.She was sure that her son would come over to please her, because that was how he had behaved ever since he was a child. Every time he was scolded, he would just hide and sulk for a brief moment if he was truly unhappy. But in the end, he would always return to please her.He would rush to work and make sacrifices to ensure that his mother would be able to eat the best food that he could get his hands on. Thinking of this, Old Lady Han felt relieved and proud. She felt like her son was still her own son because he was going to listen to her even in the end.Therefore, she couldn\u2019t help but sarcastically utter a few words. After all, the problems of an elder\u2019s accumulated habits would not change until death.\u201cI\u2019ll say, Old Three, you still have the mindset to come and visit your parents? I thought that when you split up, you only remembered your wife and forgot your mother. That shrew scolded your old mother a while ago, so why didn\u2019t you ask her to kowtow to make amends?\u201dHan Qingsong frowned slightly, \u201cMother, Lin Lan is not that kind of person. She only always knew how to torture herself, so how could she dare to scold you?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96\u201cOld Three, are you trying to piss off your mother\u2014\u201d The old lady stretched out her arms and was about to slap Han Qingsong.Han Qingsong quickly supported her arm, \u201cMother, don\u2019t get angry, be careful of your waist,\u201d He helped Old Lady Han to sit back on the kang.Old Man Han told his wife not to make a fool out of herself, urging her to hurriedly sit down in order to get down to business.In the past, she used to use her third daughter-in-law as an excuse to flaunt her control. Now that the daughter-in-law that she deemed as problematic was finally out of her sight, she was trying to pull her tricks again.Although Old Man Han had heard from his eldest son before this, he did not expect that his third son would take the initiative to invite a cadre to preside over the separation of the families. According to his understanding of Old Three, he was usually the obedient child who adhered to his parents\u2019 every word.For example, in the case of the family separation, Old Man Han felt like he shouldn\u2019t mistreat his third son. Even if the old lady tried to manipulate the rations, he was going to fight if it meant getting food and money to his son.He just didn\u2019t expect the Old Three to get the Secretary Head directly. Sigh, a grown-up son wouldn\u2019t strictly abide by his parents, after all.Old Man Han thought about his son changing careers and coming home, expressing his desire to live with his wife and children for the rest of his life. It was natural for him to think that way, and it was also a reasonable train of thought.Didn\u2019t the same apply to me back then?After thinking it through, the old man also reached a conclusion rather emptily as he accepted that his third son had indeed changed.He then thought about his third daughter-in-law who no longer sought death. She was living life properly now and managed to hold a conversation normally, so he was looking forward to their future.\u201cThat\u2019s fine, but even if the family is divided equally, we\u2019re still a family. You brothers shouldn\u2019t be divided and you must support each other.\u201dHan Qingsong nodded, \u201cNaturally, that is how it will remain, don\u2019t worry.\u201dSecond brother Han had brought up Lin Lan\u2019s move of making scrambled eggs with chives and her nasty attitude to his family, adding his versions of twists and turns to the story to make it even more exaggerated. Who would have thought that the old man didn\u2019t comment about it and agreed with the Old Three\u2019s plans. With that, Old Lady Han thought that the old man was trying to go against her!The more hatred she felt, the more her teeth started to grind against each other.At present, her son just wasn\u2019t listening to her words. Old Lady Han felt like her son was possessed by an evil being and replaced her once obedient Old Three. She knew that her coming days were going to be dark.\u201cHmph, don\u2019t worry? With a character like hers, how are we to rest assured? The troubled family will never be at peace with her in itl.\u201d\u201cMother, the family has been separated, there will be no more ruckus,\u201d Han Qingsong said.Old Lady Han became even more angry and the second sister-in-law of the Han family hurriedly said, \u201cMom, the separation of the household registration will not affect the delivery of work points and food to the family. If the family is divided, Old Three should hand in his work points. After all, ours are in the main registration as well.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Han Qingsong, \u201cWe can ask the Secretary Head to help establish a rule about that.\u201d\u201cWhat rules? My words are the rules. What kind of cadres do you need to get just for a family separation? Is it not shameful enough to you?!\u201d Old Lady Han shouted angrily. She asked him to hand over the wages and salaries to the family, but his response was to ask the cadres to make some rules.These rules were clearly meant for her to restrict her movements; he was resenting her, after all.The old lady was about to explode.Han Qingsong said, \u201cFather, the Secretary Head wants to talk to you. I\u2019ll go back and clean up first as the courtyard wall has not been cleaned up yet.\u201dHe had been taking time out to fix the free space around the small courtyard. Even though the courtyard wall was built, something should be used to cover it. Later, he would buy some tiles to finish things up. Otherwise, it would be easily damaged.As soon as Han Qingsong left, Old Lady Han started to cry again as she complained that her son was being unfilial. Old Man Han got a little impatient, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Our son has a nest full of children, so when it\u2019s time to separate, it should be done.\u201cThen why can\u2019t he agree to my terms of providing for the elderly? Even if he doesn\u2019t have allowances, he should at the very least provide his work points to the main family,\u201d The old lady said rather confidently.However, the old man didn\u2019t abide by her wishes, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it later. For a couple with five children, it\u2019s not bad for them to be able to support their family.\u201dIf the allowance weren\u2019t going to be as abundant as it was before, it would be difficult for the Third Family to raise their children, let alone fulfil the third daughter-in-law\u2019s wishes to have all her children go to school.It was already very difficult for one child in the family to go to school, let alone five.Old Man Han actually didn\u2019t agree with her wishes, but he didn\u2019t want to impose on them or be considered \u2018annoying\u2019, so he never brought it up. He preferred to let things play out naturally as the Third Family would realise it\u2019s a bad idea once they start to starve just to send their kids to school.Besides, it was necessary for the children to try studying before they could determine whether or not they were academically intelligent enough to keep up with the school\u2019s systems.The old lady disagreed, \u201cWell, Jinbao and Jinyu still have to go to school. Both of them need the money\u2026\u201dOld Man Han, \u201cIf the two of them graduate and find jobs, they\u2019re not going to use that much money either\u2026\u201d\u201cHow can I not spend so much money on them? For their tuition and miscellaneous expenses, I have to buy books, food and clothes for them. Besides, finding a job requires connections\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish speaking, the old man had a sour expression on his face, \u201cThe children in this house can never have their full share of food; every single one of them are as frail as a twig. How can you still afford to dress the two of them up while there are kids starving under this roof? That is merely the actions of an insane person!\u201dIf you weren\u2019t like this, do you think that Old Three would change his attitude this drastically?\u00a0Old Man Han knew that even though Old Three never expressed his frustrations outright, he definitely harbored some form of resentment in his heart.He got off the kang, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go to the Secretary Head and have a chat to see how tomorrow\u2019s division can be settled.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98He had to estimate the amount of food, firewood, household items and money in the house before talking to the Secretary Head to make the appropriate calculations. He would also rather have some form of mental preparation before the actual discussion tomorrow.The old man led the eldest son away, but the old lady refused to back down and said to the second son, \u201cNo, how can the four of you brothers just split the family when you declare it to happen! Go, get Jinbao back home; if you\u2019re going to split, then he should get his share as well. Also, find a way to get your eldest sister to return and have her seek justice on my behalf!\u201dOld Two looked outside and he said in distraught, \u201cMother, even if you want me to get them, I can only do that tomorrow. At this moment, the sky is already pitch black.\u201dOld Lady Han snorted, \u201cEvery single one of you is useless. In the end, I still have to rely on my Jinbao and Jinyu.\u201dHer youngest son was nicknamed Jinbao, but his real name was Han Qinghua. Her youngest daughter was called Jinyu(1)\u2014 these two were her most beloved children.(T/N: Jinbao refers to \u2018Precious Golden\u2019 and Jinyu is known as \u2018Golden Jade\u2019. Hence, both of her children are literally the Golden Children of the family)Hearing her start to nag again, Old Two and his wife hurried to hide themselves, so as not to be caught and scolded by the old lady.When there was no one in the room, the old lady jumped up and hurriedly closed the door. She then took a copper key from her waist and opened the wardrobe in front of the kang before she took out a wooden box from it.The small money and notes she saved were wrapped in a handkerchief and locked within a box on the shelf. The box with the money was then placed on the head of the kang.But after thinking about it, she took out most of the money and hid it inside a pair of small shoes. Tying it with a leg strap and hiding it under the quilt, she locked the boxes and the cabinets separately.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Early the next morning, the old lady asked the second brother to borrow a bicycle. First, he went to Linhe Village that was six miles away to deliver a letter to her eldest daughter, Han Daman\u2019er, before delivering more letters to Han Jinbao and Han Jinyu.Han Daman\u2019er was the eldest daughter of the old lady and was two years younger than her eldest brother. She was not favored in the family and had been through her share of working tirelessly for her parents. However, she didn\u2019t think that she had it rough as she liked being nosy.In particular, she liked to trail behind Old Lady Han and bark out her own orders.When she didn\u2019t have any children, she kept quite a low profile. Later, after having two sons, she straightened her back and even dared to contradict men. Soon, she wasn\u2019t that filial and obedient towards her mother anymore.Afterwards, she perceived herself as having a high standing and liked to be the \u2018main character\u2019 in every incident. Also, she especially enjoyed coming back home to meddle with her brother\u2019s affairs.The contradiction between Lin Lan and her mother-in-law was also something that she frequently participated in.Every time Han Qingsong came back, she would always show her standing as an eldest sister. Han Daman\u2019er would lecture her younger brother and use those \u2018filial piety\u2019 words that she had learned to scold Han Qingsong and suppress Lin Lan.When Han Qingsong was not at home, she would return and bicker with Lin Lan every once in a while. Countless times she had used her authority to tell Lin Lan the basic rules such as to abide by women\u2019s ethics, obey the rules, be filial to her mother-in-law, respect her eldest sister and so on.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99At any rate, she would always find something to comment about; be it Lin Lan\u2019s roles as both a wife and a daughter-in-law.Lin Lan didn\u2019t want to see her at all. In fact, she wished that she would never have to see her again!Now that the families were separated, any work done was considered their own. Throughout the entire morning, Lin Lan felt like she had otherworldly strength and energy to work.Therefore, it was said that one shouldn\u2019t eat the big pot of collective rice, nor should one eat from the large pot of rice from the family. Instead, one should have rice from the small family pot(2).(T/N: Refers to one not having to share the resources within a large group. You would feel a better sense of accomplishment if the effort you did belonged to you)When she came home from work in the afternoon, Han Qingsong took the household registration book, the rations book and whatnot back to Lin Lan.Lin Lan quickly opened them to take a look. In the rations book, in addition to the column for grain, there was also a column meant for non-staple food. In the future, if kerosene, cooking oil, vermicelli, firewood, etc. were distributed, they would all be counted here.Holding this book, Lin Lan was so happy that she felt like she could fly. The person in charge of the book was the one who was in charge of the house, which meant that they would be eligible to receive those supplies in the future.Thousands of undivided daughters-in-laws would be jealous of her current standing!She was so excited that her heart was already dancing in a free and liberating rhythm. Twirling around in the house for two times didn\u2019t seem to be enough, so she jumped up and gave Han Qingsong a kiss on the face.When her soft lips came in contact with the hard stubble on his face, she finally came to her senses as she realized what she was doing. Holy heck, what was she thinking?!Her foot twitched for a moment and she almost fell.Han Qingsong supported her in time before he looked at her with deep eyes.Lin Lan\u2019s heart thumped loudly before she hurriedly pretended to be nonchalant and said, \u201cAiya, I got excited for a while; don\u2019t think too much about it.\u201dIn order to hide her gaffe, she hurried to the yard and hugged Xiaowang, who was singing to the ducklings to make them grow up quickly. Then, she gave him a kiss on the cheek as well.Han Qingsong, \u201c\u2026\u201dShe was his wife, so was he not allowed to think much about it?\u201cMother, what are those?\u201d Xiaowang was curious about the account books in her hand.\u201cThe household registration book and the rations book. In the future, your mother will be the master of the house,\u201d She touched Xiaowang\u2019s head, \u201cMother wants you to go to school, study, eat well, clothe yourself and eat delicious food!\u201dThe little ducklings quacked.Xiaowang: \u201cThis is my mother, what are your names? Your mother is named Egg, so\u2026 Ah, you\u2019ll be Eggskin!\u201d He pointed nonchalantly towards the shells of the eggs that were left discarded by the wall.Lin Lan, \u201c\u2026\u201dDuring the meal, Erwang took the initiative to run back to help Lin Lan, carrying two palm-length carp in his hand, \u201cMother, Sanwang picked up a broken sieve from the Brigade to catch some fish from the Northern River.\u201dThat kid was pretty amazing in his own right. So many weren\u2019t able to catch any sort of fish from the rivers but he was able to. She guessed that this was a skill that he had developed from soaking in numerous bodies of water all day.Smelling the smell of fish, the two little ducks immediately came over with their short tails waving excitedly.Xiaowang hurriedly carried them back to the fence one by one, \u201cEat your vegetables, they\u2019re delicious.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100Lin Lan was very glad to see that Xiaowang was a bundle of joy throughout the entire day. Now that she thought about it, she realized that Xiaowang merely didn\u2019t find the need nor the want to speak back then, so he didn\u2019t. Now that he had started to talk, he seemed like any other normal child.She wanted to kill the fish, but she was a little stuck in her thoughts in her head to the point where she almost made a hole in her hand.When Han Qingsong saw it, he took the fish from her and scraped the fish scales. He then dismantled the belly, washed it clean, and then threw it in the basin.The fish was still jumping around.Lin Lan,\u00a0It seems like cooking is really not that simple.Han Qingsong looked at Erwang, \u201cCome here!\u201dErwang looked at his father with a serious face and felt a little frightened in his heart. However, as he was never actually beaten by his parents, he pulled a brave face and walked over, \u201cFather.\u201dHan Qingsong handed him the knife, \u201cI\u2019m going to teach you how to kill fish.\u201dErwang hesitated for a while, \u201cHow about letting Sanwang\u2026\u201d\u201cThe first step is to hold the gills with the left hand and the knife with the right hand\u2026\u201dErwang subconsciously obeyed the order.\u201cThe second step\u2026\u201dWith both command and action, although the process was a little bumpy, there was some form to the filleting of the fish. Besides, the fish hadn\u2019t fallen apart either.Lin Lan,\u00a0Chef Erwang, I will rely on you in the future!\u201cErwang, you\u2019re doing great!\u201d Lin Lan also went over and kissed the top of his head, \u201cWe will have fish to eat in the future. Let\u2019s make some fish soup today!\u201dShe didn\u2019t worry about the lack of tofu. There were soybeans that were ripening in their private plot of land at the moment. She could go grab a bowl and come back, before she took out something to smash it. Putting it in the dish and simmering it in the soup would make it equally delicious.Lin Lan waited for the pot to heat up before she poured a little oil. Then, she placed the fish inside and fried it so that the fish soup would turn out to be fragrant.While stuffing the soybeans into the fish soup, she added some rice noodle pancakes with a dash of eggplants on top. After the soup was boiled and then simmered for a while, it would be steamed in order for them to save some firewood.Twenty minutes later, when the pot was opened, the aroma wafted out into the room. The aroma was so strong that it could be smelled on the streets.The people who were just finishing up work and chatting in the courtyard of the Brigade were especially affected as they asked, \u201cWow, what is that fragrant smell? There\u2019s even someone who\u2019s making fish? What a particular lifestyle.\u201dEveryone in the neighbourhood gave the scent a whiff and they exclaimed, \u201cWhere is it coming from?!\u201dThe shrew\u2019s house?Impossible!\u201cNow that the family has been separated, the shrew isn\u2019t acting up. I\u2019m telling you fellas, you should separate your families in order to cure some illnesses.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dAt this time, Han Daman\u2019er helped the old lady to the back of the room as if she was a female cadre.A few days ago, when Lin Lan drank the pesticides, she wanted to come and give her a good lecture. It was just too bad that she couldn\u2019t find the time to do so. Later, when her brother came back, she wanted to show herself as well. Who would have thought that he of all people, had picked a fight and went against Old Lady Han.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
