Instead, he did not forget how he came to the Ling family, so he practiced harder and more diligently, and vowed never to be driven away by the Ling family, or the grandfather who lives with him, Suffering again.The Ling family stipulates that all outside disciples who cannot break through the twofold of Wumai within one year must be cleared out, or they can simply become the servants of the Ling family.At this time, only one month left before Ling Xiao entered the Ling family.Call! what!The young man's arms were waving, the tigers were breeze, and the explosion in his mouth was full of fighting spirit.Ling Xiao knows what will be the result of waiting for himself after one year, but he will not give up.

Alas, it would be nice if there was a breakthrough Dan.\"has been practicing for a long time, Ling Xiao took out a water bag and drank saliva, thinking of his helplessness.Through this observation for nearly a year, he can understand that he is no worse than anyone. It can even be said that because of the hard work, it is reasonable to say that cultivation should enter the country faster.In fact, the problem still lies in the exercises and immortality.Ling family members and those wealthy outside disciples either have a higher level of cultivation practice, or they have the money to buy Breakthrough Dan to help break through.Those disciples with double Wumai basically used Breakthrough Dan.This medicine is not too expensive and has no side effects, but Ling Xiao just can\u2019t afford it. The Ling family can provide him with food and drink. It is already the greatest benevolence and it is impossible to give him money.\"Go away, I already told you this waste, this is my exclusive land, you are not qualified to practice here!\"When the sun had risen completely, it was already an hour later, Ling Xiao packed his things and prepared to leave, because he did not want to conflict with the people of the Ling family.\\n\u3000\u3000It was still late.screamed, it was Ling Chong, a disciple of the Ling family.During the speech, Ling Chong even jumped on the high platform and pushed towards Ling Xiao.

This was not the first time the other party had treated him like this.\"Joke, you think Lao Tzu really likes to bully you of waste, but your ears don't work anymore, I have warned you not to practice martial arts here, and don't infect us with your waste gas.\"Ling Chong looked at Ling Xiao, his eyes revealing playfulness and playfulness.Yes, he was deliberate, but what about that, all the outside disciples who have expanded in, dare not listen to him on this Ling Xiao, who would you like to trouble without asking Ling Xiao?The disciples of the Ling family have a natural sense of arrogance. They feel that the expanded outside disciples are just servants in the name of the disciples and can be driven at will.So almost all outside disciples have been bullied by their disciples.

He also had to take care of his grandfather, too far.\"Ling Chong, you are really useless. You can't even push this outside boy to practice martial arts. How do you mix it up?\"\"Yeah, anyway, you are also a martial arts double warrior, this kid is a heavy martial art, you are not as powerful as him?\"\"Hurry up, Ling Chong, drive this kid away, we still have to train.\"Ling Chong is either a native disciple, or an outside disciple who has taken refuge in these native disciples. Anyway, they are all like to watch the lively master.After all, it\u2019s not too much to watch the excitement.\"His mother, you dare to look down on Lao Tzu, I will shoot this kid now with a palm and let him know what a warrior is!\"Ling Chong was stimulated by the stimulus, and looked at Ling Xiao with contempt. He suddenly took a palm shot and printed it directly on Ling Xiao's chest.\"is that enough?\"Ling Xiao's mouth overflowed with blood, but he did not fall down, nor did he fly out.He can fly out to avoid injury, but he doesn't want to, once a person has a flinch and a fear, then he will develop such a problem.\\n\u3000\u3000 He was reluctant!\"This kid! Look for death!\" Ling Chong was angry and flew to kick Xiao Ling.Ling Xiao suddenly spurted blood out, frightened Ling Chong to evade quickly, this foot actually kicked out, and flew directly out of the training martial stage.looked at Ling Chong under the training martial arts platform, Ling Xiao showed a smile on his face, and then shook his body, fell to the ground, and fainted.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Come and drink medicine!\"The old man sighed and brought a bitter herbal soup.From Grandpa's mouth, Ling Xiao heard concern and helplessness.\"Hey, it's okay, this is not the first time, anyway, I'm not convinced.\"Ling Xiao laughed and said: \"When I break through the double of Wumai, I will go to Ling Chong to settle the account!\"\"You kid.\"\\n\u3000\u3000The old man sighed. Although Ling Xiao was the child he picked up, he always watched it as a grandson.Seeing Ling Xiao hurt, he was not particularly interested in it.Lingxiao passed the herbal soup that had been emptied and drank it in one breath, with a smile on his face.In fact, he refused to be soft, not only because of his stubbornness in his temperament, but also for another reason.That is, since he practiced the incomplete exercise, his body's recovery speed is particularly fast.used to be stunned several times like today, but he woke up in less than half an hour, and his body recovered.

Why?\" Ling Xiao exclaimed.\\n\u3000\u3000 After entering the Ling family, it is possible to learn better martial arts skills and to be able to stand out.

In a month, he still had confidence to break through, but half a month, this is really too urgent.However, the blow is far more than that.The old man's words haven't been finished yet.\"Also, even if it breaks into Wumai Double in this half month, it will only temporarily retain the qualifications of the outer disciples. If you can\u2019t reach the triple of Wumai before the age of 14, the outer disciples must all become Ling. Domestic servants, otherwise abolition of martial arts and expulsion from the Ling family.\"\"This is too much!\"Ling Xiao understands very well that he is 13 years old this year, and he is 14 after the Chinese New Year. How can he reach the Wumai triple.If you become a servant, it means that your grandfather will not be eligible to continue to live in the Ling family. How could he stay here with peace of mind?\\n\u3000\u3000 This is no longer a question of face, but a matter of survival.Not to mention, when he was selected by the Ling family, the beggar brothers who had begged together before were very envious.If he just left the Ling family, what other face did he have to return to the beggars?\"Yeah, people are big families, naturally have their own rules, we are only outsiders after all.\"The old man suddenly smiled and said: \"Forget it, it's really impossible for the old man to go back and beg for it.

I will work harder than before and strive to reach the triple realm of Wumai before the age of fourteen! I must let you pass. Good day.\"He gritted his teeth and clasped his hands tightly.Fight!\"Boy, you are now desperate enough. If you try harder, you will not break through the realm and your body will collapse.\"The old man sighed: \"We still have to understand the reality, and it will be almost impossible to break through the twofold of Wumai within half a month. Let's plan early.\"\\n\u3000\u3000 Ling Xiao felt like a pot of cold water was splashing on his head.Yeah, I haven't been able to break through in a year, so why can I break through in half a month?He kept sinking in one heart, and the most feared thing was that it was useless to try harder.If it is a month, it would be fine, then at least there is still 30% or 40% certainty.But for half a month, although he did not want to admit it, the fact is that unless a miracle is encountered, it will never be possible.\"Children, don't be too sad.

You succeed, they are happy, they fail, they will accept you.\"Be a beggar again and again?\"Do not!\"Ling Xiao shook his head firmly: \"Grandpa, have you forgotten how we were bullied on the street?\"\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Don't you forget how the dog was beaten to death?\"\"Don't you forget that the heart-wrenching and poisonous people have used the food of the child-bearing medicine for us?\"\"That time, more than a hundred brothers died!\"\"But we can't resist, that person has the protection of the martial arts, we went to several people, all of them were broken legs!\"\"Don't you want us to continue to live like a pig or a dog?

He suddenly thought that there was such a village in the painting he had seen before. Looking at the structure, it was basically the same.The village is quiet and free from disputes, making people feel very comfortable.But Ling Xiao is very anxious.

Cosmic Flood, Natural Tribulation, Warrior Sleep, Restoration Today! Someone came...\"\\n\u3000\u3000 Suddenly, a woman came from afar, stepping on the empty, void, like a fairy in a heavenly palace, amazing.The sound was a little hollow and deep, as if it had not come from the same space.\"Who is a fairy?\"Ling Xiao asked nervously.\"You don't need to know who I am or where I come from, you just need to know that from today onwards, you have awakened the \"Mountain Wuwu Soul\", you are the master of the mountain and the master of the world!\"The woman has been walking, but it seems that she can never walk in front of Ling Xiao.\"Shan Wu Wu Hun? Master of the river? Master of the world?\"Ling Xiao himself wants to laugh, is there a warrior with a heavy line of art, can you bear this?But Wu Hun had heard of it.As early as in the ancient times, martial artists were able to cultivate martial spirits, but then a great disaster occurred between heaven and earth, and the martial spirits disappeared.Is it possible that I have awakened the extinct Wuhun?\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Since the ancient times, humans began to practice martial arts in order to resist the invasion of the ten thousand people.

Maybe you are the answer...\"After speaking, the woman's figure became farther and farther, and eventually disappeared at the end.At the same time, Ling Xiao felt his body fluttering lightly, and then his vision was blurred again. When he could see something, the person had already returned to the original room.The broken book has long disappeared without a trace, which makes Ling Xiao almost certain.I was definitely not dreaming before, it was a very real scene.\"Shanhe Wuhun? What will it do?\"Ling Xiao was very confused, because until now, he hadn't discovered the specific role of Wu Wushun.What is the master of mountains and rivers, what king of all races, is too far away from him.He now only wants to break through the Wumai double, and then continue to work hard to break through the Wumai triple.Think about it, anyway, the book is gone, and I can't continue to practice. I can only continue to practice \"Bull Power\".\\n\u3000\u3000 has been in a coma for so long, wasting too much time.He jumped out of bed, intending to move his muscles, but in the moment of exerting a lot of strength.He was stunned!Because just when he was practicing his strength, there was also a figure in the mountain and river map who was practicing it.The only difference is that the man in the mountains and rivers has truly achieved the point of fascination.The simplest basic martial arts are quite powerful. In the hands of the people in the painting, there are no flaws.Ling Xiao froze on the spot.After a while, he suddenly woke up and hurriedly re-run according to the action of the person in the picture.is completely different from the previous feelings.

He didn\u2019t go, and he practiced repeatedly in the room.He didn't stop practicing until his movements were exactly the same as those of the person in the picture.It was already the next morning, and he was so excited that he didn't sleep all night.\"Child, get up for breakfast.\"Grandpa's voice was heard outside the door.\"coming.\"Ling Xiao was out of the room, and Grandpa had prepared breakfast.Because of their low status in the Ling family, there was very little ration.

What's the situation?\"While eating, Ling Xiao discovered something unexpected again.Two pictures appeared in the picture of mountains and rivers.One picture shows the grandfather of Ling Xiao, which accurately points out the various physical problems of Grandpa Ling Xiao.\"Grandpa, what's wrong with your ribs?\"If there are no pictures of mountains and rivers, Ling Xiao will never find out that one of Grandpa's ribs is actually broken.And this is a new crop!According to the analysis of the mountain and river charts, it was hit by a palm.\"It's okay, is it okay?\"The old man shook his head in a hurry.

He is very much like knowing whether Shan Wu Wu Hun can also practice his opponent's martial arts. If he can, then he really needs carp to jump the dragon gate.On the martial arts field, Ling Chong was playing with a few female disciples, and it seemed that he didn't care about others' lives at all.This guy interrupted Grandpa Ling Xiao's ribs, and he didn't even mean to ask the doctor to see it.Seeing this scene, Ling Xiao's eyes brewed a fierce fire of hatred.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This palm clearly looked like the palm of a normal person.However, what is peculiar is that, in Ling Xiao's eyes, it turned into a giant palm, which is really like the palm of a giant.This palm actually made Ling Xiao see a giant, a giant who could shoot him to death.\"This is \"Julin God Palm\", I remember it seems to be an advanced martial arts!\"Children of the Ling family, naturally have good eyesight, recognizing Ling Chong's palm method, could not help but exclaim.\"What a joke, Ling Chong's strength is nothing more than a martial arts double martial arts.

They can only learn basic martial arts. From the starting line, they have already lost to others.Without Shan Wu Wu Hun, he was afraid that it would be difficult to stand out.At that moment, under the enormous pressure of advanced martial arts, Ling Xiao actually smiled.Of course he smiled.Because there was another Ling Chong in the picture of the mountain and river, the weakness and flaws exposed by this Ling Chong's display of the giant palm were all pointed out one by one.Of course, no one else knew this, only Ling Xiao knew it.However, even if you know Ling Chong's flaws, if you want to hit with a single hit, you must seize the opportunity.Fortunately, he has been practicing hard during this year, coupled with being bullied by Ling Chong, the experience of duel is still very rich.What's more, he has been transformed by Wu Wushun's body for a long time, whether it is reaction or feeling, he has improved more than several times.

Look at the destruction of my giant **** palm!\"There are only four strokes in total, and the destruction of this stroke is the most powerful and is used to kill people.Although Ling Chong was unable to exert the real power of this trick because of his strength, he felt that it was easy to deal with Ling Xiao, who had only one Wumai.The so-called destruction is the momentum of ruining the world.Ling Chong could not do it, but in the eyes of those around him, his whole person had turned into a virtual condensed phantom at this time, and a huge golden giant palm shot towards Ling Xiao.\"So fast! So ruthless!\"The onlookers who were forced by the breath of terror continued to improve their understanding of advanced martial arts.This move came out, Ling Xiao is not a defeat, but a death!Although the disciples of the Ling family are not allowed to marry each other, it is okay if they are injured, but if they kill, they will be severely punished.However, Ling Chong is the son of Jiuye and the grandson of Ling's family owner. Who was afraid of?At the moment when many people felt that Ling Xiao was going to die, Ling Xiao moved.\\n\u3000\u3000 His body seemed to turn into a savage cow and ran into Ling Chong's arms directly.Lin Chong didn't realize what was going on, and the whole body flew out like a kite with a broken thread.Snake and hit seven inches!Although Ling Xiao used basic martial arts, he just hit Ling Chong's flaws, making Ling Chong's powerful palm a joke.What happened?How did it fly out of Ling Chong?Because Ling Xiao's movements were so fast, they didn't even see what happened.\"My rib!\"Ling Chong fell to the ground and screamed.\"I said, those who hurt my grandfather, absolutely not spare, if you want to defeat me, I will defeat you with one stroke!\"Although I was nervous and excited, I couldn\u2019t even believe it was true, but Ling Xiao, who grew up in a beggar heap since childhood, UU reads the book www. uukanshu.com shows a calmer attitude among people of different ages.He knew why he defeated Ling Chong.\\n\u3000\u3000The analysis and exercises of Wu Wushun, together with his hard work on weekdays, formed today's ending.But what puzzled him a little was that at the moment of his attack, he seemed to feel his body turned into a blast of wind?That speed is much faster than usual!Isn't that the other role of Shan Wu Wu Hun?\"Ling Chong defeated, my goodness, am I right?\"\"Really defeated, and the ribs were interrupted!\"\"What's going on with Ling Xiao just now, is it so powerful?\"The scene was already full of vocals because they were so shocked that Ling Xiao, who was not optimistic at all, actually hit Ling Chong seriously with one stroke.\u2026\u2026\"Ling Xiao, you are too vicious, I didn't use all my strength, but you want my life!\"Lin Chong seemed to care more about his face than the pain of broken ribs, so he lied and said a completely unreasonable fart.However, this totally unreasonable reason is actually supported by some people.\\n\u3000\u3000 \"No wonder I said that Ling Xiao can win. It turns out that Ling Chong kept his hand, and this Ling Xiao doesn't know too much!\"The disciple of the Ling family in the crowd said deeply.defeated Ling Chong, but in their view, Ling Chong represented his disciples. This defeat was so ugly that it was a shame for the entire disciples.\"Keep your hands?\"Ling Xiao could not help but sneered. According to the analysis and exercises of the mountain and river charts, Ling Chong's palm could not wait to shoot him. The so-called keeping hands is pure nonsense!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It turns out that the children of the Ling family are like this!\"Facing Ling Chong's sophistry and everyone's discussion, Ling Xiao just threw the next sentence and turned away.Ling gritted his teeth.He yelled at Ling Xiao: \"Little beggar, just look around and wait for me to recover from the injury, and will never keep your hand on you again!\"After speaking, he was also covering his chest, and his face was ugly and left by two outside disciples.In Ling Chong's view, he lost to Ling Xiao today only to underestimate the enemy.used to do it, but the kid didn't fight back, but today he took the initiative to fight back.No, he had to hone it again, and Ling Xiao must pay the price next time!\u2026\u2026\\n\u3000\u3000Ling Xiao returned home, told Grandpa that he had defeated Ling Chong, and then returned to the house to continue practicing.He knew very well that he was lucky to win Ling Chong today.First, the other party underestimated the enemy, and secondly, he relied on the effect of Wu Wushun.But that is not real strength after all.Ling Chong's advanced martial arts are second only to the top martial arts in secular martial arts. If it is really good, then the mountain and river martial arts can analyze the flaws, and Ling Xiao may not be able to catch it.So Ling Xiao has long thought about it, and the iron has to be hard, and the help of Shan Wu Wu Hun is certainly good, but his own strength is the key.If you can reach the second line of martial arts and break through the second martial arts, then maybe Ling Chong can't underestimate the enemy, and you can win Ling Chong once again with the help of Shan Wu Wu Hun.But it certainly won't work now. After all, know that every opening of the martial arts will bring a huge improvement in strength.The difference between Wumai No. 1 and Wumai No. 2 is very large.The human body has nine Wumai, so it is also called Wumai Jiuzhong.Each triple is a stage.\\nThe first stage, the first three levels, is also called the awakening stage.As the name suggests, it is to awaken the strength of the martial arts, strengthen the body, and lay the foundation for martial arts practice.Generally speaking, during the awakening phase, each time a martial arts is opened, the body strength will increase by one to two hundred pounds.At the same time, the true energy in the body will also increase by 100 standard points.The standard point is the unit of the warrior Qiqi. Generally, the warrior will not say such trouble, but directly say how much Qiqi.The battle between martial artists, in fact, often determines the victory or defeat is the strength and the content of true energy.That is to say, a warrior with a heavy Wumai than a warrior with a double Wumai not only loses one or two hundred pounds of strength, but also loses one hundred points of true energy. It is very disadvantageous in battle.That's why when Ling Xiao defeated Wu Chong's Ling Chong by one stroke of Wu Mai's strength, those people would be so surprised.So much so that they are even willing to believe even very absurd reasons.One or two hundred catties of strength and one hundred points of true energy is really important for a warrior.Therefore, when Ling Xiao felt that he was temporarily unable to obtain higher-level martial arts classics, the best way was to break through quickly.\\n\u3000\u3000 As long as he arrives at Wumai Duplex, he is eligible to enter the Ling Family's Bookstore and choose a higher level martial arts classic.Wumai Duo is a turning point.Thinking of this, Ling Xiao no longer hesitated.He began to practice repeatedly in his own room.Of course, every drill is done according to the action of the figure in the picture of Shanhe.There are only nine styles.At present, Ling Xiao can do exactly the same actions as the figure in the mountains and rivers, but only the first three types.This is not enough.Once again!twice!three times!\\n repeatedly! Keep practicing!Ling Xiao not only found that all his movements became smooth and extremely smooth, but every move and every type seemed to contain more powerful force than before.Of course, what made him most happy was that after more than ten times, in addition to the first three types, the fourth, fifth, and sixth types of the latter also finally reached perfection.But the surprise is much more than that.During every practice, he can find that there is energy from the mountain and river Wuhun slowly flowing into his Dantian Wumai.This mountain and river Wuhun seems to be able to transform natural energy into true energy, and then let the warrior have it!Although this is only Ling Xiao's guess, if this thing is true, then no matter what exercises Xiao Ling practices in the future, the final cultivation effect may be much better than others.After all, he is cultivating, and Shan Wu Wushun is also helping him to cultivate, which can be improved quickly.In addition, he also discovered that there was a change in the mountain and river martial arts spirit, that is, the mountain and river map that only exposed the corner of the village in the clouds and mist, and the exposed images gradually increased.Although only a little increase, but this represents a possibility.The effect of the mountain and river Wuhun may not have been fully excavated by him. When the cloud above completely disappears, the mountain and river map is completely presented. Perhaps the real sense of mountain and river Wuhun is completely awakened.\\n\u3000\u3000Work harder and continue to work hard!Although he knows very little about Wuhe Soul of Mountains and Rivers, Ling Xiao knows that at least this thing is harmless to him.Once again, he started to practice it again and again, tirelessly, and this time, he chose the last three methods that had not been perfected for intensive practice.has been dark from morning to night, except for the meal time, he has hardly rested.The final result is that the seventh and eighth forms are also perfect. He estimates that as long as he can perform the ninth form perfectly, he should be able to break through the double imprisonment of the martial arts.But after all, he was not a machine, but a 13-year-old child. In the end, he fell asleep on the ground after practicing.The next morning, the first thing Ling Xiao got up from the ground was actually practice again.No way, UU reading www. uukanshu.com's strong sense of crisis and pressure forced him to work hard.Poor he is not even qualified to practice martial arts field now.Know that the reason why the martial arts field will be scrambled is not just a matter of face.Because the training ground was built by the Ling family's ancestors with special materials, the stone bricks on the ground are special.\\n\u3000\u3000Practice there, not only consume less energy, but also gain more.\"One day, I will not only go to the martial arts field to practice in a fair and honest manner, but also let my grandfather live in a better house.\"Now this broken house, once it rains, it can't leak, it's almost the same as the broken temple where I used to be a beggar.This morning, Ling Xiao put the focus of cultivation on the ninth form, and practiced repeatedly.After more than a hundred drills, he felt a kind of unprecedented comfort and joy.Nine styles of Manu Niu Jin have been perfected, exactly the same as the people in Shanhetu.\"The room is too narrow, it is better to go outside and try its power!\"After Ling Xiao has trained the manpower to perfection, I really want to try the power of this basic martial arts.So he went out, but instead of going to the martial arts field, he went out of the door of the Ling family and came to a small wood outside.\"Drink!\"With a loud binge, Ling Xiao seemed to turn into a roaring barbarian, directly hitting a huge stone in front of him.\\n\u3000\u3000The boulder weighs about two or three hundred pounds. Previously, Ling Xiao could only leave some marks on it. It is almost impossible to break it.However, this time, as the violent bull ran against the boulder, the stone shattered and made a roar.\"Wumai Duplex! Finally broke!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had just trained the barbarian power to the perfect level, and there were people from the Devil Clan in the village. If there was no connection, he absolutely did not believe it.\\n\u3000\u3000 But this kind of thing, it is useless to think about it, now let's consider how to face the annual comparison of the Ling family.This competition is the only chance for outside disciples to get ahead!things that you can't normally get are possible through such a big comparison.Of course you have to get a ranking.The strength is improving fast, and this person's ambition is also big.In the past, Ling Xiao never dared to deliberately become a warrior with three or more martial arts lines, because it felt that it was too far away and too unrealistic.Wumai Jiuzhong, one to three is the stage of awakening, and it is also the existence of the lowest-ranking martial artist who has been secularly \"wusheng\".The best martial arts can have a thousand pounds of strength, can tear tiger leopards, punch wolf bears, is already a bull in the eyes of the world.But after the fourfold of Wumai, there will be completely different changes.The four to six layers of martial arts belong to the Gangqi stage, and will get the official title of \"Wu Tu\". The biggest feature of this stage is that the true Qi will be transformed into Gangqi, which can hurt people from the air.has gang qi and can do more and more things, which is also the goal pursued by countless warriors.Many people can't achieve it in their lifetime.\\n\u3000\u3000However, Ling Xiao now feels strongly that he may have a chance to become a samurai!This dream is no longer illusory, but becomes very real and can be reached by reaching out.\u2026\u2026While eating, Ling Xiao excitedly told his grandfather the news that he broke through to Wumai.The old man was shocked and watched Ling Xiao's drill, and finally he finally believed in tears.\"Good boy, Grandpa can see your progress, even if he is dead.\"\"Grandpa, after I participated in the annual Darby, please ask the best doctor to heal you.\"Speaking enough, he knew that Grandpa had broken his ribs, but he didn't have the money to heal. It made the elderly feel so painful that they couldn't sleep at night.But the only thing Ling Xiao can do is to make desperate progress. The annual awards are very rich and can be chosen freely.Be patient, and it will be here soon.\"Grandpa is okay, don't force yourself too much. Although you have broken through the second line of martial arts, but there are too many warriors of this strength. If you fight too hard, you will be injured.\"The old man's mind is very simple, he does not want Ling Xiao to be injured for him.\\n\u3000\u3000Ke Xiao's mind is also simple. In order to heal his grandfather's injuries and to get ahead, this year's Dabi must definitely get a good ranking.There is still time. Next, go to the Bookstore and choose a higher-level martial arts method suitable for you.With better martial arts skills, I believe that progress will be faster.Book Collection Pavilion, as the name implies, is the place where books are collected. Apart from some of the family history books of the Ling family, most of them are martial arts classics.After eating, Ling Xiao couldn't wait to run to the Bookstore, although many people pointed at him along the way.But he didn't care.Strength has improved, better than anything.\"Little beggar!\"Suddenly came a crisp sound, but a man and a woman just came out of the door of the library.The girl's lively and lovely, looks spicy.The man's heroic spirit is good-looking, good-looking and strong.is called Xiaoxiao Beggar, that is the woman, that is, the charming young lady who often bullied him and grandpa.\\n\u3000\u3000 Later, because he became a disciple of the Ling family, the woman was very attentive to him, but when he could not break through the Wumai double for a long time.The woman turned to him with wicked words and threw herself into the arms of the boy next to him.Ling Xiao didn't really like this girl at all.How about being cute? If the heart is poisoned by a viper, it is Jin Yu's failure!\"You are that little beggar in the mouth of Sister Rain? It actually broke into the double of Wumai, not bad, but among the outside disciples, you are considered to be worse, and you must continue to work hard.\"Don't wait for Ling Xiao to respond to Ling Yu, and the teenager looked down at Ling Xiao with his eyes looking down, as if he was a senior.\"Ling Feng, a child of the Ling clan's native clan, a triple peak of Wumai, and an elite disciple of the Ling clan!\"Ling Xiao looked at Ling Feng. In the past, in front of this person, all he felt was inferiority and helplessness.But now, he doesn't care anymore, the martial arts are only threefold, and he will soon break through.\"Ling Yu, you chose a good man, but Ling Feng, this woman was able to abandon me like grass, and sooner or later, it will be the same to you.\"Ling Xiao said lightly.is also a 13-year-old child, he does not think Ling Feng is superior.\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Well, I don't think there is anything wrong with Sister Rain. Women like strong men, since ancient times.\"Ling Feng snorted coldly.Ling Xiao chuckled lightly: \"Are you so sure that you will never be overtaken or surpassed by me?\"\"Have!\"said Ling Feng proudly.\"Well, since that's the case, I won't say much. The two of you are light, and I have to go to the Bookstore.\"\"Wait a minute!\"Ling Yu looked at Ling Xiao with a smile and said: \"Little beggar, man's destiny is doomed, you were born to be a beggar, UU reading www.uukanshu.com can only be a beggar for a lifetime.\"\"But I am now a disciple of the Ling family!\"\"It's useless. Sooner or later, you can only be a beggar. If you don't get the ranking this year, then you won't be able to enter the elite hall. If you can't enter the elite hall, you have to become a martial art triple before the age of 14. Can you do it? You can only go back to beggars if you can\u2019t.\"Ling Yu said proudly.\"Of course, there is another way to obediently become a servant of the Ling family. For example, mixing with my wind brother, he can protect you from the bully of Ling Chong.\"\\n\u3000\u3000 Ling Xiao's face showed a disdainful sneer, even when there was no Shan Wu Wu Hun.He never wanted to be a minion in the past.What's more, now that he is not what he used to be, what is Ling Chong, Ling Feng, who will be stepped on by his feet sooner or later, let him be a minion?Funny!\"No one tells you that Ling Chong has been beaten to bed by me?\"Ling Xiao said lightly.\"Well, you are a waste, Ling Chong is also a waste! There is nothing to say about the duel between waste.\"Suddenly, Ling Feng's words rang again.\"Waste? The last person who said I was waste has two ribs broken, I don't know how you will be?\"Ling Xiao looked at Ling Feng without any concession.\"Hahahaha, okay! If you have the courage to waste, don't worry, I won't do it for you today. Anyway, the annual ratio will be less than half a month. I will let you realize that waste is waste , Forever!

His goal is to enter Genius Hall from Elite Hall!Instead of competing against a non-influential disciple who can't even enter the elite hall.\"Hee hee, maybe it's time for Brother Ling Feng's turn. I will ask him to beg for mercy.\"Lin Yu grinned, and then the pair of handsome men and beautiful women left in the eyes of everyone's envy and jealousy to come to the bookstore.\u2026\u2026Ling Xiao has entered the library, but he is a little nervous.\\n\u3000\u3000 This is the first time after all.On the first floor of the Book Collection Pavilion, there is only one room and no books.This is the place where the library guards live.The guards are generally the top masters of the family, or the elders, or the sons of the head of the family, etc.is on duty today, is a middle-aged man about 35 years old.\"Ling Xiao? Ha ha, you are very good, no wonder it can break my son, it turned out to be a breakthrough.\"That\u2019s right, the person on duty today is Ling Chong\u2019s father, the nine sons of Ling\u2019s old head, known as Jiu Ye.\"Nine Lord, the disciple came today to observe martial arts!\"Ling Xiao knows that Jiuye is very strong and terribly powerful, absolutely above the fourfold of Wumai!Because the Jiuye displayed by Wuhe Soul of the Mountain and River, although there is no detailed data, it shows a red warning.\\n\u3000\u3000 shows that the difference in strength is too great, and there is no possibility of winning.However, he is still neither humble nor overbearing, because he knows that as long as he is a child of the Ling family, Jiuye would not dare to kill him easily.But if he was really kicked out, it would definitely die miserably.So he has to work hard, stay hard, this is the way to save life.\"Good boy, I'm brave.\"Jiuye sneered: \"I am not afraid to say straight, you will hurt my son, I will not give up. Now you are still a child of the Ling family, I am not good at shooting, but you better not be kicked out, otherwise No doubt will die.\"This is an absolutely unabashed threat.\"The disciples knew.\" Ling Xiao nodded and replied, he naturally understood the truth.\"Just know, you are a foreign disciple who comes in through the assessment, and the treatment is naturally not as good as the children of this family. In some words, I will tell you in advance, lest you mess up the rules.\"Nine Lord found that he did not scare this Ling Xiao, could not help showing a playful smile, and then said.\\n\u3000\u3000 Ling Xiao heard this, and felt a little angry in his heart. There was no such rule in the family. This Jiuye was clearly a communist private enmity!But he couldn\u2019t help it, he didn\u2019t have enough strength, he could only endure it, bargaining was meaningless, and it was just a joke.\"Nine Lord please say.\" He said lightly.Jiuye laughed and said: \"As a foreign disciple, you can only enter the second floor, choose up to two martial arts, intermediate and lower levels are not limited, whether you can choose intermediate martial arts, depending on your eyesight and creativity, choose One hour at a time, after the selection, you can hold twenty days, can you hear clearly?\"Ling Xiao listened, his heart was very angry.He had inquired long before he came. As long as the children of the Ling family, no matter they are from abroad or home, they can choose at least four martial arts at a time. The selection time can be three hours, and the time taken to practice can reach four months. !This gap is too big.But despite his annoyance, he was helpless. He only gritted his teeth and nodded, \"The disciple understands.\"Of course he understands that the injustices he suffers today must be returned ten times and one hundred times!\"Just understand, go quickly.\"\\n\u3000\u3000 There was a disdainful look on the corner of Jiuye\u2019s mouth, and the dogs all depended on the owner. They dared to hurt my son. Although they couldn\u2019t kill you because of family rules, but forced you to get out of the Ling family, you could cook as you please.Ling Xiao took a deep breath, restrained the evil pressure in her heart, and lifted her feet up the stairs to the second floor.The Book Collection is the martial arts classic collection place of the Ling family, and it is the important place of the Ling family!This represents the accumulation and glory of a large family!There is no such place for ordinary small families. This is the gap. The larger the family, the deeper the family, the more martial arts classics and the higher the quality.The Ling Family's Book Collection Pavilion is divided into four floors.The first floor is the place where the guard lives.The second level is where basic martial arts, low-level martial arts, and intermediate martial arts are stored. Of course, low-level martial arts account for the vast majority, and there are also many basic martial arts. Intermediate martial arts are said to have only a few twenty types. The odds are very low.The third floor has a large number of intermediate martial arts, a certain number of advanced martial arts, and a small number of top martial arts.To enter the third floor of the library, at least it must be a martial arts warrior, to be eligible.\\n\u3000\u3000 The fourth floor is said to be mostly top martial arts, UU reading www.uukanshu.com and some confidential documents of the Ling family, as well as a handful of martial arts books that are said to have seceded from the world.Of course, these are all rumors between the disciples. Whether it is true or not is hard to say.Naturally, the rules are set by people. If you are a child of your own family, you have backstage or backing, or you have extraordinary talents, then many rules can actually be courageous to you.This is why Ling Chong can learn advanced martial arts, while Ling Xiao can only learn basic martial arts.For Ling Xiao, this opportunity is really rare. He must choose well and try to choose intermediate martial arts.When entering the second floor, Ling Xiao found that someone was already inside.But everyone didn\u2019t even look up at him. Although these people have three hours to choose from, it is not an easy task to select an intermediate martial art from thousands of martial arts.No one wants to waste time.Ling Xiao is naturally unwilling, because he is more precious than these people's time, only one hour.So he just froze for a moment, then put his eyes on the bookshelf.\\n\u3000\u3000 As one of the four major families in Tianfeng City, the Ling family has a deep foundation. These thousands of martial arts really need to be turned over one by one. It is unlikely that it will be impossible without three or four hours.Ling Jiu's guy clearly wanted to embarrass me!\"\"Kaibei Palm\", \"Fighting Fire Fist\", \"Thirteen Swords of Tianfeng\", \"Breeze by Leaf Step\", \"Chiyanggong\"...\"From the first book in the first row, Ling Xiao looked dazzled, and it was really difficult to distinguish the level of these martial arts classics based on just a few pages.too difficult!Do you have any tips?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 Martial artsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLing Xiao opened the outline of several books to check, hoping to find some clues.\"Opening the Stele Palm\": The palm method is fierce, if the mountain comes, you can win with strength, and the strength can reach 300 pounds before you can practice.\"Fighting Fire\": It can condense true energy, and burst into a powerful boxing force like a fire. It is very terrible to burst instantly. If you reach the stage of ganglion, you can even hit the fire gangh.\"Blast Wind Step by Step\": After training, you can greatly improve your body speed. The so-called martial arts in the world can only be broken quickly, which shows its strength. Generally speaking, thin people are more suitable for cultivation, especially for slim women.\"Iron Clothes Gong\": Defensive horizontal training, after training, it can block the sword attack, which can greatly reduce the damage to the body. This kind of humility and firmness can only be achieved after training, otherwise it will be easy to give up halfway.\u2026\u2026\"It sounds so powerful, every one wants to be used to practice, but unfortunately can only choose two, headache...\"Although it is said that these martial arts levels were not found in these introductions, Ling Xiao was very excited to see the introductions.\\n\u3000\u3000 As a person who is difficult to get even low-level martial arts, almost all of these martial arts books make him coveted.Damn Ling Jiu, everyone can take out four books, but I can only take two.Although it is not good to be greedy, not every martial art has to learn the Great Consummation.For example, in \"Iron Mangong\", it is enough for the average person to practice enough to improve his body defense.One or two books are the core, and the rest are auxiliary, so as to greatly improve the strength.It's a pity that I can only choose two books. If I can choose more, I now have a mountain and river martial arts spirit, and I can improve very quickly. Even if I practice several martial arts at the same time, it should not be a problem.Ok?Suddenly, Ling Xiao thought of something.Mountain and river martial arts can analyze and practice martial arts, is it possible to practice martial arts in martial arts cheats?When he first entered the library, he was afraid that Ling Jiu could see the problem, so he didn't open the mountain and river Wuhun.\\n\u3000\u3000 This method of opening and closing is very simple, and it can be done only by urging true energy, which is basically similar to the use of martial arts.Thinking of this, he hurriedly opened Shan Wu Wu Hun.At this moment, the clouds on the mountain and river map actually opened three times, and another building appeared in the village.The structure of the building is very similar to that of the Ling's family's library, except that it is a little low and has only one floor.The most wonderful thing is that when Ling Xiao dived into her consciousness, she discovered that all the martial arts secrets she had seen before actually appeared in the mountain and river library.When he opened a book to view, a figure on the mountain and river map would be immediately displayed. It was his figure, and he practiced the martial arts he had read.\"This... this is amazing too!\"Ling Xiao was shocked, but it was accompanied by intense ecstasy.I don\u2019t think that Shan Wu Wu Hun actually has such an effect. Wouldn\u2019t it mean that as long as you have all the martial arts cheats from this second layer, you can take it into your pocket?Even if you don't practice, you can use it for others to practice in the future, and you can even use it to sell money.\\n\u3000\u3000Doesn't think this is a betrayal of the Ling family, anyway, the Ling family has never regarded him as his own.Even if Ling Jiu publicly threatened to kill him, why should he keep the Ling family's secret?Furthermore, the best of these two floors is the intermediate martial arts. It is estimated that they can also be found outside. Only the secret book on the fourth floor of the Bookstore is the root of the Ling family.Thinking of this, he no longer hesitated, accelerated the speed and began to read those martial arts cheats. Every book was just a summary, and then he threw it on the shelf.It is not easy to read the outline of nearly ten thousand books in one hour, he must speed up.Isn\u2019t Ling Jiu restricting me to take only two books? I\u2019ll steal all the cheats here, and I\u2019m going to kill you!Boost!No matter how fast!Ling Xiao's face showed a crazy color never seen before.At the beginning, every time he read a book, he also had to confirm whether there was a copy in the library house in the mountain and river map, but when he arrived later, he was too lazy to verify it.\\n\u3000\u3000Because there is no need to verify, there is no new book in the library, he feels it in his heart.\"Hahaha... It's cool! It's so cool! Shan Wu Wu Hun, what kind of Wu Hun is this, actually so powerful!\"Ling Xiao couldn't help the joy in his heart when looking at the martial arts cheats, he laughed.This behavior caused those disciples who were reading books to focus on him.\"Is this kid sick?\"\"Yeah, I have never seen such a book selection!\"\"It's just dumplings, let's not care about him, let's hurry up and do our own thing.\"An hour, say long is not long, short is not short.When Ling Xiao \u201ccopied\u201d almost all the cheats on the second floor of the bookstore, more than 9,000 copies, there was only a quarter of an hour left.The reason why he hasn't left yet is mainly because there are still several books in the hands of Ling's children who haven't put them down. He hasn't had time to read them.\\n\u3000\u3000It is worth mentioning that the martial arts books placed indiscriminately in the Ling family clan's collection pavilion have changed in the mountains and rivers.They were neatly arranged in different categories, and there was a person out of thin air who was responsible for cleaning.Palm method, sword method, sword method, inner power mind method, body method, strong body exercises, etc.is all placed in different bookshelves.Not only that, intermediate martial arts, low martial arts, and basic martial arts were also arranged in order from high to low, and they were labeled on the top, and at a glance, they knew that level of martial arts.In this case, Ling Xiao was stunned to read, UU reading www.uukanshu. com and excited.This library in my own mountain and river is even more powerful than the Ling family's library!Time is running out, but Ling Xiao can\u2019t go to the Ling family\u2019s disciples to grab a book. After all, his current strength can\u2019t be compared with those people.So I can only continue to wander on the second floor, hoping to find the cheats you may miss.was just too excited, it is really possible to look away.\\n Ok? what is that?Ling Xiao suddenly noticed that there were two paintings hanging at the entrance of the second floor.One painting shows a bull-headed monster holding a giant axe, while the other painting shows a guy with a monkey head and a monkey brain, holding a stick.The most wonderful thing is that there are three words \"Bull Demon Skill\" on the painting of the bull head, and there are three words written on the picture of the monkey head and monkey brain, which is \"Xiang Yunbu\".Are these two paintings also cheats for martial arts?Ling Xiao thought so, and reached out to one of the paintings.\"Stop it!\"But he hadn't touched the painting yet, but was stopped by someone. He was a disciple of the Ling family.Wumai triple training is stronger than Ling Xiao.\"You go to inform Jiuye, you said that someone touched the town painting without permission!\"\\n\u3000\u3000 The disciple said to another disciple.The disciple ran down quickly. When he came up, Ling Jiu also came.\"Nine Lord, this child is good at moving town painting!\"\"Don't care, don't care, the town painting is indeed a two-story martial arts classic, let him touch it. These two town paintings look ordinary, but in fact they are all prohibited.\"Ling Jiu said with a smile: \"Ling Xiao, if you have the ability, take away the martial arts books behind them.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 2 amazing worksPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLing Jiu looked at Ling Xiao with some contempt.The reason why he agreed with Ling Xiao to touch the two town paintings is naturally for a reason.These two town paintings were left by the Ling family ancestors, saying that they suppressed two wonderful works.These two martial arts are very difficult for any martial artist to practice, but once the practice is successful, they will benefit for life.However, if you want to get these two amazing works, you must first break the ban on the town painting.Why did the Ling family ancestors do this? There was no specific reason, but only that they had to wait for someone to get along.However, for hundreds of years, countless people have tried to take out two amazing works from the town painting, and they have failed.even includes the Ling family heads who are now powerful.\\n\u3000\u3000 Of course, Ling Jiu also tried it, and he really wanted to give these two amazing skills to his son Ling Chong to learn.Unfortunately, he also failed.Because of this, he did not believe that Ling Xiao could succeed.However, the next moment, Ling Jiu's eyes and beads were almost staring out.Ling Xiao has almost no effort, so he easily took two exercises from the two paintings.One \"Cow Magic\" and one \"Xiang Yunbu\".\"Bring it!\"Ling Jiu quickly showed greed after being shocked.\"Nine Lord, you just said, if I take out these two books, can I take them away?\"Ling Xiao frowned, but quickly glanced at the outline of the two books and copied the book into the mountain and river map.\\n\u3000\u3000Because he knew that his arms could not be screwed on his thighs, this book would eventually be snatched by Ling Jiu, so he must not suffer any losses.\"Have you heard it?\"Suddenly, Ling Jiu waved his hand, and a strong force directly flew Ling Xiao out, and the two exercises also fell into Ling Jiu's hands.\"Hahahaha, it's really no effort to break through iron shoes and find nowhere!\"Lin Jiu laughed wildly, and then raised his hand and took two exercises from the bookshelf and threw it to Ling Xiao.\"Boy, don't be dissatisfied, these two amazing exercises are not something you can get. The two exercises I chose for you are intermediate exercises. Take them back and practice them well. You won't lose.\"\"Ha ha ha ha!\"Lin Jiu laughed and could not wait to open the two amazing works to see.Ling Xiao was spitting blood, but she felt a little lucky in her heart.Because both wonderful works have been copied.\\n\u3000\u3000 Today's revenge, he will not forget.Ling Jiu, you remember, one day, my Ling Xiao will make you humiliated so much!Ling Xiao didn't say anything, and left with Ling Jiu's two exercises still on the ground. It was also a coincidence that the two exercises just happened to be copied by him before.Don't do nothing.\"Hahaha, just because the beggar is also good at practicing the Ling family's marvelous skills? What a joke!\"Ling Jiu saw Ling Xiao obediently leaving, and his heart was so happy that he looked at the summary of the two amazing works, which was indeed surprising.It\u2019s a pity that these two amazing works have a condition that they can only practice in the awakening stage of the martial arts, that is, beyond the threefold of the martial arts, you can\u2019t practice unless you self-abandon cultivation.But who is so stupid?He can only take back this amazing work to his son Ling Chong to practice.Ling Xiao left the Book Store with some embarrassment and was pointed and ridiculed all the way.\\n\u3000\u3000Because of what happened in the library, the children of the Ling family have been added fuel and vinegar, and the plot has been changed and spread out.became his Ling Xiao's attempt to steal the bookstore martial arts, but was caught by Ling Jiuhui's eyes and learned a lesson.Ling Xiao is not aware of this, but he also understands that the current explanation is useless. The only chance to prove his innocence is that his power is above Ling Jiu.He also believes that Ling Jiu will not make things worse, otherwise someone will always know the truth and his face will not be glorious.After all, the Ling family is not a monolithic one. This Ling Jiu still has to take care of some things.Back home, Ling Xiao entered his room, and then took out the \"Xiang Yunbu\" to see.\"Xiang Yunbu\": a growthable body method, currently at the stage of \"Xiang Yunbu\", every time you grow up, the name of the exercise method will change, and the required conditions will also change, but the goals you pursue are the same!After practicing, you can make the martial arts as light as a bird, step on the cloud to chase the moon, and control the cloud... If you can be promoted to the highest stage, you can even take the cloud and drive the fog, laughing for nine days!This body method can only be cultivated from the awakening stage, otherwise the foundation is unstable and unable to succeed.Even in the \"Xiangyunbu\" stage, if you can practice to the great consummation, you can also briefly fly through the sky and fight in the cloud within a certain time!\\n\u3000\u3000 This stage is almost invincible in the qi environment, which is below the sixfold of Wumai.Seeing here, Ling Xiao's body pain is gone, replaced by excitement!Invincible under the gang stage!Doesn't this mean that you have no need to change your body to practice the sixfold of Wumai, and this is only the stage of \"Xiangyunbu\".This exercise can grow.Transiting the sky for a short time, and even fighting in the clouds within a certain period of time. Even if Ling Xiao is ignorant, he is also a disciple of the Ling family. He has never heard of it.Anyway, he can be sure that there is absolutely nothing in the intermediate body method, and the advanced body method is not known, but it is estimated that there are few. After all, Ling Jiagao has the advanced body method in hand, and he has not seen the cloud to fight.is really awesome!But with such a good body, why did the ancestors of the Ling family suppress it with paintings instead of letting the children of the Ling family practice?Holding this puzzle, Ling Xiao continued to read it, and sure enough, when he turned to the last page, he saw a line of handwritten words. UU reading books www.uukanshu.com\\n\"This martial art can only be achieved by awakening the Martial Soul. If the ordinary martial arts practitioners have achieved certain results, but at most they are only intermediate body skills, mediocre, and the practice is too difficult, which affects entry. So imprison it!\"It seems that this ancestor of the Ling family should also know Wuhun, and may even have seen someone who awakened Wuhun!Could it be that Wu Hun has not disappeared? It's just that there are too few people awakening Wuhun now, so basically it's almost like extinction?Hahaha!Hahahaha!Ling Xiao couldn't help but laughed in his house.Ling Jiu, Ling Jiu, you don\u2019t care about your face, shamelessly robbed me of two wonderful works from my hands, but in the end it was just empty.Okay, let me teach your son with this amazing lesson in the annual comparison!In addition, this \"Xiang Yunbu\" has a cultivation method which is a little bit painful.It requires an intermediate body technique to reach the state of great consummation, and then \"Xiangyunbu\" can be started one step at a time.\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Xiang Yunbu\" has a total of nine steps, and it is finally completed.That is to say, there is no cultivation method for this thing, he just accumulated experience through other body methods and then improved.Seeing this, he hurried to check \"Niu Mogong\" and found an interesting thing.The \"Xiang Yunbu\" pursues elegance and speed.The \"Niu Mogong\" pursues strength and domineering, and the use of martial arts.Not only that, \"Niu Mogong\" is also a growth martial art, but it is different from \"Xiang Yunbu\" that grows by accumulating experience. \"Niu Mogong\" grows by swallowing.is not to devour the true qi, nor the people, but the practice experience.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You can no longer practice again, and you can\u2019t succeed anymore.However, the characteristics of the exercises will be absorbed by \"Bull Magic\".Fortunately, this engulfment is not passive, but active, that is to say, it can be chosen, otherwise Ling Xiao really dare not practice.Both miracles are growth miracles, and at the highest level, they are both terrifying.So it must be cultivated, but this method is a little weird, Ling Xiao can only practice other martial arts first.Fortunately, he owns mountains, rivers, and martial arts. He can copy the martial arts. From the Ling's bookstore, he can steal those martial arts.Now you can pick a few things and start practicing.Seeing the cheats in the Shanhetu Bookstore, Ling Xiao started rolling excitedly directly on the bed.\\nThe Tianfeng City where they are located belongs to the Northern Han Dynasty. According to the market price, a basic martial art can sell twelve silver, a junior martial art can sell for two thousand silver, an intermediate martial art, It is as high as one hundred thousand two silver.Why can't the poor like Ling Xiao afford basic martial arts?Because he can't save twelve silver in his life.Never do anything, endlessly, Ling Xiao is ready to take out some basic martial arts to sell, at least to see the grandpa's ribs.Since the Ling family is not benevolent, don't blame him for being unrighteous.He did not live in vain in the Ling family this year. He usually practiced martial arts and worked hard, but he didn't get any money. He could only get some food.is still not full.Such a Ling family, he really does not have the slightest respect.So selling secrets of martial arts in private is no big deal.Of course, for the sake of safety, he still intends to start with basic martial arts. After all, there are too many basic martial arts, not only the Ling family, so it is difficult to be discovered.\\n\u3000\u3000 Thinking of this, he hurried out the door and went to the auction house in Tianfeng City.Generally speaking, basic martial arts only need to be posted to the auction house, if sold, the auction house will directly transfer the money to your silver account.Don't have to wait there every day.After Ling Xiao put ten basic martial arts to the auction house, he returned to the Ling family, and it was important to treat Grandpa's wounds.But improving strength is equally important.If the strength is not enough, grandpa's injury will definitely happen again.After returning to the room, Ling Xiao began to choose from more than nine thousand martial arts.Although greedy and chewy, martial arts are a bit special. Many martial arts can complement each other. Not only will they not restrict each other, but they will also accelerate the progress of cultivation.So he must choose a few more to match up and practice.What's more, if you want to upgrade \"Xiang Yunbu\", to feed \"Bull Magic\", you must constantly practice more martial arts.\\n\u3000\u3000With the suggestion of mountain and river charts, this selection time becomes much shorter. If you let him choose, it may be impossible to choose one day and night.However, under the suggestion of Shanhetu, he selected five martial arts in less than a quarter of an hour.This is a set of martial arts. Shanhetu even compiled a name for this set of martial arts called \"Fist of Soul.\"Practice these five martial arts at the same time, which can increase the speed of cultivation by 10% to 30% and the speed of accumulating true energy by 10% to 30%.When using boxing techniques, the power can be increased by one to two times!The five martial arts of \"The Soul of Boxing\" are \"Tiger's Step Down the Mountain\", \"Meteor Fist\", \"Violent Qi\", \"Chiyang Gong\", and \"Return Qi Qi\".In fact, after careful analysis, you will know that these five martial arts are all based on \"Meteor Fist\", and the remaining four martial arts are all auxiliary.Intermediate stature \"Tiger Steps Down the Mountain\", this is a set of stiff stances. After being cast, every time you strike forward, the strength will increase, the momentum will increase, and the speed will also increase, just like a tiger going down the mountain!Of course, this intermediate body technique will still serve \"Xiang Yunbu\" in the future.Intermediate internal strength mental method \"Red Sun Gong\", this is a kind of power to increase true energy. The key is that when you use martial arts, you can increase the effect of fire burns, and you can also increase the power of boxing.\\n\u3000\u3000 Intermediate secret skills \"Return Qi\", \"Vicious Qi\", one is the secret to restore Qi, a secret moment burst of Qi.The latter can maximize the power of \"Meteor Fist\" in an instant, but the disadvantage is that it consumes too much energy.And the former \"Return Qi Jue\" can make up for this defect to a great extent.This is why Ling Xiao chose these five martial arts.As for how to choose \"Meteor Fist\" in the boxing method, the reason is very simple. This set of boxing methods is the most powerful in the intermediate martial arts, and what Ling Xiao likes is the battle of wide open.'S power is even inferior to some advanced martial arts. Of course, its shortcomings are the same as \"Breaking Power\", it is too expensive, so the general awakening warrior does not like to choose it.But Ling Xiao is different.Not only because of the relationship between mountains, rivers and martial spirits, his true energy is thicker than warriors of the same strength, but he also deliberately chose \"Return Qi\" to make up for the defects.Other warriors, even geniuses, have already practiced the three martial arts at the same time. It is already very against the sky, but he can also demonstrate the effect based on the analysis of the mountain and river martial soul.is fully capable of practicing five martial arts simultaneously.\\n\u3000\u3000 And they are the five martial arts that complement each other.This is the advantage!From now on, he Ling Xiao is no longer the little beggar that the man can bully, his martial arts road will be smooth.After choosing the suit of \"Fist of Soul\" martial arts, Ling Xiao began to practice.Of course, it is said to practice at the same time, but after all, he is just a person, so he still has to come in order, but every martial arts practice speed is faster than others.He first chose to practice \"Red Sun Gong\".The reason is very simple, \"Chi Yang Gong\" can increase the true energy and can strengthen the body.Whether it is for body skills or martial arts, UU reading www.uukanshu.com is essential. After all, the fundamental point of the martial arts is true energy.Even the division of the realm of martial arts is actually carried out according to the different stages of Qi.Ling Xiao closed her eyes and then practiced according to the content of \"Red Sun Gong\".\\n\u3000\u3000True Qi runs in the body. What excites him is that once he encounters a blockage and encounters troubles, the mountain and river Wuhun will automatically run, and then help solve this problem, and give the correct True Qi operation line.In this way, Ling Xiao is basically impossible to get out of the way, and there are no so-called shackles in the cultivation practice.For others, it is difficult to break through the difficult practice levels, and it will take several months or even years to succeed, but he does not have these so-called levels at all.There are green lights all the way, all are unimpeded.He was originally talented, but he is not as talented as he is now.All of these are derived from the special effects of Wu Wu Shan Shan.This made Ling Xiao more interested and more interested in Shan Wu Wu Hun.Martial Soul is already very mysterious, and Mountain Martial Soul is obviously more mysterious than most Martial Souls. How amazing is it.Lingxiao urgently wants to know.Just know the secret, his strength is obviously not enough now.\\n\u3000\u3000 and cultivation is the key to unlocking the secrets of mountains and rivers.Because when he was practicing \"Chiyanggong\", he could obviously feel some wonderful changes in the mountain and river map.Of course, the continuous disappearance of clouds should be the most obvious.There was one more place in the small village of Shanhetu at this time.It was an altar, not a god, but a fire!A bright flame!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 Rapid entryPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaypracticed just one hour, Ling Xiao's \"Chiyang Gong\" actually broke through the first layer.He could feel that the true qi in his body was obviously thicker, and the whole body was drained of the waste liquid formed by the body transformation.Black, a little smelly.Although the strength has not increased, but the strength of the Qi and the veins have improved, at least by two or three points.actually broke through the first layer of \"Red Sun Gong\" in just one hour, the speed of this practice is really amazing!Ling Xiao was very excited. This inner power mentality has only three layers. After practicing to three layers of consummation, the air of flame can be contained in the attack.may even form flames.You must know that gang qi can only be mastered by martial arts with four or more martial arts. This is actually the biggest advantage of martial arts.\\nIt\u2019s just that because it\u2019s difficult to practice to the Great Consummation, so there are not many practitioners. After all, wasting this time on a set of exercises, it is better to work hard to improve the strength. When the Wumai is fourfold, the true qi is automatically transformed into gang qi .But Ling Xiao's idea is different. If he can condense the qi in the awakening stage, then the combat power will definitely improve a lot.practiced \"Chiyang Gong\" for another hour, and after fixing it on the first floor, Ling Xiao turned to practice other martial arts.According to the guidance of Shan Wu Wu Hun, these five types of martial arts are carried out in succession in order to achieve a multiplier effect.That is to say, you don't want to promote one kind, but to practice all five kinds of martial arts to the first level, and then improve it in a loop, which works best.Next, he chose \"Meteor Fist\".This is a martial art, a means of attack and must be learned.As described by Shanhe Wuhun, after learning \"Red Sun Gong\", the practice of \"Meteor Fist\" becomes very easy.This set of boxing techniques has a total of nine types. The moves are very simple. There are nine types of changes in total. It pursues power, not speed, nor change.Lingxiao likes this, because it is easier to practice.\\n\u3000\u3000In just two hours, Ling Xiao fully mastered \"Meteor Fist\" from the first type to the sixth type, but the latter three types are still a bit difficult.However, he did not persevere, but instead went to practice \"The Courage\".This is a secret method, all of which have only one stage, and the function is also very simple, that is, a large amount of true energy can be condensed on the martial arts in an instant.Of course, the number of outbreaks can be controlled, 60%, 70%, and even 10% can be completely desperate.Although I really want to try the power of \"Meteor Fist\" under \"The Qi Qi\", Ling Xiao still resisted. In order to continue the battle, he had to master the \"Return Qi Qi\".\"Returning Qi Juice\" is the same as \"Breaking Qi Juice\", it is also a secret method, as long as you master the know-how, it is easy to practice, and there is only one layer.Relying on the analysis of Shan Wu Wu Hun, he took only one hour to get it.\"Rejuvenation Technique\" has two effects. One is to continuously restore true energy anytime, anywhere. Of course, this speed will be relatively slow.Another option is to meditate on the spot, so that within a quarter of an hour, you can basically recover completely.Of course, it is limited to the awakening stage, that is, the martial arts below the triple martial arts.\\n\u3000\u3000 The higher the revision, the slower natural recovery will be. After all, the true gas reserves have become larger.The cultivation of the first layer of \"Tiger Steps Down the Mountain\" is also relatively simple. The main thing is to pay attention to the momentum. With the previous foundation, he simply chose to practice this body method in a stormy situation. It took only a quarter of an hour to break through level one.After \u3000\u3000, it took a quarter of an hour to return to the air, return to \"Red Sun Gong\", and practice again in a violent manner. The second layer was easily broken through directly.Ling Xiao now really wants to find someone to practice his hands. With the cooperation of the set of \"Fist of Soul Boxing\", he believes that even if he is a triple warrior on the martial arts, it is absolutely uncomfortable.does not dare to say that he will win steadily, but he will never lose unless the opponent also has special exercises.Unexpectedly, Ling Xiao also stepped up his cultivation. Except for going out during the meal, the rest of the time, he completely shut himself in the room.Two days later, Ling Xiao's \"Red Sun Gong\" was close to three major consummations. \"Meteor Fist\" realized the seventh style, and a total of nine hundred and eight kinds of changes in \"Tiger Steps Down the Mountain\" were basically mastered.The problem is that the room is too small to move away at all. If you want to try \"Tiger Steps Down the Mountain\", you have to go to a more spacious place.\"Meteor Fist\" is also the same, you have to go to actual combat, if you practice alone, it is still a bit difficult to fully understand the true meaning of martial arts.At this time his realm of martial arts has also been basically close to the double peak of martial arts, the distance breaks through, but it is only a few centimeters.\\n\u3000\u3000I need it, maybe it's really just a battle.But before that, he had to go to the auction house in the city, I wonder if those ten basic martial arts were sold.If you sell it, you should ask the grandfather to see the doctor, and continue to sell the remaining basic martial arts anonymously.\u2026\u2026Soon, Ling Xiao came to the auction house.The person at the auction house told him that all ten basic martial arts were sold, for a total of one hundred or two silvers, but there were ninety two silvers left after deducting labor costs.has all been transferred to the bank account.For this, Ling Xiao is already very satisfied.Next door is the silver number, Ling Xiao checked it, and it was true, it was ninety-two silver.So he left ten basic martial arts in the auction house.\\n\u3000\u3000 Auctioneers did not pay special attention, after all, it was just basic martial arts, they saw much more.took the silver and Ling Xiao went to hire a doctor who specially treated the bone injury.Who knew that when he first arrived at the side entrance of Ling's family, he saw a group of people there practicing practise light skills. UU reading www. uukanshu.comAlthough it can be practiced in the martial arts field, there are many trees outside, and there are many beams. The terrain is complex, and it is more suitable for light body exercises.\u564c!A figure jumped directly into the tree, just like the spirit ape flickering a few times, and then fell to the ground.\"The good body method, Brother Ling Fei's light body exercises, is the first in the elite hall, no one can reach it.\"\"Yeah, even if there are some shortcomings in other places, but the mere body method can make many peers very uncomfortable.\"\"Isn't it?

Brother Ling Fei wants to become the elite.\"Where is the group of people shouting non-stop.\\n\u3000\u3000 \"I don't know how my \"Tiger Goes Down the Mountain\", how does this compare to Ling Fei?\"This scene really makes Ling Xiao feel itchy. Ling Fei's light-weight exercises are indeed powerful. He must admit this, but he is not too convinced.\u564c\u564c\u564c!Perhaps encouraged by those people, Ling Fei deliberately changed several directions continuously in the air, and the movement was very elegant.It was just because of the lack of strength, and finally almost fell off. Fortunately, he saw Ling Xiao, so he tried to step on Ling Xiao's shoulder, so as not to lose face.Ling Xiao is invincible with Ling Fei, but he is not willing to let him step on his shoulders, so he just lifted his feet and kicked into the sky, giving Ling Fei a place to trample on.Ling Fei fell to the ground, but his face was a little angry.\"Brother Ling is so powerful, that's fine, it's like a flying swallow.\"They didn't realize that Ling Fei was too proud to be almost ugly, so they tried hard to boast.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some people here have practiced light skills for a year or two, and they can't compare with Ling Xiao.Naturally, I feel uncomfortable.\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Come on, doctor, my grandpa is still waiting to see a doctor.\"The doctor also looked a little dumbfounded, and was reminded by Ling Xiao before he recovered.\"This gentleman, your light skills are really eye-opening for the old man.\"The doctor is just an ordinary person, so at this time, Ling Xiao has been regarded as a certain son of the Ling family, otherwise there will be such good kung fu.\"Young man? You are a fool, this guy is just a little beggar, just luck, just have the ability to do it again!\"\"Yeah, definitely come back again!\"The disciples shouted loudly, apparently not convinced that a little beggar was riding on his head.Ling Xiao wanted to leave, but these people stopped him.To tell the truth, a person has no confidence in winning so many people.After all, including Ling Fei, there are several warriors with triple martial arts in UU reading www.uukanshu.com.Since these people still want to be ashamed, let's show them light power again.Anyway, \"The Tiger Steps Down the Mountain\" is just the foundation. What he really wants to practice is \"Xiang Yunbu\", even if it is exposed.\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Since you want to see it, let me show you again.\"To say nothing, Ling Xiao pointed to a fruit on the big tree and said: \"Just that fruit, I take it down, you don't need to be entangled.\"\"Braught you, the fruit is about 20 meters from the ground, Brother Ling Fei may not be able to do it!\"\"That is, if you can really take down the fruit, I will crawl around the tree twice and learn how to bark!\"Lin Fei also said indifferently: \"For the warrior triple warrior, the highest limit of light skill can fly is about fifteen meters, this Lingxiao cowhide blows up.\"He said it was common sense, and the disciples of the Ling family beside him also agreed, waiting to see Ling Xiao's jokes.\"is it?\"Ling Xiao chuckled, then Ling Fei En revenge, and now some people want to learn dog barking, just kill the prestige of these guys.Prevent them from bullying themselves in the future.He secretly luck, true qi condensed in the martial veins, and then flowed into the legs through the meridians.\"Courage!\"\"The tiger goes down the mountain!\"\\n\u3000\u3000 Ling Xiao is very clear, Ling Fei's words are correct, but if he uses a violent trick, his tiger will reach the range of more than 20 meters down the mountain, which is absolutely possible.Call!A gust of wind sounded, Ling Xiao stepped up into the air, and instantly jumped out a distance of nearly twenty meters high.Seeing that the fruit was about to be successfully harvested, a stone suddenly shot from the side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At this time, he was close to the fruit, so he picked the fruit first.But just because he hit flying stones, he now has no power to continue to vacate.Critical moment, Ling Xiao did not give up, with the remaining true energy, suddenly punched the ground.\\n\u3000\u3000Meteor Star Boxing Eighth-Skyfire Assault!This punch is very strong, and the reverse attack, the thrust generated just enough to make his feet reach the fruit.Whether it is a hand or a foot, if you pick the fruit, you will win.Fruit was kicked in his foot, and then fell down, he took it in his hand, and then the body fell down.When he saw a direct high-speed collision with the earth, his body was forced to pause for about a meter from the ground.The rejuvenation tactic worked, and finally there was no ugliness at the last moment, and the movement was not embarrassing.\"Who just said to learn to bark around the tree?\"Ling Xiao sneered and squeezed the fruit in his hand and asked.Those who had just clamored suddenly became dumb at this time, and refused to speak with their heads down one by one.Ling Xiao knew that this group of guys were courageous. He smiled disdainfully and did not continue to press, but waved to the doctor and walked towards the courtyard.In his opinion, things should be considered over here.\\n\u3000\u3000Anyway, he is not the opponent of so many people, just leave after finishing, it's really **** exciting!But he didn't expect that after just two steps, someone howled again.\"Stinky boy, you stop me! If you hit someone and want to run?\"Ling Xiao looked back, and it was Ling Fei who shouted.Lin Fei's complexion was blue, his eyes were breathing fire, and his anger was like a fighting cock.However, the momentum formed by his martial arts triple strength still brought huge pressure to the people around him.\"Beating? When did I hit someone?\"Ling Xiao asked suspiciously.Although Ling Fei is stronger than him, but the other party is too deceiving, he does not need to counsel. arrow\"I was stupid!\"Lin Fei coldly hummed: \"Don't you break his forehead? The blood has flowed like this, you haven't even admitted it?\"\\n\u3000\u3000 As soon as I said this, there were a few people who were not so embarrassed, but most people were as shameless as Ling Fei.\"That is, a foreigner who dared to beat our disciples of the Ling family, really ate the bear heart leopard!\"\"Brother Ling, teach him lessons!\"\"Beat this little beggar! Why should he practice martial arts with our Ling family children!\"\"Yes, he is not qualified!\"is really exciting.Ling Xiao knew long ago that these gang disciples of the Ling family couldn't look down on these foreigners, but they did not expect these people to be so shameless.He smiled angrily: \"When I was just picking fruit, someone secretly calculated me with a stone, and I was shot away by the stone. If he was injured, it should be deserved!\"People live a face, trees live a skin.When he didn\u2019t awaken Shan Wu Wu Hun, he wasn\u2019t afraid of anyone.

All the people who were staring at Ling Xiao who were preparing for a group fight suddenly looked in the same direction.It was a girl in white!Like a fairy in the snow.She has a bright eyebrow and a bright skin, although she just walks so far, but she is fascinated by everyone.\"How can there be such a perfect woman in the world, this is simply the goddess created by heaven and earth!\"\\n\u3000\u3000 A teenager almost finished this sentence on his knees, and there was no Ling Xiao in his eyes. At this time, he was completely occupied by the woman in white.\"Ling Yixue, a 16-year-old female disciple ranked third in the elite hall, is said to have already practiced the three peaks of Wumai, and is only one line away from the fourfold of Wumai!\"Ling Xiao also looked at Ling Yixue. After all, this woman is also the perfect woman in his mind.It's just that his performance is much better than others.His appreciation of Ling Yixue is not only because of beauty, but also because of Ling Yixue's strength!Ling Yixue, like him, was an outside disciple who entered the Ling family through the exam, but the situation was very different.The girl reached the triple peak of martial arts within a year, defeated elite hall disciples again and again, and was successfully promoted to elite hall third.All of her resources are obtained by her own efforts, rather than relying on her own advantages like the tenth Lingfeng of the elite hall.Genius probably refers to this kind of person.The goal of Ling Xiao was Ling Yixue.Because he thinks that his qualification is absolutely no less than Ling Yixue. UU reading www.uukanshu.com\\n\u3000\u3000Actually, this fact also proves this. If it were not for practicing the remnant skills, his entry might be faster, and it is estimated that it would not be worse than Ling Yixue.It's just that Sai Weng lost his horse and knew nothing but lost many things, but he got the Wuwu soul of mountains and rivers, which is a kind of luck.Before this, he really couldn't dare to look at Ling Yixue, because of inferiority, when he entered the Ling family, both of them were very optimistic, but now the situation is different between winter and summer.However, today, he doesn't care much.Ling Yixue is a genius, but he will soon catch up.When Ling Yixue approached, the children of the Ling family headed by Ling Fei stepped forward to say hello, it was called an attentive, it was called a passion.Seeing this scene, Ling Xiaoyue found out that this world is really a world respected by the strong.If his strength is strong enough, Ling Fei will not dare to trouble him, but will respect him very much.By that time, no one would dare to call a little beggar in front of him. At most it's just whispers in the back.Through the crowd, he admired the beauty of Ling Yixue.And the mountain and river martial arts also started to run, and the situation of Ling Yixue was thoroughly analyzed by the mountain and river martial spirits.\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Sure enough, the true qi has begun to change, and part of the true qi has condensed into gang qi. When these quantitative changes are qualitatively changed, it is time for Ling Yixue to break into the gang qi stage and enter the fourfold of Wumai.\"Ling Xiao felt a little stressed.But there is pressure to be motivated, you have to work harder.\"I just saw you around him, why?\"To Ling Xiao's surprise, Ling Yixue still remembered him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For them, it's already a good show.\"Is that right?\"Ling Yixue looked at Ling Xiao indifferently and asked.Ling Xiao wanted to explain, but he refrained from speaking to his mouth.Resolve your own affairs, what is going on with a woman, and in case you say it and people don\u2019t believe it, wouldn\u2019t it be embarrassing?thought of this, he did not speak.\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Seeing that there is no sister, he has already defaulted.\"Ling Fei said aloud.\"Ling Fei, are you still a man, what happened just now, you know better than me, why, now you want to pull Sister Ling Yixue?\"Ling Xiao suddenly sneered.\"Stinky boy, can you say that again?\"The so-called slender lady, gentleman is good.Ling Yixue is at Ling's house, that is the object of many people's crush, including Ling Fei, of course.So he didn't want to lose face in front of Ling Yixue anyway.\"I'm talking about facts, why don't you dare?\"Ling Xiao said lightly.\"Okay! Yixue World is here today, I will not fight with you, but you can get his medical expenses, and also apologize to him in front of everyone.\"\\n\u3000\u3000Lin Fei really wanted to beat Ling Xiao, but Ling Yixue was present, he was not easy to shoot, so as not to be bullied.So he played a heroic role as a justice.\"Apologize? Oh, want me to apologize to a shameless shameless calculator? Ling Fei, you are not confused?\"Ling Xiao said, even Ling Yixue could not help frowning.She just thought Ling Xiao was a little too self-confident.People who have just been promoted to Wumai Duplex, dare to call Ling Fei of Banwu Mai Triple, is this not pure death?In Ling Yixue's view, the strength is called the guts, and the strength is called the unknown.\"Sister, you have heard that this man hurt his own child, but he refused to apologize. As a brother, I had to take a lesson and teach him.\"Lin Fei looked at Ling Yixue, he was looking for a reason to shoot.\"My own children, beating and killing will always hurt the peace, just before I hear you say, Ling Xiao seems to be good at light power, it is worse than you to light power, if you win, I will let him apologize.\"Ling Yixue said lightly.\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Sister Sister's words, I hear, how about Ling Xiao, do you dare to compare with me?\"Although Ling Fei saw Ling Xiao's light merits, he was not afraid. At first, he was more confident and felt that he was still better than Ling Xiao. Second, Ling Xiao had obviously already consumed almost his Qi. Take advantage.\"Don't you dare!\"Ling Xiao sneered in your heart, don't you want to show off in front of Ling Yixue, well, then I will make you completely ashamed!Ling Fei's light skills he had seen before, and he didn't see how clever.Of course, if \"The Tiger Steps Down the Mountain\" alone, he probably can't beat Ling Fei.But he has the power of mountain and river Wuhun. The analysis and drill function of mountain and river Wuhun can allow him to seize the opportunity in any competition.This is the advantage, the advantage that Lingfei does not have!\"Okay, you're a bit brave, but I'm just afraid of being stupid and bold!\"Lin Fei sneered, then looked at Ling Yixue and said: \"Sister, please trouble you to be a witness, so that someone will not admit it after losing.\"\"Not to mention.\"\\n\u3000\u3000 Ling Yixue is still interested in the fight between Ling Fei and Ling Xiao.Because in the elite hall, Ling Fei definitely ranks in the top three. This year's annual comparison, Ling Fei may become an opponent. Observe first, there is no harm.After all, as an outside disciple, Ling Yixue can only get a lot of rewards through various competitions within the clan, otherwise it can't be compared with his clan disciples.She is a very practical person, and she can't say anything that is better than doing anything.When my children secretly practiced advanced exercises, no one felt unfair.Of course, Ling Yixue has no interest in Ling Xiao. The reason why she is willing to help is that she feels that everyone is an outside disciple, and it is too bad for Ling Xiao to be bullied.originally thought that Ling Xiao took the initiative to admit defeat, and then the apology ended.Who knows that Ling Xiao is so ignorant, he even agreed to try lighter with Ling Fei.Even if she is not an opponent of Ling Fei's light merits, Ling Xiao has just been promoted to Wumai Duo for a few days. How could she win it?This is basically a competition of great strength, and the outcome has already been decided.At this time, there were more people watching on the spot. Many people came to Ling Yixue. I heard that Ling Fei was going to compare with Ling Xiao, but they were all disdainful.\\n\u3000\u3000 is not looking down on Ling Fei, but feels that this match is really boring.Is there any suspense in the speed race between the goshawk and the turtle?\"Ling Fei has always said that he will use the stunt at the bottom of the press box during the annual competition, but today in front of Sister Ling Yixue, he estimated that he was going to perform as close as possible.\"\"Hey, watch it lively!\"Everyone smiled and appreciated Ling Yixue's beauty while watching Ling Fei warm up there.As for Ling Xiao.Who cares about a person who will lose?\"I haven't said how?\"someone asked.\"Old rules, let's follow the three items that we usually try to do better.

This is a light skill-high!\"\"There is also a third item that is faster than the fight method. One hundred meters at a distance of one back and forth, whoever is faster will win!\"The three items are very simple, and the evaluation criteria are also very simple. The more such competition, the more you can see the strength of a person, because the possibility of cheating is relatively low.\"Brother Fang Cai Lingxiao has already used light work, it is estimated that the consumption is not small, then as a brother, I will let him once, I will come first!\"Lin Fei thought that in a short time, Ling Xiao's true energy could never be recovered.That's why he did this, not only can he appear fair and noble, but he can also have a long face in front of Ling Yixue.However, if he knew that Ling Fei's rejuvenation tactics could fully restore his true energy in a quarter of an hour, he was afraid that he would not make such a stupid decision.\"Brother Ling is worthy of being Brother Ling. Unlike some people, he hurts people and refuses to apologize. I really don't deserve to be our Ling family.\"\"Okay, don't say it anyway, Brother Ling won, and Ling Xiao had to apologize.\"heard the voice of discussion, Ling Fei was very satisfied.\\n\u3000\u3000 He stood on the starting line and was ready to take off.\"Start!\"With Ling Yixue's order, Ling Fei took off from the sky like a Swift, and flew forward.\"Amazing!\"\"It has to be 15 meters away, it's breaking the record again!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At present, among elite disciples, 14 and a half meters is the best result.And this achievement is also a record created by Ling Fei.In other words, he broke his own record.At this time, everyone was shocked. This Ling Fei may be mediocre, but the light merit is really the elite hall first.\"I can't match you!\"Ling Yixue opened Zhu Zhu lightly and shook his head.\"Sister Sister is polite, I am also good at light work, and nothing else can get into the eyes of Sister Sister Fa!\"Lin Fei said with a smile, the modesty on his mouth, but his face was completely excited.Long face in front of Ling Yixue, can he be unhappy?\"Brother Lingfei, can't you slow down your progress, wait for our brother?\"\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Hahaha, as long as you work hard, you can do it.

This is certain.However, he practiced the Qi Qi, which can nearly double the effect of light power in an instant.Beyond Ling Fei, maybe not a problem.\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Hum, pretend!\"saw Ling Xiao standing indifferently on the starting line, everyone was a little uncomfortable.\"Start!\"As Ling Yixue's voice sounded, Ling Xiao also took off.At the beginning, he didn't use the violent tactics, which can save a little bit of calculation, after all, there are three projects.He does not need to be too shocking, as long as it exceeds Ling Fei.\"Huh? This kid is good at light work. Although he doesn't have Ling Fei's dashing ease, it's also quite decent.\"Ling Yixue frowned slightly, she really didn't expect that Ling Xiao could master her body skill in such a short time.When about 12 meters away, Ling Xiao's body began to fall.\"Hahaha, lose lose!\"\"As I said earlier, he can't compare with Brother Ling Fei!\"\"But twelve meters is not bad, anyway, it's not too ugly!\"However, at this moment, Ling Xiao, who was about to land, suddenly seemed to be pushed by something, and suddenly jumped out more than four meters before landing.\\n\u3000\u3000 The scene was silent, as if all were dumb.\"More than sixteen meters!\"Ling Yixue was the first to speak, and the surprise in her eyes had turned into shock.What happened to Ling Xiao, how could he enter the country so fast?\"I'm right, is it more than sixteen meters?\"\"It's not wrong, but what's the matter with this kid? Just flew out a few meters away suddenly.\"\"Cheating!\"Ling Fei shouted suddenly.\"Not cheating.\"Ling Yixue shook her head and said, \"As a child of the Ling family, haven't you heard of the secret method of \"Violent Secret\"? There is in the library.\"Flame Secret\" Ling Fei, of course, heard of it, but the practice of the secret method has always been more difficult than the practice method, the key is that understanding is very difficult.He had never thought that Ling Xiao had actually learned.Ling Fei was not convinced, but there was no way to tremble with anger, but he had to admit defeat.\\n\u3000\u3000 \"The second item, climb the ladder!\"Ling Xiao's movements are never as chic and elegant as Ling Fei, but they are very practical.As before, the use of the gastronomy tactics is also when I feel about to fall.about 12 meters in height.He still reached twenty meters.\"The second item, Ling Xiao wins!\"Both the emptiness of the sky and the ascent of the sky, they all won!This is a drop of eyeballs, no one dare to say that Ling Xiao can't do anything.Although his light performance is ugly, he is not weak.\"Do you use more than the third item, Brother Ling Fei?\"Ling Xiao looked at Ling Fei's face that had turned into pig liver and asked lightly.\"Comparing! Why not!

This is good. People didn't enter the yard and were stuck here for almost half an hour.If he didn't ask for any benefits, he really didn't want to compare.\"Promise you!

If you want to master it, you have to practice, but it will be easier to practice.This amazing work is amazing work. It is so troublesome and difficult to practice, so the effect will definitely not be bad.Because of this thought in his heart, Ling Xiao was motivated to practice.\\n\u3000\u3000 Probably because of the foundation of \"Tiger Steps Down the Mountain\", coupled with the effect of Wu Wu Soul, Ling Xiao took only one hour to master the one-step realm of \"Xiang Yunbu\".Although \"Xiang Yunbu\" has a total of nine steps, this is the beginning.However, after trying the effect of \"Xiang Yunbu\", Ling Xiao felt that no matter how hard it was, it was really unjust!He tried the effect of \"Xiang Yunbu\" in the forest.The final conclusion is-Even if you don't use \"Courage Secret\", this one-day effect of \"Xiang Yunbu\" can achieve the perfect effect of \"Tiger Steps Down the Mountain\" without using \"Curse Secret\".In the case of using \"Blood Power\", it is much better than \"Big Tiger Down\" that also uses \"Blood Power\".This is a step!Isn't this \"Xiang Yunbu\" turned out to be not the ultimate martial arts, but advanced martial arts?Otherwise, the effect cannot be so good!\\n\u3000\u3000Thinking of this, Ling Xiao's motivation to practice \"Xiang Yunbu\" is even more sufficient.is very simple. He chose to practice \"Xiang Yunbu\" instead of \"Bull Demon Skill\" because that is not only a good martial art for fighting, but also a good martial art for escape.He has only one life in Lingxiao, and after saving his life, he may continue to grow stronger.Long Chong had been sent to the family medicine hall while he was busy practicing to improve his strength.The Ling Family's pharmacy is a place dedicated to refining medicines and healing people.\"Who hurt my son!\"Ling Jiu and Ling Tie's hands had arrived in the medicine hall, and after seeing Ling Chong's miserable appearance, Ling Jiu smashed the stone bench on the ground with a sigh of anger.\"Ling Xiao!\"The disciple who sent Ling Chong to the medicine hall said tremblingly.\"Lingxiao?

This is not what cultivation can bring, and it must be hone through actual combat.At this time, he can clearly see that his true energy is thicker by 50% than that of a day ago through the display on the mountain and river soul.\\n\u3000\u3000 The thicker the true qi, the more times you use \"Breaking Qi\" and the greater the power of \"Meteor Fist\".The most obvious change in the mountains and rivers is the flame in the altar, which is much more vigorous than before.Ling Xiao feels faintly that everything in this mountain and river map seems to have a certain relationship with his body, but it is not yet clear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The breakthrough of the realm must be assisted by certain foreign objects.This not only makes it easier to break through, but also avoids getting into trouble.To put it bluntly, I need the Elixir!Similar medicines like Breakthrough Pill, Huxin Pill, and Humai Pill.He now has only one breakthrough pill in his hand, which is far from enough. For a safe breakthrough, Huxin Pill and Humai Pill are necessary.Because his life is only once, no one protects the law during the breakthrough, so he can only protect himself.After returning home, Ling Xiao did not go to practice again, but entered the room and began to plan his future.Previous year's events in Darby were not daring to think about.However, it is different now. He is sure that he can definitely break through the Wumai triple on the day of the annual comparison.As long as he can achieve good results in Dabi, then he will become a disciple of the Ling family.\\n\u3000\u3000 Since then, he didn\u2019t have to worry about many things, he would get more resources, and he would get some money every month, which is quite different from now.Until then, let alone Ling Feng and Ling Fei, even Ling Yixue, even the genius disciples of the rest of the family in Tianfeng City, he would have to surpass all.\"The effect of mountain and river martial arts seems to be more than just exercises and analysis.

If you can grow plants and raise monsters in mountains and rivers, it would be wonderful.Powerful analysis and drill effects, coupled with the effect of training resources, this is simply perfect!Must try!Ling Xiao looked out of the house, and there was a large dense forest in the back of the Ling family.Tianfeng City is surrounded by mountains, and the mountain range is called \"Fulong Mountain Range\".The Fulong Mountains are densely forested and have complicated terrain. The highest altitude is more than 8,000 meters.\\n\u3000\u3000How big the Fulong Mountain Range is, no one knows, because even if standing on the highest mountain, the entire mountain range cannot be seen through.Legend has it that there is a dragon in the mountain, but no one has ever seen it, but there are a lot of monsters in the mountain. It has always been the fear and love of the warriors.Fear is because the monster is powerful and terrible.likes, because many materials on the monsters can be sold for money, and can also be used for refining medicine and alchemy.The monster beast is artificially divided into ten levels.This is the data obtained by the warriors using their own blood and experience.Generally speaking, the level of monsters and warriors is equivalent, for example, the first-level monsters are basically equivalent to the warriors with one weight of martial arts.is just a special monster, so in actual combat, the first-level monster is stronger than most of the martial arts.The legendary tenth-level beast king can easily destroy a country. That kind of monster is really no one wants to encounter it.Lingxiao went to the Fulong Mountains, not to make money or hunt monsters, but to find some special herbs and some cubs of monsters, try to see if they can be planted and raised in the mountains and rivers.\\n\u3000\u3000Once he succeeds, he will be able to raise those rare plants or animals in the future, which can be a great advantage.\u564c!walked directly across the wall of the Ling family courtyard, Ling Xiao opened the posture, and performed \"Xiang Yunbu\" to the Fulong Mountain Range.\"Xiang Yunbu\" is faster than horseback riding without \"Blood Power\", if you use \"Blood Power\" it will be even more terrifying.Although it consumes true energy, Ling Xiao practiced \"Return Qi\", basically can guarantee that his true energy consumption will not be too large.Let's talk about it, at the same time as practicing the light exercises, it is also a kind of cultivation itself.Not long ago, Ling Xiao had already reached the periphery of the Fulong Mountains.He dared not enter the forest too deep. In case of a brutal monster, even a beast king, he was not enough to die ten lives.Anyway, he came here only for two purposes. One is to do experiments to see if the mountains and rivers can be planted and cultivated.The other is to collect materials for alchemy.\\n\u3000\u3000 Ling's pharmacy has a special medicine refining and alchemy master, as long as you provide materials and then pay a certain labor cost, then he will refine the medicine for you.Of course, the premise is that you must be a disciple of the Ling family.The moment when he entered the jungle, Ling Xiao suddenly smiled.Because he discovered another benefit of Shanhetu.On the mountain and river map, a cloud dispersed and a jungle appeared. It is not difficult to find out if you look closely. This is the Fulong Mountain Range.It's just that the Fulong Mountains shown on this map only have a radius of about one kilometer with Lingxiao as the center. UU reading www.uukanshu.comIf you only show the map, it is not surprising, the key is that there are several options displayed on the map.\"Herb!\"\"The Beast!\"\"Demon!\"\\n \"Humanity!\"These options can be clicked, if selected, they will be displayed on the map.The herb shows green dots. After clicking, you can see what kind of herb it is, and there will be a simple information display.Beasts show yellow dots, monsters have red dots, there will be a level display after clicking on it, humans are white dots, after clicking, there is also a simple data analysis, but it is not as detailed as monsters.Seeing this, Ling Xiao was about to laugh with excitement. He felt the magic of his mountain and river martial arts more and more.This picture seems to include the whole world, but it needs some things to trigger before it can be displayed.But the excitement returned to the excitement, he did not forget what he came to do today, now that this display is available, it is convenient.Lingxiao's main goal is herbs and monsters below level 3.\"it has started!\"Lingxiao looked at one of the green dots, then rose into the sky and ran towards the green dot.\\nThe plant shown by the green dot is a plant called \"Sky Vanilla\".This herb is the most important herb for refining \"Humai Dan\".The only trouble is that this herb basically grows on cliffs of tens or even hundreds of meters.If it was before, Ling Xiao collected it by himself?Dare not even think about it.But now it's all right, \"Xiang Yunbu\" urged, stepped on the cliff, one or two hundred meters high is very easy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For this one, it takes twelve silver to buy it.It takes twenty heavenly herbs to refining a pulse-protecting Danzu foot!There are a lot of sky herbs near here. Ling Xiao did not do anything at all, pulled out all the long-ripe sky herbs, and landed on the ground.Enter the mountain and river map.He did not forget his purpose of coming this time.Heaven herb, only when used within one hour after collection, can the maximum effect be exerted.Although it can be used for a long time, the efficacy is much worse.\\n\u3000\u3000 If it can be said that it can really be planted in mountain and river maps, then this is wonderful.\"Welcome the lord of the mountain and river to enter the mountain and river map again.

With the continuous upgrade of the mountain and river map, you will get more help. At present, the second level of the mountain and river map can only recruit second-level farmers and second-level herders!\"\"In addition, after the mountains and rivers are upgraded to the second level, there will be shops, and the masters of the mountains and rivers can use these shops to buy the items they need, including weapons, immortals, treasures, tools, etc.\"\"All commodities have ordinary grades-fine products-treasures-immortals-five grades of Divine Grade, according to different grades, the effect is different!\"\"At present, the mountain and river map is already second-level, the store is opened, the first time you open the store, you will receive a lucky draw!\"\"The level of the warrior will increase, and the soul of the mountain and river will become stronger, and the level of the mountain and river map will also increase!

For example, the mountain and river dominate the Wumai double repair, and the mountain and river map is two levels!\"\"The higher the level of the mountain and river map, the more types of products that can be purchased, the higher the grade, and the more powerful the mountain and river residents that can be recruited! It may even recruit the top presences in all walks of life-Wushen, Yaoshen, and craftsmen. God and so on!\"\\n\u3000\u3000 was a little dumbfounded by this series of prompts before he recovered, and hurriedly opened the Shanhetu store and looked at it.There are only twelve items in it, but they are refreshed every two hours.Currently, the commodities in this category are mainly agricultural tools.For example, the **** of all kinds of products-weeding efficiency is increased by 10%, and the service life is increased by 10%!Another example is a high-quality sickle-double the harvesting efficiency, double the service life, and double the effort!These should all be used in the pictures of mountains and rivers. If you give them to the farmers, you can definitely do more with less.But things are not over yet.\"For the first time, the leader of the mountain and river uses the recruitment function, which can recruit second-level farmers and second-level herders, and can buy ordinary goods!\"\"The first recruitment will not consume anything, but only two people can be recruited, please choose!\"With this sound, Ling Xiao saw two cards appearing on the mountain and river map. The cards were painted with farmers and herdsmen, and they used a landscape style of painting, which was very beautiful.\\n\u3000\u3000 cards also show the special effects brought by second-level farmers and second-level herders.Second-level farmers\u2014The efficiency of agricultural production is increased by 10%, and the quality of agricultural production is improved by 10%.Second-level herdsmen: The production efficiency of animal husbandry is increased by 10%, and the production quality of animal husbandry is improved by 10%.That is to say, when planting herbs in mountains and rivers, not only the output efficiency will be improved, but also the quality of the herbs produced will also be improved.The same is true for farmed animals.Ling Xiao excitedly chose a second-level farmer card and a second-level herder card.He intends to grow some herbs and raise several animals at the same time. Let me get familiar with this function first. If it is really very easy to use, I will increase the investment later.\"See the master of the mountains and rivers, please assign tasks!\"After choosing to recruit, a white smoke flew in front of me, and soon two people appeared, one dressed as a farmer, probably in his thirties, and the other dressed as a herdsman, also in his thirties.It\u2019s just that the farmer is a human being, and the herdsman doesn\u2019t look like a human being, but the Tauren tribe that Ling Xiao has seen in the pictures of mountains and rivers.\\n\u3000\u3000 Of course, whether it is a human or a tauren, they can understand what Ling Xiao said, but whether others can understand it is not known.Ling Xiao asked the herdsmen of the Niutou group to go to rest first, anyway, he hasn't caught the demon cubs yet.Then he handed the hemp herbs he collected to the human farmer and told him: \"You plant these herbs, remember, don't break them, these herbs are very precious.\"\"Understood, mountains and rivers dominate!\"After accepting the order, the farmers went to work.Ling Xiao was a little worried at first, so he followed to observe.After a while, he was completely relieved.This profession is a profession. If he is allowed to grow Sky Vanilla, it is estimated that no more than half of this bunch of Sky Vanilla can grow.But all the second-class farmers are all alive and still very fast.Lingxiao is now looking forward to the future. If you go on like this, if you don't succeed, you can directly recruit the pharmacist in the mountains and rivers. UU reading www.uukanshu.com\\n\u3000\u3000 In that case, alchemy and alchemy no longer have to look at other people's faces.There are even weapons, tools and the like, which can be completed in the mountain and river map.He did not rush out of the mountains and rivers, because some things had to be carefully understood.Employment of manpower is required to recruit people in mountain and river maps or to purchase goods.And Shanhebi can be exchanged in real currency.For example, Ling Xiao got a hundred or two silver in reality, he can choose to use it himself, or he can choose to exchange it for Shanhe coins.According to the ratio, twelve silver can be exchanged for a mountain and river coin, and recruiting a second-level farmer or a second-level herdsman requires ten mountain and river coins, which is equivalent to one hundred or two silver coins, which is not cheap.But the effect is also very amazing, Ling Xiao does not feel a loss.And because of the relatively low level of mountains and rivers, there are only two types of residents recruited, and the level is only second-level.If your cultivation level continues to increase and the level of mountain and river maps continues to increase, then not only will the number of residents recruited increase, but the level will also increase.\\n\u3000\u3000 By that time, the efficiency of work will naturally be higher.Thinking about this, Ling Xiao is all motivated. He has another reason to improve his strength.\"Yes, I almost forgot to say that I just opened the store for the first time and gave a lucky draw opportunity to see what good things can be drawn.

For example, there is a set of intermediate-level exercises called \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\".Such exercises are not available in the Ling Family's Book Collection, which can be said to be extremely rare.Looking at the description of the exercises, it seems that after the hundred-step flying sword is completed, it can take the first level hundreds of meters away.This feels more powerful than bows and arrows.Bows and arrows cannot be controlled. After shooting, they shoot.This \"100 Steps Flying Sword Technique\" is controllable. As long as you practice the qi, even if the flying sword is shot, you can still control the speed and flight trajectory.\\n\u3000\u3000 This is a cow!\"Hundred Steps Flying Sword! Elixir!\"\"Hundred Steps Flying Sword! Elixir!\"These are the two things Ling Xiao wants most now, so when the turntable rotates, he can't help shouting in the mouth, hoping to get it smoothly.\"Pretty! It is \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword\"!\"Ling Xiao jumped up excitedly.Although this \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword\" can not be improved, but it is too much for the improvement of combat power. Imagine that you can fly the sword to kill when others are not close to you. That is really unparalleled.\"Congratulations to Master Shanhe for drawing the intermediate skill \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\". Because you are using the draw function for the first time, you are rewarded with a flying sword.\"It was a pleasant surprise.Ling Xiao looked at the introduction of the flying sword\u2014\u2014Breeze Sword: The fine flying sword can only be used to display flying sword martial arts, the flying speed is increased by 20%, and the power of the practice is increased by 20%.\\n\u3000\u3000 Remarks: The special effects obtained from the mountain and river space are only effective for the mountain and river masters. If they are given to others, the special effects disappear.In addition, after the item is snatched, you can go to the mountain and river map to get the same thing again for an unlimited number of times.This remark is understandable, that is to say, even if this sword is robbed by others, it is just an ordinary sword, and there will be no increase in the flying speed and the power of the power.This is pretty good. After all, he is guilty of crime. Ling Xiao still has no way to keep his own good things. Maybe he may be robbed of this flying sword by others.But grab it, grab it. Ordinary steel swords, nothing really worthy of distress, anyway, the mountains and rivers will give compensation again.So don't worry about it at all.It's just that this breeze sword clearly corresponds to the martial arts of flying swords. For example, \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\" is one of them.should be used for a single purpose, but even this is enough.Ling Xiao is not a greedy person. With these, his combat effectiveness has definitely improved a lot. Now when he meets Ling Chong, he does not need to do anything at all. Once the flying sword comes out, Ling Chong must be hung up on the spot.obtained \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\" Ling Xiao temporarily put down other work. After he came out of the mountain and river map, he found a quiet place to start practicing this intermediate-level exercise.is different from other martial arts. Although \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\" also has nine layers to complete, but it has only one move, that is, flying sword.\\n\u3000\u3000 After all, it's just an intermediate skill, and you can't ask it to be too good.spent two days, Ling Xiao practiced \"100 Steps Flying Sword Technique\" to the nine-story consummation.With the analysis and exercises of Shan Wu Wu Hun, it is too easy to practice this single-stroke martial art.The most obvious feeling is that the higher the \"100 Steps Flying Sword Technique\" is, the faster the flying sword is, and the greater the power. After the nine-layer consummation, a sword will fly out, killing a warrior with three peaks of martial arts. No problem.Unless the other party practices any powerful defensive skills.Ga\u2014\u2014Suddenly, Ling Xiao heard a sharp cry from the sky.He looked up and saw that it was a second-level peak monster black vulture.These two black sculptures are not the first time they hovered above Ling Xiao's head in two days. They seem to be looking for a time to kill Ling Xiao.With it, Ling Xiao was very depressed after two days of cultivation. He had to change several places and almost got caught up.Today, the beast dare to come again, just try the power of Baibu Feijian!\\n\u3000\u3000 Thinking of this, Ling Xiao stood up, squeezing the breeze sword in his hand, urging the true Qi in his body, and running \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\".Swoosh!The breeze sword turned into a residual image and broke away.The sharp roaring sound pierced the air, and approached the black eagle that was hovering at a very fast speed.Compared to bows and arrows, the advantage of \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword\" is that he does not need to aim, as long as he locks the target, then unless the opponent blocks or avoids, he will definitely be able to hit.\"Ga -\"The flying sword was too fast. When the black eagle was discovered, it was too late to hide. A white light pierced its body, and blood spattered.\"Oh, failed to hit the point!\"The hundred-step flying sword was cast for the first time, and Ling Xiao was obviously a little strange, so that although this sword had pierced the black eagle, it failed to hit the point.After all, that stuff is equivalent to the second-level pinnacle monster of the Wumai double peak warrior. If it is not the point, this sword will not be able to kill it at all.The black eagle was furious and swooped down, apparently desperately trying to fight Ling Xiao.\\n\u3000\u3000 But this black eagle brain is not as good as human beings. It doesn\u2019t even know that the one hundred flying swords come and go!Let go!Come back!This is an attack!Therefore, when the black eagle accelerates to dive, the breeze sword has returned, this time directly puncturing the head of the black eagle.This is not controlled by Ling Xiao, because the energy inside the body can\u2019t be released until the gang gas is not controlled~www.novelbuddy.com~ but because the black vulture moved its position so that the flying sword returned along the same path Just punctured its head.\"Luck!\"Ling Xiao could not help but breathe a sigh of relief.It seems that cultivation is one thing, but actual combat is another.When he practiced \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\" these two days, he used stones or trees as his target.These are all fixed targets, so it's a natural hit.\\n\u3000\u3000 It seems that if you want to fully master the hundred-step flying sword technique, try to attack the monster!There are a lot of valuable materials on the black sculpture, and if it is sold on the market, it can be sold for a thousand or two shadows.After all, this is a second-level peak monster.Its blood and bones can be used for alchemy.Throwed the body of the black eagle into the mountain and river picture. Ling Xiao carried the breeze sword and cast \"Xiang Yunbu\" to start searching in the Fulong Mountains.He was looking for the cubs of monsters. Of course, by the way, he hunted a few monsters below level three, and he could also use them to sell the money.After all, it is a little too eye-catching to sell the secrets of exercises. Basic martial arts and low-level martial arts are okay to say that once they sell intermediate martial arts, it is impossible to find them.\"Hey? That's the black bird!\"When Ling Xiao killed Black Eagle before, he wondered whether this guy would leave a fledgling, so he deliberately searched along the place where Black Eagle often circulated.Sure enough, I found a bird's nest on a cliff with four chicks in it.Ling Xiao put it into the mountain and river map without saying anything, and then gave it to the second-level herdsman to help raise it.\\n\u3000\u3000 Not only can the material of this black sculpture be used for refining medicine, but it is also a second-level peak monster when you grow up without practicing. It can also be used as a helper at a critical moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Three days later, these two intermediate body methods have already achieved great consummation.Lingxiao directly opened the two steps of \"Xiangyunbu\".Then continue to practice.\\n\u3000\u3000 After reaching the second step, the speed of \"Xiangyunbu\" has already surpassed the warrior of the same level, even the martial peak triple warrior is not as fast as him.If you use \"Blood Power\", you can easily escape even if you encounter the martial arts quadruple warrior.As for \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\", he is also often used when hunting monsters, so in these three days, he can almost apply \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\" to the point of pure fire.Freely retractable, more accurate when targeting.If you let him meet the black vulture before, there will never be a situation where it can't hit the key for the first time, and it can definitely be killed with a sword.Three consecutive days of continuous cultivation of body skills and \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\", because every time you have to run \"Red Sun Gong\", it also makes Chi Yang Gong enter the country quickly, and has reached the ninth level, close to the Great Consummation realm.Of course, in addition to the improvement of strength, there are also many other gains.In addition to the monsters hunted can be worth two or thirty-two thousand silver, his mountain and river map already has ten kinds of plant herbs and three monster beasts.If it is not because of the small number of farmers and herders, if he can\u2019t take care of it, he will definitely choose to stay here for a few more days.But now it\u2019s time to go back, the materials are almost collected, and it\u2019s time to take the refining elixir.After all, the key is to increase the strength to Wumai triple, which is very important for the annual comparison that will come in a few days.I want to say regret, that is, I haven't seen a monster of the third level peak these days.\\n\u3000\u3000 No way, he really dared not go alone into the depths of the Fulong Mountains, because it was too dangerous, and if it was a small life, it was really uneconomical.\"Aooo--!\"As Ling Xiao was about to leave, he suddenly found a huge red dot on the mountain and river map.Then came a howling that was enough to make him blood and blood shake.\"Fourth-level monster-Xiaoyue Wolf!\"Ling Xiao opened the red dot, and was startled.Hurry up, level three peak monster beast can deal with it, level four monster beast don't think about it, it is definitely not his martial arts double peak peak warrior can deal with.\"Go away! This wolf moon wolf is drawn from the mountain!\"Just wanted to leave, he saw a group of teenagers coming around.

Although he was obviously only fifteen or sixteen years old, he seemed to be a master.Lingxiao left about two or three hundred meters away, and stopped. He was very interested. How did the Li family, one of the four big families in Tianfeng City, clean up this Xiaoyue wolf.Fourth-level monster, that is equivalent to the four-fold martial arts warrior, has been able to exert gang qi.The disciples of the Li family arranged the trap, leaving only Li Xingyun as a bait there, and the rest were hiding, preparing to attack together after the wolf moon wolf entered the trap.However, they obviously underestimated the strength of the Xiaoyuewolf.\"Oh!\"When Xiaoyue Lang rushed over, Zhangkou howled, and a blade-like gust of gas flew out of his mouth, and the ground was shoveled up. The traps originally arranged were all destroyed.\"No, this guy is too strong, and very cunning, we are not opponents, withdraw!\"Li Xingyun originally wanted to try his martial arts triple peak cultivation to face the fourth-level monster, but he obviously did not expect the fourth-level monster to be so strong.is completely unexpected.This means that he can resist a few times and change someone else, and he will definitely be killed directly by the blade-shaped gang gas.\"what--!\"\\n\u3000\u3000 His voice had just dropped, and someone had been cut off directly.The man, who is the warrior of the double peak of Wumai, hid behind the big tree.

Instead of turning around to escape, he shook the long sword in his hand and aimed at Xiaoyue Wolf.The blade-shaped gang gas that just attacked him was blocked by his sword.This also made him clear the gap between himself and the fourth-level monster.is impossible to win!But maybe it will last for a while!I have to say that Ling Xiao is a little amazed by this Li Xingyun. Such a person is much smarter than Ling Fei, Ling Chong and Ling Feng.\\n\u3000\u3000 Perhaps Ling Yixue can be compared with it.\"Storm Sword!\"Li Xingyun snorted and kicked his feet to the ground. The man had already flew out, and the long sword pointed directly at the throat of Xiaoyue Lang.No matter what monster, the throat is always the weakest place, which Li Xingyuan obviously also knows.Sword of Stormwind?It should be advanced swordsmanship. This Li Xingyun is worthy of the Li family's genius. Actually, he can get advanced swordsmanship. It seems to be the object of key training.\"Brother Nebula, come on!\"\"Kill that evil barrier!\"Seeing Li Xingyun's attack, those originally disturbed children of the Li family actually stopped and began to cry there.\"It's really a bunch of scumbags.

If he hurries, he will definitely not be better than Li Rui.The rest of Li's children were suddenly awakened by Li Xingyun.\\n\u3000\u3000 They understood the terrible strength of Ling Xiao!The strength of this guy is definitely more than the double peak of Wumai!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That's a real genius. How could that kid be comparable?\"\\n\u3000\u3000The four sons of Tianfeng City are all warriors who have been promoted to the fourfold of Wumai before the age of 14, which is definitely an example for all young people in Tianfeng City.\"That is, Brother Nebula, you can't afford that Lingxiao too. If you are not injured today, Lingxiao will definitely die.\"\"of course!\"Although Li Xingyun respects Ling Xiao, he is more confident. If he is not injured today, Li Rui will never die.\"By the way, don\u2019t talk nonsense after going back here today, it means that Li Rui was killed by Xiaoyue Wolf, otherwise we all have to be unlucky, Li Rui\u2019s grandfather is the elder of our family, his grandson was killed by the Ling family , We didn\u2019t help, do you know what the consequences will be?\"Suddenly, Li Xingyun sneered.\"Understand, Brother Nebula.\"After leaving the Fulong Mountains, Ling Xiao went to the market first, and replaced all the excess materials with silver, a total of 35,000.This money is necessary, because even if you want to help the Ling family's pharmacy to refine the panacea, you have to pay the labor service fee, and you can't do it without money.And the more precious immortality medicine, the higher the labor cost required.\\n\u3000\u3000 But 35,000 two silver, that is more than enough.After \u3000\u3000, he went to the auction house again and took one hundred or two silver earned from his basic auction skills, still giving others a handling fee of twelve.All the silver was stored in the mountain and river map by him.This is safer than putting it in a silver number.He heard that there is a thing called storage ring in this world, but he has never seen it, and even if there is, it is definitely not as good as his mountain and river map.This time he had no plans to sell the exercises.With the silver, this adventurous thing can be temporarily stopped first, so as not to get out of the way.After leaving the auction house, Ling Xiao speeded up and returned to the Ling family, went directly to the medicine hall.Medicine Hall is a place where Ling family specializes in making medicine and healing wounds. There are many people at any time.So it's really difficult to avoid people who don't want to meet.\\n\u3000\u3000No, as soon as I arrived at the medicine hall, Ling Xiao found that Ling Yu and Ling Feng were coming here too.Ling Yu is still the charming girl. At this time, holding the arm of Ling Feng, the sweet energy is really a bit jealous.Lingfeng is still dressed in white, looks very chic, and the momentum seems to be stronger than when he last saw it.The whole person stood there, like a sword with a sheath.\"Oh, little beggar, are you coming to the medicine hall again to get medicine residue?\"Ling Xiao discovered Ling Feng and Ling Yu, and they naturally discovered Ling Xiao.Because no one is hiding.When there was no money before, Ling Xiao always came to the medicine hall to ask for some medicine residue, mainly for cultivation.Because of this, he was laughed at and ridiculed.\"Well, our holy ancestor from the Northern Han Dynasty was also a beggar, with long hair and short hair!\"\\n\u3000\u3000 sneered and snorted, without much entanglement, throwing the next sentence, and entered the medicine hall.It's still important to do your own business. It's really boring to fight.\"Oh, even if the kid dared to compare with the ancestor, I really don't know how high and thick! I heard that he seemed to have defeated Ling Chong a few days ago and won Ling Fei in light skill. \"said Ling Feng coldly.Speaking of no one at the beginning, I am afraid that the word is most suitable for him, but it is him Ling Feng.Ling Xiao has never looked down on anyone, including Ling Chong, who has been defeated twice by him in a row, he has made all his efforts.\"Hee hee, Brother Feng is right, that Grandpa is a genius, what is he, a poor beggar.\"Ling Yu is also a hee hee, not taking Ling Xiao seriously.In her opinion, Ling Xiao's strength has improved, but she has no money, no backstage, and she can't go forward.Ling Xiao didn't know the two men's argument. After he entered the pharmacy, he went directly to the counter, where he registered.\\n\u3000\u3000To break through the Wumai triple, all he needs is to break through one of the pill, Huxin pill and Humai pill. In addition, the Juqi pill to enhance the true energy also needs a little, and it will be used in special situations in the future.If you buy directly, the breakthrough Dan is one thousand two silver, UU reading www.uukanshu. com Huxin Dan and Humai Dan are the same price.And Ju Qi Dan is a little cheaper, one is 500 silver.Although Ling Xiao can afford it, he doesn't need to spend these injustices. He has the materials. After providing, Breakthrough Pill, Huxin Pill and Humai Pill only need to give one hundred or two silver each as a service fee.Jiqidan only needs fifty-two silver labor fee.\"Brother Feng, this time I should break through the Wumai triple. You have to get me the Breakthrough Pill, Huxin Pill and Humai Pill, or I will not be happy!\"At this time, Ling Yu and Ling Feng also came in.Listening to Ling Yu's meaning, she seems to be preparing to break through, but this is also normal. After all, Ling Yu has already been a martial arts double warrior very early, plus Lingfeng's elixir, it is a bit strange not to break through .\"Sister Rain, you also know that the annual Dabi is about to start. I must seize the time to break through to the fourfold of Wumai. I need a lot of breakthrough Dan, Huxin Dan and Humai Dan. You should be wronged first.\"Listen to this meaning, Ling Feng does not intend to spend money on Ling Yu. He now has to break through the fourfold of Wumai wholeheartedly, and the amount of panacea required is huge.\\n\u3000\u3000Although he is also a child of the Ling family, his family is not as good as Ling Chong, and even Ling Chong cannot be profligate.The Ling family can become one of the four major families in Tianfeng City. This rule is still relatively strict. Although some people will occasionally violate it, it is only a small number.\"Well, is it always okay to buy two Qiqidan?\"Ling Yu was obviously not very happy, he grumbled.\"I'm afraid of you, okay, just use the Qi Qi Dan, you can consolidate your current cultivation.\"Lingfeng nodded and said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I don\u2019t know how Ling Yu will feel when he hears it?\"Sir, please give me a heart-protecting pill, a pulse-protecting pill, a breakthrough pill, and ten more Qiqi pill!\"Most of the people in the pharmacy are old people. At this time, the one standing behind the counter is, in terms of seniority, the teacher of Ling Xiao.\"Oh, this is not Ling Xiao, I have prepared the medicine residue for you today.\"This old man is definitely not satire Ling Xiao, but sincerely concerned about Ling Xiao.Before Ling Xiao came to take the medicine residue almost every day. Before he knew this teacher, he was always insulted and made trouble.\\n\u3000\u3000However, after knowing this teacher, it is different. The old man will always prepare the medicine residue for him, just wait for him to get it.\"Uncle, I don't want medicine residue today, I want to break through Dan, Huxin Dan, Humai Dan, and Qi Qi Dan, this is what I want.\"Some of the children of the Ling family who had come to buy immortality next to it, or received treatment, thought they had misheard Ling Xiao and ignored it.But this time Ling Xiao said it again.They could hear clearly.looked at Ling Xiao with strange eyes.\"Hehehe, Brother Feng, the poor light egg actually said he was going to buy the Elixir and laughed!\"Ling Yu couldn't help but chuckled. In her view, Ling Xiao was really crazy.Those immortals can't even afford her, let alone Ling Xiao.\"Those things he wants are counted at eight thousand two silvers, but he dares to brag!\"Lingfeng also sneered with disdain.\\n\u3000\u3000 Eight thousand two silvers, even if he is, he can get so much money at the end of a month, it is because he has a good father.What is Lingxiao?An out-of-town disciple, with an old beggar with a dilapidated family at home, how could there be so much money?\"Little guy, get rich?\"asked the old man at the counter with a smile.\"Uncle, I went into the Fulong Mountains these days. I was lucky to collect some herbs. I also killed a few monsters. I have a lot of money on my body.\"Speaking of words, Ling Xiao took out the materials of Humai Dan, Huxin Dan and Breakthrough Dan and handed it over: \"Uncle Shi, the three medicinal medicinal exchange methods, as for Qi Qi Dan, directly buy it. \"Under the stunned crowd, Ling Xiao spent 5,332 silver and three copies of alchemy materials to get what he wanted.Ling Yu's laughter came to an abrupt end.Ling Feng's disdain turned into a surprise.\"With his strength, how can he enter the Fulong Mountain Range and still be able to kill the monsters?\"\\n\u3000\u3000 Ling Yu and Ling Feng were shocked inexplicably.Not only is Ling Xiao rich, but also because Ling Xiao can retreat from the whole body of Fulong Mountain.Know that although there are no mandatory regulations in the family, it is generally not recommended that martial arts under the four-fold Wumai enter the Fulong Mountains.If you have to go, you must keep more than ten people, and you must have a martial arts triple peak warrior to lead the team.More importantly, intelligence moves at the edge.Until today, Ling Feng and Ling Yu have not been to the Fulong Mountains.Because they have money, they can ask their family members without having to work hard.At this moment, they felt as if they were being compared by Ling Xiao at once, with an embarrassed expression on their faces.\"Good boy, you are really rich, and have grown! Well, Uncle takes medicine for you!\"\"Yes, Uncle, I'll get another 100 pieces of gold medicine and ten bottles of healing pills...\"Ling Xiao suddenly thought that if he often went to the Fulong Mountains, he would definitely be injured. There is a gold wound medicine for trauma treatment, and a healing pill for internal injury treatment, and these things are not very expensive.\\n\u3000\u3000 Of course, this is only for the warrior.For ordinary people, these things are still sky-high.Because a piece of gold medicine is one or two silver, a hundred pieces is one hundred and two, a bottle of healing pills is about one hundred, worth one hundred or two silver, ten bottles is one thousand two.Before this, Ling Xiao couldn't even think of it, but now it can be bought easily.This is the gap.\"no problem!\"After the transaction was completed, when Ling Xiao went out, Chong Lingfeng and Ling Yu nodded slightly, then smiled.saw the two pig liver-colored faces, and he was very happy in his heart.But did not go to the joke on the spot.The most important thing right now is to improve strength.Because he knows that his current strength is not an opponent of people like Ling Feng and Li Xingyun.\\n\u3000\u3000 Strength is everything!With strength, there is dignity, and there will be more money!Ling Feng ignored Ling Xiao.Ling Yu looked at Ling Xiao awkwardly, something seemed to have changed in his eyes, and there was even a trace of regret.\"Well, it's fun for you to improve your strength. When the annual comparison is over, I want to make you lose your heart!\"It wasn't until Ling Xiao was about to leave the entrance of the medicine hall that Ling Feng turned his head and grinned a word for it.It's just that his smile is really uglier than crying.Ling Xiao smiled, didn't say anything, anyway, the year's Dabi is about to start, and now everything is redundant.After leaving the pharmacy, he returned directly to his home.Grandpa's body seems to be much better.\"You child, go out without saying hello.\"\\nGrandpa \u3000\u3000 seems a little angry.\"Grandpa, don't be angry. It's a hundred or two silver. You can buy whatever you want in the future. We have money now. We don't have to live like the beggars before. In addition, I plan to make this house. Renovate it, otherwise it will be impossible to live on a rainy day.\"\"Where do you come from so much money?\"\"Grandpa~www.novelbuddy.com~Anyway, it's not stolen or robbed, you can rest assured, your grandson is now entering the country quickly, and it is estimated that when the annual comparison is over, it will not be a problem to break through the triple of Wumai.\"Ling Xiao did not explain much. He threw a hundred or two silver parcels on the table, and then went back to the room to prepare for a breakthrough.These days in the Fulong Mountains, he has been continually training and fighting, but in fact, his strength has long been able to break through.The reason why \u3000\u3000 didn't break through was not that it was impossible, but that he deliberately suppressed it.Without Huxin Dan and Humai Dan, it is very dangerous to break through. He does not want any accidents to happen.The poor have only one life.Unlike those rich people, even if only half of their lives are left, their family will save them.But he can't, once he is seriously injured, it is basically not far from death.\\n\u3000\u3000Take Breakthrough Pill, Huxin Pill, and Humai Pill separately, and then Ling Xiao started to cross the knee and started \"Chiyanggong\", ready to break through the third martial arts.Really don't say, the power to break through Dan is really fierce. When one goes down, the power of terror immediately melts in Dan Tian, \u200b\u200band then wrapped in the true energy in his body, he suddenly rushed to the third martial arts.\"No wonder you need to protect Xinxin and Humaidan, if not, this terrifying power will break your heart!\"The power of breaking through Dan surprised Ling Xiao, and the functions of Huxin Dan and Humai Dan were even greater than he thought.After the true qi has increased, the meridians will inevitably be enlarged. Without these two immortals, the meridians will break if they fail.And now don't worry about it, the violent power will not only destroy him, but will expand his meridians, make his body more adaptable to stronger qi, and prepare for the future promotion of Wumai quadruple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I haven't failed to live up to the two beggars of the old beggars. I only hope you can be safe.\"Ling Xiao did not know what was happening outside the house.didn't even know that his parents might still be alive.He is now wholeheartedly trying to break through the triple realm of Wumai, and is using the power to break through Dan to constantly hit the third Wumai.After one night.Ling Xiao suddenly opened her eyes, and then punched out.\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Wow!\"remembered with a loud voice, the thick brick wall in front of him actually shattered with a big hole.He could feel that his whole body Qi has an amazing improvement, including muscles, bones, veins and blood seem to strengthen a lot.This fist, even if it's less, there is a lot of power!This is the strongest force that a warrior under Wumai triple can fight.\"Unexpectedly, it was so easy to break through, and it seemed that Wu Shan Soul was extraordinary!\"Ling Xiao is very clear, although the breakthrough Dan works well, it is definitely not so good.After all, his success is inseparable from Shan Wu Wu Hun.When I broke through last night, every time I felt that I was going to fall short, there would always be a bizarre power word from the mountain and river Wuhun to help him defeat the obstacles.Plus that he has been suppressing no breakthrough for so many days, it can be said that the power has reached the verge of coming out.Now it will be released, and natural breakthrough will be easier.\\n\u3000\u3000 But Wumai Mie is just the beginning!Although Ling Xiao was excited in his heart, he also understood that at the moment, he was at most the line of disciples Ling Fei, Ling Feng and Ling Tie.There is still a gap compared with Ling Yixue and Li Xingyun.And people may break through the fourfold of Wumai at any time.Triple to quadruple, it seems to be just a realm, but it is a world apart.After all, true qi is incomparable to gang qi.The power has changed qualitatively, and all attacks will have a qualitative improvement.It can be said that, unless people with triple martial arts can also use gangqi, otherwise, it is absolutely impossible to challenge the martial arts quadruple martial artists.The showdown between Li Xingyun and Xiaoyue Wolf was obvious.\"What happened?\"Hong Qi came over and heard a loud noise, and was immediately dumbfounded: \"I said, kid, you're doing something wrong? How did you demolish the house?\"\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Grandpa, as I said, we have money now, don't worry about this house, let's build another one.\"The reason why Ling Xiao wants to become stronger is that in addition to not wanting to be bullied, another purpose is of course to want to live a good life.Such a house that leaks in a rain, he really has enough.\"You child, even if you want to build a house, where do we live now?\" Hong Qi smiled bitterly.\"I'm not afraid, there is a rented house out of Ling's house. Let's rent it for a while and wait for the house to be repaired before moving back.\"Ling Xiao smiled and said: \"Grandpa, I will go to the construction team to repair the house for us.\"After speaking, he ran away happily.has just broken through the Wumai triple, and he is not afraid of meeting anyone for trouble.In other words, in fact, he really hopes that someone will come to find trouble, so that he can also try how strong he is now.As soon as he left the door of the Ling family, a man turned and sneaked away at the corner.\"Brother Nebula, that guy came out.\"\\n\u3000\u3000 This man came into a small forest, and Li Xingyun was talking to two other middle-aged people.The strength of these two middle-aged people is similar to that of Li Rui.\"Okay, I know, two of them, this is one hundred or two silver, I don't want to live a mouth, just kill it! After that, another hundred or two will be given to you.\"Li Xingyun's face sneered sensibly.\"Hey, Master Li, don't worry, our brothers always use people's money to eliminate disasters. We won't do anything else, but killing people is easy!\"\u2026\u2026Ling Xiao came out of the Ling family, went to the market to find a carpenter, discussed the matter of building a house, and then returned to the Ling family briskly.passed by a small forest, he suddenly stopped.\"Friend, why do you hide your head when you are here?\"He looked at a tree not far away, his eyes sharp and cold.\"Hahaha, boy, you can find us, it looks not weak.\"\\n\u3000\u3000 sounded, and two people fell from the tree.are all in their thirties, wearing a masked black scarf, dressed as a warrior unlike Tianfeng City, but more like a bandit.\"Black scarf thief?\"Ling Xiao recognized the dress of these two people.This is a group of fierce gangsters, usually moving around Tianfeng City, but because the four families of Tianfeng City are relatively strong, they are afraid to enter the city easily.But their fierce reputation is not bad. It is said that there are a total of six or seven hundred people in the team, led by 13 leaders.is only called a black scarf thief because they like black scarf masking. In addition, this group of people have scimitar sashimi on their arms, which is easy to recognize.\"Boy, since you know Grandpa, don't talk nonsense, take out all the silver on your body and spare you a life!\"Although Li Xingyun's errand was received, the black scarf thief has always been greedy for money and murderous, and of course they are more willing to maximize their profits.When the two were talking, they had already left and right, and they did not give Ling Xiao a chance to escape.\"Oh, before the family gave a reward, kill an ordinary black-scarred thief, one hundred or two silver rewards, and get ten points of merit. UU reading www.uukanshu.com Since you two have come, don't go back! \"\\n\u3000\u3000 Ling Xiao smiled, calm and calm.One hundred or two silver is still a large number for him, and the merits are even more important.Generally speaking, only those with more than four martial arts qualities are eligible to accept family missions and gain merits.The merits can not only exchange things among the family, but also enhance the status of the family.For thousands of years, the Lings have been doing this.As long as you get a hundred points of merit, you can change from a ninth grade family to an eighth grade family.Nine and other family members have no money, and may be driven away at any time, not enjoying many privileges of the Ling family.Eight-family family is different. Not only do they have regular money every month, but as long as they do not make big mistakes, they will not be driven away, and they have the status of true Ling family.Ling Xiao has been a beggar since childhood, so he hopes to have a family that can shield himself from the wind and rain.Although he came to the Ling family and suffered a lot of grievances, he also received a lot of benefits. He naturally refused to leave.\"Boy, you are really as arrogant as the rumor, kill us to receive the reward? I'm afraid you don't have that life!\"\\n\u3000\u3000 as rumored?Ling Xiao's heart moved, and the outsiders he had recently contacted were those of the Li family.Is it true that this black scarf thief was actually invited by the Li family to kill himself?He was already very smart, and the other party spoke a little, and was guessed by him.He had long known that the Li family would not be willing to give up. He was still waiting for the Li family to go to the Ling family to make trouble. Who knows that nothing happened.Now he understands.Probably Li Xingyun's people did not report the truth, but wanted to quietly ask someone to solve themselves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The long knife in his hand contained true energy and he slashed towards Ling Xiao.However, with this kind of knife technique, Ling Xiao didn't even have to look at it.This time he was too lazy to use the hundred-step flying sword technique, and took a direct step, \"Xiang Yunbu\" rose, and the person immediately put it into the arms of the black scarf thief, and then punched out.The black scarf thief's heart directly popped a big bowl hole.\"You! You! How is it possible!\"The black-scarred thief who was killed was dying. It was also a triple martial art. How could the gap be so big?\\n\u3000\u3000 And at this time, about a few hundred meters away from here, a pair of eyes also revealed the color of panic.\"This child will not get rid of it, he will stay in trouble, this speed is terrible...\"This person is Li Xingyun.He thought that even if two black scarf thieves could not kill Ling Xiao, Ling Xiao could be seriously injured. By that time, he would be foolproof if he shot again.Who knows the result is far beyond his expectations.Ling Xiao's strength is not much worse than him, and the speed is far beyond him.Without relying on advanced martial arts, Li Xingyun can hardly give birth to the idea of \u200b\u200bworking against Ling Xiao.Ling Xiao glanced in that direction intentionally or unintentionally, smiled disdainfully, and then searched the bodies of two black scarf thieves.These two guys actually had two hundred and two silvers, and two breakthrough dans, which made money.Take these things out and put them directly in the mountain and river map. Ling Xiao lifted the bodies of the two people like a pig and took off, flying towards the Ling family.As soon as he arrived at the entrance of Ling's family, the former Ling family's children who were disdainful to Ling Xiao showed amazed eyes.\"Hey, isn't that the black scarf thief, it is said that the worst black scarf thief is the triple repair of Wumai!\"\\n\u3000\u3000 \"It shouldn't be that he killed, he has a double Wumai, eh? No, how did Ling Xiao break through the triple Wumai! This is too fast!\"\"Really, what's going on?\"These people are very clear, more than ten days ago, Ling Xiao was just a martial arts with a heavy martial art.At that time, anyone can bully Ling Xiao.However, this Ling Xiao is actually a martial art triple warrior.This entry is only swift and violent, it is really a bit stunned.\"There are rumors outside that Ling Xiao entered the Fulong Mountains a few days ago and happened to encounter a seriously injured Xiaoyue wolf, as well as herbs all over the ground.\"\"I also know that the Xiaoyue wolf seems to have been injured by Li's children led by Li Xingyun of the Li family. Unfortunately, the Li family died of three or four disciples. Even Li Rui died. When they went back to find helpers , It was cheap to be picked up by this kid.\"\"It's shameless!\"\"It's the scum of the Ling family!\"\"That is, if I have the materials from Xiaoyue Lang, plus those herbs, I can break through!\"\"It is estimated that this time two black scarf thieves are also cheap to pick up.\"\\n \"Definitely is!\"\u2026\u2026Hear the flies of these flies.Ling Xiao not only did not get angry, but showed a proud smile.Previously, no one would notice him, and he would only think of him when he was looking for someone to let off air.And today, these people's words are full of envy and envy, which makes him feel very glorious.Although what happened in the Fulong Mountains has been portrayed completely different, it would be good as long as the Li family did not come to trouble.Now he is just a ninth-family family, and the family said he would give up if he gave up.If you can achieve results in the annual comparison, or get a hundred points of merit, then you can get shelter from the Ling family.went to reward the good and punished evil hall and handed over the bodies of two black-scarred thieves, and received a reward of two hundred and two silver and twenty merit points.Lingxiao went directly to rent a house. In Lingjia, as long as you have money, it is actually very easy to rent a good house.Anyway, I only lived for a few months, and Ling Xiao simply rented a big house with a monthly rent of one hundred or two silver.\\n\u3000\u3000 There are all facilities inside.Training room, two large bedrooms, living room, yard, kitchen, and even two servants.handed over the silver and took the contract.Lingxiao returned to the original broken house. At this point, the construction team had already come and began to demolish the old house in preparation for reconstruction.This new house, Ling Xiao did not intend to make it too big. Anyway, he could not have lived here all the time. Besides, he and his grandfather were too big to clean.So it is enough to get two bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, and a practice room.But the material must be good.After discussing the matter of the house, Ling Xiao and his grandfather Hong Qi, with the help of those of the construction team, moved the things to the lease.After busy working all this, Ling Xiao re-entered the closed state. UU reading www.uukanshu.comThere is a special training room, which is better than the ordinary bedroom, at least safe, and will not be disturbed.Plus the training room will usually have a special structure, able to defend against strong shocks.Even a tens of thousands of kilograms of force cannot be broken, which gives Ling Xiao better practice conditions.\\n\u3000\u3000Closed his eyes, Ling Xiao first entered the mountains and rivers for a round of inspection.Herbs are growing very well now, and the cubs of several monster beasts are also living in a happy life, so Ling Xiao is a bit embarrassed to use them as medicine.\"Congratulations to your mountain and river map upgrade to level 3, get new cards-level 3 farmers, level 3 herders, level 3 craftsmen.\"\"Craftsman? This is a new profession.\"Ling Xiao was interested to open the artisan card and looked at the introduction. He couldn't help laughing.\"This is a group of omnipotent craftsmen. They can build all kinds of weapons, equipment and tools. As their level increases, their abilities will become stronger and stronger!\"\"Everything created by this group of craftsmen will have special properties, do you want to summon the craftsmen?\"\"Don't worry first.\"Lin Xiao now says that there are tens of thousands of silver on his body, and there is still a corpse of Xiaoyue wolf not sold, but it costs money to build a house.Plus he didn't think about what the craftsman should do, so I'll wait and talk.What he wants to do now is to practice \"Cow Magic\".He already has \"Red Sun Skills\", \"Bull Bull Power\", \"Meteor Fist\", \"Breaking Qi\", \"Returning Qi\", \"Tiger Steps Down the Mountain\", \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword\" and two other intermediate body skills It can be swallowed up.\\n\u3000\u3000 To what extent will this \"Bull Magic Gong\" improve?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The martial arts are invincible below the sixth level, and the martial arts are still invincible under the sixth Can dominate!\"\"Cultivation requirements: Three peaks of Wumai cultivation practice, strong qi, firm will, strong body, able to withstand qi and enter the body.\"\"Practice this skill, you can produce gang qi, you need to continue to practice to hone, to upgrade the realm still needs to constantly devour the exercises!\"\"This exercise can produce a strong sense of grief, and it can be integrated into an attack. Although it can't cause substantial damage, it can make the opponent tremble and will first have the upper hand in will.\"Seeing this, Ling Xiao couldn't help but get excited.Not to mention that simply being able to generate gang gas is enough to drive him crazy.Not to mention, this thing can not only generate gang qi, but also condensate qi, and physically and mentally destroy the opponent.This is so cruel.That is to say, even if his cultivation base can't break through the Wumai quadruple in a short time, simply relying on \"Niu Mogong Ningsha\" is enough to contend with the Wumai quadruple warrior.He thought that after swallowing it was only a level-up, but he didn't expect such a fundamental change.\\n\u3000\u3000 This \"Bull Magic Skill\" itself is a marvelous skill. It was previously characterized as intermediate martial arts, but in fact it is not much better than intermediate martial arts.After this integration and promotion, I am afraid that it is even more powerful than advanced martial arts. It is close to, and may even have reached the level of top martial arts.In other words, after the \"Ciyang Gong\" and \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\", which I have studied before, are exhibited using \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Ningsha\", wouldn't it be close, even reaching the level of top martial arts? ?\"Awesome martial arts?\"Just when Ling Xiao was excited about being able to get top martial arts, he suddenly found that some textual introductions appeared on the mountains and rivers.\"Top-level martial arts are the top-level existence of secular martial arts, but above the top-level, there are also extraordinary!\"\"Put through the nine martial arts, promote the martial arts nine heavy, but after the great completion of the martial arts nine, there are still extraordinary realm, extraordinary nine heavy, that is another new realm of martial arts!\"Such a thing, Ling Xiao is naturally not qualified to know, so he was very shocked to see the words on the mountain and river map.He always thought that Wumai Jiuzhong was the top of the warrior.He always thought that top martial arts is the best martial arts.But now it seems that there is an extraordinary state above the Wumai Jiuzhong.\\n\u3000\u3000On top martial arts there is also extraordinary martial arts.extraordinary state?Super martial arts?What kind of state is that, what kind of martial arts?The greater the strength, Ling Xiao found that his horizons became wider. Previously it was only limited to the Ling family, at most it was Tianfeng City.The most powerful master he can see, I am afraid that it is the people in these four families.Now, he suddenly understood that he was just sitting on a well and looking at the sky, the frog at the bottom of the well.It seems that you have to work hard!\u2026\u2026In the practice room, there is no day and no night, because there is no window, and the night pearl lighting is used.So Ling Xiao did not know what was going on outside. He had prepared dry food and told grandpa Hong Qi not to disturb him.\\n\u3000\u3000Because he wants to retreat.He wanted to comprehend the gang qi. In this case, he would be invincible if the martial arts were below threefold.Meeting the martial arts quadruple warrior, he also has the power to fight, at least the disadvantage is not so great.How can it be so easy to understand gang qi.Shanhe Wuhun can help him revise his cultivation methods, but he can't help him to realize the epiphany.All you need is epiphany.That's why so many warriors are talking about perception.He didn't know anything else, but there were countless warriors in the Tianfeng City. Even the warriors at the triple peak of the Wumai, there were thousands of Guangling families, and the remaining three big families, and some small families added together.It is estimated that the total number exceeds 10,000.There are so many martial arts triple peak warriors, but there are not many warriors who can really break through to the martial arts quadruple, realize the true gasification, and condense the gas.Most people stay in the triple peak state of Wumai all their lives and cannot break through.\\n\u3000\u3000This is why geniuses like Ling Tie Shou, Ling Feng, Ling Yixue, and Li Xingyun, who are also the triple peak martial arts of the Wumai, have high hopes.They have high perception and young age, and the possibility of natural breakthrough will be very high.Even so, these people stayed at this stage for the shortest period of a few months, the longest or even a few years, and there was no breakthrough.Ling Xiao wants to break through in a few hours, this face is a bit too ignorant of true gasification.He has a good habit, that is, when one thing can not go on, he will not drill the horns.will choose to start from other aspects.\"Niu Mogong\" has been promoted to \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Ningsha\", so can \"Xiang Yunbu\" also be promoted?If \"Xiang Yunbu\" is promoted to ~www.novelbuddy.com~, will it provide more possibilities for condensing qi?Thinking of this, he no longer hesitated.Choose the rest of the intermediate body skills from the exercises to start practicing.Anyway, this time he retired, he planned to wait until the day before the beginning of the year than the beginning of the customs retreat. Since he could not condense the qi, improving \"Xiang Yunbu\" can also improve the combat ability.\\n\u3000\u3000 Blood is very important for a warrior.But calmness is equally important for a warrior.One hour later, his \"Xiang Yunbu\" once again broke through, reaching three steps.He tried to condense the qi, but still failed, but he had a hint of epiphany.So, he continued to promote \"Xiang Yunbu\".After two hours, \"Xiang Yunbu\" broke through to four steps.He tried again to condense the qi, and finally ended in failure, but in the process, he obviously found that there was a trace of true qi in his body that seemed to reach the level of qi.is just unable to consolidate.This shows that the strength is not enough.also explained that the promotion of \"Xiang Yunbu\" is indeed helpful for condensing the qi.carry on!\\n\u3000\u3000 He was not prepared to give up, and he never gave up when his strength stayed in Wumai.Now that his strength has improved so fast, he will never give up.After three hours, \"Xiang Yunbu\" broke through again, reaching five steps.After four hours, \"Xiang Yunbu\" reached six steps.It was at this time that a qualitative change finally occurred in the real \"Xiang Yunbu\" in the mountains and rivers.changed its name to \"Xiang Yunbu\u00b7Hua Jiao\".of course followed, and the introduction has changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 Xiangyun HuajiaoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"...\"Xiang Yunbu\u00b7Jiao Jiao\", a top-level body technique condensed by dozens of body styles, with Qigong \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Ning Sha\" will have a magical effect. The following body styles are unprecedented, and the martial arts below the nineth level are still top-level body styles.\"\"It needs to be based on advanced body skills to continue to improve.\"\"If it cooperates with Gang, it can even produce an attack effect.\"As expected, after the \"Xiang Yunbu\" reached the sixth level, qualitative changes also occurred, and it seems that there is some special connection with \"Bull Magic Gong\".Now it seems that \"Xiang Yunbu\" and \"Bull Magic Gong\" are not separate exercises, they also complement each other.Gangqi!must immediately understand the gang!Whether it's \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Ningsha\" or \"Xiangyunbu\u00b7Hua Jiao\", you need qi to be able to exert real effects.However, when he closed his eyes again to comprehend the qi, he clearly turned the true qi in the three martial arts into gang qi.But in the end that he was about to succeed, he fell short of success.\\n\u3000\u3000 All the qi ceased to spread again, and turned back to true qi.Ling Xiao is very puzzled.He sat there thinking for a while, and simply stood up.I can't figure it out by myself, so I have to ask someone who understands qi.He is a disciple of Ling family after all, I believe that Ling family will not ignore him.After all, the Lin family is big, and there are all kinds of birds. People like Ling Chong may not be like that. For example, the teacher in the medicine hall is very good.Thinking of this, he gave up the idea of \u200b\u200bcontinuing to retreat.Then came out of the practice room.At this time, I saw Grandpa Hong Qi standing and walking around, as if he was very anxious.\"What's wrong, Grandpa? What happened again?\"Ling Xiao asked suspiciously.\"Do you have to go out of school? This is the case. The teacher from your pharmacy just came over to drink tea with grandpa and told me one thing.\"\\n\u3000\u3000Hong Qi said, \"Tomorrow, Mr. Ling will go out of the border, and all the disciples will welcome him.\"\"Must go?\" Ling Xiao frowned.To be honest, he didn't want to join in the excitement.There are so many disciples of the Ling family, even if he goes, what can he do if he can recognize him?\"That's not true, but your teacher said that every time Master Ling leaves the border, he will instruct the disciples' practice, even if it's just a word, it's enough to benefit the disciples!\"Hong Qi explained: \"More importantly, if Master Ling Ling fancy and accepted as a disciple, then this status would be high.\"\"It seems that I really have to go!\"said that Ling Xiao did not want to be a disciple of Mr. Ling, it was lying.After all, Mr. Ling is the strongest of the Ling family. He is not clear about his specific strength, but he is definitely more powerful than others.More importantly, if he becomes his disciple, will there be any problems with future resources?After getting Mr. Ling's instructions, many things may become easier.And even if you can\u2019t become a disciple of Grandpa Ling, if you can get a trace of enlightenment from Grandpa Ling\u2019s instructions, that would be great.\\n \"I go!\"Ling Xiao nodded and said, \"When will you go out?\"\"Hurry up now, it is estimated that I will be out of the customs soon.\"Hong Qi was anxious because the time was too tight.After hearing Xiao Ling, without saying a word, he turned and left the courtyard. The speed was so fast that he surprised Hong Qi.At this time, there were many disciples gathered in the square outside the retreat place of Mr. Ling.In addition to disciples like Ling Xiao, there are also top disciples in Elite Hall and Talent Hall.The disciples of Tiancaitang usually perform tasks outside this time, so only two or three came, which just happened.Most of the rest are elite disciples and disciples.The top ten masters of the elite hall are here.This is a very rare scene.\"Huh, it's hilarious today. Although the two monsters from the Genius Hall are all ranked around 100, they are all four disciples who understand the martial arts of Gang Qi.\"\\n\"We can\u2019t compare those monsters, but the elite hall\u2019s disciples can catch up. See it. Ling Yixue, currently ranked second, has just defeated the third place, and Ling Feng, who has been promoted to third place in the elite hall, is here. !\"\"It was Ling Cheng who was defeated, he also came, and seems to be ranked sixth!\"Although the disciples present envy the monsters in Tiancaitang, the monsters are hard to catch up with.So they talked the most, but instead they were the top ten disciples in Elite Hall.At least there is still some hope for catching up.There are thousands of elite disciples in the elite hall.disciples who are not influential are countless, and they are all disciples under Wumai.Ling Xiao was in the past when intelligence was the bottom of disciples who were not influential.So in fact, people mocked him at that time and looked down on him, which is really normal.Of course, few people are paying attention to him now. After all, the fact that he broke through the threefold of Wumai is not known to anyone.For a person who has double training in martial arts, there is really no need to care too much.If you can't enter the top ten of the elite hall, it is not easy to have fans.\\n\u3000\u3000 Among the top ten disciples in the elite hall, Ling Yixue is the only female disciple.Plus her own natural beauty and terrible strength, so naturally it is a concern.\"Ling Yihang is here!\"\"Ling Yihang! Is it currently the chief disciple of Elite Club? Ling Yihang, who is more powerful than Ling Yixue?\"\"Yes, it is him! This man is awesome, originally came in through the assessment, and changed his surname to Ling, but now he has become the chief disciple of the elite hall, it is a model for my generation!\"The cry of exclamation sounded.Everyone's attention was drawn to the past.including the monsters in Tiancaidang, also looked at them one after another.Because the chief disciple of Elite Hall, it is very likely to be promoted to Tiancai Hall and become a little monster. UU reading www.uukanshu.com may be their opponent in the future.Ling Xiao also followed the eyes of everyone.In the eyes, is a plainly dressed male disciple.Seeing his age, he should be two or three years older than him, with a simple and simple smile on his face.\\n\u3000\u3000 This is completely different from the high-spirited expressions of the Ling family disciples.\"Good guy, deserved to be the chief disciple of the elite hall. His appearance looks honest and honest, but there is a beast hidden in his body. Whoever looks down on this guy will definitely suffer a big loss!\"Ling Xiao has long heard of Ling Yihang, but before, he was not qualified to speak with Ling Yihang.Therefore, in order to prevent self-infliction, he has always kept a distance from the disciples of these elite halls.is officially recognized today.This is indeed a rival.At least in his opinion, this Ling Yihang is definitely more difficult to deal with than Ling Feng and Ling Fei.The appearance of Ling Yihang not only attracted Ling Xiao's attention.Including Ling Yixue, Ling Feng, Ling Yun, Ling Cheng, and Ling Tie Shou, who tried to challenge the top ten of the chief disciples, all showed strong fighting intentions.Chief disciple of Elite Hall.This is not just a glorious name.is a real benefit.\\n\u3000\u3000 In training, you will get many unexpected benefits.Everyone wants this seat, but not many people are really qualified to challenge.Inside the elite hall, the top ten disciples may have the power to fight, but it can really pose a threat to Ling Yihang, it is estimated that it is the top five.Of course, Ling Xiao is an exception. He doesn't want to reveal too much strength for the time being.\"Look!! Ling Tie, who has just been promoted to the fourth place, is here!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Isn't that Ling Chong?Is this Ling Tie's hand the cousin of Ling Chong?\\nLing Xiao knew that Ling Chong had a terrible cousin, but he had never seen it.However, at this time, seeing Ling Chong followed Ling Tie's hands like a follower, if he could not guess who this person was, he would be too stupid.Ling Xiao saw Ling Chong.Ling Chong also saw Ling Xiao.\"Ling Xiao! I didn't expect you to dare to show up!\"When Ling Chong saw Ling Xiao, his anger couldn't help himself, and he roared at Ling Xiao.His roar attracted many people's eyes.\"Joke, I'm a disciple of the Ling family, and Mr. Ling is out of the border. Why don't I dare show up?\"Ling Xiao said disdainfully.\"Cousin, it was this **** who hurt me with despicable means!\"Ling Chong originally wanted to rush over, but when he thought of losing to Ling Xiao two times at the beginning, he instantly lost his nerve and said to Ling Tie, who was on the side.\"Oh, Your Excellency is Brother Ling Xiao!\"\\nLing Tie's hand showed a disdainful smile, and then lifted his foot to Ling Xiao.\"Brother Iron Hand!\"Ling Xiao Gongdao.\"Hey, Ling Xiao has been very lively these days, but when he met Ling Tie, he was as good as his grandson.\"\"That's right, this guy picked up a bargain in the Fulong Mountain Range, which made our Lings have no face, and their good reputation didn't spread.

He just knelt down and apologized. It is estimated that Ling Tie's hands will not spare him. After all, Ling Chong was so miserable.\"...There was a lot of talk in the crowd.Generally, I don't see Ling Xiao very much.\\nIn the end, I still can't look down on Ling Xiao's strength.At this time, even the top ten disciples in the elite hall noticed the situation here.Ling Tie's hand is not Ling Chong. He is now ranked fourth in the elite hall. If Ling Xiao can beat Ling Tie's hand, that is simply impossible.No one will believe it.So more people are gloating.There are also some people who have nothing to do with themselves and just look lively.The number one Ling Yihang seemed indifferent to the battle, meditating there with his eyes closed.Ling Yixue was obviously a little worried about Ling Xiao.And Ling Feng, ranked third, showed an expression of gloating.Ling Ting is too clear about Ling Tie's hands. Even he, he dare not say that he can win.As for Ling Xiao, how is that possible?Ling Yu, who was standing beside Ling Feng, actually clapped and smiled and said, \"Hee hee, this Xiao Xiao broke through the double of Wu Mai by picking up cheap, and it is not arrogant. Today, someone can finally teach this little beggar.\"\\nShe may be the one who least wants Ling Xiao to rise.Otherwise, she said nothing on her face. When she thought of bullying Ling Xiao once, she was afraid that Ling Xiao would retaliate.\"Hey, Ling Xiao, aren't you great? How come you are so obedient today? Are you afraid?\"Ling Chong said with a smile: \"Unfortunately, unfortunately, my cousin is here today, and your kid's day is over.\"\"Senior brother, as the so-called friend should be settled or not settled, it is better to kneel down and apologize, this matter will be over.\"Ling Tie walked in front of Ling Xiao, and suddenly a momentum was suddenly released, so that several disciples around Ling Xiao could not help but step back a few steps, for fear of being affected.kneel down? apologize?Everyone can hear that Ling Tie is exerting pressure.It's really insulting to let a person kneel down and apologize.What will Ling Xiao do?Did you listen to Ling Tie?Still ready to be beaten?\\n\"Senior brother, you are right. It is the so-called friend that should be resolved and not settled. If Ling Chong is willing to kneel down and apologize to me, I should not have happened today.\"Ling Xiao smiled in a hurry. Suddenly, there was also a surge of momentum. The true qi of Wumai Triple was circulated in the body, as if suddenly a person had changed.\"Ling Xiao is looking for death! Hmm? No, how did he break through the Wumai triple!\"Ling Feng was about to ridicule Ling Xiao for not knowing his life or death, but suddenly felt Ling Xiao's powerful momentum and could not help changing his face.Ling Yu, who was standing beside him, even shivered.too fast! too frightening!How is this practiced!\"Oh, no wonder it's so bold, it turned out to be a breakthrough, but don't this kid understand, even if they are all three-line martial arts, there is a big gap between people and people.\"Ling Feng seemed overwhelmed, so he found an excuse to comfort himself.\"Brother Ling Feng said this is good, both the actual combat experience and the accumulation of true energy are important, and the level of martial arts!

He was afraid that Ling Xiao would come over to find his trouble. At that time, no one here could help him.\"Relax, I generally have no interest in waste!\"Ling Xiao looked at Ling Chong kneeling on the ground disdainfully. This man who used to bully and humiliate himself almost every day now kneeled in front of him.\\nHe was extremely proud and excited.Sure enough, his dignity can be recovered.\"Waste?\"Ling Chong felt bitterness in his heart. He thought that he often said these two words to Ling Xiao himself.Now it is reversed.\"Brother Feng, what should I do, he won! He actually won Ling Tie's hand, he will definitely come to me for revenge...\"Ling Yu hadn't looked like a proud princess long ago, and she was trembling all over, and her eyes were full of fear.Although Ling Xiao didn't even look at her at all, she was still terrified.This is probably the so-called guilty conscience.\"Humph, that's Ling Tie's own stupidity.\"Ling Feng was also a little nervous in his expression, but he could always find a reason to comfort himself.\"If it weren't for Ling Tie's force to use the instant-strike secret method, it would have exhausted the true energy, and the last loser would definitely be that Ling Xiao, Sister Rain, you don't need to be afraid, I will soon understand the trick of turning qi into gang, waiting for condensing Gang, you can kill him in one move!\"\\n\"Yeah! Brother Feng, you are right, he is also a man of great strength, and he has almost no attack.\"Hearing Ling Feng's words, Ling Yu was relieved, and his hands clasped Ling Feng's arm tightly.All she can rely on now is Ling Feng.If Ling Feng is not Ling Xiao's opponent, then she really has no backing.Ling Yihang, who had always closed his eyes, suddenly opened his eyes, and a smile appeared slightly in the corner of his mouth, and said lightly: \"Yixue, you and I are afraid of meeting a real challenger.\"In his eyesight, only Ling Yixue was qualified to challenge him in the entire elite hall.Now there is another Ling Xiao suspected of possibly challenging him.\"Brother, you're too polite, I'm far worse than you, but this Lingxiao is really progressing fast. If he can master the method of turning qi into gang, he will really be able to threaten you, brother.\"Ling Yixue's eyes flashed.She knew that Ling Yihang was the only disciple in the entire elite hall who had mastered the qi....\"Master Ling is out!\"\\nJust when everyone was talking about it, and they were all inexplicably surprised at Ling Xiao's strengthening, a voice rang out.The noise stopped immediately.Everyone's attention was put forward.That's where Mr. Ling closed.boom!A strong breath spit out from behind the stone gate, and a sturdy old man wearing a coarse cloth and a strong outfit walked out of the stone room.He is obviously sixty or seventy years old, but he walks on the road but is not like the old man.\"Is this Mr. Ling, one of the four masters of Tianfeng City! The patriarch of the Ling family!\"Ling Xiao was also excited.He looked up and saw that Wu Wu Shan Shanhe suddenly turned around, attempting to see through Mr. Ling's cultivation behavior.However, in the display, it was like a blade of strength.The difference in strength is too great, and Wu Wushun cannot analyze the information of Mr. Ling.\\nLing Ling's real name is Ling Xiaotian.At that time, one person went into the lair of the black scarf thief alone, strangling hundreds of black scarf thieves and killing a black scarf thief leader.So far, this story is still circulating in Tianfeng City.The black scarf thief hated Ling Xiaotian, but he dared not come to move the Ling family because of his existence.Ling Xiaotian's eyes suddenly looked at the audience.This momentum forced many disciples to kneel on the ground suddenly, and the body could not control it at all. The invisible momentum of this force was really terrifying.Of course, there are a few people standing there.The two people who came from Tiancai Tang still had smiles on their faces. This momentum, they had already been taught, as long as they had qi in their bodies, they would not be affected.Master Ling is trying to test the strength of his disciples.There are four others standing.One Ling Yihang, his face pale.A Ling Yixue, frowning slightly.\\nA Ling Feng, leaning on the ground with a long sword, then controlled his body.The other is Ling Xiao. When he felt that his body was about to bear, the coercion was easily resolved by Shan Wu Wu Hun.So he seemed even more relaxed than Ling Yixue.\"It's amazing!\"\"Is this the strength of the strongest person in Tianfeng City, when will we reach his level.\"\"Don't think about it, Grandpa Ling's strength is not so easy to achieve.\"\"Let's honestly condense the gas first.\"Although kneeling on the ground, the disciples were not dissatisfied, but full of yearning and expectation.Full of awe and admiration.The quadruple martial arts, the stage of qi, and the title of martial arts are the dreams of countless warriors in the Northern Han Dynasty and the whole world.Once, this expectation was nothing but Ling Xiao's dream.But now, after learning that Wumai Jiuzhong actually has extraordinary Jiuzhong.\\nHis mentality has changed dramatically, and his horizons have become wider.Wumai's fourfold is just a springboard for him, a short-term goal.His dream now is to enter the extraordinary realm.\"Your disciples this year are the worst that the husband has ever seen!\"Ling Xiaotian suddenly spoke.\"Hey, this is the old man again.\"The two disciples in Tiancaitang couldn't help laughing.\"Yeah, we said that at that time. In fact, this session is really amazing. There are actually four people who have withstood the pressure of his old man.\"\"Yes, the old man is actually very happy.\"As they were saying, they suddenly felt the gaze from Ling Xiaotian's warning, hurriedly spit out their tongues, and quickly closed their mouths.Ling Xiaotian continued: \"As everyone knows, Wumai Jiuzhong can be divided into three stages-the awakening stage, the ganglion stage, and the blasting stage! You can get the title of Wusheng, Wufu, Wushi!\"Although his voice is not loud, but its penetrating power is very strong, even if it is hundreds of meters away from UU reading www.uukanshu.com, it can be heard clearly.\\nLing Ling's words can only be regarded as common sense, but all the children of the Ling family, as long as they practice martial arts, know it.[Awakening stage]: Mainly to exercise the body, condense the true energy, and lay a solid foundation in order to practice stronger martial arts.[Gang stage]: The true qi has condensed to a certain degree, and the body can no longer accommodate it. At this time, it is necessary to condense the true qi and turn it into gang qi, which is more pure, and can hurt people from the air Far more than true gas.[Explosion stage]: Although there is no fundamental change in the energy in the body, it is still qi, but the qi reserves at this time are far from comparable before. At this time, the focus is on training, the more powerful martial arts, the qi moment When an attack breaks out, one person can easily resist ten thousand people, and it is possible to destroy a village with one punch.It is recorded in many books that the warrior at the pinnacle of Wumai Jiuzhong often used one person against the enemy alone, and it was normal to kill 10,000 people easily.Once cultivated to this state, basically in the eyes of secular warriors, it is already invincible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Not only did she shame herself and defeated Ling Tie, making everyone dare not look down upon him, but she could also get a reward from Mr. Ling.This is really wonderful.\"Pick it up!\"Ling Xiaotian suddenly screamed, and his body shot a countless amount of white light, and then fell into the body of all the children of the Ling family at the scene.\"This is a trace of qi in the old man's body. Smart people can use it to comprehend qi, stupid, and can also strengthen the body through this qi. Anyway, it is only good for you, no harm.\"After words, Ling Xiaotian turned and left.\\n\"Old ancestors, why do you bother? It is not worth it to spend so much for those disciples.\"\"Nothing is not worth it, but I feel that there are a few good students in this class of disciples, who originally wanted to accept them as disciples, but there are other things to do now, I am afraid there is no time to teach, give them a little benefit , I hope they can be promoted successfully.\"\"Do you mean that Ling Yihang? Or Ling Yixue?\"\"These two are indeed talents, but...\" Ling Xiaotian smiled, not knowing whether it was intentional or unintentional, his eyes swept across Ling Xiao's body.Then he laughed and walked away.\"The annual Dabby is about to start, maybe there will be surprises this year.\"Ling Xiao looked at the trace of qi in her body in surprise.This is what he lacks most now.With the analytical ability of Shan Wu Wu Hun, he can completely analyze the generation process of this gangue gas.Although it was impossible to analyze the strength of Master Ling, there was no problem with his trace of anger.Ling Yihang left, with an unpredictable smile on his face.Ling Yixue also drifted away, both looking forward and anxious.\\nLing Feng couldn't wait to leave with Ling Yu, his face was ecstatic.Ling Tie's hand also left. When he left, he touched his body, which was where the trace of qi was, and then looked at Ling Xiao again.\"Ling Xiao, today's shame, it will definitely be washed away!\"Of course, most of the disciples are still ignorant, and they don\u2019t understand the use of this lingering gas that Mr. Ling gave them.Some people even murmured secretly that Master Ling was really stingy this time.Ling Xiao shook his head, feeling that these people were really in the blessings and did not know the blessings.He also turned around and returned to his home. After speaking to grandpa Hong Qi, he entered the practice room again.analysis!Mountain and river martial arts are running, and they begin to analyze Ling Xiaotian's lingering qi!After about an hour.The expression of ecstasy appeared on Ling Xiao's face.The entire process from the generation to the growth of this silk gang gas has been clearly analyzed by Wu Wu Shanshan and the images have been made.\\n\"Now that the analysis is done, it's time to condense yourself!\"Ling Xiao smiled a little, and then directly run \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Ningsha\", and began to transform the true Qi in the body into Ling Qi according to Ling Xiaotian's method.It was a bit slow at first, but as he became more and more proficient in this process, his rate of turning gas into gang became faster and faster.His accumulation is long enough.Staying in the Wumai stage for such a long period of time, true qi has long flooded all corners of the body and even the cells.He could feel that when Ling Xiaotian's method was used to turn gas into gang, the source of real gas kept pouring out. This kind of reserves was probably among the most muscular among the warriors under the triple martial arts.It is estimated that Ling Yihang can compare with him.The process of turning gas into gang is very smooth, almost natural.This is mainly because he has tried many times before, and although he failed in the end, he has accumulated experience after all.This time, through the understanding and analysis of Ling Xiaotian's silky qi, the process became more reasonable.However, the moment when all the true qi condensed into gang qi, he suddenly felt a crisis.Gangqi is not the same as true qi.\\nTrue energy is gentle and soft.Gangqi is violent and fierce.His body seemed to be torn apart by these gangles, and the pain was unbearable.\"Bah!\"\"Bah!\"\"Snapped!\"Every one of his wounds split open and blood spewed out. If anyone saw it, it would be terrified.\"No, you must die like this!\"Ling Xiao suddenly understood that the reason why he did this might be because the Qi in his body was too thick, so the amount of qi after it became naturally was much stronger than the average person.The Wuqi triple warrior can withstand the limit of qi, and he, obviously, has exceeded the limit.Unexpectedly, the true energy is too thick, it is also a trouble.Ling Xiao smiled bitterly.\\nBut the matter has come to this point, of course he will not complain about himself.I took out Jin Chuang Yao and Healing Pill directly from the mountain and river map, and then used it like no money.over and over again.In half an hour.After experiencing a period of pain that is not as good as death, almost all the gold medicines and healing wounds have been used up.He finally felt that the irritability was tamed by him.There seemed to be a beast roaring inside.It's just that this beast can be controlled by him.what!Ling Xiao suddenly stood up, and roared loudly, bursting with countless blood-red strength in his body, and cracked the surrounding walls.If it were not a training room, I am afraid that these walls would have been directly collapsed.The red energy is the situation where the congestion in the body is forced out by the qi.\\nIf you let the congestion stay in your body, it won't be a good thing.\"Hahaha, I succeeded! I finally succeeded and turned Qi into gang! I have turned all the true qi of a martial art into gang Qi!\"Ling Xiao was very excited.Although it only succeeded in turning one Wumai into Qi, but with this success, the next two Wumai are simple.He believes that as long as he condenses the true qi of the three martial arts into gang qi, he can successfully break through to the fourfold of the martial arts.It doesn't even need any external assistance.He was very excited, because dreams that were once out of reach are now so simple.He used to think that as long as he can condense his qi at this life ~www.novelbuddy.com~ will be satisfied.But now, he can have a higher dream.What gasification is for is nothing more than a small beginning.His left hand spread out, it was a soft breath, just like the steam after boiling the water, this is true gas.His right hand spread out. It was a compact and like a small tornado. Not only that, every breath seemed like a sharp blade, and it was powerful at first glance.\\nThis is gang qi.Although true qi and gang qi are both energy produced in the human body, they are far from each other.Previously, among the disciples below the elite hall, only Ling Yihang understood the qi.And now, there is one more person, that is his Ling Xiao!He who possesses qi is bound to shine on the day of the annual competition.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 Generous rewardsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?The first Wumai Huaqi is the success of Gang, which provides Ling Xiao with valuable experience.So when condensing the second martial arts, the process becomes smoother and smoother.Three more hours passed, not only did he condense the second martial arts successfully, but the qi of the first martial arts also completely stabilized.By the third martial arts, I encountered a little problem.Because the third martial art to turn qi into gang once succeeds, it means that it will break through the fourfold of martial arts.So the difficulty has increased a lot.\"It just happens that Xiaoyue Lang is not useful. It shouldn't be a problem to exchange it for a few gangqi pill. It will definitely become easier by then.\"Ling Xiao is not a person who likes to be horny. After all, he is getting closer and closer to the annual big ratio, and his strength is increased by one point. The more confident he is in getting the ranking.\\nNow, there is not much gain in dull practice. Gang Qi Dan is a must.This qi qi is much more expensive than the breakthrough dan and the qi qi dan, and it is generally used by warriors who condense the qi.Moreover, the refining material must also have a level 4 or higher, and possess a monstrous monster.He is just right now.Thinking of this, he got up and walked out of the exercise room.But when I was about to go out, I suddenly thought of a problem.Now that I have succeeded in turning my gas into a gang, this is the biggest card of the year and I can't easily expose it.Something has to be done to cover up the qi.As soon as his thoughts moved, Wu Wu Shanhe responded.A list is shown in the mountain and river chart. The list contains templates that need to be displayed to others.From Wumai 1st to Wumai 9th.\\nLing Xiao couldn't help but feel happy. In this way, he didn't have to worry about being seen by others.Unexpectedly, Shan Wu Wu Hun actually has such intimate effects.After thinking for a while, he chose the Wumai triple, non-gangue template.He is now the triple peak of Wumai, a warrior with two Wumai gang qi.But the strength in front of outsiders is much lower. In this way, you can cheat a lot of people. At the critical time, it will certainly work wonders.You know, in the world of warriors, it is very difficult to be able to hide your strength.Although there are many martial arts with hidden strength, it is not easy to practice, and the effect is very limited.But the warrior template that comes with Wuhe Soul of the Mountain and River doesn't have to worry about it at all.No need to practice, only need to choose, it shows that the template wants you to show the strength to outsiders.And as the level of mountain and river maps continues to increase, the hiding effect will become better and better.Generally speaking, it is the warrior who can conceal the strength higher than the four realms of Ling Xiao.\\nFor example, if he is now Wumai triple peak strength, then the warrior below Wumai seventh heavy peak cannot see the true strength behind his template.This is more than enough.After adjusting the template, Ling Xiao went to the medicine hall.Sure enough, the teacher in the pharmacy didn't really see that he had condensed qi.You should know that this teacher's worst strength should also be about Wumai Sixfold.He couldn't see it, and certainly no disciples of Elite Hall could see it.\"Gang Dan is out of stock, and it will take a few days to refine it.\"\"No problem Master, how many gangqi can this Xiaoyue wolf be exchanged for?\"\"It's probably three or four at most, you know, one gang of pill Dan Shao said it would cost ten thousand or two silver.\"\"Yes, then there will be Master Labor, and I will pick it up in a few days.\"Ling Xiao knows that it is useless to be anxious. It seems that he can only participate in the annual Big Than first. With his current strength, it is not a problem to break into the top five.\\nAfter leaving the medicine hall, Ling Xiao went back to consolidate his cultivation.Until one day later, I received the registration notice for the annual Dabi.\"I can't think of a child. At that time, Grandpa was still worried about whether you were eligible to participate in this year's annual competition. After all, this year's competition needs to be more than two times. \"Hong Qi looked at Ling Xiao with excitement.This child grew up watching him, and now he is getting more and more prosperous, he is naturally happy.\"Relax, grandpa, this time I will definitely get the ranking.\"\"Don't put too much pressure on yourself. After all, there are a lot of disciples in Wumai Triple, as long as they can successfully become elite hall disciples. As long as they enter the elite hall, there will be hope in the future.\"Hong Qi is always unwilling to put too much pressure on Ling Xiao.\"Grandpa, I won't be reconciled without taking the top three this time.\"Ling Xiao put out her tongue, made a grimace, and then ran away.This is his real thought. Ling Yixue and Ling Yihang's strength is a bit of a mystery. He dare not say a steady win, but others, he is really not afraid.\\nIf you have gang qi, and the strength reaches the triple peak of Wumai and you can't pick up a guy like Ling Feng, it is really a shame.There are quite a few disciples who come to participate in the annual Dabi. It is estimated that there are not tens of thousands but there are thousands. All of them are martial arts with more than two martial arts.When Ling Xiao arrived at the registration office, it was already crowded, and many people stood there talking about it.There are excited expressions on his face.This year's Big Than is arguably the best opportunity for a disciple Lei Yue Yue Longmen.If you can get a place in the annual comparison, then you have the same opportunities as your children.\"Hey, because the Ling family expanded its staff last year, the number of participants in this year's annual competition is much better than in the past!\"\"The number is large, but the rewards are more abundant.\"\"Has the rewards been announced, how come I don't know?\"\"Stupid, Senior Brother Ming is a disciple of Tiancaitang. This time it's a specially invited judge. Naturally I know the reward.\"Brother Ming?\\nGenius Hall disciple?Ling Xiao got a lot closer, and he also wanted to know what kind of rewards this year's Dabie will have.After all, this is about his future.The disciples of Tiancaitang are generally under the age of twenty. They are cultivated as warriors who reach the peak of the triple martial arts and condense their qi.Obviously, this brother Ming is such a person.The disciples of the elite hall are disciples under the age of 20, who have attained triple martial arts.Generally speaking, the worst disciples in the Genius Hall are also stronger than the best disciples in the Elite Hall.However, individual monsters often appear in the elite hall.For example, a guy like Ling Yihang.\"Brother Ming, what is the reward of UU reading www.uukanshu.com, let us breathe it.\"The Senior Brother Ming smiled and said: \"This time, the elite hall annual competition, who can enter the top 100, can get a hundred Qi Qidan reward!\"\\n\"If you enter the top 50, you can enter the third floor of the bookstore and choose an advanced martial arts! And get an additional breakthrough pill, a heart protection pill, and a pulse protection pill!\"\"In the top 20, in addition to the previous rewards, you can increase the chance to choose an advanced martial arts. Breakthrough Dan, Huxin Dan and Humai Dan will all add another one!\"Hearing this, many people could not restrain their excitement.\"It's too extravagant, you can get a hundred Qiqidan just by entering the top 100!\"\"It would be better if I could enter the top 20, two sets of advanced martial arts, two sets of breakthrough medicine!\"\"Yeah, these are treasures that many elite halls and disciples don't dare to dream about.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It's really too slow to grow, tell you, as long as you can get into the top three, you can not only get all the rewards in the front, but also get a top martial arts and a reward. Gang Qi Dan!\"\"Hey! Actually reward top martial arts!\"\"There is that gangqi pill, each one worth two thousand silver?\"Brother Ming's remarks made many people cry out in amazement.What does top martial art mean?Means the best martial art in the world!For disciples who do not yet know the extraordinary state and the martial arts, top martial arts is the best reward!As for the Gangqi Pill, it is the best panacea in the Gangqi stage that must be made with the blood of the fourth-level monster as the material, and other materials can be added.\\nUnder five weights, it is absolutely superb.Why does Ling Xiao want Gang Qi Dan? Just want to use it to break through to the fourfold of Wumai.Unexpectedly, this year's Big Than actually had such a reward.Well, this kind of thing is more beneficial, and it can still be used after breaking through the four layers of martial arts.As for the top martial arts, that's not to mention, absolutely no one is rare.\"The reward for the second place is similar to the third place, but there is one more reward for Gang Qidan!\"\"What about the first place? There must be a big surprise in the first place?\"\"To be honest, in addition to all the previous rewards, there is also a mysterious reward for the first place. I don't even know it. It is said that Mr. Ling will announce it personally at that time. It is a suspense.\"Brother Ming shrugged.\"How is that!\"\"Yeah, it's so appetizing!\"Everyone watching was a little crazy.Not to mention them, Ling Xiao felt a little itchy in his heart.\\nThe other rewards are already so good, this mysterious reward is certainly not too bad.\"next!\"When it was Ling Xiao's turn to sign up, he shook his head and shook out the confusion in his heart.If you don\u2019t want to think about it first, let\u2019s take part in this annual competition, as long as you can get the ranking, then you will naturally know what the reward is.\"9588!\"This is the number plate that Ling Xiao got.There is no way, because he is late because of his practice, so this number plate is very intelligent.But it doesn't matter. Anyway, it will be the same qualification to participate in the knockout.But this number plate surprised Ling Xiao. Although he arrived late, he actually got the 9588 number plate. This shows that there are at least 9,000 people participating in the Dabi, nearly 10,000!As I said before, disciples in the elite hall and the genius hall are age-restricted. They must be under the age of twenty. If they reach the age of twenty, they will have another appointment and no longer stay in the hall.But even so, there are still so many people, which is really a bit surprising.However, most of these people are non-influential disciples, and can also be said to be the bottom disciples.Because the number of elite disciples has been kept at about 1,000.\\nIn other words, you can only become an elite disciple if you are ranked in the top 1,000, otherwise you will be kicked back to the bottom disciples.It is not too fierce for nearly 10,000 people to compete for the 1,000 places.And even if you join the elite hall, you need to squeeze into the top 100 at least to get better treatment.This competition is even more intense.As for the Talent Hall, it is even more terrifying.Because the total number of disciples in Tiancaitang is only one hundred!Don't need one more.If someone is promoted to the Genius Hall, then someone must be sent back to the elite hall.This is the brutal competition for the survival of the fittest, and there is no chance for coincidence.On the competition square, there is a huge stone wall with 200 brands hanging on it.The name is written on the sign.This is the ranking of the Genius Hall, the Elite Hall and the disciples at the bottom.After each year's annual comparison, these brands will change. Not only the order will change, but even the brands may be replaced.\\nThe annual ratio is mainly divided into two parts.One part is the contest between the elite hall and the disciples, and the top ten finalists are qualified to challenge the genius hall disciples.And there will be a competition between the disciples of the genius hall, and finally re-rank.Therefore, the reward mentioned by the older brother Ming was not the first in the elite hall, but the first including the disciples of the genius hall!Above the stone wall, the brand hanging on the first position is very eye-catching because it is a brand made of pure gold.The name above is impressive-Ling Feifan!One of the four sons of Tianfeng City, the best among the disciples of the Ling family under the age of 20.I thought that when he was at Lingxiao's age, he had already broken through the fourfold of Wumai.It is definitely a rare genius!No one can shake his position for three years since he became No. 1 on the leaderboard.This guy is definitely the first genius of the well-deserved Ling family.Of course, this year may not be necessary.The second place is a brand made of silver, also very eye-catching, a disciple named Ling Yun.\\nThe third place is a brand made of bronze, which is also more eye-catching. This is actually a girl named Ling Shuang.The fourth to the 200th places are all wooden brands, and they all look similar.Ling Xiao took a closer look, and the top ten were occupied by the disciples of Tiancaitang.This eleventh place is Ling Yihang, the elite hall first.This made him a little surprised. It seems that Ling Yihang should have dealt with the disciples of Tiancaitang in private, so he would be ranked here.Looking at Ling Yixue, second in the elite hall, it is directly ranked after one hundred, one hundred and one.Ling Feng is one hundred and two.The Ling Tie hand is 103. UU Reading www.uukanshu.comHowever, this ranking is difficult to say. After all, the top five disciples in the elite hall are all the three peaks of the martial arts. Once they realize that the qi is turned into a gang, it is possible to defeat the disciples of the genius hall.\"Huh? Am I on the list?\"Ling Xiao originally thought he could not enter the top 200, but when he saw the last name, it was him!It is impossible to have a duplicate name in the Ling family, because the duplicate name will be required to change the name.So this must be his doubt.\\n\"Probably because they defeated Ling Chong and Ling Fei, and played against Ling Tie, so the ranking was advanced.\"In Ling Xiao's view, there is nothing more than this possibility.\"It's kind of interesting, although it's a pleasure to enter the 200, but it is still too late.

The disciples who break through in the process of Dabi are not without fault.The night before the big one of the year.Ling Xiao stopped all cultivation, but planned to take a good sleep.There is nothing better than sleeping to supplement physical fitness.The crazy practice these days really requires a good rest.Now \"Xiangyunbu Huajiao\" has been cultivated to the third level.\"Niu Mogong\u00b7Ningsha\" also cultivated to the third level.Ling Xiao's understanding of these two martial arts is getting deeper and deeper.He found that \"Niu Mogong\" is actually a special inner power mental method, which can be used to display all the martial arts that have been devoured, and to make qualitative changes in these martial arts.For example, \"Meteor Star Fist\" will become \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Meteor Star Fist\";\"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\" will become \"Bull Mogong\u00b7Hundred Steps Sword of Qi\";\\nAnd there are also \"Niu Mogong \u00b7 Qi Qi Jue\", \"Niu Mogong \u00b7 Qi Qi Jue\", \"Niu Mogong \u00b7 Chiyang Shaqi\", \"Niu Mogong \u00b7 Red Bull Shaqi\" and so on.You only need to upgrade the level of \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Ningsha\", and these martial arts powers will naturally increase with it, and you don't need to deliberately practice.The same martial arts, displayed in his hands, will have different powers, and this is his biggest victor.In fact, even if he didn't use gang gas, he wouldn't have to be afraid of dealing with the ordinary martial arts warriors.\"Tomorrow, it will be the birth of a new legend!\"Ling Xiao looked at the moonlight outside, took a deep breath, and closed her eyes.at the same time.Inside a house in the main house of the Ling family.Under the moonlight, a person's white clothes are like snow, a long sword moves with the wind, a sword stabs out, the distant boulder splits, and it turns into powder.The sword light is as powerful as the electricity!If this sword is stabbed on the Xiaoyue wolf, who once caused the Li family's children to suffer a big loss, then the Xiaoyue wolf is afraid to be injured.A seemingly simple sword, but as powerful as Li Xingyun's wild wind sword.\\nIt can be said that this sword is almost invincible in the face of the martial arts warriors.\"Feng'er, you now have a basic understanding of the true meaning of \"Following the Willow Sword\", and you are not a fuss to ask for this advanced swordsman for your father. You can practice advanced martial arts at the peak of the triple martial art Ten percent of the powerful people are rare, you are proud of yourself!\"Standing a few ten meters away from the teenager, a middle-aged martial artist in his thirties, he saw a smile of relief when he saw the success of the young man's swordsmanship.The young man was Ling Feng, the third disciple of Elite Hall, and the middle-aged man was his father.\"More than that! The son is about to understand the trick of turning qi into gang. If he can break through in the battle, even if Ling Yihang is not in my eyes!\"Ling Feng said with a smile.\"Ling Yihang, let's not mention it, but that kid named Ling Xiao, you can easily defeat him.\"The middle-aged man said.\"Ling Xiao? Just that little beggar? Did the father really think his son would put him in his eyes?\"Ling Feng said disdainfully: \"My son's goal this time is the top ten on the stone wall rankings! Ling Xiao is nothing!\"\"Hahaha, you are right, you are right, but you have fallen for your father!\"If Ling Feng really had a trace of fear for Ling Xiao when registering before, then today when he thoroughly cultivated \"Fu Liu Jian with the Wind\" to a great success, he has long ignored Ling Xiao in his eyes.\\n...Another place in the Ling family, in a wooden hut.Ling Yixue was sweating all over.There was a touch of excitement in the bright eyes.There was a man sitting on the window sill, smiling directly at her.\"Yixue, I didn't expect that you actually condensed the qi before the day of the Dabi. In this elite hall, no one except Ling Yihang is your opponent!\"\"Lin Feifan, don't call it so intimate, I have nothing to do with you, and don't forget, this time, the top ten of the elite hall is qualified to challenge the disciples of the genius hall, then don't lose to me. All right!\"Sitting on the window sill, it was actually Ling Feifan, one of the four sons of Tianfeng City, and the well-deserved first genius of Tiancaitang.\"Hahaha, I'm waiting!\"Ling Feifan stood up with a smile, his eyes deep: \"It's probably you who can beat me, and only you, who makes me like you.\"\"Don't be too proud, Ling Yihang is definitely your biggest threat this time!\"\"Well, Ling Yihang's kid is really good. I won't doubt the top three, but if you want to beat me, hehe, it's too early.\"\\nLing Feifan smiled faintly.\"It seems that you have done a very detailed investigation of Ling Yihang, but there is another person, you may be very surprised.\"Ling Yixue's mind emerged from Ling Xiao.\"Who?\"Ling Yihang asked.\"After the conclusion of the Dabi, you will know that this person may be a strong competitor for you, me, and Ling Yihang.\"\"Oh, I didn\u2019t expect Yi Xue, you actually rated this person so high. I\u2019m more and more interested. Okay, go back. Yi Xue, come on, as long as you can enter the elite hall, you can enter the genius. In the competition.\"With words, Ling Feifan's figure moved lightly, and the person had disappeared into the night sky....Ling Family, Jiuye Mansion.It is luxurious and wealthy.Ling Jiu's face was very gloomy at this time.\\n\"Chong'er, I know you have no hope, but this time you must give me the first fifty, otherwise don't ask me for this or that in the future!\"\"Dad, I will not only break into the first 50, but also take that Lingxiao sacrifice flag!\"Ling Chong bit his teeth.Ling Jiu didn't pay any attention to him, but looked at Ling Tie Shou and said: \"Iron Shou, the last time you lost to Ling Xiao, it was because you were too arrogant. The scene, find it yourself!\"\"Got it, Jiuye!\"Ling Tie clenched his teeth and said, \"Whenever I meet Ling Xiao~www.novelbuddy.com~ I will let him taste what it would be like to humiliate me!\"On the day of registration, his \"Dragon Palm\" had not yet reached ten percent of his power, but now, with the power of drugs, he has reached that level.Not only in order to enter the top ten, but more importantly, for the sake of shame....In a secret practice room, Ling Yihang suddenly opened his eyes.\"Breakthrough! Finally broke!\"The Wumai quadruple, Ling Yihang actually broke through the Wumai quadruple in a critical time, and the trace of lingering spirit of Ling Xiaotian, the old man of Ling, helped him a lot.\\n\"Ling Feifan! Your first seat should be changed!\"Among the disciples of the entire Genius Hall and Elite Hall, Ling Yihang now has only Ling Feifan in his eyes.Others, he has not taken it seriously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 KnockoutPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?This is destined to be a restless night.Countless children of the Ling family rubbed their hands and secretly prepared for the perfect opportunity for the Lei Yuemen.The seniors of the Ling family are paying close attention to all this.All they want is this effect.Only in this atmosphere can the best disciples be truly born.The horn of battle has sounded!The brave warriors sharpened their swords!...Early the next morning.\\nAbove the Arena.Although the sky is not yet fully lit, many people have gathered here.I was excited about the disciples of the Ling family who hadn't been able to sleep well all night, and also the middle and senior figures of the Ling family who had come to prepare the venue early in the morning.Ling Xiao came rather late.He slept a good night last night.By the time the square was open, it was already dawn, and he found that all the top ten disciples in the elite hall were already present.All the disciples after the tenth place in the Tiancai Hall came.However, there is only one goal for these people, that is, Ling Yihang, and at most one Ling Yixue.After all, in their eyes, only these two people can pose a threat to them.Ling Xiao yawned and leaned against the stone wall to observe the situation of the whole sports square.There are probably dozens of Biwutai.He didn't count them carefully, but there were too many participants, and these contests are a must.\\nEspecially in the knockout stage, nearly ten thousand people played against each other. There are no such competitions, so I don\u2019t know when it will be.The competitions are all built with special materials. Unless they have gang gas and the moves are too strong, it is really unlikely to break.The so-called knockout is actually the selection of the top ten of the elite hall and the bottom disciples.Then these ten were mixed with one hundred disciples in Tiancaitang for a real comparison.The reason is very simple. The disciples of the Genius Hall are too strong. Most of the disciples in the elite hall and the bottom disciples are simply not enough to watch.If all are mixed together, it would be a waste of the time of genius disciples.Ling Xiao looked at the dozens of genius hall disciples.Sure enough, all of them are the triple peak strength of Wumai, and they all condensed out the qi.It's just that there is a difference in the degree of condensed qi.The worst one, only condensed the first martial arts into 20% gang qi.The strongest one has already condensed the third martial arts into 50% gang qi.Of course, this is still due to the reason that Ling Feifan and others have not arrived temporarily, otherwise it is estimated that the strength of these guys will be more terrible.\\nMost of the disciples in Tiancaitang are very relaxed. After all, there are too few people in the elite hall and the disciples who can threaten them.At this time, they are pointing their fingers and are talking about the elite hall and the disciples.\"Listening to our host, the disciples in this elite class are of good quality. It is estimated that five or six people will pose a threat to our disciples in the talented class.\"\"I think it's Ling Yihang and Ling Yixue, and the rest are not worth mentioning.\"\"Also, Ling Yihang's guy has already ranked eleventh on the Shibi ranking list, and has defeated many of our talented disciples in succession, and may even pose a threat to the extraordinary son.\"\"Well, Ling Yihang is nothing. The extraordinary son can only be defeated by me!\"Suddenly, a rough voice rang, and one person jumped directly from the tens of meters away to the audience platform.\"Ling battle!\"\"It's Lingzhan, ranked fourth in Genius Hall!\"The arrival of this man is too much.In addition, he is very famous, so it caused a lot of excitement in the crowd.Ling Xiao also looked at this battle.\\nHe is nearly two meters tall, and his body is very strong. His body seems to be full of horrible power, and his muscles are scary.In fact, these are all appearances. When Ling Xiao analyzed this guy with Wuhe Soul, he frowned.It is actually the fourfold of Wumai, and the qi has condensed to the level of 90% of the third Wumai!Worthy of being the fourth place of genius, this is too good!Ling Xiao couldn't help but get a little nervous, the fourth is already so, what about the top three?He had long known that the disciples of Genius Hall were terrifying, but when Ling Zhan appeared, he still felt a little surprised.\"Under the four sons, there are Ling Yun, Ling Shuang, and Ling Zhan. It should be said that it is the level of a quasi-son!\"\"Large prince, alas, we can't even meet the prince, let alone the four princes in Tianfeng City.\"\"Ling Feifan, Ling Yun and Ling Shuang haven't arrived yet. It is estimated that they are not very interested in fighting in this elite hall.\"\"Yeah, that is to say, this battle is more lively, otherwise, in his position, there is no need to come.\"Ling Yihang, who was eating on a stone pier, just looked at Ling Zhan lightly, and could not see any expression on his face.Still looking down on his own food.\\nLing Yixue was slightly ugly.Ling Feng and Ling Tie's hands were even more bleak.Faced with this battle, they have no chance of winning.Ling Xiao squeezed his fist.\"The stronger the opponent, the more interesting it is!\"To be honest, he hasn't fought with all his strength since he possessed Wuhe Soul.After comprehending \"Xiang Yunbu \u00b7 Huajiao\" and \"Niu Mogong \u00b7 Ningsha\", he didn't really deal with people.Dealing with Ling Tie hands is just to avoid.\"I want to take it seriously, even I am afraid, I don't know where I can go before breaking through the fourfold of Wumai?\"\"Okay, be quiet! The annual competition will start immediately, and we will decide the top ten from the tens of thousands of elite halls and the disciples!\"A voice full of majesty and domineering sounded.This person should be the senior member of the Ling family who hosts the elite hall, but Ling Xiao really does not know.\\nAt the beginning of Darby, everyone was quiet.Ten people out of ten thousand are selected. This is really a very cruel competition.Of course, even if you can't make it to the top ten, as long as you can qualify within a thousand, you can stay in the elite hall.So don\u2019t look at so many disciples, everyone\u2019s goals and objectives are different.Some simply want to enter within a thousand.Some want to get the elite hall ranking.Others want to enter the Talent Hall through this Dabi.\"Now, the first round of the game begins, pay attention to the number, and then enter the corresponding competition platform, if it does not appear within the specified time, it is regarded as giving up.\"The way of the game is actually very simple. UU reads www.uukanshu.com to determine the victory in one game, and the two will face each other. The loser leaves the field and the winner stays.The game will not change until there are 1,000 people left.According to the ranking on the stone wall, the thousand people will be divided into ten groups, and the arrangement of these ten groups is in a zigzag manner.For example, the first ranked Ling Yihang is the first group, the second ranked Ling Yixue is the second group, and so on, and the 20th ranked disciple will be arranged to the tenth group.\\nThe benefits of doing so are obvious, so that strong disciples can stay as far as possible, and they will not meet in advance.These ten groups, each group of one hundred people, will ultimately decide one person to advance to the final.That is to participate in the duel with the disciples of the genius hall.But that must be after a thousand people remain.Right now, these tens of thousands of people, except for the top ten as seed players, do not need to participate, the rest of them have to fight down one by one.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 Winning streakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?The tens of thousands of knockout games, the attention of the audience, are often those in focus.According to the rules of the competition, if you lose two games in a row, they will be eliminated automatically. If you lose more than ten games, you will be eliminated automatically.Therefore, there is still a chance of losing one game, but if you lose ten games in a row, they will still be eliminated.If you can win a hundred games in a row, then automatically advance to the list of 1,000 people.This rule is listed separately, mainly to protect some disciples who suddenly emerge.A hundred games in a row is enough to prove their strength, and there is no need to continue to participate in such a big elimination, because it will consume a lot of energy.So what the general audience is most concerned about is those who can win a winning streak.At the beginning of the game, the match list is randomly drawn, that is to say, no one knows who his opponent is before the game starts.Many people are secretly expecting not to encounter the top 200 on the Shibi ranking, otherwise the chance of losing is greater.\\nAt the beginning of the game, the spectators often pay most attention to the elite disciples ranked 20 to 30. After all, if the top ten do not participate in the competition, they may finally win a winning streak.However, after 20 games, there were only two people who still kept winning streak for the time being.One of them was Ling Ziran, who ranked 20th.His battle can be said to be extremely smooth. Almost every opponent was defeated by him in one move, and there was no power to fight back.This year's referee is not an ordinary person. They are all masters of the Ling family and experts who have hosted many major competitions.Their vision is very accurate.Who wins and who loses can often be seen instantly.So sometimes, the fight doesn't need to last too long, they think it's almost the same, they will stop.\"Ling Ziran is too strong, I don't know if I have a chance to hit the top ten this time!\"\"It's definitely possible, you may not know it. Ling Ziran once privately challenged the people in the top ten, but he won.\"\"No wonder it's so powerful! But who is the other one who has won a winning streak? Why haven't you seen it?\"\"That man, I've heard it, called Ling Xiao. Recently, among the bottom disciples, he was a comet-like figure, but it's amazing how he has won 20 games in a row.\"\\nThat's right, one of those who has won 20 games in a row is Ling Ziran, who is expected to challenge the top ten.The other one is Ling Xiao, a really dark horse!\"It's his turn again, let's go, and look at the excitement in the past. What is the difference between this guy and what he encounters in the future?\"go!\"Although many games are being played at the same time, but it is really concerned, only Ling Ziran and Ling Xiao.Because the two of them are the only ones who are likely to impact the 100-game winning streak.\"Twenty-first round! No!\"Ling Xiao's figure flashed, and the man had already appeared on the competition platform.He did not deliberately conceal his body style.After all, this has already been spread, and many people know that his body is outstanding, and he can\u2019t hide it.The opponent is just a warrior with a double peak in the martial arts. Facing Ling Xiao, his momentum has already weakened by three points.\"Strong punch!\"\\nThe opponent roared, seeming to give himself a boost.He is performing an intermediate boxing technique with good power, but in the face of Ling Xiao, it is really not enough to watch.\"Go on!\"Ling Xiao just took a step forward slightly, and then, like a bull attack, his fists turned into double horns.Directly drove the opponent to the stage.\"Hey, is that awesome?\"\"Yes, it's basic martial arts! It's so powerful! But how powerful is it!\"\"9588 wins, 21 games in a row!\"The referees saw surprise in their eyes, not only because Ling Xiao won 21 games in a row.More importantly, in these twenty-one games, Ling Xiao all defeated his opponent by one trick.Even more ridiculous than this is that he actually used the basic martial arts!\"He would dare to use a lot of strength when dealing with Wumai's double opponents.\"\\nNor can we blame others for saying this, the key is not to know whether it is a coincidence, Ling Xiao\u2019s luck in these twenty-one games is really good, the strongest is Wumai Duo.Those who can't see Ling Xiao's powerful people will naturally find various reasons to slander him.\"number!After a short break, the twenty-second round began again.The opponent in this game is still an opponent of Wumai double peak.So Ling Xiao has almost no hesitation.After the referee started calling, he took the initiative to attack.Still quite aggressive.It's still just a trick.The opponent was still flying out of the contest.It's not that he started ruthlessly.Mainly this is the rule.\\nOnly when the opponent is defeated, or the opponent admits defeat, can it be regarded as a true end to the competition.That is to say, even if the referee makes a judgment, it is only a reference. If the contestants do not agree, they must continue to compare.In order to avoid trouble, he simply hit a punch.However, the disciples who were beaten by him were not seriously injured. Today, he is already very skilled in controlling the force.\"Hum, it's nothing extraordinary, just good luck. The opponent is actually Wumai double, so you can't have a Wumai triple!\"There is still dissatisfaction among the lively people.\"No. 9588 wins, 22 games in a row!\"The referee also seemed to be a little numb. Without the previous shock, he just announced the result mechanically.However, what makes those waiting to watch Ling Xiao's joke uncomfortable is that in the next ten games, Ling Xiao still hasn't met a martial arts triple warrior.After all, there are too many people, and most of them are martial arts with double martial arts.\"No. 9588! Thirty-two games in a row!\"\"Brother Zi Ran, this guy Ling Xiao is also very lucky. You both met two martial arts triple warriors, but he didn't touch any of them!\"\\nOff the field, there are many people who use the competition to see the bustle.Two of them, Ling Ziran, who also maintained a winning streak, and so far, have lost two games of Ling Yu.It was Ling Yu who was speaking. This woman really seduce a man.Ling Ziran got hooked up so quickly.\"Reassure Sister Rain, as long as I have the opportunity to encounter this Lingxiao, I will definitely clean him up for you.\"Ling Ziran said coldly: \"But this guy has better luck. If he meets the Wumai triple martial arts one after another, he will be eliminated directly if he fails, maybe I have no chance to teach him.\"Obviously, Ling Ziran sneered at Ling Xiao.Although he knew that Ling Xiao had defeated Ling Tie by coincidence, many people thought that battle was just an accident.Some people even said that it was Ling Tie who pretended to be a pig and ate a tiger for the purpose of the annual competition.\"number!\"\"Huh? That's Ling Hu! Ling Hu, ranked 140th in the elite hall~www.novelbuddy.com~ Wumai Sanxiu, this time there is a good show!\"Just when Ling Ziran was bored and prepared to go back and wait for his opponent to appear, the situation finally changed.\\n\"Ling Tiger! Give a good lesson to that pretender!\"\"Yes, that kid is too rampant!\"Ling Xiao used the basic martial arts in order to save real energy, but did not expect to be treated like these by these people.This is really a bit wrong.But it is clear that many people are already unhappy with him.After all, a little beggar suddenly became a flamboyant figure, and many people were not very balanced.\"Ling Xiao, I've already seen your kid's discomfort!

The strength is not out of mouth!\"Ling Xiao stood there and hooked his hand, and the triple martial arts warriors could not pose any threat to him now.\"Arrogant! Then you dare to use basic martial arts, I will let you know how powerful!\"\"Tiger Fist!\"Ling Hu roared towards Ling Xiao, his body turned into a fierce tiger, and his momentum was very good.Although it is also an intermediate martial arts, it is much more powerful than the intermediate martial arts exhibited by the martial arts double martial arts encountered by Ling Xiao before.Between the outburst of true energy, the power of Linghu's punch has been exerted to the extreme.\\nSpeed \u200b\u200band instantaneous explosive power are extremely scary!\"No wonder you have the confidence to end my winning streak. This punch is really good. It is estimated that ordinary warriors with triple peaks will not dare to challenge you.\"Faced with the attack, Ling Xiao was actually there while making an attack, while still talking.\"But meeting me is destined to be your tragedy, go on!\"\"Very bullish!\"The words fell.Ling Xiao fists out again.The field seemed to be a showdown between a tiger and a bull.\"Fuck, this kid is also courageous. In the face of Linghu's fierce tiger boxing, is he still using basic martial arts to learn?\"\"Humph! He's looking for death!\"boom!This is definitely a collision between power and strength.A figure flew directly backwards, and then fell heavily on the ground.Ling Hu's sturdy body with a full weight of 180 pounds came directly with a **** facing backwards, and fell flat on the ground. His nose was bleeding.\\nTwo incisors were knocked out.what--!how can that be!The chin fell all around the audience.\"No. 9588 wins, 33 straight games!\"After the referee announced the result, many talents pondered it.This is too monster!Another trick!Basic martial arts again!Thirty-three games in a row!Many people who couldn't look down on Ling Xiao immediately closed their mouths. Their face was beaten so badly.Doesn't it mean that Ling Xiao didn't dare to use brute force to deal with the martial arts triple warrior?As a result, not only did they do it, but they still succeeded!\"go!\"\\nLing Ziran left with a somber face.Now he just wanted to meet Ling Xiao quickly, and then personally teach Ling Xiao, otherwise, Ling Xiao's prestige would soon surpass him.\"Brother Ziran, that Ling Xiao is not easy to deal with, we are afraid we won't win.\"When Ling Yu said these words, he slipped a cunning smile on his lips, which was obviously a provoke.\"Well, don't worry, that Linghu is only ranked one hundred and forty, and I only learned intermediate martial arts, but I am ranked 20th, and I learned advanced martial arts!\"Ling Ziran was really irritated.Well men.Even if he is only a 15- or 16-year-old boy, he doesn't want a man whom a pretty girl says to be stronger than himself.What's more, Ling Ziran didn't find out how powerful Ling Xiao is. The reason why Ling Xiao can win in a row is because his opponent is too weak.Ling Yu smiled and said, \"Okay, Ziran, don't be angry. Let's continue our own game first. There will always be chances.\"Next, more and more people follow Ling Xiao.Thirty-four winning streaks!Forty-five consecutive games!Sixty games in a row!\\nNinety games winning streak!miracle!Absolutely a miracle!The referees were shocked.Until the ninety round, because many of the less powerful disciples have been eliminated, so the rest are basically the martial arts triple martial arts.Ling Xiao has encountered ten martial arts triple warriors in a row for a period of time.Moreover, the basic martial arts are quite powerful.Perhaps it was stimulated by Ling Xiao.Ling Ziran suddenly became fierce.So much so that by the 90th round, most of the disciples took the initiative to concede defeat after taking office, so Ling Ziran won more easily.Both men have ninety games in a row.It hasn't been touched so far.In fact, according to the idea of \u200b\u200bthe referee team, I don't really want these two to meet.Because they are all the best among these tens of thousands, if they can successfully enter the next round with a 100-game winning streak, it will be a good thing.\\nBetween meals, Ling Xiao and Ling Ziran were the most discussed.\"Senior brother, Ling Xiao has always defeated the enemy with basic martial arts, and is neat! But Ling Ziran has forced many people to admit defeat by his strength alone. You said that if these two people are right, who can win? ?\"\"In my opinion, Ling Ziran has a better grasp of winning. After all, Ling Ziran knows advanced martial arts, and Ling Xiao's basic martial arts are used well. After all, they are only basic martial arts, and they are useless when they meet Ling Ziran! \"\"Well, this is the truth. Brother really sees the ground! I also think that Ling Xiao is good, but unfortunately I didn't learn good martial arts!\"\"I don't think so much, I think Ling Xiao is more confident in winning.\"At this moment, Ling Xiao has appeared fans.\"Why do you say that?\"\"I saw the showdown between Ling Xiao and Ling Tie's hand that day. Ling Xiao used the light skill method, even Ling Yixue couldn't catch up with it, and Ling Xiao hasn't used it in this knockout. How to do it.\"\"You are wrong to say so. Ling Ziran has not used his advanced martial arts until now. He has always used intermediate martial arts.\"There was fierce fighting on the stage, and the controversy also started.In the past, Ling Xiao did not have much status in the Ling family, and even supporters were impossible.However, this time the 10,000-knockout game, he has some supporters.Most of these people's experiences are similar to him, they are recruited from outside, and they are also bullied.So in their view, Ling Xiao is simply their hero template!\\nAfter eating and resting for about half an hour, the game continued.At this time it was getting dark. It is estimated that when Ling Xiao completed a hundred victories, today's matchup should be over.The rest will continue tomorrow.The warriors are also humans and need rest.However, what surprised him was that in the 91st game of the game, he actually encountered Ling Yu!This girl who once made him hate and love.But now only disappointment and disdain.Standing on the stage, Ling Xiao looked at Ling Yu lightly.\"Unexpectedly, Ling Yu, the little beggar who was bullied by you in the past has now become your nightmare!\"\"Hee hee, Brother Xiao Xiao, UU reading www.uukanshu.com Don\u2019t make the words so unpleasant.

Thing.\"Ling Yu looked at Ling Xiao with a smile, but walked slowly past, meaning that she was completely undefended.\"What's the matter with these two people? This is a contest, and it's not a chat conference. Why are they still chatting.\"The following people were a little unhappy, and the actions of the two on the stage made them bored.\"Really, do you really think I don't know? It was you who poisoned the food that killed several of my brothers that time.\"\\n\"Hee hee, Brother Ling Xiao really loves to joke, how can I do that kind of thing, do you think people are like that kind of person?\"Ling Yu smiled and walked to Ling Xiao's side, and then actually went to take Ling Xiao's arm.There was a strange glory in her eyes.\"Mystery-Dementor!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he had practiced \"Niu Mogong Ningsha\" by himself, he had a special effect of restraining this mysterious method of disturbing the mind. He was really suspended.However, Ling Yu is now self-inflicted. After such a blow, I am afraid that he will not dare to come to him in a short time.\"No. 9588 wins, 91 games in a row!\"It took a long time for the referee to remember to announce the result of the match.Because at this time, even these referees did not understand what just happened.Ling Xiao didn't do anything at all, and Ling Yu was inexplicably defeated.\"Ling Xiao, you dare to hurt my sister Rain, I am incompatible with you!\"I don't know when the seed player Ling Feng has appeared beside Ling Yu.

You must avenge me, avenge me!\"Ling Yu is like a frightened rabbit, holding Ling Feng's arm and talking constantly.\"Relax, I will!\"For Ling Feng's words, Ling Xiao didn't even care about it.His fight continues.Ninety-two winning streak!Ninety three games in a row!Ninety-four winning streak!\\nSince the game that directly frightened Ling Yu, three consecutive games, no one dared to fight him again.All three chose to give up.Everyone is not an idiot, and since they can't win, why waste their energy.Anyway, it was eliminated without losing.Perhaps it was stimulated by Ling Xiao, and Ling Ziran's start became more and more fierce. There were almost no people willing to fight Ling Ziran.So Ling Ziran also successfully relied on his opponent's abstention to complete the 94-game winning streak.\"After one hundred winning streak, you can go to rest.

Does basic martial arts say that there is a realm of change?\"The so-called transformation of the environment means to be enchanted.Among martial arts, it is generally believed that only top martial arts have the possibility to enter the realm.It is good to be able to practice basic martial arts until the Great Consummation, how can it enter the realm? There is simply no precedent and cultivation method in this respect.\\n\"To be honest, the old man doesn't know how he did it, but from the point of view of his process of using moves, it is almost flawless! This is the characteristic of entering the environment!\"What he said is good, most people can't achieve perfection in martial arts.Even if you practice to the great consummation, you can only exert 90% of the power.After all, it has a lot to do with the human body and human qualifications.However, stepping into the realm can bring a martial art to a perfect and flawless level!Even basic martial arts can make opponents stretched, especially those who are not so powerful.\"If that is the case, can he use the basic martial arts to fight all over the world?\"\"That's not true.

It is really a rare genius character of my Ling family. The future is unlimited. In fact, the most valuable thing is that he is not yet fourteen years old. , But already has the calmness and old face that the master should have, which is really rare.\"\\n\"Huh? Looks like it's finally over!\"During the speech, he suddenly looked at the competition platform.At this point, Ling Ziran was a little out of breath, and the continuous eruption made his true energy completely bottomed out.Ling Xiao shook his head, such sparring was no longer qualified.It's time to end the fight.Suddenly, he protruded his right hand, gripped the tip with two fingers, and then kicked Ling Ziran in the chest.Ling Ziran does not have any defensive ability, and can only watch his body fly out, and then fall heavily on the field.\"Ling Ziran, you seriously injured so many disciples of the Ling family, you are not eligible to continue to advance!\"Ling Xiao was standing on the competition platform, and was full of enthusiasm.Ling Ziran, who fell under the stage, moaned in pain.His ribs were completely broken, and his internal injuries were severe.\\nIt is simply impossible to continue to participate in the competition.Either abstain or be defeated and eliminated again.Only these two possibilities.Anyway, Ling Xiao didn't like this Ling Ziran very much, they were all from the same door, he was so vicious to start, it was better to get out as soon as possible.\"Brother Ling Xiao did a great job!\"\"Long live Brother Ling Xiao!\"This move allowed Ling Xiao's supporters to increase again.\"No. 9588 wins, 97 consecutive games!\"The people on the referee seat were all shocked.The result of this game is really beyond their expectations.\"Did you see it, did you see it!

You can actually guess such a result.\"Several female disciples beside Ling Yixue were also surprised.\"Huh, it's nothing remarkable. No matter how good the basic martial arts practice is, it is only basic martial arts after all. How can Ling Ziran compare to me!\"Suddenly came a cold hum next to it, it was Ling Feng.\"Brother Feng, you must avenge me!\"Ling Yu, who was snuggling next to Ling Feng at this time, was no longer qualified for promotion. He looked at Ling Xiao in the distance with resentment, and wished to cut the other side with a knife.\"Don't worry, Sister Rain~www.novelbuddy.com~ you can rest assured to recuperate!\"Speaking of which, he suddenly looked at Ling Xiao and said aloud: \"Ling Xiao, if you have the ability, you can win a hundred straight games and advance to it. When you meet me, I will let you know what basic martial arts are shit. It's scrap!\"\\nHis voice was directly transmitted from the stand to the contest stand.It seems to be intentional.Because he was so confident, he never thought he would lose.\"Relax, to deal with you, basic martial arts is enough!\"Ling Xiao is also confident. As long as Ling Feng does not condense his qi, he can definitely win by virtue of his strength.It's just that you might have to use \"Xiang Yunbu\".After all, Ling Feng is not Ling Ziran. He is at least three times stronger than Ling Ziran. It is really a bit difficult to simply use basic martial arts.

He didn't expect Ling Xiao to look down on Ling Zi, but he dared to look down on him so much!\"Okay! Just wait and see!\"Ling Xiao smiled faintly, without saying anything, but continued to complete his game.In the next three games, the opponent took the initiative to concede defeat, so he easily won a hundred consecutive victories.\"Congratulations to Ling Xiao, No. 9588, the only one who has won a hundred games in a row and successfully advanced to the roster of thousands!\"Promoting to the list of thousands of people means that you have entered the elite hall and are no longer the bottom disciples.This makes countless people envious.It was already late at this time, but there was still light. Others were still competing, but Ling Xiao quietly left the contest.\\nIn his view, only Ling Yixue, Ling Yihang, and the people of Tiancai Tang could pose a threat to him today.At this time these people did not play, it might as well just go home and have a good rest.Before going home, he went to the medicine hall.\"What's the matter, little guy, is this eliminated? Should the competition still be underway?\"In the medicine hall, Ling Xiao happened to meet Ling Jiu, and there was another middle-aged man who should be Ling Feng's father.It was Ling Jiu who asked the question, full of satire.\"It's Jiuye, I passed a hundred consecutive victories and advanced in advance.\"Ling Xiao arched his hand, and then said a little lightly, so he went to find the teacher in the medicine hall thousands of times.The embarrassment of Ling Jiu and Ling Feng's father's face only.\"Hahaha, Nine Lords, this kid had bullied your home Ling Chong a lot, can't he let him continue to trample?\"After a while, Ling Feng's father suddenly said with a smile.\\n\"Huh, it's okay to be promoted, the iron hand will pick him up.\"\"That's not necessarily, we can't eliminate him from our family style first.\"The two of them obviously still did not put Ling Xiao in their eyes, thinking that with Ling Tie hands or Ling Feng, they could easily defeat Ling Xiao.At the time of their chat, Ling Xiao had taken Gang Qidan and left, a total of three!Ling Xiao didn't want these two people to see it, otherwise it would cause trouble in plain, so he walked from the back door.Back home, eating some dumplings grandpa's hand-made dumplings, Ling Xiao entered the practice room and began to practice.A gang qi pill enters the belly.In one night, his third meridian had increased to 90%.It's almost 10% off and it should be able to break through.But there are still competitions today, so he put two gangqi dan into the practice room, and people left to participate in the competition.Yesterday it was said that the contest lasted until the middle of the night, and the final thousand were decided.\\nAfter all, such a showdown can only be regarded as rookies pecking at each other, not much meaning.Except for the bright spots like Ling Xiao, everyone else is quite satisfactory, and it is over quickly. It is reasonable to make the following more wonderful showdown.The next day, more than 900 advanced disciples, plus ten seed players, gathered on the competition square.Ling Xiao is looking forward to today's matchup.Because after one day's duel yesterday, he obviously found that his actual combat experience has made great progress, and his cultivation practice has also been improved to a certain extent.This shows that such a fight is definitely good for him, not a waste of time.\"Today! The 1,000 of you here are all qualified to enter the elite hall! However, in today's game, you, a thousand, will eliminate most of them, and only the individual will be left to participate in the final!\"\"Let me read the following rules of the game...\"The rules for the semi-finals are very different from the preliminary rounds.It is divided into two stages.In the first stage, a thousand people are divided into ten groups, each group of one hundred people.\\nThen the 100 people were put on the big competition platform at the same time, and the last ten people left could be promoted to the second stage.Also known as chaos!The reason why high-level officials arrange this is naturally because of their reasons.A warrior can't just be strong one-on-one.You also need to learn to protect yourself during chaos!When he heard this first stage, Ling Xiao laughed.Because at this stage there is no difficulty for him.He doesn't even need to shoot, just use his dexterous body to avoid attacks, anyway, the real challenge is the second stage.Ten people from each group are selected, and a total of 100 people will be ranked in a point system. The top ten with the most points will be promoted to the final stage.At that time, he must have met Ling Feng, Ling Yixue, Ling Yihang and others. That would be a real battle.So in this first stage, if you can do it without effort, try not to try it.\\nAfter the rules were read out, Ling Xiao was placed in the tenth group, the strongest in the same group was Ling Fei ranked tenth.That is, the person who once competed with Ling Xiao and was defeated.At the beginning of the game, the situation was a bit subtle. I don't know if it was agreed in advance. The remaining ninety-nine people actually attacked Ling Xiao at the same time.\"this is okay too?\"\"There are really many offended people!\"\"It's not an offense. I'm afraid someone is jealous and doesn't want him to move on.\"\"What should we do, even if Ling Yihang, even Ling Feifan, I'm afraid I can't say that he is undefeated in the face of these ninety-nine people?\"\"What should I do? Cold salad! Although it is a pity, it is estimated that he is really going to be eliminated.\"Although many people squeezed Khan for Ling Xiao, they felt it was a bit unfair to him, but as long as they didn't violate the rules, no one else could say anything.However, the next scene made these people startled and happy.I saw Ling Xiao sitting cross-legged in the air, about 20 meters high, actually able to maintain a quarter of an hour.\\nAfter a quarter of an hour, he landed, and he rose again in an instant.Let others not attack him, or even touch his corner.Originally, Ling Fei also wanted to take advantage of more people, seeing this scene, he simply gave up.The ghost is against that monster.\"Oh my god, what kind of light is this? You can hover in the air for almost a quarter of an hour!\"\"I don't know. Is there such a light work in the library?\"\"\"Xiang Yunbu\"!\"In the dark corner, Ling Jiu punched the wall fiercely.He didn't expect that he forcibly robbed \"Xiang Yunbu\" and \"Bull Magic Gong\" from Ling Xiao's hands, but UU read the book www.uukanshu.com, but neither his pro son nor his dry son could cultivate.Become a wicked person but get no benefit, harm others and disadvantage yourself.That's all.\\nNow that Ling Xiao actually practiced \"Xiang Yunbu\", he almost spurted blood on the wall.The reason why those people will all aim at Ling Xiao is that he secretly made a mistake.The result turned into a joke.About an hour later, one thousand people eliminated nine hundred people, leaving only the last one hundred.Ling Xiao is the easiest one to pass, but Ling Yihang, Ling Yixue, Ling Feng and Ling Tie did not have much effort.Because few people dare to take action against them.After all, there are ten people who can stay. Whoever shoots these people first may be eliminated first, and those with a little brain will not do that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In fact, the speed was very fast. Soon it was the turn of Ling Xiao.The opponent is a chubby triple fat man.\"Hey, Brother Ling Xiao, I came up to tell you that you will be my idol in the future!\"The next fat man smiled, turned and jumped off the competition platform.Confess!In fact, this is too normal. The previous games also took the initiative to admit defeat. The reason is very simple.When meeting an opponent who is absolutely impossible to win, it is better to simply admit defeat than to forcibly fight and waste real energy.Anyway, if you lose, no points will be deducted.\\nYou can get three points if you win.Many people are very clear about this account.Ling Xiao has no accidents. Before that, there were thousands of people and thousands of people in the process of chaos, but he has accumulated a lot of popularity.Coupled with the triple peak of Wumai, Ling Ziran, who used advanced martial arts, was easily defeated by him.Anyone who is a little self-knowledged will not bump into him.The game is fast.Because the game has a time limit.If the battle cannot be resolved within a quarter of an hour, the referee may give a result.Otherwise, some people are of equal strength, and may not be able to decide the victory or defeat for a few days and nights, which is troublesome.Soon, Ling Xiao met his second opponent.This is a female disciple.Good looks, especially those eyes can hook the soul, and some match with Ling Yu.But this strength is worse than Ling Yu.\"Brother Ling Xiao, you just make a family fight. How about a draw? Is it good for others to be your girlfriend?\"If you change someone else, I'm afraid I will be fooled by this woman.\\nLook at the people who have hearts in the eyes of the audience. They basically account for the majority, and you know how powerful this woman is.Compared with Ling Yu's ability to seduce people, it is really not bad.It's a pity that with Ling Yu, Ling Xiao naturally has a resistance to beautiful women.Coupled with the woman's request, he was sick of him.\"Very bullish!\"Without any nonsense, he slammed the girl off the stage with just one palm.He will vomit when he looks at this woman more.\"You! You beast! You don't know the style!\"The girl sat on the ground and cried, crying, causing those male disciples to squint at Ling Xiao.\"Too much, the other party is also a girl, so violent!\"\"That's right, don't cry, beauty, wait for a while and I'll take the stage to teach the kid!\"\"Just blow it, even Ling Zi can't beat it, and still hit Ling Xiao? The leather has blown through the sky!\"Obviously, not everyone feels that Ling Xiao has done something wrong.Ling Xiao also had a group of determined fans among the crowd.This is the benefit of strength!\\n\"9588 wins, 6 points accumulated!\"The referee quickly read the result.\"This son is a talent for creation. Even the female color can't affect him, and it will definitely become the atmosphere in the future!\"The referees are very important to Ling Xiao.The game continues.Ling Xiao's score is also increasing.When meeting his opponent, he will either abstain.Either he flew off the court by one stroke.In order to avoid trouble, Ling Xiao started not too light.It is to warn those who have no self-knowledge to provoke him.Because he wants to save his strength to facilitate his opponents who can threaten him.\"Can't see, to what extent the strength of Ling Xiao has reached, I always feel that he still hides his strength!\"More and more people think that Ling Xiao cannot only understand basic martial arts, he must have learned other martial arts.It's just that there is no shot.The expectations for him are also growing.\\nLing Xiao finished his competition, and did not forget to observe the competition between Ling Yihang, Ling Yixue and Ling Feng.Because in his view, only these three people can pose a threat to him.\"No. 2 vs. No. 4!\"Ok?Ling Xiao heard this voice and quickly looked around.Sure enough, Ling Yixue and Ling Tie were standing on one of the competition platforms.Ling Tiehou currently ranks fourth in Elite Hall.Ling Yixue ranked second in the elite hall.\"The second and fourth duel, this time can be hilarious, ha ha ha!\"Many people have gathered in the past. Such battles are rare.Ling Xiao naturally refused to miss such a wonderful matchup, so he also floated over, there should be some time before his next matchup, just to see the lively.To be honest, he has not seen Ling Yixue shot yet.Today may be a feast for the eyes.When he passed, the battle had already begun.\"The ninth style of the palm of the giant spirit!\"\\nAs soon as Ling Tie's hand came up, he pressed every step of the way without leaving his hand.The power of terror turned into a phantom of a giant behind his body. The power of terror was shocking.Ling Yixue took a wait-and-see attitude. She didn't rush out when she came up, but she evaded with her clever body.Ling Xiao was a little surprised that Ling Tie's strength was much stronger than the time he encountered when he signed up.The moves are more powerful and more skillful.Fully exerted the power of 90% of advanced martial arts.In other words, his \"Dragon Spirit Palm\" is already considered a great consummation, but it has not yet entered the realm.If simple horizontal comparison, Ling Tie's hand at this time is even more powerful than Li Xingyun in Fulong Mountain.Of course, Li Xingyun's strength has not improved, he would not know.\"Ling Tie, your strength is not weak, but unfortunately not my opponent!\"A moment later~www.novelbuddy.com~ Ling Yixue started to fight back.During the talk, the surrounding air seemed to freeze suddenly.Her palms were dyed bizarre white, like gloves woven from snowflakes.\"Advanced Martial Arts \"Frozen Palm\"!\"Some people recognized the martial arts moves used by Ling Yixue.\\n\"It is said that if you want to practice \"Ice Palm\", you must often be in the ice and snow.

Although Ling Yixue's body is not as good as Ling Xiao, it is stronger than Ling Tie's hand, and a palm is printed on Ling Tie's chest.Ling Tie's upper body froze instantly.\"Ling Yi Xuesheng!\"The referee gave the judgment in time, and the result was already obvious.Hearing the referee's voice, Ling Yixue withdrew his slender hands, and the ice burst instantly.With cold sweat behind Ling Tie's hands, he looked at Ling Yixue in horror: \"I'm not your opponent!\"He knew very clearly that if Ling Yixue had attacked from the beginning, he might not be able to support three moves.\\n\"Sister Yixue's strength is too strong, Ling Tie, who ranked fourth, was defeated so easily!\"The elite masters are all surprised.They knew that Ling Yixue was powerful, but they did not expect Ling Yixue to be so powerful.They still remember clearly that a month ago, Ling Yixue had played against Ling Tie.Although Ling Yixue also won, but it was a terrible victory.But today, winning is so easy and comfortable.\"Afraid to be in the elite hall, only Ling Yihang and Ling Feng are qualified to compete with Ling Yixue.\"\"No, Ling Yixue is definitely not the opponent of Ling Yihang. The monster of Ling Yihang has already broken through the fourfold of Wumai, but Lingfeng and Ling Yixue can be compared.\"In any case, the top three of the elite hall are still the top three of the elite hall at this time.So far, Ling Yihang, Ling Yixue and Ling Feng have all won, and no one can challenge their position.These three people have naturally become the focus of everyone's attention.Whether they can challenge the rule of Tiancaitang depends on these three people.As for Ling Xiao.\\nAlthough the performance is excellent, in most people's view, it can't be compared with the top three.After reading the comparison between Ling Yixue and Ling Tie, Ling Xiao also returned to the competition stage.Because he ushered in his next opponent.It is a relatively strong opponent.This person is Ling Cheng, because he lost to Ling Feng, so he dropped from the original ranking to fifth.But even so, he is still very characteristic in the top ten of the elite hall.The most terrifying thing about this man is to practice kung fu. If he can't break his defense, then wait for his abuse.So far, Ling Cheng has lost only two games, one to Ling Yihang and one to Ling Yixue, all of which are automatically admitted.And he has not met Ling Feng and Ling Tie, so this result is already very good.\"Ling Xiao, you should take the initiative to concede defeat. I don't want to waste energy on you. I still have to be true to deal with Ling Feng!\"Ling Cheng once lost to Ling Feng, so he always wanted to take revenge.He did not put Ling Xiao in his eyes at all, only Ling Feng in his eyes.Offstage, people who don't like Ling Xiao are gloating.\\nLet your kid run wild, now meet the strongman now!It should be said that it is not unreasonable for these people to be blissful.After all, to the present position, Ling Xiao encountered the strongest opponent, and this Ling became.\"Relax, Brother Ling Cheng, I will help you defeat Ling Feng!\"Ling Xiao said lightly.\"Boy is really rampant! How can you defeat Ling Feng! Really shameless to the face, in this case, I will defeat you with three strokes, so as not to waste energy.\"Ling Xiao smiled and said: \"I heard that Brother Ling Cheng\u2019s horizontal practice is good. It happens that my \"Bull Power\" can also be used as a horizontal practice. Brother may wish to try three tricks. If I lose, I will automatically admit defeat. .\"He is totally eye to eye, tooth to tooth.You look down on me, I still look down on you.\"you!\"Ling Cheng was so angry that his teeth tickled. He had a high degree of self-esteem.\"This is your fight, don't blame me!\"Ling Xiao said nothing more. He stood there and exhibited the basic martial arts of \"Bull Bull Power\".\\nBut this time it was not an attack, but a defense.True Qi is attached to the body surface, forming a film that is almost visible to the naked eye.Don't look at it as a film, but the defense is amazing.\"This kid just used \"Bull Power\" to live!\"The old man on the referee's bench said with emotion: \"Anyone who can use \"Bull Bull Power\" as a defense is afraid that it is only possible after entering the environment. Our Ling family may be the only one who can do it.\"\"Hum, so it's mysterious!\"Ling Cheng's fists were clenched tightly, and a layer of golden qi was wrapped around his fists. The fists turned into gold casting.That terrifying power is absolutely no less than an attack using weapons.\"What a powerful force!\"\"Yeah, this should be the advanced boxing technique \"Vajra Boxing\", combined with the horizontal training of \"King Kong\", the power is even greater!\"\"Oh, everyone knows that Ling Cheng's defense is amazing. In fact, many people don't know that he is the only genius who can use horizontal training to attack. Even with this attack, even Ling Feng and Ling Yixue dare not be hard Pick it up.\"\"Ling Xiao is too big!\"Everyone's comments have explained everything. No one is optimistic about Ling Xiao, who feels that Ling Xiao has become proud of her winning streak.\\nIt didn't matter because the opponent was not good before, but this time Ling Cheng, who was ranked fifth in the elite hall, dared to do so.Listening to the words of everyone, Ling Xiao just smiled lightly.What is Ling Cheng's level? His mountain and river martial arts has long been clearly analyzed. In fact, he is no better than Ling Ziran, who is ranked first.They are all the martial arts triple peak martial arts, all are advanced martial arts.Speaking of the gap, it is the gap between the power of moves and combat skills.In fact, in addition to the first three in the elite hall, those in the back of Ling Xiao's view are likely to challenge each other.boom--!Ling Cheng's double fists blasted directly on Ling Xiao's body, making a loud noise, and the entire Biwutai shook a few times.However, what is shocking is that Ling Xiao still smiled without frowning.\"No, the defense of \"Bull Bull\" is so terrifying?\"Ling Cheng was shocked in his heart, as if ten thousand cows had run by, completely ignorant.In one move, the height of the two can already be seen.One was motionless, and the other as the attacker was shocked to take two steps back before he stood firm.\\nEveryone in the audience was even more shocked and inexplicable, and all the hearts of them turned up the turbulent waves.To be honest, before Ling Xiao, no one had paid much attention to the basic martial arts such as \"Ban Niu Jin\".They all regard it as a springboard, and after learning martial arts at a higher level, they throw it away.Who would have thought that the performance of \"Bull Bull Power\" in Ling Xiao's hands became so terrifying.Ling Cheng stabilized his body and looked at Ling Xiao in horror, this monster!This guy's defense is almost watertight!Ling Xiao just smiled faintly~www.novelbuddy.com~ still stood like that, totally meaningless.After analyzing the defense of Wu Wu Hun in Mountain and River, the defense of \"Natural Bull Power\" has reached the conclusion that as long as it is below the triple peak of the Wu Mai, a warrior who does not use gang gas can basically not break his defense.This is just the \"Ban Niu Jin\" of Transcendence.Ling Xiao hasn't used the \"Niu Mogong \u00b7 Manniu Huamo\" after the promotion.Not to mention, he also has \"Niu Mogong \u00b7 Qi Qi Jue\" to cooperate.In addition, he hasn't moved at all until now.I really don't know who is qualified to force him to display all his abilities.\\nIs Ling Yihang OK?Or the top ten in Tiancaitang?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How can it be comparable to Brother Ling Cheng's advanced defense technique \"Vajra\".\"\"Ling Xiao, I admire your courage, but if your defense is like that, then you will lose today!\"Ling Cheng was angry.Just that punch, he did not do his utmost, and only used seven success forces, because he wanted to retain more real energy to deal with Ling Feng.But this time, he didn't plan to keep his hand anymore.\"Ten Success Forces-Diamond Boxing!\"\\nOk?Ling Xiao frowned, Ling Cheng's punch was obviously more powerful than the last punch!\"Then I will use ten successful forces to resist it!\"He lightly wrote a sentence, but almost spitting Ling Cheng angry.After a long time, he didn't use all his strength to defend, which is really good.\"boom!\"There was another loud noise.Ling Xiao still does not move.But Ling Cheng flew out with a back shock, and finally stabilized his figure.The greater the attack power, the greater the anti-shock.\"so horrible!\"\"Who can break Ling Xiao's defense!\"\"I don't believe this evil!\"\\nLing Cheng took out a pair of gloves from his close pocket. The gloves were obviously made of special materials.\"That's an ordinary treasure, and it has a bonus effect on attacks. Generally speaking, it can increase the power of 20%.\"On the referee seat, some people have already seen that the gloves in Ling Cheng's hands are not ordinary objects.In addition to worldly weapons, there are treasures, spirits, reals, fairys, and artifacts in this world!And light is a treasure, and it is divided into five grades of ordinary, fine, treasure, fairy and god.The children of the Ling family, few people have ever seen treasures, let alone spiritual weapons.That is, the warriors on the referee's bench were well-informed, so they recognized the glove at a glance.\"Hahaha, this is a treasure of all kinds, I think you dare not resist it!\"Ling Cheng laughed wildly.He felt that he couldn't even break Ling Xiao's defense. It was really shameful, so he didn't plan to keep his hands this time.With the ten success forces and all the treasures, he didn't believe Ling Xiao could stop it.Unless Ling Xiao also has a defensive treasure.\"Then what happens, just come on!\"\\nLing Xiao knows that it is definitely unstoppable to rely on \"Bull Bull Power\" alone. This time, you must use \"Courage Secret\" to improve the defense effect of \"Bull Bull Power\", otherwise it will be really troublesome.In the end, the other party is the elite in the elite hall, which is more powerful than he thought.\"Yeah!\"In the roar of Ling Cheng, double fists blasted out again.At that moment, Ling Xiao exhibited the \"Violent Secret\", the film on the body was obviously thickened a lot, even exuding a faint luster.\"what--!\"With a scream, Ling Cheng was blasted out again. This time he failed to stand up, but fell directly to the ground and collapsed.Ling Cheng, ranked fifth in the elite hall, was defeated by Ling Xiao without a move.Everyone on the field looked stunned.They thought that Ling Xiao's strength should be no problem in the top 20.It is even possible to enter the top ten.After all, Ling Ziran, who ranked 20th, could beat the 11th-ranked disciple in the 10,000-dollar competition.Ling Xiao defeated Ling Ziran. Although there are pressures to enter the top ten, it is estimated that it is not a problem.\\nBut they still didn't expect that Ling Xiao won the effort to win Ling Ling in the fifth place.Ling Xiao's expression is too amazing, too eye-catching.Now someone finally started to treat him with Ling Yihang, Ling Yixue and Ling Feng.\"This child is really terrifying. He actually practiced the secret methods \"Breakdown Secret\" and \"Returning Secret Secret\". A warrior like him can generally not take care of both secret recipes.\"\"Yeah, how many secrets are still hidden in his body. The wonderful technique before, now two kinds of secrets, I really look forward to it.\"\"But he should have reached the limit. He should have used it. It is estimated that it is slightly stronger than Ling Tie. It is not possible to challenge the top three.\"\"I think that too, unless he has no other means to show it!\"In the stands, there were also many middle- and high-level Ling families, as well as martial artists. They made a judgment and analysis of Ling Xiao.I was all surprised, but it didn't seem to be very optimistic about Ling Xiao surpassing Ling Feng, Ling Yixue and Ling Yihang.However, the reality is that Ling Yihang, Ling Yixue, Ling Feng and Ling Xiao are the four disciples who have maintained a victory.Although this is because they haven't fought yet, even so, Ling Xiao's defeat of Ling Cheng has shown his horror.Ling Xiao is definitely a real dark horse among these four people.And many people actually like this kind of spoiler the most.\\nTherefore, Ling Xiao's popularity is actually a sign of being close to the top three, becoming the fourth most popular in this knockout.From a small beggar bullied to a warrior who is so popular today.In addition to Ling Xiao's hard work, of course, the most grateful thing is Shan Wu Wu Hun.If it weren't for the awakening of Wu Wushun in the mountains and rivers, he probably wouldn't have the scenery of today.\"Ling Xiao! Ling Xiao!\"Every time Ling Xiao took the stage, many people shouted his name, among them there were some pretty female disciples who were very good-looking.This made Ling Xiao somewhat happy.After all, which teenager does not contemplate spring.After this year, he is also 14 years old, and has some ignorant understanding of the feelings of men and women.Of course, he also gave back to the audience with his excellent record.Continue winning streak.More and more people directly admit defeat after seeing him.Unwilling to admit defeat, unless he is in the top ten, otherwise he still can't pass the trick.\\nEven if it is the top ten, it can not pass three strokes.Of course, he still did not meet Ling Yihang, Ling Yixue and Ling Feng.In the process, Ling Xiao met several interesting opponents.Like Ling Chong.This bully who used to bully him, but now he is always bullied by him, after seeing him directly admit defeat.Ling Chong didn't want to break a few more ribs.And Ling Fei. UU reading www.uukanshu.comPeople who have tried light skills with Ling Xiao have also admitted directly.Ling Fei had seen Ling Xiao's light merit in the chaos of thousands of people before.He knew that he could not win, it might as well save a little effort.The most incredible thing for everyone is that when Ling Tie met Ling Xiao, he even chose to admit defeat.Some people think that Ling Tie's hands were frightened by Ling Yixue.But Ling Xiao knows best.\\nAlthough this Ling Tie's hand is fierce and vicious.But his brain is not stupid. He probably saw Ling Xiao's power, so he wanted to maintain his combat effectiveness and use it against other people.After all, this is a point system. It doesn\u2019t matter if you lose one game, or even lose three or four games.

Ling Yixue!\"\"Lingfeng! Lingfeng!\"In terms of the number of fans, Ling Yixue and Ling Feng are equal.One is a talented beauty.One is a genius disciple in this race.Each has its own fans.So when they came on stage, there were almost crazy cries and cheers from the audience.\"Ling Yixue, you have repeatedly rejected my showing of love, it was an insult to me! Today I will make you completely regret it!\"\\nFor Ling Feng, Ling Yixue is his ideal partner.As for Ling Yu, it's just a substitute.It's a pity that Luo Hua deliberately flowed mercilessly, and Ling Yixue didn't take him seriously.Today's duel, he naturally wants to retaliate.\"Emotional things can't be forced, let alone I just want to practice now!\"Ling Yixue said lightly.There was no wave in her face, and it seemed that she did not put Ling Feng's provocation in her eyes at all.Choking!Ling Feng's sword is out of the sheath!\"Follow the Willow Sword\" draws an irregular sword mark, which is fast and slow, making it impossible to catch.The most terrifying part of this swordsmanship is its treacherousness.When you think it is fast, it suddenly slows down.When you think it is slow, it suddenly becomes faster.Ling Yixue did not dare to be indifferent, her palms came out together, the air of ice spewed abruptly, it seemed that the air was frozen in back.Everyone on the stage did not dare to take a breath.\\nAfter all, this is a duel between the second and third.\u5577!In an instant.The palms wrapped in ice greeted the strange long sword.However, he only touched the following lightly, and the long sword suddenly changed direction, stab towards Ling Yixue's waist.Fighting is not all tough.Ling Feng's \"Fu Liu Jian with the Wind\" may not be as powerful as \"Frost Palm\", but the tricky place is far superior to Han Bing Palm.But Ling Yixue is not an easy generation.The long sword struck her, her figure retreated, and she easily avoided the blow.\"Alas, Ling Yixue does not have family support, only by his own efforts, if he does not turn the gas into a gang, I am afraid to lose!\"After ten strokes, Ling Xiao shook her head gently.He actually hoped that Ling Yixue would win, but looking at it like this, Ling Feng's sword tricks are really not to be underestimated, and the long sword in his hand is also a valuable treasure.Ling Yixue was bare-handed, which was a disadvantage.On the field, you come and go, and you have already done a hundred tricks!However, neither side was injured.\\nLing Feng's sword never touched Ling Yixue's clothing corner.And Ling Yixue could not hurt Ling Feng.Simply talking about martial arts, maybe the two are equally matched.The battle soon entered a stalemate, and someone on the referee seat was already paying attention to the time.But it was really difficult for the referee to decide who lost or won in this game.Because the two are clearly equal, no one can hurt anyone.It seems that it can only be a tie.\"You guys, it looks like this contest will end in a draw.\"The chief referee looked at several people around him and discussed.\"That's not necessarily, Feng'er hasn't used his hole cards yet!\"It was not the referee who spoke, but Ling Xing, who did not know when to stand near the referee seat.That is Ling Feng's father.\"Are there any cards?\"Several referees were shocked, they wouldn't think Ling Xing was making alarmist talks.There must be a reason for this.\\n\"Look, the situation has changed!\"At this moment, someone suddenly shouted, causing everyone to hurry to look up.On the competition stage, the battle situation really changed a lot.After about two hundred strokes, Ling Feng avoided Ling Yixue's palm attack, then suddenly retreated and swept away with a sword.A seemingly bland sword, but shot a strange sword gas!Whoo!\"Ding!\"\"Ok!\"Although Ling Yixue blocked this sword energy, he was still penetrated by the defense, and an arm was shot through a small hole.With a snort, he flew out of the contest.\"Gang!\"Ling Yixue looked up at Ling Feng with a look of surprise in her eyes.However, it was just a surprise.\"Well, let him win, my gangsters can't show up at this time!\"She also has gang gas, and more than Ling Feng, but she has her own ideas, gang gas is used in the finals, and it is not needed now.\\n\"Actually turned Qi into Gang! No wonder Ling Xian was so confident that his son actually condensed Gang Qi!\"On the referee seat, everyone was surprised.Although there are many warriors in the triple peak of Wumai, they can truly comprehend the uncommon.Unexpectedly, this time the elite hall actually two people realized the gang qi.\"Ling Thirteen, Ling Thirteen, your son is hiding deep enough, and he has only used gang gas until now. His talent is really amazing. It seems that the top ten of this year's competition will have him a place.\"The referee said with emotion.Ling Thirteen just smiled lightly and said, \"The elders are well-known, but the dogs are just rude.\"Although he said so on his mouth, Ling Xian's face was uncontrollable excitement.His son Ling Feng is only fifteen years old. At this age, he can enter the top ten of the Genius Hall, which is already very powerful.\"Ling Fengsheng!\"The referee announced the result of the game.\"Strange, how do you feel that Ling Yixue didn't seem to use her full strength?\"Ling Xiao touched his chin suspiciously. Although the result had come out, he always had a feeling.Ling Yixue is still stronger than Ling Feng, just hiding something.\"Lingfeng! Lingfeng!\"\\nThe victory over Ling Yixue made Ling Feng's popularity unprecedented for a while, and even had the momentum to surpass Ling Yihang.After all, looking at the lively, I don\u2019t know how terrible Ling Yihang is.\"Yixue, why not, do you want to use your gang against me?\"Ling Yihang didn't know when he appeared beside Ling Yixue, and asked lightly.\"How come, I just want to rely more on the finals.\"Since it was seen, Ling Yixue did not conceal.\"Relax, Lingfeng, let me clean up!\"Ling Yihang just said a little lightly, and then closed his eyes again, it seems that the competition on the field, there is no other game that can arouse his interest.Ling Feng looked at Ling Yihang, and felt dull, then looked at Ling Xiao again, with disdain and resentment between his eyebrows.The next one is you, Ling Xiao!\"Brother Feng, you are great!\"Waiting for Ling Feng to step down~www.novelbuddy.com~ Ling Yu actually stepped onto the stage to plunge into Ling Feng's arms, and then looked at Ling Xiao with a provocative look.That seems to be saying, how do you beat me, my wind brother will avenge me.Ling Xiao just smiled lightly.It's really stupid enough to think that a trace of gas has condensed, can you suppress me?\\nYou are only qualified to force me to use \"Bull Demon Skill \u00b7 Manni Bull Demon\".However, your \"Fu Liu Jian with the Wind\" is not bad, so I will play with you later.The game continued. After Ling Yixue lost, only three people remained in a row, namely Ling Yihang, Ling Feng and Ling Xiao.To everyone, Ling Xiao is nothing more than a foil.Ling Yihang and Ling Feng are the elite double arrogance of the elite hall, and their rivalry will inevitably become the finale.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Before meeting Ling Feng, he won all the way in a row and even defeated several people in the top ten of the elite hall.Popularity is also rising.Finally, Ling Xiao met Ling Feng after defeating everyone except Ling Yihang and Ling Feng in the top ten.The last game was Ling Xiao and Ling Yixue's duel.But it didn't last long.After only three strokes, Ling Yixue took the initiative to admit defeat.\\nLing Yixue is so clever, knowing that even if he uses Gangqi, he is definitely not Ling Xiao's opponent. It is too worthless to waste Gangqi in this kind of battle.\"This time it's hilarious, both Ling Feng and Ling Xiao defeated Ling Yixue, evenly matched!\"\"Which **** is evenly matched, Brother Ling Feng defeated by strength, and Ling Xiao was just released.\"\"That is, with Ling Xiao's strength, how could it be possible to win in three strokes. It is estimated that Ling Yixue thinks that the points are enough, so he deliberately admits to lose.\"Sure enough, most people still feel that Lingfeng, who used Gangqi, is stronger. As for Lingxiao, the winning streak will end here.\"Ling Xiao, kneel down to admit defeat, I can not hurt you, otherwise, at least you have to lie in bed for a month, don't even want to participate in the finals!\"At this point there are three matchups left until the end of the game.They are Ling Xiao to Ling Feng, Ling Feng to Ling Yi Hang, Ling Yi Hang to Ling Xiao.Even if Ling Xiao loses all, he can still advance.Therefore, the only way to prevent Ling Xiao from participating in the finals is to seriously hurt Ling Xiao and let Ling Xiao completely cut off her thoughts.Ling Feng did not put Ling Xiao in his eyes at all, especially after defeating Ling Yixue. In his view, only Ling Yihang was qualified to be his opponent in the entire elite hall.Ling Xiao smiled faintly: \"Originally I just wanted to defeat you, but since you are so vicious, then I will let you lie in bed for a month.\"He was telling the truth, but he didn't want to continue to deepen his hatred, but the other party's viciousness made him change his mind.\\nPeople don\u2019t commit me, I don\u2019t commit,If anyone commits me, I will commit an offense!Ling Xiao's words made Ling Feng suddenly angry, this kid is now, and he dare to disrespect him!He doesn't want to think about it, you have to make people unable to participate in the finals, people still have to respect you?Isn't that a fool?The visitors on the floor were also shocked.I thought that Ling Xiao had clearly seen the terrible situation of Ling Feng, and actually dared to confront each other. If he didn't have the real skills, he couldn't explain it.\"It's useless to say more, fight! When you are lying on the hospital bed, I might send some kindness and send some supplements, hahaha!\"Ling Feng gritted his teeth.\"let's start.\"Ling Xiao is too lazy to talk nonsense with Ling Feng, his goal is Ling Yihang.Only by defeating Ling Yihang, he can become the first knockout!Elite Hall first!\\nIn order to really raise his eyebrows!As for the number one in the competition.To be honest, with his current strength, he is not very sure, that Ling Feifan is too strong.So we must continue to hone and improve.Fortunately, there will be a few days of rest after the knockout, maybe some breakthroughs can be made!Choking!Ling Feng has pulled out his long sword, which is still a seemingly ordinary sword, and still makes many people shudder.Whoo!The long sword pierced Ling Xiao with great speed.Ling Feng's body style does not seem to be weak.\"You'd better use your anger as soon as possible, otherwise you won't have any chance!\"Ling Xiao just wanted to try what it's like to fight with a warrior who possesses qi.The previous battles were too boring for him, no challenge at all.\\n\"You are not qualified yet!\"Ling Feng's gang qi is not much, only the true qi of the first meridian condenses into gang qi.So he actually dared not use it.Of course, in his opinion, Ling Xiao is not worthy of letting him use gang qi, and with the great perfect \"Fu Liu Jian with the Wind\" combined with Dacheng's advanced body style, he does not believe that he can't win Ling Xiao.choke!A weird sword shadow suddenly pierced Ling Xiao from below. This change was so fast that Ling Xiao felt a little surprised.Of course, it was just an accident.However, the crowd onlookers all exclaimed. They thought Ling Xiao was going to lose.Ling Xiao was only indifferent, but he reached out with his right hand, his fingers pointed at the tip of the sword.\"roll!\"His fingertips were breathing out, and a sudden shock, Ling Feng actually felt a numbness in his right hand, the long sword fell to the ground, and the person stepped back a few steps.\"It's too strong, just knock Ling Feng away so easily!\"Everyone was shocked.\\nLing Xiao still stood there lightly.Ling Feng was extremely embarrassed.\"I said, don't use gang gas, you don't have any chance!\"Ling Xiao said lightly.\"This Lingxiao, is really a geek!

He thought Ling Feng was powerful enough and genius enough, but he did not expect that he would be steadily crushed by Ling Xiao without using gang gas.\"Feng'er, use gang gas, no need to keep your hand!\"Ling Xian's voice rang.Ling Feng picked up the sword on the ground and looked coldly at Ling Xiaodao: \"With gang qi, all my moves and power will increase several times, you will definitely lose!\"\"The same thing, I just heard it, no more wordy, hurry up!\"If you didn\u2019t want to hone your fighting skills in this battle, Ling Feng could completely defeat Ling Feng now, and not give Ling Feng a chance to use it.After all, the warrior of the triple peak of Wumai, the qi can't use it freely, and it uses a little less. Unlike the four folds of Wumai, the true qi completely turns into gangqi and can be restored automatically.Ling Feng really didn't say anything, his long sword shook, and his qi had already been exerted.\\nA sword pierced.Ling Xiao also just crooked the following head with experience, Jian Qi actually punctured his clothes.\"Quick sword! What a weird sword! Sure enough a qualitative change!\"Ling Xiao was suddenly excited, and he knew that now the \"Bull Bull Power\" alone could not deal with Ling Feng.It is useless even if it is added with \"The Secret of Viciousness\".The secret method of \"Breaking Qi\" is the best at the stage of awakening, that is, the three points below Wumai. Once the Qi is turned into Gang, the effect is not obvious.If you break through the four layers of martial arts and enter the gang stage, you will completely lose your effect.So Ling Xiao does not actually want to use this secret method with little potential too much.Fortunately, after \"Courage of Viciousness\" was devoured by \"Courage of Nirvana\", \"Courage of Nirvana\" came with its own critique effect. No matter what martial arts uukanshu.com exhibits through \"Bull Magic\", it must be two to three percent stronger, which is also good.Pretty good.\"It's a good idea to be able to evade me, but it's not so good luck next!\"Ling Feng thought that he could defeat Ling Xiao with a sword. Who knows that it just pierced a corner of Ling Xiao's clothes.There was some anger on his face, and the long sword shook again. The sword shadow instantly turned into a few swords, as if the wicker had thrust into Ling Xiao from different angles.\\nNot only that.His sword moves are not over yet.Wind willow sword!Liu is a bright move!The wind is a secret trick, but also a real killer!Few people noticed that there was a breeze blowing between the layers of wicker.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

All of this is due to the \"Niu Mogong\" and Shan Wu Wu Hun.\"Bull Mogong\u00b7Bull Bull Demon!\"With a roar, terrifying true energy poured into the double fist, which was exactly the two horns of Niu Demon, and struck the sword spirit of Ling Feng's \"Fu Liu Jian with the Wind\".\"Unfortunately, even if it is advanced martial arts, it is impossible to fight against the gang!\"\"Huh, this Ling Xiao is really not self-confident, it's better to admit defeat easily and better!\"\"Young people, it's normal to be arrogant.\"Many family masters in the stands are not very optimistic about Ling Xiao's punch.\"Go to death! Ling Xiao, defeat me!\"Ling Feng roared, and the rage that had been deflated for a long time in the chest was finally released. First, countless wicker swords hit Qi Ling in unison.\"Slap! Slap! Slap...\"Continuous attacks hit Ling Xiao, making a sound like rain hitting the ground.\"It's not over yet!\"\\nThe wicker sword gas attack was not strong and failed to break Ling Xiao's defense. Although Ling Feng was surprised, it was also expected.His real trick is the wind killing in the wicker sword spirit!\"Humph! Your gang qi is nothing more than that!\"Ling Xiao was a little disappointed. It seemed that the concentration of gang gas also determined the powerful laughter. There was only one martial arts ling feng, which was really not qualified to force him to use gang gas, even stronger moves. No need.\"Get me back!\"Ling Xiao roared, her fists were already slammed against the gust of wind.At that moment, Ling Xiao looked more like a bull demon wrapped in true energy, and his figure vaguely became much larger.boom!First, the wicker sword flew back and forth.Wow!Through the condensed wind, the gang was directly blown back!\"what!\"\"Such a domineering punch!\"\"Is this still true?\"\\n\"Senior martial arts great consummation!

How is this possible!\"The sharp-eyed master finally found the problem.First is the basic martial arts environment.Now it is the advanced martial arts environment, how many secrets of this Lingxiao have not been exposed?Just when they were surprised.Ling Feng was a terrified look.His gang qi has been completely used up. At this moment, facing Ling Xiao's fist, he has no room for resistance, and can only hurriedly use a sword to resist.\u5577!Long Sword was shocked out!Boom!\"what--!\"Clean and neat, Ling Feng did not have the slightest solution. The body flew upside down like a kite with a broken line, and the blood in his mouth spilled a graceful parabola in the air.It flew more than ten meters away before landing heavily on the ground.\\nThis scene shocked everyone!Including the disciples watching the talents.Also includes Ling Yihang!It's really hard and hard, this is unheard of!Where do they know that Ling Xiao's body has been strengthened by mountains, rivers, and martial arts souls, and has become so powerful as to be terrifying, even if a warrior of the same level realizes the qi, it does not make any sense.He couldn't break his defense at all.Appeal -!Withdrawing the double fists, Ling Xiao calmed down the agitated real energy.Although it was said that he was not injured, after all, the first time he faced his opponent with qi, his qi was a little messy.\"This! This! This is too overbearing! At the age of thirteen, can he create his own martial arts? And he wins with his true spirit, and he wins. Such a genius, Ling Feifan can't compare! \"The elders of many tribes stood up.Including the extremely powerful referee.He already looked at Ling Xiao very much, but this battle still surprised him!\"It seems a little too much movement.\"\\nLing Xiao scratched his head, he did not expect that Ling Feng would be so easy to beat, it is estimated that if the opponent is replaced by Ling Yixue or Ling Yihang, it is impossible to win by vigor alone.Ling Feng still missed a lot in this regard.\"Ling Xiaosheng!\"The referee personally announced the winner of the contest.Shock is shocked, but there are still two battles not going on, and the knockout has to continue.\"Feng'er!\"Ling Xianhua turned into a residual image and rushed to his son, quickly inputting his internal force to help his son heal.\"Feng'er, are you okay?\"\"Dad, I lost! I actually lost! How could I lose to that little beggar!

It is estimated that he could not proceed with the next duel with Ling Yihang.But it does not matter, anyway, he is absolutely impossible to recover within a month, that is to say, this year's big ratio, for Ling Feng has ended early.\\nHis cruel remarks against Ling Xiao finally ended up self-eating.\"Sin Barrier! Why do my children and you grievances, actually put this poisonous hand! Cause his meridians to be broken, martial arts torn apart!\"Watching his son carried away by the people in the medicine hall.Ling Thirteen broke out.He jumped on the competition platform disregarding the rules.He knew that the Ling family had rules that he could not kill the children of the Ling family, but he couldn\u2019t take care of that much because of his anger.What's more, you can't kill, you can always abolish Ling Xiao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he just turned his head and left, even with the \"Xiang Yunbu\u00b7Jiao Jiao\", even Ling Xian may not be able to catch up with him.It is absolutely impossible to make such great progress.\"Thirteen Lord, I just stopped Ling Feng's attack. The reason why he was seriously injured, but because of his anger, what did he do with me?\"Ling Xiao said lightly while continuing to refine the true qi in her body.\"Sin obstacles, at this time, you dare to quibble, let alone remember that you are a disciple of the Ling family, I can spare you not to die! But you must be abandoned!\"\\nLing Xing no longer hesitated.Slap directly to Ling Xiao's chest.\"enough!\"Ling Xiao is preparing to use gang qi to fight as hard as possible, but the referee can't do it in time.With only a slight stop, Ling XIII's attack turned into invisible and lost all power.\"Elder! He started with a vicious way, and it hurts me so much, isn't it just so indifferent?\"In front of the referee, Ling Xian had no courage to resist at all. He was angry, and the strength was still divided.As long as he dares to move, it will definitely not please today.\"This is the Sports Plaza! It's the venue of Dabi! It's not your nonsense!\"The chief referee said coldly.His meaning is very clear. It is impossible to do anything with Ling Xiao on the day of the Dabi, but outside the Dabi, he will not care.Ling Thirteen seemed to hear the referee's meaning, and looked at Ling Xiao coldly: \"Boy, today I give the elder face, but my child's hatred must be reported!\"After speaking, he turned and flew away.It should be said that compared to the sinister and cunning Ling Jiu, this Ling 13 is a **** and is more vicious.\\nLing Jiu also cares about Ling Ling's views, and Ling Xian does not care, because he knows he cannot be the head of the Ling family, he does not have that qualification.So he said that he wanted to revenge Ling Xiao, this would never be false.\"Young people, you can do it yourself, everyone is responsible for what they do, others can't help you!\"The referee gave Ling Xiao a light look. He didn't favor anyone, he just told the truth.\"Younger people know!\"Ling Xiao certainly knew what he was going to face, but did he let him show mercy when dealing with Ling Feng?He can't do that.Because the father who feared the other party showed mercy, this obviously affected his martial will.Definitely not worth the loss.\"He actually won! The father who faced Ling Feng was fearless! What's going on, what's going on...\"Among the crowd, Ling Yu, who was originally ruddy and very excited, was pale at this time, almost without any blood.She had expected Ling Feng to defeat Ling Xiao, and then the humiliation she had suffered could be returned to Ling Xiao.But as a result, she fell directly into the abyss from the cloud, completely desperate.Is this still the little beggar who was bullied by her at random?\\nUnconsciously, it has grown to such a point.It is impossible to say no regrets.Ling Yu really regrets that he did not persevere and stayed with Ling Xiao.Ling Feng's waste was really useless.There was a bit of bitterness in her eyes, staring at Ling Xiao coldly, as if thinking of something.Because Ling Feng was seriously injured, the battle between Ling Yihang and Ling Feng could not be carried out.So the most exciting moment came.\"This is the final matchup in the knockout, Ling Yihang vs Ling Xiao!\"Currently two disciples who keep winning streak.The former is the first elite hall, the latter is the biggest dark horse in this knockout.This will naturally attract the attention of countless people.Ling Shuang, ranked third in Tiancaitang, is here.Ling Yun, ranked second in Tiancai Tang, also came.Ling Fanfan still did not appear.\\n\"Oh? It was a bit unexpected. I thought Ling Yihang would compete with Ling Yixue first. I didn't expect to kill a dark horse. It's kind of interesting!\"Ling Shuang is a girl like Ling Yixue. She looks good, but she has an excellent figure. This is probably the reason for martial arts.Her character is not the same as Ling Yixue. Although she is a girl, she is very popular.As soon as he arrived at the stand, he smiled and watched Ling Yihang and Ling Xiao on the contest stand expressing their thoughts.\"Sister, who do you think can win these two?\" Ling Yun asked lightly.\"Not sure.\" Ling Shuang shook his head.\"Not sure?\"Everyone around was a little puzzled.According to their ideas, this result is obvious. Ling Yihang has long learned to turn Qi into gang, and has long been the triple peak of Wumai.At least, Ling Xiao hasn't exposed gang gas so far.In this comparison, it is clear that Ling Yihang will win.\"Yes, I'm not sure. This Ling Xiao is very mysterious. I think he must have other cards. Although he didn't watch his previous fight, the woman's intuition has always been accurate.\"Ling Shuang said with a smile.\"Even if he has any cards, he can't be Ling Yihang's opponent. Can you guarantee that Ling Yihang has no cards?\"\\nLing Yun also said.\"That\u2019s why I said I\u2019m not sure. These two people, including that Ling Yixue, will be the spoilers of this finals.

After all, the real fight is still in the finals. This is just a knockout.Even if it is the first, it is only the elite hall.\"First move!\"Ling Yihang didn't talk nonsense, he just hit a punch like that.This punch is very simple, and it can't even be regarded as martial arts, just a random punch.It's just that this punch condenses the qi.that's enough!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You are proud of yourself.\"\"Say it!\"Ling Xiao said lightly.\"I admit to underestimating you, but how do you stop the next move!\"\"Sky Eagle Claw!\"This time, Ling Yihang used martial arts.And it is advanced martial arts sky eagle claw.He failed to win Ling Xiao in one move. He was a bit surprised and a little embarrassed. After all, what he said was too full.This move is different. I saw his body rising in the air, and in the flick, his right hand showed the shape of an eagle claw, and he directly grabbed Ling Xiao's head.At that moment, Ling Xiao felt like he was not facing a person, but a flying monster.This grasping power is extraordinary, Ling Xiao did not dare to take it hard. After all, the other party used advanced martial arts, and it was still a blow. Once it was caught by the back, even if it was not injured, it would be controlled by others.Whoo!Xiang Yunbu spread out in an instant, Ling Xiao's body sprang out like a dragon, leaving only a faint shadow on the spot.\\nLing Yihang was on the competition platform, and the competition platform could not bear the power of gang qi, and split a few cracks.The onlookers all took a breath.If this is caught on a person, the bones will not break.Ling Yihang raised his eyes and was about to speak. Suddenly he felt the red light flashing in front of his eyes. When he lifted his eyes, he saw red crimson fists.Advanced martial arts?No, this is more powerful than advanced martial arts!Close to the power of top martial arts!Furious punch!Almost instantly arrived in front of Ling Yihang.\"I haven't said anything!\"Accompanied by Ling Xiao's voice, this punch is simply inescapable.Ling Yihang's eyes shrank suddenly, and he found himself really underestimating this Ling Xiao, and the other party was so scary not to use gang qi.It seems that you have to show your true skills, otherwise today will be shameful.His second move actually used only 50% of his skill.\"Get out of here!\"No disciple in an elite hall can force him to this point!\\nLing Yixue will not work!With a grudge, he instantly improved his skill to 70%.It is still unwilling to expose its full strength.It was also a punch. Ling Yihang's punch was equally domineering, and then directly hit Ling Xiao's fist.\"It's you who should go!\"boom!Without any suspense, Ling Yihang flew out in a hurry, blood spewed out of his mouth, and several heels were continuously turned in the air before his body fell to the ground.\"you!\"Ling Yihang looked at Ling Xiao on the competition platform in shock.\"You actually condensed gang qi! And so powerful!\"He miscalculated, he only used seven success forces, but Ling Xiao's last punch directly used ten success forces.Between this trade-off, Ling Yihang will naturally lose miserably.\"Concession!\"Ling Xiao was actually uncomfortable this time.Although I won, I was exhausted and my body was uncomfortable.To be honest, in the face of Ling Yihang, who has broken through the fourfold of Wumai, he won a luck.\\nBut if you win, you win!\"you lose.\"Ling Xiao said lightly.\"How could he also understand turning Qi into Gang, and it is obviously much stronger than Ling Feng, second only to Ling Yihang!\"The referee also stood up in shock again.Ling Xiao brought him too many surprises.First, the basic martial arts entered the realm.Then came \"Xiang Yunbu\".Afterwards it was really angry.Now it is almost all three martial arts all condensed and completely attacked by the gang.This is too fierce!Ling Yihang's defeat was really unwilling and unconvincing, but he was much better than Ling Feng in the end.He took a deep breath and said: \"I admit that I lost, but lost to the enemy. This time I was not happy. I hope that in the finals, we can make a good decision!\"After speaking, he turned around and left without any pause.Everyone who knows him knows that he must have practiced. This defeat is a shame for him. He will definitely get back in the finals.\"Ling Yihang against Ling Xiao, Ling Xiao wins!\"\\nThe excited referee only thought of announcing the result at this time.\"God, Ling Xiao actually won!\"\"It's really unexpected that Ling Yihang, who has been promoted to the awakening stage, is actually not the opponent of Ling Xiao. How terrifying this Ling Xiao is!\"\"Yeah, it looks like this year's Finals looks good!\"\"I don't know how far this dark horse can go!\"\"This **** is a leapfrog challenge. It's awesome. I've only heard of it before, but I have never seen it!\"\"Dark horse defeated the elite hall's first genius, first master, and now the elite hall's first, is Ling Xiao?\"\"Yeah! That's too good!\"Although the knockout is completely over, the scene is boiling like a volcanic eruption.Ling Xiao defeated Ling Yihang, which seemed impossible to many people, but he did it.Ling Yixue was also very excited. She stood there, unable to calm down for a long time.About half a month ago, Ling Xiao was just a martial arts warrior, and now she has surpassed her!Without having to fight at all, she knew she was definitely not Ling Xiao's opponent.In terms of quantity and quality, she is not as good as Ling Xiao.Ling Yu even spit out blood with anger.why!\\nwhy!Why can this little beggar become so strong!Elite Hall first!Even if Ling Xiao stopped at the finals, he has successfully created a miracle!This taste makes Ling Yu feel uncomfortable!Uncomfortable!\"Ling Xiao! Ling Xiao!\"Off the field, Zhen Tian's shouts rang out, and Ling Xiao, who maintained a winning record in the knockout games, really climbed to a terrifying level of popularity.Ling Yihang, Ling Yixue and Ling Feng were all covered.After all, the dark horse is something many people are happy to say.After all, most people are ordinary people, they are eager to see someone break through the shackles and break the rules!So there is no doubt that UU reads www. uukanshu. Ling Xiao, who was bullied by com half a month ago, has now risen strongly and has become their idol.Elite Hall first, absolutely deserved!Ling Xiao walked down the competition platform, and the people underneath automatically gave way to him.This is a worship and awe of the hero!Ling Tie's hands revealed anger and despair, his clenched fists finally loosened.\\nWhat about anger, Ling Xiao's terrifying strength and promotion speed have made him desperate.Ling Chong was trembling with fright.He never dreamed that Ling Xiao would be as strong as it is today, and even Ling Yihang could be defeated!Ling Fei laughed bitterly and said to himself: \"Fortunately, I didn't trouble him later, otherwise it would be miserable.\"Since he lost to Ling Xiao in light skill, he really didn't do anything excessive, and secretly rejoiced.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although he was a poor man, he had a real affection for Ling Yixue.Soon, the referees announced the ranking of this knockout.There is no doubt that Ling Xiao, who finally advanced with a victory record, will definitely be the first.First place: Ling XiaoSecond place: Ling YihangThird place: Ling FengFourth place: Ling YixueFifth place: Ling Tie\\nSixth place: Ling Cheng...Although Ling Feng was unable to participate in the game with his back, he lost two games because he was at the end.But even this does not make any sense, because Ling Feng's injury is too serious, and there is only a week's rest during the finals.Ling Feng is absolutely impossible to have the opportunity to participate in the finals.Unless it is a panacea.For this first, it is impossible to say unhappy.But Ling Xiao was not too excited.He knows very well that this number one is really insignificant. If it can win the number one in the next finals, that is the key!But even so, compared with half a month ago, he just hoped to be eligible to participate in the annual competition, this progress is really too great.At that time, where did you dare to think that the elite hall was the first?Undoubtedly, all this stems from the awakening of Wuhe Soul.The special abilities currently possessed by Shan Wu Wu Hun are analysis, drill, and production.But he always feels that this Wuhun is not that simple. At present, Wushan Soul is only upgraded to level 3, if there is another level, will there be new features?\\nMost definitely!Ling Xiao absolutely believes that the magic of mountains, rivers and martial arts souls only touches the edge. It is far away from the full use.When the knockout ranking was announced, the disciples in the genius hall in the stands couldn't help but discuss it.\"Huh, isn't it that the disciples in this elite are very powerful, but I don't think it's worth mentioning except Ling Yihang and Ling Xiao!\"Ling Zhan said disdainfully.\"Hee hee, don't underestimate Ling Yixue, Ling Zhan, she still has hidden means to use, don't overturn the boat in the gutter!\"Ling Shuang said with a grin.\"Huh, but I just touched the edge of the gang, it's not at all a concern.\"Ling Yun snorted, with a little disdain in his eyes: \"I thought Ling Yihang was going to challenge Ling Feifan, how powerful was it, and the result was actually lost to Ling Xiao, waste!\"\"Anyway, that Ling Xiao is miserable anyway!\"Ling Zhan suddenly grinned.\"Why do you say that?\"Ling Shuang asked.\"Don't you forget that Ling Yun is Ling Feng's brother!\" Ling Zhan looked at Ling Yun and said with a smile.\\n\"Fengyun! No wonder, I said why did you match that Lingfeng's name so!\" Ling Shuang exclaimed.\"Ling Xiao! Ha ha, although my waste brother is not very upset, but he can't hurt casually, I will solve him smoothly in the finals. Well, maybe I don't need my hands to use his current strength, It is impossible to win with anyone in the top ten!\"Ling Yun smiled faintly, not paying attention to Ling Xiao at all.\"I'm only thinking about how to defeat Ling Fanfan now.\"During the speech, Ling Yun looked at Ling Xiao, a bit murderous in his eyes.Shan Wu Wu Hun is very sensitive to the murderous induction, Ling Xiao looked back sharply.In the stands, a group of disciples of the Talent Hall looked at him with a smile.There are jokes.Fortunately, please.Have mercy!There is also disdain!\"Ling Xiao, you have to be careful, that Ling Yun is Ling Feng's brother, the second-ranked master of Tiancai Tang, second only to Ling Feifan in strength!\"Ling Yixue next to him frowned.\"He is Ling Yun?\"\\nLing Xiao looked at Ling Yun and could obviously feel the huge pressure from the other party.\"The four peaks of Wumai!\"There is not much information about Ling Yun analyzed by Wu He, but the strength is clearly analyzed.Ling Yun is thin and should not be a powerful warrior. He is good at using swords, and he is following the way of fast swords.\"Oh? I am not afraid of my sword!\"Ling Xiao is analyzing Ling Yun, and Ling Yun is also looking at Ling Xiao. To Ling Yun's surprise, Ling Xiao is not afraid of his sword intention.You must know that Jianyi is difficult to comprehend. The entire Ling family, the one who comprehends Jianyi, is only Lingyun.But Ling Xiao was not afraid, which made him annoyed.\"Ling Xiao, don't look at Ling Yun is just Wumai's four-fold peak cultivation practice. He can easily defeat Wumai's five-fold ordinary masters with his sword. Not only can you leapfrog, he can also!\"Ling Yixue was worried that Ling Xiao didn't know the depth, to provoke Ling Yun, and quickly lowered his voice and said.\"Jianyi? Something interesting!\"Ling Xiao certainly knows what the sword intention is, it is something that has been entangled with Wu Hun, and the awakening depends on the chance.Most people can't awaken for the rest of their lives, and some people realize it early.\"Let's go, you have nothing to watch. After a week's rest, it's the finals. That's the main course!\"\\nLing Yun withdrew his gaze and his sword intention.Although he was a little surprised that Ling Xiao could resist his sword intention, he didn't care too much.Some people are born with strong willpower, and it is normal not to be afraid of sword.Even without relying on Jianyi, he could easily defeat Ling Xiao.So no need to care.Ling Xiao also looked back.It seems that the improvement of strength is imminent.The top ten in Tiancaitang are all Wumai quadruple warriors, especially the second, third and fourth. They are actually Wumai quadruple peak warriors.And Ling Lingfan, because I haven't seen it before, so I don't know the strength.But I think it will definitely not be weaker than the latter ones.Ling Xiao wants to defeat these people with current strength, it is almost impossible, must break through!Genius is a genius, but not only because of strength, these people must have their own specialties, look down on them, absolutely can not eat good fruit.\"Sister Yixue, I'll say goodbye first!\"Ling Xiao had an idea in her heart, so she was not willing to waste time.\\nIn terms of his current strength, it should not be a problem to get into the top ten of Tiancaitang. He has absolute confidence in this.But to beat the top four, the difficulty is greater.If you want to enter the top three, this is definitely not the case.Don't even think about the first.He once heard people say that Ling Feifan was alone in fighting Lingyun, Lingshuang and Lingzhan, and he did not fall.This was still last year.I don\u2019t know how strong that guy is this year~www.novelbuddy.com~He doesn\u2019t think that Ling Feifan, known as the first genius of the Ling family, will stop and wait for others to chase.Seven days later is the day when the finals begin.Ling Xiao will not force herself to defeat Ling Feifan, that's a bit tall.His goal now is to fight for three guarantees!The first goal, keep the top three!There is no doubt that he knows exactly what it means to get the top three.He actually has too few attacks and defenses now.There are not many ways to improve cultivation.\\nSo top martial arts are a must!At least the top three are required to qualify for the \"top martial arts\" option.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 Realm breakthroughPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?Top martial arts is also top martial arts!It belongs to the top of ordinary martial arts!Under the extraordinary martial arts, there is no martial arts comparable to it.If Ling Xiao wants to progress faster and wants to become stronger, it is impossible without top martial arts.He also found out now that \"Niu Mogong\" is not an internal skill mentality, nor a martial art. It is more like an auxiliary martial art.Can enhance the power of other martial arts, even the level.If you want to continue the evolution of \"Bull Magic Gong\" and obtain more attack methods, the best way is to learn higher-level martial arts and then use \"Bull Magic Gong\" to devour it.For example, his basic martial arts, \"Natural Bull Power\", can now exert the power of advanced martial arts.The advanced martial arts \"Meteor Fist\", after being devoured, is twice as powerful as the general advanced martial arts. Although it still does not reach the level of top martial arts, it is already quite powerful.If the top martial arts were devoured, what kind of chemical reaction would happen?\\nWill \"Bull Mogong\" continue to evolve?Ling Xiao is looking forward to it.So fighting for one and three is his current goal.Thinking so, Ling Xiao went home.When I arrived at the door, I suddenly heard the bustling sound inside. I was shocked. When he entered the house, he realized that Grandpa Hong Qi was being surrounded by a group of congratulations.\"Mr. Hong, your grandson is amazing!\"\"Yeah, the elite hall is the first, and he has developed the qi. This kind of qualification is afraid that he will get the key cultivation of the family in the future!\"\"I can't stop seeing this, I can't get Ling Xiao to get a place in the finals!\"\"A blockbuster!\"These people Ling Xiao basically do not know, because the small house he usually lives with his grandfather, there will never be guests.But he was not disgusted.this is the truth!When you are weak, others ignore you and even insult you.\\nBut when you are strong, others only stifle you.It seems that he did not choose the wrong path, and strengthening is the only way to be respected by others!Ling Xiao is not a person who refuses to be thousands of miles away. Although he doesn't like this kind of occasion very much, he still accompanies Grandpa to send them away one by one.In the living room, various gifts were slowed down.Some are very precious.\"I can't think of a good boy. The more time you spend half the time, the Xiuwei has actually been promoted to such a point. Grandpa almost thought it was hallucinating.\"Hong Qi had already overestimated Ling Xiao already.But he still did not expect that Ling Xiao's progress would be so great.The Wumai is the first to the Wumei triple peak, and has almost three martial arts gang qi. This kind of progress can not be said to be evil.\"Grandpa, I will become stronger in the future, and you will never be bullied again.\"Ling Xiao squeezed his fist.Although the progress is fast, but his strength is not enough, he still has to take a break when he meets the five masters of Wumai like Ling Xian.So I have to continue to work hard!\\n\"It\u2019s a good thing to work hard, but don\u2019t be too tired of yourself. The gifts they give today have a lot of clothes and food. I want to send some to the brothers of the beggar. Do you agree?\"Hong Qi's life is better, and he has not forgotten the people who were begging on the streets together.\"Of course I agreed. Without them, I would have been beaten a lot, or would we go together?\"Ling Xiao thought for a while.It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen those brothers, just go and see.\"Don't worry, the finals are about to start, you should concentrate on improving your strength. After the finals, grandpa will take you to see them.\"Hong Qi shook his head.Ling Xiao thought about it, too. After these few days of fighting, he has gained a lot. He needs to sort and understand it well. Time is really not wasted.\"Well, hire a carriage tomorrow.\"Ling Xiao stuffed Hong Qi with a hundred or two silvers.Although there are no other rewards in the knockout stage, but the SLR enters the top 1,000, there will be two silver rewards, but only slightly different.Ling Xiao won the first place, and the reward was naturally more, reaching 12,000 silver.This money is enough for his family to spend a while.\\nAfter giving the silver, Ling Xiao locked himself in the training room, then closed his eyes and began to recall the fighting and watching scenes in the past few days.At this time, the mountain and river maps completely displayed the pictures, which seemed to be a complete re-exercise of the games of the past few days.Of course, the most critical point, he read it several times in a row.For example, in the battle with Ling Yihang and Ling Yixue, almost every game was carefully watched several times.There is no doubt that these two men have more fighting skills than him and are more flexible than him. He has to learn to apply them.His combat experience is seriously inadequate, so it is very useful to learn from others' combat experience and then improve his combat skills.Suddenly, he opened his eyes suddenly.Then another piece of gang qi swallowed it.He didn't sit there and break through.Instead, he extended his hands and began to practice his martial arts.From \"Bull Bull Power\" to \"Meteor Fist\", to \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\", then \"Xiang Yunbu\"!In this process, he did not suppress the release of gang gas, all martial arts used gang gas.He could feel that he was immersed in a very strange atmosphere.\\nObviously it was a person practicing, but it seemed that there was an opponent on the opposite side who played against him.Several figures are constantly being drilled in his mountains and rivers.It was Ling Yixue for a while, Ling Yihang for a while, Ling XIII for a while, and Ling Jiu for a while.The opponent is getting stronger and stronger, and the pressure he is facing is getting bigger and bigger.what--!Suddenly, he roared.The sound burst like thunder!Double fist blasted out with great strength!The picture in Shantutu disappeared.Ling Xiao also stopped attacking and sat cross-legged on the ground.\"Break me!\"The last shackles broke through under the control of his terrifying will.The original stagnation of the qi has suddenly become flexible, and the true qi in the body has been completely reduced to qi.\\nBreak through the fourfold of Wumai!The current gang qi has also reached the fourth martial arts level of 20%.Although the amount of gang qi has not increased much than before, it is definitely a qualitative leap from the triple peak of Wumai to the quadruple of Wumai.Because the body is completely free of the impurities of true qi, and it is completely turned into qi, even the qi that is recovered now is qi.As long as the consumption is not too severe all at once, gangqi will recover slowly.At the same time, the development of the fourth martial arts has further improved his body. His strength has reached as much as a catty.The Wumai triple to the Wumai quadruple, although only separated by one, are actually quite different.The Wumai Triple is called Wusheng below, and the practice is true qi, known as the awakening stage.The fourfold of Wumai began as a martial artist, and he practiced Gangqi, known as the Gangqi stage.The situation is quite different.It can be said that this is a real qualitative change and a huge change in the Lei Yuelong Gate.Having gang qi was once a lifelong goal for Ling Xiao, and it was a kind of extravagant hope.Because the whole body turned into a warrior of the qi, in any force in the Northern Han Dynasty, it would be treated quite well.\\nAfter all, in the Northern Han Dynasty, countless people were stuck in the triple peak of Wumai and could not break through.The distance of a piece of paper seems to be a huge gap.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 Martial arts willPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?Ling Xiao was very emotional.The goal of his lifelong struggle was achieved within half a month, which made him always feel like he was dreaming.It seems that actual combat is still necessary to enhance the strength.He used a gangqi pill before, but stuck in 90% of the places, but after a day's battle, after a trick with the master, he broke so easily.Less than an hour before and after.Do not!It should be said that Ling Feng's father Ling Xian played a key role!\\nIf it were not for Ling Xian to oppress him with terror, he would not be able to explode his full potential under a huge crisis.It is precisely because of Ling Xia's oppression and threat that Ling Xiao has a strong sense of urgency to improve his strength.Coupled with other factors, it was natural.Actually speaking, he had to thank Ling Xing well.Now he has reached the four levels of Wumai, with \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Meteor Sha Fist\" which is almost close to top martial arts, plus \"Xiang Yunbu\u00b7Hua Jiao\".It is not so easy even if Ling Xian, who has five lines of Wumai, wants to kill him.He now has the ability to save lives.However, the template has to be updated a little bit. Before that, it was a martial art triple warrior.However, he has already exposed his strength in Dabi, and it would be too fake to continue to use that template.So he redefined the following, the current template is the triple peak of Wumai, and the qi is more than 90% of the third Wumai.\\nThis strength, in fact, there is also a title called Peak Wusheng!That is to say, in the title of Wusheng, it should be close to the strongest. Generally, the triple peak of the martial arts, after adding the gang qi to the third martial arts, more than 90%, you can get this glory.After breaking through the fourth level of Wumai, Ling Xiao did not stop practicing.Breakthrough is one thing.But stability is another matter.What's more, there are still many things to do to improve combat effectiveness.All kinds of martial arts, no matter how many layers are divided, can be divided into five stages.The first stage is called Xiaocheng, which means that it can exert 30% of martial arts power.The second stage is called mastery, which means that it can exert 60% of the power of martial arts.The third stage is called Dacheng, which can exert the power of 90% of martial arts.\\nThe fourth stage is called Consummation, also known as Great Consummation, which can perfectly exert the power of martial arts.The fifth stage is the transformation of the realm, which is also called enchantment. The martial arts at this stage have no flaws and are flawless. The power can even be increased by two to five times, which is very scary.Ling Xiao now only has the basic martial arts \"Bull Bull Power\" to reach the state of transformation, and the rest is only Dacheng, which is still far from perfection, let alone the state of transformation.He intends to first promote \"Niu Mogong \u00b7 Meteor Star Shaman\" to the realm, so that at least the power of this trick can be increased several times, and the fighting power is naturally more amazing.However, the martial arts realm, from childhood to consummation, can be achieved as long as you work hard to cultivate it. Only realizing the realm, this real mysterious and profound, has a lot to do with people's perception.If you want to ascend to the environment, in addition to your hard work, you have to look at chance and perception.Of course, this is not a problem for Ling Xiao.With Shan Wu Wu Hun, even if his comprehension is poor, he can achieve perfection by virtue of his analytical and drill skills.All it takes is time.This night, he repeatedly practiced \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Meteor Shaman\" to concentrate on improving his realm.\\nAfter all, this move is currently his strongest attacking move.Although \"Niu Mogong \u00b7 Bai Bu Sha Jian\" is also powerful, it is not suitable for continuous combat. It is better for sneak attacks or as a signboard at the bottom of the box.At dawn, Ling Xiao exhaled slowly.Although \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Meteor Star Fist\" has not been able to be promoted to the realm, it has been promoted from Dacheng to a perfect state, and its power has also been greatly improved.that's enough.After thinking about it, he simply spent two more hours, and also promoted \"Niu Mogong \u00b7 Baibu Shajian\" to a satisfactory level.Consummation is relatively easy to improve. After all, the silhouettes in the mountains and rivers are constantly rehearsed and it is easy to learn.This trick serves as his hole card, and there is no harm in being stronger.Taking a deep breath, he rubbed his head, a little tired, and seemed to have to rest for a while.However, before taking a break, he planned to first look at his realm to the four levels of Wumai, and the mountain and river Wuhun had those special changes.\\n\"Analysis drills, production creation, plus a realm template, this is the original ability, and after the realm is upgraded, there is another ability-martial will will!\"Ling Xiao used to think that analysis and drill were two kinds of abilities, but now he found that he made a mistake. This is an ability in itself. Without analysis, there is no way to drill. After analysis, it is also useless.Production and creation are also a kind of ability, but at the moment this ability level is still low, so creation cannot be done yet, it is just production for the time being.As for the realm template, it can only be used to change its apparent strength at present, so that others cannot see the real strength, but the level will increase in the future, and the effect will be unknown.In the end, this new ability surprised Ling Xiao even more.He had heard of the will of martial arts, this kind of artistic conception where the Daoist is not clear, the swordsman has the sword intention, and the swordsman has the sword intention.The rest of the martial arts also have different martial art wills.According to the explanations in the mountain and river charts, the will of martial arts is actually the primary version of martial spirit. When the will can be condensed and formed, it will become martial spirit.However, in the past 10,000 years, although some people have raised the will of martial arts to the realm, but few have heard that the soul of martial arts will eventually condense.Like the martial arts, the will of martial arts has five stages: Xiaocheng, Mastery, Dacheng, Consummation, and Transmigration, which eventually form Wuhun.\\nIn Ling Xiao's view, his current strength is not enough to control the mountains and rivers of Wuhun to fight, so the ability to martial will will appear.It is estimated that Shan Wu Wu Hun is to adapt himself to the battle of Wu Dao will, and then when the martial will will be promoted to the realm, you can directly use Shan Wu Wu soul to fight.Originally planned to go to rest, but seeing this new martial art will, Ling Xiao did not want to sleep again.Generally speaking, martial arts will have two greatest benefits in combat.One is the repression of the will to make opponents timid.The other is a blessing to martial arts.The stronger the will of martial arts, the greater the natural blessing.Ling Xiao's martial will will have an advantage, it is not a fixed will, because he is extracted from the mountain river martial spirit, and the mountain river martial spirit is all-encompassing, this martial art will naturally is all-encompassing~www.novelbuddy.com~ he Use sword, it is sword intention!When he uses a knife, it is the meaning of the knife!When he uses a gun, it is naturally the gun meaning!\\nIt can be exchanged almost seamlessly without any impact.These are all the information he got from Shan Wu Wu Hun, there will be no fakes.At present, Ling Xiao has not determined what weapon he will use in the future because he has not yet obtained the top martial arts.Generally speaking, although a warrior can learn multiple martial arts, it is best to have a specialization.However, this matter will still be discussed after getting the top martial arts, otherwise it doesn't make much sense even if it is decided now.Fortunately, his martial arts wills can be changed at will, which will not hinder his future practice, so it is also beneficial to raise the martial arts will first.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had to feel the following, what is this martial arts will?How to apply it to martial arts.After all, will is a very illusory thing, and there is still a long way to go between possession and real mastery.Two more hours passed, Ling Xiao breathed out a turbid breath.A look of excitement appeared on his face.I used to think of \"Niu Mogong \u00b7 Baibu Shajian\" as the bottom card, but now it seems that Wu Dao will is the biggest card.But that's fine. The more cards you have, the higher the chance of getting the first place in the finals.It's just not enough.\\nAs far as the current situation is concerned, Ling Xiao feels that her attack is enough for the time being, and there is not much problem with the light exercise method, but there is a huge flaw.That is defense.The body is a wonderful thing. The stronger it is tempered, the higher the defense. What he lacks now is defense martial arts.Although \"Natural Bull Power\" can also be used for defense, it is not defensive martial arts after all. It is okay to meet low strength and high strength. It is not very useful.Thinking of this, he stood up and walked out of the training room.Some things can't be forced, he still intends to take a break first, but now because of continuous cultivation, his brain is a little dizzy.Back in the room, Ling Xiao rested for about an hour and got up.After all, the warrior is a warrior, especially the warrior who has broken through the quadruple qi stage of the martial arts. The rest time can be greatly reduced, and the speed of recovery is much faster than that of ordinary people.\"Little guy, someone is looking outside!\"Hong Qi's voice came from outside the door.\"Come, Grandpa!\"\\nLing Xiao got up, washed his face, and then walked out of the house, sitting in a middle-aged Chinese suit in the sword living room.The middle-aged man is about forty years old, has a Chinese character face, and is quite domineering.\"Second Lord!\"Ling Xiao was taken aback. This person was Ling Xiaotian's second son. Wu Xuexiu was the most powerful of the 16 sons of the Ling family.For the time being, Wu Wushun cannot spy on Ling Er's strength.\"Hahaha, you are Ling Xiao, not bad!\"Ling Er looked at Ling Xiao and seemed to see the young man through.To be honest, Ling Xiao was a little nervous in the face of his gaze, but fortunately, the other party was still unable to peep through the hidden role of the strength template.\"The peak of Wumai triple, and the refining of qi has reached more than 90%, it seems that it is one step away from the breakthrough of Wumai fourfold.\"\"Thank you Erye for complimenting, I don't know what the so-called \"Erye came\" today?\" Ling Xiao asked respectfully.He didn't want to cause trouble. He offended Ling Xing and had a chance to live. If he offended this Ling Er, he would definitely die.\\n\"I am optimistic about you!\"Ling Er directly opened the door and said: \"Thirteen-year-old reaches your strength, which is better than Ling Feifan, so I want you to be my person.\"\"How to say?\"Ling Xiao asked suspiciously.\"It's very simple. The old man has sixteen sons, all of whom want to compete for the seat of the head of the family. I don't ask you to do anything at all. You only need to support me when it matters.\"Ling Erye said with a smile.\"The second man laughed and laughed. What can I do to help you with the triple peak realm of the junior martial arts?\" Ling Xiao said cautiously.\"I\u2019m not mistaken. Although you are only Wumai Triple Peak, but I also know that it only took you half a month from Wumai Triple to Wumai Triple Peak. I\u2019ve never been afraid of your potential. I have heard of it, so I think your future is bright.\"Ling Er said seriously: \"Cooperate with me, you will not lose money, no matter whether Ling Jiu or Ling Thirteen want to move you, you have to ask me if I agree.\"Ling Xiao thought about it carefully. Although he now has the martial arts soul and potential terror, but after all, his strength is not enough.If Ling Jiu and Ling Thirteen really disregarded family rules and had to kill him, he could run, but his grandfather Hong Qi was bad.\\nThere is nothing wrong with getting the protection of Lord Er. Anyway, the Ling family will have to stand in line sooner or later. Such a big family's internal struggle is very serious.\"Okay, since Ling Er looked down upon the juniors so much, the juniors agreed to be.\"Ling Xiao nodded.\"Good, happy!\"Ling Er clapped the table and said, \"Since this is the case, I am relieved that in addition to providing you with asylum, you can also get a thousand or two silver training fees from me every month. The rest of the medicine and martial arts Also count.\"\"Also, I know about the construction of your house. I have let them stop building. How can that place be worthy of you? Later, you and your grandfather will move to the house I provided to you. , Not only is the environment better, but also more suitable for cultivation!\"Hearing this, Ling Xiao couldn't help but feel a little shocked.This 2nd Master Ling really really intends to train himself well.Although a thousand or two silvers and a house are nothing to people like Ling Er.But this is sincerity after all.You know, before he was not qualified to receive one or two silver from the Ling family, let alone the house.\\n\"Thanks to the cultivation of Er Ling, if Ling Er needs it one day, Ling Xiao will definitely help!\"He will not sell himself to Ling Er, but if Ling Er is in trouble, he will naturally help.\"Okay! In this case, it's not too late. How many of you, don't you help Ling Xiao move?\"Ling Er said to several people outside the house.This really means just doing it.Ling Xiao did not object.Soon after, he moved into his new house.It is much larger than the house we rented before, and the various facilities are more complete. Not only that, but also equipped with two servants and two maidservants, who are responsible for taking care of the daily life.As for all kinds of daily necessities and furniture, it is even more readily available.In this way, Ling Xiao basically does not have to worry about Hong Qi's life problems.The elderly can fully enjoy old age life.\\nAs far as safety is concerned, no one dares to rush in here unless Ling Er is killed.There is no problem in life, Ling Xiao will have no worries, he can now feel at ease to improve his strength.All this seems to be the cultivation of Ling Er, but in fact still because of strength.It is precisely because of his great potential that Ling Er will value him.In fact, even if there is no Ling Er, other people may come back to find him. UU reading www.uukanshu.com is in such a family, want to be alone, that is the most stupid decision.Ling Xiao promised that Ling Er also naturally had his consideration.At least the strength of this second prince Ling is top among the 16 sons of Ling Xiaotian, and he is also more bold, a bit of Ling Xiaotian's style.Not as narrow-minded as Ling Xian and Ling Jiu.The training of Wumai Sizhong has been stabilized. What he has to do now is to thoroughly practice the \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Meteor Shaman\" into the realm.If the strength is increased by one point, the grasp of the finals will be higher.Another day passed, and there were six days before the finals.\\nThrough continuous efforts, Ling Xiao finally promoted \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Meteor Shaman\" to the realm.The \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Meteor Star Fist\" that has entered the realm has become more terrifying. With a thick gang of gas, it punches out like a roar of Niu Mo and the falling of the meteorite, the momentum is quite huge.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He really wants to try to see what level of \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Meteor Shaman\" in this realm.boom!Just a free punch, a decorative stone in the courtyard was directly broken.This power is comparable to the fourth-level monster that was encountered in the Fulong Mountains.\"Yes, my attack is much stronger than the ordinary martial arts quadruple martial arts. If you integrate it into martial arts will, the power will increase again. In this way, the top three in the finals, the hope is even greater!\"The power of this punch made Ling Xiao very happy.\\nThe advanced martial arts that have entered the chemical realm are afraid that their attack power is not weaker than the worst top martial arts.Hong Qi looked at Ling Xiao in the courtyard, and a satisfied smile appeared on his face.Suddenly he pulled a book out of his sleeve. Although it was a bit shabby, it was still relatively complete.\"It seems that it's time to give this thing to the little guy. I thought he wouldn't need it in his life. I didn't expect the strength to increase so quickly.\"He was about to call Ling Xiao, and suddenly there was a loud noise outside.Ling Fei came in and shouted: \"Ling Xiao, something happened, a little beggar came to you.\"When Ling Xiao heard the little beggar, she thought of her old beggar and rushed out.Outside is a little beggar younger than Ling Xiao's age, only six or seven years old, actually covered with blood.\"Brother Ling Xiao, Grandpa Hong, please go and save everyone. If you don't go, they will die!\"Ling Xiao didn't ask much, let Hong Qi take care of the little beggar, and then flew away to fly, he didn't mean to hide his lightness.\"Xiangyunbu\u00b7Jiaojiao\" was fully implemented, and it was ridiculously fast.\\nLing Fei dumbfounded at the figure of lightning, murmured to himself: \"Compared with him, I'm a frog at the bottom of the well.\"It didn't take long for Ling Xiao to arrive at the gathering place of their beggars in Tianfeng City, a broken temple outside the city.Saying it is a beggar, actually some poor beggars can beg for more food and help each other.When he arrived at the broken temple, the ground was covered with blood, and the body lay flat.\"Gosh! Gosh, wake up!\"\"Radish head! Did you say that when you grow up, you will be my wife?\"\"Uncle Six Fingers! You can't die, I said I will let you live a good life after being rich!\"\"Uncle Luo Guo! Blind grandfather! Shi Dunzi! You, ah--! Who is it, who did it!\"More than twenty people, except for the little guy who ran to the newspaper, were all killed cruelly.For what?Ling Xiao's eyes are red, he has never wanted to kill like he does now!\\nOk? That is\u2026\u2026Ling Xiao noticed some footprints, then stepped on her feet and accelerated to catch up.At this time, on a avenue leading to Tianfeng City, several people were walking with a smile.They all had blood on them.One of them is Li Xingyun, who was once encountered by Ling Xiao in the Fulong Mountains.\"Brother Nebula, congratulations on the great success of the Sword of the Wind, that sword killed more than twenty people, beautiful!\"\"It's just more than twenty beggars, nothing extraordinary.\"Li Xingyun smiled, his face somewhat proud.\"Brother Nebula, now you are not only a strong wind sword, but also your strength has reached the fourfold of Wumai. If you meet the guy named Ling Xiao again, you must take the dog's life.\"\"That's nature. I didn't forget the hatred of Fulong Mountain that day!\"Li Xingyun's strength soared, and naturally thought of revenge.\\nHe didn't dare to do it himself at first, because he was not sure of winning Lingxiao.But now it is different. The Ling family has an annual comparison, and the Li family has an annual comparison.In the Li family's annual competition, he not only achieved the first place in the knockout round with a victory record, but also did not use his full strength from beginning to end.Just went to the Fulong Mountains to hunt monsters, he even killed a fourth-level monster with a sword that made him embarrassed.So his confidence is bursting.On the way back, he met a little beggar who came to beg for food, and he killed himself, because there was a trick in his violent wind sword-the serial sword.This sword can attack multiple targets.With just a whim, he killed more than twenty beggars with one sword.Of course, he did not know that there was a little beggar playing in the grass nearby.He who killed the man not only did not have the slightest regret, but also was extremely proud, excited for his great wind sword.\"Did you kill those beggars?\"\\nSuddenly, a figure fell in the middle of the road, and a cold voice as if from the Nine Nether Hells came from this population.\"Lingxiao?\"Li Xingyun will not forget this face. Since the Fulong Mountain incident, he has been posting portraits of Ling Xiao in the room to encourage himself.\"Hehehe, that's right, I killed it, could it be that those beggars have something to do with you?\"He smiled faintly, with a hint of killing in his eyes.Today, it is considered to be a narrow road, and it is also in the wilderness, but it is a good place to kill more people.Ling Xiao also recognized Li Xingyun.He suddenly thought of the black scarf thief he had encountered on his way back, could it be that this guy sent it?Whether or not, since Li Xingyun killed his loved one, he must die!\"You all have to die today!\"Already got a definite answer, Ling Xiao no longer hesitated.\\nHe could see that Li Xingyun broke through the fourfold of Wumai, but what about that, if he attacked with all his strength, Li Xingyun could not take three strokes in his hand.For others, one trick is enough.\"Hahahaha!\"\"Have you heard that guy said he was going to kill us.\"\"This is the most laughable joke in the world I have heard.\"\"A pinnacle of Wushu, who dare to be so rampant, really laughed.\"\"Brother Nebula, people didn't take you seriously.\"All the Li family's children were stunned for a moment and then laughed, completely taking Ling Xiao's words as a joke.However, their argument suddenly stopped abruptly.Because Ling Xiao moved.Just an instant.\\nLing Xiao took a move and a sword light shot out~www.novelbuddy.com~ Those Li family children who laughed at Ling Xiao were still enjoying the pleasure of mocking people, and suddenly felt their neck hurt.Then his face appeared scared.After that, all the puffs fell to the ground, and the interest was cut off.\"You! You dare to kill them, do you really want to provoke the war between the Li family and the Ling family?\" Li Xingyun did not expect Ling Xiao's sword to be so fast.In just a moment, he was too late to block, and all the people behind were dead.A dozen of Li's children who are triple martial arts, the strongest one is even the peak of the martial art triple, and the sooner the better to break through the quadruple of the martial arts, it is so easy to be killed.\"Kill you, no one knows what happened today!\"Ling Xiao has planned to kill people and kill his mouth.

They are just ordinary beggars.\"Oh, it's just handy, just a breakthrough in swordsmanship, so practice!\"Li Xingyun said carelessly.\"what?\"Ling Xiao froze.\\nActually, in order to practice, he killed more than 20 people?That's a real life!There was a chill in his eyes, and Li Xingyun must die!\"Okay, just come to justice for those beggars, but you have killed so many children of our Li family, I will never let you live.\"Li Xingyun suddenly said his sword.There is no fancy.This sword is surprisingly fast!Ling Xiao recognized this sword, which was the trick in the violent wind sword technique that Li Xingyun used to deal with the fourth-level monsters that day.The opponent is not weak.Ling Xiao did not dare to neglect.He was running with vitality, and his body turned into a remnant of Jiaolong. \"Xiangyunbu\u00b7Jiaojiao\" has been unfolded, and he easily escaped this sword.He didn't use Gangqi. It was not easy to kill Li Xingyun. Gangqi could be used as a hole card.Suddenly, Li Xingyun absolutely cannot resist.\\nWhat he wants is to kill in one blow, not to let Li Xingyun escape, so it is necessary to condense the powerful attack power to a little.Just have to look for opportunities.\"what?\"Li Xingyun froze for a moment. The thing he was most afraid of was Ling Xiao's body style. Unexpectedly, Ling Xiao's body style was even better than in the former Fulong Mountains.\"Your body style has improved a lot, but it's useless. The strength of Wumai's fourfold is not something you can understand!\"\"Serial sword!\"The two staggered their positions, and Li Xingyun suddenly turned back with a sword.However, this sword is obviously different from Fang Cai's one sword. Not only does the gang qi condense stronger, but it actually stabs three sword qi.Sword Qi was volleying, and the branches around were cut off from the back.\"Niu Mogong\u00b7Meteor Star Fist\"!Ling Xiao directly used his current strongest attacking move, \"Bull Bull Power\" can be used to learn, but the killing is still more suitable for the meteor star.\"boom!\"Just a punch, all three sword qi were directly shattered, turned into a little gas, and spattered around, directly puncturing the nearby stones.\\n\"Gang?\"Li Xingyun frowned slightly: \"It turns out that you have also condensed gang qi, no wonder it's so arrogant, but it's useless! Wumai triple is Wumai triple, even if there is gangqi, it's not my opponent!\"Although a little surprised Ling Xiao actually smashed his three sword qi with a punch, even more surprised that Ling Xiao actually condensed the qi.But he is not afraid.The gap in the realm is the source of his confidence.\"go to hell!\"Ling Xiao's attack is not over.\"Xiangyunbu\u00b7Jiaojiao\" is not a body technique specifically for escape, it is more suitable for combat!Meteor Star Shaman 9th Style-Meteor Star Fall!Ling Xiao's speed was so fast that he reached Li Xingyun in an instant.Li Xingyun knew that he could not avoid it, and he could only resist with a sword.\"Hum, not to worry!\"He didn't intend to do his best, because he planned to block the punch and then attacked and killed Ling Xiao in one fell swoop.\\nStorm and rage!The strongest move of the Sword of the Storm was exhibited from Li Xingyun's hands, but he only used seven success forces.In an instant, the sword light flickered, and the sound of thorns stunned the surrounding animals to escape. The wind-like sword gas sprang from the sword body and flew to Lingxiao.This sword is not weak!Absolutely be able to kill the fourth-level low-level monster with one sword.To know that the fourth-level lower monster, but the equivalent of Wumai four-level lower warrior.This Li Xingyun is worthy of genius, his strength is much stronger than the warriors of the same realm.Stabbing the sword, Li Xingyun's eyes revealed a touch of excitement and fierceness.Finally, the shame of the Fulong Mountains can be achieved on a snowy day.However, after a while, his pupils contracted suddenly.There was panic on his face.Ling Xiao's punch is so much stronger than he thought!This is such a terrifying punch, that even before the fist touches the sword, the horrible fiery anger has almost completely burned Li Xingyun.\\n\"Do not--!\"Li Xingyun regretted, he regretted why he didn't need ten success forces.But it was too late. This fist smashed the so-called violent sword spirit with a destructive trend, and then shattered the long sword in Li Xingyun's hand.In the end, the double fist was directly printed on Li Xingyun.\"Buzz!\"A huge roar sounded, Li Xingyun's body did not fly out, but was directly penetrated by this punch, and then hung on Ling Xiao's arms, just like a mutton string.\"you you!\"Li Xingyun looked at Ling Xiao in horror, and finally his body completely stopped struggling, and there was no breath of life.Ling Xiao shook his hands, Li Xingyun's body was dropped on the ground, he glanced coldly, and then quickly cleaned the battlefield.I have to say that there are not many good things on the rest of the Li family's disciples, mainly silver, which adds up to about a thousand or two.But Li Xingyun is different.He gave Ling Xiao a big surprise.This guy actually has a storage ring!\\nAlthough it is just a storage ring, it is already very precious.You know, families like Tianfeng City's four major families, such storage rings are rare, at most about ten.Even though Li Xingyun has great potential, brilliant talents, and children of the Li family, I am afraid that he is not qualified to own such treasures.Who would have lent him?No matter, take it before talking!Every product storage ring has no spiritual brand, and there will be no restrictions, so it can be used when it is obtained.Ling Xiao was afraid that something might happen to him after a long time. Instead of checking what was inside, he quickly left the scene and went to the broken temple.There are too many corpses, and it is too late to bury one by one, and even if they are buried, there are also many beasts and beasts nearby.So unless it is a large family with a banned cemetery, people in this world generally choose to cremate.Ling Xiao cremated the relatives who used to beg for food together.\"You are good to go! Qiu, I have already reported it to you. I will help you take care of the little potatoes, and will never let him get a little wronged.\"Despite the grief in my heart, UU reading www.uukanshu. com but Ling Xiao understands that no one can be reborn after death.He still has more things to do now, otherwise his grandfather Hong Qi and little potatoes may die later.\\nHe didn't want this to happen again.this is the last time!After leaving the broken temple, Ling Xiao returned to the Ling family.If anyone saw Ling Xiao fighting Li Xingyun, they would be surprised that his chin would fall to the ground.A martial arts soldier with three peaks of martial arts actually used only two strokes to kill a genius martial arts with four martial arts.Although the genius warrior with four folds of the martial arts has such a slight enemy, the result is still extremely shocking.Soon after Ling Xiao left, the beasts rushing out of the forest dragged the bodies of the disciples of the Li family into the forest. Only some blood stains and broken body fragments were left on the scene.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For our younger Li family, only his realm has reached the fivefold of Wumai.\"\"Yeah, Master Nebula would have been fine too, but I was unexpectedly so dead.\"\"Big word, hurry up and find these guys alive, to see if there is any storage ring!\"\"Yes!\"\\nAt the order of Li Xinghui, everyone attacked those beasts.Without the fourth-level peak monster, where the beasts are the opponents of the warrior, they were all killed in an instant, and then they were dissected one by one.\"This does not!\"\"None of this!\"\"No!\"Including the serrated tiger, all the monsters' bodies were searched on their backs, and no traces of storage rings were found.\"Is my brother not killed by the monster, but by the person?\"Li Xinghui's eyes revealed Sen Leng: \"Let me know who it is, and I will not let you leave the whole body!\"...At the same time, somewhere in the Fulong Mountains.A strong man wearing a black scarf stared like a beast at the dozen disciples of the Ling family in front of him.These dozen people are all disciples of Tiancaitang, and all of them have reached the triple peak of martial arts, and all of them have condensed qi in their bodies, but they are only slightly different.However, in front of this strong man with black scarf, he was as helpless as a chick facing an eagle.\"This time it was terrible. I didn't expect to meet the black-scarred thief of Wumai's five peaks. It was dead!\"\\n\"Yeah, the other party is just like playing with us. I can't beat them. I can't escape. I'm already dead.

If the opponent is a Wuwu low-level warrior, it might be a battle.However, the four peaks of Wumai face the five peaks of Wumai, the gap is still a bit too big.Even if it was Ling Yun, he would die if he came.\"Let's go.\"Ling Yun just spoke lightly, and his momentum suddenly increased.\"What?

Not bad.\"The strong man in black towel froze for a while, then smiled again: \"You are still not my opponent!\"Not to mention that the black-scarred strong man is the warrior of the five peaks of Wumai, even if it is only the lower fivefold, he is not afraid of Lingyun.Because he practiced vigorously practicing martial arts, defending martial arts, and his defense was amazing. With this state of mind and the martial arts of the six-fold martial arts, he did not suffer any losses.\\n\"Don't talk nonsense, kill!\"Ling Yun didn't talk nonsense, he directly produced the sword. His sword was extremely fast. At the moment of the sword, the man was already in front of the black scarf thief.A sword stabbed the strong man of the black scarf thief.\"Keng!\"A strange gold-iron symphony sounded, and the strong man's body was cremated, without any scars.\"Hahaha, I said, you are not my opponent!\"The black-robed thief laughed loudly and suddenly shot it with a palm.

And with the sword intention, it was easy to kill the black scarf thief at the peak of Wumai Wuzhong?\"Sitting cross-legged in the exercise room, Ling Xiao's face showed a look of surprise.The fact that Ling Yun beheaded the Wuzhong Peak Five Black Peak Thief in the Fulong Mountains quickly spread to the entire Ling family.Naturally, he cannot be unaware.\"It seems that we have to work harder. The top four are all Wumai quadruple peak warriors. Anyone can break through. Once broken, it is really difficult to win with my current strength!\"Thinking of this, Ling Xiao did not dare to hesitate. He temporarily forgot the pain of the killing of his loved ones and turned the pain into strength.Become stronger!Must become stronger!Under the tremendous pressure, Ling Xiao's practice became even more crazy.\\nCrazy cultivation has also made huge gains.\"Niu Mogong\u00b7Hundred Steps Sword\" has also been promoted to the realm from the great consummation.There is a very interesting change in the 100-step sword of promotion to the realm.Not only is the power more terrifying, but the speed is even less, but it can actually control the sword with gas, allowing the flying sword to produce subtle trajectory changes.No matter how fast the line is, as long as the opponent judges accurately, it is enough to prepare for interception in advance.But once a change occurs, the opponent will be caught off guard.Naturally, during the cultivation process, his cultivation behavior is also slowly improving, and the gang qi is constantly increasing.It can be said with no humility that if he is going to participate in the previous knockout, now everyone except Ling Yihang is not his enemy.Even if Ling Yihang did not make ten moves, he could easily overcome it.Of course, this is when no one else has improved their strength.His current strength, but much stronger than before, the previous three Lingxiao, the sum is not as strong as the current one.However, he is not satisfied. What he lacks most now is internal skill and defense martial arts.\\n\"Chiyanggong\" can no longer keep up with his ascending rhythm. Although it can bring him some special attack effects, it is really not enough.His martial arts are at least twice as wide as others, and it is twice as difficult to increase his natural strength.In addition, there are martial spirits that need to be nurtured, and it is extremely terrifying to consume gang qi.Only the advanced internal strength mentality is not enough. It must be top-level internal strength mentality to match his qualifications.Needless to say about defense martial arts, no one would think that their defense is strong.Shaking his head, Ling Xiao walked out of the training room.Suddenly saw Grandpa Hong Qi standing outside.\"Grandpa, are you waiting for me?\"\"Well, Little Potato will live with us in the future, he is very happy, you can rest assured, I will take care of him.\"Hong Qi said with a smile.\"Yeah, Little Potato is more pitiful than me. He witnessed the tragic death of his loved ones.\"Although Ling Xiao killed Li Xingyun, the hatred in his heart could not be completely resolved. He felt that this was not a bad thing.\\nOnly when a person has hatred does he have the motivation to move forward.\"There is one more thing, you take this thing, the little potato let me give you, saying that they accidentally found it on the road.\"Hong Qi lied, and he gave Ling Xiao the broken book he had always brought with him.Of course, this is also a lie in good faith.Some things, he did not want Ling Xiao to know.\"\"Jiu Zhuan Jin Shen Ju\"!\"Ling Xiao was surprised to find that although the book was tattered, the writing on it was not destroyed, even the book's name was very clear.He has heard of \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body\", which was created by a world general in the Northern Han Dynasty at that time, and was the top defensive martial art.It is said that after the nine-turn, Shi unfolds, the body skin is like gold, and the defense is amazing.Not only that, this defensive martial art can improve the internal force at every turn, whether it is true gas, gang qi or something, as long as it is internal force, it can be greatly improved.If you cooperate with the inner power mentality, the speed will be even more terrifying.This defensive martial art is well-known throughout the Northern Han Dynasty, but it seems that the Ling family has no one to practice. I don\u2019t know if it is at all.\\nThis is Royal Martial Arts.\"Can you use this?\"Hong Qi asked with a smile.\"Of course it will work, it's just sending charcoal in the snow!\"Ling Xiao said excitedly: \"Grandpa, thank you. I'm going to practice first. You have a good rest. It's okay to find some old people to come and talk. Now I have a high status, and your status is naturally high. \"\"You don't need to worry about this. The old man in the medicine hall often comes to chat with me. I'm not alone.\"Hong Qi laughed.\"That's good, what I'm most afraid of is neglecting Grandpa because of practice.\"Ling Xiao grinned and returned to the practice room in a hurry.Defensive martial arts generally do not require any comprehension, because this kind of martial arts relies on perseverance and hard work.Of course, some special defensive martial arts need the assistance of some items, and the speed of cultivation will be accelerated.For example, this \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\", it is practiced, one of the most troublesome things is to consume gold!\\nFortunately, Ling Xiao killed Li Xingyun before, and found more than one hundred or two pieces of gold from Li Xingyun's storage ring, as well as a gold inner armor.These things are enough for Ling Xiao to practice for a while.If he runs out of money, he intends to exchange the silver for gold, or simply go to the Fulong Mountains to hunt the beast to exchange for gold.The comprehension of \"Jiu Zhuan Jin Shen Ju\" is not difficult, but it is only relative to the top internal strength mentality or top martial art and top secret law.Ordinary people want to comprehend and practice. It takes a few days, even ten days, to be very difficult.But this problem is not a problem at Lingxiao.The ability to analyze and exercise Wu Shan's soul is terrible.While analyzing, there is an image demonstrating the entire cultivation process for Ling Xiao, and it is absolutely the most standard.If Ling Xiao could not comprehend it in such a short time, he would be too stupid.The martial arts of body-building are generally easy to understand and not difficult to comprehend.In only half an hour, Ling Xiao thoroughly understood the \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body\".Once you get involved, it's much easier to practice next.\\nJust like its name, \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\" has nine turns.The first five rounds are mainly volume accumulation.Including the strengthening of the skin and the internal force.The first turn strengthens the film and enhances the internal force;The second turn strengthens the muscles and bones and enhances the internal force;The third turn strengthens qi and blood~www.novelbuddy.com~ improves internal force;The fourth turn strengthens the internal organs and improves the internal force;The fifth turn strengthens the whole body. The skin, muscles, bones, internal organs, blood and qi are hard as iron, and the sword and gun are inaccessible. The internal force will also reach a different class.It is estimated that if the cultivation reaches the fifth turn, Ling Xiao can at least be promoted from the early stage of Wumai Sizhong to the middle stage of Wumai Sizhong.This is still the case without deliberately practicing inner strength mentality.Compared with other defensive martial arts, \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\" has obvious advantages, he is to strengthen the body in all directions.Unlike some kung fu exercises, it is necessary to gather internal force to achieve the defensive effect.\\nAfter five revolutions, it was a small success.The sixth turn, in addition to continuing to strengthen the whole body and enhance the internal force, what is more terrifying is that it can greatly enhance the strength of the body, and it also has a certain defensive effect on the special martial arts such as \"Clashing Mountain and Bull\".Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, it is defensive martial arts. What makes Ling Xiao excited is the improvement of strength.For the warrior, the help of power is too great.At the same level, when the levels of qi are similar, power can play a decisive role.If you can practice \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\" to the sixth turn, Ling Xiao believes that his strength will make a great progress.However, considering that others will not stop, he will naturally not be complacent. The stronger the improvement, the more satisfied he will be.At the seventh turn, you can train your gold body. When you play the \"Nine Turns Gold Body Technique\", your body is yellow in cash, with a thin film-like thing attached to the skin surface, and you can even rebound the enemy's attack.The eighth turn is even more powerful. The warriors of the same level can hardly cause any damage, and at the same time can reduce half the damage of the warriors one level higher and 30% of the damage of the warriors two levels higher!\\nThe ninth turn, known as the nine-turn golden body, as long as there is gold, as long as it is not fatally injured, even if it is a broken limb, it can be reborn!...Seeing the ninth turn, Ling Xiao was shaking with a heart.This is too amazing. Although it is necessary to consume more precious gold than silver, it can actually be reborn. This kind of state, as long as it does not die, has a chance to live.What kind of state is this terrifying?Really not a loss is the top martial arts!He has reason to believe that as long as he has practiced \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\" to the ninth turn, as long as he is not cut off by his neck or killed by a move, he will be almost invincible.\"Where did they find such a good defensive martial art?\"The voices and smiles of loved ones appeared in Ling Xiao's mind, and he could not help feeling sad.I am still too weak. If it is strong enough, who dares to understand my loved ones?\\nIt must continue to grow stronger, so strong that no one dares to provoke!Thinking of this, the leader took a piece of gold from Li Xingyun's storage ring and pinched it in his hand.When practicing, gold turned into gold powder, and then slowly penetrated into his arm, and then spread to the whole body.Although it didn't feel very comfortable at first.But just get used to it.It was relatively easy to practice in the first turn. He only spent one hour, and he used up a full dozen of gold in his hands.After the turn of the Nine-Turn Gold Body Technique, Ling Xiao observed his body. The skin was significantly stronger than before, and it was like a cast steel.He was a little excited, so he continued to practice.The second turn turned out to be much more difficult to practice than the first turn. It took three hours, and it took a hundred or two dollars of gold to finally make it.This time it strengthens the bones and muscles, and there is also a clear feeling.\\nBut this tenfold consumption really made Ling Xiao a bit miserable.All the fragmentary gold in Li Xingyun's storage ring was used up, which was a breakthrough.\"There is only one gold inner armor left. This gold inner armor is in good condition, almost a thousand or two gold, plus some fragmentary gold objects in this house, it is estimated that it will not be a problem to break through to the third turn.\"Thinking of this, Ling Xiao left the practice room and then ransacked the house.The gold products in this house were left here by Mr. Ling, and the total amount is about one hundred or two.But it should be enough to add up to that gold inner armor.After returning to the practice room, Ling Xiao began to continue to practice.This time it took longer to practice, and it took six hours to break through to the third turn.At this time, Ling Xiao was full of qi and blood, and felt full of energy. Even if he didn't sleep for more than ten days, there was no problem.Unexpectedly, this defensive martial art actually has such benefits.\\nBut he wanted to continue practicing again, but he was in trouble because he had no gold. No wonder no one practiced this kind of defensive martial arts.This is simply the defensive martial arts of local tyrants.Eat gold too!Ling Xiao hesitated for a long time, and simply went to Tianfeng City to exchange all the silver in his body and the herbs and monster cubs harvested from the mountain and river maps for gold.Counting it down, it happened to be more than 20,000 gold.\"Come on, this time it's become a poor egg again.\"Ling Xiao laughed bitterly, there were still many silver twos on his body, and now there are more than two thousand and two golds left, and these must be used to practice \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\".His idea was that in the finals, at least the nine-turn golden body tactics should be practiced to the fifth turn, which is Xiaocheng.This means that he will need more than ten thousand two hundred gold.But I don't want that much for the time being. More than 20,000 gold is enough to train this defensive martial art from the third turn to the fourth turn.\\nIn order to improve the gang qi at the same time and make the practice of \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body\" faster, Ling Xiao simply ate one of his most powerful qi qi.In the exercise room, there are tens of thousands of gold piled up. If anyone sees Ling Xiao doing such exercises, he will be stunned.In the previous practice, gold powder slowly entered the body from both hands.This time it was different.All the gold around the body turned into gold powder, penetrated into the body from the pores of Ling Xiao's body, condensed with the qi, and then continued to strengthen the body.Ok?Unexpectedly, during this training, some strange changes finally took place in the mountain and river Wuhun, and an energy from the mountain and river Wuhun penetrated into this golden powder and gang.Starting from the fourth turn, Ling Xiao is clearly different from others' \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\".His defensive martial arts will not only be more powerful, but also strengthened along with Wuhun.The most bizarre thing is that, after the energy of Shan Wu Wu Soul came in, not only did not slow down the progress of cultivation, but made this progress faster.\\nThe power of Gang Qidan and Jinfen was completely absorbed by his body. He could clearly feel that there was once a strange mountain Wu Wu soul, which seemed to be connected with his blood.Other Ling Xiao did not know, but he can be sure that his cultivation speed and efficiency of absorbing medicine power are much stronger than the average person.This is what makes Wuhe Soul of Mountains and Rivers special.The average person uses the panacea, and it is already very good to absorb 50% of the drugs~www.novelbuddy.com~ and he can almost completely absorb it, without wasting it at all.At this point alone, he obviously took the big advantage.It is equivalent to say that the effect of the same panacea used on him is basically twice that of others.But the effect is good, but the consumption is also terrible. Seeing that the mountain of gold in the training room is rapidly decreasing, he is also suffering from pain.Isn't it painful? These are all his family property.Fortunately, there is no waste of gold. With the absorption of gold powder, Ling Xiao can obviously feel that the qi in his body is increasing rapidly.Of course, the fastest increase is the strength and the strength of the body.\\nEspecially the soft internal organs are in constant strengthening. Some of the hidden injuries caused by the previous beating by Ling Chong were actually recovered this time.I have to say that these golds are really not wasted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In that case, the body's defense will make great progress and you can really be invulnerable!\"After four rounds of defensive martial arts, Ling Xiao was not satisfied, but he now encountered a relatively big trouble.From the fourth turn to the fifth turn, a minimum of one hundred and two thousand gold is required.And his current gold is only about 12,000, even if it is all used up, it can only make \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\" a little bit higher on the basis of the fourth turn.It is impossible to break through to the fifth turn!But it is better than nothing, Ling Xiao intends to use up the remaining 12,000 gold first.After that, find a way to hunt the monsters to exchange gold.The stronger the strength, the better the chance of success in hunting monsters!\\nDuring this practice, he also used the only two gangqi dans in Li Xingyun's storage ring.After a night.Ling Xiao breathed out a turbid breath, and a golden yellow gang gas began to appear around his body.This gang qi is obviously much stronger than the gang qi of ordinary martial arts quartet.After the two gangqi dans were completely absorbed, ten thousand or two golds were completely used up.Although it's still a long way from the fifth turn from \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\", Gang's qi has improved a lot, and it's close to the peak of Wumai's fourfold.In the absence of top-level inner power mentality, in a short period of time, the cultivation will be promoted from the early stage of Wumai Quadruple to close to the peak level of Wumai Quadruple. This has to be said that in addition to the contribution of Gang Qidan, the biggest hero Or \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\".At this time, there are four days to go before the annual Dabby Finals.\"Not enough, far from enough! The four peaks of Wumai peak strength should be able to defeat the ordinary Wumai Wuzhong Wuling, but Ling Yun is not ordinary, he has sword intentions, and is a genius! Certainly have top martial arts!\"He now meets Ling Yun, using martial arts will, the outcome is about fifty-five.But does Ling Yun have any other cards?\\nHas it continued to improve during this time?These are question marks, so this win rate is still too low.What's more, there is Ling Fanfan, who absolutely does not signal that Ling Fanfan, the first genius of the Ling family, will lose to Ling Yun in terms of strength.Well, Ling Feifan is more terrible than Ling Yun!Ling Xiao's goal is to secure three fights, but if he can get the first, he will definitely not take the second.The first attention and preferential treatment is unimaginable and definitely better than it is now.We must continue to increase our strength!Whether it is to break through cultivation and improve the realm of \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\", now we need money and medicine!It's time to go to the Fulong Mountains!Beheading a level 4 monster, even a level 4 peak monster, should be relatively simple now.And combat experience can also be tempered in the process of hunting monsters.\\nIt was a battle of life and death, not self-entertainment in the practice room. The combat experience exercised is very necessary for the improvement of combat effectiveness.Thinking of this, he left the training room, told his grandfather Hong Qi and Xiao Tudou, and then prepared some dry food, put it directly into the mountain and river map.As for Li Xingyun's storage ring, he hid it at home.That thing is too dazzling, he doesn't need it for the time being, it's better not to take it.When leaving the Ling family and heading to the Fulong Mountains, Ling Xiao did not notice that a pair of vicious eyes darkly stared at him.Ling Xiao just left the Ling family, and the owner of those eyes also left the Ling family at the same time.About a mile or so away from the Ling family, this person merged with three others.\"This is a deposit, a total of ten thousand or two gold! Three pieces of gangqi pill! After that, we will give you the remaining four thousand two gold!\"The man took out a storage ring and handed the gold to the three people on the opposite side.The three men were wearing black towels. They were obviously very active black scarf thieves in the Fulong Mountains.\"Hahaha, rest assured, use people's money and people to eliminate disasters, not to mention that the kid who killed us before, this time is just revenge!\"\\nAfter all, one of the three black-scarred thieves put both gold and Gang Qidan into his storage ring, and turned and chased towards Ling Xiao....Entering the Xiaolong of the Fulong Mountain Range, \"Xiangyunbu Huajiao\" was displayed without reservation.His body seemed to turn into a dragon, hovering and flying in the jungle, and he was able to stay in the air.That is not the realm of light merit, but flying.At present, Ling Xiao's \"Xiang Yun Bu\u00b7Hua Jiao\" has been cultivated to the state of the Great Consummation, and then upwards, or it has entered the realm of transformation.Either that is to evolve again.However, it is no longer possible to evolve \"Xiang Yunbu\" by simply relying on advanced body techniques. It must be top-level body skills to be able to evolve.So for the time being, we can only develop in the direction of environmental change.When I was at home, I couldn't open it, but in the Fulong Mountains, there were not so many scruples.Hurrying itself is the constant training and improvement of body style.\\nWhoo!Whoo!In the forest, Ling Xiao's speed is really not inferior to those of the birds, the only thing that may not be as good is the height.He is currently flying to a height of 20-30 meters at most.And even if you fly, you can only stay in the air for a quarter of an hour, and then you have to find a place to borrow.But even so, this feeling of freedom soaring is still very exciting.His current strength is nothing more than Wu Mai's fourfold, \"Xiang Yunbu\" is already so powerful, if the strength is promoted to Wumai Jiuzhong.Or \"Xiang Yunbu\" has evolved further, could it really make the clouds fly, soar freely between the heavens and the sky?For the future, Ling Xiao is full of expectations.Since he had Wuhe Soul, his self-confidence has also increased day by day.Although I didn't want to give up my efforts before, but when I couldn't see hope, it was really painful.\\nThis is not the case today. The future is bright. All you need to do is work hard!In less than half an hour, Ling Xiao arrived at the destination, which is the edge of the Fulong Mountain Range, a little bit more inside than before.After all, this time the strength has been improved. If you want to hunt the fourth-level peak monster, it is too easy to meet.In the distance, the roaring and roaring of the beast came from time to time in the Fulong Mountain Range, and the human scalp was numb.In Tianfeng City, no one knows exactly what the Fulong Mountains stretch out.I only know that the more you go inside, the higher the level of the monster is, the more terrifying it is.At the core of the Fulong Mountains, there is a **** dragon!Although Ling Xiao wanted to go in and look at the situation, he still had self-knowledge. Now this strength has entered the depths of the Fulong Mountains. UU is reading www.uukanshu. comm is pure death.However, it's no problem to walk a little bit inward on the edge.He was not interested in the beast passing by.His goal is just a monster!\\nQingfeng Jian has been taken out of the mountains and rivers by him, and he is carrying it behind his back for easy use at any time.Previously in Dabi, he didn't take out the Qingfeng Sword, mainly because this thing is a fine sword, which is easy to attract eye-catching.Fortunately, even if he defeated Ling Yihang in the end, he did not use the hundred-step flying sword technique, so this secret was naturally preserved.There is no need to keep secrets in the Fulong Mountains.This is a mountain, there is no figure.The display of the map in the mountain and river map can also make him aware of whether someone is approaching in time, so that he is not too worried about the secret being leaked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It is estimated that with my current strength, it can easily kill the third-level peak monster with a force of about 30%!\"He analyzed the power of the Baibu Shajian in the current situation in the range of two hundred meters through the mountain and river Wuhun.The result came to a horrible conclusion.Within two hundred meters, the hundred-step sword is equivalent to the full blow of a warrior with five peaks!\\nWhat kind of concept is that he is just now close to the level of Wumai Four-level Peak Warrior, but this attack can reach the full blow of Wumai Five-level Peak Warrior.In this way, let alone the driver's peak monster, even if it is a level five monster, as long as it is not too strong, it should be able to win.Just be careful.Flying sword attack requires suddenness and explosive power. If it is predicted by others in advance, the power is not so great.Thinking of this, Ling Xiao casually threw the monster's body into the mountains and rivers.Then move on and look for prey.The third-level monster is still too cheap. This time he is looking for the fourth-level monster, preferably the fourth-level peak monster, so that more gold can be exchanged.Of course, you can also try it when you encounter level 5 monsters.\"Well, someone came over?\"After killing more than ten third-level monsters in a row, Ling Xiao frowned.The mountain and river chart shows that there are actually three living bodies approaching quickly.\"Passing? Or is it for me?\"Ling Xiao did not want to take risks, so he chose to hide and look at the situation first.Three life forms finally appeared.\\nThree black scarf thieves.One of them is the chunky old man.The other is a tall man.There is also a demon woman.\"What about people?\"\"Did you find that we hid it?\"\"Quack, he can't escape!\"He only listened to an extremely unpleasant whisper in the mouth of the chunky old man, and then a turbid gas spewed out of his mouth.\"Cough cough! It smells so bad!\"Ling Xiao was unable to guard for a while, but he was smoked by this gas, and he coughed up.\"Swoosh!\"\"Snapped!\"Almost at the moment when he coughed, a few poison needles shot past. Fortunately, he responded in time and avoided it with the help of \"Xiang Yunbu\".\"Huh? It's actually good to escape the poison needle of the slave's house!\"\\nThe demon woman said in surprise.\"No matter how good you are, you have to die!\"The strong man sneered: \"Employers have long said that this kid is very light, so I prepared something special to entertain him.\"\"Black scarf thief!\"Seeing that the other party did not attack again, Ling Xiao calmed down a little bit, Shan Wu Wu Hun was running, and the information of the other three showed.Two Wumai four peaks, one Wumai fivefold!To be honest, he couldn't help being surprised to see the information displayed.Who is this, so generous, actually sent such a master to deal with himself.The strong man is the strongest of the three, and his body is very murderous. I don't know how many people have been killed.\"Oh, don't the little one run away?\"The demon woman asked with a smile.\"Why run away?\"Ling Xiao has decided to hunt these three people.Although one-on-three may be a little difficult, but here is the Fulong Mountain Range, and he has \"Xiang Yunbu\" and the mountain and river Wuhun, which makes him almost able to handle in the jungle.\\nChange the environment, it is estimated that he turned and ran.But now, the one-to-three win rate is not very small.\"I don't know if you are alive or dead, if you are willing to give up what you have learned, you can be happy!\"The chunky old man said with a smile.\"Want my light skills? Hold me and talk!\"Ling Xiao grinned, then suddenly rose into the air and flew towards the forest.Regarding speed, he did not believe he would lose to these three people.\"Hey, hey!\"What makes Ling Xiao strange is that the three did not chase, but stood there sneering.This gave Ling Xiao a strong bad hunch.However, there are no special displays on the pictures of mountains and rivers.In other words, they are three people, and there is no helper.wrong!Still feel wrong!\\n\"Buzz!\"The tremendous pressure made his gang qi run fast in his body. At that moment, the feeling of blood and flesh connected by Wuhe Soul was more obvious.\"It turns out so!\"Ling Xiao suddenly discovered that he no longer had to deliberately observe the mountain and river maps internally. His body was perfectly combined with the mountain and river Wuhun.He just needs to look at his opponent now, and the analysis data will quickly appear in his mind.The drill is also formed in the mind at the same time.Although it does not seem to be much different, it is actually too much.In the past, to use the analysis and drill capabilities of mountains and rivers, you had to look inside the mountains and rivers, which was a waste of time.It's almost death in battle.Now, there is no need to do that at all, wherever his eyes can be analyzed.Even Wu Shan's soul has changed his vision strangely.Most people's eyes will definitely have dead ends.But his eyes are not. What he sees is in all directions, no matter what angle he can see clearly.Not only that, but now it can be seen through.\\nHe knew that this was not the ability of the eyes, but the ability of Shan Wu Wushun to show through the eyes.But no matter how, under the huge pressure of death, his ability has been improved again, and it is a huge improvement.The reason why the mountain and river maps did not show anything before was because the opponent's killing trick was underground.A huge spider.Standing up to two meters.Lock him down below, ready to break out.He was just wondering what he was going to do with his light skills, and now it looks like it should be a spider web.If the spiders were all covered with snare nets around here, he would be really troublesome.\"Solve the spider first!\"Ling Xiao moved at the beginning of the year, and suddenly gathered the qi, UU reading www. uukanshu.com punched the ground with a punch.Underground spiders are nothing more than third-level monsters. This punch is full of his five successful powers, and he also uses the Meteor Star Shaping Fist.The spider will die.At that moment, the faces of the three black scarf thieves who had been insidiously smiling changed greatly.They didn't know how Ling Xiao discovered the danger from underground, but they could feel the horror of Ling Xiao's punch.\\nThe chunky old man and the demon girl moved first.The two attacked Ling Xiao from the left and right sides.Don't look at the fat old man, but this guy's body is not weak, and the speed is even faster than the demon woman.The most terrifying thing about the demon woman is the hidden weapon, so while running over, several crossbow arrows were shot continuously.The crossbow arrow gleamed with a faint blue light, clearly poisoned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His gangster was outgoing, but he obviously had no intention of shooting.Ling Xiao can be sure that this guy is manipulating the spider.That being the case, it is easy to handle.\\nThe chunky old man and the demon woman are not his opponents, and the black-scarred man is manipulating the underground spider to avoid his attack.In this way, what to do is already very obvious.puff!puff!...For several consecutive times, the demon girl's poisoned crossbow arrows were all shot on Ling Xiao's body, but none of them failed.The demon girl giggled and her body slowed down significantly.\"Poor boy, I thought one or two would be good. Anyway, it is very toxic and still effective. I didn't expect to be in the middle. I said, the boss, this kid is very powerful, but his brain is a bit stupid!\"\"Hahaha, in the face of your poisoned crossbow arrows, even if he is smart, he will be confused for a while.\"The chunky old man also laughed.The brave man who manipulated the spider also relaxed a little.\"No! Kill him!\"In the end, the brawny man is relatively advanced, and his knowledge is relatively high. Although there is a trace of relaxation, he suddenly feels wrong.Because he found that Ling Xiao didn't look any weakened, the punch still accurately bombarded the underground spider.\\n\"late!\"Ling Xiao sneered at the corner of his mouth, punching the ground with a punch.The Meteor Fist of Transmigration only uses five success forces, but the poor monster with only three levels is directly bombarded into scum.Even the strong man's body shook involuntarily, and a red stain of blood oozed from the corner of his mouth.Obviously, manipulating spiders should be through the use of spiritual branding and other things to cooperate with the qi, killing the spiders, and also affecting the body of the middle-aged man.Although it may be weak.\"kill him!\"The brawny man was angry, and the triple peak warrior of the Wumai, actually killed his lovely spider, and it was still under their three eyelids, which was simply unbearable.Ling Xiao seemed to be poisoned at this time, his body was weak, and his breath was weakened.The chunky old man saw his fierce eyes.\"Little thief, come to life!\"At this moment, they no longer want to catch alive, because Ling Xiao is too cunning, and catching such an opponent alive is tantamount to blocking himself.The chunky old man had no weapons, but his palms showed a purple-black color, and he was obviously a person good at palming. Once this palm hits, Ling Xiao will lose half his life if he does not die.However, when the chunky old man approached Ling Xiao with less than half a meter left.\\nLing Xiao suddenly smiled.Meteor Star Fist Sixth Type-Meteor Star Instant Strike.Although the power of this sixth form is slightly worse, it wins fast enough, and does not need too much gas.At that moment, his whole breath changed.No longer weak!Instead, it is unprecedentedly powerful.\"Wumai fourfold!\"These four words have become the last words of the chunky old man.He thought Ling Xiao was just the triple peak martial arts martial arts.He thought Ling Xiao had used all his strength in one blow, and could not attack in a short time.He thought Ling Xiao had hit the demon girl's poisoned crossbow.But in fact.The breath that Ling Xiao erupted at this time is definitely the four peaks of Wumai!Ling Xiao only used five successful forces to kill the spider, in order to be able to attack again in a short time.\\nMore importantly, Ling Xiao did not actually hit the arrow!At that moment, he accurately calculated all the parts that the poisoned crossbow arrows would hit, and then gathered the qi.Condensed all the golden gangles of \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\" to those few points.In this way, even if he hasn't reached the fifth turn yet, at these few points, he can be invulnerable.What's more, although the demon woman is the peak of the four-fold martial arts, but the gang qi is too weak, and the attack is not as powerful as the general four-martial warrior.So it seems that the poisoned crossbow shot him, but it was just inserted in his clothes.It is a pity that the chunky old man will not understand all this when he dies.boom!Ling Xiao's punch, as if an ultra-small meteor hit the heart of the chunky old man at a very fast speed, then burst out instantly.Boom!The heart of the chunky old man was directly beaten, almost without any suspense, and even the screaming was too late, and he was killed on the spot.With accurate calculations, Ling Xiao has done more with less.He now understands more and more what chemical martial arts is.Martial arts does not mean that power is better.\\nDifferent situations, different moves may be easier to use.Sometimes, the speed is faster, but the less powerful moves are better;Sometimes, the range is large and the medium-powered moves are better;Sometimes, the speed is slow, but the power and terror moves are better.All of this requires constant training and comprehension in battle.Because Ling Xiao has mountains, rivers, and martial arts souls, it is obviously much better than others. Even if the combat experience is not as rich, he has already seized some characteristics of the martial arts of the realm.I believe that as long as more hard work is done, future battles will be more comfortable.\"Fat old!\"The demon woman was taken aback, and her body rushed to the ground to stop suddenly.She was scared!Because she knows very well, the chunky old man's melee combat strength is much stronger than her, and even the chunky old man is wiped out by this cunning kid, and he was useless in the past.\"Boss, get out!\"The demon woman shouted at the strong man.\"You're back!\"\\nThe strong man originally thought that Ling Xiao was the triple peak strength of Wu Mai, so he dare to be confident that the chunky old man and the demon girl could kill Ling Xiao.All he had to do was to prevent Ling Xiao from escaping by manipulating the spider.But now, it is clear that the situation has changed.\"Can you escape?\"Ling Xiao certainly knew what the strong man meant, but he would not let this woman go.Otherwise, this woman will definitely be a trouble to fight against the strong man later.\"Swoosh!\"A sword light flew out from behind him, fleeting like an electric light.\"puff!\"In an instant, he pierced from the back heart of the demon woman and pierced from the front heart.\"Old... Boss!\"The demon woman dreamed that she had killed countless innocent people with a hidden weapon~www.novelbuddy.com~ but died under someone's hidden weapon.\"Little thief! You dare to kill my wife!\"The strong man in black towel was angry. He really didn't expect that he would suffer such a big loss today.\\nThree people came, but now he is the only one left.\"Will you only be allowed to kill me, but not me?\"Ling Xiao said lightly.Although he spoke lightly, he was still nervous.The demon woman and the chunky old man are actually easy to deal with.

Although your strength is close to the four peaks of Wumai, then the flying sword attack has reached the attack power of the fifth peak of Wumai. But it still has to die! \"The man with the black scarf said so, but he didn't move.Ling Xiao knew what he was afraid of.Be afraid of your own flying sword.The black-scarred strong man knew in his heart that Ling Xiao's greatest threat to him was the unpredictable flying sword.\"Anyway, I am dying. Can you tell me, who asked you to kill me?\"\\nLing Xiao suddenly asked.As soon as the eyes of the black-faced strong man turned, he smiled and said, \"Want to know? I can tell you! The person who wants to kill you is Ling from your Ling family...\"His voice suddenly became very quiet.Ling Xiao couldn't hear it at all, so he lifted his foot and took a step.\"opportunity!\"The strong man in black towel grinned.He was telling the truth, but the purpose was not to tell Ling Xiao the truth, but to show Ling Xiao's flaws.Now the opportunity came, and his figure also moved.The seemingly sturdy body just jumped slightly, but it approached Ling Xiao instantly.This is not a physical method, but pure power.so horrible.\"Dead!\"Yu Guang, a black-faced strong man, glimpsed the chubby old man and the evil demon woman. His anger was evident in his heart, and he roared loudly, and his hands appeared claw-shaped in the air.\\nNot only that, but the claw turned into a color like steel, and the light of Sen Han even shone.At that moment, however, a playful smile appeared on Ling Xiao's face.\"not good!\"A sword light came through.The black-faced man was frightened and frightened.He is well aware of the power of this sword.Definitely has the attack power of the five peaks of Wumai.Although he is the peak of Wumai Wuzhong cultivation, but on defense, it is only the initial appearance of Wumai Wuzhong, which is impossible to block.Can't dodge in mid-air, can only block.\"Fortunately, this kid's flying sword went straight. Although it was fast, it was still able to stop it!\"After experiencing the initial panic, the black-handed man quickly calmed down.The two claws directly grabbed the flying sword. His attack power is also the peak of Wumai's fivefold.However, he didn't notice that Ling Xiao slipped a contemptuous smile around his mouth.\\n\"what?\"The moment that Jianguang and his claws were about to touch suddenly disappeared.The strong man in black towel trembles, and suddenly finds that the other party's attack is gone during the duel. This is absolutely the most terrifying thing.He was almost terrified.But this fear did not last long.Because at the next moment, he felt that his head was separated from his body. That feeling was too bizarre. Through his eyes, he could see that his neck was actually spraying blood.\"Can his sword change direction?\"This was the last thought of the black-haired man before he died.\"call--!\"Seeing the black-scarred strong man killed, Ling Xiao almost sat directly on the ground.This battle seems easy, but in fact it is very dangerous.If the black-scarred strong man didn't think he succeeded, if he jumped up, Ling Xiao wouldn't be able to succeed so easily even if he could change the trajectory of Feijian.This is fighting wisdom and courage.\\nOne by one.With the powerful thinking ability brought by Shan Wu Wu Hun, Ling Xiao almost led the other person's nose.But the result of using this ability is very similar.He could feel that not only the gang qi but also the soul power were consumed by Wuhe Soul.The state of no-brainer lasts a little longer, and you are too tired.Ling Xiao, who was resting on the ground, didn't even bother to pick up the storage ring of the strong man with black towel.The weakness of the soul can be more uncomfortable than the weakness of the body.\"In this state, it is simply called \"into the soul\". It seems that in the future, you have to learn some secrets to strengthen the soul. Otherwise, the time for \"into the soul\" is too short, and the help for the battle is limited.\"Ling Xiao thought about it and gave himself a name for this state of no-brainer, and it will be easier to use in the future.After taking a rest for about half an hour, Ling Xiao slowed down, and his head was not so dizzy.He walked over and took the storage ring of the braided man with the black scarf, which was also a storage ring for ordinary goods.There are a lot of things in it, including nearly fifty thousand two silver, ten thousand two gold, three gangqi pill, and a top martial art \"Snow Lotus Secret\".Ling Xiao opened the \"Snow Lotus Secret\" in surprise, and thought she could practice it, but she was dumbfounded at first sight.\\n\"\"Xuelian Qi Jue\", the top pinnacle martial art, is an inner skill mentality, and can be used with \"Xuelian Jian Jue\"; close to extraordinary products, only people who wake up Xuelian Wuhun or the natural Xuelian body can practice...\"Snow Lotus Wuhun?The people with Wuhun in this world are nothing more than rare, let alone such a wonderful snow lotus Wuhun, it seems useless.Keep it, maybe it will be useful later.Thinking of this, he shook his head and threw \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\" into the mountains and rivers.Huh?At that moment, a surprising situation appeared.A mountain appeared in the original small village.An iceberg!Many snowdrops grow on the mountain.One of them grows at the top, the largest and the most beautiful.\"Mount Wuhe Soul, all-encompassing!\"The eight characters are shown on the mountain and river map.\\nDon't say Ling Xiao is not stupid, even if you are stupid, you can understand what it means, combined with the iceberg snow lotus that appeared before.This simply means that his own mountain and river Wuhun can contain and breed everything, and Xuelian Wuhun can also be tolerated.You can learn this \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\".Ling Xiao felt extremely excited.He has always wanted to get a top-level inner strength mentality, and now it seems that it has to come with no effort.The strong man with black scarf did not know where to get it. Unfortunately, he couldn't learn it, so he could only put it in the storage ring.Let him ruin him and be reluctant.Now it is cheaper Ling Xiao.Ling Xiao planned to start practicing \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\" now.But suddenly, he felt a dangerous breath approaching.There are three red dots where the eyes go, showing the three-headed monster, and it is a very dangerous Wuji peak monster.If it's one head~www.novelbuddy.com~ Ling Xiao still intends to stay and fight, but three heads, he doesn't even want it, it is pure death.After all, the monster beast itself is stronger than the warrior. The monster beast with the same strength has a terrible talent.\\n\"Let's go home, get this \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\", you can upgrade it first.

He knew that the depth of the Fulong Mountains was more dangerous, and he might encounter giant monsters as terrible as Hercules.But he has no choice.Staying here is dead!Must escape!Since there is no way to escape, it can only be done the other way around, and there is still a trace of hope for survival.\"Quack!\"This time, Hercules did not block Ling Xiao, but instead grinned and gave a weird laugh.That's right, it was laughing, laughing!\\nLing Xiao couldn't care whether the other party laughed or laughed. He had only one thought at this time, that is to escape!After Hercules gave him a glance, he grabbed a fifth-level peak monster on the ground and stuffed it into his mouth, then chewed.As he ate, he watched Ling Xiao running wildly in the jungle with interest.\"This little bit of humanity is not bad, but I can still run away under the pressure of my momentum. Let's play first, and then get bored and eat again.\"In the eyes of Hercules Ape, such information was clearly revealed.Ling Xiao is also thanks to the awakening of Wu Wushun, otherwise he will be like the fifth-level peak monsters lying on the ground today, and he has no courage to escape.Even when Hercules Apes put them in their mouths, they dared not move.The terrifying breath of the eighth-level pinnacle beast exerted a huge sense of oppression on the soul. That kind of horror is not an immersive person. It is really difficult to understand.\"Gam!\"The sound of the bone of the fifth-level peak monster being bitten sounded in the forest. The sound was very loud. Ling Xiao believed that the Hercules Ape was definitely intentional.Because he heard clearly.At this time, there is only one final fifth-level peak monster left by Hercules. Ling Xiao knows that after the guy finishes eating, the next target will be him.He pushed \"Xiang Yunbu Hua Jiao\" to a limit, and at this time there was no intention to hide his strength at all.Hidden strength at this time, that is to find death.\\nHowever, no matter how he ran, he could always feel firmly locked by the breath of Hercules, whether it was turning or evading.To escape.Ling Xiao even took the Gang Qi Dan that he just got from those black scarf thieves and threw one into his mouth.He is desperate.Gang Qi naturally consumes a lot, and Gang Qi Dan helps break through, and it can also replenish Gang Qi in large quantities.In this case, you can accelerate as much as you can without worrying too much about the lack of gas.If you let the Ling family see his speed at this time, it will definitely be like seeing a monster.Even a warrior with five peaks of martial arts can never reach this level unless he specializes in speed and body.However, Ling Xiao did not mean the slightest relaxation.too slow!It's still too slow!Perhaps in the eyes of others, the speed of terror has completely exceeded the common sense, but in the eyes of the Hercules, it may not be worth mentioning at all.The 4th, 5th and 6th weights belong to the gang stage.The 7th, 8th, and 9th weights are in the stage of gas explosion.\\nThe eighth-level peak monster Beast Hercules's qi is no matter in quality or volume, it is much too much stronger than Ling Xiao in the four peaks of Wumai.This is not a grade at all.Look at the playful expression of Hercules Ape, it dares to let Ling Xiao escape, and he is not afraid of not catching.\"Gam!\"The last level five peak monster was also thrown into the mouth by Hercules ape and eaten.Then this guy belched and started chasing slowly behind Ling Xiao.While passing by a small river, he actually lay in the water and drank a few sips of water.Ling Xiao did not look back at ~www.novelbuddy.com~ but his horizon is now comprehensive, so even without looking back, he knows what Hercules is doing.He felt like a fragile woman running away at this time.And that Hercules Ape is like a martial arts thief.The joking smile in the guy's eyes was clearly playing with him, or playing with him.Ling Xiao was not angry.Although this is very unpleasant, it also provides him with a chance to escape.If the Hercules directly rushed to attack, he had no chance of escaping.\\n\"People who despise me will regret it! Including your self-righteous beast!\"Ling Xiao calmed down.He can see that Hercules will not catch up with him in a short time, so don't be too panic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 Hantan Gold LiquidPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?Entering the gang gas into the Wuwu soul of mountains and rivers, Ling Xiao suddenly entered the state of \"entering soul\".The vision at this time is more terrifying than before.At a glance, the terrain within a ten-mile radius has been completely seen.That is?There was a look of excitement in Ling Xiao's eyes.In his eyes, an ancient building appeared.According to the analysis of Shan Wu Wu Hun, if he flees there, he has a survival rate of over 90%.Ling Xiao did not know how this survival rate was calculated.But he probably can think of it.The building looks like a coiled dragon.\\nThere should be something weird.Inside the building, there is a basement, but the entrance is very small. It's okay for him to go in this figure, and it is even more difficult for the giant Hercules to enter.Without much thought, Ling Xiao unfolded his speed and moved forward at full speed. He had to hurry up while Hercules Ape had not yet noticed his attempt.Of course, in this process, surrounded by confusing Hercules, he chose a more complicated route, a bit like a headless fly.However, there is actually only one goal.Hercules saw the unlucky look of Ling Xiao, and then made a smug whisper again.\"Laugh, laugh, you won't be able to laugh later!\"Ling Xiao was really desperate, regardless of the consequences, and ate the second Gang Qi Dan again. Anyway, as long as he can survive, Gang Qi Dan can get it again.Once dead, even if there is no more qi qidan to help.Hercules ape chased behind, but it seemed very relaxed, did not accelerate fully, and sometimes even saw flying butterflies, and would chase twice.Obviously, the full-bodied Hercules Ape is now left to play.Ten miles!Bali!\\nSix Miles!...Ling Xiao is getting closer and closer to that building.Finally, when he was only about a few hundred meters away from the old building, Hercules was anxious.It seemed to know the horror of that building, and knew that the building would block it, so it speeded up in an instant.The distance between Ling Xiao and Hercules was six miles before.But in this moment, Ling Xiao rushed over a hundred meters, and the other party directly rushed for five miles!This speed is really terrifying.Hercules can't fly, but a jump is a few miles away. No wonder it doesn't worry that Ling Xiao will run away, but when she saw the building, she suddenly panicked.Ling Xiao knew that the speed of Hercules was terrifying, but she was still taken aback.But he couldn't care so much at this time, fight.The last Gang Qi Dan threw into his mouth.He rushed out like crazy.\\n\"boom!\"At the moment he rushed out, Hercules Ape also fell to his original position.The ground cracked innumerable cracks, and then spread out around.But the strange thing is that when these cracks are close to the dragon-shaped building, they can't move on.\"call--!\"Ling Xiao, who had completely lost his strength on the ground, found himself in a dragon-shaped building.Although the Hercules was angry and tried to rush in repeatedly, it was finally blocked by an invisible breath.\"Ah-!\"Hercules stared at Ling Xiao for a while, and finally fell asleep directly at the exit of the dragon-shaped building.It seemed to mean \"If you have the ability, you guys will never come out, otherwise I will eat you!\"Ling Xiao had no intention of fighting with the guy at this time.He looked at the dark tunnel in the building.After thinking about it, he stood up and walked in slowly.\\nAlthough the body is too exhausted because of the excessive consumption, but if you lie down at the entrance of this building to rest, it may be dangerous.So he wanted to find a safer place.Besides, he still has the power to fight now, and he is not completely incapable of self-preservation, as long as he does not come with a terrible eight-level monster, otherwise he simply chooses to commit suicide.The dark tunnel can't hinder Ling Xiao.He, who has Wu Wu Shan Shan, can see things in the darkness.\"This building is a little weird.\"After walking for a while, Ling Xiao was surprised to find that the walls of this building were not made of bricks or stones, nor metal.This material looks more like the bones and skins of animals!It's just hardened.More weird than buildings, there are still many bones along the way.Those with bones, beasts, monsters, and humans really don't know how many living creatures died here.It just seems that the age is a bit old. After all, the corpse must be completely transformed into bone, and it is unlikely that it will not be corrupted for a long time.\"His--! It's so cold!\"\\nLing Xiao suddenly shivered.He was surprised to find that, when he didn't know when to start, the tunnel turned into layers of ice.The temperature dropped abruptly, and he had to use gang qi to keep out the cold.Fortunately, the third gangqi pill before was not exhausted, otherwise it would not be frozen to death.About one hour passed.Ling Xiao knelt down directly!Why does he kneel?Because he saw a pool!This pool is breathing a bit of cold, and there are a lot of snow lotus in it, there are one hundred years, two hundred years, even five hundred years, thousands of years!Of course, if only this, he would not kneel down.After all, although Xuelian is the ultimate medicine for alchemy, he is at most happy.The most important thing is that the water in this cold lake is not water!It's golden liquid!\\nHe will not be mistaken. The chilling pool is obviously made of liquid gold. The liquid gold in it is estimated to be millions of gold.Although he is not the kind of very greedy man.Don't forget, he must consume gold to practice \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Technique\".Now that he meets such a weird cold lake, can he be upset?What did you say?If one survives, there will be future fortunes!It seems that there is really no bluff.Ling Xiao escaped from the mouth of Hercules Ape, broke into the building by mistake, and then found this strange Hantan golden liquid.This is luck!Not to mention that this Hantan Jinye is necessary for the promotion of \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body Technique\".It is simply that Hantan Golden Liquid can be bred inside, golden yellow snow lotus, UU reading www. uukanshu.com and there are as many as ten thousand golden snowdrops.In addition, there are a lot of 500-year-old and 800-year-old golden snow lotus, which is enough to illustrate the benefits of Hantan Gold Liquid.When Ling Xiao looked at Hantan Jinye, Shan Wu Wuhun had already started to analyze the composition and benefits of this Hantan Jinye.\\nThe conclusion is that this thing is not only harmless to the body, but also an excellent quenched body.According to Shanhe Wuhun, this Hantan gold liquid is actually a quenching body liquid produced by the \"Golden Dragon\" family.It is this liquid that makes the Golden Dragon Dragon family have the most terrifying power and strength of the dragon family.Is there any doubt?Ling Xiao exclaimed excitedly, and then jumped directly into Hantan Golden Liquid.The moment he entered the Hantan Golden Liquid, his originally tired body seemed to be alive again, completely without any fatigue.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 Blessed by misfortunePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?Gumbling!The moment he entered the Hantan Golden Liquid, Ling Xiao actually felt that the liquid entered his body directly from his pores, and then flowed through each capillary.The cold breath almost froze his blood vessels.He was shocked in his heart, and the practice image of \"Xuelian Qi Jue\" suddenly appeared in his mind.The gangue from \"Xuelian Qijue\" is attributed to ice. I think the coldness should be absorbed.Thinking of this, he did not dare to neglect, and the qi quickly ran in accordance with the operation mode of \"Xuelian Qi Jue\".At the next moment, something that surprised him happened. Those chills actually absorbed \"Xuelian Qi Jue\" and absorbed it, and then condensed into gang qi.The lost qi in his body was quickly replenished.\\nNot only that, when the practice of \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\" reached the end of the first layer, his practice was actually completely stabilized at the peak of the fourfold of Wumai.Although it was close before, after all, there is still a distance, but now it is only a moment, and it has already reached the peak of the fourfold of Wumai.It is not a problem to make a breakthrough to the fivefold of Wumai.But the cold was absorbed, but the golden liquid mixed in the blood made him very uncomfortable.In a hurry, Ling Xiao began to practice \"Nine Turns to Golden Body Technique\" at the same time.Under normal circumstances, no one will practice two martial arts at the same time, because not only will they be distracted, but both of them may not be well promoted.But at this time the situation is special, Ling Xiao can not care so much.As expected, the golden liquid in the body began to be absorbed by the body after the operation of \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Technique\" began.wonderful!It's amazing!Chilliness is used to practice \"Xuelian Qi Jue\", which greatly improves the qi.\\nGold liquid is used to practice \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\", greatly improving the body's strength.And his soul didn't feel the slightest burden.It seems that it still has a lot to do with the Hantan Golden Liquid. Just because it has entered the \"into the soul\" state, the soul is actually very tired.But after entering the Hantan Golden Liquid, even the soul felt as if it had been nourished.It can be seen that, in addition to the qi and body, this Hantan gold liquid can also strengthen the soul to a certain extent.Unfortunately, there is no soul-cultivating secret, otherwise it would be better.But people can't be too greedy, this situation should be said to be very good, it is already his great fortune.He no longer thinks much, but closes his eyes and concentrates on practicing \"Xuelian Qi Jue\" and \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Juice.\"All are top martial arts, and that feeling is different from advanced martial arts.As time goes by, Hantan Golden Liquid is rapidly decreasing, if someone is standing next to it, they will find out.Only about half an hour, at least an inch.\\nBut as a result, Ling Xiao's two top martial arts are rapidly improving.Coldness and Jinye are basically five or five points, so the promotion opportunities for the two top martial arts are basically five or five points.Another half hour passed, and Ling Xiao's face showed surprise.He felt that his realm was faintly showing signs of breakthrough.At this time, \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\" has been cultivated to the third level, and has become a small realm.He can clearly judge that his gang qi has reached an extremely horrible level. In terms of quantity alone, even the ordinary martial arts sixfold martial arts warriors are not comparable to him.It's too horrible for the cold to improve the gang.At the same time, \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\" simply broke through the barrier and was promoted from the fourth turn to the fifth turn.The fifth turn of the \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\" is the top level of this top defensive martial arts, the body is extremely tough from the inside out, can be invulnerable.And Xiaocheng Realm's \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body\" also made his defensive power to the level of Wumai's five peaks, and even stronger.The strength has increased by about three hundred pounds, and is currently approaching one thousand five hundred pounds.\\nHe had the strongest attack power before, and reached the attack level of Wumai Five Peaks, and his defense was relatively weak.But now, the defense power seems to be stronger than the attack power.As long as the \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\" is firmly fixed at the fifth turn, it should be very easy to achieve invulnerability.Of course, guessing is guessing after all, and we still have to wait for the actual combat to know the result.But he didn't have the time now, so he came to this place, and finally got this cold pool of gold liquid.He didn't want to leave so quickly.At the very least, it is necessary to upgrade the cultivation base to the fifth level of the Wumai, and to stabilize the \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body\" at the fifth turn before leaving.Thinking of this, he no longer hesitated and continued to practice \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\" and \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Juice\".Cultivated from day to night, and from night to day.\"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\" successfully entered the fifth floor, the gang qi in his body still continued to improve, but never reached the breakthrough limit.This is enough to show that his capacity to store gang gas is much larger than others.\\nHis current starting capacity has reached the level of Wumai Sixth Peak Peak Warrior.Of course, it's just a lot.But there is also a lot of benefit in large quantities.In many battles, it is not so easy to easily distinguish the winners and losers. The key to the final decision may be to see who has enough gas.No matter how good the panacea is, it is not as good as the body's own qi.After another hour, Ling Xiao felt that the qi in his body had reached saturation level, and it seemed that he could be promoted.In this state, he can easily promote Wumai Wuzhong without any immortality.But for the sake of safety, he still picked a snow lotus about 500 years old and ate it directly.Snow lotus entered the body, and the cold quickly spread to the whole body.Then quickly turned into a breath of life.With such a little bit of anger to protect the heart, even if the breakthrough fails or gets into the magic, it will not be dead or crazy.\\nBreakthrough is an extremely dangerous thing for any warrior. Without Huxin Dan and Humai Dan, you have to use other things to protect your mind.And snow lotus is one of them.Growing in an extremely cold place, life can still be so brilliant, which shows how tenacious its vitality.The protective effect of this thing is much stronger than Huxin Dan and Humai Dan.Without much thought, after eating Xiaolian, Ling Xiao directly operated \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\" to prepare for a breakthrough.Another day passed.night.Many beasts in the Fulong Mountains started to move.A giant Hercules ape sits outside a weird dragon-shaped building, surrounded by the sixth-level monster that was just killed by it~www.novelbuddy.com~ This is its dinner.It stared at the building, and the **** little human hasn't come out yet.It could clearly feel the guy's breath, but couldn't get in.\\nboom!Suddenly, a terrible loud noise came from the building.Hercules abruptly stood up and yelled angrily.Its wisdom is not lower than that of human beings, so it can understand that the human being inside has actually broken through!Although it is still not its opponent, it understands that there must be something good in this dragon-shaped building.His eyes were scarlet, and he punched him suddenly.However, like many times before, it is useless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 6 turnsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?No matter how hard the fist is, not only does it have no effect, but it will also cause the Hercules to shock himself.\"Wow--!\"Hercules was almost mad, and he vowed that after the human came out, he must capture the guy alive, and then asked how to enter the building.It guessed right.Ling Xiao broke through.From the peak of Wumai four-fold peak to Wumai five-fold, and because the gang gas has been saturated before, this breakthrough directly reached the level of Wumai five-fold later, close to the peak.His qi is not much improved, but it is still the amount of the six peaks of Wumai.However, the quality of Gang Qi has been significantly improved, which makes his attack power also increased to the level of the early warrior of Wumai Sixth Layer.The defensive power has also been raised to the level of the martial arts in the early stages of the sixfold.\\nAll of this was naturally told to him by the analysis ability of Wuhe Soul. After all, he is a human child with naked eyes, and he is unlikely to see it so seriously.The scene that had just broken through was frightening even to himself, and actually made a loud noise.Fortunately, there was no accident.However, just after the breakthrough, all aspects are not stable enough, so he did not stop and began to consolidate his cultivation.This martial arts five-layer breakthrough in the later period was hard to come by. He had to stabilize his strength. If he was unstable, once he was injured, it would be greatly reduced.After a long time, the night ushered in the day.Ling Xiao opened his eyes, his eyes gleaming.If someone looks carefully, it seems that there is a world in Ling Xiao's pupils.His cultivation at this time has been fully stabilized in the late Wuzhong Wuzhong period.When it comes to combat effectiveness, it has not lost to the martial arts soldiers in the early sixfold, and the endurance is even better.Now if he is allowed to meet the three previous people who tried to kill him, he can kill all of them effortlessly.In just over two days, his strength has made a terrible improvement.\\nAfter being promoted to the fifth level of Wumai, Shanwu Wuhun gave him a new ability\u2014\u2014Wuhun doppelganger.This ability can use gang qi to condense a doppelganger without self-consciousness, which possesses the strength of 30% of the body.Of course, it doesn't matter.The important thing is that this avatar can integrate with the analysis and drill ability of Wuhe Soul of Mountains and Rivers, and it can perfectly imitate the martial arts used by anyone Ling Xiao has seen.In this way, it will be easier to find a sparring partner in the future.This is the most critical role of this avatar. As for the battle, only he has 50% strength, and basically has no effect.As far as the present situation is concerned, it is estimated that the level of the martial arts in the early stages of the martial arts triple can be exerted.Fighting is not very useful, but it can be used as a dead ghost at a critical time.Because the breath of this avatar is exactly the same as him, and can be recondensed after being destroyed, there is no need to worry about being destroyed.This can be regarded as a life-saving means.\"I have stayed here for almost three days. The finals are about to start. I have to find a way to go out.\"\\nAlthough I really want to keep practicing here, but the finals are not meaningless to him.Besides, he has a mountain and river world, and he can move all the cold liquid and snow lotus here into the mountain and river world, and he can still practice.So there is no delay.But when Ling Xiao walked to the exit, her brow furrowed tightly.\"Damn Hercules, have been waiting for so long, and they are not willing to be powerful, do they really have to wait until they die?\"Although it was very uncomfortable, Ling Xiao was no different.Even if his strength is now greatly increased, but it is basically impossible to escape from the hands of Hercules.Helpless, just go back and continue to practice.Perhaps taking this opportunity, you can upgrade Xiu to the five peaks of Wumai, and promote \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\" to the sixth turn.Thinking of this, he gritted his teeth, and simply backed away to start practicing again.Re-jump into Hantan Golden Liquid.Ling Xiao still practiced \"Xuelian Qi Jue\" and \"Nine Turning Jin Shen Jue\" at the same time according to the previous steps.\\nIt is more difficult for the former to improve after the fifth floor.The latter is also more difficult to improve after the fifth turn.I also have the loss of the Hantan Golden Liquid, otherwise, I really don\u2019t know if the Year of the Monkey will be improved.The golden liquid enters the body at the same time as the cold, and then it is melted and absorbed by the two top martial arts at the same time, and the body of Ling Xiao is constantly remade.In addition, there is a touch of light that enters Ling Xiao's soul and stretches out, constantly strengthening his soul.He can feel that his soul strength is more than twice that of ordinary people.The direct benefit of the powerful soul is the improvement of perception, courage and willpower.Of course, it would be even better if there were soul-like secret practices.Because of that, soul power can be used as a means of attack.An hour!Two hours!Three hours!\\n...With the accelerated operation of Wuhe Soul of Mountains and Rivers, Ling Xiao's cultivation speed is also constantly improving, and every cell in his body is cheering.According to legend, in the ancient times, Mighty had studied the human body and concluded that the human body in this world has 100 billion cells.Every second, more than 100 million cells die and regenerate.The end point of cultivation is to convert all cells into energy cells. In that state, as long as one cell survives, the warrior can die.But this kind of research is only a legend, and no one has really confirmed it.At this time, Ling Xiao can obviously feel that some special changes are taking place in the cells in his body.One cell gradually turned golden yellow, and it became immortal.The most terrifying thing is that the change of this cell directly increased Ling Xiao's physical strength by a hundred pounds.What is this concept?Boom!The second cell turned golden yellow, and the strength was increased again by a hundred pounds.\\nThe third!the fourth!When the fifth cell turned golden yellow, it finally stopped, and the more it looked upward, the more energy was needed, and Ling Xiao was not yet able to reach that level.But only five cells became golden yellow, Ling Xiao increased the strength of five hundred pounds, the power has reached the terror level of two thousand pounds.Unconsciously, time passed quickly, and two days passed in a hurry.And Ling Xiao's \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\" was promoted to the sixth floor, although the cultivation was not able to go further, but it was completely stabilized in the later period of Wumai.Surprisingly, \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\" actually broke from the fifth turn to the sixth turn.The fifth turn is Xiaocheng, and the sixth turn is a new starting point. The improvement obtained is more terrifying than the previous five combined. Defense improvement.And once the cultivation reaches the sixth turn, the strong body is not only invulnerable, but even can be used to perform various martial arts while maintaining this state.Turning defense into offensive is interesting.To put it bluntly, his current \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\" is both defensive martial arts and attack martial arts. It is a bit similar to King Kong Palm and the like, but it is stronger.The only shortcoming is the lack of change, which is still far from \"Meteor Boxing\".\\nBut in any case, when Ling Xiao reached the sixth turn, facing the warriors of the same level, most people could not break his defense.It is possible to hurt him only if the other party is heroic or possesses special weapons and special martial arts.But even so, the damage will be greatly reduced.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 Finals startPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?The rapid increase in strength made Ling Xiao very happy, but when he came to the exit of this building again to check the situation, the expression of joy on his face disappeared.The **** Hercules seems to be hard-hearted to spend with him and will not leave anyway.Ling Xiao hesitated for a while, and finally gave up the plan to break out.The eighth-level pinnacle monster is absolutely comparable to the strength of Wumai Jiuzhong's master. With him, it is absolutely impossible to break out.There is only one result of hard break, that is death!\"Alas, can't you just give up in the finals?\"Ling Xiao is really not reconciled. His strength has risen to the present level, and he is fully confident that he can be the first in the finals.He did not believe that Ling Feifan could be stronger than him!But reality made him have to choose to compromise.\\nLife is still the number one priority, if the life is gone, then nothing else.In desperation, he returned to Hantan again, and continued to practice.Anyway, idleness is also idleness, and we must always consolidate our current strength.In the following time, he still kept practicing \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\" and \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Jue\".Although the rate of improvement is much slower now, it is still much faster than ordinary cultivation.To be honest, if it weren't one day before the finals, he really wanted to spend more time here.In this last day, Ling Xiao basically went out to check the situation after one hour of cultivation.Although he knew that Hercules was unlikely to make way for him, he still had some expectations in his heart.Such a blink of an eye is that one day has passed, and it is already the day of the finals, but the Hercules is still guarding the exit, and there is no intention of leaving.Faced with this situation, Ling Xiao is extremely helpless.After this day of consolidation and cultivation, although he said that neither of the two top martial arts had achieved breakthroughs, they had a significant improvement.In addition, the gold cells in his body have changed from five to six.\\nThis speed is significantly lower than before.But even if one is added, it will increase the strength of one hundred pounds, which will definitely help the battle.In addition, as Hantan Golden Liquid continued to refine his body, he found that his bones had turned into golden yellow, although the blood was still red, but it was obviously more active than before.Originally, he was bullied all the year round, and some of his internal injuries were more or less unremoved. This time, with the help of this cold liquid, he was all cleared.With strength.All he needs now is a chance to prove himself.He did not want to continue to wait like this endlessly, so he transferred the remaining Hantan gold liquid to the village of Shanhe World, and transplanted all the golden snow lotus into it.At this time, the number of farmers in his village has changed to five, each doing his job, helping each other, and being able to do things in an orderly manner.After finishing these, he began to look inside the building, hoping to find another exit.And at the same time.Tianfeng City, Ling's ancestral home.The venue for the annual Dabby Finals has already been set up, and a large number of disciples have gathered here. Today, the family has given a holiday, and everyone can put down their work and watch the game.\\nAfter all, such a competition is also very helpful to these disciples.As the time for the finals began to get closer and closer, more than 100 talented disciples who participated in the finals have come to the scene one after another.Ling Yun, ranked second in Tiancaitang;Ling Shuang ranked third in Tiancaitang;Ling Ling, ranked fourth in Tiancaitang;There were also elite hall disciples Ling Yihang and Ling Yixue who broke into the finals this time.But until one quarter of an hour before the start of the game, two people still did not arrive.One is Ling Fanfan, who ranks first in Tiancaitang.The other is Ling Xiao, a disciple.This situation surprised many people.However, the most talked about is Ling Fanfan.As for Ling Xiao, only a few people are more concerned.\\n\"The game is about to start. Why hasn't Ling Xiao yet come? He will not forget the game?\"Ling Yixue is afraid that everyone is most concerned about Ling Xiao.Although there is not much intersection between the two, some friends really do not need to touch too much.After the knockout, Ling Yixue could be said to have suffered a lot, so he worked harder.Now it is also successfully promoted to the martial arts quadruple.It's just that she knows clearly that the masters in the finals are like clouds. Her requirements are not high, as long as she can stay in Tiancaitang.The 110 disciples who participated in the competition were seated according to the ranking. The first row was the top ten of the Genius Hall.These ten people, in addition to Ling Feifan who did not appear, the rest is actually the worst realm of the four peaks of Wumai.And the top four, actually reached the five rebuilding of Wumai.The most horrible thing is Ling Yihang. This guy was more irritated in the knockout than Ling Yixue, but he was not the kind of person who gave up easily.I don't know what kind of crazy training I have received, or what adventure I encountered, but in just seven days, I was promoted from the early stage of Wumai Quadruple to the peak of Wumai Quadruple.Although the cultivation base is not as good as the top four of Tiancaitang, it is worse than the rest.\\nAnd his eyes gleamed with strange brilliance, and looked at Ling Yun and other people's eyes, revealing strong self-confidence.\"The finals are about to start. Why did Ling Feifan, the No. 1 in Tiancaitang, and Ling Xiao, the No. 1 in the knockout, haven't come yet?\"\"Yes, there is less than a quarter of an hour left. Once you miss the time, you can't compete!\"\"It's a pity, I want to see how far the dark horse can go.\"The disciples at the bottom basically regarded Ling Xiao as their hero, so they paid special attention to Ling Xiao.By this time, Ling Xiao had not yet appeared, which really made them a little anxious.Not only that, even those referees who watched Ling Xiao become the first in the knockout, were anxious that Ling Xiao didn't show up.\"The child has a good talent. If you can come to the competition, you should be able to make it into the top ten. What happened?\"It was the referee of the former knockout that said to himself.In today's finals, he is still the referee, but the chief referee is Ling Xiaotian, the patriarch of the Ling family.\"Hey, it seems that the three black scarf thieves have succeeded, and it's not that I spent so much gold to buy the fierce!\"Ling Xian, who was sitting on the guest table, had a vicious look in his eyes.\\nLing Xiao didn't show up, he thought he had succeeded in buying the murder.But the black scarf thief didn't come to ask for follow-up benefits, which made him feel a little uneasy again.Could it be that they all died together?That would be best~www.novelbuddy.com~ You can save a lot of money....Fulong Mountains, the interior of dragon-shaped ancient buildings.Ling Xiao is seizing the last chance to find a way out of here.At this point, the finals should start in less than a quarter of an hour.But he was blocked in the building by the hateful Hercules Ape.Nevertheless, he is still reluctant to give up the last chance, even if it is a 1 in 10,000 chance, he will have to work hard.There is such a firmness in his character.It can also be said that the Yellow River will not die.\\nBut he can have today's achievements, inseparable from this spirit that is not immortal in the Yellow River.People can't give up if they encounter a little setback, that's too useless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It is not only nice, but it seems to have a special magic power, which can make people feel very comfortable and comfortable.\"Aoao!\"Hercules seemed to be challenged in dignity.A little bit of humanity, dare to warn him like this.It is really intolerable.But he didn't dare to shoot easily, because there was a terrible breath from the little human.\"Alas, why is this necessary, it is not easy for you to grow so big.\"The woman sighed slightly, as if she really didn't want to fight Hercules.Ling Xiao was shocked at this time.\\nWhat a heart for this woman, that is Hercules Ape!The eighth-level peak monster Hercules Ape!The woman seemed to be talking to a pet for viewing.\"Ah-!\"Hercules was angry.No man has ever dared to despise him so much.Before the man was chased into the dragon-shaped building by him and dared not come out, this man should be the target of venting.It screamed and rushed up.Instantly came to the woman.\"Be careful!\"After all, Ling Xiao was pure in heart, and he still couldn't help crying when he encountered such a thing.Of course, he was only a reminder. He knew his weight and could not save the woman.So the only thing you can do is remind.Seeing that the woman in blue was about to be blown into meat sauce by Hercules Ape.\\nThe woman moved.But it was just a jade manual.The jade hand crossed a beautiful arc in the air, and then gently pointed, the Hercules Ape actually made a miserable cry, a strange blue light shot from the back of Hercules Ape.That finger actually penetrated the head of Hercules Ape directly.That's Hercules Ape!Eighth-level peak monster Beast Hercules Ape!It was so dead!Slammed heavily on the ground, the body has long lost vitality.This!Ling Xiao was shocked!What's wrong with this woman?How could it be so powerful!Could it be that the Wumai Jiuzhong Peak Powerhouse?\"Thank you for reminding!\"\\nThe woman glanced at Ling Xiao and smiled: \"As a thank you, the body of Hercules Ape will be handed over to you. Goodbye!\"Ling Xiao stood there dumbly and did not respond.The woman had already left, and Ling Xiao still did not react.He was not tempted by beautiful colors, but because at this time on the mountain and river map, a video was being played repeatedly.The instant image of the blue woman's finger killing Hercules Ape.Although this process may seem simple, after slowing down the mountain and river charts, Ling Xiao can almost clearly see the moment when the woman made a move.For a long time, he suddenly opened his eyes.Originally I wanted Wu Soul to practice the power of a finger, but think about it. At this time, although rushing back may have begun the finals, but the delay is not long, there is still a chance.He threw the body of Hercules Ape directly into the world of mountains and rivers, and then launched \"Xiangyunbu\u00b7Jiaojiao\" to take off into the direction of the Ling family.At this time, he was nearly twice as fast as when he came.When flying, the shadow of the dragon turned into pale gold, and it looked very windy.As for the identity of the blue woman, he did not guess.Although he was born as a little beggar in Tianfeng City, beggars also have the benefits of beggars, and many stories have been heard.The Northern Han Dynasty is too big. Outside Tianfeng City, there are many masters, many more powerful families than the Ling family.\\nThe Northern Han Dynasty is just one of the weaker countries in this world.The world is too big, he would like to go out to see, but it is not now. Now, he must first establish a firm foothold in the Ling family and increase his strength to a level that cannot be improved before going out.Ling Xiao didn't find out that his own strength has improved a lot since then.You know, the Hercules also weighed at least three thousand pounds, but he was able to lift the guy into the world of mountains and rivers.This shows that his strength is not less than three kilograms.For ordinary warriors, when they reach the five peaks of the martial arts, the strength is about 1,500 or 600 kg.And he broke through the sixth turn because of \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\", and his physical strength is about a thousand pounds more than ordinary martial arts.Plus the promotion of six gold cells.The strength has exceeded three thousand pounds.This is twice that of ordinary warriors.A warrior of the same level, he doesn\u2019t even need to use qi, and can stabilize and control with pure power alone.Before, there was a Hercules ape chasing him, so when he came to the dragon-shaped structure, he was not attacked by other monsters.But when I went back, it was different. On this way, there were many monsters and beasts.In order to save time, Ling Xiao can basically avoid as much as possible.\\nHowever, there is a flying monster that is faster than him, and there is no way to avoid it.\"Since you are looking for death, you will be successful!\"Ling Xiao drank coldly, followed the direction of the flight, and bumped into the flying monster.Did not use any gang qi, just simple power to cooperate with the gold body attack.As a result of this collision, the flying monster was broken into pieces on the spot.That's a Level 5 monster.Although it is only a fifth-level low-level monster, it is also equivalent to the martial arts in the middle and late stages of Wumai. UU reading www. uukanshu.comPlus the monster body itself is more powerful.He couldn't stop him from the crazy impact.This collision probably scared a lot of monsters and beasts, and the next road became a lot calmer.In less than half an hour, Ling Xiao had arrived at the Ling family.It was too late to change clothes, he just used the realm template to hide the surface strength at the peak level of Wumai quadruple.It can't be too exaggerated. After all, many people thought he was the triple peak warrior of Wumai.It is already terrifying to break into Wumai Sizhong now, if it is known that his real state is the later stage of Wumai Wuzhong, close to the peak.\\nIt's not fun, after all, what he needs now is to hone his combat skills, and to temporarily restrain his strength at this level, he can really hone.Relying on the realm to suppress people, that can't achieve the purpose of training.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If they are continuously challenged, they are afraid that the possibility of losing is relatively high.The other is that only those with high rankings can be challenged with high rankings. This is to prevent some high-ranking disciples from secretly retaliating and deliberately bullying low-ranking disciples.\\nAccording to this rule, even if it is half an hour late, it will not affect the overall rhythm of the game.\"Ling Yihang challenges Ling Dapeng to win and is currently ranked sixth!\"Ling Xiaotian's voice rang on the competition square. As the head of the Ling family, the top master of the Ling family, he can personally host this finals, which shows the importance of this game.Ling Xiao looked up and saw that there was only one contest platform on the large venue, but this contest platform was obviously bigger than before, and the protective wall was also stronger.It is estimated that Ling Yihang and Ling Xiao destroyed the competition stage during the knockout, which made the top of the Ling family a little uneasy, so for safety, strengthen the protective barrier.Sitting near Biwutai, there should have been 110 disciples, but at this time there were two stools empty.One belongs to Ling Fanfan.One belongs to Ling Xiao.Ling Xiao noticed that Ling Yihang, Ling Yixue, Ling Tiehou and Ling Fei had already challenged, because all four of them ranked in the top 100, while Ling Yihang rose to sixth place.Ling Yixue also entered the top 20.\\n\"You referees, disciple Ling Xiao has come a little late because of some difficult things. I hope to give him a chance.\"Ling Xiao knew that he was late, so he was naturally responsible.No matter what the reason is, being late is definitely not good, so the attitude is more sincere and humble.\"Hey, Ling Xiao is here, the bottom disciple of the knockout game!\"\"I'm going, how did this cultivation method rise to the peak of Wumai's quadruple, and he improved too fast.\"\"It's estimated that you're practicing late.\"Ling Feifan has not arrived yet, so the appearance of Ling Xiao naturally attracted the attention of many people.\"National laws and regulations, family rules, even if you have the best knockout results before, since you are late, it means that you have abstained from the initiative and no longer have the qualification to participate.\"Although the referee is very optimistic about Ling Xiao, he also had to shake his head. If a family has no rules, it will not last for a long time. It must be the beginning of chaos.Ling Xiao smiled secretly. Although she had thought of this, she was still disappointed when she heard the result.\\nCan he not be disappointed, if he gets the first place, he can enter the library and steal books. What he desperately needs is a set of top-level martial arts and top-level soul-cultivating secrets, but there are none at present.He was about to turn around and leave. Suddenly a figure appeared again, directly over the crowd and flew to the top spot.\"It's Ling extraordinary!\"\"What a terrible way of doing light exercises!\"\"The first in the Tiancaitang is the first, so handsome!\"\"But he is late too, can he continue to participate?\"\"Shouldn't it? Ling Xiao can't participate. If he can participate, wouldn't it be a mess?\"\"What is Ling Xiao's qualification compared with Ling Feifan, the first in the knockout is just the first in the trash, can it be compared with the first in Tiancaitang?\"Hearing such remarks, Ling Xiao's footsteps about to leave were stopped again, but he wanted to see what the top executives of the Ling family would do.\"Hahaha, extraordinary, you are late, but it doesn't matter, you are a special one, the rules can't restrict you!\"\\nThe referee saw a smile on Ling Feifan's face and laughed.\"Thank you referee, thank you referees!\"Ling Feifan didn't get up, just sat there and arched his hands. The arrogant gesture seemed to be the first master of the Ling family.\"Slow down!\"Ling Xiao suddenly shouted: \"The referee, I thought you were in the business, then Ling Feifan came later than me. He is eligible to participate. Why am I not qualified?\"The chief referee was also a little embarrassed. He was about to speak, but he heard one of the referees sneer and said: \"What kind of thing do you think, Ling Fanfan is the first genius hall, the first genius of the Ling family is related to the prosperity of the Ling family, Ling The future of the family is all with him. We naturally have to give him a chance. Are you qualified to compare with him?\"\"Not bad!\"Ling Xiao hadn't spoken yet, and another voice rang, this was Ling Xing from the audience.Ling Xian's face was very gloomy.He stood up and said: \"Everyone knows that the extraordinary disciple of our Ling family is specially trained. He has privileges at the Ling family. You Ling Xiao don't deserve to give him shoes. How dare you compare with him?\"\\nLing Xiao frowned, this person is really shameless.He was almost certain that it was Ling Xing who bought the black scarf thief to kill him.He hasn't asked Ling Xian to settle the account yet. This person actually dared not resign. It seems that Ling Xing must be removed as soon as possible.\"Yes, what is Ling Xiao, a low-level disciple, who won the first place in the knockout game by conspiracy and trickery, don't you know that the sky is thick and thick?\"\"That is, there is no absolute fairness in this world. I want to give you privileges unless you win Ling Fanfan.\"\"Hahaha, he still wants to win Ling extraordinary, I am afraid that even Lingyun can't pass the level.\"In the family, there are not many people who are gloating and gloating.After all, a dark horse like Ling Xiao emerged directly from the bottom, but it was not liked by the privileged class.They will naturally fall into the rocks.\"Humph!\"\\nSuddenly snorted, Ling Er stood up.He squinted and glanced at the crowd, and immediately many people were afraid to speak.\"Just before I heard someone say that there is a national law, and there are family rules. Ling Feifan can break the rules, why Ling Xiao is not. If you treat them equally, let Ling Feifan also withdraw from this final.\"Ling Erye once wanted to win Ling Feifan~www.novelbuddy.com~ but was rejected because Ling Feifan was so proud and arrogant that he didn't put everyone except Master Ling in his eyes.And he succeeded in attracting Ling Xiao, so at this time, naturally he was going to speak for Ling Xiao.\"How can the second brother say this, Ling Feifan is white jade, Ling Xiao is just a stubborn stone, how can it be compared?\"Ling Jiu stood up and opposed it.\"enough!\"Ling Xiaotian couldn't stand it anymore. As soon as he made a noise, all the discussion stopped.\"Ling Xiao, I can give you a chance. Among these 110 people, as long as you can win any one of them, I will let you participate, OK?\"\\nAs the patriarch and the first master in the family, Ling Xiaotian's eyesight is not bad, he does not want to offend Ling extraordinary, nor does he want to offend Ling Xiao.This is all the hope of the Ling family in the future, so everyone should be convinced of such a central strategy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Someone could enjoy the same privileges as him.Ling Feifan glanced at Ling Xianyi intentionally or unintentionally.He knew the thing about Ling Xianbu buying murder.The three black-scarred thieves drove out, but actually did not kill Ling Xiao.This Lingxiao, I am afraid it is not as simple as the surface.Ling Feifan touched his chin and suddenly fell into contemplation.\\nAt this time, Ling Xian was in a state of confusion. He knew the strength of the three black scarf thieves the most. He could not kill Ling Xiao in this way. So how powerful is Ling Xiao?\"Ling Xiao!\"The referee chief said in a deep voice: \"Now if you come on stage, there will be a warrior who will challenge you. If you win, you can participate in the finals. If you fail, stop talking nonsense, do you hear clearly?\"\"Listen clearly!\"Ling Xiao nodded.To be precise, there should be 109 people. In addition to Ling Feifan, Ling Xiao has full confidence to win, but the difficulty is different.So he was not worried.\"Then go.\"\"Yes!\"Ling Xiao jumped lightly, then came to the contest platform, and then arched arched hands: \"Please enlighten me!\"Ling Yihang's eyes collided with Ling Xiao, and they smiled at each other.Although it was said that Ling Xiao defeated Ling Yihang in the knockout.However, Ling Yihang did not remember his enemies. He was very free-spirited and became stronger.Later, his eyes collided with Ling Yixue, and Ling Yixue's eyes showed a bit of tenderness and care.\\nLing Xiao nodded and thanked him.The two of them didn't say much, but the relationship has subtly changed a lot.\"Since there is no one, then I will try your strength!\"A moment later, a man stood out from the crowd.He happens to be the fifth in the second row, that is to say, he is currently ranked fifteenth in the Talent Hall.\"Brother, how do you call it?\"Ling Xiao asked.\"Whatever it takes, you are about to get out anyway.\"This fifteenth-ranked disciple seems impatient with Ling Xiao, which makes Ling Xiao a little puzzled, and he seems not to offend this person.\"That person is Ling Ji, he seems to be a big fan of the extraordinary brother.\"\"No wonder, Ling Xiao actually got the same privileges as the extraordinary brother, he must be unhappy.\"Ling Ji is three years older than Ling Xiao. At the age of 16, he is very muscular and extremely strong.He specializes in defensive martial arts, and his cultivation is the beginning of the fourfold martial arts.In general, even the warriors in the mid-fourth phase of Wumai are not willing to play against him.\\nYou think, hitting the other party, the other party doesn't hurt at all, and you're so tired that you are dying, that's not a very happy feeling.\"With your words, I won't let you step down, and this year's finals, you are the end!\"Ling Xiao is not kind.Especially when beggars' relatives were killed, they were assassinated by others.Such a thing made his heart tough and decisive.If you are always the benevolence of women, other people think you are so bully.\"Boy, you will pay for your words! Don't think I'm afraid of you on the four peaks of Wumai!\"Ling Ji faced Ling Xiao without any fear.In his view, Ling Xiao's realm is much higher, but he is no older than him, and his strength and combat experience are definitely not as good as him.\"Hey, Ling Ji shot, Ling Xiao was in trouble. Even if Ling Yihang challenged before, he didn't dare to choose Brother Ling Ji, just because Brother Ling Ji, the top defensive martial art, was so terrifying that he had already cultivated to the level of Xiaocheng. \"\"Yes, Ling Ji used to kill a warrior with four peaks of martial arts.\"\"What's the use of getting the opportunity given by the patriarch? It's not about getting out of business.\"Ling Ji's battle made many people who didn't like Ling Xiao excited.Although in the realm, Ling Xiao is higher.\\nHowever, they believe that Ling Ji's actual combat experience is stronger, even if he can't easily win, he will consume energy.\"Ba Quan!\"Ling Ji uses advanced martial arts.But this martial art is a little special.Its power is added according to its own defense.Ling Ji specializes in top defensive martial arts, and with the power of hegemony, he is afraid that it will not be lower than top martial arts.I saw him punching out, radiating a black iron-like light all over his body. A fist of black was also wrapped around his fist, as if it were tough steel, with a metallic luster.The power of this punch is probably not inferior to Xiaocheng's top martial arts.It's no wonder that Dacheng's advanced martial arts is.Coupled with the defensive martial arts itself, the power does not belong to the top martial arts of Xiaocheng.Ling Xiao was a little excited because the opponent gave him some hints about the match.Just like the set of martial arts he first practiced, the various martial arts do not exist independently. If they are well matched, they can be mutually improved.\"Brother Ling Ji's punch, the power is not small, I am afraid that it will not be worse than the martial arts in the later period of the fourfold of Wumai!\"\"Yes, even if this punch cannot defeat Ling Xiao, Ling Xiao will suffer a little bit, knowing that there is a sky outside.\"\\nThe disciples of Tiancaidang know more about Ling Ji, and at this time they naturally prefer Ling Ji, so when discussing, they are very inclined to Ling Ji.Ling Xiao smiled, but just greeted her hand at random.No martial arts are used.It is useless.It\u2019s just a hand outstretched.This scene surprised everyone on the scene.Even without martial arts, he wanted to block the punch. He thought Ling Xiaofan was Lingfan Fan?Even if Ling Feifan, dare not despise his opponent so much.\"Good boy, you dare to look down on me!\"Ling Ji was angry.Of the people who once defeated him in this way, he only met one, Ling Fanfan.Since that time, he has thrown land on Ling Feifan's five bodies.Such a person, he does not want to appear the second one, no one can replace the position of Ling extraordinary in his mind!\"Stop you!\"\\nOriginally Ling Ji also retained some gang qi in order to meet the next challenge, but he is now anxious by Ling Xiao's contempt, and even used ten success forces.At that moment, his skin became iron black, and the whole person was like a sculpture made of black iron.\"boom!\"\"Get out of here!\"On the competition platform, Ling Xiao remained motionless, while Ling Ji rushed up at a very fast speed.Then their fists touched.Ling Ji's horrible Gang Qi scattered around the world~www.novelbuddy.com~ The wall of Biwutai was obviously distortedFortunately, it has been strengthened and not damaged.Ling Ji's face was full of fanaticism.However, the following results made him difficult to accept.\"Kap!\"\"Click, click!\"That's the sound of broken bones.Ling Ji's expression changed from fanaticism and anger to panic and pain.\\nThe bones of his arms broke, extending all the way to his shoulders.Although the man didn't fly out, the bones of both arms were all shattered.He feels that his opponent is not a person, but more like a double fist on the mountain made of steel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It is miserable. I hope he will not challenge me next.\"...\"Ling Xiao, through the challenge, qualified to participate in the finals, in view of you defeated Ling Ji, so you sit in the position of Ling Ji, the people in the medicine hall, take Ling Ji to heal.\"Most people can't see it, but the referee's eyesight is not bad. They clearly found that Ling Ji's broken arm can no longer continue to participate in the finals.\\nThis Lingxiao really has to be said to be done, ruthless enough, decisive enough.To say that at this time the heart is the most flustered, I'm afraid it is Ling XIII.Ling Xiao's fruits were fierce and unpredictable. If Ling Xiao knew that he was the one who bought him, it would be strange not to be retaliated against.To overcome Ling Ji, for Ling Xiao, it was just a simple appearance.He turned his gaze to Ling Feifan's position, and there was a sneer on the corner of his mouth.You all think that Ling Feifan is better than me and more talented than me, so he is given the privilege. I don\u2019t know what kind of face you will exchange after I defeat him?After all, today he was treated unfairly.Because Ling Feifan did not go through this process, he still qualified to enter the finals.He is not happy in his heart!But he didn't say anything, and it didn't make sense to snarl. Let's use performance to keep those people shut up.Thinking of this, he walked to the fifth chair in the second row and sat down.The appearance of him and Ling Feifan had no effect on the finals themselves.\\nIt was originally a game of 110 people, but now the number is just gathered.Although the top 100 rankings will have generous rewards, the higher the ranking, the richer the rewards.Especially the top three, there will be Gang Qidan and top martial arts as rewards.Therefore, the top three must be the fiercest competition in this final.Presumably, in addition to the unfathomable Ling extraordinary, the rest of the people are probably not willing to let this opportunity to get top martial arts easily.Ling Xiao is no exception.And obviously, the higher the ranking, the higher the status within the family, and the more privileges you get.Among the genius halls, Ling Fanfan, the number one rank, is even higher than most elders in the Ling family.Ling Xiao is not rare, but he believes that with the privilege, it will be more helpful for his future practice.\"Late Xiao's late arrival has affected the progress of the Finals. I will reiterate the rules here! Everyone has five chances to challenge, only five times, and one less time! In addition, if two consecutive challenges succeed, Then you will no longer be restricted by rankings, and you can challenge anyone in front of you!\"The referee stood up and said loudly, \"Have you heard clearly?\"\"Listen clearly!\"\\n\"Okay, since that's the case, then continue to the finals.\"Although Ling Xiao came relatively late, the rules of the finals were not complicated, and he easily understood.For those who are ranked lower, to challenge those who are ranked higher, the first two challenges can only cross a maximum of ten people. If the two consecutive challenges are successful, then this restriction will be lifted.Challenge victory, automatically get the position of the challenged.The challenged need to re-challenge others to get the ranking.Everyone has five chances to challenge, one challenge, no matter the victory or defeat, will lose a chance to challenge.Therefore, in addition to testing the fighting ability of the disciples, this competition is also testing their judgment.The so-called knowing oneself and knowing the other can be invincible.If even the opponent can't see clearly and rashly challenge, it won't work.This is a big race within the clan, so it won\u2019t kill people and hurt you most.But once they reached the rivers and lakes, and outside, if they accidentally kicked the iron plate, it would really be dead.In addition, the ranking challenge is to advance the disciples to advance the disciples, but this challenge is not included in the five challenge opportunities.\\nIt's a simple ranking battle.After all, they advanced through the knockout and must be integrated with the ranking of the previous one hundred talented disciples.Then came the challenge from back to front.Before Ling Xiao came, several of the disciples who advanced in the knockout challenge ended, and the challenge from the back to the 90th place.Another point is that the challenge can also be abstained, which will lose a chance to challenge, but will not be ugly. It is actually very suitable for disciples who are not very aggressive.But one hundred to one hundred and ten people is a relatively intense stage.These ten disciples will not waste any chance to challenge in order to enter the Genius Hall.It is a pity that Ling Xiao came too late and has missed this wonderful stage.At this stage of one hundred to fifty, many people will choose to abstain.Especially in the 100th place, he would definitely not challenge without absolute self-confidence. Anyway, he has kept his place and is still a genius disciple. He is not very confident in his own strength, so he will not give up his ugliness.So this stage is very fast.After fifty people move forward, the challenge becomes more and more intense.\\nIn fact, the strengths of fifty to eleventh are similar, so no one will serve anyone, and the natural challenge is very fierce.The disciples who broke into the finals in the knockout games now, except Ling Yihang, Ling Xiao, and Ling Yixue, entered the top 50 with a Ling Tie hand, ranking 48th, which is not too much.The rest are after fifty.The genius hall disciples are the genius hall disciples. Even if they are in the top ten of the elite hall, it will be difficult for them to break even further.Only a few people can do it.Ling Yihang sixth, Ling Xiao fifteenth, Ling Yixue nineteenth.These three are now the most anticipated in the first ten miles of the knockout.Generally speaking, UU reading www. uukanshu. The first twenty of the com genius hall basically have the realm of the four early stages of martial arts.The first ten of the Tiancai Hall have basically reached the mid-level of the four-phase Wumai.The top five of Tiancaitang are all above the strength of Wumai's quadruple peak.Of course, this is only a rough statement. After all, strength is only a rough idea. It is normal for the low realm to defeat the high realm by experience.Tiancaitang is indeed worthy of the genius hall, are a group of monsters, many people have made some breakthroughs in these seven days.\\nAlthough not as scary as Ling Xiao.The top 20 are considered a stage.Everyone strives for the top ten.Ling Yixue's goal is not as high as Ling Xiao's.

It can be seen that those genius hall disciples choose to challenge the opponents, who are often relatively familiar opponents.\\nAfter the three-person challenge ended, it was Ling Xiao's turn.\"Ling Xiao, please choose your first challenge!\"The referee reminded.Ling Xiao nodded and looked at the ten people sitting in the front row.His goal is first, but there is no need to take the first place so quickly, otherwise there will be many people who will not accept it and challenge one after another.So his idea is to get the top ten first, anyway five chances, as long as there is one chance for him to challenge Ling Feifan is enough.\"Just the tenth.\"Ling Yixue is the ninth, he chose to challenge the tenth, just right.He knew that many people wanted to see his details, but with the tenth disciple, he was not qualified to let him use his real skills.It took only a moment to get on stage, and it was still just a punch.It's just that this time, \"Bull Bull Power\" was used. The situation of the other party was better than that of Ling Ji, because Ling Xiao left his hand.\"How powerful is Ling Xiao, and it's so easy to see him win the tenth. It really can shake Ling's extraordinary position!\"\"Idiot, the most powerful in Genius Hall is the top five. He only won the tenth place. I think Ling Zhan can easily win him. There is no need for extraordinary brothers to do it!\"\"Until the end, who knows?\"\\nWhile they were arguing, Ling Xiao had already sat beside Ling Yixue.\"Ling Xiao, your fighting power seems to be more than the four peaks of Wumai.\"Ling Yixue lowered her voice and asked.\"That's right.\"Ling Xiao smiled, did not deny it.It's okay to admit, anyway, to his current position, his real hole card has not been exposed.\"I will not continue to challenge.\"Ling Xiao only challenged once. He felt that it was enough. The remaining opportunities were still reserved for the top three of the challenge.Of course, perhaps also have a fight with Ling Yihang.Last time, I didn't enjoy it. Although he won Ling Yihang, he could only be regarded as Ling Yihang's enemy, not how powerful he was.So this time, if he wants to defeat Ling Yihang in an upright manner, it can be regarded as breaking the following knot.Four chances, just right.Next, look at the shots of the people in front. The top three are not easy to provoke. Although he is confident that he can win, he really dare not underestimate the enemy.If you made the same mistake as Ling Yihang in the knockout, it would be foolish.\\n\"Ling Yun, you want to avenge your brother Ling Feng, I am afraid there is no chance.\"Suddenly, Ling Feifan looked at Ling Yun with a smile.\"Why do you say that?\"\"Because he made it clear that it is impossible to win me, and you can't challenge in the opposite direction, unless you deliberately lose to the disciples with low rankings.\"Ling Feifan said lightly.\"You don't have to irritate me, even if you lose on your own initiative, anyway, you have to challenge five times, and it's easy to kill me.\"Ling Yun glanced at Ling Feifang and said, \"It's you, ready to meet my challenge.\"\"You are not my opponent.\"Ling Feifan smiled confidently.\"That may not be necessary!\"\"is it?\"While the first two disciples in Tiancaitang were chatting, the challenge did not stop.From the fourteenth onwards, the battle has become more and more exciting and more and more exciting.Because the higher up, the stronger the strength of these warriors.\\nBut from beginning to end, no one has challenged the top six, nor has anyone challenged Ling Xiao.Ling Yixue was challenged twice.But the opponents were defeated, and they were defeated neatly.After being challenged, it also took a quarter of a hour to rest and recover, but it can recover so well at this time. It seems that Ling Yixue should also practice the secret method of recovery.The war quickly spread to the top six.Ling Feifan, Ling Yun, Ling Shuang, Ling Zhan, Ling Xiaopeng, Ling Yihang!\"I challenge the fourth place in Ling Ling!\"Ling Yihang looked at Ling Zhan, his eyes were firm and full of confidence.Ling Xiao was also somewhat impressed with this person. He appeared in the knockout game.At that time, the Ling battle was already the four peaks of martial arts.Although there is no breakthrough today, it is not so easy to be manipulated.\"Hahaha, okay, Ling Yihang, did your kid dare to challenge me? Do you think it's easier for me to deal with the first four miles?\"\"No, none of the top four are easy generations.\"Ling Yihang said seriously.\\nHe didn't dare to despise Ling Zhan. He chose to challenge Ling Zhan only because Ling Zhan was the worst in the top five.Ling Yihang's own body is not strong enough, but it is better than Ling Zhan, so choosing Ling Zhan is targeted.\"Okay, anyway, my hand is a little tickled. Since that's the case, let's play with you.\"Ling Zhan jumped onto the competition platform, and the breath changed instantly.This guy is also a warrior who specializes in defensive martial arts. The breath of terror spreads, making Ling Yihang frown and wrinkle.This battle can be said to be the longest time since the game started.It lasted for half an hour, and finally the referee gave the judgement. Ling Yihang won with a slight advantage.\"Huh, you've won, but I'm not convinced. I will challenge you later.\"Ling Zhan's intent was strong, and he was not very convinced by the referee's punishment, but he did not dare to violate it.Anyway, he has the opportunity to challenge Ling Yihang next, no big deal.But someone was ahead of him.Ling Xiaopeng, ranked fifth, was the younger brother of Ling Dapeng who was defeated by Ling Yihang. His brother was defeated and his brother was naturally unconvinced.So after waiting for a quarter of an hour, he directly announced the challenge to Ling Yihang.Unexpectedly, Ling Xiaopeng's challenge directly forced Ling Yihang's biggest card.\\nThis guy is actually a swordsman!He had never used a knife in his previous battles, and until that knife came out of the sheath, Ling Xiaopeng automatically conceded defeat.That knife was too horrible, so amazing!Therefore, the fifth place Ling Xiaopeng failed to challenge.Next is the third ranked Lingshuang challenge.As for the fourth Ling fight, because he was defeated by Ling Yihang, he is now ranked unqualified, and he needs to come back again after the next round of challenges.\"No way Lingyun, I can only challenge you.\"Ling Shuang did not abstain.Although she is very clear, whether it is Ling Yun or Ling extraordinary, she is less than 20% sure of winning.But she still intends to try it. Anyway, if she fails the challenge, her ranking will not drop~www.novelbuddy.com~ For Ling Yun, at least she knows the other party's behavior.But to Ling Feifan, she couldn't get up to the slightest fighting spirit at all.\"Oh? Do you mean that I'm not as good as Ling extraordinary?\"Ling Yun sneered: \"Since you look at it that way, then I will let you know that you can challenge me at will, but you will humiliate yourself.\"Originally Ling Yun intended to lose a game deliberately and then challenged Ling Xiao.\\nBut the strong self-esteem in his character broke out at this time.Brother is a fart!Brother Qiu is a fart!Being despised, this is the biggest discomfort!So he had to defeat Ling Shuang, and he had to beat it neatly, let Ling Shuang know that he had chosen the wrong challenge!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 Come challenge me!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?On the competition platform, Ling Yun looked at Ling Shuang as if he was watching a joke.Although Ling Shuang is strong, he is by no means his opponent, and he dares to challenge him, it is stupid!This is the character of Ling Yun. He does not allow any weak to dare to challenge his authority and status.That is unforgivable.Looking at these two people, Ling Xiao smiled slightly. He must have challenged Ling Yun, so in this battle, it is necessary to take a good look at Ling Yun's ability.\"Soft water swordsmanship!\"The first shot was Ling Shuang.Because she knows Ling Yun's strength very well, if she doesn't shoot, there will be no chance.Soft water swordsmanship, as the name implies, is a softer swordmanship, and the weapons used are also exquisite.\\nThat must be a soft sword!At this time, the soft sword in Lingshuang's hand, like a poisonous snake, stabbed Lingyun at a very strange angle.Although the sword is soft.But that is just an appearance, and if it is implemented, it will still cause great harm.Top swordsmanship?Ling Xiao couldn't help frowning, but he was really the third disciple of Tiancai Tang. Sure enough, he already had the top martial arts.The top defensive martial arts of Ling Ji was just an incomplete scrapbook, and it was already very powerful.Most Ling family disciples, in fact, the best martial arts they have are advanced martial arts.Only the top three in the Talent Hall every year are eligible for top martial arts.This Lingshuang was third last year.Although Ling Shuang's top swordsmanship \"soft water swordsmanship\" is only practiced to Xiaocheng, there is still a distance to master.However, top-level swordsmanship is top-level swordsmanship, and its power is more terrifying than most successful martial arts.\\nFeminine!Treacherous!This is the characteristic of the soft water swordsmanship.Ling Xiao possesses mountains, rivers, and martial arts spirits, so it is easy to analyze the beauty of this sword technique.\"It's been a year, but your soft water swordsmanship has only reached the level of Xiaocheng, and dare to deal with me, it's hard to control!\"Ling Yun snorted without a weapon, and banged up with a punch.\"Boom!\"The punch was too fast, and he was firmly on the weakest link of Lingshuang Rousshui swordsmanship.Ling Shuang hurriedly took a few steps back, and almost fell off the contest.This was able to dissolve Ling Yun's boxing power.\"Ling Shuang, I will give you a face. It's still too late to admit defeat. It won't look good in a moment!\"Ling Yun did not pursue, he just looked at Ling Shuang from afar, his eyes showing a deep disdain.\\n\"Brother Ling Yun is too strong. Without using his best swordsmanship, she easily resolved Sister Lingshuang's soft water swordsmanship!\"\"That punch is not an ordinary move, it should be a high-level boxing technique that satisfies the realm, but I can\u2019t win the sword of Ling Shuang alone, but his gangster quality is too strong, I am afraid that I have already touched the fivefold of Wumai. The side of the peak!\"The audience is also capable, and has analyzed why Ling Yun can suppress Lingshuang with one punch.\"Ling Yun, you don't have to keep your hand. Since I dare to challenge you today, I'm not afraid of being ugly!\"Ling Shuang's character is also stubborn. Although she knows that she will lose, she refuses to admit defeat, otherwise today's battle will inevitably become the demon of her future practice.\"Stubbornness!\"Dominate!The same is domineering. Ling Yun\u2019s show is a real world domineering, much more powerful than Lingji\u2019s domineering.This punch came out, as if the Supreme came, the golden yellow gang gas wrapped the fist, making a loud noise like thunder.At that moment, Ling Yun seemed to be a different person.This horrible atmosphere shocked many disciples close to Biwutai, who had a headache and blood.\"Although it is only a high-level martial art that satisfies the realm, but this guy is exhibiting it, it is even more terrifying than Xiaocheng, even the top-level martial arts who are proficient. Sure enough, martial arts are better, and their own training must keep up!\"\\nLing Xiao felt with emotion that Ling Yun was much stronger than Ling Shuang.This guy doesn't use swordsmanship.Not to mention the sword, you can stabilize Lingshuang.terrible!No wonder he feels that he is qualified to challenge Ling Feifan. Although his character is not very good, but this guy's strength is really not covered.\"Rou Sword Dance!\"This is a defensive move in the soft water swordsmanship.At this time, Ling Shuang had no way to avoid Ling Yun's attack, so the only thing she could do was defense.\"boom!\"A sound like an explosion popped up on the competition platform, and the protective wall was almost exploded in a conical shape over five or six meters.This is just the gang gas dissipated through Ling Shuang's body.\"puff!\"\\nLing Shuang was blasted without suspense.It was difficult to stand under the stage, but a mouthful of blood was sprayed directly, staining the ground.Although Ling Xiao was a little emotional about this scene, it was actually light. In comparison, if you chose the wrong opponent, you might just vomit blood.Once outside, you choose the wrong opponent, it is dead!\"Two tricks! Brother Ling Yun is too terrifying, and the two tricks defeated the third-ranked Senior Sister Ling Shuang!\"\"Yes, Sister Ling Shuang is not that weak.\"\"Otherwise how do you try to challenge Ling Shuang in the next round?\"The audience said everything.Ling Xiao could see that Ling Shuang was not weak, but Ling Yun was too strong.Ling Yun, who won the game, did not look at Ling Shuang, but glanced at Ling Xiao sitting in the tenth position.Before decisive battle with Ling Feifan, he intends to clean up Ling Xiao first.\"Ling Xiao! If your kid is still a man, come and challenge me in the next round! Anyway, you still have four chances to challenge, and it's not a shame to lose!\"\\nLing Yun said suddenly.\"You don't have to excite me, I just want to learn your sword intentions!\"Ling Xiao originally planned to challenge Ling Yihang in the next round and challenge Ling Yun after winning, but at this time he changed his mind.Because it's boring to wait, Ling Shuang can't force Ling Yun to use his sword intention. It is estimated that besides Ling Feifan, others are unlikely.So the challenge is the same as the challenge.And he has a lot of cards, even if one or two shows up against Ling Yun, it's no big deal.\"Don't you deserve me to use sword intentions? What a joke!\"Ling Yun sneered and went back to sit in his seat.In his view, his radical strategy has been successful, and he will wait for the next round of Ling Xiao to challenge him.Then, by the way, avenge his brother, and at the same time suppress the following newcomer.After Ling Shuang's challenge, UU's reading www.uukanshu.com was Ling Yun's turn.He just glanced at Ling Fanfan lightly: \"When I clean up the kid, I will challenge you in the next round!\"\\n\"I am waiting!\"Ling Feifan said lightly.\"I abstain!\"Ling Yun chose to abstain in this round, but everyone can understand that everyone just heard Ling Yun's words. He wanted to solve Ling Xiao first, and then revenge his brother before challenging Ling Fanfan in a complete state. of.As for the exposed cards.Ling Yun didn't even think about it, because he didn't think Ling Xiao had the qualification to expose him.His goal is Ling Feifan, no one can defeat Ling Feifan, only he can.Ling Feifan is his heart demon, so he must be defeated. If someone defeats Ling Feifan before him, he estimates that he will be crazy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some people even think that he may be the only one who can pose a threat to Ling Yun and Ling Feifan.Of course, this battle ended too simply, it is difficult to say wonderful.Until the tenth place, Xiao Xiao, there was nothing to ignite the enthusiasm of the audience.\"Ling Yun!\"\"Ling Yun!\"Suddenly, when Ling Xiao stood up to prepare for the challenge, the scene boiled, and almost all the Ling family's children shouted Ling Yun's name.Ling Xiao challenged Ling Yun, and they naturally supported Ling Yun.Even Fan Ling's fans temporarily supported Ling Yun at this time.\\n\"Did Ling Xiao dare to challenge Brother Ling Yun?\"\"I think it's just a matter of time. It's really his turn. He might not dare to challenge him.\"\"It is also said that Brother Ling Yun is the only one who can challenge the first throne of the extraordinary brother. He can already get the top ten ranking in Ling Xiao.\"\"You don't know Lingxiao too much, since he said that, he won't regret it!\"\"Yes, isn't Ling Xiao useless?\"Supporting Ling Xiao is actually a group of female fans who originally belonged to Ling Shuang.However, it is normal to think about it. Ling Shuang was hit so badly by Ling Yun. Her fans must not be happy. Even if she did not expect anything from Ling Xiao, she would definitely support it.What if a miracle occurs?Will it challenge?Almost everyone present is waiting for the answer to this question.Ling Er frowned slightly.He did not want Ling Xiao to challenge Ling Yun, because he was not optimistic about Ling Xiao, so he felt that it would be Ling Xiao's act of aggression.Ling Xiao looked at Ling Yun and suddenly showed a strange smile.\\n\"What is this kid doing?\"Ling Yun suddenly felt something was wrong.\"I want to challenge the top ranked Ling Feifan!\"Ling Xiao's serious burst of a confident light.This is when he temporarily changed his mind.What's the point of defeating Ling Yun, directly defeating Ling Fanfan, I am afraid that the impact on Ling Yun will be even greater than defeating Ling Yun itself.After all, Ling Yun has always been the defeat of Ling Feifan's men. In the past three years, no one has ever won Ling Feifan.So Ling Yun felt that only he was qualified to defeat Ling Feifan.What would happen if Ling Feifan was defeated by Ling Xiao?Of course, Ling Xiao challenged Ling Fanfan, and he was not completely sure, not even Liu Cheng.The key is that he doesn't understand Ling Lingfan.But what's the matter? Anyway, he still has four chances to challenge. If he wins, he will solve the problem directly. It doesn't matter if he loses.In this case, I dare not challenge, it is really a sap.\\nwhat?Ling Xiao's challenge is not Ling Yun, but Ling Feifan, who is stronger and more mysterious than Ling Yun!\"Ling Xiao, you bastard! Why don't you challenge me!\"Ling Yun was angry, he stood up and shouted directly.\"Because you are not qualified to challenge me.\" Ling Xiao said lightly: \"Although Ling Feifan is also not qualified, it is slightly stronger than you, and it barely makes me interested.\"Hey!This guy is crazy!Genius Hall second is not qualified to challenge him?Is Genius Hall first not qualified?What does this mean?Does he think he is more powerful than the first and second of Tiancaitang?Ling Feifan didn't care much about Ling Xiao all the time, but this time, he couldn't care less.No matter how good-tempered he is, he can't help being despised.\\nHowever, regardless of what he thinks, Ling Xiao will occupy the first position and be prepared to be challenged.He looked at the referee seat, and then said aloud: \"Before you said that I am not worthy of the same privileges as Ling Feifan, I will tell you now if I have this qualification!\"\"This kid!\"Ling Xiaotian's eyes revealed a splendid color.For many years, there are too many disciples who honestly have too many daring to challenge authority and inherent rules.So no matter how good people are, they can only be mixed in Tianfeng City.The appearance of Ling Xiao gave him a glimmer of hope.\"Let me see if you are just talking, or you really have the ability!\"The capable person is arrogant, it is not arrogant, it is domineering and confident!People who are incapable are arrogant, they are not arrogant, they are stupid and ignorant!Is Ling Xiao domineering and confident, or stupid and ignorant?Ling Xiaotian would like to know this answer.\"Ling Xiao, you are the most ignorant of all the disciples I have ever seen! Change your thoughts, and I will say what you just said!\"\\nThe chief referee is speaking.He was still somewhat fond of Ling Xiao, but Ling Xiao actually challenged Ling Feifan, which made him feel unreasonable.Ling Feifan, can you challenge it?Are you worthy?It's good for a disciple who can be mixed into the tenth place of Tiancaitang. He actually tried to challenge the top ranked Ling Feifan. Isn't this ignorance?\"The referee, I was very respectful of you, especially in the knockout game, you stopped Ling Xing from breaking the rules of the game! But now, I am really more and more disappointed with you, why can't I challenge Ling Feifan? Why is it unqualified?\"Ling Xiao shouted: \"The referee, I have no intention of arguing with you on this matter, but if I win Ling Feifan, I hope you can apologize to me for your ignorance and stupidity!\"\"Ling Xiao! You are too much! Come here, take this boy who doesn't know how to behave!\"Ling Jiu stood up and shouted.\"Yes, come soon!\"Ling Thirteen also coaxed.\"Joke, I don't know how to behave? The so-called don't do what you want! If you don't respect others, how do you deserve to be respected!\"Ling Xiao sneered: \"In the entire Ling family, there are three people I admire the most, one is my grandfather, one is Ling Er, and the other is Patriarch Ling!\"\\nHe said it was smarter, even if he offended people, he could not offend them all.What's more, Ling Xiaotian's approach is fairly fair, and he really respects the old man.\"Hahaha, a person who doesn't want to do anything to others, well said!\"Ling Xiaotian laughed and said: \"This challenge is originally allowed by the rules, no one can hinder you, and the referee, you are the referee, and you are the referee, don't violate the rules.\"No one will hate those who respect themselves.Ling Xiaotian is no exception.What's more, he is the person who most wants to see Ling Xiao challenge Ling Ling~~www.novelbuddy.com~ How could this challenge come to an abrupt end?\"Yes, patriarch!\"The referee is only too ridiculous to protect Ling before he loses his gaze. In fact, he is still relatively fair. After all, he has no hatred with Ling Xiao.On the contrary, Ling Jiu and Ling 13 were trembling with anger, but what could they do? In the face of Ling Xiaotian, they dared not put one fart.\"What's your name?\"Ling Feifan was still sitting there, then narrowed his eyes and asked Ling Xiao.\"Ling...\"\\n\"Forget it, it doesn't matter what your name is.\"Ling Xiao was about to answer, but Ling Feifan interrupted her words.\"Anyway, you will go down soon.

This horrible flame was so powerful.This is not an illusion!Not an illusion!Because the cultivation of different inner power mentality, gangqi can also obtain different attributes, it is clear that Ling Feifan is specialized in flame gangqi.It's just that there are a lot of people in the Ling family practicing flame and qi, but few people can reach him to this level.\"What a terrible flame! If you can burn everything, this should be the effect of top-level inner power mentality!\"\\nOn the referee seat, someone exclaimed.This judgment is very correct.Because Ling Feifan won the first place in three consecutive years, there should be at least three top martial arts he cultivated.Martial arts, inner power mentality, body method!This is the most basic.If it is not possible, there may be special martial arts such as secret methods and soul secret techniques.It is no wonder that Ling Feifan has always been able to occupy the first place in the genius hall, able to cultivate top martial arts to the level of mastery. Among the disciples of the Ling family, for now, he alone can do it.Feeling this terrible breath, Ling Yun's face could not help changing.This qi is too horrible. That kind of scent is enough to make him tremble. This extraordinary Ling is really unfathomable. He can't beat it at all.Ling Xiao's idiot dare to challenge Ling Feifan, and he's almost dead!\"Hahaha, this extraordinary child really did not disappoint us all. Three months ago, he was already a warrior of the five peaks of the martial arts, but the four top martial arts are only small successes. At the very least, the top-level internal skill is to reach the mastery level.\"The chief referee really valued Ling Feifan.\\nIn fact, it is not just him. The rest of people look at Ling Feifan's eyes completely differently from the rest of the disciples.As long as Ling Feifan does not make a big mistake, he can be free from the Ling Family Rules.\"I think the other three top martial arts should have mastered mastery too. That Ling Xiao is really not self-confident, but fortunately, let him see the strength of the first disciple of the Ling family, and he will be more practical in the future!\"\"I haven't used that Lingxiao for a long time. Everyone is a low-level disciple, and they were recruited from outside. However, I accidentally won the first knockout game. I dare to disrespect me and wait for the referee. I can't understand why the patriarch still protects he.\"\"The patriarch is probably to show fairness. After all, Ling Xiao has challenged the extraordinary and has not violated the rules.\"\"Then let Fanfan teach this Ling Xiao how to be a man!\"Including a group of senior Ling family members in the referee and auditoriums, basically support Ling Fanfan.It's no wonder that Ling Feifan has left a powerful and undefeated impression in the minds of these people for three years.They support Ling Feifan, very normal.Besides, because Ling Feifan is the first, he has obtained a lot of resources, which is another reason why he has never been defeated.In addition, his general talent for cultivation that day was stronger than Ling Yun and Ling Shuang, so no one can challenge his status.Today, 17-year-old Ling Feifan ranks last among the four sons of Tianfeng City, but the Ling family believes that if they are re-ranked, Ling Feifan will definitely be able to take the first place.\\n\"Whoever, you come here to attack, for a quarter of an hour, I don\u2019t move my position, you can use whatever means you want to attack, as long as it is allowed by the rules, it can hurt me, even if it is just a scratch, I will Count on you to win!\"Ling Feifan stood there with his hands behind his back, as if the **** of fire came down, but his eyes looked at Ling Yun under the stage.In Ling Feifan's view, the only thing that can make him interested is Ling Yun.He really wanted to try, how powerful Ling Yun's sword is.So his challenge to Ling Xiao was really annoying. An ant who tried to challenge the giant elephant was ridiculous.\"Hahaha, worthy of being an extraordinary brother, and only he dares to say so!\"\"Yeah, standing there without moving his position, Ling Xiao could not hurt him with a single hair!\"On the observatory, everyone took it for granted.They did not feel that Ling Feifan was pretending, because Ling Feifan did have such strength.It is normal for him to say so.It is to let Ling Xiao really understand the gap between the strength of the two people.\"Ha ha ha ha, quarter hour? It seems that you can only maintain the confidence of the quarter hour!\"\\nLing Xiao laughed and said: \"Otherwise, I will stand here without moving my position and give you half an hour. If you can hurt me, even if it hurts me, I will count as your win!\" \"His anti-lips sneered, although many people on the viewing platform were surprised.But everyone's thinking is different.No one thinks how brave or domineering he is.Instead, he thought it was ridiculous to do so.who do you think You Are?Who do you think you are talking to?That's Ling extraordinary!Not to mention Ling extraordinary, any one of the top five, if you want to win, it is impossible not to hurt a sweat.\"Pretend!\"\"It's a fool.

She had expected that Ling Xiao might be able to fight Ling Yun and help her out. She did not expect Ling Xiao to be stupid enough to challenge Ling Fanfan.\"That may not be necessary!\"Ling Yihang, who was sitting on the side, said lightly: \"You have been standing on a high place, but you have forgotten that the greatest danger is under your feet. If you are not careful, you will fall apart.\"\"You actually value that Ling Xiao so much? Is it because you lost to him?\"Ling Shuang asked with a smile.\\n\"Yes, only after fighting him, you will understand that any tricks have no meaning in front of him, that is a fighting genius, who can understand everything!\"Ling Yihang still has a very indifferent expression.He had thought that he should be able to overcome Ling Xiao after practicing his sword skills.But when he saw Ling Xiao standing opposite Ling Fanfan, he didn't frown under the terrifying momentum, he understood.Not only did he not catch up with Ling Xiao, but he was thrown away again by the other party.\"Humph, look down on Ling Xiao, you will cry.\"Ling Tiehou once had a festival with Ling Xiao, but he also played with Ling Xiao, so he knows how terrible Ling Xiao is.Often the one who knows the person best is not a friend but an opponent.\"This group of genius halls are used to being proud. Today, they have met their opponents. When the two sides meet, you will know how ridiculous your group is.\"Ling Fei also shook his head and smiled bitterly. He also provoked Ling Xiao. After being defeated, he always paid close attention to Ling Xiao.So he knew how terrible this person was.\\n\"Show your strength, I believe you are not a brash person.\"Ling Yixue also muttered to himself.\"Without half an hour, I will let you get off the stage in one move!\"Ling Feifan didn't do much, he squeezed his right hand into a fist, as if turned into a ball of flame, and then punched directly into Ling Xiao.Although this fist does not seem to be so gorgeous, the power is very terrifying. I believe that if the fist is continued, the martial arts in the early stages of Wumai will be seriously injured.\"ended!\"Ling Shuang shook her head, she didn't take Ling Yihang's previous words seriously.\"No, Ling Feifan is too fond of enemies and will be ugly! I was so defeated at first!\"Ling Yihang smiled bitterly, he was also a bit underestimated at first, so he thought that a punch wrapped in gang gas could defeat Ling Xiao, who was the triple peak of Wumai.However, it turns out that this guy, Ling Xiao, will never show all the cards.\"Impossible, Ling Feifan's punch, even if I and Ling Yun, if I don't resist it, I will be seriously injured.\"\\nSubconsciously, Ling Shuang still thinks that Ling Xiao is not as good as hers or Ling Yun.\"Really, then look at the result.\"Ling Yihang didn't say anything, but looked at the stage, he didn't want to miss a wonderful scene.\"Stupid blow!\"Ling Xiao sighed, what the first genius.This Ling Feifan is simply foolish. This is the internal comparison. If you dare to look down on unfamiliar opponents so outside, you will definitely suffer a big loss.Even enemies that can be defeated may be restrained by the carelessness and eventually lose.Sure enough, Ling's family might have been good in Tianfeng City, but it was too far to put it in the entire Northern Han Dynasty and even the whole world.Ling Xiao couldn't help but think of the blue lady in the Fulong Mountains.The woman was definitely less than thirty years old, but the strength she showed was enough to easily destroy the entire Tianfeng City.Perhaps from that moment, his vision changed completely.\\nThe opponent he pursued in the past, the strongest he pursued was the four sons of Tianfeng City, such as Ling Xiaotian.From that moment on, he really wanted to go outside and see.What kind of master is that blue woman outside?This is only a moment's thought.In the face of Ling Feifan's punch, he did not underestimate the enemy.Although there is no movement in both hands, \"Jiu Zhuan Jin Shen Jue\" has been working.\"boom!\"A heavy blow hit Ling Xiao's body, and the flames spewed, hitting the protective wall behind Ling Xiao directly torn a small mouth.Several people in the frightened Ling family rushed thousands to rush to repair the protective wall and strengthen it.The protective wall has been cracked, what about Ling Xiao?Won't it be dead?\\nMany people look at it with such questions.However, to their surprise, Ling Xiao was standing there motionless at this time, covered with golden light, as if he were the undefeated God of War.Ling Feifan, who took the initiative to attack, retreated two or three meters away before standing still, with a look of consternation on his face.What the **** is going on?Seeing this scene, all Ling family disciples and Ling family seniors were stunned.Because including those who support Ling Xiao, did not expect this to be the result.Ling Feifan took the initiative to not only hurt Ling Xiao's hair, but even Ling Xiao's clothes did not break.And what about the golden light?What is defensive martial arts?\"No wonder you are so calm, it turns out that you actually cultivated top-level defense martial arts!\"Ling Feifan moved his numb arm for a while and quickly recovered from the shock: \"Now you deserve to let me know your name.\"\\n\"Oh, unfortunately you don't deserve me to tell you my name.\"Ling Xiao said lightly: \"How can the so-called genius in a greenhouse protected by so many people know what is really powerful?\"He said that the surface is ironic Ling Fanfan, but in fact not the irony of those who secretly support Ling Fanfan.Ling Feifan was spoiled by these people. He thought Laozi was the first in the world and forgot the world outside the greenhouse, which was much cruel than the inside of the greenhouse.\"Nine turn golden body recipe! That is nine turn golden body recipe!\"On the observatory, a senior from the Ling family stood up and shouted, \"And looking at the situation of this kid, it should be cultivation to reach the level of Xiaocheng, the fifth turn!\"\"The top defense martial art \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\"? It is said that that kind of martial arts is very difficult to practice. He actually practiced to the fifth turn without the help of others? Where can I get so much gold?\"\"Yes, UU reading www.uukanshu.com, as far as I know, to practice the fifth turn, at least it must consume more than one million two gold!\"\"His cultivation base is the peak of Wumai's fourfold, but the defense is afraid that it has already surpassed the early stage of Wumai's fivefold, and it is no wonder that Ling Feifang's punch can't cause him any harm!\"\"This kid is really a geek. He can train the world's most difficult top martial arts to the fifth turn. This is in the entire Northern Han Dynasty. It is estimated that he can do it alone under the age of 20.\"\"Hahaha, good boy, I really saw you right!\"\\nLing Er is afraid that is the happiest one among all.He has been the most fearful one for a long time, for fear that Ling Xiao could not pass a trick under Ling Feifan's hand, it would be too shameful.But now, he suddenly understood that he really has a different perspective on people.Facts have proved that he chose to support Ling Xiao, make friends with Ling Xiao, and risk the offense of Ling Jiu and Ling XIII, which is worth it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That punch was actually less than 30% of his combat strength.Next, he must get serious, otherwise he will become the biggest laugh in the finals today.\"Three strokes will break your golden body!\"\"Don't you just say that you'll abolish me with one move?\" Ling Xiao scratched her head and smiled, \"Did you just fart?\"\"you!\"Ling Feifan gritted his teeth, finally tolerated it, and sneered, \"I don't take advantage of you!\"Although he didn't yell at the ninja, the anger turned into a fighting frenzy.\\nHis whole body seemed to be burning, full of terrifying breath.Flame punch!This punch was obviously more terrifying than the last punch. The hot high temperature forced several disciples to move back.At a distance of more than ten meters, it still seemed as if the whole body was going to be burned.This punch has already made the opponent's heart agitated before the attack has touched the opponent.This is the terrible thing about Flame Fist.\"Advanced boxing technique? And it is the advanced boxing technique of the Great Circle! This boxing is at least twice as powerful as before!\"Ling Shuang looked at Ling Yihang beside him: \"This punch is over. If your friend has no other cards, he will lose.\"\"not necessarily!\"Ling Yihang shook his head and said: \"Did you not find it, Ling Xiao has not had a single drop of sweat on his forehead so far, and he can't sweat in the face of the flames, his strength is probably better than you and I imagined Terrible.\"\"is it?\"Ling Shuang did not argue as she did last time because she had made a wrong judgment before.\\n\"Ling Feifan, you are too disappointing to me, or show your top martial arts, you want to break my golden body with advanced boxing skills, you may not look down on me too much?\"Ling Xiao felt very unhappy, although this time Ling Feifan increased his skill to 50%, and used stronger martial arts than before.But for him, there was really no threat.He decided to come up with something, otherwise it would be too boring!Niu Mogong\u00b7Hua Niuhua Demon!Ling Xiao still stood still, but his hands were gone.His figure seemed to be wrapped in a black ghost, forming the shape of a bull demon.Boom!boom!This time, the two fists collided, and the gangsters collided.Ling Xiao did not use \"Xuelian Qi Jue\", but still used \"Chiyang Gong\".The flames generated by the \"Chiyanggong\" of the environment are not weaker than that of the top-level inner power mentality.\\nTherefore, his flames were not weaker than Ling Feifan.After all, Ling Feifan's guy is still saving strength.It is estimated that I want to use it against Lingyun.After all, Ling Feifan still did not regard Ling Xiao as an opponent.But this time he was destined to pay the price for his underestimation!Ling Xiao will not let him lose.Such a good opponent, losing so fast, it would be too boring!Teng Teng Teng Teng!The fist intersects, and the gas burst.The flames flew over, and the protective wall of the contest was constantly deformed.That is, several masters of the Ling family continued to inject gang gas to protect them, otherwise, they would definitely be directly destroyed by the two's attacks.\"what happened?\"\\nThe people on the audience were stunned.Because they found that Ling Xiao was still in place, while Ling Feifan withdrew continuously for more than ten meters, and his arms were trembling.\"Idiot, if it wasn't for me to show mercy this time, you would have been killed by a punch!\"Ling Xiao looked at Ling Feifan and said: \"In the face of opponents of unknown strength, you still dare to underestimate the enemy continuously. Do you think your life is too long? The Ling family's first genius? What a joke!\"\"You! Your success angered me! Die!\"Ling Feifan decided to ignore everything, he was going to kill this guy, this guy who made him lose face.\"Swoosh!\"A gun was taken out of thin air.\"It's a storage ring!\"\"Huh, I'm really envious. Of the many disciples of our Ling family, only the extraordinary brother has the storage ring.\"\"Ling Xiao's idiot actually forced the extraordinary brother to take out his spear, this time he was dead!\"In the stands, the disciples of the Ling family were very excited.\\nLing Yun clenched her hands and gritted her teeth: \"Ling Xiao! Ling Xiao! Ling Xiao you bastard! Even I am not qualified to force Ling Feifan to use a gun. You actually did it, shit! Shit, **** !\"He was already a little crazy.This is an unacceptable scene.At this time, even Ling Yihang and Ling Yixue, who value Ling Xiao, were also a little worried. They really didn't know that Ling Feifan was actually a master with a gun.\"I forgot to tell you that Ling Yihang, Ling Feifan has always been the best at using guns, except that in the three-year finals, no one was qualified to let him shoot a gun, only the big one three years ago. For example, he had to use a gun as a last resort. The terrifying strength surprised everyone.\"Speaking of these, Ling Shuang even felt that his body was shaking: \"His gun is terrible.\"\"But he was second in that comparison three years ago?\"Ling Yihang asked with a frown.\"Yes, he is the second. At that time, you were not a disciple of the Ling family. He lost to another person. That was before him. The most outstanding genius of the Ling family was once given high hopes. Unfortunately, he was later crossed. Of the homeless people have been abducted and there is no news so far.\"Ling Shuang sighed.\"It turns out there is still such a secret.\" Ling Yihang nodded and said, \"What's that man's name?\"\"Ling Chen!\"\\nWhen the two of them spoke, there were already new changes on the competition platform.Ling Feifan's spear is in his hand. The whole person's momentum changes completely in an instant. The red flame before it turned into purple and black, and the whole person actually has a sense of evil.\"dead!\"\"go to hell!\"Ling Feifan's spear shook, and the person instantly reached Ling Xiao.\"The state-of-the-art marksmanship combined with the state-of-the-art bodywork! Is this going to be invincible?\"Finally, many people in the stands couldn't sit still.Ling Feifan's horror made them feel like they wanted to escape.That shot stabbed, the purple-black flame seemed to be able to destroy everything, to pierce Ling Xiaosheng!\"Come well, this is enough!\"Ling Xiao did not dare to underestimate the enemy, because he also felt the horror of this gun~www.novelbuddy.com~ Although it is still difficult to say that Ling Feifan's full blow, it is definitely not as easy to deal with as before.He fully operated the \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\" and went directly to the sixth turn.\\nThen \"Red Sun Gong\" also reached its limit.However, the attack is still using \"Niu Mogong \u00b7 Manniu Huamo\".Through Shan Wu Wu Hun, he can accurately analyze the opponent's attack power, and can use the most appropriate attack method to deal with the opponent.From the aspects of time, strength, weakness, etc., it can be almost perfect.Therefore, there is no possibility of underestimating the enemy.Keng!Snapped!Ling Xiao's double fists stabbed in the spear, actually made the sound of symphony of gold and iron, and the gas burst, and the purple-black flame and the red flame turned into two dragons biting in the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Forcibly used the strength of the four peaks of Wumai to fight with Ling Feifan so hard. The strange purple fire of the other party actually invaded his body.Even though he practiced \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body\", he couldn't be burned by this flame instantly, but he couldn't let this purple fire go out.Fortunately, a clear stream oozes out of the mountain and river Wuhun. It should be the cold air of the Hantan gold liquid he put in the mountain and river Wuhun before extinguishing the purple fire.\"This is impossible! How could this be!\"Ling Feifan couldn't believe the scene in front of him. He had taken out his spear, but the opponent was still undefeated.No, it didn't even move from place to place!Is this possible?\"kill--!\"Ling Feifan absolutely can't stand the emergence of this kind of situation. He just used eight success forces in the first blow, but still didn't use his full strength.That's because he feels enough to beat Ling Xiao.But the result was unexpected.This time, he didn't plan to keep his hands, he didn't.\"Ten Success Forces, Purple Flame Promise Gun!\"\\nThe same move, but the attack under the ten successful forces is significantly stronger than before.When many people on the stage pinched sweat for Ling Xiao, Ling Xiao actually smiled.\"Isn't he stupid? Why did he laugh?\"\"boom--!\"At the next moment, people finally know why Ling Xiao smiled.\"Wumai's Five Realms!\"Patriarch Ling Xiaotian, the referee, and many top Ling family members did not change color.Ling Xiao has just hidden strength?When everyone thought he had done his best, he surprised everyone!\"This kid, I am really convinced!\"Ling Yihang smiled and shook his head bitterly, he now felt that if Ling Feifan was a genius, then Ling Xiao was simply a devil!The demon above Ling family and genius!They are very excited one by one.\\nLing Xiao is actually quite excited, and finally meets an opponent who must use the Wumai Realm to overcome.Can he not be excited?Ling Feifan's attacks are not weak, and one trick after another, the tricks are terrifying.Except for Ling Xiaotian and a handful of elders, few of the people present were confident of taking such an attack.However, on the stage.A dark shadow flickered around like a residual image.But the other person stood there, still as a mountain.Let you attack crazy, let your flames burst, but he is completely golden, and the golden light seems to be more and more bright.\"This... really **** up!\"\"Yeah, what a terrifying defense martial art. If he goes on like this, wouldn't he be invincible? If he can't break his defense, he won't win him!\"\"This should be the strongest attack against the strongest defense!\"\"Yes, it must be!\"Hearing these people, Ling Xiao felt a little funny.\\nThe strongest attack?I haven't shot yet!A quarter of an hour has passed!Ling Feifan's mood has been a little messed up. Ling Xiao said before, standing still and letting him fight for half an hour, he couldn't move Ling Xiao's hair.At the time he thought it was a joke.But now, he was really a little flustered.What made him even more depressed was that Ling Xiao was afraid that he didn't know. At one quarter of an hour, he reminded him intentionally.Two quarters of an hour!Fighting is still an attack, a defense, Ling Xiao has never meant to fight back.\"No, it's impossible that the extraordinary brother really cannot hurt Ling Xiao's hair in half an hour?\"\"This Ling Xiao is too terrible, he actually said it was true, he really planned to not fight back for half an hour?\"\"I think it's almost the same, it's been two quarters of an hour.\"\"I don't think he doesn't want to fight back, but he can't fight back at all. How can he fight back under such a powerful attack from an extraordinary brother?\"\\nAlthough some people still do not believe that Ling Xiao can defeat Ling Fanfan, most people no longer doubt Ling Xiao's strength.Being able to stand there and fight Ling Fanfan for two quarters without hurting a single hair is a terrible skill in itself.On the second-ranked seat, Ling Yun, who was already mad, now had a bloodshot at the corner of his mouth, muttered to himself: \"Impossible, this is impossible, how is it possible!\"He suddenly yelled, \"Ling Feifan, what are you **** playing with, and you haven't knocked down that waste?\"On the other side, Ling Xing also vomited blood with anger.\"This kid, not only wasn't killed, but his strength was so terrible. Why is God so unfair and so kind to this kid!\"He was a little scared, and even if he did it himself, he might not be able to kill Ling Xiao in a short time.The best time to get rid of Ling Xiao is over.Once Ling Xiao won the finals, the entire Ling family will protect him. At that time, who dares to touch Ling Xiao, it is against the entire family.He hates!Ling Jiu was also very upset. He regretted why he didn't kill this kid by himself before he let this guy grow up to today.Three quarters!Ling Xiao calculated the time silently.\\nHe found that Ling Fanfan's attack gradually weakened.Ling Feifan's initial attack was indeed very strong. He also had to deal with it carefully in order to stop it. With the powerful analysis ability of Shan Wu Wu Hun, he could be invincible.But now, Ling Feifan seems to be a bit unlucky, and his moves are getting weaker and weaker.No, you cannot underestimate the enemy!Ling Xiao thought about the scene of being besieged in the Fulong Mountains.At the last minute, we must not underestimate the enemy.After all, Ling Feifan is the first genius of the Ling family. He certainly has other cards.\"Oh my god, half an hour soon passed, won't it end like this?\"In the referee seat, some referees have begun to worry about Ling extraordinary, after all, it is ugly to lose.\"Huh~www.novelbuddy.com~ Do you really think that Ling Feifan is so easy to defeat? The reason why I protect Ling Feifan is not related to him, but I think he is worth cultivating.\"The chief referee snorted coldly and looked at the competition platform. He still remembered the scene he had seen before.That was a stunning shot.Whoo!\\nSuddenly, Ling Feifan, who was attacking with all his strength, disappeared!Disappeared on the contest platform!\"Ling Xiao, you are very good. It is already proud to be able to force me to this part, but when I take the next move, you must bleed, either serious injury or death, and now you have lost your time!\"Ling Feifan's voice floated in the void, as if coming from all directions, he could not accurately capture his whereabouts.\"Despite coming, you have been waiting for this shot for a long time!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could see that Ling Feifan's shot was absolutely terrifying, and it was the feeling of killing Ling Xiao, so he hurriedly shouted.\"Second Brother, this is your fault. In the competition field, the result hasn't come out yet, and Ling Xiao didn't admit defeat. How can he stop?\"\\nLing Jiu was the first to object.\"Yes, brother, I know that Ling Xiao is yours, but you can't protect him like that unless he takes the initiative to admit defeat.\"Ling Thirteen also stood up and said.Ling Xiaotian frowned slightly and asked, \"Ling Xiao, are you willing to admit defeat?\"\"Acknowledge defeat? Thank you patriarch for your concern, but no need!\"Ling Xiao stared at Ling Feifan. This shot did not make him feel scared, but made him feel excited.This kind of battle is only interesting and helps his promotion.Faced with the doubts of everyone, Ling Xiao did not explain much, but the breath in the body continued to increase, from the early stage of Wumai Wuzhong to the later stage of Wumai Wuzhong.This scene shocked everyone again.\"Did this kid eat the heavenly treasures? How could he practice so fast, Wumai's fifth period? No wonder Ling Feifan is not afraid!\"The referee's face also became dignified. He really didn't expect that at this time, Ling Xiao actually had no cards to use.\"Come on Ling Fanfan, let me see if your gun hurts my hair!\"\\nAt this time, Ling Feifan could not hear Ling Xiao's voice anymore, and all his energy was poured into this gun.This is a shot forward!It's a shot of breaking the ship!No chance of regret!\"Boom!\"Finally, the spear once again touched Ling Xiao's hands, and two flames soared into the sky.As a last resort, several other Lingjia masters jumped out and tried their best to maintain the protective wall, which prevented the protective wall from being penetrated directly.\"Prick!\"\"Huh? Ling Xiao's golden body was broken!\"A closer person suddenly discovered that the layer of golden light above Ling Xiao's double fists was actually punctured by the tip of the spear.\"It seems that the strongest attack will defeat the strongest defense!\"\"My God, it's finally over! It's also a pride to be able to force extraordinary brothers to this part.\"\\n\"Yeah, it's still glorious.\"\"defeat?\"Ling Xiao slipped a sneer in the corner of his mouth: \"It really should be over. Half an hour has passed. Next, I should fight back!\"\"Fight back?\"Hearing his words, everyone in the audience was shocked.After a long time, he didn't have no power to fight back, but he really had to give Ling Feifan half an hour of attack time.Is this too ridiculous?\"Bragging, must be bragging, his golden body has been broken, what other means can counterattack?\"\"That is, the \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body\" he most relies on is no longer good.\"\"Hahaha, this young man, the spirit of not admitting defeat is good, but it's not good to talk big.\"On the referee seat, someone shook his head and laughed.But at the next moment, they suddenly found strange changes on the battlefield.\\nNiu Mogong\u00b7Meteor Star Fist!Suddenly, the flame on Ling Xiao's body was extinguished, and it was replaced by an amazing cold, but at that moment, the air around him had been condensed.Xuelian Qi Jue!That's right, he finally used Xuelian Qijue, and matched it with his strongest attack martial art-Meteor Star Shaman.The originally hot meteor star turned into a cold meteor star at this time, as if a huge ice ball appeared, and then directly hit Ling Fengfan's gunpoint.The Meteor Star Fist that has been promoted to the realm is not weaker than the top martial arts mastering the realm!Coupled with the top-level inner strength mentality \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\", this is simply an explosive blow.Click!Click, click!There was a weird situation on the field.Starting from the tip of the gun, Ling Feifan's spear was actually wrapped in cold air and frozen into ice, followed by the gun barrel, and then Ling Feifan's hand.Those purple flames frantically chased, trying to escape the cold attack.\\nHowever, it is of no use.Ling Qifan has consumed almost the same as Ling Feifan, which is simply the subsequent weakness, unable to bring any help to this purple flame.But Ling Xiao is different.He is still full of stamina.\"stop!\"Suddenly, a loud rumbling sounded on the viewing platform.\"That's Ling Feifan's grandfather!\"\"I heard that the extraordinary brother has died since his childhood and his parents were brought up by this grandfather!\"\"Yes, and his grandfather is still the elder of the Ling family, and his status is not lower than that of the patriarch!\"Ling Xiao heard these people's comments, but he couldn't stop.Because he could feel that Ling Feifan still had enough power in his body to kill him.If he stops now, the opponent must fight back, and he will be seriously injured if he does not die.\\nSo not only did he not stop, but also accelerated his attack, his fists were sent out fiercely, directly printed on Ling Feifan's chest.Ling Feifan did not fly out.But his whole body condensed into ice at that moment, and the stunned expression on his face was frozen at that moment.\"Sin obstacles, the old man said that you will stop!\"Suddenly, a figure rushed directly to the competition platform, and then slapped towards Ling Xiao.This speed is too fast, no one has reacted, and it is impossible for someone to save Ling Xiao.However, this palm was not taken after all.Ling Xiao had known everything for a long time, and others stood behind Ling Feifan, looking at the white-haired old man in front of him, saying, \"Your Excellency should be the elder of the Ling family, do you want to destroy this year's big Than the rules?\"\"Sin obstacles, this year's Big Tak is not allowed to hurt people's lives!\"The old man blew his beard and stared, but he couldn't help it. As long as he dared to move, Ling Xiao would dare to kill Ling Fanfan directly.\"The elder is too much~www.novelbuddy.com~ You laughed, I didn't want to kill Ling extraordinary.\"Ling Xiao said lightly: \"It is Ling Feifan who really wants the life of his juniors.\"\\n\"Quickly thaw him!\"Although the warrior in the qi stage is strong, even if he is frozen, he cannot breathe, and he will not die in a short time, but there will still be big problems after a long time.\"It can be unfrozen, but you have to promise me two conditions.\" Ling Xiao said.\"Sin obstacles, you are not worthy to talk about conditions with the old man!\"\"Oh? It turns out that's the case, then forget it. Your father will unfreeze it for him, but don't blame me for not reminding me. The freezing of his coldness came from the Fulong Mountains, except me.

This elder is too afraid to treat him, but if he saves Ling Feifan, that may not be the case.\"Say!\"Taishang elder's complexion changed and changed, and he could only say helplessly.\"The first condition is to apologize to me. I am not a scumbag. I am a disciple of the Ling family recruited by Mr. Ling Xiaotian, the head of the Ling family! And I defeated Ling Feifan and won the first place in the Tiancaitang genius disciple!\"His intentional introduction of Ling Xiaotian was to use Ling Xiaotian as a shield.\\nHe is too high as an elder, but he will not give Ling Xiaotian face.After all, the patriarch is the highest power class.\"The old man was angry for a while and said the wrong thing. He should not be called a scumbag! Should this be the case?\"Although it is very sincere to say this apology, Ling Xiao does not want to make things too rigid, after all, the other party has already apologized.The elder Taishang apologized to an ordinary disciple, which was also the first time the Lings were afraid.\"The second condition is to swear in public not to retaliate against me with personal grudges!\"Ling Xiao held out a second finger and said.\"No problem, can I start saving now?\"This Taishang elder was extremely angry, but for Ling Feifan, he could only bear it.This swears that he can't understand Ling Xiao at the Ling family, but Ling Xiao can't never go out, right?Sooner or later find this little **** to settle accounts!\\n\"of course!\"Ling Xiao still stood in the distance, just flicked a gang of gas past, the coldness on Ling Feifan's body quickly disappeared, and the solid ice quickly turned into water.\"The referee, it seems that you haven't given the penalty result yet?\"After thawing Ling Feifan, Ling Xiao looked at the referee seat.\"Yes!, yes!\"The referees on the referee seat only recovered.\"Ling Xiao challenged Ling Feifan's success and temporarily won the first place in the Talent Hall. Ling Feifan temporarily lost his ranking!\"Number one?This is really an accident.Ling Xiao didn't want to challenge Ling extraordinary so quickly at first.But once he wanted to crack down on Ling Yun, he couldn't get used to Ling Feifan's high appearance.\\nAnother reason is that he is late too, but he has been treated differently. That's all. Even the referees and the senior officials of the Ling family watching him are sneering at him.Therefore, he hoped that he could defeat Ling Feifan as soon as possible and let out his bad breath as soon as possible.Of course, the most important reason is that he feels that among the disciples of the Ling family, the only thing that can stimulate his potential and force him to use more than 80% of his strength is Ling extraordinary.No one else can do it, and it doesn't make sense of exercise.As the referee announced the result, the scene immediately boiled, and everyone unbelievably screamed and talked.Ling Xiao defeated Ling Feifan, which is a huge upset.Many people think of multiple possibilities, but they do not think of such possibilities.Ling Xiao, the dark horse, actually went from black to the end, from defeating Ling Yihang in the knockout to become the first elite hall, to defeating Ling Feifan in the finals to become the first talent hall.It's really black.Although the finals are not over, others can challenge Ling Xiao.But to be honest, those who can defeat Ling Feifan are basically among these disciples, no one can beat them.\\nThis young man, just half a month ago, was just a warrior with a heavy line of arms. This rises like a comet.Ling Xiao bowed his hands to Ling Ling and Ling Xiaotian. He must be grateful to these two people. Otherwise, he may not be able to participate in this game today.Then he arched his hand at the referee seat and the audience.The referee will not say, at least the penalty is fair.In the auditorium, although there are not as many people supporting him as Ling Feifan, it is not without, indicating that the following should also be.Then he walked over with a smile and sat on the first seat in the first row.Ling Yun, who was sitting next to him, saw Ling Xiao coming, almost spitting blood.This thing that he regarded as rubbish, worthless mentioning, actually sat in front of him, actually defeated Ling Fanfan, whom he dreamed of defeating.\"Ling Feifan, you are a waste, actually lost to this garbage, you are not worthy of my opponent!\"Ling Yun shouted loudly.Ling Feifan has gradually recovered at this time. In fact, he was not seriously injured, mainly because it was too expensive.\\nHis eyes glanced over and looked at Ling Yun lightly: \"Is it, then I will challenge you next, let you know what it means to say big words!\"Ling Feifan doesn't want to challenge Ling Xiao for the time being. He has a feeling that Ling Xiao didn't show his full strength in the end.That guy is more terrible than he thought. He has to keep the top three positions first, and then go after it.Although the next game is also very exciting, but to be honest, with the battle between Ling Xiao and Ling Fanfan, the audience always feels that there are shortcomings.Ling Yixue challenged the eighth-ranked disciple, and actually made a breakthrough in the battle.She then challenged the seventh place again, still winning.It was just too difficult to challenge the sixth place. She suffered a lot of injuries and eventually lost.After five chances of challenge, Ling Yixue has been used up. If he can maintain his current results, the seventh place is also very good.After all, like Ling Xiao, she was a disciple who was recruited from outside. It is already remarkable to be able to reach this level when resources are scarce.On talent, she is afraid that she will not lose to Ling Fanfan.As long as the resources are sufficient, it will be very easy to enter the top three next year.\\nLing Yihang chose to abstain. It can be seen that he originally wanted to challenge Ling Xiao, but temporarily changed his mind and turned his attention to Ling Yun.The reason for giving up this round is that he wanted to observe Ling Yun's battle before challenging.In the third round of challenges, Ling Feifan really had to challenge Ling Yun.\"Ling Yun, you said that I was waste, then I will show you today, who is the waste, I now recover less than 50% of the skills, but to win you, one move is enough!\"Facing Ling Xiao said that, it was arrogant.But in the face of Ling Yun's saying, Ling Feifan was completely sure.Because he knows Ling Yun too well, he still dares to say so under the circumstances~www.novelbuddy.com~ That is sure.\"Be careful, the wind flashes!\"Ling Yun naturally refused to let.Ling Feifan didn't say anything. He took out his spear directly this time, and then the tip of the spear locked Ling Yun, and the purple flame burned again.Although this flame is obviously not as good as it was against Ling Xiao before, it is still not to be underestimated.\\nWhisper!In the air, the gang gas was continuously burning, and the purple flame permeated the evil breath, exuding a suffocating terror.When the spear tip jittered, Ling Yun seemed to see the faces of the dead in front of him.He was startled because he knew that it was an illusion, an illusion produced when the pressure was too great.He had thought that this shot was not serious, but when he really faced it, he knew how terrible this shot was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This can be said to be Ling Yun's most terrifying blow under great pressure.However, it is useless.In the face of Ling Feifan's shot, his sword is like a child's trick.The feeling of being completely suppressed made him vomit blood uncomfortably.He couldn't understand.How could such a powerful Ling Feifan lose to Ling Xiao!In front of Ling Feifan, he is a ants!Clang!The spear and the long sword collided together.\\nThe purple-black flame collided with the light blue lightning, and made a scream like something hysterical.Ling Yun just insisted for a moment, his body flew out suddenly.Although he was about to stop at the edge of Biwutai, the stations were unstable, and there was even blood in his mouth.\"I'm a waste, what about you, who can't even take me?\"Ling Feifan almost spread his anger towards Ling Xiao on Ling Yun.Fortunately, he lost half of his skill, otherwise Ling Yun would definitely be seriously injured.\"Ling Feifan challenged Ling Yun's victory and temporarily ranked second. Ling Yun lost his place.\"\"God, Ling Feifan actually defeated Ling Yun in one move. It really looks like he is not strong, it is Ling Xiao that is terrible!\"Some people were puzzled before, thinking that Ling Feifan's strength had declined, and even the top three might not be included.But this time the showdown made them clearly understand that Ling Feifan was not weak, but Ling Xiao was too strong.Ling Xian's face became more ugly.\\nHis two sons, one Ling Feng, was scrapped by Ling Xiao in the knockout.A Ling Yun, although not lost in Ling Xiao's hands, but afraid that the inner blow came from Ling Xiao.How could the little beggar grow to such a level today?He was really a little scared.If he did not find a chance to kill Ling Xiao, he worried that he would be killed by Ling Xiao....After Ling Feifan challenged Ling Yun, Ling Yun immediately challenged Ling Shuang and won.Such repeated challenges.In the last round.Basically, the rankings are all ranked, Ling Xiao first, Ling Feifan second, Ling Yun third, Ling Yihang fourth, Ling Shuang fifth, Ling Yixue sixth, Ling Zhan seventh, Ling Xiaopeng and Ling Dapeng ranked first Eight ninth.Ling Yihang challenged Ling Yun, but unfortunately failed. Although his knife skill is very strong, after all, Ling Yun is superior, and the powerful sword is not a joke.\\nAlthough there were still a few people who had no chance to challenge this round, they chose to give up in the end.The first four challenges, basically see who is strong and who is weak. It is not only a waste of time but also meaningless to challenge again.No one wants to do useless things.\"Okay! That's it for the finals. Next, patriarch Ling Xiaotian announced the final award!\"Ling Xiaotian smiled and slowly stood up from the seat.Although he didn't deliberately release the breath, the kind of breath that belonged to the Wumai Seventh Peak Peak Warrior at the explosion stage was still diffused.Powerful like the terrible seventh-level peak monster in the Fulong Mountains.Many of the disciples trembling involuntarily.Even Ling Feifan and Ling Yun all showed awe.But Ling Xiao's face only had respect and no fear.Respect is because the patriarch is fair, not afraid, not because he is strong, but because he has seen the terrible eighth-level pinnacle monster, and he has also seen the blue clothes that pierced the eighth-level pinnacle monster. woman.\\nSo for the powerhouses of Ling Xiaotian's rank, they are less afraid.What's more, he is now alone in combat strength, which is enough to compete with the martial arts in the early stages of the sixth layer of martial arts.The sturdyness of the qi in the body is not lost to the Wumai Seventh Martial Artist.As long as he is willing, catching up with Ling Xiaotian is only a matter of time.And this time will definitely not be too long.Ling Xiaotian's eyes swept across the disciples instantly, and said like Hong Zhong: \"I am only announcing the top three awards here, and the rest of the awards will be announced on the notice board, and everyone will look carefully at that time.\"He did so, no one would have an opinion.Pay attention to the top three, which is itself the rules of the Ling family.\"Third place, you can choose one top martial arts, two advanced martial arts, in addition, reward Gang Qidan one!\"\"Second place, you can choose one top martial arts, three advanced martial arts, in addition, reward two Qi Dan!\"\"The first place, you can choose three top martial arts, get the opportunity to freely enter and exit the second floor of the bookstore, choose advanced martial arts will no longer be limited, get ten gangqi Dan rewards, in addition, Get a great treasure! The status is equal to that of Ling Pao, and enjoy many privileges!\"\\nWhen Ling Xiaotian announced the first prize, Ling Xiao knew that his choice was right.The first place is obviously richer than the second and third prizes.This is obviously a lot more than the rewards in the previous rumors.In addition to the top martial arts most valued by Ling Xiao, there are also ten rewards of Gang Qi Dan, which even equates to elders in the family.This is awesome, which means that even after seeing Ling Thirteen and Ling Nine, they can sit on par with them.No wonder Ling Feifan was so unpretentious.The prerogative of the first talent hall is too much.\"Okay, except for the top three, the rewards of the rest can be collected from the warehouse. The second and third prizes will be distributed on the spot. As for the remaining rewards, they will naturally be implemented afterwards, don't worry.\"\"In addition to the distribution of Gang Qi Dan on the spot, there is also a special elder token. The remaining rewards will be implemented afterwards because of the choice involved.\"In this way, Ling Xiaotian announced the end of the reward.Ling Xiao, as the No. 1 in the Big Than, UU Reading www.uukanshu.com received ten Gang Qi Dan, and got a token, this token represents his identity as an elder.\\nAs for the rewards of top martial arts, you can find time to collect them after the end.\"The first place is really envious. This reward is too rich. Not only are there three top martial arts rewards, but they also reward all kinds of treasures, and have tokens equal to the identity of elders. Gee.\"\"Yeah, that Ling Xiao took a big advantage this time!\"\"What's cheap, that's the number one that you really get.\"Everyone off the field was naturally envious of Ling Xiao.Ling Feifan stared at Ling Xiao with his teeth clenched, clearly vowing to take back all his own things.Ling Yun was even more gloomy. This time, the big match hit him very hard. Not only did he easily lose to Ling Feifan, but he was even thrown away by Ling Xiao, let alone avenge his brother Ling Feng, it was simply Lost face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

From today, the Ling family will focus on cultivating you, and I hope you will not live up to the pain of the old man.\"Ling Xiaotian is very capable of speaking. Whether he is sincere or not, these words make Ling Xiao very comfortable to listen to.\"If it weren't for the patriarch, Ling Xiao would no longer be eligible to participate in the competition today. Ling Xiao naturally remembers the patriarch's grace.To be honest, he has a bad impression of the entire Ling family, but he has a good impression of this Ling Xiaotian.\"After going back, quickly decide your future direction. A handy weapon can improve the combat power a lot. The treasure of the treasure is too important for you now. You must choose it.\"Ling Xiaotian reminded: \"After choosing, come directly to me to pick up.\"\"Disciples understand.\"\"Okay, go.\"\\n\"Yes!\"Ling Xiao also felt that she should decide what weapon to use.Although unarmed combat sometimes helps a lot, weapons, especially weapons with blessing effects, are too much for a warrior's combat power.Why is the Hundred Step Flying Sword the strongest attack now?It\u2019s not because of how powerful this martial art is, the key is that the breeze sword has a special bonus effect, and it\u2019s an ordinary treasure.\"Ling Xiao, congratulations!\"After receiving the award, Ling Xiao did not intend to stay here. He didn't like the messy atmosphere.But after just two steps, Ling Yihang came.Although he had also defeated Ling Yihang, there was no feud between Ling Yihang, on the contrary, he still appreciated the character of this person.\"You are also very eye-catching.\"\"Hee hee, don't brag about the two of you. This time you won the first one and the fourth one. It's really a long face for our elite hall and the bottom disciples.\"\\nIn the laughter, Ling Yixue's beautiful face appeared.Perhaps because of the good results, Ling Yixue's unsmiling face also had a little more smile.\"You are not bad, Sister.\"Ling Xiao smiled and said: \"The sixth place in the Temple of Genius, this record, I am afraid that many people did not expect it.\"\"How can I compare with you? I really didn't expect that you could defeat Ling Feifan. This is indeed an accident.\"Although Ling Yixue is very optimistic about Ling Xiao, he is very surprised that Ling Xiao can defeat Ling Feifan.\"Actually, I was also lucky. I was chased and killed, and I encountered an adventure in an accident. Only then did I raise the state to the later stage of the Wuzhong Wuzhong, and I also practiced \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body\" to the sixth turn.\"Ling Xiao shook his head and said, \"Speaking of it, I have to thank the man who bought me and murdered me?\"\"Who wants to kill you?\"Ling Yihang exclaimed.\"Ling Thirteen.\"\\nLing Yixue frowned: \"Except him, I can't think of a second person.\"Ling Xiao smiled and said: \"Sister Yixue is really smart, it is indeed Ling Xing.\"\"Then what are you going to do? Now that you are equivalent to the status of an elder, you can go to the patriarch and report Ling Xing.\"Ling Yihang said.\"No.\"Ling Yixue shook his head and said: \"After all, people are flesh and blood, how can they give their son a heavy hand, this matter, for the time being, I can only be forbearing.\"\"Yes.\"Ling Xiao nodded and said: \"I'm not Ling Xing's opponent right now. I can only be forbearing for a while, but if I'm in a hurry, I won't make him feel better.\"If he kills Ling Xian desperately now, he can definitely succeed.\"Okay, don't say this, let's go back together.\"Ling Xiao, Ling Yihang, and Ling Yixue all live near the second man\u2019s house, so they are on the same road, and now they are equivalent to publicly supporting him.\\nAfter all, the Ling family is a family, not a sect, so the position of the patriarch can only be born in Ling Xiaotian's son.Unless one day there is a special accident.Therefore, it is a good idea to support Ling Er now. At least a lot of dark arrows can be helped by Ling Er.\"go!\"When the three left, Ling Yun narrowed her eyes and said to Ling Feifan, \"Ling Feifan, the woman you fancy is indeed extraordinary. I just missed Ling Xiao.\"\"Humph!\"Although Ling Feifan knew that Ling Yun was provoking, he still could not bear Ling Yixue talking and laughing with Ling Xiao.\"That's my woman, no one wants to take it away, Ling Xiao! Today's shame, I will definitely repay it in other days!\"After that, Ling Feifan followed his grandfather, the elder of the Ling family, and left.There are only three elders in the Ling family. It is the strongest existence of the Ling family except Ling Xiaotian. It is normal for Ling Feifan to get his advice and improve his strength quickly.\"Grandchildren, that Ling Xiao only met the adventure and won you, but he is right in one sentence, you lack experience, grandpa is too spoiled for you, then you are ready to go out and experience it. , Other places are too far away, just practice in North Korea, come back once a month!\"\\n\"Grandchildren obey!\"On the other side, the appearance of Ling Yixue walking side by side with Ling Xiao made many Ling's male children envious.But what about envy.Ling Xiao is the No. 1 of Genius Hall, and beauty admiration is normal.It's just that they didn't know that Ling Xiao and Ling Yixue didn't have a love for love at this time.Ling Xiao is very clear that winning the first prize of the year is just the beginning. The painful lesson once taught him that he can only be slain without power.Within the family, there are enemies like Ling Jiu and Ling XIII.Outside the family, he killed Li Xingyun. Although it has not been exposed, there is no airtight wall under the sky.One day, the Li family will know about this matter.When the time comes, the Ling family may not do their best to help him, so he can only continue to improve his strength, so that no matter who comes, he can be without fear.As for Ling Yixue.\\nShe is an orphan, and she has never had the so-called happiness. She just wants to continue to improve her strength. One day she can leave Tianfeng City and leave the Northern Han Dynasty to find the mystery of her life experience.Of course, the two people are somewhat sympathetic to each other, and this must be admitted.After returning home, Grandpa Hong Qi had prepared the dishes and waited.This time Ling Xiao won the first place in Tiancaitang, making Hong Qi really feel excited.Xiao Daitou now officially joined the Ling family and became a child of the Ling family, and was given the name Ling Luo.Of course, these things were arranged by Ling Er, Ling Xiao did not worry much.But if it weren't for him to pass the battle~www.novelbuddy.com~ won the first place in the knockout and the finals, and eventually became the king above all the disciples of Ling's family, it is estimated that Ling Er will not help a little beggar.In this world, there is no love for no reason, no hate for no reason.As long as he is stronger, his family is safer.After eating, Ling Xiao returned to the practice room.In order to rush to participate in the finals, he suspended the practice of impacting the five peaks of martial arts. Now that the finals are over, he has received another ten qi qi.\\nCoupled with the Hantan gold liquid placed in the world of mountains and rivers, it is time to shock.Although he said that he won Ling Feifan this time, his real hole cards are still useless--Martial Will, Into the Soul, Hundred Steps Flying Sword, Shan Wu Wu Soul!If someone thinks he is doing his best to come and trouble him, then he will let the other party know what despair is!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even if you have the Hantan Golden Liquid, the Golden Snow Lotus, and the Gang Qi Dan, you may not be able to improve much.After all, his current \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\" has been cultivated to the fifth floor, and has entered the realm of mastery, and it becomes very difficult to go further.It can be difficult.\\nYou can't choose to give up because of difficulties.He swallowed three Gang Qi Dan in one breath.After all, his level is not low now. If only one qi pill is used at a time, it basically has little effect.After eating the Gang Qi Dan, his Gang Qi was obviously faster and more powerful, and began to expand the fifth Wumai repeatedly.The martial arts under a thousand hammers is the strongest martial arts.Even if the warrior succeeded in impacting all nine martial arts successfully, it could not be said to be over.Because Wumai is a place where internal force is stored, no matter what form your internal force is-either true qi or gangqi, it is always stored and excited through Wumai.The stronger the martial arts, the higher the quality of gang qi and the larger the body mass.Cultivating martial arts is a matter of a lifetime. Impacting success is only the first step.Gang Qidan turned into pure Gang Qi internal force into the fifth martial arts, Ling Xiao did not dare to neglect, and quickly ran the \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\" began to absorb.At the same time, the mountain and river martial arts are also running at the same time, part of the cold liquid stored in the mountain and river world is also extracted from the cold liquid, integrated into his body, and gathered together with the gang gas.Since his own qi volume has already reached the level of the Wumai Seventh Martial Artist, it is actually relatively easy to impact the Wuzhong Peak Realm.\\nStart practicing after eating dinner.In just one hour, he absorbed all the effects of the three gangqi dan, and the fifth martial arts was completely cleared, and he was successfully promoted to the fifth peak of the martial arts.After all, the amount of gang gas is only in quantity.But the promotion to the five peak height of Wumai, this is a big step forward in strength.If you let him fight Ling Lingfan now, it may be easier to win.After all, Ling Feifan is nothing more than the five peaks of Wumai.However, he is not as good as him in terms of strength, skill application, and amount of gang gas, so he is certainly not his opponent.After the realm broke through to the peak of Wumai Wuzhong, it was considered to be a Kaner who wanted to impact Wumai Sixfold, but it was not an overnight matter.So he plans to do something else first.The finger of the blue woman who met before in the Fulong Mountains has been constantly emerging in his mind, making it difficult for him to calm down and practice.So he intends to try to understand that trick first.Even if you can't fully understand its true meaning, as long as you can comprehend about 10% of the standard, it can become his killer question.\\nThinking of this, he gently shook his body, and immediately there was a person exactly like him.That is his martial arts avatar.Has his 30% strength.But the advantage of this Wuhun clone is not strength, but imitation.Wuhun avatar can imitate anyone's moves.Ling Xiao adjusted his strength to about the same level as Wu Hun's doppelganger, and then gave Wu Hun's doppelganger an order to make him imitate the blue woman's attacking moves.\"Come, attack me with all your strength!\"Ling Xiao's body of gold shone, apparently elevating \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\" to the sixth turn.He did not dare to neglect.After all, the blue woman's moves are too horrible.Even the eighth-level peak monster beast Hercules was killed by her. Although the Wuhun avatar is low because of the low level, the power of the show must be low.But he was suppressing his strength at this time, he was not careful.\\nIf it were really killed by Wu Soul, it would be a joke.He didn't let Wu Hun's avatar show mercy.Only in the tempering of life and death can the true combat skills be tempered.Suddenly, Ling Xiao drove Xiangyun Bu to Wuhun Doppelganger, turned into a golden light, and his fists hit the other party like a meteor.He did not intend to be merciful.Anyway, Wuhun's avatar can be recreated without it, as long as he has enough mental strength and qi, he is not afraid to create it.But at this time, Wu Soul's avatar was standing there quietly, and suddenly raised his right hand, so gently.In the eyes of Ling Xiao, there is an almost colorless gangue, as if it is integrated with the whole world, and if he has mountains and rivers and martial spirits, he cannot be found at all.\"It's worse!\"Ling Xiao intuitively felt wrong, hurriedly changed his fists to defense, directly blocking himself.However, at the next moment, his whole body trembles, and his arms and chest are painful.\"stop!\"\\ntoo frightening.Ling Xiao shouted Wu Soul Doppelganger.In just one stroke, his arms and body were penetrated directly.Fortunately, at the critical moment, he avoided the key point, otherwise today he would really die in the practice room.What kind of trick is this, how can it be so scary, is this the legendary martial art?Shook his head.I'm afraid no one can tell him the answer.At the very least, there is none.If you learn this trick, you really have to be invincible under the same level.\"Where is that woman in blue, which is sacred? If she wants to destroy Tianfeng City, no one can stop it.\"Thinking of this, Ling Xiao could not help but take a breath.When he was a child, he often listened to grandpa Hong Qi about some roadside stories.\\nIn the outside world, Tianfeng City doesn't look so peaceful, and no one knows which day a war will break out.No one knows which city will be destroyed directly one day.Human beings are only the humblest race in the whole world, and there are as many as tens of thousands of races in this world.All other races are stronger than humans.There is no reason for it.The key is that mankind has lost the martial spirit that once relied on hegemony!Nowadays, there are few human warriors who can awaken the martial spirit, which is also the biggest reason for human weakness.Of course, he used to listen to it as a story.But since he saw the woman in blue, he didn't think so.Although the appearance of the blue woman belongs to humans~www.novelbuddy.com~, Ling Xiao thinks that she should not be human, because her breath is too different from humans.In this regard, Shan Wu Wu soul also gave the same answer.It's just that the race of the woman is unknown to him.\\nThe reason is that his strength is too poor, which affects the effect of Shan Wu Wu Hun.\"Come on! To live! For loved ones!\"At present, Ling Xiao does not have such a great idea, he will not say to work hard for the entire humanity.Because he is not worthy.With his current strength, there are many people who can kill him.He wants to become stronger, and the terror of the blue woman has become the trick he most wants to understand.\"Come again!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 CultivationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?Ling Xiao's wound has gradually healed. He already had the healing medicine redeemed from the medicine hall, plus the strong recovery effect after the sixth turn of the \"Nine Turns Golden Body Tips\". If it is just an ordinary injury, recover It's relatively easy to get up.In this way, he repeatedly fought with Wuhun Doppelganger in the training room.Every time you have a fight, you have a better understanding of the horror.When this knowledge accumulated to a certain degree, he stopped fighting, sat down cross-legged, and began to comprehend the horror finger.After all, he was not trying to crack that finger, but to learn.Although the blue girl's seemingly random finger is too mysterious, far exceeding the advanced martial arts he learned.But learning so repeatedly.Coupled with the analysis and drill effects of Shan Wu Wu Hun, as well as Ling Xiao's already outstanding talent, after a full night, he still had a big gain.His so-called relatively big gains are actually about 10% of the horror of the blue woman.\\nBut even so, this finger has reached the level of top-level martial arts.How terrifying it would be if it were fully understood.He was ecstatic in his heart.It seems that these injuries on the body today are definitely worth it.There are dozens of holes in his body, large and small, some of which are hemostatic, but they can still be clearly seen.As for clothes, it's already bad.But compared to the harvest, that is obviously more.\"You are so powerful, then just give you a name, just call it a finger of terror.\"Ling Xiao didn't think too much. The reason why he got such a tacky name is because the feeling that this finger lends to him is two words-terror!In this case, why not call it \"terrorist one finger\"?\"The comprehension is almost complete, you can try the power of this trick!\"\\nHe suddenly smiled and looked at Wu Hun Doppelganger: \"You guys have been bullying me all the time, and then I should bully you again. Stand still.\"Ling Xiao rubbed his hands, then suddenly pointed out.A gang of gas that was indistinguishable to the naked eye turned into a blade-like breath and shot out.\"Pooh!\"A hole was shot in Wuhun's shoulder.\"Hahaha, really powerful, but unfortunately I am not skilled enough. Then you can move or even attack me, but you can't use this trick.\"If you only attack a fixed target, then you can't see the terrible of this move.The reason for this horror refers to two main reasons, one is that it is powerful enough.Another aspect is the speed!After showing ten times a finger of terror in a row, Ling Xiao suddenly discovered a phenomenon.Although this horrible finger also consumes gang gas, it consumes very little.This is not a good thing, because energy conservation, it consumes so little gas, it will naturally consume other things.\\nThis horror refers to the most consumed, actually the soul power.Ling Xiao could obviously feel that every time he cast a finger of terror, his soul would be touched.With his current soul power, he can exert ten times at most ten thousand fingers of terror.\"It seems that what is more important next is to enhance the soul power. I don't know if there is a top-level secret method for practicing soul on the third floor of the library. If so, it will be great.\"Thinking of this, he couldn't wait.He stopped the practice directly, left the practice room, entered the room and changed his clothes, and went to the library.But when he walked into the yard he was stunned.A man is kneeling in the yard.A woman.\"Ling Yu, what are you doing?\"Ling Xiao frowned as she looked at the girl kneeling there.Ling Yu knelt there, pear blossoms crying like rain, and there were tears on her cheeks, which made people feel like they wanted to take care.\\nBut that is someone else.Ling Xiao had already given up on this woman.If it was only naughty and mischievous to bully them before, then he abandoned him when he was the most difficult, which really disappointed him.Fortunately, he still has a chance to fall in love with this woman in the future, so it is not sad.It's just disappointment.\"Ling Xiao! I have recognized my heart. In fact, as early as when you were a beggar, I already fell in love with you. At that time, I bullied you, just because I liked you.\"Ling Yu looked at Ling Xiao and said: \"Don't you ever hear of it? It's a curse to love it.\"Ling Xiao felt a nausea. He took a deep breath and said: \"Don't mention the past, we have nothing to do with it. I won't remember how you used to treat me. It's just the two of us. This life is destined to be a stranger. .\"\"Ling Xiao, don't you want to give me a chance? I really like you so much. The reason why I am better with Ling Feng is just to stimulate you and want you to become stronger!\"Ling Yu cried again.This woman is really shameless.Ling Xiao glanced coldly at Ling Yu and said, \"I have already said, you and me, there is no possibility anymore, you go, don't say those despising words, if you stay by Lingfeng now, I might even look at you high.\"\\nLing Yu puffed and fell to the ground.During the knockout, she also thought about the ways she could kill Ling Xiao.Just seeing that Ling Xiao actually defeated Ling Feifan in the finals, she suddenly springed up.With his own charm, he wanted to turn around and look for this silly boy, wouldn't he let him kneel and lick?However, he was disappointed.Ling Xiao's decisiveness and completeness made her completely lose hope.\"Ling Xiao!\"\"Brother!\"Suddenly, two voices came from outside the door, and Ling Xiao's originally irritable mood suddenly improved a lot.One of them was Ling Yihang, and the other was Ling Yixue.When Ling Yu saw Ling Yixue, she seemed to understand something in an instant.Outside the Ling family, she is a proud little princess, and everyone else has to follow his wishes and have to protect her.\\nBut when she arrived at the Ling family, she instantly changed from a beautiful white swan to an ugly duckling that nobody cares about.So she fell, chose to give up her efforts, and turned to rely on appearance to attach to men and Lingfeng.But the same ugly duckling, Ling Yixue chose a completely different path.Ling Yixue did not rely on anyone, nor did she stubbornly, she worked diligently, forgot her beauty, and forgotten how charming she was as a woman.Therefore.The road between the two also created a huge fork.Ling Yu has become a dependency of others, and his strength naturally cannot improve much.Ling Yixue is getting stronger and stronger, and his status is getting higher and higher~www.novelbuddy.com~ With his own strength, he has become a real white swan.In fact, although Ling Yu's qualifications are not as good as that of Ling Yixue, they are not much worse. It can be seen that she can learn the secret technique of Soul Distraction.If she worked as hard as Ling Yixue, it would definitely not be the result today.such a pity.Until this time, she still did not realize her mistakes.\\nShe was just jealous of Ling Yixue frantically. Why could Ling Yixue get Ling Xiao's smile and Ling Xiao's care.And she can't?After clenching her teeth, she turned and ran out of Ling Xiao's house.\"Isn't that woman with Ling Feng? Why did she come to see you?\" Ling Yihang asked suspiciously.\"It's okay, but what are you two doing with me this time?\" Ling Xiao didn't even bother to mention Ling Yu at this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ling Yihang and Ling Yixue suddenly came to find out what was wrong with them.\"Oh, I almost forgot. We are here to ask if you went to the Bookstore to get martial arts.\"Ling Yihang rushed to say.\"For this matter, thank you two for reminding me. Speaking of it, I am about to go.\"Ling Xiao arched his hand and smiled.\"Alas, top martial arts, it is really enviable, I'm missing one.\"Ling Yihang sighed and said that it is impossible to not envy. He is the fourth place in the competition this time, and the top three are only available for top martial arts.\"Brother, please go ahead and choose. The top martial arts matter. It must be carefully selected. We will not disturb you.\"\\nLing Yixue said with a smile.\"Thank you Sister for reminding me, then I will go.\"Ling Xiao said goodbye to Ling Yihang and Ling Yixue, and set off for the library.But on the way, he heard an amazing news.Ling Feifan lost again.Not only did they lose, but this time they suffered even worse, losing to the opponent in one move.\"Who did Ling Feifan lose to?\"Ling Xiao always felt that Ling Feifan was the only disciple of the Ling family who could pose a threat to him. Now that Ling Feifan has actually defeated him, it is impossible for him not to care.\"Brother Ling Xiao!\"Seeing Ling Xiao, the two disciples hurriedly arched their hands.\"You're welcome, who did Ling Feifan lose to?\"\\nHe was not domineering, after all, he also came from the bottom disciples, knowing the tragedy and unhappiness of being bullied.\"Brother Ling Chen!\"\"Ling Chen? Who is Ling Chen?\"Ling Xiao was puzzled. He didn't come to Ling's house for a long time. He really didn't hear the name Ling Chen.\"It\u2019s no wonder that Brother Ling Xiao didn\u2019t know that Brother Ling Chen had defeated Ling Feifan four years ago and won the first prize of that year, when he was only thirteen years old. just came back.\"\"It turns out that, thank you two.\"Ling Xiao took a deep breath, no wonder he didn't know, it was even a genius than Ling Feifan.But it doesn't matter, no matter who it is, it doesn't matter much to him. His important task now is to continue to grow stronger.After thinking about it, he continued to go to the library.\"Brother Ling Xiao is different. The first place in the genius hall is so polite to all of us.\"\"Yeah, much better than Ling Feifan.\"\\nLing Xiao didn't hear the two people's argument, but even if he heard it, it was nothing. He did things, and he never changed because of other people's argument.Not long after, he had arrived at the Bookstore.Today it is not Ling Jiu and Ling Xing that are keeping the Tibetan Bookstore, but Ling Erye.The two met and smiled at each other.If it was said that Ling Er had intended to envelop Ling Xiao and used Ling Xiao as a tool for power struggle, then his mind had changed.He just wanted to make a good relationship with Ling Xiao as much as possible, because he could see that Ling Xiao's future is unlimited and definitely a person worth making.\"Ling Xiao, are you here today for three top martial arts?\"Ling Er asked.\"Ok.\"\"Go, follow me to the third floor. Most of the martial arts there are advanced martial arts, and of course there are a few top martial arts.\"Ling Er Ye walked and introduced Ling Xiao enthusiastically.\\n\"Ling Erye, are there so many top martial arts in the Ling family?\"Ling Xiao asked suspiciously.\"Ling's family is considered to be four major families in Tianfeng City, but it is only a Qipin family in the entire Northern Han Dynasty. There are not many top martial arts, but there are about 20 kinds.\"Ling Erye explained: \"There are six species on the third floor, and the rest are stored on the fourth floor.\"\"Not all top martial arts, why is there such a division?\"Ling Xiao asked puzzled.\"In fact, although there is no clear distinction between top martial arts, the power and scarcity are divided into three grades: entry-level top martial arts, rare top martial arts, and superior top martial arts.\"Ling Er answered.\"Is there still such a division? Huh?\"After Ling Xiao found that he had heard what Ling Er said, there was a new reminder on the mountain and river chart.His \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body\" actually belongs to the top martial arts.\\n\"Xuelian Qi Jue\" is a rare top martial art.\"Xiang Yunbu Hua Jiao\" and \"Niu Mogong Ningsha\" belong to the entry-level top martial arts.No wonder he always feels a bit strange. It is also a top martial art. \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\" is obviously much stronger and difficult to practice.\"This is the third floor, well, you can choose whatever you like. Today, I am here. You will not be limited by any time. Choose well. You must choose the three top martial arts that suit you.\"Ling Er said with a smile.This is a good thing for someone. If Ling Jiu or Ling 13 guard the Tibetan bookstore, I'm afraid he will be troubled again.\"Thank you, Lord Ling.\"Ling Xiao is also not polite. This third layer is not the same as the second layer. The six top martial arts are directly marked, so it is easier to choose.Although advanced martial arts are no longer in his eyes, advanced martial arts can also be used to prove some martial arts skills.So he first read all the advanced martial arts on the third floor and copied them directly into Shanhe World's library.He also copied the six top martial arts.\\nHowever, in order to avoid doubts, he still picked it out pretending to be.Of the six top martial arts, three are the ones he cares about more.One of them is \"Double Shadow Sword\".Ling Xiao thought about it, still prefer the elegant and free of swordsmanship, so in terms of weapons, he intends to try to practice swordsmanship.This \"Double Shadow Swordsmanship\" is an entry-level top swordsmanship. Its advantage is that it can transform three shadow avatars when attacking.These three shadow avatars are exactly the same as the main body. At the strongest, the strength is equivalent to 50% of the main body.This shadow doppelganger attack is not very strong, but fortunately, it can confuse opponents and allow Ling Xiao to perform real killing tricks.In addition, he has Wuhun avatars, which adds up to four avatars. For him, practicing this Double Shadow Sword Technique is definitely more effective.The second top martial art he liked was \"Yu Jianshu Black Iron Roll\". He didn't know what this black iron roll meant, but this was the entry-level top martial arts, which is certain.The effect of this top martial art is similar to that of \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\", except that \"Black Sword of Imperial Sword Technique\" has a higher grade~www.novelbuddy.com~ Both the attack power and speed have been greatly improved.The most important thing is that this \"Black Sword of Royal Sword Art\" can produce a sword shadow, one attack, two swords, the enemy is more defenseless.\\nThe third top martial arts, Ling Xiao selected \"Ning Soul Trick\", which is also a set of entry-level top martial arts, which is a secret method of soul cultivation. There is no other benefit, that is, it can enhance soul power and strengthen soul.But this is particularly important for Ling Xiao.He doesn't plan to watch the other three top martial arts for the time being. He still understands the reason for being greedy and chewy. After all three top martial arts have been cultivated to the point of no improvement, it is too late to practice the other three.The only pity is that the top martial arts placed in this third layer are all entry-level top martial arts.But think about it too.The Ling family has about 20 kinds of top martial arts in total. It is already generous to put six books on the third floor. It is estimated that the rest are on the fourth floor. Unfortunately, he has no chance to go up now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Don't worry.\"Ling Xiao said.Ling Er sighed: \"This Double Shadow Swordsmanship was originally positioned as a top martial art because it can not only confuse opponents, but also has a terrible attack, because the three shadow avatars and the main body attack Can be superimposed, the power is even close to the legendary martial arts.\"\"Why did it become an entry-level top martial art?\"\"Alas, helplessness is helpless here. This martial art is extremely difficult to practice. After putting it in the Ling family for so many years, no one has succeeded in practicing, just because the avatar can't condense out, and practicing is also white practice.\"\\nLing Er said with a wry smile.\"If this is the case, then I will choose it even more. If others can't practice it, then it's unique.\"Ling Xiao thought of the \"Xiang Yunbu\" and \"Bull Magic Gong\" he got, and always felt that since the \"Double Shadow Swordsmanship\" was once positioned as a top martial art, he definitely had his reasons.\"Double Shadow Swordsmanship\" is divided into six layers, and there is only one cultivation requirement, that is, the practitioner must have a solid skill, otherwise it will never be a clone.Earlier Ling Er has said before, the most terrifying thing about this sword is that the attack of the body and the avatar can be superimposed.Once you reach the top level, the three avatars plus the body attack can increase the attack power by nearly twice. If you simply discuss the attack power, I am afraid that it is the top of the top martial arts.\"Since you want to choose it, I can't stop you, but I still have to say some things.\"Ling Erye said seriously, \"Our patriarch once practiced this martial art, but at the end of training, he still couldn't condense a doppelganger. Finally, he gave up helplessly, so there was a rumor that it was this martial art. Although learning is a top martial art, it requires extraordinary martial arts to be able to practice successfully.\"\"Is Ling Er thinking that I can't succeed either?\"Ling Xiao asked with a smile.\\nLing Er froze for a moment, and suddenly fell into contemplation.Yes, the \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\" is also a top martial art that is extremely difficult to practice. This kid has successfully cultivated, so it may not be possible to create another miracle.\"I believe you!\"Ling Er said suddenly: \"You can cultivate basic martial arts and advanced martial arts to the realm. This kind of talent and comprehension ability can't even be compared to the old man. \"Ghost Sword\" has been dusted for so many years. I really want to open it in your hands.\"\"of course.\"Ling Xiao said confidently.The reason why he is so confident is not that his talent must be stronger than Ling Xiaotian, but because Wuhe Soul has already told him the answer.The method of condensing avatars in \"Double Shadow Swordsmanship\" is exactly the same as Wuhun avatar. That avatar is the combination of soul power and gang qi.Most people do not have martial spirits, and of course they cannot condense their avatars. This swordsmanship cannot be cultivated naturally.But he can.\\n\"If you can successfully practice the \"Ghost Sword\", you may be able to fight Ling Chen.\"Ling Er touched his chin.\"Ling Chen? It was Ling Chen who just came back?\" Ling Xiao asked with a frown.This Ling Chen seems to be very popular, as soon as he came back, he received the attention of all the people in the family. The limelight completely overshadowed him this year.\"Yes, it is him. This son seems to have realized some of the extraordinary martial arts fragments. His strength is beyond imagination. He can easily defeat Ling Feifan in one move. Can you do it?\"Ling Er asked.\"Not for the time being.\"Ling Xiao thought about it and shook his head.\"Well, you are very humble and honest, but I believe in your potential to surpass Ling Chen sooner or later.\"Ling Er said with a smile: \"But you should also note that Ling Chen is the son of Ling Thirteen, and won the favor of the patriarch. I am afraid that if he returns this time, he may be taken to the fourth floor to observe the extraordinary martial arts fragments. He was stern in school, and vigorously cultivated by the family. It might be that even the thousand-year-old snow lotus collected by the family would give him one or two.\"\\n\"Ling Chen is actually the son of Ling Thirteen?\"Ling Xiao was a little surprised.\"You're afraid I don't know. My brother has three sons and a daughter-Feng, Chen, Yun, Xia, but Ling Feng and Ling Yun are all in the family, and Ling Chen worshipped a Ranger as a master at the age of 13, Traveling abroad, Yunxia is even more powerful, and you will know later.\"Ling Er said with a bitter smile: \"Although you have outstanding results, after all, you are an outsider, Ling Chen is the grandson of the old man, and you will get more than you.\"He is really worthless for Ling Xiao. In any case, Ling Xiao was the first in this competition, and he defeated Ling Feifan, one of the four sons of Tianfeng City.It stands to reason that Ling Xiao is the disciple who is qualified to be brought into the fourth floor to observe.Nai Lingchen suddenly returned.The fourth floor of the Lingjia Bookstore has always had a rule. Within a year, only two people could be brought in to observe.Ling Chen is definitely one.Another place, I am afraid that Ling extraordinary.\\nAs the grandson of Taishang elder, Ling Feifan's status is not lower than Ling Chen.He told Ling Xiao to listen to it, he just wanted to win the favor of Ling Xiao.Because it is somewhat similar to Ling Xiao, Ling Erye is just the so-called \"wild species\" born by Ling Xiaotian outside, and has no status in the family.Despite his outstanding qualifications, he was outstanding among Ling Xiaotian's thirteen sons, but he did not receive much attention.Even so far, Ling Er could not even bring his own biological mother to live in the Ling family's ancestral home.\"Thank you Ling Er for telling me this, but is the fourth level only the fragments of extraordinary martial arts? There is no complete extraordinary martial arts?\"Ling Xiao asked excitedly.\"As far as I know, the four major families in Tianfeng City have no complete martial arts, and even the fragments are only four or five.\"Ling Er shook his head and said, \"You must know that extraordinary martial arts are martial arts above the secular martial arts, and only those who have cultivated to the martial arts ninth level are eligible to obtain and practice.\"\"It turns out that I am at ease.\"\\nIf you really let Ling Chen and Ling Feifan get the extraordinary martial arts, UU reading books www.uukansshu. com then he had no chance.\"Ling Erye just said that the three top martial arts I chose are not suitable. I already know the reason for \"Double Shadow Sword\", what about the other two?\"Ling Xiao quickly changed the subject, he did not want to struggle too much about things he could not change.\"\"Black Sword of Imperial Sword Art\" is also a good martial art, but it needs a flying sword art as the foundation. This flying sword art is best advanced martial arts, and cultivated to the realm, otherwise it cannot be cultivated.\"Ling Erye said: \"And this martial art also needs good flying swords to use together. Flying swords are shorter and thinner than ordinary long swords. They are difficult to build and very rare.\"\"I see, what about \"The Soul Gathering\"?\"Ling Xiao secretly rejoiced that he had practiced \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\", and he had already reached the level of transcendence. He was absolutely qualified to practice this \"Black Sword of Imperial Sword Technique\". All the treasures can be used for a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We human warriors tend to focus on qi. We don't need to deliberately cultivate soul power. Instead, we have a soul race that specializes in soul power. All martial arts are released with soul power. .\"Ling Erye explained.\"It turns out this is the case, but in case of encountering the kind of soul retraction that Ling Yu used before, if the soul is not strong, it will still be a disadvantage. I will choose these three top martial arts.\"Ling Xiao randomly found an excuse to pass by.Ling Erye said nothing more.Geniuses always have a genius personality, and they are generally stubborn. They are more willing to take their own path, and others may not be suitable.\"Go, register, and then you can leave.\"The secrets of martial arts in the Bookstore are generally copies, which were originally hidden in more secret places, so it\u2019s okay to take them out.\\nIt's just that you have to return it by the specified time.For example, this top martial arts must be registered once every seven days, this is also to avoid someone taking cheats out of cultivation, in case of being robbed, then the loss will be great.Even if it is only the entry-level top martial arts, that is also the top martial arts. Once lost, for the Lings, it is really a major earthquake event.After all, the Ling family has only about 20 kinds of top martial arts.Ling Xiao went to the first floor with Ling Er, just arrived on the first floor and saw Ling Xiaotian and Taishang elder Ling Yin standing there.There are two young people behind them.One is Ling Fanfan in a purple robe.The other one is a young man in a white scribe shirt, it is estimated to be Ling Chen.Ling Yin is naturally Ling's grandfather.\"Ling Wuhen, how do you keep the bookstore, the first floor has been empty for so long?\"Ling Wuhen is the name of Ling Erye.\\nLing Yin was fierce as soon as she came up, and apparently did not like Ling Wuhen.\"The elder Taishang does not have to blame him, I let him help Ling Xiao to choose the top martial arts.\"Before waiting for Ling Wuhen to reply, Ling Xiaotian had first released the siege for him.\"Humph!\"When Ling Yin heard this, her face was not very good-looking, but there was nothing to say. Ling Xiaotian's position was very stable, even if he was too elder, he could not suppress the patriarch.\"Patriarch!\"Ling Xiao rushed to Ling Xiaotian arched his hand.\"Oh, have you chosen all?\" Ling Xiaotian asked with a smile.\"People Qijun, the disciples have selected three top martial arts and are about to register to leave.\"Ling Xiao didn't even look at the Taishang elder Ling. He was a vengeful man. The Taishang elder, regardless of his face, actually attacked him in Dabi, which is really hateful.Unless he is not such a man, he must learn this old thing.\\n\"Exactly, you still have a reward for a rare treasure, you don't know what you plan to do?\" Ling Xiaotian asked again.\"sword!\"Ling Xiao replied.\"Good choice, sword, ancient sacred goods, supreme and noble, the gods of human beings. It is the ancestor of short soldiers, a weapon of close combat, with profound skills in Taoism, and then into the legend of the mystery. Sword and art have always been vertical and horizontal since ancient times. The battlefield, dominating the martial arts, standing in the country, and doing good deeds, so it is still loved by people around the world, and it is deeply rooted in the people\u2019s hearts with its glorious history.Ling Xiaotian smashed his beard with a smile and said, \"The sword has double-edged blades with straight heads, which can injure people horizontally and penetrate through stabs. It is dangerous and anomalous, born to kill! Choosing a sword as a weapon means choosing to attack mainly. , It seems that you are also a person who likes to take the initiative to attack.\"Speaking of which.Ling Xiaotian waved his hand, and a long sword appeared in his hand.\"This sword is named Bingli Sword, and all the treasures are given to you today. I hope you can continue to improve your skills and add glory to the Ling family!\"\"Patriarch Xie!\"Ling Xiao took the ice glass sword and felt a chill when he started.This sword should be built by Hantie, but it is very suitable for use with his \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\".\\n\"It's better to use such a good sword for my brother.\"Suddenly, Ling Chen spoke.While speaking, he actually reached out his palm and tried to grab the ice glass sword from Ling Xiao's hand.Ling Xiao can feel that Ling Chen's realm is probably already more than sixfold in Wumai, and he is really not an opponent because of his extraordinary martial arts.However, if the opponent was so easily taken away by Binglijian, Ling Xiao would be too embarrassed.Stepping on the foot, Ling Xiao's body quickly retreated, \"Xiang Yunbu \u00b7 Jiao Jiao\" was launched, and it was as fast as electricity.However, Ling Chen is really powerful. His body style is not worse than Ling Xiao. He can enter as many times as Ling Xiao retreats.\"enough!\"Ling Wuhen shouted and reached out to stop Ling Chen.Although Ling Chen is unparalleled in genius, his strength at this time is not as good as that of Ling Wuhen.\"This seat guards the Book Shelves today, and you are not allowed to come here!\"\\n\"Oh, I'm just kidding, why shouldn't Erbo get angry?\"Ling Chen gave up, looked at Ling Xiao with a smile, and said, \"Can you still hide behind my second uncle for a lifetime.\"Ling Xiao lightly smiled and said, \"You are six years old, and you are 13 years old, but it's just Wumai triple. It took seven full years, and it took me half a month from Wumai first to Wumai fifth. Time, I am not your opponent now, but who knows what happens in a few days?\"\"Something!\"Ling Chen's face sneered, and then stepped up to the second floor, and dropped a sentence: \"I will go to the fourth floor today to understand other extraordinary martial arts mystery, but also to learn rare and even top-notch Martial arts, what do you compare with me, ha ha ha!\"Ling Xiao knew that Ling Chen said this intentionally.And he did feel very unhappy at that moment.But after a while, he calmed down.Man can't be too greedy, he already has the Wu Wu soul, why should he be angry?So in the face of Ling Chen's provocation, he walked over to look for the second top martial arts, and then left the bookstore.At that time, Ling Chong, Ling Feng, Ling Yun and Ling Feifan all looked down upon me so much, but they have been defeated by me one by one.\\nAlthough your Ling Chen is stronger than them, it is just a stepping stone for me to become stronger. Just look.After leaving the library, Ling Xiao returned directly to his home, and then entered the practice room to practice.He first practiced \"Black Sword of Imperial Sword Art\".The reason for choosing this first is mainly because he already has \"Niu Mogong \u00b7 Bai Bu Fei Sword Skill\".The two are interlinked, only a higher grade.Therefore, based on \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\", practicing \"Black Sword of Imperial Sword Technique\", UU reading www.uukanshu.com is naturally more effective with better results.Because of this, just one hour later, his \"Black Sword of Imperial Sword Art\" has been successfully introduced and cultivated to the first level.Compared with the previous \"Hundred Steps Flying Sword Technique\", it is more powerful and can be transformed into two sword shadows.Adding the flying sword itself, then one sword and three shadows.These three swords can not only attack in groups, but also attack one person in a stack, but they need a strong soul to manipulate.In conjunction with \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Ningsha\", this is only the entry-level top martial arts \"Yu Jianshu black iron volume\", can fully achieve the power of rare level top martial arts.\\nOf course, if you want to match the \"Bull Demon Skill\", you must first practice the \"Black Sword of the Sword Art\" to Dacheng Realm, and then let the \"Bull Demon Skill Ningsha\" be swallowed up.So in the next few days, he did not touch the \"Ghost Sword\", but put his heart and soul on \"The Sword of Iron Sword\" and \"The Soul of Ning\".Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 Successive breakthroughPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?The reason why Ling Xiao practiced the \"Ning Soul Trick\" was naturally because the \"Black Sword of Imperial Sword Art\" required a lot of soul power.But even so, with the help of Shan Wu Wu Soul's powerful analysis and drill capabilities, in just five days, he used two entry-level top martial arts, \"Black Sword of Imperial Sword Art\" and \"Ning Soul Juice\", At the same time, cultivation reached a state of perfection.I just want to cultivate to the environment, I am afraid I still need some opportunities.He is not in a hurry. Some things need to be promoted in the battle to reach the state of perfection. He is already content.Reaching the state of consummation, he didn't think about it, so he used \"Niu Mogong Ningsha\" to devour these two entry-level top martial arts.The top martial arts deserve to be the top martial arts, and there are only two kinds of them, which make \"Niu Mogong\" promoted again.At this time, \"Niu Mogong\" has changed from \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Ningsha\" to \"Niu Mogong\u00b7Form\".According to the tips on the pictures of mountains and rivers, \"Bull Demon Skill\" is promoted to the \"form\" stage. Shaqi can be directly condensed into the shape of the bull demon and attached to the body of the warrior.\\nLing Xiao has always felt that this \"Bull Demon Skill\" is a little weird. I don't know if he will practice to a certain extent in the future, will he directly have the fighting ability of the Bull Demon Clan.The Bull Demon Race is among the most terrifying of all races.Of course, this is just a matter of thinking, and the improvement of this stage of \"Modification\" is enough for him now.In the following time, he intends to practice \"Ghost Sword\" with all his heart.\"Double Shadow Swordsmanship\" is essentially the best top martial arts, and it is the best among top martial arts.Therefore, it is the most powerful and the most difficult to practice. You must know that even Ling Xiaotian, the head of the Ling family, cannot succeed in cultivation.This is why Ling Xiao put it at the end of cultivation.After leaving the training room, Ling Xiao added a little dry food and heard something from Ling Luo.It is said that three days ago, Ling Feifan had left the Ling family and went out to practice.While Ling Chen was retreating in the third floor of the bookstore and did not know what martial arts.This news did bring a little pressure to Ling Xiao, but this pressure also happens to be the driving force.\\nThe opponents are improving, so he must work harder.Closing his eyes, Ling Xiao began to concentrate on comprehension of \"Double Shadow Sword\".But as he expected, the superior top martial arts are obviously much more difficult to practice.\"Nine turn gold body tactic\" is also a top martial art, relying on a large amount of gold and Hantan gold liquid, only to practice the sixth turn.This \"Double Shadow Swordsmanship\" is no simpler than \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\".Just comprehension is enough to make people uncomfortable.If it weren't for the powerful analysis and drill ability of You Wu Shan Hun, it would only be a month, or even a few years, he might not have much to gain.And now, after spending a day, he finally has a glimpse of \"Double Shadow Sword\".The key to this martial art lies in comprehension.Once it is thoroughly eaten, it is easier to practice.\"Sure enough it's not easy. What is needed is the combination of soul power, gang qi and martial spirit, in order to condense a doppelganger, which is really not what ordinary martial artists can do!\"\\nBut the harder it is, the more happy Ling Xiao is.If others do not succeed in cultivation, if he succeeds in cultivation, he will inevitably occupy a relatively large advantage.This martial art practice is not a joke, because it involves the soul power, it is easy to get out of the way.So how difficult is it, only the cultivators really know.In order to fully immerse himself in cultivation, Ling Xiao even directly used \"into the soul\" to enter a state where he was in complete control of everything.In this way, even if there is a little problem, he can find and correct it in time.For others, the very dangerous martial arts came to him, but in fact the danger has basically been ruled out.Since the \"Condensation Soul\" has been cultivated to a satisfactory level, Ling Xiao's \"into the soul\" state has also lasted longer.It is no problem to maintain one hour now.After just one hour, you have to rest for at least one quarter of an hour.In this quarter of an hour, Ling Xiao no longer cultivates, but condenses Wu soul avatar, to see Wu soul scattered and repeatedly practice \"Ghost Sword\".\\nNot only can you find problems in your previous practice, but you can further deepen your impressions, and you won\u2019t waste time.Finally, after three days, Ling Xiao's \"Ghost Sword\" practiced to the first level, which is an entry.During the attack, a shadow avatar can be differentiated, and its strength is about 30% of his body.Once superimposed, it means that he can increase the attack power by 30% in one attack.Of course, this is just the beginning.The second layer of \"Double Shadow Swordsmanship\" will condense a second shadow avatar, and its strength will be improved even more.Although it is more difficult to practice than the first layer, but with the first layer as the foundation, this layer is not as difficult as expected.During the cultivation process, he took a gangqi pill and spent four days breaking through to the second floor in one fell swoop.In terms of attack power alone, the second layer of \"Ghosting Sword Technique\" has now reached the perfect level of advanced martial arts.It's just the second floor.This makes Ling Xiao very excited.\\nSo he continued to intensify his cultivation.However, from the second floor to the third floor, cultivation encountered problems.Not that there is no improvement, but the difficulty becomes greater and the speed of improvement becomes extremely slow.It took a whole month. Because of his continuous use of \"into the soul\", he increased the duration of \"into the soul\" by a quarter of an hour.However, this \"Double Shadow Swordsmanship\" was only able to rise to the second peak, as if it had encountered a wall and could not cross it.If this wall is traversed, he will naturally be able to raise the Double Shadow Sword to the third level.There will also be an additional shadow avatar on the third floor, which will naturally increase the power.What is the problem?Through analysis, Ling Xiao finally found the answer to the question.It is still too low.If he can elevate the realm to the sixth level of Wumai, I believe it will be much easier to break through the third level of Double Shadow Sword.\\n...Thinking of this, Ling Xiao will no longer drill the horns, he began to practice \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\".The Hantan gold liquid in the mountain and river world in the body still exists. Use the Hantan gold liquid to enhance the \"Snow Lotus Qi Secret\", plus the remaining three gangqi pill, breaking the state to the sixfold of the Wumai in one fell swoop, it is not bad. Possible things.Once this is practiced, half a month has passed.One night after half a month~www.novelbuddy.com~ There was a huge roar in the practice room.Of course, you can't hear it outside.The sound insulation effect of this practice room is still very good.\"Breakthrough!\"Ling Xiao's face showed fatigue, but he was very excited.\"Xuelian Qi Jue\" finally practiced to the seventh floor and entered the Dacheng realm.At the same time, he also broke through the resistance of the fifth martial arts and entered the practice of the sixth martial arts.\\nSixfold Wumai!The cold in the Hantan Golden Liquid has also been absorbed. It is estimated that from here onwards, if you want to make \"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\" so fast, then you can only find other things that can replace Hantan Too.Of course, Golden Snow Lotus is one of them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now, simply talking about the volume of gangqi, I am afraid that he has not lost to the Wuzhong Qizhong mid-term martial arts.With the breakthrough of the realm, the power of martial arts should all be improved. What Ling Xiao wants most now is to find an opponent to discuss.In this way, you can know how much your martial arts power has improved.Thinking of this, he walked out of the training room, refreshed it, and had a good meal before going to Ling Yihang.Ling Yihang's residence is relatively close to him, his strength is not weak, and it is more convenient to learn.But this kid was not at home today.According to their family, Ling Yihang went to the Fulong Mountains.I guess I want to go out and hone it.\\nAfter all, Ling Yihang is good at swordsmanship. The swordsmanship is about killing, not many monsters, it is difficult to practice the kind of domineering that belongs to the swordsmanship.\"Brother, are you looking for Ling Yihang again?\"Ling Yihang was not found, but Ling Xiao unexpectedly encountered Ling Yixue.At this time, Ling Yixue's state has broken through the early stage of Wumai Wuzhong, but this is not surprising. The most strange thing is that Ling Yixue's body actually belongs to the blue woman in the forest that day. Breath.Soul race?Or did you practice the secret method of the Soul Race?Ling Xiao shook his head without thinking too much about whether Ling Yixue was a human being and what he had cultivated, but he didn't really care.He just needs to know that Ling Yixue treated him well, which is enough.\"Yes, I just made a breakthrough, so I wanted to try Ling Yihang, but this kid is not here.\"Ling Xiao smiled bitterly.\"It's okay, I'll be your sparring partner, and I happen to have something to verify.\"\\nLing Yixue chuckled lightly.\"This is great.\"Ling Xiao is really getting itchy now, just made a breakthrough, and hopes to verify his strength. Ling Yixue is a more suitable training partner.\"Sister Sister is helping me today, so Sister Sister will do it first.\"Ling Xiao made a please gesture.\"Then I'm welcome.\"Ling Yixue nodded and said, \"Younger brother, be careful. My move is a family heirloom, not a martial art of the Ling family. I don't even know what level it is, but it's powerful.\"\"understand!\"Ling Xiao did not dare to neglect and made a defensive posture.\"coming!\"Ling Yixue Jiao was not able to see what she did, but Ling Xiao felt a great crisis.\\n\"underground?\"At that moment, Ling Xiao rose into the sky, and the entry-level top-level technique of \"Xiangyunbu Huajiao\" failed to escape, and was stuck to the right leg by a lotus under the ground.Then the ice lotus instantly froze, holding Ling Xiao's right leg.\"broken!\"Ling Xiao's gas burst, easily shattering the ice cubes and coming out of the trap.But be aware that he used the Wuqi Liuzhong qi.\"puff!\"Ling Yixue suddenly spouted blood and smiled bitterly: \"With this move, I can instantly kill the sixth-level lower-level monsters and beasts. I didn't expect you to be able to cause any harm to your brother.\"\"Sister, is this mystery?\"Ling Xiao asked.\"Well, this is the family secret mystery engraved in my mind-\"Earth Heart Ice Lotus Bound\". This mystery is nine centimeters in height. I am currently only practicing to the limit of the Xiaocheng Realm, which is only the third level.\"\\nLing Yixue replied.\"If I guessed right, besides using gang qi, this should also cooperate with soul power?\"\"Yes, brother, how do you know?\"Ling Yixue asked in surprise.\"Sister, come over here!\"Ling Xiao beckoned.Although Ling Yixue was a little puzzled, but with her understanding of Ling Xiao, she thought Ling Xiao would not harm her, so she walked over.Suddenly, Ling Xiao pointed at Ling Yixue's forehead, and the souls of the two came in close contact.\"\"The Soul Condensation Technique\"? The entry-level top secret method? The secret method specializing in the cultivation of soul?\"Ling Yixue looked at Ling Xiao in shock and said: \"Brother, this is not very good, if you let the family know that you pass this thing to me, I'm afraid it will happen.\"\"What's the matter, are Ling Xing, Ling Jiu, and others still passing on advanced martial arts to their undisputed sons?\"\\nLing Xiao didn't care.He also doesn't want to be a lonely man, but he still has to cultivate some friends or helpers for himself in the family.Ling Yixue counts as one, and Ling Yihang also counts as one, so that once something goes wrong, it won't be borne alone.Besides, \"The Soul of Condensation\" is not a great top martial art, it is just an entry level. This level of top martial arts can still be photographed at the auction.\"Okay, thank you very much, but in return, I can't hide it. This \"Earth Binglian Bound\" should be regarded as a return.\"Ling Yixue thought about it, and also passed his secret method to Ling Xiao.Although it is a family secret method, as long as it is not extraordinary martial arts, it will not be a problem if it is passed on, not to mention that Ling Yixue does not like to owe others the favor.Ling Xiao shook his head and said: \"If I am not wrong, \"Earth Heart Binglian\" should belong to the top martial arts, so, I accept this secret method, but I will send you another top martial arts as compensation Right.\"He got six top martial arts from the third floor of the bookstore. Currently he has learned three, and the remaining three are not suitable for him.In particular, one of the entry-level top-level defense martial arts is called \"Colorful Xia Yi\". Although it is not as good as \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\", it is expensive to practice and is only suitable for girls.This is even to borrow flowers to offer Buddha.\\nLing Yixue was no longer polite, the two exchanged martial arts, and they were very satisfied.And at the moment when the soul of Fang Cai touched, although both of them didn't point out, they both knew that the distance between the two was narrowed because of that.\"Sister, the key to \"Earth Heart Ice Lotus Bond\" is soul power. Gangqi is only an aid. When you use it, there is a certain deviation. And the secret of this secret method is sneak attack. It is best to use it suddenly during battle. If the other party doesn\u2019t know, then there is almost a 10% certainty that the other party will be successful.\"Ling Xiao reminded.\"Thank you, Brother, for your guidance, then let me teach you the skills of the following brothers.\"Ling Yixue knew that she was definitely not Ling Xiao's opponent, but since she agreed to do sparring, she would not go back on her words.Of course, Ling Xiao will not press people with the realm, so there is nothing to test. He intends to press the realm to the level of Yu Ling Yixue, and then check the power of the following \"Ghost Sword\".The result is quite amazing.Ling Yixue blocked Ling Xiao's attack ~www.novelbuddy.com~ but did not expect to be a shadow avatar.The result was that Ling Xiao put the long sword on his neck without resistance.\"Brother, you actually practiced the legendary \"Ghost Sword\", but this is the top martial art in the Ling family who is reputed to be impossible to practice successfully. All the people who entered the third floor of the library are not Anyone will choose this martial art.\"\\nLing Yixue was inexplicably shocked.For Ling Xiao, she felt even more mysterious.\"Good luck.\"Ling Xiao smiled, not explaining much.Ling Yixue did not ask, she is not that kind of annoying woman, after all everyone has their own secrets, really want to break the casserole and ask the end, the commander Zengren is bored.\"Ling Yixue, you are a bitch!\"Suddenly, an angry voice came from the wall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although she said she is desperately practicing, she is not as good as she and Ling Yihang.If you try again, although she dare not say that she will win Lingyun steadily, she can definitely guarantee that she will not lose within a hundred strokes.So she is not afraid of Ling Yun now.\"Pretend to be stupid! You have something to do with Ling Feifan. Now that Ling Feifan has gone out and hasn't returned, but you hooked up with Ling Xiao, aren't you sluts?\"\\nLing Yun whispered.\"Ling Feifan is indeed chasing me, but I did not make any promises to him. As a disciple of the Ling family, you insult me \u200b\u200btoday and you must apologize!\"Ling Yixue's brows were slightly wrinkled, and his face was not pretty.\"What about insulting you, bitch!\"Ling Yun is very crazy.Obviously because Ling Chen was beside him, he was not afraid of Ling Xiao.\"Get me off!\"Ling Xiao can't stand it any longer, but here is his yard, it's just that Ling Chen and Ling Yun are standing on the courtyard wall.Ling Yun actually dared to speak badly and insulted Ling Yixue and him. If he could bear it, wouldn't Ling Xiao become his grandson?During the speech, Ling Xiao suddenly shot, and actually used the \"Earth Heart Binglian Binder\" that Ling Yixue had used.Only his hand is obviously more beautiful than Ling Yixue.Binglian came out from the void, directly frozen Ling Yun, and then he was caught back by him.\\nA set of movements are so coherent that Ling Chen next to them is too late to save.\"Let him go!\"Ling Chen looked at Ling Xiao and said coldly.\"If he kneels down and apologizes, I will naturally let him go!\"Ling Xiao did not have any affection for Ling Chen. When he was in the bookstore, he actually grabbed his ice glass sword in front of the patriarch, the second grandfather and the elder Ling Yin.He didn't break out because he knew he was not Ling Chen's opponent.But today, it may not be necessary.\"I told you to let him go! Then I knelt down to pay my brother's guilt, and obediently handed over the **** Ling Yixue, I just did not happen today.\"Ling Chen put his hands behind his back, with a high toe look, completely did not put Ling Xiao in his eyes.\"Hahaha, what kind of thing do you dare to talk to me like this? My status is equivalent to that of the elders in the door. You don't kneel and salute when you see me. Instead, you are so crazy, is it that you want to rebel?\"Ling Xiao laughed suddenly, and then stepped on Ling Yun's body.Ling Yun at this moment, although aware of his consciousness, was stepped on the ground like a dead dog and could not move.\\nHe can't wait to commit suicide.At first, he was also the second disciple of Genius Hall anyway, but now he is so insulted.\"Elder?\"Ling Chen said disdainfully: \"Ling Xiaoling, the head of the Ling family, is my dear grandfather! Are you kneeling or not?\"\"I should ask you this!\"Ling Xiao knew that Ling Chen was great, so Ling Yun was first handed over to Ling Yixue, and he wanted to make a break with Ling Chen here.He didn't forget the hatred in the library.\"court death!\"Ling Chen was really angry. At the Ling family, including that first day talent, Ling Feifan didn\u2019t dare to talk to him like that.

At that time, he saw that the elders of Taishang and the patriarch had no consideration.Now Ling Chen has dared to break into his mansion and provoke his people.If he didn't do anything, his reputation as Ling Wuhen would be forgotten.\"Two uncles, are you going to protect him?\" Ling Chen looked at Ling Wuhen and sneered a little.\"He doesn't need me to protect, but you have no respect, I will teach you the 13th brother today!\"After all, Ling Wuhen suddenly shot.Perhaps it has not been shot for a long time, many people have forgotten that Ling Wuhen is the second master of the Ling family after Ling Xiaotian.His shot was powerful.Ling Chen was already the early martial arts martial artist, but in the face of Ling Wuhen, he had no resistance at all.Ling Wuhen hit Ling Chen on the ground with just one move.\\n\"Apologize, then get out!\"Ling Wuzhen didn't talk much, but he was domineering.Ling Chen's mouth moved, and finally arched towards Ling Xiao and said: \"Sorry!\"\"Ling Xiao, give me a face and let Ling Yun go. He is the son of my thirteenth brother after all.\"Ling Wuhen looked at Ling Xiao and said politely, without the slightest command.\"Ling Er's face must be given to me, but Ling Yun must kneel down to apologize to Sister Yixue. I have already spoken this sentence and I cannot take it back.\"He didn't want to refute Ling Wuhen's face, but some things still had to be insisted on, especially in front of Ling Yixue.\"Did you hear Ling Yun?\"Ling Wujian glanced at Ling Yun as if he were a dead dog.Ling Yun's heart was sad, but there was no way. This is Ling Wuhen's house, and it was wrong for them to break in, even if it was reported to the patriarch.He could feel that if he didn't kneel and apologize now, Ling Xiao would definitely abolish him, this person was terrible.\"Sorry! I shouldn't be talking nonsense!\"\\nFinally, Ling Yun stiffened and kneeled on the ground, Chong Ling Yixue said.\"get out!\"Ling Xiao waved his hand before the ice on Ling Yun's body was lifted.Ling Yun didn't dare to say anything, and fled in embarrassment.\"Ling Xiao, I am negligent in this matter.\"After Ling Chen and Ling Yun left, Ling Wuhen smiled bitterly.\"Ling Erye does not have to blame himself. Although this house belongs to you, it is still Ling family. After all, Ling Chen is so powerful that most people can't stop it. Forget it, no big deal happened anyway.\"Ling Xiao did not want to continue to struggle with this matter.\"It's worthy of Ling Xiao, everything is handled neatly and cleanly, without dragging mud and water, it's no wonder that cultivation has entered the country so quickly.Ling Er said with a smile: \"Since you two are here today, I will tell you one thing by the way.\"\"Second Lord but it's okay.\"Ling Xiao nodded.\\nLing Yixue also nodded~www.novelbuddy.com~Do you know how to get the name of the four sons of Tianfeng City? \"Ling Wuhen asked.Both shook their heads. They were so absorbed in martial arts that they really did not care too much about these things.\"In fact, after the annual big competition of all ethnic groups, the city lords of Tianfeng City will invite geniuses of all ethnic groups to the city lord's palace for a competition. The top four will be given the title of son, and they will also receive many real benefits.\"Ling Wuhen explained: \"This competition is known as the Tianfeng City's \"Tianfeng Festival\". There are only 20 people in total, and the age limit is under 20 years old. Each of the four major families can have four people.

With the body, it can be changed from one-on-one to five-on-one at a time, and the opponent can't be caught off guard.\"Sure enough, the bottleneck of the third layer of \"Ghost Sword\" has disappeared after the realm has been upgraded. It seems that the choice to upgrade to the cultivation behavior before is correct!\"\\nHolding the ice glass sword in his hand, Ling Xiao looked happy.Ten days later, he broke \"Ghost Sword\" through the third layer. Although the fourth layer will not increase the number of shadow avatars, the attack of each shadow avatar will increase by 20%.In other words, from the original only 30% of Ling Xiao's body strength to 50% strength.Ling Xiao is currently in the early stage of Wumai Sixth Layer, and the actual combat power is probably not lost to the latter.His 50% strength is at least the level of the martial art triple warrior.You know, this level is much higher than many disciples of Lingjia Elite Hall.Of course, his realm improved, but for the time being, the template still chose the five peaks of Wumai.Of course, this is not to want to install. After all, the more cards, the greater the possibility of winning, hiding the true strength. This is also a card.When \"Double Shadow Sword\" entered the territory slowly again, Ling Xiao temporarily stopped and returned to the practice of \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body\".At present, his \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\" is the sixth turn.\\nIf you can practice to the seventh turn before the Tianfeng Festival, not only will the defense be greatly improved, but even a special effect will be produced.You should know that the seventh turn can be practiced to be a real gold body. When the \"Nine Turns Gold Body Technique\" is displayed, the body is yellow in cash, and a thin film-like thing is attached to the surface of the skin, which not only defends amazingly, but also rebounds the enemy's attack.Although the cold liquid in the world of mountains and rivers has run out of cold, the liquid gold has not been used up yet.With these gold liquids, it is enough to raise the \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Tips\" to the seventh turn.Especially after his self-cultivation has already broken through the sixfold of Wumai, it is obviously easier to practice \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body\", and some of the previous obstacles have almost completely disappeared.\"\"Jiu Zhuan Jin Shen Ju\" is a top-notch martial art. Once I reach the seventh turn, I can confidently defeat Ling Chen.\"Before he faced Ling Chen, he was still at a disadvantage.If Ling Wuhen didn't shoot that day, he would absolutely not be able to drive Ling Chen away, at most it would be undefeated, but he would definitely be embarrassed.Ling Wuhen can help him once, but it is impossible to help him all the time. If he wants to be face-saving and respectful, he must be strong enough!Almost at the same time, a strong breath rose from the back of the Ling family, and the entire Ling family felt it.\\n\"Wumai six-fold cultivation in the middle? And how can there be a special feeling of fear in this breath?\"Ling Xiao frowned slightly.He was very familiar with the breath, it should be Ling Chen.Ten days ago, Ling Chen was already at the beginning of the six peaks of Wumai, so it is normal to break through now.After all, after Ling Chen came back, he was cultivated by the Ling family in concert, and even the fourth floor of the bookstore let him in.But Ling Xiao was worried about the special breath of fear.Could it be that the breath brought by the fragments of extraordinary martial arts?\"Hahaha, grandson Ling Chen, your grandfather is shocking your grandfather. At the age of seventeen, he broke through the sixfold of Wumai and broke the record of Tianfeng City's dust seal for more than fifty years! Now it has once again broken through!\"Ling Xiaotian looked at Ling Chen and praised with satisfaction with his beard:\"It is even more surprising to Grandpa that you have already realized the two profound martial arts mysteries. If neither of them is Tianfeng City's first genius, who else?\"\\n\"If the grandfather of the patriarch and the elders of the Great Supremes worked together to help me clear the martial arts and temper my body, I would not be able to break through the six-middle stage of the martial arts so quickly, and it would be impossible to comprehend the second type of extraordinary martial arts mystery!\"Although Ling Chen was arrogant, he was not arrogant at all in the face of the four old men present.After all, the cultivation practices of these four old men are all above the seventh level of the Wumai.You know, the martial arts above the seventh level is the stage of gas explosion, and it is the real warrior!A warrior who is further than the warriorThe sixth and seventh layers seem to be separated by one layer, but in fact they are the gap between the sky and the chasm.Wu Sheng was promoted to martial, and one of the 100 people succeeded, it was lucky.The warrior was promoted to a martial artist, and one in 1,000 succeeded, even if it was very good.One is that there is no one in one, and the other is that there is no one in one. This gap is quite large.\"It's good to know humility, don't go to trouble Ling Xiao now, you should work together to win glory for my Ling family, you know?\"\\nLing Xiaotian said with a smile: \"My Ling clan has two of you~www.novelbuddy.com~ He Chou will not be able to stabilize the other three big families in the future, and He Chou cannot win the first prize at this Tianfeng Summit!\"\"Grandpa is assured that the Tianfeng event is just that I haven't participated in these years. Now that I am back, the first son of Tianfeng City will naturally belong to our Ling family.\"Ling Chen's words revealed strong self-confidence, and he did not take the rest of the Tianfeng City's warriors into consideration.\"Never mind you, the strongest person among the four families is the Qianjinshi Yulian in the city's main palace! This woman must not be underestimated!\"Ling Xiaotian frowned and reminded.\"Shi Yulian is nothing more than the five peaks of the Wumai Peak, why am I afraid? Grandpa, you are too worried. But Shi Yulian is hailed as the first beauty of Tianfeng City. The grandson may be able to marry her back as your granddaughter-in-law. .\"Ling Chen shook her head with a smile, but when she saw what Ling Xiaotian had to say, she continued: \"Of course, Grandpa, you can rest assured that there are still 20 days from now to the Tianfeng Festival, I will never relax and practice!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was true that they were able to defeat Ling Feifan, but the realm they showed was only in the late Wuzhong Wuzhong period.And these warriors who are staring at the position of the four sons are the five-peak peak martial arts martial arts. They naturally will not admit that they are weaker than Ling extraordinary.But they didn't know that Ling Xiao's mighty power had not been comparable for a long time.Even today's three sons, plus Ling Chen and Tian Yucheng's first beauty Shi Yulian, none of them are afraid that they are not Ling Xiao's opponents.Ling Family.In Ling Xiao's home exercise room.He was sitting cross-legged on the ground at this time, and there seemed to be a layer of gold-colored film all around him.Wuhun Doppelgang continued to attack from all angles, but Ling Xiao did not move from beginning to end.\\nEven so, every attack on Wuhun's avatar was completely flicked out by this gold-colored film and could not cause any harm.At the age of 14, Ling Xiao finally cultivated the superior top-level defense martial arts of \"Nine Turns to Golden Body Skills\" to the seventh turn.Unless the opponent's qi quality is stronger than him, or possesses any treasure, otherwise, not only can not break his defense, but will also be injured by rebound.The stronger the attack, the more serious the injury.Ling Xiao, who is only 14 years old, feels taller than his peers, and has a very well-balanced figure.It's not too burly, but it's not very thin, and every muscle of his looks just right.Not too bloated, not too little.The body that was condensed by Hantan Jinye, at this time, has become so powerful that the martial arts of the same realm have reached an unbelievable level.It is more than ten days ago to break through the seventh turn.Not to mention, just relying on the practice of Wumai Liuzhong and the seventh turn of \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body\", he was confident that he would get the title of four sons.\\nIt was just that he had never seen the other three sons and did not know their specific strength, so he did not dare to say that he was invincible.Therefore, after breaking through the \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body Skill\", he did not stop practicing, and turned to \"Ghost Shadow Sword\", \"Black Sword of the Sword Art\", \"Ning Soul Skill\", \"Snow Lotus Qi Skill\" And the mysterious method \"Earth Heart Ice Lotus Bond\" for the final sprint.To this day, his \"Condensation of Souls\" and \"Black Sword of Imperial Sword Art\" have almost entered into the realm, and they have truly achieved the point of fascination.Both natural swordsmanship and soul power have made great progress, and their use has become more diverse.\"Snow Lotus Qi Jue\" relying on a thousand-year-old golden snow lotus, directly broke through to the seventh floor and entered the state of Dacheng.\"Geocentric Ice Lotus Bound\" is also immersed in the light of this golden snow lotus, directly breaking through to the sixth peak state and entering the realm of mastery.This is much higher than Ling Yixue's state.Although \"Double Shadow Swordsmanship\" is still the third-level peak, it has not entered the realm, but this realm is much more stable and more skilled in use.In the process of practicing \"Double Shadow Sword Technique\", Ling Xiao vaguely discovered that if combined with the evil spirit of \"Bull Demon Skill\", the attack power of each shadow avatar will increase by about 10%.The higher the realm of Niu Mogong, the more power will increase.\\nThat is to say, when he breaks through to the fourth layer of \"Ghost Sword\", the fighting power of each shadow avatar is not his 50%, but 60% or more.This is just a bonus.According to his speculation, once the \"Double Shadow Sword\" practiced to the fifth level of the Great Consummation Realm, after being swallowed by the \"Bull Demon Skill \u00b7 Modification\", I am afraid that it will increase more.Taking advantage of this, Ling Xiao also increased the fighting power of Wushen Doppelganger.Compared with the shadow avatar, the Wuhun avatar has a longer duration and more abundant use of moves.After all, the shadow doppelganger is just a swordsmanship but Wuwu soul doppelganger exists independently. Except for the lack of self-soul, it is equivalent to the weakened version of Lingxiao.According to Ling Xiao's speculation, once \"Double Shadow Sword Technique\" is cultivated into the realm, I am afraid that its attack power is unstoppable under the extraordinary martial arts.Even the mystery of the extraordinary martial arts is incomparable.After all, the fragment is a fragment, not a real martial art. It just allows the warrior to get some attack or defense enhancement. It is not so magical.\"Next, it's time to raise your body of law.\"\\nAt this time, there are still ten days before the Tianfeng event, Ling Xiao intends to promote \"Xiang Yunbu Hua Jiao\".Judging from the current situation, his most powerful body style, but the hind legs, but only the entry-level top-level body style, this is definitely not possible, must be promoted!Fortunately, this is not a problem for him. He originally got six entry-level top martial arts from the bookstore. In addition to the three he is currently practicing, there are \"Colorful Xiayi\" that he uses to exchange with Ling Yixue. \"In addition to the two, the remaining two are body methods.Entry-level top-level practice!He intends to use the next time to fully integrate these two top-level body skills, and then serve as the basis for improving \"Xiang Yunbu\".There is no way, \"Xiang Yunbu\" to improve, can only be based on the rest of the body.In this way, eight days have passed.The door of the training room suddenly opened, and a golden dragon flew out of the training room. It was so fast that it was just a golden light, and it could not see anything else at all.This Golden Dragon looks relatively small. UU Reading www.uukanshu.com is only two or three meters long. It fell in the courtyard, but it was Ling Xiao.\"Hahaha, \"Xiangyunbu Young Dragon\"! It is equivalent to the rare top-level body technique, it seems that Kung Fu does not live up to people's hearts, and finally I have not spent it in these eight days.\"\\nLing Xiao laughed excitedly, \"Xiang Yunbu\" was finally promoted from \"Jiaojiao\" to \"Young Dragon\", which not only improved the speed and stagnation ability, but also cooperated with the rest of the attack martial arts, but also improved many attacks. The power of it.\"Brother, I'm not happy!\"Ling Xiao, who was excited, suddenly discovered that Ling Luo was squatting there, with an unhappy face.\"What happened to Ronaldinho?\"Ling Xiao asked suspiciously.Today's radish head is obviously much stronger than before, and it is also a warrior with double martial arts.\"Just now I heard from my brothers, there is no brother in the quota for the Tianfeng event this time!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 Take a placePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?Hearing Ling Luo's words, Ling Xiao felt strange, but he was the No. 1 disciple of Tiancai Tang, but he did not get the qualification to participate in the Tianfeng event. This is a bit abnormal.This is a rare opportunity for exchange and discussion. Ling Xiao has been struggling to find his opponent. This Tianfeng event is like preparing for him.He thought he would definitely be able to participate, so he kept paying attention to the time. Now he is told that he is not qualified?This is too ridiculous.\"Ling Luo, don't be angry first, tell your brother what's going on?\"Ling Xiao is not impulsive, he needs to make things clear.\"I don\u2019t know the specifics. I heard from my brothers that the three senior elders are not willing to let you fight, saying that you are lonely and weird, and you like to provoke wrongdoing and fear of causing trouble, so you disqualified you. .\"Ling Luo said vigorously: \"Although the patriarch still wants you to go, but he is not good for you to fight against the three elders too, so decided.\"\\n\"Who are qualified?\"Ling Xiao asked.\"Ling Chen, Ling Yun, Ling Yihang, Ling Feng!\"Ling Luo replied.\"Ling Chen and Ling Yihang are qualified, but that Ling Yun counts something. I saw it in the first battle that day. His strength is not even as good as that of Sister Yixue. Why should I participate? And that Ling Feng came out funny ?\"Ling Xiao was unhappy.\"That\u2019s right, after hearing about the Dabi, Ling Shuang, Ling Zhan, Ling Xiaopeng, Ling Dapeng and others have all closed their doors to practice. They can\u2019t participate in this Tianfeng event, and Ling Feifan went out to practice. Not to Ling Feng who didn't even make the finals.\"Ling Luo was even more upset.\"Wait.\"Ling Xiao suddenly motioned Ling Luo to stop talking and then looked at the door.Two people walked in outside the door, one was Ling Xiaotian and the other was Ling Wuhen.\\n\"Patriarch! Second Lord!\"Ling Xiao and Ling Luo bowed their hands to salute.\"You know everything about the Tianfeng event, this quota was set by the three elders and I, and it can't be changed now, but in order to make up for your loss, I specially brought an entry level today Top martial arts.\"Ling Xiaotian's attitude is not bad, but it is a pity that he does not understand what Ling Xiao needs at all.What Ling Xiao needs is to learn from masters, not the entry-level top martial arts.What is more needed is respect!\"Patriarch, please forgive your disciples for being rude. This entry-level top martial art, Ling Xiao does not need it, please take it back.\"Ling Xiao looked at Ling Xiaotian.Although he has a good opinion of Ling Xiaotian, but as the patriarch, he can't even do this little thing, which is really disappointing. Want to win over people's hearts?Compared with Ling Wuhen, Ling Xiao was naive.\"Father, one of the entry-level top martial arts wanted to confuse this matter, don't you think it's too much drama? Could this Ling family become the Ling family of three elders?\"\\nLing Wuhen is also angry.Of the three people he made, only Ling Yihang was finally qualified, but neither Ling Xiao nor Ling Yixue actually got this qualification.\"To shut up!\"Ling Xiaotian's face changed, and her attitude suddenly became tough. She said: \"The matter is here, no need to say anything, you don't need to talk about this top martial art, but this is a matter fixed by the family, even if you are not happy in your heart, you must accept it. .\"Speaking of which, he sighed a lot slower and sighed: \"Young people, I admire your character, but once you are easy to break, you still have to be smooth.\"Talking, he shook his head and turned away.Perhaps Ling Xiaotian's words made sense.But Ling Xiao is difficult to accept.This is obviously unfair, and he will never swallow it.Ling Yun and Ling Feng are going to participate in the Tianfeng event?Haha, it just happened to have a hatred against Ling XIII, it seems that I have to do something.\\nHe did not tell anyone about this plan, including Ling Erye and Ling Yixue.One day later, it was the day when the Tianfeng event was held.The Ling family suddenly changed the list to go to the competition, and the four people became Ling Chen, Ling Xiao, Ling Yixue and Ling Yihang.the reason is simple.Because last night, Ling Yun and Ling Feng were attacked in the clan, and they were injured and could not go to the competition.Ling Thirteen jumped like thunder, but could not find any clues.Although Ling Xiaotian suspected that Ling Xiao did it, he still didn't quite believe it. Ling Xiao could actually deceive Ling Xing and beat Ling Yun and Ling Feng seriously.According to eyewitness witnesses that night, the visitor injured Ling Yun and Ling Feng at the same time with a single stroke, and then left quickly.Can't see clearly, even the law of body.Is Ling Xiao so strong?Ling Xiaotian and the three Taishang elders expressed doubts.\\nThis matter has been revealed for the time being.Of course, Ling Xiao did this. He is not such a rigid person. Since you do not follow the rules, then I can only break the rules.On the day of the game, he went to the city's main palace with Ling Yixue, Ling Yihang, Ling Chen, and the ten talented disciples responsible for raiding, as well as the leading patriarchs Ling Xiaotian and Taishang elder Ling Yin.On the way, Ling Yixue deliberately fell to the end with Ling Xiao.\"Brother, did you do that?\"\"Sister Sister thought?\" Ling Xiao did not answer positively, but a slightly deep smile already represented everything.\"Thank you, I would not dare to do that.\" Ling Yixue didn't think Ling Xiao did anything wrong.Like Ling Xiao, she was a disciple who was recruited from outside. She originally vowed to be loyal to Ling's family.After all, they were very grateful to the Ling family at first.But as time went on, many things the Ling family did made them chill.Although it is said that he will not be an enemy of the Ling family, the old feelings of gratitude to Dade have long since disappeared.\\nFor them, the Ling family is just a place to learn martial arts, and there is no longer any kind of so-called affection.\"It's okay, it's their unruly first.\"Ling Xiao smiled, and she had reached the main palace in front.Tianfeng City\u2019s main palace covers a very large area, and this time the Tianfeng Festival was held in Houshan, the main city of the city.There are pavilions and pavilions in the mountains, and each of the four families occupies one pavilion. It is very thoughtful to prepare tea and snacks.The rest of the family can only be in the pavilion, and some even have no pavilion, and can only sit on the floor.This is the gap in treatment.Ling Xiao has been concentrating on cultivation, so she doesn't know much about the other three other than the Ling family, let alone masters.It's the Li family~www.novelbuddy.com~ He took a few more look.Li Xingyun, who was killed by him, is a member of the Li family.\"Ling Xiao, it seems that you are very interested in the Li family. That person is named Li Xinghui. He is ranked first among the four sons, and he is the most outstanding one, and he is also the brother of the killed Li Xingyun!\"\\nLing Yihang pointed at the pavilion of the Li family and said.\"Oh?\"\"It seems that you don't believe it, but I don't believe it either, but what I saw with my own eyes was the Li Xinghui at the Tianfeng event last year. It completely crushed and defeated the other three sons. Every shot was just a trick!\"Ling Yihang said that he was very serious, fearing that Ling Xiao would disparage the enemy.\"One move to defeat Ling Feifan? Really powerful!\"Although he said so in his mouth, Ling Xiao felt that there was no big deal. Looking at Li Xinghui's breath, he knew that this man was completely slanted and attacked, so he was good at attacking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 The event beginsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay?That Li Xinghui sword went off the wing and was good at attacking.If the enemy cannot be defeated in a short period of time, then he must be the one to lose.In all aspects of defense, gang qi, etc., this Li Xinghui is much lower than the people in the same realm, only attacking and ridiculously high.Fighting this kind of person must definitely avoid its edge, otherwise it is normal to lose one move.\"Your name is Li Xinghui, right?\"Suddenly, Ling Chen, not far from the side, looked at Li's pavilion with a smile.\"Exactly!\"\\nLi Xinghui felt like a sharp sword, and all spoke with a sense of coldness.\"I heard that you defeated the other three sons in one move last year, but that was because I was not here. This year's son duel will definitely let you know how powerful Ling Chen is!\"Li Xinghui glanced at Ling Chen lightly and shook his head gently: \"Although you are strong, but you are not qualified to beat me, it is him who makes me a little bit unclear.\"Li Xinghui's eyes suddenly turned to Ling Xiao.This person's vision is really poisonous. Although Ling Xiao used the template of Wumai Wuzhong Peak and did not expose any special breath, Li Xinghui still felt his good.This may be the intuition of the warrior.\"you!\"Ling Chen's face changed suddenly.He didn't expect Li Xinghui to despise him so much, but gave Ling Xiao so much affirmation.\"Hahahaha!\" There was a burst of laughter from the Li family.\\nAll felt that Ling Chen was insulting herself.\"Brother Chen, don't care too much, he is just psychological tactics, want to disturb your mind.\"Ling Tie's hand standing beside Ling Chen reminded.\"You don't need to remind you, don't I know this yet? Li Xinghui, you have enough species, but later, I will let you know the cost of despising me.\"Ling Chen gritted his teeth and practiced for four years in his foreign experience. When he came back, he thought that he could sweep the Tianfeng City. Who knew that he had eaten deflated in the family, and now he was despised by Li Xinghui. Strength.\"The person praised by Li Xinghui should be Ling Xiao? The person who defeated Ling Fanfan.\"Tianfeng City said that it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s basically impossible to hide a thing completely, especially since Lingjia\u2019s annual Dabi has passed for more than a month. If no one outside knows that Ling Xiao is the one who defeated Ling Feifan, That's funny.Therefore, Li Xinghui's remarks quickly caught everyone's attention.\"The five peaks of Wumai are indeed at a high level. It is possible to defeat Ling Feifan.\"\"You have to find him to practice hands later!\"\\nIn Tianfeng City, there are not many warriors in the five peaks of Wumai. Even the younger generation, there are dozens of them. None of these people is subdued.\"City Lord arrives!\"Suddenly, a loud voice came, making the scene that was originally chaotic suddenly silent.Not far away, the main owner of Tianfeng City, with his daughter Shi Yulian taking the steps, gradually appeared in everyone's field of vision.The sound of breathing at the scene suddenly became hurried.Almost everyone's eyes were on Shi Yulian, the hostess of Tianfeng City.Tianfeng City's first beauty!The first master outside the four sons.These names make Shi Yulian mysterious and desirable.No noise was heard, only the sound of many people swallowing saliva.\\nShi Yulian has a tall figure and a pink makeup, which makes her more charming and graceful.Her skin is very white, just like the best sheep fat white jade.Her smile hung on her face, revealing the maturity and temptation that did not match the age, as if the ripe peaches made people want to take a bite.But only sixteen years old, this woman has such a face, no wonder it will be hailed as the first beauty of Tianfeng City.But somehow, at the moment of seeing Shi Yulian, Ling Xiao thought of Ling Yu. The two women were of the same type.He frowned slightly, and suddenly lost interest in appreciating beauty.I hope this Shi Yulian is just like Ling Yu on the surface, don't look like it on the inside, otherwise it would be a pity.After all, he still appreciates women like Ling Yixue more.There is not much talk, but often the truth is revealed and not artificial.What's more, Ling Yixue's beauty is not inferior to that of Shi Yulian. To some extent, it is even better than that.\\nThe first beauty of Tianfeng City, I don\u2019t know which bored people selected, probably to shoot the fart of the owner of Tianfeng City.\"Cough, you guys, today the host of the city is holding the Tianfeng event here, just to discover our outstanding talents in Tianfeng City...\"The voice of the lord of Tianfeng City awakened many people who could not be extricated from the beauty of Shi Yulian.\"Ling Xiao, you must not underestimate Shi Yulian. Although she did not enter the quota of the four sons, but it is said that she had adventures this year and her strength has soared. She is not afraid of masters other than the four sons.\"Ling Yihang saw that Ling Xiao was quite disdainful of Shi Yulian, so she couldn't help reminding: \"And I guess she is afraid to become the only son-in-law this time.\"\"who's that person?\"Of course, Shi Yulian Ling Xiao knows how many pounds he has. He who possesses Wuhe Soul, all the young talents present cannot escape his eyes.So his attention was quickly attracted by another person in the castle's pavilion.\"That man is Shi Feiyu, the adopted son of Tianfeng City's lord. Last year the Tianfeng event ranked third, and his defense skills are amazing!\"\"Oh, that's the case, no wonder I always think he looks a bit like me.\"\\nLing Xiao smiled. In fact, the reason why he paid attention to Shi Feiyu was that he felt a very special breath on Shi Feiyu, not like a human race.\"Probably because you have all trained top-level defense martial arts.\"Ling Yihang smiled and continued: \"In Tianfeng City, the strongest is the city's main palace, which is the Shijia, followed by the Li family, then the Wang family, and finally the Ling family.\"\"Why do you say that?\"Ling Xiao asked puzzled.\"This ranking is based on the Tianfeng event. In the last two years, among the disciples of the Ling family, only Ling Feifan was the only one who could enter the top ten of the Tianfeng event. All the contestants entered the top ten, three of the Li family entered the top ten, and two of the Wang family, and even outside the ten, the Ling family's contestants were ranked at the end, not even some small families.\"Ling Yihang sighed: \"You probably heard about it~www.novelbuddy.com~ The Tianfeng event is related to the status, site and resources of each family in Tianfeng City. Our Ling family has suffered too much in recent years. Now.\"\"This session may be different.\"Ling Xiao smiled.\"Well, if Ling Feng comes to fight soy sauce according to the original quota, Ling Yun will not be able to enter the top ten. At most, Ling Chen and I will enter the top ten.\"\\nLing Yihang snorted coldly: \"Later changed the list, it looks pretty good, except for Yi Xue, our three big men should break into the top ten without a problem.\"\"You look down on Sister Yixue.\"Ling Xiao smiled and said: \"In this grand event, the Ling family will inevitably have four people in the top ten at the same time, and the ranking will not be low.\"\"You say that I believe, because your eyesight is better than mine.\"Ling Yihang nodded and said, \"Our Ling family will finally raise their eyebrows and exhale this time, otherwise they will not be able to lift their heads while walking on the street.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you continue to challenge the victory, then it will not be consumed.The rules are actually very simple and interesting.\"Let's go to the ring now!\"As the host of this event, the voice of the host of Tianfeng City just dropped, and suddenly dozens of figures flew out.\\nSome flew out of the pavilion.Some flew out of the pavilion.There are also rushed out of the forest.Obviously, there are many competitors, but those with lighter skills will naturally have a greater advantage.In just an instant, the ten rings are already occupied.Li Xinghui occupies the highest ring.Ling Chen followed.Shi Feiyu third.Wang Zui fourth.Shi Yulian fifth.Of the remaining five rings, four of them were divided by Li, Wang and Shijia, and only the tenth ranked ring was occupied by a middle-class disciple.What made Ling's family look dull is that apart from Ling Chen, Ling Xiao, Ling Yihang and Ling Yixue did not move.It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to move.\\nThe point is that they never heard of such rules from anyone, so they didn't move.This is a little slower, and it is too late to try again.\"Hahaha, the Ling family also deserves to say that it is ridiculous with the other three big families. It is actually ridiculous that one Ling Chen took the ring.\"\"Yes, are those three idiots?\"\"Isn't Ling Xiao saying that he defeated Ling Feifan? I think it was a conspiracy?\"The disciples of the Li, Shi, and Wang families did not like the Ling family at all. They naturally beat the water dog.In fact, strictly speaking, the four major families have no affection for either side, but the Ling family is too bad to be laughed at.\"I can't sit still!\"Ling Yihang stood up and said.\"Then go play, but don't lose, just take the fourth and fifth.\"Ling Xiao said with a smile.\"What you said is easy.\"Ling Yihang smiled bitterly, but he did not disappoint Ling Xiao. After going up, the first roll challenge was Wang Zui, who ranked fourth.\\nNormally speaking, it might be easier for him to challenge Shi Yulian, but he doesn't like playing with women.This Ling Yihang has such a bad temper.\"Wang Zui, dare to fight me!\"Ling Yihang carried his hands on his back and pinned his long knife to his waist.\"Although I disdain to deal with you, but I do not want to violate the rules, just fight!\"Wang sits on the ring most, and he has no intention of getting up.Ling Yihang sneered.But said nothing.He doesn't like lip service.\"Ling Yihang is also really brave enough to dare to challenge Wang Zui, one of the four sons.\"\"Anyway, there are three chances. If you lose, you should learn from each other. I'm not afraid of changing.\"\"But if you learn from people who are too different from your strength, there won't be any improvement at all?\"\"I think he is a pig with green onions on his nose, just pretending to be an elephant. He just feels that what we just said is not good. I want to have a long face, but I am afraid that I will have more opportunities to lose face.\"\\nEveryone in the audience was talking about it, and they were not optimistic about Ling Yihang, which made Wang Zui even more arrogant. He was not ready to get up and face the battle.\"I can easily defeat you when I sit here, so I don't need to stand up.\"Facing Ling Yihang, he said so.\"Ling Yihang challenges Wang Zui, start!\"As the main lord of Tianfeng City fell down, suddenly a bright knife light also fell to the ground almost simultaneously.Then I saw that Wang was lying on the ring like a dead dog, almost bleeding from Qiqiao, but he didn't die anyway.\"moron!\"Ling Yihang's suffocated fire finally vented, watching Wang was most lifted off the ring, which was cool.\"Which **** the four sons, is just a temporary lead, and it's really lifeless and stupid!\"After finishing his speech, Ling Yihang inserted the long knife directly into the ring and happily looked at the challenges of others.\"It seems that we are all wrong. The Ling family is the strongest. I am afraid it is not Ling Chen or Ling Xiao, but this Ling Yihang, this person is too strong, only that knife, I can feel the bitter knife meaning!\"\"That's right, I also felt it. I actually defeated Wang Zui by a knife, and there is no such strength. I am afraid that even Li Xinghui may not win him.\"This is how people behave, whoever performs better will win more respect and admiration.\\nLing Yihang struck the king the worst, and this strength is really terrible.The next challenge is a bit commonplace.No one challenges the top five platforms, but all challenge the six to ten platforms.It's just that the people occupying these few platforms are not irritating, so apart from the success of Ling Yihang's first challenge, none of the others actually succeeded.\"Brother, I will go up and try.\"Ling Yixue looked at Ling Xiao and said.\"Go, remember not to challenge Shi Yulian, that woman is much stronger than it seems, Shi Feiyu is a good opponent, you can choose him.\"Ling Xiao suggested.I don't know when, in Ling Yixue's mind, Ling Xiao's status is even higher than that of the Ling family's senior elders.She had doubts and would not ask those people, but asked Ling Xiao directly.\"Okay, I listen to you!\"Ling Yixue took the stage, and Chong Shi Feiyu gave a courtesy: \"Under Ling Yixue, hope to enlighten me!\"\"What's going on with the Ling family, when they come up, they challenge the four sons?\"\\n\"Maybe I really have that strength.\"\"Well, don't make an assertion first, just look at it.\"\"Look at those of you, I don't believe that Ling's family has a Ling Yihang, but can they produce a stronger one than Ling Yihang?\"Ling Yixue challenged Shi Feiyu and instantly pushed the Tianfeng event to a peak. Everyone was a little surprised.There are also some expectations.\"Ling Chen, you Ling family are indeed domineering.\" Li Xinghui glanced at Ling Chen.\"Don't tell me this, I don't know that **** woman.\" Ling Chen said coldly: \"However, with her strength, most of them are impossible to win. After all, the annual ratio is only ranked sixth, if others are closed. It\u2019s not her turn to practice.\"\"is it?\"Li Xinghui frowned~www.novelbuddy.com~ didn't say anything.Shi Feiyu still attaches great importance to Ling Yixue. After all, with Wang Zui's lessons in front of him, he didn't want to overturn the boat in the gutter, so he used the most defensive martial arts as soon as he came up.\"That's the entry-level top defensive martial arts \"Iron Manuscript\".\"\"Yes, last year's Tianfeng event, Shi Feiyu swept the rest of the enemies by relying on the iron clothes magic skill, and finally only lost to Li Xinghui and Wang Zui. At that time, his iron clothes magic skill had just finished, and I don't know what happened this year. \"\"At least it's time to enter the realm of mastery.\"\\n\"Isn't that even more desperate, top defensive martial arts, even if they are only entry-level, it is difficult to practice.\"In the voice of discussion, Shi Feiyu has launched an attack.During the performance of \"Iron Manuscript\", as if wearing an iron mantle, not only the defense is greatly enhanced, but even the attack is also enhanced.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Oh, it seems that your Ling family is not very united.\"Li Xinghui smiled faintly: \"But this way, this battle will be interesting.\"\"Huh, Ling Yixue is only the Wuzhong Wuzhong mid-term cultivation practice, but Shi Feiyu is the Wumai Wuzhong peak cultivation practice, the strength is so different, even if she also learned the entry-level top martial arts, it is not a defeat! \"Ling Chen sneered coldly.\"Oh, it's interesting, you actually don't support your own people.\"Li Xinghui looked at Ling Chen with interest, wondering if the Ling family was scattered, could they take advantage of the opportunity to do something.Only Ling Chen was secretly crying. The four people in the battle this time, the other three were a gang, but he was isolated. He didn\u2019t have any kind of affection for Ling Xiao, and even some were only angry, and naturally hated at the same time. Ling Yixue is on.The fighting continued.Ling Yixue and Shi Feiyu, who played colorful Xiayi, were inseparable.Although inferior in the realm, Ling Yixue did not know if he got the advice of the superior, and his combat skills were very clever, completely making up for the disadvantages in the realm.\"about there!\"\\nAfter about fifty moves, Ling Xiao suddenly smiled. No one knew Ling Yixue better than him, and the battle should be over.He had just landed, and suddenly a very strange scene appeared on the ring. Shi Feiyu was frozen all over his body and could not move.At this time, if Ling Yixue wanted to kill him, it was easy.\"Ling Yi Xuesheng!\"\"What happened just now, how did Ling Yixue win?\"\"I didn't see clearly. It is estimated that some secret method was used. Shi Feiyu didn't even have the resistance to resist.\"\"In any case, this time the Ling family can have a long face. Two consecutive people entered the top four, plus that Ling Chen, that is, three people. Is it possible that the Ling family will occupy the position of the four sons this time?\"\"It's not that simple. Not long after the summit started, Li Xinghui and Shi Yulian haven't shot yet, not to mention that the Li family, the Shi family and the Wang family also have masters.\"\"But now it seems that the Ling family should be Ling Yixue's strongest. Ling Yihang followed, Ling Chen didn't do it for the time being, but it is estimated to be ranked third, but that Ling Xiao is the weakest, not good for the Ling family's big It\u2019s just a blind eye.\"\"Yes, it's highly possible that a **** will be given the first name, and it will deliberately let others relax their vigilance.\"Hearing these words, Ling Xiaotian and the elder Ling Yin in the Lingjia Pavilion's complexion were not so good.This time the Tianfeng event, there was neither Ling Yixue nor Ling Xiao on the list. Now Ling Yixue has taken the third place, which makes them completely unexpected.\\nAnd if expected, Ling Xiao is more terrible than Ling Yixue.The disciples who did not choose to get such good results are simply hitting their old faces.\"What are you talking about? What is Ling Xiao's weight? I won't know if I try. Ling Xiao, if you are a man, come and challenge me!\"In seventh place is a disciple of the Li family, who was trained as a martial arts in the fifth period.Originally Ling Xiao was not interested in such a person.But when he thought of the tragic death of his brothers and relatives, he became very upset.Since you are looking for beating, I will fulfill you!He stood up, smiled at the Li family disciple, ranked seventh, and jumped into the ring.\"Don't you dare to challenge Ling Yihang, dare to challenge Ling Yixue, and dare not to challenge Ling Chen, but put the goal on me, could I really feel that I am bullying?\"Ling Xiao came here to learn from this time, but not to teach others about martial arts.So there is absolutely no interest in such people.He intends to cut the mess quickly and make a quick decision.\\n\"How is it?\" The Li family disciple did not care, just to see you soft persimmons to pinch you.\"Okay, then you can go on.\"Ling Xiao waved her hand gently.Then a stunned scene appeared.In the later period of Wumai Wuzhong, the Li family disciple, ranked seventh in the ring, was actually patted and flew out like a piece of paper.There was no response at all.Don't say a trick.Ling Xiao didn't do anything at all, just waved it casually.\"How could it be so strong!\"The audience finally shocked.\"This Lingxiao, I'm afraid it's not as bad as we thought.\"\"Think about it too. The annual family of the Ling family is not a joke. If he can beat Ling Feifan, he will definitely not be too weak.\"\\n\"I don't believe this evil, dare you dare to accept my challenge?\"Another Li disciple jumped up.\"Are you stronger than the one just now?\"Ling Xiao asked lightly.\"almost.\"\"Since it's almost the same, go up and do it!\"When the words fell, he waved his hand gently, and the man was thrown down as soon as he jumped into the ring.Twice in a row, the two martial arts fighters in the late fifth stage were directly dropped into the ring, and it seemed completely cloudless and breezy, without any effort.So no one can still see his superiority.\"Shi Yue, you are going to challenge Ling Xiao!\"Shi Yulian, sitting on the fifth ring, suddenly looked at a teenager in his pavilion and said ~www.novelbuddy.com~ sister, let me deal with him? It's a big deal, right? \"The young man's words were shocked.\\nEveryone has just seen the ability of Ling Xiao. This Shi Yue must not be a blind man. He dare to say so, which is enough to show that his strength is much stronger than that of the two.\"obedient!\"Shi Yulian's voice seemed to be magical, and anyone who listened to it would feel very comfortable.Ling Xiao is no exception, but he only enjoys this sound, but he will not be distracted by it.\"I know my sister.\"Shi Yue jumped on the ring, looked at Ling Xiao and said: \"Ling Xiao, don't blame me for being unpleasant. My shot must be to see the blood, I hope you can go on your own.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was similar to her age, and there was nothing special about it. What made him so confident?\"Yes, I said that once I shoot, I will definitely see the blood, you will be seriously injured if you do it properly.\"Shi Yue nodded seriously.Looking at this person doesn't seem to scare people.Ling Xiao became somewhat interested in him.\"Attack me with your strongest moves. If you can move me from where you are, you will win.\"He smiled and smiled.\"Sister, is this a fool, he can't understand me.\" Shi Yue looked at Shi Yulian and smiled bitterly.\"Shut up, this person's strength is not bad, you may not be able to win, or be careful.\" Shi Yulian snapped.\\n\"Sister, don't joke, once my strongest move comes out, even you can hurt, dare you say that you can't step back?\"Shi Yue smiled bitterly: \"I really don't want to hurt anyone.\"\"This child is really cute and honest, rest assured, I have trained top defensive martial arts, even if you are injured, it will not be seriously injured.\"Ling Xiao was originally uncomfortable with Shi Yue's big words, but after listening to his conversation with Shi Yulian, the discomfort disappeared in an instant. Dare to feel that the child really didn't look down on him, but a pure honest man.And also very kind.\"Well, you prepare, I'm going to move!\"Shi Yue finally took a deep breath after hearing Ling Xiao's words, and her original eyes became sharp as a knife instantly.The gang qi that had been suppressed also burst out.\"Good momentum, although the state is the five peaks of Wumai, but the quality of gangqi has at least reached the level of Wumai sixfold, no wonder so confident.\"\"Ling Xiao is going to be beaten.\"\"I blamed him for being too loud, did not listen to people Shi Yue said, all efforts, even Miss Yulian will be injured.\"\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Hey, Ling family's momentum is too hard, and finally one is going to lose.\"The following people had a lot of discussion, but the two above the ring did not listen.Ling Xiao carried his hands on his back, and the blue robe automatically moved without wind, with a faint smile on his face, and he could not see the tension at all.Shi Yue clenched her fists, but hadn't attacked yet. The roaring roar of sound had made many people around him unbearable.Boom!Suddenly a burst of sound sounded, and Shi Yue's fists exploded, as if the mountains and the sea were falling, the air was deformed.No, it's not the air deformation, it's just that some distortion has occurred in the space. Looking through the qi of his double fists, the surrounding figures are all distorted.\"Jiao Tao Quan!\"Like the roar of the sea, waves of waves rushed to Lingxiao.Ling Xiao finally saw that what was the most terrible part of this trick.It seems to be just an attack, but it contains six levels of dark energy, as if it were seven waves, one after another, and one is stronger than one.\"Come well!\"\\nLing Xiao's eyes lit up.No wonder that Shi Yue is so confident, if such a fist, if the opponent is not him, but someone else, it is really terrible.But the \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Technique\" has a natural restraint effect on this kind of multi-darkness boxing.It's a pity that Shi Yue's strong punch is afraid of tragedy.\"This Shi Yue's attack power, I am afraid that even if compared with Li Xinghui, it will not be much worse.\"\"Yeah, although he relied on multiple dark energy, Li Xinghui was a strong blow, but it should be similar in power.\"\"Ling Xiao can't stop it.\"\"Yeah, unless he cultivates top defensive martial arts to Dacheng Realm.\"The sound of the discussion just fell, and suddenly there was a cry of exclamation on the ring over there, and then a figure flew directly from the ring.\"Is it Lingxiao?\"\"No! It's Shi Yue! What the **** happened, damn, I missed a wonderful scene while chatting.\"\\n\u3000\u3000 \"\"Nine turn golden body tactics\"! Dacheng realm!\"Someone told him the answer.\"What! The top-ranking defensive martial art known as the most difficult to practice \"Nine Turns Golden Body Tips!\"\"Everyone looked at the ring, Ling Xiao stood there with golden light, just like a battle against the Buddha.He said that he would not retreat, and he would not retreat.Instead, Shi Yue was shocked and vomited blood, and it looked like he was very hurt.\"Sister, he is so powerful, even better than that Li Xinghui!\"thought Shi Yue was not hurt badly, but did not expect the silly boy to stand up and wipe his mouth, and said something that made Li Xinghui frown slightly.\"Don't talk nonsense, hurry up and heal.\"Shi Yulian frowned and said that she, as the main mansion of the city, naturally understood the way of enveloping people's hearts, so she was really unwilling to offend Li Xinghui and the Li family because of this matter.\"Your name is Shi Yue, right? Your Jing Tao fist is very powerful, and the gang qi is also very pure, but I suggest you practice the internal strength of the water system, this punch will be stronger.\"Ling Xiao smiled and said to Shi Yue: \"You are not weak, but it's a pity that you met me. If you hadn't practiced in \"Nine Turns to Gold Body Skills\" to the seventh turn, you wouldn't be able to stop your blow today.\"\\n\"Ling Xiao, you don't have to praise me, you are really strong, I will serve you.\"Shi Yue spit out another blood while talking, which was pulled by the Shi family to heal.Ling Xiao seldom appreciates people, and there are not many people who can let him instruct. Ling family only has Ling Yixue and Ling Yihang, plus a Ling Luo, and this Shi Yue is one of them.Ling Xiao defeated Shi Yue, but it was regarded as the first show, and the previous contempt and neglect of him were all gone.Especially, the top martial art \"Nine Turns to the Golden Body\" practiced to the seventh turn, which has never been heard in Tianfeng City or even the younger generation of the Northern Han Dynasty.His strength, no one has doubted so far.\"Although I admit Ling Xiao's strength, he should still be the last of the four Ling family. After all, if it is only a strong defense, it is easy to be targeted.\"\"Same thing, I don't know who will challenge him next.\"\"Ling Xiao, you really deserve to be challenged by me.\"is the speaker who is Wang Zui, one of the four sons who ranked fourth.After a period of rest and treatment, he has recovered almost. UU reading www.uukanshu.com\\n\u3000\u3000 \"Shouldn't you challenge Ling Yihang?\"Ling Xiao asked suspiciously.\"Less nonsense, don't you dare to fight?\"Wang certainly wanted to challenge Ling Yihang, but he really had to be frightened by Ling Yihang's knife, and he had no confidence at all to challenge Ling Yihang.The reason why \u3000\u3000 challenged Ling Xiao was that Ling Xiao was weaker than Ling Yihang, and his defensive opponent would be more comfortable with it.He is best at poison.Even if the defensive martial arts are stronger, it is useless in front of his poison, which is why he chose Ling Xiao to challenge.Although Ling Xiao is only on the seventh ring now, it doesn\u2019t matter. Everyone on the scene can see that Ling Xiao is very strong, afraid that it will not be weaker than Shi Yulian, so as long as he defeats Ling Xiao, he should be able to save a little face. .Ling Yihang over there looked at Wang Zui, but secretly sympathized with this guy.Idiot chooses who is not good, actually choose Ling Xiao, this is not just looking for abuse.How terrifying Ling Xiao is. Ling Yihang knows best. No one has ever felt like Ling Xiao who can't catch up.feels unfathomable.\\n\"Since you want to challenge then come, I really want to see how much stronger you are than Ling Feifan.\"Ling Xiao said lightly.:. :Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
