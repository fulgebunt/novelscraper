Blood. Bright red blood was splashed among the white snow. Behind the splash of blood stood a gorgeous woman, holding a swift sword in her hand. She stared coldly at the enemies that she slaughtered. No emotion could be sensed from her pale and calm eyes.The woman was in a long and thin-layered dress in winter. Her pure white dress had been dyed a crimson color by the endless blood.Beside her feet, nearly a hundred corpses stacked on top of the white snow. The blood that flew out of the corpses had also dyed the snow around her red.However\u2026This was not the end yet.The woman raised her eyes slightly. On her pale but beautiful face, a pair of deep eyes took a glimpse towards the ten thousand people gathered in a circle hundreds of miles away, with everyone there staring at her in a greedy way.Scanning through the faces one by one, the woman suddenly raised her lips to an angle, displaying her evilness. She raised her hand and used one of the fingers to wipe off a drop of warm blood sliding down the corner of her lips. The pale lips were covered by a trace of redness, bright but sinister.79 people\u2026 who would be the next one?Ye Qingtang had never thought that one day she would become the enemy of the rest of the world and be attacked by ten thousand people on the Lingyun Cliff!All these could be credited to the Heart of the Demon God located in her chest!With anomalies in the sky, the Demon God was born. His birth signaled the end of the sky and the death of the earth.Ye Qingtang was not the Demon God. She had no idea why the heart which belonged to the Demon God would appear in her body.However, all of these did not matter anymore.The people in front of her all came for the Heart of the Demon God, which would grant them the unimaginable power, one that seemed able to reverse the sky!No one cared whether Ye Qingtang would be alive or dead.In the eyes of these people, she was just the container of the Heart of the Demon God.How ridiculous this was!Ye Qingtang straightened her body slightly. Her bare feet stepped on top of the soft snow, allowing the blood in the snow to soak her feet. She tilted her head and raised her sword all of a sudden. The tip of the sword, with a drop of blood, was pointed towards a well-dressed woman standing at the center of the crowd.\u201cYe You. Don\u2019t bother to send these useless people up anymore! If you want the Heart of the Demon God, you have to take it by yourself!\u201d Ye Qingtang was laughing, but deep in her eyes, there were not any traces of a smile.Back then, Ye You was also the genius girl of the Ye Family. Just because Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root was of the best quality which was extremely rare, Ye You ripped apart Qingtang\u2019s stomach with her own hands to dig out the Spirit Root for her own use.It had been 300 years since that day.Ye You took Qingtang\u2019s spirit root and stole the life that once belonged to Qingtang. She thus became the well-known genius. Now, she had already become the Great Empress Paragon. However, Ye Qingtang faced countless obstacles and nearly died many times in her life without her spirit root. It took her immense effort to reach the Paragon level. However, she was trapped on top of the Lingyun Mountain by Ye You for the Heart of the Demon God.Ye You frowned as her name was called by Ye Qingtang. Her eyes were full of disdain. To her, Ye Qingtang was just an ant struggling for survival, one who did not even qualify for Ye You to kill using her own hands.\u201cDon\u2019t let her escape! You must dig out the Heart of the Demon God entirely for me.\u201d Ye You commanded to the bodyguard beside her.Everyone surrounding the Lingyun Cliff immediately crowded around Ye Qingtang.A besiege by ten thousand people marked the absolute failure of Ye Qingtang even if she had some superpowers.Behind her was the cliff that one could not even see the end of it. In front of her was the besiege by ten thousand people. However, Ye Qingtang\u2019s face showed no trace of fear or awe.For this life of her\u2019s, her father and second uncle were murdered. Senior Brother Yun sacrificed himself to save her. Her master\u2019s life was shortened just to protect her\u2026Ye Qingtang closed her eyes slowly. Looking back through her life, she recalled countless regrets.People who loved her had already passed away. Now with her enemy in front of her, she would not allow Ye You to get what she wanted, even if Ye Qingtang had to destroy the Heart of the Demon God herself.The moment everyone dashed towards Ye Qingtang, she raised her hand suddenly and stabbed her own chest using her arched fingers. She crushed the Heart of the Demon God abruptly, the heart that everyone was longing for.Boom!The instant Ye Qingtang crushed the heart, a loud explosion sounded from the Lingyun Cliff!The Heart of the Demon God was destroyed. Streaks of aura were rushing between the sky and the earth. Lingyun Cliff was surrounded by storm wind. The earth trembled and the mountains swayed. At the same time, huge cracks suddenly appeared on the enormous cliff.Ye You and her fellow people did not bother with anything besides escaping from the path where they came from hurriedly.When the wind howled, the earth trembled and the mountains swayed. Ye Qingtang, lying in a pool of blood, fell into the endless chasm along with a huge cracked stone.However\u2026At that instant, a golden light suddenly came from the sky and dashed towards the falling Ye Qingtang.Time seemed to stop in that second.The huge falling stone was suspended in the mid air, and a shadow landed on that huge stone.It was a man with astonishing beauty. The white clothes he wore were swinging in the storm wind. He just stood beside the body of Ye Qingtang quietly, staring at the wound on her chest that was ripped apart by herself. He could feel a trace of a familiar aura, disappearing gradually from the wound.\u201cFound it.\u201dHis pleasant and deep voice was covered by the wind. The man slowly squatted down and touched the bloody wound gently using his long and elegant fingers. Wisps of aura were emerging continuously from Ye Qingtang\u2019s wound and slowly into the man\u2019s palm, forming a translucent heart.Just as the heart was about to condense into a solid form, the aura suddenly dispersed. The translucent heart dispersed into particles, scattered around the body of Ye Qingtang, and disappeared.A trace of blackish green sparkled in the man\u2019s deep eyes.\u201cI see\u2026\u201dThe man\u2019s finger pointed at the area between Ye Qingtang\u2019s brows the next moment.

Some kind of unbearable pain seemed to engulf her. She opened her eyes suddenly, but she was no longer at the snow-covered peaks of Lingyun Mountain.\u201cTang Tang, you\u2019re finally awake.\u201d Ye Qingtang heard a tiring voice beside her ears.Ye Qingtang was shocked when she heard the voice.This voice\u2026How many years had it been since she last heard this voice?Ye Qingtang instinctively shifted her sight to see a middle-aged man with a haggard face standing beside her.\u201cFather\u2026\u201d Ye Qingtang opened her eyes wide, unable to believe what she had witnessed. The middle-aged man helped her as she struggled to get up.Ye Ling, master of the Ye family clan, stared at his daughter and said worriedly, \u201cTang Tang, your body hasn\u2019t recovered since your spirit root was broken. You need to rest more. Don\u2019t rush to get up.\u201dYe Qingtang\u2019s eyes opened wider. She was extremely astonished by the situation in front of her.What happened?I destroyed my own heart on the peaks of Lingyun Mountain. Why am I alive?Father\u2026 I thought father was killed by the Great Elder three hundred years ago? Now\u2026 How\u2026A series of questions arose in Ye Qingtang\u2019s brain continuously. Only after taking a glance at her surroundings, she realized that she was in her own room of the Ye family, a room that ceased to exist a few hundred years ago.\u201cTang Tang, as your father, I will still take care of you in future even if you have lost your spirit root. You don\u2019t need to care about what others say. Just rest well and recover soon.\u201d Ye Ling did not give much thought to the abnormal behavior of Ye Qingtang. He thought that Ye Qingtang was just too shocked to pay attention to him.Only Ye Qingtang knew how shocked she was internally in that moment.She had revived and returned back to the Ye family three hundred years ago!Looking at her father in front of her, Ye Qingtang\u2019s eyes were filled with tears. Three hundred years ago, in her previous life, she was weak and useless. She could only helplessly witness her father and her beloved Second Elder being killed by Ye You\u2019s grandfather, the Great Elder of the Ye family. However, she could not believe that she was back now!Ye Qingtang sat up slightly, staring at her father whose face was full of concern. She tried to calm herself down.At the same period of time in her previous life, her spirit root had just been snatched by Ye You. On top of that, the Great Elder threatened that her father would be in danger if she ever told him the truth. As a result, she could only cover up the truth by saying that she broke her spirit root by herself.In her previous life, Ye Qingtang thought that she would be able to ensure her father\u2019s safety as long as she could tolerate the humiliation. However, she did not know that the Great Elder had already taken most of the power of the Ye family and had secretly laced her father\u2019s meals with chronic poison. The Great Elder not only encouraged Ye You to snatch Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root but also killed Ye Ling to take over the official master position of the Ye family.She could only blame herself for being too naive in her previous life.\u201cTang Tang, since you are up, drink the medicine before it gets cold.\u201d Ye Ling did not notice the changes in her daughter at all. Instead, he caringly offered her the medicine that was still warm.Ye Qingtang took the medicine her father handed over to her. Staring at the reflection of herself in the medicine, she went blank for a second.The girl in the reflection had delicate features, but there was a red palm-sized birthmark on her face which used to be white and clean. The birthmark which stretched across half of her face totally ruined her original beauty, even making her appear extremely ugly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She could only wear a veil all day long to cover the ugly face. However, after a long time, she realized that she was not born with the birthmark, but it was instead the result of someone purposely sealing her original appearance.Thinking about such, Ye Qingtang could not help but smile. She drank her medicine in one gulp. As the bitterness entered her throat, she swore secretly that since she was given a chance to be reborn, she must cut off all the regrets of her previous life.She would never let anyone hurt her father or anyone around her!Ye Ling sighed softly as he watched Ye Qingtang finish her medicine. The Ye family now was very unstable. Ever since the Second Elder, who always supported him, went into seclusion, the ambitious Great Elder took the chance to take over the entire Ye Family. Ever though Ye Ling was still the master of the Ye family, he had already lost all of his power.However, he felt relieved as long as Tang Tang was safe and sound.\u201cYou should rest more after drinking the medicine.\u201d Ye Ling\u2019s eyes were full of concern. Ever since his wife passed away, he treasured his precious daughter even more and focused mainly on taking care of her.Ye Qingtang nodded. All her suffering from the three hundred years in her previous life were incomparable to the care from her loved ones. She felt extremely lucky to be able to meet Ye Ling again.When Ye Ling was about to leave Ye Qingtang\u2019s room, a servant\u2019s voice was heard outside the door.\u201cMaster, the second junior master of the Duan family, Duan Tianrao, is here to visit the Young Lady. He\u2019s at the front hall now.\u201dYe Ling smiled in relief after hearing the servant\u2019s words. He then turned his head and looked towards Ye Qingtang who sat on her bed.\u201cTang Tang, Tian Rao cares for you. You see, he came to visit you this early, as he knew you weren\u2019t feeling well. I feel relieved to let him take care of you in the future,\u201d Ye Ling said.Duan Tianrao was the second junior master of the Duan family in Lin Town. He was also the fianc\u00e9 of Ye Qingtang. The two of them were engaged when they were young. Duan Tianrao was waiting for Ye Qintang to turn 16 when he would then marry Ye Qingtang.As for this son-in-law, Ye Ling was quite satisfied with him. He was delighted that Duan Tianrao came to visit Ye Qingtang this early.Unfortunately\u2026Ye Qingtang\u2019s face showed no trace of shyness a normal girl would have. There was only sarcasm in her big and clear eyes.Duan Tianrao.How could she forget about him?Not long after the news of her broken spirit root was spread out in her previous life, Duan Tianrao rushed over to the Ye family. However, her fianc\u00e9 was not there to comfort her and instead just tried to make things worse.Ye Qingtang closed her eyes slowly. The images of Duan Tianrao when he arrived at the Ye family in her previous life appeared in her brain.Ye Qingtang wore the veil all day long. There were rumors spreading in Lin Town in her previous life that she was extremely ugly. This was the reason why Ye Qingtang was too afraid to step out of the Ye family. Even when she stayed within the Ye family, she wore the veil all the time.Even her long-engaged fianc\u00e9, Duan Tianrao, had not seen her face under the veil before.Ye Qingtang used to think that Duan Tianrao treated her sincerely. However, after her spirit root was broken, Duan Tianrao came not to comfort her but instead to annul the engagement, choosing another woman over her.\u201cTang Tang?\u201d Ye Ling was concerned as he saw that Ye Qingtang\u2019s expressions were odd.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She felt the care and warmth from Ye Ling\u2019s worried gaze.Yes, she thought.Why did she need to bother with those bastards? She should only protect those people who cared for her in this life.\u201cFather, I\u2019ll dress up soon. You can go over first.\u201d Ye Qingtang smiled slightly.\u2026A tall and handsome man was sitting on the chair in the hall of the Ye family. Beside him was a beautiful and graceful girl.\u201cDuan Lang, about the matters we\u2019re going to discuss today\u2026\u201d The girl frowned slightly. She puckered her lips expressing her concern.After seeing such a lovely expression on the girl\u2019s face, Duan Tianrao who was sitting there could not help but raise his hand to cover her white hands.\u201cXun Er, you don\u2019t need to worry. I\u2019ll be here for you.\u201d Duan Tianrao\u2019s voice was very gentle when comforting the girl.Ye Xun was an orphan adopted by Ye Ling at a very young age. She had been raised by the Ye family ever since she was a baby. 16 years had passed, and though she was an adopted daughter, she still received the same education as the rest of the Ye family\u2019s daughters growing up. Her appearance was not inferior to those of the other daughters of the Ye family.Ye Xun\u2019s beauty was the reason why she was able to capture Duan Tianrao\u2019s attention.Ye Xun lowered her eyes filled with sadness and anxiety.\u201cI owe the Ye family a debt of gratitude for raising me up. I\u2019m scared that this matter might\u2026\u201dDuan Tianrao was heartbroken seeing how anxious Ye Xun was.He held her hand tightly and said, \u201cXun Er, you\u2019re the adopted daughter of the Ye family, and it\u2019s true that you owe them the debt of gratitude. However, our matter has nothing to do with that gratitude. Just rest assured. I\u2019ll be there for you no matter what happens.\u201dYe Xun nodded her head. A faint smile could be captured in her eyes as she noticed how much Duan Tianrao cared for her.At that moment, Ye Ling walked into the hall. Ye Xun and Duan Tianrao immediately let go of each other\u2019s hands. Duan Tianrao stood up and greeted Ye Ling.\u201cUncle Ye.\u201d\u201cFather.\u201d Ye Xun also stood up.Ye Ling just nodded slightly and looked towards Duan Tianrao in front of him.Ye Qingtang was the only daughter of Ye Ling. She had a weak body since she was born. She was even ashamed of herself due to her birthmark. Thus, it had always been Ye Ling\u2019s greatest aspiration to find a husband who would take care of his daughter.Lin Town had, in total, three large family clans. Apart from the Ye family, the Duan family and the Si family were the other two large family clans. The marriage alliance with the Duan family was based on equal social status, and Ye Ling would be relieved to hand over Ye Qingtang to Duan Tianrao as Tianrao cared for Qingtang all the time.\u201cTianrao, Tang Tang is still dressing up. She\u2019ll come over soon. Just wait for a while.\u201d Ye Ling smiled.A trace of uneasiness appeared in Duan Tianrao\u2019s eyes, but he did not show anything on his face. He exchanged glances with Ye Xun beside him secretly.\u201cNo need to rush,\u201d he said and smiled.He then nodded towards the servant beside him. The servant immediately placed a few well-decorated boxes onto a table beside Ye Ling.\u201cI heard that Tang Tang\u2019s spirit root was broken, devitalizing her. Thus, I prepared some tonics including the Hunyuan Pills which will help Tang Tang to regain her vigor. The pills are very effective in terms of healing power.\u201d Duan Tianrao spoke gently.\u201cThe Hunyuan Pills are difficult to find. I was about to look for them, but you have already brought them over. I\u2019m very relieved to see that you truly love her.\u201d Ye Ling felt pleased.\u201cThis is to be expected from a fianc\u00e9,\u201d Duan Tianrao said humbly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, remembering what Duan Tianrao said, all her worries were gone, and she smiled gently.\u201cHow\u2019s Tang Tang these past few days?\u201d Duan Tianrao\u2019s eyes flickered. It seemed that he was waiting for the right opportunity to open up.Ye Ling did not sense anything. He sighed and said, \u201cHow could she feel alright after her spirit root was broken? The child is always very considerate. She never shows any signs of pain in front of me. It\u2019s very heartbreaking to see her in this state.\u201dYe Ling raised his eyes and said to Duan Tianrao, \u201cTianrao, you\u2019re Tang Tang\u2019s fianc\u00e9, and the two of you grew up together. It\u2019d be great if you could spend more time with her. I\u2019m sure she would be more relaxed.\u201dDuan Tianrao smiled but did not respond directly.Ye Xun who was standing at the side lowered her head slightly. She pulled Duan Tianrao\u2019s sleeve discreetly, and in response Duan Tianrao gently patted her hand to comfort her.At the same moment, a skinny silhouette slowly entered the hall and greeted Ye Ling who sat on the main chair.\u201cFather.\u201dSeeing Ye Qingtang, Ye Ling\u2019s eyes reflected deep love and care.\u201cTang Tang, you haven\u2019t recovered fully yet. Sit down first.\u201dYe Qingtang, who was wearing the veil, sat beside Ye Ling quietly. However, her eyes did not even look towards the direction of Duan Tianrao, who sat below.Ye Ling did not notice how indifferent Ye Qingtang was towards Duan Tianrao. He smiled and pointed towards the things on the table to show Ye Qingtang.\u201cTang Tang, all these are given by Tianrao to help you recover. He even brought Hunyuan Pills for you. He truly does care for you.\u201dYe Qingtang\u2019s took a glimpse towards the tonics stacked on top of each other like a mountain on the table. She then glanced at Duan Tianrao who sat below. Her sight was extremely cold without any expression of fascination or gratitude.\u201cThank you, Young Master Duan, for your effort.\u201d Ye Qingtang spoke lightly.Young Master Duan?The other three all froze for a second. In the past when Ye Qingtang met Duan Tianrao, she always called him Brother Duan. Why did she distant herself today?Duan Tianrao frowned slightly. However, remembering the purpose of his visit today, he did not bother anymore.Ye Ling thought that Ye Qingtang was in a bad mood as her spirit root was broken, so he also did not bother to find out the reason.\u201cYou\u2019ll be 16 years old in half a year\u2019s time. I think we can proceed with your marriage with Tianrao. When you feel better, I\u2019ll discuss your marriage with the master of the Duan family clan. Is that fine?\u201dYe Ling did not initially intend to have Ye Qingtang marry so soon, but now that her spirit root was broken, it was very unlikely for her to have any improvement in Wushu. The Ye family had already been controlled by the Great Elder, and even as the master of the family clan, he no longer held much power.It would be better for Ye Qingtang to marry Duan Tianrao early. He would be more relieved knowing that Duan Tianrao would be able to take care of her.The faces of the three people who were present suddenly changed upon hearing what Ye Ling said.Especially for Ye Xun, her body stiffened, and Duan Tianrao\u2019s facial expression darkened.Only Ye Qingtang still sat properly on the chair. Her sight was cold, and she was sharp enough to capture the changes in Ye Xun and Duan Tianrao.\u201cUncle Ye.\u201d Duan Tianrao stepped forward suddenly.\u201cToday, I came over to tell you about something.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What is it?\u201d Ye Ling asked.Duan Tianrao remained silent for a while and said, \u201cBesides visiting Tang Tang, I came here today for another reason. It\u2019s because\u2026 I think the marriage between Tang Tang and I should be annulled.\u201dThe smile on Ye Ling\u2019s face disappeared immediately after Duan Tianrao finished his sentence.\u201cTianrao, what do you mean by that?\u201dDuan Tianrao took a breath and decided to confess everything.\u201cI grew up together with Tang Tang so, of course, we are close with each other. However, I can only view her as my sister and not as a couple. I have told my father about it, and he also agrees that we should not push for such a marriage. Hence, I\u2019m here today to annul the engagement,\u201d Duan Tianrao said.\u201cWHAT!\u201d Ye Ling slammed his fist loudly on the table. He stared at Duan Tianrao in anger.\u201cYou want to annul the engagement? Do you know what you are talking about!\u201dYe Ling was furious. The engagement between Duan Tianrao and Ye Qingtang was made when they were young, and everyone in Lin Town knew about that. Now, Duan Tianrao wanted to annul the engagement. If the news spreads out, his daughter would be viewed as a joke in other people\u2019s eyes!Duan Tianrao had already made up his mind.He stared at Ye Ling who was raging and carried on. \u201cUncle Ye, a few days ago, my father had confirmed that I would be the heir of the Duan family clan. I will become the master of the clan, and my wife will be the mistress of the Duan family.\u201dDuan Tianrao looked towards Ye Qingtang and her veil. His sight showed a sense of aversion.\u201cTang Tang never shows her real face to others. Furthermore, her spirit root was broken and she can\u2019t improve her Wushu anymore. Duan family is one of the three great family clans in Lin Town. The mistress must be able to take on heavy responsibilities. The Tang Tang now\u2026 I fear, is not suitable for this role anymore.\u201dDuan Tianrao sounded very pleasant and logical, but every word he said to Ye Ling pierced his heart like a sword.\u201cDuan Tianrao, do you know what you just said! Your engagement with Tang Tang was confirmed long ago. Now you want to annul it?\u201d Ye Ling reproached.Duan Tianrao frowned and raised his eyes slightly.\u201cUncle Ye, I did have an engagement with Ye Qingtang. However, what kind of spirit root did she have back then, and what kind is it now? Uncle Ye, you really want me to marry a woman who has no spirit root and no appearance?\u201dYe Ling trembled with anger. He never expected that Duan Tianrao was this kind of person.Duan Tianrao did not change his mind at all even after witnessing Ye Ling\u2019s anger. He turned and looked towards Ye Qingtang, who remained silent all along.\u201cTang Tang, I think I treated you fairly enough in the past. Now, you should think from my perspective. Even though others in the town said you were extremely ugly, I didn\u2019t request to annul the engagement back then. However, now that your spirit root is broken, do you still want to marry me forcefully? How am I supposed to explain this to the Duan family?\u201cI can tolerate it if my wife is ugly, but I can\u2019t bring a useless mistress for the Duan family.\u201dEvery word that came out of Duan Tianrao hurt. From the beginning to the end, he only valued Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root.When Ye Qingtang had the supreme-grade spirit root, he could tolerate her ugliness. However, now that her spirit root was destroyed, why did he still need to accept her?Ye Ling stood up in anger and roared. \u201cDuan Tianrao! Shut up! I was blind to allow the engagement between you and Tang Tang! I never knew you that you were this kind of abhorrent person!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is there anything wrong with what I just said?\u201dDuan Tianrao finally removed the entirety of his disguise. He knew long ago from Ye Xun that the Great Elder was the one with power and that Ye Ling was only the master of the family clan only in name.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ye Ling trembled with rage.Ye Xun who was standing aside stepped forward. A slight smile appeared on her face, but she quickly disguised it with an expression full of concern.\u201cFather, please do not be angry.\u201d\u201cDo not be angry? How can I not be angry?\u201d Ye Ling questioned.Ye Xun looked at the tall and strong Duan Tianrao gently and said, \u201cYoung Master Duan has his own reasons. As the next family master, he needs to care for the prestige of the family. Father, I hope you will understand. Tang Tang is still young. She will be able to find a good husband in the future.\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d Ye Ling stared at her adopted daughter unbelievably. He could not believe that she would speak up for Duan Tianrao.Ye Xun stared at the furious Ye Ling and then looked towards Ye Qingtang, who had not spoken at all. She took out the Hunyuan Pills that Duan Tianrao gave her and handed them over to Ye Qingtang.\u201cTang Tang, Young Master Duan cares for you. He even brought the Hunyuan Pills to help you recover,\u201d Ye Xun said as coldness sparkled in her eyes.She was very sure that Ye Qingtang loved Duan Tianrao and that she definitely would not agree to the annulment. Ye Qingtang would not accept the Hunyuan Pills. She might even beg Duan Tianrao to keep the engagement.Eventually, the Hunyuan Pills would return to Ye Xun\u2019s hands.Even though Ye Xun held such beliefs, she still pretended to persuade Ye Qintang sweetly.Ye Qingtang stared at Ye Xun coldly, watching her fake concern. She smiled coldly in her heart.Ye Qingtang saw through Ye Xun\u2019s actions and could read her thoughts. In her previous life, Ye Qingtang was exactly the type of person Ye Xun thought she was. When she knew that Duan Tianrao wanted to annul the engagement, not only did she reject the tonics and Hunyuan Pills that Duan Tianrao gave her, but she also begged him not to abandon her, throwing away her dignity and pride.She did not care about the prestige of Ye family and Ye Ling, and she had placed herself in an inferior position. Ye Ling even vomited blood as he was too furious.However, this time\u2026Suddenly, a smile appeared on Ye Qingtang\u2019s lips. Just as Ye Xun was feeling very confident of her analysis, Ye Qingtang extended her arm and took over the Hunyuan Pills.\u201cThen I will thank Young Master Duan for his kindness.\u201d She then placed the Hunyuan Pills into her own space ring, a dimensional storage item.The whole process happened smoothly.While Ye Ling was still enraged, Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke up for the first time.\u201cFather, I think Young Master Duan has a point as well.\u201dThe three people in the hall were all taken aback by Ye Qingtang\u2019s words.Duan Tianrao stared at Ye Qingtang in surprise. He thought that the moment he asked to annul the engagement, Ye Qingtang definitely would be crying and begging. He did not expect that she would say such words.Ye Ling was also dumbfounded. He looked at his daughter with great concern as he was scared that she was too upset by the news.\u201cTang Tang, what\u2026 what did you say?\u201dYe Qingtang sat on the chair and stared at the three astonished people.She said slowly, \u201cAs a girl, of course I understand it is embarrassing for my engagement to be annulled. However, since Young Master Duan is the heir of the family master, it\u2019s understandable that he needs to focus on the prestige of his family. I am not suitable to be the mistress of the Duan family.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve always been weak. When I had the spirit root, my ability could be considered high. No one would dare to challenge me. However\u2026 now I lost my spirit root. If I still request to marry over to the Duan family, it would make their whole family unsatisfied. I don\u2019t have the ability to defend myself anymore. Why do I have to go over just to be mocked by others? Even though Young Master Duan\u2019s words were not pleasant to listen to, he said them for my own good.\u201dYe Qingtang sounded very calm. None of her sentences were said out of anger. It seemed that she really did believe whatever Duan Tianrao explained.Ye Ling was stunned. He did not imagine that Ye Qingtang would say so.Previously, it was the Duan family who came over to ask for the engagement when Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root just emerged. Now, right after Tang Tang\u2019s spirit root was broken, they claimed that her daughter was extremely ugly. It seemed as if it was the Ye family who was forcing an engagement with the Duan family.Duan Tianrao smiled after hearing what Ye Qingtang just said. He was pleased that she understood the situation. Ye Xun also felt pleased that Ye Qingtang knew what was the right choice to make.Ye Ling\u2019s face was still clouded.Duan Tianrao continued to speak as Ye Ling remained silent for quite a while.\u201cIt\u2019s rare that Tang Tang is so sensible. Uncle Ye, a few days later, it\u2019ll be the day for the greatest families of Lin Town to gather and worship the Heavenly Dao. I am the heir of the Duan family, so my fianc\u00e9 needs to go with me to turn the Heaven-Spinning Wheel. Only a person with a Connate Level Five ability or above can turn that wheel. Do you think Tang Tang\u2019s current ability will be enough for her to turn that wheel?\u201d Duan Tianrao said.\u201cIf she can\u2019t, the prestige of Duan family will be damaged in front of everyone.\u201d\u201cGET OUT! NOW!\u201d Slamming the table violently, Ye Ling shouted at Duan Tianrao and pointed towards the main door.Enough was enough. He would not allow this bastard to continue to humiliate his daughter.He would not allow the Duan family to humiliate his daughter in such a way.Duan Tianrao frowned but decided to keep quiet after seeing how furious Ye Ling was.\u201cUncle Ye, you should figure this matter out by yourself. Whether you agree or not, I am going to annul the engagement in front of everyone in a few days when we worship the Heavenly Dao. I shall leave now.\u201d Duan Tianrao waved his hand insincerely and turned around.\u201cTake all your things back! Our Ye family does not need such rubbish!\u201d Ye Ling said.Duan Tianrao\u2019s mouth twitched. He signaled his servants to bring everything out and walked out of the hall.Ye Xun immediately followed up and said to Ye Ling, \u201cFather, we cannot forget our manners. I shall go and send Young Master Duan off.\u201dYe Xun caught up with Duan Tianrao without waiting for Ye Ling\u2019s reply.Witnessing Ye Xun\u2019s misplaced hospitality, Ye Ling looked towards Ye Qingtang, who kept quiet all along, with indignation.\u201cDoes this Ye Xun understand the situation? Duan Tianrao greatly humiliated you today, yet she still wants to send him off?\u201d Duan Tianrao said.Ye Qingtang was totally unconcerned by Ye Xun\u2019s actions and instead focused on peeling her orange.\u201cFather, if she wants to send him off, just let her be.\u201dThere was no way Ye Xun did not understand the situation.That would be a joke. It was hard to find a person in Lin Town who was smarter than Ye Xun.Ye Ling was not aware that Ye Xun and Duan Tianrao had been secretly together since long ago. It was most likely Ye Xun who told Duan Tianrao the news of Ye Qingtang\u2019s broken spirit root. If not, how could he have come over so early to annul the engagement?Even though Ye Xun was an adopted daughter, she was very good at observing situations. She never liked her position as an adopted daughter of the Ye family even though the family had never treated her unfairly at all. It was definitely Ye Xun who told Duan Tianrao about Qintang\u2019s broken spirit root.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As a result, Ye Qingtang faced great pressure and went over to try to convince Duan Tianrao to change his mind. However, she witnessed the \u2018good news\u2019 between Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun with her own eyes. She herself then became the target that everyone sneered at.Ye Xun was very cunning and alert. In Ye Qintang\u2019s previous life, Ye Xun became the mistress of the Duan family and showed her support to the Great Elder. Using her intelligence, she became the right-hand man of Ye You in the days to come.Ye Qingtang suspected that the chronic poison in Ye Ling\u2019s food was placed in by Ye Xun secretly.After all, Ye Xun always hid herself very well. Ye Qingtang did not suspect her at all until the relationship between Ye Xun and Duan Tianrao was known.Ye Ling treated Ye Xun as another one of his dear children and took good care of her all the time.On the day her spirit root was stolen, Ye Qingtang was led by the Great Elder and Ye You to a place with no one else around, where the act then happened. All these could be credited to Ye Xun, who failed to keep her appointment with Ye Qingtang.Now as she thought over the details again, Ye Qintang realized that Ye Xun was just a poisonous snake, a detestable traitor, that the Great Elder had placed near her.\u201cTang Tang, I\u2019m sorry that you had to go through all these tough situations one after another. I should not have agreed with the engagement from the Duan family back then.\u201d Ye Ling sighed heavily.\u201cBut at least you don\u2019t need to go to turn that Heaven-Spinning Wheel anymore.\u201dYe Ling was also worried that Ye Qingtang might not be able to turn the wheel with her current strength. Now with the engagement annulled, the Ye family would not send Ye Qingtang in order to prevent people from mocking her.Turn the Heaven-Spinning Wheel?Ye Qingtang raised her eyebrows.How was Duan Tianrao so sure that she could not turn the wheel?She needed to go the worshipping of the Heavenly Dao now as it seemed.What was the worst that could happen without the spirit root? She needed to let Duan Tianrao and everyone in Lin Town witness whether she was truly incapable or not!Ye Qingtang put away her thoughts. She smiled and shook her head. \u201cAs long as father is here, I won\u2019t grieve.\u201dShe did not even care about Duan Tianrao that much as long as Ye Ling was safe.\u201cYou silly girl, I cannot be with you for your whole life. You\u2019ll have to marry someone eventually.\u201d Ye Ling touched Ye Qingtang\u2019s hair lovingly. His health was deteriorating over the years. If not because of that, the Great Elder would have never been able to control the Ye family.Ye Ling could not predict when he would pass away. The thing that he worried the most about was Ye Qingtang\u2019s safety.On the other hand, Ye Qingtang knew about Ye Ling\u2019s concern. In her previous life, she was too depressed over Duan Tianrao to notice the abnormality in Ye Ling at all. Only after the Great Elder had asked assassins to kill Ye Ling and frame the Second Elder who just finished his seclusion, Ye Qingtang then realized that Ye family was not the one that she remembered.Ye You took away her supreme-grade spirit root and was selected by the sect masters of the Chao Sect and the Yunxiao Sect. She was accepted as the direct disciple under the sect masters. The Great Elder was sending Ye You to the Yunxiao Sect now, so there was still some time before the Great Elder returned. Ye Qingtang must finish her preparations in this period of time.The real battle would start when the Great Elder returned.Ye Qingtang estimated that the Great Elder would return in half a month\u2019s time. Around the same time, the Second Elder, who always supported Ye Ling and cared for Ye Qingtang, would finish his seclusion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Great Elder would not dare to kill Ye Ling and Ye Qingtang in his presence.In Ye Qintang\u2019s previous life, the Great Elder killed Ye Ling secretly and framed the Second Elder, effectively eliminating the Second Elder as well. Ye Qingtang then lost two of her greatest supporters in the Ye family. If she had not run away quickly enough, she would have been killed by the Great Elder in Lin Town as well.All her suffering in her previous life happened after the Great Elder returned. This time, Ye Qingtang would not allow the same thing to happen again.Whether it was her father or her second uncle, she would protect both of them!She would return the enmity of her previous life a hundredfold back to the Great Elder.Ye Qingtang\u2019s heart was heavy up to this point.\u201cFather, can you ask someone to help me buy some herbs?\u201d Ye Qingtang asked suddenly.\u201cOf course. What do you need? Just write them down, and I\u2019ll ask someone to go and get them for you.\u201d Hoping that she would not be too depressed from what happened with Duan Tianraok Ye Ling tried to satisfy every need of Ye Qingtang.Ye Qingtang nodded and then wrote a long list of herbs to Ye Ling.The first thing Ye Qingtang needed to do was to figure out the identity of the chronic poison in Ye Ling\u2019s body.Ye Ling\u2019s true strength was equal to, or maybe even greater than, that of the Great Elder. It was the poison that the Great Elder had placed every day that caused Ye Ling\u2019s health to deteriorate and his strength to decrease.The Great Elder would not have been able to assassinate Ye Ling successfully in the previous life if not because of that.Her father would regain his original strength only if the remaining poison was cured. If her father\u2019s strength returned, even if the Great Elder wanted to do something, he would not be able to fight her father.In her previous life, even though Ye Qingtang lost her spirit root, she was not depressed all along. She studied and practiced manufacturing, array formation, elixirs, and everything that could help her become more powerful. She memorized the ancient medicine recipes, and she could make any Spirit Pill if she wanted.She only needed ten days at most to clear the poison in her father.Ye Ling asked a servant to buy the herbs and bring them back to the Ye family as soon as possible. Once Ye Qingtang made sure that all herbs were bought, she returned to her room to prepare the antidote immediately.Ye Ling was worried at first whether Ye Qingtang could recover from the emotional setback that Duan Tianrao had caused. However, Ye Ling felt a bit confused after seeing his daughter lock herself up with the herbs.Since when was the little girl interested in herbs?How come he did not realize that?Ye Ling was very perplexed.Ye Qingtang, however, had already started with the preparations.Ye Qingtang was very familiar with herbs, and she was extremely skilled in classifying them accordingly. People who did not know of her talent might have thought that a master physician disguised herself as Ye Qingtang.When she was almost done, she wiped away the beads of sweat on her forehead. When she raised her eyes, she saw her delicate but flawed reflection in the bronze mirror beside her.She lifted her hand subconsciously and touched the large red birthmark on her face. A smile appeared on her mouth. She took a few herbs from the stack, mixed them together, and made a bowl of black herbal soup. She frowned after noticing the pungent odor coming from the soup.Her birthmark had been on her face for very long. In her previous life, she initially thought she was born with the birthmark, but she found out much later that it was caused by a special poison.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Given that the Great Elder dared to poison even Ye Ling, the master of the family clan, it was obvious that he would not let her go either. It was most likely that the poison was fed to her when she was young by the Great Elder.Ye Qingtang would not have noticed that if she did not study medicine many years later in her previous life.The herbal soup in her hands now was the antidote to that poison.In her previous life, Ye Qingtang was very ashamed of herself because of her birthmark and was not willing to reveal her face in front of others. Now, although she did not bother about her appearance anymore, she still did not want the peculiar poison to remain inside her body.Ye Qingtang took a heavy breath and poured the entire bowl of stinky herbal soup into her mouth. She almost cried after tasting the extreme bitterness of the soup.\u201cI\u2019ll never drink this again in my life.\u201d Ye Qingtang frowned and wiped off the soup residue on her mouth.Right after she drank the herbal soup, Ye Qingtang felt a stabbing pain on the portion of her face with the birthmark. She immediately went in front of the bronze mirror and observed the changes to her face.The large red birthmark gradually disappeared in front of her eyes, revealing pure white skin.Without the birthmark, Ye Qingtang\u2019s appearance changed immensely. Her delicate features appeared more luring on her white face, and the ugly woman in the mirror transformed into an astonishing beauty.\u201cThis\u2026 Now, this is much more pleasing to the eye.\u201d Ye Qingtang touched the part of her face that just recovered and smiled, exhibiting unbelievable beauty.Ye Qingtang admired her reflection for a while and then packed things up. She immersed herself in the bath bucket to wash off the fatigue of the day.Cold water immersed her skin gradually. She felt as if she was reborn by the refreshing coldness of the bath.As she calmed down, she recalled all the things that happened in her previous life, but she could only remember up to the moment she crushed her heart on Lingyun Mountain\u2026Ye Qingtang still could not figure out why she was not dead.In her previous life, Ye Qingtang did not know that the heart inside her was the Heart of the Demon God until much later. She only felt that her heart was different from others and that it would sometimes let out some kind of sinister aura.Ye Qingtang did not have any contact with the power at that time. She tried to suppress it, but people still treated her as an evil demon\u2026\u201cThe Heart of the Demon God, everyone is craving for you. If you really are as powerful as how they describe you, then\u2026 lend me your power\u2026\u201d Ye Qingtang rested her head on the edge of the bucket. Her eyes were hidden by a layer of water vapor, but one could still observe the coldness in her eyes.As long as she could take her revenge and send all her enemies to hell, she would not mind abandoning her human skin and becoming a demon!Just as she finished her words, the heart that was beating stably suddenly twitched. A strand of dark fog came out of the Heart of the Demon God and poured into her body. A sharp pain spread throughout her body and dashed towards her lower stomach.The place that used to store the spirit root was cold as ice when her spirit root was dug out, and Ye Qingtang was more familiar with this emptiness than anyone else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That warm and wet feeling was exactly how it felt when the spirit root was still inside her body.Ye Qingtang opened her eyes wide in disbelief. A small spirit root was growing slowly inside her body again.Even though the size of the spirit root could not be compared with the supreme-grade one she used to have, the fact that a new spirit root was growing made Ye Qingtang extremely excited. From her past experiences, she knew how difficult it was to cultivate without a spirit root.Ye Qingtang spent three hundred years in her previous life trying to find ways to restore her spirit root in order to catch up with Ye You, but all her efforts were to no avail.Only God would know how precious it was for Ye Qingtang to have the small spirit root growing inside her again!\u201cYe You! You shall wait for my revenge!\u201d Ye Qingtang touched her lower stomach gently. Her eyes were brightly lit with the flames of revenge.\u2026Around the same time Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root was restored, a man who sat on the Paragon seat opened his eyes suddenly in the Antiquity Palace. A blackish-green light sparkled in his eyes.\u201cYour Highness?\u201d Mu Su who was standing at the bottom of the palace noticed the sudden behavior of the man and came forward.The handsome man raised his eyes and looked outside the palace into the endless darkness, and his eyes shimmered.\u201cSet off to Lin Town now.\u201dMu Su was stunned. \u201cYour Highness, is it\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Heart of the Demon God has appeared,\u201d the man said.He felt the familiar aura again after so long.The Heart of the Demon God finally appeared again\u2026He would take back everything that belonged to him!\u2026The next morning, Ye Qingtang woke up and was full of vigor. Having her spirit rook back, she was in an extremely good mood. As long as she took care of the spirit root, she would be able to fight against Ye You in the future.Ye Qingtang felt more confident about her revenge now that her spirit root was restored. Her plan was also altered accordingly.She needed to deal with the Great Elder, but she did not forget that her real enemy was Ye You.But now that Ye You was selected as the disciple of the Yunxiao Sect by the sect master, Ye Qingtang also needed to enter the sect to be qualified to fight Ye You!Ye Qingtang had a plan up her sleeve. She put on her veil and walked out.Even though she restored her appearance, she did not plan to let others know about it so soon.Seeing Ye Qingtang leaving her room, Ye Ling walked towards her worriedly. To his relief, it seemed that his daughter was not affected majorly by the annulment.Ye Qingtang noticed her father and turned towards him.\u201cFather.\u201dYe Ling nodded slightly. His eyes were filled with sympathy.\u201cFather, do you know about the Third Young Master of the Si family, Si Bai?\u201d Ye Qingtang suddenly asked.\u201cSi Bai?\u201d Ye Ling was stunned for a second.The Si family was one of the greatest family clans in Lin Town. Unlike with the Duan family, the Si family was always not on good terms with the Ye family. Si Bai\u2019s mother died during labor, and it was found out that she was poisoned secretly. The Si family suspected that it was the Ye family that poisoned her.If not thanks to the help from the Duan family for the past few years, Ye family would have been in a fight with the Si family due to the resentment between the two families.Nevertheless, the two families were still not in good terms with each other.The Si Bai that Ye Qingtang mentioned was the Third Young Master of the Si family. He was the favorite grandson of the Elder of the Si family clan. Si Bai was talented, and his spirit root was comparable with the supreme-grade one of Ye Qingtang. He was the number one genius in Lin Town. However, Si Bai had been affected by the poisoning of his mother\u2019s as well, causing Si Bai to have a weak body ever since he was born.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As such, the Si family spared no effort trying to extend the life of their Third Young Master, the most precious member of the Si family.Ye Ling, having no idea why Ye Qingtang mentioned Si Bai, said, \u201cSi Bai\u2019s condition has been not very stable recently. I heard that the Si family even invited Master Physician Xu over, but it did not seem to help.\u201dMaster Physician Xu was a famous master physician in Lin Town. Countless people tried to seek for his help, but he rarely helped them. It all depended on his will to save a person.It was apparent that the Si family had spent a lot of effort to invite Master Physician Xu over.Ye Qingtang nodded as if thinking of something and said, \u201cFather, I need to go out and buy something. I shall leave first.\u201dYe Ling stared at Ye Qingtang with confusion.What happened?Why did Ye Qingtang want to go out alone?Was this a dream?It was well-known that Ye Qingtang was not willing to go out because of her birthmark. Even if she left the house, she would be inside a palanquin to hide herself from the public.How come today\u2026Ye Qingtang suddenly changed?Ye Ling felt that her daughter had become another person after her spirit root was broken. She was totally different now.\u201cThen\u2026 be careful outside.\u201d Ye Ling was concerned about Ye Qingtang\u2019s safety, but seeing her newfound independence, he was more relieved than worried.After Ye Qingtang left the Ye family, she walked to the Si family slowly.Ye Qingtang had heard about the Third Young Master of the Si family in her previous life. He was really an incredible genius. The Si family had tried all ways to extend his life, but he was only able to live to 25 years. Si Bai was extremely famous and reputable, and even Ye You did not dare to offend him. However, eventually Si Bai passed away, and Ye You took the chance to terminate the entire Si family along with the Ye family.To prevent similar situations from happening, Ye Qingtang was going to extend Si Bai\u2019s life!However, she was not just a kind person who wanted to offer help. She wanted to make a deal, one that could get her into the sect, with the Si family.Anyone not in the sect was as weak as an ant. One could only be considered truly strong after they stepped onto the Path to Heaven and entered the sect. Only then, they would be able to learn high level skills and cultivate their spirit roots. Without joining the sect, one could never reach the Paragon level no matter how much talent they possessedThe difference between a person in the sect and a normal person was insurmountable. Once a person entered the sect, they were entirely different from normal people.Any inner sect disciple had the power to dominate a part of the world.As such, it was extremely difficult to enter the sect. Simply being in the greatest family clans like the Ye family, or even the royal family, was not enough to qualify. It was easier to learn to fly through the skies than to qualify to enter the sect.Ye You was recognized by the sect and was able to enter thanks to the supreme-grade spirit root she had snatched from Ye Qingtang. From there, Ye You learned millions of skills in the sect and reached the Paragon level. In contrast,Ye Qingtang in her previous life put in a lot of effort in her training and eventually reached the Paragon level as well, but her abilities were still completely incomparable to Ye You\u2019s.However, now that she was given a second chance\u2026Ye Qingtang raised her eyes and stared at the door of the Si family. A cold smile appeared on her face.The Si family was able to introduce people to the sect. If she could seize the opportunity and enter the sect, she would be one step closer to defeating Ye You!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was the first step to her revenge towards Ye You.The servants of the Si family blocked the way as they saw Ye Qingtang.Ye Qingtang raised her eyebrows slightly. She smiled and spoke the first sentence that would change her fate in this life. \u201cTell your master, I have a way to save your third young master.\u201d\u2026Master Si frowned and stared at the handsome young man in the hall. His eyes were full of concern. It was heartbreaking for him to witness how pale the young man was. He then asked Master Physician Xu, who was monitoring the pulse of the young man.\u201cMaster Physician Xu, my third grandson\u2019s health\u2026\u201dMaster Physician Xu was more than fifty years old, and his skills were renowned in the world. However, he shook his head. \u201cThe poison in the third young master Si was obtained when he was a fetus. The poison is deep inside him, and it is impossible to remove.\u201dAfter hearing Master Physician Xu\u2019s words, Master Si\u2019s face was as white as a sheet. His heart dropped to the bottom of the valley.Meanwhile, Si Bai sat on his chair and adjusted his sleeve calmly. His nonchalant attitude made it seem as if he did not care how long he had to live. Instead, he tried to comfort his grandfather. \u201cGrandfather, I\u2019m alright. You don\u2019t need to worry that much.\u201dSeeing his grandson\u2019s pale face, Master Si felt as if a knife were being twisted in his heart. He felt immense resentment.\u201cAlright? How can you be alright? If only the Ye family didn\u2019t bribe someone to poison your mother when she was pregnant, she wouldn\u2019t have died, and you wouldn\u2019t have to suffer from the ice toxin as a result!!\u201d\u201cGrandfather, there\u2019s no evidence to prove that the Ye family poisoned my mother\u2026\u201d Si Bai sighed softly.Master Si sneered. \u201cEvidence? If there were evidence, I would\u2019ve wiped out the entire Ye family long ago. How would I be able to tolerate their unbridled behaviors!\u201dSi Bai kept quiet.At that moment, one of the Si family\u2019s servants rushed in and repeated the words that Ye Qingtang had said outside.\u201cShe has a way to save my third grandson?\u201d Master Si mocked in anger. \u201cThe Ye family is getting more and more presumptuous! I haven\u2019t troubled them at all, and now they dare to come to me!\u201d\u201cGood! Good! Good! Let her in! If she cannot save my third grandson, I\u2019ll use the Young Lady of the Ye family to settle my resentment!\u201dSi Bai frowned as he knew how resentful his grandfather was towards the Ye family.\u201cGrandfather, the Young Lady of the Ye family is still very young\u2026\u201d Si Bai said.\u201cGrandson, you don\u2019t need to care about this. I know what to do.\u201d Master Si replied in a deep voice.Si Bai sighed as he could not persuade his grandfather. He looked towards the entrance of the hall as if he was thinking about something.Soon, a servant of the Si family led a young lady with a veil into the hall.When Si Bai\u2019s sight was on the young lady, he was stunned for a moment. He had heard of the rumor of the Ye family\u2019s Young Lady before. The rumor said that she was weak, ugly, and wore a veil all the time. Today, he understood that the rumor was wrong.The lady was very young and calm. Even though the veil covered her appearance, her eyes were bright and clear.Si Bai did not believe that a lady with such bright eyes would be an ugly person. He did not believe that such a calm lady would be weak at all.Ye Qingtang who had just stepped into the hall seemed to notice Si Bai\u2019s sight. She raised her eyes subconsciously, and her pair of bright eyes gazed upon the handsome young man.When the two made eye contact, a breathtaking smile was seen on Si Bai\u2019s face. He nodded at Ye Qingtang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If she remembered correctly, the ice toxin that plagued Si Bai and caused the death of his mother had always been thought of as the doing of the Ye family. Yet, why is it that this person was still smiling at her?In reality, the Si family\u2019s guess was not wrong.The poison used to kill Si Bai\u2019s mother was indeed the doing of the Ye family. However, this had nothing to do with Ye Ling; this entire scheme was, in fact, secretly done by the Great Elder of the Ye family.This was only made known to Ye Qingtang when she was on the run in her previous life.Including her previous life, this was her first time seeing Si Bai, who, as rumored, was an elegant and talented youth whose handsome face was abnormally pale.Looking away from him and to the strict-looking old man seated in the center, she greeted,\u201cGrandfather Si.\u201dThe master of the Si family clan scoffed. No matter how outstanding the looks of the girl in front of him, his hatred towards the Ye family could never be erased.\u201cI am not your grandfather! Do not address me in any way you like. So tell me, Ye Qingtang, you said that you are able to save my third grandson?\u201d\u201cYes, Master Si,\u201d she replied with a small laugh while completely paying no attention to his animosity.This was because she understood the reason behind his resentment: the Elder Master held the same family name \u201cYe\u201d.Looking over her thin frame with disdain, Master Si bellowed, \u201cYe Qingtang, I don\u2019t care if you are the Young Lady of the Ye family. Do you know of the potential outcomes of your audacity to spout nonsense at the Si family door today?\u201dYe Qingtang clearly sensed his hostility towards her, yet she disregarded it and replied with a smile, \u201cSince I dared to come, it naturally means I am confident. Isn\u2019t it arbitrary of you to claim that I am spouting nonsense when you have not heard what I am going to say?\u201d\u201cArbitrary?\u201d Master Si scoffed, \u201cThe Si family has looked for famous physicians all over the world to treat my third grandson. You are only fifteen this year, and I have never heard of the Ye family having any medical attainments, so where did you find the confidence to speak this way?\u201dAlthough Master Si allowed Ye Qingtang to come in, he had never at all believed she could really save Si Bai. All he wanted to do was to vent his anger, and even if he couldn\u2019t kill Ye Qingtang, he had to make the Ye family pay a price!\u201cGrandfather, since Young Lady Ye came here personally, I believe she is definitely prepared. Why don\u2019t you let her try since you have already let her in?\u201d Si Bai, who had been standing aside all along, said suddenly. This was to help Ye Qingtang.Master Si clearly did not expect his own grandson to speak up for Ye Qingtang. Instantly, his face darkened, and his brows wrinkled.Ye Qingtang had already prepared what to say to persuade Master Si, yet the third young master actually helped her out of the predicament before she needed to say anything. This unforeseen situation slightly baffled Ye Qingtang, and she could not help but look at the beautiful young man with a smile in her eyes.Si Bai was actually quite kind.Si Bai only politely returned Ye Qingtang a smile.He did not want his grandfather to be angry over an immature young lady.\u201cNonsense!\u201d Master Si was clearly in disapproval.Si Bai let out a small laugh. Just as he was about to say something, Ye Qingtang responded, \u201cI\u2019m already in the territory of the Si family. If I make any errors, Master Si can question me anytime. Even if I do have any ulterior motives, I won\u2019t take my own life as a joke, right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If any another person from the Ye family had come today, he would have called people to drag the person away. However, Ye Qingtang was the Young Lady of the Ye family and the only child of Master Ye. Thus, she was the next successor to the Ye family.After a moment of silence, Master Si finally said, \u201cI can let you try today, however\u2026\u201dHis gaze sharpened!\u201cIf you cannot verbally explain the method to save my third grandson to us, don\u2019t even think about walking out this door!\u201dSi Bai\u2019s expression changed slightly. Just as he was about to persuade his grandfather, Ye Qingtang agreed without hesitation. \u201cOkay.\u201dMaster Si scoffed and turned towards Master Physician Xu. \u201cMaster Physician Xu, good thing you\u2019re here today. Please look over from the side later. If anyone tries to harm my third grandson\u2026\u201dMaster Physician Xu responded, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Master Si, I\u2019ll be looking carefully.\u201dIt was only then that Master Si nodded in satisfaction. Afterward, he turned to look at Ye Qingtang with a piercing gaze as if there were two sharp blades hidden in his eyes.\u201cYe Qingtang, I\u2019ll give you a chance. Now, tell us the method to save my third grandson.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYe Qingtang looked at Master Si who wore an if-you-say-it-wrong-you-are-dead-meat expression. She knew that Si Bai was Master Si\u2019s favourite grandson, yet she did not expect Master Si to be cautious to this extent. Even though he ordered Master Physician Xu to pay attention beside her, he did not even give her the opportunity to take the pulse of Si Bai and wanted her to directly give the answer.In terms of being overbearing, this old grandfather was undoubtedly the first!\u201cCan I not take the pulse of the Third Young Master?\u201d Ye Qingtang asked to test the waters.Master Si scoffed as if it was a matter of fact. \u201cObviously!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Alright, alright, alright. Whatever you say.\u201dWith no hint of anxiousness or annoyance, she asked someone to bring some pen and ink over and wrote a prescription on the spot.Upon seeing this, Master Physician Xu silently shook his head from the side. Even he could tell that Master Si was driving Ye Qingtang into a corner: Without even letting this young lady to check Si Bai\u2019s situation, how could she come up with a treatment?Si Bai looked slightly perplexed.On the other hand, an ice cold expression was etched onto Master Si\u2019s face as he waited to order people to take her away the moment she was done writing. Then, he could vent his anger on her.Without spending much time, Ye Qingtang wrote two lengthy prescriptions and directly presented them to Master Si.Master Si did not even spare a glance and laughed coldly. \u201cYe Qingtang, you have not even seen the condition of my third grandson yet still dared to write a prescription in such a steadfast manner. I think that you are not here to save a life but instead to take a life!\u201dYe Qingtang looked at Master Si, not knowing whether to laugh or to cry. First, he did not even let her take Si Bai\u2019s pulse. And now, he was claiming that she randomly wrote a prescription.She was aware that given the Si\u2019s hatred towards the Ye family, Master Si would definitely make things difficult for her. However\u2026\u201cSince Master Physician Xu is here today, why don\u2019t Master Si let him take a look at the prescription first before making a conclusion?\u201d Ye Qingtang smiled as her eyes were full of confidence.\u201cI\u2019ll let you have a deathbed struggle,\u201d scoffed Master Si. \u201cI just want to see how much longer you can be so stubborn and not admit your mistake!\u201dThen, he passed the prescription to Master Physician Xu without taking his eyes away from her.Ye Qingtang shrugged casually.Master Physician Xu read through the prescription very carefully. The slight worry on his face from before was gradually replaced by shock as he read on.\u201cThis prescription\u2026 this prescription\u2026\u201d Master Physician Xu suddenly exclaimed.Seeing this, Master Si pounded the table and stood up. With a finger pointed at Ye Qingtang he shouted, \u201cYe Qingtang, what more do you have to say!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He did not believe that Ye Qingtang was able to treat him at such a young age.\u201cSi Bai, move away!\u201d Master Si\u2019s face darkened quickly.Si Bai frowned slightly. Looking towards Ye Qingtang, he muttered discreetly, \u201cLady Ye, I\u2019ll send you back.\u201d Then, he tried to bring Ye Qingtang away.However, Ye Qingtang stood still without budging. With a faint smile, she turned to him and shook her head.Si Bai\u2019s eyes were filled with puzzlement. He did not know that the Young Lady of the Ye family was this stubborn.Given his grandfather\u2019s hatred towards the Ye family, it was likely that he would cut Ye Qingtang up. If she did not leave now, she would probably never be able to leave anymore.As expected, right as Si Bai thought about that fact, Master Si ordered loudly, \u201cTake Ye Qingtang away!\u201dUpon hearing the commotion, the servants outside the hall entered the hall and rolled up their sleeves, ready to take Ye Qingtang down.However\u2026\u201cWait! Wait! A misunderstanding! A misunderstanding!\u201dReturning back to his senses after a state of astonishment, Master Physician Xu made a frenzied dash towards the front of Ye Qingtang and shielded her with his shivering hands the moment he saw Master Si ordering people to take her away. He raised the prescription in his hands and looked at Master Si with flustered eyes.\u201cMaster Physician Xu, what are you doing?\u201d Master Si looked confusedly at the man who suddenly came forward to disrupt the scene.Master Physician Xu was about to cry from anxiety. \u201cMaster Si, do not injure Lady Ye! Do not injure her!\u201d\u201cWhy not! Her prescription obviously wants to harm my third\u2026\u201d\u201cThis prescription is real! It can really save the third young master\u2019s life!!!\u201d He said hurriedly.\u201c\u2026\u201d Master Si looked at him unbelievingly. \u201cWhat did you say?!\u201dMaster Physician Xu let out a deep breath. After sorting out his emotions, he said, \u201cPreviously, I told Master that removing the toxin in the third young master was almost impossible. In this world, the only prescription that can completely remove inherited ice toxin can only be found in the Ancient Book of Medicine. However, this book has been missing for a long time, and my master had only been able to obtain fragments of a few pages of the book. A while ago, I noticed that the two prescriptions Lady Ye wrote indeed are targeted towards eliminating the poison within the third young master. With long term medication, the poison can be effectively removed. Although I dare not say that he will be able to enjoy longevity, however, living up to thirty years old is definitely not a problem!\u201dMaster Physician Xu was extremely excited. Never would he have believed that he would see a prescription from the Ancient Book of Medicine from a fifteen-year-old girl.God knows how precious this book was to all the physicians in the world. Many people had spent their entire lifetime looking for it, yet they were not even able to find any fragments of the book. However, he was able to see it today, in the writing of a young girl!At this point, Master Physician Xu looked at Ye Qingtang with unparalleled fervor.Master Si was completely taken aback. Master Physician Xu shared a deep relationship with the Si family, and he was extremely skilled. Naturally, Master Si could believe whatever he said.Then, Master Si\u2019s expression changed slightly.Si Bai, who was standing aside, froze for a moment. He looked with astonishment at Ye Qingtang, whose expression was calm.Ye Qingtang flashed him a small smile and stepped forward, facing Master Si.\u201cCan Master Si trust me now?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He did not know how to react to what just happened.He initially thought Ye Qingtang was here to seek death, yet who knew\u2026She really was able to write a lifesaving prescription to cure the toxin.\u201cBring some tea for Lady Ye!\u201d said Master Si as he took a deep breath.Seeing the change of orders from their Master, the servants who were initially in the hall immediately left in dejection. A young male servant who understood what was going on quickly served Ye Qingtang a cup of tea.\u201cTake a seat.\u201d Master Si said while looking at Ye Qingtang. Although his tone was still strict, the words he used were significantly less harsh.No matter how much he hated the Ye family previously, it was undeniable that Ye Qingtang\u2019s prescription could really save Si Bai\u2019s life.Ye Qingtang received the cup of tea. Recognizing the change in Master Si\u2019s attitude, she took a seat on a chair beside.The Ancient Book of Medicine had indeed been lost for a long time. However, three hundred years later in Ye Qintang\u2019s previous life, the book was found. Ye Qingtang had flipped through the entire book, and with her photographic memory, she was able to clearly memorize everything on the book. Although the ice toxin within Si Bai was seen as an incurable disease by current physicians, three hundred years later, it was not a big deal at all.Si Bai relaxed as well. Looking at how his grandfather\u2019s expression changed, he silently chuckled and returned to his seat.The atmosphere in the hall was very peculiar. As though he had not adjusted to the drastic change of events, Master Si took a few sips of tea silently as he sized Ye Qingtang up with a deep gaze in search of answers.\u201cWhy do you want to save my third grandson?\u201d he finally asked after a while.\u201cLike fire and water, the Si family has a deep hatred towards the Ye family and can never get along well. As the Young Lady of the Ye family, why do you want to help us, the Si\u2019s?\u201d he questioned. While he believed in the authenticity of the prescriptions, he could not guess the reason behind Ye Qingtang\u2019s willingness to help the Si family.Ye Qingtang replied, \u201cThe Ye family is no longer the same Ye family as before.\u201dMaster Si frowned slightly.\u201cMaster Si should know that my father\u2019s health has been deteriorating in recent years. The Great Elder of the Ye family, who has been wanting the family clan master position for a long time, saw this as the opportunity to take over my father\u2019s power. Now, my father no longer controls the Ye family, and most of the people in the Ye residence are all on the Great Elder\u2019s side. Given the Great Elder\u2019s ambition, both my father and I have become a thorn in his flesh and would not hesitate to get rid of us,\u201d Ye Qingtang said without hurry. In order for Master Si to let down his guard, she must say the truth, or else she will not be able to reach her objectives given the Si family\u2019s hatred towards the Ye\u2019s.After hearing the term \u201cGreat Elder of the Ye family,\u201d Master Si\u2019s frown deepened. It was this Great Elder who Master Si suspected as the culprit behind the poisoning of Si Bai\u2019s mother.\u201cPlotting to murder the family clan master and his successor is a major offense in a family clan. Even if the Great Elder of the Ye family wants to harm you, he needs to act carefully as well. If this news spreads, he will not be able to become the family clan master,\u201d said Master Si as he did not easily believe Ye Qingtang\u2019s words.Ye Qingtang chuckled and responded, \u201cIf he really wants to harm us, it would be easy, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201dShe paused for a moment and continued, \u201cYe You, a girl from the Ye family and the biological granddaughter of the Great Elder, was accepted into the Yunxiao Sect as an exception several days ago after the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master took a fancy to her. I wonder if you have heard of this?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even more so, it was the Great Elder of the Ye family who let out the news of Ye You\u2019s supreme-grade spirit root.She let out a burst of laughter suddenly, of which had an indescribable hint of sarcasm. \u201cThat spirit root was originally mine.\u201dMaster Si was taken aback for a moment. That spirit root was Ye Qingtang\u2019s?She lifted her shirt up a little, showing her abdomen. Although it was only the size of two fingers, a hideous scar was painfully obvious on her fair skin.\u201cIt was Ye You who personally cut open my abdomen, dug out my spirit root, and put it into her body. All of this was the Great Elder\u2019s intention. In order to let his granddaughter obtain a supreme-grade spirit root, he did not hesitate to harm me. Then, in order to snatch the position of the family clan master, why would he let a stumbling block like me off?\u201d She put her shirt down indifferently as she spoke calmly as though she had not personally experienced all that misery.This sight completely shocked everyone in the hall.Cutting open the abdomen to dig the spirit root!What cruelty!The spirit root was the root of every powerful person\u2019s ability to stay safe and pursue their goals, as well as the source of their energy. To dig out another\u2019s spirit root and use it for oneself was not just despicable but also prohibited even to the evilest person.Who would have thought that such an act actually happened in the Ye family?Master Si took a deep breath. At this instant, he finally noticed that the reason Ye Qingtang came to the Si family was to find a way out for her and her father.Given how the Great Elder was in complete control of the Ye family now, it seemed that both father and daughter would be in danger in days to come \u2026With bright and clear eyes, she looked at Master Si and continued. \u201cThese two prescriptions can help Third Young Master to get out from his predicament and is a display of my sincerity. Not only can I let him be free from pain, but I can also make him be as healthy as normal people and ensure he lives up to hundreds of years old.\u201dHer words struck Master Si\u2019s weak spot.He had put in so much effort only to let Si Bai live longer.\u201cWhat do you want the Si family to do for you? If you want us to stand up for you, I\u2019m afraid that is impossible. If we could harm the Ye family, I would\u2019ve destroyed your entire family long ago,\u201d Master Si replied.Ye Qingtang chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll stand up for myself and seek revenge myself. I just need the Si family to help me with a favor.\u201d\u201cYou may ask anything as long as it does not involve the internal fighting within the Ye family,\u201d promised Master Si.A trace of laughter flashed across Ye Qingtang\u2019s eyes. What she wanted was exactly this promise.\u201cI wish for Master Si to refer me to someone.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cMu Su.\u201dMaster Si\u2019s expression changed, and he looked at Ye Qingtang weirdly.Mu Su was the City Lord of Fallen Stars City. His name was well known all over the city, and his skills were immeasurable. He was an extremely powerful person of high status who had close relations with many sect masters. Even the monarch had to lower his head whenever he saw Mu Su.The Si family and Mu Su had close connections. However, only a handful of people in the Si family knew about this. Where did Ye Qingtang find out about it from?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In her previous life when the Si family was destroyed by Ye You, Mu Su had sought revenge for the Si\u2019s. Had Ye You\u2019s master not come in time, Ye You would have been killed by Mu Su.Mu Su had both a special identity and a high rank. He was Ye Qingtang\u2019s real target. Only a shockingly powerful person like Mu Su had the ability to recommend her to a sect!And only through entering a sect would she be able to have the capital for a showdown with Ye You!\u201cDo\u2026 do let me consider this. I need to ask for Lord Mu Su\u2019s opinion.\u201d Master Si hesitated. This was not a decision he could make himself.\u201cI can wait,\u201d laughed Ye Qingtang. She believed that the Si family would do their best to persuade Mu Su for Si Bai\u2019s sake.Nodding his head slightly, Master Si responded, \u201cI will pass your message to Lord Mu Su, but I can not guarantee he will be willing to meet.\u201d Master Si remembered to add on, \u201cI will do my best.\u201d\u201cThank you, Master Si, in advance!\u201d Ye Qingtang replied.\u201cThis is a must. You saved my third grandson. The Si family will return any favors owed,\u201d said Master Si.Ye Qingtang smiled. She knew the Si family\u2019s teaching. Otherwise, she would not have gone there so assuringly.\u2026Although she could not obtain the item to let Si Bai live up to hundreds of years old in such a short time, the two prescriptions that Ye Qingtang gave were enough to get everyone in the Si family worked up.Master Physician Xu took this opportunity to discuss the two prescriptions. In front of Ye Qingtang, the master physician was extremely respectful and eager to seek new knowledge.Seeing as how she had already achieved her goal, Ye Qingtang stood up and said, \u201cIt is late already, I should leave now.\u201dNodding his head lightly, Master Si specially ordered the housekeeper to see Ye Qingtang out.As he looked at the back of the leaving Ye Qingtang, Master Si wore a thoughtful look.Why was it that the Young Lady of the Ye family was different from the rumors? Such boldness and calm composure were definitely hard to find amongst people her age. When he finally turned back around, he saw his grandson, who was seated in a chair with a hand supporting his chin, looking back at him with a faint smile.\u201cIf I remember correctly, grandfather has always wanted a granddaughter, yes?\u201dThe younger generation of the Si family only had 3 males.Master Si frowned slightly and chided, \u201cDo not talk nonsense!\u201dSi Bai chuckled and looked down as the image of Ye Qingtang\u2019s neither humble nor disrespectful figure appeared in his mind.Ye Qingtang\u2026 is interesting.\u2026After leaving the Si family, Ye Qingtang went straight back to the Ye family. Ye Ling saw his returning daughter and was filled with curiosity. Yet, he kept his composure and did not ask her anything.Ye Qingtang went directly back to the room to cultivate. The restoration of her spirit root was indeed precious, yet if she cultivated at such a slow pace, she would not be able to achieve anything. As such, she needed to make full use of her time for cultivation.As darkness fell, Ye Qingtang went to sleep after cultivating her spirit root for a while. However, she was in such a deep sleep that she did not notice a black aura surging from within the Heart of the Demon God. The aura which had helped Ye Qingtang rebuild her spirit root flowed from her heart and out of her body.That black fog, which emerged from the Heart of the Demon God, slowly formed into a small black ball above Ye Qingtang\u2019s body and quietly laid on her chest, rubbing itself against Ye Qingtang comfortably.Under the moonlight, two mighty figures appeared outside the door of the Ye family.Mu Su looked at the Ye residence before him and hesitated for a moment before turning to look at the aloof and handsome man beside him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the darkness, his deep set of eyes looked towards the firmly locked main door of the Ye family, and in an instant, the door was opened. He headed in.\u201cStay here.\u201dA low and pleasant voice traveled out from his mouth. Mu Su devotedly guarded outside the door as he watched the man enter the Ye family.Sensing something, the small black ball lying on Ye Qingtang\u2019s chest instinctively quivered and quickly hid under Ye Qingtang\u2019s sheets.In the next moment, the door to Ye Qingtang\u2019s room opened without a sound, showing a tall figure standing outside.The man, sensing a familiar aura, walked to Ye Qingtang\u2019s bedside. Using the moonlight to look at the young girl, an exquisite small face which looked like god\u2019s most perfect creation came into sight. In her sound asleep state, she appeared lovely and gentle.Yet, there was not a slight emotion in the man\u2019s deep set of eyes. He lifted his hands suddenly and placed them on Ye Qingtang\u2019s chest, pausing for a moment when he felt a softness against his palms before quickly returning back to normal.A wisp of aura flowed from where Ye Qingtang\u2019s heart was and gathered in his palm.The small black ball, which was hidden under the blanket, stared at what he was doing and anxiously rushed out from under the blanket, crashing right into the man\u2019s \u201cdisobedient\u201d hand!Upon the collision with the small black ball, the aura which was just gathered dispersed and a black fog traveled up his palm. Frowning slightly, he looked towards the little black ball which was lying in front of Ye Qingtang\u2019s chest and protecting her.\u201cYou cannot dig her heart out!\u201d A soft and weak voice which sounded like that of a kid emerged from the small black ball.The man glared at that small black ball with a serious expression and said in an icy cold tone,\u201cThat is mine.\u201dAngered, the small black ball immediately tightened its guard.The man glared at that small black ball with a thoughtful expression. \u201cThe Aura of the Evil actually gained consciousness\u2026\u201d Instinctively looking at Ye Qingtang who was sound asleep, he continued, \u201cIs it because of her?\u201dThe Heart of the Demon God bore the Aura of the Evil on heaven and earth, yet this aura formed into a spirit which should not exist. Could it be that the Aura of the Evil was awoken by this young girl?\u201cI already have consciousness now. You cannot make me vanish!\u201d sputtered the small black ball angrily. It was originally the Aura of the Evil contained within the Heart of the Demon God. Now that it finally managed to gain a little consciousness after being awoken by Ye Qingtang, it would lose its consciousness forever once he takes away the Heart of the Demon God!It did not want that to happen!It had just gained consciousness; It did not want to disappear!\u201cIt is not your choice,\u201d the man said coldly.\u201cIf you dare to dig the heart out, I will self destruct! You will not get anything at all!\u201d the small black ball replied in fury.Slightly narrowing his eyes, a dangerous cold light flashed across them.Nothing could ever threaten him.As if it sensed the dangerous aura coming from the man, the small black ball could not help but withdraw into Ye Qingtang\u2019s arms.\u201cI\u2026 I can return the heart to you, but you must provide me with a body.\u201d\u201cImpossible.\u201d How could the Aura of the Evil have a body?\u201cWho says it is impossible! If it is the child of you and her, it is possible! I am a spirit bred from your heart and her body, and only a body with both your bloodlines would be able to bear my consciousness.\u201d The small black ball got increasingly excited as it spoke.If it becomes her child, does it mean it can address her as \u201cmother\u201d ~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just as the small black ball\u2019s words, he would not have any means to get his heart back if the small black ball resisted.An icy cold gaze with an awfully murderous intent landed on the small black ball for a long while. Confirming that there was nothing that could be done with that black ball in the way, the man finally left.Upon seeing the man\u2019s departure, the small black ball finally stopped quivering and went back to Ye Qingtang\u2019s arms, moving around like a cat that had curled up into a ball.\u201cMother~ mother~\u201dIt liked Ye Qingtang; It liked this girl who awoke it. It was she and the Heart of the Demon God that bred it. She must be its mother!The moment the man exited from the Ye family\u2019s main door, Mu Su who had been guarding outside instantly noticed the gloomy expression on the man\u2019s face.\u201cYour Highness?\u201dThe man furrowed his brows. After a moment of silence\u2026\u201cHow do I make a lady bear a child for me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Upon hearing the question, Mu Su\u2019s eyes almost popped out.What did he just hear?!The noble and cold Demon God who had severed romantic relations actually asked such a shocking question!\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Many thoughts raced across Mu Su\u2019s mind. Swallowing his saliva, he replied hesitantly, \u201cAs long as a lady truly falls in love with a guy, I supposed she would willingly have his child?\u201d\u201cFall in love?\u201d The man, who wore a cold expression all year round, showed a look of suspicion for the first time.\u2026Ye Qingtang had a dream, a very weird one.In the dream, she was being chased after a bouncing small black ball which called her \u201cmother\u201d\u2026When she was awake, she did not understand why she would have such a ridiculous dream. However, she quickly ignored and forgot about whatever that happened in the dream.Ye Qingtang got up after washing up slightly. After the incident yesterday, the Si family was considered secure. However, it was not so easy to make the Si family truly do their best for her. She was not anxious though. To her, half a month\u2019s time was enough for her to prepare everything.Today, Ye Qingtang had other things to do. The Si family and Mu Su were both external powers. She was fully aware that if she wanted to take revenge on her enemies from her past life, the only thing she could truly rely on was strengthening herself!Now that she had obtained a new spirit root, albeit one that was overly weak and tiny, she must hurry and \u201cfatten\u201d this small spirit root up!Ye Qingtang left the Ye residence and dashed towards the Pavilion of Treasures in the eastern corner of Lin Town.The Pavilion of Treasures was well-known throughout the world. Not just in Lin Town, branch stores could be found in every large city. There was a superb collection of countless extremely rare and precious treasures in the Pavilion of Treasures. As long as one had the money, they could obtain any rare treasures from there.The seven stories high Pavilion of Treasures was grand and magnificent. Ye Qingtang had gone in once in her previous life but did not manage to buy anything due to the extremely hefty price tags. However, this time\u2026A smile tugged at her lips as she entered the Pavilion of Treasures.Although it was still early in the morning, there was already quite a few customers. The waiting staff in gray shirts shuffled through the crowd with dazzling treasures in their hands.Walking past the shelves that stored gemstones, Ye Qingtang walked to the front of a small counter where a few fingernail-sized stones were placed on the counter. Though weirdly colored, the gems shone lustrously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its white body with speckles of pink was undoubtedly beautiful.\u201cFlower Moon Stone\u2026\u201d Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes.The Flower Moon Stone was a gemstone which contained an extensive amount of spirit energy and, thus, was extremely precious. Just by wearing this gemstone on their body, cultivators can speed up their cultivation process. It also had the effect of allowing females to enjoy eternal youth.Just as Ye Qingtang was looking at that Flower Moon Stone, a few tall figures suddenly came up to a side and slapped a hand on the counter.\u201cNever would have I thought that the Pavilion of Treasures really carried the Flower Moon Stone,\u201d commented a tall and handsome young man as he pointed towards that gemstone.Upon hearing that voice, Ye Qingtang lifted her head, and a cold light flashed across her eyes once she saw who that man was clearly.\u201cSo, it is the Young Lady of the Ye family. Or should I call you ex-future sister-in-law?\u201d The young man noted sarcastically when he noticed Ye Qingtang.\u201cDuan Tianrui,\u201d said Ye Qingtang calmly as she looked back at the man who was harboring evil thoughts.Duan Tianrui was the Third Young Master of the Duan family and Duan Tianrao\u2019s younger brother.The Duan family would most probably have known about Duan Tianrao\u2019s visit to the Ye family to annul the engagement two days ago, which was why Duan Tianrui was this sarcastic.\u201cWhy? You\u2019ve also taken a fancy to this Flower Moon Stone?\u201d Duan Tianrui looked at Ye Qingtang from head to toe as a mysterious smile played on the corner of his lips. \u201cNot that bad of a taste. The Flower Moon Stone is hard to find, and it\u2019s rare for a piece to appear.\u201dDuan Tianrui paused for a moment and continued, \u201cHowever, as a member of the Ye family, don\u2019t you think that such a rare item should be given to someone who is truly compatible with the stone?\u201dYe Qingtang chuckled. \u201cWho do you think is compatible?\u201dSmiling, Duan Tianrui replied, \u201cCompatible with whom? It is naturally my new future sister-in-law. The Young Lady of the Ye family is probably still unaware, but two days later at the Sacrificial Ceremony, my second brother will publicly announce the annulment of his engagement to you and will even reveal his new fianc\u00e9e. My new sister-in-law said she wanted the Flower Moon Stone, so it would be wise for Lady Ye to not come into this.\u201dOthers may not know the identity of the new future sister-in-law whom Duan Tianrui was talking about, but how would Ye Qingtang not know?Was it not just Ye Xun?Ye Qingtang was initially not too concerned about obtaining this Flower Moon Stone. However, since it was what Ye Xun wanted, she did not mind blocking her way.\u201cOh? Really?\u201d Ye Qingtang laughed lightly, \u201cBut I really like this Flower Moon Stone.\u201dDuan Tianrui narrowed his eyes slightly as a hint of annoyance flashed across his eyes. \u201cLady Ye, the Flower Moon Stone can ensure one\u2019s eternal youth and would naturally be most suitable for beautiful ladies. Someone like Lady Ye\u2026\u201dHis glanced across the veil that Ye Qingtang was wearing on her face and continued. \u201cIt would be better to not recklessly waste such a precious object.\u201dThe sarcasm was obvious in his words. Although Duan Tianrui did not say it explicitly, he implied that Ye Qingtang was ugly.She raised her brows and asked, \u201cWhat if I must have it?\u201dDuan Tianrui\u2019s face darkened. \u201cLady Ye, the Ye and Duan family have some relations. Now that your spirit root is broken, you will not be able to use the Flower Moon Stone to aid your cultivation. It is clear that you have no need for this. Are you sure you want to snatch this from me?\u201dYe Qingtang wanted to laugh.\u201cDuan Tianrui, if you really want to buy this Flower Moon Stone as a gift to Ye Xun, let\u2019s talk with our abilities.\u201dA sneer escaped Duan Tianrui\u2019s mouth. He immediately waved his hands to call the waiting staff over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In this world, it would be difficult to find a piece with better quality than this.\u201dDuan Tianrui was very satisfied as he looked at that gemstone, and after admiring it, he eyed Ye Qingtang.\u201cHow much does this Flower Moon Stone cost?\u201dThe waiting staff replied, \u201cThis Flower Moon Stone is selling at 30,000 gold.\u201dThe waiting staff reported the price loudly and the hefty \u201c30,000 gold\u201d instantly attracted the attention of the other customers in the Pavilion of Treasures.A Flower Moon Stone that was about the size of a soybean actually cost 30,000 gold!30,000 gold was not an amount that ordinary people were able to earn in their entire lifetime.Even a child from a large family clan may find it difficult to fork out such a huge sum of money.\u201c30,000 gold\u2026 Lady Ye, do you still want it?\u201d Duan Tianrui looked at Ye Qingtang. He had long known that Great Elder of the Ye family had taken over the family master Ye Ling\u2019s power and that Ye Qingtang\u2019s position as Young Lady of the family was an empty and powerless one. The Ye family was then controlled by Ye You\u2019s grandfather, the Great Elder, so there was no way Ye Qingtang could to fork out such a huge amount of money.Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes as a cold light flashed in them.Many surrounding customers watched the two people, one from the Duan family and the other from the Ye family, fighting over a Flower Moon Stone. However, once they saw that the person from the Ye family was Ye Qingtang, they could not help but quietly shake their heads.Although Duan Tianrao\u2019s annulment of engagement was not put into effect yet, the rumors had already been circulated throughout Lin town. Now that the Third Young Master of the Duan family was fighting with Ye Qingtang in public, the rumor must more or less be verified.There were many rumors of the Ye family within Lin Town, and everyone had heard that Young Lady Ye was not as noble as before.How was she going to fight with Duan Tianrui?A servant following his master, who was picking a jade at a corner, heard the commotion and was shocked when he looked in the direction of the noise. He hurriedly turned towards his master and said,\u201cThird Young Master, it is Lady Ye!Si Bai placed the white jade in his hands back onto the counter and turned to look in the direction that his servant was pointing at, where he saw a tiny figure in the crowd.\u201cYe Qingtang?\u201d\u201cThird Young Master, Lady Ye seems to have gotten into a conflict with the Duan family. Should we go and take a look?\u201d asked the servant concernedly.Si Bai was not anxious to reply and watched the young girl who was standing alone from afar. Glancing at the trace of a smile in her eyes, he immediately laughed and shook his head. \u201cThere is no need, she has a way.\u201dHow familiar that smile was. When Ye Qingtang was dealing with his grandfather at the Si family, she had the same look of full confidence.However, Si Bai did not look away; he was curious about how Ye Qingtang was going to resolve this conflict.On the other side, Duan Tianrui played with the Flower Moon Stone in his hands as he evilly admired Ye Qingtang\u2019s embarrassment.Duan Tianrui had long been dissatisfied with the engagement between Ye Qingtang and Duan Tianrao. How could his handsome and talented brother marry such an ugly woman? Good thing that the engagement was canceled, severing any relations the Duan family had with her. Now, Duan Tianrui would not need to be polite to Ye Qingtang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead, she wore a smile and looked towards the waiting staff. \u201cCall your manager here.\u201dThe waiting staff was slightly taken aback. \u201cIf there is anything, you can tell me\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you want the Lythrum, call someone of power here.\u201d Ye Qingtang\u2019s eyes turned cold.Her glare made the waiting staff feel numb all over suddenly. However, the word \u201cLythrum\u201d ran through his mind like a flash of shocking lightning!Duan Tianrui did not know what Ye Qingtang had up her sleeves and only felt that she was inviting humiliation. Looking at the waiting staff, he said, \u201cGo ahead and look all you want, I\u2026\u201dBefore Duan Tianrui could finish his sentence, the waiting staff had left frantically to search for someone.Just a moment later, a middle-aged man nearing fifty rushed back along with the waiting staff.\u201cAre you Lady Ye? I am the manager of Lin Town\u2019s Pavilion of Treasures.\u201d The middle-aged man looked towards Ye Qingtang and continued. \u201cI heard that Lady Ye mentioned the Lythrum just now, I wonder\u2026 if Lady Ye knows anything about it?\u201dHis tone was stable, yet anxiety filled his eyes.The Lythrum was an item that the Pavilion of Treasures\u2019 pavilion master desired. He had looked all over the world and placed a notice in every branch of the Pavilion of Treasures of a 100,000 gold reward for finding it yet had no clue up until today.\u201cI know the place that has the Lythrum,\u201d Ye Qingtang said.A sneer emerged on Duan Tianrao\u2019s face upon hearing her words.Ye Qingtang was only fifteen and had never left the city of Lin town up to this day. How would she know where the Lythrum was?The manager\u2019s eyes glistened. \u201cLady Ye, as long as you provide us with the location of the Lythrum, the Pavilion of Treasures will definitely express our gratitude with hefty rewards.\u201dYe Qingtang replied, \u201cThe Lythrum is at the Dead Leaves Forest outside Lin Town.\u201dAt this instant, Duan Tianrui was really about to laugh.The Dead Leaves Forest was close to Lin town. Although there were quite a few medicinal herbs, they were all common ones. Amongst all the precious medicinal herbs, the Lythrum was extremely hard to find. Ye Qingtang must have been crazy to recklessly make up a lie that the Lythrum was in the Dead Leaves Forest.Not a single person would believe her words.The Pavilion of Treasures\u2019 manager did not think that Ye Qingtang would actually mention the Dead Leaves Forest. The excitement in his eyes vanished as though a flame was extinguished by a bucket of ice water, and his expression hardened.\u201cLady Ye, please do not joke around. How would the Dead Leaves Forest have Lythrum?\u201d\u201cWhat if there really is?\u201d Ye Qingtang continued, \u201cHave someone prepare a pen and some ink. I will draw out the exact location of the Lythrum.\u201dInitially, the manager had thought that she was unreliable. However upon seeing her calmness, he could not help but frown. After hesitating for a while, he asked someone to prepare a pen and some ink.Ye Qingtang drew a simple drawing quickly and indicated on the picture the location of the Lythrum.The manager passed the drawing to his henchman doubtfully.After seeing a staff leaving the Pavilion of Treasures with the drawing, everyone was curious.No one knew where Ye Qingtang\u2019s confidence came from.Despite the fact that Ye Qintang was rumored as an unreliable person, the manager still had a tiny glimmer of hope. Having heard from the waiting staff that Ye Qingtang and Duan Tianrui were fighting over the Flower Moon Stone, the manager told Duan Tianrui, \u201cYoung Master Duan, I hope you can wait a while for this issue to settle.\u201dDuan Tianrui laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not in a rush. I, as well, hope that the Pavilion of Treasures can obtain the Lythrum.\u201d Then, he looked at Ye Qingtang sneeringly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is the Lythrum really in the Dead Leaves Forest?\u201d The servant from the Si family asked Si Bai after he noticed there was no further movement on the other side.Si Bai reclined to a side with his fingers stroking the white jade in his hands. Laying his eyes on Ye Qingtang, a smile tugged on his lips, and he said coolly, \u201cWho knows?\u201dThe servant became even more confused. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t Lady Ye be ridiculed publicly? Third Young Master, do you really not intend to\u2026 Ouch!\u201dA dejected expression was etched on the servant\u2019s face as he covered his forehead, which had just been flicked by Si Bai.Si Bai chuckled. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to worry about her. Just set your mind at ease and watch on.\u201dThe servant rubbed his forehead and could not understand what was going on anymore.Time passed. The manager ordered tea to be served for Ye Qingtang and Duan Tianrui to enjoy.The servants from the Duan family who came along with Duan Tianrui stood beside Duan Tianrui and glanced at Ye Qingtang from time to time.\u201cThird Young Master, Lady Ye is crazy. Why you are still playing along with her?!\u201dDuan Tianrao looked up and cast Ye Qingtang a glance with an obvious curl tugging at the corner of his lips.\u201cIf she wished to embarrass herself, why shouldn\u2019t I fulfill her wish?\u201dAs he finished his sentence, Duan Tianrui looked at the entrance of the Pavilion of Treasures to see the man who had been sent to find the Lythrum rushing back hurriedly with a body covered in dust. Duan Tianrui smiled widely and placed his cup down.\u201cAn interesting show is about to start\u2026\u201dMany customers stayed in the Pavilion of Treasure to watch the development of events. Both the Ye and Duan family are top family clans in Lin town; obviously, they did not want to miss such an exciting show.When the man came back, he was covered in dust and carrying something in his arms very carefully as if it was something precious.\u201cHow did it go?\u201d the manager asked him immediately.Panting, he could not hide his excitement and nodded his head continuously. \u201cI found it! However, it was hidden in the hole of a dead tree. If not for Lady Ye\u2019s drawing, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to find it.\u201dWith that said, gasps sounded in the Pavilion of Treasures immediately.The Lythrum was really found!How could this be?Everyone had a look of confusion on their faces.The man carefully removed a beautiful box which was covered with soil from his hands and passed it to the manager, who opened the box hurriedly only. In it quietly rested an emerald Lythrum covered with dew drops.In that instant\u2026The manager heaved a heavy sigh of relief!\u201cLady Ye, thank you\u2026 I must really thank you this time.\u201d the manager looked Ye Qingtang with a wide smile on his face as he held the Lythrum carefully.God knows how many years the owner of the pavilion had spent looking for this Lythrum!If not for Ye Qingtang\u2019s directions, who would have known that such a precious Lythrum was actually growing in the hole of a dead tree!Ye Qingtang smiled faintly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dLythrum was indeed hard to find now, but that was only because people had thought wrongly the place where Lythrum grew in. Decades later, the existence of Lythrum would no longer be a rare one. In her previous life when the Great Elder sent people to kill her, she once escaped to the Dead Leaves Forest and saw this stalk of Lythrum incidentally. Of course, she remembered its position clearly.No one else would know all of this.With the finding of the Lythrum, Duan Tianrui, who had been anticipating Ye Qingtang to embarrass herself completely, wore an extremely ugly and dark expression.In a while, the manager ordered for the reward of 100,000 gold to be carried out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead, her narrowed eyes were set directly on the gloomy looking Duan Tianrui, whose expression turned darker with every gold brick placed down.\u201c30,000 gold bricks. I am taking this Flower Moon Stone,\u201d said Ye Qingtang with her lips curled as she placed down the last brick of gold.Duan Tianrui was furious. He did not expect that Ye Qingtang had this up her sleeve.Indeed, she did not have enough money. But, so what?Not only did she not have to pay any money, she even received three boxes of gold from the Pavilion of Treasures!While Duan Tianrui was grim, he was so pissed by Ye Qingtang\u2019s arrogance to the point that his breathing turned erratic.\u201cYoung Master Duan, I\u2019m really sorry. The Pavilion of Treasures has always had a first-come-first-serve rule. Thus, this Flower Moon Stone\u2026\u201d the manager said tactfully as he walked straight towards Duan Tianrui with his eyes on the Flower Moon Stone in Duan Tianrui\u2019s hands. After obtaining the Lythrum, the manager obviously would be on Ye Qingtang\u2019s side.Duan Tianrui silently gritted his teeth and returned the Flower Moon Stone which he initially thought would be claimed by him back to the manager.The manager then handed the Flower Moon Stone to Ye Qingtang in front of Duan Tianrui and said, \u201cLady Ye, this Flower Moon Stone is yours.\u201dRaising her brows and looking at the Flower Moon Stone about the size of a soybean, she looked up and cast Duan Tianrui a glance.Her glance almost made Duan Tianrui\u2019s lungs explode from holding his anger back.He originally wanted to watch Ye Qingtang embarrass herself, yet it turned out that he was the one to be embarrassed!\u201cCongratulations, Lady Ye, for obtaining what you wanted. I still have something to do and will take a leave first,\u201d Duan Tianrui forced his words while gritting his teeth and left with his people without turning back.No one had expected the incident to end this way, and everyone could not help but sigh.After seeing Duan Tianrui leave in anger because of Ye Qingtang, Si Bai, who had been watching from a side, chuckled lightly as he looked away and continued to pick a jade.\u201cLady Ye, feel free to choose whatever you want. I will go ahead and process the Lythrum first,\u201d the manager told Ye Qingtang with a smile.Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. The Flower Moon Stone was an unexpected joy; she had more important things to find.The manager left the hall on the first floor and headed towards the highest floor.The door to the elegant room on the highest floor was locked tightly. Arranging his clothes, the manager knocked on the door respectfully.\u201cPavilion master, it\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201dThe manager pushed the door open and entered.In the room, an attractive looking Mu Su was sitting at a table. Once the manager saw Mu Su, he immediately went on his knees and respectfully handed him the beautiful box that contained the Lythrum.\u201cReporting pavilion master, the Lythrum has been found.\u201dMu Su lifted his brows slightly and received the box. After seeing the Lythrum, his lips tugged upwards involuntarily.No one would have expected that the mysterious owner of the Pavilion of Treasures was actually Mu Su, the renowned City Lord of Fallen Stars City.\u201cQuite a long time was spent, but at least it is finally found. You settled this issue pretty well,\u201d Mu Su said satisfactorily as he placed the box down.The manager knelt at the spot respectfully and replied, \u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201dMu Su suddenly arrived at Lin town yesterday night. The manager, who had always been fearful of Mu Su, was shocked when he saw him. Good thing the Lythrum was found today, or else he would really not dare to come here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Master Si was one of the few who knew about Mu Su\u2019s identity as the pavilion master of the Pavilion of Treasures.Mu Su opened the letter, and his expression turned increasingly weird as he read on.\u201cYe Qingtang from the Ye family wants to see me?\u201d With a face of surprise, he instinctively glanced at the inner chamber in the elegant room.The man sitting inside the inner chamber frowned slightly.The manager noticed Mu Su\u2019s gaze but did not have the nerves to look towards the inner chamber and further lowered his head instead.Mu Su came along with another person yesterday night, and towards this person, even a person of high status like Mu Su had to be very respectful.The manager could not help but recall that his master was loyal to the Antiquity Palace\u2026 Could it be that that person was the rumored God himself\u2026 As he thought about it, the manager did not dare to speculate any further and watched his own words and actions.After hesitating for a moment, Mu Su asked, \u201cWhat is Ye Qingtang\u2019s relation to the Ye family?\u201dWhen he went to see the young lady of the Ye family with His Highness, he still did not know the girl\u2019s name and whether she was the said Ye Qingtang.The manager replied hurriedly, \u201cYe Qingtang is the Young Lady of the Ye family and the next successor of the Ye family.\u201d\u201cOther than Ye Qingtang, how many ladies are on the Ye residence now?\u201d Mu Su asked.\u201cThe Ye family has three daughters in total. One of them is family Master Ye\u2019s daughter, Ye Qingtang. Another is the Great Elder\u2019s granddaughter, Ye You. The last girl is an orphan whom the family master adopted, Ye Xun. Ye You left for Yunxiao Sect not long ago while Ye Xun usually resides in the manor outside the Ye family on normal days. Ye Qingtang should be the only lady of the Ye family on the residence now,\u201d the manager replied honestly.\u201cIt really is her?\u201d Mu Su\u2019s eyes widened slightly.The manager added on, \u201cActually, we could only find this Lythrum after Ye Qingtang provided us with its location. Lady Ye is currently still in the Pavilion of Treasures.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d At this point, Mu Su really wanted to laugh.He suffered an internal injury in his early years and needed the Lythrum for treatment. After waiting for so many years, it was actually found with the help of the girl whom His Highness was searching for.\u201cSince she is a customer of my Pavilion of Treasures and she even helped me to find the Lythrum, I need to thank her well. From now on, whenever Ye Qingtang comes to my Pavilion of Treasures, all items will be sold at twenty percent discount to her,\u201d Mu Su said generously and peeked at the inner chamber.\u201cNoted,\u201d the manager nodded his head as he noted to himself in surprise that the twenty percent discount which Mu Su said was not only applicable to the store in Lin Town but all the Pavilion of Treasures branches over the world.God knows how many extremely pricey treasures there were in the Pavilion of Treasures. She could save a shocking amount with this discount!After hearing Mu Su\u2019s orders, the manager exited the elegant room quietly.After the manager had finally left, the man in the inner chamber came out.The moment Mu Su saw the man, he immediately stood up and knelt on the floor with one leg.\u201cYour Highness!\u201dThere was no hint of emotion on Han Cangming\u2019s gorgeous face. As his deep set of eyes looked over at the letter from the Si family, a deep voice sounded.\u201cAgree to her request.\u201d\u201cNoted! I will notify the Si family now.\u201dHan Cangming was the boss, and Mu Su was to fulfill whatever he said.Using his feet to think, Mu Su also predicted that his highness would want him to agree to the request. However, he did not know why Ye Qintang wanted to meet him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since Ye Qingtang helped the Pavilion to find the Lythrum and even got a mouth-watering discount, she would not hold herself back.The manager, who received Mu Su\u2019s orders, was personally accompanying Ye Qingtang to take her pick. He had originally thought that Ye Qingtang would take this opportunity to choose a few valuable treasures, yet Ye Qingtang actually stopped in front of a counter nobody cared about.\u201cIs this the Floating Pagoda?\u201d Ye Qingtang asked while pointing at the emerald object, which was about the size of a cobblestone, displayed in the counter.Looking in the direction, the manager nodded his head.The Floating Pagoda was produced from a rank 5 spirit animal of which had an extremely strong combat power and needed a few hundred people to take it down successfully. However, the Floating Pagoda itself was of little value.Its hardness was such that it was difficult for weapons to cause it any damage. Furthermore, due to the difficulty in killing a rank 5 spirit animal, the Floating Pagoda had a hefty price tag. Up to this day, no one knew what the Floating Pagoda could be used for, and, thus, it was used as a decoration even though it was not as dazzling as gemstones. Other than a few family clans who would buy a few of this only to boast their wealth, nearly no one cared about the Floating Pagoda.Yet, Ye Qingtang was deeply attracted to those few Floating Pagodas.This item may be useless to others, but to her, it was extremely useful!\u201cHow many Floating Pagodas do you have here?\u201d asked Ye Qingtang.The manager did not understand why Ye Qingtang was interested in the total number of Floating Pagodas and dismissed it as an act of her curiosity. \u201cThere are more than ten of them in stock.\u201dThis item was extremely hard to sell. The Pavilion of Treasures barely sold one every year and, thus, had large stocks of them.Touching her chin, she said with a glint of happiness in her eyes, \u201cI want them all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The manager\u2019s eyes almost popped out.She wants all of them?\u201cLady Ye, each one of these Floating Pagodas would cost 1000 gold. Are you sure about this?\u201dYe Qingtang nodded.\u201c\u2026\u201d A look of confusion was etched on the manager\u2019s face.He had thought that after obtaining a twenty percent discount, Ye Qingtang would buy some valuable things back. Yet, who would have thought that this Young Lady wanted nothing but the Floating Pagoda, which was no different from a stone!All of these Floating Pagodas would cost over 10,000 gold!Buying a pile of useless rocks was simply a bloody loss!Before the manager was able to persuade her, Ye Qingtang placed 10 gold bricks on the counter. Now, he could not even utter a word.Helpless, the manager could only force himself to order people to bring out all the Floating Pagodas in the Pavilion of Treasures.A total of seventeen Floating Pagodas amounted to 17,000 gold, and with Ye Qingtang\u2019s discount, it would cost 13,600 gold in total. Perhaps the manager thought the Floating Pagodas did her dirty, he generously rounded down the price to 13,000 gold.Even so, he still felt he was doing Ye Qingtang dirty.However, Ye Qingtang was full of smiles upon receiving the Floating Pagodas.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Floating Pagoda was one of the few treasures in the world that could nourish the spirit root. While its current price of 1000 gold was expensive, the price shot up so rapidly upon the circulation of the news such that one Floating Pagoda was very difficult to be bought even with 10,000 gold.Hence, how was it a bloody loss to Ye Qingtang? She more than profited!\u201cI\u2019ll trouble you to let me purchase all the Floating Pagodas if there are any in the other branches of the Pavilion of Treasures,\u201d Ye Qingtang said with a smile. The Pavilion of Treasures had stores all over the world, and if she could work with all of them, she would not need to worry about the supply of the Floating Pagodas.However, the manager looked incredulous.Is Young Lady Ye crazy?The manager did not dare to agree straight up and merely said he would consider while he made a mental note of Ye Qingtang\u2019s obsession towards the Floating Pagoda. Seeing as to how she bought such huge amounts, could it be that the Floating Pagoda had other benefits?Ye Qingtang was not in a hurry as well. Ten Floating Pagodas were enough for her to use for a while.Other than accumulating the Floating Pagodas, Ye Qingtang also purchased a scale of the Fiery Sunset Beast.The Fiery Sunset Beast was an extremely fierce spirit animal active in places covered with magma, and its scales were especially resistant against fire. However, due to the unparalleled large size and shockingly heavy weight of the scales, it was very difficult to build an armor out of it. Hence, only a few people would buy it.The manager trembled upon seeing Ye Qingtang\u2019s consecutive purchase of two invaluable items. He really could not figure out why she liked to only pick junk!To store the huge Fiery Sunset Beast\u2019s scales, Ye Qingtang also bought a space ring from the Pavilion of Treasures and stored everything she bought in it.Mu Su, who was observing her from a dark place with Han Cangming, was perplexed as he watched Ye Qingtang\u2019s face full of happiness after buying a pile of junk.\u201cYour Highness, uh\u2026 Lady Ye\u2019s taste is really special\u2026\u201d Mu Su\u2019s lips twitched a little as he carefully took a look at Han Cangming.He did not purposely do Ye Qingtang dirty with all those junk; it was Ye Qingtang who bought them herself! He should not be blamed for this.Han Cangming did not respond to Mu Su\u2019s attempt to prove his innocence and merely looked at Ye Qingtang meaningfully.Ye Qingtang, who had used her rebirth to her advantage to obtain a heap of treasures, was deeply satisfied. After looking around the Pavilion of Treasures, she did not see anything she needed and was ready to leave. Just as she walked to the door of the pavilion, she suddenly saw Si Bai and his servant, who were about to leave as well.It just so happened that Ye Qingtang was preparing to visit the Si family to check the condition Si Bai\u2019s body. Now that they have bumped into each other, it was convenient as they left the Pavilion of Treasures and headed towards the Si residence together.\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Su silently watched Ye Qingtang and the good-looking young man talking and laughing as they left. He turned around to look at His Highness\u2026Han Cangming was expressionless.Mu Su secretly pulled a long face. Your Highness, you should watch out!He mentally decided that he must find an opportunity to bring Ye Qingtang to his highness the next time he sees Ye Qingtang.If you want to have a baby, shouldn\u2019t you take some action?\u2026\u201cI saw you buying quite a few Floating Pagodas and the scales of the Fiery Sunset Beast just now?\u201d Si Bai asked Ye Qingtang along the way to the Si residence. He was quite curious about Ye Qingtang\u2019s stance when she was buying large quantities of the items in the Pavilion of Treasures.Si Bai had heard of the Floating Pagoda and scales of the Fiery Sunset Beast but really did not know what was so special about them.\u201cYes,\u201d Ye Qingtang replied with no intention of hiding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, they only discovered it after many years. Ye Qingtang bought them in large quantities. People at the side were all very confused as they could not figure out why Ye Qintang bought such useless items.\u201cYour preferences are really\u2026 quite interesting.\u201d Si Bai chuckled but did not plan to ask for a reason.Soon, they arrived outside the door of the Si family. Just as they just stepped inside, Si Bai felt the atmosphere was not quite right.Ye Qingtang heard some noises before she arrived at the hall.\u201cGrandfather, second junior brother\u2019s condition is very serious. I shall talk to the Duan family for the Flame-repellent Pills.\u201d A deep male voice could be heard from the hall of the Si family.\u201cMaster Physician Xu is treating your brother now. It\u2019ll be very difficult to ask the Duan family to hand over the Flame-repellent Pills. Though we seem to be in good terms with the Duan family, many things have happened secretly. Even if you go over, they\u2019ll not give the pills to you.\u201d Master of the Si family clan then spoke. His voice sounded hopeless.Si Bai exchanged a glance with Ye Qingtang. They then rushed into the hall.Besides the master of the Ye family clan, there was another handsome and tall young man in the hall. The young man and Si Bai looked alike, but he appeared to be more stable and full of spirit.\u201cElder brother?\u201d Si Bai was stunned as he saw the young man.That young man was the Eldest Young Master of the Si family and Si Bai\u2019s elder brother, Si Ye.\u201cYou\u2019re back, Third Brother,\u201d Si Ye nodded slightly as he saw Si Bai.\u201cHow come you\u2019re back, brother? Just now, I heard you mentioning second brother\u2026 What happened to him?\u201d Si Bai spoke in a serious tone.The Si family only had the three brothers in the younger generation. Si Bai had been physically weak ever since he was young. The eldest brother Si Ye and the second eldest brother Si Qiong treated him with care all the time. The three brothers were in good relationships with each other. They were so close that nothing could separate them.Si Ye suddenly became very serious when Si Bai mentioned the second brother Si Qiong. He did not reply to Si Bai immediately but instead looked towards Master Si.Master Si sighed softly. \u201cYour brother was attacked by the fire beast and is suffering from the flame toxin. Master Physician Xu is trying to treat him now.\u201dSi Bai was astonished.The flame toxin of the fire beast was very deadly. It would burn all the internal organs and could not be suppressed by any medicine. Anyone who suffered from the flame toxin had to bear with the internal burning until the end of their lives.The only way to neutralize the flame toxin was to take medicine made from the ice lotus located on the peaks of Yucang Mountain.Yucang Mountain was worlds apart from the Lin town. It would take at least a month to reach there and come back. Si Qiong would not be able to survive until then if the flame toxin circulated quickly.\u201cI have already sent people to obtain the ice lotus from Yucang Mountain. Now, I need to go to the Duan family to ask for their Flame-repellent Pills,\u201d Si Ye said and frowned.The Flame-repellent Pills could suppress the spread of the flame toxin for a period of time. Only if the Flame-repellent Pills stabilized the flame toxin in Si Qiong, there would be sufficient time to bring back the ice lotus.\u201cBrother, the Flame-repellent Pill is the hereditary treasure of the Duan family. Even if you go over to the Duan family, I\u2019m afraid that they would not give it to you.\u201d Si Bai\u2019s face was pale but dignified.Si Ye frowned. Of course, he knew about that. However\u2026 without the Flame-repellent Pills, Si Qiong might be in danger\u2026\u201cI can help to suppress the flame toxin.\u201dWhile everyone of the Si family was upset, a clear female voice could be heard.Si Ye looked towards the direction the sound came from and noticed a young lady standing beside Si Bai.\u201cMay I know who is this lady?\u201d Si Ye asked.\u201cThis is Ye Qingtang, the Young Lady of the Ye family.\u201d Si Bai replied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He abhorred the Ye family who murdered his mother.\u201cWe do not welcome people from the Ye family here,\u201d Si Ye said in a deep voice.Si Bai was about to explain, but Master Si who sat on the chair said, \u201cSi Ye, do not be rude to our guest. Ye Qingtang is here to treat your third brother.\u201dSi Ye was shocked. His eyesight gazed towards the skinny figure again.\u201cHow could she treat my brother? She is so young.\u201dMaster Si frowned. Actually, when he first saw Ye Qingtang, he also did not expect that she could really treat Si Bai.\u201cYou do not need to ask about this. Now, what is important is the flame toxin in Si Qiong.\u201d Master Si then turned and looked towards Ye Qingtang.\u201cLady Ye, you said that you have a way to suppress the flame toxin?\u201dMaster Si\u2019s words made Si Ye frowned again. He could not understand why his grandfather, who always hated the Ye family, would now allow the Young Lady of the Ye family to treat his brother and enter the Si family freely.Ye Qingtang nodded and said, \u201cI just got something that could possibly treat the flame toxin.\u201d\u201cIs it the scale of the Fiery Sunset Beast?\u201d Si Bai immediately recalled the scale of the Fiery Sunset Beast Ye Qingtang bought from the Treasure Pavilion.\u201cYes,\u201d Ye Qingtang said.Everyone\u2019s face changed when Ye Qingtang finished her words.Si Ye frowned heavily, trying to control his discontentment. \u201cLady Ye, I don\u2019t know how you managed to convince my grandfather to allow you to treat my brother. However, I am afraid it\u2019s impossible to suppress the flame toxin with only the scale of the Fiery Sunset Beast\u201dThe scales of the Fiery Sunset Beast had very high heat resistance, but it was useless to people who suffered from the flame toxin. Unless one could crush it into powder and use it as medicine, it would be impossible for the scales to suppress the flame toxin in one\u2019s body.The scales of the Fiery Sunset Beast were extremely hard. Almost no one in the world could break it. It would be totally impossible to crush it into powder.Si Ye words represented the opinion of the Si family. Even Master Si showed a trace of doubt on his face.Ye Qingtang scanned through the Si family and smiled in her heart.\u201cSince there is no other option, how will it matter to just let me try?\u201dSi Ye frowned.Master Si took a deep breath and said, \u201cWe shall give Lady Ye a chance to try.\u201d\u201cGrandfather!\u201d Si Ye disagreed strongly.\u201cBrother, Lady Ye\u2019s words make sense. Besides the Flame-repellent Pills from the Duan family, we don\u2019t have any other way to suppress the flame toxin in second brother\u2019s body. We should try all possible ways to treat him.\u201d Si Bai also tried to convince him.Si Ye\u2019s expression was not very pleasant. He turned and looked towards Ye Qingtang with a complex sight.\u201cWe shall rely on you now, girl.\u201d Master Si felt constrained.Ye Qingtang nodded and said, \u201cPlease prepare an individual room for me. I need to make some preparations first.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Master Si asked the servants to prepare a room immediately.Ye Qingtang entered the room alone and locked the door.Si Ye stood outside the room with Si Bai. He stared at the locked door and frowned. \u201cBrother, this is full of nonsense.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You see, aren\u2019t I much healthier than before?\u201dSi Ye examined Si Bai. Si Bai\u2019s face was still a bit pale, but his breath was more stable.\u201cI heard from grandfather that Ye Qingtang wrote two pieces of prescription for you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSi Ye sneered.This only meant that Ye Qingtang had the prescription for Si Bai\u2019s sickness and did not prove that she had substantial medical skills.Si Bai could observe his elder brother\u2019s deep hatred towards the Ye family and decided to keep quiet.The two of them stared at the room for a while and did not notice any sound coming out of the room. They then turned and walked towards Si Qiong\u2019s room.Si Ye was around when Si Qiong was attacked by the fire beast. He witnessed how his brother was hurt with his own eyes, and no one could understand how upset and regretful he was.\u201cMaster Physician Xu, how\u2019s my brother now? How much longer does he have?\u201d Si Ye was extremely anxious as he stared at his brother whose face was extremely red as a result of the burning of the flame toxin.Master Physician Xu\u2019s face was not pleasant as well. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to you. He has at most three days. If we still cannot find any way to suppress the flame toxin, then\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that he will not able to live any longer.\u201dMaster Physician Xu\u2019s words weighed like a heavy stone on the two brothers\u2019 hearts.\u201cMaster Physician Xu, is there any way to use the scale of the Fiery Sunset Beast as medicine?\u201d Si Bai said.Master Physician Xu smiled wryly at him and said, \u201cThe scales of the fire beast can suppress the flame toxin. However, I have never heard about anyone who was actually able to use that as medicine. It\u2019s extremely difficult to use the scale, which is harder than a rock.\u201dSi Ye glanced towards Si Bai after hearing his words.Si Bai understood what his brother meant, but he did not plan to say anything. He was not sure whether Ye Qingtang could achieve that as well.\u201cWhy do you ask about that, Third Young Master?\u201d Master Physician Xu said.Si Bai was about to explain, but Si Ye, who could not control his discontent anymore, said coldly, \u201cThe Young Lady of the Ye family just now said that she could use the scales of the fire beast to suppress the flame toxin in my brother\u2019s body.\u201dMaster Physician Xu was stunned after hearing his words. While Si Ye thought that Master Physician Xu would criticize Ye Qingtang, Master Physician Xu suddenly sighed in relief.\u201cIf it\u2019s Lady Ye, I think it is possible.\u201d Master Physician Xu\u2019s words revealed his high opinion of Ye Qingtang.\u201c\u2026\u201dSi Ye did not expect that even a professional physician like Master Physician Xu would approve with what Ye Qingtang was about to do.Si Bai could only sigh as he saw that things did not go as his brother had wished.Ye Qingtang came to the Si family quite often these few days. She had multiple discussions with Master Physician Xu on medicine skills. Master Physician Xu had shown his admiration towards Ye Qingtang all the time.When everyone was still waiting, Ye Qingtang finally appeared in Si Qiong\u2019s room with a small porcelain bottle.\u201cLady Ye.\u201d Master Physician Xu greeted Ye Qingtang once he saw her.Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and ignored the sharp stare from Si Ye. She looked towards Si Qiong on the bed.Si Qiong was suffering from the flame toxin and bearing with the heat around his whole body. He had gone into a coma due to the high heat.\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d Ye Qingtang stepped forward and asked.Master Physician Xu shook his head slightly to show that the situation was not very optimistic.Ye Qingtang checked out Si Qiong\u2019s condition. The layers of bandages on his left chest was soaked with blood. Ye Qingtang took a glance and rolled her sleeves up.\u201cMaster Physician Xu, help me remove the bandages on his chest,\u201d Ye Qingtang asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What do you want to do to remove the bandages now?!\u201d Si Ye shouted coldly.Ye Qingtang raised her eyes, and they met the beast-like eyes of Si Ye. She smiled slightly and said, \u201cYou can drag on longer if you want your brother to continue to suffer from the flame toxin.\u201dSi Ye frowned and appeared to be very fierce.\u201cYoung Master, Lady Ye is very skilled. If she wants to do something, she must have full confidence in her herself. How about we just let her try?\u201d Master Physician Xu helped to explain.\u201cIt should be you who gives a try, Master Physician Xu. I cannot put any faith in her. She is still too young,\u201d Si Ye said staring at Ye Qingtang.He was not convinced by her age, and furthermore, she was from the Ye family. He would never trust anyone from the Ye family.Si Bai felt a slight headache. His brother\u2019s temper was exactly the same as his grandfather\u2019s. Both of them were extremely stubborn.Si Bai decided to convince his brother to leave.However, at that moment, Ye Qingtang suddenly flipped her hand. Her long and elegant fingers rotated to the top and gripped Si Ye\u2019s arm straight away, leaving no time for Si Ye to react. She then kicked Si Ye at the area below his arm.Si Ye did not expect that the young lady in front of him would attack him. He could not even imagine that Ye Qingtang would be so fast and swift!Crack!Ye Qingtang\u2019s one kick dislocated Si Ye\u2019s arm\u2026\u201cI need to save your brother now. I don\u2019t have time to talk to you.\u201d Ye Qingtang then threw Si Ye out and said to Si Bai,\u201d Watch your brother for me!\u201dSi Bai was speechless, but he still rushed forward and held Si Ye from behind.\u201cBrother, you should let her try! I shall vouch for her!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dSi Ye felt the pain from his arm, but he was afraid that he would hurt Si Bai, so he just stared angrily at Ye Qingtang.He could not understand why his family would suddenly trust a person from the Ye family so much!Ye Qingtang tore away the bandages swiftly. The wound burnt by flames was very serious. Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes and took out a dagger from her waist. She then immediately made a cut on Si Qiong\u2019s chest with the dagger around the wound.Everyone in the room was shocked by the scene.Si Bai also did not imagine that Ye Qingtang would do that. His hands that were holding Si Ye relaxed.Si Ye instantly raged like a beast after he witnessed that his brother\u2019s chest was cut by Ye Qingtang. He literally wanted to rip her apart.However\u2026When Master Physician Xu saw Ye Qingtang pouring red powder onto Si Qiong\u2019s chest from a porcelain bottle, he immediately went forward and stopped Si Ye.\u201cYoung Master, Lady Ye is using the scale of the Fiery Sunset Beast to suppress the flame toxin. Do not worry!\u201d\u201cScale of the Fiery Sunset Beast?\u201d Si Ye was stunned when he heard that.\u201cIt was I who had too little knowledge. I can\u2019t imagine that Lady Ye really was able to crush the scale of the Fiery Sunset Beast into powder.\u201d Master Physician Xu said with great admiration. Ye Qingtang was indeed very young, but she always had something that could amaze him even as a Master Physician.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It would\u2019ve taken much longer if we used the powder as medicine. Now that she used the powder directly on the wound of the flame toxin, it would suppress the flame toxin straight away. This kind of method\u2026 I have never seen this before.\u201d Master Physician Xu expressed his amazement.Si Ye stared at Ye Qingtang. His eyes were puzzled and full of suspicion.After she poured the entire bottle of the powdered scale of the Fiery Sunset Beast, the burnt skin began recovering at an unbelievable speed. Si Qiong\u2019s body temperature was going back to normal, and his breath became more relaxed.It was as if a miracle was happening in front of Si Ye\u2019s eyes.Ye Qingtang withdrew her hands after pouring all the powder.She kept her porcelain bottle and said, \u201cThe powder can suppress the flame toxin for the time being. However, if you want to neutralize the flame toxin completely, you need to bring back the ice lotus.\u201dSi Ye took a glance at Ye Qingtang with a complex expression. He then asked Master Physician Xu to take a look at Si Qiong, but he was calmer than before.Master Physician Xu checked out Si Qiong\u2019s situation, and it matched with what Ye Qingtang had said. \u201cThe flame toxin in Second Young Master is stable now. It shouldn\u2019t be a great problem anymore.\u201dSi Ye sighed in relief secretly after knowing that the flame toxin in Si Qiong was in control.However\u2026Si Ye\u2019s eyes were now full of embarrassment as he met with Ye Qingtang\u2019s eyes which seemed to be smiling. His handsome face was a bit stiff.\u201cLady Ye\u2026 I am sorry\u2026 for just now\u2026\u201d Si Ye said in a stiff manner. Even though he did not wish to admit it, Ye Qingtang really did save his brother\u2019s life.Ye Qingtang smiled and did not say much. It was not easy to become friends with everyone in the Si family. If not because of that, she would not even bother to save people again and again.Si Ye still felt embarrassed and said, \u201cI shall tell grandfather about this.\u201d He then left straight away.\u2026Si Ye came to the main hall and told Master Si about Si Qiong\u2019s recovery.Master Si showed a complex expression after knowing it was done by Ye Qingtang. He remained silent for a while and said, \u201cWe owe her another favor now.\u201d\u201cGrandfather, what happened with Ye Qingtang?\u201d Si Ye was still very confused.Master Si glanced at his grandson who was always very calm and explained slowly how Ye Qingtang had saved Si Bai in order to meet Mu Su. He also told him about what Ye Qingtang had gone through in the Ye family.Si Ye was shocked by his words.\u201cSi Ye\u2026 we do owe her a great favor.\u201d Master Si\u2019s face was very serious. He abandoned his prejudice towards Ye Qingtang when she saved Si Bai. Now, he really trusted the poor girl from the Ye family since she also managed to save Si Qiong from the flame toxin.Two lives were saved because of Ye Qingtang.Si Ye contemplated for a while. Master Si suddenly noticed Si Ye\u2019s injured arm, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your arm?\u201dSi Ye was confused but then remembered that his arm was dislocated by Ye Qingtang. He smiled and fixed his dislocated arm. \u201cIt\u2019s a lesson for me.\u201d\u201cGrandfather, I was rude towards Lady Ye just now. I shall apologize to her later,\u201d Si Ye said.Master Si waved his hand and said, \u201cYe Qingtang is young, but she is more mature than others in her age. She won\u2019t bother about that.

However, his heart was wavering now.If the Great Elder of the Ye family returned and were to harm Ye Qingtang, the Si family would not sit about and do nothing!Si Ye nodded.Master Physician Xu was ready to consult Ye Qingtang on how to grind the scales of the Fiery Sunset Beast into powder, but she cleverly changed the topic to something else.She did not intend to casually let out the fact that she had the advantage of rebirth.She had used two lives to trade for the Si family\u2019s trust. This was all expected.Step by step, she already had it all planned this lifetime.After leaving the Si family, Ye Qingtang went straight back to the Ye family. She took out the Floating Pagoda in her space ring and started cultivating with a calm heart.Regardless of her external support, she still had to rely on herself and collect the blood debt from her past life.\u2026The days passed by quickly, and Lin Town welcomed a significant gathering.The Worship Ceremony represented an auspicious omen where family clans in Lin town prayed for the happiness of all citizens. During the ceremony, family clan members would proceed to the worship stage and contribute to the prosperity of Lin Town.On the day of the Worship Ceremony, Lin Town was decorated with lanterns and festoons along with a tall and huge worship stage in the central public square. Although it was not yet time for the worship, the citizens had already proceeded towards the worship stage early to wait for the start of the ceremony.On the wide worship stage stood a spinning wheel made from Giant Dragon Stones. Its carvings were clearly visible: a few lifelike Giant Dragons were carved on the spinning wheel as if it would spring out alive the next moment.This spinning wheel had been passed down for centuries. Hundreds of years ago, Lin Town had been met with natural disasters, and its people had no means of survival. Suddenly, a mighty figure appeared. In order to suppress the disaster, he took great pains to find the Giant Dragon Stone and hundreds of craftsmen, and after months of crafting, the stone turned into a spinning wheel. Whenever the spinning wheel was spinning, the emitted dragon\u2019s breath would suppress the evil and shower the town with blessings.For hundreds of years, Lin Town had been safe, and the worship ceremony was passed down. To the citizens, this was an act of seeking blessings for Lin Town from heaven, but in the eyes of the family clans, the worship ceremony was a battlefield to showcase their power.The spinning wheel was extremely heavy, and one had to be at least of Connate Level 5 to spin the wheel. Each family clan took turns to spin the wheel, and a clan\u2019s power was measured by the number of times the wheel was spun by the disciples.\u201cAmongst the Duan, Ye, and Si family clan, I wonder which clan\u2019s disciple will be able to spin the most number of times in the worship ceremony this year,\u201d noted the citizens as they waited for the start of the ceremony.\u201cThere are outstanding disciples in all three great family clans. Previously, the Ye family had the greatest chance of winning as the Young Lady of the Ye family, Ye Qingtang, had a supreme-grade spirit root. Her talent could not be compared to those of ordinary people, and only Si Bai from the Si family could compete with her.\u201d\u201cAlthough Si Bai was very talented, he was born with a weak body. He didn\u2019t participate in the spinning of the wheel in previous years, and I reckon he won\u2019t participate this year as well.\u201d\u201cYe Qingtang? I thought I heard that her spirit root broke?\u201d\u201cYes, it broke, that\u2019s why it\u2019s such a pity.\u201d\u201cHowever, I heard that there was another lady in the Ye family, Ye You, who was accepted into Yunxiao Sect as a disciple some time ago. It seems that even though the Ye family lost Ye Qingtang, they gained Ye You. However, Ye You has been accepted as a disciple by the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master and has headed for the Yunxiao Sect. She probably will not participate this year.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seems like Ye Xun will be sent on stage today now that Ye You isn\u2019t here.\u201d\u201cAlthough Ye Xun is adopted by the Ye family, she has pretty good qualifications: a good nature and an outstanding appearance. It is suitable for her to go up the worship stage.\u201dThe public discussed privately. During their conversation, the worship ceremony was about to start, and people from the three great family clans arrived at the side of the worship stage.Drums sounded below the stage, marking the official start of the worship ceremony.Si Ye was the first to walk up the worship stage. Standing in front of the Heaven-Spinning Wheel, he prayed for blessing and subsequently raised his hands, directing all his strength to spin the extremely heavy Heaven-Spinning Wheel.The huge Heaven-Spinning Wheel turned. Hearing a loud dragon groan, everyone below the stage prayed for blessings with devotion while their eyes were locked on the Heaven-Spinning Wheel which was still spinning.After spinning two rounds, the massive Heaven-Spinning Wheel stopped.Other than its weight, the Heaven-Spinning Wheel\u2019s chained points were very stiff as it had been passed down for hundreds of years. It was not just ordinarily difficult to spin the wheel; spinning just one round was already very strenuous to ordinary cultivators. Hence, the fact that Si Ye spun it for two rounds naturally attracted much praise.\u201cAs expected of the Eldest Young Master of the Si family, his strength is indeed impressive.\u201dBelow the worship stage, Duan Tianrao expressionlessly watched Si Ye walk down from the stage. Duan Tianrui, who was beside him, was full of smiles as he said to Duan Tianrao silently,\u201cSecond brother, I see that there is nothing great about Si Ye. He is at most at Connate Level 5. You have just made a breakthrough to Connate Level 6 last month. You can beat him effortlessly.\u201dDuan Tianrao\u2019s lips tugged up while his gaze directly looked past Si Ye and onto the good-looking Si Bai below the stage.The real genius in the Si family was not Si Ye, but Si Bai. Although Si Bai had not revealed his strength before, Si Ye was not even comparable to him based solely on talent. The only person who Duan Tianrao actually wanted to beat had always been Si Bai.Yet, it was a pity that Si Bai did not seem to intend on participating.After Si Ye came down from the worship stage, it was the Duan family\u2019s turn to go on stage. With a jump, Duan Tianrao flew up to the stage.When Duan Tianrao\u2019s tall figure appeared on the worship stage, many looks of admiration from young girls below the stage landed on him.In Lin Town, Si Bai\u2019s appearance was the most outstanding among the males of the Si family. However, Si Bai had a weak body and rarely left the house. So instead, it was Duan Tianrao, who had a nice tall figure and a handsome appearance, who received the admiration of many ladies in the town.Standing beside the Heaven-Spinning Wheel and fixing his eyes on the wheel, he directed his energy all at once and spun the Heaven-Spinning Wheel with all his might.In an instant, the Heaven-Spinning Wheel turned. As it was turning, the citizens below the stage suddenly widened their eyes.Under Duan Tianrao, the massive Heaven-Spinning Wheel actually spun three rounds!This was exactly one round more than the number of rounds Si Ye spun previously!It was the highest count in recent years.\u201cSecond Young Master Duan\u2019s strength has improved again!\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master Duan is certainly the successor of the next Duan family master. This kind of strength is not comparable to that of an ordinary person.\u201dAlthough Duan Tianrao maintained his usual expression, a hint of glee flashed in his eyes. Turning around to face the masses below the stage, he cupped one hand in the other and announced, \u201cTo be able to pray for Lin Town\u2019s blessings today is my honor. On this day, I have two things to announce.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He instinctively looked towards Ye Qingtang beside him with eyes full of worry.Everyone was still waiting for Duan Tianrao to speak. Glancing at the crowd, he announced without further ado,\u201cToday, may everyone witness that the engagement between Ye Qingtang and me is canceled. From now on, we have nothing to do with each other.\u201dThe moment his words were said, gasps sounded throughout the public square.\u201cDuan Tianrao actually wants to cancel his engagement with Ye Qingtang? What is going on?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t he embarrassing the Ye family in public?\u2019Everyone was shocked by the surprising news. The Duan and Ye family are both part of the three greatest family clans, and the engagement between both families had long been a relish to people. Yet, Duan Tianrao actually announced the annulment of his engagement with Ye Qingtang today.Ye Ling\u2019s expression turned extremely ugly. However, he was aware that if he were to make trouble, Ye Qingtang would still be the one to suffer. Thus, he could only suppress his anger for now.Duan Tianrao observed everyone\u2019s response without caring much and continued, \u201cThis is the first piece of news. The second piece is that Lady Ye Xun from the Ye family and I are in love with each other and will be spending the rest of our lives together.\u201dAs he spoke, he turned around to look at Ye Xun, who was standing beside Duan Tianrui below the worship stage. Following his gaze, everyone\u2019s eyes turned towards Ye Xun.Ye Xun was donned in a beautiful-looking white top. A faint smile which moved people was etched on her exquisite small face.\u201cXun, come up.\u201d Duan Tianrao looked at Ye Xun, who was even more beautiful with the elaborate makeup, and stretched his hands towards her.With everyone\u2019s eyes on her, she walked up the worship stage with a shy smile and stood beside Duan Tianrao while holding his hands.\u201cXun Er, you are now my fianc\u00e9e and will be a member of the Duan family in the future. On the worship day today, how about you pray for blessings for the citizens as a member of the Duan family as well?\u201d Duan Tianrao looked at Ye Xun with gentle and doting eyes.Ye Xun nodded her head obediently. Her gentle and appealing appearance stunned many.Everyone in Lin Town knew that the top beauty in the town was Ye You from the Ye family. No one expected Ye Xun to be this beautiful as well. Standing beside Duan Tianrao in a white top, the two of them looked like a golden couple, picture-perfect.\u201cLady Ye Xun was born with good looks and is really compatible with Second Young Master Duan.\u201dEveryone was stunned by the two announcements Duan Tianrao made. Just an instant ago, he broke off the engagement with Ye Qingtang, and in the next, he professed his love for the Ye family\u2019s adopted daughter, Ye Xun, with whom his engagement was publicly announced.However\u2026Although everyone thought that Duan Tianrao\u2019s sudden annulment of his engagement with Ye Qingtang was unexpected, they felt that the golden couple on stage was even more compatible.Even though Ye Xun was adopted by the Ye family, she was very pretty and treated everyone well. Such a lady was naturally the most suitable choice as a wife in the hearts of many men.\u201cSince it\u2019s what darling Duan wants, I\u2019ll give it a try,\u201d Ye Xun said humbly with a face full of smiles which infatuated many onlooking men.Duan Tianrao nodded slightly and silently took a step back.Ye Xun quietly directed her energy and took a sharp look at the Heaven-Spinning wheel in front of her. At that point, she was no longer the adopted daughter of the Ye family but Duan Tianrao\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and the future mistress of the Duan family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the dragon groan sounded, Ye Xun could not help but smile.Seeing the scene, a look of satisfaction flashed across Duan Tianrao\u2019s eyes.\u201cI never expected Ye Xun to actually improve so much. I remember that when she spun the Heaven-Spinning Wheel last year, she only managed to spin half a round. Who would have thought\u2026 she actually was able to spin the wheel for one whole round this year.\u201d\u201cNo wonder Duan Tianrao would like Ye Xun this much. With her natural talent and beautiful appearance, if Duan Tianrao becomes the family master of the Duan family, Ye Xun will also have the qualifications to be the mistress of the Duan family.\u201dEveryone was optimistic about Ye Xun and increasingly thought that Duan Tianrao\u2019s annulment of his previous engagement to marry another woman was reasonable.However\u2026\u201cBut\u2026 now that Ye Xun has gone onto the stage as a member of the Duan family, what will happen to the Ye family?\u201dUncertainty aroused in everyone\u2019s minds.In the previous years, the Ye family had always sent either Ye You or Ye Xun up to the worship stage. However, now that Ye You left for Yunxiao Sect and Ye Xun went up the stage as a member of the Duan family, was not the Ye family only left with Ye Qingtang?If it was in the past, it was without a doubt that Ye Qingtang would go up the stage. However\u2026 now that Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root was broken, how would she be able to turn the Heaven-Spinning Wheel?At that thought, everyone\u2019s gaze could not help but be directed towards where the Ye family was.Under everyone\u2019s watch, Ye Ling\u2019s face darkened to a shocking shade. Although he knew that Duan Tianrao would cancel the engagement publicly, he never expected that Duan Tianrao actually got together with Ye Xun and would publicly announce his engagement with Ye Xun.At this instant, Ye Ling had no time to attend to the onlookers\u2019 gaze and hurriedly looked at Ye Qingtang beside him with mixed feelings.He originally planned to send Ye Xun up the worship stage, yet he never expected such a turn of events.\u201cTang Tang\u2026\u201d Ye Ling\u2019s eyes were full of worry. Only the younger generation of the three greatest family clans could go up the stage. Even if he wanted to go on stage, the rules did not allow him to do so.Now, there was only Ye Qingtang\u2026From the start, Ye Qingtang had been standing beside Ye Ling silently. Even when Duan Tianrao announced his engagement with Ye Xun, she had no reaction at all.Ye Qingtang saw Ye Ling\u2019s worry-filled eyes, and she could not help but look down.Taking a deep breath, Ye Ling said, \u201cTang Tang, you\u2019ll represent the Ye family and go up the stage.\u201dIf not for the fact that there was no one else, Ye Ling would definitely not let his daughter go up the stage in front of everyone.He was not concerned whether Ye Qingtang could turn the Heaven-Spinning Wheel. All he wanted was to end the worship ceremony as soon as possible. Sending Ye Qingtang up was merely an act of formality.Ye Qingtang nodded her head obediently as a sly expression flashed across her slightly droopy eyes. Lifting her eyelids, she glanced across at Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun, who were standing side by side on stage, as her lips covered under the veil curled into a slight smile.The next second, Ye Qingtang slowly took a step forward and walked towards the worship stage.This attracted the attention of many onlookers.Everyone had mixed expressions. Before Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root broke, she had never gone up the worship stage. Even on normal days, Young Lady Ye rarely left the Ye residence.Today was the first time Ye Qingtang appeared before everyone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A hint of mockery flashed in her eyes, but she concealed it quickly before anyone could see it.\u201cDarling Duan, Tang Tang\u2026\u201d Ye Xun purposely looked at Duan Tianrao with an awkward expression.Yet, Duan Tianrao shook his head and said, \u201cThat is the Ye family\u2019s business and has nothing to do with you. I\u2019ll marry you next year. Now, you\u2019re no longer considered as a complete member of the Ye family. You don\u2019t need to be worried about the Ye family\u2019s business.\u201dDuan Tianrao looked satisfactorily at Ye Qingtang\u2019s awareness of the situation to not blow matters up. However, it was only that much. He was not a tiny bit concerned about whether Ye Qingtang could spin the Heaven-Spinning Wheel and whether she would embarrass the Ye family.As Ye Qingtang stood on the worship stage, Duan Tianrao held Ye Xun by her waist directly and went down the stage.Only Ye Qingtang was left standing on the wide worship stage.\u201cSecond brother, did the Ye family really send Ye Qingtang up the stage? Given her current condition, it would be weird if she could turn the Heaven-Spinning Wheel,\u201d Duan Tianrui said without covering up his malice as he looked at Ye Qingtang on stage.\u201cTianrui, just be quiet\u2026\u201d Ye Xun frowned slightly with a helpless expression.Duan Tianrui replied, \u201cSister-in-law, your temper is too good. When you wanted me to search for the Flower Moon Stone the other day, it was arrogantly snatched away by Ye Qingtang. And now, you\u2019re still worried for her because of that good temper of yours.\u201dYe Xun bit her lips and lowered her eyes, intentionally hiding the pride in her eyes.\u201cXun, Tianrui is right. Regardless of anything, sending Ye Qingtang to the worship stage was a choice made by the Ye family. This has nothing to do with you. There\u2019s no need to blame yourself for it.\u201d Duan Tianrui could not help but comfort her when he saw that the beauty was worried.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Just watch the show, sister-in-law. Why worry about her?\u201d Duan Tianrui echoed.Ye Xun finally nodded her head in silence. No one knew that deep down in her heart, she was all but worrying for Ye Qintang. Raising her eyelids to look at Ye Qingtang on stage, a hint of mockery flashed in Ye Xun\u2019s eyes.Ye Qingtang stood on the worship stage alone and looked at the huge Heaven-Spinning Wheel before her with no change in expression.Below the worship stage, citizens quietly shook their heads as they saw that Ye Qingtang had no intention of taking any action.Given Ye Qingtang\u2019s current condition, how could she even turn the Heaven-Spinning Wheel? However, it was a pity that no one else from the Ye family could go onto the stage. If Ye Xun were not engaged to Duan Tianrao, she could go up the stage as a member of the Ye family, and Ye Qingtang would not have to do something she could not do.However\u2026Just as everyone thought that Ye Qingtang simply could not turn the Heaven-Spinning Wheel at all, the corner of Ye Qingtang\u2019s lips hidden under the veil curled up into a smile. She suddenly raised her small pair of fair hands, held the sides of the Heaven-Spinning Wheel, and fiercely exerted her force with a cold light flashing across her eyes.A loud dragon groan filled the air and instantly pierced everyone\u2019s eardrums.Ye Qingtang was actually able to turn the huge Heaven-Spinning Wheel in front of everyone.Furthermore, the Heaven-Spinning Wheel spun at an extremely fast speed. In the blink of an eye, it spun two whole rounds, only slowing down at the third round.Finally, on the completion of the fourth round, the large Heaven-Spinning Wheel stopped turning.The dragon groan vanished as followed.The public square fell into a dead silence instantly.Everyone stared with their mouths agape and looked at Ye Qingtang, who was standing beside the Heaven-Spinning Wheel.\u201cHow could this be?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That Ye Qingtang actually spun the Heaven-Spinning Wheel for four whole rounds?!\u201d\u201cFour rounds\u2026 Could it be that Ye Qingtang is already at Connate Level 7? But\u2026 but isn\u2019t her spirit root broken already?\u201dSounds of disbelief exploded in the crowd like a thunder\u2019s rumble.They originally thought that Ye Qingtang would not be able to spin the Heaven-Spinning Wheel at all, but she actually turned four whole rounds before their eyes.This was one full round more than Duan Tianrao, who spun three rounds a while ago.At this instant, everyone was completely shocked by what they saw.Ye Ling, who was below the stage, widened his eyes in disbelief. He never expected that his own daughter could actually turn the Heaven-Spinning Wheel, and\u2026 it was for four whole rounds!Ye Xun, who initially wanted to watch Ye Qingtang embarrass herself, purposefully feigned a gentle smile, which froze on her face after seeing that Ye Qingtang spun four whole rounds.How could it be?How could Ye Qingtang possibly be at Connate Level 7?Wasn\u2019t her spirit root broken already?Slightly alarmed, Ye Xun instinctively looked at Duan Tianrao beside her, and shock was written on his face as predicted.Duan Tianrao never expected that Ye Qingtang\u2019s strength exceeded his by one whole level.Duan Tianrui was also dumbfounded by what he saw. Looking at Ye Qingtang who stood naturally beside the Heaven-Spinning Wheel while the crowd was in exclamation, a look of detest shone across his eyes uncontrollably. While everyone was in a state of shock, Duan Tianrui suddenly spoke.\u201cYoung Lady Ye, today is the day of worship, and the three great family clans have gathered to pray for blessings for the citizens of Lin Town. However, you are wearing a veil and are unwilling to show people your face. Isn\u2019t that a disrespect to the worship ceremony?\u201dThe moment Duan Tianrui\u2019s words were said, everyone suddenly returned to their senses and realized only then that Ye Qingtang had been wearing a veil all this while.Then, everyone\u2019s expression turned weird inevitably.\u201cYe Qingtang\u2019s ability is indeed shocking.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point in having strength? Don\u2019t you know that Young Lady Ye is infamous for being an ugly lady? Otherwise, why would Duan Tianrao annul his engagement with her?\u201d\u201cA girl\u2019s ability is not the most important; her appearance remains the top priority. No matter how powerful she is, it would be hard for her to be the mistress of the family if she had an unsightly appearance. Rather, I feel that Ye Xun\u2019s ability is strong enough, and she is very beautiful in addition. It\u2019s this kind of girl that makes people love them.\u201dUnder Duan Tianrui\u2019s words, everyone\u2019s attention swiftly changed from Ye Qingtang\u2019s abilities to her appearance. It was not weird for everyone to be this curious: Ye Qingtang had always been facing people with a veil on. As the Young Lady of the Ye family, if she wasn\u2019t ugly, why would she need to cover up like this?The sound of discussion rang through the crowd constantly, and the shock on Duan Tianrao\u2019s face had already faded somewhat. Instinctively looking at Ye Xun, who was as beautiful as a flower, his astonishment slowly faded.Seeing that his plan succeeded, Duan Tianrui could not help but feel even more pleased. He looked at Ye Qingtang, who had not once opened her mouth, and firmly believed that she did not have the courage to face anyone due to her ugly appearance. With that thought in mind, he was energized instantly.\u201cLady Ye, since you are praying for blessings for everyone, shouldn\u2019t you remove this veil to show that the Ye family truly does regard the Worship Ceremony as an important event?\u201dYe Qingtang looked coldly at Duan Tianrui, who was inciting trouble and agitating the people, and her lips curled into a sneer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rest assured, Lady Ye. We are only concerned about the Worship Ceremony and will not be concerned if you are not good-looking.\u201dDuan Tianrui\u2019s words may have sounded nice, but everyone could hear that his words were clearly aimed to expose Ye Qingtang\u2019s ugly appearance.On the side, Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun did not have any intention to stop this.Ye Qingtang scoffed and looked towards an increasingly insolent Duan Tianrui. \u201cAs per your wish.\u201dThen, Ye Qingtang suddenly raised her hands and removed the veil that she had worn for over ten years.As the veil was gradually taken off, the central square was filled with loud gasps!A remarkably beautiful face suddenly appeared before everyone\u2019s eyes. The exquisite features were all god\u2019s most pleased artworks. Her skin was fair as snow, and her rosy lips curled into a charming smile.The moment she smiled, it was as though everything else had paled into insignificance.No one expected that such an alluring beauty was hidden under the thin veil.\u201cWhat do you think? Third Young Master Duan, are you satisfied now?\u201d Ye Qingtang smiled. Everyone\u2019s spirits seemed to be enchanted by her smile as they forgot everything and could only look at the extremely gorgeous face with infatuation.Duan Tianrui was completely dumbfounded. Even if you were to beat him to death, he would definitely not expect Ye Qingtang\u2019s appearance to be this stunning.Compared to Ye Qingtang, Ye Xun, who had previously been praised for her outstanding beauty, was as unbearably ordinary as a village girl. Even the rumored top beauty of Lin town, Ye You, was inferior to Ye Qingtang.Duan Tianrui was dumbfounded, and both he and Ye Xun wore weird expressions.Ye Xun immediately turned pale. If she hadn\u2019t witnessed it for herself, she would never believe that the extremely alluring lady before her was actually Ye Qingtang!How could it be\u2026 She clearly remembered\u2026 Ye Qingtang had a weird and ugly birthmark on her face\u2026Stunned, Duan Tianrao looked at the stunningly beautiful lady on stage. Under the sun, Ye Qingtang was like a fairy who landed in the mortal world whose beauty could not be compared to.\u201cNot good-looking? Who said that Young Lady Ye was ugly just now? If you still call this appearance ugly, is there even any beauty in this world then?\u201dThe citizens stirred. They had never seen such a good-looking lady before.\u201cWith Lady Ye\u2019s appearance, only she is worthy of the title as Lin Town\u2019s top beauty.\u201dEveryone praised Ye Qingtang\u2019s looks. Now, thinking back to Duan Tianrui\u2019s sarcasm from a while ago, they felt that he was narrow-minded and had gradually pressured her to unveil herself due to his evil intention to embarrass her.Yet, unexpectedly\u2026Ye Qingtang was simply an outstanding beauty!At that instant, everyone started to ponder.Previously, they thought that Duan Tianrao canceled his engagement with Ye Qingtang because her spirit root broke and was not powerful enough. In addition, she was ugly and he could bear no longer.But now\u2026Looking at the stunningly gorgeous Ye Qingtang on stage, plus the fact that spun four full rounds of the Heaven-Spinning Wheel, everyone\u2019s thoughts were no longer that simple.In ability and appearance, how was Ye Xun better than Ye Qingtang?Unless he was crazy, why would Duan Tianrao give up on the engagement with Ye Qingtang and turn to marry Ye Xun instead?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Furthermore, Si Bai and Ye Qingtang seemed to share a close relationship. Could it be\u2026Instinctively, everyone turned to look at a stiff-looking Duan Tianrao below the stage.Previously, they thought that Duan Tianrao initiated the breaking of his engagement to Ye Qingtang because he disliked Ye Qingtang. However, now it seemed that things were not that way.Duan Tianrao was outstanding, but when compared to Si Bai, he was no competition at all.\u201cCould it be that\u2026 the annulment of the engagement wasn\u2019t initiated by Duan Tianrao? Could it be because of Ye Qingtang and Si Bai\u2019s close relationship that she broke off the engagement?\u201d\u201cYeah, there\u2019s no way!! If you were Duan Tianrao, would you be willing to give up such an extraordinary beauty like Ye Qingtang and marry Ye Xun, the second choice? You must be blind if you choose Ye Xun!\u201d\u201cSi Bai is way better than Duan Tianrao. I pitied Ye Qingtang just now, but\u2026 should I pity Duan Tianrao now?\u201dA burst of discussion filled the crowd. At this point, no one believed that it was Duan Tianrao who initiated to cancel the engagement.Duan Tianrao\u2019s face turned to a shade of green and white. The sound of the discussions which traveled to his ears was like endless ridicule.The humiliation that should have happened to Ye Qingtang all happened to him instead.\u201cDarling Duan\u2026\u201d Ye Xun anxiously looked at Duan Tianrao\u2019s frozen side profile with worry.Duan Tianrao took a deep breath and turned around. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said without even looking at Ye Xun.Shock filled her, but she could only hang her head low and leave with Duan Tianrui and Duan Tianrao.From that day on, Duan Tianrao became the biggest joke in Lin Town.Before leaving the worship stage, Ye Qingtang told her father Ye Ling that she was going to the Si residence. Ye Ling was in an extremely good mood, so, of course, he would give in to her. Once he gave Ye Qingtang his permission, he went back to the Ye residence in high spirits.Let\u2019s see who would still dare to say that his daughter was ugly from then on?!Ye Qingtang, Si Bai, and Si Ye returned to the Si residence together immediately.At the Si residence\u2019s hall.\u201cAre master\u2019s words true?\u201d Ye Qingtang, who was called to the Si residence, asked with widened eyes. Unable to hide her smile, her lips tugged up.Master Si nodded slightly and replied delightedly, \u201cI called you here today to let you know that Lord Mu Su has agreed to meet you. He should be in Lin Town in a few days.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If Mu Su did not agree, it would be difficult for Master Si to tell Ye Qingtang about it. It was good that everything was successful.\u201cThank you very much, master.\u201d This time, Ye Qingtang thanked him from her heart. If not for the Si family\u2019s connections, she would not have the opportunity to interact with a powerful figure like Mu Su.As long as she could see Mu Su, she could officially begin on her plan!\u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank me,\u201d Master Si said with a smile. \u201cQingtang, you\u2019re no longer a stranger to the Si family. From now on, don\u2019t address me as \u2018master\u2019 anymore. Just \u2018grandfather\u2019 like my grandsons will do.\u201dA hint of a smile flashed in her eyes as she said with a clear voice, \u201cYes, Grandfather Si.\u201dMaster Si could not help but let out a cheerful laugh while remembering to say,\u201cQingtang, allow Grandfather Si to be long-winded. Since you wish to meet Lord Mu Su, you must meet him with an honest heart. Lord Mu Su is open-minded and dislikes it when others scheme against him. You must remember this.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Ye Qingtang knew that Master Si was reminding her.Praise filled Master Si\u2019s eyes. Even though Ye Qingtang came from the Ye family which he disliked, it could not be denied that the more he interacted with Ye Qingtang, the more he liked the intelligent and alert girl. In her, he could not see a single trace of clumsiness and ignorance despite these being the characteristics of people her age.Master Si even intended for Ye Qingtang to stay and have a meal, but she politely rejected the offer.Since there is news from Mu Su, she should start her preparation. She estimated that the \u201cthing\u201d was about to be born. If she went late, she might miss it again as in her previous life.\u201cGrandfather Si, I will not stay any longer today. I still have some matters to settle,\u201d Ye Qingtang said.\u201cJust go ahead,\u201d Master Si replied.Ye Qingtang nodded and left the Si residence after bidding Master Si goodbye.Humming along the way, Ye Qingtang arrived at the Dead Leaves Forest.This time, she did not come to the Dead Leaves Forest to distract her thoughts, but to obtain a baby that she missed out in her previous life!Stepping on the soft leaves, Ye Qingtang moved freely in the dense forest. At the back of the forest was a series of tall rolling hills which were like a line that divided heaven and earth.In the past few days, heavy rain showered upon Lin Town, and the steep mountains were greeted with a series of landslides which caused many trees at the foot of the mountain to collapse. The floor was covered with a mix of soil, gravel, dead leaves, and broken branches; it was an utter mess.Lifting the hem of her skirt, Ye Qingtang walked towards the disorderly mountains and stopped in her tracks when she reached a half-buried stone cave.In her previous life, when the Great Elder returned and ordered for Ye Ling and Second Elder to be murdered, Ye Qingtang was also forced to flee for her life and escaped into this Dead Leaves Forest.In the darkness, she fell into the stone cave which was buried by the densely packed trees. After hiding in the cave for many days while enduring the pain and hunger, she finally escaped when she confirmed that the people that the Great Elder sent had left.And it was at the moment when she was fleeing that she saw something for a brief moment. However, she was frail and had problems staying alive then, so naturally, she did not take further notice of it. Yet, it turned out that she missed out on the only treasure which could have changed her destiny in her previous life.In this life, she would not miss it again!Ye Qingtang\u2019s lips curled up slightly as she stretched out her fair hands and searched through the messy gravel.After a moment, a shiny and bald \u201cegg\u201d which was about the size of a palm appeared before her eyes!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ye Qingtang saw it in her previous life as well but missed the opportunity to bring it back as she was escaping for her life. When she returned, the dragon egg had died from prostration as it was exposed outside for too long.Many years later, Ye Qingtang once saw a lightning dragon that someone raised, and its ferocity left many speechless. The breeder was only at Martial Qi Level 2 but was able to wipe out nearly ten thousand people who encircled him and leave in one piece simply by relying on the violent lightning dragon.Ye Qingtang was extremely regretful at that time. If she had taken the lightning dragon egg away with her in time back then, she would not have ended up being driven to a dead end by Ye You and the many people she led.In this life, she would not let the same regret happen again.Ye Qingtang carefully dug the lightning dragon egg out from the soil and carried it in her arms.As long as she managed to successfully hatch and raise the lightning dragon egg, she would have another card in her hand!\u201cLittle thing, this is a change for both you and me this time around. I won\u2019t let you die from prostration before you\u2019re even born,\u201d Ye Qingtang murmured while stroking the bare egg with a smile.Ye Qingtang kept the dragon egg carefully. There was still some time before the dragon egg would hatch, and in the meantime, it needed to be near a body at all times as a form of incubation using the body heat. Otherwise, if she was even slightly careless, the dragon egg would lose its life once again.After finding the dragon egg, Ye Qingtang immediately returned to the Ye residence. Just as she entered the main door, she suddenly felt that the atmosphere became strange.Ye Qingtang\u2019s expression changed slightly, and she walked straight to the front hall.In the front hall, Ye Ling was sitting on the chair for the highest ranking position. Other than Ye Ling, an old man with a cold expression was present as well.\u201cTang Tang, you came back at the right time. The Great Elder has just returned today.\u201d Ye Qingtang looked at Ye Qingtang helplessly but appeared to sound calm.Ye Qingtang stopped in her tracks and looked towards the Great Elder who was sitting in the hall.When Ye Xun conned Ye Qingtang to leave the Ye residence, it was the Great Elder who personally captured her and allowed his granddaughter, Ye You, to snatch Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root away.It could be said that the Great Elder was the initiator of Ye Qingtang\u2019s misery in her past life. Seeing the Great Elder again today, Ye Qingtang was no longer short-tempered like before. She quietly calmed her fluctuating emotions, acting as if there was nothing wrong, and greeted politely,\u201cGreat Elder.\u201dThe Great Elder was already over eighty years old. Although all his hair had turned white, he was still sharp and spirited, leading people into believing that he was at most slightly over fifty at first look. His sharp eyes glanced over at Ye Qingtang, and a strange expression flashed across his eyes when he noticed that the birthmark on Ye Qingtang\u2019s face had disappeared. However, he did not react much and only nodded briefly.\u201cThe journey to send little You to Yunxiao Sect was tough. The Great Elder should rest early,\u201d Ye Ling said with a smile although he raised his guard against the Great Elder.Expressionless, the Great Elder replied, \u201cThank you for your concern. It is our Ye family\u2019s honor for little You to be favored by the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master. I ought to work hard.\u201dYe Ling smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When your second uncle ends his seclusion a few days later, we will fetch him together.\u201d Ye Ling was filled with concern. His deteriorating health coupled with the Second Elder\u2019s seclusion had allowed the Great Elder to act with increased arrogance in the Ye family.Ye Ling was not a fool; he had faintly sensed the Great Elder\u2019s ambitions.However, he was simply unable to fight with the Great Elder now. The only way to deal with the Great Elder was to be submissive temporarily and wait until the Second Elder ends his seclusion.Now, Ye Ling was most worried about Ye Qingtang. He was very afraid that the Great Elder would secretly take Ye Qingtang\u2019s life as she was the successor to the family master position, and, thus, he specially warned her.Looking at her extremely worried father, Ye Qingtang naturally sighed in her heart.She knew that Ye Ling\u2019s compromises were all for the sake of ensuring her safety. Even when the Great Elder had usurped Ye Ling\u2019s power as the family master in Ye Qintang\u2019s past life, Ye Ling did not resist much, and all of this was for her safety.However\u2026How would her father know that she had already secretly fallen victim to the Great Elder?In her previous life, Ye Qingtang did not dare to tell Ye Ling about the truth behind her stolen spirit root because of the Great Elder\u2019s warning; in this life, she was unwilling to let her father have any more worries.\u201cI understand.\u201d Ye Qingtang nodded obediently.It was only then that Ye Ling was slightly relieved.\u201cYou performed very well at the Worship Ceremony today. Even I did not expect that you would become this strong. You must be tired already, go back early and rest. Stay at home and prepare these few days. everything will be okay once your second uncle ends his seclusion.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dYe Qingtang nodded obediently, but deep down, she was not as relaxed as Ye Ling.Ye Ling had tolerated up to then as he was waiting for the Second Elder to suppress and control the Great Elder once the Second Elder ends his seclusion. However, how would the Great Elder not be clear about this?In the previous lifetime, the Great Elder secretly sent people to assassinate Ye Ling one day before the Second Elder ended his seclusion and made the Second Elder carry the blame for Ye Ling\u2019s death. This allowed the Great Elder to get rid of two people at once, hitting two birds with one stone.This time, Ye Qingtang would definitely not allow the Great Elder\u2019s scheme to succeed.At that thought, Ye Qingtang could not help but narrow her eyes as she briskly walked back to her room.The medicine that she prepared for Ye Ling were mixed in his tea on normal days. Those medicines could slowly remove the remaining poison in his body. Perhaps Ye Ling himself had not realized that his complexion these past few days was way better than before.However\u2026This was far from enough. To deal with the Great Elder, Ye Qingtang must have even more preparations in place!\u2026Ye Xun returned from the Duan family and not a trace of a smile could be seen on her face.Previously, it was she who secretly told Duan Tianrao about Ye Qingtang\u2019s broken spirit root, and she was also the one who hinted to Duan Tianrao that Ye Qingtang was ugly.Yet today, Ye Qingtang had embarrassed her publicly. While Duan Tianrao did not say it, Ye Xun already felt the change in Duan Tianrao\u2019s attitude towards her.\u201cYe Qingtang, why do you always have to spoil my plans.\u201d Ye Xun took a deep breath quietly, worked to sort out her emotions, and then walked into the Ye residence.When she just entered, she heard news of the Great Elder\u2019s return, and her unhappiness vanished into thin air instantly.She had long sided with the Great Elder and was obviously aware of his ambitions. Now that he was back, both Ye Ling and Ye Qingtang would not have good days ahead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s my bad,\u201d Ye Xun sought forgiveness from the Great Elder gently.\u201cRise. I didn\u2019t think of returning early as well, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d The Great Elder raised his hand slightly to signal for Ye Xun to stand up after curtsying to him.Ye Xun said obediently, \u201cGrandfather must be tired from the journey. Now that sister You entered Yunxiao Sect, her future must be limitless.\u201dThe Great Elder was pleased by Ye Xun\u2019s words. \u201cIn the time that I was gone, was Ye Qingtang well-behaved?\u201d\u201cShe was relatively obedient, and she hadn\u2019t told Ye Ling that her spirit root was actually stolen,\u201d Ye Xun replied truthfully, not daring to blab.The Great Elder nodded slightly, but his tone turned cold suddenly. \u201cSeems that she knows what\u2019s good for her. If she can\u2019t watch her mouth, then she can\u2019t blame me for being heartless.\u201dLooking at the Great Elder\u2019s sinister face, Ye Xun suddenly said, \u201cYe Qingtang was obedient regarding the spirit root incident, but\u2026 during the worship ceremony today, Ye Qingtang\u2019s abilities were a little weird.\u201d\u201cWeird?\u201d the Great Elder asked with raised eyebrows.Ye Xun instantly told the Great Elder everything about Ye Qingtang\u2019s performance during the worship ceremony.After listening, the Great Elder\u2019s expression turned grim.\u201cConnate Level 7.\u201dYe Qingtang\u2019s spirit root is already gone, how was it that her ability was that of a Connate Level 7?However, the Great Elder was not too concerned. Even if Ye Qingtang was Connate Level 7, she still could not match up to him. What he was truly concerned about was the Second Elder\u2019s ending of seclusion a few days later.In the whole Ye family, only the Second Elder\u2019s abilities were above his. Furthermore, the Second Elder was extremely supportive of Ye Ling.If the Second Elder ended his seclusion, it would definitely affect the Great Elder\u2019s scheme to usurp authority.\u201cNoted, you may leave first,\u201d said the Great Elder.\u201cAlright.\u201d Ye Xun retreated obediently.Sitting in the study room alone, the Great Elder narrowed his eyes.There were two more days until the Second Elder\u2019s ending of seclusion, and once he returned, the Ye family would completely land in his hands.The Great Elder sneered and called upon his henchman at once.\u201cGo to the east of the city and visit the Qin Luo Pavilion for me\u2026\u201d Then, the Great Elder wrote a letter and placed it into the hands of his henchman. When the henchman understood the meaning of this, he left immediately.Sitting on the chair, the Great Elder smirked quietly.On the surface, the Qin Luo Pavilion was merely an ordinary teahouse. But in reality, it was a hidden assassination organization whose leader, Qin Luo, was highly skilled and had many talented underlings. There was no assassination task that Qin Luo was not able to complete.The Great Elder had ordered someone to go to the Qin Luo Pavilion to complete his subsequent scheme.\u2026The following night when it was in the dead of the night, most of the lights in the Ye residence were put out.Ye Ling sat in the study room alone with his eyebrows furrowed. As he looked at the high-quality wine that he had just ordered people to prepare, his tightly pressed lips finally eased a little.The next morning, the Second Elder would come out from his seclusion. As long as he returned to the Ye family, everything would be stabilized in the Ye family.Ye Ling slowly heaved a sigh as he looked at the wine jug on the table and put off the lights, preparing to return to his bedroom to rest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Other than himself, there were only the four uninvited men in the huge courtyard.\u201cAre you the Ye family family master, Ye Ling?\u201d asked the leader of the group.\u201cYes, that\u2019s me,\u201d Ye Ling replied.The leader\u2019s eyes sharpened. Making eye contact with his partners beside him, the four men took out their swords at the same time and stabbed towards Ye Ling without any word.Alarmed, Ye Ling immediately took out his sword to fight them.In the blink of an eye, the sharp light from the four swords struck at him like the stars\u2019 sparkle.The four men were highly skilled. Even if Ye Ling\u2019s abilities had not declined, it would still be hard to fend off them. Furthermore, Ye Ling\u2019s abilities had reduced greatly over the years, and he was simply not on the same level as the other four. Shortly, he was already dripping with cold sweat.The leader of the black-clothed men suddenly sent Ye Ling flying with a kick. Ye Ling landed on the floor with a heavy thud as he saw the four men attacking towards him and thought that he was going to die there and then.But just as the four swords were about to pierce through his chest, a light flashed across the Ye residence.A sharp clatter followed, and the black-clothed men\u2019s swords were directly deflected by that bolt of cold light.Then, a figure flew from the top of the courtyard walls and stood in front of Ye Ling.Ye Ling took a clear look of the person and astonishment filled him.\u201cTang Tang! Leave! Don\u2019t care about me.\u201d Ye Ling did not think that his own daughter would suddenly appear there. The four men were far stronger than he, and even if Ye Qingtang was at Connate Level 7, she definitely would not be able to win against them.Ye Qingtang wore a cold expression as she stood beside Ye Ling. Under the moonlight, her cold and empty gaze swept across the four murderous men before her.\u201cLittle girl, do you wish to die?\u201d The leader of the four men frowned as he looked at Ye Qingtang, who suddenly appeared, with a deepened murderous intention.Ye Qingtang stood rooted in front of Ye Ling without moving an inch. In her previous life, it was this night that her father was assassinated in the residence by the killers sent by the Great Elder. How could she let the tragedy repeat now that she was reborn?However\u2026Ye Qingtang did not strike. She was understood clearly that she was not these four men\u2019s opponent at all given her current ability.Then, Ye Qingtang suddenly said, \u201cYou all wish to take my father\u2019s life merely because you all accepted someone\u2019s money and are acting under their orders. I know who hired you, but I wonder\u2026 how much did they pay for you all to actually disregard the Ye family\u2019s reputation and directly enter the Ye residence to assassinate someone.\u201d\u201cLittle girl, what has the price others paid got to do with you? Since you know our intention of coming and now that you are here, it\u2019s just your bad luck.\u201dHowever, Ye Qingtang replied, \u201cQin Luo Pavilion\u2019s price must be pretty high. To be able to hire you, the pavilion master, and your three highly skilled underlings, I guess it must have cost more than ten thousand gold?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is it ten thousand?\u201d Ye Qingtang said with a smile.The four people from the Qin Luo Pavilion narrowed their eyes. Although they did not confirm verbally, their silence gave Ye Qingtang an answer.Ye Qingtang smiled and continued. \u201cIt really is ten thousand? I didn\u2019t think that the Great Elder of the Ye family would be so petty to give you all only ten thousand gold.\u201dThe Great Elder of the Ye family?The four men initially thought that Ye Qingtang was stalling time on purpose, but they did not expect that\u2026 not only did Ye Qingtang point out their identity, but she even knew that the person who hired them was the Great Elder of the Ye family.At that instant, the four men\u2019s reactions turned slightly weird.\u201cLittle thing, what do you actually want to say?\u201d the leader asked coldly.Ye Qingtang replied, \u201cNothing much. I just think that given the capabilities of the four of you, a reward of ten thousand may be a bit too low. Isn\u2019t the Great Elder\u2019s payment of only ten thousand gold a look down on your abilities? How about this: I\u2019ll give you forty thousand gold to get rid of the Great Elder.\u201dThe four men were startled by Ye Qingtang\u2019s words.Forty thousand gold?Wasn\u2019t that four times the price the Great Elder offered!The four men exchanged glances and did not easily believe Ye Qingtang\u2019s suggestions. Their leader said, \u201cYoung Lady Ye, I know your identity. However, don\u2019t take us as fools and trick us. We are very clear of the situation in the Ye family. Given you and your father\u2019s position in the Ye family, I\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t even have ten thousand, much less forty thousand\u2026\u201dYe Ling, who was behind Ye Qingtang, was on his guard as well. He merely took Ye Qingtang\u2019s actions as an act of stalling time and knew that the man\u2019s words were true. With his and Ye Qingtang\u2019s situation, there was simply no way to get forty thousand gold.However\u2026Ye Qingtang gave a faint smile. After looking at them in the eyes, she took out bars of gold from her space ring and placed them in front of the four men.In the blink of an eye, a total of twenty thousand gold bars were stacked before the four men. Under the moonlight, the gold bars sparkled in brilliance and blinded the four men\u2019s eyes.Although the Qin Luo Pavilion had taken on quite a few cases, the rewards were at most a few thousand gold. The offer of ten thousand gold by the Great Elder of the Ye family was already the highest paying request they accepted in recent years.Yet, unexpectedly\u2026Young Lady Ye offered such a high amount and was really able to pay it.\u201cThere is twenty thousand here. Treat it as my deposit. As long as you get rid of the Great Elder of the Ye family, I will automatically pass you the remaining twenty thousand.\u201d Ye Qingtang looked up at the four hesitant men.In her previous life, she did not know about the Great Elder\u2019s scheme and did not have enough money to buy over these assassins. But now\u2026 everything was different.She wanted the Great Elder to have a taste of his own medicine and to experience how it felt to be targeted by hired assassins.Initially, the four assassins were a little hesitant. However, seeing so much gold piled in front of them, they exchanged glances at once. A shrewd expression flashed across the leader\u2019s eyes as he faked a heavy tone,\u201cThe Qin Luo Pavilion has its own rules. Since we accepted the order, how could we change it so casually? If this goes out, wouldn\u2019t it ruin the Qin Luo Pavilion\u2019s reputation?\u201d the leader said, but his words had much less murderous intent than before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you help me to get rid of the Great Elder and assist my father in regaining his authority, the Ye family will remember this favor and will definitely return it in the future. How can this return of favor be measured with merely ten thousand gold?Ye Qingtang\u2019s words stumped the four men.The Ye family was one of three greatest family clans in Lin Town, and its possessions were unfathomable. To the three great family clans, ten thousand gold was indeed just a drop in the bucket.They merely had a monetary deal with the Great Elder. But if they took on Ye Qingtang\u2019s request, not only were they able to get forty thousand gold, but the Ye family would also owe them a favor in the future. What they could earn in and out was not just a tiny amount!Instantly, the four people from the Qin Luo Pavilion weighed the pros and cons quickly. When they turned to look at Ye Qingtang, the murderous intent in their eyes before was replaced with a smile.\u201cWe understand what Young Lady Ye means. We\u2019ll accept your request! Rest assured, since we accepted your request, we\u2019ll carry out your order.\u201d The black-clothed men who were initially out to kill Ye Qingtang were now full of smiles as though they changed their faces.\u201cI\u2019ll trouble you all, then. The Ye family won\u2019t forget your help today,\u201d Ye Qingtang said with cupped fists.\u201cRest assured Lady Ye, we will get rid of the Great Elder now.\u201d Then, the four men left together and headed for their new target\u2014the sinister Great Elder of the Ye family.After the four of them left, Ye Ling, who had been beside Ye Qingtang this whole time, finally opened his mouth.\u201cTang Tang, you\u2026\u201d Ye Ling looked at his daughter with a weird expression. He originally thought that he would definitely die today, but unexpectedly, Ye Qingtang was actually able to turn the situation around and even got the Great Elder in a fix.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, father. I\u2019ll never allow anyone to harm you ever again.\u201d Looking at Ye Ling who was safe and sound, she felt the guilt from her previous life fading away.\u201cI know that the Great Elder has evil intentions and was plotting to snatch the position of the family master away, but I did not expect\u2026 he would actually be this vicious and hire someone to take my life.\u201d Ye Ling frowned as a mix of emotions surged within him.\u201cThe Great Elder is far more evil than others. Since second uncle is ending his seclusion tomorrow, he was deeply afraid that second uncle and you would join forces. Thus, he wanted to get rid of you in advance,\u201d Ye Qingtang said.Ye Ling sighed and shook his head. \u201cThe four people from the Qin Luo Pavilion were strong, but the Great Elder isn\u2019t weak himself. Plus there are many guards around him. I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201dJust as Ye Ling\u2019s words left his mouth, a noisy hubbub was suddenly heard in the courtyard, and a faint smell of blood diffused in the wind.Ye Ling and Ye Qingtang exchanged glances and headed towards the courtyard immediately.Fighting sounds came directly from the courtyard that the Great Elder stayed in. Outside the courtyard laid many dead bodies, and the guards that were originally guarding outside the Great Elder\u2019s courtyard had all died.\u201cTo be able to kill so many people around the Great Elder in such a short time, the people from the Qin Luo Pavilion are indeed skilled.\u201d The more Ye Ling looked, the more fearful he became. Had Ye Qingtang not rush there in time, the person lying in a pool of blood would have been him.Ye Qingtang took a look and did not say anything. Just as she was about to enter the courtyard with Ye Ling, she suddenly saw the miserable-looking Great Elder flying away from a side of the courtyard. The people behind the Great Elder initially wanted to chase after him but slowly stopped in their tracks upon seeing Ye Qingtang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We will be on guard here tonight. As long as the Great Elder returns, we will definitely take his life,\u201d the leader of the group said.Looking at the miserable situation in the courtyard, Ye Qingtang, however, shook her head and replied, \u201cYou all have already helped me to vent my anger. Thank you for the trouble today.\u201d Then, she handed the remaining twenty thousand to the four men in black.\u201cIt\u2019s not early anymore, you all can return. I, Ye Qingtang, will remember this favor received from the Qin Luo Pavilion. As for the Great Elder, I will deal with him subsequently.\u201dIt would be best if she could use the four men to get rid of the Great Elder. However, if that was not possible, Ye Qingtang did not dare to let the four of them stay on the Ye residence any longer as it would not be worth it should the Great Elder find an opportunity to push the responsibility of hiring assassins onto her.Furthermore, if the four men were here, it would not be possible for the Great Elder to return to the Ye residence.As the time the four men spent on the residence increased, troubles would be created instead.Upon receiving the gold and hearing Ye Qingtang\u2019s words, the four men naturally did not have any intention to stay any longer. They thanked Ye Qingtang immediately and flew away.When the four men from the Qin Luo Pavilion left, Ye Qingtang\u2019s eyes turned cold as she looked at the corpses that filled the courtyard.These guards were originally servants of the Ye family and should be loyal to Ye Ling. Yet, they turned their backs on the family master and became the underlings of the Great Elder. Today, the Great Elder intentionally transferred the guards away from her father\u2019s courtyard to allow the assassins from the Qin Luo Pavilion to kill Ye Ling.Ye Qingtang was not the slightest saddened over the death of the group of unfaithful guards.\u201cFather, it\u2019s not early anymore, and we still have to fetch second uncle tomorrow. You should return early and rest,\u201d Ye Qingtang said with a smile. From the start, she had not expected the four men from the Qin Luo Pavilion to be able to kill the Great Elder since he was skilled and, thus, not an opponent that could be easily dealt with.However, after the incident today, the Great Elder may not have the opportunity to harm Ye Ling anymore. With the Second Elder ending his seclusion tomorrow, she wanted to see how the Great Elder was going to start a commotion!Only until late night when the Great Elder finally received news of the four assassins\u2019 departure from the Ye residence, the Great Elder returned gloomily.Up until then, he still could not understand why the Qin Luo Pavilion\u2019s assassins he hired to kill Ye Ling suddenly turned to kill himself. If not for the fact that he was powerful enough, he would have died in their hands.The more he wondered, the stranger it became. Not knowing the cause of the change, he could only put down the matter temporarily and prepare to further investigate it in the days to come.Now that the Qin Luo Pavilion went against the agreement, Ye Ling could not be killed, and as such, the Great Elder would not be able to push any blame onto the Second Elder.When he thought of that, the Great Elder could not help but frown. However, looking at the disorderly mess in his courtyard, he remembered something.Assassinating the family master was a crime punishable by death, and assassinating the Great Elder of a family clan was similarly a crime punishable by death!Ye Ling had been poisoned, and his days were numbered. Even if he did not die today, he would not have many days left. The real trouble was the Second Elder.He would definitely not let the Second Elder and Ye Ling join hands.The Ye family was sooner or later his!\u2026The second morning, Ye Qingtang woke up, changed her clothes, and then headed for Ye Ling\u2019s courtyard to find him and fetch the Second Elder together.But when Ye Qingtang entered Ye Ling\u2019s courtyard, he was nowhere to be found. She immediately asked the servants for Ye Ling\u2019s location.Only then did she realise\u2026The Great Elder actually pushed forward the time to fetch the Second Elder. After receiving the news, Ye Ling did not react much, but he did not want to wake Ye Qingtang, who was still sleeping. Thus, he headed for where the Second Elder was in seclusion in along with the Great Elder ahead of time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Without wasting any time, she went straight to take a horse and rode quickly to where the Second Elder was in seclusion in.In her previous life, Ye Ling lost his life the night before the Second Elder ended his seclusion. When Ye Qingtang was still mourning the death of her father, the Great Elder forcefully brought her to fetch the Second Elder. Then, Ye Qingtang still thought of finding out her father\u2019s killer with the help of her loving second uncle once he ended his seclusion. However\u2026Just as the Second Elder just stepped out of the stone door, the Great Elder immediately ordered people forward to kill the Second Elder after condemning him for murdering the family master.Helplessly\u2026The Ye Qingtang in the previous life was ignorant and completely did not know what happened. Furthermore, she had little ability and was not able to react due to the shock from the Great Elder\u2019s actions. Even if she wanted to save the Second Elder, the Great Elder paid no heed to her words, ordered people to guard her from a side, and killed the Second Elder in front of her.Up to this day, Ye Qingtang still vividly remembers the image of the Second Elder dying before her eyes.Ye Qingtang took a deep breath and cleared her mind as she continuously increased the horse\u2019s speed.She did not expect the Great Elder to head there in advance.If she remembered correctly, not only did the Great Elder personally invite people there to welcome the Second Elder\u2019s ending of seclusion, but he even made Ye Xun invite a few Elders from the Duan family. It was obvious that he had set his mind on killing the Second Elder the moment he ended his seclusion!Ye Qingtang accelerated and rode at full speed.At the Ye family\u2019s area for seclusion outside Lin Town, there were many people gathered.With hands behind his back, the Great Elder looked at the tightly shut stone door with a cold gleam in his eyes.\u201cGreat Elder, the Second Elder should be out in a while,\u201d Ye Xun, who was standing beside the Great Elder, said with a smile.The Great Elder gave a slight nod as his gaze swept across Ye Xun and landed on Duan Tianrao, who stood next to her. Today, Ye Xun, as Duan Tianrao\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, had invited a few Elders from the Duan family over on the basis of the Great Elder\u2019s punishment of the Ye family betrayer.The Second Elder\u2019s ability was good, and the Great Elder was not fully confident that he could take down the Second Elder. Thus, he invited the Elders from the Duan family not only to frighten the Second Elder but also to serve as witnesses after the execution of the Second Elder for his crime.Whether the Second Elder committed a crime was not important to the Duan family.Now that Ye You was a direct disciple of the Yunxiao Sect Sec Master, it was natural that the Duan family viewed the Great Elder with greater importance. Furthermore, Ye Xun was close to the Great Elder. As such, the Duan family was willing to give face to the Great Elder.\u201cThank you for coming today, Elders,\u201d the Great Elder said with clasped hands.An Elder from the Duan family replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The Duan and Ye family are both part of the three greatest family clans in Lin Town and have friendly relations. Now that such an incident has happened in the Ye family, the Duan family is happy to help. We can also make use of this incident as a preventative wake-up call for those harboring evil intentions.\u201dThe Great Elder smiled. \u201cAs the Great Elder, I must\u2019ve made a mistake in my management for such a scandal to break out in the Ye family.\u201d\u201cWhy would you say that, Great Elder? You have already done very well. Although you\u2019re an Elder, it\u2019s impossible for you to take care of everything perfectly. Moreover, you almost lost your life because of this. How could you be blamed for this? Seeing that your complexion is pretty good today, I guess the injuries you sustained are not that serious?\u201d asked a Duan family Elder.\u201cI am still fine, merely some abrasions only,\u201d the Great Elder said slowly as he looked over at a Ye family carriage at a side. After seeing Ye Ling coming down from the carriage, the Great Elder did not say anything much as he stared at the tightly shut stone door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Our friends from the Duan family have about the same level of strength as the Second Elder. They are here today to find out whether the Second Elder has indeed succeeded in making a breakthrough and perhaps even learn from the Second Elder\u2019s experience.\u201d\u201cThank you for your hospitality,\u201d the Duan family\u2019s Elders smiled as they made courteous exchanges although their tone was rather lacking in respect for a family master, making it seem perfunctory.The Duan family was clearly aware of the situation in the Ye family. Although Ye Ling was still the family master of the Ye family, the changing of the person in position was merely a matter of time.They would rather be on friendly terms with the Great Elder than with Ye Ling.After all\u2026Backing the Great Elder was Ye You who entered the Yunxiao Sect!Ye Ling sensed that something was off, but the few Elders from the Duan family and the Great Elder had no intention of speaking further. Moreover, Ye Ling saw Duan family Elders\u2019 superficial attitude towards him, and he knew that he would not get any answers even if he asked.Furthermore\u2026Ye Ling was annoyed with the Duan family over Duan Tianrao\u2019s initiation to break the engagement. Now that he saw Ye Xun and Duan Tianrao publicly appearing together, he was even more unwilling to say anything further.At that instant, Ye Ling felt that it was a good thing for Ye Qingtang to not come today lest she gets upset when she sees Ye Xun and Duan Tianrao together.In the state of silence, the tightly-shut stone door slowly opened, and a gust of cold air escaped from the opening gap.When the stone door was completely opened, a tall figure slowly walked out from the stone door. It was an elderly man over fifty years of age, but his tall and straight posture did not make him look old at all. His firm and good-looking features emitted a healthy glow. If one were to ignore the faint wrinkles on his face, it would be hard to guess the real age of this person before them.The Second Elder of the Ye family stepped out steadily. Although he was only wearing a simple top, his disposition was unable to be covered.The moment the Second Elder looked up, surprise filled his eyes briefly as he saw that apart from the Ye family, people from the Duan family were there as well. However, he was not too concerned.Before he went into seclusion, Ye Qingtang and Duan Tianrao were engaged. Thus, although he was surprised by the Duan family\u2019s visit, he did not think much about it.When Ye Ling saw the Second Elder walking out of the stone door, his heart that had been suspended in midair for a long time finally settled down gradually. He immediately went forward to speak to the Second Elder, but a figure beat him to it.The Great Elder suddenly stood in front of the Second Elder. At that instant, there was not a hint of emotion on the Great Elder\u2019s face. With a slight frown, his eyes sharpened as he looked at the Second Elder, and he ordered coldly, \u201cTake the Second Elder down!\u201dYe Ling and the Second Elder were both stunned by the Great Elder\u2019s words.Just when Ye Ling and the Second Elder were still in a shock, a group of guards that came with the Great Elder went forward and locked the Second Elder\u2019s arms.\u201cGreat Elder, what is the meaning of this!\u201d The Second Elder frowned in confusion.\u201cGreat Elder, what are you doing?\u201d Ye Ling\u2019s face sunk as he looked at the Great Elder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Narrowing his eyes slightly, he looked past Ye Ling and straight at the Second Elder. \u201cLast night, four assassins barged into the Ye residence in an attempt to kill me and the family master. Do you know about this, Second Elder?\u201dThe Great Elder\u2019s question shocked Ye Ling.The Second Elder, who was completely unaware, frowned slightly. He looked worriedly at Ye Ling, and after verifying that Ye Ling was not injured, he said in a low voice, \u201cI have been in seclusion for many days and do not know about this incident. There are people in Lin Town who actually dare to offend the Ye family?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know about this incident?\u201d The Great Elder suddenly scoffed. \u201cIn the whole Ye family, there are only three people who can exercise control: you, the family master, and I. If the family master and I died, and given that the Young Lady is still too young, who do you think\u2026 will be able to gain power and exercise control in the Ye family?\u201dThough the Great Elder was asking, everyone knew what he was implying in his words.If the Great Elder and Ye Ling died, the position of power in the Ye family would naturally fall into the hands of the Second Elder.The Second Elder\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cGreat Elder, what do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cSecond Elder, the Great Elder\u2019s meaning is very obvious. A clever person like you would surely understand?\u201d Ye Xun looked at the Second Elder helplessly with a frown and continued. \u201cSecond Elder, do you really not understand or are you acting like you don\u2019t? The Ye family has always treated you fairly, and you hold the respectable position of an Elder. My father had such deep respect for you, but it turns out that you are too greedy. Not only are you dissatisfied with the position as an Elder, but you even want to kill others to steal their power!\u201dThe Second Elder\u2019s eyes sharpened as he immediately looked at Ye Xun, who was full of slander.\u201cI have always had a clear conscience and have never once done anything to harm the Ye family. Ye Xun, how dare you speak so recklessly and accuse me?!\u201dYe Xun was scared by the Second Elder\u2019s glare. Purposefully putting on a wronged expression, she hid behind Duan Tianrao as she tugged on Duan Tianrao\u2019s sleeves with tears dancing in her eyes. \u201cDarling Duan\u2026 I\u2019m scared.\u201dDuan Tianrao immediately raised his hand and patted Ye Xun\u2019s tiny hands comfortingly. Then, he looked at the Second Elder and said, \u201cSecond Elder, I used to address you as the Second Elder of the Ye family and have always respected your abilities, but you are a man and should take responsibility like one. Everyone in Lin Town knows that something happened in the Ye family yesterday. With both Uncle Ye and the Great Elder targeted for assassination, who would dare to strike at the Ye family if there were no benefits to gain? Only you would vainly attempt to steal the family master position and do such a monstrous thing.\u201dThe Second Elder\u2019s expression darkened completely. He just ended his seclusion and was completely unaware of everything that happened outside. Never had he expected that the moment he ended his seclusion, he was accused of committing such a serious crime.In addition, looking at the intimate gestures between Ye Xun and Duan Tianrao, the Second Elder\u2019s eyes darkened a few shades instantly.Duan Tianrao was clearly Ye Qingtang\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, but now, he was actually having an affair with Ye Xun, the adopted daughter of the Ye family!The Second Elder was wholeheartedly besotted with martial arts and did not marry or have kids. He had long treated Ye Qingtang as his own granddaughter. As he looked at the two people in front of him, one who even accused him, anger filled him, and he narrowed his eyes at them.Suddenly, a powerful aura dissipated from him, and in an instant, the few guards who locked his arms were thrown out by the force.\u201cIgnorant kid, how dare you to slander me!\u201d the Second Elder remarked coldly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You know very well what you did,\u201d an Elder from the Duan family said in a low voice.\u201cWhat I did?\u201d The Second Elder scoffed. \u201cI have been in seclusion for such a long time and had never once left a step. Never had I thought that you all would accuse me like this!\u201dLooking at the Second Elder\u2019s increasingly raging force, another Elder from the Duan family protected Duan Tianrao while scoffing. \u201cIf you wanted to do it, why would you do it personally? As Elders as well, we know that you arranged for your henchman to deliver food and clothes to you daily while you were in seclusion. It is nothing impossible if you entrusted the matter to your henchman.\u201dYe Ling understood the situation very clearly after looking at the commotion. He was initially confused over the reason for the Duan family\u2019s presence, but now it seemed that the Great Elder came prepared. He failed in having Ye Ling killed yesterday, and now, he actually wanted to push the responsibility of the crime on the Second Elder!Ye Ling was not a fool. He was very aware of the reason why the Great Elder wanted to get rid of the Second Elder.In the whole Ye family, only the Second Elder\u2019s abilities could compete with the Great Elder\u2019s. If the Second Elder died, the Great Elder could freely deal with Ye Ling and Ye Qingtang.\u201cWait! There aren\u2019t any clues regarding yesterday\u2019s incident at all. Isn\u2019t the Great Elder\u2019s assertive judgment too irresponsible?\u201d Ye Ling stepped forward immediately and looked at the Great Elder coldly. \u201cMoreover, the Second Elder is very loyal to the Ye family and is certainly not someone who would do such an evil thing. The real murderer behind the assassins is definitely not him.\u201dThe Great Elder looked at Ye Ling and responded without much emotion. \u201cFamily master, I know that you are very close to the Second Elder, but there is an old saying: you may know a person\u2019s face, but not his heart. The Second Elder had been in seclusion these days, but such a huge incident happened in the Ye family. If both you and I died, the Ye family would naturally fall in his hands, and it is exactly because he is in seclusion that outsiders would not suspect him at all. All of this was merely his plan from long ago. You should not be blinded by his trick.\u201dYe Ling\u2019s face darkened. He would definitely not believe it if anyone said the Second Elder was disloyal. Moreover, he already knew from last night that the assassins were sent by the Great Elder. Whatever the Great Elder said today was merely to push the blame on the Second Elder.However\u2026Even though Ye Ling knew who the real murderer was, he understood the situation before him.Even if he were to say that the Great Elder was the one who hired the assassins, there would be no meaning in it at all.Ye Xun had long been on friendly terms with the Great Elder, and the Duan family would naturally stand on the Great Elder\u2019s side. Even if Ye Ling tried to reveal the Great Elder\u2019s true colors in front of everyone, the Great Elder would just take advantage of the opportunity and silence him!\u201cFather, the Great Elder is doing this for you and the welfare of the Ye family. The Second Elder has evil intentions and planned to steal the position of the Family Master. You must not care about your past friendship with him and be softhearted. Otherwise, there will be endless trouble. Even if you don\u2019t think for yourself, you should spare a thought for Tang Tang.\u201d Ye Xun said with a faked worrying tone. She was persuading Ye Ling on the surface, but in reality, she pointed out Ye Qingtang to force Ye Ling to prioritize Ye Qingtang\u2019s safety. If Ye Ling stood up for the Second Elder forcefully, they would not guarantee Ye Qingtang\u2019s safety.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As the head of the family, you should not be overly softhearted and hesitant to take necessary actions for the sake of the safety and prosperity of the family clan. The Second Elder committed such atrocity; if you insist on protecting him, not only will the Ye family suffer from embarrassment, you also endanger the other people in the family as well. I\u2019m afraid this is not what the head of the family should do\u2026\u201d a Duan family Elder said as he looked at the livid Ye Ling.\u201cI am the head of the Ye family, and the Second Elder is a member of the Ye family. I decide whether he is guilty or not. It will never be up to you, the Duan\u2019s, to interfere,\u201d Ye Ling replied coldly.\u201cUncle Ye, there is something wrong with that statement. Both the Ye family and my Duan family are part of the three greatest family clans in Lin town. If the Ye family are conniving towards this matter, won\u2019t it affect the good reputation of the Duan family, which shares the same title, as well?\u201d Duan Tianrao said.\u201cThere is no place for you to speak here,\u201d Ye Ling said with disdain.Duan Tianrao\u2019s furrowed his brows quite unhappily.Stepping forward, the Great Elder said, \u201cThe Family Master was shocked by yesterday\u2019s incident. I suppose you are in a confused state of mind today because you\u2019re not fully recovered. You\u2019ll need to rest early. Once the Second Elder is dealt with, I will bring you back to the Ye residence to recuperate. For now, you should not care so much about this as I will share your burden.\u201dImmediately after, the Great Elder gave the Elders from the Duan family a look. Since the Duan Elders were invited by the Great Elder to deal with the Second Elder from the start, they attacked him as soon as they saw the Great Elder\u2019s signal!The Second Elder\u2019s eyes darkened as he raised his hand and fought back against them without fear.Ye Ling never expected that the Great Elder would do evil so openly, and he instantly stood forward, wanting to strike at the Duan Elders.\u201cFather, you have been in poor health recently. It is better if you don\u2019t strain yourself. The Great Elder and the Daun family\u2019s Elders will take care of this matter,\u201d Ye Xun blocked Ye Ling\u2019s path.\u201cGet lost. I don\u2019t have a daughter like you.\u201d Ye Ling\u2019s voice was low and he raised his hand in an attempt to push Ye Xun away.However, Duan Tianrao stepped up at that moment and pulled Ye Xun behind him to protect her with one hand and blocked Ye Ling with the other. \u201cUncle Ye, Xun is doing this for your own good. Fights are dangerous, and it will not be good if Uncle Ye is injured.\u201d\u201cDuan Tianrao, get lost! The Duan family has no room to interfere in the Ye family\u2019s affairs,\u201d Ye Ling uttered coldly.However, Duan Tianrao remained unaffected and stood still. \u201cUncle Ye, if you\u2019re too softhearted, you\u2019ll not be a good Family Master. The Great Elder went through such trouble to help share your burden, why won\u2019t you come to your senses? In consideration of your health, I\u2019m afraid I can not let you go over.\u201dYe Ling\u2019s eyes turned sharp as he suddenly attacked Duan Tianrao.Duan Tianrao scoffed.If Ye Ling was at his peak, Duan Tianrao would definitely not be powerful enough to fight Ye Ling. However, Ye Ling\u2019s body had been weakened in recent years, and he was not as highly skilled as before. Why would Duan Tianrao need to be afraid?Then, Duan Tianrao and Ye Ling started fighting.Watching the two battle from aside, Ye Xun acted worried. \u201cFather, darling Duan, stop fighting.\u201d As she spoke, she went forward to seemingly stop the fight but was in actuality preventing Ye Ling from striking and letting Duan Tianrao gain the upper hand.On the other side, the Elders from the Duan family and the Second Elder had already been in a match. Even though the Second Elder\u2019s ability was higher, it was difficult to fight against four opponents alone. Although he had not been completely defeated yet, he had been suppressed by the Duan Elders and was unable to escape. Looking at Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun jointly attacking Ye Ling, the anger in him riled up even more. Right at the moment when he was distracted, the Great Elder sharply captured the opportunity to fly behind the Second Elder and steadily landed his palm on the Second Elder\u2019s back with a loud boom!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With unsteady breaths, he was directly pressed down on the floor by the Duan family Elders!\u201cSecond Elder, you committed an atrocity. According to the Ye family family rules, you will be executed,\u201d said the Great Elder as he walked to the front of the Second Elder and looked down at him with cold and scornful eyes.\u201cGreat Elder, you are the one who wants to steal power! You will be punished for persecuting the Ye family Elder and Family Master! The Ye family\u2019s ancestors will never let you off!\u201d At that point, the Second Elder was able to see that everything that happened was a part of the Great Elder\u2019s plan.A while ago, he had already sensed that the Great Elder had evil designs. However, he did not have concrete evidence and could not take him out.Yet unexpectedly, the Great Elder found an opportunity instead.He could only hate that he realized too late!\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Second Elder. What happens to the Ye family from now on has nothing to do with you. As a sinner of the Ye family, it is better if you just obediently go to the underworld and seek forgiveness from the Ye family\u2019s ancestors!\u201d A cold gleam of light flashed in the Great Elder\u2019s eyes. Suddenly, he raised the sharp sword in his hand and fiercely thrust at the Second Elder\u2019s crown!Ye Ling, who was blocked by Duan Tianrao and Ye Ling, drew a cold breath upon seeing the sight, and his head buzzed!However\u2026Just before the Great Elder\u2019s sword landed, a ray of light suddenly flashed before everyone\u2019s eyes.A force directly blew the sharp sword in the Great Elder\u2019s hand away!\u201cHold on!\u201dA girl\u2019s voice immediately sounded.Everyone, including Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun who were jointly attacking Ye Ling, turned their heads towards the direction of the voice.But before Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun could see who the person was, a black figure suddenly appeared in front of them, and with a flying kick, both Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun were sent flying.\u201cWho are you! How dare you touch my people from the Ye and Duan family!\u201d shouted the Great Elder.The black figure took the opportunity to stand beside Ye Ling. At that point, the person\u2019s face was finally revealed in front of everyone.\u201cSo what if I touch them? It is already merciful of me to not take their lives when they had the audacity to disrespect the Family Master of the Ye family.\u201d Ye Qingtang suddenly appeared beside Ye Ling and looked at everyone coldly with her chin raised.Everyone was stunned upon seeing Ye Qingtang.Hurriedly standing up after being kicked away by Ye Qingtang, Duan Tianrao instantly blanked out when he saw Ye Qingtang\u2019s alluring face.In the fierce wind, Ye Qingtang stood still in a red top, and her hair danced in the wind. Set against that red top, her small and flawless face was even more exquisite, capturing Duan Tianrao\u2019s heart immediately.Today, Ye Qingtang had left hurriedly and forgot to put on her veil.After rushing over at full speed, her cheeks had a slight tint of red, making her even more beautiful than when she was on the worship stage.\u201cTang Tang!\u201d Ye Ling could not help but be surprised when he saw Ye Qingtang.The fury in Ye Qingtang\u2019s eyes slowly subsided when she saw that Ye Ling was not injured.She had never expected that Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun would be so bold to attack her father.\u201cYe Qingtang, how dare you injure someone from the Duan family!\u201d The Elders from the Duan family were unhappy. Ye Qingtang had canceled the engagement with Duan Tianrao not long ago, yet now, she still dared to injure Duan Tianrao in front of them. Wasn\u2019t this a slap in their faces?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This should be counted as showing mercy,\u201d Ye Qingtang scoffed. When she saw the Duan family\u2019s Elders pressing the Second Elder on the ground, the anger that she had just suppressed a while ago started to rile up again.What a brilliant Great Elder! What a brilliant Duan family!\u201cYou, the Duan\u2019s, are seriously becoming more and more impressive. Not only do you all want to interfere in the Ye family\u2019s matters, you all still allowed the next family master of the Duan family to attack Family Master Ye? Your appetite is really getting bigger!\u201d Ye Qingtang scoffed.A Duan Elder frowned and said, \u201cThe Second Young Master did not want to offend your father intentionally. He just didn\u2019t want him to be involved and hurt himself only. The Second Elder from the Ye family committed an atrocity and plotted to murder the Family Master and Great Elder of the Ye family. As in-laws with the Ye family, in addition to Xun\u2019s close relationship with the Great Elder, of course the Duan family had to come and provide assistance.\u201d\u201cProvide assistance?\u201d Ye Qingtang\u2019s lips curled as a frown hung at the corner of her lips. \u201cYe Xun is merely an adopted daughter of the Ye family and cannot be said to be a real member of the Ye family. She does not have the right to interfere in the Ye family\u2019s matters. What more relation does the Duan family, whom she has an engagement with, have with the Ye family!\u201dYe Qingtang did not give Ye Xun any face at all as she directly trashed Ye Xun\u2019s public title as Lady Ye.In an instant, all color faded from Ye Xun\u2019s face as her hands that were hung on her side secretly balled into a fist.\u201cOr should I say that the Duan family\u2019s ambition is growing? The Ye and Duan family are both part of the three greatest family clans in Lin Town. Now that the Duan family actually overstepped their authority to interfere in the Ye family\u2019s matters, could it be that the Duan family wants to become the greatest family clan in Lin town?\u201d Ye Qingtang looked at the few Elders from the Duan family coldly as the warmth in her tone suddenly vanished.The Duan Elders\u2019 faces darkened at her words.They were requested to come here by the Great Elder to deal with the Second Elder today and had no other intention. However, Ye Qingtang\u2019s words exaggerated the Duan family\u2019s ambitions. If this were to spread, wouldn\u2019t their actions sow discord both with the Ye and within Duan family?The Elders from the Duan family frowned slightly. Looking at Ye Qingtang\u2019s charming face, they suddenly remembered.A few days ago, they had heard that Young Lady Ye was close to the Third Young Master Si and frequently visited the Si residence. If Ye Qingtang told the Si family about today\u2019s incident,won\u2019t the Duan family\u2026Then, the Duan Elders\u2019 expressions turned weird.Ye Qingtang scoffed, \u201cDuan Elders, how much longer do you want to lock our Ye Family\u2019s Second Elder?\u201dTheir faces froze. After weighing their options, they finally released their grip slowly.They did not fear Ye Qingtang, but her relationship with the Si family did make them afraid.In recent years, there had been no conflicts between the Duan and Si family. If they angered the Si family just because they helped the Great Elder with a small favor, they would lose more than they gained.Free from suppression, the Second Elder stood up immediately and took a deep breath, forcing down the surging blood in his chest. His gaze landed on Ye Qingtang and surprise filled his eyes uncontrollably.Was this still the little girl who had always cowardly hidden behind him and Ye Ling?\u201cYe Qingtang, watch how you speak to these Elders from the Duan family,\u201d uttered the Great Elder. He had never once thought that Ye Qingtang would cause his scheme to fail.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t need you to teach me how to speak to others.\u201dThe Great Elder\u2019s face sunk instantly.\u201cTang Tang\u2026 don\u2019t misunderstand. We merely had good intentions to help father to get rid of our Ye family\u2019s traitor.\u201d Ye Xun forced herself to speak and put on a kind act.Ye Qingtang looked at Ye Xun\u2019s loathsome face and said, \u201cFather? Ye Xun, are you still unclear of your identity? Who do you think you are? How dare you address my father as \u2018father\u2019? Our Ye family? What relation does the Ye family have with you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Ye Qingtang\u2019s words were like sharp blades which shaved away all of Ye Xun\u2019s pretense and dignity completely. Even for a scheming person like Ye Xun, her face went pale uncontrollably, and she could not maintain the smile on her face.\u201cQingtang, you are being too harsh. Xun grew up in the Ye family from young and would naturally want the best for the Ye family. Don\u2019t be ignorant of her good intentions,\u201d Duan Tianrao returned to his senses and could not help but defend Ye Xun.\u201cIt is not that she grew up in the Ye family. The Ye family only adopted her because we took pity on her for not having any parents. If Second Young Master Duan feels that the Ye family is not treating her right, you can bring her back to your Duan family. Our Ye family does not need any of her good intentions.\u201d Ye Qingtang said without giving Duan Tianrao any face at all.Deep down, she was already extremely disgusted with Duan Tianrao. But even if she weren\u2019t, Ye Qingtang already had the urge to destroy his bones into ashes solely based on the fact that he had attacked Ye Ling just now.In this quick exchange of words, Ye Qingtang made both Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun lose all their face while the Elders from the Duan family turned pale.\u201cToday\u2019s incident is my Ye family\u2019s matter. If there is nothing else, I will not escort you, the Duan\u2019s, any further.\u201d Ye Qingtang bluntly demanded them to leave.The people from the Duan family were completely defeated by Ye Qingtang\u2019s words and did not intend to stay on any longer. Furthermore, the Second Elder had already sustained serious injuries, and it would be easy if the Great Elder really wanted to kill him. There was no need for them to continue staying there and allow others to have a handle against them.\u201cGreat Elder, we will return first,\u201d a Duan Elder said.The Great Elder\u2019s head dropped a little, but he still nodded. With the injuries that the Second Elder suffered, he was not his opponent.The people from the Duan family left instantly. However, before they left, Duan Tianrao turned around to look at Ye Qingtang\u2019s beautiful face one more time and tried his best to convince her. \u201cQingtang, whatever the Duan family did today was all for the good of the Ye family. The Second Elder has evil intentions. If he is left alone, it would only harm the Ye family.\u201dNonetheless, Ye Qingtang did not even bother to look at Duan Tianrao, and he could only turn back and leave.After the Duan\u2019s had completely left, Ye Qingtang then turned around and walked to the Second Elder\u2019s side. Her expression softened as she smiled. \u201cSecond Uncle.\u201dLooking at the completely different Ye Qingtang before him, the Second Elder was filled with gratification.However, the Great Elder\u2019s face sunk as he said, \u201cThe Second Elder schemed to kill the Family Master and me. This matter should not be over just like that and must be dealt with according to the family rules.\u201dYe Qingtang turned to look at the sullen-looking Great Elder and replied, \u201cYou said Second Uncle is the mastermind behind the scenes. What evidence do you have?\u201d\u201cEvidence?\u201d The Great Elder scoffed. \u201cGetting rid of me and the Family Master would benefit the Second Elder the most. Who else could it be other than him?\u201dLooking at the Great Elder\u2019s strong appearance, she could not help but let out a laugh. \u201cGreat Elder\u2019s words are merely a guess and are not based on any concrete evidence. When the assassins came yesterday, I happened to be in my father\u2019s courtyard and exchanged a few blows with them. Although I could not win them, I found the word \u2018Qin\u2019 stitched inside the end of their sleeves. If I remember correctly, isn\u2019t the most famous assassin organization in Lin Town the Qin Luo Pavilion? Didn\u2019t everyone in the Qin Luo Pavilion all have such a \u2018Qin\u2019 stitched on the cuff of their sleeves?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Perhaps you can find out the real mastermind?\u201d Ye Qingtang looked at the Great Elder with a smile.At that instant, the Great Elder\u2019s face darkened to an extreme.Never in a million years did he expect that Ye Qingtang would actually notice the word at the end of the assassins\u2019 sleeves. Although those assassins had oddly betrayed the Great Elder, he could not just bring them over and confront them.After all\u2026He was the one who first hired the Qin Luo Pavilion\u2019s people to assassinate Ye Ling.Although the assassination did not succeed, if the news spreads out, he would\u2026The Great Elder\u2019s expression became increasingly uglier. He did not dare to press on the matter after Ye Qingtang mentioned the Qin Luo Pavilion and could only forcefully suppress his emotions. Faking a calm front, he said, \u201cSince you saw it yourself, I will send people to check with the Qin Luo Pavilion later. If it really is their doing, I will definitely make them hand in the real mastermind behind the scenes.\u201dThe Great Elder took a deep breath and laid his words straight.He absolutely could not let Ye Ling or the Second Elder\u2019s people head to the Qin Luo Pavilion to investigate. Otherwise, the consequences would be unbearable.\u201cSince it is so, the Second Elder is innocent before the truth is uncovered,\u201d Ye Qingtang said in a smile as she single-handedly spoiled all of the Great Elder\u2019s plans.At that instant, the Great Elder\u2019s expression was ugly as if he had eaten excrement.Failing to get rid of Ye Ling yesterday was a slip up, and Ye Qingtang\u2019s discovery of the four assassins\u2019 identity today caused him to be unable to charge the Second Elder for the crime.The Great Elder no longer wanted to say anything and merely gave a faint, undetectable nod.\u201cSince Second Uncle has ended his seclusion, we can head back now,\u201d said Ye Qingtang with a smile, which only deepened upon seeing the Great Elder\u2019s ugly expression.The Great Elder scoffed and turned around to get on the carriage without saying anything.Seeing the Great Elder\u2019s departure, the Second Elder finally opened his mouth after staying silent all this while.\u201cTang Tang, it\u2019s been so long since I last saw you, and I\u2019ve never expected that you would change so much. Now, I can finally set my mind at ease.\u201d The Second Elder looked at Ye Qingtang amiably. Both he and Ye Ling were originally worried that Ye Qingtang\u2019s personality was too cowardly and that she might not be able to manage if she were to inherit the position of family master.But now, it seemed that both of them had worried for nothing.\u201cSecond Uncle, father has ordered people to prepare good wine for you since a few days ago. This is not a good place for us to talk. How about we get on the carriage and continue our conversation there?\u201d Ye Qingtang looked at the Second Elder with genuine warmth.In her previous life, no matter how cowardly and weak she was, the Second Elder always carefully protected her. It could be said that the Second Elder had already become her family. In this life, the regret from her past life was more or less resolved now that she stopped the Great Elder from killing the Second Elder.\u201cSure! It\u2019s been long since I drank to my heart\u2019s content. I must drink my fill.\u201d the Second Elder laughed.Then, Ye Qingtang got on the carriage along with Ye Ling and the Second Elder.The carriage moved. Although the Second Elder was injured, it was nothing serious. He picked up the wine and drank to his heart\u2019s content while, in between, asking about the Ye family\u2019s situation when he was not around.When he knew that Duan Tianrao had broken off the engagement with Ye Qingtang and entered an affair with Ye Xun, his face darkened immediately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So this is why\u2026 To think that your father and I still wasted our breaths to hand you into his hands just for him to turn to another woman. Turns out he is such a heartless and unfaithful person,\u201d the Second Elder said harshly, but his expression softened when he turned to look at Ye Qingtang.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tang Tang. So what if your spirit root is gone? Your Second Uncle is here from now on. Let\u2019s see who will still dare to bully you!\u201d asserted Ye Ling.Warmth filled Ye Qingtang\u2019s heart. With both the Second Elder and Ye Ling\u2019s company, what did she need to be afraid of?\u201cFamily master, I think that the Great Elder\u2019s plans are not so simple. He already had wild ambitions from the start, and now that his granddaughter, Ye You, entered the Yunxiao Sect, he\u2019ll not settle for this much. You should be on your guard from now on. Once I return back to the residence, I\u2019ll watch him tightly as well. I want to see what more trouble he can stir up in the Ye family,\u201d said the Second Elder coldly. From the skit that the Great Elder arranged today, the Second Elder had already understood that the Great Elder had clearly tried to take the opportunity to get rid of him.\u201cNow that you\u2019re back, I can be at ease. Your injuries\u2026\u201d Ye Ling said worryingly.\u201cNo trouble. If those Elders from the Duan family fought me one on one, none of them are good enough to be my opponent. It\u2019s not so easy to inflict serious injuries on me with that little ability of theirs,\u201d replied the Second Elder.Nodding his head in relief, Ye Ling\u2019s gaze landed on his daughter, Ye Qingtang. Everything that happened today was far from his expectations. Although he knew that the Great Elder had evil designs, he did not expect the Great Elder to act so brazenly in public.Had Ye Qingtang not arrive in time today and wittily made the people from the Duan family leave, as well as scare the Great Elder, the outcome would have been disastrous.\u201cTang Tang, you have really grown up,\u201d Ye Ling said emotionally as he looked at Ye Qingtang.Ye Qingtang smiled. Looking at the faces of her father and second uncle, she made a firm decision to become powerful as it was the only way for her to protect the people she loved.The return of the Ye family\u2019s Second Elder to the residence caused quite a shock throughout the Ye family.Originally when the Second Elder was in seclusion, the Great Elder had control of the entire Ye family. But with the Second Elder\u2019s return, everyone was extremely cautious, as they were deeply aware of the fact that his ability was stronger than that of the Great Elder\u2019s.Ye Ling and Ye Qingtang were the happiest over the Second Elder\u2019s return, while the Great Elder\u2019s face became uglier by day.There were two more days to the Great Elder\u2019s birthday. Despite the terrible conflict that happened on the day when the Second Elder\u2019s ended his seclusion, this news was completely sealed away from the public.Reasonably, the Great Elder Ye\u2019s birthday celebration was a happy occasion in Lin Town. Both Ye Ling and the Second Elder were also unwilling to cause a commotion in public and temporarily put down their resentment from before. After all, they would not be able to get rid of the Great Elder without a valid reason. What they needed to do now was to wait for such an opportunity to come.\u201cGrandfather\u2026 the preparations on the residence are about done\u2026\u201d Ye Xun said respectfully as she stood in the Great Elder\u2019s room.Although the Great Elder\u2019s scheme was foiled by Ye Qingtang, there was not a slight change in his position in the Ye family. Despite the few of them turning against him openly that day, the Great Elder still appointed Ye Xun to be in charge of the preparation works for his birthday celebration.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Will sister You be able to rush back?\u201dYe You was already the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master\u2019s disciple, and her identity was different from ordinary people. If Ye You could return for the Great Elder\u2019s birthday celebration, all family clans\u2019 family masters in Lin Town needed to be extremely respectful towards Ye You, much less the Second Elder and Ye Ling.The Great Elder waved his hand. \u201cShe just entered the Yunxiao Sect, and cultivation will naturally be her main priority.\u201d He had never paid any attention to the people in the Ye family. Regardless of what he did, he was already fully prepared. Even if Ye Ling and the rest knew everything, they had no evidence and reason to counter him.He did try to send people to assassinate Ye Ling and push the blame to the Second Elder, but so what?Now, he was still the Great Elder of the Ye family, and since Ye Ling and the rest had no evidence, his position remained unshaken.\u201cNoted,\u201d Ye Xun said with an obedient nod.\u2026The Second Elder\u2019s injuries were not serious and only needed a few days to rest and recuperate. Perhaps due to the Second Elder\u2019s return, Ye Ling\u2019s complexion became better.Ye Qingtang went to the Si family in the afternoon to nurse Si Bai\u2019s body as usual.As the Second Elder and Ye Ling watched Ye Qingtang leave the Ye residence, curiosity filled the Second Elder\u2019s heart.\u201cHow did this girl establish relations with the Si family? I remember clearly that the Si family was pretty prejudiced against us, the Ye family, previously. When I returned to the residence, I think I heard that this girl and the Third Young Master Si\u2026\u201d The Second Elder looked at Ye Ling weirdly. Although Si Bai was frail, his natural talent was extremely high\u2014far higher than Duan Tianrao. If Ye Qingtang could find a good man to marry, it would put the Second Elder\u2019s heart at ease.Ye Ling let out a chuckle. \u201cI am not clear either. Tang Tang seems to have become another person after her spirit root broke. She is now much more independent and confident. I suspected her and Third Young Master Si before as well, but she vowed that nothing was going on, so I didn\u2019t ask much.\u201dThe Second Elder was deep in thought.A while later, Ye Qingtang reached the Si residence.Master Si looked at Ye Qingtang and said,\u201cI heard that the Great Elder actually invited a few Duan Elders over on the day when Second Elder Ye ended his seclusion. Is this true?\u201dYe Qingtang was a little surprised, as she never thought that Master Si would know of this incident. Without any intention to hide the truth, she nodded honestly.Master Si scoffed, \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know what exactly happened that day, but from the Great Elder Ye\u2019s actions, I can tell that he is not a simple man. It is fortunate that the Second Elder returned safely though. He has always respected your father. With him in the Ye family, the Great Elder should not be able to try anything funny.\u201dDisgust towards the Great Elder was written all over Master Si\u2019s face, and Ye Qingtang really wanted to laugh.Looking at Ye Qingtang, Master Si got down to business and said, \u201cOh, Lord Mu Su will arrive in Lin Town two days later. Where do you want to meet?\u201dJoy filled Ye Qingtang.Two days later?Wasn\u2019t that the day of the Great Elder\u2019s birthday?Ye Qingtang replied immediately, \u201cMay I trouble grandfather Si to convey to Lord Mu Su that I will be waiting for his arrival at the Ye residence two days later at night.\u201d\u201cYou want to meet Mu Su at the Ye residence?\u201d Master Si\u2019s face was full of shock when he heard it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you meet Lord Mu Su then, other people would think that Great Elder Ye has a high status.\u201d Although Master Si liked Ye Qingtang, he was still very hateful of the Great Elder Ye as before.The Ye had a high reputation in Lin Town and was one of the three greatest family clans. As such, Great Elder Ye\u2019s birthday celebration was widely discussed. Although there were still a few days left, every family clan had received an invitation long ago.Mu Su was going to meet Ye Qingtang because of the Si family. With his prestigious identity, if not for Si family\u2019s ties with him, who else in this tiny Lin Town would be able to invite Mu Su to meet them?The thought of Mu Su appearing at the Ye residence on the day of the Great Elder\u2019s birthday made Master Si unhappy instantly.Ye Qingtang laughed. \u201cGrandfather Si, just help me convey my words. I\u2019m not afraid of the Great Elder benefitting from this meetup.\u201dBenefit or disaster, it was not up to the Great Elder.\u201cThis girl\u2026 do you have any schemes up your sleeve?\u201d Master Si narrowed his eyes at Ye Qingtang as he sought to fish out an answer.However, Ye Qingtang smiled at him without saying anything.The young and old stared at each other like that for a long while, and Master Si finally admitted defeat.\u201cWhatever, I will convey your words,\u201d Master Si grunted.\u201cThank you, grandfather Si.\u201d\u201cHumph,\u201d Master Si snorted as he stood up and headed towards the inner courtyard slowly. \u201cGirl, you have too many wicked ideas. I\u2019m old and unwilling to play mind games with you, lest I get pissed.\u201dLooking at Master Si\u2019s back view, Ye Qingtang did not know whether to cry or laugh. However, she did already have a plan in mind.When dusk fell, Ye Qingtang finally left the Si residence. However, she did not go straight back to the Ye residence but headed for the Qin Luo Pavilion at the east of the town instead.\u2026Two days later on the night of the Great Elder\u2019s birthday celebration, the entire Ye residence was beautifully decorated, and an endless stream of people came to congratulate the Great Elder.\u201cThe Great Elder\u2019s birthday celebration this year is livelier than previous years,\u201d the Second Elder said without emotions as he looked at the bustling atmosphere.From aside, Ye Ling said with a faint smile, \u201cNow that Ye You has entered the Yunxiao Sect, the Great Elder\u2019s position in everyone\u2019s hearts will naturally be very high. This year is different from the previous years, and they will definitely want to come and congratulate him.\u201dThe Second Elder furrowed his brows and his expression turned weird as he looked at the Great Elder, who was being congratulated by many.\u201cYou told me that Ye You got selected by Yunxiao Sect because of her green spirit root the other time?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Ye Ling nodded.The Second Elder\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cThe Great Elder has always hidden Ye You carefully and had never revealed Ye You\u2019s spirit root in the past ten or so years. Yet\u2026 when Tang Tang\u2019s spirit root broke, his granddaughter immediately revealed that Ye You had a green spirit root afterward and that she was even selected by the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master. Don\u2019t you think\u2026 there is something strange about this matter?\u201dThe Second Elder and the Great Elder had not been on good terms for a long time. Since Ye You was the Great Elder\u2019s granddaughter, the Second Elder naturally did not ask much about her.The only thing he knew was that the Great Elder had always kept his mouth tightly shut over the quality of Ye You\u2019s spirit root. While the Second Elder did not think much of it at first, he now realized that things may have been too coincidental.Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root broke, and Ye You\u2019s spirit root was revealed soon after. Moreover, it was also a green spirit root.The Second Elder\u2019s words made Ye Ling frown as though he had thought something. However, feeling that there was something off, Ye Ling replied, \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. The fact that the Ye family produced two green spirit roots at the same time is indeed very rare, and the revelation of Ye You\u2019s spirit root did happen at a strange time, but\u2026 I\u2019ve never heard of any way to steal one\u2019s spirit root for their own use\u2026 Furthermore, Tang Tang had never said anything about this.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, when Ye Qingtang said that her spirit root broke mysteriously, he did not think otherwise anymore.\u201cPerhaps, I\u2019m thinking too much,\u201d the Second Elder said as he could not help but feel that it was a pity for Ye Qingtang.Not only was Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root of supreme quality, but she also had a talent in martial arts. If her spirit root were not broken, her accomplishments in the future would be unmeasurable.Just as the two were conversing, Ye Qingtang had already slowly walked towards them. Although today was a joyous occasion for Great Elder Ye, no one else in the Ye family other than the Great Elder\u2019s henchmen was happy.Anyway, the public attention was on the Great Elder today, so the three of them would be rather free to act without attracting much attention.\u201cFather, Second Uncle, I found some snacks from the kitchen. How about we taste it together?\u201d Ye Qingtang smiled at the Second Elder and Ye Ling.She had heard the conversation between Ye Ling and the Second Elder a while ago and could not help but feel a sense of warmth.Up until that day, she had not told them that her spirit root was stolen, as she was afraid that they would be furious after knowing and would directly attack the Great Elder. Moreover, she already had a plan in mind. Regarding certain matters, she was more willing to settle them herself.\u201cAlright.\u201d Ye Ling nodded with a smile, and the Second Elder smiled as well.Ye Qingtang took some snacks as well as she looked at the Great Elder, who was being congratulated by many in the hall.Today, the Great Elder had a ruddy complexion, and his commanding expression softened as he looked at the people who came to congratulate him.\u201cGreat Elder, you\u2019re really blessed to have such an outstanding granddaughter like Ye You. This is a blessing that others will not be able to reap even in a few lifetimes. You don\u2019t know how many people are envious over Ye You\u2019s entry into the Yunxiao Sect,\u201d the people praised.While the Great Elder maintained a calm expression, he was satisfied deep down.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Little You is still young and will still need to train hard in Yunxiao Sect. It is fortunate that the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master favor her. I can only wish her success.\u201d\u201cGreat Elder, you\u2019re too humble. With Yunxiao Sect\u2019s prestigious status, Ye You is definitely no longer the same as us commoners now that she has entered the sect.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Being a direct disciple of a sect master is an extremely rare opportunity!\u201d Another person chimed in.The news of Ye You being selected to enter Yunxiao Sect had spread throughout Lin Town. Everyone knew of the power of Yunxiao Sect and were jealous and envious of Ye You\u2019s opportunity. It was a pity that they could not make their own descendants have spirit roots as powerful as Ye You\u2019s no matter how they tried.The Great Elder was very pleased to hear the compliments and broke into a rare smile.\u201cGrandfather, darling Duan has arrived on behalf of the Duan family to congratulate you.\u201d Ye Xun, who had managed the entire celebration, walked into the hall leisurely with a finely-dressed Duan Tianrao beside her.\u201cGreat Elder, I wish you a long life. This is the present my father prepared for you,\u201d Duan Tianrao said with a smile. After he spoke, the servants who followed him immediately placed the generous presents on the table beside the Great Elder.\u201cIt was thoughtful of Master Duan. Do convey my thanks.\u201d the Great Elder nodded as his gaze landed on Ye Xun.\u201cXun, I heard that you\u2019re about to breakthrough to Connate Level Six a few days ago. Is this true?\u201dYe Xun smiled and replied, \u201cYes, grandfather. I should be able to break through to Connate Level Six in at most a month.\u201d\u201cNot bad,\u201d the Great Elder replied with a nod.\u201cXun isn\u2019t capable and is far less gifted than sister You, but I know to make up for my lack of natural talent with hard work. I can only hope to cultivate more diligently in the future to not let your previous teachings go to waste.\u201d Ye Xun was very clear that her spirit root could not be compared to Ye Qingtang\u2019s prior and Ye You\u2019s current spirit root, but she had her own method.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But for Ye Qingtang, even if Ye Qingtang\u2019s abilities were higher than hers, the improvement of abilities was highly limited since she lost her spirit root. On the other hand, Ye Xun had a perfect spirit root, and there were infinite possibilities for her growth in the future.There was still a long road ahead.Ye Xun was also very aware that Duan Tianrao placed an importance on the perfect condition of her spirit root.However beautiful Ye Qingtang was, she was still half a handicap.The Duan family would definitely not allow a girl without a spirit root to become the wife of the family master\u2019s successor.At that thought, Ye Xun\u2019s gaze landed on Duan Tianrao, whose eyes were full of praise and warmth as he returned her gaze.\u201cXun, you\u2019re already doing very well. From now on, I\u2019ll cultivate along with you and hope that we will improve together.\u201d Duan Tianrao smiled.Ye Xun nodded obediently.Just as everyone was in the middle of the celebration, the guards guarding outside the Ye residence\u2019s door entered hurriedly.\u201cFamily Master and two Elders, the City Lord of Fallen Stars City, Lord Mu Su, is at the door.\u201dSuddenly, silent gasps filled the originally bustling residence.The City Lord of Fallen Stars City, Mu Su!No one on earth was unaware of Mu Su\u2019s status.Although Fallen Stars City was also a city, it was extremely powerful. Even the emperor had to give in to Mu Su when he sees him. Mu Su\u2019s ability was immeasurable, and he served the Temple of Antiquity. Nearly no one in Lin Town was lucky enough to meet such a reputable and powerful person.However, who would have expected that Mu Su, a person who was beyond one\u2019s reach, would actually appear in Lin Town, and even on the Ye residence!Everyone\u2019s eyes looked towards the Great Elder of the Ye family uniformly.Today was the birthday of Great Elder Ye. With Mu Su\u2019s appearance at that moment, could it be that he was here to congratulate the Great Elder?It was known that there was simply no one in Lin Town that could come into contact with a powerful person like Mu Su, and even Ye You, who was just accepted into Yunxiao Sect, barely had the qualifications.\u201cGrandfather, Lord Mu Su must\u2019ve been specially invited by sister You to celebrate your birthday,\u201d Ye Xun said smilingly at the sight.The Great Elder was also shocked by the news. When he felt everyone\u2019s envious gaze, he suddenly returned to his senses and said, \u201cI\u2019ve not heard little You mention this before.\u201d\u201cSister You must\u2019ve wanted to give you a surprise. In the entire Lin Town, who else other than sister You would have such prestige to successfully invite Lord Mu Su?\u201d Ye Xun laughed.After thinking it over, the Great Elder agreed that only his granddaughter had such prestige, and his smile deepened.Mu Su\u2019s arrival did catch many by surprise.Even Ye Ling and the Second Elder who had been watching on coldly were shocked by the news.\u201cWhy would Lord Mu Su suddenly come to our Ye residence?\u201d Ye Ling was quite startled.The Second Elder, however, frowned and said, \u201cI wonder. Although our Ye family is considered a great family clan in Lin town, but when compared to Fallen Stars City, there is no competition at all. It is indeed strange for the City Lord of Fallen Stars City to visit so suddenly.\u201d\u201cCould it be that he was invited by Ye You to congratulate the Great Elder on his birthday?\u201d Ye Ling\u2019s expression turned serious.\u201cThere is only this possibility.\u201dYe Qingtang ate her pastries as she looked at the solemn expression on both her father and the Second Elder, and could not help but laugh. \u201cFather and Second Uncle, why do you two need to be so worried?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that Ye You invited him over, I\u2019m afraid that the Great Elder\u2019s attitude in the Ye family will be even more arrogant after establishing relations with Mu Su.\u201cForget it. Since he is already here, we cannot be disrespectful. Come with me to welcome Lord Mu Su.\u201d Ye Ling sighed lightly and walked into the hall with the Second Elder, ordering people to invite Mu Su into the Ye residence.However, Ye Qingtang found it funny.Ye You was able to invite Mu Su? That would simply be a joke. In her previous life, Ye You was almost beheaded by Mu Su in their first meeting.As Ye Qingtang was recollecting the incident, a handsome and tall man had already stepped into the Ye residence.The initially boisterous Ye residence had turned unusually quiet at that instant, and even the family clan disciples who were famous in Lin town retreated to a side very humbly as they looked at the incoming man with extreme reverence and fear.Taking a deep breath, the Great Elder ignored both Ye Ling and the Second Elder beside him, tidied his attire, and walked towards the impressive man respectfully.Ye Ling and the Second Elder walked up as well.Under the moonlight, Mu Su, who was walking into the residence, was tall and extraordinarily stunning with a distinguished bearing; No man in Lin Town could be compared to him. His exceptional confidence highlighted his might. Even though he was walking in slowly, his imposing aura could still be felt in the air, forcing everyone to be extremely cautious.Awe filled Duan Tianrao\u2019s eyes as he looked at Mu Su. Duan Tianrao told Ye Xun quietly, \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect that even Lord Mu Su would come to offer the Great Elder birthday congratulations today.\u201dYe Xun chuckled lightly. \u201cIn the entire Lin town, I\u2019m afraid that only sister You is able to invite Lord Mu Su. Such a big present which sister You prepared for grandfather today is indeed a pleasant surprise.\u201dOn the other side, Ye Ling had walked forward with respect and welcomed Mu Su\u2019s arrival as the family master of the Ye family.\u201cPlease forgive us for not welcoming you earlier, as we did not know you were coming!\u201dMu Su nodded nonchalantly, causing everyone to exclaim over his proud and indifferent temperament. He swept a gaze over the crowd with faked inadvertence as if he was looking for something.Eh?Where\u2019s Ye Qingtang?Confusion filled Mu Su as it did when he received the news from the Si family since he did not know what Ye Qingtang\u2019s intentions were. However\u2026 due to the pressure from someone, he would even obediently invite Ye Qingtang over with a sedan when being ordered to do so, much less going to the Ye residence to find her.The Great Elder, who was standing beside Ye Ling, felt proud as he looked at everyone\u2019s shocked faces upon seeing Mu Su. However, he did not dare to show it in front of Mu Su as well and respectfully went up to Mu Su. \u201cLord Mu Su, did my granddaughter trouble you to come here today?\u201dWhen the Great Elder said that, he purposefully glanced at Ye Ling.Granddaughter?Mu Su did not know the identity of the old man before him, but seeing that the party had a respectable position in the Ye family and was of a certain age, Mu Su reckoned that the man may be Ye Qingtang\u2019s grandfather and immediately nodded his head. \u201cYes.\u201dThat one casual word by Mu Su was like a beam of light which covered the Great Elder.After verifying his guesses, the Great Elder was even more elated and instantly felt that the birthday celebration today boosted his reputation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s really my great honor to grace your presence at this birthday celebration today thanks to the thoughtfulness of my granddaughter, Ye You.\u201d Unable to hide his smile any longer, the Great Elder was beaming, and it was clear how happy he was deep down.\u201cYe You?\u201d Mu Su sensed that something was off when he heard these two words. He frowned and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know any Ye You.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The smile on the Great Elder\u2019s face froze upon hearing what Mu Su said.\u201cLord Mu Su, didn\u2019t you\u2026 you say that you\u2019re invited here by my granddaughter, Ye You?\u201dMu Su said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m here today to find the Young Lady of the Ye family, Ye Qingtang.\u201dWith a loud clunk, everyone\u2019s jaws dropped on the floor the moment Mu Su finished speaking.More than that, the Great Elder widened his eyes in disbelief as he suspected whether he had heard wrongly.Not just the Great Elder, even Ye Ling and the Second Elder were shocked by Mu Su\u2019s words.Lord Mu Su was here to find Tang Tang?The smile on Ye Xun\u2019s face froze instantly as well.\u201cWhere is Ye Qingtang?\u201d Mu Su did not even bother about the Great Elder, whose face had an ugly expression. To him, everyone there other than Ye Qingtang was insignificant to him.A twitch played on the corner of the Great Elder\u2019s lips, but he was so shocked that he could not even utter a single word.Regaining his senses immediately, Ye Ling\u2019s eyes hurriedly looked for Ye Qingtang\u2019s figure in the crowd.Ye Qingtang slowly walked up just at the right time with everyone\u2019s gaze on her.\u201cLord Mu Su.\u201d Ye Qingtang said with poise as she walked towards Mu Su\u2019s side with the Great Elder\u2019s murderous gaze on her.Upon seeing Ye Qingtang, Mu Su was delighted immediately, though he maintained his appearance as an enigmatic, mighty figure.\u201cI heard that you wanted to meet me?\u201d Mu Su asked calmly.Ye Qingtang nodded.Everyone\u2019s expression became even more complicated.Just because Mu Su heard that Ye Qingtang wanted to meet him, he came to the Ye residence straight to find her?What great reputation she must have!Everyone was stunned.As Ye Ling and the Second Elder watched Ye Qingtang\u2019s calm interaction with Mu Su, surprise filled their eyes.Since when did Tang Tang have any interactions with Mu Su?The Great Elder\u2019s face darkened to an extreme shade of black. He thought that Ye You had brought some honor for him and was quietly proud over it for a long time, yet it turned out that\u2026 Mu Su\u2019s arrival was only because of what Ye Qingtang said!On what basis!\u201cWhat does Lady Ye need me today for?\u201d A hint of a smile could be seen on Mu Su\u2019s cold face.Although it was a slight smile, it took a huge hit on many.Lord Mu Su actually treated Ye Qingtang with such politeness even though Mu Su did not even bother to move his lips when the Great Elder spoke to him with hospitality just now.Glancing across everyone\u2019s shocked reactions and the livid-looking Great Elder, Ye Qingtang looked at Mu Su and replied, \u201cI hope that Lord Mu Su will grant my presumptuous request to recommend me to the Xuanling Sect.\u201dRight after Ye Qingtang spoke, gasps rang in the Ye residence instantly!Xuanling Sect was one of the greatest sects, and its power was remarkable. Getting into Xuanling Sect was not an easy task.In the selection to enter a sect, what was required was not an exceptional identity but a recommendation from a mighty figure of a certain level. This recommendation would not allow one to enter the sect immediately, but rather, it gave an opportunity to participate in the sect assessment. Only through passing the sect assessment would give one the qualifications to enter the sect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even after sharpening their abilities, many still could not enter a sect.Apart from his identity as the Great Elder of the Ye family, the fact that the Great Elder had such a huge reputation in Lin Town was more so due to the fact that his granddaughter, Ye You, entered a sect!Given Mu Su\u2019s identity, he indeed had the ability to recommend people to participate in the sect assessment.However, while no one dared to ask Mu Su for such a request, Ye Qingtang actually did so.Everyone thought that Ye Qingtang must have gone crazy!How would Mu Su possibly agree!Of course, Ye Qingtang knew that Mu Su would not agree to her request solely based on herself, which was why she went to the Si family in the first place.The Si family and Mu Su shared a special relationship. Furthermore, Mu Su would definitely give face to family master Si\u2014in the previous life, all three men in the Si family entered a sect due to Mu Su\u2019s recommendation.However, there was simply no one who believed that Mu Su would agree to such an abrupt request of Ye Qingtang.Initially extremely displeased, the Great Elder\u2019s expression turned from dark to bright upon hearing Ye Qingtang\u2019s request.How capable did Ye Qingtang think she was to make such a ridiculous request?Mu Su was a person of extremely high status.Being able to see him was already a great grace, but she was shameless and even wishfully thought of playing up to Mu Su for her to enter a sect!At the same time, Ye Ling\u2019s face turned white instantly. Never had he expected that his daughter would make such an abrupt and brazen request. He looked at Mu Su\u2019s reaction nervously and instinctively wanted to apologize for Ye Qingtang\u2019s bold behavior.However\u2026Upon hearing Ye Qingtang\u2019s words, Mu Su frowned slightly. Before Ye Ling even managed to plead for mercy, Mu Su said,\u201cAre you sure you want to enter Xuanling Sect? Other sects won\u2019t do?\u201dGiven his position, there was no problem recommending Ye Qingtang to a sect, but why did it have to be Xuanling Sect specifically?\u201cYes.\u201d Ye Qingtang nodded.In her previous life, she had no spirit root and finally entered Xuanling Sect after much hard work. Thus, she was very clear that the only way to really make herself stronger was to enter a sect.Furthermore\u2026 the thing she wants is only in Xuanling Sect.\u201cI agree to your request,\u201d Mu Su promised readily after thinking for a while.A simple five-worded answer was like a huge bomb which exploded in the Great Elder\u2019s mind, stunning him completely.Mu Su agreed?Mu Su actually agreed!Not only did Mu Su agree to Ye Qingtang\u2019s unbelievable request, but his tone also indicated that he would even be willing to recommend her to any other sects if she wished so.The Great Elder was furious.Everyone knew how difficult it was to enter a sect. If not, why would he need to dig out Ye Qingtang\u2019s supreme-grade spirit root for his granddaughter? All of this was to pave a beautiful future for Ye You.But now\u2026Ye Qingtang was actually able to obtain a qualification to participate in the sect assessment with just a casual statement!Although Xuanling Sect was not as huge as super sects like the Yunxiao Sect, it was still extremely noble. The Great Elder must not see Ye Qingtang obtaining an opportunity to rebound!\u201cLord Mu Su, Qingtang\u2019s spirit root is already broken and does not have a spirit root now. With such a situation, how could she enter a sect? Even with Lord Mu Su\u2019s recommendation, if this were discovered by the sects, won\u2019t it implicate you?\u201dEveryone was shocked when they heard the Great Elder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mu Su\u2019s position naturally meant he could recommend people, but if others found out he recommended a girl with no spirit root to enter a sect, it would become the biggest joke!Indeed, Mu Su was taken aback for a while.Did Ye Qingtang not have a spirit root?Standing aside aloofly, Ye Qingtang watched as the Great Elder tried hard to destroy her everything once again and sneered deep down.Then, the Great Elder reproached Ye Qingtang, \u201cQingtang, although Lord Mu Su is open-minded, you cannot act so absurdly just for your own selfish purposes. Given your condition, you would simply be unable to pass the sect assessment without a spirit root, and this will only embarrass Lord Mu Su.\u201dA complicated expression was etched on Mu Su\u2019s face. Looking at Ye Qingtang, he asked, \u201cDid your spirit root really break? Are you able to show your spirit root?\u201dShowing the spirit root was a way of materializing one\u2019s spirit root to show others by forming a replica of the spirit root in one\u2019s palm. This was used to check the quality of the spirit root. If Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root really was broken, she would definitely be unable to show her spirit root.Glancing over the Great Elder, Ye Qingtang looked at Mu Su and replied, \u201cIt did break previously, but\u2026 I can try.\u201dThen, Ye Qingtang stepped forward and raised her right hand in front of everyone.A faint light slowly gathered in Ye Qingtang\u2019s palm.\u201cShow your spirit root!\u201d cheered everyone.Then, the lingering halo in Ye Qingtang\u2019s palm gathered bit by bit, forming a tiny spirit root. Along with the formation of the spirit root was the shining of brilliant and lustrous light.The moment the spirit root was formed, it was enveloped in seven colors of lightThe grade of a spirit root could be differentiated into seven types based on the color of its halo.The seven colors of the rainbow are used as a standard.Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet. A spirit root with a color further back on the spectrum would have a higher quality.The spirit root which Ye You dug out from Ye Qingtang previously was, amongst the seven colors, a blue spirit root.Although there were indigo and violet ones above it, those two were hard to come by even in thousands of years.It could be said that a green spirit root was already extremely rare. Otherwise, Yunxiao Sect Sect Master would not have made an exception to accept Ye You as a disciple.At that instant, everyone was taken aback when they saw a tiny spirit root form in Ye Qingtang\u2019s palm.A spirit root with a red glow quietly floated on Ye Qingtang\u2019s palm. It was an extremely perfect spirit root with no traces of spoilage at all.The Great Elder was instantly shocked when he saw the red spirit root in Ye Qingtang\u2019s hand!How could this be!He clearly saw Ye Ye You personally digging out Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root with his own eyes!How could Ye Qingtang still have a spirit root?\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that Tang Tang\u2019s spirit root was broken\u2026\u201d The Second Elder looked at Ye Ling blankly. When Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root broke, he was still in seclusion. Hence, he did not know about the incident.Similarly, Ye Ling was confused. \u201cTang Tang\u2019s spirit root did break. Her original spirit root was a blue spirit root, but the current one is only a red spirit root\u2026\u201dThe breaking of a spirit root was simultaneous to destroying all hopes of cultivating the spirit root. No one had ever heard of any saying that a spirit root would regrow after breaking.Mu Su looked at the red spirit root in Ye Qingtang\u2019s palm and asked, \u201cYour spirit root really broke before?\u201dYe Qingtang nodded.Mu Su could not help but grow curious. If a spirit root broke, there was basically no possibility of rebuilding it. However, the spirit root that Ye Qingtang had shown no abnormality. Immediately remembering the real reason behind his visit today, Mu Su thought to himself and said inexplicably, \u201cThe rebuilding of lady Ye\u2019s spirit root is indeed rare. If Lady Ye has the time, why not come with me? Although I cannot tell what happened to your spirit root, there is someone who may be able to. As for the recommendation, I will agree to your request.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He simply had not thought that Ye Qingtang would have such a favorable turnaround.As for Ye Xun, who had been standing aside, she was already very shocked when she saw Ye Qingtang showing her spirit root. Now that she heard Mu Su\u2019s agreement to recommend Ye Qingtang to Xuanling Sect, her legs wobbled suddenly, and uneasiness arose from within as she instinctively turned to look at Duan Tianrao beside her.This was only to see that Duan Tianrao\u2019s brows were tightly furrowed as he locked his gaze on Ye Qingtang who was standing amongst the crowd.\u201cDarling Duan\u2026\u201dAll of a sudden, Duan Tianrao turned over to look at the uneasy Ye Xun and said with a frown, \u201cXun, didn\u2019t you tell me that Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root broke?\u201dYe Xun\u2019s face froze. \u201cHer spirit root\u2026 did break, and there\u2019s no wrong in that, but I don\u2019t know how she was able to grow a new one\u2026\u201dDuan Tianrao\u2019s frown deepened. At that point, his gaze towards Ye Xun had lost its previous affection.Initially, Duan Tianrao was so insistent on canceling his engagement with Ye Qingtang because of two reasons: Firstly, he had never seen Ye Qingtang\u2019s face, and rumors had it that she was hideous-looking; Secondly, it was because Ye Qingtang lost her spirit root, and it would be hard for her to achieve anything in cultivation in the future.However\u2026All of these were proved otherwise in front of Duan Tianrao\u2019s eyes.Not only was Ye Qingtang not ugly, she was extremely beautiful, and the originally broken spirit root actually grew back.At that very moment, fury suddenly riled up in Duan Tianrao, as he felt that he had been toyed by Ye Xun. It should be known that regardless of Ye Qingtang\u2019s appearance or the breaking of Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root, he heard all of these from Ye Xun. However, now\u2026 everything that Ye Xun told him turned out to be false.\u201cDarling Duan\u2026\u201d Ye Xun anxiously glanced at the unhappy-looking Duan Tianrao and trembled.However, Duan Tianrao turned on his heel without saying anything. While he had not left the Ye residence, it was obvious that he did not want to be entangled with Ye Xun any longer.Ye Xun was shocked.On the other side, upon hearing Mu Su\u2019s invitation, Ye Qingtang thought that it would naturally be best if she could learn more about the rebuilding of her spirit root from others since she had not seen anything like this before.However\u2026Ye Qingtang\u2019s eyes glistened slightly. There was still another good show coming up tonight, and she could not leave at that moment.\u201cThank you for your kindness, Lord Mu Su. There are many guests today, and as the Young Lady of the Ye family, I should not be a poor host. If Lord Mu Su doesn\u2019t mind, can I head there a while later?\u201d Ye Qingtang asked.How could Mu Su put Ye Qingtang on the spot? He was already very satisfied when he heard her agreement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since lady Ye still has things to deal with, do settle them first,\u201d said Mu Su, who then passed Ye Qingtang a note with the address of his lodging. \u201cI\u2019ll take my leave first.\u201d\u201cThank you, Lord Mu Su.\u201dWith a slight nod, Mu Su left without staying any longer, as he prepared to notify his highness in advance that he had bluffed Ye Qingtang over.Mu Su came suddenly and left hurriedly, but none of the guests dared to say anything. Even after Mu Su left, everyone was still in a trance.Ye Ling finally regained his senses as he watched Mu Su leave. Along with the Second Elder, he immediately pulled Ye Qingtang to a side and said with a small frown, \u201cTang Tang, what is going on exactly?\u201dLooking at the shocked yet happy expression on her father\u2019s and second uncle\u2019s faces, Ye Qingtang chuckled, \u201cFather, second uncle, as you have seen, my spirit root regrew. Although it is not comparable to my original one, there is still a chance. Isn\u2019t it a good thing that Lord Mu Su is willing to recommend me to Xuanling Sect?\u201dYe Ling and the Second Elder were made speechless by Ye Qingtang\u2019s question. They were definitely happy that Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root regrew, and it would be even better if she could enter a sect.Although there were thousands of questions in their heads, both of them knew that tonight was not the time to talk much, and, thus, they did not ask any further.On the other side, the Great Elder, who had witnessed the entire incident, no longer had any birthday excitement. His face darkened while his eyes sharpened as he looked at Ye Qingtang who was facing the other way.\u201cGrandfather\u2026\u201d Ye Xun quietly walked to the Great Elder\u2019s side with a complicated expression in her eyes.\u201cXun, come here with me for a while,\u201d the Great Elder said solemnly when he saw Ye Xun. He turned on his heels and walked toward his study room without caring about the guests at the birthday celebration.Looking at the Great Elder\u2019s unhappy expression, they more or so understood the situation.Previously, everyone thought that Mu Su came because of Ye You, but after such a huge blunder was created, the extent of hospitality that the Great Elder showed before was seen as a joke now.Regardless of their position, no one was happy over this incident.At that point, the Great Elder was in an extremely bad mood. He brought Ye Xun into the study room with a dark expression, and after shutting the door, he told Ye Xun straight, \u201cXun, make a trip to Yunxiao Sect immediately.\u201dYe Xun was a little taken aback.The Great Elder said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not possible to get rid of Ye Qingtang in Lin Town now that she established relations with Mu Su. However, if she really enters Xuanling Sect, it will be a big disaster to little You.\u201dYe Xun nodded as she faintly guessed the Great Elder\u2019s intention.Ye Qingtang\u2019s original spirit root was stolen by Ye You. If this incident spreads, it would only be a blotch in Ye You\u2019s life.\u201cGrandfather wants me to tell sister You about this news?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d The Great Elder said. \u201cI\u2019ll order people to hurry and send you to Yunxiao Sect. When you see little You, you must tell her everything about Ye Qingtang honestly. She has entered Yunxiao Sect already, and if we want to deal with the current Ye Qingtang, only she would be able to.\u201d\u201cYes, Xun will definitely remember grandfather\u2019s orders,\u201d Ye Xun replied obediently. However, she had her own plan in mind.Duan Tianrao showed obvious dissatisfaction towards Ye Xun just now, and if Ye Qingtang entered a sect and obtained a breakthrough on her cultivation, Duan Tianrao would only hate Ye Xun even more, and it would be more difficult for her to marry into the Duan family.If Ye Qingtang died in Xuanling Sect, Duan Tianrao would naturally not have any other thoughts.After all, a dead person would not be valid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, she left the hall alone.However, just when Ye Qingtang stepped out of the hall, a figure suddenly appeared in front of her.Ye Qingtang raised her brows as she looked at Duan Tianrao, who had been blocking her way for who knows how long, with a sneer.\u201cSecond Young Master Duan, what are you doing?\u201d Ye Qingtang said.Duan Tianrao watched Ye Qingtang with a complex expression. As her exquisite face entered his sight, discontent arose once again.\u201cTang Tang, I wish to talk to you about something.\u201dYe Qingtang could not even be bothered with Duan Tianrao, but on second thought, she wore a smile on her face and said, \u201cI was about to take a walk in the backyard. If Second Young Master Duan has anything to say, how about coming along with me?\u201dUpon hearing that, Duan Tianrao was immediately elated. During the worship ceremony long ago when Ye Qingtang revealed her face, Duan Tianrao was already regretful. However, after considering the fact that Ye Qingtang did not have a spirit root and that it would be difficult for her to become the mistress of the Duan family, his regret was then slightly suppressed.However\u2026When he saw for himself Ye Qingtang showing her spirit root and that Mu Su agreed to her request for a recommendation to Xuanling Sect, his regret crashed onto his chest like huge waves.He was originally worried that Ye Qingtang would bear a grudge towards him due to his cancellation of engagement previously, but he immediately relaxed when he saw her smiling at him.Yes\u2026Even though he backed out of the engagement with her previously, how would he not know of Ye Qingtang\u2019s infatuation with him over all these years?It seemed that she still had feelings for him despite the fact that she was being angry.\u201cOf course. It\u2019s been long since I took a walk with you, Tang Tang,\u201d Duan Tianrao said with no hint of objection as he flashed her a smile.After she took a look at Duan Tianrao who was full of praises towards himself, a look of disdain appeared in Ye Qingtang\u2019s eyes as she headed straight towards the backyard without saying much.Duan Tianrao followed her immediately.Compared to the boisterous front courtyard, the garden at the back of the Ye residence seemed much more silent.The faint moonlight cast on the flowers made it seem as though everything here was enveloped in a layer of pale light.Walking beside Ye Qingtang, Duan Tianrao looked at Ye Qingtang\u2019s alluring face under the moonlight and could not help but feel a stir in his heart as infatuation filled his eyes.Although Ye Xun was pretty, there was no way her beauty could be compared to Ye Qingtang\u2019s.\u201cTang Tang, I still remember that we used to play together when we were young. You were very timid and unwilling to leave the Ye residence then, so I frequently came to the Ye residence to accompany you. You liked the foxtail lily from outside the city, so I personally picked them to gift you, and you liked it for a long time\u2026\u201d Duan Tianrao could not help but recount the times spent with Ye Qingtang previously.Now that Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root was rebuilt and that she even obtained a chance to enter a sect, Ye Xun definitely could not be compared to her.Ye Qingtang nodded insincerely though she secretly swept a gaze across the surrounding walls of the courtyard.Duan Tianrao did not feel that Ye Qingtang was putting him off and continued rambling on alone, \u201cWe were so close then, and I thought, it would also be a blessing if I could coax you every day just like this.

Why don\u2019t I understand what you\u2019re saying?\u201d Ye Qingtang did not even listen to anything Duan Tianrao was talking about just now and found it funny to see Duan Tianrao\u2019s expression.\u201cTang Tang, you\u2019re indeed still blaming me. I admit that I was wrong to cancel our engagement because you broke your spirit root, but you\u2019re in my heart. I just had no choice\u2026 I had to consider for the Duan family. But, it is different now that you regrew a spirit root. Although it\u2019s just a red spirit root, I don\u2019t mind it. Can we start over again?\u201d Affection was written all over Duan Tianrao\u2019s handsome face.However, in Ye Qingtang\u2019s ears, those words sounded like a big fat joke.Ye Qingtang pushed Duan Tianrao\u2019s hand away directly and calmly tidied her sleeves which were wrinkled from his grasp. \u201cWatch your actions, Second Young Master Duan. You already have an engagement with Ye Xun, don\u2019t think about anything else.\u201dUpon hearing that, Duan Tianrao could not help but be happy. Ye Qingtang was indeed jealous about him and Ye Xun, and this meant that she still cared about him in her heart.At that instant, Duan Tianrao anxiously swore by the god, \u201cTang Tang, as long as you say it, I will immediately cancel my engagement with Ye Xun. I was originally yours. There\u2019s really nothing between me and Ye Xun.\u201dYe Qingtang could not help but roll her eyes at Duan Tianrao. Perhaps, only he could say such shameless words.Nothing between him and Ye Xun?If they sealed an engagement when there was nothing between them, then would not there be kids crawling all over the floor if there were anything?However, Ye Qingtang did not even want to bother with Duan Tianrao\u2019s pretentious affection and was simply too lazy to reply to him.Just when Duan Tianrao wanted to try harder in persuading Ye Qingtang to start afresh with him, four figures suddenly flipped over the walls of the Ye residence\u2019s courtyard and entered the place.Ye Qingtang\u2019s eyes glistened as a hint of laughter flashed in her eyes.Finally here.The four black shadows landed and had an understanding look in their eyes when they saw Ye Qingtang but were slightly surprised when they saw Duan Tianrao beside Ye Qingtang.Secretly casting them a look, Ye Qingtang went forward immediately and said coldly, \u201cWho are you? How dare you barge into my Ye residence without permission!\u201dThe four men in black regained their senses and instantly took out the sharp swords on their waists after exchanging a look.\u201cYou\u2019re Ye Qingtang?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Ye Qingtang said.\u201cVery good, someone paid us to take your life. Don\u2019t blame us for being heartless. Today is the day you die,\u201d one of the men sneered. Suddenly, the four men charged forward with their swords and attacked Ye Qingtang.\u201cTang Tang, be careful!\u201d A thought emerged as he saw the four men charging towards Ye Qingtang. He was still troubled over how to change Ye Qingtang\u2019s mind about their relationship, and now that these four people threw themselves here, it happened to be an opportunity for him to save the damsel in distress.Then, Duan Tianrao took out the sword from his waist and blocked in front of Ye Qingtang, entering a fight with the four men in black.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll hold them back!\u201d Duan Tianrao said righteously.Ye Qingtang feigned panic, but there was only a cold snicker in her eyes.The four men in black and Duan Tianrao went in circles continuously, but Duan Tianrao was not hurt at all. Thinking that they were not his opponents, Duan Tianrao sought the opportunity to show off.Ye Qingtang watched the four men, who had not shown their true powers, coldly and took the opportunity to give one of the men a hand signal to attack ruthlessly when Duan Tianrao was not looking.The four people, who still had worries initially, changed their attacks drastically upon seeing Ye Qingtang\u2019s hand signal.In an instant, Duan Tianrao, who was managing the fight well previously, lost his advantage, and injuries scattered over his body.The fighting became louder and louder, traveling out of the backyard. Seeing that some flames moved from the front courtyard and neared them, Ye Qingtang knew that the battle had drawn the attention of the people in the front courtyard.Then, Ye Qingtang withdrew all coldness from her eyes and made the panic on her face more obvious.Duan Tianrao did not even know how the four men suddenly became so powerful. With cuts all over his body, he did not even bother to look elegant anymore and could only fight back battered. He glanced at an \u201coverly shocked\u201d Ye Qingtang and hurriedly said, \u201cTang Tang, hurry and call someone here! These people are here to kill you!\u201dOnly then did Ye Qingtang \u201crealize what was going on\u201d and \u201cregained her senses\u201d as she headed towards the front courtyard to seek help.However, in the front courtyard, Ye Ling and the rest had heard the fighting sounds long ago and headed towards the direction of the sound hurriedly. At the entrance of the backyard, the group of people saw Ye Qingtang coming to \u201ccall for reinforcement\u201d.\u201cTang Tang, what happened exactly?\u201d Ye Ling anxiously walked forward when he saw his own daughter and only sighed in relief after ascertaining that there was nothing wrong with Ye Qingtang.\u201cFather! Someone wants to kill me. Second Young Master Duan is fighting with those assassins!\u201d Ye Qingtang said with a face full of \u201cnervousness\u201d.Everyone was stunned when they heard it.Who would be so bold to plot to kill the Young Lady of the Ye family in the Ye residence?Upon hearing her words, Ye Ling was even more alarmed. The Great Elder arranged for the assassins to murder Ye Ling previously. Could it be that the incident today was intentionally arranged by the Great Elder again?\u201cWhat audacity! How dare they revolt in my Ye residence!\u201d The Second Elder scoffed and rushed to the backyard at high speed.Ye Ling and the group of guests headed there along with Ye Qingtang.In the backyard, the smell of blood filled the air. From afar, everyone saw that Duan Tianrao was fighting the four men unceasingly under the moonlight. Duan Tianrao was clearly not the four men\u2019s opponents, as his elegant clothes were stained red with blood!\u201cHow dare you!\u201d The Second Elder shouted coldly, and with a leap, he brought a group of Ye family\u2019s guards and cornered the four men.Duan Tianrao, who had long been soaked in cold sweat, panted heavily when reinforcements finally came.\u201cAre you alright, Young Master Duan?\u201d Ye Ling asked as he looked at the heavily-injured Duan Tianrao with a frown.\u201cI\u2019m fine. These bastards are here to kill Tang Tang. Uncle Ye must catch them,\u201d Duan Tianrao acted as though he was alright, but in reality, he was breaking out in cold sweat profusely from the pain. Feigning a front, he looked at Ye Qingtang with loving eyes.\u201cAs long as Tang Tang is alright, I will be at ease.\u201dYe Qingtang secretly sneered when she saw Duan Tianrao\u2019s pose.However, Duan Tianrao was pretty \u201cgood with words\u201d as he said everything that Ye Qingtang wanted to say initially, saving her the trouble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he just reached the backyard, he saw a group of guests clustering around. He frowned and went over.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d the Great Elder asked unpleasantly.Ye Qingtang saw the Great Elder walking over and smiled secretly. Before she could explain, Duan Tianrao, who was supported by a servant, spoke to the Great Elder first. \u201cGreat Elder, someone wanted to murder Tang Tang tonight.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d the Great Elder was stunned. There was someone else who wanted to kill Ye Qingtang?The Great Elder smiled in his heart the next moment.It seemed like Ye Qingtang was in trouble with someone else, and that was why someone sent assassins to kill her. Such a pity that they did not manage to kill her. If not, it would have` saved me a lot of trouble. The Great Elder thought.However, the Great Elder\u2019s face still appeared normal and said in a majestic manner, \u201cHow could such a thing happen? Have you caught the assassins?\u201d\u201cThe Second Elder have subdued them, and Uncle Ye is going to interrogate them soon.\u201d Duan Tianrao said.The Great Elder nodded and walked forward. He stared at the four men in black who were fighting with the Second Elder and the bodyguards.\u201cAre they the assassins?\u201d the Great Elder asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Duan Tianrao was eager to save his image in front of Ye Qingtang.\u201cI was with Tang Tang just now at the backyard to view the moon. The four men suddenly appeared and demanded to kill Tang Tang. If not because of me, I\u2019m afraid that she might\u2019ve been killed here today.\u201dYe Qingtang stared at Duan Tianrao silently. Witnessing how he wanted to take the credit, Ye Qingtang just twitched her mouth and did not expose his lies. Instead, she appeared shocked and helped to explain, \u201cSecond Junior Master Duan is right. The four men were here for me. If Second Junior Master Duan didn\u2019t save me, I don\u2019t think I would still be alive now.\u201dThe Great Elder frowned. He really wished that the four assassins had killed Ye Qingtang. However, as the Great Elder of the Ye family, he could only act fierce in front of all the guests and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe there is such a person in Lin Town who dares to ignore the power of our Ye family.\u201dThe Great Elder then stepped forward and decided to kill the four assassins with the Second Elder.However\u2026The four men who were fighting with the Second Elder suddenly exchanged glances with each other after noticing the appearance of the Great Elder.Before the Great Elder could attack them, the four men suddenly shouted, \u201cGreat Elder, what are you planning to do?\u201dThe Great Elder had planned to take down the four assassins perfunctorily. However, he did not expect that the four men would call him. He was stunned for a moment.\u201cYou want to kill us now to keep your secrets?\u201d The leader of the men in black stared unpleasantly at the Great Elder.Everyone in the surrounding all looked towards the Great Elder after the man finished his words.What happened?Kill them to keep the Great Elder\u2019s secret?The assassins that were here to kill Ye Qingtang knew the Great Elder?The Great Elder could not figure out what was going on. After hearing what the men had said, he immediately rebuked, \u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you talking about? I don\u2019t know you at all. Don\u2019t frame me for trying to kill you for my secret!\u201dThe man sneered, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that you are this kind of person, Great Elder.

What just happened?Ye Ling\u2019s face suddenly changed. Given what happened previously, he believed that it was highly possible that the Great Elder sent these assassins.The Second Elder also stopped. He frowned and looked towards the Great Elder.The Great Elder was stunned.He did not send anyone to kill Ye Qingtang. Why would these assassins frame him for that?\u201cFull of nonsense! As the Great Elder, why would I hire assassins to kill the Young Lady of the Ye family!\u201dA hint of a smile appeared in Ye Qingtang\u2019s eyes after witnessing the situation. She went forward and said, \u201cHow dare you frame the Great Elder! He is a member of the Ye family. Why would he send people to kill me? From what I see, you are just framing someone since your plan failed. If you don\u2019t tell us the real people behind this, I\u2019m afraid none of you will make it out of here alive!\u201dThe Great Elder was surprised, as he did not expect that Ye Qingtang would speak up for him.The four men in black exchanged glances once again and said, \u201cLady Ye, the Great Elder is the person behind all of this. If you don\u2019t believe us, I have the letter that the Great Elder sent us.\u201dThe man in black then took out a letter. \u201cI can give you the letter, but you must let us leave here today.\u201dYe Qingtang did not reply immediately and looked towards the Great Elder.The Great Elder frowned slightly. He had nothing to be afraid of as he did not send anyone to kill Ye Qingtang.\u201cOkay, I promise you.\u201d Ye Qingtang replied.The man in black then threw the letter in front of everyone.Ye Qingtang picked the letter up and opened it to read together with Ye Ling and the others.The Great Elder appeared to be very confident without any guilt.However\u2026Ye Ling\u2019s face darkened after reading the letter. He then raised his eyes and stared at the Great Elder.\u201cGreat Elder! Why do you want to murder my daughter!\u201dThe Great Elder, who had nothing to be afraid of, was suddenly stunned.\u201cMaster, what are you talking about?\u201dYe Lin then shared the letter with the rest of the people. It was clearly written on the letter that he offered ten thousand gold to assassins to take Ye Qingtang\u2019s life.Furthermore, it was signed by the Great Elder.\u201cThis must be forged!\u201d the Great Elder frowned and said.\u201cForged? This is clearly your handwriting and the seal that belonged to you only. No one could ever forge it!\u201d Ye Ling challenged the Great Elder.All the guests went forward and took a look at the letter. They received invitation cards a few days before the celebration for the Great Elder. Every invitation card had the Great Elder\u2019s seal. The seal looked exactly the same as the one on the letter.Everyone suddenly looked towards the Great Elder in surprise.It was possible to imitate the handwriting, but no one could ever imitate the seal that only belonged to the Great Elder. The seal never left the Great Elder as well. The seal on the letter was clearly stamped by the Great Elder himself.The Great Elder\u2019s face clouded. He stared at the letter.

The content of the letter was written by himself. However, this letter was the one that he had sent to the Qin Luo Pavilion. The letter was meant to ask Qin Luo Pavilion to assassinate Ye Ling. Why\u2026 Why did the target now become Ye Qingtang?The Great Elder was shocked and immediately looked at Ye Qingtang.People from the Qin Luo Pavilion were requested to assassinate Ye Ling that day, but instead, they came to kill him halfway. The Great Elder had sensed that something was not right back then. Now, he took a closer look at the four people here. They had the same figures as the four assassins the other day!Was it possible that the four people had pledged their loyalty to Ye Qingtang? And everything happened today was arranged by her?However, even though the Great Elder had figured everything out, he also could not explain the origin of the letter. Ultimately, the letter\u2019s target was the Master of the Ye family clan, Ye Ling.It was a serious crime to assassinate either Ye Qingtang or Ye Ling!\u201cGreat Elder intended to murder the heir of the family master. Take him down, now!\u201d Ye Ling commanded.When Ye Ling finished his words, the Second Elder began his attack towards the Great Elder.The Great Elder did not expect this development. He could only fight back when the Second Elder attacked.Everyone in the Ye family now was in a mess. The guests were here to celebrate the birthday of the Great Elder. They could not imagine that they had just witnessed the Great Elder sending assassins to kill the Young Lady of the Ye family. Furthermore, it was even more terrible that the Great Elder was exposed here.The guests could not help but recall the Great Elder\u2019s behaviors recently. Majority of the people knew about the Great Elder\u2019s ambition towards the position as the family master. Ye Ling\u2019s health had been deteriorating and might pass away soon. It would make sense that Ye Qingtang, being the only heir of the family, would become the target that the Great Elder intended to wipe off.Duan Tianrao did not expect that everything that happened today was arranged by the Great Elder. He was totally stunned by the mess in front of him.In ordinary circumstances, the Great Elder\u2019s strength was less than that of the Second Elder. However, the Second Elder was hurt by the Great Elder and the Elders from the Duan family from when he finished his seclusion. Now, their abilities were comparable.The Great Elder raged as he did not expect that he would be framed by Ye Qingtang. Even though the Second Elder was injured, his strength was still above the Great Elder\u2019s. If they continued to fight, the Great Elder might die here today.During the fight, the Great Elder\u2019s sight landed on Ye Qingtang, who was standing in the crowd. When he was separated from the Second Elder for a short second, he rushed towards Ye Qingtang and intended to keep her as his hostage.The Great Elder\u2019s movements were unpredictable. At the split second when the Great Elder attacked, even Ye Qingtang could not react on time.Ye Qingtang dodged immediately when she saw the Great Elder rushing towards her. She avoided the attack by the Great Elder, but her outer clothes were ripped apart by the Great Elder\u2019s fingers.The lightning dragon egg that Ye Qingtang hugged fell to the ground as her clothes were torn.Ye Qingtang frowned as her dragon egg cracked on the ground. Before she could feel sad for the egg, the Great Elder dashed towards her for the second attack.However\u2026A few cracking sounds could be heard among the commotion. The eggshell was falling off piece by piece from the cracked lightning dragon egg. Before anyone could react, a shadow rushed out of the cracked egg and dashed towards the Great Elder!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could hear his head ringing, and his body flew out from the great force on his head.However, the shadow did not plan to let him go that easily. It chased after the Great Elder and beat him heavily before the Great Elder even landed. The audience could only see lightning sparks in the sky as they were dazzled by the speed.Everyone was astonished by the things happening in front of them. Even the Second Elder and Ye Ling, who were here to save Ye Qingtang, were also stunned.Ye Qingtang froze on the spot. She stared at the shadow that came out from the lightning dragon egg beating the Great Elder continuously.What was that?Ye Qingtang felt muddled. She looked down at the dragon egg on the ground. The dragon egg was empty now. There was only a shattered eggshell at the bottom of the egg.The egg is empty\u2026 Is it possible that\u2026 Ye Qingtang thought.Ye Qingtang raised her head and looked towards the shadow that was fighting with the Great Elder. At that moment, the shadow finally slowed down. Ye Qingtang could see the face of the shadow clearly.That was a\u2026 more accurately\u2026 a baby\u2026It seemed to be two to three years old with a pure and pink face. There was a pair of blue-black horns on its head. On its butt\u2026 a tail with dragon scales was swinging according to the baby\u2019s movements\u2026What\u2026What was that?!Ye Qingtang was totally stunned now. She first thought that it was the lightning dragon that came out of the egg. However, the little dragon man with dragon horns and tail really surprised her.She did not hear about a lightning dragon with a human form in her previous life at all.The little figure was round and cute. Its face was chubby and pinkish, and its dark green eyes squinted in danger. The Great Elder almost vomited blood from the beating from the dragon\u2019s seemingly soft fists.Ye Qingtang questioned herself for the first time whether she had missed some information in her previous life.While Ye Qingtang was still stunned, the Great Elder was almost beaten to death.The little figure was shorter than the Great Elder\u2019s leg, but it was extremely fierce. Its strength was so great that it could press the Great Elder on the ground. Every ferocious punch caused him great pain and suffering. Even a grown-up man\u2019s strength could not match with ten percent of its strength!The Second Elder, who had wanted to take down the Great Elder, was also astonished by the little baby\u2019s cruelty.Even if the Great Elder had iron skins and bones, he could not defend himself against the little baby. He tried to escape several times, but just when he lifted his head, he was hit back onto the floor, making loud sounds.The Great Elder\u2019s bones were almost all fractured from the beating. The little dragon man suddenly jumped and used its tail to slap the Great Elder\u2019s head. The hit was as heavy as a stone and slapped the last consciousness out of the Great Elder. Blood spurted out of his mouth. He rested flat on the ground as he could not move anymore.\u201c\u2026\u201d Ye Qingtang was speechless.That was cruel!The little figure stopped in contentment when he saw the Great Elder could not move anymore. It suddenly turned its head back and looked towards Ye Qingtang, who was astonished at the side, with its dark green eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The little dragon man blinked towards Ye Qingtang and ran towards her with its short legs.The little figure who beat the Great Elder heavily was shaking its tiny tail, standing in front of Ye Qingtang. Everyone stared at it in surprise. Its hands were placed in front of its body, and it looked at Ye Qingtang with its big eyes, trying to please her.\u201cMother! Mother! I help you to beat the bad guy! Am I a good boy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMother?!Ye Qingtang stared at the weird little figure in front of her. She was totally confused.She only heard that birds would treat the first living being they saw as their parents. She did not know that the noble lightning dragon also had such a habit.The little figure did not know what Ye Qingtang was thinking about. It simply raised its head and swung its tail, staring at her with hope. It looked cute and innocent now which was totally different from how it looked when beating the Great Elder just now.\u201cHmmmm\u2026 Yes.\u201d Ye Qingtang took a deep breath to suppress her confusion.The little figure shook its tail in delight after being complimented.Ye Qingtang touched her forehead. The things that happened just now were totally out of her imagination. However, it was not the right time to think about that. She then immediately walked towards Ye Ling.The little figure followed her tightly. Its big eyes stared at Ye Qingtang, and it smiled delightfully.Mother~ mother~ He could finally appear in front of its mother now\u2026However\u2026 the little figure lowered its head and stared at its tiny claws. Pieces of dragon scales were nearly visible on the white skin.Surely, this would not work.Only the child of his mother and the man could bear with his powerful consciousness. The lightning dragon was indeed strong, but if he stayed within it for too long, the dragon itself would die soon.He would not have taken over the lightning dragon\u2019s body if his mother was not threatened.Ye Qingtang\u2019s memory was correct: normal dragons could not turn into a human form. She did not know that the round little figure was the small black ball bred from the Heart of the Demon God.\u201cTang Tang\u2026 What\u2019s this\u2026\u201d Ye Ling was totally confused by the weird little figure in front of him.What was that?!\u201cI\u2019ll explain to you later, father. Now, we need to know how we should deal with the Great Elder.\u201d Ye Qingtang took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down.Ye Ling nodded slightly. The Second Elder had caught the Great Elder, who was lying on the ground. He held him and walked towards Ye Qingtang.Ye Qingtang did not speak to the Great Elder immediately. Instead, she turned and spoke to the guests. \u201cI am so sorry for what happened just now. I shall invite all guests to return to their respective homes as we have some family matters to deal with here.\u201dNo one was willing to stay anymore. The things that happened at the Ye family tonight were too complicated, and no one wished to be part of it. All guests left after Ye Qingtang finished her words.\u201cTang Tang, today, I was\u2026\u201d Duan Tianrao looked at Ye Qingtang with concern.However, Ye Qingtang remained expressionless and said, \u201cThank you, Young Master Duan. I shall ask someone to send you back.\u201dDuan Tianrao was stunned slightly. He felt uneasy as he saw how expressionless Ye Qingtang was to him.\u201cTang Tang, I am alright. What do you think of the words I said to you earlier? As long as you give your consent, I\u2019ll talk to my father tonight to resume our engagement.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s not meet again in the future.\u201d With that, Ye Qingtang ordered someone to help Duan Tianrao out without giving him any chance to redeem himself.Astonishment was written all over Duan Tianrao\u2019s face as he looked at the merciless Ye Qingtang. He simply could not believe what he heard. However, he did not have any more chances and was sent out of the Ye residence.In the backyard of the Ye residence, there was only Ye Qingtang, the little dragon man, Ye Ling, the Second Elder, the four assassins, and the Great Elder, who was being carried by the Second Elder.\u201cAll of them have left. Can we also leave now then?\u201d the leader of the men in black asked.Ye Ling frowned lightly.However, Ye Qingtang chuckled, \u201cThank you for your help today. I\u2019ll definitely send the follow-up payment to the Qin Luo Pavilion tomorrow. Do return.\u201dThe four assassins immediately replied in smiles, \u201cDon\u2019t mention it Lady Ye. If you have any requests in the future, the Qin Luo Pavilion will definitely be willing to serve you. We\u2019ll take our leave now.\u201dThen, the four assassins leaped over the walls and left.The conversation between Ye Qingtang and the four assassins traveled into the ears of Ye Ling and the rest word for word.\u201cYe Qingtang, it was indeed you. How dare you join forces with the Qin Luo Pavilion to frame me!\u201d The Great Elder widened his eyes suddenly and shot a deadly glare at Ye Qingtang, who had plotted everything. The rage in his eyes made it seem as though he wanted to eat Ye Qingtang up alive.Ye Ling and the Second Elder were similarly in shock. They really thought that those four assassins were sent over by the Great Elder, yet\u2026 it was all a show that Ye Qingtang directed.Ye Qingtang looked at the Great Elder with a grin.\u201cFrame? Great Elder, you\u2019re such a smooth talker. Didn\u2019t you handwrite this letter and hand it to the Qin Luo Pavilion? I merely changed two words only.\u201d Ye Qingtang waved that letter in front of the Great Elder.\u201cYou!\u201d The Great Elder glared at Ye Qingtang with gritted teeth.Ye Qingtang sneered, \u201cGreat Elder, you committed all sorts of evil crimes. Yes, I did frame you, but so what? Now, the entire Lin Town will know that you, the Great Elder, plotted to kill me. Do you think you\u2019ll still be the Great Elder of the Ye family?\u201d\u201cGreat Elder, you plotted to kill the successor of the family master and have committed a serious offense. According to the family rules, you should be executed immediately.\u201d laughed Ye Qingtang.The Great Elder glared at Ye Qingtang with hatred and scoffed, \u201cExecuted? Just by you all? My granddaughter is now the disciple of Yunxiao Sect Sect Master, which one of you dare to kill me!\u201dYe Ling and the Second Elder\u2019s hearts sank when they heard the Great Elder\u2019s words.Ye Qingtang\u2019s scheme today did cause the Great Elder to violate the family rules in front of everyone, and he should be executed. But\u2026 behind the Great Elder, there was still Ye You.If Ye You heard about this incident, she would not take things lying down.Ye You was already a direct disciple of the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master. If he called her back\u2026However, Ye Qingtang was not at all affected by the Great Elder\u2019s words and merely beamed at him, \u201cSorry but, after you die, I will tell everyone that although you committed a serious offense, the Ye family was benevolent to only take back your position as the Great Elder and lock you up temporarily on the account that you have served the Ye family for many years. No one will know that you\u2019re already dead. Furthermore, your granddaughter, Ye You, is far away in Yunxiao Sect and will not return to Lin Town in the coming few years. How will she know whether you\u2019re dead or alive?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Never had he thought that he would be defeated by an ignorant little girl.\u201cGreat Elder, he who is unjust is doomed to death. Take care.\u201d Ye Qingtang was simply too lazy to say anything more to the Great Elder. With a drawing of her sword, she slashed the Great Elder\u2019s neck.Until death, the Great Elder could not believe that all his plans would end up in this state. When he finally took his last breath, the Second Elder threw the Great Elder\u2019s corpse on the floor with a blank expression.Watching the Great Elder die in front of her, Ye Qingtang did not feel anything at all.In this life, she needed to protect the people around her and not let tragedy repeat itself.Although the Great Elder was dead, this news was to be hidden from the public; thus, Ye Ling and the Second Elder had to get rid of the corpse without any traces.\u201cFather, you and second uncle will settle the Great Elder\u2019s incident. I still need to make a trip to Lord Mu Su\u2019s,\u201d Ye Qingtang said.Ye Ling nodded, and emotions overran him as he looked at his daughter before him.He always felt that his daughter had matured a lot in this period of time.\u201cNow that you\u2019re all grown up and have your own way of doing things, I am very heartened. I only hope that you\u2019ll be safe. When you meet Lord Mu Su, you must be more courteous,\u201d Ye Ling said.\u201cYes.\u201d Ye Qingtang nodded.Ye Ling smiled in gratification, but his gaze uncontrollably landed on the little fellow beside Ye Qingtang.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dYe Qingtang rubbed her temples slightly and recounted the incident where she went to search for the lightning dragon egg.Ye Ling and the Second Elder had never seen any dragon species before and did not know anything about the dragon clan, much less about a dragon turning into a human.Listening to Ye Qingtang\u2019s conversation with Ye Ling and the Second Elder, the little fellow who was previously brimming with energy had an increasingly poor complexion as time passed.The little lightning dragon\u2019s body was simply unable to support him for too long. If he doesn\u2019t withdraw its conscious, the little lightning dragon would probably die.\u201cMother\u2026 I\u2026 I want to rest, can I?\u201d the little fellow tugged on Ye Qingtang\u2019s sleeves and looked at her, unable to bear leaving her.Ye Qingtang nodded without understanding what the little fellow really meant.The little guy rested in Ye Qingtang\u2019s arms and wriggled lingeringly with its big, bright eyes full of reluctance.\u201cMother\u2026 do you like me?\u201d Its soft and weak voice was ladened with much anxiety.Seeing as to how the little fellow was so clingy towards Ye Qingtang, Ye Ling and the Second Elder were relieved. Based on the little fellow\u2019s toughness and violence as seen just now, they would be more at ease with him by Ye Qingtang\u2019s side.Ye Qingtang did not know whether to laugh or cry. She really did not understand why that little fellow would cling on to her like this. However, she still nodded her head.\u201cYes.\u201dIn that instant, the little fellow smiled.A simple word made his heart bloom in joy with extreme satisfaction.\u201cMother, I like you the most~\u201dHe needed to become mother\u2019s real child as soon as possible!The moment the little fellow finished speaking, he turned into a ball of light, and when the light faded, the cute and sweet little fellow disappeared. What remained was a tiny dragon which was covered in blue-black scales, curled up in Ye Qingtang\u2019s arms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At first glance, it was like a little snake. However, when looked closely, one would notice a very tiny pair of dragon horns on its head.Other than the fact that it was forced to be born, a strong force still took over its body for quite a while, leaving its weak small frame almost completely drained.At that point, the little lightning dragon seemed very exhausted as it rested in Ye Qingtang\u2019s hands listlessly.Could it still transform? Looking at the tired little lightning dragon, Ye Qingtang wanted to laugh. She carefully placed it in her arms, and the little lightning dragon comfortably curled itself up further. Carrying it in her arms was almost no hassle.\u201cThen I\u2019ll find Lord Mu Su first,\u201d Ye Qingtang said.Ye Ling nodded.Ye Qingtang left instantly.Watching the back of his daughter leaving, Ye Ling could not help but let out a sigh.\u201cTang Tang has really grown up,\u201d the Second Elder said with a smile. It was all thanks to Ye Qingtang\u2019s plot that they were able to take the Great Elder down so successfully today.\u201cYes, she finally grew up.\u201d Ye Ling let out a laugh and shook his head. Without saying anything more, both of them proceeded to deal with the Great Elder\u2019s corpse.Ye Qingtang left the Ye residence and headed towards a pavilion in Lin Town according to the address given by Mu Su.Even though she was reborn, she was still aware that she could not anyhow offend a person of such identity like Mu Su. If not for the fact that she wanted to enter Xuanling Sect, she would not hang around such a mighty figure.Ye Qingtang arrived at the certain pavilion in Lin Town. It was extremely clean and classy in design.The moment Ye Qingtang reached the entrance of the pavilion, a servant guarding outside the pavilion went up to her immediately.\u201cAre you Lady Ye Qingtang?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ye Qingtang nodded.\u201cPlease wait a moment, Lady Ye. I\u2019ll go pass the message.\u201d Afterward, the servant entered the pavilion.In not a moment\u2019s time, Mu Su walked out from the pavilion, and his eyes glimmered when he saw Ye Qingtang. He went forward immediately and said, \u201cLady Ye, you\u2019re here just in time. I\u2019ve already told that person about your incident. Hurry, come in with me.\u201dYe Qingtang nodded. Although she did not really interact with Mu Su in her previous life, she knew how prestigious Mu Su was. She did not think much on her journey here, but after meeting him, she felt that Lord Mu Su was not arrogant and aloof as rumored. Rather, he was quite friendly.Mu Su brought Ye Qingtang up to the second floor and led her to stand in front of a deluxe room. He pushed open the door, and the candlelight flickered. Ye Qingtang saw a layer of curtains in the inner chamber which blocked her vision. With the candlelight, however, she faintly saw a figure sitting in the room.Although she was not able to see the person\u2019s face clearly, Ye Qingtang could still sense an invisible oppressing aura enveloping the entire room.It was definitely a powerful figure whose abilities were above Mu Su\u2019s!This made Ye Qingtang even more curious about what this person\u2019s identity was.When Mu Su led Ye Qingtang into the room, the corner of his lips froze when he saw the curtain.What\u2019s going on? He had just stepped out for a while, yet why did His Highness put up this curtain?Did they not agree on using this opportunity for him to get closer to Ye Qingtang?Why did he still put up such a thing?While many thoughts ran across his mind, Mu Su did not show them on his face.\u201cYour Highness, this is Ye Qingtang,\u201d Mu Su said while suppressing all his thoughts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In front of the Antiquity Palace, all the large, powerful sects in the world were very modest and did not dare to show the slightest disrespect.No one could shake up the position that the Antiquity Palace palace had in everyone\u2019s hearts. The strangest thing was that there was only the Palace Lord in the Antiquity Palace throughout history. Even a mighty figure like Mu Su could only pledge allegiance and could not join the Antiquity Palace.However, it was this sole Palace Lord who everyone regarded with reverence.The Palace Lord of Antiquity Palace had unfathomable skills and could be said to be the most powerful existence on earth. Furthermore, the Palace Lord rarely appeared in front of people. Even Ye Qingtang, who had lived for three hundred years in her previous life, had never seen the Antiquity Palace\u2019s Palace Lord before.But what Ye Qingtang was truly worried about was the Heart of the Demon God in her body!No one other than Ye Qingtang would be clearer about the turmoil that the Heart of the Demon God brought. Though she already grasped the technique to hide the Heart of the Demon God, if the person sitting in the room was really the Palace Lord of the Antiquity Palace, even she was unable to confirm whether the other party would discover it.If he discovered it, she would definitely die given her current abilities!At that moment, her good mood turned into deep worry. Ye Qingtang initially thought that Mu Su was going to introduce Ye Qingtang to his friend, however\u2026If she knew it was the Palace Lord of Antiquity Palace, she would have definitely not come!In the inner chamber, Han Cangming sat upright on a chair. The curtain\u2019s obstruction was not enough to block his vision. He could clearly see Ye Qingtang standing two meters away from him.Against the candlelight, the girl\u2019s alluring looks were even softer. Her bright eyes were downcast, as if they were holding back all emotions.Han Cangming\u2019s gaze swept across Ye Qingtang. His beautiful eyes appeared slightly complicated as they searched for something.In the room, Mu Su, who had just spoken, did not sense Ye Qingtang\u2019s sudden nervousness. He was initially waiting for His Highness to say something so as to take the opportunity to get closer to Ye Qingtang, but\u2026After waiting for so long, there was still no sound in the room.Mu Su was dumbfounded on the spot.What was going on?He had brought the person there already, but why was His Highness not taking any action?Open your mouth and say something!Anxiety filled Mu Su, and he wished he could dash into the room to give His Highness a reminder. However, because Ye Qingtang was present, it was inconvenient to be too obvious about it, and he could only endure the suffocating silence.He looked at Ye Qingtang and suddenly realized that Ye Qingtang wore a strange expression. Immediately, the anxiety within him deepened further.Your Highness, your silence can easily scare people to death! Can\u2019t you see that this lady\u2019s face has turned pale already!However, Mu Su was unaware that what really made Ye Qingtang nervous was not Han Cangming\u2019s silence but her fear that\u2026 the person in the inner chamber might have discovered something. That was why she still did not say anything.Mu Su was very afraid that his seemingly clever act would backfire and could only repeat what he said to Han Cangming earlier on another time, \u201cYour Highness, Lady Ye\u2019s spirit root is a little special. I really cannot understand and am also afraid to hold up her cultivation; thus, I brought her here to trouble Your Highness to take a look.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Stop cherishing your words like gold at this timing!Ye Qingtang felt even more complicated.\u201cLady Ye, how about you show your spirit root first?\u201d Mu Su tried hard to establish harmony.Knowing that there was no way she could escape at that point, Ye Qingtang could only brace herself and spread open her hands.With the movement of a faint light, the tiny spirit root was suddenly formed in Ye Qingtang\u2019s palm.\u201cYour Highness, Lady Ye\u2019s original spirit root broke, and this is the new spirit root she regrew. I wonder if there\u2019s anything wrong with this spirit root\u2026\u201d Mu Su said once again.In the inner chamber, Han Cangming frowned lightly as he looked at the spirit root in Ye Qingtang\u2019s hand.Others may not know, but no one would be clearer than him that the consciousness of the Heart of the Demon God had utilized the powers of the Heart to help Ye Qingtang grow this spirit root.Han Cangming slowly said, \u201cThis spirit root can be grown.\u201dA spirit root grown with the help of the Heart of the Demon God was utterly different from other spirit roots. The little black ball utilized the powers of the Heart and helped Ye Qingtang to grow a new spirit root. However, the little black ball did not really understand the comings of spirit roots. Hence, although a new spirit root did grow out, it was not strengthened.Despite so, this spirit root was not ordinary, and its quality could be raised through cultivation and nourishment. Although it was still a red spirit root now, with proper nourishment in the future, it could even develop to a blue spirit root and purple spirit root, much less her initial green spirit root.Ye Qingtang was shocked when she heard Han Cangming.Her spirit root could actually grow?!!Once they appeared, all spirit roots on earth were not able to grow anymore. The quality of almost everyone\u2019s spirit roots was fixed ever since they appeared, and only a few treasures that were extremely hard to find could nourish the spirit root and mature it slightly. However, no one had heard of any spirit root that could grow by itself.Ye Qingtang knew where her spirit root came from and obviously knew that it was different from ordinary spirit roots.However, she did not expect that it would be so different.\u201cIs there anything I need to pay attention to?\u201d Ye Qingtang was concerned over her spirit root and no longer as cautious.Anyway, if the person had really discovered it, she could neither defeat him nor escape.Han Cangming said, \u201cNo.\u201dMu Su was anxious to death.Ye Qingtang initiated a conversation, yet how could His Highness still be so aloof! Your Highness, please be more attentive!\u201cYour Highness, what does Lady Ye need if she wants to nurture and grow her spirit root?\u201d Mu Su was really worried.Ye Qingtang could not help but listen more attentively.\u201cJasper Ganoderma, Exquisite Emerald Jade, and Black Heaven Water,\u201d Han Cangming said with no fluctuation in his tone. Though there were a little more words, it was still very succinct\u2026Mu Su\u2019s heart was complicated. The three items that Han Cangming mentioned were extremely hard to obtain all over the world. Although their names were known, common people did not have the affinity to see any of them.Your Highness, could you say something more ordinary? I know you have a broad horizon, but how are these things obtainable by ordinary people?However, Ye Qingtang\u2019s eyes glistened. She did not know about the others, but she knew about the Black Heaven Water!When she was in Xuanling Sect in her previous life, she had seen the Black Heaven Water before!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was the exact reason behind Ye Qingtang\u2019s persistence in entering Xuanling Sect. To cultivators, the Black Heaven Water was a treasure like no other; one could completely improve their physique and change their natural endowment when they consume it even if their spirit roots could not be grown.Ye Qingtang\u2019s natural endowment was pretty good, but her spirit root broke. Even if a new one grew, her vitality took a hit, and her future cultivation would definitely be impacted. Thus, she wanted to enter Xuanling Sect so urgently to obtain the Black Heaven Water and improve her physique.Unexpectedly, this item was actually effective for improving her spirit root as well!Then, Ye Qingtang was even more resolute on entering Xuanling Sect.Ye You had already entered Yunxiao Sect. According to her memory from her past life, Ye You\u2019s abilities would improve by leaps and bounds. For Ye Qingtang to take revenge on Ye You in the future, she must first enter Xuanling Sect and obtain the Black Heaven Water to resolve the debility caused by the digging out of her spirit root.And only through that way would she be able to really get a hold on a chip to compete with Ye You.\u201cYour Highness, if there aren\u2019t these three objects\u2026\u201d Mu Su could not help but ask.\u201cSpirit energy is barely feasible,\u201d replied Han Cangming.Mu Su was about to cry.However, Ye Qingtang was in a much better mood than before. At least, she already knew which direction she needed to head towards.\u201cThank you\u2026 Your Highness, for answering my questions today.\u201d Ye Qingtang thanked him honestly.As Han Cangming, who was sitting in the inner chamber, looked at the good-spirited girl with slightly tinted cheeks, something flashed across his indifferent eyes.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank me.\u201dYe Qingtang stood up, beaming, and slowly relaxed. It could be counted as a huge gain for her since the other party seemed to not have discovered the Heart of the Demon God and even answered her queries on the spirit root as well.However\u2026Ye Qingtang did not dare to be careless as she secretly reminded herself to stay away from the Antiquity Palace in the future to prevent the presence of the Heart of the Demon God from being discovered.\u201cThank you for your help today. I will not disturb your highness from your rest anymore.\u201d Ye Qingtang respected the power of the Antiquity Palace and would obviously not dare to stay long. If the Heart of the Demon God were discovered, she would not be able to leave even if she wanted to.Mu Su had originally planned to give the two of them more time to interact with each other, yet Ye Qingtang was about to leave.

It was the exact reason behind Ye Qingtang\u2019s persistence in entering Xuanling Sect. To cultivators, the Black Heaven Water was a treasure like no other; one could completely improve their physique and change their natural endowment when they consume it even if their spirit roots could not be grown.Ye Qingtang\u2019s natural endowment was pretty good, but her spirit root broke. Even if a new one grew, her vitality took a hit, and her future cultivation would definitely be impacted. Thus, she wanted to enter Xuanling Sect so urgently to obtain the Black Heaven Water and improve her physique.Unexpectedly, this item was actually effective for improving her spirit root as well!Then, Ye Qingtang was even more resolute on entering Xuanling Sect.Ye You had already entered Yunxiao Sect. According to her memory from her past life, Ye You\u2019s abilities would improve by leaps and bounds. For Ye Qingtang to take revenge on Ye You in the future, she must first enter Xuanling Sect and obtain the Black Heaven Water to resolve the debility caused by the digging out of her spirit root.And only through that way would she be able to really get a hold on a chip to compete with Ye You.\u201cYour Highness, if there aren\u2019t these three objects\u2026\u201d Mu Su could not help but ask.\u201cSpirit energy is barely feasible,\u201d replied Han Cangming.Mu Su was about to cry.However, Ye Qingtang was in a much better mood than before. At least, she already knew which direction she needed to head towards.\u201cThank you\u2026 Your Highness, for answering my questions today.\u201d Ye Qingtang thanked him honestly.As Han Cangming, who was sitting in the inner chamber, looked at the good-spirited girl with slightly tinted cheeks, something flashed across his indifferent eyes.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank me.\u201dYe Qingtang stood up, beaming, and slowly relaxed. It could be counted as a huge gain for her since the other party seemed to not have discovered the Heart of the Demon God and even answered her queries on the spirit root as well.However\u2026Ye Qingtang did not dare to be careless as she secretly reminded herself to stay away from the Antiquity Palace in the future to prevent the presence of the Heart of the Demon God from being discovered.\u201cThank you for your help today. I will not disturb your highness from your rest anymore.\u201d Ye Qingtang respected the power of the Antiquity Palace and would obviously not dare to stay long. If the Heart of the Demon God were discovered, she would not be able to leave even if she wanted to.Mu Su had originally planned to give the two of them more time to interact with each other, yet Ye Qingtang was about to leave. Looking into the inner chamber, he saw that Han Cangming did not even have any intention to stop her from leaving!\u201cLady Ye, let me walk you out,\u201d Mu Su said with forced collectedness as he helplessly swallowed down a mouth of blood stuck in his throat.\u201cThank you.\u201dMu Su brought Ye Qingtang out of the deluxe room.

The child that I picked up halfway back is not Ye Xun, but you\u2026\u201dYe Qingtang was taken aback instantly.Ye Ling cast a bitter smile to Ye Qingtang. \u201cTang Tang, I originally wanted to tell you about this once you got married. However, after going through all this, I thought of telling you in advance.\u201d\u201cOn that day, my wife and I had just lost a child and were heartbroken. Yet, we found you. I cannot describe that feeling. Perhaps, this was a child whom God made up to us with. We brought you back to the Ye residence and took care of you like you were our biological daughter. I have never told anyone about this. The only people who know about it are you, your mother, and I.\u201dHe took out the jade pendant from the box as he spoke.\u201cThis jade pendant was found on you when we picked you up initially. Perhaps, it was left by your biological parents. I had people check the origin of this item before but couldn\u2019t get many clues. I only know that this item may be related to the royal family of the Nine Nights Dynasty. From the moment your green spirit root appeared, I thought that perhaps your biological parents\u2019 background was not simple.\u201dGreen spirit roots were very precious. For a family clan like the Ye\u2019s, how many children with green spirit roots appeared before?Nine Nights Dynasty?Ye Qingtang was stunned.The place they were in now belongs to the Formidable Heavens Dynasty. The Formidable Heavens Dynasty was made up of many countries, and the royal families of all countries were called the Formidable Heavens Royals. The Nine Nights Dynasty was a rival of the Formidable Heavens Dynasty.\u201cIn this period of time, I am very gratified by your growth. It\u2019s time I pass this to you. If you have the luck to enter Xuanling Sect in the future, you\u2019ll no longer be the same as ordinary people. If you have the chance, you can find out who your biological parents are.\u201d Ye Qingtang passed the jade pendant into Ye Qingtang\u2019s hands. He was blessed that God gave him such a daughter.Looking at the jade pendant in her hands, Ye Qingtang felt mixed emotions. Ye Ling died early in her previous life, and, thus, she did not know anything about her parentage.Yet, unexpectedly\u2026In this life, she actually found out such a secret.Ye Qingtang held onto the jade pendant tightly and looked up towards Ye Ling.\u201cFather, you\u2019ll always be my father.\u201dYe Ling smiled. With that one sentence from her, he was already extremely satisfied.\u201cIt\u2019s not early. Go get some rest first. It\u2019s time you prepare for your admission to Xuanling Sect.\u201d\u201cNoted.\u201d Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and stood up to leave.\u201cThere is one more thing,\u201d Ye Ling said suddenly.Ye Qingtang stopped in her tracks.\u201cAfter getting rid of the Great Elder, your second uncle and I removed a group of disloyal people from the residence. We wanted to get rid of Ye Xun as well initially but could not find her on the residence. I\u2019ve found that the Great Elder secretly sent Ye Xun out halfway during the celebration, but I don\u2019t know where she went,\u201d Ye Ling said with a frown.He adopted two daughters and raised them up with similar attentiveness. The only difference was that many people in the city saw him picking Ye Xun up, so he could not raise her with the name of his biological daughter. However, honestly speaking, Ye Ling had always treated the both of them fairly; Whatever Ye Qingtang had, Ye Xun would also have a share of it.Yet, these two daughters\u2019 characters were such polar opposites.He personally raised Ye Xun, a heartless and ungrateful person.\u201cI know now. I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d Ye Qingtang nodded. The Great Elder was already dead, so they could not ask him where exactly was Ye Xun sent to. Nonetheless, she would be more careful in the future.\u201cThat\u2019s good. Go get some rest.\u201d Ye Ling nodded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That Great Elder got what he deserved,\u201d Master Si said as he sat on a chair.Ye Qingtang smiled.\u201cI heard you persuaded Lord Mu Su to recommend you to participate in Xuanling Sect\u2019s entrance assessment yesterday?\u201d asked Master Si as he harked back to the subject.\u201cYes,\u201d Ye Qingtang answered with no intention to hide anything.A worried expression appeared on Master Si\u2019s face.\u201cIt is good that you\u2019ve set your mind to enter a sect. I know that you\u2019ve suffered all sorts of humiliation in the Ye family, but it is difficult to enter a sect. If you cannot pass the assessment, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll lose your only chance. You\u2019ve just started out, so jumping straight into participating in the assessment will rather be a strain.\u201d Master Si paused for a moment and continued sincerely. \u201cSi Ye and Si Qiong are cultivating outside with their masters and will only participate in the sect assessment a few years later. Si Bai\u2019s spirit root is the best, and I originally wanted him to enter a sect, but his body is weak. Now that he can be properly nursed back to health, I can also be at ease.\u201d\u201cNow that the Great Elder has lost his authority and both your father and the Second Elder are back in power, why don\u2019t you wait another year? In this year, you can train together with my third grandson. I will discuss with your father and invite a famous master to teach the two of you in the Si residence. When heading for a sect in the next year, you will also be more confident,\u201d said Master Si.Every word that Master Si said was in consideration for Ye Qingtang and was said painstakingly.Ye Qingtang\u2019s nose turned sour as she listened, but ultimately, she still shook her head coolly at Master Si.\u201cGrandfather Si, I cannot wait so long. Rest assured, I\u2019ll not do anything that I have no confidence in.\u201d\u201cThis child just doesn\u2019t listen to persuasions.\u201d Master Si was really worried for Ye Qingtang.\u201cI know that Ye You has already entered Yunxiao Sect and is a direct disciple of the sect master. With your spirit root, her might will be redoubled. I understand your heart to seek revenge, but if you\u2019re too hasty, it won\u2019t work out. Where there is life, there is hope. You must understand this.\u201d\u201cI know grandfather Si\u2019s good intentions. Just trust me this once, grandfather Si.\u201d Ye Qingtang looked up at Master Si.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Master Si wanted to persuade her again.However, Si Bai, who was sitting at the side, suddenly said something.\u201cGrandfather, don\u2019t worry already. When has Tang Tang disappointed you? Since she wants to head to Xuanling Sect, she must have something in hand.\u201dMaster Si glared at his grandson.Si Bai was at a loss whether to cry or laugh as he touched the tip of his nose. He kept feeling that ever since his grandfather accepted Ye Qingtang, his position in his grandfather\u2019s heart kept falling.\u201cYou only know to follow what she says. You\u2019re still young, what do you know?\u201d Master Si said grumpily and then looked at Ye Qingtang. \u201cIf you\u2019re bent on going, I will not stop you. At most, I\u2019ll talk to Lord Mu Su again in the next year. However, you must remember one thing.\u201d\u201cPlease say, grandfather Si.\u201d\u201cBefore you compete with Ye You, you must not let others know that she stole your spirit root,\u201d Master Si said sternly.Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback but replied immediately, \u201cQingtang understands.\u201dUp until then, she still had not told her father and second uncle that her spirit root was stolen because she was afraid that they would be overly worried for her.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you understand. Ye You is now a disciple of Yunxiao Sect Sec Master. Even if you revealed her scheme to others, Yunxiao Sect\u2019s Sect Master will suppress this matter to save face. Furthermore, once this enters their ears, Yunxiao Sect will definitely get rid of you to avoid trouble later on in protection of their reputation,\u201d Master Si said concernedly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Other than her father and second uncle, no one else would think for her so thoroughly like this.\u201cLuckily, you also have a new spirit root now. I won\u2019t ask how this spirit root of yours came about, but you must treasure it. This is a chance given to you by God. The sect assessment is as difficult as climbing up to the sky. Fortunately, there\u2019s still some time, and you must make full use of this time to finish preparations. It\u2019s good that your father is in control of the Ye family now, and you\u2019ll not be short of anything,\u201d Master Si said.Ye Qingtang nodded silently. No words could fully express her feelings.Master Si only let go of the matter after talking to Ye Qingtang for a while more. Before Ye Qingtang left, he still specially had Si Ye to prepare many tonics for Ye Qingtang to bring back, although he knew that Ye Ling would not treat his daughter shabbily. He said it was to nourish her body after the debility from having her spirit root dug out.Ye Qingtang could only accept it and store the Si family\u2019s kindness in her heart.After leaving the Si residence, Ye Qingtang headed to the Pavilion of Treasures to meet its manager.After knowing that her spirit root can be grown, she had an even more urgent need for the Floating Pagoda.Before she entered Xuanling Sect and obtained the Black Heaven Water, the Floating Pagoda was the best choice for her to nourish her spirit root.\u201cLady Ye,\u201d the Pavilion of Treasures\u2019 manager greeted with a grin once he saw Ye Qingtang.\u201cIs there any update on the Floating Pagoda that I told you about the other time?\u201d Ye Qingtang asked with a smileThe manager looked at Ye Qingtang with complicated eyes. Previously, Ye Qingtang had a huge appetite and wanted to monopolize all the Floating Pagodas in the Pavilion of Treasures under her. This act caught the manager\u2019s attention: if there were no special effects, would Ye Qingtang be crazy to want so many Floating Pagodas?He specially ordered people to repeatedly investigate any potential uses of the Floating Pagoda and had not agreed to Ye Qingtang\u2019s suggestion for fear that he would accidentally sell off something precious.But many days passed, and despite flipping through a room of books and asking other managers from the Pavilion of Treasures, he still could not find out what the Floating Pagoda could be used for. It was still of little value.\u201cLady Ye, regarding the matter that you suggested previously, I have already notified the managers of the other branches, and they agreed to supply you with the Floating Pagodas.\u201d The manager could only agree since he could not find out any uses of the Floating Pagoda and that Ye Qingtang seemed to have relations with his pavilion master.Anyway, the Floating Pagodas had been piling up in the Pavilion of Treasures, and no one asked anything about it. With Ye Qingtang helping to sweep them off the shelves, it was also a great help to them.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Ye Qingtang smiled satisfyingly. She knew that the manager definitely investigated the uses of the Floating Pagoda, but no matter how he checked, there was no one who would find out the real use of the Floating Pagoda within these few years.Ye Qingtang directly took out twenty thousand gold from her space ring and handed it to the manager, telling him to deduct all future payments for the Floating Pagoda from there and that she will pay the rest if it was used up. Ever since the Great Elder was fired, the authority over the Ye family returned back to Ye Ling once again, and Ye Qingtang had much easier access to the funds.The manager naturally accepted it grinningly.After confirming her supply of Floating Pagodas, Ye Qingtang picked quite a few low-grade spirit stones from the Pavilion of Treasures and fed them to the little lightning dragon when she returned to the Ye residence.The little lightning dragon barely came to after sleeping for an entire day and night. The dragon species were precious. While it would be extremely effective if normal spirit animals were fed with spirit stones, these spirit stones were merely snacks for the little lightning dragon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just the \u201cappetite\u201d of the little lightning dragon was enough for it to eat until one ended up bankrupt.This was still a cub that just came out of its shell. If it were a little bigger\u2026 the entire Ye family\u2019s reserves would not be enough to feed it, much less Ye Qingtang.Ye Qingtang suddenly felt that she might need to find a method to make money in the future; otherwise, she might be the first person in history to be starved to death by a dragon.Days passed. Ye Qingtang received Mu Su\u2019s letter of recommendation, and she could head to Xuanling Sect to participate in the entrance assessment just with this letter.Xuanling Sect was quite far from Lin Town. Ye Qingtang had been readily prepared early to set out on the journey in advance.On the day when Ye Qingtang hit the road, the Second Elder and Ye Ling had done many preparations for Ye Qingtang from early on and sent her off.Even the Si family sent both Si Ye and Si Bai to show up.\u201cUncle Ye,\u201d Si Ye and Si Bai greeted.Ye Qingtang nodded with a smile. Ever since Ye Qingtang became friendly with the Si family, the relationship between the Ye and Si improved increasingly as well, and they interacted much more on usual days.Immediately, both of them walked towards Ye Qingtang.\u201cGrandfather told me to hand these things to you. He said that you\u2019re too stubborn and was unwilling to send you off because he\u2019s angry,\u201d Si Bai said laughingly as the servants beside him subsequently placed the items that Master Si prepared on the carriage.\u201cPlease apologize to grandfather Si on my behalf. I know he had my best interests at heart.\u201d Ye Qingtang laughed.Si Bai chuckled and said quietly, \u201cGrandfather may have said that, but actually, he didn\u2019t come personally as he was afraid of the sadness of separation.\u201d As he spoke, he even winked at Ye Qingtang as a hint.Ye Qingtang could not help but let out a laugh.\u201cWhen I return, I\u2019ll thank grandfather Si personally.\u201d\u201cThe journey to Xuanling Sect is far. Grandfather is afraid that the journey isn\u2019t safe, so\u2026\u201d Si Bai pushed Si Ye, who was beside him, forward to stand in front of Ye Qingtang.Si Ye looked at Ye Qingtang a little awkwardly.Similarly, Ye Qingtang had a face of confusion.\u201cMy eldest brother is pretty skilled, and grandfather made him to be your coachman.\u201d Si Bai laughed.\u201c\u2026\u201d At this point, Ye Qingtang really did not know whether to laugh or cry.The dignified Young Master Si was actually acting as a coachman for her?How high was her status?!Even Ye Ling and the Second Elder were surprised by Master Si\u2019s action.It can\u2019t be that the he took a fancy on Tang Tang and was ready to sweet-talk Tang Tang into becoming her granddaughter-in-law, can it?\u201cThere\u2019s no need for this, I think? Big brother Si may have things to tend to as well. I can manage on my own,\u201d Ye Qingtang declined politely. She knew that Master Si specially made this arrangement as he was unaware that the Great Elder had died and was probably afraid that the Great Elder arranged for someone to sneak an attack on her on the journey there.\u201cDon\u2019t stand on ceremony anymore. Grandfather said that if eldest brother does not safely send you to Xuanling Sect, he can dream of returning to the Si residence,\u201d Si Bai gloated happily. His body was weak and would be unable to withstand the bumpy journey. Thus, an assignment like fetching people would naturally fall on Si Ye.Ye Qingtang looked helplessly at Si Ye, who had a weird expression.\u201cI am unrelated. Since it is grandfather\u2019s orders, just agree and put his mind at ease.\u201dYe Qingtang declined grandfather Si\u2019s protection quite a number of times and should she reject it again this time\u2026 Si Ye felt that his grandfather might just explode.Seeing so, there was no way Ye Qingtang could reject, and she could only reply, \u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble big brother Si then.\u201dSi Ye nodded slightly.Ye Ling originally arranged for his henchman to send Ye Qingtang to Xuanling Sect but could only trouble Si Ye to make the trip instead due to Master Si\u2019s stubbornness.Ye Ling and Ye Qingtang said their goodbyes for a while, and when he saw that it was time, he let Ye Qingtang set out on the journey without saying much.Ye Qingtang got onto the carriage, and Si Ye really sat on the position for the coachman, escorting Ye Qingtang out of town from outside the carriage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In case any unexpected things happen, please do make more preparations still.\u201dYe You laughed without emotion. \u201cThere is someone I know in Xuanling Sect, and I\u2019ll notify him. If Ye Qingtang does not have the fate to enter Xuanling Sect, just let it be. But if she enters\u2026 she\u2019ll also not be able to leave.\u201d When she finished her sentence, a murderous look suddenly flashed across her gentle-looking eyes.Ye Xun was extremely cautious, and she remained silent at a side.Ye You was born with an extremely beautiful face, and she had an elegant disposition. However, no one could see that under that beautiful skin laid a heart as vicious as the Great Elder\u2019s.Ye You took a look at Ye Xun and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to return to the Ye family for now. Just serve me by my side.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Ye Xun agreed obediently. She knew that due to the fact that Ye Qingtang obtained the qualification to participate in a sect\u2019s entrance assessment, Duan Tianrao would already be dissatisfied with her. If she returned now, Duan Tianrao may just cancel the engagement because of this. Hence, she decided to avoid meeting him for now.\u201cSo you\u2019re not planning to go back personally, sister You?\u201dYe You raised her eyelids slightly, and a lofty smile emerged on her beautiful face. \u201cA few days later, Master will teach me Yunxiao Sect\u2019s mystic technique. Once the training for it starts, I\u2019ll need to go on for a couple of months without stopping. Furthermore\u2026\u201dYe You narrowed her eyes as a cold smile hung on the corner of her lips.\u201cIs the current Ye Qingtang even qualified?\u201d\u201cSister You is indeed right. So what if Ye Qingtang really enters Xuanling Sect? How could she compete with you?\u201d Ye Xun echoed gently.Ye You smiled detachedly.Ye Xun said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to trouble that old friend of yours to properly \u2018take care\u2019 of Ye Xun at that time then.\u201dYe You laughed lightly. \u201cOf course.

Within the carriage, Ye Qingtang saw an increasingly familiar surrounding before her, and a strange feeling arose within her. She lifted her eyes slightly and looked at the tall mountain not far away. That mountain was steep, and its summit was covered in cloud mist. However, Ye Qingtang was very clear that there\u2026 was the location of Xuanling Sect.Above the vague mist, Xuanling Sect stood against the clouds in the sky.\u201cXuanling Sect\u2026\u201d As Ye Qingtang looked at the cloud mist at the mountain\u2019s summit, scenes from her previous life flooded her mind.[Ye Qingtang, you have the Heart of the Demon God in your body. Xuanling Sect cannot keep you anymore.]In her previous life, Ye Qingtang did not have a spirit root and only found a way to model a fake spirit root after searching for a long time. She used that method and finally entered Xuanling Sect. However\u2026 the her then would never have dreamt that the very entrance became a turning point in her life.Not a good turn, but an abyssal drop.Her Heart of the Demon God was exposed in a mission, and she was forced out of the sect. Moreover, a Sect Elder with evil intentions, along with other disciples in the sect, told the entire world that she possessed the Heart of the Demon God.Since then, she turned from avoiding Ye You to becoming everyone\u2019s target of murder.And from the moment she left Xuanling Sect, Ye Qingtang was like a person hated by everyone, and she got shouted at and beaten up by many. The news of the Heart of the Demon God could no longer be hidden.After innumerable twists and turns, Ye Qingtang chose Xuanling Sect once again in this life.This time, it was not only to obtain the Black Heaven Water but more to\u2026 seek revenge\u2026In this life, she would not let anyone who harmed her in her previous life off.\u201cWe\u2019re reaching Xuanling Sect very soon. Qingtang, are you ready to participate in the sect assessment?\u201d Si Ye\u2019s voice rang from outside the carriage.Ye Qingtang chuckled with bright eyes, \u201cI\u2019ve been preparing for this moment for too long.\u201d\u2026Below Xuanling Sect and above the clouds was obviously a place with little trace of civilization, yet today, this place was exceptionally \u201cbustling\u201d.It was difficult for a carriage to ascend the mountain; thus, Si Ye and Ye Qingtang got off the carriage at the foot of the mountain and walked up to the summit.There were already many people at the summit. In the large groups of people, everyone was donned in luxurious attires and possessed a dignified bearing. Rather, it was Ye Qingtang and Si Ye, who were both relatively young, who dressed casually and in the least numbers. Yet, everyone noticed them once they reached the summit.\u201cThese are all people participating in Xuanling Sect\u2019s entrance assessment?\u201d Si Ye asked Ye Qingtang as they stood aside. He unconsciously looked at the others. Amongst the crowd, it was not difficult to tell that the ones who were really there to participate in the assessment were the young talents while most of the rest were there to send them off.Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.\u201cI didn\u2019t think that there would actually be so many people.\u201d Ye Qintang estimated that there were at least more than a hundred people who were there to participate in Xuanling Sect\u2019s entrance assessment.\u201cIt is unknown how many can remain,\u201d Ye Qingtang said coolly.Every year, all sects would welcome a large batch of people who wished to enter the sect. However, amongst these hundreds of people, it was already rare for one-tenth of them to enter the sect.Unless one possessed a rare supreme-grade spirit root like Ye You did, to obtain the opportunity to enter a sect, one was required to first have a high enough natural endowment and second, a recommendation by a mighty figure. Moreover, these two conditions were merely qualifications for them to participate in a sect\u2019s entrance assessment.No one knew whether one could enter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Family clans like the Si and Ye family seemed especially tiny before ones like Liu Yun\u2019s.Ye Qingtang followed Si Ye\u2019s gaze, and as expected, she saw a group of finely-dressed people with elegant demeanors.Leading the group of people was a tall middle-aged man with an extraordinary bearing, and he was quietly talking to a young man. When Ye Qingtang\u2019s gaze fell on the male who listened with lowered eyes, something shone in her eyes uncontrollably.[ Qingtang! Quickly leave! ]On a stormy night, that handsome youth stood in front of her with his flesh and blood, bearing a fatal blow.\u201cSenior Brother Yun\u2026\u201d Ye Qingtang mumbled softly as she looked at the side profile of the youth.\u201cQingtang, do you know the people from the Liu Yun family clan?\u201d Si Ye seemed to have sensed Ye Qingtang\u2019s abnormal behavior and could not help but ask.Ye Qingtang returned to her senses and shook her head immediately.It was she who owed him.In her previous life when Ye Qingtang entered the Xuanling Sect, she experienced difficulty in learning anything due to the absence of spirit root and was, thus, ridiculed by some senior and junior brothers. More than that, she was bullied for not having a family clan background. The only person in Xuanling Sect who treated her well was Senior Brother Yun, Yun Shu.But ultimately\u2026Yun Shu died for her, but she did not even have the ability to seek revenge for him.The only warmth in her previous life was slashed away hard on that stormy night.Si Ye did not think much into it and was slightly shocked as he looked at the crowd.He had always known that it was hard to enter a Sect but never expected that despite so, there were even the Formidable Heavens Royals here apart from the Liu Yun family clan. Every candidate participating in the entrance assessment had extraordinary backgrounds such that any random person picked out would have a glorious background.And only people with such a social status would attract a mighty figure to recommend them.\u201cBig brother Si, there\u2019s still a while more until the assessment. You don\u2019t need to accompany me. Do head back first,\u201d Ye Qingtang said with a smile.Si Ye originally wanted to stay and accompany Ye Qingtang, but on second thought, if Ye Qingtang failed, she may be embarrassed to face him. Thus, he gave a few orders and descended the mountain without saying anything more, deciding to wait a while more in the carriage at the bottom of the mountain.Once Si Ye left, Ye Qingtang stood at the summit alone. Her small frame and outstanding appearance attracted much attention.However, the reactions she got were less of shock and more of mockery.\u201cWho is that girl? She can\u2019t be here to participate in the sect assessment also?\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it. All the candidates for the sect assessment today were escorted by many people from their family and had the company of a powerful person who recommended them. Just now, I saw that there was only one young man beside that girl, and he had left. It doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re here for the assessment.\u201d\u201cPerhaps, she\u2019s here to see the world. After all, this Path to Heaven cannot be traversed by normal people.\u201dThe people who came today had extremely high expectations and could see that Ye Qingtang\u2019s lone self was a misfit in this bustling and flourishing age.Ye Qingtang was not at all bothered by those discussions and stood there calmly as she eyed the cloudy horizon.In the previous life, she waited for the Path to Heaven\u2014the path leading to the sect\u2014to open by herself just like this.Ridicule and coldness\u2014she had long suffered them in her previous life. How would it still bother her in this life?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Beside him were a few servants waiting upon him carefully.The person who spoke was Lu Xiuwen, the fifth prince of one of the countries in the Formidable Heavens Dynasty.The Formidable Heavens Royals were in control of the current dynasty and held a superior position. The Formidable Heavens Dynasty built by them was a magnificent dynasty formed by many countries and commanded by the emperor of the Formidable Heavens Royals. The royal families of each country were all from the Formidable Heavens Royals, and Lu Xiuwen was a prince from one of the many countries in the Formidable Heavens Dynasty. He had a rather high ability and a proud character.Lu Xiuwen was someone more than \u201cfamiliar\u201d to Ye Qingtang.In her previous life when Ye Qingtang entered the sect, she did not have a spirit root, and her cultivation was slow. Then, Lu Xiuwen was rather popular amongst the disciples. Ye Qingtang suffered quite a lot of bullying from him and was even made to do things that only a handyman would do. Furthermore, he did not allow her to focus on cultivation like other normal disciples.However, Ye Qingtang was not too bothered by all of that.What really made Ye Qingtang remember Lu Xiuwen was his betrayal.At that time, Ye Qingtang and Lu Xiuwen were out together to deal with matters but were attacked by a high-level spirit animal on the journey. They were unable to defeat it, and when they almost lost their lives, it was the Heart of the Demon God in Ye Qingtang that unleashed its powers, ultimately saving Lu Xiuwen and the other disciples.Yet, it was that time when Ye Qingtang\u2019s Heart of the Demon God was completely exposed.Lu Xiuwen did not take into consideration that she saved his life and simply spread the news all over the world. Not only was Ye Qingtang forced out of Xuanling Sect, but her secret regarding the Heart of the Demon God could no longer be hidden, resulting in the tragedy of being wanted for her life by everyone.\u201cIt\u2019s not up to you to say who can enter and who cannot,\u201d Ye Qingtang scoffed coldly as she looked straight at Lu Xiuwen\u2019s rather good-looking face.Lu Xiuwen frowned slightly. As a prince, there were rarely people who would rebut him like this. His face sunk immediately, and he swept a gaze at Ye Qingtang, revealing a look of belittlement when he saw that Ye Qingtang was alone.\u201cA sect is prestigious. Many people want to climb up to it, but they should still have some self-awareness.\u201dNo company by family clan nor send-off from a powerful person. Such an abject person could also come to participate in a sect assessment?The servants beside Lu Xiuwen obviously echoed Lu Xiuwen and went along with his words continuously.\u201cFifth prince, you have a noble identity. Why fight with people like this? Just let those overconfident people be. Then, she\u2019ll know that not just anyone can enter a sect.\u201dYe Qingtang raised her brows, and her smile deepened as she looked at the lackeys beside Lu Xiuwen.\u201cNoble identity? Everyone is equal before the sect. Even if you\u2019re related to the royal family, don\u2019t you still have to wait for the assessment like ordinary people?\u201dLu Xiuwen\u2019s slightly better expression suddenly turned ugly again because of Ye Qingtang\u2019s words.Ye Qingtang did not say anything wrong. Even if he was a noble prince, he still had to participate in the assessment like everyone else, and whether he was able to enter was dependent on his level of talent.The compliments from the servants earlier on now made Lu Xiuwen a little shameful.The argument between Ye Qingtang and Lu Xiuwen attracted much attention.Everyone looked over one after another only to be surprised at their realization: that young girl who was by herself actually got into a conflict with the fifth prince of the Formidable Heavens Royals.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When Yun Shu looked at the calm and breathtaking girl standing alone in front of Lu Xiuwen and his people, curiosity filled his eyes.\u201cThat lady is young and impetuous. She may be on the losing end,\u201d sighed someone from the Liu Yun family clan upon witnessing the sight.\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Yun Shu.\u201cIt is still unknown who will be able to enter the sect amongst all the people here today. It is still alright if that young girl enters, as the Formidable Heavens Royals will not dare to do anything to sect disciples. However, if she doesn\u2019t pass the assessment and isn\u2019t from a renowned family clan, how will she be able to fight the royal family?\u201d The person continued. \u201cThe Formidable Heavens Royals are not magnanimous people. What that fifth prince, Lu Xiuwen, said just now was merely to scare others since he has a powerful identity.\u201dThe people from Liu Yun family clan disliked the royal family\u2019s arrogance.Yun Shu frowned slightly.On the other side, Lu Xiuwen\u2019s face darkened, and a cold sneer formed on his lips as he eyed Ye Qingtang.\u201cHow do I address you?\u201dWith that said, every onlooker knew that Lu Xiuwen was going to record Ye Qingtang\u2019s name down.Ye Qingtang took a look at Lu Xiuwen unhurriedly and said, \u201cLin Town, Ye Qingtang.\u201dWithout any hesitation, Ye Qingtang directly reported her name and place of origin.Lu Xiuwen scoffed, \u201cYe Qingtang, is it? I\u2019ll remember it.\u201dYe Qingtang laughed. \u201cYou better remember it clearly.\u201dShe would let this name become Lu Xiuwen\u2019s nightmare ultimately.Lu Xiuwen narrowed his eyes slightly. \u201cYou better pray that you can pass this assessment, otherwise\u2026\u201d Lu Xiuwen did not finish his sentence, but everyone knew what was it going to be.Quite a number of people secretly sighed for Ye Qingtang. The sect assessment was not easy, and innumerable people were rejected by sects every year.Now that Lu Xiuwen had asked Ye Qingtang for her name, he would probably not let her off easily in the future.Taking another look at Ye Qingtang, Lu Xiuwen turned around and led his group of lackeys away without forgetting to tell someone beside him, \u201cTell royal brother to investigate this Ye Qingtang.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYe Qingtang is still too young.\u201d After looking on the scene, people from the Liu Yun family clan even more so felt that Ye Qingtang should not have revealed her identity.However, Yun Shu laughed. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because she is confident that she\u2019ll pass the assessment?\u201d\u201cIs a sect assessment that easy though? There\u2019s no certainty to pass even if it\u2019s you, much less that girl.\u201dYun Shu laughed without saying anything more, though he paid slight attention to Qingtang instinctively.Time passed with every minute and second. At the summit, a bright light from within the cloud layers suddenly shone down. The gold light gathered to form an imaginary path which connected the summit to the clouds.\u201cThe Path to Heaven!\u201dEveryone seemed to stop breathing the moment they saw the gold light.To enter the sect, they needed to step on the Path to Heaven!Almost at the same time, all the highly-skilled candidates fixed their eyes on the light before them in silent concentration.\u201cGo ahead.\u201d The Liu Yun family clan people patted Yun Shu\u2019s shoulders.Giving a nod, Yun Shu immediately headed towards the Path to Heaven.The candidates standing at the summit went forward as well. What laid before their eyes was merely a holy beam of light and not a single step. Everyone was confused how exactly to stably walk on the legendary Path to Heaven.Walk on the Path to Heaven and enter a sect\u2014this was a sentence everyone knew. However, with the Path to Heaven right before their eyes, little did they know what to do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If one could not even walk on the path stably, it would not be possible for them to enter a sect.It was the simplest step, but also the beginning of a sect assessment.No one dared to go forward, as they were deeply afraid that they would miss such a rare chance due to a small mistake.However\u2026Where could they step on in this beam of light?Everyone did not dare to step forward and instead fell into a dead silence at that moment.However\u2026A thin figure stepped out from the silent crowd and walked to under the holy light.Ye Qingtang stood at the starting point of the Path to Heaven with an unusually calm heart as she looked at the light that connected to the skyline.Xuanling Sect, she was back again.In the next instant, Ye Qingtang raised her feet gently with a calm expression. When her toes stepped into the light, a gold halo formed into a golden lotus under her feet, supporting the feet when it landed.\u201cA lotus with every step?!\u201d Shock filled everyone\u2019s eyes as they looked at the translucent golden lotus, that was about the size of a palm, under Ye Qingtang\u2019s feet.However, Ye Qingtang did not pay attention to those people and only quietly walked up the Path to Heaven that she could not be more familiar with.Everyone was taken aback on the side as they looked at Ye Qingtang walk into the holy light as if she was walking on flat ground. Wherever she raised her leg, a lotus flower would bloom. The lotuses, which were higher level by level, were like steps laid out one by one, appearing when Ye Qingtang\u2019s foot was going to land and disappearing without a trace when she stepped off.Looking from afar, it was as if Ye Qingtang was floating in midair as she stepped on the golden lotuses with holy light showering on her.Such a miraculous scene stunned many candidates, and even those who accompanied the candidates there with no good impressions of Ye Qingtang were surprised by Ye Qingtang\u2019s collectedness.She was so calm and collected as though she was walking this path for the umpteenth time.In the blink of an eye, Ye Qingtang was already ten meters away from the ground. Everyone returned to their senses from the surprise and immediately got moving.Those who were previously afraid to step forward rushed up instantly, imitated Ye Qingtang, and walked up in the holy light.When the first lotus formed under their feet, many hearts fluttered, and they instinctively raised another leg to continue walking up.However\u2026Thump!The person who was the most anxious stepped on air as the lotus under his feet disappeared, falling right on the floor.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d A look of confusion was seen on the person who fell. He clearly saw the lotus forming under his feet. Why, then, was did it disappear when he stepped down?All the subsequent people who went forward could not proceed a step further and fell down after at most two or three steps. They did not manage to walk up the Path to Heaven and fell to become a muddy mess instead. Everyone felt gloomy instantly.Why could Ye Qingtang walk up the Path to Heaven so easily, but they\u2019re so battered up?Yun Shu did not rush to go forward. Only after observing for a moment, he took a few deep breaths, calmed his heart, and stepped onto the Path to Heaven.A lotus bloomed under his foot. Although it was slightly unstable, it became stable very quickly. Yun Shu finally became the second person who walked up the Path to Heaven, though his speed was much slower than Ye Qingtang\u2019s. Every step he took was with extreme caution.Lu Xiuwen\u2019s face turned ugly. He tried to step on the Path to Heaven earlier on and almost fell as well. Dissatisfaction flashed in his eyes as he saw that Ye Qingtang had already walked into the cloud mist.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A heart like still water?Lu Xiuwen took another look at the Path to Heaven and stepped on it after making slight adjustments.This time, he put down all the restlessness in his heart, and the lotus under his feet never disappeared.With a calm mind, Lu Xiuwen immediately chased up.While Ye Qingtang\u2019s speed was faster than everyone else, she still heard the conversation between Lu Xiuwen and Yun Shu previously. She paused for a while and looked at Lu Xiuwen, who was already walking up the Path to Heaven under Yun Shu\u2019s directions, and a faint smile played on her lips.Senior Brother Yun was still so kind-hearted as in her previous life.The Path to Heaven was the first segment of the sect assessment, and only people with a heart as calm as still water would be able to have a lotus with every step and step on the clouds. Any distracted person would definitely fall. Moreover, the Path to Heaven was extremely long, and one would still fall if they were slightly doubtful halfway through.In the previous years, many fell from a great height and died while walking on the Path to Heaven.Ye Qingtang knew that with Yun Shu\u2019s character, he would definitely be able to guess the secret behind the path. Rather, it was Lu Xiuwen who got a bargain; she did not mind to let Lu Xiuwen fall a few more times.After stopping for a while, Ye Qingtang continued heading forward.With Yun Shu\u2019s directions, many started to adjust their mentality, and the people on the Path to Heaven increased gradually. Nonetheless, there were also overly-anxious people who could not step on it no matter how.This was an assessment.Filter good-for-nothings away and only those who remained had the qualifications to proceed.Even if you came from a prestigious family, it was merely a fleeting cloud before sects.Candidates were already on the Path to Heaven, and most of the people who accompanied the candidates were aware that those who could not step on the path were either too weak in the mind or trying to fake their way through.The Path to Heaven was only opened for qualified candidates. Every candidate would have on them an item such as a letter or accessory from the powerful person who recommended them. Those items were stained with the powerful person\u2019s aura, and only with the presence of the aura would one be qualified to step on the Path to Heaven.Otherwise, no matter how badly they fell, they would still not be able to enter.\u201cI made a misjudgment,\u201d someone from the Liu Yun family clan muttered suddenly while looking at the increasing number of people on the Path to Heaven.\u201cI didn\u2019t think that Ye Qingtang would capable enough to become the first person walking up the Path to Heaven. Yun Shu even benefited from her.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of the Ye family clan from Lin Town. If her spirit root is alright, perhaps, she will be able to become something,\u201d said a sharp-eyed person as he saw Ye Qingtang\u2019s specialness.The Path to Heaven was way too easy for her, and this was unexpected for others.One had to be careful with every step they took on the Path to Heaven. The higher they walked up, the calmer their emotions should be. Being more than a hundred meters away from the ground, one would definitely die if they fell.Everyone was on alert, and many were already soaked in sweat before they even got far.Only Ye Qingtang was walking leisurely as though she was singing and dancing merrily. From time to time, she looked at the birds that were flying past nearby her. Her cheerful and contented posture earned the exasperation of the candidates behind as they gritted their teeth.Who knew where that little girl was from to walk up the Path to Heaven so leisurely as though she was strolling in her own courtyard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A magnificent palace stood on the clouds. It had open pavilions and terraces and was shaded by surrounding trees. Facing against the sun, it was as though the holy light was shining from behind the sect.If one did not witness it personally, they would be unable to imagine that the sect was actually positioned on top of the cloud layers.No wonder ordinary people never knew where the sects were at.One could know how scary the powerful people within the sect were to be able to build a sect on the clouds and bear thousands of disciples in it.At the end of the Path to Heaven was Xuanling Sect\u2019s main entrance where its gates, that were several meters high, were carved with huge dragons. Outside the gate, a middle-aged man in a light-blue long gown stood in front of the door with a few Xuanling Sect disciple behind him.Ye Qingtang finished ascending the Path to Heaven and stepped on the clouds which seemed soft but were in fact extremely steady.The middle-aged man looked up and took a look at Ye Qingtang\u2019s face as surprise filled him.The Path to Heaven was difficult to walk on, especially for people who stepped on it for the first time. There was nothing below their feet, and looking around, one would see that they were several hundred meters high in the sky. Just the scenery was enough to send those with an immature mind into a flurry. However, he observed from outside the sect door just now that this young girl was in the lead. Her steps were steady, and she had a casual demeanor. There was neither a trace of fluster nor nervousness.Just this first impression satisfied the middle-aged man.The disciple behind him walked forward, and before saying anything, Ye Qingtang consciously handed Mu Su\u2019s letter over.The middle-aged man took another look at Ye Qingtang and gave her a slight nod after receiving the letter, signaling for Ye Qingtang to stand aside.Ye Qingtang was fast. A large group of people behind were still struggling in difficulty. A long time later, Yun Shu was the second person who finally reached the end. While he had a calm and steady nature, he still walked this path very cautiously without daring to increase his speed.Along with Yun Shu\u2019s arrival, Lu Xiuwen and other candidates ascended the Path to Heaven successively.While more than a hundred of candidates came, Ye Qingtang estimated that only about a hundred people managed to ascend the Path to Heaven.There were at least dozens of people filtered out by the Path to Heaven.These dozens of people no longer had the chance to enter a sect. After looking at the color of the sky, the middle-aged man standing outside the sect gate waved his hand gently, and the holy light sprinkled on the clouds vanished instantly. Subsequently, the Path to Heaven which led the way to the sect disappeared without a trace.The struggling people who were still halfway through were sent back to the ground by golden lotuses. Cries, screams, and begging filled the air immediately.The path to the sect was now an extravagant wish.Ye Qingtang did not have much reaction to it, as she had seen such scenes too many times.\u201cMany thanks.\u201dA voice rang beside Ye Qingtang suddenly. She looked over in confusion only to see Yun Shu, whose cheeks were slightly dotted with sweat, standing beside her since god knows when.\u201cWhy are you thanking me?\u201d Ye Qingtang raised her brows as she looked at her old friend from her previous life.Yun Shu chuckled, \u201cIf Miss Ye didn\u2019t take the first step just now, I would not have been able to understand the secret behind the Path to Heaven.\u201d Moreover, Yun Shu purposely fixed his eyes on Ye Qingtang along the way in order to keep his mind at peace. Without looking at the scenery below his feet, his heart was naturally calmer.For the people behind, it was indeed easier if someone took the lead. However, no one had ever said anything about it before the assessment. After all, they were all rivals on the land of the sect.Ye Qingtang looked at Yun Shu with a seeming smile. When will this Senior Brother Yun finally be able to get rid of his habit of being a mighty nice person?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was the reason why he took care of Ye Qingtang in her previous life even though she had almost no endowment.Ye Qingtang could not help but laugh when she thought about her previous life. However, when she remembered Yun Shu\u2019s destiny in her previous life, her eyes suddenly appeared to be fierce.Senior Brother Yun saved her once in the previous life. This time, she would ensure that he had nothing to worry about in his entire life.Yun Shu did not know what Ye Qingtang was thinking about. He thanked her wholeheartedly.However, a pair of fierce and evil eyes scanned Ye Qingtang and Yun Shu.Lu Xiuwen squinted his eyes. He had a decent endowment. The only person he could treat as an opponent in this assessment was Yun Shu, born in the Liuyun family clan. However, he did not expect that Yun Shu would be so gentle towards Ye Qingtang.Candidates who finished the Path to Heaven were waiting for further assessment. They were not aware that their behaviors were observed by the faction Elders from the shiny pearl on the sect door.\u201cWhat do you think of the candidates this year? Anyone suitable?\u201d One of the faction Elders was observing through the Water Moon Mirror and asked the rest of the Elders.\u201cNot many stand out this year. But I think Yun Shu from the Liu Yun family and Lu Xiuwen from the Formidable Heavens Dynasty are not too bad. They should be able to pass the assessment.\u201d One of the Elder touched his beard and said.\u201cBoth Yun Shu and Lu Xiuwen have a good background and endowment. As the Elder of the Sword Faction, Elder Lin, you have a sharp sight.\u201dCandidates who passed the assessment could enter Xuanling Sect and become outer sect disciples. After training, they then had the opportunity to enter the inner sect. Within Xuanling Sect, there were the Sword Faction, Herbal Faction, Array Faction, and Fist Faction. Among the four factions, the Sword Faction was the strongest. Xuanling Sect was famous for its Sword Sect. Elder Lin was the person in charge of the Sword Faction. He stood at quite a high position among the Elders.Besides Elder Lin, the rest of the Elders of other factions also focused on Lu Xiuwen and Yun Shu.While everyone fixed their eyesights on the two people, one small-figured Elder with an extremely sharp sight noticed the girl who was chatting with Yun Shu through the Water Moon Mirror.\u201cAll of you think highly of Yun Shu and Lu Xiuwen, but I feel this girl is quite interesting.\u201d The Elder smiled and said.The rest of the Elders turned and stared at him.\u201cI think the girl was recommended by Mu Su. She is called Ye Qingtang with no special background. No one has heard of this name as well.\u201d The Elder of the Herbal Faction said.\u201cYe Qingtang? Is she from the Ye family of Lin Town?\u201d The Elder of the Fist Faction raised his eyebrows slightly and said.\u201cThe Ye family of Lin Town was not famous in the past. However, there was a genius with a green spirit root who became the disciple of Yunxiao Sect. I think Ye Qingtang is from the same family. However, it would be impossible for Ye Qingtang to stand out when there is Ye You.\u201d Elder Lin took a glance and showed no more interest.It was a miracle for a not-so-famous family clan to have a genius. It would be impossible to have two.\u201cThings are not predictable. I like this girl a lot. Just now on the Path to Heaven, she was much more stable than the two people from the Liu Yun family and the Formidable Heavens Dynasty.\u201d The Elder who had a special preference for Ye Qingtang did not bother with what the rest said.\u201cThe Path to Heaven only focuses on one\u2019s state of mind and not their endowment. Even though the Array Faction that you are in charge of does not have high requirements for spirit root, you should not be so confident of that now, Elder Qin.\u201d Elder Lin glanced at the Elder.\u201cWe shall wait to see her spirit root then.\u201d The Elder of the Herbal Faction suggested.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of the Strongest Female Emperorchapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe first step of the sect assessment was to assess the candidates\u2019 spirit roots.Red ones were inferior-grade, orange and yellow ones were medium-grade, and green ones were superior-grade. If one possessed a blueish-green spirit root, they would be able to skip the outer sect and become an inner sect disciple immediately.As for blue and purple spirit roots, no one had seen one for over a thousand years. None of the sect were still hoping for that.The way Xuanling Sect assessed spirit roots was rather special. It did not require candidates to show their spirit root. Instead, they would place their hands on a human-sized Spirit Stone and direct their strength using their spirit root. The Spirit Stone would change into the same color as their spirit root.The order people were tested was based on the sequence in which people finished the Path to Heaven, starting from the last.The first candidate stepped forward and placed his hand on the Spirit Stone. Soon, the ivory stone turned yellow in color.\u201cYellow spirit root, next,\u201d A middle-aged man who was in charge of the assessment said.That candidate was quite delighted. His yellow spirit root was inferior to a green spirit root, but he was qualified to enter the sect at least.Candidates who followed up all showed yellow or orange colors.At last, Lu Xiuwen stepped forward. Everyone focused on him, and even the middle-aged man who was bored with orange and yellow colors also showed some interest.Lu Xiuwen walked towards the giant Spirit Stone and placed his hand on the stone.At that instant, a spark of green appeared and covered the entire Spirit Stone within a second.\u201cGreen spirit root, not bad.\u201d The middle-aged man looked at Lu Xiuwen in contentment.Green spirit root was quite rare. Disciples with green spirit roots could all enter the inner sect after training in the outer sect. Lu Xiuwen was expected to be an inner sect disciple with his green spirit root.Lu Xiuwen smiled gently. He lifted up his chin slightly and stepped back when everyone looked at him with admiration.\u201cI think Lu Xiuwen definitely can pass the assessment since he is from the Formidable Heavens Dynasty.\u201d\u201cI agree. He stands out with that green spirit root. Even if the other assessments are not up to expectation, his spirit root will grant him into the sect.\u201dCandidates who had their spirit roots assessed could not help but envy him.There were many sect assessments. One would fail if they made any mistake. However, a green spirit root would serve as insurance to cover for any possible mistakes in other assessments.One would need to pass all assessments successfully if their spirit roots were not superior. For example, they would say goodbye to the sect if they made any mistake in any assessment with their orange or yellow spirit roots.Yun Shu was the next person after Lu Xiuwen.Yun Shu was not arrogant like Lu Xiuwen. He smiled gently and nodded towards the middle-aged man with respect. He then placed his hand on the Spirit Stone.Another round of applause was heard when the green color appeared.\u201cGreen spirit root.\u201d The middle-aged man was in a very good mood now. It made the assessment this year more interesting when two green spirit roots appeared.The better the quality of one\u2019s spirit root, the faster the speed of cultivation. Their strength would be purer as well. The quality of spirit root served as the foundation for a person. One could achieve higher levels with a better spirit root.Yun Shu stepped back humbly and looked towards Ye Qingtang instinctively.Ye Qingtang\u2019s spirit root was the only one left to assess among all candidates. Everyone was staring at Ye Qingtang now.No one forgot how easily Ye Qingtang achieved the first place on the Path to Heaven, and she was ahead of everyone.Lu Xiuwen also gazed at Ye Qingtang. His sight was less calm but more doubtful.Ye Qingtang had gained an advantage through the Path to Heaven. If her spirit root was of good quality, she would be another popular candidate whom he had to fight with to enter the sect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
