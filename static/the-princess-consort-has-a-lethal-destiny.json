The small Taoist Temple simply gave off its refreshing presence.It felt just like spring.There was a soft cushion beside the pillars of the temple. A beautiful girl was sitting on the soft cushion.Donned in a Taoist robe, she leaned against the pillar. She also held a particularly eye-catching feather fan in her hand and waved it slowly in her fair-skinned hand.The little bell on her wrist rang twice occasionally in correspondence to her movements.Her long hair was rolled up into a small, half-sized bun. There was a wooden hair stick inserted horizontally into the bun. The black hair that the bun did not hold spilled down her shoulders. Her long and narrow eyes gave off an air of laziness.\u201cOh!\u201d The old man across her sighed several times.\u201cIt had just been a while, and you have sighed more than ten times now.\u201d Xie Qiao stopped fanning with her hand. She rubbed the feathers on the fan with her other hand. \u201cIf you really don\u2019t want me to go, just let the kid go and deliver a message. It\u2019s not as if they can tie me up with a rope, anyway.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything.\u201d The old Taoist master rolled his eyes.\u201cOver the past few years, I have finally turned you into a half-immortal with a sage-like character. The moment you speak, all my hard work is wasted again. If someone sees your behavior, do you think that the Taoist temple will receive any donations at all?\u201d Xie Qiao smirked as she raised her eyebrow.\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I act like this in front of others.\u201d The Old Taoist snorted.Xie Qiao coughed slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re so unreliable, and I am really worried about that. I think I really shouldn\u2019t leave.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t work. Our Water Moon Temple can\u2019t force a young lady from a good family to become a nun. You have lived here for so many years. Your father wants you to marry into a good family and live a normal life. If I stop him, he might take my life.\u201d When the old Taoist master thought of that bandit, he felt his heart seize.Time had passed by so swiftly!He recalled the incident some years back. As he was traveling across the mountains and rivers, he was kidnapped by the ruffian, Xie Niushan.Coincidently, Xie Niushan\u2019s wife gave birth to a girl with a lethal destiny. As soon as she was born, her mother passed away. Her father was almost killed by government officials as well.The strategy advisor in the mountain stronghold was quite capable and immediately figured out that the girl had a lethal influence over her own parents.Xie Niushan had sent this girl away to be raised by the old Taoist master.He gave some money to rebuild Water Moon Temple, and the requirement was to treat this girl well.But he was argumentative, and he offended others the moment he spoke. So, Water Moon Temple would never receive donations. Things only got better when the girl became of age.3\u2018Now that this girl is leaving, it means that the God of Wealth is going away.\u2018But it\u2019s not easy to stop her from leaving.\u2019\u201cAlright then. Pack all your things and get out of here. If I can\u2019t manage this temple anymore, I\u2019ll go to you for help. After raising you for so many years, I don\u2019t believe that your dad would watch me starve by not offering me food.\u201d When the old Taoist master thought of this, he became quite pleased with himself.Xie Qiao grinned with her slightly pale lips.She did not have any possessions and the donation money all belonged to the temple. She would not have to take any money with her because the Xie family would not mistreat her.As they were talking, a young Taoist ran in. \u201cMaster, that woman is asking when the senior sister will be able to leave?\u201d\u201cI will be there in a moment.\u201d Xie Qiao got up and flicked away the non-existent dust on her clothes. \u201cOld man, I\u2019m leaving. Don\u2019t forget to guard yourself against arrogance, impatience, alcohol, and lust.\u201d2\u201cGo, go, go! Are you the master or am I the master?! I don\u2019t need you giving me lectures.\u201d The old man rolled his eyes.Xie Qiao walked out of the temple as if she was floating out.Sunlight from the outside shone on her face, accentuating her already fair skin complexion.Water Moon Temple was not particularly large and they seldom kept visitors overnight.At that moment, a group of people led by Ms. Lu was waiting at the temple\u2019s main hall.They had grown a little anxious after waiting for quite a long time.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen this girl for so many years. I have never seen her come home or pay us a visit during Chinese New Year. Mr. Xie loves her and asked me to pick her up in person. But look at her, it\u2019s been more than an hour, and she hasn\u2019t shown her face yet.\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those who live here in the Taoist temple are inevitably laid back Taoists. They usually don\u2019t care much about worldly matters and their families.\u201d Pei Wanyue smiled.Ms. Lu huffed.This trip was not just to collect Xie Qiao.Before she married Xie Niushan, she had a daughter from her previous marriage and kept her at her mother\u2019s place. With her husband\u2019s permission, she was going to bring her back this time. However, on her way back, she received an untimely messenger pigeon from her husband, saying that his first daughter was getting old. It was time she returned to live a good life.1That was why she had come all the way here.She was Xie Niushan\u2019s third wife. She married him only after the Xie family became officials in the imperial court. So, she did not know who his first wife was.She only heard rumors that his first wife was childhood friends with her husband. The first wife was known as Ms. Peng, and her father was the previous head of the bandits\u2019 mountain stronghold. After he died, her husband and the Peng family had managed the mountain stronghold.It is said that those from the Peng family were not pretty.She was certain that this must surely be the case.Even though she had never met Mrs. Peng, she had met Mrs. Peng\u2019s son, Xie Pinggang, who was Mrs. Lu\u2019s husband\u2019s eldest son.That child was built tough and stocky, plus he was half a head taller than his dad and twice as large as an average person. He was a frightening sight to see. This Xie Qiao was Xie Pinggang\u2019s biological sister, there was no way she would be petite, right?Ms. Lu sighed.\u201cHer father said so too. He was afraid that this child was not pretty, so he wants to bring her home earlier to get her married off\u2026\u201d Ms. Lu rubbed her temples. \u201cThe children from our family are all infamous in the imperial city. Now that we are bringing one more home, we are really going to be the laughingstock of the town.\u201d2Pei Wanyue was shocked too. \u201cBut now, Uncle Xie is no longer a bandit. He can\u2019t exactly go around kidnapping a man to marry my sister, right?\u201d3\u201cI know, right? When the time comes and she can\u2019t marry, Mr. Xie would surely point fingers at me and say that I didn\u2019t put enough effort into it.\u201d Ms. Lu shook her head.Pei Wanyue had always been rather wary of this Ms. Xie.Now that she heard this, she sighed in relief.She was around the same age as Ms. Xie, and they were to enter the imperial city together. At some point, they were going to be up against each other. So if the other\u2019s reputation was in the gutter, then it would not spell anything good for her either.However, if Ms. Xie looked too ugly, it would make Pei Wanyue look good instead.1\u201cRelax, Mother. If I can\u2019t marry, then I can cling on to Father for the rest of my life. There is no way they could blame you for that.\u201d Xie Qiao strode in as she spoke with a soft voice. It sounded weak and feeble.Ms. Lu jumped in shock and turned around immediately. Then, she was stunned.The newcomer was clad in a muted navy colored Taoist robe. She carried herself tall and proud. Her voice was as clear as a river flowing through a bamboo forest. It rang crisp and light.She did not look very lively, but there was a gentle look in her eyes. Her figure was slim; her waist was thin and slender. Even so, not a single part of her suggested she was seductive. She had a light scent of incense on her, and she gave off an otherworldly presence to the point that she made everything around her appear dull\u20261\u201cYou\u2026 you are\u2026\u201d Ms. Lu could not quite believe this. Could this be the ugly Ms. Peng\u2019s daughter?\u201cGreetings, Mother.\u201d Xie Qiao respectfully gave a simple bow. \u201cI am Xie Qiao.\u201dMs. Lu swallowed dryly.Xie Qiao did not pay attention to Ms. Lu and the surrounding people.In fact, she dipped her head slightly. She seemed to be staring at the feathered fan in her hand. At a glance, it looked as if she was not paying attention.Yet the young Taoist by her side knew that she had seen something supernatural, or she had seen through the other person\u2019s intentions.1\u201cYour looks\u2026 looks are not bad. It\u2019s just that you look so lazy, it makes you look improper. When we get back to the imperial city, you cannot act so inappropriately when you meet others. You have to set a good example for both of your younger sisters.\u201dMs. Lu watched her own daughter, then looked back at Xie Qiao. Immediately, she felt a pang of discomfort.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I did not expect her to look so beautiful.\u2018Fortunately, she does not look sensible, and the rich boys in the imperial city have seen all kinds of beauties before.1\u2018When a man looks for a wife, he regards her moral character highly.\u20192Xie Qiao did not have many possessions. After sorting out her stuff, she followed Ms. Lu and her daughter down the mountain.Ms. Lu\u2019s facial expressions turned wacky as she sat in the carriage.\u201cI have never seen a lady like this. It\u2019s not that our family can\u2019t afford to eat meat, and yet she decided to be in the same carriage with a domestic animal. It will take one and a half months to arrive in the imperial city. How smelly would it get when she eats and lives with the animal?\u201d Ms. Lu rubbed her nose as if she was already taking in the scent.1When Xie Qiao went down the mountain, she brought along a bamboo box, and no one knew what was inside it.She also had a live huge fat rooster with her.2That rooster had brightly colored feathers that shone brightly under the sun. Wherever Xie Qiao went, the rooster would follow her closely behind.\u201cMom, the first young lady looks a bit weird, but I can\u2019t tell you exactly what is weird.\u201d Pei Wanyue frowned slightly, \u201cBy the way, she doesn\u2019t seem to be in good health\u2026\u201d\u201cHer health wasn\u2019t good. I heard your Uncle Xie saying that she had an injury since birth.\u201d Ms. Lu nodded her head.\u201cBut for a fine young lady, why did she choose to live in a temple? Isn\u2019t it better to keep her at home if she is not healthy?\u201d Pei Wanyue said again.Ms. Lu was taken aback, and she thought for a while. \u201cIt is said that she must not see her family until she is a grown-up. Otherwise, she may die young.\u201dXie Niushan had only mentioned that to her once, and that was never touched upon ever since.2\u201cI don\u2019t know if your Uncle Xie will regard this daughter highly. I have never heard him mention her. He hasn\u2019t given her anything all these years, as if he has forgotten her. But this time, he has urged me repeatedly to bring her back and take good care of her\u2026\u201d Ms. Lu struggled to make sense of this.1Her husband used to be a bandit, so she did fear him a little.She did not have the guts to make too many predictions.\u201cThe first young lady is so beautiful. When she arrives in the imperial city, Uncle Xie will now pay more attention to her, even if he didn\u2019t like her initially,\u201d Pei Wanyue said softly with a sad and resentful tone.4Ms. Lu was startled by her words.Then she shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019s just beautiful on the outside. Does she know how to play musical instruments or chess, write calligraphy and paint? She doesn\u2019t even understand basic etiquettes. Who will fancy her? When she arrives in the imperial city, you must know how to sweet talk a little. Instead of calling him \u2018Uncle Xie,\u2019 you should address him as Father. Doing this makes us a family.\u201d\u201cCalling him Father? Would Uncle Xie be happy to hear that\u2026\u201d Pei Wanyue was already mentally prepared for that.Although the Pei family were good citizens. They were only merchants, not officials.After her father died, the Pei family had no place for Pei Wanyue. For this trip to the imperial city, she was actually going to seek refuge and live under the Xie family.\u201cHe must be delighted. He mentioned you several times earlier,\u201d Ms. Lu insisted.This stabilized the uneasy mood Pei Wanyue had earlier on.Xie Qiao held the dried little bugs in her hand. She poured them into the small bowl. She watched the big rooster eat with relish.\u201cHah.\u201d After passing a steep slope, Xie Qiao sighed suddenly.After a while, she said to the outside, \u201cStop.\u201dThe coachman outside was stunned and shouted from the outside, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, First Young Lady? The madam said we are in a hurry today, and we must reach the nearby town by dusk.\u201dMs. Lu had brought twenty people on this trip.Originally, this carriage had been prepared for Pei Wanyue, but now it was taken up by Xie Qiao after her unexpected emergence.According to the norm, she should have a maid to aid her in delivering any of her messages. But Ms. Lu did not have that idea and could only speak directly to the servants.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her brows furrowed lightly.\u201cI still have some business to tend to. Tell the madam that we\u2019ll see if we could stay overnight in the mountains tonight,\u201d Xie Qiao said.It was normal to camp out while traveling, after all.The coachman stopped the carriage, rushed to Ms. Lu\u2019s side, and whispered to her ear.Ms. Lu\u2019s face showed her displeasure. \u201cWhat could be so important? She must be so used to acting so wild and fooling around.\u201d\u201cThen should we stop the carriage? Mother, I heard that this area is famous for producing jade\u2026 Precious stones are everywhere in the town\u2019s market. If we could reach the town earlier, then we could have some time to browse the wares,\u201d Pei Wanyue suggested as she cocked her head to the side.1Her voice was soft, making her look even more lovable.Ms. Lu had not spent time with her daughter for a few years now. She missed her so much, so of course, she would cater to her every whim.\u201cGo tell the first young lady that she shouldn\u2019t be so playful and frivolous. If she insists on stopping just to fool around, then she will have to walk to the town on her own.\u201d Ms. Lu was extremely stern.She was not her biological mother, but she was brought back by Xie Niushan in a carriage to be his wife after his previous wife passed.1At the very least, she had the right to educate his children.The coachman conveyed the message back, word for word. When Xie Qiao heard this, her slightly furrowed brows smoothed back out instead as she shook her head.\u201cDa Xiong, let\u2019s get off the carriage.\u201d Xie Qiao said toward the huge rooster.1After she said this, she picked up her heavy bamboo box and hopped off the carriage. \u201cIn that case, you should go together with the madam. I\u2019ll meet up with them tomorrow morning.\u201dBefore this, she did not pay attention to Ms. Lu\u2019s facial features. She only spared her a glance.However, she could tell that her facial features were dull, her face was covered in dust, and her eyes did not have any shine to them. Also, the tip of her nose was red, and the sign of fortune on her face was dull and gloomy. These were all subtle signs of bad fortune.The place that she stopped at was considered to have the highest concentrations of water and wood elements. The air was refreshing and moist. If she were to meditate for a night here before leaving, then she would most definitely clear up the fog in her mind. Those little signs of bad fortune on her face would disappear too.Some would remain in denial no matter how much she attempted to explain. In fact\u2026Xie Qiao squinted her eyes and thought for a moment.With Ms. Lu\u2019s departure, she might experience a loss of fortune, but she could avoid a disaster, and that was good too.The coachman was stunned for a moment. When he looked at the first carriage upfront, he remembered the madam\u2019s words from earlier and figured that it was not a good idea to stay and wait for the first young lady.Besides, Xie Qiao had already lifted that bamboo box onto her back and was headed toward the forest.Her body was thin and slight. Every now and then, she would cough too. That bamboo box seemed like it would break her spine at any minute.Meanwhile, that huge rooster stuck close to her tail. It was a strange and mysterious sight to behold.2Xie Qiao walked for about an hour or so as she reached a place.Suddenly, her footsteps halted.\u201cSo it\u2019s here? Then you have to stay put. As you can see, I\u2019m rather frail. All this physical work has gotten me beat. If we dig the wrong spot, I am definitely not going to start over,\u201d Xie Qiao said to the air.In the direction she was staring at, there was a floating figure.It had the shape of a rather dashing man. The only thing about it was that it looked rather dumb.On his face was a scar that cut diagonally along his face. It was still dripping red, and his eyes were bulging. He was dressed in normal clothes.However, only Xie Qiao could see this sight.\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d The soul\u2019s voice was hoarse. It sounded horrifying.After he said that, he even floated over and stretched his head out. It seemed as if he was extremely worked up.If anyone else were here, they would not hear this hoarse sound. Perhaps they could feel the chilling breeze pass them by and hear the rustle from it.\u201cStay away from me, otherwise I\u2019ll exorcise you.\u201d Xie Qiao rolled her eyes at this ghoul. \u201cYou may think that you have died in vain. In my eyes, it all happened for a reason.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then she crouched down, took out a small shovel from the bamboo box, and dug a hole on the spot.\u201cAre you saying that I deserved to die?\u201d The ghoul was raging in his fury, and the leaves under Xie Qiao\u2019s feet began rustling.Xie Qiao was not frightened at all and said, \u201cThe appearance you have now is the state you were in at the point of death. Your eyes are bulging red, and your beard is slightly yellow. At first glance, I can see that you are a hot-tempered and impatient person. This kind of temperament will inevitably lead you to misfortune. You breathe through your mouth too, and you have black spots behind your ears, that\u2019s a sign of misfortune where you will die at a foreign place. One\u2019s appearance\u2026 is formed through one\u2019s thoughts. Do you understand?\u201dThe ghoul\u2019s eyes seemed to turn even redder now.It moved threateningly like it wanted to eat her alive.As the ghoul was approaching Xie Qiao, it could smell the faint fragrance of incense on her body.Suddenly, the ghoul stopped and calmed down.\u201cYou\u2019re right, I was acting impulsively and got my master into trouble. If it weren\u2019t for me, my master\u2019s actions wouldn\u2019t be revealed, and I wouldn\u2019t be hunted down. Now I am dead here, and my master\u2019s state of life or death remains unknown\u2026\u201d Suddenly, he covered his face and started crying.\u201cShut up, don\u2019t make so much noise.\u201d Xie Qiao was a little impatient.\u201cHic!\u201d The ghoul instantly stopped crying. \u201cMy house is far away from here. I only request that you find me an auspicious land and get me buried there, Master. Nothing else\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if that\u2019s your request, I may not necessarily do it,\u201d Xie Qiao laughed.\u201c\u2026\u201d The ghoul was grief-stricken.\u201cThe feng shui here could have been very good. There is a dense forest, the southern mountain is a jade stone mountain, and water from the northern mountains gathers here to form a blue lake. This place can be regarded as an auspicious water gathering. However, the jade stone mountain has been heavily dug up now, leaving uncountable holes all over the place. There is too little grass and trees in the mountain, and the humidity in the forest cannot be dissipated. Eventually, this place is going to be a place filled with Yin energy. You are dead, but you are still so hot-tempered\u2026\u201d Xie Qiao sighed.\u2018There is no problem at all if he only stays there for a few years. But he will never get the chance to be reborn if he stays here for a long time.\u2019Xie Qiao felt resigned.The sun was setting now, and she did not feel like crouching down and digging holes on the ground to find bones.\u2018But that would not do, I have to accumulate good karma for myself.\u2019She did not know if she had been reborn without drinking the Soup of Forgetfulness, which might be the reason why she could see souls after she was born.In the past, whenever she was approached by the Yin energy of a soul, she would get sick. So she had to stay in a Taoist temple most of the time.Her master\u2019s name was Mo Lingzi, the fifty-eighth successor of Water Moon Temple. He was not talented, and that was why he was not famous. However, Water Moon Temple had been built for many years in a deep-rooted lineage. All of those had protected her for more than ten years.Later, she studied with Mo Lingzi and delved into the books at the temple.Occasionally, she would help some souls pass on. As she got older, the ghosts stopped affecting her as much.Moreover, if she wanted to cure her problem of seeing souls, she had to solve it from its root. She would reap the benefits whether she captured or helped them pass on.\u2018I\u2019m already lucky to be able to live.\u2018So, naturally, I have to live well.\u2019\u201cYour bones have been buried quite deep down.\u201d Xie Qiao gasped for breath and sat on the ground, looking a little tired.The ghoul smirked and said, \u201cI watched them buried me. It was raining at that time, and they were afraid that the water would wash me out. So they dug the pit until it was eight or nine feet deep. By the way\u2026 there is some money in my clothes. Treat that as a small gift from me with due respect.\u201d\u201cHumph.\u201d Xie Qiao let out a faint nasal sound.As the sky was getting darker, Xie Qiao continued to work faster.The bones could not be shrunk into a ball, so the area she had to dig in the ground was quite large.The ghoul could not do anything and just looked on eagerly.In the midst of it, Xie Qiao took a break several times. Her delicate appearance made him want to take a shovel and start digging himself.But he was a ghoul, and he could not touch anything solid.2Plus, when he smelled the scent on her body, he did not dare move.In the bamboo box beside her were stacks of talismans. The ghoul was unsure of what use they were for.There was also a huge rooster.He had also slaughtered chickens before he was dead, but now he was flustered by the stare of a rooster.There was a stream of Yang energy in this big rooster. He was very afraid that a sudden crowing from this creature might cause his soul to disappear into thin air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The surroundings had already turned dark.There was only a single lantern hanging from a nearby tree. That flame wiggled and flickered as a slight breeze blew past. It looked like a will-o\u2019-the-wisp.\u201cLooks like we\u2019ve reached the bones.\u201d Xie Qiao put on a pair of lamb leather gloves and slowly picked the bones out.This ghoul had died half a year ago, so the bones were pretty clean. If it were a rotting corpse, then she would rather be unethical than do such work.Xie Qiao took extra care as she moved the bones.\u201cA-a ghost!\u201d Not far behind, someone suddenly shouted. Then they scrambled away.Xie Qiao turned back when she heard. \u201cThis is not good. Someone could actually see you?\u201dThe ghoul\u2019s eye twitched.Nope\u2026 Instead, he thought that the ghost that the frightened guy was talking about was not him. He was talking about this Master.That guy had originally just wanted to find some place to take a leak. Instead, he got so scared that he forgot to pull his pants back up as he tottered back to his team.\u201cG-ghost! There, more than one hundred feet away. There\u2019s a female ghost!\u201d This guy was frightened to bits.His voice was so loud that he woke up the whole team who were resting at the camp.\u201cWhat\u2019s all this ruckus about?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing asked.1\u201cSir, it\u2019s rather dark out tonight, so a guy was too cowardly and scared himself. I have sent someone to see to it,\u201d the subordinate answered immediately.Not long after that, the good number of men that he had sent ran back. All of them were shaking and nervous.He could tell that there would not be any sleep tonight, so Zhao Xuanjing summoned these people into the tent.\u201cS-sir\u2026 Not far away from where I was waiting, I saw a female ghost\u2026 There were will-o\u2019-the-wisps floating around the female ghost. As I peeked, she seemed as if she was munching on something. Only the bare white bones were left\u2026\u201d The men\u2019s faces blanched as they remembered the scene earlier. They really could not stand it.4It was not like that they were cowardly; it was just that\u2026 if it were just the usual hoodlums, they could handle those without a single thought.But who knew what that thing was!There were some things that the speaker did not state clearly. He thought that the thing the female ghost was eating was none other than a person. For the instance he glanced at her, he thought he saw her throwing the remaining bones onto the ground.\u201cTake me there to check it out.\u201d Zhao Xuanjing immediately stood up; it was getting interesting.4When he said this, his subordinate\u2019s expressions changed. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t, Sir! If something were to happen to you, how are we going to explain things to the master?\u201d1Zhao Xuanting did not listen and went out in stride.The men quickly followed. In a flash, flaming torches gathered together with six layers of men surrounding Zhao Xuanjing. These bodyguards were all well equipped with sabers. Their faces were cautious, like they were prepared for battle.Naturally, Zhao Xuanjing was not completely calm either.When it came to supernatural activities like ghouls, demons, or deities, it was best not to get involved in these kinds of matters. But if he did not get to the bottom of this, these bodyguards would continue to be in a state of chaos.Instead of running off in the night, why not experience it himself?With each step, he rushed closer to where the female ghost was.\u201cQuite a number of people have come,\u201d the ghoul mumbled to Xie Qiao.His whole form was also squatting on the ground. It was like he was tired of standing.Xie Qiao had also just finished picking out the corpse bones.\u201cCrack, crack, crack\u2026\u201dWith a piece of cloth, the bones were all wrapped up. When the bones knocked against each other, it created a muffled knocking sound.It was his own bones, but why did he feel so terrified when he saw the Master\u2019s pale and sinister face?\u201cPerfect, I\u2019m starting to get tired too. Now that there\u2019s such a huge pit here, it would be bad if someone were to fall in. Shall we ask them to fill it back up?\u201dXie Qiao dragged the package as she glanced over at her handiwork in a daze. Her gaze was not focused.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

People who do not run must be fools!\u2018Should I help her fill up the hole?\u2019\u2018Heh, if I do, she might end up getting buried together with my bones.\u2019The moment Zhao Xuanjing saw the figure of the woman, his face stiffened.But the next moment, he saw the huge rooster and\u2026the bamboo box next to the female ghost.\u2018This female ghost carries baggage when she goes out?\u20192\u2018Moreover, a rooster can drive away evil spirits and avoid misfortunes. How can it hang around a female ghost?\u20191\u201cShe is a person. You guys are really making a fuss out of this.\u201d Zhao Xuanjing also breathed a sigh of relief, but he was a bit arrogant in his tone. Then he walked casually toward Xie Qiao.1Xie Qiao stood on the spot and waited.As they got closer to Xie Qiao, they saw her more clearly.They all found the moment particularly strange.\u2018This young lady is digging holes here alone in the middle of the night? Is her zodiac a dog?\u20192\u201cWho are you? What are you doing here in the middle of the night?\u201d asked the imperial bodyguard captain instantly. After he spoke, he glanced at the suspicious sack of cloth on the ground. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201d Xie Qiao coughed slightly.Then she took her time and gazed over unhurriedly, \u201cI\u2026 was passing by here as I felt something wasn\u2019t smelling right. So I started digging. I didn\u2019t expect myself to go at it so seriously. Time passed by quickly, and it was already midnight. Now I have left behind such a big hole. This hole can\u2019t be left here. You came at the right time. I wonder if anyone is willing to help fill up the hole?\u201dAs soon as Xie Qiao finished speaking, a chilling breeze passed them by.This summer night had to be scorching hot. However, when the chilling breeze passed them by, they could not help but shiver.1Everyone subconsciously swallowed down a mouthful of saliva.\u201cYou will be blessed by doing good deeds,\u201d Xie Qiao said solemnly.\u201cYoung Lady, what are you digging on the ground?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing glanced over her face and asked her with a deep gaze and tone.Xie Qiao furrowed her brows together. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing important. Just a lost little lamb. I\u2019m preparing to take it to an auspicious land tomorrow.\u201d\u201cA lost lamb?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing raised his brows.When everyone heard this, they were even more terrified.The light from the lantern shone at the man in the middle, making him more conspicuous.Xie Qiao looked over and found that this man looked young. He was about twenty years old, had a pure spirit, and strong bones. His physical complexion was like a floating cloud. He stood firmly and resembled a turquoise stone. His eyes were shining like stars. He had a high nose bridge, impressive tall height, and smooth skin. With his long brows and lively looks, he really had a noble disposition!2\u2018I did not expect to encounter such a rare person this early into my travels.\u2018He is a fine-looking man!\u2019\u2018Although he has a noble appearance, I can\u2019t tell when it comes to the other aspects.\u2018Otherwise, there would not be so many guards around him\u2026\u2018There seems to be something wrong with his right hand.\u2019Xie Qiao stared at him for quite some time, but he still looked calm, and an inquiring expression started showing up on his face.In the past, many looked at him in this way, and those gazes annoyed him. But for this lady, for some reason, he did not feel that she was looking at him personally, but\u2026The way she looked felt like she was reading a book and admiring a painting.He was not angry at all as he did not sense any bad intention in her gaze.Xie Qiao stopped gazing and lowered her head, returning to her previous manner.\u201cIf you wish to see this lost little lamb, you can do so. But when you open this cloth, you will come in contact with some negative energy that you should not touch. You have to rebury it. Otherwise, your luck will be slightly worse in these coming few days.\u201d Xie Qiao had a subservient look on her face. Her voice was calm, as if it was a small matter to her.\u2018There are so many of them, and I can\u2019t stop them if they want to see it.\u2018It is just that this ghoul is very short-tempered.\u2019\u2018If the ghoul gets angry, this will inevitably bring bad luck to them, which is only natural.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could it not be angry?The imperial bodyguard walked over and opened up the package.Sure enough, the ghoul\u2019s expression turned dark.A taint of black smoke started spreading.It was all Yin energy, the others could not see it, but Xie Qiao could. She did not like it. It was an eyesore.This ghoul was not even a strong one. Although Yin energy had spread out, it was not a big problem. It was just a few days of bad luck; once you got used to it, it was fine.The imperial bodyguard captain shuddered.\u201cSir, these are human bones,\u201d the imperial bodyguard captain answered promptly.Zhao Xuanjing found this girl very suspicious.\u201cMiss, it\u2019s late at night, and you are digging up bones here\u2026 What are you doing? Could you\u2026 be raiding tombs?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s brows furrowed. His voice was a little cold.But anyone with some sense would suspect if this lady had a specific fetish at this point.Things like tomb raiding really did not match this lady\u2019s looks.\u201cSir, are you blind? This is a grave without a tombstone. And even if I wanted to raid the tomb, I wouldn\u2019t look for a peasant who died such a gruesome death. Even though there may be a couple of silver, he died a violent death. I would still need to offer up the silver pieces as an offering for a few days to cleans them of bad luck before I could use them. Otherwise, they would bring misfortune upon others. \u201dHer voice was soft as a whisper and seductively light, but the words that came out of her mouth were a little harsh.The corner of Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s lips curled.Was he blind?\u201cSince it is a grave without a tombstone, then how do you know he was a peasant? Since you are not here to steal, then why are you keeping these silver pieces? Miss, why does it seem like you are contradicting yourself?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing cast a judgmental glance at her, but his tone sounded flippant.\u201cThis was all from my calculations.\u201d Xie Qiao was concise and comprehensive. She was as nonchalant as ever.Zhao Xuanjing was utterly flabbergasted.Just as he was about to continue his questioning, his gaze fell on the bamboo basket. It seemed to have some yellow-colored talismans in it. Besides that, there were compasses and similar stuff in there.He was suddenly stunned. \u201cYou are a quack sorceress? \u201dA quack sorceress this pretty? This was pretty rare, right?Xie Qiao frowned.She did not like being called this way.\u201cCall me a half-immortal.\u201d Xie Qiao nodded. Suddenly, she bent down with a grunt as she yanked out a divination banner cloth. On it was written, \u201cSharp-tongued and straightforward half-immortal Xie.\u201d8The audience felt their eyes twitch.Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s eyelids twitched. Though he was rather calm himself, his gaze on Xie Qiao was full of doubt.\u201cA Taoist who knows divination?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing asked as he forced a smile.When Xie Qiao heard this description, she felt uncomfortable, but she still nodded unwillingly. Then she pointed at the bones on the ground as she said, \u201cHe died here. This location isn\u2019t nice, so I want to move his bones and build a grave for him. Now that you have seen his bones, he will not be happy. So I will have to ask you to follow me back. All of you who have laid eyes on this will have to rebury him.\u201dZhao Xuanjing did not believe it at first.He had never seen a girl practice divination before.However, this girl was talking as if she knew her stuff, and she looked rather ethereal. Plus, she was dressed appropriately in Taoist robes. It certainly did not look like she was a tomb raiding thief. In fact, the way she carried herself was too flamboyant for that.\u201cYou say you know divination\u2026 How can I believe you? How about this? I have quite a number of subordinates, so you\u2019ll read their fortunes. If you get them right, then we\u2019ll do as you say. If you get them wrong, then we\u2019ll send you to court.\u201d Zhao Xuanjing suddenly smiled as he said this.Xie Qiao sighed.She understood. Just because she had the look of a swindler, people loved to say this when they consulted her for the first time.\u201cDeal. However\u2026 I will not do many. Today\u2026 I\u2019ll only read the fortunes for only three persons and I won\u2019t go too deeply into it,\u201d Xie Qiao said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, he never had a lot of business.Later, she spread news that the Taoist Master of Water Moon Temple was awesome and only read the fortune of three persons in a day. As soon as the news were out, people living in the vicinity started lining up to see her master.Since many people did not have the chance to see this enigmatic master, they developed more respect for her master.\u2018People regard rare things to be precious. If you do not limit the availability of the service, they would not think it is precious anymore.\u2019\u201cFill this hole up, and I will go with you. I am a little tired. I have to rest while working at the same time.\u201d When Xie Qiao finished speaking, she coughed twice weakly.She did not look to be in the pink of health because her face was as white as a sheet, and her body was so slender.Zhao Xuanjing made a hand gesture, and several imperial bodyguards went forward and filled up the big hole without much effort.1Xie Qiao stayed true to her words and followed them to their camp.The nobleman also offered her to stay in a small tent. She walked in satisfyingly and sat down. Although she looked a bit lazy and tired, she said, \u201cWell, who will come first?\u201dThe imperial bodyguard captain simply pointed his finger at a person.\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d The guard who was ordered immediately stood up and sat across Xie Qiao.\u201cI\u2019ll just take a look at your palm and face today.\u201d Xie Qiao\u2019s voice was faint and gentle. \u201cShow me your palm.\u201dThat person obediently followed suit.Xie Qiao held a feather fan and placed the tip of the fan on the other party\u2019s fingertips. She glanced at the palm of his hand. After observing it for a while, she looked at the fingers on the back of his palm.After a moment, she nodded.\u201cYou had no one to depend on at an early age. Then your mom remarried, or you had to be an adopted child of somebody else. Although there is a palm line between your love line and wisdom line, the line is too blurry. So after becoming someone else\u2019s son, you should be extremely happy. You still have a brother, but you are predestined not to be able to reunite with him in this life.\u201dSaying that, Xie Qiao raised her head slightly and glanced at this person.\u201cYour septum is clearly visible, and there\u2019s a distortion in your nasal bones. Plus, you have too much yin energy in your body. Your wife will tend to give birth to daughters but not sons\u2026\u201d Xie Qiao\u2019s tone suddenly sank. \u201cThere is a cross in your nasolabial folds, which is a fate of drowning. There is dark energy accumulating on your forehead, and there are black spots on the corners of your lips. Once you have this sign, you will fall into a well and die in fifty days. You\u2026 already have this fate for quite some time. Your lifespan is ending in just a few days, so be prepared.\u201d4After Xie Qiao finished speaking, she sighed.\u2018I do not know from where he had come in contact with a drowned ghoul. Now the ghoul has possessed his forehead.\u2019Xie Qiao covered his forehead with her hand.The appearance of this male ghoul was even worse than the male corpse she had been digging up just now. Both had died of a misfortune.The ghoul had a swollen body. Water still dripped from his body. His white eyes were rolled up, and he did not say a word. He was still very dirty. She did not know how long he had been soaking in water until he could no longer speak.\u201cMe? Fall into a well and die?!\u201d The bodyguard suddenly burst into laughter.\u201cIs anything she said before the last one accurate?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing asked.\u201cYoung Master, it is not accurate at all.\u201d The bodyguard immediately shook his head, \u201cI am the only son of my parents, and my mother never remarried. Now my wife is pregnant and has yet to give birth!\u201d\u201cYoung Lady, do you understand now?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing asked.Xie Qiao nodded. \u201cOh\u2026it seems that I was wrong.\u201dZhao Xuanjing was quite surprised at her readiness to admit her mistakes.\u201cPerhaps your mom didn\u2019t tell you about her remarriage. Why don\u2019t you go home and ask? You don\u2019t have to be too sad when you learn about the truth. The kindness shown by foster parents is much greater than biological parents. It seems like your relationship with your foster father is greater,\u201d Xie Qiao said.Zhao Xuanjing almost giggled.\u2018Where did such an obnoxious silly girl pop up from? She\u2019s really offensive.\u2019\u201cYoung Lady, you are still at a young age\u2026 Where are your parents? How could they let you go about swindling people like this?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing smiled as if he had not seen such an interesting character in a long time.\u201cA swindler?\u201d Xie Qiao looked a little unhappy.Someone predicted that she would have a short life expectancy. She had agreed because it was true.2\u2018But it was too much to call me a swindler!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The teasing faces from earlier were gone in an instant.\u201cI said I\u2019ll read three people\u2019s fortunes. There are still two left.\u201d Xie Qiao composed herself as she continued.Zhao Xuanjing thought this lady was pretty interesting.Especially when she was acting all pitiful. She seemed rather seductive at that time.2For some reason he could not fathom, he casually reached out and pushed his own imperial bodyguards aside.She continued to read fortunes.\u201cYou have the look of someone who will aid the emperor. But somehow this trait isn\u2019t that prominent. There\u2019s only a faint inclination toward that look. It might be a hidden gift, but there will come a day where you will shine bright,\u201d Xie Qiao said briefly.It was obvious that this person was fairly well off. It would not be enough for her to only say that he was wealthy and smart.Just as Xie Qiao said this, the imperial bodyguard immediately turned back and shot a look at Zhao Xuanjing.Zhao Xuanjing was a little surprised.\u201cThis is the last one. I\u2019ll see if you will have a smooth journey, alright?\u201d Xie Qiao said.As she said this, Xie Qiao took out a tortoiseshell and three copper coins. \u201cClang, clang, clang.\u201d She shook the coins. After a few rounds, she tapped her fingers and mumbled as she calculated.It certainly seemed like she was scaring people with the act.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand if I were to go deep into the topic.\u201d After a while, Xie Qiao packed her things and said, \u201cyou lot are not allowed to leave the forest before 11 in the morning. Otherwise, misfortune will befall all of you. \u201dZhao Xuanjing\u2019s eyes were dark. No one knew what he was thinking about.\u201cSend her to court tomorrow morning.\u201d His words rang, simple and clear.It did not matter if she was accurate or not. It was too dangerous for a lady to be out in the wilderness at such an ungodly hour. She needed to be taught a lesson.2Then only would she learn.Xie Qiao was speechless as she cocked an eyebrow.This was definitely not the first time someone had threatened her to send her to court. She was not the least bit afraid.Since she would only be sent to court tomorrow, then she should rest well tonight. After digging the ground for so long, her limbs were all sore now.Xie Qiao was easily content with what she had. She headed over and curled up in a random corner in the tent. Soon she closed her eyes and fell asleep.Outside, The imperial bodyguard captain looked at Qin Zhi and asked, \u201cDo you want to write home to ask about this?\u201d\u201cMr. Zhou, did you really really believe this girl\u2019s words?\u201d Qin Zhi laughed. \u201cOf all my years, don\u2019t I know my own father well enough? It would be more believable to say that I\u2019ll die from falling into a river, but falling down a well? We\u2019ve been out in the wilderness all day lately. Where are we to find wells? \u201dThis maiden was pretty young, but she lied like breathing.She did not look half bad, but how could she proclaim herself as a half-immortal?\u201cDon\u2019t you think\u2026 that when she said about aiding the emperor\u2026\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou lightly frowned.\u201cIt does sound a bit scary.\u201d Qin Zhi nodded. \u201cBut it\u2019s most probably because this girl hasn\u2019t seen the world yet. Just think about it. Within our ranks, except for the young master, you are the most intimidating one. Of course she would say pleasant words to flatter you.\u201dNow when he put it that way, it made perfect sense.Zhao Xuanjing did not care whether she was spitting nonsense.Seeing that Xie Qiao was young, he did not tie her up. After they sent her to court tomorrow, she would learn her lesson and be a good person. She would know that out in the wilderness, there were many \u201cpredators\u201d like him lurking out there.The next morning, before the sun was up, they woke up and left.Xie Qiao did not stop them either.What will happen, will happen. It was not like she could rush to that person and hug his legs to stop him from taking another step.This forest had been rather big in the past, but after they found a jade mine, it started to shrink bit by bit. It was only that these parts had slightly nicer views, but after the forest\u2026There were bare hills everywhere.If their party wanted to move forward, then they would have to go over that bump up front that was an abandoned mine.1There were only patches of wilted greenery, and the ground was covered in stones. Hill upon hill came up one after another like rolling waves. Even though they were not tempestuous, they were still a melancholic sight to see.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hence, in the past, only commoners would pick and choose some eye-catching stones here.The jade mine in this area was discovered many years ago, which was why this piece of land had been abandoned for a very long time.Zhao Xuanjing was sitting in the carriage.What was said by Xie Qiao yesterday flashed through his mind.\u201cWhat is the time now?\u201d said Zhao Xuanjin in a slothful tone while he opened the window of the carriage with his slender fingers.\u201cYoung Master, there\u2019s still fifteen minutes to go before it\u2019s nine o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d someone said immediately.Zhao Xuanjing squinted his eyes and suddenly spoke indifferently, \u201cStop the carriage and take a rest. We\u2019ll leave after fifteen minutes.\u201d1The imperial bodyguard below him was stunned for a moment. He did not dare to ask more and immediately told everyone to stop their journey to rest and recuperate.After Zhao Xuanjing gave his instructions, he realized how silly he sounded.For some reason, he started to believe what the young swindler said. When he gazed at the sky today, the weather was fine without clouds. \u2018In such clear weather and with so many imperial guards alongside me, what accident could possibly take place?\u2019However, he wanted this young lady to acknowledge her mistake. He planned to lock her up in an administrative office for a few days to teach her a lesson so that she would not be a swindler again.3Xie Qiao was watched over by four people.She had been walking slowly at the end of the line, and she had to pause after taking a few steps.Among the guards who were watching over her was Qin Zhi, the one whose fortune had been read by her.At first, he was angry with the young lady who spat out nonsense.But looking at her delicate and weak appearance, he felt that he, as a grown man, need not take the words of such a young lady to heart.\u201cWhy has the front line stopped? Is the young master really listening to you, young lady?\u201d Qin Zhi murmured.Xie Qiao\u2019s face turned pale. \u201cWhat a good coincidence. I can\u2019t walk anymore.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve only traveled a short distance, and you can\u2019t walk anymore? If this continues, would we have to carry you?\u201d Qin Zhi glanced at Xie Qiao with a disgusted look, but since he could not be angry with this woman, he had no choice but to swallow up his anger.He wanted to walk along with his friends, but he had been ordered to watch over this woman.The young lady walked like a sea turtle who had just landed ashore. She was a bit slow.1\u201cYou don\u2019t have to carry me. Your young master\u2019s carriage will do the job,\u201d Xie Qiao spoke feebly.She was used to taking her time with everything.She was walking quite fast today for her speed. With how fast they had been pressing onward for their journey, she felt like half of her life was gone.\u201cArgh\u2026you\u2019ll be seeing the official in a moment. Yet you dare to fool around here\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, he raised his eyes and vaguely saw smoke and dust coming out from a distance.The front line guards who kept a lookout spotted the incident and immediately reported that to Zhao Xuanjing. Zhao Xuanjing was drinking tea in the carriage. He was shocked to hear of the incident and ordered his horse-riding guards to go to the spot to investigate.The horse-riding guards returned from the investigation in almost no time at all.\u201cYoung Master, in front\u2026an abandoned jade mine had just collapsed, and a lot of rocks went tumbling down. About fifty or sixty feet of the pathway were buried up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhao Xuanjing had his eyelids twitch. \u201cIf we had not stopped, would we be there by now?\u201dWhen the imperial bodyguard captain heard this, he frowned and nodded seriously, \u201cIf you calculate the distance, yes, we should be there by now.\u201dZhao Xuanjing suddenly tightened his eyebrows.He brought along a lot of guards with him, and while fifty or sixty feet of buried pathway would not be enough to bury all of them, they would still suffer losses.If he had bad luck today, even he himself might be gone.This was a pile of mining waste, so there was only a little bit of soil in the area. There were also a lot of useless stones that were thrown all around there, and they slowly piled up to form stone slopes.If they were hit by the stones, they would have been seriously injured if not outright killed.\u201cPlease\u2026 invite the\u2026\u201d Suddenly, he could not utter the word \u2018swindler\u2019.

Xie Qiao could get used to that.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou personally came to request for her, his expression was solemn. \u201cImmortal, our young master wishes to talk to you\u2026\u201dQin Zhi was perplexed. \u201cMr. Zhou? Why are you calling her an immortal? Weren\u2019t we supposed to take her to court?\u201dPlease don\u2019t scare him!This person had read his fortune. First off, she said that he was not his father\u2019s biological son. Secondly, she said he would never have a son. Thirdly, she even said that he will die by falling into a well.There were no other words that could describe how tragic his fate was.4If she were an immortal, what did that make him?Qin Zhi was in a daze, but Xie Qiao suddenly grabbed her head. \u201cHeadache. Can\u2019t walk. I need to rest.\u201dImperial Bodyguard Zhou was silent as he felt his eyes twitch.He felt that these were the girl\u2019s excuses. She was grumbling about their lack of manners yesterday.But when he took a closer look, there was really a sheen of sweat coating her forehead. Her face was shockingly pale. Even her lips were lacking any color.He was shocked at that moment. \u201cCall the accompanying physician over! Immortal, please rest at this cool spot\u2026\u201dXie Qiao nodded.She sat on the ground and immediately opened up the bamboo basket. First, she fed the rooster some food. Then only did she drink some water. After drinking, she said, \u201cDa Xiong, I\u2019m sorry that you have to suffer. You have followed me all this way, but there\u2019s no other way. You could never guess what others are thinking. There are many bad people in this world after all\u2026\u201dThe corner of Imperial Bodyguard Zhou\u2019s lips twitched.1\u201cIt didn\u2019t suffer. Isn\u2019t your chicken for eating\u2026\u201d Qin Zhi was confused. As he stared at that huge rooster, the only thing that went through his mind was that such a fine sturdy chicken would have some nice meat.Xie Qiao\u2019s hands stiffened.Then she slowly let out a sigh as she raised her hand and gently petted the rooster\u2019s feathers.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou glared at Qin Zhi.This dumb brat, why was he not realizing anything yet?!He had even already started calling her an immortal, and he still did not understand?!Her prophecies had proven to be true!\u201cImmortal, Qin Zhi is a brat who has been spoiled by his family. He has no tact. Please do not pay him any mind. In fact, we might even need you to\u2026 \u201d\u201cCough, cough!\u201d Before he could finish, Xie Qiao had a harsh coughing fit. \u201cDa Xiong\u2026 I might not make it. What would happen if I left you behind? You\u2019ll definitely be eaten by evil people\u2026\u201d3She coughed non-stop. Her frail body was trembling like she was about to drop dead at any moment.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou was so scared that he told them to hurry up and bring the accompanying physician over. Soon the accompanying physician ran all the way over, panting. He rushed over like his life depended on it.Xie Qiao stretched out her fair, slender wrist. Her long lashes were fluttering.That wrist so pitifully thin that it was like a stick that would break with a hit and snap with a crack.The physician\u2019s face was flushed from all that running. He hurried and checked Xie Qiao\u2019s pulse on her wrist.\u201cMiss, this illness has been with you since birth, right? Then there shouldn\u2019t be many problems. However, you are still weak. You need to take it easy and keep away from triggers. Rest quietly, when you are well again, there might still be hope surviving.\u201dOf course, if she did not recover, she would die. But that was normal too.When the physician said this, Imperial Bodyguard Zhou did not dare to speak loudly after that.\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 fetch the young master here?\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou asked cautiously after some thought.Xie Qiao did not answer. She looked like she was one step away from death.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou felt like he was stepping on eggshells.Just yesterday, they were rolling their eyes at this girl. Today, they were treating her like glass. The problem was that, after speaking to this girl, they were chased off before they said two sentences to each other. Something did not seem right here.When he saw Zhao Xuanjing, Imperial Bodyguard Zhou related everything to him.\u201cThe physician had seen her. It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s faking it. When she coughed, I was really scared that she would cough her lungs out. It\u2019s likely that she won\u2019t be walking here. What do you think we should do\u2026 Sir?\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou felt troubled as he asked the question.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Today, she looked like she was a step away from death.\u2018This feels like a hoax.\u2019Zhao Xuanjing was also a little skeptical about her. But this person had saved his life after all. Regardless of whether she was really good at fortune-reading or it was just blind luck, he owed her a favor. He had to go and see her in person.Immediately, he asked his man to turn the carriage around.\u201cWe are traveling in a simple and crude manner. If you don\u2019t mind, Ms. Xie, you can ride in my carriage.\u201d Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s temperament is a bit cold, and he did not look very approachable. However, he was still saying in a polite way.She propped herself up.Then she took two steps forward.Suddenly she halted again.\u201cDo you still want to send me to the court?\u201d She turned her head and looked at him indifferently. Then she furrowed her brows. \u201cIf I am not in good health, I will die if I am sent to the administrative office. If I have to die either way, it would be more dignified to die out of fatigue\u2026\u201dZhao Xuanjing\u2019s eyelids were twitching.This was a difficult person to deal with.\u201cYoung Lady, you are talented, and I\u2019m treating you as my guest. Since your prophecies came true, you cannot be a tomb raider. How can we send you to the administrative office?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s said with a sharp but deep and calm gaze.Xie Qiao moved her feet lightly on the ground twice, shaking off her Taoist robe in a little casual manner.\u201cThen please send me to the nearest town called\u2026Floating Pavilion Town.\u201d Xie Qiao did not raise her head much, and her voice was buoyant and light.Since she said that without much strength, her words were easily despised by others.She looked more like a scared kid.\u201cDo you have relatives in the town?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing asked one more question.\u201cYeah.\u201d Xie Qiao nodded. \u201cI have a mom and a younger sister.\u201dThe corners of Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s mouth twitched, and he nodded before he said quietly, \u201cAlright, but I have a few more questions to ask you. I wonder if you can answer, Young Lady?\u201d\u201cYou could ask me again in the carriage. I am tired.\u201d Xie Qiao lowered her head.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou and the others had been watching by the side. At first, they felt that their young master\u2019s attitude toward this young lady was pretty good. But after seeing the pitiful and aggrieved look of the half-immortal, they could not help but thought that their young master\u2019s tone of voice might be too cold and fierce to her.1Zhao Xuanjing looked at Xie Qiao several times.This half-immortal\u2026 was pretty good.It was just that her rate of speech was somewhat infuriating. She was gasping for air as she spoke, and her weakness made people feel as if she was about to kick the bucket.1He had always been afraid of women who loved crying. If the woman\u2019s voice sounded like a mosquito, he would avoid her at all cost. So, when he was listening to this half-immortal talk now, he could feel his temples throbbing.Xie Qiao was too lazy to avoid arousing misunderstandings. She simply hugged Da Xiong and got into the carriage after the young master.\u201cIt\u2026 also needs to take a carriage?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing lost his cool composure.He leaned back his body subconsciously.Xie Qiao lowered her head and leaned slightly against the carriage door. She hugged the huge rooster tightly and used her foot to push against her bamboo box.Her look felt like a good lady who had just met up with a bandit.\u201cWhy not?\u201d she said with a trembling and low voice. She looked really subservient.Zhao Xuanjing had never ridden with a domestic animal in the same carriage.2But if he did not agree, it would appear that he was domineering over the weak. Then he glanced at the huge rooster coldly and then muttered, \u201cOf course it can.\u201dXie Qiao slightly curled up the corners of her lips, and her hand was ruffling the smooth feathers at the back of the huge rooster.\u201cMs. Xie, what temple did you practice in?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing opened his mouth and asked. After thinking for a moment, he added. \u201cWhich Master did you learn from?\u201d\u201cI have been resting at Water Moon Temple since young as I was ill for a long time. It\u2019s not worth mentioning, but I could tell a person\u2019s bad luck. If I am able to calculate a person\u2019s fortune correctly, it must be a coincidence.\u201d Xie Qiao was trying to be humble about herself, which was something she rarely did.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So it was reasonable if she would not care to be bothered with him today.\u201cMs. Xie, could you help me check if there will be any other dangers or obstacles along my journey?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing looked up and down Xie Qiao\u2019s face. For some reason, his tone was a lot gentler.Xie Qiao rolled her eyes in her mind.He would not just encounter dangers in this journey alone. There was no way this person would ever live a peaceful life.She had never seen anyone who attracted spirits and ghouls as much as he did. The amount of black smog oozing from his body was enough to reach the skies!She had to keep her distance from people like this \u2026\u201cYou will\u2026 encounter danger. Just be more careful. If we have to perform divination for every little thing, then all the fortune-tellers would die from exhaustion\u2026 Besides, Heaven\u2019s secrets must not be divulged,\u201d Xie Qiao said lackadaisically.1Smack.A silver ingot was placed on the small desk in the carriage.Judging by the size, it should be worth 10 taels.\u201cDanger\u2019s close.\u201d Xie Qiao took the silver and kept it in her bamboo basket.3Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s eyebrows rose. Barely holding back his laughter, he asked, \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201dXie Qiao kept quiet.Zhao Xuanjing smiled. He was rather amused, so he deliberately took out silver notes worth 50 taels of silver and placed them on the desk. \u201cHow much of your advice can this buy?\u201d\u201cBe careful of soldier\u2019s blades and sparks.\u201d Xie Qiao continued to pocket the money, then she picked out a yellow talisman and a small copper mirror from her bamboo basket. \u201cHere\u2019s a safety talisman and blessed mirror to keep you safe. All you have to do is to keep them by your side at all times. These are only for this journey, they won\u2019t work for any others.\u201dZhao Xuanjing took the two items over to examine them.The safety talisman was folded into a small triangle. It had a faint scent of incense; somewhat similar to the scent on this maiden.This copper mirror was the size of a palm, the perfect size to be brought around.There was no way to know if the money was worth it. But since he had already bought them, he would use them at some point.Just as Zhao Xuanjing was about to thank her, Xie Qiao spoke first, \u201cI can\u2019t read your fortune even if you pay me more.\u201dIn Xie Qiao\u2019s face, Zhao Xuanjing tucked these items in his arms.\u201cYou have quite the personality, Ms. Xie,\u201d Zhao Xuanjing said with a laugh.Delicate, money-grubbing, and a bit like a bandit.2The reason he said she was like a bandit was not because of her looks, but the air she had that he felt from her.She was just like a stray cat. She looked pretty pitiful and weak at first glance, but her claws were way sharper than a house cat\u2019s.\u201cYou are quite the dawdler, Sir.\u201d Xie Qiao\u2019s voice was mild as she finally raised her chin. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she leaned on the carriage frame and took out a feather fan to fan herself.1Her face was no longer flushed, and neither was she panting. The sickly look she had was all gone now.Zhao Xuanjing glanced her over. He noticed that there was a small bell swaying on the half-immortal\u2019s wrist. It was actually made out of real gold.It may not seem that heavy, but she seemed a little less forlorn with that.When he saw her fair wrist move, he felt seduced as well.2He looked to the side.They were about to reach Floating Pavilion Town.This group was obviously planning to rest in the town.They had originally wanted to send her to an inn, but Xie Qiao remembered that the Lu mother and daughter duo were strict with rules. They would not be happy to see all these burly men accompanying her, so she alighted at the town\u2019s gate.\u201cQuickly go ask Ms. Xie for tips won\u2019t you?!\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou quickly pushed Qin Zhi.Qin Zhi was like a log, struck dumb on the spot. Each step was hard. \u201cShe is a lady\u2026 She will definitely talk drivel.\u201dImperial Bodyguard Zhou rolled his eyes. \u201cIf she really talks drivel, would the young master invite her for a ride? Would I really tell you all this throughout this whole journey? Your pride is important, but your life is even more important. Besides, this lady just indeed saved our lives. What\u2019s so embarrassing about running along to ask her some quick questions?\u201dThis guy was just shy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His dad loved him so dearly.1But he could not say that the young master was a fool and had been deceived. So he shook his head firmly. \u201cNo, just wait and see, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine. By then, the young master will know how good this pretty lady is at deceiving people.\u201dHe believed in his father! He looked very much like his father!1Imperial Bodyguard Zhou was so angry that he decided to ignore Qin Zhi. He hurried to catch up with Ms. Xie.\u201cMs. Xie\u2026\u201dHe called her twice, but Ms. Xie did not look back. Imperial Bodyguard Zhou anxiously called out to her again, \u201cGrand Immortal, wait for me.\u201dXie Qiao turned around.3\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou\u2019s eyebrows flew up, and he immediately said, \u201cIt\u2019s regarding my friend, Qin Zhi, the one who had his fortune read by you yesterday. Can you help him? He is still young, and his wife is pregnant. If anything bad happens to him, his whole family will have a hard time.\u201dXie Qiao gazed at somewhere else.It just happened that she saw Ms. Lu\u2019s sullen face.Something was on her mind, and she did not wish to say more. She took out a safety talisman. \u201cAsk him to put this close to his body. He can hold it at bay for a while, but not for his whole life. His situation is different. If he doesn\u2019t resolve the fundamental problem, he will have to face death sooner or later.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, I will persuade him,\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou said immediately.\u2018I would rather believe it to be true than otherwise.\u2019Regardless of whether this girl was a swindler or a grand immortal, it was better to seek the peace of mind first.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou knew the rules. He had to pay for the fortune-telling.He forked out approximately twenty copper coins.Xie Qiao did not regard it with scorn. Collecting a fee was just her acting according to the law.Her safety talisman could treat the symptoms, but not the root cause. She did not collect too much money because that was inappropriate and not conducive to collecting good karma.Once she delivered the items, Xie Qiao went to find Ms. Lu and her daughter.Besides having a huge rooster by her side, she also carried a huge bamboo box on her back and held a package in her hands. Her demeanor made her look like a refugee.Ms. Li turned her head and glanced at her, and she instantly flew into a rage.\u201cNo wonder my luck is that bad today. Look at her! Everyone would think that I\u2019m abusing her! She has a carriage to ride on but chose to walk with her two feet and sleep in the wilderness all night without caring about her own reputation. What if she gets you into trouble in the future?!\u201d Ms Lu grunted angrily.She had lost her money today!She felt really angry.\u201cMother, don\u2019t say that. She will be my eldest sister in the future. If you are too fierce, others will think you love me and despise her.\u201d Pei Wanyue hurriedly calmed Ms. Lu down. \u201cWe lost a lot of money just now. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not easy to explain about it after we are back\u2026\u201d1Ms. Lu\u2019s face went even paler.It was far more than just losing money.When they went out early this morning, they immediately went to the marketplace that sold jade. They never expected to lose their purse after going around the market and buying two small stones.The purse was stuffed with two hundred silver notes, along with a small pendant.The jade pendant was given to her by her husband, who asked someone to send it over. There were originally two pendants, one for her daughter and the other one for Xie Qiao.The small jade pendant that was meant for Xie Qiao looked like white jade. It had been carved into the shape of a Pixiu, a mythical animal with two horns and wings. She did not know what the implied meaning of it was.The pendant was not big, but it looked quite expensive.The pendant given to her daughter was just as good, and it had an ivory white color.The carving on it was a simple little peach, which was incomparable to the one given to Xie Qiao. That made her more angry as she started making the comparisons.She thought about keeping that pendant with her for a few days. When she arrived in the imperial city, she would say that she was keeping it for this girl and would return it to her on the spot only if her husband mentioned it. But if he did not mention it\u2026Then she would continue keeping it.\u2018Who would know that it had been stolen!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why did you not come back the whole night? I was so worried, we searched for you everywhere. This place is full of crooks, and both your sister\u2019s belongings and mine are all gone!\u201dXie Qiao was calm.\u201cMother, please don\u2019t blame Xie Qiao. She didn\u2019t mean for it to happen. Something must\u2019ve happened that held her back,\u201d Pei Wanyue quickly said, \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re back. Only the material things went missing, but none of us are missing, and that\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. It\u2019s good that you are able to return.\u201d Ms. Lu reached out to grab Xie Qiao\u2019s wrists. \u201cWhy are your hands so cold? Let\u2019s hurry up and go back to the inn to rest. After we have our meal, we\u2019ll stay a day longer at most. Early tomorrow morning, we will leave immediately.\u201dXie Qiao promptly pulled her arm back.She seemed frail at first sight, but her arms were certainly strong.Ms. Lu looked at her empty hands. She was stunned for a moment as rage filled her heart.\u201cMother, you went to Jade Street in Floating Pavilion Town today, right?\u201d Xie Qiao said with a laugh.Ms. Lu was shocked. She denied immediately, \u201cNo. What would I do there?\u201d\u201cMother, you\u2019ve searched high and low for me. Yet you still have the time to buy yourself a new jade hairpin?\u201d Xie Qiao was as calm as ever.Ms. Lu quickly reached up to touch the hairpin on her head. Then her face went dark as she answered, \u201cI bought this from the imperial city.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Xie Qiao answered with the ghost of a smile. Her eyes wandered about, and her voice was faintly discernible. \u201cThe Water Moon Temple isn\u2019t far from here. So I know that aside from the few sculpture artisans working with the local authorities in Floating Pavilion Town, there are only three other artisans who could sculpt.\u201d\u201cThe jade products from the authorities are reserved only for the Royal Family. So most of the products in the market are mined and carved by the townspeople themselves. The jade quality is usually lower than the authorities\u2019 and smaller than theirs as well. But even so, the jade in this place is a cut above those from other regions. The craftsmanship is even more unique. The flower pin on your head is crafted by\u2026 Master Liew from Eastern Street, right? Only he could carve such ethereal designs.\u201dMs. Lu\u2019s mouth was gaping. Her face was flushed red, and she could not say anything.\u201cXie Qiao, this is just a normal design. The imperial city has these too,\u201d Pei Wanyue answered without skipping a beat.\u201cOh?\u201d Xie Qiao gave a faint cold laugh, then she said slowly, \u201cYou can ask anyone and they can tell you that this picture is Master Yun Wei\u2019s latest work from half a month ago. How did it get to the imperial city so soon? Besides, you haven\u2019t been to the imperial city yourself yet, right?\u201d\u201cMaster Yun Wei?!\u201d Pei Wanyue was shocked.A lame hairpin like this was Master Yun Wei\u2019s own design?!Her hometown was rather far from here, but she had heard of Master Yun Wei\u2019s good name too!Master Yun Wei had only come to fame three years ago. He was talented in literature and arts. An artwork from him was worth a thousand taels of gold. His calligraphy had been held in high regard and often copied by other scholars.On second thought, Master Yun Wei was indeed from Yunjin. But as to who he was specifically, no one knew.2Ms. Lu had also heard of Master Yun Wei\u2019s good name. So at that moment, she was astonished too. \u201cWhy would Master Yun Wei design hairpin patterns?\u201d\u201cPerhaps he was too bored,\u201d Xie Qiao said mildly.Ms. Lu could not find anything to refute Xie Qiao\u2019s words.\u201cThen, this hairpin would be\u2026\u201d Ms. Lu\u2019s eyes gleamed. If this were Master Yun Wei\u2019s design, would that mean she had struck gold?\u201cIn your dreams, Mother. But you are free to daydream anyway. Suit yourself.\u201d Xie Qiao lifted her eyebrows as she said this with a light laugh.Ms. Lu\u2019s eyes twitched when she said this.Was she mocking her?\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say\u2026\u201d Ms. Lu felt a little agitated.Pei Wanyue was quick to answer. \u201cMother, Master Yun Wei\u2019s designs are open for people to copy or carve.

She would be glad if she could find some of them back.\u201cI am just passing by the town and staying there for a while. Your father has always been generous. If I come to Floating Pavilion Town and hesitate to buy even a jade hairpin, he would definitely say that I am not caring enough to my daughters,\u201d Ms. Lu said again.Xie Qiao snorted slightly and did not say much.\u201cEven if you want to buy a gold or silver mountain, I won\u2019t stop you from doing that, Mom. Just don\u2019t use my name.\u201d Xie Qiao curled her lips, smiling coldly.Ms. Lu was a bit shocked to hear that.Pei Wanyue pressed her lips as she was feeling a little unhappy.\u201cSister, don\u2019t blame mom. The truth is\u2026 Among the things that were lost today, there is something Mom wants to give to you. Mom was anxious because of that,\u201d Pei Wanyue said quickly.She was cautious and held her cuff gently with her hand. Her expression was nervous and pitiful.\u201cIs it a gift from Mom or Dad?\u201d Xie Qiao raised her head and gazed at Pei Wanyue with her eyes.Pei Wanyue\u2019s heartbeat was racing.Since the day she first met Xie Qiao, she had never gazed directly into Xie Qiao\u2019s eyes.Although she thought Xiao Qiao was good-looking, it seemed as though her eyes had flown away. Since she was always not paying attention, this had discounted her beauty two out of ten.Now\u2026The gaze of this pair of black eyes were so deep and calm. However, there was not much light in her eyes, making her gaze more fearful to look at.In an instant, Pei Wanyue broke out in a cold sweat.She did not know why she felt as if a cold wind was blowing toward her direction.This scorching weather was not that hot any longer.Ms. Lu was also startled and forgot to speak.\u201cLooks like it\u2019s a gift from Dad.\u201d Xie Qiao lowered her head again, and her sight fell on the road surface. Then she said calmly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to lose it. Mom, you could just ask Dad to replace another one for me.\u201dWhen she finished speaking, Xie Qiao stepped into the nearby inn one step ahead of them.There were only three or five inns in Floating Pavilion Town, and she often came to the inns.As soon as Xie Qiao entered, the waiter in the inn noticed her immediately. Without waiting for her to open her mouth, he said, \u201cMs. Xie! You have come down from the mountain early this month? Do you want something sweet or spicy today? The fish today is very fresh today!\u201d1\u201cThen let\u2019s have fish. Remember to tell Chef Gui that I am going to the imperial city tomorrow morning. He doesn\u2019t have to keep food for me every month anymore,\u201d Xie Qiao said again.\u201cAre you going to the imperial city?\u201d The waiter was taken aback, and then he looked sad. \u201cI will inform the chef about it now.\u201dMs. Lu followed closely and frowned slightly when she saw this scene.\u201cWhy are you talking with this waiter? You\u2019ll lose your status if you do that,\u201d Ms. Lu said.3Xie Qiao chuckled lightly, \u201cWhat status do I have? If you don\u2019t mention it, I\u2019m just a female Taoist going down from the mountain. Besides, the people here are simple-minded. Things are not as complicated as you think, Mom.\u201dAfter a while, the inn manager came here over personally and gave Xie Qiao a jar of wine.The manager gazed at Ms. Lu and her daughter for a moment. He laughed a hollow laugh and walked back.Ms. Lu thought that the people in this town were behaving very weirdly.Especially after Xie Qiao came in, there seemed to be more people watching over them.After a while, the waiter returned and brought some other good stuff, including dried bacon, preserved fruits made out of a secret recipe, and a basket of dried goods.The manager did not say anything but just smiled at Xie Qiao.Xie Qiao did not look up and said her thanks politely. She continued eating her food as if there was nothing out of the ordinary.But after a while, there were waves after waves of townspeople outside. They started bringing her gifts.2Among the gifts were clothes for the summer and autumn, leather outfits for autumn and winter, a sack of dried insects, and many processed bean cakes. There were also a few pieces of jewelry and jade, and two carriages with coachmen?!1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They only walked to Xie Qiao and left her after they had placed the things down.The two pieces of stone sent earlier were even more eye-catching.She had seen it early in the market that morning. This piece of stone was actually priced at 80 taels of silver. It had even been numbered. She wanted to buy it, but now that she had lost her money, she could not.And now it was in this brat\u2019s hands?!Ms. Lu\u2019s heart clenched again. She was so mad she could barely breathe properly.At that moment, a pair walked over, an old woman in her forties and a girl who looked like she was 15 or 16 years old.They made a dash toward Xie Qiao, then they said, \u201cMs. Xie, let us accompany you. \u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s tidy up the things here and move them to the carriage.\u201d Xie Qiao promptly nodded and started to order them around.Ms. Lu was even more shocked. \u201cOne moment.\u201d\u201cIs there anything, Mom?\u201d Xie Qiao\u2019s tone was mild.\u201cThese\u2026 These are all gifts from others. Why are they giving you gifts? Could you have been using your father\u2019s good name to rob the townspeople here?\u201d Ms. Lu spoke her mind.1However else would it be? She was just a 16-year-old brat. How else would she be so well received and garner so many favors?\u201cPfft\u2014\u201d Xie Qiao could not help but accidentally let out a scoff.\u201cThe imperial city is a long way from here, way too far from this place. If my father\u2019s name had traveled all the way here, would you still have been robbed this morning?\u201d Xie Qiao laughed. \u201cThese are just from some small favors that I have done for them in the past. Now that they heard that I\u2019m leaving, they are just sending some things as a token of appreciation.\u201d\u201cXie Qiao, this jade too? If we were to add these two pieces up, it would be worth 160 taels of silver. How could the regular townspeople afford it?\u201d Pei Wanyue asked.\u201cOh, those. Indeed, those are not gifts.\u201d Xie Qiao glanced over the stone. \u201cThe shop owner owes me money, and he doesn\u2019t have the cash to pay me back. Now that I\u2019m rushing off, he\u2019s using these as mortgage.\u201d1\u201cXie Qiao, you are too much. Are you trying to be a loan shark? Creating personal mortgages could land you in court. You have to understand that clearly,\u201d Pei Wanyue blurted out. As soon as she said her piece, she dipped her head down and shot a glance at Ms. Lu.1Ms. Lu\u2019s gaze was burning with rage.Xie Qiao let out a light sigh.\u201cI don\u2019t need to explain all of my actions to you. It would be too much of a hassle.\u201d Xie Qiao frowned.They were going home together today. So she would not want the conflict with her stepmother and her stepsister to continue.Even if she were to explain, they would have other questions coming in waves, one after another. There would be no end to them.\u201cYou\u2026 Do you still consider me as your mother? I\u2019m doing all this out of concern for you!\u201d Ms. Lu raised her voice as she pointed to the stone and said, \u201cYou have lived in the Taoist temple since you were young, and your father never paid any attention to you. Where did you get the money to lend to others?! You will explain this clearly to me. Otherwise, don\u2019t you think of coming back to the imperial city with us. Our family does not have anyone as embarrassing as this.\u201dXie Qiao\u2019s chopsticks halted mid-air.The inn went quiet immediately.Pei Wanyue\u2019s eyes gleamed. All the things that had happened along this journey would definitely make their way to Uncle Xie\u2019s ears. Then when the time came\u2026\u201cThis lady must be Ms. Xie\u2019s stepmother, right?\u201d The counter attendant suddenly walked over. \u201cYou two seem like it. After all, if you were her own mother, then you could\u2019ve just asked her in private. There wouldn\u2019t be a need for such a loud interrogation.\u201dMs. Lu\u2019s face reflected her embarrassment, but she stood her ground. \u201cThis is all for her own good. In fact, she has done wrong this time.\u201d\u201cMadam, what you said earlier didn\u2019t really need Ms. Xie\u2019s explanation. If she had to speak for everything, her opinions would no longer be as precious as gold?\u201d The counter attendant scoffed. \u201cIt is but only two pieces of stones. They are gifts from the Zhang Family Jade shop, right? The son and his mother nearly died a few years ago, but they were saved when they were sent to the Water Moon Temple. Ms. Xie had also sent them two roots of premium ginseng. He didn\u2019t have the money at the time, so they kept a loan tab on it. Everyone knows about this.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The townspeople from Floating Pavilion Town as well as the nearest surrounding towns respected her very much.Her master seldom went down from the mountain, and it was hard to get a chance to meet him.So when people got into trouble, they would seek out the half-immortal.All of them were acquainted with her.They only knew that Half-immortal Xie had an indifferent attitude, did not like to laugh, and was cold-tempered. So in front of her, everyone talked about serious matters and never talked nonsense.She had heard earlier that this Young Lady Xie was born in a lay family, and she had been raised in the Taoist temple because of her poor health.Since she was so beautiful, she must have come from a good family.\u2018Who would have ever thought her stepmother was such a shrew?\u2019The counter attendant looked at Ms. Lu, and his eyes were full of disgust.Ms. Lu\u2019s face was raging hot, and she wanted to open her mouth to ask where did Xie Qiao get the ginseng from.Before she opened her mouth, Pei Wanyue quickly grabbed Ms. Lu, and said to Xie Qiao, \u201cSorry, Sister. My mom didn\u2019t mean it. She was just worried that you have not been educated and would accidentally break the Xie family\u2019s rules. That\u2019s all, now that this is a serious loan repayment, my mom will naturally not say anything!\u201dWater Moon Temple was located in the mountains, so having some good ginseng products was also normal.Many of the Xie family\u2019s servants had accompanied them all along the way. She could not let people think that she and her mom were mistreating Xie Qiao.\u201cAhem.\u201d Xie Qiao clutched her chest and coughed weakly.\u201cAre you the sister of Young Lady Xie?! Why are you talking to her like that? I think you look more like an uneducated person!\u201d When the grandma-granddaughter pair standing next to Xie Qiao saw Xie Qiao\u2019s fragile state, they immediately became worked up.1This woman had lived for so many years, and she could tell that Pei Wanyue\u2019s words did not mean well.\u201cYoung lady, I will help you into the house and get some rest,\u201d the little girl also said quickly.Xie Qiao responded and went straight to the second floor of the inn without looking at Ms. Lu.Xie Qiao had met this grandma and granddaughter pair a few years ago. Both of them had to escape to this town and sell themselves as slaves. At that time, her health was worse off than now. She needed someone to help her to run errands, so she bought back their freedom.It was just that the Taoist temple was a very boring place to be. There was nothing much for them to do, so she let them settle down at the foot of the mountain.People used to call them Granny Wan and Chun Er.Chun Er treated her like a porcelain doll and helped her into the house.1Xie Qiao just thought that her stepmother and stepsister were a little annoying. She just wanted to find some peace and quiet and was not really sick.But Granny Wan downstairs did not think so.She knew that Xie Qiao was a junior, and she was Xie Qiao\u2019s servant. So she could not direct her ire at this woman, so her eyes instead bore holes into Pei Wanyue.While packing up Xie Qiao\u2019s things, she grumbled, \u201cWhy is there such a vicious person in the world?! Can\u2019t you see that my Young Lady is not in good health?! If anything bad happens, even if I have to sacrifice my life for it, I will make you pay!\u201dPei Wanyue\u2019s eyes turned red instantly.\u201cMom\u2026 I-I was just trying to be kind.\u201d Pei Wanyue was trembling with anger.Xie Qiao\u2019s health was not good, so she hid herself when she wanted to!Now, it seemed to the outsiders that she was making Xie Qiao so angry until she could not get out of bed!\u201cHer health was not good? I thought she was fine just now, and she could stay out in the wilderness all night\u2026\u201d Ms. Lu immediately responded against the injustice over her daughter.But when she said this, not only were the counter attendant and Granny Wan unable to put up with it any longer, the other local townspeople could not tolerate it anymore as well.\u201cWe all know that Ms. Xie\u2019s health is not good. How could you not know as her mother?\u201d1\u201cMs. Xie takes medicine from the drugstore every month. They are all tonics. The doctor has said that she may live only for a few more years. How is that all fake?!\u201d\u201cA few years ago, Ms. Xie went down the mountain and fainted on the road. That time, she almost stopped breathing!

Just as they stepped through the door, they heard the angry townspeople demanding justice.\u201cDo you all know this young lady?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing turned to ask someone.\u201cWe do. Her master is the best Taoist master in the region. Ms. Xie\u2019s skills are pretty good too, but it\u2019s a pity that she hasn\u2019t been blessed with a body as strong as her skills!\u201d The person even sighed after saying this.Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s brows furrowed lightly. When he thought back to Ms. Xie, his heart was filled with awe.But did this girl really not have much time left to live?He could not help but feel a sense of discomfort rise in his heart.Zhao Xuanjing did not think too much of it. He only glanced over at the mother and daughter, then went back to his room.There was already someone inside waiting to receive them. When they arrived, he immediately came forward to hand over some information and all the letters from home.Qin Zhi had also received his family\u2019s letters.He opened the letters excitedly to read them.The moment he did, his facial expression changed.His wife went into early labor, and his child was born. It was a girl.\u201cCoincidence\u2026 It must be just a coincidence.\u201d Qin Zhi quickly patted his face as he swallowed dryly. Then he kept the letter calmly.Everything would happen naturally. He had always been fortunate, of course, he would have both sons and daughters!\u201cYour child is born?\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou asked when he saw the delight on his face.\u201cYeah! It\u2019s a girl. My wife says that even though she was born a month early, the doctors said there shouldn\u2019t be any problem. She looks like my mother and is incredibly pretty. She even drew a portrait. It\u2019s just too cute.\u201d As he said this, Qin Zhi even opened up the portrait and showed it to Imperial Bodyguard Zhou.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou\u2019s eye twitched.Tanned as chocolate. There was nothing cute about her.\u201cYes, she is lovely.\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou nodded as he hid his true thoughts. \u201cKeep the talisman well! Carry it with you at all times. Just in case, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.\u201dAs he said this, he shoved the talisman into Qin Zhi\u2019s arms.At first, he was hesitant about giving him this talisman. Now that he knew that Qin Zhi had just had his firstborn daughter, all his hesitation was thrown into the wind.Qin Zhi was as annoyed as a toad. \u201cI don\u2019t want this stuff! Mr. Zhou, you have truly fallen under that woman\u2019s spell. How could you believe her lies?!\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t refuse it even if you try. I will tell the young master otherwise. You already know that even the young master accepted her items. If you scoff at it, it only means that you are mocking the young master behind his back!\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou threatened him.Qin Zhi\u2019s hand halted. He had no choice but to respond to him dejectedly.Now that he had one more useless junk in his hands, he felt particularly uncomfortable.He felt weird all over.All he wanted to do was throw it away.Downstairs, Granny Wan tidied up Xie Qiao\u2019s items. There was still a funny looking package on top of the bamboo basket. Even so, they moved it into the room.Pei Wanyue could not help but catch a few more glimpses of it.There were just so many things.These things might not be worth much, but they represented how well-received Xie Qiao was.If this continued when they returned back to the imperial city, what shall she do then?\u201cMom, what is that package? It sounds like it is clacking. The noise is rather crisp too. It couldn\u2019t be another stone, right?\u201d Pei Wanyue had seen almost all of Xie Qiao\u2019s things.She knew of the bamboo basket; it looked worn and tattered. Its contents had been carried down from the Taoist temple.However, this package was a different matter.It was not from the Taoist temple, neither was it a gift from others.Also, it seemed like this item really mattered to Xie Qiao. When she went upstairs, she even briefed the girl on it.Her voice was low, but judging by the shape of her lips, it seemed like she said something about not allowing anyone else to touch it.What kind of treasure was it that no one else could even touch?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He gazed around with his eyes, and his gloomy face looked terrifying.It was a pity that Pei Wanyue could not see this side of him.Otherwise, she would definitely sense his hostile gaze.After Ms. Lu was reminded by Pei Wanyue, he also glanced at the package.The package was quite large, and it looked like it contained hard objects.As there were so many people watching, she was hesitant to let people open the package, so she just softly said, \u201cSee what kind of weird stuff she got. This girl grew up in the countryside, has a strange temper and uses strange things.\u201dIt was the first time she ever saw people offering worms as gifts.When she looked at that sack of dried insects, she knew it must be food for the huge rooster.Pei Wanyue sighed. When she entered the house with Ms. Lu, she felt a little uncomfortable and asked, \u201cMum, Uncle Xie must be sending her gifts frequently, right?\u201d\u201cSending gifts?\u201d Ms. Lu was stunned, \u201cNo, her father never cares about her. When I first got married to him, I asked him if he wanted to give Xie Qiao some gifts. He said it was unnecessary. But perhaps she was destined not to live a long life,\u00a0 so your Uncle Xie started to worry and care about her. It would be painful for him to see one\u2019s child die earlier than oneself.\u201dSpeaking of this, Ms. Lu sighed, \u201cI wonder why I am mad at her today. Her weak body would not be a threat to you or me.\u201d\u2018Not only has she not received a good education, but she does not have a healthy body.\u2018What could a daughter like her do after returning to the imperial city?\u2019\u201cI only wish that she is well-behaved and sensible now. This is to make sure she does not tarnish our reputation as a Xie family\u2019s daughter. In the future, you could also marry into a good family by relying on the name of Xie\u2019s family,\u201d Ms. Lu added.Pei Wanyue thought so too.But for some reason, after meeting Xie Qiao, especially after seeing her beautiful face, she felt a twinge of envy.\u201cMum, do you know the young man who came in just now? He looked like a high-born with his exquisite features.\u201d Pei Wanyue said again.\u201cHe should be a businessman? There are many merchants in Floating Pavilion Town.\u201d Ms. Lu thought for a while, and then quickly reminded her, \u201cDaughter, no matter how good-looking this man is, it\u2019s useless! A businessman might be rich, but he lacks power. In the eyes of the powerful, the rich are like fat sheep waiting to be slaughtered! Your Uncle Xie was also rich when he was young. But his family ran out of money just to help him to become an official! This was for the sake of future generations having a decent background and belonging in the upper class! The reason why I\u2019m bringing you to the imperial city is not to betroth you to a mere merchant\u2019s house.\u201d\u2018Her daughter excelled in so many areas. Even if she did not marry a nobleman, she should marry a small official, right?\u2019\u201cMom!\u201d Pei Wanyue said awkwardly.Although she was amazed by the handsome young sir she just saw, she thought of the discriminations she had gone through over the years, and that twinge of amazement disappeared into thin air.Pei Wanyue was more interested in the package than the good-looking young sir.After a while, the package was delivered to Xie Qiao\u2019s house.Xie Qiao sent the grandma and granddaughter out.The ghoul stood in front of Xie Qiao in a well-behaved manner, looking very nervous.\u201cWhat kind of auspicious land do you want to be buried in? The afterlife is somewhat related to the life you led before. You were a slave and a servant when you were alive, so the burial place after your death shouldn\u2019t be too good. Too much good luck would be harmful to your children and grandchildren.\u201d Xie Qiao opened the geomantic omen map of the surrounding environment and took a closer look.\u201cI just wonder whether my children could be ordinary good citizens\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This auspicious location would bring luck to your descendants, but if you don\u2019t grasp your own fortune, then it would all be for nought.\u201d Xie Qiao said lightly.\u201cYes, yes, yes! I understand!\u201d The ghoul immediately nodded. \u201cIt all depends on ourselves!\u201dWithout a single hint of luck, no matter how strong someone was, they would still amount to nothing. You could not make bricks without straw, after all.\u201cAs it goes, the mountains and waterways in the region would care for its people. There is no lack of hills or mountains in this area, the state of this region is rather well off too. As long as you do not break any taboos, then there wouldn\u2019t be any major problems within your family. So the key aspect here is the waterways.\u201d Xie Qiao looked up slightly. \u201cWhat do you think of this place?\u201dXie Qiao\u2019s slender finger pointed to an area.The ghoul lifted his head up to see. After staring at it for some time, he still did not understand.He shook his head.\u201cNot to your liking?\u201d Xie Qiao frowned lightly.\u201cNo, no! It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good.\u201d The ghoul was getting nervous.\u201cYou are looking for your own resting place. It has to be somewhere you like.\u201d Xie Qiao mumbled softly. \u201cThere\u2019s a small spring, close by here. The spring water flows out from there and creates a small curvy stream near the land here.\u201d\u201cThere might not be much water here, but it\u2019s enough. This land forms a wavy pattern with the stream. The good fortune generated would be enough for your descendants to have some land. There shouldn\u2019t be any problems for them to prosper for a decade or two. They can also use their name after that too.\u201d Xie Qiao added.\u201cOnly a decade or two?\u201d The ghoul was stunned.\u201cYou are rather greedy too. If someone tends to your grave, then they could prosper for three or five decades. But you do not have any relatives or friends here. This is the best you could get. Your children and grandchildren will get what they can, but the rest is up to them. If they know what they should do, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible to prosper for generations to come. You are just a set of rotten bones. How long more do you plan to care for them?\u201d1The ghoul laughed in embarrassment.When he thought about it, the Grand Immortal was right.He was lucky enough to meet a Grand Immortal. Otherwise, he would still be rotting away in that barren wilderness.Now that he paid attention to this place, he was loving this place more and more by the second.He only hoped that his sons and grandchildren could grab on to this bit of good fortune!Now that the ghoul was content, Xie Qiao felt that her side was not as cold as before.Then Xie Qiao proceeded to ask more about his time of birth and time of death. These would be his Yin and Yang fates.She was in a hurry back to the imperial city, so of course she could not wait for the perfect date to bury him. So she could check if that day or the next had any inauspicious times that would clash with his fates.After some calculation, Xie Qiao set the time for the next morning.When the time comes, the sun would be shining brightly but the Yang energy would not be as strong, so it would not harm his soul. It would be more compatible with his Yin and Yang elements.They could do it that night too, but there was not enough time.Even though everything was minimal, there was still plenty to do.By tomorrow morning they had to dig his grave and also prepare his funeral offerings.After Xie Qiao rested for about two hours, she was ready to move. When she opened the door, she unexpectedly saw that imperial bodyguard whom she had sentenced.\u201cWhat a coincidence. Now that you are here too, how about coming along with me to dig a grave?\u201d Xie Qiao opened her mouth to ask.Qin Zhi was stunned. His face soon stiffened. \u201cMs. Xie, our master still had important matters to tend to. I\u2019m afraid we couldn\u2019t roam about with you.\u201dXie Qiao was stunned.\u201cIn that case, I shall not keep you then.\u201d Xie Qiao did not mind either.There were few who she could trust with things like this.In these ranks, some of them were bursting with luck and Yang energy; they would not be affected as much. But some of them did not have enough Yang energy. Especially this imperial bodyguard before her. He was even tainted with wrath. If this dark energy was not cleared, his condition would only get worse.The only thing was there was no way she was going to spend her time to nag him.Xie Qiao only smiled as she left to prepare.\u201cMother, she went out again. Doesn\u2019t look like she took the package with her. What do you think she is doing outside?\u201d Pei Wanyue\u2019s face was filled with curiosity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I am just her stepmother, so I can\u2019t say much.\u201d\u201cMum, Xie Qiao wouldn\u2019t dare bully you.\u201d Pei Wanyue laughed and snuggled next to Ms. Lu. \u201cAlthough Uncle Xie had married two wives previously, the first one was an ugly bandit woman, and the second wife was a woman from a mountain stronghold. Both wives did not have good family backgrounds. How could they be comparable to you? You are a lady from a good family, and you raised a child for Uncle Xie. The children of the Xie family should be thankful to you.\u201dMs. Lu sighed.These words brought her comfort.\u2018Although she did not give birth to a son or daughter for the Xie family, she had indeed brought up children of his previous wives? !\u2019\u201cNow that I am away from home, and the townspeople are all mistreating me. Everything would be alright again when I return to the imperial city.\u201d Ms. Lu thought for a while and said.\u201cMum, the younger siblings\u2026 Are they close to you?\u201d Pei Wanyue asked.Ms. Lu smiled.\u201cI can\u2019t say for your elder brother. His temper is weird and he doesn\u2019t speak more than pleasantries to me. But, he usually treats me with respect.\u201d Ms. Lu thought for a while and said, \u201cI have two other children and I\u2019ve cared for them for five years. It is natural that they would treat me like their biological mother.\u201dWith that said, Pei Wanyue breathed a sigh of relief.Her mum did not have a biological child. If the children were not close to her, her life could get difficult.Fortunately, there were two young ones to manipulate.\u201cMom, I\u2026 want to see what\u2019s in my sister\u2019s package.\u201d Pei Wanyue muttered.Ms. Lu looked at her in surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s just a jumble of her trinkets. Why are you looking so deeply into it?\u201d Ms. Lu said.\u201cI just think her behavior is a little weird. This package is even heavier than the bamboo box. I don\u2019t know what it is hiding. I think it\u2019s something illegal.\u201d Pei Wanyue said seriously.1The local town was a jade-producing area, and the grade control of jade here was relatively strict.Pei Wanyue\u2019s words were undoubtedly telling Ms. Lu that Xie Qiao\u2019s package might contain that jade material that could not be circulated among ordinary citizens!2Ms. Lu\u2019s heartbeat was racing.\u201cShe\u2019s not that bold, right?\u201d\u00a0 Ms. Lu said in shock.\u201cBut elder sister kept hiding it. Obviously, she just doesn\u2019t want others to see it? If it\u2019s not something illegal, why would she behave in such a way?\u201d Pei Wanyue said puzzlingly, \u201cWhat if you wait for your sister to come back and ask her?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s something illegal, how could she admit it?\u201d Lu Shi was startled and stood frozen for a while.After a while, she held Pei Wanyue\u2019s hand: \u201cYou and I will go and take a look. If it is something illegal, we will deal with it in private. If it is not something illegal, we will pretend that nothing happened.\u201d\u201cWill my elder sister be angry?\u201d Pei Wanyue asked.\u201cIf it is something illegal, even if she\u2019s angry, she still has to be scolded until she returns to her senses. Her father was a bandit for so many years and finally got on the right path. If she drags him down, this wouldn\u2019t be good to everyone in the family.\u201d Ms. Lu said firmly.After finishing her words, she took Pei Wanyue to the next room.The Wans and Chun Er had been sent to buy things by Xie Qiao, and they were not there at the moment.Ms. Lu directly ordered the waiter to open the door.Although the waiter knew Xie Qiao, Ms. Lu was Xie Qiao\u2019s mother. If she wanted to enter her room, the waiter had no reason to stop her.Fortunately, he knew that Xie Qiao had gone shopping, so he quickly found someone to send a message to her.Ms. Xie hated people touching her things without her permission.Pei Wanyue was startled as soon as she entered the room.The furnishings in Xieqiao\u2019s room were better than the room they lived in. It was not that big, but the tents and quilts here looked brand new, and there were fresh pastries on the table!\u201cMum, it\u2019s over there.\u201d Pei Wanyue pointed to the package at the corner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She could not help but shudder.It was the same with Pei Wanyue. She even asked, \u201cXie Qiao, could there be ice stored in this house? It\u2019s a lot colder than our house. What\u2019s wrong with these waiting staff? We paid for the room all the same but how could he give us such unfair treatment.\u201d\u201cIf you feel that it\u2019s hot, then call the waiting staff back to put some ice in our place too.\u201d Ms. Lu was very generous.\u201cYou spoil me, Mother.\u201d Pei Wanyue smiled cheekily.The ghoul was bursting with rage.Dark dull eyes stared straight at these two persons as cold air oozed from his form.His head had stretched all the way into Pei Wanyue\u2019s neck. How he wanted to chomp that neck into half.It was too bad, Pei Wanyue noticed nothing.She squatted down and then she slowly opened the package, bit by bit.A corner of the cloth was flipped open.And another corner followed\u2026\u201cAh\u2014\u201dA voice rang out, almost shattering her ears.Pei Wanyue fell backward as she stumbled back. In an instant, a sheen of cold sweat dripped off her in showers. Her trembling hand pointed towards the bare white bone. She could not stop shaking. \u201cB\u2026b\u2026bones.\u201dIt was a complete set of human bones. From the skull to the toes, each inch and every piece was perfectly intact.It was creepy and chilling, especially the two eye cavities in the skull. They still had some soil in them. For some reason, it seemed scarier than usual.Pei Wanyue was close to passing out, her whole body was as cold as ice.The ghoul had two hands clenched around her neck.She only felt her heart was about to beat out of her chest. She was so scared that she could barely breathe.Ms. Lu was also frozen in place from fear.\u201cD\u2026 Dead\u2026 Someone is dead!\u201d Pei Wanyue broke down shouting even before her earlier screams died out.Ms. Lu heard and immediately ran up to cover her daughter\u2019s mouth. But it was too late.With a skeleton like that, how could it have died recently?But as she thought so, Ms. Lu suddenly had an idea. Unless\u2026This was Xie Qiao\u2019s murder victim from the past, and now she wants to bring it back to the imperial city?But that did not make sense\u20261The audacity to keep a dead man\u2019s skeleton in the house. What kind of proper lady would do a thing like this!?It was already too late, Ms. Lu could only help console her daughter.The people in the inn rushed up.When Imperial Bodyguard Zhou received the order, he too brought a few men to surround the area. Then he came in asking, \u201cWho shouted here? What happened?\u201dPei Wanyue\u2019s bean-size tears could not stop rolling down, splashing on the floor. She said sobbing, \u201cM\u2026 M\u2026 My sister\u2019s package has a body in it\u2026\u201dImperial Bodyguard Zhou looked toward it.Erm\u2026He was dumbfounded.\u201cYour sister is Ms. Xie, right?\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou was very calm. After all, it was not the first time he ever saw a skeleton.The ghoul\u2019s eyes were flashing blood-red from fury.Bouts of cold air blew through the area.\u201cIt\u2026 It\u2019s Xie Qiao\u2026 She\u2026 Did she kill somebody\u2026 It\u2019s scary. It\u2019s really scary!\u201d Pei Wanyue stammered as she buried her head into Ms. Lu\u2019s embrace.Imperial bodyguard Zhou rubbed his head. \u201cThis\u2026 She didn\u2019t kill him. It was just an unnamed body by the roadside. Ms. Xie brought it back so that she could find a suitable place to bury it properly.\u201dThey had seen Xie Qiao dig up the body with their own eyes yesterday.\u201cUn\u2026 unnamed body?\u201d Pei Wanyue was stunned, tears still staining her face.She was a rather pitiful sight.But Imperial Bodyguard Zhou felt that this frail look was nothing compared to Half-immortal Xie.That Half-immortal Xie did not shed a single tear, neither did she grumble. But when she dipped her head slightly, producing that weary, poignant look could make anyone\u2019s heart melt.The key thing was, even if Half-immortal Xie looked weak, she still gave off an air of intimidation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Your sister is accumulating good karma. It won\u2019t be long before she gets the corpse buried.\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou comforted her.Pei Wanyue\u2019s chin was trembling, \u201cGet it buried? But my elder sister didn\u2019t even know him?\u201d\u201cThis is precisely the case. Because they don\u2019t know each other, she couldn\u2019t bear to see his corpse buried in the wilderness. Ms. Xie seems to know some feng shui techniques and wants to move it to a better place.\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou said again.Pei Wanyue could not help but hold her breath.\u2018She carried a corpse of a person she doesn\u2019t know by her side?!\u2018It was such a dirty and terrible thing\u2026\u2019Pei Wanyue\u2019s eyelids twitched, and she was so angry that she could not speak for a while.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou smiled and began to evacuate the crowd. At this time, Pei Wanyue suddenly said, \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate for my sister to do this.\u201dImperial Bodyguard Zhou looked back at her.\u201cSince it is a corpse in the wilderness, it should be handed over to the administrative office.\u201d Pei Wanyue\u2019s face went pale. \u201cThis person also has relatives. You should let the administrative office check his identity, find his family, and take his corpse back.\u201dImperial Guard Zhou was a little surprised.\u2018Yes indeed, this is the normal standard procedure.\u2019\u2018It is just that if he follows the standard procedure, it will be impossible to find the family members for this corpse in a short period of time. If this wild corpse has no other characteristics, it will most probably end up in a crematorium.\u2019\u2018Although the crematorium charity will take in the corpse, it cannot be left there for too long. After a long time, no one will claim it. In the end, it will be buried harshly or\u2026\u2018Be thrown into the mass grave.\u2018It would be good if Half-immortal Xie wants to help bury this corpse.\u2019\u2018But if this girl wants to help find relatives for the corpse, it would be even a better idea.With his Young Master identity, it would not be good for him to ignore this matter.\u201cThis person has been dead for at least half a year. The possibility of finding a relative is very slim. Your elder sister found his corpse. Why don\u2019t you wait for her to come back? Even if you want to report about it to the official, your elder sister has to come forward and provide some important clues.\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou said with a smile.Pei Wanyue nodded, and she then pursed her lips in a somewhat embarrassed manner.After a while, she said in a tangled voice, \u201cBut\u2026I\u2019m afraid that my elder sister is not willing to hand over the corpse.\u201d\u201cI know. This is a human corpse, and it\u2019s not some kind of treasure. Logically, there must be a reason why your elder sister would hide and deal with it in a different way, but\u2026 Your elder sister should have thought of reporting to the official, but she did not. She must have her own reasons, so\u2026 \u201dImperial Bodyguard Zhou was captivated hearing that.\u2018Does that mean that there was a secret between Half-immortal Xie and the corpse, so she chose not to report it to the official?\u2019Imperial Bodyguard Zhou suddenly had a headache.\u2018This person\u2026 Is she really Half-immortal Xie\u2019s biological sister? Does she really hate her?\u2019\u201cLet\u2019s wait until your elder sister comes back.\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou insisted.\u201cThis young sir is not an official, and it\u2019s not up to you to decide right?\u201d Pei Wanyue said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s not good to let the administrative office think that we deliberately hid a corpse, so\u2026\u201dPei Wanyue finished speaking, looked at the crowd, and said, \u201cAre there any strong men who are willing to help run the errands and inform an official to come?\u201d\u2018It is impossible that everyone in the inn are Xie Qiao\u2019s acquaintances?\u2019Pei Wanyue also had alluring features but she was frightened just now. At this moment, she tried hard to be awe-inspiring, which made many people on the spot admire her.\u201cI\u2019m going!\u201d Someone volunteered himself.Pei Wanyue thanked the person and he immediately ran out of the inn.Imperial Guard Zhou and his other men were left dazed and confused.Suddenly they realized that they were being looked down upon!\u2018This young lady must have thought they were ordinary guests because they had not revealed their identity!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If that person were to rush on a whipped horse, two hours would suffice for a round trip.And Ms. Xie was found this time.When she entered the door, she was greeted with the sight of busy officials and\u2026 bones on the floor. Xie Qiao\u2019s face immediately darkened.Pursing her lips while staring at the bones, it looked like strangers were not welcome there.The few nearby who knew Xie Qiao did not even dare to breathe out loud.\u201cXie Qiao, why are you hiding a human skeleton? It\u2019s really scary!\u201d Pei Wanyue rushed over like she was going to pounce into her arms.Xie Qiao dodged, leaving Pei Wanyue falling into an empty embrace.\u201cWe are not close.\u201d Xie Qiao mumbled. \u201cYou touched my things?\u201d\u201cXie Qiao\u2026 Mother and I don\u2019t do it on purpose. We just thought that the things in there could be illegal. So we wanted to see, just to be sure. But we didn\u2019t expect that\u2026 Xie Qiao, I know you picked this skeleton corpse by the roadside. All you have to do is to explain to the officials. No matter what you say, we will still believe in you!\u201d Pei Wanyue quickly said.Xie Qiao let out a cold laugh.\u201cYou dare to touch anything. I\u2019ve got to say that I\u2019m almost impressed by your courage.\u201d Xie Qiao\u2019s eyebrows slightly raised.\u201cThis thing\u2026 Really scared me\u2026\u201d Pei Wanyue\u2019s eyes were still red.She was truly terrified.\u201cWere you hiding this? Follow us for the administrative office!\u201d The officer was direct.\u201cI am afraid not.\u201d Xie Qiao walked straight into the house. Then she sat down.\u201cXie Qiao!? It\u2019s not like they want you to confess your crime. All they want is for you to tell them the origins of these bones.\u201d Pei Wanyue hastily said.Ms. Lu frowned. She felt that something was amiss somewhere.Her daughter was being too reckless today.They were going to be a family from then onwards. Now that things were spiraling out of control, her reputation will affect the entire family. It would not look good for anyone at this rate.The only saving grace was that Xie Qiao has been raised away from the family this whole time.\u201cXie Qiao, listen to me. Go to the administrative office, tell them everything, then you can leave.\u201d Ms. Lu said too.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to say?\u201d Xie Qiao\u2019s face was as hard as steel. \u201cDon\u2019t they just want to know the corpse\u2019s identity and cause for death? I know that very well, so why do I need to go to the administrative office?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 The man from just now said that this was a nameless corpse.\u201d Pei Wanyue said.\u201cHe was unnamed yesterday, but I suddenly remembered today. Wouldn\u2019t that do?\u201d Xie Qiao said coolly.\u201cXie Qiao, quit fooling around!\u201d Ms. Lu was angry.Xie Qiao did not want to argue with the officials, and said directly, \u201cThis body\u2019s surname was Lu, his full name was Lu Quanlin. Age\u2026 38. Half a year ago, he traveled with his master. Along the way, they were robbed and murdered. He left behind three sons, his wife, and his father. His relatives are all in the imperial city.\u201d\u201cA robbery case from half a year ago?\u201d The official frowned when he heard this.\u201cThat\u2019s right. There were quite a few victims who died back then. You would know if you check. There\u2019s also a servant who is still missing until now.\u201d Xie Qiao added.The official nodded.\u201cIndeed, there was a case like this. The victim was patrol officer Master Lu.\u201d The official quickly said.This case had shocked the nation back then. Master Lu\u2019s murderer was never found.In the end, the investigator caught wind of some information and led to the arrest of the county magistrate.Rumors had it that the county magistrate hired bandits to do it. Then only did this case come to a close.However, they were government officials, of course, they knew that someone was missing from Sir Lu\u2019s escort.Sir Lu was out in disguise at the time. According to passerby accounts, there were three other people by his side. They should be two bodyguards and a girl as a coverup.At the crime scene, they found only Sir Lu and two others.There was still one left.

And why didn\u2019t you report it sooner?!\u201d The officer asked in a serious tone.Xie Qiao calmly said, \u201cMore than half a year ago, I ran into them when I went down to the mountain. I was not in good health. Thanks to their help, I did not faint in the wilderness. Later, I heard that Master Lu was dead. It was said that the body of that one person had not been found, and some even said that he had become a fugitive slave. I didn\u2019t believe it, so I searched it myself.\u201d\u201cAs I went down the mountain this time, I passed by the spot, and found that the soil was soft and the weeds were growing more luxuriantly than the other areas. I wanted to find out why, but I didn\u2019t expect to excavate his body.\u201d Xie Qiao said in an unhurried manner.\u201cThis person had become like this. How do you know that it is the body of that servant?\u201d Pei Wanyue asked.Many people followed her and nodded.\u2018It is just a set of bones left, and I can\u2019t see what he actually looks like as a person. How could you know this is him?\u201cThis was because he had a token on his body. He had saved me once before. I thanked him and gave him this little bronze mirror, hoping to help him to avoid misfortunes. But I didn\u2019t expect the power of this bronze mirror to be so insignificant and unable to prevent this misfortune from befalling him.\u201d Xie Qiao opened her mouth and gave some excuses.With that said, she also took out a bronze mirror.The bronze mirror was just the size of a palm, and it was dark and dirty. It looked like it had been in the soil for a long time.Xie Qiao had many mirrors like this.Usually, they were given as gifts to others.\u201cHow could it be dug so coincidentally\u2026\u201d Pei Wanyue sensed that something was wrong.\u2018Although these words sound reasonable, how could there be such a coincidence in the world?\u2019Xie Qiao looked at her with a smile.\u201cI\u2026 What did I say wrong?\u201d Pei Wanyue looked cautious.\u201cIt\u2019s just a coincidence. If Ms. Pei finds this to be dubious, you could go down to the spirit realm and ask him directly. Why was he buried under my feet and discovered by me?\u201d Xie Qiao said sarcastically.Pei Wanyue showed an expression as if she had been wronged.After Xie Qiao finished speaking, she poured herself a glass of water and drank slowly.Suddenly she chuckled again, \u201cYou officers must be tired making this trip. After returning, just tell the county magistrate and said that it was just a matter of the Water Moon Temple and he will understand.\u201d\u201cWater Moon Temple?\u201d The officer was startled when he heard her words.Then he looked at Xie Qiao with a surprise on his face, \u201cAre you the great disciple of Mo Lingzi from Water Moon Temple, that Half-immortal Xie?!\u201dXie Qiao nodded slightly.\u201cSince this is Half-immortal Xie, then it won\u2019t be any problem at all. I was speaking so crudely to you, and offended you. I don\u2019t know\u2026whether I\u2019ve committed any taboo?\u201d The attitude of this official changed very quickly.When these words came out, Pei Wanyue was stunned.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. The biggest taboo has already been triggered by someone else, and your problem is not big.\u201d Xie Qiao said slowly.As soon as he said this, the official sighed.They have heard of the Water Moon Temple a long time ago!In the temple, the real Master, Mo Lingzi had been accurate in all his fortune-reading all the while. The real Master had only one apprentice and she was addressed as Half-immortal Xie after demonstrating some potent gifts.Now the county magistrate had only been in office for a few months. When he first took office, he did not know what kind of misfortune he had gotten himself into. His old mother was seriously ill and bed-ridden. Her illness did not get better until she was carried to the Water Moon Temple in person. Her condition had improved ever since. Now the old lady was healthy and could possibly live for another twenty years!It was not the first instance of this great disciple of Water Moon Temple exhuming corpses.Before that, she did fortune-reading to help search for missing people for the authorities several times. These attempts had all been very accurate.It was a pity that this master and disciple pair seldom come down from the mountain. Every time the county magistrate had to go to Water Moon Temple to meet them in person. So they had only heard of their name but never seen them in person before.\u2018Looking at the great disciple\u2019s sagely-like and otherworldly features, this was exactly as described by the county magistrate!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ms. Xie has already provided the victim\u2019s identity, so we would proceed to contact his family. When the time arrives, someone will come to see to the bones. But these are just bones\u2026 there\u2019s no guarantee that they would recognize him\u2026 It\u2019s a good thing the Water Moon Temple has an excellent reputation outside of the region. We could give the victim\u2019s family an explanation now.\u201dThe reason why they trusted the Water Moon Temple was not because they were disciples of deities.But it was because they often helped the authorities.The reason why Half-immortal Xie could find the bones were probably not because she coincidentally passed by, but because she had calculated it beforehand. Similar things had happened in the past.Besides\u2026A skeleton like this did not have a single sign or mark on it. If Ms. Xie said nothing, then no matter how much the police investigated, they would never find out who it was. The worst thing that could happen was that there would be one more lost ghoul wandering around in the world.The officials seemed like they had absolute faith in Xie Qiao.Pei Wanyue did not even know what to say.She could only force a smile. \u201cThen that\u2019s great. I was originally worried about Xie Qiao\u2026 Now I can finally rest easy! Where do you plan to bury this person, Xie Qiao?\u201dXie Qiao was perplexed. Neither did she give a direct answer to Pei Wanyue\u2019s question.Instead, she looked at the bones on the floor and asked, \u201cMother, who opened my package?\u201dMs. Lu\u2019s expression stiffened. It was rather awkward. \u201cIs this important?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s important. Whoever opened it should pack it back up.\u201d Xie Qiao said matter-of-factly.Just as she said this, Pei Wanyue\u2019s heart jumped. \u201cMother, I don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201dThose were human bones!No way she was going to touch them!\u201cSince you dug them out, why can\u2019t you pack them back again? Wanyue is still so young, she had never seen anything like this. How would she handle this?\u201d Ms. Lu quickly said. \u201cYou brat, just treat it like a favor for your sister. I will be thankful to you too!\u201dXie Qiao lightly smiled when she heard this.\u201cWhich part of Ms. Pei is my sister? Is it through our familiar blood ties or is it through our ancestral heritage? If it\u2019s neither, then we\u2019ll need to be clear. She has to do what she must do. If you can\u2019t bear to let her handle it, then you could take over instead, Mother. I\u2019m not picky.\u201d Xie Qiao said lightly.Take over?Ms. Lu did not even dare glance at that body.\u201cXie Qiao, you are capable. I can\u2019t do it. Please help me out, alright?\u201d Pei Wanyue spoke adorably. She immediately faltered as she watched Xie Qiao wistfully.Xie Qiao smiled slightly. \u201cNo can do, Ms. Pei.\u201dPei Wanyue\u2019s awkward smile was plastered on her face.At that moment, she did not know what to do. Her eyes were red, sobs interrupted every word from her mouth. She was a pitiful sight.\u201cThe items are yours and you are the older sister. It doesn\u2019t even cost you to tidy it a bit\u2026\u201d In the crowd, the man who ran to summon the officials called out.The moment he said this, a few dozen people actually nodded in agreement.2Xie Qiao had brought over the body and she had left it in her house.

Yesterday I was exposed to the wind, and I still feel dizzy today. When I went out to buy medicine, this person was\u2026 offended by Ms. Pei\u2026 I thought that if I was the dead one and suffered such an aggrievance, I would definitely want the person who wronged me to apologize to me.\u201d\u201cMs. Pei, you are such a kind-hearted girl. You only need to express your mistakes by sincerely cleaning up the bones for him. I believe he will not be petty with you. Also, you wish to do good things, right?

If you really broke a taboo, it\u2019s time to fix it now.\u201d\u201cMs. Xie\u2019s master is a highly-accomplished sage from Water Moon Temple. There must be a reason for her asking her sister to do this. She won\u2019t mean her sister harm, right?\u201d\u201cMs. Pei, the bones aren\u2019t that difficult to rearrange. Your older sister can dig it out by herself. You can certainly do what she did, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\u201dAlmost all who spoke out this time were followers of Water Moon Temple.When they opened their mouths, Pei Wanyue fell so gloomy that she almost fainted.\u2018Did I do all this to do something that can only barely match up to Xie Qiao?\u2019Xie Qiao\u2019s face only made Pei Wanyue even angrier.\u2018She looks so fragile and pitiful. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m the one bullying her!\u2019Xie Qiao looked prettier than her and had a more impoverished background than her. No matter what, Xie Qiao was better than her!\u2018How would outsiders know Xie Qiao had such little substance? She may be illiterate, but she gained so much popularity just because of her attractive face!\u2019Pei Wanyue felt horrible. \u2018Why would an ugly woman like Ms. Peng give birth to such a beautiful daughter?!\u2019When she thought about being suppressed further by Xie Qiao upon their return to the imperial city, she felt miserable.1\u2018But there is an elephant in the room to be addressed right now.\u2018How do I say no\u2026?\u2019Pei Wanyue\u2019s emotions bubbled in her. When she saw that tears did not work, she decided to act as if she was about to faint\u2014\u201cCough! Cough!\u201d Xie Qiao suddenly clutched her chest and coughed rapidly, as if she was about to no longer be able to keep standing. She grabbed Pei Wanyue\u2019s wrist. \u201cM-Ms. Pei, hurry up, I\u2019m not in good health. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to faint soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Pei Wanyue felt as if someone had stabbed her in the heart.She turned her head and stared at Xie Qiao carefully.She suspected that she was doing this deliberately.\u2018How could this be so coincidental? When I\u2019m about to faint, she grabbed my wrist and said something like this?!\u2019But right now, Xie Qiao\u2019s face had turned pale, and she was leaning weakly against the desk. She looked a little too convincing.Pei Wanyue was caught in a dilemma.Everyone was staring at her.Even Ms. Lu was taken aback by Xie Qiao\u2019s appearance. \u201cHurry up and pack it up. Your sister looks really sick. If something goes wrong\u2026\u201d\u2018If Xie Qiao loses her reputation, it is not my fault. However, if her body gets hurt or she loses her life on the road, how do I explain myself when I return home? !\u2019When Pei Wanyue heard what her mother said, she was angry and sad.But she could not do anything about it at all.Everyone was staring at her as if she had just committed a major crime!Xie Qiao who apparently did not seem well seemed as if she could not close her eyes without watching her pack the bones. She made everyone gaze at her as if they were urging her to hurry up!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She looked like an old lady who had lost all her teeth.Some people could not stand this. But Xie Qiao clutched her chest as she said, \u201cMs. Pei, you must\u2019ve taken a good look when you opened it. You just have to do it with the courage you had when you opened it. I have faith in you, Ms. Pei! I believe that you are the kindest. How could you not accomplish something as trivial as this? Cough!\u201dPei Wanyue was fuming with rage.She dawdled and took her sweet time before she finally put the package back into place after much trouble.The onlookers outside were almost gone.After Pei Wanyue finished, she went back to her room and cried in rage.In Xie Qiao\u2019s house, only Imperial Bodyguard Zhou and his group were left.Xie Qiao let out a small sigh and stood up. \u201cIs there anything your group wants to ask?\u201d\u201cThese bones\u2026 Do they really belong to Master Lu\u2019s servant?\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou asked her directly.Xie Qiao pursed her lips lightly and replied, \u201cYes.\u201dImperial Bodyguard Zhou was surprised and shocked. \u201cI thought you used it as an excuse to get rid of trouble. I never would\u2019ve thought it was true\u2026 Ms. Xie, may I request for you to meet our young master?\u201dSome words were not suitable to be asked in situations like these. Neither were they for the ears of the public. That included the imperial bodyguards by the young master\u2019s side.That young master did not seem to be a commoner. He had to be of royal descent.Even if he was not, he should be related to royalty.There was nothing in Floating Pavilion Town that was worth the royal family\u2019s attention. If any, it would be the jades here.There was also that huge incident from more than half a year ago.That huge incident was related to jades too, so\u2026It did not take much guessing to know this young master was here to investigate something that had been left out half a year ago.So in the beginning, Xie Qiao did not say anything about the dead body\u2019s identity because she was afraid of attracting trouble. She had not expected Pei Wanyue to behave this way, leaving her with no choice but to escalate it.Xie Qiao nodded.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou was elated. He quickly invited her over.This honorable guest was in the best rooms of the inn at that very moment.Zhao Xuanjing did not expect to be seeing this Ms. Xie so many times within such a short time frame.\u201cHave a seat, Ms. Xie.\u201d Zhao Xuanjing was also worried that Ms. Xie\u2019s body would wane again.\u201cWhat do you want to ask?\u201d Xie Qiao was very straightforward. She looked as confident as ever.\u201cMs. Xie, your calculations have been spot on to the point of finding Lu Quanlin\u2019s body. I wonder if I could ask you for a favor?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing said.He seemed to be rather knowledgeable of how things worked in the field. As a matter of fact, he was exceptionally generous. This time, he took out silver pieces worth 20 taels each. There were 10 pieces in total.\u201cAre you looking for something?\u201d Xie Qiao asked.\u201cIndeed. You are excellent, Miss.\u201d Zhao Xuanjing went against his heart and gave her some empty praises.\u201cIt\u2019s not so easily done.\u201d Xie Qiao shook her head.Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s heart clenched. \u201cYou mean\u2026 this thing\u2026 cannot be found?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to find, it\u2019s just that this thing\u2026 is ferocious. Nothing good comes from seeking it. If you get tangled in a great deal of\u00a0 trouble because of this, would you regret it?\u201d Xie Qiao spoke slowly.Zhao Xuanjing did not fully trust her at first. It had even passed his mind that the matter from earlier was just a coincidence.But now that he heard her, his heart was absolutely astounded.\u201cMs. Xie, to tell you the truth. The thing that I\u2019m searching for\u2026\u201d\u201cHold up,\u201d Xie Qiao suddenly spoke. She did not know if she should cry or laugh. \u201cI do not want to know what sort of things are connected to it. The more you know, the more troublesome it gets.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could people not target all this silver?\u2019The previous county magistrate was the true murderer of Master Lu.\u2018But she could not believe a county magistrate had such courage and the patrol officers to execute it.\u2018With regards to that, she could not tell how many people were involved!\u2018All those involved would be capable of doing just about anything to save their own hides.\u2019Zhao Xuanjing was still a little unaccustomed to being rejected. He shook his head slightly.Soon he calmed down, and he put a smile on his handsome face, \u201cThank you Your Lady for your guidance, but this item is very important to me. I hope Young Lady could help clear my doubts.\u201dXie Qiao rubbed her brow.\u2018Are you being childish and immature?\u2019\u2018That noble appearance is wasted on him. He does not know how to cherish it but insists to have this evil item. This may cause him to die young.\u2019\u201cAll right then.\u201d Xie Qiao stuffed the silver money, one by one, into her pockets.Dying young was none of her business.After stuffing all the silver money into her pocket, Xie Qiao began working.She asked Zhao Xuanjing to find a piece of paper.\u201cKindly write something.\u201d Xie Qiao said.\u201cDetect?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing thought this was interesting. \u201cCould writing \u2018Detect\u2019 show us the location of things?\u201dHowever, he obliged and picked up the calligraphy brush. After hesitating for a while, he slightly moved his calligraphy brush on the paper. His head was empty. After two more breaths, he wrote the word \u201cJade\u201d.\u201cWriting in hesitation and a disturbed manner is a clear sign that this would provoke disputes. Young Master, I noticed that you had a smooth start?\u201d Xie Qiao frowned slightly.After she finished speaking, she looked at the sky outside the window, and then calculated the hexagram.\u201cA little dot means that earth lingers in the air and would soon turn to dust. The three straight lines are connected to the name of water. The single vertical line means cold wood, while the short horizontal line in the middle means there\u2019s gold in the bag. The stroke beside the dot means flame.\u201d Xie Qiao murmured, \u201cThe five elements have been identified, and your query is solvable.\u201dLater, she took out the tortoiseshell and copper coins and fiddled with them.\u201cWhen the fire element is hidden in the wood element, this is a sign of energy. When these two elements are in harmony with the gold element, you will soon find this item.\u201dZhao Xuanjing could not understand what Xie Qiao said.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou could not understand either.Two of them were confused.\u201cYoung Lady Xie, could you make it clearer?\u201d\u201cThis fire element represents the item you wish to find. The wood element leads to the position of the item. If we can make a connection between these two elements, it proves that this item can be found. When you write the word \u201cDetect\u201d, the five elements were all present and it was considered a good fit. This item is hidden at a position of the gold element. It points to the west and slightly to the south.\u201d\u201cSouthwest?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing frowned, \u201cThis is all too vague. It won\u2019t be easy to find the item.\u201d\u201cThe word written by the young master can be calculated on a hexagram, based on the provided time, event, font and the proportion of the five elements. Finally, the hexagram revealed that wealth is being exchanged. This item must be hidden in the ruins of a rubble wall.\u201dXie Qiao did not wish to write down all her calculation steps one by one.The \u2018Detect\u2019 word might look simple, but its horizontal and vertical strokes were not the sole reason that was taken into consideration.For example, the time when \u2018Detect\u2019 word was written, the attributes and directions represented by each stroke, and elements that were contradictory or complementary to each other.If it was just a simple \u2018Detect\u2019 word. She could calculate some hexagrams, but all of the results might be very general.\u201cIn the ruins of a rubble wall in the southwest direction?\u201d Zhou Shiwei concluded.\u201cThat\u2019s where the signs all point.\u201d Xie Qiao thought for a while, and said, \u201cI remember there being a deserted old village in the southwest. This village is relatively close to the mines, so the people there have moved away. The village had been left deserted for a long time. Maybe\u2026you can go there to find it.\u201dAfter taking the silver, Xie Qiao could utter whatever she thought of.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then I shall wait till the ceremony for the corpse is over. After that, we shall begin our search.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Xie Qiao nodded. \u201cThen you should buy some funeral offerings. He\u2019ll like that. \u201dWho does not like money? The living loves fortune, so do the dead!Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s eyes twitched. \u201cHe?\u201d\u201cUnless you\u2026 can sense ghouls?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing suddenly felt a chill run up his back.\u201cWhy are you trying to freak people out\u2026 I am\u2026 afraid\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 cough, cough.\u201d Xie Qiao frowned.The men around Zhao Xuanjing let out a sigh in relief.That meant she could see nothing.But precisely at that moment, Xie Qiao tilted her head and shot a glance to a corner with no one in it. That gaze did not seem vacant.The group froze up. Cold air whooshed up around them.\u201cRemind me when we are leaving.\u201d Xie Qiao called out. Then, she stood up and took her leave.Zhao Xuanjing face was muddled with concern. But his face was calm as he stood tall and dignified as ever.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou could not bear it any longer. His eyelid was twitching in warning. \u201cYoung Master.\u201d\u201cA good anvil does not fear the hammer.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to fear if you have done no wrong.\u201dZhao Xuanjing was calm as he left with those two phrases.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou promptly nodded. \u201cYou are right, master. I have overstepped my bounds.\u201dThe young master really was worthy of his title. Intangible things do not matter to him. Even if there were really ghosts, the young master would still stand his ground. He would always be there. He would most definitely never stoop down to these brats\u2019 level and fidget around.Before the sun rose up the next day, Xie Qiao headed out.When they reached that auspicious location, Xie Qiao prepared the offerings. Then she started to mumble.The burial ceremony did not need to be too complicated. Xie Qiao needed to pray in five directions and request for the deities to clear the path for them as to not offend the higher powers. She prayed that he was bathed in glory after death and that his family prospered and that evil remained far from them and fortune found them. After the prayers and the digging of the ground, they let the coffin down into the ground with no problems or other dangers.Actually, there were many rules regarding burials.Xie Qiao had removed many steps from the ritual.After praying in five directions, she simply set the direction on the compass. Then she dug up soil, covered up the coffin, nailed it shut, and set it downEach step had an accompanying rhyme of its own. Xie Qiao was in charge of chanting them out.Zhao Xuanjing and the rest only felt that Xie Qiao was mumbling nonsense.However, what they did not see was the ghoul next to them seemingly enjoying this. The air around his form had also cleared up a bit unlike the dark gloom from before.\u201cYoung Master, Ms. Xie\u2019s health seems to be in good health? Take a look at her face, it\u2019s fair and rosy.\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou could not help but grumble.Zhao Xuanjing cocked his eyebrow.She looked good, but she could collapse at any given moment.\u201cExcept you, everyone has to shovel some soil on the burial.\u201d Xie Qiao squinted at Zhao Xuanjing.\u201cWhy am I exempted?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing asked.\u201cYour status is not suitable.\u201d Xie Qiao said, \u201cHe can\u2019t handle it if you did. \u201dZhao Xuanjing immediately stopped talking.Now he was wondering if the girl had figured out his identity.But if she did know, her attitude was a bit too relaxed. Though she was respectful, it carried no sincerity. It did not seem like she treated him any differently.With little hassle, they finished the ceremony.Finally, Zhao Xuanjing and his company were ready to leave. They seemed to leave with some reluctance.\u201cMs. Xie, do you have anything to say?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing asked.If only this maiden could follow him on his journey.\u201cNothing. There really is nothing else left. No lies this time.\u201d Xie Qiao shook her head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In exchange, she had only given him a few general pieces of advice.Some words were too mysterious to be understood, but the few he could comprehend, he committed to memory.\u201cMs. Xie, your advice is really expensive.\u201d Zhao Xuanjing smiled, despite looking a little stiff.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this amount of silver. Young Master is not willing to part with it?\u201d Xie Qiao was as calm as ever, having nothing to lose. \u201cThe silver I received from you isn\u2019t much. Those who could afford it wouldn\u2019t feel a thing. Plus, you offered me this amount of your own choosing without me asking.\u201dZhao Xuanjing agreed.He had offered that amount of money willingly.\u2018This was the first time I did this.\u2018So I can\u2019t say she is greedy for my money.\u2019\u201cThanks, Young Lady. I hope to see you again in the future.\u201d Zhao Xuanjing felt that it was late now and he did not wish to chat further.\u201cHmm, I\u2019ll definitely see you again.\u201d Xie Qiao nodded.\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhao Xuanjing looked askance at her, and deliberately pretended to be stupid, \u201cYou are about to leave for the imperial city soon. You\u2019re a businesswoman, but you haven\u2019t been to the imperial city before?\u201dXie Qiao laughed.\u201cThe way Young Master speaks is as if he were addressing a First Young Lady standing among a group of men. Everyone is proclaiming her to be their true love, yet you know it\u2019s just a lie.\u201d Xie Qiao rubbed her toes on the ground twice and spoke gently, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, Young Master, even if I meet you in the Imperial City, I would pretend not to know you.\u201d2Xie Qiao\u2019s words were too straightforward, and it cracked at Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s cool indifference.He was a bit sensitive in his identity. If this case was solved, it would be difficult to tell others that he had relied on fortune-telling.It was not that the fortune-telling was bad, nor was he guilty about it.Someone would use this to accuse him of not doing his job properly. That would only invite him more trouble.\u201cThen, I thank you, Young Lady,\u201d Zhao Xuanjing responded earnestly.This Young Lady was so intelligent that it had thrown him off.\u201cI should be the one thanking you. After all, I am an unmarried lady from a respectable family!\u201d Xie Qiao\u2019s tone was relaxed, a little prideful, even.\u2018As an unmarried Young Lady, how could I perform fortune-telling everywhere, and even get acquainted with a man?\u2018So pretending not to know each other is the best!\u2019Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s eyelids twitched, but he saw that Xiao Qiao was really serious about this.After a while, Xie Qiao packed up her stuff and got into a waiting carriage.Xie Qiao walked away euphorically without turning her head back. She did not spare the group of people accompanying her a single glance. The huge rooster at her side had her full attention. She gave it more care than anyone else, including the Young Master.Zhao Xuanjing could not see anything amiss, but something felt odd.\u201cYoung Master, is Ms. Xie really a noble and proud person?\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou could not help but sigh.\u201cHow would you know? She seemed to be money-minded.\u201dNo matter how stubborn she appeared to be, she immediately changed her behavior when she saw silver.Her facial expression changed faster than the flipping of a page.\u201cWith so many people accompanying you, everyone could tell that you came from an unusual background. However, this girl wouldn\u2019t look at you any differently. She could quite possibly be a noble and proud person.\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou spoke solemnly.Zhao Xuanjing raised her brows, \u201cPerhaps she thinks that there are too many ugly people around her, so she could not stand to look at them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou\u2019s eyelids twitched.\u2018In the past few days, I feel that Young Master has become much gentler, and it is just an illusion!\u2019\u2026Xie Qiao was sitting in a carriage offered to her as a gift by the people of Floating Pavilion Town. The coachmen were all her own people, so she felt more comfortable riding the carriage.After handling so many things by herself, her stepmother and stepsister were just about to depart from town. They caught up with one another after a while. The two teams slowly merged into one.Pei Wanyue\u2019s eyes were now swollen like walnuts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she was tired from crying, she fell asleep. However, she did not sleep well through the night.After a nightmare-riddled nightmare, her complexion seemed to darken the very next. She looked like cinder had been sprinkled all over her. She looked exceptionally awful.\u201cMother, Xie Qiao is too much. Now that she is already bullying me, in the future when\u2026 when we reach the Xie household, how am I supposed to survive? Why don\u2019t I head back to the Pei household?!\u201d The moment she heard that Xie Qiao had caught up, Pei Wanyue lost her composure.1Her mind was occupied with that skeleton from yesterday.And also last night\u2019s nightmare!\u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting? The Pei Family is ruthless. How could I let you go back there?!\u201d Ms. Lu pressed her fingers against her temples. \u201cJust look at yourself. You haven\u2019t even reached the Xie household and you\u2019re already giving up?\u201d\u201cMother, I am really scared. Since last night, my body has been ice-cold.\u201d Pei Wanyue wailed.\u201cAye. That brat is certainly nefarious. Goodness knows what she had been learning from that Taoist Temple!\u201d Ms. Lu sighed. \u201cYou are at fault too. You were too rash yesterday! I know you think she is pretty, and it will be a point of comparison between the two of you. But\u2026 she will not live long, anyway! \u201d1Pei Wanyue was silent for a moment.Not living long\u2026 Living till 20 was not a long life, neither was 40.There was no way Xie Qiao would be gone in these couple of years, right?\u201cWanyue. Just think about it. No matter how good she is, no one would ever bring her to mind if her body doesn\u2019t last. On the contrary, the more outstanding she is, the better it is for the Xie Family\u2019s reputation. That would in turn go back to you. So if she is excellent, would that not pave a path for you too?\u201d Ms. Lu added.No one had paid this daughter of hers much attention in the Pei household, so she was sheltered and had shallow views.Pei Wanyue pursed her lips.However, everyone wanted to be the best and not the second choice.\u201cMother, I don\u2019t feel well. I\u2019m cold and a little dizzy.\u201d Pei Wanyue\u2019s complexion was draining by the second.Ms. Lu was shocked when she heard that.Then she cautiously felt her daughter\u2019s forehead.\u201cYou\u2019re burning up?\u201d Ms. Lu frowned. \u201cPerhaps it was from yesterday\u2019s shock. Luckily, we have a physician with us. I\u2019ll ask the physician to see you.\u201dMs. Lu promptly let the physician look her over.It was just a normal cold and fever. There was not much of a problem.However, Pei Wanyue\u2019s symptoms were rather frightening. She was feeling unwell one day, then she collapsed the very next day.The physician was skilled in his own right. Pei Wanyue\u2019s fever was not that high. She only felt discomfort from the dizziness and had chills, so she stayed in the carriage and laid down to rest.Ms. Lu\u2019s face was dark.\u201cWe will stop once we reach the imperial city. We will continue only when you recover.\u201d Ms. Lu\u2019s expression was motherly.Pei Wanyue was feverishly delirious at that point, but she still shook her head. \u201cMother, that won\u2019t be good. We should continue and press onward. I wish to reach the imperial city sooner.\u201dHer voice was weak and frail. At that point, she looked even frailer than Xie Qiao.\u201cPress onwards? Would your body take it? You shouldn\u2019t let it get so bad that it\u2019ll leave side effects.\u201d Ms. Lu was getting frantic.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Mother. I want to go to your home sooner.\u201d Pei Wanyue was adamant.She had thought it through.She could not show up at the Xie household like a lost refugee.Now that she had fallen ill, the whole Xie Family would know that it was from the shock Xie Qiao had put her through. She could gain their pity that way.Ms. Lu did not know what was going through her daughter\u2019s head. She had only thought that her daughter did not have any support throughout all these years. That was why she was so adamant about this.Her heart ached for her as these sad thoughts went through her mind.Of course, Ms. Lu was blaming Xie Qiao in her heart. However, it was not appropriate to voice them out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She even had to fork out her own money for food and clothing.This just showed how mean her stepmother was.Now, many people around her felt that she had treated Xie Qiao harshly. If her daughter got sick and tried to stir up trouble with Xie Qiao again, she would not be able to reason for herself once she reached the Imperial City.So she decided to endure.\u2018If Xiao Qiao displeases me, I better avert my gaze.\u2018Xiao Qiao will feel more at ease this way.\u2019At that time, Zhao Xuanjing had already led people to find the desolate and ruined village in the southwest. The village was quite big, and it was not easy to scour it for a single item.But it was also much better than blindly searching like what he did before.He had everyone search the village thoroughly.The whole village was covered with weeds that grew wildly. Only some places covered by stones made for traversable terrain.Zhao Xuanjing gazed at the village landscape and drew upon his memories of Master Lu\u2019s personality. He put himself in Master Lu\u2019s shoes. Finally, his intuition brought him to the only private house in the village.But before he was ready to look for it, several men in black outfits suddenly appeared around him.\u201cProtect the Young Master!\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou and others were shocked.In an instant, there was a fight.Weeds were flying all over the place, and blood was splattered everywhere. The dim sky was covered by wool of the weeds, creating a gloomy fog.\u201cSwish\u2026\u201dSeveral arrows were released, piercing through the fog towards their direction.Zhao Xuanjing took a sword in his left hand and kicked a man in a black outfit. But the next moment, an arrow was shot straight into his chest. Everyone froze in shock.The next moment it became apparent that the arrow had not pierced his skin. Everyone seemed to faint at the sight.\u201cDang!\u201d The arrow tore his clothes but immediately fell to the ground.1Zhao Xuanjing was taken aback. Xie Qiao\u2019s words crossed his mind.\u2018Remember to watch out for weapons and sparks from fires?\u2018Is it\u2026 could the blessed mirror have saved his life?\u2019Zhao Xuanjing was unhurt. The guards around him rallied and quickly counterattacked. The group of people in black outfits had an advantage for their sudden attack. But now that they had missed the opportunity, they seemed far more helpless.Sand and stones flew.Their swords were rattled and clanked against each other.Qin Zhi confronted the three men in black in front of him. It was a difficult situation and he was forced to retreat. He did not realize that there was a dry well behind him. He did not think much about it. He just wanted to quickly get rid of the few badasses in front of him. A fierce fight ensued.His ability was extraordinary. Although he faced three difficult enemies, he quickly gained the upper hand.But for some reason, all of a sudden, his vision went blurry. His hands turned heavy and his arms felt weak. He felt as if someone had clamped his arms to his side.He felt as if someone was pulling him by the back of his head, and his body suddenly reeled back\u2026\u201cBe careful!\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou dashed over and shouted out loud.Qin Zhi\u2019s vision went black, and he was about to fall into the well at any moment.At the most critical moment, he suddenly felt a burning sensation in his chest.The burning sensation brought him back to consciousness just as he was about to fall. His hand successfully grabbed a stone that protruded from the wall of the well!Imperial Bodyguard Zhou and the others rushed over to help him immediately.After defeating the three men in black outfits, they hurriedly pulled him out of the well. When they took a look at him again, the man was able to stand on his feet, but his waist had somehow been cut. His clothes were already soaked with blood. It was a very scary sight.After a while, some of the men in black outfits lay dead, and others escaped.Qin Zhi was confused.He was not alone. Everyone else looked on, just as confused.The wound on his waist was bleeding profusely, but it did not reach his important organs. He was not seriously injured because he could still talk to everyone with a pale look on his face.\u201cMr. Zhou\u2026tell me, is it too late for me to kneel in front of that half-immortal Xie now?\u201d Qin Zhi\u2019s felt a tightness in his throat, fearing that his life might be coming to an end.He even took out the safety talisman Mr. Zhou had forced upon him.\u2018It had turned into ash?\u2019\u201c\u2026\u201d Qin Zhi had never experienced such fear, even if he had escaped this day with his life.\u201cMy dear mom, Qin Zhi, the one at my home is really not my biological parent\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We should just call her a god. Half-immortal Xie had predicted that harm would come my way, but she did not predict the issues that would befall my family. Did she now? \u201c\u201d\u201cYou are still stubborn. See here, she just saved your life.\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou shook his head.Then he headed over to check out the well, pointing to the bottom. \u201cSee for yourself.\u201dQin Zhi craned his neck over.With a glance, his temple throbbed.Oh gosh.This was a dried-out well. It was not too deep. The bottom was covered in mush and weeds. Atop the dirt, there was an abandoned animal trap!Even though the trap was already broken, the pair of razor-sharp blades reached up towards the sky. If he were to fall down into the well and his head landed on that\u2026Blood would definitely spray everywhere. It would be instant death.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you have fast reflexes, brother.\u201d Someone patted his shoulder. \u201cYou just scraped through death.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 was burned by the talisman. It shocked me back to my senses\u2026\u201d Qin Zhi\u2019s mouth was dry. \u201cRight. You know my capabilities well too. I\u2019m more than qualified to take care of those three. But for some reason, ever since just now, I\u2019ve been feeling off. Like someone strangling me\u2026\u201dWhen he said this, his brothers in arms around him scooted backward.They were avoiding him as much as they could.\u201cYou guys are too much. I almost died!\u201d Qin Zhi said wistfully.\u201cNo, your words sound creepy. You better not have anything impure on you.\u201d\u201cYou said it yourself that it\u2019s evil. How could you blame us for thinking this way? We are giving you an enormous benefit of doubt here. \u201d\u201cQin Zhi.\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou\u2019s face turned stern. \u201cThe grand immortal said that there are some big problems with you. We need to clear the problem from its root. Otherwise\u2026 trouble will eventually come knocking.\u201dWhen he said this, everyone took another step back.2There was a major problem. Would that mean that he was a goner?\u201cZhou\u2026 Zhou, don\u2019t frighten me.\u201d Qin Zhi\u2019s face was green.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou huffed. \u201cThe half deity has set off for the imperial city. Later on\u2026 when we are done, let\u2019s make a trip to Water Moon Temple. The Grand Immortal\u2019s master can solve your problems for sure!\u201dQin Zhi\u2019s eyes shone when he heard this.He was saved!\u201cThat\u2019s great. Let\u2019s search around first. It\u2019ll be hard to search when it gets dark later on.\u201dWith Imperial Bodyguard Zhou\u2019s comment, everyone continued back to work.Zhao Xuanjing entered his private chambers. After a thorough search, there really was a stone tile. Underneath it, he found a square box.His face looked troubled.Now that he found it, Zhao Xuanjing gathered his men and promptly left.Xie Qiao did not know that her gift had already saved someone. Even if she did, she would not think much of it.Service in exchange for payment, goods were delivered, and the transaction was closed. Whatever happened next was not her concern.The closer she was to the imperial city, the calmer Xie Qiao became.She only spoke to Da Xiong every day, not even caring about the whereabouts of the Lu mother-daughter duo.Ms. Lu\u2019s company was rushing, and they did not seem to stop. Xie Qiao followed suit too. Secretly, she sneaked some extra silver to her coachman for their hard work.The usual way to the imperial city would usually be at least one and half months\u2019 journey. However, they had crammed it down one month.When they reached the city gates, they sent a messenger to the Xie family in advance.That way, by the time they reached home, the household would be ready for their arrival.On the rare occasion when Xie Qiao mustered some energy, she no longer looked sickly.She had left home for so many years. It was not nice to worry the family the second she walked home.Xie Niushan was only a lowly fourth-grade general. He bought the house himself. It was also surrounded by other low-ranking generals\u2019 homes.\u201cMiss, they have stopped up ahead. We should have arrived.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were many people at the front entrance but she could not see what they looked like.The housekeeper of the Xie family home was waiting at the door.With a respectful look, he personally stepped forward and waited for Ms. Lu to get out of the carriage.\u201cWhere is the Master?\u201d Ms. Lu got out of the carriage and only caught sight of the servant. When she did not see her husband and her stepchildren, she frowned slightly.\u201cThe Master and the Eldest Young Master are still in the military camp at the moment. I thought you would only be back in half a month\u2019s time. I didn\u2019t expect it to be so soon. I have sent someone out to inform the heads. The Second Young Master and the Young Lady are in the academy now,\u201d the housekeeper quickly replied.\u201cAcademy?\u201d After Pei Wanyue got out of the carriage, she was puzzled and spoke up in a weak and slightly hoarse voice.\u201cOh, it was opened by the royal family. Uncle Xie\u2026Your dad, spent a lot of money dredging in order for the two young ones to be admitted into the Academy,\u201d Ms. Lu replied.Pei Wanyue pursed her mouth, \u201cI never expected girls to be able to go to school too. There is no such thing in Liao Zhou\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, Liao Zhou is a small place and is relatively remote. It is not surprising that ladies are kept at home under tight watch and not allowed to study at the academies. There are three well-known large academies in the imperial city, all of which accept ladies. The situation in other nearby cities is similar. This is all due to Empress Dowager Jiang\u2019s credits.\u201d Ms. Lu explained.This Empress Dowager Jiang had a deep affection for the late Emperor, and she had been his childhood sweetheart since they were young.Empress Dowager Jiang was born into a general\u2019s family. She had a hearty and generous personality. From the day she became Queen, she had been encouraging girls to enroll in academies.Although this was met with great resistance, some progress was made.Most ladies that came from large families had to study and learn philosophy.Many people wished to marry a highly-educated wife from these academies. After all, if the wife had an education, she could better educate her children in the future.Pei Wanyue showed a look of yearning.\u201cMom, when I was at my home in Liao Zhou, I used to\u2026 read books.\u201d Pei Wanyue spoke in a very faint voice.Ms. Lu was stunned, and then she understood what was meant by her daughter. She calmly replied, \u201cWhen your dad comes back, I\u2019ll tell him about this. The Royal Academy is not easy for one to gain admission, but going to the other two academies is still possible.\u201dPei Wanyue could not help but clench her fist.\u2018If I wish to join an academy, I would certainly join the Royal Academy!\u2019\u2018Who did not want to gain good education or be the top scorer in the government entrance examination?\u20191Pei Wanyue was reluctant to say this directly. She only nodded her head gently.Immediately after, the housekeeper began to ask his men to unload things. Just as they prepared to go to work, Xie Qiao got out of the carriage.The housekeeper was taken aback.\u201cAre you\u2026 the Eldest Lady?\u201d The housekeeper took in her presence all at once.\u2018I feel strange. There is only one lady beside Ms. Lu, and I am reluctant to ask vocally whether the lady is Ms. Xie or Ms. Pei. If I address her wrongly, Ms. Lu might get angry with me.\u2019Ms. Lu had really forgotten about Xie Qiao.Xie Qiao\u2019s presence was just that unimportant to Ms. Lu all along the way!When the housekeeper said that, Ms. Lu\u2019s facial expression changed completely, \u201cQiao Er, this is the housekeeper, Yuan Rong. He is the old man who followed the Master earlier. If you want a favor, just ask him.\u201d\u201cIt is Yuan Rong\u2019s pleasure to meet the Eldest Lady.\u201d The housekeeper glanced at Xie Qiao and was a little surprised. He raised his eyebrows slightly and said in a lighthearted tone, \u201cThe Eldest Lady\u2019s courtyard is ready. I shall lead you there.\u201dXie Qiao nodded her head slightly.Everyone was very curious about the Eldest Lady, and they could not help but take a few more glances at her at that moment.They were deeply shocked in their hearts.They heard that the Eldest Lady who had been raised elsewhere was coming back home. The maids and even the servants of the family were curious about her for a while.They all knew that the Eldest Lady and the Eldest Young Master were monoamniotic twins. So they all felt that the Eldest Lady\u2019s physical appearance could not amount to much.They had never expected her to grow into a fine lady like this!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They only knew that this young lady was elegant. She was prettier than all the ladies in imperial city, any time of the day. She seemed to radiate light. No one could take their eyes off her.The Wans carried Xie Qiao bamboo basket, whereas Chun Er carried the huge rooster.The remaining belongings were not important, so she let the Xie family help her carry them.They had discussed with the coachman earlier concerning the Floating Pavilion Town. Now that they have sent her here, they would turn to take the same road back.\u201cThe master chose this courtyard himself. It might be a little far, but he says that the place is quiet. There are many pear trees in the yard. Soon, they will be ready to pick and eat. You would love this.\u201d The housekeeper said calmly.Compared to his solicitous manners toward Ms. Lu, his manners toward Xie Qiao were a lot more straightforward and casual.Xie Qiao only hummed in response without saying much.The courtyard was indeed rather far.It reached into the farthest northeast corner of the Xie household.The courtyard was already cleaned. It was very spacious. There were a few large open tanks with beautiful water lilies in them. The interior of the house was simple but adequately furnished. It was well equipped with green tents, new dressing tables, and an empty cabinet.All in all, it was rather satisfactory.It also saved them the effort of renovating and decorating the whole place.Even though they did not need to tear down the whole place, there were still parts that needed some improvement.\u201cIs there anything not satisfactory to your tastes?\u201d The housekeeper saw her glancing around and asked.\u201cAre there no wells in my yard?\u201d Xie Qiao asked.\u201cThere is. There\u2019s a small kitchen at the side. You may use it at night if you are hungry. There is a well outside the small kitchen,\u201d the housekeeper said.Xie Qiao went over to study it. She could not help but frown. \u201cFill this well with sand. Dig up a new well on the place where I was standing on just now.\u201dWells and stove should not be placed opposite each other. Also, this place was in the Oxen Position. Digging a well in this position would not bring goodwill to the harmony between the siblings. This place was rather remote, but since the family rarely came here, it did not matter anyway. However, now that she was going to move in for good, what had to be changed would be changed.\u201cFill the well?!\u201d The housekeeper was stunned.The others following behind the housekeeper were also stunned.They thought they were supposed to fill in the place with some flowering shrubs or greenery, but they had not expected this young lady to have the well filled up only to rebuild another.\u201cMiss, isn\u2019t filling up a well too much trouble? Also, how does this well inconvenience you so?\u201d The housekeeper frowned.\u201cHow many silver pieces would it take?\u201d Xie Qiao stared back at him.The housekeeper was struck dumb. \u201cNot much\u2026\u201dIt was just the building of a well. Even if the Xie Household was considered poor among the government officials, they were still government officials. How could they not afford to pay for minor expenses like these?\u201cSince it doesn\u2019t cost too much, then do as I say.\u201d Xie Qiao kept her words clipped.Actually, she wanted to cut those two pear trees down too.Theoretically, planting pear trees in the yards did not bode well. But in this case, the trees were in an adequate position, but not without a few caveats. Also, it was an act of kindness from her eldest brother. It was better to leave them as they were.The housekeeper\u2019s heart clenched. It was not his place to speak anymore, so he merely nodded.\u201cYou were by my father\u2019s side from before? Then, have you seen my mother?\u201d Xie Qiao spoke gently.\u201cWhen I came under the master employ, the First Lady had already passed. The Second Lady was still around back then.\u201d The housekeeper opened up.The Second lady?Even though Xie Qiao had not been home for the past few years, she was still aware of the Xie household\u2019s internal affairs.The second lady, Ms. Lin was her sibling\u2019s biological mother. She was pressed to enter the mountains and marry her father after her own mother died. After the father made a huge fuss over her, she disappeared after giving her father twins.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His thick hair and sideburns implied that he did not have good vision. With his vigorous energy, he must have an evil heart. Moreover, his relatively narrow facial features and sharp-pointed teeth showed that he was a greedy man.Xie Qiao sighed lightly.Yuan Rong did not expect to be dismissed just like that.He recalled the time when Ms. Lu was married into the family. He was given a small gift and she had been very polite to him.\u2018How dare this eldest young lady not taking me seriously.\u2019\u2018If she is favored, that is absolutely fine. But this eldest lady had been raised outside. When she returned, the Master and the Eldest Young Master had specially chosen a remote and desolate small courtyard for her to settle in. Where does she stand in their hearts?\u2019\u2018If she does not know her place soon, she would definitely lose out!\u2019\u201cYoung Lady, is this place too remote for you?\u201d Chun Er looked worried, and she felt like the Young Lady was losing out.\u201cVery good.\u201d Xie Qiao told the truth, \u201cIf a courtyard bustling with noise has been arranged for me, I\u2019ll have to change it.\u201dChun Er breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that she did not have an unhappy expression on her face.\u201cI think Da Xiong is a little tired. I will put him in the courtyard to rest.\u201d Chun Er said again.\u201cGive him a pot of dried insects.\u201d Xie Qiao\u2019s voice became clear whenever her huge rooster was mentioned.Chun Er could not help but keep laughing.\u201cThe way you treat this huge rooster is better than you treat yourself!\u201dChun Er felt that this was a weird phenomena. But later she discovered that this huge rooster could even recognize his own Master. It made complete sense to her why Xie Qiao treated him so well.\u2018Dogs that recognize their Master might be a lot, but a rooster that could recognize his Master\u2026\u2026might be just one of a kind?\u2018She would naturally want to keep this huge rooster which was so rare.\u2019Xie Qiao smiled bitterly.The reason why she was good to Da Xiong was because she had raised this huge rooster all by herself. On the other hand, her huge rooster drove away evil spirits, and Da Xiong had been fed by her with various potent insects and runes since childhood. His Yang energy was greater than ever. By having him by her side, this would at least guarantee that she could have a good night\u2019s sleep.Xie Qiao\u2019s body was actually overwhelmed with fatigue after the long journey.She lay down on the bed and fell asleep after a while.When she woke up, Chun Er came to report that Xie Niushan, her elder brother and younger siblings had just returned home.She was invited to come over for dinner.Xie Qiao changed into a lotus-colored dress. She looked a bit more energetic in this attire.At that moment, Xie Niushan was together with Ms. Lu and her daughter.\u201cThe two of you are back early. Have you seen your eldest sister?\u201d Xie Niushan asked Xie Pinghuai and Xie Xi.His voice sounded very fierce, and Xie Ping shrank his head.\u201cNo, I just sent someone over and she said that the eldest sister was sleeping, so I didn\u2019t want to bother her. I played with this sister first.\u201d Xie Pinghuai said quickly.Xie Niushan turned his gaze on Pei Wanyue.Pei Wanyue hurriedly came out and prostrated to Xie Niushan, \u201cWanyue greets Daddy here.\u201dXie Niushan was taken aback, \u201cWhat are you addressing me here?\u201dPei Wanyue blushed with embarrassment.\u201cI asked her to address you that way. She is my daughter. Now that she is following me, she naturally wants to address you as her daddy.\u201d Ms. Lu said quickly.Xie Niushan was very happy when he heard this, \u201cThat\u2019s good. She is really good-looking and sweet.\u201dAs he said that, he took out a small dagger from his arms, \u201cHold this and play with it!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Pei Wanyue\u2019s hands dropped as she grabbed hold of the dagger. The dagger was actually inlaid with gems, which looked nice. It would be even better for her if the dagger was replaced with jewelry.\u201cThank you, daddy.\u201d Pei Wanyue was very obedient. As soon as she finished speaking, she let out a cough.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re not well?\u201d Xie Niushan frowned so deeply that a fly could be trapped inside his furrowed brow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She seemed rather terrified. \u201cThat\u2019s not it. I just had a shock along the way. It\u2019s nothing. You don\u2019t need to worry, father.\u201d\u201cShock? What did you face along the way?\u201dXie Niushan did not mean to ask any further. He was worried that his daughter who had appeared so suddenly would feel left out. So he tried to humor her.Pei Wanyue stammered like she was struggling to say something.Her behavior made Xie Niushan even more curious.\u201cWhat actually happened?\u201d Xie Niushan\u2019s voice sounded dark, like he was ready to pummel someone.Ms. Lu saw that her daughter was at a loss so she said, \u201cWhen we picked up that brat Xie Qiao, she brought along a strange package. We were afraid that it might be checked for being suspicious, so we opened and peeked in. We did not expect it to be human bones. Then, Xie Qiao forced her to pack the skeleton back in. She is cowardly and hasn\u2019t experienced the harsh realities of the world yet, so she got a shock.\u201dJust because of this?Xie Niushan\u2019s brows furrowed.It was just a set of human bones\u2026\u201cJust practice a bit more. Your eldest brother has kept some medicine specifically formulated to process these bones so that they\u2019ll be clean and neat. They are just hanging in his study. You may head in and have a look now and then. After a few more peeps, you won\u2019t be shocked anymore,\u201d Xie Niushan said matter-of-factly.2The moment he said this, Pei Wanyue\u2019s face immediately blanched.Ms. Lu was stunned too.She had always known that Xie Pinggang was peculiar, but she had never expected him to keep human skeletons in his home!These siblings!Just then, Xie Pinggang sat at the side.He was one head taller than Xie Niushan. His burly form was as large as a bear. Pei Wanyue did not even dare to look at him. Now that she knew he had such a fetish, she was even more afraid of lifting her eyes to him.Xie Pinggang was rather considerate. \u201cWhy would a girl want to see such things? You\u2019ll just make yourself sick from shock for no reason.\u201dPei Wanyue did not feel any better.This feeling was like a bear standing in front of her, telling her not to be scared.Mother said that Xie Pinggang was burly and looked fierce. Before she arrived, she had tried her best to imagine him. But now that she has seen him in person, she felt like her imagination had fallen short.\u201cFather, have you prepared the gift for Xie Qiao?\u201d Xie Pinggang suddenly spoke up and asked.\u201cNot yet? I was thinking of checking it out after a couple more days. Who knew that they would be home so soon,\u201d Xie Niushan said, more to himself than anyone.Xie Pinggang lifted his head lightly. \u201cNeither did I. I\u2019ve finished my allowance for this month. Lend me some, Father.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t lend you any! Shoo! I don\u2019t have much silver left either!\u201d Xie Niushan rolled his eyes, suddenly feeling that his hands were empty. He felt himself struggling a bit.He was poor.Being an official costs too much money!Just this rotten house and rotten title had already cleared his whole treasury. The remaining bits were to feed this group of leeches. He did not even have enough for two sips of better wine. Every month he had to work his hardest to earn money, and he did not dare spend any!Xie Niushan and Xie Pinggang\u2019s sight fell on Xie Xi at the same time.Xie Xi and Xie Pinghuai were both only 12 years old this year.Xie Xi immediately dipped his head. \u201cNo money, poor\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any either!\u201d Xie Pinghuai echoed.\u201cPinghuai has it.\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s head hung, mumbling.\u201c\u2026\u201d Xie Pinghuai promptly jumped backward. \u201cYou are not to take my silver away. My mom just gave me these! They haven\u2019t even been with me long enough to warm up!\u201d1\u201cHeheh. Even if you were to hold the stones or silver in your hands for 10 days or half a month, they wouldn\u2019t warm up much either. As a younger brother, you should respect your elder siblings.\u201d Xie Pinggang stood up.Like carrying a chicken, he picked up Xie Pinghuai and poked around his clothes. After flipping through, he picked out two silver notes worth 50 silver pieces each.\u201cJust enough, Father. A piece each from us. If we don\u2019t have any presents then let\u2019s give her money directly. Neither of us will outdo the other.\u201d Xie Pinggang directly tossed half the share of money over.\u201cWhat about me\u2026\u201d Xie Pinghuai\u2019s eyes were glazed over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Welcome GiftXie Pinghuai was angry, but he dared not vent his anger. He seemed angry, but he was rather cowardly.His mother had only given him the silver when she got home!He had only had it for less than two hours, and it was gone now!Xie Pinggang was very satisfied, while Pei Wanyue looked rather lost in her eyes.Were they really her blood-related father and siblings? She was there too, so how come they were unwilling to give her a welcome gift?50 taels of silver were better than a cold dagger, right?However, Ms. Lu was over the moon.It was not just a small dagger to her. Her husband hardly had any other hobbies other than violent activities. Xie Niushan had obtained the dagger when he was a bandit. The precious stone on it was valuable, whereby it could be sold at 1,000 taels of silver at least!However, what were they giving Xie Qiao?Silver notes?Ms. Lu\u2019s eyes were smiling. She looked loving as she patted Xie Pinghuai\u2019s head and said, \u201cMother will give you more when we\u2019re home.\u201dXie Pinghuai smirked when he heard that. \u201cGreat!\u201dXie Pinggang snorted at Xie Pinghuai. The latter hid his head from the scare, and just when he was going to speak, Xie Qiao walked in from the outside.Everyone turned their heads to look.Xie Niushan\u2019s eyes opened wide and lit up. He lifted his feet immediately and approached her. \u201cElder daughter? You\u2019re my daughter?!\u201dXie Qian\u2019s eyelids twitched.Xie Niushan was already pressing on her shoulders, and his eyes were as wide as a bull\u2019s eyes. \u201cTsk, tsk, tsk. Only I could give birth to such a pretty lady! A brat said that my daughter would definitely be as big as a bear yesterday. He even said that I\u2019d need to pay more dowry to be able to marry off my daughter! Look at you, who can compare to you!?\u201dXie Niushan had pride written all over his face.Xie Qiao rolled her eyes silently.Xie Pinggang stood up and walked to her at the moment.There seemed to be two walls standing next to Xie Qiao now!Her eldest brother was at least 2.1 meters tall\u2026 Forget that he was tall; he was muscular too. The muscles on his body looked very scary, while his skin was tanned. One could not stare at him for too long.Now, look at her father\u2026She had lived for many years. Apart from sending letters home every year, Xie Qiao had only seen her father once when she was born.As her mother had passed away that time, her father\u2019s face was gloomy, leaving her a deep shadow.She had just transmigrated into a fetus back then, so Xie Niushan had left too deep of an impression on her. Now that she looked at him, she thought this man looked about 40 now. He was no longer an eyesore like before.\u201cFather, did that old Taoist geezer, Mo Lingzi, kidnap her? She doesn\u2019t look like one of us.\u201d Xie Pinggang was rather pertinent. He knew what his family members looked like.Xie Niushan was stunned at first, while he was pissed subsequently. \u201cNonsense! Look at her nose and eyes. Don\u2019t they look exactly like mine!?\u201dHe could tell that this was his child just by looking at her!\u201cFather, can you stop humiliating your daughter?\u201d Xie Qiao said helplessly.Xie Niushan was stunned for a little, which made Xie Pinggang happy. \u201cThat\u2019s right, you\u2019re my sister. That\u2019s right!\u201dXie Niushan harrumphed.\u201cEldest brother,\u201d Xie Qiao called out.\u201cGreat, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re home.\u201d Xie Pinggang\u2019s attitude became much calmer after the joy.Xie Niushan seemed to have recalled something, and his smile was no longer as bright before.\u201cThese are your brother and sister. They\u2019re both good-for-nothing,\u201d Xie Niushan said.Xie Pinghuai and Xie Xi were secretly observing Xie Qiao.The reason being they had only heard about her, but they had never seen her. Thus, Xie Qiao was a stranger to them.They called out obediently, \u201cEldest sister.\u201dXie Qiao nodded and brought two things out of her embrace. \u201cIt\u2019s our first time meeting, these are for you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: RobbingThose were two pouches of the same size.After Xie Qiao gave them gifts, Pei Wanyue recalled that she had come empty-handed. She panicked a little at that moment. She thought about it and removed two things from her body immediately.She was a girl after all, so she could only give accessories.It made sense to give Xie Qi those, but it would be a little weird to give them to Xie Pinghuai.She was not sure what to do at the moment, so she stood there awkwardly.\u201cHuai\u2019er is a boy, so he wouldn\u2019t care about all these. Your second sister will give you a gift next time, alright?\u201d Ms. Lu spoke on behalf of her daughter.Xie Pinghuai nodded straightforwardly and looked at the gift that Xie Qiao had given him.He could not understand it as he checked it and looked confused.\u201cWhat is this that sister gave?\u201d Pei Wanyue asked.Xie Pinghuai brought it out directly when he heard that and showed it to everyone on his palm.Xie Pinggang snatched it when he saw it. \u201cIt\u2019s a small jade ship? The carving skill is amazing\u2026 Wait\u2026\u201dHe looked closer as if he was going to put it on his head. Subsequently, his facial expression changed, and he shoved the thing into his embrace directly.\u201cEldest brother?\u201d Xie Pinghuai looked stunned.What was this? Was this not just a piece of jade? He wanted to rob him of this too!?\u201cIt\u2019ll be too much of a waste for you to have this,\u201d Xie Pinggang said in all seriousness. \u201cYou\u2019re just a reckless brat. What if you break it when you carry it around? Let me keep it for you. I\u2019ll give it back when you\u2019re all grown up and marrying a wife.\u201dXie Niushan felt his terrible eldest son\u2019s rather off attitude and observed him.\u201cEldest daughter, what did you give them?\u201d Xie Niushan asked.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing rare. It\u2019s just a jade sculpture with sentences from Tao Te Ching[1] carved on it.\u201d Xie Qiao looked calm, so calm that she made Xie Niushan think this thing indeed had no value.Xie Pinggang heaved a sigh of relief.Jade sculpture?It was an authentic jade, but it was not the best quality.However, the sculpting skill was amazing. Not only that, but he also discovered there were two words, \u2018Yun Wei\u2019, carved at the bottom. Therefore, a master had carved this thing. If it was sold, he could totally sell it for 700\u2013800 taels of silver.It was wasted. If it was a high-quality jade, it could be sold a few folds higher.In order to change the subject, Xie Pinggang shoved the 50 silver notes to Xie Qiao immediately. \u201cYou\u2019ve just arrived in the Imperial City, don\u2019t just stay home. You\u2019ll be so bored. Bring Pei\u2026 I mean second sister out shopping when you\u2019re free. Go get yourself some knick-knacks.\u201dHe was flushing a little.The 50 silver notes seemed to be too little\u2026There was nothing that he could do. He could only spend less next month and give her more.Xie Niushan thought it was too little as well, so he gave his portion of silver notes as well.Xie Qiao accepted the silver notes calmly.Xie Pinggang raised his head and suddenly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that in little sister\u2019s hand?\u201dXie Xi\u2019s little face that was blushing became tense now. She shoved the thing into her embrace directly and said in all seriousness while looking at Xie Pinggang, \u201cRock, tiny rock.\u201dXie Pinggang\u2019s eyelids twitched.Well, he got it when she said it was a piece of rock.He knew what his sister Xi\u2019er liked. The thing that was in the pouch must be taels of silver.Judging by the weight, it would be great if there were 20 taels of silver. Forget it, it was a meager amount of money. He did not care for it.Xie Qiao had fondness flashing in her eyes when she looked at Xie Xi.This little girl was pretty and likeable.Unfortunately, she had been stuck in Ms. Lin\u2019s belly for too long when she was coming into the world, so she was not exactly smart. However, she was not considered dumb either. She was just slower than regular people.Xie Qiao found out about all those things from Xie Niushan, who had gotten someone to write her a letter every year.Therefore, she had an idea of what was happening here.[1] The Tao Te Ching is a fundamental text for both philosophical and religious Taoism. It also strongly influenced other schools of Chinese philosophy and religion, including Legalism, Confucianism, and Buddhism, which was largely interpreted through the use of Taoist words and concepts when it was originally introduced to China.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: The Legitimate BanditThe gift that Xie Qiao gave Xie Xi was a solid gold piece.Xie Pinggang missed the opportunity to rob while he was caressing the jade sculpture in his embrace like a fool.\u201cLet\u2019s eat while we chat.\u201d Xie Niushan was very happy as he watched.\u201cAren\u2019t we going to visit grandmother?\u201d Xie Qiao suddenly asked.Xie Niushan\u2019s facial expression became stiff when he heard that.Although the Xie family had gained their wealth from being bandits, they had many offsprings.When Xie Niushan had become a bandit back then, he cut ties with the Xie family to avoid dragging in his mother and brothers. After becoming an official later on, he had been feeling guilty about mistreating his mother, who had brought him up for years. Thus, he had gotten people to bring her back to him.Since he was taking care of the old lady, it was only natural that he had to take care of her other sons and grandchildren.From what Xie Qiao knew, the old lady did not live here. Xie Niushan\u2019s limited silvers had been given to the Xie family\u2019s two wives to buy a house each.She knew nothing much about the rest.Since she was here, it would be rude not to meet the seniors.She had to be nice to just ask, which was the least she could do.Xie Niushan looked somewhat awkward. Xie Pinggang was more straightforward as he said directly, \u201cThe old lady doesn\u2019t like us, so don\u2019t look for her unless there\u2019s something urgent. You won\u2019t get anything good out of it.\u201d\u201cHah!\u201d Xie Niushan forced a cackle.Upon noticing that her husband looked terrible, Ms. Lu said caringly, \u201cQiao\u2019er, don\u2019t blame your grandmother. The thing is, the old lady is strict when it comes to rules. She was unhappy that your father became a bandit back then, so\u2026 she isn\u2019t fond of you and Gang\u2019er as well.\u201dXie Qiao raised her brows slightly.Although they did not say much, she got it anyway.She and her eldest brother\u2019s biological mother, Ms. Peng, was an even more legitimate bandit than his father.Her biological grandfather was the bandit group\u2019s previous leader. One could say that her grandfather had persuaded Xie Niushan to be his son-in-law to inherit the mountain stronghold.To the old lady, she and Xie Pinggang had the blood of a bandit.Regarding Xie Pingguai and Xie Xi\u2026 Ms. Lin had given birth to them. She was a good person.Xie Pinggang snorted. \u201cWhat rules? She\u2019s just old and dumb. Without my mother, could she be the matriarch at home now? Does she think the other dumb wives of the Xie family enabled her to do this?\u201d\u201cWhat am I to you?! How dare you criticize my mother right in front of me!?\u201d Xie Niushan was upset when he heard that and kicked Xie Pinggang\u2019s thigh.Unexpectedly, Xie Niushan was thrown back by his own kick.He was pissed.Xie Pinggang turned his head to glare at him.Xie Niushan lifted his head and snarled, \u201cI\u2019m your father, can\u2019t I kick you?!\u201d\u201cHmph, don\u2019t forget how you got your general position. I\u2019m a man, so I won\u2019t make a fuss about that old b*tch. Get her to behave herself, or my fist won\u2019t have eyes when I punch!\u201d Xie Pinggang scoffed.Xie Niushan felt rather helpless.That was his mother!D*mn it!Pei Wanyue was dumbstruck as she watched.She had never seen such an\u2026 unfilial grandson!What Xie Pinggang said were actually empty words. He looked fierce, but he would not really fight with his own father. He even sat down in a composed manner.After learning the situation, Xie Qiao naturally would not ask to see the old lady now. She was not a masochist.Xie Niushan proceeded to talk at the dining table.He boasted how invincible he was in the military camp. If not for his lowly background, he would have been promoted now. He would not be stuck at being a lowly fourth-grade general now.\u201cIt\u2019s useless for you to say all these. Get some silvers from the treasury and buy your way into letting my eldest sister visit the Academy. She\u2019ll only find someone eligible there.\u201d Xie Pinggang threw him a cold blanket at the critical moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Taking a ShortcutHowever, what Xie Pinggang said reminded Xie Niushan, and his old face frowned immediately. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be hard. The Royal Academy has already accepted two good-for-nothings from our family. I don\u2019t know how much silver I\u2019ll need to pay the dean if I send one more.\u201d\u201cYue\u2019er is slightly younger than Qiao\u2019er. The sisters should be together. You\u2019ll have to send the both of them, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Ms. Lu added.Xie Niushan suddenly came to a realization that he needed to raise someone else\u2019s daughter as well.He looked crestfallen.\u2018Had I ever needed to worry about money when I was a bandit back then? Great, I don\u2019t even have gold and silver ever since I became an official. I\u2019ve been living a sh*tty life!\u2019 Xie Niushan was enraged as he thought about it.The imperial court was an evil b*stard.\u201cHmm? Did father regret being an official? You can quit your job and return to the mountain,\u201d Xie Qiao said casually.Xie Niushan\u2019s eyelids twitched, \u201cHow can I do that\u2026\u201dBack then, chaos had broken out at the borders. The imperial court could not handle it, so Xie Qiao had written to him, asking him to protect the people. He had thus been given an opportunity to become a good citizen.He had discussed with the military adviser about the chaos. Given that he despised those barbarians at the borders, he fought them.He had accidentally gone overboard and chopped the barbarians\u2019 heads. As such, he thought he would just enlist himself to the imperial court willingly.To convince the imperial court, he had broken up the entire mountain stronghold. He had given the gold and silver that he had made, as well as the things he had robbed at the borders, to the imperial court.As he had been sincere, he was given the position of a fourth-grade general.However, he had lost a lot of money that year, so he had been living with his belt tight these years. It was torturing!Naturally, being an official was much better than being a bandit.At least, these good-for-nothings at home would not be embarrassed to go out. They did not have to hide in the mountain stronghold all the time.\u201cWhich academy would you like to go to, Qiao\u2019er? The Royal Academy is too expensive, and that dean treats money as important as his life. If you want to get in by bribery, a person would need to pay at least 5,000 taels of silvers. I\u2019m tight with money,\u201d said Xie Niushan, feeling wronged.It was not that he did not have the money.It was mainly because these good-for-nothings were still single.He had to make money so that he would have enough money to pay for their weddings.That was especially so for the eldest son, who was big in size. All ladies would be scared when they saw him. Who would dare to marry him? He was past 20, and he could not find a wife until now. How could Xie Niushan not prepare more silvers for him?\u201cCan I not go to an academy?\u201d asked Xie Qiao.\u201cNot that you can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Xie Niushan hesitated.\u201cYou must.\u201d Xie Pinggang was straightforward. \u201cUnless you want to stay a spinster forever. Your father is an official, after all. He can\u2019t let you marry a commoner. There\u2019s a rule in the Imperial City now. All family members of officials must marry wives who have studied in an academy.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. That\u2019s the rule.\u201d Xie Niushan nodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to study too much. Just pass your time when you\u2019re in there.\u201dHe did not expect this daughter of his to advance in her studies.This girl was raised in the Taoist temple, so what would she know!?Pei Wanyue mustered her courage and said, \u201cSister has been neglected for so long. If she studies at the Royal Academy, it would be better for her title. It should be better than the other two academies, right?\u201dThe dining table went silent as soon as that was said.Xie Pinggang said nothing.Xie Niushan hesitated for a moment. \u201cThat makes sense. Let me think about it.\u201dXie Qiao spoke. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, let me worry about the money.\u201d\u201cYou? Do you have silvers? They might not accept you even if you have 5,000 taels of silvers. We can take a shortcut because I know the dean,\u201d Xie Niushan said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: QualificationXie Qiao did not consider having much silver with her.The Water Moon Temple was running all year. The loss was pretty heavy.She would not take just any job. Although the Water Moon Temple was famous in Yunjin, not many people were burning incense there.There were few people at the temple. Their hands were full, causing the silvers they made to drop significantly.She had brought 6,000\u20137,000 taels of silver for her trip this time. It seemed a lot, but in reality, there were many things to spend on.Her body was lacking in health, so she was weak. Although the various souls caused it, she had to replenish her body.Forget it that she had been eating ginseng like nothing since young; the old man had even prescribed her with Yang energy medicine. The ingredients were very expensive\u2014one to two stalks of ambergris would cost 40 taels of silver!Apart from her own medical expenses, food for Da Xiong cost quite a bit.A portion of the worms that Da Xiong ate was dried insects from the mountain.Meanwhile, a portion of them were the worms that she caught herself and fed with cinnabar.Cinnabar could replenish one\u2019s spirit, calm one\u2019s soul, and go well with fire. As it was retrieved from veins with the essence of sun and moon, it came with Yang energy.The cinnabar she used had to be high quality as well.Although Da Xiong did not eat many worms, she needed it to practice talisman inscription on the daily. The expenses were significant when added together.Overall, she was poor as well.It was their first time meeting, so she did not want to spend Xie Niushan\u2019s silver.Although he was her biological father, this father was indeed poor, saving every little bit he could.\u201cWhat kind of people does the Royal Academy take in? Or do we need silvers and an official in the family?\u201d asked Xie Qiao.Pei Wanyue looked at Xie Niushan curiously too.Xie Niushan thought about it for a little bit. \u201cI\u2019m not too sure about that. I only know that your brother and sister didn\u2019t even sit for the examination back then. We only paid.\u201dXie Pinghuai lifted his head carefully and said happily, \u201cI know!\u201d\u201cPlease enlighten us, brother,\u201d Xie Qiao said while smiling.Xie Pinghuai\u2019s cheeks blushed.\u201cFor the children of third-grade and above officials, the direct sons and daughters can study in the academy directly after eight without having to sit for the examination. The unofficial sons and daughters can only sit for the examination after ten. However, the content is very simple. As long as one isn\u2019t dumb and not entirely without skill, most can get in.\u201cFor the children of below third-grade officials, apart from paying silver to buy the qualifications, they\u2019d have to sit for the examination after ten. However, the examination is slightly more difficult. It\u2019s similar to the imperial examination.\u201cNot only will the unofficial sons and daughters need to sit for the examination, but the fee is also one time more expensive.\u201cCommoners can apply too, but the requirement is even higher. They\u2019ll either have to pay a huge sum, smart enough, or they\u2019d need to be recommended by third-grade and above officials.\u201cThe difference between male and female would be\u2026 They\u2019d only accept male students once a year, whose age is between ten to 25. For females after ten, there\u2019ll be a certain day each month for the examination. They can\u2019t enroll if they\u2019re married.\u201d Xie Pinghuai was very detailed in his explanation.Xie Qiao got it now.Not many wanted to really study at the Royal Academy. Most of them were there for fame and money.There must be many imperial princes and imperial grandchildren. Those non-official families that were wealthy would naturally send their children in no matter the price they had to pay. It would be great to even butter up those people.\u201cOne can only get in with the recommendation of third-grade and above officials? I-If not, how much silver does one have to pay?\u201d Pei Wanyue suddenly asked. Her voice was rather impatient.\u2018Uncle Xie is just a fourth-grade official!\u2019Not only that, she was not his daughter by blood. She could only be listed as a commoner!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: So Much SilverXie Niushan had not thought too much about it earlier. After he snapped back to his senses, he just realized that he would need to pay 5,000 taels of silver for the shortcut to get his daughter in for fame.However, if that girl from the Pei family wanted to get in too\u2026How much would he need to pay!?Xie Niushan glared at Xie Pinghuai. \u201cHow much silver would it be?\u201d\u201cMaybe\u2026 At least 50,000 taels of silver\u2026 The academy is divided into a couple of classes. One will get into the lowest class\u2014Class D if one pays 50,000 taels,\u201d Xie Pinghuai said softly.\u201cClass D!? And it\u2019s the lowest class?!\u201d Xie Niushan almost broke his vocal cords from yelling.He scared Pei Wanyue so much that her eyes turned red immediately.\u201cIt\u2019s good enough that the commoners can get into the Royal Academy. 50,000 taels aren\u2019t considered a lot. You\u2019ll need to pay more to get into better classes! There are Class Qian, Kun, Sun, Moon, A, B, C, and D. As long as one has silver, you can be in the same class with the imperial princes.\u201d Xie Pinghuai smirked.Pei Wanyue looked terrible now.\u201cHow much silver does one need to\u2026 be in the same class as a prince?\u201d Pei Wanyue dared not imagine that.Xie Pinghuai pouted and mumbled, \u201cYou sure are daring to ask.\u201dPei Wanyue looked panicked, \u201cI-I\u2019m just curious!\u201d\u201cYou brat!\u201d Xie Niushan hit Xie Pinghuai\u2019s head, \u201cHow much? Tell me and see if it would scare me!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only one commoner in Class Qian. He came from a big clan in the south. Although his family did not contribute to anything, they\u2019re wealthy. The clan is big. I heard they spend 1,000,000 taels of silver. However, everyone in Class Qian is the cream of the crop. It wouldn\u2019t be that scary if he was in Class A, B, C, or D,\u201d said Xie Pinghuai.That shocked everyone present.1,000,000 taels of silver just to pass one\u2019s time in an academy?\u201cYou can buy the title of an official with that amount of silver.\u201d Xie Pinggang always stunned people with his words.\u201cI didn\u2019t spend so much just to become official back then, did I?\u201d Xie Niushan said.He had been pretty wealthy back in his bandit days. That was especially so after fighting the barbarians and obtaining their loot. He had some 700,000\u2013800,000 taels of silver added together!He had given the money to the imperial court while he was left with less than 30% of his fortune.After buying houses and connections with the 30% of his fortune, he had been left with nothing.\u201cHow\u2019s your title of an official the same? Instead of saying you bought it with silvers, you should say that you obtained it in exchange for the barbarians\u2019 heads,\u201d Xie Qiao said in a neutral manner.Xie Niushan nodded.What she said made sense. He had become an official depending on his courage. Those people out there who said that he paid to become an official were fools.\u201cAre you saying Yue\u2019er can\u2019t get into the Royal Academy, then?\u201d Ms. Lu was rather upset.Pei Wanyue rubbed both hands while squeezing her handkerchief.If Xie Qiao wanted to get into the academy without the examination, she would only need to pay 5,000 taels of silver. With her as a fourth-grade official\u2019s first wife\u2019s eldest daughter, even if she could not get into Class Qian, Kun, Sun, or Moon, she could definitely get into Class A, right?What about Pei Wanyue?She would need to pay 50,000 taels of silver just to get into the last class.If she wanted to go into a better class\u2026She would need at least 100,000\u2013200,000 taels of silver to do that. It was impossible that she would get the same treatment as Xie Qiao would.\u2018Mother says I\u2019ll be the Xie family\u2019s daughter by blood from now on. But\u2026 is this how one treats their daughter?\u2019Pei Wanyue lowered her head slightly.Ms. Lu suddenly thought of something and said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t the problem be solved if we change Yue\u2019er\u2019s family name and put her name into the genealogy book?\u201dXie Niushan was stunned.Xie Pinggang looked at her with confusion as well.\u201cMr. Xie, this girl will follow us from now on. When we bring her out to connect, it wouldn\u2019t be nice that people keep calling her Young Lady Pei\u2026 She doesn\u2019t look like us, and people might be talking\u2026\u201d Ms. Lu looked nervous. \u201cI thought about it on the way here\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Don\u2019t Embarrass YourselfMs. Lu\u2019s tone sounded sincere, and her eyes solicitous.Xie Niushan liked Ms. Lu.He had married three wives before. The first one\u2026That was the one that he had been in love with but was gone too soon. However, she was like a man who was crude and fierce. He had been like a foolish brother in the presence of Ms. Peng.The second one was Ms. Lin\u2026 Although she had been gentle and adorable, she was not sincere to be marrying him. She hardly smiled as well. She would ignore him even if he was to grab the stars and moon for her. She had left after giving birth to their children.He became an official later on, so it was ridiculous not to have a mistress in charge at home.In reality, it was easy for a fourth-grade general to marry an official\u2019s daughter. All he had to do was to look for a lower-level official, and he might be able to marry a wife from a reputable family!However, he had just become an official from a bandit. Who would get on board with that?Nobody thought he could do it for a long time!Given that he was famous for killing barbarians and a few children with a bad reputation, nobody was willing to be with him.None of the few blind dates that he had attended worked out.He was pissed, so he went for ladies who were not from families of officials. He had his eyes on the Lu family. Ms. Lu had a daughter from her previous marriage. She had not managed to give birth to a son, so the family separated from the dispute.The Lu family was a family of merchants, meaning they were not lacking in money. They could still afford to raise a daughter. Ms. Lu had been good the few years she returned home.Xie Niushan had the opportunity to meet her.Ms. Lu was not even 30 back then. She was considered soft-spoken and sounded gentle when she spoke. It was love at first sight for him!He did not care whether she could give birth to a son or not since he already had two sons, who were good for nothing.Since Ms. Lu had decided to be with him, it was only natural that he had to treat her well.Well\u2026She never had any requests that were over the line these years.Xie Niushan said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem to add a daughter into the genealogy book\u2014\u201dBefore he was done speaking, Xie Pinggang took the piece of meat that Xie Niushan had taken earlier, put it in Xie Qiao\u2019s bowl, and scoffed, \u201cDid you even look at the meat before shoving it into your mouth?\u201dXie Niushan was stunned. \u201cIsn\u2019t it deer meat?! What\u2019s wrong? Can\u2019t I eat that?!\u201d\u201cThere are only a few pieces. Eldest sister had been staying at the temple. She must not have been eating so well. Shouldn\u2019t you be feeding her?!\u201d If not for the fact that Xie Niushan was his father, he would have beaten him up.It was not that he could not put Pei Wanyue\u2019s name into the genealogy book.However, he had to think about it.If the Xie family did not have any daughters, it would not be an issue to directly put it into the genealogy book. However, there were two daughters.If this outsider\u2019s behavior was terrible, she would be the black sheep!Xie Niushan did not think too much about it. He watched Xie Qiao shoving the piece of deer meat into her mouth and munching it.Xie Qiao was eating, not bothering about anything else.She did not care about her father\u2019s desire to accept another daughter into the family for his wife\u2019s love. She did not have the right to care.Although she had been listening to the Xie family\u2019s matters all these years, the only matter that had something to do with the family\u2019s future that she was involved in was getting Xie Niushan to fight the barbarians and obtaining the title of an official back then.Ms. Lu was rather uneasy seeing Xie Pinggang speak, but she was unwilling to give up. She said in a testing manner, \u201cIt\u2019s better to decide this soon. Yue\u2019er is a grown-up now. She should go to the academy to learn more.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get into the Royal Academy. The other two academies wouldn\u2019t require that much money. Sister Pei is considered our family member. Given that relationship, 5,000 taels of silver should be enough,\u201d said Xie Pinggang.Pei Wanyue looked pitiful. She could no longer eat.Xie Qiao was going to the Royal Academy, but she had to go to a regular one?How big of a difference would that be?!However, she should not be saying too much since she was depending on someone else now.She secretly felt wronged.\u201cEldest sister, I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t study much back at the temple. Skip the examination, don\u2019t embarrass yourself. Get father to look for the dean these days and get him to pay directly. Just go,\u201d said Xie Pinggang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Hiding Money\u2018Embarrass myself?\u2019Xie Qiao raised her brows.It was her first time hearing such a comment since she was born.She lifted her head to look at Xie Pinggang. This dummy thought he was being caring and revealed a big brother\u2019s warm smile. It was almost hurting Xie Qiao\u2019s eyes.\u201cEldest brother, don\u2019t smile at me.\u201d Xie Qiao frowned. \u201cI\u2019m eating. I don\u2019t want to throw up.\u201dXie Pinggang was rendered speechless, and his eyelids twitched. He lifted his arm and almost hit Xie Qiao.This girl was as skinny as a bamboo stick. She was not as solid as Xie Pinghuai, so he could not bring himself to hit her, \u201cDid you eat at the temple? You\u2019re only left with skin on your cheeks. If this was the year of famine, nobody would bother to eat people like you if you ended up with the rebels. It\u2019d be a waste of their effort to do that!\u201dXie Qiao chuckled. That chuckle was rather creepy.Xie Qiao changed the subject and asked, \u201cOh yeah, apart from many wealthy people, what else is special about the Royal Academy?\u201dIf there was nothing special, she would go for something else.\u201cThere are many things.\u201d Xie Pinghuai took the initiative to speak. \u201cAlthough the other two academies have many talented people, they can\u2019t compare with the great support the Royal Academy receives. They collect many books, while the students from the other two academies always end up borrowing books from them. However, one must put some effort in order to get those books.\u201dOf course, it was not that the other two academies were lacking in books. It was just that the Royal Academy had more books than a bull\u2019s hair.When they had founded the academy, it was said that they had moved all of the books from the imperial storeroom.Xie Qiao\u2019s eyes lit up when she heard that. She said while smiling, \u201cWhich classes are the both of you in? How are you guys doing?\u201dThe both of them froze when they heard. Subsequently, one of them lowered his head while the other was in a daze.\u201cThem? What do you expect from the two knuckleheads?\u201d Xie Pinggang snorted. \u201cPinghuai broke someone\u2019s leg last month. It was me who went over to compensate them with silver.\u201dInstead of compensation, it was more of a threat.\u201cAnd this little thing,\u201d he then pointed at Xie Xi, \u201cShe\u2019s slow. Forget that she can\u2019t remember the things that the teachers taught since it\u2019s not exactly useful. She accidentally put the silver pieces in the teacher\u2019s purse. She came home and cried the entire day. It was me who asked them back for her.\u201dXie Qiao was rendered speechless, and her eyelids twitched.No, they could not be her young brother and sister.\u201cWhy did you put them in someone else\u2019s purse?\u201d Xie Qiao stared at her.Xie Xi\u2019s rather slow eyes looked pissed when that was mentioned, \u201cNobody dared to touch the teacher\u2019s purse. I placed them in the purse temporarily, but someone else took them.\u201d\u201cTemporarily? Hah!\u201d Xie Pinggang snickered from the anger.\u201cSister, if you\u2019ve nothing better to do, get a small shovel and dig around the house. You might find a silver blotch,\u201d Xie Pinggang said.Xie Qiao wanted to laugh. She thought this girl was cute.So she liked hiding money?!That was a good habit!However, it was a little silly to have forgotten the place she had hidden the money.Xie Xi held her head low. She looked panicky.\u201cHide it in my courtyard next time. I dare to guarantee that I\u2019ll definitely find it for you as long as it\u2019s in my courtyard,\u201d Xie Qiao said while smiling.Apart from calculation, she had great observation skills mainly. Nothing\u2014be it flowers, grass, or trees\u2014could escape her eyes even when the change was the slightest.Xie Xi\u2019s eyes lit up when she heard that. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course. Why don\u2019t you try hiding it next time? I won\u2019t take your silver away,\u201d Xie Qiao said.\u201cAlright!\u201d Xie Xi looked excited.If a stare could kill, Pei Wanyue\u2019s jealous eyes would have long killed the dish before her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Nothing LeftPei Wanyue could not understand. Xie Qiao had never met them, right?Why did she seem so close to them after chatting for a little bit?Pei Wanyue thought about it and seized the opportunity to speak. \u201cI lost my silver pieces when we were picking up Sister Qiao. Sister Xi\u2019er, I prepared quite a sum of silver pieces for you. It\u2019s unfortunate that I can\u2019t give them to you now\u2026\u201dXie Xi lifted her head to look at her. Her eyes were pure.\u201cYou lost money? How much did you lose?\u201d Xie Pinggang frowned.Ms. Lu had been away during that period. It was impossible to depend on his father to check the ledger, so he had been doing that.He had a rough idea of how much money the family had.When Ms. Lu had gone out, she had taken 5,000 taels of silver with her.His father and his salary were rather complicated. As officials that did not partake in bribery, after spending on food and miscellaneous things, the duo\u2019s annual income would only come up to hundreds of taels of silver.Naturally, that excluded the income from the fields they had been given, rewards, and the villages and stores they owned. They depended on those properties\u2019 income every year.The family had three villages and some ten stores. They did not run them themselves, so they were all rented.Those fortunes could not be compared with other people.His father refused to meet anyone, so he had never been given any gifts. He had started all of the stores with the little money that he was left with back then.Apart from those family properties and the items in the storeroom, the available silver at home was less than 20,000 taels in total.It seemed a lot, but Ms. Lu had taken 5,000 taels.After spending 5,000 taels for his eldest sister to get into the academy, they would only be left with 10,000 taels.10,000 taels were quite a lot, but it depended on how one utilized them.There would be money and gifts involved between officials. His father would spend 150 taels of silver while he would spend 100 taels every month they went socializing.He had a brother and sister below. Each of them got 20 tales of silver as allowance each month, excluding the expenses of brush, ink, paper, and inkstone.As the mistress, Ms. Lu would control the money at home. She had no monthly allowance in the past. However, when Xie Pinggang had checked the ledger, he had found out that Ms. Lu spent approximately 300 taels of silver each month. Among them, quite a sum was to subsidize his brother, and some were to buy clothes and accessories.Apart from that, they would have to pay for the food at home, the monthly salary for the servants, money to keep the horses, the house\u2019s expenses, clothes of four seasons, as well as feeding the Xie family\u2019s old lady, the other wives, and the other family members\u2026They would have to spend over 1,000 taels of silver in total per month. And that was the amount from being thrifty.They would usually only receive the money from the villages and stores once a year. Therefore, the 10,000 taels would have to last for a year.It seemed insufficient now.If something major happened in between\u2026For instance, having to keep Pei Wanyue and pay for her pass into the academy\u2026Xie Pinggang frowned hard as he thought.\u201cShe only lost 200 taels of silver. It was a crowded place with all sorts of people. She had never thought her purse would be gone as she walked.\u201d Ms. Lu smiled, looking calm.Xie Pinggang nodded upon hearing that.Indeed, 200 taels were not considered much.\u201cOh yeah, does Mother have any money left from your trip this time?\u201d asked Xie Pinggang.Ms. Lu was stunned and then looked away. \u201cThe mountains were high, and the journey was long. I needed to spend quite a lot along the way. It was hard to have anything left.\u201dXie Pinggang was rendered speechless once again, and his eyelids twitched.Hard to have anything left!?It was 5,000 taels, not 500 or 50 taels!She had only brought over 20 people with her during the trip. Even if everyone luxuriously ate meat and vegetables every day, one to two silver pieces should be enough.It was only a little over 100 days, so would 2,000 taels not be enough?He thought Ms. Lu should be able to save half of the money she had brought for the trip even if she was being a spendthrift!Pei Wanyue said immediately, \u201cDon\u2019t blame Mother, eldest brother. When we were in Liaozhou, Mother got me some good stuff seeing that I was dressing and eating poorly\u2026\u201dThat was right\u2014everything she was wearing was brand new, from head to toe!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: Lethal DestinyXie Pinggang was not a petty person. Upon figuring that this sister from the Pei family had lost her biological father and that life had been hard, it made sense for her mother to want to shower her with love. He said nothing more.\u201cYou\u2019ve already spent it, so don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d said Xie Pinggang. \u201cHowever, about studying, I hope Sister Pei can understand our family\u2019s situation. We really can\u2019t pay 50,000 taels of silver at once.\u201dPei Wanyue nodded sincerely, her voice as soft as a mosquito. \u201cI know.\u201dXie Niushan felt rather pitiful seeing her like that. It seemed like his family was bullying a young lady.She had come all the way here, after all. If they were unwilling to spend some money on her, would it not be humiliating if the news went out?Xie Niushan extended his head and asked, \u201cShould I borrow from someone?\u201dMs. Lu looked grateful.Xie Pinggang snorted. \u201cFather can borrow from someone else. I\u2019m just worried that you can\u2019t pay it off. If you\u2019re in debt, you won\u2019t be able to provide for the old lady and uncles.\u201dXie Niushan\u2019s impulse was put off at the moment.\u201cThen\u2026 there\u2019s nothing that I can do. Indeed, I only have this much money that\u2019s only enough to send my daughter to the Royal Academy. Young Lady Pei will have to go to another academy. I\u2019ll talk to the dean. Maybe he can settle it at 2,000\u20133,000 taels of silver,\u201d Xie Niushan said directly.Pei Wanyue almost tore the handkerchief that she had been twisting.She had lost her appetite to eat.However, she knew she could not change the current situation.In reality, Xie Qiao did not really mind which academy she was going to.However, now that she knew that there were countless books in the Royal Academy, she was secretly excited. She had no interest in imperial princes and imperial grandchildren. However, those books were priceless. She would be glad to read more.The matter was settled during the meal.Xie Qiao said she did not want them to spend money, but they insisted.She did not bother to explain. She was going to find out more about the Royal Academy when she had the time.The Xie family\u2019s men were busy, so were the two young ones\u2014they did not have time to talk more.Moreover, she had a lethal destiny.The evil energy was still in her body, while dark energy lingered. It would not affect outsiders, but she should not be too close with people of her own blood, or they would be harmed. Even though she carried many amulets with her that could almost avoid that, Xie Qiao would stay away from them to prevent anything bad from happening.Ms. Lu, Pei Wanyue, and even the servants had no idea of what happened.However, Xie Niushan and Xie Pinggang knew about it.\u201cYour application won\u2019t be approved so soon. Stay in the courtyard when you have nothing to do. Don\u2019t keep going to the front yard.\u201d As soon as Xie Niushan was done speaking, he said to the two young ones, \u201cSame to you guys. You can go to your eldest sister\u2019s courtyard to play occasionally, but not every day. Don\u2019t disturb her too much, or wait for my canning.\u201cElder daughter, go to your Mother if you encounter any problems.\u201d He waved and got rid of Xie Qiao as soon as he was done speaking.Ms. Lu could not understand Xie Niushan\u2019s attitude.She peeped at Xiao Pinghuai and saw him nodding in agreement.She was even more confused now.He did not seem like he loved Xie Qiao based on his behavior earlier.Did Xie Niushan like this daughter or not?Ms. Lu could not figure it out. To the servants, the father and brother did not like Xie Qiao at all.Not only was she arranged to live in the courtyard at the corner, but she was also asked to have little interaction with the young master and young mistress at home. They must despise her!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: 5,000 Taels of ValueXie Qiao responded in a neutral manner. She was not happy, nor was she sad.She returned to her courtyard calmly.However, Xie Niushan\u2019s attitude was soon spread to all of the servants within a blink of an eye.By then, almost everyone knew that the Xie family\u2019s First Young Lady was less loved than Young Lady Pei, who was an outsider!Pei Wanyue\u2019s courtyard was just next to the youngest lady\u2019s, and she had the madam protecting her. Clearly, she was being taken seriously!Xie Qiao rested for three days in her courtyard.She wrote two letters and sent them out during that period.She had a rough idea of the Royal Academy\u2019s situation now.As expected, there was a difference between females\u2019 and males\u2019 enrolment. It was something that was worthy of being proud of for males who were accepted. Meanwhile, if a lady got in with their good result in the examination, it would be too attention-seeking. That was why most chose to pay to get in.As the direct eldest daughter of a fourth-grade official who had been staying outside, she should better keep a low profile. After all, she only wanted to get in to read. There was no need for her to work so hard.The Royal Academy\u2019s dean was talented.The man was knowledgeable, and he was a retired Imperial Preceptor.One could not pay money to the academy directly to avoid making the place cheap. Therefore, everyone would give things that worth 5,000 taels of silver.It looked good on the surface.Of course, her father would give real silver taels. Not only that, but he would also put them right in front of the dean shamelessly.Nobody dared to chase him out because he looked ugly, stubborn, and not one to be offended.She had been in quite a rush when she came here, so she had not brought anything valuable.She could only make something herself.After thinking for a while, Xie Qiao headed out to buy some materials, ink, and paper.Pei Wanyue had been watching Xie Qiao\u2019s movements.\u201cWhy is she buying ink, brush, inkstone, and paper? Doesn\u2019t she already have those in her courtyard?\u201d Ms. Lu was stunned.\u201cThe paper that Sister Qiao bought is much more expensive than the regular paper,\u201d Pei Wanyue said, feeling gloomy.\u201cSpendthrift,\u201d Ms. Lu said casually. She suddenly thought of something as soon as she was done speaking. \u201cThat girl had never mentioned allowance since she returned\u2026\u201dWould that mean that Xie Qiao had been spending her own money to buy food and shop the past few days?There was only one granny and a maid at Xie Qiao\u2019s courtyard.There was also a small kitchen in the courtyard. Xie Qiao would get Granny Fang to buy anything she needed.Ms. Lu was a little stunned at that moment. She was considering whether to get someone to send Xie Qiao stuff. If that girl complained to her husband, she might be punished.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to see what Uncle Xie would say about this, Mother? Let\u2019s just watch. If Uncle Xie minds, he\u2019ll get someone to send her things right away,\u201d Pei Wanyue said.Ms. Lu said while frowning, \u201cWhat if he gets angry?\u201dPei Wanyue chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t think he would? It\u2019s a lot of work for you to control Xie Pinghuai and Xie Xi\u2019s food intake daily. Can\u2019t you just say that Xie Qiao goes to the storeroom to fetch things herself if she needs them?\u201dAlthough Ms. Lu thought there was the risk of being scolded, Xie Nishan had always loved her. He would not argue with her for such a matter.She happened to be able to see how much the father and son valued this girl exactly.Xie Qiao had no idea Ms. Lu was thinking so much.She felt rather in a pickle as she stared at the paper before her.What should she paint? She had to paint something that would be worth 5,000 taels of silver\u2026A landscape painting? It was nothing interesting. Moreover, she was weak. Painting a landscape would drain too much energy, so she would not paint one as she was worried about exhausting herself.Xie Qiao scanned around and saw Da Xiong flapping its wings. It seemed like it wanted to fly.Her eyes lip up.Horses aside, the commoners kept five animals\u2014cows that represented sweetness, dogs for sourness, pigs for saltiness, lambs for bitterness, and chicken for spiciness. Those gathered the taste of living.Xie Qiao thought of painting the joy of living.After coming up with the idea, Xie Qiao painted with brush and ink as if a deity was holding her hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: IlliterateXie Qiao focused all of her attention on her painting. Her face was paler now, while sweat was seeping out of her forehead.When she was done with the painting, she looked much weaker. She sighed softly and rummaged through the bamboo basket, eventually retrieving a small jade stamp.She stamped it on the ink pad. After exhaling, she stamped it on the painting as hard as she could.Xie Qiao was rather satisfied with it.Back when she had been at the Water Moon Temple, she would hardly paint. Apart from painting as practice, those that were presentable were usually small paintings.She had put in quite an effort in order to get into the Royal Academy now.In reality, it was not that she could not accept the Xie family\u2019s silver.She still had silver with her. Moreover\u2026 To be honest, if not for her lethal destiny and the dark energy in her body, Ms. Peng might not have died when she was born. Therefore, she felt rather guilty toward Xie Niushan and Xie Pinggang.If not for that, she would not avoid Ms. Lu as much as she could.As long as Ms. Lu did not cross her bottom line, she would definitely be nice to Ms. Lu.After the painting dried, Xie Qiao framed it herself.Three days later, Xie Niushan came over to bring her to the Royal Academy to become a student.Becoming a student was just the first round.Naturally, the amount of silver and one\u2019s identity were not the only qualifications the Royal Academy required to take in students. Firstly, they had to see if the person really wanted to learn. If they were paying with silver, they had to write a little bit at the academy to prove that they were not completely illiterate.That was especially for the enrolment for third-grade and below officials\u2019 daughters. The youngest one would be 10 years old.For females, although there were not many who would only enroll when they were 16 or 17, there were people like that.However, if they were still illiterate at such an age, it would be too late for the academy to teach even if they were willing.Hence, the people who came in would need to be able to read and write at least.Xie Niushan brought Xie Qiao there himself.When they departed, Pei Wanyue revealed her sadness on her face, making Xie Niushan feel pitiful.If not for the fact that the family had no money, he would have brought this lady along with a wave of his hand.\u201cYue\u2019er told me that she likes her sister along the way here. She wants to stay with Qiao\u2019er. Now that Qiao\u2019er is about to join the Royal Academy, but Yue\u2019er is going somewhere else, the sisters won\u2019t be together\u2026\u201d Ms. Lu was upset.Xie Qiao frowned lightly.\u201cShe had never said that.\u201d Xie Qiao looked serious.Ms. Lu was stunned. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cShe has never said she wants to be with me. I\u2019m unwilling to be her friend, so there\u2019s nothing that we can talk about. If Mother really wants to send Pei Wanyue to the Royal Academy, you can ask for Father\u2019s help all you want. I won\u2019t stop you, but don\u2019t drag me into this. I\u2019ve already said this to you before,\u201d said Xie Qiao.Ms. Lu felt uncomfortable upon hearing that. \u201cS-So you\u2019re looking down on Yue\u2019er? S-She\u2019s your half-sister after all\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not looking down on her. It\u2019s her who is looking down on herself.\u201d Xie Qiao smiled lightly, \u201cShe\u2019s comparing with me in everything. Why torture herself like that?\u201dXie Qiao put down the carriage\u2019s curtain as she spoke.Ms. Lu\u2019s facial expression looked gloomy as she was blocked outside.It was not that Xie Qiao had no idea about what was happening. From the first time Pei Wanyue had laid her eyes on Xie Qiao, it was as if her eyes were dyed with poison.She had done that because she imagined Xie Qiao to be ugly.Xie Niushan was shocked by his daughter\u2019s straightforward words. He frowned lightly.Ms. Lu noticed that and panicked. She said immediately, \u201cI-I sincerely want the sisters to bond. Who would\u2019ve thought that this girl would be so cold? Yue\u2019er wanted to spend time with her a few times, but she ignorantly rejected her. What can I do about that?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: ShamelessMs. Lu felt very wronged as she spoke. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like Yue\u2019er. After all, she\u2019s not your child\u2026 But I\u2019ve already said that I\u2019m willing to change her family name so that she\u2019ll be the Xie family\u2019s daughter fully. However, you didn\u2019t say anything about it. Is my daughter terrible? She\u2019s well-versed in the four arts as well. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s not as pretty as Qiao\u2019er. Nonetheless, she\u2019s outstanding compared to the people in the Imperial City!\u201dMs. Lu felt wronged.Her eyes were red.Xie Niushan liked her because she was secretly a coquettish woman.Now that she was sobbing, Xie Niushan panicked. \u201cWhy are you crying? When did I say that girl isn\u2019t good? Aren\u2019t I treating her well at home? There are many talents in the Gulan Academy. I guarantee that it can make her a talented girl in the future!\u201d\u201cWho cares if she becomes a talented girl or not? What I care about is whether you accept her as a part of the family!\u201d Ms. Lu stomped her foot and turned around to leave.She seemed sad and angry.That was Xie Niushan\u2019s weakness. If not for the fact that he had an errand to run, he would have rushed to her side by now.Xie Qiao, who was in the carriage, said, \u201cThe coachman knows the way to the Royal Academy. I can go on my own.\u201d\u201cIt was hard to marry a good wife. I spent quite an effort to marry her. Now that she\u2019s angry, won\u2019t I be at a loss?\u201d mumbled Xie Niushan.However, he got onto the carriage the next moment. He would comfort his wife when he got home after dealing with business.Indeed, Ms. Lu wanted Xie Niushan to comfort her. She had thrown tantrums privately before, and Xie Niushan would always go her way.She knew that men should not be spoiled. Throwing an appropriate tantrum was beneficial for a husband and wife.Now that Xie Niushan left, she was upset.\u201cApart from sending me to the academy, is there anything else that Father has to do today?\u201d Xie Qiao asked in the carriage.\u201cIt\u2019s my day off today. I\u2019ll only show my face at the academy. You\u2019ll have to rely on your own for the rest. After that, I\u2019ll go to the gambling den to drink.\u201d Xie Niushan suddenly asked as soon as he was done speaking, \u201cOh yeah! I haven\u2019t asked if you can read the primer?\u201dBefore Xie Qiao could reply, Xie Niushan frowned. \u201cI saw you using fancy words in the letters you wrote me in the past. They were obviously not written by a child, but I didn\u2019t check with you! Don\u2019t tell me the old Taoist master didn\u2019t teach you to read at all? At the academy, even if you can\u2019t memorize a book, you would need to be able to read!\u201dOtherwise, they would not take her in no matter how much money they could pay!\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Father. I can get by,\u201d Xie Qiao said causally.Xie Niushan felt rather guilty upon hearing her say that she could get by.\u201cPlease behave yourself. The three fools at home are well known in the Imperial City. If you do something embarrassing, I\u2019ll lose my very last shred of dignity,\u201d Xie Niushan mumbled.Although he said that, in reality, he did not have high hopes for Xie Qiao.\u201cWell known?\u201d Xie Qiao was rather surprised, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dXie Niushan said, feeling embarrassed, \u201cYour Eldest Brother already looks like that, yet he fell in love with a talented lady. He even stalked her, scaring that lady. He already couldn\u2019t find a wife, and it\u2019s completely impossible now.\u201dXie Qiao was shocked.\u2018How can it be?\u2019\u201cYour brother and sister\u2026\u201d Xie Niushan scratched his head in concern. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about them!\u201d\u201cPlease tell me slowly,\u201d Xie Qiao said immediately.Xie Niushan sighed. \u201cYour brother. Pinghuai\u2026 He\u2019s shameless. He\u2019s so young, but he went to a brothel and got thrown out. They said he\u2019s still so young, his set of teeth has yet to grow fully, yet he wanted to have sex with ladies.

    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: He\u2019s Here AgainXie Niushan was a bandit, so he would say things as it was.The coachman could not help but sympathize with Xie Qiao, who was in the carriage when he heard that.Xie Qiao had never thought Xie Pinghuai was such a terrible kid. He seemed rather sensible when they had met earlier, no?Regarding Xie Xi\u2026Xie Qiao could guess it without having Xie Niushan telling her what the girl had done.Xie Xi was slow, so she had definitely caused quite some trouble.\u201cDaughter, let\u2019s not talk about anything else. Even if you\u2019re a dimwit, as long as you don\u2019t show it, your face will be our family\u2019s reputation!\u201d Xie Niushan said in pride.Xie Qiao\u2019s eyelids twitched.Could she not carry such a burden?Xie Qiao sighed. It was not an easy task to be an official\u2019s daughter. It was definitely not as free as being a Taoist master.\u201cFather, after you\u2019re done with your errand today, speak as little as you can no matter where you go,\u201d Xie Qiao reminded out of nowhere.\u201cWhat?\u201d Xie Niushan thought he had misheard.\u201cYour cheekbones are flushing today, Father. They\u2019re bright, and you look like you\u2019re going to make a fortune. You\u2019re an official, so you shouldn\u2019t go to the gambling den. The fortune shouldn\u2019t be there, but somewhere else that you\u2019re going today. However, it\u2019s easy to have the fortune taken away. So talk less and observe more today, then fortune will come,\u201d Xie Qiao explained slowly.Xie Niushan wanted to curse.\u2018That d*mn old Taoist master! He turned my daughter into a swindler!?\u2018Listen to what she\u2019s saying! Does she sound like a lady at all?\u2019His poor daughter. If not for the fact that she had a lethal destiny, would she have been raised by that old Taoist master? If Xie Niushan was to raise her himself\u2026He was stunned and too embarrassed to continue thinking.He knew that he did not know how to raise a child. If he had to raise Xie Qiao, he might have raised a demon.\u201cDon\u2019t say things like that when you\u2019re at the academy,\u201d said Xie Niushan.\u201cSure,\u201d replied Xie Qiao. \u201cI wonder what you ate today, Father. Your mouth stinks. I could smell it when you were a meter away from me.\u201dXie Niushan immediately exhaled to check his breath upon hearing that. He could not stop sniffing.However, he did not smell anything after doing that for a while. \u201cIt\u2019s not stinky?\u201d\u201cYour breath may not stink, but it doesn\u2019t mean your body doesn\u2019t,\u201d Xie Qiao said calmly.Although Xie Niushan was not well educated, he got what she meant.He kept quiet all of a sudden.Indeed, it had been days since he last took a bath.Soon, they arrived at the Royal Academy.As soon as Xie Qiao got off the carriage, she was shocked by the academy before her.It was indeed fortunate that the academy had great support. It was shockingly huge. There were a few side gates at the academy, while the main gate would only be opened for major events.The tall walls seemed to have blocked the outside world, creating another world within. The side gates seemed pretty majestic too, and people were guarding the gates.As it was the day of the monthly registration, a couple of other families were at the side door.They got off the carriages when they arrived at the gate.Those who got off were mostly 10-year-old children. They came as soon as they hit the eligible age.Among the many of them, Xie Qiao was the only lady who was 15 or 16.She was attention-seeking.People started queuing to get in.As a parent, Xie Niushan could enter the academy, but he could only send her to the gate. He could not join the examination Xie Qiao had to sit for at the academy.\u201cWhy are you here again, Master Xie?\u201d A teacher saw Xie Niushan when they went in. His eyelids twitched.He could never forget the scene where Xie Niushan carried 10,000 taels of silver to send his two children to the academy!People sent items as the custom to become a student. Even if one were to give silver, they would give silver notes!It was a different case for Xie Niushan. He had brought taels of silver directly. He had even made a fuss that he was buying the qualification to send his children in!If this lady that he brought qualified, would that not mean\u2026The teacher\u2019s facial expression suddenly changed.Would he relive the scene of Xie Niushan bringing taels of silver!?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Judging A Book By Its CoverThe teacher was responsible for recruiting students. He looked terrible when he saw Xie Niushan. The rest could not help but look at Xie Niushan.Someone could not help but mumble softly, \u201cSo that\u2019s Master Bandit?\u201d\u201cIt was him who carried the silver taels to the dean\u2019s house\u2026\u201d Some students who passed by even teased him.\u201cI heard that his daughter and son could not really read. They weren\u2019t qualified to get in, and they were almost chased out. Never had they thought this Master Xie would make noise and look for the dean directly. He said the dean looked down on him. The dean is a man of reason. However, what could he say when he met such a bandit? He could only accept his children,\u201d someone told the whole story in detail.Xie Qiao heard that too.She turned her head and peeped at Xie Niushan in confusion.Xie Niushan\u2019s cheeks flushed, \u201cWhat nonsense! I\u2019m a fourth-grade official. My two good-for-nothin\u2014 Children aren\u2019t illiterate. They just can\u2019t read very well. I\u2019ve already paid, why couldn\u2019t he accept them? It was that old man who was unreasonable!\u201dXie Qiao sighed.It was good enough that her brother and sister behaved how they were behaving when they had such a father.At present, the teacher was glaring at them.\u201cMaster Xie, the academy is a land of peace. We\u2019ll have to ask you to leave if you keep cursing here,\u201d the teacher said.\u201cDid I curse? I didn\u2019t! I\u2019ve always been talking like this. The dean knows it,\u201d Xie Niushan denied.Fortunately, Xie Qiao was thick-skinned.If it was some other ladies, they would have buried themselves in a hole.\u201cMaster Xie, are you here to send this lady to the academy?\u201d The teacher did not want to argue with a crude man like him.He knew he could not argue with such a man.\u201cOf course. There\u2019s no one else standing next to me apart from her. Are you blind\u2014\u201d Xie Niushan wanted to curse by instinct. However, he held back.He despised long-winded, educated people. It was irritating that they judged a book by its cover!\u201cMaster Xie, according to the rules, we don\u2019t take in adopted daughters and clan members.\u201dOnly third-grade officials could recommend children who were not related!\u201cThis is my eldest daughter!\u201d Xie Niushan snorted.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of her\u2026 Is she an official daughter? If that\u2019s the case, the value of the gift would be a fold higher,\u201d the teacher said.They would not talk money with others directly, but they were facing Xie Niushan. It would be more straightforward to be talking money with him.\u201cUnofficial daughter? She\u2019s my direct eldest daughter! She was ill back then, so she was raised outside. I\u2019ve only got her back recently!\u201d Xie Niushan was pissed, seemingly blaming the teacher for being blind.The teacher was shocked to hear that.His daughter by blood, and she was his direct eldest daughter at that?They looked\u2026 very different!However, nobody could fake such a thing indeed. The Royal Academy had great support. If Xie Niushan dared to get someone to disguise as his direct eldest daughter, he would definitely be demoted. It was not worth it.\u201cIt\u2019s alright since she\u2019s your eldest daughter. Please queue here, Young Lady Xie. Please stay outside, Master Xie,\u201d the teacher said.Xie Niushan looked at Xie Qiao with slight concern.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, just skip those that you can\u2019t read. Your sister got in by doing that,\u201d Xie Niushan reminded before leaving.\u201cSure,\u201d Xie Qiao said shamelessly.One could not be too smart when they talked to Xie Niushan.He might think that she was insane if she was to tell him not to worry and that she was confident.It made sense. Her father had a clear estimation of himself. Naturally, he would not believe that he gave birth to a smart daughter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were not here to study!Such people would smudge the academy\u2019s reputation if they were accepted!The teacher looked serious and rather pissed.The entry examination was not difficult at all. Anyone could pass as long as they were not dumb. The teacher was grim when he looked at Xie Niushan at the moment.As soon as Xie Niushan left, Xie Qiao felt the coldness the teacher was exuding.\u201cThe Royal Academy isn\u2019t like any other academy. Anyone who comes here, even the imperial princes and imperial grandchildren, will have to follow the rules. One will have to take studying as their responsibility. Those who are insincere, attempting to use the Royal Academy\u2019s fame to get themselves a marriage should scram right now!\u201d the teacher said coldly.Although he did not look in Xie Qiao\u2019s direction when he spoke, almost anyone who heard that stared at Xie Qiao intentionally.Xie Qiao felt rather troubled.She was being despised before she was even accepted into the academy?Her biological father\u2026They must have been enemies in their past life, right? It must be the reason why he did that to her.Xie Qiao had survived living with Mo Lingzi, the unreliable Taoist master. She had seen it all. Thus, she did not panic at the moment.She pretended not to see those stares, held her head down, and waited slowly. She seemed like she was not paying attention.However, in the teacher\u2019s eyes, he thought this lady was stubborn. She was a person who would not listen to anything that was good for her.He was even more pissed now.\u201cApart from identity and wealth, in order to enter the Royal Academy, all of you will need to have sufficient capabilities. Alright, everyone will sit for a simple examination now,\u201d the teacher said loudly.All of the people who applied went into a classroom.The classroom was spacious with big windows in four directions. All of them were opened. It was breezy when they went in, which was different from the warm courtyard.Each of them got themselves a seat at the tables.There were only a total of eight people who applied this time.Xie Qiao was the oldest, while the rest were little girls of only 10 years old.Some were shy, while some were very active.Soon, a schoolboy gave everyone a few pieces of paper.\u201cAll of you come from notable families, so it\u2019s much easier for you to enter the academy. However, you should know the basics. You\u2019ll be given two hours now to memorize the article before you. When the time is up, you\u2019ll have to dictate it,\u201d the teacher said.Since he was responsible for recruitment, he was naturally not a commoner but someone who had contributed to the country.Even if he was to change the rule last minute, nobody would say anything.As soon as he was done speaking, the girls began grumbling.Many students were leaning on the windows outside to peep.\u201cThat Ms. Xie must be the one who dragged everyone down? It\u2019s not difficult to memorize an article within two hours. However, it\u2019s rather difficult to get them to dictate the article,\u201d someone out there gloated.The article was three papers long.Xie Qiao had three pieces of paper in her hands too, but\u2026It was written in Sanskrit.Taoism and Buddhism conflicted each other. Naturally, she had to know about the other religion as well. Moreover, her body had been weak since young. She would read when she had nothing to do. Therefore, about Sanskrit\u2026She knew a little bit.Although she knew a little bit, the teacher was clearly targeting her.Xie Qiao lifted her eyes and asked softly, \u201cYou want me to dictate Sanskrit, sir? Is this the rule to get into the academy?\u201dThe teacher looked rather uneasy, but he still said, \u201cSanskrit is mostly used in scriptures. Copying the scriptures, as well as paying respects to your seniors, can calm one down. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the examination.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Please Forgive MeXie Qiao frowned lightly.\u201cI can accept the test question that you gave, sir. However, I\u2019d like to ask if someone else had been tested with this question in the past, or is it only targeting me now?\u201d Xie Qiao proceeded, \u201cI hate conspiracies. You\u2019re a well-educated man, sir. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re ethical. So, regarding this test question that\u2019s beyond measure, are you representing the academy or yourself?\u201dShe could do the test question, but she could not be bullied.The teacher said straightforwardly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference if it came from the academy or me?! If you don\u2019t want to do it, then please leave!\u201dXie Qiao merely smiled lightly.Xie Qiao said slowly, \u201cI\u2019m a fourth-grade official\u2019s eldest daughter. I\u2019m not adopted, nor am I in disguise. There\u2019s an unspoken rule about the academy that the entry exemption would only be reading and writing. How come it has changed when it comes to me? Is the academy\u2026 judgmental?\u201dThe teacher was flushing with anger.\u201cYou\u2019re the only person that I gave this test question to. Ms. Xie is 15 or 16, right? It\u2019s rather late to be enrolling in the academy this late. You\u2019ll have less time to study in the academy. Therefore, the enrollment requirement is higher, or it\u2019ll be hard for you to pick up the pace!\u201d said the teacher.\u201cSo it seems the ladies in the academy who are of the same age as me are familiar with this Sanskrit article, then?\u201d Xie Qiao asked while smiling.The teacher was taken aback.Naturally, the answer was no.It was him who had written the Sanskrit article. He thought he wanted to copy the scriptures to give them to the elderly at home.Since he had encountered this bandit father and daughter, he used it intentionally to trouble this girl!Never had he thought this girl was quite difficult to deal with!\u201cYou\u2019re talking so much, are you doing the test question or not!?\u201d snarled the teacher.\u201cI only want you to admit that you\u2019re being unfair and troubling me intentionally. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll look for the dean,\u201d Xie Qiao said directly.The teacher\u2019s cheeks were flushing from the anger.\u201cYour father said that you lived outside since you were young. I noticed that you\u2019re rude, so I gave you this bit of trouble. Why can\u2019t I do that?\u201d The teacher was straightforward as well.He came from a big clan. He had no interest in being an official, so he became a teacher at the Royal Academy after passing the imperial examination.It had been his shift when Xie Niushan had brought his children for enrollment the last time.It was his shift this time as well.Why did he have such bad luck?!\u201cAlright, it\u2019s great that you admit it, sir. I can do this test question. Don\u2019t forget to apologize to me for being biased, or you\u2019re a cowardly, lecherous man,\u201d Xie Qiao held her head down and read the papers in her hands.Lecherous!?Xu Mian\u2019s heartbeat stopped for a second upon hearing that.He was 37 this year.He was charismatic with an elegant demeanor. Although he was married and had children, numerous ladies wanted to be his concubines. Many complimented on the poems and paintings he created out there. However, Ms. Xie was calling him\u2026 lecherous?He was annoyed, but this Ms. Xie was reading the test question obediently at the moment.He should not be stirring trouble with her!Many students out there were laughing at the show until Xu Mian harrumphed. \u201cGo back to class! Or I\u2019ll lower your grade!\u201dThe students out there buried their heads, but they remained standing out there.Xu Mian glanced at Xie Qiao, guilt flashing inside of him.\u2018Can it be that this girl\u2026 is well-versed in Sanskrit?\u2019\u2018That cannot be, right?\u2019This Sanskrit article was difficult. Even he had to study for a long time to understand everything written.That was right. The beginning was not too difficult. This girl had only read a little bit. Perhaps she thought it was a passage that she had read before, that was why she looked so confident!She would admit her mistake obediently when she flipped to the next page and ask for his forgiveness!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was feeling fine after memorizing for a while.Moreover, there was a great benefit at this academy.There were many ladies in here, so the Yang energy was ample. She did not feel as uncomfortable as she was out there.Mr. Xu sat in front while waiting patiently. He was waiting for Xie Qiao to look troubled and tell him that she could not do it.However, an hour had passed as he waited and stared. The young lady had yet to get up, so he was rather confused.\u2018Can it be that this girl is going to wing it?\u2019Xie Qiao stood up as he was thinking to himself.Mr. Xu was secretly glad and lifted his head lightly, \u201cWhy? You can\u2019t memorize it? It\u2019s time you learn that you should be humble and gentle since you\u2019re the daughter of an official. You can\u2019t be barbaric like bandits!\u201dXie Qiao looked at him in a surprised manner. \u201cSir, to be saying all this\u2026 Aren\u2019t you even more unreasonable than bandits?\u201dMr. Xu was stunned.\u2018Does she want to pass the examination or not!?\u2019\u201cI\u2019m done memorizing, and I don\u2019t want to waste any more time. I\u2019m passing up the question paper so that I can dictate it, right?\u201d Xie Qiao said again.\u201cYou\u2019re done memorizing!?\u201d Mr. Xu was shocked, \u201cImpossible!\u201dXie Qiao put down the papers directly, walked back to her seat, and ignored him.It would be tiring to talk more to him.It was so much better at the temple; it was quiet. If she did not feel like talking, nobody would force her to talk. Her master would even chase out everyone who disturbed her peace!It was a day to miss her life back at the temple.Xie Qiao sighed while writing.Her movement was at a neutral pace, pleasing to watch.There were men and ladies among the students who were watching out there.Most classes separated men and ladies in the academy. Apart from certain classes, they would have to keep their distance at other times.Naturally, even when they gathered, there would definitely be someone around watching.Most of them who came to the academy were sensible. They dared not mess with the rule of having a relationship.It was said that a talented, educated man liked a young lady, and they dated secretly in the academy. When they were caught, the dean was furious. The emperor ruled to put that young lady and the educated man together. They were fed poisoned wine, and they died together!Killing the chickens to scare the monkeys. Nothing like this would ever happen again.Even if one fell in love in the academy, they definitely would not dare to do something so shameless.Therefore, even though they were gathered and laughing together now, the teachers would not really care as long as they maintained their distance.Xu Mian thought it was odd as he watched Xie Qiao writing from one stroke to another.He thought about it and walked over.He looked at what she wrote when he arrived at her seat\u2026Her handwriting was not nice, nor was it too bad. One could tell that she had practiced before, and it was considered to be passable.However, Xie Qiao was sighing.It was rather tiring to be writing strokes for her. It would be better if she could write cursive instead.However, the cursive script was too over the top and attention-seeking. She would only practice it privately.One must be low profile.The handwriting aside, Xu Mian began to check the content.The more he read\u2026The more shocked he was.\u2018Nothing! She didn\u2019t miss a single word!?\u2019\u201cH-Have you read this Sanskrit article before?!\u201d Mr. Xu asked instinctively.What else could it be? How could a 15-year-old young lady be familiar with Sanskrit? That did not make sense!Xie Qiao smiled and responded casually, \u201cYes, I used to memorize some.\u201d\u201cWhy did a young lady memorize such a thing?\u201d Mr. Xu was confused at the moment.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say it yourself, sir? Sanskrit is mostly used in scriptures. Copying the scriptures as well as paying respects to your seniors, can calm one down,\u201d Xie Qiao replied with what he had told her earlier, with a facial expression not sure if she was smiling.Mr. Xu\u2019s cheeks flushed.This young lady\u2026 was mean with her words. She used his own words against him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had been intentionally troubling her. Now that this Young Lady Xie could dictate the Sanskrit article, he could only let her pass following the rule.Even if this young lady happened to be able to dictate this Sanskrit article, it was because of her capability.Mr. Xu was struggling inside.A moment later, he said with a stiff facial expression, \u201cNot bad. You\u2019re slightly better than your brother and sister.\u201dXie Qiao held her head down quietly upon hearing that.Soon, he heard her speaking slowly like flowing water, \u201cYou\u2019re the teacher. Is there anything that I can say if you\u2019re biased against my family? Since I\u2019m the one who\u2019s enrolling, I can only hold back and swallow my dignity of being wronged by you, sir. However, just tell me if you\u2019re upset with me. Don\u2019t bully my brother and sister. They\u2019re still young\u2026\u201dXie Qiao held her head down while speaking. She was playing with the brush in her hand and seemed to be pitiful.Given her identity, she should not be fighting with the teacher.The teacher held a higher position than she did, so she could not fight him.Since this teacher was bullying the weak, she showed her weakness for him to bully her so that he could knock himself out.Xu Mian was stunned by what Xie Qiao said.Before he could react, someone was speaking outside the window.\u201cMr. Xu, you\u2019re too much. Even we aren\u2019t familiar with Sanskrit. You used that to test her, so aren\u2019t you obstructing her from getting in intentionally?!\u201d\u201cThis Young Lady Xie is Xie Pinghuai and Xie Xi\u2019s sister. There\u2019s a reason why Mr. Xu did this!\u201d Naturally, some people did not like Xie Qiao as well.\u201cXie Pinghuai is Xie Pinghuai. What does he have to do with his sister? Also, Xie Pinghuai didn\u2019t do anything bad, right?!\u201d A student fought back.\u201cTheir identity alone is a mistake! They\u2019re born bandits. How good can they be?\u201d\u201cYes, Master Xie was a bandit, but the imperial court has recruited him now, and he\u2019s been law-abiding these years. Moreover, it was Master Xie who fought the barbarians with the army back then. Where do you think this peace we\u2019re enjoying comes from!?\u201d\u201cBandits are bandits. They fought the barbarians for their own benefits! They did that so that they could become officials!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s mainly because Xie Pinghuai and Xie Xi lack talent and morality. They embarrass our Royal Academy!\u201d\u201cWhat does their embarrassment have anything to do with the Xie family\u2019s eldest lady? Didn\u2019t you guys hear? She had been living outside! She\u2019s only coming to the academy when she\u2019s already so old. Isn\u2019t she innocent?\u201d\u2026At that moment, the people outside started fighting.There were approximately 20 students who were currently watching. They were separated into two different camps now!Xie Qiao did not hear anything else, where \u2018she\u2019s already so old\u2019 had been echoing in her head\u2026If she remembered correctly, her birthday was in mid-July. She had even made herself a bowl of longevity noodles along the way to the capital. She had just turned 16 now.Xie Qiao sighed softly.Life was better at the temple. Her master would say that she was too young in order to drink more wine himself.Xu Mian\u2019s facial expression changed drastically. \u201cStop fighting. What nonsense is this!?\u201d\u201cSir, we\u2019re fighting for you! This Master Xie has been bullying our academy over and over again. You did the right thing!\u201d snarled a student.\u201cBully? Our academy accepts gifts, it\u2019s a known fact. How did Master Xie bully us? Didn\u2019t you guys\u2019 gift\u2019 valuable items to get in here as well?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re humiliating the academy!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re just saying as it is!\u201dXu Mian instantly realized what he did wrong as he watched these people fighting furiously.When the Xie family had sent their son and daughter to the academy two years ago, Xu Mian had been pissed that they carried the silvers to the dean. Back then, the dean had merely said four words while smiling; \u201cEducation is for everyone.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter how the Xie family\u2019s children were, they would receive a good and fair education as long as they could get in.Xu Mian had totally forgotten about that!He looked at Xie Qiao again\u2026Her head laid low; nobody knew what she was thinking about.If one was to look at her as her own person instead of Xie Niushan\u2019s daughter, she was an extraordinarily outstanding young lady.She was beautiful, and her manner was considered presentable and proper. If he was to think about it carefully, he had indeed been blinded by what happened in the past.Upon seeing that the students outside were fighting because of his behavior, Xu Mian was secretly guilty.\u201cMs. Xie, you\u2019ve passed the examination. It was my fault.\u201d Xu Mian was straightforward to bow and apologize to Xie Qiao.Xie Qiao was thinking about something else. She was surprised by this apology that came out of nowhere.The teachers here\u2026 Sure were fast to change.Xie Qiao got up immediately and bowed as well. \u201cThis is too much, sir.\u201dShe could not help but feel wobbly when she stood up to bow all of a sudden.Fortunately, she managed to stand still, or she would have embarrassed herself.Mr. Xu could not help but frown when he saw that, \u201cYoung Lady Xie, your body seems to be weak?\u201d\u201cThanks for your concern, sir. I\u2019m just a little weak. It\u2019s nothing major,\u201d said Xie Qiao.She would take care of her insignificant life herself.It would be inappropriate for Mr. Xu to say anything more.He thought the students out there would calm down a little since he had already apologized to Xie Qiao.However, when he turned his head, they were still fighting?His facial expression turned strange immediately.He glanced at Xie Qiao, hoping this young lady could stop them. After all, they were fighting because of this Young Lady Xie.However, Xie Qiao smiled lightly at him and then said, \u201cSince the entry examination has ended, I can come here tomorrow, right?\u201dEverything would be smooth sailing when she brought the fee as she enrolled herself tomorrow.Xu Mian was stunned. \u201cT-the students out there\u2026\u201d\u201cFarewell.\u201d Xie Qiao got up, smiled lightly, and subsequently left.It would be inappropriate for Xu Mian to ask her to stay.Xie Qiao brought nothing for her trip this time.Her father had left, but the maid and the coachman were waiting out there.Xie Qiao left directly, so she had no idea that she became popular in the academy.\u201cXie Pinghuai, what has your sister, Xie Qiao, been reading?\u201d Xie Pinghuai had a note pasted on his face while he stared at a cricket container on the table. Two crickets were fighting inside.Xie Pinghuai did not even lift his head when he heard that. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about your sister! She dictated a Sanskrit article Mr. Xu gave. Everyone is guessing whether she\u2019s literate or not!\u201d said that student.Nobody thought Xie Qiao was really familiar with Sanskrit. They thought she had just happened to memorize that article before.However, it was Sanskrit. Nobody would know if she read such serious books before.Therefore, since Xie Qiao had left, someone said it was merely sheer luck for her. If it was not for Mr. Xu, who had tested her on Sanskrit, she might not even have passed the entry examination.Of course, some thought that she was familiar with Sanskrit. Even if she was not talented, she was definitely not as terrible as the rest said.If Xie Qiao had grown up in the Imperial City, they could ask around about her.However, this young lady had only come from somewhere else a few days ago. Nobody knew how she was before!Xie Pinghuai turned his head doubtfully. \u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not your sister by blood?\u201d The crowd was rather surprised.\u201cShe is? Eldest sister from a direct family member.\u201d Xie Pinghuai had little reaction. \u201cWhy are you guys being so dramatic?\u201d\u201cYou guys don\u2019t look alike at all. We heard that your sister is pretty, even prettier than Young Lady Chu. We\u2019re just wondering how she is academically!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t know anything about my sister! She was raised at a Taoist temple from a young age.\u201d\u201cTaoist temple? All the time in the past?\u201d Everyone was surprised to hear that.That was not right. How come a person from a Taoist temple knew about Buddhism?\u201cThat\u2019s right. Father said that his fate is terrible. My sister is weak, so he would harm her if she was raised at home. Someone took her away as soon as she was born. I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s educated or not. However, the Taoist temple that my sister stayed in was quite remote. I suppose she only knows a few words,\u201d Xie Pinghuai said casually.\u201cThat\u2019s such a pity\u2026 It\u2019s wasted that she\u2019s so beautiful.\u201dThe crowd could not help but feel stunned.She must be a pretty face, then.\u201cOh yeah, is your father\u2026 going to send silvers tomorrow?\u201d asked someone.\u201cYes, I think so? Why?\u201d Xie Pinghuai asked in confusion.Everyone stared at him in a strange way.They said nothing more.Xie Pinghuai scoffed and ignored them.\u2018Something is wrong with these people. They usually ignore me. Not sure what happened to them today that they came to talk to me, interrupting my fun.\u2019The crowd had no idea what to comment about this Xie family.They were dumb.Could they not tell that many teachers were upset about them giving silvers? They were stubborn to change!Xie Pinghuai held a green foxtail in his hand and proceeded to play with the crickets. Soon, one of the crickets was defeated. He pasted a note on his left cheek and mumbled, \u201cAgain, again.\u201dXie Qiao returned home on the carriage herself.Xie Niushan came home in the evening and called her over.He looked happy.When he saw Xie Qiao, he said, \u201cI heard you passed the entry examination? So we\u2019re qualified to send the gift now?\u201dXie Qiao\u2019s eyelids twitched before she nodded lightly.\u201cNot bad, not bad. You\u2019re my child, alright!\u201d Xie Niushan was over the moon and took out a 50-tael silver note. \u201cI was lucky today to be rewarded by an official! Take this money, spend it however you want!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were going to the gambling den today, Master?\u201d Ms. Lu asked immediately when she heard that.\u201cI went to the gambling den, but I was just watching and drinking with some colleagues. They were commenting on the imperial meeting the few scholars were arguing about. I was stinky today, so I didn\u2019t dare to speak. Never had we thought an official had sneaked out of the imperial palace today and heard everything they said. He rewarded me, saying that I\u2019m stable and mature. He heard that my family\u2019s condition is pretty poor, so he rewarded me with the fortune.\u201d Xie Niushan was high on cloud nine.Xie Qiao\u2019s eyelids twitched.Stable and mature?Why was he proud about something that he was not?\u201cYou didn\u2019t share the fortune with your colleagues?\u201d Xie Qiao asked casually.\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Xie Niushan was stunned.\u201cYou guys were together, and everyone was speaking the truth. You were the only one who was being odd and said nothing. What if they think you already knew that someone would come? If I were you, I would give the gift away. It\u2019d be best you explain yourself, or people might not want to hang out with you again,\u201d Xie Qiao said in a neutral manner.The reward from the official should be quite a sum. There was no need for him to give away the entire reward.A small portion would do.Moreover, those close with him would naturally celebrate with a gift if they knew he was rewarded. That would be another income for him.Xie Niushan reacted immediately upon hearing what Xie Qiao said, \u201cIt\u2026 makes sense.\u201dXie Niushan turned his head and saw Ms. Lu frowning. He said to her immediately, \u201cMadam, what are you doing? Aren\u2019t you preparing the gifts for me?\u201dIt was Ms. Lu who was in charge of the money now, so who else would he look for if not her?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you explain with a gift, aren\u2019t you telling them that you didn\u2019t participate not because you\u2019re mature and stable\u2026\u201d\u201cThat makes sense\u2026\u201d Xie Niushan nodded.Both of them made sense.However, if he did not give the gift, nobody would be willing to hang out with him in the future, right?Xie Niushan frowned. The frown between his brows could kill a fly.\u201cYou left the darkness and went into the light back then, Father. The officials are already aware of your character and your etiquette. That official might not be sincere to compliment you for being stable today. Instead, he might be using you to tell the rest that an official of the imperial palace should not be too frivolous. Give the gift sincerely and tell them the truth. It\u2019s impossible that the officials would blame you. They might think that you\u2019re an honest man instead,\u201d Xie Qiao reminded him again.She sighed after she was done speaking. She was exhausted.If that was not her father, she might not have bothered to say anything.Was it easy to be an official who used to be a bandit?He was the one and only in the world, so how could his superiors not understand his situation?\u201cThat\u2019s right, the officials know very well of my temperament. I should give the gift, or nobody will want to talk to me any longer!\u201dCompared to the superiors, his colleagues were more important.He was a general, and those were the military officers that he had been hanging out with today. They were close. If he was being boycotted, it would be inconvenient for him to train the soldiers in the future.\u201cMadam, prepare the gifts. I\u2019ll send them out tomorrow. Also, prepare the silvers for the eldest daughter to pay the academy tomorrow!\u201d said Xie Niushan.Ms. Lu looked troubled. \u201cThe household\u2019s financial situation is tight\u2014\u201d\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t torture our children no matter how poor we are. Our eldest daughter had been staying at the temple. If people find out, they will look down on her. I\u2019ll bring the silvers there tomorrow myself to show that our Xie family is well-off!\u201d Xie Niushan said majestically.To him, sending the silvers himself was the highest respect to the academy!Xie Qiao\u2019s eyelids twitched. \u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019ve already prepared a gift. So forget about the silvers, Father.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of gift would you even have?\u201d Xie Niushan frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s the kind of jade sculpture that you gave Pinghuai earlier? Who would want a piece of rock?\u201dXie Qiao thought it was fortunate that she had a lethal destiny and subsequently could not spend extensive time with her family members.Otherwise, she would be so angry at her father that she would die sooner or later.\u201cI happened to obtain a painting earlier. It happens to be a proper gift for the Royal Academy,\u201d said Xie Qiao.\u201cPainting? Show me,\u201d Xie Niushan said immediately.He said that despite the fact that he could not admire art.Xie Qiao exhaled and got Chun Er to bring the painting from her courtyard.Ms. Lu and Pei Wanyue had gathered since the beginning. They extended their heads to look.\u201cWhose painting is this? It\u2019s just some livestock and people. Why would the academy want this?\u201d Xie Niushan could not understand that.\u201cMother, that\u2019s Master Yun Wei\u2019s stamp!\u201d Pei Wanyue raised her brows. \u201cCan it be\u2026 forgery?\u201dMs. Lu\u2019s eyes lit up and asked while looking at Pei Wanyue, \u201cMaster Yun Wei? If this painting is authentic, how much silver would it cost?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really know art, but if I\u2019m judging by the master\u2019s title and the size of the painting\u2026 It should be able to be sold for about 5,000 taels of silvers,\u201d said Pei Wanyue.However, how did such an expensive painting end up with Xie Qiao?Master Yun Wei had limited paintings, while most of the paintings sold on the market were small.Xie Qiao did not allow them to look further as she put away the painting casually. Xie Niushan was too clumsy. If he damaged her painting by accident, she would have to spend a great effort to paint it all over again.\u201cWhat are you trying to do? Give a forged painting? That old man might find out! That\u2019s too risky. I think we should just give the silvers directly.\u201d Although Xie Niushan wanted to save money, this matter involved his eldest daughter. He should not be cheap about it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Where did you get it from?\u201d Xie Niushan did not believe that at all.He had heard of Master Yun Wei\u2019s name, but he did not know him. Thus, he had little understanding of this master.It had been so long since he had come to the Imperial City. He had learned a lot. The items that came from those who were called \u2018master\u2019 and \u2018nobility\u2019 would usually cost a lot of silver!Moreover, silver was not the most important thing. One might not obtain a master\u2019s creation with silver!It was not that Xie Niushan did not believe in his own daughter, but he did not believe in himself. Based on his behavior, his children would not do anything great in life.Xie Qiao exhaled. She was not going to say that it was her who had painted it.Otherwise, the paintings might not sell in the future. After all, to the rest, Yun Wei was an old man who was dying. The old man was near the end of his life, so the price of his masterpieces would be much higher now. However, if people knew that it was a young lady who painted the paintings\u2026The price would definitely drop significantly.\u201cI bought it from a bookstore in Yunjin.\u201d Xie Qiao gave an excuse casually.\u201cYou bought it? How much did you buy it for?\u201d Xie Niushan asked immediately.\u201cNot much.\u201dShe did not have to spend anything on it.Ms. Lu could not help but secretly snicker.The master\u2019s creation was not a rock in a jade mine. One could not just pick up something casually and find something valuable.\u2018How dumb is this girl?\u2019However, Pei Wanyue secretly pulled Ms. Lu\u2019s sleeve.Ms. Lu looked at her in confusion, and Pei Wanyue said, \u201cThis painting that Sister Qiao got might be authentic! Father, you might not know this, but Sister Qiao is loved in Yunjin. I heard that many people would give her things whenever she returned. It\u2019s impossible that people would sell Sister Qiao something fake. Moreover, I heard that Master Yun Wei is from\u2026 Yunjin? There may be more authentic paintings over there.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Xie Niushan was stunned.He had no idea where Master Yun Wei was from.Ms. Lu understood now.Whether it was authentic or not, this thing was definitely good, even if she did not have to pay!\u201cSince Qiao\u2019er is giving this away, it\u2019s definitely authentic,\u201d Ms. Lu said.Xie Niushan hesitated for a moment. \u201cEldest daughter, are you sure this thing is authentic? The people at the Royal Academy are picky. If this is fake, they\u2019ll say something hurtful. Your skin is thin, so I\u2019m worried that you can\u2019t take it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Father. It\u2019s authentic,\u201d Xie Qiao was serious.In reality, Xie Niushan was still not convinced. However, since Xie Qiao spoke so seriously, he gave it a good thought.He could not help but recall what she had said to her out there today.She had said that there was fortune coming his way today.It was proven that his eldest daughter was right.This girl was not a person who would spew nonsense. Since she had said that this thing was authentic with such confidence, perhaps\u2026 she was being truthful?\u201cAlthough we don\u2019t have much silver compared to other families, we can\u2019t be stingy with the silver that we\u2019re giving the academy to send you in. You don\u2019t have to be cheap for me, alright?\u201d Xie Niushan said again.Even Xie Niushan could not help but feel touched when he said that. Although he did not raise this child himself, she loved her father!See, she was unwilling to use his money!Xie Niushan looked over with grateful eyes, which gave Xie Qiao goosebumps all over her body.He turned his head to look at Ms. Lu\u2019s unwilling face. She could not help but frown again.\u201cHow can I not want your silver, Father? I have nothing with me. I\u2019ll use these 5,000 taels of silvers for something else,\u201d Xie Qiao said.Before Xie Niushan was done feeling touched, he heard that from his daughter\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He did not think too much about it.He was going to give Xie Qiao those taels of silvers anyway. Moreover, she was his direct eldest daughter. She was 16 now, so it did not make sense not to have any silvers with her.Although 5,000 taels of silver were quite a lot, she had just arrived in the Imperial City. There would not be much left after buying some clothes and accessories.\u201cSure, take it!\u201d Xie Niushan spoke proudly as if he was wealthy.Ms. Lu felt like a piece of her flesh was being taken away!Xie Niushan had been drinking earlier, so he felt a little tired after chatting a little bit, \u201cYou girls talk, I\u2019ll rest.\u201dMs. Lu\u2019s unwillingness was getting more obvious as soon as Xie Niushan left.\u201cQiao\u2019er, you\u2019re taking so many taels of silver when you don\u2019t have to pay for the gift\u2026 What are you going to use them for?\u201d asked Ms. Lu.Xie Qiao\u2019s tone was calm as she smilingly said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to care, Mother,\u201dMs. Lu said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I care. It\u2019s just that this amount is considerable. Look, our family isn\u2019t doing well. Your sister is going to the academy as well. We should save whatever we can, right?\u201dXie Qiao was not angry upon hearing that.She had spent years at the Taoist temple and experienced the warmth of humans\u2019 kindness, as well as how selfish one could be.Xie Qiao said slowly, \u201cI\u2019m calling you Mother to be nice and out of respect. However, please remember this. I\u2019m the Xie family\u2019s eldest lady. I can refuse the money, but nobody can plot against me and take it away from me. Do you understand?\u201dHer voice was not exactly cold, but it gave out a sense of heartlessness.\u201cWho is taking your money from you!?\u201d Ms. Lu was angry.\u201cIt\u2019s hurtful to say some things too clearly. Your dignity is precious, Mother. Please savor it,\u201d Xie Qiao revealed a seemingly smiling expression. She turned around to leave with her painting as soon as she was done speaking.She was so straightforward that Ms. Lu failed to react.Ever since Ms. Lu had met Xie Qiao, the latter had been\u2026 pretty nice to her. She would call her \u2018Mother\u2019 whenever they met, and she would bow when she had to. She had not even complained to Xie Niushan that Ms. Lu had lost her jade.However, her straightforwardness that came out of nowhere shocked Ms. Lu!If she was speaking from her heart, she would definitely not treat Xie Qiao like this if she did not bring her daughter along at the same time\u2026Ms. Lu had a complicated feeling. She turned her head to glance at Pei Wanyue and felt a little sorry for her.Her daughter had been living a poor life before. She was by her side now, but she had to watch someone else calling her \u2018Mother\u2019. It made sense that Pei Wanyue felt hurt inside.\u201cAh, we\u2019re not even sure if she\u2019s Master\u2019s biological daughter.\u201d Ms. Lu sighed and held Pei Wanyue\u2019s hands. \u201cBut you, you\u2019re my darling!\u201dPei Wanyue was stunned. She then held her head slightly low.When Xie Qiao returned to her courtyard, she found out that it remained the same as before. Nothing had changed.\u201cNobody came to dig the well today?\u201d Xie Qiao asked.Granny Wan sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I waited all day here. I realized that nobody was coming in the afternoon, so I urged them again. The management said that the person who is capable of digging the well happened to take a work leave today, so we need to wait.\u201d\u201cHow many times have you spoken to them?\u201d asked Xie Qiao.\u201cThree times, I think?\u201d replied Granny Wan.\u201cI\u2019ll ask around and see when my eldest brother is coming home. I\u2019ll get him over to dig it for me,\u201d said Xie Qiao.Granny Wan was not surprised when she heard that, so she nodded immediately.The courtyard was too remote, causing the maids not to take the lady seriously.Fortunately, the lady cooked her own food in the courtyard, or she would not have anything to eat.It was not Xie Pinggang\u2019s rest day today, so he only returned two hours later. He saw Granny Wan as soon as he stepped in.Xie Pinggang had a faint impression of Granny Wan.

He got up immediately to ask, \u201cIs this about Eldest Lady asking for someone to dig the well? I\u2019ve already gotten someone to do it. It\u2019ll be done tomorrow. Ask Eldest Lady not to be worried. It will be alright if it\u2019s postponed for one or two days.\u201dYuan Rong chuckled.\u201cWell? What well?\u201d Xie Pinggang was confused.\u201cThere used to be a well in Eldest Lady\u2019s courtyard. Not sure why, but Eldest Lady doesn\u2019t like the well\u2019s position. She wanted to fill it and dig another one somewhere else. We\u2019ve been helping with Ms. Pei\u2019s matters these days, so our plates have been full. The well isn\u2019t urgent, so it\u2019s been dragged for a few days. This humble one has explained this to Eldest Lady,\u201d Yuan Rong said immediately.Xie Pinggang managed to capture a few terms from the long-winded speech.\u2018Doesn\u2019t like it\u2019, \u2018Ms. Pei\u2019, and \u2018dragged for a few days\u2019\u2026\u201cWhat are you useful for when you can\u2019t even prioritize things?\u201d Xie Pinggang scoffed and said to Granny Wan, \u201cTell her that it\u2019ll be done tomorrow morning.\u201dYuan Rong\u2019s facial expression turned stiff.Granny Wan did not look too happy either. \u201cNo, Eldest Lady is asking you to go to her. She\u2019s asking you to dig the well,\u201d she said calmly.Xie Pinggang\u2019s eyelids twitched.\u201cEldest Young Master has just gotten home. How can you make him do something so exhausting?\u201d Yuan Rong said immediately, trying to butter up to Xie Pinggang.\u201cEldest Lady has prepared the tools. They\u2019re over there,\u201d said Granny Wan.\u2018Is she for real!?\u2019In reality, Xie Pinggang was a little hungry. However, he thought about it carefully. This sister of his must have felt wronged and wanted him to show people her standing.He said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll dig it.\u201d\u201cEldest Young Master!?\u201d The steward was dumbstruck.\u201cGet more people over. It\u2019s not too late to start digging now. We\u2019ll do it overnight.\u201d Xie Pinggang glared at Yuan Rong, looking upset.That was the steward that his dumb father had picked. He must be blind to have picked him.Yuan Rong had contributed something major back in the mountain stronghold. He was then promoted to an official, but he lacked in capabilities to reach a higher rank. Given that he was considered loyal to his father, he worked for their family at home.Xie Pinggang rolled up his sleeves and went to Xie Qiao\u2019s courtyard.She was currently sitting in the courtyard.She held a chicken feather fan in one hand while holding a book in the other. The sky had yet to turn dark, but she had lit up the lamp aside. Her chicken was by her foot as well, and she seemed rather relaxed.She did not look like she was pissed.Xie Pinggang did not disturb her when he got in. He got the steward over and began to dig the well right after asking where he should start.Xie Qiao lifted her head and looked.\u2018Dark and big eyes, a tough and decisive man. He has a lucky face, but it\u2019s unfortunate that\u2026 he does not have destiny in love?\u2019\u201cTsk!\u201d Xie Qiao could not help but make that sound to express her pity.Xie Pinggang\u2019s hearing was good. He heard that and turned around to stare at her.Xie Qiao put down her book. She supported her chin with one hand and fanned herself with the other as she asked in a relaxed manner, \u201cEldest Brother, when are you getting yourself a wife?\u201dXie Pinggang\u2019s face turned stiff.Why did she ask him when he was getting married? That was heartbreaking for him.\u201cYou\u2019re not young anymore, so you should start a family soon. Our mother in heaven would be happy to see that,\u201d said Xie Qiao.Xie Pinggang\u2019s face looked even more terrible now. She made it sound like he did not want to get married!\u201cIf I can\u2019t find a suitable wife two years later, I\u2019ll buy eight or ten maidservants from the human traffickers and marry all of them!\u201d Xie Pinggang scoffed.\u2018All I want is for them to bear children for me.

    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: Lonely DestinyXie Pinggang\u2019s earlobes were a little red. He seemed a little pissed too.He was in his 20s and should be at his peak. How was it possible that he did not want a wife!?However, he could not just marry anyone. He was not in the mountain stronghold now. In order to really get rid of the name of being a family of bandits, the Xie family had to follow the rules.They had to follow the rules even more than others!His and Pinghuai\u2019s generation was hopeless. After all, their fame had been etched. There was no way for them to change it.Nonetheless, the next generation must be obedient and sensible!The thing was that he did not even have a wife to bear a sensible child for him. He was thinking of marrying an official\u2019s daughter, who was knowledgeable and smart. The appearance was not important while having good behavior was the most important thing.A lady like this\u2026 Even a low-ranking official\u2019s daughter would have many men waiting to marry her.Moreover, the outsiders thought that he was a demon who would beat up his wife. They were worried that he would kill their daughter with a slap, so nobody would consider marrying him.He felt helpless about that!If he was still single a few years later, he would be left with no choice. He would have to marry anyone just to pass the bloodline.Forget that he was considering doing that\u2014Xie Qiao thought he had an unlucky face.The other aspects of his life were fine, but when it came to marriage\u2026 The chance was slim.As Xie Qiao thought about it, she suddenly came to a realization. She held her head low and began to tell Xie Pinggang\u2019s fortune by analyzing his birth information.He was her biological brother after all, so she knew about his birth information.She was stunned as she analyzed.He was born between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. Solitary and lonely, so Xie Pinggang had a lonely destiny?The Loneliness Star was the Star of Solitude, and there was the Star of Widow as well. His fate even intersected with the Tianxu Star and the Tianku Star. It made the terrible destiny worse.Men were worried about loneliness, while being widows was taboo for women. If one had such destiny, the former would be incomprehensible, while the latter would be unromantic!People with lonely destiny were independent, strong, but a little stubborn. They were lone wolves, so all possible romance would stay far away from them!Moreover\u2026Now it seemed their mother, Ms. Peng, was pretty unfortunate.Forget that her daughter had a lethal destiny, now her son, Xie Pinggang, had a lonely destiny. As soon the Loneliness Star entered one\u2019s Self Palace, they would definitely harm one of their six family members in life!It also meant that apart from Xie Qiao, the other reason her mother had a difficult delivery might be caused by\u2026Xie Pinggang\u2019s destiny.\u201cWhat are you mumbling?\u201d Xie Pinggang was starving.\u201cEldest Brother, would you consider becoming a Taoist master or a monk? If you do either, you\u2019ll definitely be successful tens of years later,\u201d Xie Qiao said while smiling.It was futile to rush.There was a way to break everything. Her eldest brother\u2019s issue could be considered difficult, but it could be considered simple too.Every misfortune was related to the five elements. One could solve their bad luck by using the five elements and the benefit of Yin and Yang.However, nothing could be changed immediately. One would have to cultivate their destiny.Did he want to get married? He would have to wait!However, everything had its cause and effect. There was a big possibility that their ancestors had caused the Xie family\u2019s grandchildren to have terrible destinies.Perhaps, the Xie family\u2019s ancestral grave had been placed somewhere unsuitable, or their ancestors had done something evil back then. It made sense that the karma was passed down to the bloodline.Xie Pinggang tossed the tools in his hands. He was pissed.He walked over in big steps, sat on the stone bench, and downed a cup of tea quickly. \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? Me being a monk? Aren\u2019t you worried that the temple would be destroyed!?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m being serious. Eldest Brother, you\u2019re destined to be lonely. It\u2019s rather difficult for you to marry a wife,\u201d Xie Qiao said slowly.\u201cNonsense!\u201d Xie Pinggang was furious upon hearing that, but he suddenly came to a realization. \u201cDid that bloody old Taoist master teach you that!?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had a certain level of mastery in the aspects of thaumaturgy.\u201cIt was Master who taught me that. If you\u2019re not going to become a monk or Taoist master for your lonely destiny\u2026 then, we\u2019ll have to do something else. I\u2019ll inscribe a Yin Yang Five Element Talisman for you later. You\u2019ll have to bring it everywhere with you or place it above your bed. It can adjust your Yin, Yang, and five elements aura. It\u2019ll work as time goes by.\u201dNaturally, he would need more than a talisman.She would need to set up a Purple Seven Star Formation in Xie Pinggang\u2019s courtyard.One would need some items to set up a formation. The Yin Yang Five Element Talisman was considered a safety talisman that worked for all. Xie Pinggang would use that first.It seemed like Xie Pinggang was not in a rush to marry, so she would have time to prepare the items.Xie Pinggang glared at her and suddenly said, \u201cDid you learn Mo Lingzi\u2019s skills?\u201d\u201cJust a little bit, not much.\u201d Xie Qiao spoke softly.\u201cA little bit is enough! He doesn\u2019t have any other skills, but he\u2019s very powerful in physiognomy. You don\u2019t have to master 70% or 80% of his skill. As long as you inherited 10% or 20% of it, men won\u2019t fool you in the future.\u201dXie Pinggang was rather excited. He then asked as he watched the people that were digging the well, \u201cWhy must you dig a well here?\u201dHe thought this girl wanted a well here for convenience.However, he thought differently now.Perhaps she wanted to shift the feng shui for fortune to come\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s not too much of a benefit to digging a well here.\u201d Xie Qiao was being honest.Xie Pinggang frowned and watched Xie Qiao take a sip of her tea. \u201cThe well\u2019s position was bad, bad for the relationship between brothers. You guys would come to my courtyard occasionally, so it\u2019d be terrible if your relationship was affected,\u201d she said slowly.Xie Pinggang wore a respectful expression as soon as that was said. Whether Xie Qiao was accurate about that or not, he could not pretend not to hear her since she had mentioned it.Moreover, it was related to the relationship between brothers. It was a major matter, and she would not just mess with that.\u201cYou\u2019re panting from talking, it\u2019s so annoying. And you talk so slow like a snail, who can stand that?\u201d Xie Pinggang vented, \u201cYou\u2019re a sly person as well. Do you think you\u2019re the master here? Just scold Yuan Rong if he disobeys you, or just look for Father. To think you got me here to work. That wouldn\u2019t punish Yuan Rong!\u201dXie Qiao could not help but snicker out loud. \u201cYou sure are direct with your words, Eldest Brother. It\u2019s unfortunate that you won\u2019t marry a wife.\u201dScold Yuan Rong? It would be a great effort for her!After Xie Pinggang left her courtyard, he would naturally scold Yuan Rong himself. Why would she have to do it?\u201cYou\u2019re still talking? I\u2019ll toss you out if you continue!\u201d Xie Pinggang threatened.Xie Qiao\u2019s eyelids twitched before she smirked.It was no wonder that he had a lonely destiny!\u201cHmph!\u201d Xie Qiao scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to dig the well even if you don\u2019t want to! There\u2019s no benefit to digging a well here, but you have the most powerful Yang energy in the family. It\u2019ll be different if you dig it yourself. It\u2019s good for my health.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Xie Pinggang was rather shocked.What Xie Qiao wanted to say was that her eldest brother was already mature, but he was still a virgin. Naturally, he had the most powerful Yang energy. Any ghouls would stay far away and dare not get close to her!If she did not get him to dig the well, who should she look for? Her father?Xie Qiao lifted her head lightly and seemed to be throwing a tantrum. \u201cSo? Are you digging or not?\u201dA thud echoed as Xie Pinggang flicked her head. \u201cI can, but you should get me something to eat!\u201dAfter flicking her head, Xie Pinggang got up agilely.Xie Qiao felt a ringing in her head from the flick.Xie Pinggang was as big as a bear, so one could imagine how strong he was.Although he had intentionally reserved his strength, it was rather painful for Xie Qiao!Soon, there was a red dot on her head.Xie Qiao was pissed and chuckled in an eerie manner. \u201cEldest Brother, did you see a dead body today? There\u2019s a death odor on your body.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, it dared not come closer, squatting at the corner of the door. It was disgusting.However, Xie Pinggang was still shocked.Xie Pinggang asked immediately, \u201cHow did you know that?\u201dHe was different from his father. His father was a fourth-grade general, while he did not have any capabilities.He had taken the military officer examination before, and his grade had been pretty good. Initially, he would have been an eighth-grade official at the military base in the Imperial City. However, something had happened, making people think he had misbehaved. As such, his career as a military official had come to an abrupt end.He had been demoted, and he was now working as an executioner at the Criminal Division.As an executioner, he was responsible for interrogation or beating up the suspects. He would follow his superiors when he was required to investigate outside.He was a low-ranking official, but he was doing well at the Criminal Division due to his fierce looks.Whether the case was major or minor, the interrogation would end faster with him.Today, he had indeed seen a dead body when he was out for investigation\u2026Xie Pinggang stared right at Xie Qiao as if she had something to do with the case.\u201cDidn\u2019t I already tell you that I can smell that?\u201d Xie Qiao\u2019s voice was soft, and she smiled lightly. \u201cEldest Brother, the stench is heavy. Can it be that something filthy followed you home? I heard people who died a sudden death are scary. Do you think he would step on you when you sleep in the middle of the night, attempting to strangle you to death?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Xie Pinggang snorted. \u201cWhy would I be afraid of him? He died so recklessly, and his body was smashed into a pile of flesh. Even if he became something that could fly, he would still be a good-for-nothing!\u201dXie Qiao was rendered speechless, and her eyelids twitched. She said in a pitiful manner, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault to have underestimated your\u2026 bad temper.\u201dShe tried to scare Xie Pinggang\u2026She must be dumb to have tried doing that!She looked at the door again and noticed that the rotten ghoul was burying its head from the scare.Xie Qiao was surprised and envious. How amazing would it be if she had such powerful Yang energy like her eldest brother did one day!?He had scared the ghoul out of its wits just by speaking. That was\u2026 amazing\u2026Xie Qiao\u2019s eyes flickered for a little bit before she turned her head.The digging of the well stopped two hours later.She calculated the time and asked Xie Pinggang to come again tomorrow at the same time.However, after Xie Pinggang left, the ghoul that he had brought along stayed behind.That was not for the first ghoul that Xie Qiao had seen. She was not afraid, but the ghoul was rather rotten and ugly. She felt like her stomach was twisting when she looked at it.Theoretically, a spirit\u2019s appearance was modeled after the moment they died. However, this one\u2026The ghoul arrived at the door of Xie Qiao\u2019s house. \u201cYou can see me\u2026\u201dThere was something powerful in the house, so this ghoul dared not go in.Xie Qiao frowned. \u201cStay away from my house, you disgusting thing.\u201dThe ghoul\u2019s cloudy eyes were wide opened now. \u201cI have an unfulfilled wish. I won\u2019t eat you if you fulfill it for me!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Xie Qiao smiled lightly and retrieved a golden dragon\u2019s head whip with a wooden handle from her sleeve. It looked more like a rope. She suddenly swung the whip, and a bang resounded.The ghoul\u2019s body immediately emitted sizzling smoke. It was shaking from the pain.\u201cThose who come for the first time usually don\u2019t behave themselves. They\u2019ll only learn after some pain,\u201d Xie Qiao complained softly. It was tiring for her to teach the ghoul a lesson. Could those ghouls not have better manners!?The ghoul was quick to react. After being whipped, it squatted while wrapping its arms around its head immediately and screamed, \u201cS-spare me, Grand Immortal! I have silver! I\u2019ll give all of them to you!\u201dXie Qiao nodded and asked slowly, \u201cWhat\u2019s your wish? Tell me, as long as it\u2019s not something illegal and unethical.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: Skull ObservationXie Qiao put away the whip and sat on the chair. She was ready to listen.The ghoul was terribly ugly. It did not dare to get up at that moment.\u201cMy wish\u2026\u201d The ghoul\u2019s voice was soft. It paused after opening its mouth.What was his wish?In reality, he had no idea. He was already dead. Since it was a miracle that he had bumped into someone who could see him, it was only natural that he wanted to fulfill his regrets!However, he had too many!He was dead at such a young age, and he had died in a horrible manner. He had not gotten married and was childless. He had spent his life making money and had not eaten anything delicious. He seemed to have lived an empty life the past 20 years!The ghoul cried as it thought about it.Xie Qiao did not rush into it. \u201cGive it a good thought. Burying you will cost five taels of silver. It\u2019ll be more expensive if you want to be buried in an auspicious location, 20 taels of silver at least. Give more money if you want to set up a formation with talismans. The \u2018item\u2019 would cost 50 taels of silver at least. It won\u2019t be sealed, and you can choose the design.\u201dThe ghoul lifted its head and looked stunned upon hearing that.\u201cSo expensive!? W-what\u2019s the item?\u201d\u201cThe item\u2026\u201d Xie Qiao rummaged through her basket and took out a wooden doll that was the size of a palm. \u201cThis one. You can carve it into anything you like. I can carve a house and even a human. However, it\u2019s expensive since it\u2019s custom-made.\u201dThe ghoul stared at the wooden doll in Xie Qiao\u2019s hand.It was carved into the form of a fairy-like lady. She was elegant, graceful, and beautiful!\u201cY-you\u2019re burning it for me?\u201d asked the ghoul, feeling surprised.\u201cHah!\u201d Xie Qiao smiled silently. \u201cSure, it depends whether you can afford it.\u201d\u201cH-how much silver does it cost?\u201d asked the ghoul.\u201cI only sell this to a lonely soul like you. This one that I have with me\u2026 would be 1,000 taels of silver. That\u2019s my last offer,\u201d Xie Qiao said again.\u201cWhy is it so expensive?!\u201d The ghoul inhaled sharply!She was talking about a couple to tens of taels earlier. How come it became 1,000 taels now? The wood quality was ordinary!\u201cJudging by your color, you definitely did many bad things when you were alive, right? My prices depend on the person. I\u2019ll charge you more if I don\u2019t like the sight of you. If you\u2019re not happy about it, just leave. This is a proper business. Nobody will force you to buy, and nobody will force me to sell. Naturally, there\u2019s a cheaper one that costs 50 taels of silver. It\u2019s too ugly, so I don\u2019t currently have it in stock,\u201d said Xie Qiao.The soul that she had buried earlier had a lucky face and a nice color. Although it had been a servant, it was not evil.However, this one was different. Its body was rotten, and she sensed the ominous aura on its body. It must have done many bad things when it was still alive.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dThe ghoul stared at her in horror. It looked as if its secret was being seen through.\u201cWhat? Am I wrong?\u201d Xie Qiao said while smirking.There were physiognomy and palmistry for humans, as well as phrenology and aura reading. In order to observe someone, one must observe their skull first. The flesh on the skull was not as important as what was inside.Judging by his head alone, his forehead was not considered plump. His life must have been ordinary.There were 18 auspicious signs on the occipital bone. However, this person had a flat and ordinary skull. He had none of the 8 auspicious signs, meaning he lacked luck in his life.His parietal bone was rather pointy\u2014his behavior was unethical.His sphenoid bone was low\u2014he was lonely and cunning.Ordinary brow bone, the sign of wither\u2014even if he obtained wealth, it would not last.However, he had pretty great high cheekbones\u2014a sign of power.Plump mandible bone\u2014he must have lived a life without worries.However, the two advantages were dragged when all combined. Therefore, even if this person possessed power and fortune, he would only stay in a small community. He couldn\u2019t become a king or an official to conquer the world.It would be just a dream.Xie Qiao was behaving coldly and seemed more and more mysterious now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please do something for me\u2026\u201d The ghoul hesitated. \u201cI-I\u2019m looking for a lady\u2026 Although I\u2019ve only met her once, there\u2019s something that I\u2019m confused about.\u201dXie Qiao asked carefully, \u201cWhat lady?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I saw a lady before I was dead. It was blurry, but I knew that she\u2019s pretty charismatic\u2026 I felt she resented me, the kind of resentment that would make one kill,\u201d said the ghoul.He could not remember how he had died exactly. It was all a blur.However, he knew that his death had something to do with that lady.Xie Qiao made up her mind to ask her eldest brother about it tomorrow.The Criminal Division was responsible for reviewing all of the cases. Apart from reviewing cases, they were also responsible for investigating suspicious and major cases.Her eldest brother would definitely know what exactly had happened to that ghoul.Moreover, it was very strange.The ghoul\u2019s form was rotten. It seemed to have only turned into a spirit after a long time of being rotten. It was clearly unusual.Xie Qiao took out a brush and paper to get the description from the ghoul and painted the features of the lady\u2019s appearance.After she was done, she got a container and captured the ghoul inside.Some ghouls would wander longer out there if they had powerful Yang energy. If they died with resentment, they would exist in the world for an even longer period. Although this ghoul had no idea how it had died, it clearly did not care much about its death. It was just doubtful.It would be wandering as a soul now, but it might vanish after a period. Thus, it would be better for Xie Qiao to capture it before it paid her silver.On the next day\u2026It was the day Xie Qiao would start studying at the academy.She went to the accountant early in the morning.Ms. Lu was there too and frowned slightly when she saw Xie Qiao.\u201cWhat did you say to your eldest brother yesterday? He punished Steward Yuan by beating him with a heavy stick. We don\u2019t know how long he will be resting in bed. There are so many things at home that are waiting for him to do!\u201d\u201cMother, you should ask what Yuan Rong did. If it\u2019s really unforgivable, you should chase him out of the house. That should be what a mother should say. Do you need me to teach you that?\u201d Xie Qiao was a little talkative as she looked at the silver notes in her hand.Ms. Lu was stunned.That seemed to be what she should do\u2026Ms. Lu sorted her voice. \u201cYuan Rong has been following your father for a long time. He deserves a little credit no matter what\u2014\u201d\u201cHe only deserves a little credit after following Father for so long. Seems like this man is useless,\u201d Xie Qiao said softly. She then stamped her thumbprint on the account book.Although the money was a lot, she would not spend it recklessly.She wanted to live a long life. It was not enough to earn good karma by changing the fates of the ghouls she occasionally bumped into. Therefore, she was going to open a store.As the Xie family\u2019s daughter, it was impossible for her to expose herself in the streets.However, it would be much easier if she had a store as her cover.Ms. Lu opened her mouth wide. It would be bad for her to say something terrible because of a steward. She could only tolerate it while looking cold.She watched Xie Qiao leave the house happily with the silver.Those were 5,000 taels of silver!The family\u2019s financial situation was tight, yet she was still spending money!However, Pei Wanyue was smiling.She hoped that Xie Qiao would get into the Royal Academy successfully. After she got in and the news of her giving a forged painting spread, her morality would be questioned. Would she definitely not be chased out by then?As Xie Qiao took the 5,000 taels of silver, Ms. Lu got some money and brought Pei Wanyue to the Gulan Academy.The Gulan Academy was also a well-known academy. It was just that compared to the Royal Academy, the Gulan Academy educated men mainly. They were less strict with the girls.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: The LibraryIn reality, the Imperial City\u2019s renowned academies had extraordinary backgrounds.However, Pei Wanyue was unwilling. Therefore, she failed to squeeze a smile on her face and looked cold.Xie Qiao was different.She had her head filled with all the good things in the Royal Academy, as well as the Yang energy that was beneficial to her.\u201cMiss, you can\u2019t bring a maid with you to the academy. Will you be able to cope, given your health?\u201d Chun Er was rather concerned.It would be hectic at the academy, whereby she would have to stay for six to eight hours per day!\u201cI can.\u201d Xie Qiao looked as proud as the sun. There was even warmth in her tone now.It was good to go to school. She finally felt high-spirited now!In reality, her health had improved significantly since she turned 15. However, in the past\u2026It was a long story.Her body had been weak not long after she was born. It was hard for her to breathe, and she would be scared by ghouls every now and then. Ever since she had started walking, she would always pass out.It was common for her body to feel cold in the middle of the night, as if she was in an ice cave.She would have nightmares every day from the influence of Yin energy.Thus, she disliked sleeping. She would stay under the sun and read whenever she had time. She would even exercise a little bit to prevent getting weaker.Learning more and working hard would make her forget the feeling of dying.However, it was different when she was at the academy.There were fewer men and more ladies here. There was more Yang energy than the sun\u2019s energy at noon. She had not seen any ghouls at the academy yesterday, so she was over the moon!If she knew that the feng shui was great here, she would have come to the Imperial City from the very beginning.Although she had heavy evil energy in her back then, which would harm her family, she could have lived in the side courtyard\u2026It was a pity!Xie Qiao was smiling for a while and sighing for a while.At the moment, many carriages stopped outside the academy.The academy prepared rooms for the students. However, there were more male students, as most female students would go home every day.There were five rest days each month, and it was less strict for the ladies. They could apply for rest days if their bodies were weak and feeling ill. However, they would have to catch up with their homework as much as they could.Everyone would have to walk after stepping into the academy\u2019s gate. Not only that, all of them were pampered young mistresses, and maids were prohibited.Xie Qiao dropped by the place she took the examination yesterday.Ms. Xu had been anxious the whole day. He was ready to be blinded by a pile of silver taels.Not only that but there were also many people watching out there. They were here to watch Xie Niushan sending actual money.Unfortunately, Xie Niushan did not come.Ms. Xu thought it was odd that he was not here.\u201cSir, this is a gift from me.\u201d Xie Qiao handed the painting.Xu Mian was stunned. \u201cA painting?\u201dHe thought she would give silver notes even if she was not giving silver taels! In reality, silver notes were great too. They were not as shiny!\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xie Qiao nodded.Her skinny and fragile body looked rather high-spirited now. Her eyes were bright, and her soft voice was like a stream flowing, slow but powerful.Xu Mian felt more relieved now. He thought the gift would be appropriate as long as its quality was passable.He did not expect its value to be worth 5,000 taels of silver. It would work even if it was only worth 2,000 to 3,000 taels of silver!However, he was dumbstruck when he rolled out the painting.The painting style and the wild handwriting\u2026At that moment, his spirit was lifted, and he rolled the painting immediately. \u201cAmazing! Great, this can be stored in the library!\u201dFor the items that the academy collected, silver taels or notes would be put away in the storeroom, porcelain wares and precious stones in the treasury, while books and paintings in the library. The library had a few doors too. The further the door was, the more precious the items in there.Many people were watching the library to guarantee that things would not be stolen or to prevent fire accidents.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: The Orchid CourtyardXu Mian was very emotional, which made the people curious.\u201cMr. Xu, what\u2019s that exactly? Show it to us!\u201d complained someone.They had come all the way here to watch, but Mr. Xu did not even show it to them?!\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you guys? The bell is ringing. Go to your classes now! If you\u2019re late, aren\u2019t you afraid that your teacher will punish you?!\u201d Xu Mian clamored and clasped the painting in his hand even tighter now.It was Master Yun Wei\u2019s masterpiece!Master Yun Wei was an expert out there. He did not have many paintings on the market, but each of them was precious. At the moment, the academy had only collected a painting of a drunk Taoist master. It was a small painting, but it had an extraordinary artistic conception.The Taoist master in the painting seemed nothing different than a regular man. He was even a drunkard. However, when one looked at it carefully, they would notice the melancholy of the Taoist master seeing through everything in the world.The Taoist master\u2019s chic and carefreeness were brilliantly showcased in the painting.Master Yun Wei\u2019s handwriting was like a wandering dragon and flying phoenix. At the same time, it was like a violent wind and magnificent thunder. It contained an intense wildness!How could he do that if he had not been painting for tens of years?Such a master must be dying now. Anyone would collect however many paintings they could as they would be something valuable for years to come!\u201cSir, which class do I go to?\u201d asked Xie Qiao.Xu Mian was so happy that he almost forgot. He said immediately after Xie Qiao\u2019s reminder, \u201cYou\u2019re in Class Sun in the Snowball Bush Courtyard. I heard that you grew up in a Taoist temple from a young age. I\u2019m worried that your foundation is lacking, so this class suits you better.\u201dXie Qiao raised her brows slightly. Since she had no idea how this Snowball Bush Courtyard was, she could only nod to respond.Subsequently, Mr. Xu brought the new students to their classes.Xie Qiao was stunned as soon as she arrived at the class.The entire class\u2026What should she say? They were all\u2026 ten-year-old ladies. None of them were 15.Although she was not planning on making friends, she was surrounded by children. Would she not be an attention seeker?\u201cSir, can I be in the same class of people my age?\u201d asked Xie Qiao.\u201cYou can. It\u2019s just that most people your age have been studying in this academy for a few years. They have a good foundation. Moreover, our requirement is high. This class is different. The requirement is lower,\u201d Xu Mian was extraordinarily patient since he had obtained something valuable. His voice was gentle too.\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d said Xie Qiao.\u201cAlright, then. I\u2019ll send you there. If you can\u2019t catch up, you can always come back.\u201d Xu Mian was very easy to talk to now.Xie Qiao would be sent to the Orchid Courtyard after speaking to him.She had been listening to the other ladies chatting along the way, so she understood the class system now.Class Qian, Kun, Sun, Moon, A, B, C, D. The arrangement had something to do with their identity.For instance, she was a fourth-grade official\u2019s direct eldest daughter, so she was put into Class Sun.There were five small rankings after that.They were ranked by flowers.The first one was the Peony Courtyard, second Orchid Courtyard, third Chrysanthemum Courtyard, fourth Snowball Bush Courtyard, and fifth would be the Begonia Courtyard.Although Xu Mian agreed to send her into the higher ranking class, she was only sent to the Orchid Courtyard. The reason being those who wanted to get into the Peony Courtyard would need to sit for an examination. The students in the class were skilled, talented ladies. The number of students was low as well.Nobody could get in through shortcuts.The Snowball Bush Courtyard only had a snowball tree in the courtyard. There was nothing special about it.However, it was different at the Orchid Courtyard.There were varieties of orchids planted all over the courtyard. The fragrance lingered, so it made it extraordinary.Xie Qiao only walked in after looking around for a little bit. She found somewhere inconspicuous to sit.Although she sat somewhere inconspicuous, she attracted some attention anyway.It was the Orchid Courtyard, meaning almost no new students would be sent here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: GossipThe people were very curious about Xie Qiao. They would turn their heads to look every now and then.Not many knew about her identity. However, they found out as the words spread!Within a blink of an eye, the seats around Xie Qiao\u2026 became empty.\u201cSo this is the lady from that bandit family? How come Mr. Xu sent her to our Orchid Courtyard?\u201d mumbled someone.\u201cIsn\u2019t her sister at the Begonia Courtyard? She\u2019s born into a bandit family. Can she catch up to us?\u201d\u201cI peeped at her earlier. Will she get her brother to fight me?\u201dEveryone panicked when they heard that.Xie Qiao did not hear all those things. She was reading the book that she had brought.It was the Orchid Courtyard, after all. The things they learned here were different from the Snowball Bush Courtyard. The Snowball Bush Courtyard was still reading the primer, and here\u2026 They were already talking about The Doctrine of the Mean.It was mandatory to learn about the Four Books and Five Classics, discussions of all sorts, Collection of Wisdom, important people of the world, and history.There would be a teacher arranged for each class, and there would be at least four hours of class per day.For instance, the first class that Xie Qiao attended would be talking about \u201cMs. Yuan\u2019s Precepts for Social Life\u201d. It mainly talked about one\u2019s behavior when dealing with people and how to run a family. The class was clearly meant for ladies.It was the mandatory class for literature. There was also a mandatory martial class, which was horseback archery and pitch-pot.The rest were elective courses, such as tea ceremony, flower arrangement, the four arts, music theory, mathematics, needlework, and even cooking. The more intense ones would be whack-ball[1] and ball games, which were tiring activities.Mr. Xu told her about all that along the way. He also gave her a booklet.The time of each class and the teachers\u2019 names were written on the booklet.Xie Qiao was overwhelmed as she looked at the things that she would be learning.Soon, the bell rang, and the teacher came in.The mandatory class\u2019 teacher had the family name of Lu. He came from a big family and had taught many students. He was considered the person in charge of the students in the Orchid Courtyard.He wore a white robe and looked approximately 60. He had a long beard, which made him look like an immortal who was rather majestic.Master Lu looked around the class as soon as he came in and said calmly, \u201cWhy are you guys squeezing together? Return to your seats.\u201dThat made all students quiet. They buried their heads and dared not say a word.A moment later, a lady stood up and said politely, \u201cSir\u2026 Master Xie used to be a bandit, so\u2026\u201d\u2018So we\u2019d rather squeeze together instead of sitting too close to her!\u2019Master Lu sat there and suddenly asked, \u201cThe four characteristics of a gentleman\u2014Reverence in doing, respectful in duty. Kindness in cultivating, righteous in serving. What does that mean?\u201dThe lady was stunned, and she stammered, \u201cA revered behavior, respectful to his Master, kind to the people, and serving the people with righteousness. A man with these four characteristics is a gentleman.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Master Xie was wrong in the past, but he\u2019s a changed man now. He stood up when the country was in crisis, he\u2019s a righteous man. He\u2019s now an official who works diligently. He doesn\u2019t misbehave, and he did everything that the emperor delegated wonderfully. He doesn\u2019t bully the people, so that proves that he\u2019s a good official who is no different from a gentleman. So what if he was a bandit before?\u201dMaster Lu added, \u201cSit alone quietly with your thoughts, don\u2019t gossip about people. Return to your seats!\u201dAs soon as he said that, those who had changed seats returned to their seats carefully.Xie Qiao was rather surprised to find that this teacher was so forgiving.It had been five to six years since her father had become an official. It seemed he still met with obstacles in his career since many still judged him.It was her first time hearing a compliment about her father![1] Chuiwan, or Chinese golf.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, Xie Niushan\u2019s identity was\u2026 too sensitive.In the academy, the other two children from the Xie family were boycotted. Now he had one in his class too. If she was a rough one, arguments would be hard to be avoided.He was old now and was worried that the scary Xie Niushan\u2019s daughter would be hard to teach. What if she rebelled against him?However, after observing her during the class, Master Lu was over the moon!Even if she was illiterate, judging by how focused she was, she was definitely a good child!Master Lu\u2019s class lasted the entire morning.Almost all of the ladies in the class were sleepy.This made Xie Qiao\u2019s eyes extra bright.\u201cDo you think she understands? She\u2019s definitely buttering up Master Lu,\u201d whispered the two ladies next to Xie Qiao.\u201cI heard she has the same mother as Xie Pinggang. Sigh\u2026 This is annoying. I\u2019m dying to criticize the people from the Xie family whenever I think about Sister Dong!\u201d said the other lady.Xie Qiao raised her brows slightly.Sister Dong?Could she be\u2026The one that her brother had confessed to and stalked?That should not be? Her eldest brother was an unromantic man. He had yet to mature in that aspect, and he was still single. How was it possible that he could court a lady?The lady changed the topic. \u201cI heard that His Highness, the Prince Consort, had come to the Imperial City. If he\u2019s here, the Fourth Imperial Highness will definitely fall into hardship.\u201d\u201cHis Highness is great in everything, but he\u2019s just too stubborn. An emperor can\u2019t be a cripple. If I were him, I would\u2019ve resigned since the beginning. He\u2019s wasting the love the officials are giving him.\u201d\u201cShh, softer, please,\u201d the other person reminded her immediately.Who would be willing to resign from such a position?Since the beginning of time, which crippled Prince Consort would have a good ending?Xie Qiao was forced to listen to a round of gossip again.Prince Consort? Crippled?She had just come to the Imperial City, so she did not know much about the officials. However\u2026 Something seemed to be wrong with the hand of the Young Master that she had bumped into earlier?Could he be\u2026Xie Qiao thought about a lot of things, which made her stay awake.She already knew about a lot of things that Master Lu was talking about. In reality, the morning class was rather harsh to her.After the mandatory class ended, Xie Qiao was ready to leave early.Although the horseback archery course was mandatory, it only happened a few times a month instead of daily. Therefore, she could leave.It was not that she missed home. She just wanted to look for a store to arrange the business to secure her life.\u201cShe has just attended half a day of class, and she is already leaving. As expected, she\u2019s just here to pass the time. She\u2019s worse than her brother and sister!\u201dXie Qiao had just left when someone said their piece behind her back, looking irritated.\u201cAlright, are you done? What if you trigger her and Xie Pinggang comes looking for you?\u201d\u201cWho said I\u2019m scared of him?! He\u2019s just a low-ranking official, and he dared to dream about wooing Sister Dong! If he dares to bother her again, I\u2019ll get something to capture him!\u201dAlthough she said that, Xie Niushan was an official after all.Also\u2026There was another reason why the Xie family had been living a peaceful life until now\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: What Are You Guys Doing?Back then, a powerful strategy advisor had been living with the Xie family on the mountain stronghold.Ever since the strategy advisor had been recruited, he had been promoted.The emperor made him a Grand Preceptor. He was also made a Golden Purple Guanglu Doctor, a second-grade official. On the one hand, he mainly took care of the feng shui matters. On the other hand, he was an official close to the emperor. Since the emperor was fond of him, even other officials in the imperial court had to respect him.Meanwhile, this Grand Preceptor\u2026 had a close relationship with Xie Pinggang!How would Xie Qiao know what others were thinking about?She was wondering whether the 5,000 silver notes that the Xie family had given were sufficient to buy a store at a good location.At the same time, some people in the Imperial City were looking for her.\u201cBrother Qin, don\u2019t rush it. No matter what, even if I have to beg on my knees, I\u2019ll definitely beg Half-Immortal Xie to save you!\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou looked terrible as he watched his good friend.Qin Zhi was lying on the bed at the moment.He was weak and looked horrible.He looked like he was drowning in water. He had a hard time breathing and felt terrible.Qin Zhi secretly felt pity for himself.He was so unfortunate!He thought his bad luck would be gotten rid of after he found Half-Immortal Xie\u2019s master. However, when he had met Mo Lingzi, the latter had asked him to wait for death after taking a glance at him!Mo Lingzi had even said that his case was severe, and there was nothing that he could do about it!Mo Lingzi was helpless about something that his disciple could handle!He had paid quite some valuables in return for some amulets and Dharma instruments to be able to live until now!\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear that Half-Immortal Xie i-is the daughter of an official? How is it possible that she would h-help me? Also, the way I treated her\u2026\u201d Qin Zhi shed tears of regret as he spoke to this point.If he knew this would happen to him, he definitely would not have bullied Half-Immortal Xie back then!\u201cYoung Master said we should prepare some silver notes. It might work. However, we\u2019re out of luck today. I heard Ms. Xie has gone to the academy. I thought I would look for her there, but she left early.\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou sighed.The light in Qin Zhi\u2019s eyes dimmed even more now.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I got people to watch. Young Lady Xie still isn\u2019t home. As soon as she gets home, I\u2019ll go to the Xie Residence right away,\u201d said Imperial Bodyguard Zhou.\u201cI\u2019m afraid Half-Immortal Xie will be pissed if you show up out of the blue,\u201d Qin Zhi said pitifully.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou was helpless!Qin Zhi was finally sensible now. Why was he not like this before!?They had visited a few Taoist masters along the way to the Imperial City, but It had been futile.They could not even tell what was wrong with him.Half-Immortal Xie was the most accurate when it came to fortune-telling!It would be fine if Xie Qiao was just a female Taoist master. Most of the imperial bodyguards were from powerful families. Only a minority of them, like Qin Zhi, were selected from the military camp. No matter what, he was an official after all. Moreover, his future was bright. People would usually respect him.However, Xie Qiao was a regular lady.Nobody should spread the word that this lady was accurate in fortune-telling to ruin her reputation, nor could Qin Zhi go to her house to get her to save him. He would offend her for nothing.Especially His Highness had found a lot of evidence of criminal conduct lately. It would be a mess at the imperial court. Many despised His Highness, and as the subordinate, he should not stir more troubles for him!Xie Qiao took a stroll and memorized the rough conditions of the few streets.She then returned home.Qin Zhi\u2019s subordinates were secretly guarding outside the Xie Residence\u2019s door. When they saw Xie Qiao home, they almost threw themselves at her as if they had seen their mother.Although they did not throw themselves at her, they were walking fast.However, they were stopped.Xie Pinggang had appeared out of nowhere. He stood before the few of them.\u201cWhat are you guys doing?! I suppose you guys have been hiding outside my house for a while!?\u201d Xie Pinggang\u2019s bear-like body was majestic as he looked at the few of them condescendingly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

By then, everyone would be watching His Highness!The few imperial guards thought they would speak to Xie Qiao quickly. However, it did not seem like it would happen now.They ran swiftly and disappeared in the blink of an eye.Xie Pinggang was speechless and stood there, feeling dumbfounded.\u2018Who were those people? What the hell!?\u2019\u201cFortunately, it wasn\u2019t Mr. Zhou who came here. Our faces are new, so that big gorilla shouldn\u2019t have recognized us.\u201d The imperial guards who ran away felt very lucky.One of them suddenly said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we\u2026 work with the maids and get them to pass the letter?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea! We were thinking of looking for her, so we forgot to find a more convenient way! However, I\u2019m worried that Half-Immortal Xie might ignore us after reading the letter. That dimwit Qin Zhi will offend her by then!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s try it. Didn\u2019t Young Master say to give more silver\u2026\u201dSilver was indeed great. They should not be stingy now.Qin Zhi still had his parents and wife to look after. What would happen to the family if something was to really happen to him?The few of them mumbled. They dared not delay the matter for even a day.Approximately an hour later, two of them turned around and arrived close to the Xie Residence\u2019s side door. They secretly waited for the people inside to come out. Meanwhile, the others returned to gather silver.Xie Pinggang was confused. However, he did not forget that he had to dig the well.As soon as he returned, he headed to Xie Qiao\u2019s courtyard.Xie Pinggang asked in concern, \u201cDid you see a few shady fellows when you came in?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Xie Qiao shook her head.\u201cBring a few people with you when you go out. I noticed those people looked ferocious. I wonder where those hooligans came from to be behaving atrociously in the alley where officials live.\u201d Xie Pinggang was calm.After all, he had been a bandit before. He was much scarier than those hooligans in the past.Xie Qiao nodded.Her life was important. Since Xie Pinggang was willing to get more people to protect her, she was naturally happy about that.She said when she recalled the ghoul yesterday, \u201cEldest Brother, the body that you found yesterday\u2026 What kind of case was that?\u201d\u201cThe one yesterday?\u201d Xie Pinggang thought about it. He was rather surprised to notice that Xie Qiao was interested in such a thing.It was rare that the siblings had something to talk about, so Xie Pinggang was nice enough to chat with her. \u201cThe case seems rather normal on the surface. The man was harmed.\u201d\u201cOn the surface?\u201d asked Xie Qiao.\u201cThat man was called Mei Ziwu. He was a gangster. He had about 20 subordinates with him, and they were in the loan business. Most people who are in this business are filthy, so he was killed. Since he had offended many, it makes sense that he\u2019s killed.\u201dXie Pinggang added, \u201cThe strange thing is the way he died,\u201dXie Qiao lifted her head and looked at him with interest.\u201cHow did he die?\u201d asked Xie Qiao.\u201cAren\u2019t you scared?\u201d Xie Pinggang thought he had underestimated his sister from the same mother.Xie Qiao was helpless. She was scared in the beginning, but it was useless that she was since she had witnessed many strange things. She could only learn to accept.\u201cJust tell me, Eldest Brother. I might be able to solve the case for you,\u201d Xie Qiao said while smiling.Xie Pinggang did not take what she said seriously.If it was that easy to solve a case, then the case would not have been categorized as a suspicious case.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: Gathering Good KarmaHowever, since Xie Qiao had already said that, Xie Pinggang did not want to embarrass her. She was a lady, after all.He explained, \u201cHe was buried in the suburbs. A woodcutter found him, and he was already rotten when he was dug out. There were nails mounted on a couple of spots on his body. It looked terrifying. The nails were removed on the spot. Twenty years ago, there was a big case in Qingzhou. An official had brought his family out, and the entire family had been killed. They were buried the same way as well, and the culprit hasn\u2019t been found until now.\u201dXie Qiao frowned when she heard that.\u201cHe had nails on his body? How many?\u201d asked Xie Qiao.\u201cEleven, I think,\u201d Xie Pinggang thought about it, while his expression changed slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t ask where the nails were mounted. I can\u2019t tell you that.\u201dSome of the spots were rather obscene. A lady should not hear about that.\u201cWhy not? Were they on his head, between his brows, throat, heart, belly button, abdomen, lower body, arms, and legs?\u201d asked Xie Qiao.Xie Pinggang looked at her with a serious face when he heard that.Xie Pinggang asked directly, \u201cCan it be that you know the culprit?\u201dXie Qiao forced a smile. \u201cBrother, the 11 spots are rather special. There are books like that back at the Water Moon Temple. I read about it.\u201cHumans have three ethereal souls and seven corporeal souls. Among the three ethereal souls, the Heavenly Ethereal Soul and Earthly Ethereal Soul wander around. The one that remains in the body is the Life-Destiny Ethereal Soul. The seven corporeal souls correspond to the Yin and Yang. They\u2019re hidden in the body and form seven chakras.\u201cThe Sahasrara is in the head, Agya between the eyebrows, Vishuddha in the throat, Manipura in the navel, Svadhishthana in the abdomen, Muladhara in the perineum, while Anahata in the heart and the four limbs. When the 11 spots are nailed, the Life-Destiny Ethereal Soul can\u2019t leave, nor can it reincarnate. It should be a gravely evil curse.\u201d\u201cIs there such a thing?\u201d Xie Pinggang was in deep thought.If that was the case, the culprit must have a huge grudge against Mei Ziwu and the official\u2019s family members from 20 years ago?Xie Qiao asked again, \u201cWhat\u2019s the direction you\u2019re going about the case, Brother? Do you have any idea?\u201d\u201cThe case 20 years ago was difficult, but Mei Ziwu\u2019s one has just shown up. There\u2019ll still be some clues. This person bullied the weak and was scared of the powerful. However, he knew a little bit of martial arts. He was known to be a coward. Therefore, we suspect it\u2019s done by someone he knew. Meanwhile, we still don\u2019t know how many people killed him. We\u2019re still investigating.\u201dIn reality, he had a feeling that this case would most probably become a cold case.This Mei Ziwu did not have a family, nor did he have many true friends. Nobody looked for him when he died.He had done many terrible things. If it was not related to the case many years back, nobody would investigate his case even if he was dead.Xie Qiao had a slight hesitation.She had no idea how to say it.The culprit had killed so many people. If the culprit was captured, she could definitely gather much good karma.However, how could she tell her eldest brother that she could see ghouls out of nowhere?\u201cIt could be a woman.\u201d Xie Qiao\u2019s voice was like a bell as she spoke casually. \u201cSince this Mei Ziwu was a coward, I suppose only weak and harmless women could get close to him. Why don\u2019t you investigate women who are in their 40s or 50s? Charismatic ones would be best. Moreover, those who are capable of doing such a thing must\u2019ve read some special books. They\u2019re different from ordinary people when they speak and do.\u201cOh yeah, she can\u2019t be poor. She must have some money.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know any women in their 40s or 50s, but there\u2019s one who is 20. Mei Ziwu went to see a nice lady when he left his house the other day,\u201d said Xie Pinggang.\u201cThis person was very cautious. It\u2019s impossible that he was killed by someone who was following him. Since that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll have to investigate people who showed up close to that woman\u2019s house. Maybe someone happened to see him and killed him since he matched a certain characteristic,\u201d Xie Qiao said.The 20-year-old lady had been detained and interrogated many times today.She was pale from the scare. She was obviously not a person who had the ability to kill.However, what Xie Qiao said made sense.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I know physiognomy.\u201cYour worry is written on your face today. The relative solution is on a woman. So please, find the dirt on a woman without holding back. Also\u2026\u201dXie Qiao extended her hand, seemingly telling fortune.She said after a moment, \u201cAlso\u2026 The woman should smell nice.\u201d\u201cSmell nice? You can predict that too!? Who are you trying to deceive!?\u201d Xie Pinggang snickered out loud.Xie Qiao\u2019s cheeks flushed a little bit. \u201cJust investigate! Everything I predicted is accurate!\u201d\u201cThen tell me, what else besides her smelling nice?\u201d Xie Pinggang was eager to hit her. If it was Xie Pinghuai who dared to spew such nonsense, he would hit him directly. How would he say so much to her?\u201cShe has a mole under her eye,\u201d Xie Qiao said seamlessly.Xie Pinggang was rendered speechless, and his eyelids twitched. \u201cYou sure are daring to speak!\u201dXie Qiao felt helpless.She could predict it if she wanted to. However, one would have to provide a certain \u201cdata\u201d for fortune-telling. It was like doing mathematics. If everything was unknown, naturally, the answer would be unknown too.To put it simply, fortune-telling was an ability in probability and logic. There was no preliminary condition. She could not be making things up out of nothing, right?\u201cBrother, try investigating from the pointers I gave. I\u2019m your sister. I won\u2019t harm you, will I?\u201d Xie Qiao released two sighs as she spoke. \u201cLook, I\u2019m exhausted from speaking. Why would I put in so much effort if it\u2019s not to help your future?\u201dShe began to cough hard after she was done speaking.Half of what she did was real, and half was fake.She had been sick for many years, so she had a deep understanding of how weak a patient could be. As such, she made herself look gravely pitiful.As expected, Xie Pinggang felt as if his heart was going to beat out of his chest because of her vigorous coughing.\u201cSure, I\u2019ll do that tomorrow.\u201d Xie Pinggang frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re so weak, and your lethal\u2014\u201dXie Pinggang shut his mouth as he spoke to this point. It was bad for a lady to have a reputation of a lethal destiny.Therefore, ever since Xie Qiao was born, they would only say that her body was weak. They had even turned the truth around and said that their father had a lethal destiny that he might harm her.He and his father were the only ones who knew about the real situation. They did not even dare to tell Ms. Lu.Xie Pinggang sighed and proceeded to dig the well.Soon, he saw there was a shady fellow outside Xie Qiao\u2019s courtyard again.He captured the person immediately. \u201cWhy are you staring at Young Lady\u2019s courtyard!? Tell me, or I\u2019ll sell you!\u201dSome people had been waiting for Xie Qiao earlier. They must be careful.Now he even suspected that his sister was too beautiful, so she was being targeted by bad fellows!Otherwise, why would an old lady be dropping by suspiciously? Before earlier, he had said that everyone in the Xie family was prohibited from coming to Xie Qiao\u2019s courtyard unless she ordered them!The old lady was carried in directly.The note that she was holding dropped right away.Xie Pinggang picked it up and read.It was written: \u2018Half-Immortal Xie, save a life, and we\u2019ll pay 100 taels of gold! Please speak to us outside!\u2019\u201c100 taels of gold? Who is it?\u201d Xie Pinggang frowned, \u201cWho is this Half-Immortal Xie? Is it you? Where did you get this horrible name? What\u2019ll happen if this spreads? Do you still want to marry a husband?\u201dXie Qiao\u2019s eyelids twitched.\u201cYour family name is Xie too, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said stubbornly.Xie Pinggang felt helpless about this sister of his. She was clearly lying without blinking.Figuring that she was weak, he did not dare to yell at her.He could only say in a cowardly manner, \u201cIt\u2019s not that the reputation is bad. It\u2019s just that I mentioned to you before that we brought you back to the Imperial City to find a husband who matches your destiny. The people in the Imperial City think differently than we do. They\u2019re very strict toward ladies\u2026 No matter what, you have to present nothing different from ordinary ladies. By then, we can get someone to have a child with you.\u201dThe man was not important, but if her destiny killed him\u2026 there was nothing that they could do.He only wanted Xie Qiao to bear a child successfully. By then, the Xie family would take care of the child for her.If she lost the man in the future, she would live a good life for tens of years if she decided to live in some Taoist temple and have the child to pay for her expenses.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: I Hit SomeoneXie Qiao rolled her eyes at Xie Pinggang subtly.He thought everyone was unromantic like him?\u201cTell me, what\u2019s happening exactly? You\u2019ve just come to the Imperial City. How come someone sent you a letter?\u201d Xie Pinggang thought he was being very gentle.\u201cNo idea, I don\u2019t know who it is.\u201d Xie Qiao shook her head, pretending to be a good girl.She had no idea who that was!Giving 100 taels of gold to save a life? That person sounded rich.Xie Qiao looked sincere and did not look like she was lying. Xie Pinggang frowned and said a moment later, \u201cI\u2019ll be accompanying you to the academy for the next few days. I suspect it\u2019s from those hooligans out there. I\u2019m worried that they\u2019re trying to lure you with money, seeing that you\u2019re young and just came from the countryside. They must\u2019ve thought that you\u2019re a poor girl who has never seen the world.\u201dThey could only blame the Xie family for being poor. Every official family in the Imperial City knew that they were poor.It was no wonder that these people thought that Xie Qiao, the Eldest Lady, was poor without silver.Xie Qiao felt rather troubled.If Xie Pinggang was protecting her, then she could not manage the matters at the store herself.The store she was opening was unique. Her main business was dealing with the dead.Meanwhile, Xie Pinggang\u2026He was hot-headed. If he found out, he might be angry.However\u2026 Her health was unsuitable for her to manage some miscellaneous matters. She had to get someone to help no matter what.She knew quite many people back at the Water Moon Temple during those years she had been living there. It would not be difficult for her to get someone to manage the store.Xie Qiao said honestly after giving it some thought, \u201cSorry to trouble you, Eldest Brother.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Xie Pinggang shook his head.\u201cHow come you didn\u2019t go to the academy back then, Eldest Brother?\u201d Xie Qiao suddenly asked, \u201cNo matter being a liberal arts scholar or martial arts scholar, if you studied at an academy for a few years, wouldn\u2019t you have more connections?\u201dXie Pinggang was 20 years old this year. The Xie family came to the Imperial City five or six years ago. Back then, Xie Pinggang could have gone to the academy. However, he had taken the imperial martial arts examination instead. He had been given the title of a martial arts scholar.However, being a martial arts scholar was not as good as being a liberal arts scholar. The future of a martial arts scholar was dull as well.Xie Pinggang\u2019s cheeks flushed.Nobody knew what he was thinking about.Xie Qiao guessed and asked, \u201cCan it be that Eldest Brother actually sat for the exam? Did they reject you?\u201dXie Pinggang was rendered speechless. He figured it was not a good thing that his sister was too smart. He could not keep any secrets.\u201cYou didn\u2019t pass the basic entry examination?\u201d Xie Qiao frowned.It could not be?She may not have been home these years, but she knew many things that had happened at home. Xie Pinggang had actually gone to school.Xie Pinggang looked away and said casually, \u201cI hit someone when we came to the Imperial City. I have a bad reputation now, so the academy rejected me.\u201dThe incident had happened a long time ago, and perhaps many had already forgotten about it.Xie Qiao looked at him in surprise. \u201cWho did you hit?\u201d\u201cA teacher at the Royal Academy. That man was mean with his words. He said that the people of our Xie family aren\u2019t worthy of being officials. I didn\u2019t know that he was a teacher back then. If I knew\u2026\u201d Xie Pinggang hesitated for a moment. \u201cI would\u2019ve hit him harder.\u201dXie Qiao glanced at Xie Pinggang with sympathy. She knew very well of the Xie family\u2019s situation back then.Being bandits was wrong indeed. However, if they had a choice, why would they choose to be bandits?Moreover, when her father had killed the barbarians back then, nobody had said that bandits could not fight. The battle was over, so how come the Xie family had not received any rewards?\u201cGreat job.\u201d Xie Qiao supported him.Xie Pinggang was pretty happy to hear that.He accidentally tore the note from the joy.At the moment, people were waiting outside. However, they did not see Xie Qiao until the sky turned dark.Not only that, on the next morning, Xie Pinggang sent Xie Qiao to the Royal Academy himself!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Without the Prince Consort\u2019s letter, even the imperial guards from the East Palace could not enter as they wished.Naturally, there were ways to meet the students studying there. They just had to tell the teacher why they were there and obtain the teacher\u2019s permission.However, in a class full of ladies, it would be difficult if the guests were men.The few imperial bodyguards looked at each other.They hesitated and left.\u201cIt seems that Xie Pinggang will be guarding Half-Immortal Xie for a long time. I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t approach her these few days\u2026\u201dOne of them said, feeling troubled, \u201cMaybe\u2026 We should inform His Highness\u2026\u201dIf His Highness came himself, he could meet her at the academy.However, as His Highness\u2019s close imperial bodyguards, it was a taboo to need His Highness\u2019 protection.No matter how merciful His Highness was, it was impossible that Qin Zhi could stay by His Highness\u2019 side, or the rest who wanted his position would feel unfair.Compared to his life, that was nothing\u2026Imperial Bodyguard Zhou glanced at Qin Zhi, who was dying in bed. He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201dThey had only told His Highness that Qin Zhi was ill instead of telling his real situation.His Highness had many imperial bodyguards around. All they had to do was not to assign him to work for a few days.It would be horrible to tell His Highness that Qin Zhi was insensible to be doubtful of His Highness\u2019 judgment and had not believed in Half-Immortal Xie\u2019s ability. That was why he had ignored what Half-Immortal Xie said when she was around!?However, now that this had happened\u2026Imperial Bodyguard Zhou arrived before Zhao Xuanjing obediently. He knelt on the ground and recounted everything that had happened.\u201cThis humble one is to blame to not have watched him back then. Now, his illness\u2026 It\u2019s quite severe. He went to doctors, but none of the medicine worked. We even took him to a few Taoist masters secretly along the way. All of them said that something filthy is on him. He drank water with a burned talisman, but it didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Imperial Bodyguard Zhou.Zhao Xuanjing glanced at him.\u201cSo you\u2019re saying he\u2019s been surviving on the things he got from the Water Moon Temple?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing asked while frowning.\u201cYes. Half-Immortal Xie\u2019s Master gave over 10 talismans. He would carry them close with him every now and then. Every time the talisman was taken out, the thing would be burnt.\u201d Zhou Weizong nodded immediately.He took out the talisman that was burnt earlier and showed it to Zhao Xuanjing.Xie Qiao\u2019s \u201cweak\u201d face appeared in his head.He frowned. He wanted to laugh as he thought about it.\u201cI happen to be visiting the Royal Academy today. I\u2019ll ask her. However, I can\u2019t guarantee whether she will say yes,\u201d Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s low and slow voice was heard.Zhou Weizong was stunned.\u2018He sure is easy to talk to\u2026\u2018Something seems off, though.\u2019No matter what, Qin Zhi\u2019s life would be safe for now as His Highness had agreed to do it.He changed into a light-green robe in the room. There were silver bamboo leaves embroiled at the edges of the sleeves. He had a jade belt tied around his waist and looked more gentle and charismatic now.However, his dark eyes were dimmer now.Back in the academy, many people surrounded Xie Qiao.\u201cOur Orchid Courtyard won\u2019t serve useless people. If you\u2019re just here to pass the time, go to the Begonia Courtyard. It\u2019s quiet over there!\u201d\u201cAre you going to leave after attending half-day of class again? Are you going to drag our Orchid Courtyard down in the examination!?\u201d\u201cMs. Xie, we knew that it\u2019d be troublesome for you to learn at such an age. But you can\u2019t be troubling us, right?\u201dXie Qiao was speechless and rather dumbfounded. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWhat do we mean? How dare you ask that?!\u201d One of the ladies was loud.Xie Qiao remembered her. She had been gossiping about her aside yesterday. It was just that she had no idea what her name was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: Make It UpThese people looked anxious. Xie Qiao had just come to the academy and did not know the rules yet.Therefore, she was not angry. Instead, she asked in detail, \u201cDidn\u2019t the academy say that we can choose our own classes?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d Fang Muxue stood out and explained after exhaling, \u201cOur academy will have all sorts of competitions every now and then. Everyone will spar so that we can find out what we\u2019re lacking\u2026\u201dXie Qiao frowned slightly.\u201cSister Muxue, it\u2019s useless that you explain to her. Isn\u2019t she already slowing us down?\u201d Xia Yayun scoffed. \u201cEveryone from the Orchid Courtyard wants to go to the Peony Courtyard. With her here, I\u2019m afraid others will think that we\u2019re idiots!\u201d\u201cYayun, did you forget what the teacher said yesterday?\u201d Fang Muxue asked immediately.She was biased against Xie Qiao yesterday as well.However, it was more of a fear to her. After all, the Xie family\u2019s young masters and young mistresses were rather infamous.Now that she thought about it, the teacher was right. Master Xie was an official now, not a bandit. Meanwhile, this Young Lady Xie\u2026 looked normal.Since they did not know each other, there was no reason to be mean to her.\u201cI\u2019m just telling the truth. We can\u2019t let her affect everyone, am I right?\u201d Xia Yayun was stubborn.Xie Qiao thought about what she said.She said a moment later, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cXia!\u201d Xia Yayun secretly jolted.Xie Qiao nodded. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that you want to get into the Peony Courtyard?\u201d\u201cOf course. Who wouldn\u2019t?!\u201d said Xia Yayun.\u201cAren\u2019t we judged by our own ability to get into the Peony Courtyard? What does that have to do with me? Or none of you can\u2019t get into the Peony Courtyard just because I\u2019m here?\u201d Xie Qiao added.That lady named Muxue was pretty gentle with her words. There would be exchanges between students, but it did not seem to be mandatory. If everyone else went and she did not, it would be inappropriate indeed.She knew that as well.However, what Xia Yayun said was rather irritating.\u201cYoung Lady Xie\u2026\u201d Fang Muxue glanced at the both of them, feeling troubled, and said, \u201cActually\u2026 This is what happens. There will be grading for the sparring between the courtyards.\u201cThe courtyard with the higher grade will be rewarded every month,\u201d she added.Xie Qiao was stunned upon hearing that. \u201cRewards? The booklet doesn\u2019t say\u2026\u201d\u2018That Mr. Xu sure is mischievous, isn\u2019t he?\u2019Fang Muxue could not help but smile upon seeing her stunned face. \u201cIt isn\u2019t in the booklet. The rewards are handsome.\u201cI\u2019m sure Young Lady Xie knew that the gift to pay to get into the academy is pretty expensive. Everything requires silver as well. Also, the academy has a request whereby students from every courtyard will have to do good deeds out there every two months. We\u2019ll compete to see who gives out more silver through the good deeds. Meanwhile, we make the silver from the competitions that we do every now and then.\u201dThere were many rules at the academy.For instance, even the imperial prince and imperial princess could not bully others with their identity here.If anyone dared to boast they were the young mistress from some family, they would definitely be expelled.Also, the amount would be recorded if they did not make enough money to do good deeds at the academy. They would then have to bring money from home to make it up.Their families did not lack in the insignificant amount of silver taels.The thing was, everyone practiced the culture of showing off in the Imperial City!If any of the family had to give money to make up for the amount spent on good deeds, then the child\u2026 would definitely be less likable!There was nothing else that they could do other than completing the requirements as much as they could.Now that Xie Qiao was here\u2026Indeed, that might increase the difficulty of completing their mission.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Young lady, can you tell me more about it?\u201d Xie Qiao\u2019s tone was soft as she looked at Fang Muxue.\u201cYou\u2019ve no idea at all?\u201d Fang Muxue was surprised.Everyone in the Imperial City knew the Royal Academy\u2019s rules, no!?\u201cI\u2019ve only been in the Imperial City for a short period.\u201d Xie Qiao seemed calm.\u201cImpossible. I bet you\u2019re pretending! Since you\u2019re already here, how can you not know the academy\u2019s rules?\u201d Xia Yayun did not believe her at all.There were three academies in the Imperial City. Not all who came all the way to the Royal Academy were here just to study!Especially ladies, they mainly came for the Royal Academy\u2019s strictness and good reputation!Before coming to the academy, she had learned every single rule there were. She had been worried that she would go against any rules at all!Xie Qiao felt very helpless.\u201cI just heard that the academy\u2019s library has many extant copies. So I thought I\u2019d read them.\u201d Xie Qiao kept it short and sweet.Everyone looked at Xie Qiao in a rather strange manner upon hearing that.\u201cI think\u2026 you\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d Fang Muxue shook her head. \u201cOne cannot simply read the books in our academies.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Xie Qiao raised her brows slightly.\u201cIf everybody could read the extant copies and rare books, they might have been torn by now.\u201d Fang Muxue sighed.Xie Qiao nodded. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d\u201cThe regular students can only go to a few small study rooms. Only a few people will be allowed to go to the real library each month. If you want to get in, you\u2019ll need enough gold nuggets or silver nuggets.\u201dFang Muxue took out a purse as she spoke and poured out the nuggets inside.Xie Qiao looked at them.They were silver, gold, and round. There were some simple patterns on them as well.\u201cHere they are. Ten silver beans would add up to a tael. Although you can bring your own brush, ink, and inkstone, you\u2019ll have to use the stamped paper every time you pass up your homework to the teachers, or they\u2019ll become invalid. You\u2019ll need to buy the paper with silver beans. We need silver beans for our daily snack as well. Meanwhile, these gold beans are mainly used at the library.\u201dFang Muxue was rather patient.However, Xie Qiao was annoyed.Her body was\u2026 weak. She did not want to waste her effort.All she wanted was to take care of her body and drop by the library to read occasionally. However, it seemed like\u2026 she could not do that now?She frowned.Fang Muxue thought this Young Lady Xie was pretty pitiful.She definitely could not catch up to the syllabus since she had only come at such an age. If she wanted to read like she said\u2026Nobody would take her seriously.Xie Qiao could not help but mumble, \u201cOh, well\u2026 Did that rule start when the academy was built?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It has always been like that,\u201d Fang Muxue nodded.Xie Qiao sighed.\u201cYoung Lady Xie, we\u2019re actually doing this for your own good. Peony Courtyard and Orchid Courtyard have extraordinarily high requirements. The fee is high as well. However, it\u2019s different at the Begonia Courtyard. The ladies over there are young, and the requirements for good deeds are low too. As long as you\u2019re smart about it, it\u2019s easy to make money,\u201d Fang Muxue added.Xie Qiao raised her brows slightly.\u201cYou\u2019re too nice, Sister Muxue! Xie Qiao, we don\u2019t like you! Isn\u2019t your sister at the Begonia Courtyard? Go be with her!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d Xie Qiao shook her head.\u201cWhat did you say!? Do you not understand human language!?\u201d snarled Xia Yayun.\u201cI said I\u2019m not going. Young Lady Xie doesn\u2019t understand human language, yet you\u2019re blaming my listening skills for being bad?\u201d Xie Qiao suppressed her tone. She did not seem like she was stressed.She was unhealthy, so she should not get angry easily.Nonetheless, she was irritated by this Xia Yayun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83: Pent-Up EmotionsXie Qiao\u2019s tone was firm, and it was even laced with a hint of mockery.Xie Qiao paused for a moment and said slowly after calming down a little, \u201cI\u2019m sure all of us will be assigned to collect the donation ourselves unless I can\u2019t do it on my own. Otherwise, it\u2019s impossible that I get you guys to carry the burden for me, right?\u201d\u201cIt is, but\u2026\u201d Fang Muxue felt rather awkward, \u201cIt\u2019s just that the donation is quite a lot, and we\u2019re only left with a month to submit the next donation. Each of us from the Orchid Courtyard will have to prepare 500 silver beans.\u201d500?That was quite a lot indeed.These people said that one could use silver to buy the silver beans. However, since the academy had such a rule, if the families compensated, the amount of silver that might be used would be much higher than the value of the silver beans.Naturally, it was mainly because it would ruin one\u2019s reputation.If one did not give the silver beans, nor did they get their family to compensate, the amount would be assigned to the other students. Otherwise, the Orchid Courtyard\u2019s overall grade would be affected.\u201cThank you, Young Lady Fang, for the reminder. I\u2019ll think of a way myself,\u201d said Xie Qiao.\u201cHah, you\u2019re saying as if it\u2019s easy. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get your family to help in the end, right? If there\u2019s anyone from our Orchid Courtyard who\u2019s donating depending on her family, we\u2019ll be humiliated!\u201d Xia Yayun said intentionally.\u201cI said I\u2019d think of a way, so I\u2019ll definitely do it. There\u2019s no need for Young Lady Xia to be pointing fingers and sticking your nose in my business,\u201d Xie Qiao said coldly.\u201cWhat if you can\u2019t!?\u201d However, Xia Yayun was not ready to let go of Xie Qiao just yet.Before Xie Qiao could speak, Xia Yayun added, \u201cIf you fail to gather the silver beans, you\u2019ll get out of our Orchid Courtyard. How is that? Whether you\u2019re going to the Snowball Bush Courtyard or Begonia Courtyard, our Orchid Courtyard isn\u2019t for you!\u201dXie Qiao held her head low slightly while rubbing the tiny bell on her wrist.\u201cI\u2019ve no idea about the talent of the students from the Orchid Courtyard. However, judging by Young Lady Xia\u2019s behavior, I\u2019m sure that you guys who agree with her have low virtue as well.\u201d Xie Qiao said and smiled in a sarcastic manner, \u201cIf I can\u2019t hit the Orchid Courtyard\u2019s requirement, without the pressure coming from all of you, I\u2019ll go to the place that suits me. However\u2026\u201cYoung Lady Xia, I think your behavior has lowered the entire Orchid Courtyard\u2019s standard. If I manage to gather the donation, please get out. How is that?\u201d Xie Qiao smiled lightly.Her tone was too peaceful as if she was talking about something very normal.In reality, some of these people were anticipating to see Xie Qiao being pissed today.After all, the Xie family was born bandits. In their eyes, they were rude and crude.Meanwhile, the rest were people of noble blood who looked at the lowly people of a different kind in a condescending manner.However, what they did not expect was that Xie Qiao was presenting overly calmly.She was fearless, not angry, not surprised, and not afraid.She looked like she was chatting about something simple. Her slow voice was even like a soft wind. She made people feel intense guilt and shame.A lady who came from a bandit family was as clean as a piece of white cloth. It was so ironic that it made one fail to hold their head up.Xia Yayun\u2019s cheeks flushed from the anger.She knew that what she did was aggressive, but she hated the people from the Xie family.Especially Xie Pinggang\u2019s sister from the same mother!Who had asked Xie Pinggang to bully her Sister Dong!?Xie Qiao could not help but smile upon seeing that nobody spoke.\u201cSo you guys are bullying me? Or maybe I should speak to the teacher. I need someone to be on my side, or else\u2026 I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll have pent-up emotions. My life would be painful.\u201d Xie Qiao smiled and got up.\u201cSure!\u201d snarled Xia Yayun as soon as Xie Qiao moved. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that you\u2019ll be able to gather the donation!\u201dApart from donations, she would need money for food and necessities as well!Since the age of ten, they had been in the academy, so they would definitely have some savings. Xie Qiao was a newbie. Could she do it!?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84: HungryXie Qiao smiled lightly when Xia Yayun spoke.That was great.They went to class a moment later.In reality, the atmosphere in the class was rather strange. It was impossible that Master Lu did not notice that, but he pretended not to see.He said nothing, nor did he ask anything.Xie Qiao thought to herself, \u2018This Royal Academy\u2019s way of teaching must be free-range style, but in a suppressive manner.\u2019One could tell that judging by the fact that they were not allowed to bring a maid along and the gold and silver beans system.\u201cIf you want to earn beans, you\u2019ll have to go for other classes,\u201d As soon as Master Lu\u2019s class ended, someone suddenly shook Xie Qiao softly from behind. A soft sound came.Xie Qiao turned around and looked. She was rather surprised.That lady held her head down. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make 500 beans within a month. You might lose.\u201d\u201cYou already said that I \u2018might\u2019 only,\u201d Xie Qiao was calm. She patted her chest to adjust her breathing.\u201cIf you want to earn beans, you can copy books, do embroidery, or do accounting for the teachers\u2026 It\u2019s just that the teachers have high requirements. You won\u2019t be paid any beans if you don\u2019t reach their standard. You\u2019ll have to pay if you break the teachers\u2019 belongings,\u201d the young lady added.The young lady looked 15 or 16, similar to her.However, she was shorter. She seemed petite and cute.\u201cThanks. You are\u2026?\u201d\u201cMy name is Qin Liu.\u201d The young lady\u2019s cheeks blushed. She turned around and ran right after saying that.Xie Qiao was rather stunned.Why did she run?Xie Qiao did not leave early today. She was going to eat at the academy. She was just thinking that it would be boring to eat alone\u2026She sighed softly.Studying was hard. It was another day she missed the Taoist temple.There were eight kitchens in the academy. They were separated into Kitchen Qian, Kun, Sun, Moon, A, B, C, and D as well.It was similar to the canteen in her past life. It was just that they were taking care of a bunch of young masters and young mistresses, so everything looked delicious and full of variety.Two zones were separated in each kitchen. Men and women would occupy each zone.Xie Qiao had a rough idea of the system. As expected, when she checked out the kitchen, she realized all of the dishes had to be paid with gold and silver beans!The dishes that could only be purchased with gold beans\u2026 were imperial cuisine!?Xie Qiao\u2019s eyelids twitched.As the student of the Orchid Courtyard, she had a sachet with the image of an orchid hung on her waist.She thought the students from Begonia Courtyard must be given special treatment since they were new. It would be ridiculous to starve them.The problem was that Xie Qiao did not even have a silver bean.She was weak from hunger.She felt the silver notes in her embrace. She had never thought that there would be a day when she had money, but she had nowhere to spend it.\u201cSister!\u201d Just when Xie Qiao was going to leave, a shy voice came.She turned her head and looked. Her eyes lit up immediately. \u201cXi\u2019er?\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026 aren\u2019t you eating?\u201d Xie Xi frowned and pointed at the food. She then looked at Xie Qiao\u2019s tummy.Xie Qiao smiled awkwardly, \u201cI\u2019m just looking. It\u2019s the same to eat at home.\u201dXie Xi stood there and spaced out for a while. She held Xie Qiao\u2019s hand without letting go. Nobody knew what she was thinking about.After thinking to herself for a little bit, she opened her hand that was tightly gripped. There were five silver beans in there. \u201cFor you.\u201dXie Qiao looked at her in surprise.She knew from the letters in the past that Xie Xi was a little slow. She did not speak much, and she loved keeping silver.However, now she\u2026 did not seem like that?If she was slow, how could she tell that Xie Qiao was hungry?Xie Qiao would hardly do a physiognomy to a kid without being asked. The reason being a kid\u2019s bones were still growing, whereby their faces would change, and their character had yet to be set. It would not be accurate, and their fate could be changed in the future.Xie Xi was only 12, and her face was still rather chubby now. Xie Qiao did not want to predict her life.At that moment, she felt a tinge of warmth inside of her.So this was her sister?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: Rare TreasureXie Qiao\u2019s eyes were gentle as she smiled at Xie Xi.Unexpectedly, Xie Xi buried her head and said softly, \u201cYou\u2019ll need to return me\u2026 10 silver beans.\u201dXie Qiao was rendered speechless, her eyelids twitching. She almost thought she had misheard.\u201cYou can also return me\u2026 silver,\u201d added Xie Xi.Xie Qiao immediately felt cold inside. She had been under the impression her sister was a warm and sweet thing. Never had she thought she was a little mischievous.\u201cSure, I\u2019ll definitely return them to you.\u201d Xie Qiao felt helpless, \u201cI heard it\u2019s hard to earn silver beans. You sure are easy-going with them, ain\u2019t ya?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not hard, is it?\u201d Xie Xi lifted her head and looked at her. Xie Xi\u2019s eyes betrayed her confusion.Xie Qiao was stunned. The people at Orchid Courtyard had said different things. She immediately asked, \u201cHow do you earn these silver beans?\u201dXie Xi blinked her pure eyes as she pondered. \u201cI run errands, buy things, grind ink, dust tables and chairs. That\u2019s how I earn them.\u201dXie Xi\u2019s answer enlightened Xie Qiao.The students would usually earn silver beans through classes at the academy. Take needlework, for example\u2014the handkerchiefs they made should be sold by the academy and converted into silver beans to reward the students. Another example would be the calligraphy and painting class. If they performed well, their artwork would be naturally good. They would get the bookstores out there to sell, and many people out there would purchase them.One could say that the academy paid a portion of the rewards. Nevertheless, the students earned most of the silver beans through their hard work.However, Xie Xi\u2026 Her way of making silver beans was rather wrong.Clearly, what she did\u2026 Did not really match her identity.There were no maids in the academy. Therefore, there were definitely many young ladies who had just enrolled and could not get used to it. They would earn silver beans from other classes, and they would use those silver beans to hire Xie Xi to work\u2026Xie Xi was an official\u2019s daughter and might be teased for her way of making money. There must be many people secretly making fun of the Xie family failing to educate their children.It was just that\u2026Xie Qiao noticed that her eyes were pure, so she could not bring herself to scold her.Moreover, Xie Xi indeed made those silver beans fair and square. There was nothing embarrassing in that aspect.Xie Qiao said while smiling as she thought about it, \u201cYou\u2019re so clever, Xie\u2019er. Lend me these silver beans for a day, and I\u2019ll think of a way to return them to you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d Xie Xi was over the moon after making sure that Xie Qiao would return the money.In reality, one could buy quite many things with five silver beans, as long as they were not picky\u2014a snack, a bowl of pork soup, and fruits. She would have two silver beans left.\u201cYour Highness, is that Half-Immortal Xie?\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou thought he had gotten the wrong person. \u201cSeems like she\u2019s not doing well\u2026\u201dHe recalled that this lady had been digging bones in the middle of the night and made over 200 taels of silver from His Highness. Yet, she was so poor now that she could not even bring herself to spend a few silver beans?He thought Half-Immortal Xie would definitely be a boss who would make a lot of money when she came to the academy!Zhao Xuanjing watched from afar. After all, it was the ladies\u2019 kitchen, and there was a gauze curtain in the middle. They should not go near.They saw Xie Qiao put away two silver beans carefully. She looked very serious.People who had no idea would think that she was putting away some rare treasure into her embrace.\u201cThis is the academy. Please watch the appellation,\u201d Zhao Xuanjing said and smiled. \u201cCheck out what class she\u2019s taking in the afternoon.\u201dImperial Bodyguard Zhou carried out the order right away. It was quite easy to accomplish that.\u201cShe has swordsmanship and horsemanship class today,\u201d said Imperial Bodyguard Zhou.Zhao Xuanjing frowned upon hearing that. His eyes were dark.Meanwhile, Zhou Weizong could not help but feel doubtful!Swordsmanship?Half-Immortal Xie?He could not imagine Xie Qiao dancing with a longsword!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: CompetitionZhou Weizong had witnessed how weak Xie Qiao was, whereby she would faint easily. He could even imagine this lady\u2019s pitiful face from passing out directly when she saw the shiny sword.Zhou Weizong could not help but feel heartbroken.He lifted his eyes slightly to look at his master. He saw him looking calm as if everything was fine. His acceptance level was stunning.\u201cWho is the doctor on duty at the academy today? Get him ready\u2026\u201d Zhao Xuanjing paused to think to himself. \u201cGo to the imperial palace to get some good medicine. Get those that nourish the heart and qi, as well as those that treat external injuries\u2026\u201dXie Qiao only learned about the afternoon classes she had an hour later.She frowned and looked serious.Swordsmanship\u2026Could she not do it!?However\u2026 It should be similar to the Taoist swordsmanship she used to evict monsters and demons, right?She had a Taoist sword that she carried with her as well. However, the sword her master had given her was rather heavy. She had left it at the Water Moon Temple instead of bringing it along. She only had a few peach wood swords of various sizes in her bamboo box.The meaning of the sword was rather unique. Therefore, the Taoist robe that she used to wear had two sword-shaped ribbons on it. It was called the Sword of Wisdom and was meant to cut off troubles, lust, and greed.When it came to the comprehension of sword practice, Xie Qiao thought she was pretty good at it. It was better than horseback archery. She really could not do that.If she really got onto a horse with her weak body, her soul might leave her body.Unfortunately, she had to attend both classes, and each of them lasted for an hour.Xie Qiao felt rather troubled and sighed softly.A couple of students in Orchid Courtyard noticed she looked troubled and gloated.\u2018A mountain bandit who knows nothing. Even if she had learned martial arts, she must be using a kitchen knife, right?\u2019 Someone secretly laughed.There was an exclusive training field in the academy. It was massive, and there were many men over there as it was shared. However, they stayed away from each other, and they had zero communication.Xie Qiao followed the rest to the training field. She was nervous before, but she immediately felt relieved when she saw the swords on the weapon rack. The edge was blunt, and there were even tassels on it. One could tell that it was a practice sword, not the kind used to fight and kill.Each of them picked a sword. Xie Qiao also held one in her hand. She took a good look at it and discovered that not only was the edge not sharpened but there was even a layer of wax on it. Clearly, they were worried that the young ladies might hurt themselves.The swordsmanship master was a lady.Physical contact was inevitable during martial arts practice, so it would be much more troublesome if the master was a man.\u201cWe\u2019ll have a competition today.\u201d The teacher said something shocking as soon as she appeared. \u201cWe\u2019ll compete on the Moon Dance that I taught you guys a few days back. Stand out if you want to participate, sit down to watch if you don\u2019t. The reward for the first prize is handsome. All the best, everyone.\u201dShe got someone to bring out the reward.Xie Qiao looked over.The reward was a small bowl of silver beans and a set of hair accessories.Xie Qiao had no interest in hair accessories. However, she had a burning desire in her eyes when she saw the silver beans. There should be at least 50 silver beans in that small bowl if there were not 80?Unfortunately, she was completely clueless about Moon Dance.She stood still where she was.\u201cTeacher, you\u2019ve been teaching us the Moon Dance for a few days. We haven\u2019t mastered it yet\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You should test us on the Zixia Dance we learned last month. We\u2019re much more familiar with that. We guarantee that we\u2019ll make no mistake!\u201dThe young ladies were panicking a little.\u201cI\u2019ve given you guys a few days of time. If you still don\u2019t know it, it proves you didn\u2019t practice it at home. We\u2019ll compete on this today. Oh, I heard that His Highness might patrol the training field later. Lift your spirit, all of you. If you guys perform horribly, you\u2019ll humiliate the academy,\u201d added the teacher.The young ladies\u2019 eyes lit up when they heard that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: Troublesome Or A Blessing?Burning desire filled their eyes when they looked at the teacher.\u201cTeacher, which His Highness\u2026 are you talking about? Can it be the Fourth Imperial Highness?\u201d asked someone.The teacher frowned slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s His Highness, the Crown Prince.\u201dXie Qiao heard those young ladies sigh softly as soon as the teacher spoke. Were they disappointed?The Crown Prince was less likable than that Fourth Imperial Highness?Xie Qiao thought it was interesting. However, she despised gossip like this, so she asked nothing.A young lady who was straightforward among the crowd spoke. \u201cOh, so His Highness the Crown Prince is coming. So what if we perform a perfect sword dance? Do we expect His Highness, the Crown Prince, to admire us? If His Highness really likes us, it\u2019ll be troublesome, not a blessing. What\u2019s there to be happy about?\u201d\u201cShh! That\u2019s the Crown Prince. Aren\u2019t you worried about your head if this spreads? If the Crown Prince really heard this, your entire family would be doomed!\u201d Someone next to her reminded her softly.That young lady lowered her head upon hearing that. She rubbed her feet against each other and harrumphed.\u201cYou don\u2019t like His Highness, but there are people who like him! Also, he\u2019s not really here to see us.\u201dThere was more than one person who mumbled.Some of them despised the Crown Prince, but they still looked happy.\u201cI heard the Crown Prince solved a big case. My father has been upset because of that lately. Many people hate him. When the items His Highness submitted have been investigated, I\u2019m afraid the execution ground will be drowned with blood.\u201d\u201cSuch a big case?\u201d\u201cOf course, it involves many people. No matter what, His Highness has made a great contribution and offended many at the same time.\u201dThey were all daughters of officials, so they knew a little something about what was going on.They were excited during the discussion.However, they were just talking about it privately. They dared not discuss it loudly.Xie Qiao was standing close to them. She heard some terms on and off and then connected the dots herself.The swordsmanship teacher glanced at the students and said, \u201cAlright, those who want to participate will stand on the right side.\u201dFor some strange reason, Xie Qiao had a feeling that the teacher seemed to have peeped at her.She wondered what that meant.She remained standing where she was obediently. She was not going to try.Although her strength was pretty good now, she would take a while to catch her breath every time she played with a sword. Her body would feel terrible!\u201cXie Qiao, aren\u2019t you going to earn the silver beans for the donation yourself? There are so many silver beans over there. Aren\u2019t you going to compete for them?\u201d Xia Yayun appeared again.Xie Qiao was not shy, so she admitted openly, \u201cI\u2019ve never learned the Moon Dance.\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019ve never learned anything?\u201d Xia Yayun snickered. \u201cXie Qiao, I\u2019m saying this for your own good. Our Orchid Courtyard has many classes, and there are more apart from swordsmanship. You\u2019ve never learned anything. If you stand among us, won\u2019t you be a piece of rotten wood within gold?\u201dXia Yayun and the few young ladies around her could not help but laugh as soon as she said that.\u201cYayun, you can\u2019t say that to Young lady Xie.\u201d Fang Muxue frowned. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many ladies who learn swordsmanship anyway.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just telling the truth. I\u2019m not in the wrong. If she doesn\u2019t deserve the spot, she should give it to someone else!\u201d Xia Yayun said stubbornly.At that moment, Xie Qiao suddenly realized why the old man had been insisting that she had to get off the mountain.During those years on the mountain, she had learned not to be upset or happy. She was like an old person who was in meditation.Meanwhile, beneath the mountain, there were people like Xia Yayun\u2014a pain in the *ss.She had been trying to trigger her enlightened mind nonstop and would never stop.It was a test!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: RegistrationXie Qiao sighed softly. She had decided to tolerate it. If she managed to tolerate this, she would be an expert who was utterly generous and accepted everyone in the world!She held her head low slightly.\u201cWhat? You have nothing to say? I\u2019ve seen too many people like you. You\u2019re just like those insensible maids at home. They have the destiny of a servant, but they want to be a boss. So what if they managed to do that? No one can alter a lowly destiny!\u201dXie Qiao\u2019s eyelids twitched. She was worried that she was going to ruin her enlightened mind.The reason being\u2026 She could no longer tolerate this!\u201cI wonder what strange wind blew this stench over.\u201d Xie Qiao lifted her head and said slowly, \u201cWhat\u2019s lowly? To me, it\u2019s lowly for one to gossip, have evil thoughts, slander, while it\u2019s horribly lowly when one is greedy and cunning. I\u2019d think that I\u2019m none of those. Young Lady Xia, I wonder how lowly do you think you are?\u201dXie Qiao added, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to admit whether you\u2019re lowly or not. I can see with my eyes.\u201dShe lifted her feet and walked to the right side after she was done speaking.She stood where the bunch of people were registering and said to the teacher while looking at her, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019ve never seen the Moon Dance before. However, since we\u2019re competing, it\u2019ll be better if there are more participants. Please teach me, teacher, so that I can showcase what I\u2019ve learned right away.\u201dThe teacher was stunned. \u201cYou want to participate?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I don\u2019t want some lowly people slandering me. They think it\u2019s harmless, but they\u2019re always giving me trouble. It irritates me.\u201cI\u2019ll be pissed when I\u2019m irritated.\u201cWhen I\u2019m pissed, I\u2019ll have trouble breathing and feel like fainting. My body has been weak since I was young. If I really faint here, it\u2019ll be Young Lady Xia\u2019s fault.\u201dEveryone present was rather shocked.Xie Qiao\u2019s eloquence was really\u2026 mean\u2014so mean that she gave people goosebumps.She did not say much, but it was beating around the bush and courteous. It was so good that they had no idea what to say!If they criticized her, they would fall to a disadvantage.Xia Yayun felt uneasy as she swallowed her fury. Her eyes were furious and red as if there was fire coming out of them.Meanwhile, the skinny Xie Qiao stood where she was. She had a bold elegance and did not mind making fun of herself. Yet, she was not cold and heartless. She was like a bright moon that was shining on people.She was calm like the sun rising on the east.She was Half-Immortal Xie.Xie Qiao knew how a half-immortal should be. Since she could teach her master to pretend to be one, she was naturally confident in her self-image.The teacher snapped back to her senses after being stunned for a while and coughed. \u201cS-since you\u2019re participating, I\u2019ll show you once after everyone is ready. I\u2019ll only do it once. You\u2019ll have to watch what you\u2019re lacking. I\u2019ll be fair and square during the competition.\u201dXie Qiao nodded.Xia Yayun clenched her fists and stood to the right. She was pissed.\u2018Do you think you\u2019re a genius? Able to learn from watching it once? What kind of nonsense is that!?\u2019 Xia Yayun gnashed her teeth.The rest said nothing and behaved at the moment. After all, Xie Qiao was mean with her words. It would be humiliating if Xie Qiao scolded them like how she had scolded Xia Yayun.Xia Yayun was more irritated upon seeing that nobody joined her. She was waiting for Xie Qiao to embarrass herself.Soon, the teacher showcased the Moon Dance once.The sword dance consisted of longswords and short swords. The Orchid Courtyard was mainly using longswords. With the long tassels, it would be much nicer when they swung the swords.The Moon Dance had flying movements, and the longsword reflected cold and captivating light.Xie Qiao watched carefully, memorizing each of the teacher\u2019s movements in her head.The hand swung the sword like it was retrieving a talisman. The body turned in circles with the sword slanted, as if one was inscribing a talisman in the air. The tip of the sword pointed into the sky like breathing. Meanwhile, retracting the sword looked like burning a talisman\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: LuckWhen Xie Qiao saw the intense part of the sword dance, she thought it looked like the times when she suppressed ghouls.It looked similar\u2026In Taoism, people would obey God, be true to themselves, and show their power with the Taoist sword. If she could not even handle the sword in her hand, the ghouls would have devoured her.Xie Qiao was weak in martial arts. Mo Lingzi had taught her the swordsmanship of the 13 Sword Techniques, representing the Bagua and five elements.The five-elemental Bagua could transform into many things. Therefore, at the moment, each of the teacher\u2019s movements was like a big, round plate. There was an extraordinary rhythm when she moved.Xie Qiao had practiced the Living Sword in the past, the kind that contained no killing techniques, nor was it intense.Fortunately, this Moon Dance was not exactly complicated.\u201cAlright, practice for a while, you guys. The competition will start 15 minutes later.\u201d The teacher took a glance at Xie Qiao and left temporarily.Most of them gathered to study the movements they were not familiar with.Meanwhile, Xie Qiao was simulating the teacher\u2019s dance performance in her heart.She did not have much strength and did not want to waste any of it. She would stand still if she was not required to move.\u2018Look at her. She\u2019s standing there like a piece of log. She must be dumbstruck now!\u2019 Xia Yayun was over the moon.\u2018Look at her stupid face. She wants to dance the Moon Dance? Oh, she wishes!\u2019Many people came 15 minutes later.Apart from the Orchid Courtyard\u2019s swordsmanship teacher, there seemed to be other teachers as well. Also\u2026Xie Qiao glanced through at that man\u2019s face and looked calm.\u201cSince Your Highness is passing by, why don\u2019t you watch these girls\u2019 sword practice? If you think they\u2019re good, that will mean they didn\u2019t practice this sword dance in vain,\u201d the teacher said in a teasing manner.Zhao Xuanjing glanced at Xie Qiao.\u201cThose who stood out are the participants?\u201d he asked casually.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d replied the teacher.Zhao Xuanjing was slightly stunned. Subsequently, nobody knew why he grabbed a piece of white jade with his left hand from his embrace. He tossed it onto the table, where the silver beans and hair accessories were, and said simply, \u201cFor luck.\u201dThe people gasped.The piece of jade\u2026\u201cIs this piece of jade from Your Highness one of the few that the dean gave?\u201d The teacher was stunned too.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhao Xuanjing gave a short response.The teacher fell into silence for a moment and looked at the students. She seemed to worry that some of them did not know the importance of the jade, so she added, \u201cThere are only ten pieces of jade like this. The dean gave three of them to His Highness. As long as one has this piece of jade, you can take anyone as your master in this academy or pick one item from the library.\u201dThis explanation enlightened Xie Qiao. The teacher meant they could become a master\u2019s true disciple.There were many capable people in the Royal Academy. As long as one became a disciple of any of them, it would be similar to having an additional father.The connections, knowledge, and even the master\u2019s reputation could benefit the disciple.Moreover, there were some precious extant copies and rare books in the library that money could not buy.If she could take one with her\u2026Xie Qiao was pretty moved. She could make quite some money when she sold the book after reading it.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s begin. Step up when I draw your name,\u201d the teacher said.She began to draw names as soon as she was done speaking.\u201cFirst one, Hua Lirong.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe few teachers and the Crown Prince were assigned seats. They were people holding umbrellas around them, worried that they would be burned by the sun. Even snacks were delivered a moment later.Xie Qiao did not eat much in the afternoon, so she started drooling upon seeing the snacks.Moreover\u2026 she was standing. Her legs would go weak from standing too much.The more she thought about it, the paler her face turned. In reality, in her mind, she was being very strong at the moment. She had only used a little bit of strength, but those who saw Xie Qiao\u2026 were worried that she would pass out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: Good MoodXie Qiao was really not pretending to be weak. She was born like this, and it was hard for her to hide that.Her pale face looked even weaker under the scorching sun in the afternoon.If she was under the sun while sitting, she should feel better at the moment.The Yang energy in the afternoon was pretty strong.\u201cGet the rest to sit,\u201d said Zhao Xuanjing. He peeped at the snacks before him and added, \u201cServe them the snacks too.\u201dAs soon as that was said, the teachers around felt\u2026 rather confused.\u201cWhy is Your Highness so\u2026\u201dGenerous today?\u201cDo you still think I wasn\u2019t warm enough in the past? Or do you think I used to bully the students?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing asked coldly.Xie Qiao heard that and felt this man seemed to have changed. When he had been near Floating Pavilion Town, his attitude did not seem to be this cold. He had been quite warm.\u201cNo.\u201d The eyelids of the teacher who was next to him twitched. \u201cYour Highness has always been caring toward the students in the academy. Everyone knows that.\u201dThe few teachers scoffed when they heard that.Caring?Yes, he did treat the Royal Academy students differently!The Crown Prince was wise from a young age. He was talented and smart, and the emperor loved him. However, the Crown Prince had a terrible fate. He would always get into accidents. As he would have fewer accidents at the academy, he hardly lived at the East Palace. The academy was almost his other abode!He had lived peacefully like that until he was 12.Before turning 12, the Crown Prince had been a gentle and humble man.However, a ferocious tiger had come out of nowhere when the imperial family had gone hunting one day. The Crown Prince may be young back then, but he had reacted fast. The tendons on his right arm had been destroyed, and he had been awarded the title of an Imperial Protector.His right arm looked ordinary on the daily, but he could no longer carry heavy things.Not only that, he would tremble when he held a brush.He was indeed a cripple.Since then, the Crown Prince\u2019s emotions had been rather unstable. Those teachers that he used to be close with were given the cold shoulder when they visited.The Crown Prince had also beaten many people in the academy.He had watched many student performances before, but he had never cared about those students standing down there.Not only that, there were very few of them who would pass his assessment. Most of his comments were terms like\u2014foolish, stupid, lowly, acceptable, and passable\u2026Although that was the truth, it was hurtful and humiliating.Due to his identity, the students dared not hold grudges.All of the teachers were thinking to themselves.Could it be that there was a young lady from the Orchid Courtyard that the Crown Prince was fond of?They shook their heads and rejected that thought as soon as it was formed. When the Crown Prince turned 13, the emperor had taken charge to pick a concubine for him. However, he had rejected all of them.The emperor loved this son of his. He would listen to him on minor things such as this one.A Crown Prince whose arm was crippled should have been dethroned. However, those who proposed to dethrone the Crown Prince before had long died.The teachers thought about it.The Crown Prince had recently solved a big case. Perhaps he was in a good mood.That was right.The few teachers heaved a sigh of relief.There was a platform exclusively installed on the training field, and a few young ladies were done performing.Xie Qiao could remember those dance forms perfectly after watching all of the performances.\u201cNext, Xia Yayun,\u201d the teacher said indifferently and orderly.Xia Yayun lifted her chin slightly and walked as if she was stepping on clouds and stars. She even rolled her eyes at Xie Qiao before going up.When she got onto the platform, she held a longsword and began swinging it. Her movements were pretty smooth, even though she was stuck at a few movements in between. Compared to the few before her, her performance was above average.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: Sword Is Meant For GentlemenThe Orchid Courtyard\u2019s young ladies had been taught the Moon Dance for a long time. Therefore, even Xia Yayun was not perfect while performing it. However, she would score high. Even the teachers nodded in satisfaction.The few teachers graded after she performed.The grading system was divided into three grades and nine levels.There were Excellent, Intermediate, and Low grades and each grade would divide into three levels. Therefore, the nine grades and levels were Excellent/Excellent, Excellent/Intermediate, Excellent/Low, Intermediate/Excellent, Intermediate/Intermediate, Intermediate/Low, Low/Excellent, Low/Intermediate, and Low/Low.The result usually would not differ too much when the few teachers graded together.The teacher had informed everyone how long they had just learned the Moon Dance. Therefore, they should be much looser with the grading this time.Xie Qiao thought to herself, \u2018Even if Xia Yayun cannot get an excellent grade for her performance, she will definitely get Intermediate/Excellent.\u2019\u201cXiao Qiao, you\u2019d get a low grade at most!\u201d Xia Yayun whispered to Xie Qiao as soon as she got off the platform.Before Xie Qiao could speak, they heard a question from where the teachers were sitting. \u201cWhy did you whisper?\u201dXia Yayun stumbled when she heard the voice.Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s eyes were burning. \u201cThe teachers are here. What did you whisper?\u201dThe few teachers\u2019 eyelids twitched when they heard what the Crown Prince said.The Crown Prince was still the old him.It was inevitable that the young ladies would cheer for each other when they were together. It should not matter whether they chatted, right?\u201cShe said I\u2019d get a low grade,\u201d replied Xie Qiao, looking honest.Xia Yayun\u2019s expression changed immediately, and she said in a panic, \u201cI-I was just telling her that she can\u2019t master this dance just by learning it for a day. She merely looked at it for a while today. She\u2019ll definitely perform poorly in the test. She might only get a low grade\u2014\u201d\u201cI saw that you said merely a few words. You looked fierce, not kind.\u201d Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s eyes looked grim when he said that. It was uncertain whether he was smiling.Xia Yayun shivered.Many young ladies looked at her with sympathy.If it was the Fourth Imperial Highness, even if he realized something was wrong with what she said, he would not question it directly.However, this was the Crown Prince\u2026Xia Yayun was having bad luck today.\u201cYour Highness, this lady is young. She said something wrong. Please forgive her,\u201d the teacher said immediately.Nobody kneeled in the academy. The teacher only bowed and cupped her fists, looking sincere.\u201cThe thing that she said wasn\u2019t targeted at me. It has nothing to do with me whether I forgive her or not. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t like her lying. What grade did she get?\u201d\u201cExcellent/Low,\u201d the teacher said after checking the other teachers\u2019 grading.Xie Qiaor raised her brows slightly. She did not expect the teachers to be so loose with the grading.\u2018Her mediocre performance got an excellent grade?\u2019\u201cThe sword is meant for gentlemen. Your behavior and character are questionable, so we should amend the grade,\u201d added Zhao Xuanjing.Xie Qiao nodded slowly. He was right.The sword was the king of weapons\u2014it was elegant. However, Xia Yayun\u2026 did not measure up in this aspect.At that moment, Xia Yuyan\u2019s eyes were red.She dared not argue with what the Crown Prince said. The emperor doted on him, and the Crown Prince was always a bully. Whatever the Crown Prince said, even if it did not make perfect sense, the result would remain the same.The few teachers sighed. One of them asked while looking at Xie Qiao, \u201cYoung lady, do you think we should lower Young Lady Xia\u2019s grade?\u201dIt would not matter if the grade was the only thing that was lowered.However, each grade would be recorded. They would definitely write down Xia Yayun\u2019s personal provocation as well.Moreover, her reputation might be ruined for a while for being pointed out by the Crown Prince in public.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: The Nine SyllablesXie Qiao was not scared to be stared at.\u201cGrading isn\u2019t my responsibility. I\u2019m just a student, so I shouldn\u2019t be commenting on whether her grade should be lowered or not. Make your decision, teachers,\u201d Xie Qiao said slowly.They wanted to push the blame on her?Impossible!If she nodded and agreed to lower Xia Yayun\u2019s grade, the people out there would think that she bullied Xia Yayun by relying on someone else whenever they talked about it.If she shook her head and disagreed with lowering her grade, she would be throwing the Crown Prince a cold blanket.Xie Qiao was not stupid, so she would not take the blame.Xie Qiao calmed herself down after she was done speaking. She then took small sips of tea. She looked like she was scared and had to calm herself down.Teacher Zhu, who taught Xie Qiao swordsmanship, asked, \u201cYour Highness, what grade do you think she should get?\u201dZhao Xuanjing looked relaxed as he casually said, \u201cChoose the lowest grade among the few teachers and deduct one level from it.\u201dTeacher Zhu checked the teachers\u2019 grades again.The highest grade was Excellent/Intermediate, while the lowest was Intermediate/Intermediate. The difference was pretty big.The teacher who had graded her with Intermediate/Intermediate was known to be strict. Perhaps he had never considered the duration those young ladies had taken to learn the Moon Dance. He graded them based on their performance.It would be Intermediate/Low if the grade was lowered by one level.The result was rather poor.However, it was this girl who had been insensible. She had been whispering while the Crown Prince was around, embarrassing herself. It made sense that she should be punished.Teacher Zhu amended the grade.She then proceeded to draw the next person who would compete.With the previous example, the young ladies were even more quiet and nervous now. They would try their best to achieve perfection in their expressions, smiles, and movements.Suddenly, their performance was elevated.\u201cNext, Xie Qiao,\u201d said Teacher Zhu. She was seemingly worried that the few teachers would be biased due to the outstanding students who had performed earlier, so she added, \u201cYoung Lady Xie has just enrolled in the academy. She has only watched the Moon Dance a few times today.\u201dZhao Xuanjing said nothing. He looked like he did not know Xie Qiao.Xie Qiao got up slowly and adjusted her clothing. She then walked up slowly.Although she was not so weak that the wind would blow her away, she was clearly a person with a rather unhealthy body. The teachers could not help but frown.\u2018Look at her skinny wrists. Can she really swing a spark from the sword?\u2019They were worried that she would hurt herself.Xie Qiao picked up the sword.She began\u2026The ribbon on her waist had intersecting lights flashing on the clothing she wore to the academy.At that moment, she looked like she was holding a pentagram in her hand and walking on clouds.The sword was flying and swinging like a wandering dragon in her hand. A light fragrance blew with the wind from her body. She was elegant and charismatic. All of a sudden, it was as if one saw a clear wind and bright moon. She looked out of this world.Never had they thought Xie Qiao was secretly chanting\u2026\u201cMay the presiders over warriors be my vanguard\u2026\u201dIt was The Nine Syllables.At the very end\u2026\u201cRetrieve!\u201dShe almost yelled that out.Xie Qiao looked serious. She closed her performance while many watched with shocked expressions.Xie Qiao sighed. It was exhausting to her.She bowed at the teachers while feeling dizzy, and she walked down feeling numb. She sat at her seat immediately.It was quiet around her.Xia Yayun looked at her in disbelief.\u2018Impossible! How is this possible!? The few teachers choreographed this Moon Dance for almost three months. The Peony Courtyard learned it first when the choreography was completed, and they were showing off during the last spar.\u2018The Moon Dance became famous in the academy after their performance. Even if one was to learn it, they wouldn\u2019t be able to master it within a few days!?\u2018However, her performance was\u2026\u2019Even Xia Yayun had to admit that Xie Qiao had done better than her. She had been extraordinarily majestic when she held the sword. Although she had performed a few parts differently from the original version, it was not awkward at all. Her entire movement was as smooth as flowing water.She had actually danced as well as the teachers!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: So Happy That She Passed OutXie Qiao had no idea whether her dance moves were beautiful\u2014all she knew was if there were some resentful spirits around, she would have collected all of them.Unfortunately, she did not do anything productive after dancing for so long.Moreover, she used the gaps between dancing to collect the spirits. They seemed pretty good, but in reality, most of the dance moves were just pretty. They did not help with the spirit collection.The simpler the dance moves were, the better for her body.Xie Qiao was not breathing properly, so she took a while to calm down. However, there was still ringing in her head.The few teachers were done with grading.Teacher Zhu seemed to have the intention to get her to watch more so that she could learn more. She drew her name later than the rest, so there were only a few students left after her.Since her performance, the few students\u2019 performances were rather lackluster.After everyone had performed, Teacher Zhu announced the results.Everyone\u2019s grades were being read out loud.\u201cHua Lirong, Intermediate/Intermediate.\u201cXu Ying, Intermediate/Excellent.\u201cQin Liu, Excellent/Low.\u201cFang Muxue, Excellent/Low.\u201cXia Yayun\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cXie Qiao\u2026\u201dWhen Xie Qiao\u2019s name was read, everyone could not help but lift their heads in nervousness. They had all watched her performance, so they naturally knew that she had not performed as they had imagined. Her grading might be the highest one\u2026\u201c\u2026Excellent/Excellent.\u201dTeacher Zhu said, \u201cShe\u2019s the winner of the competition this time.\u201dMany sighed as soon as she said that.Some were unwilling but helpless. The reason being they knew that their performance was indeed incomparable to Xie Qiao\u2019s.Xie Qiao was a little dumbstruck. She drank a mouthful of tea.\u201cXie Qiao, this is your reward. Come and accept it.\u201d Teacher Zhu\u2019s voice was very gentle.\u2018She\u2019s a good seed, but she\u2019s a little too skinny and weak. I wonder if she can train to be stronger.\u2019The pale-faced Xie Qiao stood up upon hearing that. A small bowl of silver beans welcomed her.She walked forward.Thump!She felt dizzy as she walked a few steps more and then fell directly and passed out.Zhao Xuanjing got up immediately and wanted to go to her by instinct. He suddenly thought it was inappropriate, so he said, \u201cTeacher Zhu, why aren\u2019t you getting someone to bring the doctor here?\u201dTeacher Zhu was a little stunned.\u2018H-how did she pass out when she was doing all fine earlier!?\u2019Teacher Zhu got someone to get the doctor immediately.\u201cCan it be that Xie Qiao passed out from\u2026 joy?\u201d said someone, their timing bad.\u201cMaybe. I heard Xie Qiao didn\u2019t have silver beans to buy lunch in the afternoon. She took her sister\u2019s silver beans. I\u2019m sure you know her sister? That little girl who loves silver beans. Her name\u2019s Xie Xi, and she\u2019s a Pixiu.\u201d\u201cShe took her sister\u2019s silver beans? She must be starving then?\u201d\u201cThe sword dance she performed was amazing. It was nothing lesser than the performance from the Peony Courtyard. Do you think we crossed the line earlier?\u201d\u201cI think so\u2026\u201d\u201cHer sister is such a poor thing. That girl is retarded. She might be crying somewhere since her sister took her silver beans\u2026\u201d Someone was slow to react to that. She was shaking her head and sighing.The rest turned their heads to look at her.That girl Xie Xi\u2026She was from the Begonia Courtyard. Everyone knew her\u2014she was a hardworking girl.Although her reputation was lacking, she was dumb and cute. The senior sisters, like them, pitied her.\u201cI heard\u2026 The Xie family is very poor. My mother has said a few times that I\u2019ll need to pay my own dowry if I have an ill destiny to be marrying into a family like the Xie family. I didn\u2019t believe that before, but now\u2026That seems to be the case. Xie Qiao grew up outside in the past, and my house is quite close to hers. I heard that her parents don\u2019t like her, maybe\u2026 She didn\u2019t eat and sleep well at home. That\u2019s why she was so happy that she passed out when she saw so many silver beans.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94: BeggarMany young ladies knew that the Xie family used to be bandits. However, they knew nothing much about their other private matters.Now that they heard the family was poor, their curiosity was piqued.\u201cLook at that girl, Xie Xi. She\u2019s a fourth-grade official\u2019s family\u2019s young mistress, but she does things that a maid does. It must be that the family is too poor, right?\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense. That Master Xie is a general, after all. I heard he obtained many rewards when he fought the barbarians back then. Even without those, his salary would be quite high as a fourth-grade official, right?\u201d The rest could not believe that.The young lady asked, \u201cDo your families only depend on your father and brothers to support the family?\u201dThe rest naturally shook their heads when they heard that.They had many servants at home. It would be insufficient to depend on their father and brothers\u2019 salaries.Only with the farms their fathers and brothers run at home, as well as the properties and rewards accumulated for years, could they have steady support for the people at home.As they thought about it, they understood why the Xie family was poor.It had only been a short time since they had become officials. They spent more money than they made.\u201cI heard that General Xie spent his silver to buy his official position. I\u2019m sure you guys know about Eldest Young Master Xie. He had the eligibility to enter the academy when he came to the Imperial City during earlier years, but he didn\u2019t. Why was that? Naturally, it was because they didn\u2019t have money nor treasures! The Xie family had to tighten its belt to send the two young ones here\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. General Xie used silvers to send Xie Pinghuai and Xie Xi here back then. He was so unwilling he was staring at the silvers as if he had never seen them before!\u201d\u201cThe family\u2019s mistress did not come from a reputable family as well. I heard that the family does business, which means they have silver. I wonder how much they paid for the dowry.\u201d\u201cThat Lu family shouldn\u2019t have given much of a dowry. She married a second time, after all. The granny who works at my home heard that from their servant when they met each other on the street.\u201d\u201cNow it seems\u2026 Xie Qiao is quite pitiful.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. She wasn\u2019t born in a loving family, nor was she raised by General Xie. Now that the stepmother is managing the house, what\u2019s left for her?\u201d\u201cIf she\u2019s so happy by getting that little amount of silver beans, I wonder what she is like at home. Please don\u2019t tell me that she isn\u2019t given a monthly allowance!?\u201dThe people revealed looks of sympathy when they heard that.However, Xia Yayun could not help but snicker.\u2018Beggar!\u2019At that moment, someone carried Xie Qiao into a room.Zhao Xuanjing was a man, and given his unique identity, it would be inappropriate if he followed. He had his eyes on the white jade for luck and said, \u201cSince that lady is the brightest of all, get her to bring the white jade to me when she wakes up.\u201dThe people did not think too much into it. There were only a few pieces of such a jade. Xie Qiao was very fortunate. It made sense that the Crown Prince wanted to ask her who she was going to take as her master.Two imperial doctors entered the room.Master Lu, Teacher Zhu, and the other grannies responsible for taking care of the young ladies in the academy were waiting there.\u201cHow did she pass out suddenly?\u201d Master Lu asked while looking at Xie Qiao\u2019s pale face.Teacher Zhu felt rather awkward. \u201cShe merely danced with a sword\u2026\u201d\u201cMerely danced with a sword?\u201d The imperial doctor turned his head to look at Teacher Zhu, \u201cWhat are you talking about!? It isn\u2019t an exaggeration to call this young lady a walking dead. Her insides are weak. It\u2019s unbelievable that she\u2019s been alive to this day!\u201dMaster Lu and Teacher Zhu were stunned when they heard that.\u201cIs it that bad!?\u201d Teacher Zhu was really shocked.\u201cThere\u2019s not much vitality in her body, and her Yang energy is weak. She needs more rest daily and shouldn\u2019t exhaust herself,\u201d the imperial doctor added.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: Poor Soul With A Short LifeTeacher Zhu found it inconceivable when she heard that. That girl had been majestic when she was dancing with the sword earlier. Nothing seemed wrong with her?!However, she had suddenly seemed to have changed after stopping, as if her body had been emptied.Master Lu was sighing.The young lady was\u2026 hardworking. She was serious in the classes in the past few days. Master Lu had passed by her twice and noticed that this young lady had memorized what he had said. She was sensible and serious. If she was a man, she would score with flying colors even if she took the imperial examination!\u2018I can\u2019t believe that her body is so weak.\u2019Two young ladies from the Orchid Courtyard came over too.They had heard everything the doctor said and were shocked.Too pitiful!Never mind that she was not loved and being raised outside despite being General Xie\u2019s daughter, but now she was unhealthy and had a short life!?They suddenly felt extremely guilty upon recalling they had been criticizing and wronging this Young Lady Xie!Did they do something extraordinarily vicious?When Xie Qiao opened her eyes, she noticed many people looking at her. They had strange expressions on their faces.\u201cYoung Lady Xie\u2026\u201d Fang Muxue looked guilty. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201dXie Qiao was speechless.\u2018What?\u2019She was dumbfounded.She seemed to have fallen earlier due to her weak body, right? It was not someone who hit her, was it?Then why was this person apologizing to her?Xie Qiao looked over in confusion, but she was not paying attention.\u201cOh,\u201d she responded faintly.Fang Muxue felt very guilty. \u201cYoung Lady Xie, we deserve it if you\u2019re blaming us. W-we didn\u2019t know that your body was so weak. If we knew, we wouldn\u2019t have\u2026 said those things about you.\u201dXie Qiao understood now\u2014these young ladies pitied her due to her weak body.As the saying went, \u201cThe weak wins.\u201dXie Qiao nodded and said in an indifferent tone, \u201cWhat was said is in the past. It\u2019s futile for you to say these now.\u201dFang Muxue and the other young lady were stunned.\u201cXie Qiao, your body is extremely weak, so you might not be able to attend swordsmanship class from now on. Not only swordsmanship, but you\u2019ll have to quit all of the other martial arts classes as well!\u201d said Master Lu.\u201cTeacher, can I just watch when I get to class next time?\u201d asked Xie QiaoPerhaps her body in this life was just too terrible. Therefore, she would think that she was lucky to be able to live one more day.Back in the Taoist temple, she had not stayed idle for even a day, no matter how terrible she was feeling.She would practice Taoism\u2019s method of collecting souls when she could move. She would practice it for a little bit until she saw some improvement and read when she could not move.If she felt uncomfortable using her brain, she would do something with her hands.Just like that, she had been getting herself busy for days and years to make herself feel alive.She did not want to wait for death in bed.Moreover, her illness was different from others.In the academy, her strength was pretty good, and she even excelled in swordsmanship. In reality, she was eager to learn, but her body did not allow rigorous practice. However, she could memorize with her head. She would play with the sword for a little bit when her health was better.However, what Xie Qiao said became different when Fang Muxue and the rest heard it.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to earn silver beans in a rush. It\u2019s bad for your health. We\u2019ll help with the donation\u2026\u201d Fang Muxue said out of kindness.Xie Qiao looked at her in an odd manner. \u201cYoung Lady Fang, and everyone else, is your dignity and kindness that cheap?\u201dFang Muxue trembled.Xie Qiao was not mad. On the contrary, she thought it was funny.They said everything bad and good. So what was Xie Qiao to them? A lamb that was waiting to be slaughtered or a fish that was on the chopping board?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: Big ProfitXie Qiao knew that she was talking to a young lady whose thoughts were simpler. She purely expressed her emotions and did not think too much into it.They were not like her, an old Taoist master who was at peace. She was rather cold compared to them.However, she indeed did not bother to squeeze a gentle smile and said, \u201cIt is okay\u201d, while smiling at everyone\u2026It would hurt her teeth.Fang Muxue and the rest felt rather embarrassed.They looked awkward.Xie Qiao did not comfort them. She was too lazy.Master Lu was happy to see her expression that looked like she was hungry for knowledge. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll talk to the teachers later to prioritize your health in class. Just do your best.\u201d\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Xie Qiao.Her head was much clearer now that she passed out for a little bit. She was not as exhausted as before.\u201cRight, you won the competition. You should thank His Highness for rewarding you with the jade. Don\u2019t forget that after resting for a while,\u201d added Teacher Zhu.\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Xie Qiao was confused.\u201cHis Highness has a courtyard in the academy. It\u2019s the one in the far east. You\u2019ll get there after passing a bamboo forest,\u201d replied Teacher Zhu.\u2018Bamboo forest?\u2019Xie Qiao raised her brows lightly.The Crown Prince\u2019s physique was unique. Most people from the imperial family would have dragon energy on their bodies. Since he was the Crown Prince, he should have pretty powerful dragon energy. However, he had been attracting ghouls his whole life. Nobody knew why.If one was to think about it, if not for the dragon energy\u2019s protection, he would have been affected by spirits and died.It was bad for such a body type to be living close to bamboo.Trees lived by absorbing water, and most of them had Yin attributes. Meanwhile, bamboo\u2026 were hollowed, and they despised the sun. Therefore, just like the Scholar Tree, they had extreme Yin attributes and should not be suitable for the Crown Prince.Xie Qiao had never seen the bamboo forest, so she should not comment on anything.The imperial doctor checked her pulse again. Upon realizing that her pulse was much better than before, he asked if he should get her medicine prescription.She definitely had been consuming medicine to be able to live until now with such a weak body. That imperial doctor knew that very well, so he did not dare to prescribe her a new one to prevent her from eating something that would clash with her current medicine.One had to pay for the medicine with silver beans at the academy.They could pay at a later time.Xie Qiao shook her head.She then recalled her reward, \u201cWhere are my silver beans?\u201dTeacher Zhu brought the items feeling helpless.They were gold-plated jade pieces consisting of three combs, a pair of hairpins, two dangling ornaments, and two forehead accessories. They looked pretty expensive.However, sophisticated accessories were prohibited in the academy. They even had to wear standard ones.Xie Qiao could sell those items, so she put them away happily.She held the bowl of silver beans and counted slowly. There were 60 pieces!It was a big profit.Xie Qiao was satisfied and put the silver beans into her small purse. Since that was the case, she would not have to worry about not being able to pay the loan she got from her sister.Then it was that piece of white jade.There was warmth when she held it. The quality was good, and it would be beneficial for one\u2019s health if they were to wear it all the time.Xie Qiao\u2019s imagination was running wild as she stared at the piece of jade.\u2018Get myself a master? No way!\u2019There were many classes at the academy that she already did not have enough time to attend. There was no need to get a master to teach her a certain subject. A master would usually be unhappy if their disciples studied something different. If they found out that she had a wide range of interests, she would definitely be punished.Exchange it for an expensive treasure?She could do that or sell it to someone else\u2026 Now that she thought about it, there should be many people who were willing to purchase the identity of a master\u2019s disciple?Many thoughts had flashed in Xie Qiao\u2019s head within a short period.She rested in the room for a little while.The teachers and the imperial doctors had left. The two grannies were the only ones left to serve her tea.After resting for an hour, Xie Qiao was ready to look for the Crown Prince.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: He Did Not Con YouXie Qiao did not walk fast and would rest for a bit after walking a few steps. She walked slowly from the room to the Crown Prince\u2019s East Courtyard.It was not considered too far, but it took her over two hours to get there.Zhao Xuanjing had been waiting for a long time over there.\u201cHas Young Lady Xie really woken up?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing asked while frowning.\u201cYes, she has since earlier\u2026\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou was rather confused too. The Crown Prince\u2019s message should have been sent over long ago. How come she was not there yet?The Crown Prince looked cold. He thought about it and lifted his feet to walk outside.Xie Qiao was in the bamboo forest.It was a huge eerie forest. There would be loud rustling noises whenever the tiniest wind blew.Suddenly, a shadow flew by Xie Qiao\u2019s eyes.She closed her eyes and sighed. The academy was huge. She speculated that there were only ghouls in this bamboo forest.It was\u2026 annoying.She should not have come.It was just too annoying.She did not have any strength to subdue ghouls today, so she slapped a talisman on her body directly. It was a very complicated talisman. She initially wanted to save it for the future, as it was difficult to inscribe a talisman after all.Xie Qiao could still see the ghouls after pasting the talisman. However, they dared not stay close to her. She could finally walk peacefully.The rustling bamboo leaves were like the ghouls clapping.I clapped, you clapped. Countless children were playing.Xie Qiao walked, looking numb.\u201cYoung Lady Xie.\u201d A man\u2019s voice sounded after a while.It was a familiar voice. Without even lifting her head to look, Xie Qiao knew it was the Crown Prince. She bowed like how people did in the academy calmly and said, \u201cXie Qiao is here to thank Your Highness.\u201dOne would not really emphasize appellation in the academy.If the Crown Prince was studying at the academy, it would not be taboo for Xie Qiao to call his name directly.Seeing that she laid her head low, Zhao Xuanjing asked, \u201cHow\u2019s your health, Young Lady Xie?\u201d\u201cPretty good,\u201d Xie Qiao said coldly.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou\u2019s eyelids twitched. This young lady did not have much to say?It felt cold to be chatting with her!\u201cI invited Young Lady Xie here for something else.\u201d Zhao Xuanjing was straightforward too. \u201cYoung Lady Xie had told my subordinate\u2019s fortune before. There seems to be something filthy lingering around him. I wonder if you can check on him?\u201dXie Qiao lifted her head in surprise upon hearing that. \u201cThat man is still alive?\u201dImperial Bodyguard Zhou\u2019s eyelids twitched.Zhao Xuanjing was dumbfounded for a moment.The people of the world would show their kind side no matter how unkind they were.However, this Xie Qiao directly told him that she knew that Qin Zhi would definitely die back then, and she had not bothered about that fact?\u201cHe was in luck to have obtained some great talismans from Young Lady Xie\u2019s master to be still alive. However, he\u2019s very ill now. If there\u2019s still no cure, he\u2019s going to see King Yama soon,\u201d explained Zhao Xuanjing.Xie Qiao nodded. \u201cSo it was my master, no wonder. I suppose he spent a lot of money on that?\u201dImperial Bodyguard Zhou\u2019s eyes opened wide.This young lady really dared to say anything.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou said helplessly, \u201cYoung Lady Xie, back then\u2026 We indeed spent a lot of money\u2026\u201dHe had been the one that had paid!That Mo Lingzi\u2019s fee was much higher than this disciple of his! Some ten talismans cost over 100 taels of silvers. Back then, Half-Immortal Xie had only charged a couple of copper coins for one talisman!\u201cTalismans are rare. I\u2019m sure you guys bought many to be able to protect him until now. The more you bought, the less my master would have in store. It takes effort to inscribe talismans. In reality\u2026 he didn\u2019t con you for charging you at a high price,\u201d Xie Qiao said slowly.She tried her best not to sound guilty.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to think that,\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou said immediately. \u201cYoung Lady Xie and your master saved Qin Zhi. I\u2019m grateful.\u201dXie Qiao lifted her head and asked while looking at Imperial Bodyguard Zhou with her bright eyes, \u201cWas it you guys who left the note for me earlier? I remember it was written\u2026 100 taels of gold to save a life?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: Are You Provoking Me?Xie Qiao thought about it. There were not many people who would need her to save their life. Since Qin Zhi was still alive, it was probably him.As expected, Imperial Bodyguard Zhou nodded.\u201cYoung Lady Xie has a strict family, so we didn\u2019t dare to disturb you. We thought we would send you a letter, but we didn\u2019t manage to see you,\u201d said Imperial Bodyguard Zhou.Zhao Xuanjing glared at Zhou Weizong. He could not believe that there was something that he was unaware of.Xie Qiao smiled lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s great that it was you guys. Since that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll take it. I wonder when will you pay the deposit?\u201dShe was definitely gentle enough when serving her clients.\u201cY-you\u2019ll take it!?\u201d Imperial Bodyguard Zhou jolted. \u201cThank you, Young Lady Xie! H-how much is the deposit?\u201d\u201cThe usual deposit would be half of the fee. You guys will pay for other fees if there\u2019s any in-between. When the deal is completed, you\u2019ll pay for the remaining half,\u201d Xie Qiao said while smiling.100 taels of gold\u2014it was a big client.She could buy better tonics with that amount of money.Xie Qiao\u2019s small face blushed a little as she thought about it.Zhou Weizong frowned slightly when he heard that.Xie Qiao looked at him in confusion upon noticing that he looked troubled. \u201cWas it a lie that you guys promised to pay 100 taels of gold to save a life?\u201cIf it\u2019s just a regular ghoul, I\u2019d collect them even if there\u2019s no money involved. However, it\u2019s different for that friend of yours. It was him who offended the ghoul. He owed it something, so he deserves it that the ghoul is trying to kill him.\u201d Xie Qiao frowned. \u201cAre you forcing me to capture the soul, Your Highness?\u201dZhao Xuanjing gave off an intimidating aura.In reality, His Highness looked pretty handsome. His skin color was not pale but a healthy wheat color. He had a slender body with a high spirit. In her eyes, he had a sparkly, lucky face.He had an inexorable fate back at Floating Pavilion Town. Therefore, his luck was rather dull. However, it was much brighter now.His charisma was brilliant, like an ancient jade\u2014one would remember him forever after seeing him.Putting anthroposcopy aside, the Crown Prince\u2019s looks could charm people\u2019s money. If Xie Qiao could, it would be ideal for her to own him.Naturally, she dared not think of nonsense.He was the Crown Prince, so she could not get him to have children with her.She sighed softly.\u201cIt\u2019s not me who needs saving, so I\u2019m not the one who will be paying. If they can\u2019t afford it, Young Lady Xie will decide what to do.\u201d Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s voice was faint. He was like a green pine tree all year round, and even time could not wither him.Xie Qiao had heard that the Crown Prince was loved. If she was the emperor, she would dote on this son as well. There was no other reason for that than the fact that he was handsome.\u201cW-we have gold, but we need time to gather them. I wonder if Young Lady Xie can treat him first, and we\u2019ll pay later? We guarantee we only need three days at most to gather the gold,\u201d Zhou Weizong said immediately.\u201cI suppose you come from a noble family to be able to be the Crown Prince\u2019s close bodyguard?\u201d Xie Qiao said slowly.Zhou Weizong smiled helplessly. \u201cYes, but I shouldn\u2019t ask for money from home at such an age.\u201dThat made sense.Xie Qiao nodded.Xie Qiao showed three fingers. \u201cIf His Highness can be the guarantor, then I\u2019ll give you three days.\u201dZhao Xuanjing raised his brows and said condescendingly, \u201cWill you not save him if I\u2019m not the guarantor? Saving a life is more meritorious than building a seven-floor pagoda, Young Lady Xie.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, I think\u2026\u201d Xie Qiao was very serious, \u201cYou should read more.\u201dZhao Xuanjing was stunned.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about Buddhism in the presence of a Taoism exponent. Are you provoking my\u2026 master?\u201d Xie Qiao lifted her eyes to look at him. \u201cWhat you said came from the Chinese Buddhist Canon.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: Depends On YouIn reality, Xie Qiao knew a little bit of everything. Buddhism aside, she even knew some of the passages from White Lotus that were popular among the folk.\u201cI heard you wrote Sanskrit for your entry examination,\u201d Zhao Xuanjing said steadily while looking calm.\u201cThat was me mastering the opposition\u2019s language while you\u2019re doing it intentionally. The meaning is different,\u201d Xie Qiao said in an upset manner. She added slowly, \u201cIf you\u2019re unwilling to be the guarantor, I definitely won\u2019t save this person. Do you guys think it\u2019s easy to summon spirits? It\u2019s actually exhausting. I might harm my own life if I\u2019m reckless.\u201dZhao Xuanjing\u2019s eyes were a little cold. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so much when you\u2019re weak. I think you\u2019re seeking death.\u201dXie Qiao scoffed.When he had \u201cbegged\u201d her back then, his attitude had been completely different. He would call her Young Lady Xie all the time, and his face had almost been buried into the ground!Xie Qiao laid her head low and said softly, \u201cYou\u2019re better at seeking death than I do, Your Highness.\u201dImperial Bodyguard Zhou\u2019s body tensed up.\u2018No! Can you guys stop fighting!? There\u2019s someone that needs saving at home. If you guys fall out now, we\u2019re losing a life!\u2019\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Zhao Xuanjing was cold.Xie Qiao did not hide it and pointed at the bamboo forest. \u201cThis, it\u2019s unsuitable for you. It\u2019s bad for your health to be living here for a long time.\u201dXie Qiao lifted her eyes and smiled after she was done speaking.That smile was warm and a little provoking. She seemed to be showing how kind she was. \u201cIf Your Highness will be the guarantor, you\u2019ll have to pay if he doesn\u2019t. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll draw a chart that\u2019s beneficial for your health. By then, get people to plant flowers according to the chart. I guarantee Your Highness to be as energetic as a dragon and tiger\u2026\u201dXie Qiao stopped as she spoke to this point.She was usually slow when she spoke. She hardly spoke so smoothly like that and accidentally said something wrong.However\u2026 that made sense.Xie Qiao peeped at Zhao Xuanjing\u2019s body discreetly. He was secretly hurt and suddenly a little furious now. What did she mean by guaranteeing him to be as energetic as a dragon and tiger? She was saying as if he was weak now!\u201cYoung Lady Xie sure is daring to speak what she has in mind,\u201d Zhao Xuanjing said, not sure if she was smiling.\u201cStop teasing me, Your Highness. I\u2019m inexperienced since I came from a Taoist temple\u2026\u201d Xie Qiao smiled awkwardly.There were barely any men at the Water Moon Temple.Her master was a rude drunkard. He would not talk about anything else apart from daily teachings. Moreover, she had sharp eyes. She would hold down her head as much as possible. When the Water Moon Temple was opening, all she saw was skirts.It had been 16 years!It was as if she had really become a monk, and she never had any thoughts on the worldly matter. She would think that she had done everything she could to honor her master. Now she was wronged to be peeping at a handsome man.She was being humble, but Zhao Xuanjing kept thinking that there was underlying meaning in what she said.He turned his head to look at the eerie bamboo forest. \u201cIs there a fee for Young Lady Xie to fix the bamboo forest for me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2026 depends on you. There\u2019s no obligation.\u201d Xie Qiao looked serious. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s only fair to pay for fortune-telling, or you\u2019ll attract disasters for owing too many favors. So I suggest you to\u2026 pay some.\u201d\u2018Pay some, is it?\u2019Zhao Xuanjing grinned. \u201cDeal.\u201dXie Qiao nodded in satisfaction.Naturally, it was great to develop her business. It was not that she really wanted the Crown Prince\u2019s money. She mainly wanted him to be the guarantor.Initially, Xie Qiao had horseback archery class in the afternoon. However, since she had passed out, it was natural that she would skip the class. She was ready to get into the carriage to go to the address Imperial Bodyguard Zhou gave.It was two streets away from the Xie residence, a mediocre-sized courtyard.Imperial Bodyguard Zhou had arrived before she did. He waited at the door with a few comrades. They were smiling in a manner to butter her up, giving her goosebumps immediately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: I Don\u2019t Want To Touch HimMost people were natural when they smiled. However, most of these bodyguards had cold and masculine faces. They looked uglier than they were crying when they smiled. Their faces were distorted.To Xie Qiao, they looked like the database she had created had been attacked by a virus, and it had collapsed.\u201cDon\u2019t smile.\u201d Xie Qiao frowned slightly.Zhou Weizong and the rest stopped smiling immediately. \u201cDid you see something, Half-Immortal? Can it be that the ghoul has a strange fetish?\u201dWhen they thought about it, Qin Zhi was considered the person who smiled the most among the group\u2026\u201cNo, you guys are too ugly when you smile. It doesn\u2019t match with your bones. You\u2019ll grow wrinkles if you do that for a long time. If you have wrinkles, your fate will change.\u201d Xie Qiao sighed in all seriousness.Zhou Weizong\u2019s eyelids twitched.If he had not invited her here himself, he would suspect that he had encountered a swindler. She sure was full of nonsense.\u201cHalf-Immortal Xie, is there really something on Qin Zhi?\u201d asked Zhou Weizong.The rest looked at her curiously.Back at the Water Moon Temple, they could not see it when Mo Lingzi had said there was something on Qin Zhi. Therefore, they had been a little doubtful about it.However, it had been so long. They had visited many doctors, but they could not treat him. They were more confident in what Mo Lingzi said now.Xie Qiao nodded in all seriousness. \u201cYes, there\u2019s a water ghoul.\u201d\u201cBut Qin Zhi is a good man. How did he attract such a thing? Moreover, Young Lady Xie said that he deserves it. I wouldn\u2019t dare to agree with that, as Qin Zhi had never done anything bad,\u201d Zhou Weizong said immediately.Xie Qiao lifted her head slightly. \u201cHow would you know if he has never done anything bad? Are you a worm in his tummy?\u201dZhou Weizong was rendered speechless while the corner of his lips twitched.She was talking about his brother?They arrived in the bedroom as they spoke.Before Xie Qiao came, she had dropped by the Xie residence for a while. She had her bamboo box and Da Xiong with her now.The chicken\u2019s feathers stood up when they entered the house. Everyone felt a chill on their back witnessing that.\u201cYoung Lady Xie\u2026\u201d Zhou Weizong\u2019s tone was a little stiff now.He was a man, so he should not be afraid. However, ghouls and monsters were not like bad people. It was scary because they could not see it!Xie Qiao had her eyes above the bed curtain.There was a powerful thing over there. It was absorbing human energy above. Subsequently, it flew down quickly and passed by the rest\u2019s ears. There seemed to be an eerie wind that blew.Flutter\u2026Da Xiong suddenly flapped its wings twice, and the water ghoul was slapped away when it passed by Xie Qiao.The people gulped by instinct upon seeing the bed curtain sway twice.Xie Qiao squatted down to look for something in the bamboo box.After rummaging for a while, she obtained a stack of talismans. She looked through the talismans and picked one eventually. She passed it to Zhou Weizong. \u201cPaste it on Qin Zhi\u2019s chest.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go yourself, Half-Immortal?\u201d Zhou Weizong asked instinctively.\u201cImperial Bodyguard Zhou\u2026 I suppose you don\u2019t have a wife yet?\u201d Xie Qiao looked at him with a complicated expression. \u201cQin Zhi is a man, I don\u2019t want to touch him.\u201dIt was just an excuse.The ghoul was riding on Qin Zhi\u2019s neck. The Yin energy was too strong, so she wanted to stay far away from it.Zhou Weizong had strong Yang energy. It was nothing for him to lose a little Yang energy from doing that. He could replenish it after eating something with strong Yang Fire or soaking himself in the sun.Zhou Weizong said immediately with guilt, \u201cI forgot Half-Immortal\u2019s identity\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dHe walked forward immediately in big steps after saying that.It was strange. The talisman had no glue, but it was pasted on Qin Zhi\u2019s body.\u201cI\u2019m stabilizing his Life-Destiny Ethereal Soul to prevent it from being scared away. If that happens, everything will be futile by then.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
