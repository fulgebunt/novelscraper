Finally, when it seemed like those memories could no longer be poured down, a hammer was then used to ruthlessly hammer in the excess left over.\u201cWu\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu Zi Yan let out a moan of pain as he cradled his head and rolled around on the floor.He had never before thought that he would be someone who was afraid of pain, but the kind of soul tearing pain happening right now was really quite frightful.\u201cFuck!\u201d Xu Zi Yan rolled around for approximately a minute before that acute pain suddenly disappeared as if it was never there in the first place.He weakly cursed a bit as he lay paralyzed on the ground, his body so soft it felt akin to cotton.The memories that were just forcefully pumped into him began to do their proper duties. Scene after scene appeared as if he was watching a film, and like that he finished watching a man\u2019s whole life. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that this man and him had the same appearance, he would have really just treated it as watching a movie.Forcefully propping himself up so he could get up from the ground, the glare of the sunlight made him slightly squint. Lifting up a hand covered in the granules of crushed stones, although he already had a premonition, Xu Zi Yan still couldn\u2019t help but blurt out a curse: \u201cFuck!\u201dThe palm in front of him was very beautiful. Slender but powerful, a tiny bit of calluses could be seen from the tips of the fingers to the hollow of the palm. Thus, the owner of the hand ought to not be one of those pampered young masters.Of course, it would have been even better if the palm didn\u2019t look as if it was the size of an eleven or twelve year old\u2019s. Then Xu Zi Yan would have very happily acknowledged that he had just sleep-walked into this part of the forest, and so could very quickly return home.\u201cDamn\u2026\u2026I was clearly just sleeping at home!\u201d Xu Zi Yan covered his face and slumped to the ground in defeat.The sunlight that wiggled through in between his fingers only made him feel more irritated, and he suddenly aimed a fist at the ground: \u201cDamn it!\u201dMaking a \u2018thud\u2019 noise, the punch he had used to vent with had instead smashed out a gigantic pit in the ground.Xu Zi Yan was slightly dazed as he stared at that big pit, before he turned his gaze back to his fist and gulped with difficulty.Although he knew that this was a cultivation world from the memories of the man who had the same appearance as him, however, the way a casual hit could create such a big hole, wasn\u2019t it still a bit excessive?Forget it, he himself had already turned into a small child, so what else could not happen to him?Letting out a sigh, he stood up with a lot of effort. Other than the memories in his head, he currently did not know where he was, and he also did not know how he had appeared here. But the most frightening thing was how he did not even know who he himself was.Uh\u2026\u2026alright, you couldn\u2019t say that he completely had no clue. Though he usually didn\u2019t read those xuanhuan1 fiction stories, that didn\u2019t stop a mother with nothing to do from discussing their plots. To transmigrate ah, to cultivate ah, these kind of things couldn\u2019t be considered as foreign to him.Combined with those memories that had just sprouted in his head, there was a ninety percent chance that he had just transmigrated into the body of the man who had the same appearance as him.Just\u2026\u2026Lowering his head to look at his own body, Xu Zi Yan silently wiped his face. The feeling of growing up again was really quite depressing!His brain was still feeling a bit bloated, so he used force to shake his head and finally felt a bit better.Hmm? What was this?Xu Zi Yan\u2019s eyes widened in amazement. Before his very eyes was a square-shaped empty space floating in midair.This space seemed to be separated from the space in reality, for when he attempted to move a bit, the space followed his movements. It was like having a fifty centimeters-squared invisible box that floated right in front of you.Within this box was a single book, so Xu Zi Yan very naturally reached in to take that book out.This book was a paperback edition, and looked like a very ordinary novel. If you ignored the four men tangled together on the front cover, it was indeed very normal.Xu Zi Yan saw this cover and couldn\u2019t stop the corner of his eye from twitching. Being a good man with a gay younger brother, in order to understand Xu Zi Yu\u2019s heart at that time, he didn\u2019t skimp out on using a lot of effort to research these things.Later, after confirming that Xu Zi Yu became a homosexual naturally and wasn\u2019t misguided by others into becoming one, Xu Zi Yan gave up the idea of trying to set his younger brother back onto a straight path.After all, a person\u2019s fundamental essence was impossible to alter. If it had been someone who had maliciously led him it would have still been possible to change back, but if it was innate \u2014 let\u2019s just wash up earlier and go to sleep ah2.Despite how he was normally not fond of reading those erotic novels, this book had suddenly appeared. It was obviously not considered as something from this world, so Xu Zi Yan inevitably succumbed to his curiosity and flipped open a page.The thickness of this book was moderate, so Xu Zi Yan spent approximately three hours to thoroughly read through the book once.After finishing, and combining it with the memories that were forcefully pushed onto him, Xu Zi Yan felt himself completely go crazy.He had guessed that he transmigrated, but he would have never thought that the place he transmigrated to wasn\u2019t some impractical world, but was actually the inside of some novel.Ah, according to the contents of the book, he could still be reluctantly considered as one of the story\u2019s main male leads!Thinking back to the book\u2019s (past) Xu Zi Yan\u2019s life, he only wanted to comment using the two words: \u2018damn it!\u2019.Born to an enormous cultivation family and as the Clan Head\u2019s eldest son of the first wife, together with the Lightning Heavenly Spiritual Vein3, this was an adequate portrayal of a winner in life.Yet though he clearly had such great conditions, he always made life difficult for his own younger brother.Speaking of this younger brother, it was another one of those clich\u00e9 and melodramatic dramas.The contents only consisted of Xu Zi Yan\u2019s father having a \u2018true love\u2019 in the olden days, both of them childhood sweethearts who had an affinity for each other. For the Clan\u2019s interests, however, Xu Xiao\u2019s father forced Xu Xiao to marry Xu Zi Yan\u2019s mother, and that \u2018true love\u2019 was forced away to distant and foreign lands.But nobody expected that this \u2018true love\u2019, before leaving, had sex with Xu Xiao once. This resulted in a fruit being bore in secret, before she gave birth to their son Xu Zi Rong.If that \u2018true love\u2019 had just good-naturedly taken the money to bring up her son, that would have been fine. Unfortunately, a man who is never content is like a snake trying to swallow an elephant, and though this \u2018true love\u2019 had taken the break-up money, it wasn\u2019t enough for her. Instead she wanted to, through this son, regain the love of Xu Xiao.The end result was that this \u2018true love\u2019 died under her own greed, and Xu Zi Rong was taken back by Xu Xiao to be raised in the Xu family.It is reasonable to say that Xu Zi Rong\u2019s identity would never be able to threaten Xu Zi Yan. Finding some corner to casually raise him would have been no problem.Yet for some reason, (past) Xu Zi Yan just did not like him. For both big matters and nonexistent ones, he would always find faults and mistreat Xu Zi Rong and he even hinted to the Clan children to go and bully him. Every time he saw this kind of scene in his memory, Xu Zi Yan felt extremely irritable. Towards such a soft and sticky little child, how could you harden your heart and lay down your hand??Something that was even more infuriating was that in the middle of those memories, as the father of Xu Zi Rong, Xu Xiao actually did not care about this child one bit. He was completely uncaring about how his eldest son bullied his youngest every day. There was even a time where (past) Xu Zi Yan pushed a barely ten years old Xu Zi Rong into a snake valley and he nearly lost his life, yet Xu Xiao only lightly scolded Xu Zi Yan a bit.When he saw that, had it not been the fact that Xu Zi Yan was completely unable to change the events in a memory, he really wanted to rush up and give that old bastard a few slaps on the face.Fuck! If you don\u2019t like him you shouldn\u2019t have fathered him!You birthed a child but you didn\u2019t bother giving them enough love, so it was no wonder how in the end Xu Zi Rong grew up crooked. Turning toward devil arts cultivation, he even killed the whole Xu family as a blood sacrifice. Even though he knew that there were many in the Xu family who were innocent, however, if there was a chance Xu Zi Yan really wanted to tell Xu Xiao the words: served you right!Fortunately, at that time the (past) Xu Zi Yan was out travelling, or else he would probably be exterminated as well. After that, (past) Xu Zi Yan looked everywhere for Xu Zi Rong to exact revenge, and in the process he met a man named Bai Hua. Seeing Bai Hua for the first time, (past) Xu Zi Yan became attracted to his elegant beauty and began to frantically pursue him.However, he would never have thought that after he and Bai Hua experienced all sorts of twists and turns before promising each other a life-long marriage, he finally found out that Bai Hua already had two lovers, and he was only the third.After (past) Xu Zi Yan got through a painful time of tangled confusion, he still could not forget his love for Bai Hua. In addition, Bai Hua had been shedding tears non-stop as he recounted the deep love and attachment he had for the three of them.Seeing how Bai Hua was unable to give up any of the feelings he had for them and could only cry painfully, (past) Xu Zi Yan felt heartache and couldn\u2019t bear to see Bai Hua grieve so sadly. He could only take a step back and thus chose to share Bai Hua with the other two.The Xu Zi Yan who had been watching the memory felt his face turn green at this point. At this moment, he didn\u2019t even have the strength to curse out other people. Although he thought that homosexuality wasn\u2019t very good, he wouldn\u2019t be resolutely against it. However, this kind of thing with four people living together completely surpassed his bottom line!!!If he was still capable of returning to his previous world, then he really had to sternly warn his younger brother Xu Zi Yu. If you want to be gay then be gay, but if you dare create a threesome world with three men or something, he would definitely break your leg!En! All three legs would be broken!\u201cDamn it, not reading anymore, so disgusting!\u201d The latter part of the plot was mixed with a load of restricted content, and reading it made Xu Zi Yan feel a burst of disgust. In particular was a scene in the book where all four of them rolled around in the bed sheets, and it made Xu Zi Yan just wish he could delete that memory.\u201cIt\u2019s really beyond my imagination that as a man, he would be willing to share his lover with others. Fuck, isn\u2019t this particularly disgusting. Someone already poked that place and then you continue to poke it yourself\u2026\u2026Ah, I can\u2019t, it\u2019s too disgusting!\u201d Xu Zi Yan\u2019s face paled in complexion. Being a straight-as-a-pencil man, this has gone a bit past his bottom line.Firmly closing the novel and no longer looking at the memories in his head, Xu Zi Yan felt that transmigrating to this world brimming with gay guys was simply the greatest evil of the heavens!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRaising his head to look at the encompassing but unfamiliar surroundings, Xu Zi Yan had a face full of black lines. Even though he had just said that he would never go and look at those memories again, it turned out that he had to break his vow this quickly.With a helpless face, he again went back into his head to do some research. Involuntarily, the corner of Xu Zi Yan\u2019s mouth twitched a bit. It turned out that today was the day Xu Xiao brought back Xu Zi Rong. In addition, (past) Xu Zi Yan\u2019s mother had died not long ago, thus (past) Xu Zi Yan had blamed this matter onto Xu Zi Rong.Thinking about it, that was understandable. Who would expect that a younger brother four years his junior would suddenly pop out from nowhere? It could be presumed that nobody would be in a good mood. After all, this little brother\u2019s existence was practically a heavy slap on the face of the (past) Xu Zi Yan\u2019s late mother.Regarding the case with the \u2018true love\u2019, there were not many people in the Xu family who knew about it. Xu Xiao had hid her very well, and even after he had married they still secretly rendezvoused. Afterwards, it was Xu Xiao\u2019s father who found out that Xu Xiao was still meeting with his \u2018true love\u2019, and thus he furiously ordered Xu Xiao to send his \u2018true love\u2019 away. Xu Xiao was unable to do anything, and only then did he say goodbye to his \u2018true love\u2019.From the beginning to the end, (past) Xu Zi Yan\u2019s mother had never known about this matter. By the time she finally realized that her husband lord actually had another woman and furthermore had a child with her, she was so angry she turned to devil arts cultivation before dying a terrible death.When (past) Xu Zi Yan received the news that his father had gone to retrieve Xu Zi Rong, he, suddenly indignant and in a pique of fury, visited a grove at the mountain back to vent his emotions. Xu Zi Yan took a look at his surroundings filled with broken branches and felt the corner of his mouth twitch again. The Lightning Heavenly Spiritual Vein was really too great, ah! Even though he was just eleven or twelve years old, he was already at the fifth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. The places where those big trees had broke still had traces of charred flakes, and just by looking at it you could tell how powerful he was\u2026\u2026Sighing deeply, Xu Zi Yan stared at both of his own hands, once again feeling melancholic. He was clearly an adult man who about to turn thirty, but now he had to act youthful. This was truly a formidable task.Although he did not know how the former Xu Zi Yan had disappeared, this body now belonged to him. Thus, he could only take the famous former\u2019s place and continue to live his life.Casually putting back that novel into the mysterious space, Xu Zi Yan patted his body to get rid of the dust and decided to go back to Xu family\u2019s main house. Taking a look at the colour of the sky, it was already practically noon. His father Xu Xiao was a Meridian Condensing Stage cultivator. If he flew on a sword to travel, he could bring back Xu Zi Rong extremely quickly.Thinking about how the original character, a soft, sticky and cute child, was forced to become a devil arts cultivator, Xu Zi Yan just couldn\u2019t suppress the fiery anger in his heart. Even abusing someone shouldn\u2019t be to this degree!Along with his movements, that mysterious space always floated in front of him. Unable to resist it, Xu Zi Yan took the piece of jade hanging by his waist and put it inside. Looking at it from the outside, there were no abnormalities.The corner of his mouth reluctantly jerked. Alright, this could also be considered a golden finger1. At the very least, whenever you put something into it, he\u2019s afraid that it would be impossible for someone else to steal it away.Although he was inside this novel where cultivating was real and storage space wasn\u2019t something scarce, those things were something that could be stolen away. As for him \u2014 it could be reckoned that even if the opponent was a heavenly immortal, they still wouldn\u2019t have the skills to steal anything from him.Storing the things on his body into the box and seeing so much money and little trinkets floating in midair, Xu Zi Yan suddenly had the inexplicable urge to laugh.Reaching out to take the things on his body all out before storing them inside the heavenly bag, he saw how this mysterious question mark of a high-end and trendy good thing suddenly held so much random scraps. It really made a person feel apologetic.After that, he had only taken two steps before Xu Zi Yan stopped again. Making a bitter face, he reached up to knock on his own forehead.The original Xu Zi Yan was a cultivator at the fifth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, yet the current Xu Zi Yan was but one of the most ordinary businessman. Though he had seen in his memories how the former Xu Zi Yan and others fought, that was basically the same thing as watching a movie. If you asked him now to use those techniques, he would immediately be going in blind.Thus, offhandedly sitting down in a lotus position, Xu Zi Yan held his chin and started to meditate. Although he did not want to flip through those memories in his head, in order to live, he must completely master the things the former Xu Zi Yan had learned.Fortunately, his current cultivation was not high and the techniques he knew could be counted on one\u2019s fingers. Or else Xu Zi Yan was afraid that it would have really been impossible to master everything in such little time.Closing his eyes and becoming focused, it was perhaps because the former Xu Zi Yan\u2019s habits still lingered in his body for it was extremely easy for Xu Zi Yan to inspect his inner self. He was able to check all the meridians within his body.Attempting to circulate his energy with a heavenly technique, Xu Zi Yan slowly opened his eyes. This type of practicing had already been remembered by his body, so now that he was doing it the technique was effortless to complete and there was not a single lick of difficulty.After spending approximately two hours, he finally managed to completely remember the mishmash of spells, techniques, and even the little habits the former Xu Zi Yan had.Xu Zi Yan once again celebrated the fact that the former Xu Zi Yan was currently only twelve years old. As long as he changed little by little, nobody would discover who he was even if his personality did not match up with the future Xu Zi Yan\u2019s of his memories.Add onto how the former Xu Zi Yan\u2019s personality was a bit domineering, in this way even Xu Zi Yan\u2019s violent temper could also be changed.\u201cDad, Mom, even though I do not know why I have come to this world, since I already came here, I will live a good life. However, your son can\u2019t be filial, and there\u2019s no way for me to provide for you in your old age. Later, we can only depend on Zi Yu to take care of you.\u201d Xu Zi Yan knelt onto the floor and firmly kowtowed a few times.He did not know why he would appear here, but he instinctively realized that he could no longer go back.The people of Xu family all had good adaptability. In those days where he and his parents traveled away from home to live in the United States, he also quickly adapted to living there.Even though he has now entered a strange world, he still had the confidence that he will live very well.His sole regret was that he could no longer do his filial duty, and that with how his younger brother Xu Zi Yu was a gay guy, it seemed to be the end of the Xu family.\u201cAh, forget it. In any case the population of the world is about to explode, so let\u2019s just pretend that it is a contribution to the Earth.\u201d Xu Zi Yan said faintly with a sigh.Standing up from the ground and making himself look presentable, Xu Zi Yan relied on his memory to find a small creek, intending to take a look at himself.Borrowing the water\u2019s reflection, Xu Zi Yan finally saw his current appearance.He looked pretty much the same as he did when he himself was twelve2 , and he could be considered as a little handsome big brother. Slightly raising an eyebrow, the reflection in the water ended up doing the same motion.\u201cAs expected, I really look exactly the same ah.\u201d Xu Zi Yan touched his own face and murmured.But comparing this to the mature appearance of his adult self, the current pretty boy look was really not pleasing to the eye!!!Silently turning his head away, Xu Zi Yan somewhat gloomily followed the trail that brought him back to the Xu family\u2019s main house.\u201cYoung master, young master!\u201d A teenager wearing the attire of a servant\u2019s was anxiously waiting at the gate of the rear court. When he saw Xu Zi Yan walking down the mountain from afar, he quickly ran over.Xu Zi Yan took a moment to retrieve this servant\u2019s name from his memory before he displayed an ugly face. \u201cRuo Zhu, why are you shouting?\u201dRuo Zhu\u2019s heart felt a shock, before he quickly explained. \u201cYoung master, that person was brought back by the Master, Master is waiting for you in the front hall.\u201dHearing Ruo Zhu\u2019s words, Xu Zi Yan felt his heart jump. In the original\u2019s memories, in order to vent the depression in his heart, he stayed in the mountains for a complete day. He only returned to the Xu family\u2019s main house on the next morning. At that time, he did not actually see his father, and instead ran into Xu Zi Rong. Thus Xu Zi Yan cursed him out with no restraints, and even gave him a fierce slap on the face.Because of this matter, Xu Xiao lightly scolded Xu Zi Yan a bit, which resulted in making Xu Zi Yan hate Xu Zi Rong even more. From then, he would always give him troubles for no reason.Had he still been the original Xu Zi Yan, even if he came back in advance, in front of his father he\u2019s afraid that he still wouldn\u2019t give Xu Zi Rong any face. Cursing him out was probably still unavoidable. But now Xu Zi Yan didn\u2019t bear any hatred for Xu Zi Rong, so naturally he wouldn\u2019t try tearing into him the moment they met.Moreover, the original Xu Zi Yan was only twelve years old, so bullying his own younger brother could still be explained away by saying the child hadn\u2019t learned rights from wrongs. But now the person living inside of Xu Zi Yan was a nearly thirty years old adult man. Even if it was to prevent others from noticing something wrong and just an act, he would never go and hit a child who was only eight.\u201cOkay, I know.\u201d Xu Zi Yan waved his hand and sent away Ruo Zhu just like that. He lifted the train of his robe, and took his sweet time as he walked in the direction of the front hall.He pondered even as he walked. Later, how should he act, so that others could not see through him and notice that the person inside has now changed\u2026\u2026The distance from the rear court to the front hall was quite substantial, but Xu Zi Yan was already a cultivator of the fifth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, his skills better than the normal populace. Even if he walked slowly, it couldn\u2019t be slow to the point of being ridiculous. So after only half a teacup\u2019s worth of effort, he could already see the front hall\u2019s door.Unhurriedly walking into the front hall, it became apparent that all the chairs in the front hall were already occupied by people.Xu family was a cultivation family of a middle rank. Although it wasn\u2019t possible to compare with those super families, but relying on the relationship between them and one of the nation\u2019s top five sect families, there weren\u2019t many people who dared to fight against their ideals.The clan is flourishing so naturally the population is large. Other than the head family, the Xu Clan\u2019s direct descendants, there were still more than twenty side branches of the clan.In the whole Xu family, precisely because there was the main head family of the Clan\u2019s direct descendants, the children of the side branches had to prop them up. Therefore, when out popped a new child of the head family who had the power to inherit the clan, these side branches of course had to send people out to take a look.The moment Xu Zi Yan entered the room he became the target of everyone\u2019s gaze.As the son of the Xu Xiao\u2019s, his amazing talent has drawn the attention of the whole family.The single vein Lightning Heavenly Spiritual Vein, this talent, even if he was in a large sect he would have been a carefully taught elite disciple.With a body that had this kind of talent, it had been long decided that he would not be the one to inherit the Xu family. This was because as long as he developed and cultivated well, in the future Xu family would obtain a solid mountain of support.Thus, even those who were eyeing the seat of the family head were all falling over themselves to please him, and nobody would ever offend him.Although it was originally a noisy hall, in the moment Xu Zi Yan entered it suddenly became silent.Almost everyone wanted to know what attitude Xu Zi Yan would have toward this \u2018little brother\u2019 of his that had popped out of nowhere.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt could be said that if Xu Zi Yan did not look favorably upon this Xu Zi Rong, even if it was Xu Xiao who spoke out, they still wouldn\u2019t let Xu Zi Rong enter the Xu Clan\u2019s family tree1.And this \u2014 was also the fate of Xu Zi Rong\u2019s last life.The people in the hall were all observing Xu Zi Yan, yet Xu Zi Yan\u2019s gaze was firmly situated on the middle-aged man sitting on a chair in the middle of the hall \u2014 at least, on the child beside him.That little child looked to be only six or seven. He had white and clean skin, looking as tender and supple as water.His tiny delicate face was filled with tension, and a pair of lovely and vivid eyes stared pitifully at him. Xu Zi Yan swore he absolutely saw the childish admiration that emanated from them.An arrow struck the middle of his heart!Xu Zi Yan looked at this child who should probably be his younger brother and immediately felt his heart melt.Ah ah ah ah ah ah!!! So adorable ah ah! Fuck, this was such a cute child, back then how did that Xu Zi Yan be willing to lay down his hand??!!!Even if you wanted someone to hate you should have hated your father and that \u2018true love\u2019, how could it concern the child ah!!Xu Zi Yan roared in his heart, the expression on his face slightly fierce.Perhaps he had been intimidated by his expression, but that child shrank back, his little face turning red as he lowered his head.Xu Zi Yan was again struck in the heart by an arrow. To a person with a younger brother complex like him, with such a shy and cute little brother, it was simply poking all of his meng2 points!If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he still remembered how he couldn\u2019t act too weirdly, he would have rushed straight up there to hug that white and tender child and give him a strong smooch!\u201cFather\u2026\u2026\u201d The word \u2018father\u2019 stayed festering in Xu Zi Yan\u2019s mouth for a while before he finally managed to utter it. If it wasn\u2019t for how he had practiced saying it so much when he was still in the mountains, it really would have been difficult for him to do it.After all, in his point of view this Xu Xiao was really terrible in the emotional field, and as a father he also failed!!!\u201cEn.\u201d When the Xu Xiao who sat on the chair in the middle of the room saw Xu Zi Yan, he coldly nodded his head.The relationship between him and Xu Zi Yan\u2019s mother was purely a business contract to promote both of their interests. So obviously, he didn\u2019t hold much affection for Xu Zi Yan, this son of his. However, because Xu Zi Yan\u2019s talent was so godly, he still regarded this son as an important person.Xu Zi Yan mentally curled his lip, inwardly criticizing Xu Xiao. If you compared him to his real father, wouldn\u2019t this Xu Xiao be like the dirt to his dad\u2019s heaven? Wouldn\u2019t you think so?During the time when he used to go to school, every night after he returned home he would always be greeted with a hug from his father. Later at dinnertime, his dad would also chat with him about his school things. He didn\u2019t expect Xu Xiao to be as enthusiastic as his real father, but with this kind of a cold attitude, no matter what it wouldn\u2019t pass the dad test ah\u2026\u2026His gaze once again returned to that seemingly timid child and Xu Zi Yan\u2019s heart, like before, softened into a mess. \u201cThis is my younger brother Zi Rong ah?\u201dPractically everyone in the hall were so shocked by Xu Zi Yan\u2019s words, their jaws all fell down. In the past, because of his excellent talent, nobody dared to offend Xu Zi Yan. His father also rarely disciplined him, leading him to develop a very domineering personality.In addition, not long ago his mother had, because of this illegitimate child, turned to devil arts cultivation and passed away. Before he had even been gnashing his teeth as he said he would thoroughly \u2018teach\u2019 this bastard, so why was it that after they met, he on the contrary completely changed his attitude?Those with quick minds immediately thought of other aspects. For example, this Xu Zi Yan could have been given orders, so on the surface he was very good to this little brother. After all, fighting with his own brother, that kind of thing, if it got outside it wouldn\u2019t be that great for his reputation.All the people of the branch families were each turning over different ideas in their minds. Everyone was pondering what Xu Zi Yan\u2019s current attitude really meant.Xu Xiao sat in the middle of the hall. Watching his own eldest son, his expression looked inexplicable.It wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t know how Xu Zi Yan was completely dissatisfied with Xu Zi Rong\u2019s existence, but he still deliberately brought Xu Zi Rong back. This was because there was no need to let the children of Xu family wander outside, but on the other hand, it was also to hone Xu Zi Yan.Xu Xiao didn\u2019t have much affections for Xi Zi Rong. The so-called \u2018true love\u2019 he experienced before, after being ground away by the passage of time, had long fade away for him.After all, this Xu Zi Rong wasn\u2019t raised by him. He didn\u2019t even have much feelings for Xu Zi Yan, so how could there be any fatherly love for Xu Zi Rong?In his eyes, Xu Zi Rong\u2019s existence just amounted to being Xu Zi Yan\u2019s whetstone. He wanted to use Xu Zi Yan\u2019s hatred for Xu Zi Rong, and use it to hone his patience.As for what will happen to Xu Zi Rong in the end, he wasn\u2019t at all worried. The child was merely a boy with average talent, so he would never be able to go beyond the heavens.Seeing what was happening now, it seemed like the effect of what he had done was very good. At the very least, on the surface Xu Zi Yan\u2019s current performance made him feel very satisfied. As a cultivator, if he didn\u2019t have any subtlety, he would be destined to become someone\u2019s stepping stone in the future. Xu Zi Yan\u2019s personality was a bit domineering. However, looking at his attitude towards Xu Zi Rong, he already knew to conceal his real intentions under a different face.Watching Xu Zi Yan\u2019s gentle manner as the other looked at Xu Zi Rong, Xu Xiao mentally praised him. However, he could still tell that those pitch-black eyes were flashing with flickering hostility (the biggest misunderstanding!).Not bad, knowing to hide his own hatred. A Xu Zi Yan like this was what you called a good son of Xu Xiao!Xu Zi Yan looked at that shy (?) little brother and forcefully suppressed the impulses of his heart.Ah ah ah ah ah! How adorable ah! He was meng\u2019d to death!He was just as cute as when Xu Zi Yu was his age! Wait, no! He was even cuter! A single look at him told you he was a cute and obedient child, and definitely not a naturally gay guy from birth!At this moment, Xu Zi Yan suddenly recalled the contents of that novel, and his complexion immediately changed.Not good, at the end, the book said that after Xu Zi Rong turned into the villain BOSS, he abducted Bai Hua. Locked in his devil\u2019s palace, he ruthlessly abused him. The ending of the novel even talked about how male lead #1, male lead #2, and him, male lead #3, all murdered their way into the devil\u2019s palace. After they killed Xu Zi Rong, they rescued Bai Hua \u2014 it was this kind of HE (Happy Ending) kind of story.Although the book did not specify what Xu Zi Rong did to Bai Hua, from what Xu Zi Yan could tell, being together with Bai Hua could not be a good thing. Even if he originally wasn\u2019t gay, he would still be misguided into becoming gay!The moment he thought of this, Xu Zi Yan immediately rolled up his sleeves and prepared for battle, intending to raise Xu Zi Rong well.In the original\u2019s memories, this Xu Zi Rong was awfully unpopular in the Xu family. Normally they would be no one who tended to him. Not talking about his father, who didn\u2019t even care about his son from the first wife, let alone this Xu Zi Rong who wasn\u2019t loved by his grandmother or cared for by his uncle3.If no one cares about him, I will!Xu Zi Yan remembered his own little brother Xu Zi Yu and immediately made a face of grief and indignation. He was obviously so cute when he was a child, but when he grew up he became so dark and two-faced. In the end he would even lie to his older brother, he was really too much of a bastard!Looking at that child who was still hiding behind Xu Xiao\u2019s back, Xu Zi Yan\u2019s aspirations were all aroused.It was rare to get another chance to raise a little brother, so he must raise Xu Zi Rong into an upright youth with an open mind! Ah, another goal must be added: he must be straight!Xu Zi Yan\u2019s fighting spirit was flaming and he had already started visualizing his plans to raise his little brother. Thus, he completely did not notice that the seemingly shy child who hid behind Xu Xiao had a ruthless flash flit through his dark eyes\u2026\u2026Seeing how Xu Zi Yan did not express any disgust toward Xu Zi Rong and was on the contrary extremely kind, there wasn\u2019t much opposition when Xu Xiao brought up the matter of adding Xu Zi Rong into the family tree.This was because Xu Xiao had already said in advance that Xu Zi Rong would not have the right to inherit the family. So for taking in one more bastard child, nobody would really mind.It was only a single child, so how much food could they waste? Their Xu family was this big, could they not afford to raise another child?When the matter of the family tree was settled, all the members from the branch family left one by one.Xu Xiao beckoned Xu Zi Yan over to his side and gave him a satisfied nod. \u201cZi Yan, your performance today was very good.\u201d\u201cMany thanks for father\u2019s praise.\u201d Xu Zi Yan replied lightly. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t have manners, but within his memories, the original and his father interacted with each other just like this.\u201cEn. This is your little brother Xu Zi Rong. From now on, he will live with you.\u201d Xu Xiao casually pulled out Xu Zi Rong who was hiding behind him, his tone of voice completely commanding.Xu Zi Yan wore a very gentle face as he looked at Xu Zi Rong, before he lightly rubbed the other\u2019s head. \u201cHello Zi Rong, my name is Xu Zi Yan. From today, I will be your older brother.\u201dXu Zi Rong\u2019s half-drooping eyes hid the doubts in his gaze. By the time he had lifted his head again, his limpid eyes overflowed with admiration. Whispering, he tentatively called out, \u201cBig brother.\u201d\u201cGood child.\u201d Xu Zi Yan\u2019s heart trembled hard. He affectionately patted Xu Zi Rong\u2019s shoulders before he twisted his head and asked Xu Xiao, \u201cFather, does Zi Rong have anywhere to sleep?\u201dXu Xiao felt somewhat astonished. He had always thought that this son of his had a straightforward personality, so he never thought that the boy would develop a mask so perfect even he couldn\u2019t see through it.He pondered for a bit. \u201cI had originally arranged Zi Rong\u2019s bedroom to be in the Zhu Xin Courtyard\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cFather.\u201d Xu Zi Yan interrupted him. \u201cZhu Xin Courtyard is too remote. Let him live with me at the Liu Shang Courtyard, ah.\u201dXu Xiao nodded his head. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dXu Zi Yan turned his head to look at Xu Zi Rong with a smile. \u201cZi Rong, is living together with your older brother alright?\u201dXu Zi Rong was bewildered. The expression on his face was completely sincere. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cGood child.\u201d Xu Zi Yan\u2019s heart felt overjoyed. Unable to resist it, he kissed the boy\u2019s forehead before pulling his hand and leaving.Xu Zi Rong felt started. Even if he was cool-headed, he was still unable to cover his heart\u2019s shock. He raised his hand to touch his forehead, and then took another look at the not-quite-grown figure in front of him, his heart brimming with doubts that puzzled him.Undoubtedly in his past life he was killed by the three lovers of that slut Bai Hua, his soul scattering. Yet the moment he opened his eyes, he saw the father he killed himself standing in front of him, telling him with a cold voice to gather his belongings and leave with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Starting from that year, he was tormented and humiliated a hundred ways by the Xu family\u2019s Xu Zi Yan, and in the end he was pushed into the snake valley and almost had to give up his life. If it hadn\u2019t been the fact that he was lucky that time, accidentally falling into the hiding place of a blood devil who had already passed away and then picking up their inheritance, he would have long died.He doesn\u2019t understand why he would suddenly be reborn, so he could only quietly follow Xu Xiao once again back to the Xu family. Right now he was only an eight year old child, and thus was simply unable to resist Xu Xiao\u2019s decisions.Just\u2026\u2026if they thought he was still that Xu Zi Rong who could be bullied, then they were wrong. As long as you gave him another year\u2019s time, when he was somewhat finished relearning the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, even if he couldn\u2019t kill off all of the Xu family members it would be enough to protect himself from Xu Xiao\u2019s hands.He deliberately put on an obedient-looking expression, for Xu Zi Rong had practically forgotten how he was like when he was eight.He followed Xu Xiao back to the Xu family, but everything that happened afterwards made him feel slightly uneasy.Clearly he was only supposed to meet Xu Zi Yan on the next morning, but he instead suddenly appeared in the front hall. In addition, not only did the other not abuse him, but he even gently told him to call Xu Zi Yan \u2018big brother\u2019.Big brother?In his last life he had never called Xu Zi Yan \u2018big brother\u2019. That person\u2019s name for him was always \u2018bastard\u2019, so how could he let a \u2018bastard\u2019 call him by the title big brother?If you said that Xu Zi Yan allowing him to call the other \u2018big brother\u2019 had surprised him, then the way he had kissed him on his forehead had shocked him silly.In his past life and now, there had been nobody who had ever done such an intimate gesture to him. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Xu family and everything else looked the same as the ones in his memories, he would have really doubted if he had been transported to a place that was completely different than the Xu family.The expression on Xu Xi Rong\u2019s face became inexplicable. If Xu Zi Yan was also reborn in this time, he would have never thought he was a cute and pure little child.Unfortunately, Xu Zi Yan was still immersed in his \u2018can raise another good little brother\u2019 dream, and simply did not notice the dark and gloomy expression from the person behind him.Although he did not know why this Xu Zi Yan had such a dramatic change, Xu Zi Rong did not lower his guard.Starting over in this new life, it was unlikely he would trust anyone ever again. Even if the Xu Zi Yan now showed him kindness, he wouldn\u2019t easily believe him.The type of person that was Xu Zi Yan, he knew too well! In his last life, before dying, if it wasn\u2019t for how Xu Zi Yan had tortured his soul before killing him, his soul wouldn\u2019t have flied away and scattered!Xu Zi Yan\u2026\u2026Chewing on this abhorable name, Xu Zi Rong could even taste the blood in his mouth.Looking at the figure in front of him, Xu Zi Rong\u2019s gaze revealed a thick killing intent.Although he did not have enough strength right now, if it was a sneak attack, it might be enough to kill him.Xu Zi Rong flipped his wrist, his hand holding a sharp dagger. As long as he swiped lightly, he was absolutely sure he had the abilities to cut Xu Zi Yan\u2019s throat\u2026\u2026\u201cZi Rong, what kind of room style do you like?\u201d Xu Zi Yan suddenly turned around to ask.Xu Zi Rong\u2019s hand tightened before loosening, his dagger returning to his wrist.He adopted an ignorant look, blankly staring at Xu Zi Yan before softly asking, \u201cBig brother, what is \u2018style\u2019?\u201dXu Zi Yan lightly knocked on his own forehead, before lightly rubbing Xu Zi Rong\u2019s head. Crouching down, he beamed at Xu Zi Rong from the same height. \u201cIt\u2019s your big brother who\u2019s stupid, big brother already forgot you are only eight years old ah. How about this, tell big brother what colour you want your room to be?\u201dXu Zi Rong had another moment where he dazed a bit. After becoming a blood devil in those years, it had been awhile since he had these moments where he was so surprised.But the situation now wasn\u2019t one where he could be not surprised. He was now doubting whether or not he was dreaming. That person who hated him, that Xu Zi Yan who couldn\u2019t wait for him to die, how could he so gently ask him for his preferences??Unless, could it possibly be that he wanted him to lower his guard, before he started to torment him?Something you had before losing, it was always more cruel than never getting it!In his last life when he was a blood devil, he also played this game with people\u2019s hearts. But if Xu Zi Yan wanted to obtain this end goal, then he wouldn\u2019t get it!Before the body transfer, Xi Zi Rong already thought through a lot of things (yet not everything!). He remembered what Xu Zi Yan had just said, about how he wanted him to live with him. Since it was like this\u2026\u2026The white and tender face of the child looked slightly red, and he seemed very shy. Xu Zi Yan encouragingly patted his shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, whatever you want just say it. As long as it\u2019s within big brother\u2019s abilities, I\u2019ll definitely grant it.\u201dXu Zi Rong slightly bowed his head, a malicious flash flitting by in his pitch-black eyes. If he didn\u2019t remember incorrectly, this Xu Zi Yan always boasted he had good tastes. Especially after he began mixing with that Bai Hua, he was graceful whenever he opened or closed his mouth. A style. If his request didn\u2019t match Xu Zi Yan\u2019s preferences, what kind of choice would the other make then?After all, the Xu Zi Yan right now was but a child in his early teens. Although he did not know who was the one who told him to act like this, a child\u2019s patience was no doubt limited. He really wanted to see the expression Xu Zi Yan would make when he revealed his true face.Xu Zi Rong sneered in his heart, but his mouth was sweet as he said, \u201cBig brother, I like pink.\u201dXu Zi Yan was immediately struck by a lightning bolt, pink??!!!Fuck! The colour for sissies!!! What kind of boy liked their wool pink! This child was only eight years old, so it couldn\u2019t be that he was already starting to become gay now?Xu Zi Yan\u2019s face looked unusually ugly, and this naturally did not escape Xu Zi Rong\u2019s observations. In his heart he silently thought, \u2018Sure enough, this will be enough to reveal his true face ah!\u2019\u201cZi Rong, are you sure you like pink?\u201d Xu Zi Yan was at such a loss his eyebrows were all scrunched up.Xu Zi Rong secretly ridiculed his hypocrisy. Putting on a wronged look, he weakly asked, \u201cBig brother\u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t like pink\u2026\u2026?\u201dXu Zi Yan was immediately defeated by this expression of Xu Zi Rong\u2019s. Forget it, forget it. Wasn\u2019t it just a boy liking pink? This didn\u2019t mean anything, it was only a colour. You couldn\u2019t say that just because the colour he liked wasn\u2019t manly enough, he would turn into a gay guy in the future.Xu Zi Yan affectionately rubbed Xu Zi Rong\u2019s head. \u201cThere isn\u2019t such a thing. Zi Rong likes pink, big brother now knows. Later big brother will order some people to make your whole room pink.\u201dXu Zi Rong was dazed again\u2026\u2026Wait, wait a moment. Why was this result different from what he had thought before??!!!When did he want his room to be decorated pink? It was such a disgusting colour. If he had to live inside, it would be even harder than dying!Before Xu Zi Rong could say anything more, the two of them already arrived to the Liu Shang Courtyard Xu Zi Yan lived in.As Xu family\u2019s most talented son of the first wife, the place Xu Zi Yan was living in was naturally extremely good. There was a main hall in the very middle, and on both sides there were side rooms. The owner\u2019s bedroom was behind the main hall, and the whole backyard was made into a huge training field.Although it was also the first time Xu Zi Yan came here, but with (past) Xu Zi Yan\u2019s memories, he naturally wasn\u2019t unfamiliar with anything. He brought Xu Zi Rong and strolled around the whole courtyard once in high spirits, before finally bringing the other to his own bedroom.Smiling, he said to Xu Zi Rong, \u201cFather, that kind of person, would never be considerate of others. You\u2019re so young but you had to fly with him on his sword, so you must feel tired. You can rest first and I will get someone to prepare some hot water. After bathing you can sleep first and when it\u2019s dinnertime I will call for you.\u201dXu Zi Rong\u2019s heart thumped. It was coming!So it had been waiting for him here!Xu family had very strict rules, and everyday everyone must get together before they could start dinner. If there were no special circumstances you could not be absent. Xu Zi Rong could completely imagine, if he said that his excuse was because he had overslept, he would only gain everyone\u2019s ridicule.He silently sneered in his heart, for he wasn\u2019t that naive and stupid Xu Zi Rong from that past life. In addition, he definitely did not care about any impressions the Xu family would have of him. Even if everyone looked down on him, why would it matter to him?In his last life he lived a life so cruel, and he was abused until he was black and blue by those followers of the first wife\u2019s eldest son. But after he came back as the blood devil, all of those people who used to have a higher standing, all of those people who used to bully him, didn\u2019t all of them kneel on the ground and beg him to let them go?What family, what friends, everything was fake!Only strength was something he could really grasp in his hands.Now that he thought about it, in that last life when Bai Hua saw that he was really strong, he actually tried to seduce him. Bai Hua didn\u2019t even think about how he was that type of trash who was used by so many, so how could Xu Zi Rong like him!The Blood Sea Heart Sutra wasn\u2019t a normal type of martial arts technique. After using the Blood Sea, his blood could hide in people and would never be destroyed.There was only one thing. The moment you had sex with someone, the blood would create a bond with that person. When he activates Blood Sea, only the people who had sex with him could find the position of his blood.This kind of thing where you handed over your weaknesses to someone on a silver platter, how could Xu Zi Rong do it!In fact, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he had really bad luck in his last life, how could he have met such a miserable fate? When those three had came to murder him, not even a single drop of blood had managed to escape.When he thought of the scene where he had been originally killed, Xu Zi Rong\u2019s eyes were immediately covered by a thick layer of killing intent. Seeing the maid trying to persuade Xu Zi Yan something, the feeling to murder rushed forth in his heart.\u201cAh?\u201d Xu Zi Yan suddenly felt a piercing gaze, but when he turned around he didn\u2019t find anything unusual.Only Xu Zi Rong was sitting on the bedside as he played with his own fingers. He was really a child. When he arrived in a new place, he instinctively found some \u2018toys\u2019 he was familiar with.Xu Zi Yan smiled knowingly. Coincidentally finishing his job of giving the maid orders, he walked over to Xu Zi Rong\u2019s side. \u201cIs it very boring?\u201dXu Zi Rong slowly raised his head, looking a bit tense as he stared at Xu Zi Yan. Right now he had just measured his own abilities. According to his current skills, launching a sneak attack against Xu Zi Yan probably had some chances of success to kill him, but his genuine cultivation was nowhere near the other\u2019s.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yet he was actually stupid enough to look at Xu Zi Yan with killing intent. If the other found out, it would amount to him courting his own death!Right now his strength was too weak. Rather than exposing Xu Zi Yan\u2019s hypocritical mask, it would be better to feign civility and get through a year here.Gently shaking his head, Xu Zi Rong softly replied. \u201cNo\u2026\u2026Nothing.\u201dSeeing how Xu Zi Rong was obviously very nervous, but had still put in the effort to keep up a \u2018there\u2019s no need to worry about me\u2019 appearance, Xu Zi Yan couldn\u2019t help but laugh a bit. He used some force to rub the younger\u2019s head, turning the other\u2019s neat hair into a chicken\u2019s nest.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, in front of big brother there\u2019s no need to try and be brave! I know you have just arrived here, so it\u2019s certain you\u2019ll be very anxious. Don\u2019t be afraid, from now on there\u2019s big brother to take care of you.\u201d Xu Zi Yan said as he rubbed his head, smiling.Xu Zi Rong was dazedly gathered into Xu Zi Yan\u2019s embrace. A teenager\u2019s chest was not very broad but it was exceptionally warm, and even allowed him to feel a nostalgic illusion.\u201cBig brother!\u201d Vexed, Xu Zi Rong broke out of Xu Zi Yang\u2019s warm embrace and looked at the other with a face full of complaint. It was remarkably alike to the manner of a spoiled child.Only he himself knew that his annoyed tone wasn\u2019t faked. Rather, it was particularly directed at that feeling of yearning he had just experienced.That was a complete joke. How could this kind of thing appear in the body of a blood devil? These weak emotions, they had long been abandoned by him!\u201cYes yes, I know you\u2019re already an adult! Ha ha ha\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu Zi Yan laughed himself silly. In fact, an eight year old in his eyes was completely a child. If it was modern times, an eight year old child still wouldn\u2019t know which corner to go in order to play in the mud. It was nothing like what happened here, where you had to start practicing at six, and by eight you would have already understood many truths of reality.So much that for some of those early-maturing children, you could totally consider them as half an adult or a shorter one.The concept in Xu Zi Yan\u2019s heart, where eighteen years old was what he considered to be an adult, simply did not work here.But that was also out of the question! Xu Zi Yan had completely thought it through. Others could interact with an eight year old as if they were talking to an adult, but he definitely wouldn\u2019t do it!Children, you see, were meant to be loved. Other than some necessary education, letting them enjoy their childhood was the most important!Children were clearly children, so why make them bear the burden of adults? What other people did he couldn\u2019t control, but as the little brother of Xu Zi Yan of course he was going to pamper Xu Zi Rong for a few more years!\u201cYoung master, the water has been boiled.\u201d The maid outside the door announced in a crisp tone.Xu Zi Yan frowned slightly, but very quickly smoothed out his expression. If he didn\u2019t remember incorrectly, the maid currently speaking was called Ruo Qi. Apparently, she had been attempting to seduce the original Xu Zi Yan only two days ago.This was simply nonsense!As a child of twelve years old, even if the people here started training when they were young and matured early as well, the body of Xu Zi Yan only experienced his first wet dream this year. What was wrong with the people of Xu family? The child hadn\u2019t even grown up when they started playing this kind of hand. Ah, this was what you called playing the rhythm of death!Looking through the original\u2019s memories, it seemed like it hadn\u2019t been much longer before the former Xu Zi Yan bedded her. This was something Xu Zi Yan absolutely could not accept!Fuck, this body was only twelve years old ah! Minors are forbidden sex!\u201cI know, you can go now.\u201d Xu Zi Yan replied coldly.The maid outside the door paused for a moment, before quickly retreating. In the past, during Xu Zi Yan\u2019s bath time, he would always let this maid help him. However, Xu Zi Yan\u2019s sudden change in attitude gave her some unease, thus the moment she left she immediately rushed over to the study room of the Master\u2019s courtyard.After listening to the report of Ruo Qi, Xu Xiao didn\u2019t say much, and only told her to wait for two days before trying again. If Xu Zi Yan still remained unmoved, they would extinguish these kind of ideas.Ruo Qi anxiously departed from Xu Xiao\u2019s study room, her heart completely unwilling. If she could successfully climb into the young master\u2019s bed, even if she didn\u2019t have status the Xu family still wouldn\u2019t mistreat her. However, she was too afraid to go against the Master\u2019s words. Now the only hope could be found in these next few days, where she would try and seize the opportunity to attract the Young Master\u2019s attention onto herself.Ruo Qi left with a tangled, preoccupied mind, and thus did not know that after she left, Xu Xiao smiled in satisfaction.This woman was originally one he had picked to give to Xu Zi Yan. Other than letting him understand the ways of the world, he also hoped that in the future he wouldn\u2019t be distracted by women.He didn\u2019t have much feelings toward Xu Zi Yan, but he did harbour a lot of expectations. He didn\u2019t want his own son, after going out into the real world, be tempted by women and thus forgetting to cultivate.Rather than let something like that happen, wouldn\u2019t it be better to prepare and give him a variety of girls when he was home? As long as he had a taste, even if other beauties appear the temptation wouldn\u2019t be as strong.Other than Ruo Qi, Xu Xiao also prepared three stunning beauties for Xu Zi Yan. Apart from that, he even found two delicate and pretty young men.In order to nurture his own son, he could say he spared no pains or effort. However, Xu Zi Yan\u2019s performance today made him feel a bit bewildered.In any case, being able to resist a woman\u2019s seduction was of course a good thing. It was still better to let Ruo Qi try once more though, and if she still wasn\u2019t successful, Xu Xiao could just take out the other beauties he had prepared.If Xu Zi Yan was really able to resist the temptation from all those people, it could be considered that Xu Xiao\u2019s training had succeeded.Gently dropping a black Go chess piece onto the chessboard, Xu Xiao said in a good mood, \u201cAn Sha, come accompany me with a game of chess.\u201dIn the empty study room, a certain spot in the room abruptly warped. A middle-aged man in a gray cheongsam walked out, and holding some white chess pieces, set them down against Xu Xiao\u2019s tit for tat.Xu Xiao raised his head, and seeing that middle-aged man with a cold expression, smiled slightly. \u201cMy son is quite good, huh?\u201dThat middle-aged man\u2019s gaze was cold. \u201cZi Yao\u2019s son, naturally he\u2019s good.\u201dXu Xiao raised his eyebrow. \u201cWrong, ever since she married me, she was no longer Zi Yao but Lady Xu!\u201dThe middle-aged man\u2019s face sank, and he no longer spoke anymore.Xu Xiao laughed \u2018haha\u2019. Seeing how his own former hated rival had no choice but become his secret guard, the frustration in his heart all disappeared. Thinking back, the former Master Xu was really wise. If it wasn\u2019t for the existence of this man, it wouldn\u2019t have been so effortless for Xu Xiao to break into the Meridian Condensation stage.Right now he was already at the peak of the middle level of Meridian Condensation stage. As long as there was an opportunity, he could break into the later level of Meridian Condensation stage. Looking at how he was only a bit over thirty, this could already be considered as a very amazing achievement.\u201cGet lost,\u201d Xu Xiao gave the other man a cold sneer, yet that middle-aged man who was abused didn\u2019t have a single reaction.At the moment the man was about to dissipate into the air, Xu Xiao suddenly opened his mouth. \u201cWait.\u201dThe middle-aged man paused before he expressionlessly looked at him.\u201cFrom today onwards, you must protect Zi Yan. If I think about it, you would enthusiastically protect my son, right?\u201dThe middle-aged man\u2019s hand clenched into a fist before it suddenly loosened. \u201cI understand.\u201dHis words were barely finished when the middle-aged man pushed open the door to walk outside. The moment he walked past the door, his whole body faded away into thin air.Xu Xiao didn\u2019t feel any shock. After all, the ability of the middle-aged man was just a concealment skill from the Xu family.In fact, this was just a relatively high level camouflage skill. In the eyes of a Meridian Condensation cultivator, it may still hold meaning. But if one met a Golden Core Formation cultivator, it wouldn\u2019t be of any use.Thinking about how that man could only honestly protect his own son, Xu Xiao couldn\u2019t resist a cold smile. So what if that man\u2019s talent was astonishing in those olden days? Now, he was but a poor bug that was stepped under Xu Xiao\u2019s foot.Unhurriedly picking up the scroll in his hands, Xu Xiao leaned onto the couch before sitting down. Right now his cultivation has already reached a bottleneck, and thus he needed a breakthrough opportunity. Reading extensively to accumulate experience also had some chances of letting him break through.The things that happened on Xu Xiao\u2019s side, Xu Zi Yan naturally did not know. He also did not know that there was a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator who was stealthily by his side, and who would protect him no matter what.At this moment, Xu ZI Yan was just fighting to take off Xu Zi Rong\u2019s clothes. However, the other kept struggling, making it a rather thorny problem.\u201cBe good, just look at how dirty your clothes have become. If you don\u2019t wash them lice may appear.\u201d Xu Zi Yan persuaded in a kind and advising voice.Xu Zi Rong had a face full of shame and anger, choking so much that it was red.This wretched bastard! He actually dared to humiliate him in this way! Taking a bath was just taking a bath, so why the heck was Xu Zi Yan taking off his clothes? Did he think he didn\u2019t know how to bath himself???!!!In order to not give himself away, Xu Zi Rong naturally couldn\u2019t erupt into curses. He could only clutch his own clothes with force, his whole face red. Because he was struggling so much, the edges of his eyes were covered in some misty water, and he looked like the spitting image of a young girl who was about to be assaulted.\u201cBe good, Zi Rong, it\u2019s only a bath. You\u2019re a boy so what are you doing, acting so unreasonable?\u201d Xu Zi Yan\u2019s kind and advising tone had no effect, and so he could not help but feel some impatience.Xu Zi Rong resolutely shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll wash myself, big brother, you can leave.\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d Xu Zi Yan\u2019s complexion changed. Let\u2019s not talk about if an eight year old child could cleanly wash himself. Just seeing those bathing tubs that could accommodate two or three fully grown men, Xu Zi Yan was afraid that if Xu Zi Rong wasn\u2019t careful enough he would drown in there.\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u201dXu Zi Rong didn\u2019t even finish speaking when he was shocked into a daze by Xu Zi Yan\u2019s next actions.He only saw Xu Zi Yan reaching out, before he pulled the very weak and thin Xu Zi Rong into his embrace. Then, he put the whole person onto his thigh and pulled down his pants, before \u2018Pa! Pa! Pa!\u2019, he spanked Xu Zi Rong\u2019s white and tender butt three times1.\u201cChildren must be obedient, if you\u2019re not obedient then you must be spanked! Do you understand now?\u201d Xu Zi Yan had a face filled with seriousness. He believed that pampering a little brother was a big brother\u2019s duty, but discipling him was also his responsibility. Today was the first time the siblings met, so he must establish his own authority. Otherwise in the future, if by any chance his little brother was over-pampered by him and would refuse to be disciplined, then that would certainly be troublesome.With small children, it was a must to let them know: if you were obedient there would be candy to eat, if you weren\u2019t then you must be spanked \u2018pi pi\u2019.Xu Zi Yan simply wanted to give his own quick-wittiness a thumbs up, but he was unaware that the face of Xu Zi Rong, who he had sat onto his thigh, had already turned thoroughly green.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe cruel and cold-hearted Mister Blood Devil\u2026\u2026was spanked on the butt!!!If this matter was transmitted outside, it could be estimated that 90% or more of the blood devils would split their sides laughing to death, and the rest would laugh until they fainted.\u201cLet me go! You bastard! How dare you\u2026\u2026.\u201d Xu Zi Rong was practically angered till he was insane. In his two whole lives, he had never experienced such a big insult. Getting spanked on the butt?? Even when he was a real small child there had been nobody who had done it!!With this, what was tolerance. Hiding his true face had long been cast to the back of his mind. If not for the fact that he currently had the power level of a chicken, he would have for sure tore Xu Zi Yan into tiny pieces and swallowed down the blood with the meat!\u201cOh my goodness, you actually dare to curse people!\u201d Xu Zi Yan\u2019s gaze was very strict. Children who did not follow good examples and who would actually dare to curse must be disciplined.Pa pa pa!Thus, as the past Mister Blood Devil struggled and snarled, Xu Zi Yan\u2019s face was cold. He ruthless slapped down his palm until that tender white and round buttocks became red. It was bright in colour, and seemingly gave one an appetite. =.=Xu Zi Yan was four years older than Xu Zi Rong, and add on how he was already at the fifth layer of Qi Condensation stage, the thin and weak Xu Zi Rong in his embrace had literally no way to resist. No matter how much he struggled, it was as if he was clamped onto Xu Zi Yan\u2019s thigh and though he was kicking both of his legs, his butt was still suffering.\u201cSay it! Do you still dare to casually curse at people?\u201d Xu Zi Yan\u2019s expression was ice-cold. He himself also cursed, so toward this cursing business he wasn\u2019t too angry.But right now Xu Zi Rong was just an eight year old child (not!). Casually cursing others was a habit that couldn\u2019t be kept because it would allow others to doubt his family discipline methods, and this was something Xu Zi Yan definitely could not accept.Xu Zi Yan attached a lot of significance to his family. In his heart, his family members were his most important spiritual pillars. Even if he always complained about how his own little brother was no longer obedient and was now a little bastard, if someone else dared to curse out Xu Zi Yu, he would have for sure impolitely rushed over to the guy and beat him up.His little brother was his. Other than his parents, only he had the qualifications to discipline him. Any other strangers A, B, or C should all move aside. Anyone who dared to raise their hand against his little brother had to deal with him.Although Xu Zi Rong was far from obtaining an important place in his heart like Xu Zi Yu\u2019s, after transmigrating into this world and reading that novel, his thoughts toward Xu Zi Rong held a lot of pity.The original Xi Zi Rong was but a poor little child. If it wasn\u2019t for how the former Xu Zi Yan and his Xu family had pushed Xu Zi Rong to his breaking point, he may not have turned into that terrifying blood devil.The first time Xu Zi Yan saw Xu Zi Rong, the white and tender child with the innocent admiration in his eyes, it left a deep impression on him.Unconsciously, he had already instinctively taken this adorable (not!) little brother under his own wing. To his own people, Xu Zi Yan was actually even more strict.He was determined to raise Xu Zi Rong into an upright and morale young man. Ah\u2026\u2026.and the first disciplining act was started by Xu Zi Rong maliciously spitting curses from his mouth!\u201cSay it! Do you still dare to casually curse at people?\u201d Xu Zi Yan asked strictly once more. In his point of view, this kind of problem must be corrected the first time it happens. If you let him off once, it would be too late afterwards!Xu Zi Rong\u2019s complexion had already turned a pale purple. His thoughts were sinister but his facial expression looked terrified. Although the pain on his behind wasn\u2019t painful to the point of being unbearable, this kind of humiliation to himself made him hate Xu Zi Yan to the bones.Xu Zi Yan! Xu Zi Yan!In his two lives, Xu Zi Yan only brought him infinite torture.In particular, after he died in his past life, in order to locate his hidden treasure Bai Hua and the others deliberately roasted his soul under the Nine Yang Dark Fire1. That kind of bone-deep pain, even reincarnating could not make the memory fade away.He still remembered that while his soul was suffering under the Nine Yang Dark Fire, Xu Zi Yan and the others were unfettered and cheerful in his palace. His soul\u2019s consciousness was gone, but he was still able to know what was happening in his palace. Thinking about how those four guys had rolled into a ball on his luxurious and big bed as they did their nasty deed, Xu Zi Rong even felt the urge to vomit.\u201cBarf\u2026\u2026.\u201d Unable to control it, Xu Zi Rong began to violently retch. From his rebirth to now, his nerves from the beginning to the end were tightly wound. He was afraid that this was just a sweet dream of his, and that the moment he woke up he would still be that dying soul tortured by the Nine Yang Dark Fire.His mouth was full of a metallic sweet taste and Xu Zi Rong was shocked to find out that just now when he had been extremely angry, his body instinctively began its protective response. Perhaps it was because he was already too familiar with the contents of the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, but he actually unknowingly absorbed a small amount of spiritual qi. In addition this qi had also entered his dantian, and began moving according to the course of the Blood Sea Heart Sutra.Although this spiritual qi was still too small and weak, before he wasn\u2019t even considered as one in the first layer of Qi Condensation stage. But after this qi appeared, he was now considered as one who had opened the big door into cultivation, and was officially someone who entered the ranks of cultivators.Next, as long as he devotedly trained and increased the qi aura in his body, he could enter the first layer of Qi Condensation stage in less than three days!The sudden breakthrough made Xu Zi Rong\u2019s heart feel ecstatic. Even the humiliation of being spanked was swept away by this moment of joy. Of course, with his pettiness there was no chance of him forgetting this. But for now he must first train up until he re-learnt the Heart Sea Blood Sutra, and then he could take his revenge all at once.The bullying from his past life, the suffering his soul experienced, and the humiliation of today\u2019s spanking, all of this he would return to Xu Zi Yan!\u201cYou silly child! It was only to let you change and bath, but you would go as far as doing something like this!\u201d Xu Zi Yan scolded, feeling as if he was hating iron for not becoming steel.As a cultivator, he was extremely sensitive to smells. Being so close to Xu Zi Rong, of course he would smell that faint scent of blood.Feeling shocked, he set Xu Zi Rong down and tried forcing open the other\u2019s mouth. However, all he saw was the stubborn and delicate face of a young child, a drop of blood at the corner of the younger\u2019s mouth.At this moment Xu Zi Yan was truly both angered yet distressed. He was angry because of how stubborn this child was. The other would rather bite his lip and draw blood than cry in defeat. However, he felt distressed because of this same point. The Xu Zi Rong that survived in the original\u2019s memories was also stubborn like this, and even if he was hit until he was black and blue by the other children of the clan he had never cried once. However, this kind of child made others feel even more heartbroken.Heaving a heavy sigh, Xu Zi Yan gathered Xu Zi Rong into his arms before talking in a quiet whisper, \u201cZi Rong, be good. Right now you are still young so you cannot casually curse. Big brother spanking you is just because he wants you to remember. Some things can be done, but towards your family members you can never curse at them.\u201dXu Zi Rong did not say a single word as he silently hanged his head.Xu Zi Yan rummaged through his memories but was still unable to find an experience with Xu Zi Rong like this.The novel had Bai Hua that guy as its protagonist. Being the book\u2019s villain BOSS, it was after Xu Zi Rong had became a blood devil had people begun to become concerned about him. His childhood experiences were all things Xu Zi Yan saw from the original\u2019s memories, and before that, the original Xu Zi Yan obviously did not care about how the other fared before he came to live in the Xu family.Towards Xu Zi Rong\u2019s previous lifestyle, he had no idea what it was like. But now, seeing this child with his stubborn expression and combined with that \u2018true love\u2019 story written by that dog, Xu Zi Yan involuntary understood that this child\u2019s past life was not something one wanted to infer.Thinking about it, that also made sense. It could be deduced that his mother had put all her energy into trying to obtain Xu Xiao\u2019s love, so how could she still have time to care about her own son?With that in mind, his eyes filled with tenderness as Xu Zi Yan hugged the Xu Zi Rong in his embrace, before he began speaking in his gentlest tone possible. \u201cZi Rong, starting from today, you are my, Xu Zi Yan\u2019s, little brother. Rest assured that no matter what happens afterwards, big brother will always protect you.\u201dXu Zi Rong slowly raised his head, his pitch-black eyes looking deep and bottomless. He stared straight at Xu Zi Yan, and in his eyes revealed a look of expectation.Xu Zi Yan could see that Xu Zi Rong felt a bit hesitant, so he gently touched the other\u2019s head. \u201cI know you have just arrived here and you probably don\u2019t dare to believe me. But that does not matter. Later you will understand that no matter what time it is, big brother will always be someone you can rely on.\u201dXu Zi Rong gently bit his lower lip as he hesitated again, before he finally nodded his head.Xu Zi Yan immediately showed an expression of delight as he fiercely kissed Xu Zi Rong\u2019s face. \u201cGood! Big brother promises he won\u2019t let you down!\u201dXu Zi Rong\u2019s face reddened again before he slightly lowered his eyelids. His delicate eyelashes were thick and spread out like a fan as they slightly trembled twice, hiding the sneer in his eyes.Protection?Xu Zi Yan?Hehe, since this Xu Zi Yan wanted to play this elder brother little brother game, he didn\u2019t mind playing along with him. In any case the days at Xu family were quite boring, so using this as entertainment was pretty good as well.Xu Zi Yan, seeing the obedient look Xu Zi Rong exposed, felt completely comforted. This new little brother was really too obedient and good, thus he must raise this adorable child into an upright and morale young man!!What blood devil, what villain BOSS, those things should fly away with the clouds! My little brother would never turn into a blood devil! o(\uffe3\u30d8\uffe3o*)[pumps fist!]Xu Zi Rong\u2019s mood which had experienced the previous ups and downs had completely calmed down. He quietly finished rearranging his mask. No matter how many times Xu Zi Yan peeked at him from the corner of his eyes, he looked like a bashful but very determined little child.\u201cEn, okay, since we already finished this matter, next we should take that bath.\u201d Xu Zi Rong\u2019s trick was not done yet when he heard those words of Xu Zi Yan that made him instantly dazed.After that, he was completely too late to react, and was stripped by Xu Zi Yan so that both his upper body and lower were bare.Xu Zi Rong reflexively covered his lower body, but then he realized that this action was totally not one a blood devil like him would do.His face subtly turned green for a moment, before returning to normal. Just when he was about to pretend to nonchalantly lower his hands, Xu Zi Yan suddenly opened his mouth to speak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s such a tiny thing, are you really afraid of letting big brother see it?\u201d Xu Zi Yan laughed a bit, before horridly flicking Xu Zi Rong\u2019s little Zi Rong in a teasing manner.Xu Zi Rong\u2019s whole body went stiff, and the words replayed in his mind over and over again: \u201cSuch a tiny thing\u2026\u2026.such a tiny thing\u2026\u2026\u201dThere wasn\u2019t a single man who would tolerate being criticized by other men as \u2018small\u2019, even if at this moment Xu Zi Rong was truly quite tiny.After that, something that was even more shocking happened. Mister Blood Devil\u2019s respected little Zi Rong was actually flicked by someone. It! Was! Flicked! By! Someone!The magnificent blood devil lord, the one with the highest devil arts cultivation!He\u2014\u2014was molested!!!\u201cMm, this one looks a bit too big, this one looks too ugly, ah, this one looks about right.\u201d Completely unaware that his actions just then had angered the blood devil lord, Xu Zi Yan thoroughly searched his trunk for clothes that Xu Zi Rong could wear after he bathed.Xu Zi Rong fiercely glared at Xu Zi Yan as he tried to resist the urge to get revenge. Because that wouldn\u2019t do! At least he couldn\u2019t do it now! If he wanted revenge against Xu Zi Yan, he at least needed the appropriate power. With the strength of his current cultivation, to provoke Xu Zi Yan now was the same as bringing humiliation onto himself. Tolerance! He can tolerate it!These acts, every single thing Xu Zi Yan did to humiliate him, he would remember it all. When he obtained the ability, he would certainly return the favor for everything!\u201cLet\u2019s go with this one, ah.\u201d Xu Zi Yan finally found a piece of clothing he wore when he was young at the bottom of the trunk. Measuring it against Xu Zi Rong\u2019s body, mn, it was about the same.13316210_191nAlthough this baby blue chang pao wasn\u2019t made from some expensive kind of fabric, it was very comfortable. Xu Zi Yan had originally found some skin-tight undergarments he had never wore before from the side of the trunk, but after he roughly measured it with his hand he still gave up on that piece.With this type of close-fitting clothes, if it didn\u2019t fit it would for sure be very uncomfortable. In the very least, right now he felt that the close-fitting clothes he was wearing could in no way compare to the undergarments he used to wear.Loudly telling the attendents outside to prepare some undergarments for Xu Zi Rong, Xu Zi Yan turned around. At a speed comparable to a running stream, he lifted Xu Zi Rong up and dumped him into the water.With the sudden attack, Xu Zi Rong hadn\u2019t even reacted yet when he was already thrown into the tub. Too late to try preventing it, he fiercely choked on a mouthful of water.Then with the sound of splashing, Xu Zi Yan also jumped into the tub. He lifted the Xu Zi Rong who he had almost choked to death as a result of his rude actions before seriously saying: \u201cYou see, if I wasn\u2019t here, you just might drown in this wooden tub.\u201dXu Zi Rong roared in his heart: If it wasn\u2019t for you, bastard, who threw me into the tub, how could I drown!!!However, his face didn\u2019t leak a single bit of his true thoughts. Xu Zi Rong wiped his face before softly saying, \u201cBig brother is right.\u201d\u201cEn, so obedient!\u201d Xu Zi Yan felt overjoyed. He picked up some soap made from Chinese honey locusts from the stool on the side, before he efficiently washed himself till he was all clean. Then, in the middle of Xu Zi Rong\u2019s ineffective refusals, Xu Zi Yan cleaned him from his head to his feet until the younger was sparkling clean.Through this bath, Xu Zi Rong\u2019s body was completely seen by Xu Zi Yan. From the top to the bottom, inside and outside, almost everything had been touched by Xu Zi Yan once. Even his little Zi Rong didn\u2019t escape the other\u2019s poisonous hands.During the bath, Xu Zi Rong also glanced at Xu Zi Yan\u2019s crotch. He slightly curled his lip. In this aspect, his little Zi Yan wasn\u2019t much bigger than his own! In the future, it would become even more uncomparable!After leaving the bath tub, Xu Zi Rong picked up the undergarments that were just delivered and quickly wore them. He now understood: Xu Zi Yan was currently treating him like how a girl would treat her fabric dolls. The other wished he could do everything for him. In fact, Xu Zi Rong could guarantee that when he was wearing the clothes by himself, he saw Xu Zi Yan show a regretful face!!!boy-doll-fabric-3\u201cThank you big brother, washing up felt very nice.\u201d Xu Zi Rong said in a whisper. Even if his heart had already vomited so much it was about to vomit blood, he still kept a calm face.\u201cTch, a small child must take a lot of baths!\u201d Xu Zi Yan\u2019s mouth nagged like this, but his hands already lifted a towel to help Xu Zi Rong dry his hair.Xu Zi Rong\u2019s hair was both black and thick, and in his hands were as smooth as top-grade silk. Xu Zi Yan nagged on one side, while helped him dry his hair on the other. The Xu Zi Rong at the moment looked as if he was a lotus that had just broke the water\u2019s surface. Delicate eyebrows, red cheeks that were inflamed because of the warm air, and black yet thick beautiful hair. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact Xu Zi Yan had just personally helped him bathe, he would have really wanted to doubt a bit if the other wasn\u2019t actually a girl.Xu Zi Rong didn\u2019t know what the other had thought of, but Xu Zi Yan suddenly grabbed his shoulders before the older seriously stared at him.Xu Zi Rong\u2019s heart suddenly jumped. He didn\u2019t know if he had accidentally exposed something, for Xu Zi Yan to look at him like that.\u201cZi Rong, you look very beautiful.\u201dXu Zi Rong\u2019s mask had a small moment where it cracked, but it quickly returned to normal. He would have never imagined that Xu Zi Yan, with his serious face, would tell him this when the other opened his mouth!!!Xu Zi Yan did not notice Xu Zi Rong\u2019s unusual look, and only sincerely and earnestly said, \u201cZi Rong, you must remember, afterwards when you leave the house you must be very careful. There\u2019s a lot of strange uncles who love pretty children your age, and they might do some very bad things to you. So if big brother isn\u2019t by your side, you must be very careful.\u201dThinking about it, he also added another warning. \u201cIf someone touches you here\u2026\u2026\u201d he pointed to Xu Zi Rong\u2019s lower body, \u201cor here\u201d, he also pointed to the other\u2019s butt, \u201cyou must start screaming, okay?\u201dXu Zi Rong put on a face as if he had half-understood, before nodding hard. His heart had suddenly became a bit cold. The things Xu Zi Yan had said were things he had of course already known. In addition, he also clearly remembered how, a bit after he had arrived at Xu family, he was tricked by a child from a branch clan and went outside. In a small alley, he was trapped by a very disgusting man.He didn\u2019t know whether or not that man appearing there was a coincidence, but he remembered the look in that man\u2019s gaze.At that time, if a person hadn\u2019t came when he started yelling for help, he didn\u2019t know what that man would have done to him.After that man ran away, even after he turned into a blood devil he didn\u2019t find him again. So even though he didn\u2019t know whether that man and the \u2018big brother\u2019 in front of him had any connections, he still decided to place the blame of that matter onto Xu Zi Yan\u2019s head!\u201cIf you really encounter that kind of person, don\u2019t hesitate and kick his lower body hard. How much strength you have, use it all. Don\u2019t be afraid to kick him to death or disable him. If there are any consequences, big brother will take responsibility!\u201d Xu Zi Yan\u2019s expression was very serious. This was because he was very clear that this kind of thing had a huge psychological shock on a small child.In fact, he extremely loathed those perverts that liked to play with children. Because Xu Zi Yu had also looked very pretty, he was also targeted by this same kind of pervert. After that pervert was pummeled by him, he was sent to the police, and after investigations reality was that the children this pervert had played with before numbered over a dozen. This made Xu Zi Yan really regretful. If he had known earlier he would have hit the other even harder, and if he hit the pervert so much so that the pervert could no longer take care of himself, that would be good too.According to the original\u2019s memories, that man who trapped Xu Zi Rong was indeed someone former Xu Zi Yan had found. The Xu Zi Yan today naturally wouldn\u2019t do this kind of thing, but it had reminded him that this cultivation world had the same type of perverts. His little Rong was this adorable, so some pervert might really target him.Mm, the strength of him the big brother must be even stronger in the future. Otherwise his wish of protecting his little brother might not even be fulfilled!Xu Zi Rong didn\u2019t know that such a topic actually aroused Xu Zi Yan\u2019s motivation. But the distance between the two were very close, and he felt that the other\u2019s aura had suddenly changed. It seemed to be\u2014\u2014a breakthrough in his state of mind.Xu Zi Rong\u2019s heart felt cold. In his last life he already knew that Xu Zi Yan\u2019s talent was godly, but it still wasn\u2019t this good!The new change in his frame of mind allowed the imposing manner of his body to suddenly increase. Though Xu Zi Rong\u2019s cultivation was not yet high, his eyesight was still very good. Seeing that Xu Zi Yan\u2019s moment of insight was enough to allow the other to attempt a breakthrough, Xu Zi Rong quickly opened his mouth to try and interrupt this advancement.\u201cBig brother\u2026\u2026\u201dXu Zi Rong\u2019s sentence wasn\u2019t even finished when he was interrupted.Xu Zi Yan tightly held his hand, and his expression was very serious. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Zi Rong, big brother will for sure protect you. No matter what, if big brother doesn\u2019t fall down, there will be no one who could harm you!\u201dAfter Xu Zi Yan finished saying those words, his momentum reached its peak and all the spiritual qi in the courtyard was absorbed into his body.With a \u2018ka\u2019 sound, Xu Zi Yan\u2019s aura froze, before the spiritual qi suddenly gushed out of his body\u2014\u2014he reached the sixth layer of Qi Condensation stage!Xu Zi Rong stared at that pair of clear eyes and concealed the shock in his heart.With all the experience he had acquired from his last life, and the things that allowed him to have much more experience than ordinary people, he could tell just from someone\u2019s body language if they were lying or not.And his shock at this moment was because he did not see a trace of falsity in Xu Zi Yan\u2019s eyes. In other words, Xu Zi Yan really vowed to protect him.This\u2014\u2014how could that be?!!In Xu Zi Rong\u2019s brain appeared a speck of confusion. The impression of Xu Zi Yan in his mind and the Xu Zi Yan in front of him was way too different, to the point he already began to feel some puzzling emotions.He slowly nodded his head, but this was just an instinctive reaction. But in Xu Zi Yan\u2019s eyes, it seemed as if this little brother had finally approved of him.He rubbed Xu Zi Rong\u2019s small head and smilingly said, \u201cZi Rong really is my little lucky star. See, the moment you came, big brother broke through.\u201dXu Zi Rong forced himself to lift the corners of his mouth, before revealing a very ugly smile. In the past the things he were always called by, other than devil it was demon star. Being called \u2018lucky star\u2019, this was really the first time he heard it. The thing that made him feel even more gloomy was that he already used his chance to interrupt Xu Zi Yan\u2019s sudden enlightenment, but he didn\u2019t expect the other to still break through! It really let others feel a lot of resentment!\u201cAlright, you should go and rest a bit. When it is time to eat I will wake you up.\u201d Xu Zi Yan rubbed Xu Zi Rong\u2019s head, before he pushed the other to his bed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thus, he softened his voice. \u201cI want to eat meat.\u201dXu Zi Yan\u2019s forehead wrinkled a bit, and once again his brain thought up a lot of scenes where poor Xu Zi Rong didn\u2019t receive much care. Distressed, he said: \u201cAlright, then tonight we\u2019ll eat meat. We\u2019ll eat a lot of meat.\u201dXu Zi Rong bashfully smiled once before squirrelling into his blankets. His two wide eyes kept blinking innocently at Xu Zi Yan, as if his request had made him feel very embarrassed.Xu Zi Yan smiled before squeezing the other\u2019s cheeks. It was both smooth and tender, and the texture was even better than watery tofu.Xu Zi Rong kept a smile on his face, but his heart already scratched down another mark for him to remember. Wretched bastard, he actually dared to touch his face. Because Xu Zi Rong looked beautiful, in his last life a lot of people coveted him. But after his title as the blood devil became known, don\u2019t talk about touching him, even those who tried talking dirty to him were so thoroughly erased that not a single speck was left!He waited for a while when he realized that Xu Zi Yan didn\u2019t have any intentions of leaving. Slightly knitting his brows into a frown, he quietly whispered: \u201cBig brother, you must be busy.\u201dXu Zi Yan shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t have much things to do. Actually, when you go to a new place you probably won\u2019t sleep well, so if someone accompanies you it might be a bit better.\u201dA strange feeling emerged in Xu Zi Rong\u2019s heart, something that felt both sour with a bit of warmth.He pushed down this strange feeling before lightly biting onto his lower lip. Then, he faintly told Xu Zi Yan, \u201cBig brother, with you looking at me like this I\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026I can\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d After saying that he bowed his head as he adopted a look of guilt.Xu ZI Yan suddenly felt upset over his own carelessness. He was worried that Xu Zi Rong wouldn\u2019t feel accustomed to his new environment, but he forgot that right now he was part of those \u2018unfamiliar\u2019 surroundings.Whether it was the memories of the original Xu Zi Yan or the contents of that novel, it all made him feel feelings of pity for \u2018Xu Zi Rong\u2019, this tragic figure.As a child of an unwanted lover, he didn\u2019t receive any care from the Xu family and was rather tortured. If we said it in a slightly exaggerated manner, if Xu Xiao never brought him back, perhaps Xu Zi Rong would never become that twisted blood devil.According to the description of the book, the blood devil was apparently unfeeling and cruel without the slightest bit of mercy in his heart. Later, in order to control the whole cultivation world, he even released a large amount of blood devil blood-sucking insects. The number of these blood-sucking insects was huge and they also bred very quickly. Only by controlling their mother bug could you completely eradicate them.Back then, the reason Bai Hua entered the devil\u2019s palace was to try and persuade Xu Zi Rong to give up his plans. He never expected that the blood devil would refuse to admit he was the one behind it, and even kidnapped Bai Hua afterwards.The blood devil\u2019s behaviour thoroughly enraged Tianyu Sect\u2019s Sect Leader Lin Xiaotian, Moyu Long Court\u2019s boss Mo Zi Yuan, and Xu family\u2019s successor Xu Zi Yan. The three of them, Bai Hua\u2019s husbands, banded together to launch an attack against the blood devil\u2019s palace.fortuna_castle_ca_dmc4Whether it was Tianyu Sect, or Moyu Long Court, or even the Xu family Xu Zi Yan created again, at the end of the novel they all had enormous power.With the power of those three families coupled with the people sent from smaller sects and families, and after gathering almost 90% of their manpower, did they successfully enter the blood devil\u2019s palace.It wasn\u2019t necessary to give you the details of the battle afterwards. Under the full affront of the three of them, blood devil Xu Zi Rong thoroughly lost. His spirit fell into the hands of Xu Zi Yan, and in order to take revenge so he could appease Bai Hua\u2019s anger, Xu Zi Yan baked his soul with the Nine Yang Dark Fire until Xu Zi Rong\u2019s spirit scattered.white_fire_by_xkibaxAnd then after that, the three of them plus Bai Hua used Xu Zi Rong\u2019s blood to attract the attention of the blood-sucking insects\u2019 mother bug. In one fell swoop they destroyed all of them, and thus they became the world\u2019s four Honoured Elements who thoroughly controlled the situation in the Xuan region.The novel had Bai Hua as its protagonist, and it was natural that it would praise him to the heavens. Excluding the tragic and happy story of him, Lin Xiaotian, Mo Zi Yuan, and Xu Zi Yan, toward Bai Hua\u2019s personality and conduct there was even more praise. The final ending of the novel was that the four of them became the leaders of their region, before living happily ever after.It sounded very perfect, but it was in fact very fake\u2026\u2026Because Xu Zi Yan deduced a lot of different things from the (past) Xu Zi Yan\u2019s memories.In the very least, the blood-sucking insects invading the Xuan region had nothing to do with the blood devil. In addition, Xu Zi Rong had no plans of controlling the mother bug in order to control the whole blood-sucking insect population.In other words, Xu Zi Rong was completely innocent in the matter with the blood-sucking insects. But whether it was Lin Xiaotian or Mo Zi Yuan, or even the original Xu Zi Yan, none of them had any thoughts of helping Xu Zi Rong exact justice.In their point of view, whether Xu Zi Rong did it or not, that didn\u2019t matter. In any case, they had wanted to use Xu Zi Rong\u2019s blood to attract the mother bug of the blood-sucking insects, and they had no intentions of letting him live. Dead was dead, so why would anyone want to argue for his innocence? In the cultivation world there were many people who died in injustice, let alone a blood devil who had previously humiliated Bai Hua. Just for this one point, it was already enough for them to shatter Xu Zi Rong into a million pieces!Xu Zi Yan felt a bit depressed when he saw that memory.Throughout the whole book, although Xu Zi Rong\u2019s personality twisted later on, he never did any mass killings without no cause. Most of the people he killed were the ones who had grudges against him. Occasionally there were other people who died by his hands, but they were the ones that coveted his beauty or his power.In other words, Xu Zi Rong never did anything that surpassed Xu Zi Yan\u2019s bottom line. The only time it did happen was the blood-sucking insect catastrophe in the book. In that disaster, too many people had died, but in the end it was proven that there was no relationship between this matter and Xu Zi Rong.An innocent child, was forced step-by-step by others to become the blood devil. Afterwards, he was killed because of a matter he didn\u2019t even do. He didn\u2019t even get peace after his death, for after he was killed his soul was drawn out again to be tortured: this seemed way over the top for Xu Zi Yan!Xu Zi Yan also did not have the personality of a Holy Father. He was a bit violent, and also had a short temper. The Xu Zi Rong of today has already been taken under his wing, so he would never allow others to easily bully his own little brother.The main point was, towards Xu Zi Rong he was to some extent empathetic. In addition, when he first saw him, he couldn\u2019t help but think of Xu Zi Yu. The Xu Zi Yu at Xu Zi Rong\u2019s age was also a white, tender, and delicate pretty boy. He was unable to unfeelingly watch this kind of child be forced onto that kind of dead end.\u201cAlright, in that case big brother will leave. Have a good rest and sleep assured. Later big brother will come and wake you up.\u201d Xu Zi Yan smiled at Xu Zi Rong, before he turned away and left his own bedroom.He casually called a maid to his side and asked her to bring him to Xu Zi Rong\u2019s room.The maid had delicate features, and her pair of elegant phoenix eyes widened seductively. Unfortunately, Xu Zi Yan had always been very slow in the emotions\u2019 field, and completely did not notice that this maid was fluttering her eyes at him.The yard of Liu Shang Court was very big. Other than Xu Zi Yan\u2019s master bedroom, there were still a dozen empty rooms. The maid with the phoenix eyes who was throwing coquettish glances at a blind man couldn\u2019t help but bite her lower lip. She cursed quietly in her heart, \u201cDamn, it\u2019s all because of Ruo Qi that fox, or else why would Young Master not spare me a single glance?\u201dGoing through the winding corridor on the side with Xu Zi Yan, and then bypassing the small martial arts training field, the phoenix eye maid leisurely walked in front of Xu Zi Yan. She twisted her graceful figure, again trying to attract Xu Zi Yan\u2019s attention.Although Xu Zi Yan was a bit slow in the emotions department, he wasn\u2019t a fool. When there\u2019s a woman in front of you who was constantly stroking her hair coquettishly, it was something you can\u2019t ignore even if you wanted to.\u201cRuo Hua, do you not know how to walk?\u201d Xu Zi Yan asked in an ice-cold tone.The maid called Ruo Hua suddenly stiffened, before she lowered her head, eyes reddening.Xu Zi Yan didn\u2019t have any protective feelings for the fairer sex. Although he never talked about love, he had a loyal mindset for feelings of love. He was very envious of the feelings between his parents, and also hoped to meet a woman who would make his heart thump.His talent was outstanding, so he was destined to attract the attention of a lot of women. But other than that woman who would let his heart thump, he didn\u2019t want to have any emotional entanglements with anyone else.Perhaps in this world, it was normal for a man to have three wives and four concubines. And even the protagonist of that novel had three distinguished men surrounding his side. But for Xu Zi Yan, feelings were always the thing between two people. Add another person, and it would only tear apart a successful couple.In fact, he was really confused about what had happened in that book. How could those three men tolerate other people and share their love? If it was him, he would rather give up his feelings than let his love be treated so cheaply!\u201cYoung master, we\u2019re here.\u201d Ruo Hua said softly, her tone filled with hidden bitterness and her delicate face looking both lovely and pitiful.If it was an ordinary person, they might really be unable to bear this lovely and pitiful face and would thus embrace the other to console them. Unfortunately, after Xu Zi Yan inherited his parent\u2019s estate, he could be considered as Mr. Perfect; tall, handsome, and rich. He had encountered seduction attempts made with skill much higher than her\u2019s, and there were even some who stripped before climbing into his bed. This kind of small temptation was really not worth his time.\u201cThis is it?\u201d Xu Zi Yan didn\u2019t even glance at Ruo Hua before turning around to inspect the room.This was practically at the edge of Liu Shang Court and there were at least two hundred to three hundred metres from his own bedroom. Although to a cultivator this distance was practically nothing, he was more concerned about how the attitude the people here had toward Xu Zi Rong was revealed.Contempt!\u201cWho was the one who picked this room?\u201d Xu Zi Yan snapped.Ruo Hua was scared by his sudden tone, before she stammered a reply, \u201cIt was\u2026\u2026was big sister Ruo Qi.\u201d\u201cRuo Qi?\u201d Xu Zi Yan immediately remembered that beautiful woman. His face filled with black lines.Fuck, wasn\u2019t that woman the maid who deflowered the original Xu Zi Yan?The author has something to say: Xu Zi Yan\u2019s domineering side has leaked! A young master must have the aura of a young master!Xu Zi Rong silently wrote in his diary: Today Xu Zi Yan touched my face, in the future I must return the favour and touch his face twice!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cTommorow, transfer Ruo Qi out of Liu Shang Court, and then move Xu Zi Rong\u2019s bedroom to the one neighbouring mine.\u201d Xu Zi Yan said sternly.Ruo Hua\u2019s heart trembled. Before today Ruo Qi had always been Liu Shang Court\u2019s most favoured maid. So much that it was even faintly discernable to other people that she was almost about to fly off the branches and reach the heavens. But nobody would expect that her casual arrangement of Xu Zi Rong\u2019s bedroom would anger Xu Zi Yan. This not only allowed Ruo Hua to once again become aware of Xu Zi Yan\u2019s unfeeling nature, but to also let her become aware of\u2014\u2014 Xu Zi Rong\u2019s importance.\u201cYes,\u201d Ruo Hua no longer twisted her waist or fluttered her eyelashes. Instead, she fixed her gaze onto her toes.After being transferred out of Liu Shang Court by the young master, it was certain that Ruo Qi\u2019s coming days won\u2019t be pleasant to live. Before not grasping the preferences of the young master, she did not want to accidentally provoke Xu Zi Yan.Raising his eyebrow and giving Ruo Hua a glance, Xu Zi Yan felt very satisfied. He admired smart women the most. Wanting to use her thin wrist to attract his attention, this could be understood, but the most important thing was to be able to assess the situation.Although some people said that extremely smart people never lived long, Xu Zi Yan believed that if he had to get along with a group of idiots, then he would be the one with a short life! He would be infuriated to death!\u201cZi Rong likes pink, so decorate his whole bedroom in pink. You should also go and prepare some things children would like. On the way, bring back my Shuang Yu sword to me.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Ruo Hua docilely replied. Though at the start she almost could not resist laughing when she heard Xu Zi Rong liked pink, the moment Xu Zi Yan mentioned his Shuang Yu sword her amusement completely became horror.Shuang Yu sword was the gift Xu Xiao gave Xu Zi Yan when he turned ten years old. The grade was not that high, but it was something quite rare, and it was a tool made specifically for youths to help them cultivate. Xu Zi Yan practically regarded that sword as his baby, and normally nobody would ever dare to touch it.Unfortunately, in the past two years Xu Zi Yan grew too quickly and his figure changed a lot. Thus, that Shuang Yu sword was no longer suitable for him to use, which was why it was placed into his storage room. However, every now and then Xu Zi Yan would personally return to do some maintenance on the beautiful sword.Although Xu Zi Yan didn\u2019t explicitly say it, it wasn\u2019t hard to infer the meaning of his previous words. He wanted to gift that sword to Xu Zi Rong for the other\u2019s self-defence. This approach had completely exceeded Ruo Hua\u2019s expectations, but it had also allowed her to deeply understand Xu Zi Rong\u2019s position in Xu Zi Yan\u2019s heart.In the whole of Liu Shang Courtyard, under the circumstances where everybody had thought that Xu Zi Yan would loathe Xu Zi Rong, he instead walked the opposite path. Truly, nobody could guess what was happening in Xu Zi Yan\u2019s mind.No matter how you say it, Xu Zi Yan had already sent a clear message to everyone through Ruo Hua\u2019s mouth: Xu Zi Rong was his younger brother, and he was also a much beloved little brother.Ruo Hua\u2019s actions were really quick. When Xu Zi Yan completed his daily practice on his training field, she had already fixed up the bedroom given to Xu Zi Rong.7afed4e2d1d9558de52ee6a43dfd0bab-merle-oberon-acapulcoXu Zi Yan glanced at that completely pink room and suddenly felt as if he was a blind dog. However, since it was something his little brother had liked, it wasn\u2019t really too unbearable.He contemplated the room furnishings and flipped through the clothes prepared for Xu Zi Rong before gently nodding his head. This Ruo Hua had truly understood the meaning of his words. The things in the room weren\u2019t all premium goods, but they weren\u2019t things that would suggest they were treating Xu Zi Rong unfairly.\u201cAlright, you can go now.\u201d Xu Zi Yan waved away Ruo Hua, before turning around to go back to his room.Bypassing the screen, the sleep Xu Zi Rong was getting on his big bed was still very fragrant. Xu Zi Yan thought that if Xu Zi Rong could open his eyes to see his new bedroom, the boy would for sure be pleasantly surprised.He slowly walked to him and leaned over, before he picked up Xu Zi Rong.The body of the eight-year old was really too thin. In the bath before Xu Zi Yan had already noticed this, but to be again confirmed here, some doubts arose in his heart.Was that \u2018true love\u2019 of Xu Xiao mistreating Xu Zi Rong? How did he even thin to this degree?Xu Zi Yan shook his head. The person was already dead, so looking into that now didn\u2019t hold much meaning. He threw away that thought in his mind before embracing Xu Zi Rong and walking over in big strides to the neighbouring room.The \u2018fast-asleep\u2019 Xu Zi Rong ensured his breathing was very even. After Xu Zi Yan left, he began to organize the memories in his head.From waking up after he died to entering the Xu home, he practically didn\u2019t have any time to reflect on his experiences. After finally arriving at a relatively safe place, of course he was going to take the chance to organize his thoughts.Right now he was only eight years old. Although he would be able to enter the first layer of Qi Condensation stage in three more days, that cultivation was really too weak. Don\u2019t even talk of Xu Xiao, for even Xu Zi Yan could easily crush him to death.He must endure!Tolerance, lying low-key, these were things he were so familiar with he could do it with his hands tied behind his back. In his past life, if he hadn\u2019t been the very definition of low-key, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to live that long.Deeply taking in a breath before gently exhaling, Xu Zi Rong slowly opened his eyes, his black pupils reflecting calm.He was a child of eight years old, so he must display the innocence of a small child. Although the word was already something far away from who he was, he felt that with his acting he should be able to do it.Currently the only thing that made him feel a bit uncomfortable was precisely Xu Zi Yan\u2019s attitude toward him. The Xu Zi Yan now and the Xu Zi Yan from his previous life were basically two different people. The other people in Xu family clearly didn\u2019t change, so why would Xu Zi Yan change so much??Xu Zi Rong felt a bit annoyed because he was unable to guess the reason behind Xu Zi Yan\u2019s big changes. With his rebirth, his greatest advantage was how he was now familiar with the development of many things. If everything followed what had happened before, he was confident in reaching Nascent Soul in a much shorter amount of time, and maybe even Immortal Ascension. When that happened\u2014\u2014Xu Zi Rong\u2019s gaze immediately became ice-cold. Lin Xiaotian, Mo Zi Yuan, and also that Bai Hua. Those people, he would for sure not let them get away!As for Xu Zi Yan?Xu Zi Rong\u2019s eyes squinted a bit. If it was that Xu Zi Yan from the past, the moment he had the ability he would very impolitely slaughter him. He would extract Xu Zi Yan\u2019s soul and torture him day and night, so the other would understand the deep pain of a hurting soul.But this Xu Zi Yan\u2026\u2026Xu Zi Rong felt a flash of doubt in his mind. Perhaps\u2026\u2026this Xu Zi Yan was also reborn?Xu Zi Rong\u2019s heart startled in fright, but he then shook his head.Impossible! If Xu Zi Yan was also reborn, he was afraid that the moment the other saw him he would strangle him to death. How could Xu Zi Yan be so good to him?He could clearly remember that when Xu Zi Yan tortured his soul, the other constantly cursed him out as he accused him of humiliating his lover.It was truly funny. That Bai Hua bitch that pretended to be pure and virtuous, he saw loads of people like that. Even if someone gifted Bai Hua to Xu Zi Rong he still wouldn\u2019t accept him.It was only people like Xu Zi Yan and Ling Xiaotian who were so stupid, regarding a slut as their treasure.The corner of his mouth overflowed with his ridicule. He really could not understand it. Although he loathed Xu Zi Yan and the other two, he could not help but admit that whether it was Lin Xiaotian or Mo Zi Yuan, they were all rare people with outstanding talent. How could they be stupid to this degree, and be so crazy about a man that even their intellect was lost?Despite the men under his hands, his devil\u2019s palace was so easily broken in by the three of them. The deeds of his first general Xuanyuan Hui could also not go unnoticed. He remembered that when Xuanyuan Hui died in his hands, the other could not resist glancing at Bai Hua a final time. Unfortunately for him, at that time Bai Hua was busy being lovey-dovey with Lin Xiaotian, so how could he spare time for that idiot?His eyebrows furrowing more and more, Xu Zi Rong could not help but suspect whether or not Xu Zi Yan was possessed.But even if the other was possessed, he still didn\u2019t have a reason to be so good to him. You have to know, although he was an illegitimate child, he still was of Xu blood. Even if people didn\u2019t want to harm him, they still wouldn\u2019t be that good to him.Cycling through different explanations, Xu Zi Rong was still unable to find a reasonable theory to explain Xu Zi Yan\u2019s attitude to him. It made him increasingly more irritable.Just when he was unable to suppress the anger in his heart, and when he was about to find a place to vent a bit, a small movement occurred at the door.Xu Zi Rong immediately closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep. Sure enough, the door quickly opened and someone walked in.In the Xu family, the only person who could so openly enter Xu Zi Yan\u2019s bedroom, other than the owner himself there wouldn\u2019t be any others. Xu Zi Rong buried the anger he had wanted to vent away deep inside his heart and gentled his breathing so he could look like he was sleeping.Xu Zi Yan did not notice he was only pretending to sleep. Although his power was much stronger than Xu Zi Rong\u2019s, he wasn\u2019t bored to the point of using his spiritual energy to check how deeply someone was sleeping.untitledHe picked up Xu Zi Rong, and walked step-by-step into the neighbouring room. Gently, he placed the other onto a soft bed, before he very carefully tucked him in to prevent Xu Zi Rong from catching a cold.After doing all of this, he softly said, \u201cZi Rong, this is your bedroom ah. When you wake up you\u2019ll have a surprise.\u201d Xu Zi Yan finished talking and quietly crept out, as if he feared waking up the sweetly sleeping Xu Zi Rong.After Xu Zi Yan left, the room once again returned to a quiet state. Xu Zi Rong did not open his eyes, but the sour and sweet feeling he had suppressed before appeared once more.This kind of feeling made people feel a bit uncomfortable, but Xu Zi Rong did not know why he would, contrary to what one would expect, really like it. It was like one of those old, burning-as-they-went-down type of wines. The first mouthful would be both spicy and bitter, but the aftertaste would let the whole body warm up.The anger he had forcibly suppressed seemed to have also calmed a bit. But Xu Zi Rong was also very clear that if he didn\u2019t find a chance to vent it out, once others found the violence he hid in his heart, his troubles would be many.The reason behind his sudden anger was unknown to him. It was as if his grievances began accumulating ever since Xu Zi Yan had abused him in his previous life.After practicing the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, this violent feeling became more and more strong. From time and time, he had to vent out the anger accumulated in his heart, or else there would be danger of going astray.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySince he had not started practicing the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, he was still capable of suppressing that ball of anger. But this time was limited, and should he not vent his anger out, sooner or later there would be very serious consequences.Xu Zi Rong exhausted his patience and slowly opened his eyes. He did not hold much hope for Xu Zi Yan\u2019s \u2018surprise\u2019, but he wasn\u2019t immune to some curiosity.At the moment when he opened his eyes\u2014\u2014Fuck! \u2014\u2014A foul word bursted out of his mouth.Pink walls, a pink roof, even the bed sheets on his bed and his blankets were different shades of pink.A peach pink, a light pink, a golden pink. All kinds of bright and eye-catching colours intertwined in the inside of this small room. Because of the season, even the window had silvery-pink wind chime hanging there.0d32ca8b41ea00f8beaf64300e03b0ae\u2014\u2014That wind chime followed the blowing breeze and gently moved, issuing a crisp jingle.At this moment, Xu Zi Rong profoundly felt what other people call\u2014\u2014to reap what one had sown.Damn it!The blood devil lord\u2019s devil\u2019s palace had always been either pitch-black or blood-red in colour, so how could there possibly be this kind of pink that only small girls would like??!!That bastard Xu Zi Yan must be humiliating him!!! This had to be intentional!!!Mister Blood Devil had ignored his own likes at that time and instead said pink to make Xu Zi Yan uncomfortable, so he stubbornly decided that this must be Xu Zi Yan\u2019s scheme.As for the contents of that scheme? That wasn\u2019t important! It was always Xu Zi Yan who had schemes!!!Xu Zi Rong\u2019s face became gloomy as he saw this room that made him wish he had a blind dog\u2019s eyes. Secretly grinding his teeth, he thought: this deed he will also remember. Sooner or later, he will pay back everything to Xu Zi Yan!Knock knock knock!Just when Xu Zi Rong was grinding his teeth and trying to imagine how he was going to torment Xu Zi Yan in the future, someone knocked softly onto the door.Xu Zi Rong instantly assumed an innocent and guiltless face, before softly saying, \u201cCome in.\u201d\u201cZi Rong, you woke up?\u201d Xu Zi Yan pushed open the door and walked inside. Seeing Xu Zi Rong swathed in blankets and sitting up on his bed, with his two wide eyes still looking as if he was half-asleep, he couldn\u2019t help but smile as he spoke.Xu Zi Rong cursed silently in his heart, but revealed some shyness on his face as he affirmed, \u201cUhuh, just woke up.\u201dXu Zi Yan laughed a bit before using some force to ruffle his hair. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing embarrassing about just waking up. You are in your home, not outside.\u201dXu Zi Rong lowered his head slightly, the corner of his mouth twerking in ridicule: his home? Ha\u2026\u2026his home only consisted of that ice-cold devil\u2019s palace. The Xu house would never be his home.\u201cDoes Zi Rong like this room?\u201d The Xu Zi Yan who did not notice Xu Zi Rong\u2019s sneer softly asked.Xu Zi Rong\u2019s expression had that small moment where it cracked, but he quickly returned to his usual mask. He forcefully revealed a smile: \u201cI really like it, thank you big brother.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re already calling me big brother, so why are you being so courteous!\u201d Xu Zi Yan patted Xu Zi Rong\u2019s shoulders and said: \u201cWith your big brother here, in the Xu family there wouldn\u2019t be anyone who would dare to bully you. If there is anyone who would raise their hand against you, just tell big brother. I\u2019ll help you \u2018teach\u2019 them a lesson.\u201dHaving heard that, Xu Zi Rong\u2019s eyebrows jumped a bit. When he was living with his mother in that small town, there had also been a time where he wondered how it would be like to have an older brother. Would he also be like the big brothers of other families, who had cared for and protected their younger brothers?Later, after his mother died and he was found by Xu Xiao, he also felt some hope like that on the road back to the Xu family.Unfortunately, after he arrived at Xu family, the first thing he received from Xu Zi Yan was just the word \u2018bastard\u2019. It completely shattered that longing in his heart.Now after rebirth, this Xu Zi Yan intended to be a good big brother? It was a pity, because he had enlightened way too late. If it was before, perhaps he would still have some hopeful expectations of this. But after experiencing his previous life, he had long thrown away those excessive emotions.Though he was sneering in his heart, Xu Zi Rong\u2019s face was still the very picture of an obedient child. Raising his head, his pretty and wide eyes blinked cutely. \u201cEn. I know, big brother.\u201dA white and tender pretty child saying these clever heartfelt words, of course Xu Zi Yan\u2019s little brother complex would erupt. Tugging Xu Zi Rong over with one hand, he firmly pressed a kiss onto the other\u2019s cheek: \u201cZi Rong is too sweet! Big brother really likes you~\u201dThis time Xu Zi Rong\u2019s eyebrow only jumped a bit. After the previous shocks, he was now extremely calm. He discovered that the current Xu Zi Yan had no resistance at all to his obedient looks and manner. As long as he seemed well-behaved, Xu Zi Yan would reveal that face that looked as if he couldn\u2019t wait to dig out his own heart for him.Kissing his cheek? That was completely fine. His mental notepad had it all remembered, and there would be chances to repay the other in the future.\u201cAh, I almost forgot!\u201d Xu Zi Yan knocked on his own head with force as he released Xu Zi Rong.Xu Zi Rong subtly retreated a bit. Although he could now tolerate the affectionate gestures from Xu Zi Yan, having a little less was always good. Or else remembering all of the other\u2019s deeds was also quite troublesome.\u201cIt\u2019s almost time to eat. Clean up, and let\u2019s go together.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Xu Zi Rong obediently answered before crawling up from the bed.The clothes he was wearing now were the changpao Xu Zi Yan had selected for him before he went to sleep. It was soft and comfortable, and even sleeping in it didn\u2019t bring any discomfort.While he cleaned up, he also observed the various furnishings in the room.When he had first opened his eyes, he was only preoccupied by how pink the room looked. He actually didn\u2019t keenly observe anything.Eyes gazing around, Xu Zi Rong\u2019s eyebrow slightly rose. It wasn\u2019t that there was something wrong with the furnishing, but that the furnishing was too good. It really exceeded normal standards.For Xu Zi Rong\u2019s eyesight, obviously he could tell how many good things were in this room.That insignificant-looking potted plant at the corner of the room, it was the third-ranked spiritual energy gathering spiritual grass. This spiritual gathering spiritual grass had the ability to slowly absorb spiritual energy. If you put a stalk in someone\u2019s room, it could promote the room owner\u2019s ability to absorb spiritual energy.32034 Red Accent PotThe vase placed on that table was the second-ranked Four Seasons Like Spring. It\u2019s ability was also the same as it\u2019s name and it could control the room\u2019s temperature and humidity, so one could always enjoy the most comfortable atmosphere.Just these two items would waste a considerable amount of spiritual energy, and a single look at these things would tell one that it was prepared for someone about to become a cultivator. Xu Zi Rong couldn\u2019t even deceive himself and say that it was hand-me-downs from someone else.Xu Zi Rong sat on his bed and stared smilingly at his Xu Zi Yan, his gaze suddenly turning complex. Before he had thought he had understood Xu Zi Yan to the other\u2019s bones, yet the person in front of him had completely overturned his previous thoughts.Was\u2014\u2014he really Xu Zi Yan?Quietly recovering his gaze, the Xu Zi Rong that raised his head was again that seemingly timid and shy young child.\u201cBig brother, I\u2019m ready.\u201d\u201cAlright, then let us go.\u201d Xu Zi Yan very naturally took Xu Zi Rong\u2019s hand, and led him on the path toward the main house\u2019s dining room.Perhaps it was the doubts that existed in his heart, but on this walk Xu Zi Rong carefully observed Xu Zi Yan.His gait, his posture, and all his little habits. No matter what he saw, it was the same as the Xu Zi Yan in his memories.The only difference you could find was that black pair of eyes.The Xu Zi Yan in his last life, his pair of black eyes always revealed aversion and hate whenever the other saw him. Sometimes, there were even hints of killing intent.However, the Xu Zi Yan in this life didn\u2019t have any of that raring to kill intent in his eyes. Rather, they were always filled with smiles and pampering love.Xu Zi Rong was very puzzled. In his last life, it was only after he had arrived at Xu family was he told that his own mother was in fact Xu Xiao\u2019s lover, and that Xu Zi Yan\u2019s mother had died because she had found out.In the beginning, he did not know where he had went wrong for Xu Zi Yan to bully him like that. It was after he had grown up a bit did he finally understand: his very existence was the biggest reason for Xu Zi Yan to hate him.Recalling the dislike the previous Xu Zi Yan had for him, Xu Zi Rong couldn\u2019t help but sneer in his heart: all the thousands of mistakes were Xu Xiao\u2019s mistakes. For it to anger his mother to death, it was only because the two lovers still longed for each other even after they had parted. In the end, if Xu Zi Yan truly wanted to help his mother get revenge, his biggest enemy should have been his father, Xu Xiao. But Xu Zi Yan was nothing but a weak bug and knew that it was impossible for him to fight his father, and that his own future also depended on his father\u2019s future. Thus, he vented out all of his resentment onto the Xu Zi Rong who was incapable of fighting back.To sum it all up, only the weak wanted to take advantage of the weaker and cowered from the strong. If back then he also had Xu Zi Yan\u2019s talent and thus won Xu Xiao\u2019s protection, perhaps Xu Zi Yan would have not dared to retaliate against him.But that was just a guess at the previous Xu Zi Yan\u2019s thoughts. The more Xu Zi Rong thought, the more he began to believe that there was something wrong with the Xu Zi Yan in front of him.Even if all of his habits were the same as the previous Xu Zi Yan\u2019s, just the fact that there wasn\u2019t any hate in the other\u2019s gaze whenever Xu Zi Yan saw him was completely abnormal!\u201cHm? Is there anything Zi Rong wants to say?\u201d Becoming aware of how focused Xu Zi Rong\u2019s gaze was on his figure, Xu Zi Yan lowered his head and asked.Slowly lowering his eyelids, Xu Zi Rong softly said: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, it\u2019s just that\u2026\u2026big brother is too good to me.\u201d\u201cHaha, a big brother being good to his little brother, isn\u2019t that normal?\u201d Xu Zi Yan replied with a smile.Xu Zi Rong smiled but did not speak, and instead quietly whispered in his heart: Perhaps a good relationship between other brothers was normal, but between you and me, there can never be a day where our relationship is good.The distance between Liu Shang Court and the main house was very far. Xu Zi Yan deliberately did not increase his speed, and thus the two brothers practically had a leisurely attitude as they slowly walked towards the dining room.Xu Zi Rong was led by Xu Zi Yan as they held hands so there was no need for him to look at the roads. But in actuality, even without Xu Zi Yan there was no way he could ever get lost.After all, he had lived in this Xu family for so many years. Unfortunately, this ice-cold family had never let him experience the warmth of a real one.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLightly touching the wrist of his right hand, Xu Zi Rong\u2019s face turned unreadable. Once upon a time, a really obvious scar was located there. Even after he became a Nascent Soul cultivator and became capable of changing his body, he did not erase that scar.That scar was the result of the time where he had fallen down the cliff and almost fell to his death, and the scar was something he had carved onto himself as he struggled madly on a sharp stone. It was also at that time where he completely cut off the last tie that connected him to Xu family. That scar was used to remind him, to not forget all the shame and suffering Xu family gave him!\u201cFather,\u201d holding Xu Zi Rong\u2019s hand, Xu Zi Yan slowly walked into the dining room.The dining room was very spacious. What was placed in the middle of the room was a table that was sufficient enough to sit more than a dozen people.4ff642a7cba0d1933996a7c1f8ce1072Xu Xiao sat in the seat of honor, and to his right was an empty chair.Xu Zi Yan knew that the empty chair was especially prepared for him. You could tell from this chair that in the Xu family, his position was merely second after Xu Xiao\u2019s.Of course, this chair assigned to Xu Zi Yan didn\u2019t mean he had any real power. It was rather completely a status. He was able to sit on that chair not because he made a lot of contributions to the Xu family, but because of Xu family\u2019s future expectations of him.A cultivating family like the Xu family, in order to reach its own interests, would give all of their resources to the talented disciples in the family. This had nothing to do with being fair or not fair, because if Xu Zi Yan was in charge of such a family, he would have done this as well.From the point of view of the current Xu family, with Xu Zi Yan\u2019s Lightning Heavenly Spiritual Vein, becoming a Core Formation cultivator was practically certain as long as he wasn\u2019t too stupid.And for Xu family, adding another Core Formation cultivator to their middling family had an unimaginable effect.Any huge aristocratic family needed patrons and talents to be able to develop over time. In the past the Xu family grew just like this, and Xu Zi Yan, in the eyes of Xu family, would be their most dependable supporter in the future.After all, in this world, the relationship between family and the relationship between a master and disciple were the most reliable connections one could have. As long as they didn\u2019t go crazy, the cultivators from a cultivation family were usually more caring to the families they came from.The Xu Zi Yan who was currently enjoying this kind of treatment from his family would naturally have to bear the corresponding obligations. But although he did not volunteer to enter this body, he also didn\u2019t wish to escape.This was because there was no one in the Xu family who treated him badly, so he obviously didn\u2019t bear anyone any hate.In his memories, although there were a lot of people from the Xu family who had bullied Xu Zi Rong, ultimately the one who did the most was Xu Zi Yan. Other people would not be bored to the point of bullying a small child.As for the select others, they were only trying to please the higher ups above them. It could be said that in the whole Xu family, Xu Zi Yan was the only one who had such malicious loathing for Xu Zi Rong.In the blink of an eye, Xu Zi Yan had already understood his own position. This time, a lot of things did not happen. Since Xu Zi Rong didn\u2019t suffer any torment, he could totally live happily with Xu Zi Yan in the Xu family. Taking this route would be much safer than becoming a blood devil. In the very least, if the situation with the blood-sucking bugs really happened, Xu Zi Rong wouldn\u2019t be the one to carry such a big and black pot1.As for the original Xu Zi Yan\u2019s mother, Xu Zi Yan could only quietly whisper a sorry, for he did not have any intentions of taking revenge for her. After all, in the end the culprit of her tragic end was Xu Xiao. The original didn\u2019t retaliate against Xu Xiao for revenge, so he, someone who had no grudges against Xu Xiao, had even less reasons to do it.Other than the empty chair beside Xu Xiao, the other chairs were already taken by the rest of Xu family\u2019s children.These children were all the talented kids from the branch families. To be able to eat in this room, it was a good indicator of their strength.There were both young children and young adults. The oldest seemed to already be twenty, and the smallest only looked around eight or nine. Most of those with a comparably profound mind all gave Xu Zi Rong an examining look, while the younger ones stared at this new addition because of pure curiosity.Xu Zi Rong looked shy as he hid behind Xu Zi Yan, and from time to time he would secretly peek at them. He looked to be somewhat timid.A small child\u2019s fear of strangers, everyone could understand it.Many of the people watching them had that kind of idea expressed in their eyes, and when even more people noticed how Xu Zi Yan was holding onto Xu Zi Rong\u2019s hand, he gave the other a friendly smile.Xu Zi Rong bowed his head slightly in order to hide the deep-seated hate in his eyes. He knew most of the people in this room, and these people left him indescribable pain in his memories.He did not dare to raise his head, afraid that the head Xu Xiao would notice the hatred in his eyes. He was confident in deceiving these children with his mask, but to confront the wily old fox Xu Xiao, he didn\u2019t have the slightest bit of self-assurance.If one asked him who he had hated the most in the Xu family, then that was undoubtedly Xu Zi Yan. But if one were to ask who he had blamed the most, then it was nevertheless Xu Xiao.Back then, if Xu Xiao had not brought him back to the Xu family, he might have had a hard life in that small town but he wouldn\u2019t have been bullied as much.Father. This title was supposed to bring warmth and protection, but in Xu Zi Rong\u2019s eyes it could only correspond to an ice-cold face.For even though he lived in the Xu family for so many years, he had never seen Xu Xiao smile at him once.Feeling stifled and unable to restrain himself, the violent feeling in his heart began to stir once again. Both of his eyes began to gradually become tinted in blood-red. Xu Zi Rong knew that if this continued, there was no doubt that Xu Xiao would notice something abnormal. With the temperament of the other person, towards this kind of danger, Xu Zi Rong would for sure be killed in advance. Although the current Xu Zi Yan was very caring to him, once Xu Xiao decided something, Xu Zi Yan and his sixth layer of Qi Condensation stage had absolutely no power against him.In addition\u2026\u2026Xu Zi Yan might not necessarily be truly opposed to it.Thinking of that, the corner of Xu Zi Rong\u2019s mouth revealed the hints of a sneer. Even until now, he still did not know what Xu Zi Yan was up to. But for him to believe that the current Xu Zi Yan held absolutely no hostility against him after only an afternoon of contact? That would be absolutely impossible!\u201cZi Rong? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Xu Zi Yan was slightly concerned with the noise that sounded beside his ear.Xu Zi Rong shook his head whilst it was drooping. He absolutely did not dare to raise his head right now. After all, his pair of bloodshot eyes was impossible for an eight-year old child to have.814075292fca76f467d837e2d0ce5175-eye-types-vampire-eyes\u201cDo you feel unwell?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026just\u2026\u2026there\u2019s so much people.\u201d Xu Zi Rong used the softest tone he could muster to say those words.As expected, Xu Zi Yan didn\u2019t have any doubts. Smiling, he comfortingly patted his head: \u201cDo not worry, big brother is by your side. All the people here will be your friends in the future, so rest assured.\u201dXu Zi Rong jeered at that in his heart with ridicule: friends? A blood devil like him never needed things like friends!Hanging his head, Xu Zi Rong only tightly grasped Xu Zi Yan\u2019s hand. Xu Zi Yan was also unconcerned, and just thought that the small child who had to suddenly meet so many people was just a bit scared of strangers.He held Xu Zi Rong\u2019s hand and slowly walked over to his chair. Looking at all the seated people, he turned to the two waiters at the side and said: \u201cGo and add another chair.\u201dThe moment he uttered his words, the dining room was suddenly plunged into a shocked quiet. All the people who had been quietly whispering to each other stared at Xu Zi Yan, which was followed by a look to Xu Xiao.Xu Zi Yan\u2019s voice was not loud, but it was enough to let everyone hear. Making such a gesture was also something well-thought out.In the Xu family, he as the young master still had a lot of authority. He wanted to show everyone his attitude toward Xu Zi Rong through today\u2019s performance, and to also let everyone know not to bully Xu Zi Rong.The two waiters who heard his words didn\u2019t immediately move, and instead they both glanced at Xu Xiao.Xu Xiao took his sweet time to slowly wipe his hands with a pure-white towel, before he set the cloth down and coldly rebuked: \u201cDid you not hear the young master\u2019s order?\u201dWhen the two waiters heard this, they were startled and rushed over to grab a chair. Xu Zi Yan\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change at all, and he only looked at Xu Xiao as he said: \u201cFather, we can serve the meal now.\u201dXu Xiao gave Xu Zi Yan a deep look before saying in a profound tone: \u201cStart the meal.\u201dIt was only then did everyone pick up their chopsticks and started eating.In the beginning, the atmosphere was still a bit tense. But after a while, and seeing that nothing had happened, the children quickly pushed what had happened before toward the back of their minds as they began to discuss some of their current cultivation problems.Xu Zi Yan, after saying the words he did to Xu Xiao, no longer opened his mouth to say anything else.On one hand he was facing a cheap father, who always gave him the feeling as if the other was a cunning sales person in a mall he had to gather all his guts to face. His heart always felt very pressured. On the other hand, he had taken the place of the other\u2019s son. Even if he had all the memories, and knew what would happen in the future, he was still worried that he would suddenly expose something.In this cultivation world there was something called possession. If the other party thought Xu Zi Yan had possessed his son, then he would be in big trouble. With his little cultivation of sixth layer of Qi Condensation stage against Xu Xiao\u2019s cultivation level that neared Core Formation, he could only wait to be trampled to death.While Xu Zi Yan was currently feeling guilty at heart, he did not know that at that moment Xu Xiao was feeling happy about his son\u2019s growth.The news of how Xu Zi Yan had banished Ruo Qi from his courtyard was placed onto Xu Xiao\u2019s table almost right after he had made his previous decisions. He usually did not monitor his son like that, but Xu Zi Rong\u2019s appearance made him really want to know his own son\u2019s reaction.He had to say, before the reactions of Xu Zi Yan made him feel quite disappointed. In his point of view, twelve years of age didn\u2019t count as being young anymore, but Xu Zi Yan still had the reckless and impulsive personality as he did before. Even if this Xu Zi Yan did not like Xu Zi Rong, he still should not have shown that so clearly on his face and let other people know. If he did that, should something bad happen to Xu Zi Rong in the future, wouldn\u2019t everyone know it was Xu Zi Yan who did it?Whether it was being a cultivator or being a normal person, the people who stood in a clearing would always suffer more than people who stood in the dark.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRegarding his son\u2019s discipline issues, Xu Xiao was considerably concerned. So he had originally thought to take some time out of his schedule to have a good chat with Xu Zi Yan, but he had not expected that after Xu Zi Rong arrived, some of Xu Zi Yan\u2019s actions were even beyond his own expectations. At this point, Xu Xiao was extremely satisfied.It was chaotic in the dining room, and often there were children who loudly pondered the cultivation problems brought up. The older youths also talked to each other and discussed things, and only Xu Xiao maintained his not slow yet not fast speed as he elegantly ate. He would also occasionally speak up and give some advice, and anyone who got his pointers all had looks of ecstasy.All the people in this room were the future pillars for Xu family. The higher their future cultivation levels, the more help they would be for the Xu family. As Xu family\u2019s cultivator with the highest cultivation level, Xu Xiao\u2019s advice for them was extremely rare. Because although he wasn\u2019t stingy at giving out his pointers, as the Xu family Master he was just too busy, and there wasn\u2019t anyone who would dare bother him for insignificant things like that.Xu Xiao was giving advice to the youngters when suddenly, his heart stirred. He twisted his neck to give Xu Zi Yan a look, before he slightly raised his eyebrows. \u201cZi Yan, you broke through?\u201dThe dining room, because of those words, once again instantly silenced. Everyone\u2019s gaze began to brush against Xu Zi Yan\u2019s body again.Xu Zi Yan nodded in an extremely tranquil manner: \u201cYes, that\u2019s right Father. Today I somehow had a moment of enlightenment, and luckily broke through into sixth layer of Qi Condensation stage.\u201dHiss\u2026\u2026The sound of inhaling resonated in the dining room.Xu Zi Yan breaking through into the fifth layer of Qi Condensation stage was something that happened only half a month ago. In this short amount of time he already broke through into the sixth layer of Qi Condensation stage, it really was something worthy of the Lightning Heavenly Spiritual Vein!Xu Xiao was satisfied to the point he stroked his own beard. Toward his own son, he was even more satisfied. To raise your cultivation through some insight, this was definitely something that was extremely rare.In fact, the epiphany one has when they raised their cultivation was less important. What was important was one\u2019s emotions and mood. For this so-called epiphany, naturally it was already something most people already understood. In general, this epiphany was usually closely related to the people involved.Xu Xiao\u2019s action of stroking his beard slightly paused. Combined with the performance of Xu Zi Yan and his attitude toward Xu Zi Rong, he seemed to have stumbled upon the reason for Xu Zi Yan\u2019s moment of enlightenment.Sighing a bit in his heart, Xu Xiao could not help but feel more relaxed. The matter with Xu Zi Yan\u2019s mother was really an accident. His feelings for Zi Yao were probably not deep, but respect was definitely present.The maid who had deliberately told Zi Yao of Xu Zi Rong\u2019s mother\u2019s existence was already killed by him. Before he killed her, he learned through the maid\u2019s soul that the real mastermind behind the incident had been his \u2018true love\u2019.When he first found out about this after he searched the maid\u2019s soul, he could not believe it. But after that, what was left was only a sigh. The once innocent and cute young girl was now left with only a heart full of calculations. If she had not been so greedy, perhaps Xu Xiao would not have had to \u2018force\u2019 her to die.Nodding slightly, Xu Xiao told Xu Zi Yan: \u201cLater, come to my study room.\u201d\u201cOf course, Father.\u201d Xu Zi Yan respectfully answered.Innately, Xu Zi Yan did not like Xu Xiao. This was because, as a man, he was not faithful to his wife, and as a father, he did not protect his own son. It could be said that if Xu Zi Yan had to grade him, even a passing grade would be too high.But the quality of Xu Xiao\u2019s personality didn\u2019t have much to do with Xu Zi Yan. Because no matter what, at the end of the day, Xu Xiao was quite good to Xu Zi Yan. So although he did not have any intentions of falling out with him, it was still difficult to treat the other as his father.To sum it all up, even Xu Zi Yan himself had no idea what kind of attitude he should use to face Xu Xiao. He could only gauge things one step at a time.At the dinner table, Xu Zi Rong also did not say a single word from the beginning to the end. Fortunately, his \u2018shy, scared of strangers\u2019 image was extremely successful. Other than Xu Zi Yan who kept stacking different kinds of meat into his bowl, making him eat so much he felt a bit bloated, this meal of his had been quite pleasant.instant-pot-beef-and-broccoli-recipe-820\u00d7531After eating dinner, Xu Zi Yan sent Xu Zi Rong back before following Xu Xiao to the other\u2019s study room.The father and the son chatted a bit in the study room, and once they finished Xu Xiao satisfyingly allowed Xu Zi Yan to leave.The contents of their conversation made Xu Xiao feel extremely satisfied. Xu Zi Yan\u2019s ability to grasp the bigger picture made Xu Xiao feel a bit more confident in his son.Towards how Xu Zi Yan was intending to carefully nurture Xu Zi Rong into becoming his assistant, Xu Xiao had no objections at all. After all, Xu Zi Rong was still of his own blood. Although because of his \u2018true love's actions he did not have a good impression towards Xu Zi Rong and he even intended to use Xu Zi Rong as Xu Zi Yan\u2019s whetstone, since Xu Zi Yan was the one taking the initiative to give up, he was also not that cruel to needlessly ruin his own son.In his point of view, although Xu Zi Rong\u2019s talent was quite average, he was still very young. As long as Xu Zi Yan was willing to carefully nurture him, in the future the other may really become a good helper.And more importantly, Xu Zi Rong was but eight years old. The biggest advantage of being young was how much easier it was for the children to cultivate good feelings toward the family.Although Xu Zi Rong had always lived together with his mother before, Xu Xiao believed that with the resources of Xu family, they would for sure allow Xu Zi Rong to experience better days.Little children ah, it was a bit ugly to hear but coax them a bit and they would become obedient. Not to mention, this child of his seemed a bit timid, so controlling him would be even easier.The only thing that bothered him was that without Xu Zi Rong, he was hesitating whether it was necessary to find his son another whetstone. But after thinking about Xu Zi Yan\u2019s performance today, he put down that idea.For Xu Zi Yan\u2019s performance today, he temporarily didn\u2019t need any whetstones. If there was a need for one in the future, finding another then wouldn\u2019t be too late.Xu Zi Yan\u2019s mood was also very good. Today his chat in the study room with Xu Xiao gave him slightly more confidence for his future days.Although he did not know why Xu Xiao thought that his plan to carefully raise Xu Zi Rong was connected to his sudden moment of enlightenment, it was such a convenient excuse so of course he would abuse it.Because he was well-acquainted with the plot, and combined with the original\u2019s memories, he quickly spun out a bunch of excuses. Ultimately, he linked together his sudden attitude change and his moment of enlightenment today.Whether Xu Xiao had really believed in it or not, he had no idea. On the surface, he seemed to have believed it, and in the very least the other did not find anything wrong with his excuses so theoretically there shouldn\u2019t be a big problem.Today, the conversation between the two of them could be said that it was the first step of Xu Zi Yan changing Xu Zi Rong\u2019s fate. After all, the final say in the Xu family still rested on Xu Xiao. Should Xu Xiao set his heart on being adverse to Xu Zi Rong, other than Xu Zi Yan leaving the family with Xu Zi Rong, he really didn\u2019t have any other plans.Now that this problem have been solved, both parties were extremely happy.Xu Zi Yan now has Xu Xiao\u2019s support, and Xu Xiao received Xu Zi Yan\u2019s \u2018forgiveness\u2019, so both sides could be considered as quite happy.Because his chat with Xu Xiao didn\u2019t take long, the sky hadn\u2019t turned black yet when he returned to Liu Shang Court. On the way there were many people who saluted him, so in Xu family, his status could be said to be extremely high.Hmm?Xu Zi Yan\u2019s footsteps paused slightly, before they quickly returned back to normal.He saw a silhouette beyond the floating \u2018room\u2019 in front of him, but in the blink of an eye, that silhouette suddenly disappeared.Before when he was together with Ruo Hua, he had once tried to sneakily take out that novel from the floating \u2018room\u2019. However, it seemed as if Ruo Hua didn\u2019t see it at all, which helped him determine that this novel probably had some restrictions on it so that nobody from this world could see it.As for that floating \u2018room\u2019, he had also pondered about it for a long time. Unfortunately, he still did not know what role that kind of thing played. Other than putting some small things inside, the volume of the \u2018room\u2019 meant that it was impossible to fit something big into it.That invisible room was suspended in thin air. It was like there was a transparent glass box in front of his eyes, but this glass box was completely separated from everything. Xu Zi Yan could pass his hand through it, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to touch anything.Only when he \u2018wanted\u2019 to take out that book could he actually touch it, otherwise that floating room was as if it was separate from the world. It existed, but it was impossible to touch it.But just now, he say a person\u2019s shadow from the back of that \u2018room\u2019. Actually, saying it was a person\u2019s shadow was not right. It was more accurate to say that he saw a shadow that only consisted of someone\u2019s chest.Although it had happened in a flash, Xu Zi Yan was really confident in his own sight. That kind of situation was as if an invisible person had walked past him. He could not see the other, but on the surface of the floating room, he was able to see the person\u2019s silhouette.According to the memories in his head, he knew that in Xu family there were secret guards who specialized in learning stealth techniques. But though a secret guard was always beside their owners to protect them, and he himself was quite valued, Xu Zi Yan still shouldn\u2019t have received treatment like this.He slowed down, before seemingly carelessly turning around. To other people, it looked as if Xu Zi Yan was just admiring the scenery. But that secret guard hidden in the dark had a strange feeling, as if his figure had been exposed to the eyes of his charge.The secret guard shook his head. That was impossible. Xu Zi Yan\u2019s cultivation was only at the sixth layer of Qi Condensation stage, so it was impossible for the other to notice his figure. But he didn\u2019t know if his eyes were playing tricks on himself, for when Xu Zi Yan\u2019s gaze swept over his hiding place, the boy seemed to have paused.Xu Zi Yan turned around on his spot, and when his back was facing a certain direction, his eyebrow slightly rose.Xu Xiao was really good to him, this son of his. Even hidden guards were sent to him. Only\u2026\u2026was this guard sent to protect him or to observe him, this was something he had to slowly figure out.Since this hidden guard didn\u2019t deliberately expose himself to him, of course Xu Zi Yan wasn\u2019t stupid enough to speak up and tell the other how he was already exposed. He merely wore a smile as he slowly walked back to his courtyard, but that smiling expression made the hidden guard knit his eyebrows.\u201cZi Rong, are you alright ah?\u201d Xu Zi Yan lightly knocked on the child\u2019s door. He wouldn\u2019t randomly burst into Xu Zi Rong\u2019s room because the other was only eight years old.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing this person in front of him with his constant pampering smile on his face, Xu Zi Rong\u2019s mood became extremely complicated.Clearly the appearance, voice, and his habits were all the same as the Xu Zi Yan in his memories. But unfortunately, regarding their attitudes toward him, the Xu Zi Yan in front of him did a 180 degrees turn.When Xu Zi Yan followed Xu Xiao to talk, Xu Zi Rong returned to his room to find the Shuang Yu sword on his table.Putting the Shuang Yu sword into his room, the meaning of that was self-evident. But Xu Zi Rong still profoundly remembered how in his last life, simply touching this Shuang Yu sword was enough to make Xu Zi Yan break his arm.At that time, what did the other say?A bastard actually dares to touch my stuff? You\u2019re really looking to die early!With his hand over his face, the corner of Xu Zi Rong\u2019s mouth curved into an ice-cold smile. At that time, what had he wanted to do? Ah, right. Back then he had just been very envious of how Xu Zi Yan could cultivate, so he had wanted to secretly touch that seemingly powerful Shuang Yu sword.Unfortunately, the result of touching that sword once was a broken arm. In addition, since that time he was never again allowed to enter the place near the martial arts training field.Slowly lowering his hands, Xu Zi Rong calmly stared at that Shuang Yu sword, looking neither sad nor happy.Exactly how much Xu Zi Yan loves this sword, Xu Zi Rong understood it clearly. If they did not receive Xu Zi Yan\u2019s permission, nobody would dare to put this sword into his bedroom.Why would Xu Zi Yan give him this sword?Why was Xu Zi Yan so good to him??He was merely an orphaned eight-year old child with no one to rely on, so no matter what he could not understand Xu Zi Yan\u2019s aim.He wanted to be a good older brother? Everything he did was purely to benefit Xu Zi Rong?This idea only sprouted in his mind for a second before he nipped it in its bud. This was because anyone with a brain knew that was something impossible!Xu Zi Rong was extremely confused like this as he constantly tried to deduce Xu Zi Yan\u2019s aims when Xu Zi Yan himself knocked on his door. Thus, Xu Zi Rong could only bring along his complex mood as he opened his bedroom door for the other.\u201cWhat is Zi Rong doing?\u201d The Xu Zi Yan who didn\u2019t know how confused Xu Zi Rong was about his attitude asked with a smile.Although there was a lot on Xu Zi Rong\u2019s mind, he still immediately put on the mask of an obedient little brother. \u201cBig brother, I was looking at the Shuang Yu sword.\u201d\u201cAh? Does Zi Rong like it?\u201d\u201cI like it,\u201d Xu Zi Rong bit his lower lip and embarrassedly laughed. \u201cBut, big brother\u2026\u2026Shuang Yu sword is very precious right?\u201dXu Zi Rong was very smart, thus naturally he didn\u2019t directly say that this was Xu Zi Yan\u2019s treasured baby. After all, he had just arrived at Xu family, so this wasn\u2019t something he should know.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Xu family isn\u2019t unable to buy you a sword, so if you like it then that\u2019s great.\u201d Xu Zi Yan replied generously.Xu Zi Rong immediately felt a bit flabbergasted. Originally, he had thought that Xu Zi Yan would especially emphasize how this sword was something he liked, to subtly suggest how good the other was to him. However, he did not expect that Xu Zi Yan would end this thought from the start, and would instead deliberately lower the true value of the Shuang Yu sword.But despite knowing this, Xu Zi Rong was of course not stupid enough to bring it up. Since Xu Zi Yan didn\u2019t want to say it, then it was fine if he just pretended to not know. In any case, his current cultivation level was not high enough, so with the Shuang Yu sword beside him, it was indeed a bit safer.Xu Zi Rong shyly smiled and carefully put the Shuang Yu sword away. Then, he sat across from Xu Zi Yan in a well-behaved manner. He now utterly believed that the other didn\u2019t come to find him just because of the Shuang Yu sword.Xu Zi Rong made a good guess. The Shuang Yu sword indeed didn\u2019t hold much significance to Xu Zi Yan. Since it was suitable for Xu Zi Rong\u2019s current use, then he might as well give it to him. Instead, Xu Zi Yan actually came because he wanted to chat with Xu Zi Rong about some cultivation problems.In the memories of the original Xu Zi Yan, because of his extreme hatred toward Xu Zi Rong, naturally the original didn\u2019t give Xu Zi Rong any opportunities to cultivate. So until Xu Zi Rong quietly left Xu family, nobody knew where the other had come in contact with cultivating.The novel had only mentioned it once as well. The inheritance of the blood devil cultivation could only be found in the alley of a mountain. So of course, Xu Zi Yan thought that as long as he taught Xu Zi Rong the correct cultivation path early on, the other would naturally not cultivate in the ways of devil arts cultivation.\u201cStarting from tomorrow, you should come with me to learn cultivation at the martial arts training hall, alright?\u201d Xu Zi Yan chuckled lightly as he told Xu Zi Rong.The hand Xu Zi Rong hid in his sleeves suddenly clenched as his face morphed into the expression of someone at loss. \u201cMartial arts training hall?\u201dXu Zi Yan lightly patted his own forehead. \u201cI forgot to tell you, the martial arts training hall is the place for Xu family children to cultivate. You are my younger brother, so naturally you have the qualifications to go there.\u201d Pausing a bit, Xu Zi Yan continued to explain. \u201cXu family is a cultivation family. Although you can still live without cultivating, you are still young and do not know the cruelty of the outside world. Having more skills mean that if you have to go out in the future, you won\u2019t be bullied by others.\u201dXu Zi Rong rather excitedly nodded his head. \u201cI understand now.\u201d\u201cMm. In that case take a good rest tonight. Tomorrow morning, I will come and get you.\u201d Xu Zi Yan gently rubbed Xu Zi Rong\u2019s head.Xu Zi Rong smiled good-naturedly, and watched Xu Zi Yan leave.After Xu Zi Yan left, his face swiftly changed as his expression became unreadable.What was the real meaning behind Xu Zi Yan\u2019s actions?In his past life, Xu Zi Yan was afraid that in the future he would go against him, so Xu Zi Rong did not even touch the outskirts of the martial arts training hall. So why was it that now, Xu Zi Yan took the initiative to take him there?Although Xu family\u2019s cultivation techniques wasn\u2019t something he valued, the ability to use the martial arts training hall to practice his Blood Sea Heart Sutra was also a good idea.Taking a deep breath, Xu Zi Rong slowly pressed down the doubts in his heart. No matter what, this was a good thing. Although he was did not understand Xu Zi Yan\u2019s intentions, he really did not worry about if there was any danger.No matter what, he already had the experience of an adult. He truly did not believe that he could not win against a child who was only twelve years old (not!)!A night passed like that\u2026\u2026On the morning of the next day, Xu Zi Rong got up extremely early. However, no matter how long he waited, Xu Zi Yan never appeared. Seeing that the first class of the martial arts training hall was about to start, he could not help but sneer. Was this first giving him hope, and then letting him down so he would feel sad?It really was a child\u2019s trick. If Xu Zi Rong was actually an eight-year old child, perhaps he would really have some kind of reaction. Unfortunately, a truly strong soul was the one inhabiting the weak body of today. These kind of small tricks didn\u2019t mean anything to him.Although he thought that Xu Zi Yan\u2019s underhanded tricks were really rotten, Xu Zi Rong still decided to knock on Xu Zi Yan\u2019s bedroom door. After all, he had made an appointment with the other party yesterday, so if the other person doesn\u2019t appear, looking for them was the natural reaction of a young child.Since it was the neighbouring room, after stepping out of his room it didn\u2019t take many steps to bring him to Xu Zi Yan\u2019s bedroom door.The maid guarding the bedroom door looked both cunning and proper. Xu Zi Rong lightly furrowed his forehead: he remembered that back then, the maid Xu Zi Yan pampered the most was a maid called Ruo Qi or something like that. She wasn\u2019t the one standing before him.\u201cYoung Master Zi Rong,\u201d Seeing Xu Zi Rong walk over, Ruo Hua slightly bowed a bit.It was the first time Xu Zi Rong heard a title like that, and thus his eyebrow jumped a bit.But he still revealed an extremely cute smile. \u201cThis big sister, my older brother\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung Master Zi Rong has scared me. Calling me Ruo Hua is enough.\u201d Ruo Hua was startled by the other\u2019s words. What a joke! Yesterday, it was merely because Ruo Qi did not properly arrange Young Master Zi Rong\u2019s bedroom location and thus she was chased out by the Young Master. Ruo Hua was just a small maid, so how could she be Young Master Zi Rong\u2019s big sister? If that was heard by Xu Zi Yan, she would only follow Ruo Qi\u2019s footsteps.Xu Zi Rong paused a bit before changing his words. \u201cRuo Hua, is big brother in there?\u201dWith a smile on his face as he stood there, Xu Zi Rong calmly waited for Ruo Hua to tell him that Xu Zi Yan had already departed to the martial arts training hall and that he shouldn\u2019t ask for things that didn\u2019t belong to him. Unexpectedly, Ruo Hua began saying something that was completely opposite of what he had originally thought: \u201cYoung Master is still asleep in his room. Does Young Master Zi Rong want to go in? Young Master has long ordered that if Young Master Zi Rong is looking for him, you could go to him no matter what time it was.\u201dXu Zi Rong\u2019s expression had a moment where it cracked. The scene where the other humiliated him actually did not appear??!!Xu Zi Yan was really in his room??!!\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to see big brother.\u201d The shock in his heart was intense like a surging wave, but the look on Xu Zi Rong\u2019s face was still the same humble one from before.Ruo Hua quietly pushed open the door and gestured for Xu Zi Rong to enter. Then, she once again returned to her previous position.\u201cBig brother?\u201d Xu Zi Rong\u2019s brain was moving extremely fast as he tried to deduce the meaning behind this, but even wearing out his mind didn\u2019t help him come up with any answers. According to his guess, at this time Xu Zi Yan shouldn\u2019t be in his room, but he really was here.rl-715-1l\u201cMm\u2026\u2026\u201d Unconscious mumbling was transmitted from behind the screen. Xu Zi Rong\u2019s feet paused a bit, before he stridden around the screen.Xu Zi Yan didn\u2019t like having a lot of shackles on him as he slept, so currently his upper body was naked as he only wore some pant undergarments. He was rolled up in his blankets as he slept sweetly.Xu Zi Rong: \u2026\u2026His thousands of speculations wouldn\u2019t have told him that he would see a scene like this. In any case, he shouldn\u2019t be seeing Xu Zi Yan sleeping like the dead\u2026\u2026\u201cBig brother? Big brother?\u201d Xu Zi Rong had a feeling of defeat, as if he had punched into cotton. If they had followed the development of the original script, he could anger Xu Zi Yan half to death if he just displayed an indifferent smile before expressing how he didn\u2019t care whether he could go to the martial arts training hall or not. However, everything was now thrown upside down! Xu Zi Yan wasn\u2019t trying to mock and ridicule him, because he was still sleeping sweetly in his bed!!!fd14e362dfe3f58fe2e5a6ce8fff3a2a\u2013l-lawliet-death-note-l\u201cMmhm\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu Zi Yan answered him with two mumbles, before he turned around and rolled himself back into his blankets.It had the \u2018even if you kill me I won\u2019t get out of bed\u2019 kind of meaning.Xu Zi Rong was unusually quiet for a long time before he stepped forward and lightly shook Xu Zi Yan. \u201cBig brother, it\u2019s time to get up.\u201dXu Zi Yan mumbled again before turning around and kicking his blankets to the side, and then he stuffed his head into them\u2026\u2026Xu Zi Rong silently supported his forehead. A Xu Zi Yan like this was one he had never seen before, and it really exceeded his expectations.\u201cBig brother, you want to bring me to the martial arts training hall. Remember?\u201d Xu Zi Rong used more force to shake Xu Zi Yan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I almost forgot!\u201dA guy who looked to be in love with his blankets and unwilling to ever part had suddenly jumped out, so it would naturally scare any onlookers. Xu Zi Rong was no exception.He opened his mouth wide and stared at the Xu Zi Yan who was in great spirits, as if the other hadn\u2019t just gotten out of bed, and couldn\u2019t say anything for a long time.\u201cAh! I forgot! I forgot!\u201d Xu Zi Yan said to himself in a low, annoyed tone. He actually overslept, he should really go die!Before he had transmigrated, he already had this bad habit of having a hard time getting out of bed. In modern times however, he had an unequalled and effective way that got him out of bed\u2014\u2014setting more than five alarm clocks!But coming here\u2026\u2026_(:\u0437\u300d\u2220)_, who in the Xu family had enough guts to disturb the Young Master when he was sleeping, ah\u2026\u2026\u201cBig brother\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu Zi Rong hesitantly asked. \u201cAre we still going to the martial arts training hall?\u201d\u201cGoing! Of course we\u2019re going ah! Today it\u2019s big brother\u2019s fault, I actually overslept! I\u2019ll clean up faster!\u201d Xu Zi Yan started dressing himself as he bitterly replied.Xu Zi Rong quietly sat onto a chair as he watched Xu Zi Yan wash up and change his clothes, using all of his four limbs to get ready. His gaze was deep.The Xu Zi Yan in front of him gave him a very intense uncomfortable feeling. Perhaps it was because he was tortured by Xu Zi Yan a few times too much when he was younger, but the other\u2019s mocking tone, his actions, and even the lilting ends of his words were completely remembered by him.But although all the aspects of the person in front of him were the same as the previous Xu Zi Yan\u2019s, he had a \u2018this is a completely different person\u2019 kind of feeling.The corner of Xu Zi Rong\u2019s mouth suddenly revealed the hint of a strange smile. Even if this person wasn\u2019t Xu Zi Yan, what did it matter to himself? The revenge he should deal out\u2014\u2014it still should be done!With the effort of pouring a cup of tea, Xu Zi Yan was already finished cleaning up. Holding onto Xu Zi Rong\u2019s hand, he hurriedly rushed out of the door.Xu family\u2019s martial arts training hall was built in the mountains. Other than the expansive space, another reason for it to be built there was because of the ordinary beasts and the low-level spiritual beats.Perhaps these things would be fatal for mortals, but for disciples that cultivated, it truly provided them the best way to practice.Xu Zi Yan brought Xu Zi Rong on a mad dash. Along the way, chickens flew and dogs jumped as they startled countless maids. But after all, with how highly ranked the Young Master\u2019s position was, of course nobody would dare go to the Master to complain.While Xu Zi Yan was running, he still did not forget to check if anyone was following them in the surface of his floating room whenever they changed directions.Reality went according to what he had expected. Xu Zi Yan saw the figure of a man wearing black flash across his floating room at least three times.His heart was secretly delighted. Although the grade of the stealth cultivation from the Xu family wasn\u2019t high, the effect could be considered as quite good. But even if they took that into account, in front of his floating room there was no escape. So didn\u2019t that mean that those people who were proficient in silent assassination wouldn\u2019t be able to use their abilities in front of him?Thinking up to that, Xu Zi Yan couldn\u2019t help but laugh at himself. His dream was truly beautiful, but reality was cruel. After all, the \u2018room\u2019 was only so big. Unless he constantly used the room to \u2018see through\u2019, the \u2018room\u2019 was something of little value.He helplessly shrugged. Forget it. In any case this thing was something free of charge, and who knew? Maybe at a crucial moment this room would play a key role in helping them. No matter what, this room didn\u2019t take up any energy so it was better to not be too greedy.\u201cBig brother? What happened?\u201d From the beginning to the end of their run, Xu Zi Rong had always been observing Xu Zi Yan\u2019s expressions. Right now this Xu Zi Yan was someone he couldn\u2019t understand or look through, so in his heart, he had already rated this Xu Zi Yan\u2019s danger level as the highest one.\u201cAh? It\u2019s nothing, big brother is just dazing off.\u201d Xu Zi Yan replied casually.Xu Zi Rong felt his chest tighten, as if there was a breath he couldn\u2019t release.Silently suppressing his angry thoughts, he once again thought that this Xu Zi Yan was really someone extremely strange\u2026\u2026 (no he wasn\u2019t!)One tall and one short child ran in a dead sprint to the martial arts training field. For Xu Zi Rong, Xu family\u2019s martial arts training field in his experienced eyes was just like a small child\u2019s plaything. The reason why he wanted to go take a look was mostly because he was curious about this Xu Zi Yan.He really wanted to know what kind of tricks this Xu Zi Yan who was completely different from the past one intended to play, or\u2026\u2026His dark and gloomy eyes flashed. As a blood devil, Xu Zi Rong understood too much of the evil ways. Although he did not practice that kind of cultivation, there were no lack of mysterious things within those techniques.He had once saw on an old parchment, that previously it was thought that the ancient blood devils knew a method to devour one\u2019s soul.Using this method to possess someone, not only could they understand all the secrets of the eaten soul, even their soul would possess the same wavelength as the other\u2019s. In other words, if someone began to suspect that they were possessed and tried to use their blood to perform a test, they wouldn\u2019t find anything wrong with them.Unfortunately, that parchment page didn\u2019t go into the details of that technique. But since there were remnants of pages like that, who could guarantee that nobody already knew this kind of evil spell?904315b9c44301c2a2c6f4be3869d01ab54bf24e_hqGaze deeply planted on the Xu Zi Yan leading in front of him, Xu Zi Rong let his eyelids lower slightly. Ever since his rebirth, there were too many things that happened differently compared to the events in his memory. In the final analysis, however, the source of those differences were all because of Xu Zi Yan\u2019s attitude toward him.He could even be reborn. Who knew if this Xu Zi Yan he met was one who was possessed? But no matter who the person in front of him was, as long as it wasn\u2019t the previous Xu Zi Yan, he could make a deal with him.In this world, anything could be exchanged if there was interest in it. Although he did not have much strength right now, but with the many more years of experience he had from his previous life, he was well acquainted with the hidden places of some heavenly artifacts.Those things that could cause a great sensation, perhaps his current ability wouldn\u2019t allow him to pursue them. But those secretly appearing precious things, he could totally take advantage of how other people wouldn\u2019t have reacted yet to take them away.With his previous experience, he was completely confident that he could cultivate and break through the first layer of the Blood Sea Heart Sutra much quicker than before. You had to frequently vent out your anger after breaking through into the first later, but\u2026\u2026The corner of his mouth slowly rose into a mocking smile. He was a blood devil, and wasn\u2019t murdering others and setting arson the old profession of a blood devil?In his last life he didn\u2019t do any of this, but those guys decided he was the one who released those blood-sucking devil insects. They even pulled in the whole cultivation world to be his enemies, but in the end wasn\u2019t it so that they could use his essence blood to attract the mother bug?Hmph. For what reason should he give his essence blood to those sanctimonious hypocrites? For a person like him who cultivated using the Blood Sea Heart Sutra method, his essence blood was practically his cultivation. Give it away and his cultivation would fall. For someone with his title, if his cultivation fell wouldn\u2019t what happened afterwards be clear?It was ridiculous. Who did that Bai Hua think he was? What kind of thing did he believed himself to be? Bai Hua thought so highly of himself that the other came and tried to persuade him to sacrifice his own essence blood, did he really think he was some kind of stunning beauty?Anyway, nobody would believe him back then. Thus, in this life it would better if he became a crazy blood devil that slaughtered everybody.In that way, his cultivation level of the Blood Sea Heart Sutra could rise even quicker. After all, human blood was always much easier to use than animal blood, and he wouldn\u2019t need to kill beasts in a death battle. Killing people\u2014\u2014was much simpler than killing beasts.\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Xu Zi Yan\u2019s voice brought Xu Zi Rong out of his thoughts. He looked up and looked around with a face filled with envy and worship, before he asked in slight confusion. \u201cBig brother, this is the\u2014\u2014martial arts training field? Then, could I also practice cultivating here in the future?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d There was no way Xu Zi Yan wouldn\u2019t nod his head. \u201cYou are Xu family\u2019s child, of course you are qualified to cultivate.\u201dXu Zi Rong exposed an expression as if he had only half understood, before he dazedly nodded.wallhaven-277011.jpgXu Zi Yan smiled tenderly before he pointed at a meandering and rugged mountain road. \u201cFrom here on, even if it is to enter the range of the martial arts training field, the regulations of the Xu family states that only those who can get to the martial arts field themselves have the qualifications to learn the Xu family\u2019s cultivations techniques.\u201dWhen he finished speaking, he encouragingly patted Xu Zi Rong\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIn this big brother has no way to help you. But don\u2019t worry, Zi Rong. It is just a bit tiring to climb up there, but there shouldn\u2019t be any problems for you.\u201dXu Zi Rong nodded his head silently. He knew the rules of this family, but in his last life, he didn\u2019t even have the opportunity to come here, so obviously he wasn\u2019t eligible to climb this road.\u201cDo you want big brother to watch you from here, or do you want me to go up first to wait?\u201d Xu Zi Yan considerately asked.Xu Zi Rong smiled shyly. \u201cBig brother can go up, I\u2019m fine by myself.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Xu Zi Yan didn\u2019t say much more, and ceng ceng ceng leapt onto the road and up the mountain. In a few seconds, even his shadow was nowhere to be seen.Xu Zi Rong stared at that huge limestone that was spread on the mountain road, his smile slowly fading away.Xu family\u2026\u2026His mouth silently chewing on these two words, Xu Zi Rong couldn\u2019t say what he was feeling at that moment.The opportunity was so eagerly placed in front of him, but he realized that he had long lost interest in it.It was accurate to say\u2026\u2026ever since he left Xu family in his previous life, he seemed to have lost interest in everything. It was as if his hatred of it helped him to continue living, but after that night it also disappeared.Emptiness? Confusion? He did not know\u2026\u2026At this moment he only clenched his fist, and took step by step toward those limestone stairs.When he stepped onto the first stair, Xu Zi Rong suddenly felt a huge pressure hit his body. His face suddenly changed.Everything was all fake!Xu Zi Rong\u2019s heart instantly cooled. He didn\u2019t understand, Xu Zi Yan could clearly kill him just by moving his hands, so why would the other use so much effort to get him there in order to kill him with a trap\u2026\u2026Did this have a meaning?Confused and puzzled, Xu Zi Rong felt that even in the end he still could not understand how this Xu Zi Yan\u2019s mind worked. But just when he thought he was about to be reduced into smush by that pressure, that pressure was suddenly reduced. It then weakened to the extent where it was possible for him to bear.Xu Zi Rong: ???Suddenly, he remembered the words Xu Zi Yan said to him before he had left: it\u2019s just a bit tiring to climb up there, but you should have no problems.The image in his memory froze on Xu Zi Yan\u2019s handsome face after he said those words, but Xu Zi Rong could clearly make out that from those seemingly indifferent eyes were the hints of a joking smile!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was played!Xu Zi Rong\u2019s face suddenly darkened.The pressure dragging down his body wasn\u2019t too strong. For a child of eight years old like him, it was as if he was carrying a burden that was around five pounds in weight. It wasn\u2019t really something light, but it wasn\u2019t something heavy either. It was just right as it was in the range of what a normal person could bear. However, to bring this kind of pressure with him as he climbed a mountain, he was afraid that instead of being \u2018a little tired\u2019, he would be \u2018extremely tired\u2019 ah!Tightly pursing his lips, Xu Zi Rong scratched down another mark against Xu Zi Yan in the little book in his heart. He stretched out his arms and his neck before arranging himself to be in a more comfortable posture. Then, he began to climb the mountain with his \u2018burden\u2019 on his back.Walking along the stone steps, Xu Zi Rong\u2019s footsteps became more and more heavy.Big droplets of sweat began sliding down his forehead. Originally he thought this was going to be a very effortless mountain hike, but now it seemed that it wouldn\u2019t be so easy.He had forgotten that the him right now wasn\u2019t the strong blood devil from before who could do anything. He was now just an eight year old child. Although he had coincidentally and smoothly sensed spiritual energy yesterday, right now he was but a weak little child.Step by step\u2026\u2026Xu Zi Rong\u2019s red lips had already lost the blood in them. He was bowing his waist to bear the pressure, and his sweat was dripping into his eyes and stinging them.2e12c12230b59f2c4410b10d8b30cc06-running-girls-manga-girlHis eyes became blurry, and the peak of the mountain seemed to get farther and farther away. He didn\u2019t understand why he wanted to continue doing this. With his current skill, even if he didn\u2019t enter the martial arts training hall, Xu Zi Rong could still practice the Blood Sea Heart Sutra by himself.There seemed to be a voice that kept asking him in his mind: why bother? Why should he waste time in the Xu family? There were destined to only be your stepping stone. You only needed to find a safe place, kill a few rabbits, and then you could directly enter the first layer of Qi Condensation Stage. When you were strong enough, these people from the Xu family would be the same as livestock waiting to be slaughtered, and you could kill them off at any time.Xu Zi Rong\u2019s face silently became serious. His exquisite little face revealed a sharp kind of beauty.He bit his lower lip and looked at the blurry mountain peak, his heart overflowing with a dense, unwilling feeling.Forget his last life where he didn\u2019t have an opportunity to come here. In this life, Xu Zi Rong obviously had such a good chance. Would he really give up just because he couldn\u2019t bear the trial?If that was the case, even he would look down on himself! Because this would clearly prove that he really was a waste!Fiercely closing his eyes, Xu Zi Rong took a deep breath before opening them again.He once experienced so much torture before and it still didn\u2019t shake his goal of becoming strong. What was a little mountain hike to him?Step by step, heavy and slow footsteps moved determinedly in the direction of the mountain peak. What Xu Zi Rong didn\u2019t know was that currently, Xu Zi Yan was coldly facing down a yellow-faced, beefy man.80d6713f0eb8e081fc364f958f867ba6-anime-hot-anime-guys\u201cWhy?\u201d Xu Zi Yan looked extremely angry. He long knew that it wasn\u2019t easy to climb up this mountain, but the pressure Xu Zi Rong had to withstand went way beyond his expectations.The yellow-faced person give him a glance. \u201cYoung Master must have forgotten, this is a part of the rules.\u201d\u201cWhat rule!\u201d Xu Zi Yan yelled angrily. The original him and this person was always at odds, so he deeply thought that the other was just taking the opportunity to retaliate.The beefy person\u2019s face didn\u2019t change, and he instead laughingly said: \u201cYoung Master is the Master\u2019s son who has amazing talent. In the future you are destined to enter a big martial arts sect. The martial arts training hall of course wouldn\u2019t dare to disrupt Young Master\u2019s cultivating. But this Xu Zi Rong doesn\u2019t have talent as great as yours. In accordance to the rules of the Xu family, if one of these bastard children brought from the outside world wanted to enter the martial arts training hall, they must withstand two times the pressure to be eligible.\u201d\u201cBut he is only eight years old!\u201d Xu Zi Yan remembered that Xu family really did have this rule, but that was always for a ten year old child.The yellow-faced, beefy man glanced at him before throwing out the words: \u201cThen Young Master can wait until he is ten years old before bringing him back.\u201dXu Zi Yan became suddenly angrier. This year he was twelve years old, but Xu Zi Rong was only eight.When Xu Zi Yan was fifteen years old, he was just in time for the disciple recruitment opening from the Xu family patron\u2019s Liu Guang Sect. With his talent, there was no doubt that he would be recruited by Liu Guang Sect, but at that time Xu Zi Rong would only be eleven years old. If he only started cultivating when he was ten years old, for his Tri-Spirit Vein, even if he cultivated day and night he would at most break into the third level of Qi Condensation Stage. This kind of cultivation level would for sure not be accepted by the Liu Guang Sect.If they did not allow Xu Zi Rong to go with him, Xu Zi Yan was worried that once he left, Xu Zi Rong would be bullied by the other people in the Xu family. If it was really bad, what could he do if Xu Zi Rong became the blood devil again?Did you want him to end up like the original Xu Zi Yan, and hear how Xu family fell whilst he was cultivating in Liu Guang Sect?!!Of course that wouldn\u2019t be okay! When he leaves the Xu family, he must bring Xu Zi Rong along with him and save his little brother from being brought up crooked.After all, with the personality of Father Xu, he really doesn\u2019t trust him!!Xu Zi Yan\u2019s face ashened. All of the things this yellow-faced beefy man said were part of the rules, and nothing was really out of bounds. Even if Xu Zi Yan was angry, he still couldn\u2019t break this rule. Thus, he could only pray in his heart before he helplessly watched Xu Zi Rong persist step by step in walking to the mountain peak.The moment Xu Zi Rong placed both of his feet onto the mountain top, Xu Zi Yan immediately rushed over. He hugged the almost collapsing Xu Zi Rong and carefully inspected him from top to bottom before he let out a breath of relief.Xu Zi Yan turned his head and looked at the yellow-faced man with a bad complexion. \u201cIt\u2019s fine now, right?\u201dThe yellow-faced man had no expression on his face. \u201cSince he got through the Deng Xian stairs, of course he has the qualifications now.\u201dXu Zi Yan secretly ground his teeth. This kind of guy who was dead-set on the rules was the most hateful. However, most of the time there was usually a need for the existence of people like that.He held the semi-unconscious Xu Zi Rong and hastily ran toward a small hut. Because there was a chance of getting injured in this martial arts training hall, Xu family deliberately assigned a permanent and famous doctor there.After Xu Zi Yan left, the eyebrow of the yellow-faced beefy man rose in an undetectable manner.Although this Young Master had unimaginable talent, his temper was moderately bossy. And, relying on his own status, he would frequently skip the martial arts training hall\u2019s classes. He rarely respected the teachings of the yellow-faced man\u2019s martial arts training hall.But the performance of Xu Zi Yan today made the yellow-faced beefy man\u2014\u2014Xu Mo, feel slightly shocked. If it was before, although this Young Master would not disobey his parents and thus was unable to go against him, he would for sure curse him out. This time, who knew he would merely give him a resenting glare and not say any bad words, it really made him\u2014\u2014 his mood feel complicated.If Xu Zi Yan knew what Xu Mo was thinking about, his face would for sure be covered in black lines: was this the revealing of an M\u2019s trait\u2026..When Xu Zi Yan learned from the doctor that Xu Zi Rong was just too weary and was feeling weak because of that, he finally let out a breath of relief.This was just their first day at the martial arts training hall. If it made Xu Zi Rong dislike the Xu family\u2019s martial arts training hall, then that would be troublesome. He could clearly remember how the novel described Xu Zi Rong as the type of person who noted all of his grievances and was extremely mistrustful. Although that novel was from Bai Hua\u2019s point of view and thus might not be credible, combined with Xu Zi Yan\u2019s memories, he could understand it. Because this little child suffered too much when he was young, developing this kind of personality was nothing surprising.But understanding meant nothing. He could do nothing about how the last Xu Zi Rong was raised, but now he was Xu Zi Rong\u2019s older brother. He would never allow his brother become that legendary little devil!\u201cBig brother?\u201d Xu Zi Rong leisurely opened his eyes, his watery and wide eyes blinking cutely as he stared at Xu Zi Yan.In reality, he did not faint. Although the pressure he bore on the mountain was heavy, it still hadn\u2019t hit his limit. Only, at the moment when he reached the top, he saw Xu Zi Yan and his concerned expression. He did not understand why, but it made his mind waver and both his eyes closed.However, he did not hit the ice-cold ground as planned. Rather, two warm arms tightly held him before they picked him up, and then he was taken to this room full with the fragrance of herbs.Xu Zi Rong felt very weird, because he could feel that his long frozen heart had felt a glimmer of warmth.It was really strange. In his last life, he didn\u2019t feel any warmth in all the decades he lived, but now he felt it because of his own enemy.In his heart, he secretly ridiculed his own weakness. Did he really turn into a small child? He even began looking for things like warmth that wasn\u2019t something of significance.\u201cAre you okay Zi Rong? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?\u201d Xu Zi Yan asked softly, his voice still having that crisp sound of youths.\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Xu Zi Rong shook his head, a flash of confusion appearing in his heart. Revealing a curious expression, he asked: \u201cBig brother, why was it that when I went up the mountain, I suddenly felt as if my body was heavier?\u201d\u201cHaha,\u201d Xu Zi Yan laughed a bit. \u201cThat\u2019s because you were walking on the Deng Xian stairs. It\u2019s a type of magical weapon.\u201dXu Zi Rong\u2019s pupils suddenly shrank: magical weapon?!! How did he not know in his last life that Xu family had a magical weapon??\u201cIs this magical weapon really powerful?\u201d Xu Zi Rong immediately became the picture of an inquisitive child. Faintly, he felt that Xu family had hid a lot of things he didn\u2019t know about.In his last life, after he wiped out the Xu family, he took all the good things Xu family had been collecting. He soon found out however that there were only a few cultivation tools. Originally he had thought that it was because Xu family wasn\u2019t strong, so there weren\u2019t any good things. But now that didn\u2019t seem to be the case\u2026\u2026No wonder\u2026\u2026Xu Zi Rong suddenly realized. No wonder before he had wiped out the Xu family, Xu Zi Yan\u2019s cultivation speed wasn\u2019t slow and rather fast. In the beginning he had thought that the other had gotten some kind of special opportunity, but now it seemed that he had received Xu family\u2019s secret treasure.\u201cOf course this magical weapon is very strong,\u201d Xu Zi Yan smiled. \u201cThis magical weapon could be used to manipulate different pressures. Cough cough\u2026\u2026speaking of this, big brother needs to apologize to you. I didn\u2019t tell you before because I had thought we would bear the same pressure. Although it was a bit uncomfortable, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to make someone faint. However, Xu family\u2019s rules state that if a child like you want to enter the martial arts training hall, you must bear double the pressure.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Originally he only wanted to make it a small joke, because he always thought that between brothers it was good to laugh together. This was especially true for Xu Zi Rong, a child who might develop to become one with such a gloomy character. Making a lot of jokes might make his personality more cheerful, and that could also be considered as another preventive measure to keep him from walking a crooked path.Of course, the idea was good, but the results were contrary to his expectations. Although Xu Zi Rong did manage to walk up the mountain, just remembering how he had just been holding that weak and sweat-covered body made Xu Zi Yan be in a bad mood.=\u76bf=My little brother is this cute, this well-behaved, how could that guy Xu Mo be so heartless to set down such a heavy hand?! Did he not understand the idea of being flexible??!!Hearing that, Xu Zi Rong smiled slightly. \u201cBig brother doesn\u2019t have to apologize. Didn\u2019t I get here?\u201d\u201cMm, as expected, Zi Rong is very strong! Other children have to be ten before they can enter the martial arts training hall, yet our Zi Rong is only eight and got in!\u201d Xu Zi Yan rubbed Xu Zi Rong\u2019s head in praise, not being the least stingy with his compliments.An eight year old child who could bear the burden that a ten year old child would bore. In addition, he was someone who successfully entered the martial arts training hall. Even if Xu Zi Rong\u2019s talent was quite average, with his temperament, his future developments were for sure limitless!Of course, according to his past memories and the contents of that book, Xu Zi Yan knew that in the future Xu Zi Rong was definitely not a person without talent. However, he believed that even without that damned Blood Sea Heart Sutra, his precious little brother would still succeed in life!In addition, if he didn\u2019t practice whatever that Blood Sea Heart Sutra was, Xu Zi Rong\u2019s essence blood wouldn\u2019t be capable of attracting the mother bug of the blood-sucking insects. Even if the blood-sucking insect catastrophe happened in the future, it wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with Xu Zi Rong.Xu Zi Yan wasn\u2019t some kind of saviour or Holy Father himself. Although he felt a bit sorry, this kind of thing where one uses the essence blood to attract the mother bug, let\u2019s give that job to those upright and moral people ah\u2014\u2014for example, that Bai Hua.He must never start any kind of connection with that\u2014\u2014cough cough, bitch. \u2192.\u2192Although a review like this of Bai Hua sounded a bit ugly, these were truly the real thoughts of Xu Zi Yan. What other people thought he wouldn\u2019t know, but in any case he didn\u2019t want to have any contact with that person.After being praised by Xu Zi Yan for a while, Xu Zi Rong began to blush a bit. He embarrassedly grabbed his head and revealed a shy expression. However, his heart was pondering how the secrets of this Xu family seemed to be more than the ones he had known in his past life. It seemed like he was going to stay there for a bit longer.After all, other than finding out the other secrets, his heart was somewhat curious about the Xu Zi Yan in front of him.Xu Zi Rong really wanted to know if this Xu Zi Yan who kept giving him pampering looks could truly continue his ways.After ordering the doctor to take good care of Xu Zi Rong, Xu Zi Yan left.Because today was the first day Xu Zi Rong made it to the peak, there was no need for him to take part of today\u2019s training.But that didn\u2019t apply to Xu Zi Yan. Although the original could use various excuses to escape training, Xu Zi Yan didn\u2019t dare to do that. Right now he had only inherited the original\u2019s memories, so he could cast his spells and scare people. But if Xu Zi Yan really had to fight someone, he would only be suitable to get beaten up.The strength of the original Xu Zi Yan was the strongest compared to the other children around his age. If he did not want his own power to weaken, then his everyday training could not be skipped.After all, there were a lot of things that looked like something when you were just looking at it, but was vastly different from that \u2018something\u2019 when you were actually doing it.He did not know if it was because the original Xu Zi Yan had severely offended that yellow-faced beefy man, but in today\u2019s training, that guy practically stared at Xu Zi Yan without stopping. He stared at Xu Zi Yan\u2019s face of guilt, and Xu Zi Yan almost thought he had somehow exposed himself.In reality, Xu Mo was just feeling very confused. The Young Master who had always looked down on the training of the martial arts training hall, why did he remember to come and train with them?With his talent as a reason, Xu family had a lot of expectations for Xu Zi Yan. However, the original was very disgusted with this tedious and dry-as-dust training, so he would almost never appear. After Xu Xiao realized that even without this training Xu Zi Yan\u2019s cultivation remained the same, he no longer cared about it.Xu Mo stared at Xu Zi Yan with a face full of curiosity. He really wanted to know how long this whim of the Young Master would last. However, after watching the other practice those fundamental skills over and over again, Xu Mo really felt his opinion of Young Master Zi Yan change.Every move and every form was done extremely precisely. His posture was correct and he did not let it slip to try and evade work. Looking at Xu Zi Yan\u2019s figure, it was as if the other was carefully doing this dull training for the first time.After staring at him for a long time, Xu Mo finally moved his gaze away. After that, the whole martial arts training hall resonated with his ruthless voice.\u201cXu Zi Xing, what are you doing perking your ass in the air like that? Are you looking for a kick?\u201d A teen quickly retracted his hip.\u201cXu Zi Lan, straighten your chest and take back your stomach. That stomach of yours is going to fall onto the ground.\u201d A chubby teenager sucked in a deep breath, his small stomach disappearing.\u201cXu Zi Ruo, if those hairclips on your head keep falling, I\u2019ll cut off all your hair!\u201d A delicate and pretty teenage girl bit her lower lip before taking off all the hairclips on her head.Like this, the only thing that could be heard on the field was the roar of Xu Mo and the rough breathing of the tired children.Xu Zi Yan didn\u2019t receive any criticism from Xu Mo, but that was because his posture was the standard one without any mistakes. Xu Mo did not like Xu Zi Yan but he would not needlessly find faults in him without reason. Thus, he kept maintaining a disregarding attitude around him.On the martial arts training field, approximately a hundred teens had brows beaded with sweat as they practiced the most tiring basic training. In the small wooden hut beside the martial arts training field, a delicate youngster stared at all those people, the corner of his mouth curving in a sneer.So many\u2026\u2026familiar people\u2026\u2026The corner of Xu Zi Rong\u2019s mouth tilted up in an unnoticeable degree. The people on the martial arts training field were the ones he knew from his memory. Unfortunately, none of those memories were good ones. This made him, when he saw those familiar people, have the desire to kill!\u201cDon\u2019t feel annoyed. Wait until tomorrow and you could also join them. Don\u2019t look at how scary Xu Mo is when he\u2019s yelling, in reality he\u2019s doing it for your own good.\u201d A soft and kind voice spoke up behind Xu Zi Rong.Xu Zi Rong chuckled coldly and retracted the expression on his face. Turning around, he started smiling sweetly. \u201cThank you Doctor Liu.\u201dDoctor Liu was a famous doctor who looked rather elegant. Although he was only around twenty years old, his abilities were superior to others. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been invited home by the Xu family specifically to look after these children.In reality, for a practicing cultivator, the best way to heal was of course taking pellet medicine. But pellet medicine was rather expensive, and using it to treat some small injuries was really a waste. Therefore, Doctor Liu was specifically assigned there, to heal the injuries of Xu family\u2019s children.He did not know who Xu Zi Rong was, and only saw a delicate and cute child looking out of the window. He naturally thought that the child was envious of the disciples outside, and thus he couldn\u2019t help but say a few words.Xu Zi Rong didn\u2019t hold any grudges against this Doctor Liu. Doctor Liu was very kind, and in his last life he had helped him heal his injury. It was a shame that Doctor Liu was not a cultivator and his manner of speaking was gentle. His persuasion not only did not work, but it also angered Xu Zi Yan and made the other chase Doctor Liu away.Doctor Liu saw how cute and obedient Xu Zi Rong was and could not help but smile lightly. Nobody knew where he actually found some pieces of candy, before the other stuffed them into Xu Zi Rong\u2019s hands.Looking at the pieces of candy in his left palm, Xu Zi Rong\u2019s eyes revealed some rare hints of warmth. Although these pieces of candy were really cheap and the make was also very poor, Xu Zi Rong did not feel any dislike and only quietly twisted out a piece before plopping it into his mouth.5f157853cf57993df779d5e1254147a9-globe-watch-asian-artAKA ancient Chinese cotton candy.A sweet taste burst into his mouth but Zu Xi Rong unconsciously frowned. After he became a blood devil, all of his clothes, food, and housing were top-notch. To him, such cheap candy was really a novel experience.Silently swallowing that piece of candy, Xu Zi Rong felt a bit frustrated and disappointed. He vaguely remembered that as a child, getting a piece of candy like that would make him extremely happy. But as he ate the same thing as before, it already lost the taste from his childhood.Xu Zi Rong mocked himself in his heart. Sure enough, anyone was greedy. After passing his days with better food, the things from before could no longer satisfy him.In spite of that, Xu Zi Rong still carefully wrapped up the remaining pieces of candy. This had nothing to do with the taste, and was purely because it was a cherished memory from the past.Seeing how Xu Zi Rong did not like to talk much, Doctor Liu found a medicinal book and gave it to him. Upon receiving the other\u2019s surprised expression, however, Doctor Liu couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit embarrassed. Originally, he only wanted to find something to let Xu Zi Rong pass the time, but he had forgotten. How could an eight year old child like to read such a boring medicinal book?Just when he was about to retrieve the medicinal book, he did not expect Xu Zi Rong to take the initiative and take it. He even smiled at him and said, \u201cThank you Doctor Liu, it\u2019s perfect since I have nothing to do.\u201dDoctor Liu immediately felt that this child was incomparably well-behaved. Sympathetically rubbing his head, he turned around to study the various herbs.Watching Doctor Liu leave, Xu Zi Rong returned to an expressionless face. A medicinal book Doctor Liu uses was naturally just an ordinary kind of goods, and for Xu Zi Rong\u2019s cultivation, the things inside this medicinal book would have absolutely no effect on him. The reason he took the medicinal book earlier was so that he would not let Doctor Liu feel embarrassed. There was no way he would actually spend effort to read it.Since he had the time, it would be more beneficial for him to cultivate. The time before he would break through into the first layer of Qi Condensation Stage was very near.The morning training quickly passed. The moment Xu Zi Yan was done, he ran over to the room Xu Zi Rong was in.\u201cBig brother,\u201d The white and delicate hands of a young child held a book as he read it with concentration. Seeing Xu Zi Yan walk in, he revealed a sweet smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you still feel uncomfortable anywhere?\u201d Xu ZiYan found a chair and sat down beside the bed.Xu ZiRong shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m fine now.\u201d After he finished speaking he got up and jumped off the bed.\u201cThat\u2019s good. Later big brother will bring ZiRong to pick out a low level martial arts book, alright?\u201d Seeing Xu ZiRong\u2019s liveliness, Xu ZiYan began to smoothly tidy up the bed. Folding the blankets three times, he finished with a tofu block.Because of how soft the blankets were, his tofu block didn\u2019t look like a standard one. But looking at the skill of his own technique, Xu ZiYan still nodded in satisfaction: even if he transmigrated into a book, even if he had retired from doing this years ago, his ability to fold blankets was still perfect!huge-1-7653Xu ZiRong\u2019s pupils slightly shrank as he watched Xu ZiYan\u2019s actions. As far as he knew, Xu ZiYan was Xu family\u2019s important Young Master. Although he wasn\u2019t that bad off and didn\u2019t live like a parasite, him doing such a thing like folding blankets was still very inconceivable.And also, looking at Xu ZiYan\u2019s behaviour, he was obviously very experienced as if he had been practicing this for a long time. Xu ZiRong could not help but note down this doubtful point in his heart.After he folded the blankets, Xu ZiYan brought Xu ZiRong to Xu Mo.The children of Xu family who came to the martial arts training hall for the first time could all choose a martial arts book of their choice. The Xu ZiRong who had successfully gotten to the top was of course not an exception.Xu Mo did not deliberately embarrass them at this point. He brought the two of them off the mountain and into the library.Their library was not built inside of Xu family\u2019s main house, and was rather in a very remote corner. If you looked at it from afar, it looked extremely awkward as there was a three-storey building in the middle of nowhere.It was quite strange. If outsiders entered the Xu family grounds, they would definitely be surprised that they would put their library filled with martial art books in a place that was very inconvenient to defend.But Xu ZiYan knew that the real goods Xu family owned were simply not located there. All the things here were the ordinary things you could find from the mainland and even then the defense here wasn\u2019t as weak as it looked.Who did not know that the old man who guarded the doors was actually a genuine Core Formation cultivator?The real truth of Xu family was never what it seemed to be on the surface\u2026\u2026Xu ZiYan was deeply moved by the long-term foresight from the Xu family ancestors. But for him right now, this didn\u2019t have much to do with him. Although he long knew from the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories where the secret treasure room of Xu family was, right now Xu family had not been wiped out. Unless he was stupid, he wouldn\u2019t go and dig up other people\u2019s ancestral graves.Oh, that wasn\u2019t correct, now those were his own ancestral graves\u2026\u2026A bunch of stupid and random thoughts sprouted in Xu ZiYan\u2019s mind as Xu ZiRong stuck close behind him. But although Xu ZiRong looked calm on the surface, his body and nerves were already stretched to their limits.Xu family\u2019s library of martial art books, of course Xu ZiRong knew about them. Back when he had wiped out the family, it was the old man that guarded the library who gave him a great deal of injuries.If it wasn\u2019t how the Blood Sea Heart Sutra had the ability to bypass ranks, perhaps the one who would be wiped out was him.His lips pursing together tightly, for once Xu ZiRong felt a bit nervous. He finally got this opportunity to start over again, so he didn\u2019t want to experience any kind of accidents!Once they got to the front of the library, Xu Mo bowed toward the elderly man who was dozing in front of the door. \u201cOld Luo.\u201dThe old man who looked dead asleep opened his eyes fuzzily. When he saw Xu Mo, he squeezed his lips into a smile, \u201cLittle Mo ah, is there anything wrong?\u201dXu Mo respectively answered: \u201cToday there is a new disciple who entered the martial arts training hall. We came here to help him pick out a martial arts book.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Old Lao nodded his head as his gaze fell onto Xu ZiRong\u2019s body. \u201cNot bad, you\u2019re only eight and you got to the martial arts training hall. Go in, ah.\u201dOnce he finished talking, he waved his sleeves and the grand door of the library opened, a cloud of dust appearing at the entrance\u2026\u2026\u201cCough cough\u2026\u2026I\u2019ve grown old, my bones aren\u2019t what it used to be, so it has been a while since I cleaned.\u201d Old Luo looked a bit embarrassed. His sleeves waved around again and the dust on the ground all blew away.Xu Mo\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t change as he stayed silent. Old Luo was Xu family\u2019s high-ranked guest. If he could become their guest, his strength was certainly not weak. How could a little cultivator who only cultivated to the ninth layer of Qi Condensation stage dare mock a guest? He naturally closed his mouth.Xu ZiRong looked at the opening door of the library. Although his heart felt dull, he revealed an interested expression on his face. After all, an eight year old child who found out he could cultivate, would for sure be extremely happy.But for him who had practiced the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, his pickiness with different martial arts has increased to a certain extent. He didn\u2019t think that the the insignificant library of Xu family had any good things. You have to know, even if Xu family possessed a top-notch martial arts book, it was unlikely they would put it here.\u201cHaha, little child, what is your name ah?\u201d Old Luo was already a ninety years elder, and his eyesight was naturally very extraordinary. Although Xu ZiRong had been trying his best to display his excitement, the dullness hidden in his eyes were still picked up by Old Luo.\u201cMy name is Xu ZiRong,\u201d Xu ZiRong replied softly. Although he lived some years in his last life, compared to this Old Luo, he couldn\u2019t say anything against being called a small child.\u201cOh, so you\u2019re called ZiRong ah,\u201d Old Luo amiably smiled. \u201cWhy are you so nervous? Are you very afraid of me?\u201dXu ZiYan and Xu Mo both stared at Xu ZiRong in surprise, but Xu ZiRong could only put on a very sincere look. \u201cN\u2026\u2026.No.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u2026\u201d Old Luo smiled heartily. \u201cIf you\u2019re not afraid, then why are you so stiff?\u201dXu ZiRong lightly bit his lower lip. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u2026it seems like Grandfather Luo is very strong.\u201dXu ZiYan did not think Xu ZiRong was so sensitive. He was obviously a child who had not yet started cultivating, but he still managed to detect the real strength of Old Luo.You have to know, if he did not have the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories, he totally would not have thought that that this very normal-looking old man would be a Core Formation cultivator.\u201cOh?\u201d Old Luo was also very surprised. \u201cYou think grandfather is very strong?\u201dXu ZiRong lightly nodded his head.\u201cHow strong?\u201d Old Luo humoured him with interest.Xu ZiRong hesitated a bit. \u201cIt seems like\u2026\u2026you\u2019re stronger than Father.\u201dThis time, Old Luo was really surprised. He knew Xu ZiRong\u2019s identity, so the child\u2019s act of comparing him to Xu Xiao wasn\u2019t something strange. What made him bewildered was, how exactly did this child deduce he was stronger than Xu Xiao?Xu ZiYan\u2019s face was calm, because he had long known that this old man was a Core Formation cultivator. However, the shock Xu Mo received in his heart became clearly written all over his face.The strength of Xu Xiao wasn\u2019t a secret in Xu family. But he would never have thought that this guest Old Luo would actually be stronger than Xu Xiao!Didn\u2019t that signify\u2026\u2026When he thought there, Xu Mo\u2019s heart began to flare up. If he managed to get pointers from a Core Formation cultivator, perhaps he would be able to enter the ranks of a Foundation Building cultivator. The advice didn\u2019t have to be much, even a tiny bit may help.\u201cHaha, ZiRong\u2019s feelings are very sensitive, ah,\u201d Old Luo laughed very happily. \u201cGo ahead ah. Although most things in the library are quite common, there are still a few good things. Go and try looking, perhaps your luck will be good enough and you would find them.\u201d\u201cMany thanks for Grandfather Luo\u2019s advice,\u201d Xu ZiRong respectively replied. He still didn\u2019t believe that Xu family\u2019s library would have any martial arts better than the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, but since Old Luo said something like that, he didn\u2019t mind spending more time to take a thorough look.The martial arts Xu ZiYan was currently practicing was the Lightning Heavenly Spiritual Vein Entry Level Arts. It was something his father Xu Xiao had specially brought back from Liu Guang Sect. This martial arts book was only an ordinary good in the Liu Guang Sect, but in Xu family it was already an extremely good thing.At the very least, Xu family didn\u2019t have any martial arts suitable for Xu ZiYan to learn. Though this Lightning Heavenly Spiritual Vein Entry Level Arts wasn\u2019t very powerful, using it to build his foundations was already very good.Xu ZiYan wasn\u2019t qualified to enter the library, but there wasn\u2019t any harm in pulling Xu ZiRong to the side and giving him a detailed explanation of the library\u2019s structure.In any case, all of these things were in Xu ZiYan\u2019s mind. If he introduced the place thoroughly enough, then it would save Xu ZiRong quite some time when he went to pick something. After all, Xu ZiYan absolutely didn\u2019t mind giving Xu ZiRong special treatment. \u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256dAfter listening to Xu ZiYan\u2019s explanation, Xu ZiRong basically knew the structure of the library like the back of his hand. He quietly thanked Xu ZiYan and simultaneously gained a hard noogie before he turned around and entered the library.There were three floors to the library. According to the different cultivation levels, you could choose a different floor.But right now Xu ZiRong only just came in contact with cultivating, so he could only choose a book from the first floor.0fa3492fb035e865c9d383af79c33fdcOld Chinese \u2018books\u2019 were more like bamboo scrolls.The books on the shelves in the first floor were basically all books with the most basic of techniques. Mysterious Water Art, Fire Shield Art, and so on. Xu ZiRong only casually glanced at them before recovering his gaze.These kind of goods, he felt that even looking at them once was wasting his time. Don\u2019t even mention trying to thoroughly look through them.He casually slid his finger across the bindings of all those books, one after another. Xu ZiRong originally had no intentions of choosing anything when his finger touched a darker book and caused a slight reaction.His fingertips tingled with some pain. Surprised, Xu ZiRong took a look at that book.Dark and dull, the top was covered with a thick layer of dust. The introduction on the front cover said it was a type of Wood Element Supporting Arts, but the feeling this book gave Xu ZiRong was definitely not the gentleness of Wood Element techniques.He gently took down the book and brushed off the dust on the top. While his fingers touched the book, there was again that slight feeling of pain.Full of interest, Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyebrow quirked up. It was rare for Xu ZiRong to feel some fascination, and even with his Blood Devil\u2019s eyesight he still couldn\u2019t see the origin of this book. That alone was already enough to evoke his interest.He tried probing the book with a thread of his soul but he would never have expected that the moment he entered the book, his subtle soul thread was crushed into dust. Xu ZiRong\u2019s face immediately paled to a white.\u201cSuch violent power,\u201d he stared at the book in his hands with a grave expression. What was hidden in this book was an extremely violent lightning element power. Unless it was a genius with the Lightning Heavenly Spiritual Vein, anyone else who tried to entering the book with their soul would end up with their soul being crushed into smithereens.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEyebrows frowning gently, Xu ZiRong knew that the best owner for this martial arts book was naturally Xu ZiYan. However, to increase his enemies\u2019 strength, that was something the Blood Devil Lord would never do.Although the current Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t reveal any hostility towards him, Xu ZiRong still didn\u2019t intend to take the initiative and tell the other of this matter.Actually, he had the heart to take this jade book with him, but unfortunately the old man outside wasn\u2019t an opponent he could oppose right now. If he took this thing out, it would inevitably be found by other people.After all, the books in the library couldn\u2019t be actually taken away. For the so-called picking a martial arts book event, it was only picking a book from there before getting the old librarian to copy the contents of the book into another empty scroll.Thus, Xu ZiRong casually took a Wood Element martial arts book and walked out. In any case, these things only served the purpose of being a disguise for him. With his Blood Sea Heart Sutra, any other martial arts techniques were trash in his eyes.\u201cFinished picking?\u201d When Xu ZiYan saw Xu ZiRong leave the library, he couldn\u2019t help but open his mouth to ask.Xu ZiRong nodded with a smile, and then handed the book in his hands to Old Luo.Old Luo gave the book a glance before his eyebrows slightly rose. \u201cAre you sure you want this?\u201dXu ZiYan heard those words and curiously took a look. When he saw the words \u2018Silent Running Rain\u2019 engraved on the book, he suddenly frowned.\u201cZiRong, this Silent Running Rain is a supporting arts, right? Are you certain you wish to choose this?\u201d Xu ZiYan asked quietly.\u201cBig brother\u2026\u2026is there a problem with it?\u201d Xu ZiRong asked with a face full of confusion.Xu ZiYan thought for a moment before he dragged the other to the side. Then, he started to earnestly speak: \u201cZiRong, if it was someone else I wouldn\u2019t have said anything. But you have to know, the martial arts book you selected isn\u2019t good for combat. In the future, if you have to fight with others you will suffer.\u201d\u201cYou just came in contact with cultivating so you might not understand everything yet. Once you embarked on the road to cultivating, the thing that you will never have a shortage of is fighting. You have to fight for good martial arts techniques, you have to fight for precious treasures. Although you can learn other martial arts techniques in the future, the first technique you choose will set the tone for your future developments. I know that perhaps you don\u2019t like to fight but as long as you walk this road, no one can choose not to.\u201dHearing that, Xu ZiRong felt his heart stir. He never thought that this Xu ZiYan would actually tell him something like that.He long knew all the points Xu ZiYan had told him. After all, the first martial arts technique he came in contact with in his last life was the Blood Sea Heart Sutra.Blood Sea Heart Sutra used blood as a medium to raise his cultivation. The more blood he had, the higher his cultivation became and the stronger he was.It could be said that this method of cultivating would only be successful if you trampled over countless corpses. Although in the beginning he only used beasts to increase his cultivation, the more his cultivation increased the heavier his desire to kill became.229603102Silent Running Rain was an extremely gentle type of Wood Element Supporting Arts. In general, all the people who used this technique to cultivate had a very calm personality.In reality, according to Xu ZiRong\u2019s nature he definitely wouldn\u2019t like something like this. However, he was worried that if he learned some aggressive types of martial arts techniques, then his aura of killing intent and his desire to kill could no longer be suppressed.His decision to choose a Wood Element Arts technique was because he had no other choice, but he did not think that Xu ZiYan would explain things to him in such a detailed manner.If Xu ZiYan really wanted to be two-faced and play the game of praising him yet putting him at a disadvantage, he should not have reminded Xu ZiRong of all these points. However, the other party had said everything so unexpectedly, this only made it even more impossible for Xu ZiRong to see through him.But no matter how he couldn\u2019t see through Xu ZiYan, choosing the Wood Element Arts was still absolutely necessary. Xu ZiRong could only lower his head as he used his toe to draw circles in the ground. \u201cBig brother\u2026\u2026fighting and killing\u2026\u2026.I don\u2019t like it.\u201dHearing that, Xu ZiYan frowned slightly before his face quickly reverted back to normal.Forget it, he was just thinking too much. The Xu ZiRong of today was only an eight years old child. He had never experienced the bullying and teasing he did in his past life, so naturally he wouldn\u2019t be that eager to become powerful. If he didn\u2019t learn the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, Xu ZiRong also lost a lot of events where he had to fight. With things like that, Xu ZiYan just had to work a bit harder with his godly talent. Then, protecting Xu ZiRong wouldn\u2019t be that big of a problem.Xu ZiYan had read that novel another time and noted down any parts that had anything to do with Xu ZiRong. Coupled with the memory of his host body, there was a great chance of helping Xu ZiRong escape all those crises.Thus, he gently rubbed Xu ZiRong\u2019s head. \u201cAlright then, ZiRong doesn\u2019t like fighting and killing. If that\u2019s the case, you can rely on big brother to protect you in the future. Okay?\u201dXu ZiRong raised his head. The gaze he was using to look at Xu ZiYan was very deep. This was the second time Xu ZiYan swore to always protect him. He just didn\u2019t know, to what extent this protection would be?Being stared at with that gaze, Xu ZiYan\u2019s heart felt indescribably startled. However, when he observed the other carefully, the eyes of Xu ZiRong only had a touch of soft admiration.\u201cBig brother has to always protect me ah,\u201d Xu ZiRong laughed very happily. He was smiling so much his two pretty eyes had practically become moon crescents.Xu ZiYan patted his own chest. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no problem with that! In the future ZiRong just has to always follow big brother, and big brother will for sure protect you!\u201dThe smile on Xu ZiRong\u2019s face became even more brilliant. \u201cThen okay, in the future I\u2019ll specially use the Wood Element Supporting Arts to support big brother!\u201dXu ZiYan couldn\u2019t help but laugh at that. After laughing however, he began to worry about how he needed to work harder in the future. Otherwise, if Xu ZiRong was more powerful than his big brother in the future, then he was afraid that he would have lost all his dignity.After the martial arts book was copied, Xu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong followed Xu Mo back to the martial arts training hall.In the afternoon, Xu ZiYan once again started practicing the basics while Xu ZiRong was placed into a corner as he tried to \u2018feel the spiritual energy\u2019.The first step of cultivation was letting the spiritual energy enter his body. Xu ZiRong had long completed this step during that day when he had been infuriated. But he could not practice the Blood Sea Heart Sutra here, so with nothing better to do, he could only start learning that Silent Running Rain martial arts technique.Silent Running Rain was one of the most basic techniques of Wood Element Supporting Arts. He could create a thread as thin as rain to nourish an injured place, achieving the same effects as medical treatment. At the same time this kind of spiritual energy had a strong affinity with plants. If you were to use it to command different types of plants to do your bidding, then that would be the method of attacking for Wood Element users.The special characteristics of the Blood Sea Heart Sutra was that it completely ignored the spiritual vein of the cultivator. No matter what kind of spiritual vein you had, you could all cultivate using the Blood Sea Heart Sutra.In his last life Xu ZiRong never had any contact with other types of martial arts techniques. So while this Silent Running Rain was very simple, he was surprised to find that it was extremely useful.In the very least, he could now heal himself when he was injured. Moreover, now that he had the Wood Element Supporting Arts name hanging over his head, even if he were to secretly do things in the future it would be easy to get rid of the suspicion of others.Borrowing the Silent Running Rain\u2019s cover, Xu ZiRong circulated his spiritual energy as a light green light appeared near his fingertips.06db21bf537d216a9c2e81ae59cf30ae4d4f0044_hq\u201cWow! Zi Rong is so amazing!\u201d Xu ZiYan said in surprise. He had walked over just in time to see that green light near Xu ZiRong\u2019s fingers.Xu ZiYan had the godly talent of the Lightning Heavenly Spiritual Vein, and even he used about three days before he finally started feeling spiritual energy. Unexpectedly, Xu ZiRong only used an afternoon before he succeeded, showing just how high his comprehension skills were.Xu ZiYan\u2019s cry was successful in attracting Xu Mo\u2019s attention. When he realized Xu ZiRong only used an afternoon to feel spiritual energy, he was also extremely shocked.There were two ways to determine if one had a gift in cultivating. One was their innate spiritual vein, the other was their comprehension skills. Out of these two points, people having extraordinary comprehension skills were even rarer than people with amazing spiritual veins.In his point of view, although Xu ZiYan was a bit domineering in personality, both his spiritual vein and comprehension skills were at the level of a genius. But he would never have thought that though this Xu ZiRong who was just brought back had a normal spiritual vein, his comprehension skills were even better than Xu ZiYan\u2019s.Xu ZiYan\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t only heard by Xu Mo. The other girls and boys in the martial arts training hall also noticed it.In addition to Xu Mo\u2019s shocked look, there were many different gazes mixed together. Their eyes already had obvious hostility as they stared at Xu ZiRong.Xu ZiYan was the Master\u2019s son, and both his talent and status were already decided. The children of the branch families could only look up to him.However, Xu ZiRong was different. As a bastard who was found and brought back, his position was already extremely embarrassing. If it wasn\u2019t for Xu ZiYan\u2019s performance today in which nobody could figure out his attitude toward his new brother, Xu ZiRong would never had the opportunity to sit and practice quietly and undisturbed.To nurture the cultivating children, Xu family had to use up a lot of resources. However, the total amount of resources was limited. Therefore, the better your talent, the more resources you would get.Xu ZiYan had always been entirely worthy of getting the biggest share, but Xu ZiRong\u2019s talent appearing now meant that he would seize the resources of other people.Embarking on the cultivating road meant fighting against natural order every step toward immortality, and cultivation basically meant trying to struggle against fate. Between disciples that cultivated, it was a very normal occurrence to see people fighting over precious treasures or martial arts techniques. Xu family also set down a Xu family rule: regarding the children of Xu family, any resources you want to pursue must be achieved by relying on your own strength.Today Xu ZiRong displayed this kind of innate gift for comprehension, so it was almost certain that the family elders would attach significance to him.The hostile eyes in the martial arts training hall were already noticed by both Xu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong, but neither of them felt that they were important.For Xu ZiYan, the strength of these people were really not strong enough for him to worry about. With his current cultivation of the sixth layer of Qi Condensation stage, sweeping up the trash here was no problem for him. In addition, he did not think that the people here had enough guts to challenge his status, so naturally they wouldn\u2019t have enough courage to challenge the Xu ZiRong under his wing.And for Xu ZiRong, the hostility of these children was a complete joke in his eyes. The most formidable part of the Blood Sea Heart Sutra was how it allowed one to skip levels in combat. This martial arts training hall was only the starting point for Xu family cultivators, and among all the disciples, the one with the highest cultivation was Xu ZiYan\u2019s sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage.Give him half a month\u2019s time and as long as there was enough blood, he was completely capable of rushing toward the third layer of Qi Condensation stage in one breath. By then, even including Xu ZiYan, there would be no one here who could be his opponent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIf the other tried to commit a rotten trick against him then that would be even more great. The corner of Xu ZiRong\u2019s mouth tilted upwards in a treacherous manner. Ultimately, the strength of the Blood Sea Heart Sutra also depended on the amount of energy found in the obtained blood. And what could be better than the spiritual energy-rich blood of cultivators?\u201cAlright, today\u2019s training ends here. Tomorrow is a real-combat drill, so everyone should prepare,\u201d Xu Mo spoke loudly.Everyone in the martial arts training hall put away the moves they were practicing and clumped together in twos and threes to chat. However, from their eyes it was possible to tell that most of the topics they were discussing had something to do with Xu ZiRong.In a corner of the martial arts training hall, a youth who looked at least a third like Xu ZiYan unwillingly looked in the direction of Xu ZiRong. \u201cHn. It\u2019s only a bastard, Xu ZiYan has really become stupid. Being that good to a bastard, he\u2019s really lost a lot of his dignity.\u201dHearing that, the man and woman behind him made a disdainful look. That young man arrogantly said, \u201cIt\u2019s probably because the Master doesn\u2019t have many sons. After all, he doesn\u2019t even have a concubine.\u201dThe youth who spoke before frowned. \u201cIt was said before that the woman was someone who was kept outside, so she can\u2019t even be worth as much as a concubine. What kind of goods would a child born from a woman like that be? If his mother didn\u2019t die, he would never have the qualifications to enter Xu family\u2019s doors.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with that?\u201d The girl\u2019s face was one of indifference. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s still a problem of strength. If you had the ability to match the cultivating speed of Xu ZiYan, by then, let\u2019s forget about bringing a bastard to the martial arts training hall. Even if you broke apart the martial arts training hall, your father would probably still protect you.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d The boy\u2019s face became cold. \u201cXu ZiXuan, stop trying to sow dissension. My strength isn\u2019t great, but my father is still a Meridian Condensation Stage cultivator while your father is a Foundation Establishment cultivator. What kind of thing are you considered?\u201dThe girl raised her eyelids, the corner of her mouth curving into a sneer. \u201cXu ZiHuan, why does it matter if your father is a Meridian Condensation Stage cultivator? My talent is better than yours, and my cultivation speed is faster than yours. Today we have the addition of Xu ZiRong, this comprehension genius. Presumably, your share of resources has become smaller yet again.\u201d When she finished talking, she turned around and left.Left behind, the young man from before gloomily stared at her back as he cursed her out. \u201cLowly woman, don\u2019t you only have a dual spiritual vein. What\u2019s so remarkable about that! If Xu ZiYan is wholeheartedly partial towards that Xu ZiRong, won\u2019t your share be reduced as well?\u201dThe youth standing behind him couldn\u2019t help but shrink back his neck. Whether it was this boy or that girl, he couldn\u2019t afford to offend either. He was only a child from a vulnerable branch family. With his status, entering this martial arts training hall meant he needed to help flatter these young men and ladies and do some bootlicking.After Xu Mo announced the end of today\u2019s training session, Xu ZiYan took Xu ZiRong with him and then descended the mountain.The classes of the martial arts training hall were all decided by Xu Mo. Since he said there would be combat tomorrow, then there would for sure be combat.The so-called combat was naturally a real battle, but this fight wouldn\u2019t be between the children. Rather, they were to enter the mountain-back to cultivate.The rear end of the Xu family house was a very expansive forest, and the so-called \u2018mountain-back\u2019 of Xu family was just the most peripheral edge of this woodland.This part of the forest was extremely strange and inside, a variety of different creatures lived there. Within those creatures were some extremely powerful spiritual beasts.Nobody knew why, but this part of the forest was separated into three strange parts by big rivers. In addition, the beasts living in the forest were well-behaved and lived in certain parts of the forest according to their own cultivation levels. They never dared to surpass a single step above their own limits.The parts of the forest that surrounded Xu family only had some Qi Condensation stage spiritual beasts. The closer you got to Xu family, the lower their cultivation levels. As long as they didn\u2019t go too deep into the forest, these children from the martial arts training hall could fully achieve the purpose of having real combat.The area between the second river and the third was populated by spiritual beasts that had cultivation levels from Foundation Establishment stage to Meridian Condensation Stage. And only people with Core Formation cultivation would ever dare enter the other side of the third river.The deeper you went the stronger the spiritual beasts were. It was said that after crossing the second river, a Godly spiritual beast lived in the centre of the forest.Of course, with Xu family\u2019s strength, the furthest they\u2019ve explored was the middle of the two big rivers. Regarding the rumor of a Godly spiritual beast, it was just some easily dismissed hearsay.Xu ZiYan knew that tomorrow\u2019s combat practice wouldn\u2019t be too hard on him. After all, with his cultivation level at the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, as long as they didn\u2019t go in too deep it wouldn\u2019t be any danger to him.Now the only problem was how he was also responsible for protecting Xu ZiRong, this child from a previous woman. Right now he had only just stepped through the threshold of cultivating, and hadn\u2019t even reached the first layer of Qi Condensation Stage. If he entered the forest\u2026\u2026\u201cBig brother\u2026\u2026what are you thinking about?\u201d Xu ZiRong had a face of curiosity.\u201cNothing much,\u201d Xu ZiYan habitually rubbed the other\u2019s head.Although Xu Mo didn\u2019t think Xu ZiYan was pleasing to the eye, he would never take his anger out on Xu ZiRong. In that case, it was certain that he knew that based on Xu ZiRong\u2019s current abilities, going into the forest was simply looking for death. In addition, the first martial arts technique Xu ZiRong picked was a Wood Element Supporting Arts one, so unless someone protected him\u2026..Protection!Both of Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyes brightened.If it was only him, he really did not dare to guarantee that Xu ZiRong wouldn\u2019t receive any injuries. But he had almost forgotten that Xu Mo never said anything about doing tomorrow\u2019s test alone. In other words, Xu ZiYan could find other people and team up with them.It made sense if he thought about it. Based on the cultivation levels of everyone, it would be simply impossible to accomplish the task of cultivating in the forest if people did not work together. Not to mention, other than Xu ZiRong, there were a lot of other Xu family children who studied supporting martial arts.Understanding all of this, Xu ZiYan suddenly felt very determined. Thus, he turned his head and told Xu ZiRong: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to team up with others in tomorrow\u2019s battle. Have a good rest today. Your mission tomorrow would be to properly protect yourself.\u201dXu ZiRong nodded his head. The Blood Sea Heart Sutra was his hidden trump card and naturally couldn\u2019t be revealed here. On the other hand, his Silent Running Rain was something he had just started learning, and it was impossible for him right now to order plants to attack. For any other tasks, it was completely okay to give them to his older brother to complete. Anyway, wasn\u2019t this Xu ZiYan repeatedly saying he\u2019ll protect him? It would be good to evaluate the other\u2019s performance tomorrow.Xu ZiRong\u2019s response was very normal so Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t think much about it. After he returned his younger brother to that pink room that almost blinded him, Xu ZiYan decisively and quickly escaped.Xu ZiRong stared at that room full of pink, before there was a split second where his expression was sinister. Then, he silently scratched down another note in that little book in his heart\u2026\u2026Early next morning, after Xu ZiRong woke up he used the fastest speed possible to wash up before he rushed out of his own room.After he stepped out of his room, he released a big sigh of relief. Xu ZiRong had never thought about it before, but a room that was decorated in all pink actually had such a ruthless destructive power\u2026\u2026Striding toward the neighbouring room, the maid who was guarding the door had already changed. This new maid looked very ordinary, but when she smiled she looked extremely cute. It gave others an unconscious feeling of closeness with her.But Xu ZiRong knew just how treacherous and murderous this woman was. Before he himself was deceived by her appearance and stupidly followed her to the snake valley. The result was naturally being pushed down the cliff by Xu ZiYan.When he came back later, this woman could actually put on an innocent look and wanted to keep deceiving him. Unfortunately for her, although he was quite stupid back then, he wasn\u2019t stupid to that degree. After being dealt a lesson, just once was enough for him to understand.The first time she saw Xu ZiRong, a moment of alarm appeared in this woman\u2019s eyes. However, it was quickly suppressed by her before she gave Xu ZiRong one of her most innocent smiles. She was extremely clear about how, for a newly arrived child, the influence a kind but approachable maid would be.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Xu ZiRong pretended to be puzzled as he asked.\u201cThis servant is called Ruo Shi,\u201d Ruo Shi saluted him.\u201cOh,\u201d Xu Zi Rong nodded casually. \u201cBig brother hasn\u2019t gotten up yet?\u201d\u201cYes Young Master ZiRong. Young Master is still sleeping,\u201d Ruo Shi answered in an honest tone. The gaze she used to look at Xu ZiRong was in a loving manner.\u201cUh\u2026why are you looking at me like that?\u201d Xu ZiRong saw the gaze that had once made him feel warm and suddenly felt displeased. Thus, those words escaped his mouth.Ruo Shi hesitated for a moment before quickly reacting. \u201cPlease forgive me Young Master ZiRong. At home, this servant has a little brother around Young Master ZiRong\u2019s age. This servant only remembered her own brother.\u201dXu ZiRong sneered in his heart. Back then, he was also deceived by this lie. It was only later did he find out that Ruo Shi never had a little brother.\u201cImpudent!\u201d Xu ZiRong\u2019s face sank. \u201cYou actually dared to compare the little brother of a servant to this young master, you are very bold!\u201dRuo Shi froze. It seemed like she had never expected to receive such a scolding from Xu ZiRong.\u201cYoung Master ZiRong\u2026\u2026\u201d She could not help but feel a bit flustered. This was completely different from what she had previously expected!\u201cI am the great second young master of the Xu family, what use would I have for your love?\u201d Xu ZiRong asked in an aggressive manner.\u201cYoung Master ZiRong, this servant doesn\u2019t dare\u2026\u2026\u201d Ruo Shi was completely terrified. With a thump, she knelt onto the ground as her whole body shivered.Now, who in the Liu Shang Court didn\u2019t know how much the Young Master loved this second Young Master? If Ruo Shi angered him, it was certain she wouldn\u2019t have a good end.\u201cHmph!\u201d Xu ZiRong coldly snorted before he turned around and pushed open the door to enter Xu ZiYan\u2019s room. He left behind Ruo Shi who knelt beside the door and trembled, scared to the point she didn\u2019t even dare raise her head.The situation inside the bedroom was the same as what Xu ZiRong had guessed\u2026\u2026A giant blanket roll was on the surface of the bed. From head to toe, Xu ZiYan was completely wrapped up in it. In fact, there was only a single corner that exposed a few strands of black hair that helped people determine his position. Otherwise, with such a big and round package, trying to find the position of his head would also be a problem\u2026\u2026\u201cBig brother, it\u2019s time to get up!\u201d Xu ZiRong had a face full of gentle smiles as he reached over to shake Xu ZiYan\u2019s shoulders.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026let me sleep for a bit more\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu ZiYan dazedly replied as he squirmed a bit in his blankets.Upon seeing this, Xu ZiRong couldn\u2019t help but raise his eyebrow.

There was only one person in the younger generation of Xu family who was called ZiYu, and he was someone from a very small branch of the family. In addition, that ZiYu was already twenty years old, thus it was impossible for him to call Xu ZiYan \u2018big brother\u2019.Silently recording yet another doubt in his heart, Xu ZiRong persisted in pushing that big rolled-up blanket. \u201cBig brother, if you don\u2019t get up now we\u2019ll really be late! You don\u2019t want me to be late for my first cultivation practical day right?\u201d1083c8fb96f64ab4d68b463629c4c424-anime-hot-anime-guys\u201cAh\u2026\u2026right\u2026\u2026ZiYu can\u2019t be late for school!\u201d Xu ZiYan suddenly opened his blankets and sat up, his face still looking dazed. It seemed as if he had not woken up yet, and his full head of black hair was messy to the point it looked like a chicken\u2019s nest.Xu ZiRong once again silently noted down the word \u2018school\u2019.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026so it was ZiRong ah,\u201d Xu ZiYan was finally awaken from his daze. Seeing Xu ZiRong\u2019s sudden wide eyes, he climbed out of bed with not a little amount of embarrassment.He clearly said that he was going to take good care of this little brother, but in the end he had to be dragged out of bed by the same little brother every morning. It was too shameful\u2026\u2026_(:\u0437\u300d\u2220)_Yawning, Xu ZiYan picked up the clothes by his bedside and dressed himself. Beside him, Xu ZiRong was in the middle of attaching heavy importance to the word \u2018ZiYu\u2019.He believed that if he was able to find the owner of the name \u2018ZiYu\u2019, then perhaps he would be able to find the ultimate reason as to why Xu ZiYan had changed so much.Xu ZiYan\u2019s actions were nimble and neat. He didn\u2019t use much time before he had already cleaned himself all up.Ruo Shi hadn\u2019t dared to get up and was still kneeling at the door when the two people walked out of the room. However, the moment she saw Xu ZiYan she lightly bit her lower lip before revealing a wronged expression on her face.When he saw Ruo Shi kneeling at his door, Xu ZiYan hesitated for a moment. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d He remembered that this Ruo Shi was quite quick-witted, so how did she end up like this?\u201cYoung Master\u2026\u2026it\u2019s all this servant\u2019s fault. I\u2019ve displeased Young Master ZiRong,\u201d Ruo Shi quickly explained.The corner of Xu ZiRong\u2019s mouth tilted up in an undetectable curve. He really wanted to see how Xu ZiYan would handle this matter.\u201cDispleased ZiRong?\u201d Xu ZiYan was a bit startled. To him, the Xu ZiRong who had recently arrived at the Xu family was just a sensitive child who craved care from others. Let\u2019s not even talk about how lovable he was, it was rare for him to even be angry. It was hard for Xu ZiYan to imagine just what kind of things Ruo Shi had said that were actually capable of making Xu ZiRong angry.Lightly glancing at Ruo Shi, he spoke, \u201cIf it\u2019s like that, then go and tell the butler that from today onwards, you have been transferred out of Liu Shang Court.\u201dRuo Shi\u2019s eyes widened in a disbelieving manner as she stared at Xu ZiYan.The reason she had taken the initiative before to talk was to display how she had no intentions of complaining. However, she did not expect that the Young Master wouldn\u2019t even ask for an explanation before transferring her out of Liu Shang Court. After Ruo Qi was transferred her position took a devastating dive and she could now barely work in the laundry room. If Ruo Shi was also transferred\u2026\u2026When she thought of that, Ruo Shi\u2019s face suddenly paled white. Her body swayed and she almost fainted.Xu ZiRong was also stunned. He would have never imagined that Xu ZiYan would simply disregard the details of the situation and instead directly punish Ruo Shi like that.He still remembered how, thanks to her brains, Ruo Shi\u2019s position in Liu Shang Court was only second to Ruo Qi\u2019s. However, Ruo Qi was transferred out, and now even Ruo Shi was driven away from the Liu Shang Court. Toward these two things, the gap between this Xu ZiYan and the previous one was so big they were practically two different people. Xu ZiRong couldn\u2019t help but doubt things.\u201cYoung Master\u2026\u2026\u201d Ruo Shi opened her mouth, still wanting to explain things.But Xu ZiYan completely didn\u2019t have the interest to keep listening to her. The conduct and deeds Ruo Shi committed in the original\u2019s life were things he was very clear about. However, in this life she didn\u2019t do anything yet, so naturally he wasn\u2019t going to target her.But now that she offended Xu ZiRong, no matter if it was intended or unintended, Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t want her to stay in the Liu Shang Court. Drawing on his experience from his last life and so Xu ZiRong wouldn\u2019t grow up bent, he was planning to separate those people who had once bullied Xu ZiRong from the child as much as possible.Of course, in the original\u2019s life the people who had intentionally bullied Xu ZiRong only did it so they could please Xu ZiYan. Now that his attitude toward Xu ZiRong had changed, naturally the attitudes of those people would have changed as well. The rest of the bullies would only be those bastards who think Xu ZiRong was displeasing to their eyes.Cheerfully leaving with Xu ZiRong, Xu ZiYan ignored the shivering Ruo Shi who had collapsed on the ground. In this world where the weak were prey for the strong, it was impossible for him to protect everybody. Thus, he could only focus on the feelings of the people he had taken under his wing.As they walked toward the martial arts training hall, Xu ZiYan imparted as much knowledge he received from the original\u2019s memories as possible to Xu ZiRong. Today\u2019s real-combat drill could also be considered a test for Xu ZiYan as well. After all, even if he used all the memories of the Xu ZiYan, he might not be able to bring out the full extent of the original\u2019s capabilities.Xu ZiRong had a smile on his face as he listened to Xu ZiYan\u2019s earnest teachings the whole way there. However, it was hard for him to explain what he was feeling at the moment.The things Xu ZiYan taught him today were obviously not any use to the him of now. However, if he really was an eight year old child, then the other had really taught him everything he should know.If this was the previous Xu ZiYan and everything he had done so far was an act, then his best opportunity was to borrow this real-combat drill and quietly bury Xu ZiRong inside the forest. After all, with the addition of spiritual beasts anything could happen.But seeing how Xu ZiYan explained all the key points in extreme detail to him with a serious face, no matter what Xu ZiRong couldn\u2019t make himself believe that the other planned to murder him inside the forest.Sighing slightly in his heart, Xu ZiRong felt that he couldn\u2019t see through this Xu ZiYan even more now.\u201cDo you remember everything?\u201d\u201cI remember,\u201d Xu ZiRong nodded in an obedient and clever manner. \u201cI will for sure follow closely behind big brother.\u201d\u201cEn, then that\u2019s good. Later I will look for others so you can be even safer,\u201d Xu ZiYan said as he patted Xu ZiRong\u2019s shoulder.The two people followed the stone step road and very quickly climbed to the top of the mountain. On the plaza of the martial arts training hall, dozens of Xu family children stood in clumps. It seemed that many teams have already been spontaneously made.When Xu ZiYan appeared, most people couldn\u2019t help but looking over. Everyone knew that Xu ZiYan was already at the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. If they could go with him, then that practically represented both safety and less worrying.Xu ZiYan knew he was well-received and popular, but he didn\u2019t want to just casually pick a team.Carefully observing everything and combining that with the memories in his head, he quickly found the three people who stood in a corner.He took Xu ZiRong and walked over before asking a girl who had lowered her head, \u201cCan we join you?\u201dThe girl raised her head and Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyebrow suddenly jumped.large\u201cYou wish to join us?\u201d The young girl\u2019s expression was ice-cold, and the gaze she used to look at Xu ZiYan was thick with scrutinization.Xu ZiYan allowed the other to size him up. He knew that the girl was for sure extremely shocked. After all, his predecessor and this girl were deadly rivals, and no matter what the original would never join her team.But the Xu ZiYan now was different. He was an adult man, and he would never give up on such a good teammate just because of some jealousy between teenagers. In the end, the original reason the previous Xu ZiYan thought this girl was displeasing to the eye was merely because he had always thought he was Xu family\u2019s hope for the future. Thus, he believed that everyone should act as if he was the world\u2019s sun. Yet although this young girl\u2019s strength was a whole level lower than his, she didn\u2019t surround him like the other children and thus he felt extremely uncomfortable around her.Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t have the chuunibyou disease and nor was he a small child, so of course wouldn\u2019t do such stupid things.When you look for teammates, obviously the stronger they were the better it was. The stronger the strength of a team, the safer Xu ZiRong would be.\u201cWhat? Do you not want us?\u201d Xu ZiYan slightly raised his eyebrow, his expression a bit provocative.The young girl\u2019s face sank. \u201cOf course we want you, why wouldn\u2019t we? But\u2026\u2026\u201d Her tone took a turn as she turned to directly face Xu ZiRong. \u201cWe have no need for a child from a previous woman.\u201dXu ZiRong\u2019s face became a bit gloomy. He hated the tone of this young girl.On the other hand, Xu ZiYan\u2019s expression was flat. \u201cEither both of us join the team, or both of us leave to find another one. I believe, with my cultivation at the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, there isn\u2019t a need for me to worry about finding a team.\u201dThe young girl glanced at and sized up Xu ZiRong a few times before she began to discuss with the two boys beside her. Finally, she agreed. \u201cLet\u2019s first agree that you are responsible for protecting him yourself.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d\u201cThe rewards we get from hunting will be split into four parts, and both of you will only get one.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case,\u201d the young girl took a deep breath. \u201cWelcome to the team.\u201dXi ZiYan smiled faintly. He loved dealing with smart people the most. It saved both time and effort.From start to finish, not a single person asked for Xu ZiRong\u2019s opinions. Of course, this was because his strength was too low, and he completely didn\u2019t have the right to express his opinions.Toward this Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t feel that humiliated. After all, one\u2019s cultivation was the reason for another\u2019s respect, and thus it was normal for the other party to believe he was worth nothing right now.Not long afterward, Xu Mo stepped onto the stage in front of the martial arts training hall plaza. Looking down at nearly a hundred Xu family children, he loudly announced: \u201cToday\u2019s real-combat drill is limited to the edge of the forest. The river will be the boundary, and no one is allowed to cross the lake to enter the second area. Each one of you must carry a protective jade pendant on your body. The moment you encounter a spiritual beast that is beyond your abilities, you must crush the jade pendant immediately. There will be teachers who will come and save you, but in that case, any achievements you make today will be invalid. Before today\u2019s sunset, you must bring back a spiritual beast that is equal to your own cultivation level. But even if it is to pass a test, if you capture extra beasts, you can sell them and anything you earn can be counted as an addition to your allowances.\u201dHaving said that, he glanced at the children with rather low cultivation levels before adding, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have enough strength, don\u2019t be stupid and go deep into the forest. There are many low-level spiritual beasts around the edge of the forest. If someone stupid encountered strong enemies and don\u2019t have enough time to crush the jade pendant, then you\u2019ll just be dying in vain.\u201dWith his words sinking into the audience, Xu Mo jumped down from the high stage before walking into a room to start the mechanism.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKa ka ka! These sounds were what accompanied the start of the mechanism. Many metal platforms were suddenly pushed out of the side of the martial arts training hall that was close to the cliff. Each metal platform was only about one person in width, and a rope that was as thick as a person\u2019s finger was hung at each of the edges.All of the young boys and girls suddenly looked at each other. Those who were quick-witted already understood the role behind these things. Their faces all suddenly paled.Xu Mo walked out of that room. When he saw how all of the people were still in the martial arts training hall, he slightly frowned. \u201cWhat are you looking at? Shouldn\u2019t you quickly depart?\u201dOne of the youths swallowed. Scared witless, he asked, \u201cMo-shifu, we have to\u2026\u2026go down from there?\u201dXu Mo\u2019s face sank. \u201cRubbish, did you think I opened the Dragon Rope Loop in order for you to have fun looking at it?\u201dA young girl walked to the edge of the cliff and took a look down. Underneath the jagged rocks, the height was enough to make one dizzy. She suddenly retreated before saying, \u201cMo-shifu, we can just climb down the mountain\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat damn climbing!\u201d Xu Mo abruptly yelled angrily. \u201cYou guys are a group of wastes! It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m asking you to jump down. Do you not know how to slide down using the Dragon Rope Loop? No matter what, all of you are already at least at the third layer of Qi Condensation Stage! You\u2019re still afraid of height like this?\u201dThe young girl lightly bit her lower lip as if she was still unwilling despite Xu Mo\u2019s scolding. But when she saw that height that made people feel dizzy, she couldn\u2019t help but back up a few more steps.\u201cHurry up and don\u2019t waste time. Those who are unwilling to go down from here, don\u2019t come back tomorrow!\u201d Xu Mo roared sternly as all the people in the area quieted down from fear.Other than how they were all children from Xu family, the youths there could go and practice at the martial arts training hall because their talent was considered to be quite good. The number of cultivating disciples reflected the strength of a cultivation family. If they were driven out by Xu Mo, then that was equal to them giving up cultivating in the future. Not only were they unwilling, even their parents won\u2019t let them go.Being able to enter the martial arts training hall was a type of glory, but if they were to be banished from the martial arts training hall then that would be extremely shameful. It was practically the same as being banished from their home.Many people were still hesitant, but some of the ones with more guts were already walking toward those metal platforms.Precisely as what Xu Mo had said, among them, other than the Xu ZiRong who had unexpectedly joined them recently, the lowest cultivation level a disciple had was the third layer of Qi Condensation Stage. Sliding down the cliff with a rope didn\u2019t pose any danger to them. It was just that before, all of their classes consisted of practicing martial art forms in the martial arts training hall. So seeing the height of the cliff for the first time, they couldn\u2019t help but feel scared in their hearts.After the first person went, naturally a second would follow. After seeing three to four teenagers slide down the Dragon Rope Loop without gaining any injuries, the rest of the people began orderly lining up to also slide down.gruta20do20lap23u00e3oXu ZiYan looked at the Dragon Rope Loop before taking a look at Xu ZiRong. He couldn\u2019t help but feel worried. When all was said and done, Xu ZiRong only had a single day\u2019s contact with cultivating (not!). Even his body was not improved by spiritual energy yet. Telling him to use the Dragon Rope Loop now was beyond the other\u2019s abilities, but if he didn\u2019t go down it would again not meet the rules of Xu family.Although Xu ZiRong entered the martial arts training hall halfway through, once he entered there, everyone was treated equally. Under limited conditions Xu ZiYan could give special treatment to Xu ZiRong and even cheat a little for him, but this time, it was impossible for him to allow Xu ZiRong take a detour and climb down the mountain.\u201cZiRong ah, later if you\u2019re scared just hug tighter onto big brother and close your eyes, alright?\u201d Xu ZiYan said in a low tone. Right now he couldn\u2019t think of any other plans so he could only bring ZiRong down himself. Although the weight of two people may be a bit risky, after pondering about it he believed that it wouldn\u2019t be too dangerous.Xu ZiRong nodded his head as he looked at Xu ZiYan. \u201cI know, big brother.\u201d\u201cEn, so obedient. Later you don\u2019t have to think of anything, just hugging your big brother would be enough,\u201d Xu ZiYan took Xu ZiRong\u2019s hand and led him to the side of the metal platform. Now that more than half the people there had already went down, the rest left also slowly inched toward their side under Xu Mo\u2019s gaze.Xu ZiYan took out a rope from his interspatial pouch before he tied himself tightly to Xu ZiRong. For this half-cheating trick he did, Xu Mo also pretended to not see it. After all, Xu ZiRong only arrived a day ago. Letting an eight year old child slide down like that, if there really was some danger then that wouldn\u2019t be too good.Xu ZiRong hugged Xu ZiYan tightly. The body of the teenager exuded a slightly warm feeling. He didn\u2019t know if it was because he cultivated with the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, but Xu ZiRong\u2019s own body temperature was a bit low. Usually, he didn\u2019t think much of it but when he hugged such a big \u2018hot water bottle\u2019, he inexplicably had a feeling of attachment.It was very comfortable and very warm. And though the arm hugging him wasn\u2019t very strong, it still held a sense of firm determination.Xu ZiRong knew that Xu ZiYan would definitely not let him fall down. He himself did not understand why he had an idea like that, but he still believed it!\u201cHold on tightly!\u201d Xu ZiYan said the words in a low voice. Wrapping the Dragon Rope Loop around his wrist, he jumped down the cliff.Xu ZiRong was of course not afraid of height like that, but he still closed his eyes to enjoy that sense of weightlessness as one fell down rapidly.The arm wrapped around his waist held him very tightly. Since he was plastered to Xu ZiYan, he could even hear the other\u2019s heartbeat. Beat, beat. It was strong, powerful and full of vitality\u2026\u2026a sound that captivated people.\u201cAlright, we\u2019re here. Uh\u2026\u2026ZiRong, what are you doing?\u201d Sliding down with the help of the Dragon Rope Loop didn\u2019t take much time. When Xu ZiYan landed, he only felt some tremors because of the weight of two people. It couldn\u2019t even be counted as a small injury.Only\u2026\u2026What was ZiRong doing?naruto-full-444357Xu ZiYan was a bit puzzled. A small child was sprawled on his chest, squinting his eyes as he wore a look full of enjoyment. If this was in the modern times and if Xu ZiRong was a woman, Xu ZiYan might have believed that he had just said some sweet and honeyed words and thus made this woman touched. But in this scene where both characters were completely wrong\u2026\u2026so, in the end what the heck was Xu ZiRong doing?\u201cHave we already came down?\u201d Before he opened his eyes, Xu ZiRong had already organized his feelings. He plastered a look of ignorance and slight surprise onto his face. \u201cSo we\u2019ve already reached the bottom? It was so quick!\u201dUpon seeing that, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t think much about it and only placed down Xu ZiRong. Then he left the place to give enough landing space for the next person.Xu ZiRong felt a bit frustrated. Such a strong and lively heart, if he murdered Xu ZiYan and used his blood to cultivate, he could probably jump straight into the third layer of Qi Condensation Stage in one breath\u2026\u2026Unfortunately, he still had to stay at Xu family. If he didn\u2019t have Xu ZiYan\u2019s protection, then that would really be something quite troublesome.He did not think that \u2018father\u2019 of his would, just because Xu ZiYan died, put his hopes onto Xu ZiRong. Instead, it was more possible that he would have to accompany Xu ZiYan in being buried.Silently retrieving his wanting gaze, Xu ZiRong suppressed the abrupt feeling of violence in his heart. Really\u2026\u2026if he wasn\u2019t careful, this ball of anger would suddenly erupt. Although he had forcibly suppressed it last time, if he didn\u2019t find somewhere to vent it out, perhaps it would unexpectedly burst out of him one day.Nevermind, he could just find an opportunity to vent now. In any case there were numerous spiritual beasts in this forest. As long as he could find some time to slip away from Xu ZiYan, grabbing a low-level spiritual beast or regular beast wasn\u2019t much of a problem.\u201cLet\u2019s go now. We\u2019ll head in that direction,\u201d the young girl and her two male companions had all slid down with the help of the Dragon Rope Loop. When they saw Xu ZiYan waiting for them at a side, they all came over one after another.Because Xu ZiYan had voluntarily joined their team, the young girl was tacitly approved to be the captain of the team.The name of the girl was Xu ZiJing. The two teenagers who followed her were called Xu ZiXue and Xu ZiLuo.Both of these teenagers were the type that didn\u2019t like to talk too much. In fact, including the girl Xu ZiJing, all three of them didn\u2019t like talking. The three of them were born with ordinary talent and spiritual veins, so in terms of strength, in the Xu family they could only be ranked toward the end.No matter how united a family was, there was no lack of comparisons between the other branches of the family. And for the children of the family, these comparisons were even more prominent.Although there were many small groups and cliques in the martial arts training hall, it was as if the three of them drifted away from such groups. Normally, they didn\u2019t mix with any of those clumps of people.Contrary to what one may expect, Xu ZiYan was rather appreciative of their actions. After all, the other children were too young and their foresight did not extend far enough. They could only see the small grounds of Xu family, so they were already trying to pull people toward them when they were this young. However, these three were different. They didn\u2019t take part in the struggle to recruit more followers. Instead, they only devoted everything they had to cultivating. As long as one\u2019s strength was enough, any scheming and fighting like that were rubbish.The group of five quickly walked into the forest. The edges of the forest were prepared for the children that didn\u2019t have much power. Among the five of them, other than Xu ZiRong, the rest were at least at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation Stage and would naturally not waste time there.When they entered the forest, all of them released their spiritual auras. With their strength, spiritual beasts below the fourth layer of Qi Condensation Stage wouldn\u2019t dare come near them.Without any interruptions from the spiritual beasts, their advancement into the forest was very quick. However, the preparation Xu ZiJing did beforehand was still sufficient.Nobody knew where, but she somehow managed to buy a map of the forest surroundings. In addition, she had very accurately circled some areas that had a lot of spiritual beast activity.\u201cShh!\u201d Xu ZiYan\u2019s strength was the strongest and thus he was the most sensitive to his surroundings as well. The footsteps from a far immediately made him raise his guard.The moment he reacted, Xu ZiJing and the other two instantly joined him in an alert state.Once again, Xu ZiYan praised his wise choice of teammates. Teammates like these were the ones you could rely on. If he had banded up with those bootlicking guys, Xu ZiYan was afraid he could only cry now.\u201cWho is it?!\u201d Xu ZiJing shouted loudly.The sound of footsteps suddenly stopped. The trees from a far shook a bit before a boy cutting a sorry figure ran out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why are you here?\u201d Xu ZiJing asked in surprise. It turned out that the person who was hidden in the grass was actually a Xu family child.Xu ZiXing\u2019s cultivation level was only at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, but he had a lot of courage. He was one of the first people who had slid down using the Dragon Rope Loop.With his abilities, being able to get in front of them wasn\u2019t something surprising. What everyone was puzzled about was why he was currently in such a sorry state.Xu ZiXing replied gloomily: \u201cI had a lot of bad luck. The moment I entered the forest I encountered a group of Red Eye Wasps. That resulted in me being chased all the way here. If I hadn\u2019t just found a cluster of Polarized Grass, I still wouldn\u2019t have shaken them off.\u201dRed Eye Wasps was a type of low-level spiritual beasts. Their individual attacks wasn\u2019t strong, but they always appeared in a group. For them, as cultivators who were neither strong nor weak, they were the most annoying. On the other hand, Polarized Grass had a specific kind of scent. For Red Eye Wasps, that scent was extremely unbearable for them, so thus Xu ZiXing was able to escape.He hadn\u2019t even set off yet before he was chased until he was in such a disarray, so Xu ZiXing\u2019s mood was obviously very low. He resentfully bid farewell to Xu ZiYan and them before leaving to find his own team.\u201cDo you have any ideas?\u201d Xu ZiJing turned around to look at Xu ZiYan, her tone still having that hint of flavour.Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyebrow rose slightly. \u201cPolarized Grass is a favourite of Rock Cats. I remember that on the map you had taken out earlier, you\u2019ve written that there has been Rock Cat hauntings around here. Do you wish to try it out?\u201dHaving heard that, Xu ZiJing quietly laughed. Before she had always felt that Xu ZiYan was only a pampered Young Master, who completely did not understand the suffering of ordinary people. Normally she didn\u2019t have much contact with him, but she had heard a lot of rumours. What bossy and domineering, what unruly and uninhibited. From their contact today that didn\u2019t seem to be the case at all.As one of the martial arts training hall\u2019s outstanding disciples, Xu ZiJing actually didn\u2019t lack a competitive attitude. The corners of her lips tilted up slightly as she asked with a hint of provocation: \u201cAre you scared?\u201dThe corners of Xu ZiYan\u2019s lips also hooked up, but he did not respond. He only held Xu ZiRong\u2019s hand before walking in the direction where Xu ZiXing had first appeared.Xu ZiJing turned around to gesture for the two little brothers to follow them. She did not forget to leave a sign under one of the big trees.The place Xu ZiXing had talked about wasn\u2019t far from where they were, and Xu ZiYan saw the huge patch of Polarized Grass not even two hundred meters away. The lush green Polarized Grass looked similar to blades and grew extraordinarily tender. Walking just a bit closer made them able to smell their light fragrance drifting in the air.After observing the edge of the patch, Xu ZiYan very quickly discovered some plum-shaped footprints. If it wasn\u2019t an accident, it ought to be the traces left by Rock Cats.d1c4577ae0a11d3925899629b801c685-glitter-gif-cat-gifRock Cats were fond of feeding on various kinds of rocks, but this Polarized Grass had a special material they needed. Every Rock Cat had to consume a certain amount of Polarized Grass almost every day. In general, as long as it is a place with Polarized Grass, there is never a shortage of Rock Cat silhouettes.This patch of Polarized Grass was extremely dense while the area was very big. In particular, there were many trees and plants that surrounded it. If they only kept to one side, it would be very easy for the Rock Cats to escape.Rock Cats were a type of spiritual beast that was at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, but of all the spiritual beasts that were at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, Rock Cats had the most quickest speed.Among the five of them, Xu ZiXue and Xu ZiLuo were both at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. As long as they could hunt down more than two Rock Cats, their mission could be considered as half-complete.In addition, the fur of the Rock Cats was extremely beautiful. Even if they didn\u2019t hand them in, they could still sell them for quite a profit.The five of them split into four corners and surrounded this patch of Polarized Grass. Unless the Rock Cats who came here could sprout wings and fly away, there wasn\u2019t any chance of them escaping.As his first hunt, Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit nervous. This could be seen as his first encounter with an enemy, so if something unexpected happened\u2026\u2026 =.=No! It won\u2019t happen!Seeing how the Xu ZiRong at his side had a completely worshiping gaze as he stared at him, Xu ZiYan silently pumped his fist. In front of his little brother, a big brother must be invincible, and seem as if he could even support the heavens and the sky!!Inexplicably sensing that Xu ZiYan\u2019s will to fight had ignited, Xu ZiRong could not help but feel puzzled. It was only a few small Rock Cats. Based on Xu ZiYan\u2019s abilities they didn\u2019t pose a single problem, so why did the other\u2019s fighting spirit suddenly started flaming?\u201cIf any spiritual beasts appear later, you definitely can\u2019t make a sound. Do you understand? Today just watching everything is good enough. The reason you\u2019re here is mostly so we can increase your courage,\u201d Xu ZiYan said seriously.Xu ZiRong nodded hard to show he had understood, but his heart felt rather dumbfounded: the lord blood devil needed to rely on hunting Qi Condensation spiritual beasts to increase his courage? This was definitely an insult to him!(A note was silently recorded on that small book\u2026\u2026)Xu ZiYan lay onto the ground gently and increased his sensitivity to the max. Although he wasn\u2019t capable of pushing his spirit out of his body yet, using this method allowed him to become accustomed to using his soul.He clenched his fist before releasing it, and then Xu ZiYan seemingly wiped his hands onto his pants carelessly. The sweat on his hands made him feel a bit uncomfortable, but if he seemed too nervous if front of his little brother he would again feel a bit shamed.Actually, every movement of Xu ZiYan was noted down by Xu ZiRong. To him, this degree of hunting was the same as playing around. Instead of focusing on the prey that would be dead soon, he might as well put his concentration on this \u2018strange\u2019 Xu ZiYan\u2019s body.\u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d Xu ZiYan quietly said, not knowing that Xu ZiRong said the same thing in his heart.Shortly afterwards, a branch not too far away from them shook slightly. After that, a ink-blue cat came out.The Rock Cat was extremely cautious and did not immediately jump down. Instead, it observed its surroundings on its branch for quite some time.Xu ZiYan even lightened his breathing in fear of scaring that Rock Cat. His eyes stared at his target closely, his face looking bizarrely fierce.Seeing that, Xu ZiRong felt a bit surprised. From the time he had first met this Xu ZiYan till now, this person had always gave him a strange feeling of warmth. It was the first time he had seen the other have this kind of expression, thus he was inevitably shocked.The Rock Cat observed the place for a bit and, not seeing any enemies, he sounded the place out by leaning forward in an imitation of a cat jumping down. However, the Rock Cat didn\u2019t actually jump.Xu ZiYan held his breath as he cursed in his mind. What a cunning spiritual beast. If he hadn\u2019t been assured of victory before, he might have been deceived by this beast and opened fire.As if it was assured that nobody was waiting to ambush it, the Rock Cat stared at the lush Polarized Grass and exposed a red tongue as it licked its lips.It gracefully leapt and landed onto the ground. The Rock Cat sniffed the place and looked a bit hesitant, but in the end it\u2019s craving for the Polarized Grass suppressed the doubts in it\u2019s heart and the spiritual beast slowly walked toward the patch of Polarized Grass.The Rock Cat slowly neared Xu ZiYan\u2019s hiding spot, but the pace of its footsteps became increasingly slow. It tried its best to sniff the scents in the air, but the smell of the Polarized Grass here was too strong and covered up all the other scents.Hesitating a long time at its current place, the Rock Cat slowly walked forward a few more steps.Just then, the sound of light footsteps came from a far. This Rock Cat suddenly puffed up all its fur as it turned around in an attempt to escape.Unfortunately, it was already too late.Xu ZiYan released a ray of lightning, suddenly barbecuing that Rock Cat so the outside was crispy while the inside was tender, until it was burned into a black ball\u2026\u2026z13Xu ZiRong: \u2026\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Realizing Xu ZiRong was using a very strange gaze as he stared at him, Xu ZiYan puzzledly asked.\u201cBig brother\u2026\u2026the most valuable part of a Rock Cat is its fur.\u201d\u201cI know ah,\u201d Xu ZiYan nodded, before appearing as he suddenly realized something. Stiffly turning around, he stared at that piece of burned charcoal: \u2026\u2026Xu ZiRong silently turned his head as his shoulders shook slightly. He swore that this wasn\u2019t a place to laugh, but for some unknown reason, seeing this big brother\u2019s stupid expression made him almost unable to restrain himself from laughing.You have to know, after he turned into a blood devil it had been many years since Xu ZiRong had last laughed. This person alone made him want to laugh so cheerfully, perhaps he would even leave him alive.\u201cCough cough, my hand slipped,\u201d Xu ZiYan\u2019s face looked completely embarrassed as his heart became depressed. His tall, mighty and handsome appearance ah\u2026\u2026it totally collapsed\u2026\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I know big brother is very powerful,\u201d Xu ZiRong softly told him.Xu ZiYan\u2019s face suddenly looked comforted. Having such a well-behaved little brother was really a joy ah! This child was even more considerate than the Xu ZiYu at his age!The other three who had heard the noise from Xu ZiYan\u2019s side also walked over. When they saw that piece of charcoal on the ground, everyone fell into a weird silence.Xu ZiJing gave Xu ZiYan a meaningful glance, \u201cIf you think the distribution of goods is unfair, you can just say it.\u201dXu ZiYan was practically unable to show his face. He rubbed his flaming cheeks and sincerely said: \u201cI really didn\u2019t do it intentionally.\u201dXu ZiJing responded in a voice as light as a feather. \u201cWhatever you say, but this loss of prey will be deducted from your share.\u201dXu ZiYan nodded without any hesitation. This was his own fault, so naturally he wouldn\u2019t refute her words.\u201cAlright, come out then,\u201d After Xu ZiJing finished taking care of Xu ZiYan\u2019s affairs, she turned around to face a big tree in the distance before slowly speaking.Very quickly, a group of people walked out beneath the big tree, headed by a teenager boy who looked around fifteen to sixteen. That teen had a very arrogant demeanor, and the gaze he used to look at Xu ZiJing and them was one filled with naked contempt.This was clearly written on that face that was at least a third like Xu ZiYan: you flock of stupid mortals!Xu ZiYan rubbed his chin. He felt Xu ZiYu had really rubbed off on him. That kid read a bunch of weird books online and when he was bored he would go and complain to Xu ZiYan. The results were that now, even he was using this unreliable way to describe people.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He only curbed that expression of his when he saw Xu ZiYan. After all, in Xu family the person with the highest status among their generation was Xu ZiYan and not him. Although he felt unwilling, Xu ZiHuan wasn\u2019t stupid enough to actually show it.His father had long told him to not limit his view by only looking at the small family of Xu family. Xu ZiYan\u2019s talent was indeed good, but the cultivation world was so large. There wouldn\u2019t be a shortage of people with heavenly spiritual veins, but how many of those were really able to have the last laugh? As long as Xu ZiHuan cultivated well and went to the Liu Guang Sect, his opportunities wouldn\u2019t necessarily be less than Xu ZiYan\u2019s.\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d Xu ZiJing frowned slightly. She really despised Xu ZiHuan\u2019s bossy and arrogant demeanor.\u201cNothing, we\u2019re only passing by,\u201d Despite replying, Xu ZiHuan never looked at Xu ZiJing. Instead, his gaze was firmly secured onto Xu ZiYan\u2019s body.Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyebrow rose but he did not speak. Since he had joined this team, he would comply with the team\u2019s rules. And since everything was to be negotiated by the captain, he naturally wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to talk.Seeing how Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t speak and how he had instead looked at Xu ZiJing, Xu ZiHuan\u2019s eyebrows wrinkled slightly. \u201cIn this team of yours, you actually let a woman become the captain?\u201dXu ZiYan shrugged his shoulders. He did not discriminate against women. What was wrong with them? Although the cultivation profession for women may be more difficult, for those clever and famous female cultivators, wasn\u2019t that a powerful role? Xu ZiJing was a good example. In the future she would become a very strong cultivator. Getting onto good terms with her now could also be considered as him scheming for benefits in the future. \u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256dXu ZiHuan\u2019s frown became tighter as he gave Xu ZiYan a glance that said: your dignity has fallen.Xu ZiYan pretended he couldn\u2019t see it. This kind of gaze that was neither itchy nor painful wasn\u2019t one he cared about.The corner of Xu ZiJing\u2019s lips tilted up in an undetectable curve before quickly disappearing as if it had never been there. She coldly stared at Xu ZiHuan. \u201cDo you still have business here?\u201dXu ZiHuan\u2019s face looked extremely gloomy. After giving Xu ZiJing a fierce glare, he turned around and left.The teenage boys and girls in his group looked at each other before quickly following him.From start to finish, Xu ZiRong had been observing Xu ZiYan\u2019s expressions. He found himself discovering another doubt about Xu ZiYan.If it was the Xu ZiYan from his last life, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have tolerated the provocative gaze from Xu ZiHuan. It was either this Xu ZiYan had become even more subtle, or\u2026\u2026His expression became a bit gloomy. Xu ZiRong was extremely not used to this feeling where not everything was under his control. Xu ZiYan\u2019s change was really too great, and he no longer knew if his plans could still proceed smoothly.In his last life, he could cultivate using Blood Sea Heart Sutra under the eyes of Xu family. Other than how the opposite party was confident about how he didn\u2019t have any contact with cultivation, his contempt for him was also a very big reason.Nobody would have thought that a normally bullied little child would boldly steal chicken from the kitchen in the middle of the night. Later he even dared to risk himself as he quietly snuck into the forest to practice slaughtering spiritual beasts.This was because, other than getting bullied during the day, nobody worried or cared about him. So Xu ZiRong had a lot of free time for him to use.But looking at his situation now, Xu ZiYan had practically placed him under his own eyelids. Thus, nowadays nobody dared to bully him. However, it also meant that if he wanted to do something secretly, that would also be quite problematic to accomplish.Gently rubbing his forehead, Xu ZiRong suppressed the irritability in his heart. Forget it. After all, one could achieve anything with enough effort. In his last life he was able to become a blood devil even though he was bullied into that miserable state. In this life, although he didn\u2019t know Xu ZiYan\u2019s purpose in treating him like this, it was still a huge improvement from before.\u201cZiRong, do you have a headache?\u201d Xu ZiYan noticed Xu ZiRong\u2019s action and asked with some concern.Xu ZiRong paused slightly before he raised his head and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dXu ZiYan saw that Xu ZiRong indeed didn\u2019t look as if he was uncomfortable and thus relaxed. Everyone once again started to hide themselves around the patch of Polarized Grass.After waiting for some time, this patch of grass didn\u2019t let them down. In total, they hunted four Rock Cats\u2014\u2014including the one Xu ZiYan had cooked into charcoal, it could be considered as finishing things as planned.Out of the four Rock Cats, two of them were hunted by Xu ZiYan. Because he now had the experience of zapping something into charcoal in that first attempt, he adjusted the spiritual energy output the second time and successfully harvested a half-cooked Rock Cat. =.=For the remaining two Rock Cats, one was captured by Xu ZiJing and the other was finished by Xu ZiXue.It could be estimated that most if not all of the Rock Cats who lived in this area were all captured by them in one go, so they decided to change locations.Xu ZiRong followed Xu ZiYan with a smile, but nobody noticed how his palm held a drop of bright red. That droplet of blood rotated in his palm. Threads of red wisps was drawn out before they followed Xu ZiRong\u2019s veins and arteries and entered his body.After Xu ZiYan slayed the Rock Cat, this drop of essence blood was obtained by him when he took the initiative to \u2018collect\u2019 the prey. As long as he was successful in absorbing this drop of essence blood, he would be able to enter the first layer of Qi Condensation Stage.Perhaps it was because he was very confident that Xu ZiYan wouldn\u2019t let him be harmed, Xu ZiRong felt at ease as he absorbed this essence blood while they walked. As the droplet of blood continuously decreased, the spiritual energy in Xu ZiRong\u2019s dantian grew.\u201cBe careful,\u201d just when they had all assembled in preparation to leave, Xu ZiLuo suddenly roared loudly. In between them, a dark shadow suddenly jumped out of the grass, pouncing toward the weakest Xu ZiRong.Xu ZiYan reacted very quickly. Extending his hand, five bolts of purple lightning suddenly shot out. The shadow that had rushed over suddenly released a scream as it twisted in the air in pain. After that, it changed its direction and still pounced toward Xu ZiRong.Xu ZiYan\u2019s heart was very startled. He was still getting used to using spiritual energy, and so in his moment of desperation just now he had already inputted all the spiritual energy in his body in those 5 bolts of lightning. Now his body was empty of energy and thus it was completely impossible for him to defend Xu ZiRong again.The colour of Xu ZiRong\u2019s face immediately changed. The shadow that had pounced over had obviously made him its target. In addition, with his current strength, even resisting wasn\u2019t something possible.That pale grey spiritual beast opened its mouth wide, dirty fluids dripping down from it. It\u2019s scarlet eyes were transfixed on Xu ZiRong\u2019s head, where its two strong forepaws could penetrate Xu ZiRong\u2019s skull at any time.ratdemonBrain-Devouring Rat!Seeing its face, everyone recognized this extremely frightful spiritual beast.This spiritual beast was adept at making sneak attacks. It ate brains and the most powerful part of its body were those two front paws. Making a fatal blow, those paws could completely penetrate one\u2019s skull to dig out a brain.After this Brain-Devouring Rat attacked one must never hesitate to flee. If he managed to catch Xu ZiRong\u2019s head, there wouldn\u2019t be any chance of him surviving.Splat\u2026\u2026Just when Xu ZiRong thought he had been reborn just to die again here, blood splattered in front of his eyes.Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyes suddenly became wider as he stared at the Xu ZiYan who stood in front of him to block the attack. The Brain-Devouring Rat\u2019s front paws poked a bloody hole in the other\u2019s shoulder.\u201cKill it!\u201d Xu ZiJing yelled loudly as she, Xu ZiXue and Xu ZiLuo all released their attacks.That Brain-Devouring Rat was already half-dead because of Xu ZiYan\u2019s lightning bolts. After being surrounded by Xu ZiJing and the other two, it quickly died.Meanwhile, Xu ZiRong stared in disbelief at the Xu ZiYan who, though his face was twisted because of his pain, still squeezed out an ugly smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? ZiRong is fine, right?\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu ZiRong\u2019s lips moved. His mind was now completely messed up, making it impossible for him to think.Why did Xu ZiYan save him? He couldn\u2019t understand, he completely couldn\u2019t understand!\u201cHiss\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu ZiYan inhaled, completely not noticing what Xu ZiRong had said. Although he had long anticipated the cruelty of the cultivation world, his first injury was actually this severe. It really exceeded his expectations.giphy-facebook_sHe also knew that at this moment he surely cut an extremely sorry figure. Even without further examinations, just looking at the Xu ZiRong who was scared speechless told him all he needed to know.That Brain-Devouring Rat had penetrated his shoulder and his blood had splattered all over Xu ZiRong\u2019s face. It probably scared the child to death.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid ZiRong, big brother is completely fine,\u201d he tried extremely hard to use a gentle tone to comfort Xu ZiRong, though unfortunately the effect wasn\u2019t that good. After all, his shoulder was still bleeding so those words probably didn\u2019t seem so convincing.Xu ZiRong couldn\u2019t help but tremble. He stared at that Xu ZiYan who, though his face was twisted due to pain, was still trying to comfort him and felt unexplainably excited.He did not know where that excitement came from and only stuck out his tongue to taste the blood by the corner of his lips. Warm but with a metallic sweet taste\u2026\u2026delicious\u2026\u2026something coveted\u2026\u2026A hint of blood-red appeared in Xu ZiRong\u2019s pupils, something that looked both strange and fascinating.Xu ZiYan really didn\u2019t devote any energy to notice how his precious baby brother\u2019s eyes had changed colour. Forgive him, this person who lived under China\u2019s flag and never suffered such a heavy injury. Even if a cultivator\u2019s body was levels tougher than a normal person\u2019s, getting a hole poked into his shoulder still hurt like crazy alright\u2026\u2026Xu ZiYan\u2019s shoulder injury and how his body was completely empty of spiritual energy made him uncomfortable to death. However, he still had to maintain the image of an elder brother, so he could only withstand the pain as he pulled aside the Xu ZiRong who had sat onto the ground.The other party kept behaving as if he had suffered an extreme shock. Xu ZiYan could only hug him as he stroked his back, trying his best to comfort this \u2018scared to death\u2019 child.Xu ZiRong only obediently laid in Xu ZiYan\u2019s lap, his long eyelashes covering all the expressions in his eyes.In fact, he felt a bit ridiculous. This was because that hand gently caressing his back was awkward to the point others couldn\u2019t bear to watch it, but the warmth it imparted made Xu ZiRong hate to refuse it.Xu ZiYan\u2019s injury wasn\u2019t light and his shoulder was still bleeding. It could be said that the most fitting thing he should do right now was to take out the medicine from his interspatial bag to treat his injury\u2026\u2026instead of stupidly trying to coax a child.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why would Xu ZiYan risk his own life to save him?He was Xu ZiRong\u2019s older brother, someone who belonged just to him!God must have seen his miserable first life, and therefore they intentionally bestowed a good older brother to him this time.The blood splatters on Xu ZiRong\u2019s face practically made it indistinguishable. It already looked very scary, and coupled with his current strange smile it would make anyone shudder.Unfortunately, at this moment he had buried his face into Xu ZiYan\u2019s arms, and nobody could see how a creepy and strange smile was on that delicate little face.\u201cBig brother, you\u2019re still bleeding.\u201d Xu ZiRong tidied up his emotions before he raised his head and stared at Xu ZiYan in concern.Right now his concern wasn\u2019t faked because he had recognized that this \u2018Xu ZiYan\u2019 was the \u2018big brother\u2019 God had given him. He did not care who this person used to be, but since he had succeeded in stealing Xu ZiYan\u2019s body, the other must fulfill his obligation as Xu ZiRong\u2019s older brother.All the affection he didn\u2019t get in his last life, he finally had the chance to make up for it now.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it doesn\u2019t hurt at all,\u201d Xu ZiYan\u2019s face was stark white, and large droplets of sweat beaded his forehead.Xu ZiRong bit his lower lip before revealing a guilty expression. \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault. If big brother didn\u2019t need to save me, you wouldn\u2019t have gotten hurt.\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d Xu ZiYan laboriously used his uninjured hand to rub Xu ZiRong\u2019s head. \u201cIsn\u2019t it natural for a big brother to protect their little brother?\u201dSomething flashed in Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyes. He slightly lowered his face before uttering a quiet \u2018yes\u2019.Xu ZiYan smiled before he accidentally moved his injured shoulder. He couldn\u2019t help but hissing in pain.Xu ZiJing gave the Brain-Devouring Rat mess to Xu ZiXue and Xu ZiLuo to handle before walking over to Xu ZiYan herself. Giving him a look, she started to speak in a faint tone. \u201cYour emotional brotherly scene has ended by now, right?\u201dXu ZiYan laughed \u2018haha\u2019 as Xu ZiRong lowered his head even more in embarrassment.Xu ZiJing only raised her eyebrow. \u201cIf you don\u2019t treat your injury now, all your blood will probably leak away.\u201dOnly then did Xu ZiYan take out his medicine from his interspatial bag. He handed it to Xu ZiJing, because the place of his injury wasn\u2019t one that was easy for him to handle. Who knew that Xu ZiRong would intercept that medicine before it got to Xu ZiJing, and then he went over to apply it onto Xu ZiYan himself.Xu ZiJing shrugged before she turned around to help Xu ZiXue clean up the Brain-Devouring Rat. Naturally she didn\u2019t mind putting on medicine for her teammate Xu ZiYan. However, since other people were happy to do it, she was also happy to give them the job.Xu ZiRong very carefully cleaned Xu ZiYan\u2019s wound before he evenly spread on the medicinal powder. Right now he was like a very obedient little brother, completely devoted to treating his brother\u2019s injuries.Xu ZiYan felt moved. He still remembered how before, when he had gotten injured, Xu ZiYu also helped him bandage his wounds. Only Xu ZiYu kept giving him wordy and long-winded scoldings as he tended to him, contrarily to Xu ZiRong\u2019s increasingly lovable actions.When Xu ZiRong finished treating the wound, the first thing he saw when he lifted his head was Xu ZiYan\u2019s expression as he immersed himself in his memories.His face sank slightly before it reverted back to normal. Then, Xu ZiRong pretended to be casual as he asked the other: \u201cBig brother, what are you thinking about?\u201dXu ZiYan returned from his thoughts and saw that face that was completely different from Xu ZiYu. It was hard for him to not experience a sense of disappointment as he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dXu ZiRong suddenly clenched his hands into fists before he forced himself to relax. He felt that the violent feeling in his heart seemed to want to rise up again. Xu ZiRong just realized that this \u2018big brother\u2019 he had acknowledged had a lot of secrets, and he didn\u2019t like it.He didn\u2019t like it at all!In the end, he didn\u2019t care who had replaced Xu ZiYan\u2019s existence, and whether it was possession or something else he didn\u2019t mind it at all. What he cared about was that since this person was here for him (or so he believed), then Xu ZiYan\u2019s heart shouldn\u2019t think of anyone else. No matter who it may be, it wasn\u2019t okay.Xu ZiYan was the gift God had given him. He was the gift that was to compensate all the hardships he had suffered in his previous life. No one else had suffered like he did, so what right did they have to get a share of his gift?Yes, in Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyes, Xu ZiYan was the present God had given him. He only belonged to him!\u201cHiss, it hurts it hurts. ZiRong, please be more gentle ah,\u201d unconsciously, Xu ZiRong began to use more force. Xu ZiYan suddenly found himself unable to bear it and could only cry out.\u201cI\u2019m sorry big brother,\u201d Xu ZiRong had a look of guilt on his face, but his eyes glowed with a touch of pleasure.\u201cHiss\u2026\u2026it\u2019s fine\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu ZiYan gently shook his head. After the medical treatment, the blood had already stopped flowing. The medicine he was carrying was something Xu Xiao had given him. It\u2019s effects weren\u2019t normal and just in a few minutes, his wound became a bit itchy as it actually started to scab over.Xu ZiYan got up from the ground but suddenly felt very faint and thus he almost fell back down. He thought this was a normal effect of blood loss, and did not notice how the Xu ZiRong standing behind him swallowed a bright red droplet of blood behind the cover of his sleeve.Xu ZiRong tilted his lips into a smile. The incident before had very easily allowed him to collect some of Xu ZiYan\u2019s essence blood. With this drop of blood, no matter where Xu ZiYan went Xu ZiRong would always be able to track him down. In the future, even if Xu ZiYan wanted to escape from him it would definitely be impossible.Cultivators were always very careful with their own essence blood, because there were many evil martial arts techniques that could use one\u2019s essence blood to affect their bodies. Only, Xu ZiYan was quite young and naturally didn\u2019t know the importance of his essence blood. It was also precisely because of this that Xu ZiRong would be so easily able to get the other\u2019s essence blood.The others sorted out the Brain-Devouring Rat mess. Although Xu ZiYan\u2019s injury made this harvest a bit not worth it, just thinking about how this Brain-Devouring Rat was a spiritual beast at the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage made Xu ZiYan unable to stop grinning.In this part of the forest, it wasn\u2019t like there weren\u2019t spiritual beasts at the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. However, most of them were difficult to deal with. For example, this Brain-Devouring Rat. If it didn\u2019t take the initiative to mount a sneak attack, Xu ZiYan was afraid that with their abilities they would have never noticed it.With this Brain-Devouring Rat, the most difficult part of their trip was now taken care of. After all, although Xu ZiYan was very strong, the prey he had to hunt had the highest difficulty as well.During their break time, Xu ZiYan luxuriously took out a piece of spiritual rock to recover his strength.The spiritual energy that would usually take at least one shichen of mediating to recover, with the help of the spiritual stone, restored his dantian in the short time it would take to steep half a cup of tea. And, though he didn\u2019t know if it was because he had suddenly used up all of the spiritual energy in his body, Xu ZiYan actually discovered that his dantian had slightly expanded. It could really be considered as a blessing in disguise.After the Brain-Devouring Rat, although Xu ZiYan\u2019s injury affected his skills a bit, their team still smoothly obtained the other prey they needed. Other than exerting a bit more effort for the Double-Tailed Scorpion that was at the fifth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, something Xu ZiJing needed, the rest of their journey was extremely relaxed.aaa16-06-24-07-14-18-6636-ss-6Before nightfall, they followed the markers they left behind and walked out of the forest before returning to the bottom of the cliff. However, looking at that completely empty cliff, everybody couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit speechless.Using the Dragon Rope Loop to go down was quite convenient, but if you wanted to go back up\u2014\u2014haha!Rubbing his nose, Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t help but feel fortunate about how they had Xu ZiJing, that careful woman. If she had not brought a map, finding the way out of the forest really would have been quite difficult\u2026\u2026Xu ZiJing\u2019s team could be considered as an extremely lucky one. Not only were they the earliest to return to the martial arts training hall, they also had a full harvest.They hunted a total of four Rock Cats, one Brain-Devouring Rat, one Double-Tailed Scorpion, two Cauliflower Snakes\u2026\u2026don\u2019t laugh at that name, it was actually a proper spiritual beast at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. The reason they were named that was because they had a sarcoma that looked remarkably like cauliflower growing on top of their heads. The venom of Cauliflower Snakes weren\u2019t in their fangs and were rather in these cauliflower sarcomas. If one weren\u2019t very familiar with these beasts, it would be easy to be tricked by them.After handing over their prey, the team successfully passed this real-combat test. The extra prey they had brought were directly sold into Xu family\u2019s shop, and each of them got five low-level spiritual rocks. Of course, Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t get a share. \u2192.\u2192After placing the spiritual rocks into his interspatial bag, Xu ZiYan started returning to Xu family with Xu ZiRong. On the way back, the road was filled with people who had returned from the forest. Most of these people were wounded, but unfortunately it was impossible to tell how well their haul today was.Tomorrow they didn\u2019t have classes at the martial arts training hall, so Xu ZiYan intended to take Xu ZiRong and go strolling in Mo New Town.The pellet medicine and spiritual stones on his body were mostly given to him by the Xu family, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about it. However, Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t receive such good treatment. Thus, Xu ZiYan planned to buy him some pellet medicine in hopes that the other would cultivate faster.After three years he would have to leave for Liu Guang Sect. He could not make sure that after he left, Xu family would still be kind to Xu ZiRong. To be honest, he really had no confidence in that \u2018father\u2019 of his.After the two brothers arrived at Liu Shang Court, they each returned to their own rooms. Xu ZiYan also specifically reminded Xu ZiRong that the other must wake him up early tomorrow\u2026\u2026_(:\u0437\u300d\u2220)_ Alright. Since this bed dawdling bad habit of his was already discovered by Xu ZiRong, he\u2019ll also no longer try to hide it. Xu ZiRong could even conveniently become his humanoid alarm clock. Xu ZiYan even started pondering if both of them should just live in the same bedroom\u2026\u2026On the next morning, Xu ZiRong woke up extremely early.After yesterday\u2019s hunt, he already collected a lot of essence blood from the spiritual beasts. Compared to how he had originally used chicken blood to cultivate the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, his conditions now were already levels better than before.After a whole night of absorbing the blood, he successfully entered the first layer of Qi Condensation Stage. If it wasn\u2019t how levelling up too much would arouse other people\u2019s suspicions, he could rush up into the third layer of Qi Condensation Stage with one breath in just seven days.The only slightly regrettable thing in yesterday\u2019s hunt was that from start to finish, Xu ZiYan never let him out of his sight. Therefore, he was unable to vent out the increasingly dangerous ball of anger in his body.The blood tint in his eyes was more thick than it had been yesterday. Xu ZiRong spent a lot of effort before he was able to suppress that desire for violence.Licking his lips, Xu ZiRong couldn\u2019t help but recall that fragrant and sweet blood from yesterday. Unfortunately that was from the \u2018big brother\u2019 he had acknowledged, so he couldn\u2019t eat him.After the red tint in his eyes completely disappeared, Xu ZiRong got out of bed and put on his clothes before walking into Xu ZiYan\u2019s bedroom.Spending some effort, he managed to get Xu ZiYan out of bed. After they both ate a simple breakfast, Xu ZiYan excitedly brought Xu ZiRong to go shopping.Saying that was a bit shameful, but although Xu ZiYan had the memories of his predecessor, walking around in such an old ancient town was really a new and fascinating experience for him. It was hard for him to cover up his excitement as he wandered everywhere, so he looked just like a country bumpkin that had recently entered a city.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The spiritual rocks in his bag was pretty much used up, so the both of them returned to the Xu home.Xu ZiRong was extremely surprised when he received Xu ZiYan\u2019s gift, because he realized that Xu ZiYan had practically fulfilled his fantasy of what an \u2018older brother\u2019 was supposed to be like.He gently rubbed the pellet medicine he completely thought was worthless, his heart feeling exceptionally pleasant. Being doted on like this felt too wonderful, to the point it gave him the feeling that continuing like this wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea.The sweet smile on his face slowly dying down, Xu ZiRong looked at the not quite tall figure in front of him as a fretful feeling suddenly emerged in his heart.The feeling of anger in his body suddenly exploded as both Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyes became tinted with a thick red.Damn!Xu ZiRong cursed in his heart. He would never have expected that the ball of anger would suddenly erupt now. If Xu ZiYan found out about his other side, then that wouldn\u2019t be fun.\u201cZiRong? Did something happen?\u201d The way Xu ZiRong suddenly stopped naturally attracted Xu ZiYan\u2019s attention.\u201cBig brother\u2026\u2026I want to eat sesame seed candy,\u201d Xu ZiRong lowered his head, completely not daring to expose both of his eyes.e8aabfe695b4e5a4a7e5b08f1e58fb0e781a3e9bb91e88a9de9babbe7b396-e8bf91e68b8dHearing that, Xu ZiYan smiled. He looked around and sure enough, there was a store selling candy right across from them. Turning back, he told Xu ZiRong: \u201cWait a little bit for me here, I\u2019ll go and buy it for you.\u201dXu ZiRong nodded his head, and after watching the leaving back of Xu ZiYan, he immediately escaped into the alley behind him.He can\u2019t vent out this feeling of violence in front of Xu ZiYan!The only thought in Xu ZiRong\u2019s mind at that moment was that idea. If this ball of anger he had suppressed so many times was released, it would result in such tragic consequences that even he couldn\u2019t predict.He looked for an alleyway that seemed as deserted as possible, avoiding the places with a lot of people. Very quickly, Xu ZiRong found an extremely secluded corner.He quietly shrunk into the corner, repeatedly trembling with his blood-red eyes. There wasn\u2019t any smells of living things around him, which made him even more desperate for blood.\u201cYo, such an extremely beautiful little brother. Are you lost?\u201d A frivolous-looking man asked in front of him.Xu ZiRong slowly raised his head. When the man saw Xu ZiRong\u2019s face, he was immediately startled to death as his face revealed a greedy and lustful look.Xu ZiRong looked at this man as the corner of his lips tilted up. The hint of his smile made this man stare at Xu ZiRong harder, and even his breathing became heavier.It was really\u2026\u2026timely\u2026\u2026Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t expect to meet this man here\u2026\u2026The blood-red colour in Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyes became more and more thick as the smile on his face became more attractive. He opened his cherry red lips to say: \u201cUncle\u2026\u2026I can\u2019t find my way home\u2026\u2026\u201dThe obscene look on the man\u2019s face was impossible to be covered up as he asked in pants: \u201cThen can Uncle bring you home with him?\u201d\u201cOkay ah\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu ZiRong smiled sweetly as he reached toward him\u2026\u2026***After the time it took to burn a single fragrant incense stick, Xu ZiYan found himself in front of a small face. He finally found Xu ZiRong.Xu ZiYan\u2019s serious face plainly said the four big words: I am not happy.Xu ZiRong lowered his head in guilt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, big brother\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything before leaving? Do you know how worried big brother was?!\u201d Xu ZiYan was extremely angry. You have know, when he came out of the candy shop and realized Xu ZiRong was missing, he was scared to the point his soul had flown away.Although this Mo New Town could be considered as one under Xu family\u2019s control, there were still many places in this town that were dirty and bad.Not talking about other things, but just the fact of how the original him had managed to hire a pedophile in this town to corner Xu ZiRong was enough proof. If the other really met that kind of disgusting man because of his carelessness, then his treasured baby brother might be scared until he twisted.Xu ZiYan knew that a lot of homicidal maniacs became the way they were because they had experienced some sort of shock when they were young. Xu ZiRong already had the inclinations to become a maniac. If he really encountered something and became completely crooked, then it would be too late for Xu ZiYan to even cry.\u201cBig brother\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu ZiRong pitifully grabbed a corner of Xu ZiYan\u2019s sleeves. \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was as if Xu ZiYan\u2019s extreme anger was like a popped balloon as it completely disappeared.He looked at the food stalls, looked at Xu ZiRong, and then suddenly felt very guilty. Xu ZiYan was already at the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, so eating one meal was enough to let him persist for some time. However, Xu ZiRong was only eight and only at the first layer of Qi Condensation Stage. He was afraid that the little things they had eaten in the morning were completely digested by now, and Xu ZiRong becoming hungry wasn\u2019t strange at all.\u201cZiRong, do you want to eat noodles?\u201d Xu ZiYan asked.Xu ZiRong nodded his head gently. Actually, he completely didn\u2019t care about what they were going to eat. He had passed his time in Xu family with so much suffering, so going hungry wasn\u2019t a big deal to him. Only, he discovered that the more pitiful he acted, the more his \u2018good older brother\u2019 would dote on him, so of course he had to take advantage of that point.Sure enough, the moment he said he was hungry, Xu ZiYan immediately looked guilty. What was most interesting was that the other actually planned to cook for him himself. That was really something one wouldn\u2019t expect to see in ten thousand years.Kindhearted, affable, and capable of assessing the situation\u2014\u2014in Xu ZiRong\u2019s little mental book, he added the point \u2018can cook\u2019 to his list of Xu ZiYan\u2019s characteristics.Bringing Xu ZiRong back to Xu home in the quickest speed he could use, Xu ZiYan blamed himself as he walked for not being careful enough.It was the time when a small child grew. What could he do if the other didn\u2019t grow tall because of a lack of nutrients\u2026\u2026ah, saying that, he really was too careless. Xu ZiYan even forgot to make nutritious meals for Xu ZiRong.Xu ZiYan was thinking about how to match foods when they passed the opening of an alleyway. He only gave it a glance when he discovered that there was a lot of people inside.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d He felt a bit curious and was going to go in to take a look, but he stopped when he heard the words of the people around him.\u201cIt\u2019s truly a sin! I just knew that scum would get retribution,\u201d a middle-aged auntie with a basket full of vegetables said.\u201cAh, hearing what the people inside said, that prince died in a pretty terrible way. Who knew what kind of person he had offended,\u201d an old lady who had the face of a horse commented as well.The middle-aged auntie laughed loudly. \u201cHn, that piece of scum, even dying is well-deserved! Last time I saw him bring back a pretty young girl to his court. Afterwards, I never saw that child again. Although he had said he sent her to her relatives, who would believe that!\u201dThe old woman with the face of a horse also looked disgusted. \u201cPeople like that, it\u2019s good that they died! But I heard the others say that his body was ripped into shreds. That ground there is covered in blood, it really scared people to death!\u201dHearing that, the middle-aged auntie also had a face full of fright. She asked softly: \u201cHow much hatred did they have ah. They didn\u2019t even let off a corpse.\u201d\u201cWho knows, it might even be a victim of that prince,\u201d the old woman with the horse face replied loudly.The two people sighed with emotion before parting ways. The Xu ZiYan who didn\u2019t stand too far away from them also pulled on Xu ZiRong and led them out of there.With the help of the two women\u2019s words, he had pretty much determined the identity of the person who had died. However, with scum like that, it was a good thing he died. Xu ZiYAn\u2019s curiosity from before was also completely extinguished. He didn\u2019t want his own little brother to see such a bloody and gory scene. If it shocked his little brother then that would be bad. \u256e(\u256f_\u2570)\u256dXu ZiYan hurriedly rushed home with Xu ZiRong, and completely didn\u2019t notice how his good little brother was currently bowing his head. Xu ZiRong had a treacherous smile as his eyes shined with exhilaration.The taste of blood, the smell of fear, and the look of horror in that man\u2019s eyes truly made him feel incomparably invigorated.This was just the first one\u2026\u2026all those people who had humiliated him, he wouldn\u2019t let off a single one!***When the two of them returned to Liu Shang Court, Xu ZiYan told Xu ZiRong to return to his bedroom. Xu ZiRong\u2019s face changed subtly, before the other plastered on a look full of hope as he stared at Xu ZiYan. \u201cBig brother, can I watch you do it?\u201dXu ZiYan was startled. \u201cYou have an interest in cooking?\u201d This was the trick his father had used to obtain his mother, and the thing both he and his brother ZiYu was taught! His old man had told them that, if you wanted to have your lover\u2019s heart, then you must first conquer your sweetheart\u2019s stomach! As a good man of the new century, you must make sure your cooking skill was completely maxed out!However, Xu ZiYan knew that in the ancient times, noblemen who stayed clear of the kitchen was still quite the fashion. He did not care about what others might think about him, but Xu ZiRong saying he wanted to watch him cook still made him feel slightly surprised.Xu ZiRong smiled in embarrassment. \u201cBig brother is cooking for me today, so I hope that in the future I can cook for big brother.\u201dXu ZiYan was once again extremely touched by this lovable little brother, to the point he became a mess. He fiercely hugged the other and cuddled him. Although this child wasn\u2019t ZiYu, he might really be much more sweeter than ZiYu.ZiYu that smelly brat\u2026\u2026 =\u76bf=Xu ZiRong smiled as he stayed beside Xu ZiYan, but the hand under his sleeve was clenched into a tight fist.It came again\u2026\u2026the other once again revealed that look of nostalgia!When all was said and done, who was it?! Who would make Xu ZiYan so concerned about them? Was it again that person ZiYu?Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyes became chilly as a tint of blood-red appeared in them. When he found out the identity of that \u2018ZiYu\u2019 person, he\u2019ll send him back to be reincarnated!The people his brother could be concerned about, just him would be enough. There shouldn\u2019t be room for other people!Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t notice the shadow that flashed over Xu ZiRong\u2019s face. As he walked toward the kitchen, he explained some basic cooking tips to Xu ZiRong.Xu ZiRong quietly listened to him, but his mind was moving at a quick speed. As long as cultivators had cultivations higher than Foundation Establishment, they could abstain from eating. Even if they did eat, all they ate would be some spiritual mushrooms or grass. The things Xu ZiYan talked about were all ordinary foods. If you ate a lot of food like that, then there would be an accumulation of impurities in your body, something unconducive to cultivation.He stared at Xu ZiYan\u2019s look of delight as he talked about cooking and felt his doubts become deeper. This Xu ZiYan was becoming someone he couldn\u2019t see through even more.Xu ZiYan\u2019s appearance in the kitchen made all the Xu family chefs scared to death. They were all ordinary people, so toward Xu families cultivators they all felt some innate fear.The head chef in the kitchen was a tall and strong man. He grabbed a piece of cloth to wipe the sweat off his forehead as he foolishly asked: \u201cYoung Master, why did you come here?\u201dAfter he finished talking, he glared at all his cooks as he scolded them: \u201cSay it! Are you guys not caring for the brat with utmost care?!\u201dAll the chefs didn\u2019t say a single word. They were all slaves of Xu family, and their whole lives were in the hands of Xu family. Unless they didn\u2019t want to live anyone, who would dare to not be hardworking?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUpon seeing this, Xu ZiYan smiled. He knew that him appearing here probably made the cooks a bit frightened, but this head chef was quite interesting. He clearly made his words seem as if he was letting out some anger, but in reality, he was just protecting his cooks.Xu ZiYan waved his hand, gesturing for them to relax. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just that I am a bit hungry, so I wanted to make something to eat.\u201dHearing that, the beefy head chef felt happy. It was good as long as he didn\u2019t come looking for trouble. Also, if the Young Master liked the things they made, perhaps they could even get a reward.\u201cDo not hesitate to command us, Young Master. Whatever you want to eat, just open your mouth to tell us, and I guarantee that we will immediately make it.\u201d The beefy man patted his chest so loudly it sounded like thunder. It even made the top of Xu ZiYan\u2019s head tingle.Good god, this guy\u2019s voice was really not ordinary. Xu ZiYan was already a cultivator at the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. Although he didn\u2019t prepare any defenses against the other, the fact how just the person\u2019s speaking voice alone made his eyesight go blurry was enough to prove this beefy man\u2019s abilities.Xu ZiYan quickly ran a lap in his brain, but he, unfortunately, didn\u2019t find this person\u2019s figure in that group of future powerful cultivators. However, if this person\u2019s distinct voice were paired with that type of roaring martial arts, the lethality would for sure be amazing.When he thought of that, Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t help but rub his chin as he started pondering.Back then, after Xu ZiYan entered the Liu Guang Sect, he hadn\u2019t even finished learning everything when Xu ZiRong washed the whole Xu family with blood. Other than those treasures that were long hidden, not even a single strand of hair was left for him.Afterwards, Xu ZiYan struggled alone and cut off from any others in his path of cultivation, with many cases of life and death situations dotting his journey. Indeed, just the memories Xu ZiYan had looked through would make one\u2019s head feel numb from fright. It could be said that Xu ZiYan becoming one of Xuan Yu region\u2019s Four Honored persons in the future was an event that is inseparable from his own efforts.However, this also gave the current Xu ZiYan some ideas.If they were to judge their individual combat abilities, it was true that out of the Four Honored people, Xu ZiYan possessed the strongest combat power. But when considering their backing, whether it was Lin XiaoTian\u2019s Tianyu Sect or Mo ZiYuan\u2019s Moyu Long Court, they were both the most powerful groups in Xuan Yu region. Xu family that had completely declined couldn\u2019t even be compared.Back then, it was due to Bai Hua\u2019s insistence that allowed Lin XianTian and Mo ZiYuan to reluctantly recognize Xu ZiYan\u2019s position. However, the Xu ZiYan now don\u2019t plan on becoming part of their group. Thus he naturally wanted to prepare for his own future.Even if Xu family won\u2019t be wiped out, it was still a long cry from Tianyu Sect or Moyu Long Court. So, it was impossible for Xu family to protect Xu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong if they were to be pressured by these two great forces.In exaggerated terms, if that situation really happened, Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t guarantee whether or not Xu Xiao would surrender the two of them for the family\u2019s benefit. After all, in Xu Xiao\u2019s perspective, the family\u2019s interests were much more important than his sons.In truth, Xu ZiYan put a lot of significance on the contents of that novel. Although he looked down on that man called Bai Hua, he had to admit that Bai Hua\u2019s luck was truly quite extraordinary. Not only could he safely escape from various dangerous threats, but practically all the people who opposed him had died.One of the most unfortunate in that group of people was Xu ZiRong. Not only did Bai Hua manage to snatch countless treasures that should have fallen into his hands, but Xu ZiRong was even slandered by him. In the end, he got blamed as a world-destroying demon before his soul was shattered as he died.Xu ZiYan would never allow such a fate to befall Xu ZiRong ever again. In that case, he must build up his own group, one that would be able to contend with forces like Tianyu Sect and Moyu Long Court.He didn\u2019t seek to be able to defeat them, but at the very least they needed to be powerful enough to make those groups want to avoid them. Something like easily dumping a black pot on Xu ZiRong\u2019s head absolutely cannot happen! As Xu ZiYan\u2019s little brother, even if he did something wrong, could only be disciplined by his big brother. Opinions of any outsiders were worth less than a piece of hair!That\u2019s right! Xu ZiYan had this exact habit of shielding his precious people\u2019s shortcomings!!! He didn\u2019t care about what outsiders might say. As long as Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t do anything that would surpass the bottom limit of his three views, he would always protect his own little brother.\u201cBig brother?\u201d Xu ZiRong pulled on Xu ZiYan\u2019s sleeve to remind the other that the head chef\u2019s smile had practically turned frozen solid by now.Xu ZiYan was brought out of his thoughts and smiled in embarrassment. He finally answered: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you guys can go busy yourself. I can do everything myself.\u201d\u201cWhat!!!\u201d The beefy man was alarmed. He didn\u2019t hear it wrong, right? Young Master wasn\u2019t satisfied and wanted to make something himself? Could it be, Young Master wasn\u2019t satisfied with their cooking??!!\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous,\u201d Xu ZiYan saw through the head chef\u2019s fears before he smiled reassuringly at him. \u201cI only want to make a bowl of noodles for ZiRong, so I don\u2019t plan to make anything big or special.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d The beefy man let out a breath of relief before wiping the sweat that had gathered on his forehead. \u201cYoung Master, wouldn\u2019t it be best if\u2026\u2026\u201dXu ZiYan waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, you guys can go busy yourselves, I can handle it.\u201dThe beefy man backed away. With the Young Master saying that they didn\u2019t need to care about him. The amount of courage they had made it impossible for them to say anything more to refute him. As a result, although the many cooks began accomplishing their own work under the scolding of the head chef, everyone\u2019s gaze kept drifting back to the little Young Master who wanted to \u2018single-handedly show off his own craftsmanship\u2019\u2026\u2026Among the many puzzled, helpless, and suspicious gazes of the cooks, Xu ZiYan skillfully dragged out an apron and shook it before attaching it to his waist. Then, he began to add some water and noodles to a bowl.After washing his hands, Xu ZiRong stood quietly to the side. He believed that since Xu ZiYan had brought this up, it wouldn\u2019t be him just saying some empty words. However, Xu ZiRong was still a bit shocked because Xu ZiYan\u2019s actions were too well-practiced. Whether it was kneading the dough, rolling it into strips or slicing them into noodles, even Xu ZiYan\u2019s last action of cracking an egg into the pan was smooth and swift.If you were to say Xu ZiRong was surprised, then those cooks were simply shocked to death!The fact that the little Young Master could cook already surprised them, but what was even more frightening was the fact that he could cook so well!!!Just the scent of the air let everyone know that this egg with noodles dish was done exceptionally successfully. In fact, a few cooks couldn\u2019t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.\u201cTry out big brother\u2019s cooking?\u201d A bowl of noodles decorated with salted vegetables and containing an egg was placed in front of Xu ZiRong.img_2713Xu ZiYan\u2019s smile covered his whole face as he gave himself a point in his heart. Although he transmigrated, his cooking skills didn\u2019t regress. In the future, he could also count on it to help him pursue his wife. Although he wasn\u2019t sure exactly where his wife was right now, practicing early was always a good thing.Xu ZiRong looked at that bowl of noodles in front of him, his mood is both sour and complex. Golden noodles with green vegetables and hints of spice floating on the top, it was clearly an extremely normal bowl of noodles, but it made him suddenly comprehend something.Xu ZiRong picked up his chopsticks in a stupefied daze and began to gulp down the noodles in giant mouthfuls. It scared Xu ZiYan into repeatedly trying to persuade him to eat slower, but as if he didn\u2019t hear him Xu ZiRong finished this giant bowl of noodles in this manner.After finishing, he rubbed his mouth with a warm and comfortable stomach. Xu ZiRong raised his head and revealed a bright and pure smile. \u201cBig brother, the noodles are very delicious.\u201dXu ZiYan frowned and rubbed his head with some force. \u201cIf it\u2019s delicious then it\u2019s delicious. What\u2019s the use of eating it so fast? You\u2019re not even afraid of choking! If you think it\u2019s delicious, next time big brother can make it for you again.\u201dXu ZiRong\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cOkay ah, then next time big brother will make it for me again. In the future, can big brother only make it for me?\u201d\u201cAlright ah.\u201d Xu ZiYan casually answered. He didn\u2019t think that his cooking skills were something earth-shattering, and they merely had the most common home-cooked flavor. Other than Xu ZiRong, he was afraid that nobody else would get a chance to taste his creations. Also, it was rare for Xu ZiRong to ask for a request so there was no way he would refuse.As for his future wife, when he married, it was estimated that Xu ZiRong would have long grown up. It wasn\u2019t like he would still care about a silly joke of a promise they made when they were children. (He would\u2026\u2026)The moment Xu ZiYan\u2019s agreement left his mouth, Xu ZiRong smiled as his eyes narrowed.Big brother\u2026\u2026if you do not keep the promises you made to me, there would be severe consequences\u2026\u2026After they finished the noodles, the two siblings left the kitchen. Before leaving, Xu ZiYan called over the beefy man and quietly told him a few words. The head chef\u2019s shocked expression turned into one of extreme gratitude. When he sent Xu ZiYan out, he was practically excited to the point he couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201cBig brother, why do you want to rope him in?\u201d Xu ZiRong asked, a bit puzzled. To him, that man was a waste. He could understand Xu ZiYan\u2019s behavior of attracting people to him for his own benefit but can\u2019t understand why he would want a person who didn\u2019t even have the most basic level of cultivation.Xu ZiYan responded with a smile: \u201cIs ZiRong confused as to why I didn\u2019t want to attract those branch family Xu children?\u201dXu ZiRong nodded. In his memories, many of those Xu family branch children had surrounded Xu ZiYan, although unfortunately they were later slaughtered by him.\u201cZiRong, you must remember, those Xu family branch children. All the resources for their cultivating come from Xu family, and the one they are most loyal to is obviously Xu family. I do not plan to rebel against Xu family, but the people I need are the ones that are completely loyal to me. Especially if there is a conflict between Xu family and me, they must remain unconditionally loyal to only me. Understand?\u201dA flash of light flitted across Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyes. He slowly nodded his head, and in his heart, he actually felt a whole new level of respect for Xu ZiYan.Loyalty to Xu family and loyalty to Xu ZiYan were two entirely different concepts. Because Xu ZiYan was only a part of Xu family, if one day in the future people wanted to sacrifice Xu ZiYan for the benefit of Xu family, those Xu branch family children wouldn\u2019t support him.Only those people who have been personally cultivated by Xu ZiYan would have enough loyalty to him. This was very much in line with Xu ZiRong\u2019s own thinking.In reality, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t do much. He only gave that head chef named Luo some hope. He promised to provide Mister Luo a chance to test to see if he had any spiritual veins.Being a slave from Xu family, Xu ZiYan gave him a chance to change his destiny. Thus, as long as he was clever enough, he wouldn\u2019t give up this opportunity.After the two brothers returned to Liu Shang Court, they headed toward the martial arts field to practice and cultivate. Although there wasn\u2019t class that day, regardless if it were Xu ZiYan or Xu ZiRong, neither of them would relax.Xu ZiRong\u2019s desire for power already reached the point of a madman\u2019s, and Xu ZiYan, to change the coming future, put in even more pain and effort.On one side there were purple lightning bolts, and on the other, there were blotches of crisp green. The small martial arts field was split into two by the different types of spiritual energy, but from afar it still looked abnormally harmonious.On the next day, the both of them returned to the martial arts training hall to learn. Xu Mo still had the same vicious face, but the other Xu family children\u2019s attitude toward Xu ZiYan began to change, producing some subtle differences.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA month\u2019s time quickly flickered by. Like before, Xu ZiYan was still at the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, while Xu ZiRong made others feel amazed as he extraordinarily reached the second layer of Qi Condensation Stage.For this practically flying upgrade of his, many Xu family elders changed the attitude they had toward him when they were unhappy with his entry into the Xu family. They also became even more polite to Xu Xiao.To have two sons that were this talented, Xu family Master Xu Xiao\u2019s position also became increasingly more stable.But for Xu ZiRong\u2019s performance, Xu Xiao didn\u2019t care about it much. In his perspective, even if Xu ZiRong had innate and high comprehension abilities, his Triple Root Spiritual Vein doomed his cultivation to be extremely slow. Xu family had never lacked low cultivation level cultivators, but only high-end cultivators with talent in combat decided a family\u2019s status.In Xu family, the only person who carried all his hopes was Xu ZiYan. After all, Xu ZiRong was just a bastard child he had reluctantly acknowledged.Like this, Xu ZiRong began to gradually integrate himself into the Xu family, while Xu ZiYan worked hard on one hand and developed his own people on the other.Although\u2014\u2014his people right now only consisted of Mister Luo.After he was tested, Mister Luo very luckily became a cultivator with a Triple Root Spiritual Vein. His spiritual vein wasn\u2019t that good, but for someone who had never thought he could become a cultivator, it was already enough to severely surprise him.Because Mister Luo was not one of Xu family\u2019s children, thus, all his cultivation materials were allocated to him by Xu ZiYan who took some from his own share. Xu ZiYan also did not ask him to immediately reach a superhuman level. In any case, he himself was only twelve years old, so slowly nurturing Mister Luo was completely fine.All affairs went according to each of their intrinsic itineraries as things began to slowly develop. Xu ZiYan\u2019s cultivation was constantly improving, and Xu ZiRong also collected a large amount of essence blood from various demonic beasts in their real-combat tests.In his last life, Xu ZiRong had to control the pace of his cultivation because of the existence of that ball of anger. However, because he had enough experience now in this life, he could absorb the essence blood of the demonic beasts with no misgivings.On the surface, Xu ZiRong was only at the second layer of Qi Condensation Stage. But in reality, he had already reached the fifth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, a level only one step behind Xu ZiYan.On a tranquil night, Xu ZiRong quietly sat on his bed, a drop of bright red rotating in the middle of his palm.This was the essence blood from a demonic beast he had hunted together with Xu ZiYan yesterday, one equal to the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. As long as he could absorb and refine this drop of essence blood, he could enter the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage.Xu ZiRong slowly closed his eyes. The drop of bright red started separating into thin strands that followed his veins and entered his body. When the blood in his body encountered these thin red strands, they started to crazily swallow them and decompose them. After all the energy in the blood was squeezed out, they collected it and brought it to his dantian.A slight crisp sound came from his body. Under Xu ZiRong\u2019s unceasing urging, his dantian was once again expanded to double its previous size. The spiritual energy around him began pouring into his body like crazy, as if his body had suddenly became a spiritual energy black hole.The whole room was emptied of its spiritual energy. Xu ZiRong flipped his wrist, showing the pretty but lower-grade spiritual rock he was holding in his hand. He already placed a spiritual array spell in this room. As long as it was activated, none of the spiritual energy fluctuations inside the room would be noticed by anyone outside.The spiritual energy of a lower-grade spiritual rock was quickly drained as it broke into a pile of dust. Xu ZiRong slowly opened his eyes, a flash of blood-red passing through them.The sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage!He lowered his head before clenching his fist and then releasing it again. This feeling of increasing his power really felt too great!Xu ZiRong stood up and exercised a bit. \u2018Crack crack crack\u2019 were the crisp sounds that came from his body. Every time a cultivator raised his cultivation, his physical body also got refined. In addition, for the people who practiced the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, not only do they refine their body but they could even compress their spiritual energy into their blood.With Xu ZiRong\u2019s current cultivation, although he wouldn\u2019t be their opponent if it was a frontal confrontation, with Blood Sea Heart Sutra\u2019s special characteristics he was now capable of killing early Foundation Establishment cultivators in a sneak attack.After calculating the time it took him to break through, Xu ZiRong\u2019s face changed slightly. Originally, he had thought that one shichen would have been enough for him to break through into the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. However, he would never have imagined that the purity of the spiritual energy in that drop of blood was so high. Not only did he break into the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, but he also accumulated an excess of spiritual energy.Originally this would be a good thing, but the fact how the time he had spent breaking through far surpassed his calculations was anything but reassuring.Xu ZiRong took a spiritual rock from his interspatial bag, looking a bit pained. Although because of his relationship with Xu ZiYan meant he didn\u2019t lack any spiritual rocks for cultivating purposes, trying to hide extra rocks from Xu ZiYan was an extremely difficult thing to do.These two rocks were ones he had hidden after spending ridiculous effort. He never thought he would have to use them up so easily just because he broke through.Xu ZiRong led the spiritual energy out of the rock and flooded it indoors. Then, he closed down his array and opened both the door and the windows to allow the spiritual energy inside and outside the room reach an equilibrium.If everything had went according to his original plan, he could easily have just closed down the array and allowed the spiritual energy outside to slowly enter the room. But now, because of the lack of time, he could only use the spiritual rock to fill that spiritual energy deficit.Not long after he had opened the door, Xu ZiYan came in with today\u2019s late-night snack.Because the both of them worked extremely hard as they practiced cultivating, having an extra meal at night became normal. Originally Xu ZiYan could let the cooks in his court prepare the late-night snack, however, Xu ZiRong never had much interest in the things they made.The three meals of the day were all prepared by the kitchen staff. You couldn\u2019t say that they didn\u2019t make those meals well, but the Xu ZiYan who was more used to his modern lifestyle and food liked doing things with his own hands.As a twelve-year old teenager who was in his growing period, the training he did everyday used up a lot of energy. Add onto how he would train more after returning from the martial arts training hall, feeling hungry at night was something extremely normal.As a result, the Young Master of Xu family gained yet another strange habit. That was, at night he would cook another meal for himself to eat.When he first heard about it, Xu Xiao had been surprised for a moment, before he quickly pushed away this matter to the side. Xu ZiYan\u2019s recent hard work was what held the most significance in his eyes. Although he wasn\u2019t very keen on the idea of Xu ZiYan taking the initiative to cook himself, under the conditions where it didn\u2019t impact his cultivation practice, Xu Xiao was still very generous toward this new little hobby.Even the Master didn\u2019t express his opinions, so no one else dared to say anything. Many servants actually felt happy over having less to do, and only the kitchen staff felt always on the edge. They were worried about if it was their own cooking skills that had offended the Young Master.Xu ZiYan had no idea how depressed those cooks felt. Actually, even if he did know, it wasn\u2019t like he could do much about it. He only wanted to satisfy his own tongue and tastebuds. If the others read into his actions that much, it wasn\u2019t anything he could actually control.But there was another reason Xu ZiYan was willing to cook for Xu ZiRong. That reason was, no matter what, Xu ZiRong welcomed anything he made for him.As a fine food cooking lover, meeting someone who wasn\u2019t picky about what he was fed and would in addition gulp down three bowls each meal was practically the same as meeting an intimate friend. Seeing how Xu ZiRong would eat the things Xu ZiYan made himself with giant bites, that kind of feeling was really too beautiful!\u201cI\u2019m full.\u201d Xu ZiRong set down the bowl and rubbed his mouth. The things Xu ZiYan made might not necessarily be extremely delicious, but they all had a flavour of home. For Xu ZiRong who had never experienced that feeling, it made him extremely reluctant to part with it.Even he didn\u2019t understand that he was actually this fond of the warm feeling of home. However, he could instinctively absorb this warm feeling from Xu ZiYan.From Xu ZiYan\u2019s warm hugs, from the food he made him, and from the meticulous care Xu ZiYan had toward him\u2026\u2026Right now, Xu ZiRong was like a greedy beast who was drooling at the warm taste from Xu ZiYan\u2019s body. Only now could he satisfy his need for warmth. But if he realized that this warmth would one day leave him, swallowing it, trapping it, those would remain his only options to retain that warmth!\u201cZiRong, you don\u2019t have to work this hard. Cultivating hard is the right thing to do, but you also have to strike a balance between work and rest. Understand?\u201d Xu ZiYan asked in concern.Xu ZiRong nodded. He did not feel disgraced at all as he acted like a well-behaved eight year old child, and instead completely enjoyed this feeling of being pampered. If he didn\u2019t have to see those Xu family kids who had once bullied him every day, he would have even thought that continuing this peaceful life with Xu ZiYan would be very great.Unfortunately, Mister Blood Demon Lord had always believed that only having enough strength yourself would enable one to fulfill all of their own wishes.Although Xu ZiYan was dead and even his body was possessed by another, Lin XiaoTian, Mo ZiYuan and that Bai Hua. The three of them were still alive. He didn\u2019t see them die tragically yet, so how would Mister Blood Demon Lord be satisfied with a peaceful life?After the two finished their late-night snack, Xu ZiRong took the opportunity to tactfully express to Xu ZiYan how his love for \u2018pink\u2019 had already passed.Previously, Xu ZiYan had still been worrying if the Xu ZiRong who loved pink would become too effeminate, and only now could he relax.He patted Xu ZiRong\u2019s shoulder enthusiastically. \u201cRest assured ZiRong, tomorrow big brother would ask someone to change the colour of your room. What colour do you like?\u201dXu ZiRong smiled. \u201cSomething like big brother\u2019s room would be good.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyes brightened before he asked with a smile: \u201cDoes ZiRong like big brother this much? You even want the decorations of your room to be like mine? Then, wouldn\u2019t it be better to simply live in big brother\u2019s room?\u201dXu ZiRong immediately felt excited. He liked the feeling Xu ZiYan gave him, so wouldn\u2019t living together in close quarters with him also be very great?Unfortunately\u2026\u2026After he thought about it, Xu ZiRong still gave up on the idea. Now that his Blood Sea Heart Sutra cultivation had finally entered the right track, it was better to live separately. If he were to live in the same room with Xu ZiYan, he was worried that he would one day inadvertently reveal something.Seeing Xu ZiRong\u2019s tangled expression, Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter. When Xu ZiYan was younger his home economic conditions wasn\u2019t that good, so he could only share a room with his younger brother. After they switched to a bigger house and when Xu ZiYu learned he could get his own room, he practically flew away like a bird in glee. How could he be like Xu ZiRong, who was actually thinking about the possibility of living together with him?Actually, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t mind sleeping on the same bed as his little brother. On the contrary, Xu ZiRong might be the one who won\u2019t be used to squishing together with someone else. Although it had only been a short month, Xu ZiYan could still notice that though this little brother was very well-behaved and adorable, he was also very independent and won\u2019t be easily affected by others.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What? What many thanks? Thanks for what?He realized after he thought for a moment that Xu ZiRong was thanking him for his invitation to live together.Uh\u2026\u2026Xu ZiYan was startled for a bit before he smiled. He rubbed Xu ZiRong\u2019s head: \u201cIf you want to live there then live there ah, it isn\u2019t a big deal. You can move over there tomorrow.\u201d But though his mouth said this, his heart couldn\u2019t help but say: ZiRong and ZiYu were truly different from each other\u2026\u2026Xu ZiRong slightly squinted his eyes. Although there was a smile on his face, his gaze was lacking a smiling intent. In his small notebook, he silently recorded the thirteenth point in Xu ZiYan\u2019s section. Xu ZiRong could already guess that the Xu ZiYu from before was probably big brother\u2019s past younger brother\u2026\u2026he just didn\u2019t know where his older brother was originally from, and if that bastard called Xu ZiYu was still alive.If he was alive, Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t mind sending him onto the road. Big brother could only be his big brother. No one else was entitled to occupy a position in Xu ZiYan\u2019s heart. Even his original younger brother couldn\u2019t!Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t know Xu ZiRong\u2019s thoughts. The two brothers chatted for a while about cultivation problems before they prepared to rest.But when Xu ZiYan\u2019s feet brought him back to his room, Xu ZiRong boldly followed him back as well.Xu ZiYan looked at him in puzzlement when Xu ZiRong innocently said: \u201cBig brother, it\u2019s already past midnight.\u201dSo, today\u2019s already the tomorrow you were talking about before, right?Xu ZiYan stared at Xu ZiRong with a head full of black lines. Alright, a well-behaved younger brother being naughty occassionally was also cute ah!Silently lifting the corner of his blanket, he left enough space for the other. However, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t realize that every concession he made to Xu ZiRong was the same as writing down these profound words in place of his destiny: to show the wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing into the house\u2026\u2026The two siblings acted as if they were playing follow the leader (a big misconception!) and slept hugging each other. Early the next morning, Xu ZiRong regretted his hot-headed words from last night\u2026\u2026He wore two extremely large dark circles around his eyes as he looked resentfully at the Xu ZiYan who slept so soundly, the other was even drooling. Xu ZiRong\u2019s brain was full of only two words.He was someone with style and grace, even if he was a slightly somewhat deranged blood demon. Last night could be considered, in every kind of way, the first time he had shared a bed with another.Perhaps it was because he had never slept with another person in the same bed before, but it was impossible for him to imagine how a normal person could somersault and thrash around when he was sleeping. Rolling from the top of the bed to the bottom, and then rolling back to the top\u2026\u2026giphyWhat was even more excessive was that the unusual sleeping posture of Xu ZiYan could actually accommodate him. After being retaliated by an angry him (in which he ruthlessly jabbed the other\u2019s rib), the other rolled Xu ZiRong into his blankets in a half-asleep manner and then took him along with him to roll around the bed.Xu ZiRong had absolutely no idea how he should describe his own older brother. Obviously two brothers sleeping together should be a very heart-warming event, so why did it become a disaster when it came to Xu ZiYan?He secretly grinded his teeth and stared hatefully at the big brother who had once again rolled into the blankets. Xu ZiRong secretly swore in his heart that sooner or later, there would be a day where he would also let Xu ZiYan try tasting this kind of flavour. He would also let him experience what it felt like to be hugged by another person before they started rolling around in bed with them! (There seemed to be something wrong with that thought!)Taking a few deep breaths and suppressing the resentment in his heart, Xu ZiRong squeezed out a smiling face before using some force to push Xu ZiYan.\u201cMm\u2026\u2026\u201d The grown-up big brother turned around, covering himself with the blanket and lay sprawled on the bed.Long accustomed to the other\u2019s state when he dawdled in bed, Xu ZiRong had a calm face as he switched directions and continued to push him. \u201cBig brother, if you don\u2019t get up we\u2019ll be late.\u201d\u201cEn\u2026\u2026let\u2019s sleep for a bit longer.\u201d Xu ZiYan turned around again as well.Xu ZiRong continued to expressionlessly jab the blanket roll on the bed until he was suddenly at his wits\u2019 end. He suddenly tore open the blankets and glowered at the other. \u201cBig brother, get up.\u201dXu ZiYan scratched his head, finally seeming to be awakened from his half-asleep state. He embarrassedly patted Xu ZiRong on the shoulders and said: \u201cZiRong, I made you work hard.\u201dXu ZiRong nodded his head as if he didn\u2019t mind it. Towards Xu ZiYan\u2019s peculiar sleeping habit, he already thoroughly understood it.The Xu ZiYan who woke up immediately restored his able and efficient big brother image. He washed up and took care of his affairs in an extremely short period of time before he pulled Xu ZiRong toward the martial arts field.Today was the day they granted gifts and resources. In addition to this, they would also reward the Xu family children based on their performances.Xu ZiYan managed to break through into the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage because of his moment of insight. According to the Xu family rules, he would be granted the right to enter the library.Actually, there weren\u2019t many books in the library that could be used by Lightning Vein users. In addition, he had already learned the ones that were there with the help of his memories.However, if Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t find a legitimate way to enter the library, he wouldn\u2019t dare to actually use and expose those martial art moves. That kind of thing where one secretly stole and learned the library\u2019s secrets, even if he was the family Master\u2019s son, he would still be punished.This time, as long as he had the chance to go in, he could pick a suitable martial arts book. This way, even if he encountered some danger in the future, he wouldn\u2019t be so badly off that he would become unable to do anything.Thunder Jolt was but one of the most basic lightning martial art techniques. He had already discovered the last time he entered the forest that this martial art technique\u2019s control over lightning spiritual power was way too crude and basic. If one was not careful, they would release all the spiritual power in their body just like what he had done last time. As a result, the lethality of the attack would of course increase. But if you did not defeat your opponent, then the consequences would be extremely terrible.Xu ZiYan pondered over which martial arts book he should pick, but he did not know that the Xu ZiRong beside him was also wondering if he should tell Xu ZiYan the existence of that lightning martial arts book.If this person was still the original Xu ZiYan, no matter how good he was to him, Xu ZiRong still wouldn\u2019t do something to increase the strength of his enemy. But since the other was here by possessing Xu ZiYan, he also lost any reasons for his hostility.Xu ZiRong saw things very clearly. This person was truly very good to him and loved him as his little brother. Perhaps some of it was because of Xu ZiYan\u2019s feelings for \u2018ZiYu\u2019, but Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t care about that at all. Sooner or later, one day he would murder that guy called Xu ZiYu and monopolize Xu ZiYan. Big brother could only be his big brother!Increasing the enemy\u2019s power was something Xu ZiRong wouldn\u2019t do, but helping his own big brother was a completely different story.He had the memories of his previous life. Last life, Xu ZiRong had deliberately made trouble for Xu ZiYan, but unfortunately that bastard\u2019s luck was pretty good and he escaped many times. He also learned from other people that although Xu ZiYan had encountered a lot of danger, the other was at most seriously wounded and never lost his life.The original Xu ZiYan had really good luck, but that might not be the case for the big brother who possessed him. Xu ZiRong \u2018loved\u2019 this elder brother now and enjoyed the other\u2019s pampering and adoration. Naturally, he didn\u2019t wish for the other to meet any unfortunate situations\u2026\u2026so with things like this, enhancing Xu ZiYan\u2019s strength became his top priority.After all, although Xu ZiRong had the confidence that he would be able to restore his previous power in the future, currently he didn\u2019t have the confidence to protect Xu ZiYan.If it was like that\u2026\u2026then there was no harm in giving the other that martial arts book. In any case, the speed of his cultivation using the Blood Sea Heart Sutra did not lose out to Xu ZiYan\u2019s Lightning Heavenly Spiritual Vein. Adding on the experience he had accumulated in his last life, Xu ZiRong was confident that the other party completely didn\u2019t stand a chance in escaping from his grasp.As long as he had the strength, if he wanted Xu ZiYan to become his big brother, then Xu ZiYan must take that role and be his older brother!Tidying up his emotions, Xu ZiRong pretended to carelessly mention how during his last visit to the martial arts book library, he encountered a Wood Element Supporting Arts martial arts book and felt his fingers turn numb. Xu ZiRong then \u2018accidentally\u2019 revealed how it was only after he saw Xu ZiYan fight did he realize that the Wood Element Arts book was probably not for the Wood Element Arts.\u201cA book with a Lightning martial arts technique recorded?\u201d Xu ZiYan suddenly straightened his ears.After the library was destroyed by Xu ZiRong\u2019s hands, the original Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t find any Lightning martial art books. Actually, he was afraid to say that there was probably no one in Xu family who knew about it.After all, in this life, the martial arts Xu ZiYan studied was from a book retrieved from Liu Guang Sect. If there were Lightning martial art books in their library, then Xu Xiao would never pay such a heavy price to go to Liu Guang Sect only to bring back something that was not good enough to be high quality, nor bad enough to be considered low-level.Interest ignited by Xu ZiRong, Xu ZiYan began to look forward to that martial arts book. Although he still wasn\u2019t too sure about how he could evaluate a martial art book\u2019s grade, it was certain that anything capable of conducting Lightning spiritual energy wasn\u2019t some commonplace item.\u201cZiRong really is my lucky star!\u201d Xu ZiYan said with a face full of smiles.Xu ZiRong smiled gently, seemingly slightly embarrassed as he lowered his head.When the two brothers arrived at the martial arts training hall, Xu Mo still hung a dead look on his face. Although his opinions of Xu ZiYan this Young Master had changed a lot, Xu Mo didn\u2019t know why but he still felt the other was displeasing to his eyes.Because there wasn\u2019t any training scheduled for today, there were only the matters of testing everyone\u2019s cultivation and calculating their accomplishments. But although there were many children there, it only took about one hour for the tasks to be done.Undoubtedly, Xu ZiYan, the one who raised his cultivation to the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage using a moment of insight, was the one with the most achievements. Converting those merits, it was enough for him to enter the library once.The rest of the teenage boys directed gazes filled with envy at him. These youngsters could only go into the library to choose their favourite martial art techniques once for free the first time they entered the martial arts training hall. Afterwards, if they wanted to learn other martial art skills, they had to work hard to raise their cultivation. Only then could they convert their achievements to obtain the eligibility to enter the library.If one just tried raising their cultivation one step at a time, the speed they would receive merits and achievements would be extremely slow. But if they used spiritual rocks or pellet medicine to raise their cultivating speed, those things also required the same amount of merits to obtain. In short, entering the library was not an easy thing to do. Unless one made a sudden and huge breakthrough like Xu ZiYan, they could do nothing more but dream and sigh about it.After the martial arts training hall class finished for the day, Xu ZiYan followed Xu Mo with Xu ZiRong toward the library in high spirits.The Old Luo who sat in front of the library door was quietly meditating. When he saw Xu ZiRong and Xu ZiYan coming, he gave the two a smile.After Xu ZiYan entered the library he quickly found that particular martial arts jade book. That seemingly humble book sat quietly on the shelf, a layer of dust blanketing it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had originally thought that in accordance with the normal development of the storyline, he could possess stronger moves only after he had entered the Liu Guang Sect. He had not expected to find this good thing so much earlier.Yes, Xu ZiYan was fully capable of recognizing that the martial arts technique recorded in that jade book was at least a high-grade one. It could even be one of the best. Not because of the technique itself, but it was because he recognized the jade book used to record the martial arts.Don\u2019t look at how gloomy this jade book seemed to be. Although it looked as if it was inferior goods, in reality it was Xuan Yu\u2019s exceedingly rare Dark Light Jade. It could even be said that it was priceless, and that won\u2019t be just an exaggeration.This type of jade possessed an extraordinarily large carrying capacity, and all of the high-grade martial art skills had a lot of energy. So, this Dark Light Jade was the perfect object to record those skills and their energy.In other words, although not all high-grade martial art techniques were recorded on Dark Light Jade, any technique recorded on it would at least be something above upper-ranked skills.Holding that Dark Light Jade, it was difficult for Xu ZiYan to control his excitement. Although he already knew the concept of how being strong was the way to protect everything in his old life, this idea was even more prominent in the cultivation world. If one wasn\u2019t strong, even their life couldn\u2019t be guaranteed\u2026\u2026_(:\u0437\u300d\u2220)_What killing to steal treasures, what killing to silence someone, what killing for revenge\u2026\u2026in short, murdering people here was truly a simple matter.Xu ZiYan did not want to die. He also didn\u2019t want to live a life like the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s. Even if in that life he didn\u2019t die, things like sharing his lover and abusing children, he really couldn\u2019t accept it.If one didn\u2019t want to die then naturally they wanted to live. The safest way for someone to live here was of course just being stronger than everyone else. In order to achieve that goal, Xu ZiYan was much more hardworking when he cultivated compared to the original Xu ZiYan. This was because the original him had encountered many lucky opportunities with Bai Hua, and even more lucky breaks that helped him escape life-threatening situations because of Bai Hua. However, since Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t intend to follow Bai Hua in this life, he could of course only rely on himself.Touching that jade book, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t feel the painful tingling Xu ZiRong had felt. He wiped the dust off the top of the book before entering a strand of his soul into it.After the same action, Xu ZiRong\u2019s soul strand was crushed into smithereens. However, Xu ZiYan absolutely did not have that misgiving. Within the jade book was a world made out of crazy thunder and lightning, but Xu ZiYan\u2019s soul strand was capable of detecting a friendly feeling.\u201cSo it was like that\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu ZiYan opened his eyes. The gaze he used to look at the jade book was subtle.It turned out that this jade book was left behind by a Xu family cultivator who had a Lightning Spiritual Vein. However, he wasn\u2019t a Xu family cultivator from their family, but a Xu family main branch member from a huge region thousands of years ago.Within that large region, the Xu Family\u2019s main family was also an extraordinarily large cultivation clan. The family even had a Mahayana stage old ancestor1, and there was a greater number of cultivators with Nascent Soul cultivation as well. Thus, they could be regarded as one of the most powerful families in that region.If the family was big, naturally there would be a lot of branch families as well. However, some weaker branch families did not receive enough support in the family, and thus had no other choice but to go out and seek other opportunities in the region.The Xu family of today was created by one of the Xu family members of that time. He had been on bad terms with one of the main branch disciples and could only leave indignantly. Afterwards, he wandered into the Xuan Yu region and set down his roots, which gradually developed into the Xu family of today.And this jade book was precisely a gift that cultivator had received from a close friend. Just, nobody would know how it got placed in the library, or how it came to be considered a low-level Wood Supporting Arts.Xu ZiYan thought back for a moment. The original him never met anyone from what was considered the actual main branch from that Xu family. However, that made sense. The setting of that novel only consisted of Xuan Yu region. After all, most of the content was about a man named Bai Hua, and how he had gracefully and elegantly took over the whole Xuan Yu region. And then with a type of \u2018universal love\u2019 attitude, he hooked up with the most powerful men in Xuan Yu. Finally, he slaughtered the final BOSS who was the only one not seduced by him\u2014\u2014that kind of small yellow book!Yes, that was Xu ZiYan\u2019s review of the novel. In his opinion, the plot of that novel and any tasks that happened were all fleeting. Everything that happened seemed to be a service to Bai Hua. All the treasures he obtained seemed to only have the use of making him more attractive, thus making it easier for him to lure men to himself.Oh right, he had forgotten to say that other than the three fixed main leads, there were still X number of men who had loved Bai Hua. They were even willing to die for him. When Bai Hua and his gang attacked the Blood Demon Lord\u2019s palace, even the Blood Demon\u2019s general became moved by Bai Hua\u2019s \u2018innocence and kindness\u2019. He actually released him from the dungeon before cooperating with Lin XiaoTian and the rest of the gang. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have been so easy for them to enter the Blood Demon Lord\u2019s lair.As Bai Hua \u2018reformed\u2019 the Blood Demon Lord\u2019s general, the two had an episode on a bed. If it wasn\u2019t for how the general had died later under the Blood Demon\u2019s hands, perhaps he would have became the book\u2019s fourth little male lead.Toward this novel\u2019s terrible and melodramatic plot, Xu ZiYan just wanted to go \u2018haha\u2019. However, this jade book just reminded him that if he isn\u2019t able to live well in the Xuan Yu region, he could always think of something and go to another area to live.Although Bai Hua did become quite powerful by the end of the novel, he only dominated the Xuan Yu region. Since he had already decided to not follow them, whether the rest of the three would get powerful to that degree was truly food for thought.In any case, it was just a few words. If he couldn\u2019t beat them then couldn\u2019t he still run? If this world was truly modeled on the one in the novel and if he brought Xu ZiRong beyond the novel setting boundaries, he didn\u2019t believe that Bai Hua would be able to kill Xu ZiRong once again.As he held that jade book, Xu ZiYan suddenly began to hesitate. If he just took out that jade book like this, it could be estimated that Xu family would for sure find out about it. Actually, he didn\u2019t mind sharing this martial arts technique with the Xu family. However, just looking at this book told someone it wasn\u2019t a commonplace good. Even if Xu family didn\u2019t have any other cultivators with the lightning spiritual vein, it would be impossible for them to give this jade book to him. Instead, they would put this jade book into that treasure room and then engrave a copy for him to use.Xu ZiYan did not want to cultivate using a copy. Although there wouldn\u2019t be any problems with the copied techniques, it wouldn\u2019t be like the martial arts engraved on the Dark Light Jade. Not only did it have the techniques, but it also had that cultivator\u2019s imprint.Although this imprint was not that strong, Xu ZiYan could go into the Dark Light Jade book and have that imprint take a humanoid shape. He could then cultivate with the imprint as a guide. That would create incalculable effects for his understanding of the Nine Changes of Violet Heaven.As Xu ZiYan held that Dark Light Jade, strands of lightning spiritual energy that escaped from it began entering his body. When Xu ZiYan realized what was happening, he became even more reluctant to hand that book in.The lightning spiritual energy of this jade would gradually transform his body. Currently he was just a twelve year old teenager, one still in the process of growing up. Over time, his body would be able to hold more spiritual energy as he broke through different cultivation realms. If people had the same cultivation level but he had more spiritual energy; what that represented was self-explanatory.Playing with the jade book in his hands in a manner that suggested how he loved it too much to part with it, Xu ZiYan frowned worriedly. Although he was the disciple with the best talent in the Xu family, this type of thing was not something he could have. He actually wanted to steal it, but the Old Luo at the door wasn\u2019t some vegetarian. If people said he was only there to guard the door, others could believe it, but Xu ZiYan absolutely didn\u2019t believe something like that.\u201cWhat should I do ah\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu ZiYan lightly rubbed his right hand\u2019s thumb and forefinger together. This was his habit. Whenever he found himself in a difficult situation that needed to be solved, he would unconsciously perform this action.Time passed bit by bit, but the time he could spend in the library was limited. Though the time he had to leave by was nearing, Xu ZiYan still hadn\u2019t found a way to bring out the book without being detected by Old Luo.There was simply no need to mention the interspatial bags. With his cultivation, even if Old Luo didn\u2019t dig out everything in his bag, he would still be able to find it.Hiding it on Xu ZiYan\u2019s body was even more like a joke. In reality, in front of Golden Core cultivators and as a child with cultivation at merely the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, he really didn\u2019t have the ability to hide secrets.His brow wrinkled and became increasingly more tight. Xu ZiYan almost could not help but raise his face toward the sky and hiss: obviously after transmigrating he should have gotten a golden finger! So why didn\u2019t he have anything?midas-touch-mahtab-hannaUh\u2026\u2026Golden finger?!Both of Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyes brightened. \u56e7\u56e7 He spiritedly watched that thing that had been suspended in front of him from beginning to end and had always been ignored by him \u2014\u2014 the floating room.Cough cough\u2026\u2026Xu ZiYan felt a bit ashamed. He had always felt that his golden finger was a waste and didn\u2019t have much use. And this thing had been unfailingly floating in front of him. At first he hadn\u2019t been used to it, but after he did get used to it he would automatically hide it. That was why, for a moment, he had completely forgotten he actually had this thing.Silently placing the jade book inside, Xu ZiYan\u2019s heart apologized to the floating room. So sorry, Brother Golden Finger. My sense of your existence is way too low, in the future you must exercise more to strengthen it ah!(Floating room: \u2026\u2026)Toward this floating box, Xu ZiYan kind of knew what he was doing. After all, it had been this long since he transmigrated, but nobody ever realized he had a floating cube right in front of him.Right now, there was only a novel that would make a dog go blind and that Dark Light Jade within the floating room, though\u2026\u2026Xu ZiYan rubbed his chin. Was his eyes playing tricks on him? Because he used to habitually ignore this floating room, today he carefully examined it. But why did he feel that this floating room\u2026\u2026became bigger?Forget about it, why would he care about that? It was only a floating room like this, so even if it became bigger, what could you fit into it? After he became stronger in the future, he would naturally be able to buy interspatial rooms that could guard its contents from other cultivators and the like. When that time came, this floating room would probably become something that was of little value.Xu ZiYan took out a jade book from his interspatial space and placed it in the Dark Light Jade\u2019s original space. He even carefully blew a layer of dust onto it. This jade book had been there so long without anyone finding it, which only goes to show how few people came over to this area. Currently he had just swapped one book, but he wasn\u2019t afraid of people finding it. After all, almost all the people who could enter this library were Xu family children. Even if someone found this empty jade book, at most they would think that something had gone wrong during the engraving process.Cleaning up the traces he had left behind, Xu ZiYan once again selected a Wood Supporting Arts jade book. The technique recorded in that jade book was one that allowed someone to extract the essence of plants in order to heal someone. Paired with Silent Running Rain, this would increase Xu ZiRong\u2019s ability to heal by a bit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen he saw how Xu ZiYan chose a Wood Element Supporting Arts book, Old Luo\u2019s expression looked somewhat amazed. He didn\u2019t expect that Xu ZiYan would actually dote on Xu ZiRong to this degree, for him to even give Xu ZiRong this opportunity Xu ZiYan had received with much difficulty.However, Old Luo\u2019s expression quickly returned to normal. The only reason he stayed here was merely for the purpose of guarding Xu family\u2019s foundation. As for these affairs among the younger generation, it had absolutely nothing to do with him.The gaze Xu Mo used to look at Xu ZiYan was extremely strange. He couldn\u2019t understand no matter how much he thought about it. Where exactly did that formally arrogant and despotic Young Master go? Although the previous Xu ZiYan did not reach the degree where he had no concern for others, for him to be this generous and for him to give out that kind of opportunity \u2026\u2026 it was really quite unfathomable. Thus, Xu Mo could only use his hair-rising gaze to stare at Xu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong\u2019s fingertips, switching his line-of-sight back and forth.On the other hand, Xu ZiRong was rather calm. This was because he thought Xu ZiYan must have chosen that jade book, the one that emitted berserk rays of thunder and lightning power.Only\u2026\u2026Xu ZiRong\u2019s gaze became slightly dark. To be capable of concealing this from Old Luo\u2019s inspection, it seemed that his own \u2018big brother\u2019 had a lot more secrets he had not yet discovered.Completely unaware of how he had exposed something about himself in front of Xu ZiRong, Xu ZiYan very happily gave Xu ZiRong a meaningful glance. Afterwards, the two of them returned to the Liu Shang Courtyard.With how they were currently living together combined with how Xu ZiRong had been the one to inform him about this jade book\u2019s existence in the first place, Xu ZiYan completely didn\u2019t think much about it. It was only until after he had brought Xu ZiRong back to their room when he realized\u2014\u2014how was he supposed to take this thing out ah?He couldn\u2019t just make a jade book appear out of thin air right in front of Xu ZiRong, now could he?\u201cBig brother, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Xu ZiRong pretended to be puzzled as he asked the older boy.It only took Xu ZiRong one look at Xu ZiYan\u2019s expression for him to deduce that the other must be feeling troubled over how he was supposed to take that jade book out. A trick that was able to keep a Golden Core Elder in the dark, you didn\u2019t even need to think to know that Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t want to expose it in front of himself.However, Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t intend to let Xu ZiYan off. He was not fond of how there was something he couldn\u2019t control on Xu ZiYan\u2019s body, especially in the current situation where he was extremely satisfied with this \u2018big brother\u2019. Nothing unexpected was permitted!Xu ZiRong pretended to look innocent as he steadily stared at the other boy. In addition, his pair of pitch-black eyes glistened in a shiny manner, making the Xu ZiYan who was looking at him feel embarrassed to keep concealing it from the younger.Xu ZiYan thought for a moment before he coughed twice. \u201cZiRong, ah, have you seen someone do magic tricks before?\u201dXu ZiRong: \u2026\u2026Xu ZiYan continued to use that sort of \u2018really hoping he\u2019ll say no\u2019 gaze to stare at him. Thus, Xu ZiRong could only hem and haw as he mumbled, \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great! Big brother can show you one, is that alright? First, close your eyes,\u201d Xu ZiYan was really satisfied with his own little brother\u2019s previous words. Having an obedient child was really too great! ZiRong was really much more lovable compared to that bear child ZiYu!Xu ZiRong: \u2026..Although his reasoning had been terribly childish, when Xu ZiYan looked at him with that kind of face, Xu ZiRong felt as if he was powerless to refute.What magic trick\u2026\u2026to bring up this sort of small joke to someone who had previously neared Mahayana stage cultivation, are you really not deliberating trying to humiliate him??(Something was written on the little mental notebook once again.)Xu ZiRong silently raised his hand to cover his eyes. They were dark but had a hint of stealthiness, and soon they began to glisten and shine in between his fingers.Xu ZiYan: \u2026\u2026A bear child like this surely isn\u2019t my darling little brother!!! _(:\u0437\u300d\u2220)_Silently swallowing a mouthful of old blood, Xu ZiYan stiffened his face before he placed both of his hands onto Xu ZiRong\u2019s shoulders\u2026\u2026and then he slowly and firmly turned the other boy around.Xu ZiRong: \u2026\u2026Big brother, is it really alright for you to deceive yourself like this??!!!Toward Xu ZiYan\u2019s shameless action, Xu ZiRong actually found it to be quite novel. He never expected that this seemingly steady and mature older brother would actually be this shameless to him, an eight year old child\u2026\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d By the time Xu ZiRong turned around, Xu ZiYan had already taken that jade book out. To be honest, taking that jade book out was a simple and quick affair. It was just that having something suddenly appear out of thin air was kind of frightening.In reality, Xu ZiYan was completely capable of using a random magical artefact or tool in order to make a more convincing lie. After all, Xu ZiRong was merely a child who had just begun cultivating, and thus he wouldn\u2019t be able to understand much. However, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t wish to deceive his own younger brother, especially someone like Xu ZiRong who was especially sensitive.Regarding Xu ZiRong\u2019s personality, perhaps the other wouldn\u2019t know he was lying right now. However, if he became aware of it in the future, this would for sure become a scar on his heart.Thus, Xu ZiYan would rather use a shameless method than tell Xu ZiRong a lie. In this way, even if Xu ZiRong realized something in the future, at most he would just feel some helplessness.He shared the information stored in this jade book that he had previously found out with Xu ZiRong. Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t count on having an eight year old child being capable of analyzing this information, he simply wanted to share this matter with the other boy.Although he lived in Xu family, there wasn\u2019t anyone in the whole family who was his good friend. The kids who used to revolve by Xu ZiYan\u2019s side to flatter him had all been alienated by him in the past month, and the ones left over were just some children in their teens. As an old man, wanting to find someone to talk to was really as difficult as a mountain was big.Xu ZiYan also didn\u2019t ask Xu ZiRong to give him advice. He merely wanted to find someone who he could tell a few secrets to, and Xu ZiRong indeed lived up to his expectations. Although he was only eight years old, Xu ZiRong acted quite mature the majority of the time. Furthermore, his personality was quite lovable and clever. He was easily able to satisfy Xu ZiYan\u2019s \u2018good older brother\u2019 mentality as a little brother, and thus was practically the best choice for Xu ZiYan\u2019s listener.After he took out that jade book, Xu ZiYan planned to start cultivating. This Nine Changes of Violet Heaven was exceptionally marvellous. He had only peeked into it a bit in the library but even that was enough for him to sense its power. Just, examining it in the library had been far too inconvenient. However, now that he was unhindered, of course Xu ZiYan was going to try it out.The two brothers stood very close together, with their shoulders practically sticking side by side. Xu ZiYan\u2019s soul had just entered the book when he heard the Xu ZiRong beside him let out a cry.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Xu ZiYan opened his eyes and became immediately gobsmacked. The clothing on Xu ZiRong\u2019s left shoulder had already became ashes, exposing fair and white skin.Xu ZiRong was also bewildered. Just then, Xu ZiYan obviously didn\u2019t do anything. However, that jade book suddenly shot out a ray of lightning. If it wasn\u2019t how he had reacted quickly, it wouldn\u2019t have only been his clothes that had been damaged. No, Xu ZiRong was afraid that even half his arm would have been wounded.After he told Xu ZiYan what had just happened, the other boy suddenly began to look anxious and miserable. He knew that lightning attributed martial arts were usually overbearing and strong, but he had never heard of some kind of secret technique where there couldn\u2019t even be spectators whilst he was cultivating.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter big brother, it\u2019ll be fine if I just leave,\u201d Xu ZiRong very considerately said.Without a better idea, Xu ZiYan could only agree. However, he did not know that this was exactly Xu ZiRong\u2019s desire. Originally, he had still been distressed about how he couldn\u2019t avoid Xu ZiYan to cultivate, but he never expected that the opportunity would bump into him itself. Xu ZiRong could pretend to be generous and give Xu ZiYan enough space, conveniently exchanging his willingness for some of Xu ZiYan\u2019s guilt. In addition, he could now seize this opportunity and go to the mountain rear to properly temper himself.Normally, Xu ZiYan protected him too tightly. Besides the time they used to sleep, Xu ZiRong practically had no other time to practice the Blood Sea Heart Sutra. But now, things would change. Xu ZiRong was now able to openly go into the forest to hunt.Leaving a message for Xu ZiYan, Xu ZiRong cheerfully left in the direction of the mountain rear. The place he selected was a mountain range that sat on the periphery of the forest. The demon beasts inside were mostly at the first or second layer of Qi Condensation Stage, and the ones with the highest cultivation were no more than the third layer of Qi Condensation Stage. It was perfect for his \u2018second layer of Qi Condensation Stage\u2019 cultivation level.Actually, this destinatio wasn\u2019t something he could have changed. Unless he was with Xu ZiYan, he wouldn\u2019t have any other opportunities to enter the deeper part of the forest. Though he had wanted to use the essence blood of stronger demon beasts to cultivate, Xu ZiRong was currently pretending to have cultivation at the second level of Qi Condensation Stage. If he accidentally showed too much strength, then that would be bad.Thus, Xu ZiRong intended to use quantity to win. For the low-level demon beasts on that mountain range, it was as if they had unluckily met misfortune. The whole mountain was basically swept clean by Xu ZiRong, as though a blizzard had passed through and turned the place barren\u2026\u2026The essence blood of low-level demon beasts wasn\u2019t capable of helping Xu ZiRong much, so he had to refine it before using it. Although originally, the blood he had collected from all the beasts he had killed on the mountain amounted to the size of a fist, after Xu ZiRong refined it, all that was left was a single drop.As he stared at the droplet of blood spinning on his fingertips, Xu ZiRong frowned slightly. The number of times he could slaughter low-level beasts without restraint like he had just done previously couldn\u2019t happen too many times, otherwise it would be easy for Xu family to notice something amiss.Just, this efficiency\u2026\u2026His eyebrows scrunching up more and more, Xu ZiRong could only sigh helplessly. His plan of using essence blood to quickly restore his cultivation was impossible now. Unless he was capable of attacking a Golden Core cultivator in a short period of time, it was still better to stay low-key.In reality, with his current strength, it was completely possible for him to break away from Xu family and cultivate by himself. When he was strong enough, he could return then to exterminate the Xu family. However, for once, he was actually hesitating, because he hated the thought of parting with Xu ZiYan, that big brother of his.Xu ZiRong felt that these days with his friendly elder brother and him, a respectful younger brother, were very good and satisfactory. Although Xu family\u2019s other people were still that irksome, for the sake of his big brother\u2019s face, Xu ZiRong could tolerate the existence of those people.Letting out a slightly annoyed sigh, Xu ZiRong casually grabbed a passing demon beast and crushed it into a blood splatter. Only then did the irritability in his heart decrease a bit.Forget it. It was but a few years time, he could still afford to wait. Three years later, his big brother would enter the Liu Guang Sect. In his last life, Xu ZiRong had escaped Xu family before Xu ZiYan left, but in this life, he didn\u2019t intend to part with his big brother.This was also good. If his power increased too much, Xu ZiRong was afraid that he wouldn\u2019t get the chance to enter Liu Guang Sect with his older brother. Until Xu ZiRong had the ability to suppress all those who hindered him from staying with his brother, he could only silently endure.Fortunately, although Xu ZiRong lacked almost everything in his last life, the only thing he wasn\u2019t lacking was his patience. His big brother was the only person he had met in both lives who made him feel warmth. For this person, Xu ZiRong was willing to make some concessions.Of course, his big brother also had to pay a price.As for the details of that price? In the future, they could slowly discuss that\u2026\u2026After he refined that drop of essence blood into his body, Xu ZiRong returned to the Liu Shang Courtyard. Since he had already decided to slow down his cultivation speed, then it was better for him to focus more on his Wood Element Supporting Arts techniques. With Blood Sea Heart Sutra as his foundation, his cultivation speed wouldn\u2019t be much slower than Xu ZiYan\u2019s. If Xu ZiRong wanted to cover up the fact of how he was practicing Blood Sea Heart Sutra, then he required another type of martial arts to conceal it.Before, he had only casually picked the Wood Element Supporting Arts. However, now that he thought about it, the Wood Element Supporting Arts was really his best choice.When he returned to Liu Shang Courtyard, Xu ZiYan was still cultivating. Because he had previously made an order, no one dared to go near his bedroom. When Xu ZiRong saw this, of course he wouldn\u2019t go to deliberately look for some abuse. Instead, he simply went to the martial arts training field in their backyard and found a corner to begin practicing the technique he had just received: \u2018Tempering Wood Secrets\u2019.At the same time, within Xu ZiYan\u2019s bedroom, thin strands of purple lightning would flood the entire room every now and then. Xu ZiYan wasn\u2019t harmed despite standing in the middle of that thunder storm, however, he would sometimes reveal a pained expression on his face.purplelightningBecause of different reasons, the two of them had devoted all of their energy into cultivating. Perhaps the people themselves didn\u2019t realize, but their firm drive moved the wind of the entire Xu family\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTime flowed like water. Therefore, three years\u2019 time passed in a flash. In a blink of an eye, Liu Guang Sect\u2019s widespread disciple recruiting day came.Although Xu family was affiliated with Liu Guang Sect and could enjoy a certain degree of preferential treatment, their children still could not be directly taken in. However, with Xu ZiYan\u2019s natural talent, being accepted as an inner sect disciple was simply not a problem. If he was lucky, it was even possible for him to become some Elder\u2019s or perhaps the Sect Leader\u2019s Succeeding Disciple.After three years of cultivating, Xu ZiYan\u2019s astonishing perseverance and innate talent allowed him to successfully finish cultivating the Qi Condensation Stage in just three short years. With his age being only fifteen years old, even if he possessed the Lightning Heavenly Spiritual Vein, his achievements were already enough to prove his hard work.Regardless of which Sect, they all favoured disciples who worked hard. And for someone like Xu ZiYan who had both godly innate talent and who was willing to bear hardships, their attitude toward him would be self-explanatory.But in the time of three years, if one said that Xu ZiYan\u2019s improvement was surprising, then the speed Xu ZiRong\u2019s cultivation increased at simply made everyone astonished.At the eighth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, the gap between finishing Qi Condensation Stage was merely two layers. Moreover, Xu ZiRong was a child who had been in contact with cultivating for only three years.When he saw how Xu ZiRong had this talent, Xu Xiao felt some rare regret. Back then, if he had brought this child back earlier, would there be two Xu family children participating in the disciple recruitment who had finished cultivating the Qi Condensation Stage?Apart from that, what also made Xu Xiao feel a bit regretful was that, perhaps because of his original neglect; Xu ZiRong practically didn\u2019t have any feelings for him. Normally, when the two met Xu ZiRong would only lightly call him \u2018Father\u2019 once. Their relationship was only slightly better than what one would expect to be between two strangers.Xu Xiao did not like Xu ZiRong. Although Xu ZiRong was also his son, every time he saw the other\u2019s dark eyes with hidden depths, he would always feel inexplicably unhappy. That pair of eyes were too dark and profound, Xu Xiao would always feel the illusion that Xu ZiRong hated him, this father of his.Fortunately, although this brat didn\u2019t have any strong relationships with anyone in Xu family including himself, Xu ZiRong extremely loved sticking to his older brother. As long as someone wasn\u2019t blind, they would be able to see that the relationship between this pair of brothers was practically more intimate than what one would be between two completely blood-related siblings.The only thing that made Xu Xiao feel dissatisfied was that Xu ZiYan was really too good to that brat. He was so good to him that even Xu Xiao, their father, felt a bit uncomfortable.But no matter what, Xu ZiYan was Xu family\u2019s child. It was impossible for him to do anything to harm the Xu family. In addition, that brat was very dependant on Xu ZiYan. Thus, Xu Xiao didn\u2019t feel many misgivings about sending both of them to the Liu Guang Sect.In reality, Xu Xiao\u2019s mindset was correct. Perhaps Xu ZiYan felt some disdain for Xu Xiao\u2019s misdeeds and conduct, but he still genuinely and earnestly accepted the other\u2019s nurturing. And for his thoughts toward the whole Xu family, though Xu ZiYan could not regard the family as intimately as his family before he had transmigrated, he didn\u2019t hate it either.Nowadays, Xu ZiYan had already acknowledged and approved of how he belonged to the Xu family. As long as the Xu family doesn\u2019t betray him, he would do everything within his capabilities to protect the family\u2019s growth.As the Liu Guang Sect recruiting day neared, Xu Xiao and some branch family Elders held a meeting before selecting ten children from this generation\u2019s martial arts training hall disciples. These ten people were to leave for Liu Guang Sect.However, not everyone were to enter the Liu Guang Sect. Other than Xu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong who were already designated as future Liu Guang Sect disciples, the others would soon part with them to try their chances at the recruiting assessments of other Sects.For example, at the Ying Yue Valley who only accepted female disciples, or perhaps at the Yu Shou Sect who was best at controlling and raising spiritual beasts.The Xu family party who prepared to leave for the disciple recruiting consisted of twelve people. Included among these were the ten disciples and two group leaders. The captain was precisely the Xu Mo who had successfully built his Foundation last year. Nobody knew how the other had attracted Old Luo\u2019s attention and gained his favour, but after Old Luo gave him a few pointers, Xu Mo successfully entered the Foundation Establishment Stage.Xu Mo\u2019s deputy leader was a reticent, middle-aged man. His strength and cultivation was higher than Xu Mo\u2019s, however, he did not like interacting with people. Thus, the captain position of their squad fell onto Xu Mo\u2019s head.In the Xuan Yu region, the most convenient and fast method of travel was by the transmission array. Just within a blink of an eye, one could arrive thousands of miles away. Although the land controlled by Xu family was a bit remote, they still had a transmission array. It was just that the price to use the transmission array was quite costly and thus it was only used when it was necessary. Ordinary, lower-leveled cultivators of the family wouldn\u2019t use it.This time, the twelve-man squad dispatched by the Xu family naturally wouldn\u2019t be miserly about the spiritual rocks needed for this array. Even if Xu family wasn\u2019t a huge cultivation family, it wouldn\u2019t be stingy in situations like this.Within the Xuan Yu region, Liu Guang Sect could be considered as one of the best and most influential Sects. There were tens of thousands of cultivators who would try out for the disciple selection, and among these, more than fifty-percent of them would fail to be chosen. And of the remaining people left over who are chosen, forty-percent of them could only become Outer Sect disciples.It wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that the difference between an Outer Sect disciple and an Inner Sect disciple were literally poles apart. Thus, Xu Xiao didn\u2019t want Xu ZiYan to be despised or laughed at before the child even entered the Sect\u2019s doors.The squad finally set off. After transferring at several stops, the group eventually arrived at the Fa An City protected by the Liu Guang Sect.Fa An City was very big, and it was at least ten times larger than Mo New City. With bright, spacious streets, roads full of walking people, and glittering stores filling up the entire place, the disciples who were already used to the bustling people of Mo New City suddenly felt as if their eyes were going blurry after seeing the colourful Fa An City for the first time.Only Xu ZiYan, who was already used to the hustle and bustle of the cities in the modern time, didn\u2019t feel much for Fa An City compared to Mo New City. Xu ZiRong was also expressionless. He had already seen the flourishing Fa An City in his previous life, and therefore he didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit of excitement.After the dozen people from Xu family walked out of the transmission array, they blanked for a split second because of the bustling of Fa An City. Originally, this was but a trivial matter. However, at all times there would always be a discordant voice\u2026\u2026\u201cYou herd of country bumpkins, don\u2019t block the way,\u201d a sharp and thin voice spoke up behind everyone, one that seemingly carried some evil intentions.Xu ZiYan turned around to take a look. Within the transmission array stood a bit over ten cultivators who wore the same golden-coloured chang paos.1383630549Golden chang paos, or a type of ancient Chinese robes.The person who seemed to be their captain was a teenager who was Xu ZiYan\u2019s age. That person\u2019s expression was very cold, and the gaze he used to look at Xu ZiYan and his group made it seem as if they didn\u2019t exist.The one who had spoken was the middle-aged man who had stood behind that teenager. Xu ZiYan was unable to see through his cultivation level, but, from the other\u2019s sharp voice and his over-emphasized chin, Xu ZiYan was able to deduce his identity\u2026\u2026\u201cWhat are you looking at, I\u2019m talking to you guys,\u201d that middle-aged man\u2019s voice sounded arrogant: \u201cQuickly make way for our Young Lord. Wasting our Young Lord\u2019s time, can you guys take responsibility for it?\u201dXu ZiYan frowned slightly. This person\u2019s arrogant attitude was one he really didn\u2019t like. However, following the thought of not making trouble outside his family doors, combined with how they were really in the wrong, Xu ZiYan only rubbed his nose as he backed up a few steps.Upon seeing this, the other Xu family disciples also followed him and backed up a few steps, getting out of the way. That party of people wearing golden chang paos thus walked boldly and ostentatiously in front of the Xu family squad.An episode like this would happen who knows how many times everyday. Xu ZiYan absolutely didn\u2019t care about them. However, the affairs of life were always this coincidental. When they proceeded toward the Liu Guang Sect disciple recruiting reception, they actually met these golden chang pao wearing group once again.Perhaps some people of their group were assigned with finding a residence since their party was smaller than before, but that cold-looking boy and that eunuch was still there.Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t notice them at all. One must apply in person to the Liu Guang Sect\u2019s disciple recruiting assessments, thus, he only brought Xu ZiRong and that reticent middle-aged man with him to sign up.This was the line-up specifically designated for inner sect disciples. Everyone who was capable of being there was extremely confident with their own abilities. However, people like Xu ZiYan with astonishing innate talent was still a minority, so there weren\u2019t many people in the line. Thus, it hadn\u2019t been long before it became his turn to sign up.That cold-looking boy and the eunuch entered the line at this point. Behind Xu ZiYan, there were about seven or eight more squads of people.When that icy and arrogant teenager saw that line that couldn\u2019t be considered to be long, the space between his eyebrows wrinkled slightly. Upon seeing that, the eunuch immediately began looking around in all directions. The moment he saw Xu ZiYan, his eyes revealed pleasant surprise as he walked over.\u201cYou, yes you, country bumpkin. Give your place to our Young Lord. Here\u2019s ten spiritual rocks, consider it as a reward from our Young Lord,\u201d the middle-aged eunuch pointed at Xu ZiYan before saying in a sharp tone.Xu ZiYan gave him an indifferent glance, with not a single expression on his face.\u201cDid you not hear my words?\u201d That eunuch\u2019s face sank slightly. \u201cAre you deaf or something? Oh, I know, the bumpkin resents how the spiritual rocks aren\u2019t enough. Then we\u2019ll give you two more, that\u2019s enough right?\u201d That eunuch took two more spiritual rocks from his interspatial bag before placing it onto his palm. His face was full of ridicule as he looked at Xu ZiYan, seeming completely assured that he would give his position to them because of these few spiritual rocks.Xu ZiYan\u2019s expression looked slightly angry. His previous concession at the transmission array was because they were indeed in the wrong, but if these people thought he was soft and easy to be bullied, then they were wrong.\u201cScram!\u201d\u201cYoungster, what are you talking about?!\u201d The eunuch\u2019s complexion changed as he glowered at Xu ZiYan.\u201cI told you to scram. Did you not hear me? Perhaps you\u2019re deaf?\u201d Xu ZiYan said with a sarcastic smile.He had never been a person with a good temper. If he was in the wrong, he would concede. However, if the other person was the one who was being unreasonable, then he could become even more unreasonable.\u201cVery good, wow! You are very brave, you even dare to scold me!\u201d The eunuch said in a hateful tone. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201dXu ZiYan didn\u2019t even give the other a single look. A dog leg like this who only knew how to bark was a type of person he saw many times before he had transmigrated. You couldn\u2019t be polite to these people, otherwise they would stick their nose into your face and believe you were easy to bully.This place was the line-up for the inner sect disciple applications. It could be said that there was a big chance this generation\u2019s inner sect disciples would be selected from the people in this line.Xu ZiYan wasn\u2019t eager for these people to get the idea that he was easy to be bullied, or else his and Xu ZiRong\u2019s future days wouldn\u2019t be that pleasant.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026You\u2026\u2026.\u201d That eunuch seemed to be angered till he was half-dead as he trembled while pointing a finger at Xu ZiYan.Xu ZiYan expressionlessly gave his application to that Liu Guang Sect disciple who was responsible for their registration. The other, from start to finish, had a completely business-like attitude, as if he simply could not see that eunuch.\u201cAlright, Eunuch Wan, return,\u201d that icily arrogant teenager gave Xu ZiYan a look before he called back that eunuch.That Eunuch Wan seemed to have done a magic trick as his expression suddenly vanished. Putting on a flattering smile, he stood behind the teenager.The several people who stood behind Xu ZiYan and those who had already registered but hadn\u2019t had a chance to leave all watched this show with interest. Many of these people revealed ruminating smiles.To be able to stand here, they had to be the elites from each of their families. From an early age, they would have started an elite-like training. That Eunuch Wan\u2019s probing ability couldn\u2019t be considered as excellent, but that teenager\u2019s way of handling things was extremely good.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If that teenager was irritated by Eunuch Wan to the point he momentarily lost his reasoning and attacked him, then they would all happily clap their hands and rejoice over how they lost a competitor.But the people who had never participated in an inner sect disciple assessment didn\u2019t know that, from the moment they stepped into Fa An City, their test had already started.\u201cHehe, this year\u2019s disciples seem to all be quite passable,\u201d far away in the main hall of the Liu Guang Sect, a dozen or so cultivators with varying dispositions were all assembled together as they watched the situation of the registration line-up from a water mirror.Within these people, the ones with the worst cultivation level were in the late-stage of Golden Core cultivation, while the highest were already at the middle-stage of Nascent Soul cultivation. Most of the cultivators who reached the late-stage of Nascent Soul cultivation would leave the Xuan Yu region to go to the other regions, in search of opportunities for them to become deities. Therefore, other than the old monsters that guarded the Sect, the combination of everyone gathered there could be considered as the full fighting power of Liu Guang Sect.These cultivators stood in clumps of two and three as they exchanged their opinions of the figures in the mirror with one another.\u201cHn, the people from Wei family are still so unbridled!\u201d A pale middle-aged man without a beard watched Eunuch Wan\u2019s actions and couldn\u2019t help but snort coldly.Not far from him stood a large man with sideburns. He had cheeks that looked like nets and he was dressed in full-body armor. When this man heard the other\u2019s words, he laughed out loud: \u201cTo be arrogant, one must first have the ability! And this Wei family kid does have that capability.\u201d He rolled his eyes: \u201cSixteen years of age with the Fire Heavenly Spiritual Vein, in addition, he also completed the Qi Condensation Stage. If he still acts soft or weak, then he could only be foolish!\u201dThe middle-aged man without a beard smiled coldly: \u201cI rather think that the other youngster knows when to step forward or retreat. He also knows etiquette, and in my opinion is much better than that Wei child.\u201dThe big man didn\u2019t seem to care: \u201cKnow etiquette? How is that damn thing useful? I don\u2019t believe it. If you really fight with another person, would knowing etiquette let the other person hit you less? If it would, then we should all quit cultivating and go learn some etiquette instead!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d The middle-aged man looked angry. His most pampered and beloved disciple lost to Wei Ying in the last inter-Sect competitions. Wei Ying was precisely this big man\u2019s disciple. In addition, the way his disciple lost was very shameful, and his disciple ended up bedridden for three full months. The middle-aged man had always been very displeased with the other\u2019s arrogant attitude. However, he was not capable of defeating the other man, so he could only endure and silently swallow his anger.\u201cHehe, it seems that this year\u2019s top inner sect disciple would no doubtbe this Wei Qing,\u201d an Elder on good terms with Wei Ying laughed.\u201cThat might not be the case,\u201d a female cultivator with a normal appearance, one that made her existence feel quite low-key suddenly spoke: \u201cI rather feel that this summer lotus flower has some hidden depths.\u201d The people around her followed her gaze. In the middle of that water mirror, a pretty and charming girl full of smiles was staring at Xu ZiYan with interest.\u201cThat kid from the Hu family isn\u2019t that normal either,\u201d a thin and old Elder added stiffly.The scene in that water mirror suddenly changed. A gloomy-looking teenager stood in the corner. The corner of his mouth looked a bit mocking as he stared coldly at Wei Qing. At this moment, it was as if he had suddenly felt something, and he quickly gave the direction of the water mirror a glance.\u201cOh, this child\u2019s soul is rather keen,\u201d an old Elder said with some surprise. The other people there began agreeing one by one.Everyone there had different opinions, but they were all very satisfied with this year\u2019s batch of inner sect disciples. There were even some who were already making preparations to receive a disciple. Within the main hall of Liu Guang Sect, it became quite peaceful and calm.\u201cSenior-Apprentice Sister Zhou? Who do you think will win?\u201d A young girl wearing a peach-pink cheong sam gently smiled before she asked the icily arrogant woman standing beside her. That woman lightly glanced at the water mirror before speaking: \u201cThe qualifications of this batch of disciples are all pretty good. No matter who it is, they all have a chance of stealing the top spot.\u201dThe young girl stuck out her tongue. \u201cSenior-Apprentice Sister, saying something like that is the same as if you had said nothing at all.\u201dThe cold and proud woman smiled helplessly: \u201cThese kids will soon become my Liu Guang Sect\u2019s disciples. For which one of them will get the top spot, it wouldn\u2019t make a difference.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s different,\u201d the young girl murmured under her breath. However, she didn\u2019t continue pursuing an answer to her question.While these Elders commented on the disciples who were about to enter the Sect, Xu ZiYan began dragging Xu ZiRong all over the place to shop after he handed in his application.After finally leaving Xu family, he intended to take a relaxing break. Before, he had still been worried over whether he would expose his identity. However, he quickly realized that everyone in Xu family had only understood what Xu ZiYan was like on the surface.There was almost no one who knew his real personality. In addition, even his likes and dislikes weren\u2019t known by anyone, so Xu ZiYan was given the ability to completely shape this novel character himself.Back then, when he showed his cooking skills in the kitchen, Xu ZiYan had already prepared an excuse. However, he did not expect that Xu Xiao didn\u2019t even ask about it at all, as if the contents of his life that did not include cultivating had nothing to do with him.Struck by some sudden insight, Xu ZiYan could not help but feel sad for his predecessor. It was said that when children didn\u2019t have people who cared about them, they would start doing some pranks to attract the attention of the adults surrounding them. However, past! Xu ZiYan\u2019s mischief involved bullying Xu ZiRong. After all, in the beginning Xu ZiYan only scolded or beat up Xu ZiRong a bit. But when he realized Xu Xiao didn\u2019t have any intentions of stopping him, his actions began to intensify.Perhaps past! Xu ZiYan\u2019s most successful \u2018prank\u2019 was the event where he had pushed Xu ZiRong down the snake valley, causing the other to almost give up his life. Only then did Xu Xiao lightly scold Xu ZiYan once. It was no wonder that for some reason, Xu ZiRong\u2019s life after that event became unexplainably calm, even though Xu ZiYan got in trouble because of him. And by the time Xu ZiYan wanted to do something to something to him again, Xu ZiRong had long escaped the Xu family.And after that, when Xu ZiYan encountered Bai Hua, it was when he had been at his lowest. No wonder past! Xu ZiYan would fall in love at first sight. Bai Hua\u2019s concern and caring were the emotions past! Xu ZiYan sought but could never receive from his family.Fortunately, when he had transmigrated, Xu ZiYan was already an adult. Otherwise, faced with this senseless and emotionless father, he might have really been raised twisted as well.\u201cZiRong, let\u2019s go! Big brother will take you to eat some delicious things!\u201d Xu ZiYan said with a face full of smiles.Within these years, Xu ZiRong also slowly grew up. Now, he had already became a handsome little teenager.Xu ZiYan had no idea what happened, but the originally very shy child had turned extremely cold. Especially whenever he faced the disciples of Xu family, his complexion would never look good. The Xu ZiRong now had a cold personality, and only when he was faced with Xu ZiYan would he reveal the antics of a child, something he should have (not!). During times like that, he would always watch his big brother with a face full of worship.Whenever Xu ZiYan saw that worshiping expression Xu ZiRong would have when the other stared at him, he would feel his heart, spleen, lungs and kidney all soften into a lump. A little brother who would only give his big brother a sweet smile could not be any more cuter!This \u2018in the entire world my big brother is the best\u2019 type of attitude made Xu ZiYan\u2019s already pretty serious little brother complex become even worse.Although the mini mental him in his heart would wail about how he shouldn\u2019t give up Xu ZiRong\u2019s treatment, if you compared the humble mental him in his inner heart who would only appear once in a while with the Xu ZiRong who accompanied him everyday, Xu ZiRong was absolutely not an opponent a mini mental Xu ZiYan could match\u2026\u2026.(Xu ZiYan\u2019s mental, humble mini him, AKA his reason, burst into tears\u2026\u2026)\u201cAh, okay! What does big brother want to take me to eat?\u201d Xu ZiRong opened up his countenance and smiled. After so many years, his ability to act as a child had become extremely proficient. He was so skillful now that sometimes, in the dead of the night, Xu ZiRong would begin to silently spurn himself. The majestic Blood Devil Lord would actually be so addicted to his own older brother\u2019s warmth, he would willingly act like a spoiled child and throw a tantrum in order to prevent his older brother from deciding that they should sleep separately. It was simply too shameful of a degradation!!!However, after he took some time to feel disdain for himself, he still couldn\u2019t bear to part with the warmth from Xu ZiYan\u2019s chest. Xu ZiRong could only throw away his Blood Devil Lord dignity once again and take the initiative to squirm his way into the other\u2019s embrace.Perhaps it was because he had already become used to Xu ZiYan\u2019s marvel of a sleeping posture, but now he could curl up in Xu ZiYan\u2019s embrace for a whole night without ever letting the other go. No matter how much Xu ZiYan would roll around and torment him, Xu ZiRong was now able to stablely ensure his position wouldn\u2019t move.In addition, ever since he began cultivating the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, his body temperature became very low. This made him even more eager for Xu ZiYan\u2019s warmth.Huddling in that warm hug, it was as if his whole body was being baked by an immense stove. The coziness and comfortable warmth lingered in his body. Thus, the servants of Liu Guang Sect received yet another terrible task: every early morning, they had to wake up the Young Master and Young Master ZiRong before pulling them out of bed\u2026\u2026.\u201cZiRong? Why are you in a daze?\u201dGetting startled out of his recollection of memories by Xu ZiYan, Xu ZiRong smiled slightly: \u201cBig brother still hasn\u2019t told me what we\u2019re eating.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already asked around. The most famous mortal snacks in Fa An City is basically the whole street that\u2019s not far from here. It won\u2019t take long for us to walk there,\u201d Xu ZiYan seemed to be quite excited.Xu ZiRong\u2019s expression was subtly weird, but his face smoothed out quickly. He never felt anything for those small snacks, and rather he always thought they were pretty dirty. However, his good big brother loved those things very much. In addition, whenever Xu ZiYan found something new, he would bring it to him as if he was a child who found some treasure.Xu ZiRong\u2019s lips curved into a smile. He knew that after they ate those snacks today, big brother would take some free time to try and learn how to make them. Although he thought that a cultivator having an interest in cooking was quite strange, since it was his big brother\u2019s hobby, he naturally wouldn\u2019t have any objections.In fact, Xu ZiRong was starting to ponder. In the future, if he were to rebuild the Blood Devil\u2019s Palace, should he kidnap all the best cooks in the cultivation world and take them there? In any case, his big brother was this good to him, so him being good to his big brother was natural. This drama between two good brothers, Xu ZiRong really didn\u2019t mind acting it out for an entire lifetime.\u201cHey! You, yes you!\u201d From behind them suddenly came the crisp yell of a young girl. Xu ZiRong\u2019s face sunk as it began to gather some frost. What he hated most in this life was exactly this: getting disturbed when he wanted to go and do something with his big brother. If that someone who bothered them was a woman, then it was even worse.\u201cAre you calling me?\u201d Xu ZiYan asked with some doubt. He was now fifteen and could be considered as an extremely handsome young man. Twisting his head around, Xu ZiYan took a look at the girl who had just yelled. She looked delicate and charming as she smiled at him.\u201cYeah, if it wasn\u2019t you who would it be?\u201d The girl fumed a bit. \u201cTell me, why are you leaving in such a hurry? You even caused me to chase after you for this long!\u201dXu ZiYan looked surprised. Of course he would be. He didn\u2019t know this girl at all, alright?\u201cWho are you?\u201d The frost on Xu ZiRong\u2019s face was about to become ice. Relying on Xu ZiYan\u2019s pampering and the level of his own cultivation, no one in Xu family dared to mess with him. Almost all the Xu family disciples knew how much Xu ZiRong liked hanging onto Xu ZiYan. The people who disturbed their show of brotherly love would receive an end that was worse than dying!Although his life had developed differently in this lifetime, some of the true aspects of the Blood Devil Lord had already started to gradually emerge. To some extent, everyone would try their best to avoid Xu ZiRong, this gloomy person. There was only Xu ZiYan, who still firmly believed that Xu ZiRong was still his soft and clever little brother!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Little brother, talking in this manner ain\u2019t good,\u201d the young lady said with a face full of smiles. \u201cThen, let\u2019s become acquainted with each other ah. I\u2019m called Xiahou Lian, you should call me Big Sister Lian.\u201dXu ZiRong snorted disdainfully, his gaze ice-cold. Big Sister Lian? Did she really think everyone had the opportunity to be his older sister?\u201cTut tut, a little child being this fierce isn\u2019t that good ah,\u201d Xiahou Lian wasn\u2019t scared of Xu ZiRong\u2019s eye daggers at all, and instead seriously advised him.Xu ZiYan\u2019s face was filled with black lines as he stared at Xiahou Lian. Where did this little girl come from? What was up with her over-familiarity?From the start, Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t intend to care about this Xiahou Lian. He pulled on Xu ZiYan\u2019s sleeve before saying: \u201cBig brother, let\u2019s go eat now.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu ZiYan was a bit startled before he nodded his head. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cHey hey, don\u2019t leave ah! You can\u2019t ignore a big, living person standing right in front of you,\u201d Xiahou Lian immediately yelled.Xu ZiYan looked helpless. \u201cThis young lady, I don\u2019t believe we are acquainted?\u201d\u201cHaha,\u201d Xiahou Lian chuckled. \u201cDidn\u2019t I just introduce myself? My name is Xiahou Lian, how about you?\u201dXu ZiYan was practically speechless. He casually saluted before replying: \u201cMy name is Xu ZiYan.\u201dslide-bg-full1\u201cLook! Aren\u2019t we acquainted now?\u201d Xiahou Lian spread out her hand.Xu ZiYan: \u2026\u2026 He silently held his forehead. This kind of bubbly, over-familiar and super outgoing personality, Xu ZiYan had the sudden premonition that it would bring him a lot of problems\u2026\u2026Xu ZiRong\u2019s face sunk like water. He despised this woman. Although he didn\u2019t know why he loathed her, it was a sudden instinctive dislike. A ball of killing intent emerged in his heart, causing Xu ZiRong to become suddenly startled. He forced down that feeling and began to continuously use the Wood Element Supporting Arts to appease the blood in his body.In reality, Xu ZiRong had completed the Qi Condensation Stage far earlier than Xu ZiYan. However, he could not build his foundation before his older brother.During Liu Guang Sect\u2019s disciple recruiting day, the disciples with Qi Condensation Stage and Foundation Establishment Stage were assigned to different places. Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t want to be separated from his brother, so he could only suppress his own cultivation.Nowadays, he could be compared to a pot of boiling water. The water was clearly hot to the point it was bubbling, but he still insisted on covering the top with the lid. If Xu ZiRong did this for a short while, there wouldn\u2019t be any big problems. However, should he persist doing this for a long time, then inevitably, this would cause some hidden wounds.Moreover, because his blood was in a continuously flaring state, that ball of anger began emerging more and more frequently. The last time he had vented out these feelings was only three days ago. He would have never imagined that just after three days, he would once again feel that familiar emotion.\u201cOh, little brother, what\u2019s wrong? Do you feel uncomfortable?\u201d Xiahou Lian\u2019s heart suddenly skipped a beat. She stared at the young boy in front of her with some misgivings. That feeling she felt just a moment ago, did it originate from this child?Xu ZiRong lowered his head and didn\u2019t speak. He just continued pulling on Xu ZiYan\u2019s sleeves, refusing to let go.Xu ZiYan laughed. \u201cSorry about that, my younger brother is a bit shy.\u201dXiahou Lian felt the corner of her mouth twitch. How the heck was this child \u2018shy\u2019? Just now, the eye dagger he threw at her was really nimble and sharp, alright\u2026\u2026\u201cBig brother, I\u2019m hungry,\u201d Xu ZiRong raised his head. He stared at Xu ZiYan with watery and big black eyes.Xu ZiYan affectionately rubbed Xu ZiRong\u2019s head before turning around to talk to Xiahou Lian. \u201cMiss Xiaohou, my little brother is hungry. We\u2019ll take our leave first.\u201d The moment he finished speaking, Xu ZiYan turned around to leave.Xu ZiRong followed him slowly. Before he left, he gave Xiahou Lian a glance as the corner of his mouth curved up in a cold smile.A light flashed by in Xiahou Lian\u2019s eyes. Her arms hugged her chest as she watched the two brothers walk farther and farther away. The corner of her mouth curved up lightly as she murmured in a quiet and low voice: \u201cThis batch of new people are really quite interesting.\u201dAfter saying goodbye to Xiahou Lian, Xu ZiYan quickly pushed this weird girl to the back of his mind. Next, he rolled his sleeves up for battle before bringing Xu ZiRong to that street full of snacks. They started eating everything from the street as they walked from the beginning of the road to its end. Afterwards, the things they bought when they were too full were all packed up by Xu ZiYan and placed into his interspatial bag.As he rubbed his round and bulging stomach, Xu ZiYan had a face filled with obvious satisfaction. Although the snacks here didn\u2019t have as much seasonings as the ones in the modern times, they equally had their own particular flavours. Many exotic things were matched together to create extremely charming gourmet food.Xu ZiYan was incomparably joyful that this world wasn\u2019t lacking in the culinary aspect. Although he was alright at making food, something like looking for seasoning wasn\u2019t his speciality.Compared to Xu ZiYan\u2019s satisfaction, Xu ZiRong\u2019s response was very ordinary. Although each of the snacks here could be considered to be distinctive and special, the Blood Devil Lord wouldn\u2019t be deceived by them.In reality, for him, everything that wasn\u2019t \u2018handmade by Xu ZiYan\u2019 lost its splendor. Thus, Xu ZiRong pledged that after he built his foundation and began abstaining from food, unless it was something created personally by Xu ZiYan, he didn\u2019t intend to eat anything.And as for whether or not Xu ZiYan would make food for him? This point wasn\u2019t something he was worried about at all. This person Xu ZiYan, he usually had his principles. However, in front of Xu ZiRong, all of those principles became empty talk unless he stepped on Xu ZiYan\u2019s bottom line. Thus, when he faced Xu ZiRong, Xu ZiYan granted practically all of his requests.Within the past three years, Xu ZiRong tragically suffered several more spanking sessions. However, through his persistent observations, he had more or less figured out all of Xu ZiYan\u2019s bottom limit.Although the other boy\u2019s personality was upright and honest, he wasn\u2019t stubborn to the point he was inflexible. In addition, when he confronted an enemy, he was able to become ruthless should it be necessary.However, the first time Xu ZiYan killed someone, he ended up locking himself in their room for two shichen1. Back then, Xu ZiRong had felt somewhat disapproving. It was merely killing someone, it was nothing much. In the cultivation world, if you didn\u2019t want to kill anyone, then you could only wait to be slaughtered. If a person wanted to walk on the road of cultivation, they would always end up creating piles of white bones.With regards to how Xu ZiYan actually had such a reaction to killing someone, Xu ZiRong had felt somewhat impatient. But when Xu ZiYan came out afterwards, his thoroughly red eyes and his deathly pale complexion made Xu ZiRong\u2019s heart suddenly ache. Despite his thoughts before, now he began to feel painfully distressed.But, although he had been that deathly pale, Xu ZiYan still didn\u2019t forget to comfort Xu ZiRong. He gently rubbed Xu ZiRong\u2019s head before he tried his best to squeeze out a smile. \u201cBig brother is fine. I\u2019ve let you worry.\u201dEven now, Xu ZiRong could not clearly explain what he had been feeling back then. He could only stare at Xu ZiYan blankly. After a long while, in which Xu ZiYan had long dragged him back into their room and made him sit, did he finally wake up.Xu ZiRong\u2019s mood then had been quite fantastic. He had been somewhat in high spirits, but he had also been somewhat panicked. That person was obviously feeling unwell because of his first kill, but Xu ZiYan actually still remembered to comfort him.This kind of feeling, where someone attached great importance to him, felt really nice. Actually, Xu ZiRong felt that his level of importance to Xu ZiYan was already at an unfathomable degree. In his last life, his subordinates had also attached great importance to him, their Blood Devil Lord. However, that kind of importance was different from this kind of importance. This was because, only with the Blood Devil Lord\u2019s existence would those subordinates be able to live their days where they could stir up trouble with little repercussions. Without the Blood Devil, their endings wouldn\u2019t be that good either.However, his importance to Xu ZiYan was different. Xu ZiRong was unable to explain how he knew his importance to Xu ZiYan was different, he was only able to feel that difference.That day, Xu ZiRong rubbed his chest before realizing his pulse was beating extremely quickly. His blood also felt as if it was boiling. Xu ZiRong knew that this was the first sign his ball of anger was about to appear again, but he didn\u2019t expect that nowadays, his fluctuating emotions would actually have such a violent reaction.Ever since that day, his possessive feelings for Xu ZiYan became even stronger.Since they were all born in the Xu family, those other Xu children could also be considered as Xu ZiYan\u2019s little brothers even if Xu ZiRong was the closest to him. However, Xu ZiRong began to completely monopolize Xu ZiYan\u2019s attention.No one else could take part on Xu ZiYan\u2019s concern. No matter who it was, it wasn\u2019t allowed!Xu ZiYan was Xu ZiRong\u2019s big brother. He was forever his only brother. If someone tried to steal his big brother, then Xu ZiRong would make that person die tragically without a burial site!\u201cAh, I\u2019m so full. Let\u2019s return, Master Mo has probably become anxious by now,\u201d Xu ZiYan hiccuped before he spoke, mood pleasant.While they were at the registration queue, Xu ZiYan\u2019s protector \u2014\u2014the Meridian Condensation Stage cultivator\u2014\u2014 was ordered to report back to Xu Mo. In any case, there was nobody who dared to do something in this Fa An City. Unless they were tired of living, or unless they were confident enough to escape the killing team sent out by Liu Guang Sect, nobody would do something that stupid.That silent man probably also knew that there wasn\u2019t any danger in this city, so he didn\u2019t insist on staying before he returned. However, after eating their fill of an entire street\u2019s worth of snacks, the sky had begun darkening. Thus, it was about time to go back.As expected, after they returned to the inn, Xu ZiYan was ruthlessly scolded by Xu Mo. Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t actually mind. Perhaps in the eyes of other people, this recruiting assessment by the Liu Guang Sect was very important and very hard. Even if his innate talent was excellent, he still couldn\u2019t be careless as it was possible he wouldn\u2019t be selected.However, Xu ZiYan had long known the contents of tomorrow\u2019s assessment, so much that he had the confidence to seize the top place of the inner-sect disciples\u2019 test.If he remembered correctly, the inner-sect disciple who was ranked first for the test could choose their own master. As he was well-acquainted with the novel and with (past) Xu ZiYan\u2019s life, Xu ZiYan had already chosen an unremarkable but truly powerful master.The Master of the original Xu ZiYan was also a Lightning Spiritual Vein cultivator. Although he was pretty good to the original Xu ZiYan, Xu ZiYan disliked his personality. Normal mortals had a very low status compared to cultivators, but Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t accept that type of mindset. One time this Master fought with a devil cultivator, he could have avoided damaging the villages and towns of the mortals if he had led the other away. However, the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s Lightning Spiritual Vein Master completely didn\u2019t care whether or not those villagers lived or died. With his one attack, at least a hundred of innocent villagers died.When his fight with that devil cultivator ended, the village below had long became a patch of scorched earth. Hundreds of innocent people had died tragically, yet that Master had just thrown the devil cultivator\u2019s body onto his shoulders before leaving indifferently.This scene was one Xu ZiYan found within the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories. Back then, the original Xu ZiYan was only a cultivator in the late-stage of Foundation Establishment Stage, and thus had no way to participate in a fight like that. However, in the face of such a tragic situation, he only sat on the sidelines coldly with not a single strand of mercy in his heart.Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t consider himself to be a Holy Mother, but something like that completely exceeded his bottom line. Perhaps the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s Master didn\u2019t intend to target those villagers below him, but the fact that those villagers had died was an indisputable fact.The way the original Xu ZiYan had just indifferently sat on the side made him feel uncomfortable as well. After all, although he was now a cultivator, before he had transmigrated Xu ZiYan had also been a normal mortal.Tired, Xu ZiYan made Xu Mo leave with a few words. In the past two years, this yellow-faced buff man was becoming more and more like the incarnation of his neighbourhood committee\u2019s aunty. He didn\u2019t mind the other being cold or strict with him, but this kind of long-winded scoldings that lacked real importance was truly something he couldn\u2019t bear.The author has something to say: Xu ZiYan: Let\u2019s change a Master ah, the original one isn\u2019t kind enough.Xu ZiRong: I\u2019ll listen to big brother\u2026\u2026Xu ZiYan: Aiya ZiRong is so obedient, he is so much more obedient compared to that bear child ZiYu.Xu ZiRong (gloomy face): Who is ZiYu?Xu ZiYan: Ha ha ha\u2026\u2026today\u2019s weather is very nice\u2026\u2026Xu ZiRong: Big brother, should we do a count of those offenses in my small notebook once more?Xu ZiYan: \u56e7 \u2026\u2026Don\u2019t be like this\u2026\u2026 3801213fb80e7becaa914014242eb9389a506bf8Xu ZiRong begins dragging Xu ZiYan to their room\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xu ZiYan could not ensure that, should Xu Mo continue to be so wordy, he would not just begin cursing at him.To curse madly in front of Xu ZiRong, it would completely ruin his good older brother image! Thus, Xu ZiYan must put an end to that possibility!However, perhaps Xu ZiYan\u2019s self-confidence had infected the other Xu family people, because everyone was now looking forward to Xu ZiYan\u2019s performance tomorrow.The disciples who were capable of being dispatched by the Xu family to try their luck at other Sects were all naturally quite qualified. They had long heard of how hard-working the main branch\u2019s Young Master was.To be able to have his cultivation level at his age, it was enough for him to be proud. In fact, with his strength, as long as there weren\u2019t any mishaps, it was practically impossible for him to be eliminated.Liu Guang Sect\u2019s assessment was three days long. After the assessment finished, the rest of Xu ZiYan\u2019s entourage would go to the other Sects to try their luck. The reason for this timing was because although Xu ZiYan\u2019s entry into Liu Guang Sect wasn\u2019t a big problem, Xu ZiRong\u2019s Tri-Spirit Vein made things a bit difficult.The innate gift he possessed was his perception abilities, however, high perception could be said to be something illusory. Although Xu ZiRong\u2019s current cultivation was quite astonishing, in face of the talented Heavenly Spiritual Vein and those Mutated Spiritual Vein cultivators, there was simply nothing to compare.In regards to this issue, Xu ZiYan was actually more confident in Xu ZiRong compared to other Xu family people.Who was Xu ZiRong? In his past life, he was the infamous demon cultivator! Although Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t cultivate the Blood Sea Heart Sutra in this life (wrong!), he wouldn\u2019t be that bad off. What about the Tri-Spirit Vein? There were quite a lot of Nascent Soul cultivators with the Tri-Spirit Vein. The so-called Lightning Spiritual Vein was good, the Water Spiritual Vein was also good, and the single Spiritual Vein was of course pretty good. However, these cultivators would merely have a slightly better foundation compared to other people. Their future developments still depended on their respective opportunities and destiny.Although high comprehension skills were sometimes useless, everyone had to admit that cultivators with good perception could use half of another person\u2019s effort and receive twice the results. It was the same as Xu ZiYan\u2019s moment of enlightenment from before. In a short period of time, his cultivation level would rise as if it was flying. Though Xu ZiRong had never had epiphanies before, his cultivation was already astonishing enough. Xu ZiYan believed that as long as the Elders at Liu Guang Sect weren\u2019t stupid, they wouldn\u2019t drive away this rare talent for the other Sects.In fact, Xu ZiYan thought that perhaps in the eyes of those old foxes, Xu ZiRong was more valuable than himself.The two brothers passed a night in silence. Nowadays, Xu ZiYan thought that with Xu ZiRong being eleven already, sleeping together wasn\u2019t the best. However, every time he proposed preparing an individual bedroom for Xu ZiRong, the other would always stare at him pitifully. That expression, one that was the same as an abandoned puppy\u2019s, made Xu ZiYan unable to even finish his sentence.Perhaps it was because of his mother\u2019s early death combined with how their father didn\u2019t really care about him, for Xu ZiRong was very insecure. This point could be felt from how Xu ZiRong would tightly hug Xu ZiYan whenever they were in sleeping in bed.To Xu ZiRong\u2019s great fortune, Xu ZiYan\u2019s sleeping position was extremely better than before. After all, being kept in a python-like grasp every night as he slept would influence his position to a certain extent.Yeah\u2026\u2026nowadays, Xu ZiYan\u2019s sleeping position has already changed from rolling around three hundred sixty degrees to rolling around one hundred eighty degrees. As such, Xu ZiRong\u2019s amazing ability to coil along could not be ignored\u2026\u2026u1ntitledThe next early morning, the two brothers that were coiled around their blankets like fried dough twists were woken up by Xu Mo\u2019s loud voice. The two of them glanced at each other before they climbed out of bed with much difficulty.Xu ZiRong felt somewhat vexed. His alertness was becoming more and more terrible, and that wasn\u2019t a good sign.After the two of them washed up, they made their way to the woods outside the west gate of Fa An City accompanied by that indifferent, middle-aged man.The protection Liu Guang Sect offered Fa An City only covered the grounds within the city gates. Without any exceptions, the fights that happened outside of the city walls were all no longer part of their jurisdiction. Thus, as there was some distance between that grove and Fa An city, the walk that covered this distance could be considered as the Liu Guang\u2019s first test for these candidates.In reality, the route to the grove was already cleaned up by the people of Liu Guang Sect. Any spiritual beasts that had cultivation levels greater than Foundation Establishment Stage were thoroughly slaughtered. However, the part that had been cleaned up was only limited to the route to the woods, where the gathering place was. In addition, the route that brought one from the city walls to the forest had no one supervising it.The top three candidates for the inner-sect disciple test would receive extremely generous rewards, and the top candidate even had the right to select their own master. In other words, if they selected the Sect Leader as their master, they would even possess the chance to inherit the title in the future. Of course, that would still just be a chance.In any case, the top three positions were always fought over extremely fiercely every time. This time, since Xu ZiYan intended to fight for that first place position, he naturally wouldn\u2019t treat this lightly and lower his guard.When the original came to participate in this test, he had only been at the seventh layer of Qi Condensation Stage. In addition, the only martial arts he had learned was Thunder Jolt. That Xu ZiYan had an empty Lightning Spiritual Vein but no skills to match it. Among those disciples, the original Xu ZiYan could have only been considered as a candidate who was a bit above the average.Perhaps it had been because the original\u2019s strength was not up to par, but the other Xu ZiYan got through that exam in an awfully ordinary manner, receiving a grade that was neither good nor bad. However, all of the candidates who had been the strongest were intercepted with attacks halfway to their test.These kind of attacks didn\u2019t want one\u2019s life, but it would force them to be injured, something that would affect their gameplay. In this life, Xu ZiYan could also be considered as one of the extremely talented candidates, so he naturally had to prepare for any underhanded moves.That habitually silent middle-aged man only needed to escort him to the entrance of the grove. The path inside the woods was one Xu ZiYan had to struggle through by himself. In reality, bringing along that middle-aged man was merely for the purpose of protecting himself from the attacks of the other candidates\u2019 families. Regarding the candidates themselves, Xu ZiYan was relatively more assured of an outcome in his favour.\u201cAlright, Uncle Liu, sending me to this point will be enough.\u201d Xu ZiYan stopped walking when they reached the entrance of the grove, before speaking up to allow the middle-aged man to return.That middle-aged person nodded his head before turning around to leave. However, before leaving, he gave the woods a profound glance.Xu ZiYan knew that this was the other\u2019s way of reminding him that within the forest, there would certainly be other people watching them. Right now, he merely didn\u2019t know if those people were from the Liu Guang Sect, or if they were actually other candidates.Xu ZiYan took a look at the time. There was still around half a shichen1 before they had to be at the gathering site. Thus, he smiled before he held Xu ZiRong\u2019s hand, and then he began confidently leading him into the woods.After they entered the forest, although Xu ZiYan looked serene on the outside as he headed toward the meeting place, in reality he was already very alert. He had raised his guard for anyone\u2019s sneak attack, and he was ready to respond at all times.These sneak attacks between candidates were the prequel competition before the main event. After all, if a cultivator wanted to go far in life, just having strength and power wasn\u2019t enough. One must also possess a smart mind. The excited candidates who enter the forest without any prior preparations would only be harmed by others. They wouldn\u2019t even be given a chance to say any grievances.\u201cZiRong, stay close to big brother. Don\u2019t run about.\u201d Xu ZiYan said in a low voice.Xu ZiRong nodded his head in an obedient manner. Although he hadn\u2019t experienced this exam in his previous life, he could tell that it wasn\u2019t as simple as he had thought just from Xu ZiYan\u2019s current behavior.Once more, Xu ZiRong celebrated the fact that his Blood Sea Heart Sutra was capable of storing one\u2019s spiritual energy in the user\u2019s blood. At this moment, regardless of who tried to investigate his cultivation level, no one would be able to discover that he had already finished cultivating the Qi Condensation Stage.The two brothers deliberately looked happy as they walked in the forest. To others, they seemed to have taken this walk as an ordinary trip in which one had to be slightly hasty. The two of them walked forward to their destination yet they also leisurely strolled around, so much that sometimes Xu ZiYan would pick some wild fruits to eat.These two completely didn\u2019t act as though they were participating in a test. Instead, they seemed to be on a fun stroll in spring.On a small tree not far from them, a bird that was only as big as the length of a finger was currently watching them with curiosity.That bird looked completely normal. It stayed on a tree branch, and every now and then it would even peck its own feathers. Its actions were vivid and realistic. No matter who saw it, they would all think it was just an ordinary bird.The only unusual thing about this bird was its eyes. Those pitch-black eyes, ones that could be compared with obsidian, didn\u2019t have any vitality within them.Far away, in a side palace hall of Liu Guang Sect, around ten or so disciples were currently busy with recording something in a book.Every one of them had a shallow basin filled with water in front of them. The basins were filled to the brim with water, and inside the basins, a Solidifying Water Mirror Technique was used. The outside of the basins were embedded with a lower grade spiritual stone, and the spiritual energy of the stone was unceasingly drawn out.Many different images emerged on the surface of the water. Most of it were related to the candidates who had came to participate in the exam, so the two brothers Xu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong were naturally included. In fact, these two brothers were some of the people these disciples were most concerned with.The person responsible for watching Xu ZiYan was a normal inner-sect disciple. When he saw how Xu ZiYan was walking to the meeting place in a manner as if the other was enjoying a spring hike, he couldn\u2019t help but reveal a mocking smile.Naturally, from his mirror\u2019s angle there didn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong. However, what was displayed in his neighbouring mirror was a man in all black. He had concealed himself and was currently only around two hundred meters from the two brothers.This inner-sect disciple shook his head before sighing. He firmly believed that Xu ZiYan would be unable to escape this man\u2019s ambush attack, and thus, would be inevitably wounded. Originally, there had been an Elder who had been somewhat interested in him. This was why Xu ZiYan was classified as an important target for observation. However, no one would have expected that he didn\u2019t have any vigilance. Although his cultivation level was high, with the situation like this, he probably reached that level only by dumping in a bunch of pellet medicine.If things were really like that, then Xu ZiYan would merely be at this standard. Without real combat experience, even if he could successfully make his way to the meeting area, he wouldn\u2019t be able to perform too well in the actual exam.\u201cWhat a waste. Why couldn\u2019t I be the one who had interested that Elder?\u201d This disciple pouted a bit, feeling quite unhappy. However, the image that appeared on the water next made him so surprised, he practically dropped his jaw.The Xu ZiYan who seemed to be extremely relaxed suddenly jump up. He patted his interspatial bag once and then withdrew a silver bow.Xu ZiYan did not take out any arrows. Instead, he used two fingers to pull back the bowstring. Following the backward movement of his fingers, an arrow made from a purple bolt of fizzling lightning gradually formed.Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t hesitate. With the loosening of his fingers, that arrow made out of lightning flew out. The disciple who was responsible for observing Xu ZiYan practically turned to the other mirror in a reflexive manner. Even then, he only saw a purple light suddenly appear. That man in black didn\u2019t have any time to react, and was thus hit in the shoulder.The man was immediately surprised. He would have never imagined that the other would discover him when he was this far away. In addition, Xu ZiYan was even able to shoot out arrows that actually wounded his body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After giving Xu ZiYan a ferocious glare, he gritted his teeth before fleeing.On the other hand, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t continue chasing him to finish their fight. The people waiting to ambush them in the forest only wanted to wound them. Since they didn\u2019t have any intentions to kill, should Xu ZiYan insist on taking the other\u2019s life, that wouldn\u2019t be very good. In addition, he did not believe that there weren\u2019t any people from Liu Guang Sect here. If things escalated to the point where a life may be lost, those people would inevitably appear to take control of the situation.Leisurely placing his silver long bow back into his interspatial bag, Xu ZiYan continued to walk forward in a very good mood. The people lurking in the forest hadn\u2019t consisted of only that man in black, however, that man\u2019s strength had been the strongest. If he had wanted to kill a chicken to warn off the monkey while also showing off his strength, then there was no doubt that the man in black had been his best target.chicken\u201cBig brother is so amazing,\u201d Xu ZiRong praised with a face full of smiles.\u201cHa ha,\u201d Xu ZiYan laughed a bit, feeling a bit embarrassed. Although having a little brother who always praised him felt nice, he was still very clear about how without Xu ZiRong\u2019s help, he wouldn\u2019t have so easily wounded their opponent. In a forest like this, the Wood Element martial arts was capable of bringing out the full extent of its power. In the past three years, other than cultivating the martial art techniques Silent Running Rain and Tempering Wood Secrets, he only learned one more called \u2018Forest Speech\u2019. This martial arts technique didn\u2019t really have any attacking power. However, if one was in a forest, they could communicate with plants to a certain degree.Of course, chatting or gossiping with the plants was absolutely impossible. At most, one would only be able to obtain some hazy warnings, like tips about where dangerous things may be hiding. But even with things like that, there may be times where the martial arts technique was ineffective. At the very least, the other children of the Xu family who learned this technique practically never managed to communicate with the plants before. Thus, for some time people considered this martial arts book as rubbish.However, what was strange was how this martial arts technique worked numerous times when Xu ZiRong used it. Back then, when they were training in the forest behind the Xu family mountains, Xu ZiRong was able to frequently help Xu ZiYan find some spiritual beasts suited to his level. Toward this mystery, Xu ZiYan had always remained puzzled despite pondering over it many times. In the end, he could only conclude that Xu ZiRong was just naturally suited to Wood Element martial arts.In reality\u2014\u2014It was of course impossible for that damn Forest Speech technique to have such an obvious effect. The reason why Xu ZiRong was able to so keenly sense the ambush in their surroundings was because the Blood Demon Lord possessed an innate sensitivity to blood.Within a certain range, Xu ZiRong was capable of distinguishing between blood by how energy-rich they were. In this forest that was near the city, high-level spiritual beasts were already long taken care of. Thus, for the people who were hiding to ambush them, they looked the same as a bunch of flashing lanterns in the darkness. Even pretending to not see them was a hard feat for Xu ZiRong.After taking care of that man hiding far away, the other lurking ambushers who saw this scene all sucked in a breath of cold air. Although they had previously known that Xu ZiYan was a popular candidate for the top position of the inner-sect disciple exam, this kind of strength still made people feel shocked.Silently, at least two of the people hiding retreated. Xu ZiYan\u2019s strength had far surpassed their expectations. If they did something now, their ending probably wouldn\u2019t be that good. In addition, there was a high chance they would end up offending this popular candidate for the top position. Their gains wouldn\u2019t make up for such losses!The retreating of some people happened according to Xu ZiYan\u2019s predictions. Nobody was foolish. Perhaps some of those ambushers here today were only here because they were forced by other people. However, after they saw his strength, the people who would actually do anything lessoned.\u201cThere\u2019s still one more,\u201d Xu ZiRong said in a low voice.The smile on Xu ZiYan\u2019s face gradually faded away. Since they have not even officially entered the exam, he hadn\u2019t wanted to offend too many people. Killing that chicken was precisely in order to create an intimidating effect. However, if someone still had the idea of fighting him, then Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t mind giving the other a profound lesson.Unexpectedly, that hidden person didn\u2019t start attacking, and instead they walked out from their hiding spot.Xu ZiYan pulled back his gaze the moment he laid his eyes on the tall teenager. He recognized this person! Or perhaps it was better to say, the original Xu ZiYan knew him.This person was called Lei Hu, a member of a barbarian clan from the Northwest. All year round, they lived in a barren desert in the western lands. There, many different types of spiritual beasts also called that place their home. Among them, there wasn\u2019t a lack of spiritual beasts with the same cultivation level as a Nascent Soul cultivator.In the Xuan Yu region, the battle between spiritual beasts and human cultivators never ceased. In addition, this Northwest barbarian clan was the first line of defense at the battle taking place in the Northwestern lands.The people of this barbarian clan possessed a very strong physical body. Even without a spiritual vein, their physical strength could be compared to Qi Condensation Stage cultivators. Moreover, because they have to fight in close combat with spiritual beasts all year round, practically everyone in their clan has a murderous aura surrounding them. Even the barbarian clan\u2019s most average soldier was at least as strong as a regular Xuan Yu region cultivator at the fifth or sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage.The Northwestern battle fortress wasn\u2019t defended by only this barbarian clan. Influential and large sects or cultivation families must send members to join the fight periodically. It could be said that the Northwestern battle fortress was the place to refine and temper someone. Practically everyone who returned from there becomes an elite cultivator, the cream of the crop.Of course, the prerequisite for this was to return home, alive.The battle against the spiritual beasts were full of dangers. Be a bit careless, and even a Golden Core cultivator might have to give up their life. With Xu ZiYan\u2019s current cultivation level, if he went there now he would completely just be a cannon fodder. Although, in order to improve, Xu ZiYan had long made plans to go there in the future.This boy called Lei Hu was a candidate who had been recommended by the Northwestern barbarian clan to join Liu Guang Sect\u2019s inner-sect disciple exam. For the members of the barbarian clan, all of them joined the battle against the spiritual beasts when they were very young. Xu ZiYan wasn\u2019t sure about other people, but this Lei Hu in front of him made him feel inexplicably nervous\u2014\u2014even though the other was only at the seventh layer of Qi Condensation Stage.However, Lei Hu gave Xu ZiYan the feeling that, should they fight, it would be hard to predict the end result.\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t want to suddenly become hostile without any reasons. After all, this Lei Hu took the initiative to come out of his hiding spot. That itself was already a sign for truce.Lei Hu was tall and buff, and he only wore a piece of tiger skin cloth. With gleaming, shiny skin that showed off his sinewy and sturdy muscles, Xu ZiYan would have never believed the person in front of him was only sixteen years old had he not possessed the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories.\u201cWhat is\u2026\u2026that?\u201d When Lei Hu walked out, his expression was very serious and his thick eyebrows were scrunched into a lump. His expression made it seem like he had very tangled thoughts. However, the moment he opened his mouth to speak, Xu ZiYan\u2019s metaphorical eyeglasses fell. What was this guy talking about? Don\u2019t tell him he was asking about the attack Xu ZiYan just used?Lei Hu seemed to have mistaken Xu ZiYan\u2019s silence as reluctance to answer. His eyebrows tightened even more, and he seemed to feel extremely embarrassed. After hesitating for a long time, he took out a small bead from his pocket before giving it to Xu ZiYan. \u201cYou people from the central lands always like exchanging things. I\u2019ll give you this, in return, you teach me the skill you just did?\u201dAs Xu ZiYan stared at that bead, a Foundation Establishment spiritual beast\u2019s demon core, he felt his eyelid twitch. His heart really wanted to roar out: this f*cking can\u2019t be right!!! According to the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s impression, where was your berserk fury? Where was the aggressiveness leaking out of your every move? Where was your completely unreasonable and boorish rudeness?!!! Had they all been eaten by you???F*ck ah! The original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memory could actually be unreliable at times too! This happening was practically an inconceivable event alright!!!\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s not enough?\u201d Lei Hu cocked his head to the side. \u201cYou people from the Central lands all seem to know these strange things. If you refuse to teach me, I can still learn from other people. However\u2026\u2026I still think your techniques are the most powerful!\u201dAt this moment, Xu ZiYan only wanted to laugh \u2018hehe\u2019. Should he praise Lei Hu\u2019s sight to be pretty good? He could even tell his Nine Changes of Violet Heaven was a good thing.He rubbed his face hard before giving Lei Hu a smile. \u201cMy attacks are part of a martial arts that cannot be passed on. Forgive me, but I cannot teach you them.\u201dLei Hu looked a bit disappointed. The only reason he came to Liu Guang Sect was to learn even more powerful techniques. Although everyone from his clan had extremely strong physical bodies, there wasn\u2019t a lot of people with spiritual veins. He was already considered as an inconceivable genius with his dual spiritual veins. If it wasn\u2019t for that, he wouldn\u2019t have been sent here by the Head Chief to learn different types of martial arts.Xu ZiRong stood beside Xu ZiYan. His small, indifferent face looked extremely dissatisfied toward Lei Hu. This rude, unreasonable guy who couldn\u2019t even wear clothes properly actually made his brother reveal that kind of expression. It was truly too hateful!Xu ZiRong coldly stared at Lei Hu. In his heart, he was wondering how to silently teach him a lesson. After so many years, although his personality was just as bloodthirsty as before, Xu ZiRong finally stopped killing people for light reasons. This was because he knew that Xu ZiYan\u2019s tolerance levels for things like that was extremely low. This was also something he had learned from experience, after he suffered through a \u2018profound\u2019 lesson from Xu ZiYan.That time, he almost killed a Xu family disciple. Although on the surface it didn\u2019t seem like he had done it intentionally, Xu ZiRong was indeed the one who made the other get ensnared with the trap in the forest.The poor girl from back then had suffered grievous wounds and almost died. When Xu ZiYan found out about this matter, for the first time he rushed toward him in anger and then gave him a heavy beating.Before, whenever Xu ZiYan spanked him, it had more of a symbolic meaning and less emphasis on the actual spanking. However, this time, Xu ZiYan actually used some strength. Thus, his behind even became swollen.After he spanked Xu ZiRong, Xu ZiYan became regretful and got some ointment for him. As he helped him spread it on the swollen area, he would scold him about how, no matter how angry he was, he couldn\u2019t take it out and harm innocent people.As he felt the large hand helping him put on the medicine, Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t take Xu ZiYan\u2019s words to heart. He already knew from his previous life that strong people were the ones who represented justice and truth. When he had enough strength, regardless of whether he was innocent or guilty, wouldn\u2019t what he say become the truth?It had the same concept as the incident in his last life. The blood-sucking demonic insects obviously didn\u2019t have any relationship to him. However, hadn\u2019t those people relied on their strength to forcefully push this matter onto his body?!The only thing Xu ZiRong learned that day was that if he wanted to do something similar in the future, he must avoid Xu ZiYan and keep him in the dark. If possible, it would be even better to not take his target\u2019s life. This way, if the mastermind behind the incidents was revealed in the future, Xu ZiYan wouldn\u2019t be too angry.As for why Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t want to make Xu ZiYan too angry, Xu ZiRong never pondered about that matter. He just instinctively thought that, should he make his big brother too angry, there would probably be some very terrible consequences.Although Lei Hu felt disappointed, he did not forcibly demand anything. He only gave Xu ZiRong a light glance before telling Xu ZiYan a single sentence: \u201cBe careful of your little brother.\u201dXu ZiYan: ???Be careful of what? Be careful he would be in danger?Xu ZiYan had just wanted to drag Lei Hu over and ask what exactly he should be careful of when Xu ZiRong grabbed his hand first. \u201cBig brother, I think the meet-up time is almost here.\u201dXu ZiYan took a look. Sure enough, they wasted a lot of time. There wasn\u2019t any time left to ponder anything, so he pulled Xu ZiRong\u2019s hand and quickly ran toward the gathering site.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His expression looked extremely somber.That person\u2026\u2026 was actually this sensitive to blood\u2026\u2026He could not stay!Xu ZiYan was completely oblivious that the little brother he thought to be kind and obedient was currently pondering how to kill that guy from before. Instead, he was mulling over the words Lei Hu had just told him.Anything related to his little brother must be handled seriously. Thus, Lei Hu\u2019s words that came out of the blue really made things hard for Xu ZiYan.Although he had been determined to find Lei Hu again to ask what he meant, time was running out. In addition, Xu ZiRong seemed to dislike that person.After hesitating for a while, Xu ZiYan still gave up his plan in the end.The two brothers followed the path as they rapidly neared the meeting location. There were other people on the path who were waiting to ambush them, but with Xu ZiRong\u2019s prior warnings, Xu ZiYan only needed to glance in their general direction to warn them: we already know where you are hiding.Lacking the necessary element of surprise, not many people would be able to win in a fight against Xu ZiYan and his completed Qi Condensation Stage cultivation. With the addition of the Xu ZiRong beside him, who was at the eighth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, the combined pressure of the two brothers was even greater than Wei Qing\u2019s or Xiahou Lian\u2019s.In reality, although Xu ZiYan was included amongst the popular candidates for the top position of the inner-sect competition, compared to the backgrounds and forces backing Wei Qing or Xiahou Lian, the remote Xu family was just too inferior.For this reason, not many people thought highly of Xu ZiYan, even though his cultivation wasn\u2019t any worse compared to Wei Qing and the rest of them.When selecting persimmons, one must target the softer ones. In addition, it was quite obvious that Xu ZiYan was the sole pushover among those ultra-talented geniuses. Thus, Wei Qing, Xiahou Lian, and the other geniuses had an awfully undisturbed trip. Only Xu ZiYan encountered an ambush.Of course, after making an example out of that slaughtered chicken, other people would quickly realize that Xu ZiYan was definitely not some kind of soft persimmon. If one wanted to take a bite out of him, they need to be prepared to lose one of their teeth.The meeting place was set up at a clearing in the forest. On a protruding bump of dirt, a woman dressed in Taoist robes, held a horsetail whisk and sat there quietly. The air surrounding her was calm and peaceful, and it seemed like she had blended together with the forest itself.When Xu ZiYan arrived there, he noticed that the atmosphere felt extremely strange. In addition, a sweet flowery scent filled the air.Everybody there sat on the ground in a relaxed manner. However, the closer Xu ZiYan got, the more he realized something was definitely wrong. Although everyone should already been strengthening relationships and pulling stray talents into their own groups during this crucial time, not a single person was speaking.In fact\u2026\u2026Xu ZiYan\u2019s back felt as if it was doused in cold water as he took a closer glance at the nearest person. The sitting teen was staring at nothing with completely blank eyes!\u201cBig brother!\u201d Xu ZiRong suddenly yelled. \u201cThe air\u2014\u2014\u201dIn a split second, the sweet scent disappeared as the Heavens and Earth spun. Immediately, Xu ZiYan felt his vision going black. When he opened his eyes next, he was already lying on a soft bed.It was only that his wrists and his ankles had been secured to the bed and a piece of cloth was stuffed in his mouth, making it impossible for him to move or speak. Xu ZiYan\u2019s gaze sharpened when he realized he could not even circulate any spiritual power. Was it because of his binds?\u201cOh, you\u2019re awake.\u201dSuddenly, a low voice sounded beside his ear. It was a voice both familiar to the extreme and unfamiliar to Xu ZiYan. Jerking up his head a bit, Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyes widened at what he saw: the person who had walked in was someone who looked like the older version of his little brother.However, Xu ZiYan\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Why did ZiRong look so much like a devil??? Was this the previous ZiRong, or\u2026\u2026had he failed in the end?Older Xu ZiRong walked over and caressed Xu ZiYan\u2019s cheek. He sighed a bit, the innocent and well-behaved look of his completely gone as his other hand began to pull on Xu ZiYan\u2019s clothes. \u201cBig brother, you look a bit uncomfortable. It\u2019s okay, later I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ll feel really good.\u201dFinally realizing that something was very wrong, Xu ZiYan began trying to struggle as Xu ZiRong got to his pants. The Blood Devil Lord didn\u2019t hesitate at all as he rid Xu ZiYan\u2019s clothes. When he saw how Xu ZiYan tried to close his legs in embarrassment though was unable to due to the binds on his ankles, Xu ZiRong smiled.\u201cYo, big brother, why are you covering that up? It\u2019s such a tiny thing, are you really afraid of letting ZiRong see it?\u201d Xu ZiRong broke into chuckles, before horridly flicking Xu ZiYan\u2019s little ZiYan in a teasing manner.Xu ZiYan: \u2026\u2026\u2026..[R-18 WARNING]In the short moment Xu ZiYan used to ponder where he had gone wrong raising this brother of his, he felt something cool finger a place that shouldn\u2019t be touched. It was wet and cold, but every place it touched left a sensation of burning. Before Xu ZiYan could even dodge that thing, it was already slipping in. With the final prize so close, Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t waste any time and easily found the place that made Xu ZiYan see stars.\u201cMmn!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s here, right?\u201d Xu ZiRong hummed a bit, looking completely nonplussed as he kept pressing that one area. His other hand started toying with the red jewels on Xu ZiYan\u2019s chest. Simultaneously stimulated like this, tears sprung to Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyes as he rode out the unceasing waves of pleasure. Suddenly, the cloth blocking his mouth was loosened as his muffled groans was released into the open air.\u201cAh! \u2026.Ah! Zi\u2026\u2026Ah! Ahn! Rong\u2026\u2026w-why\u2026\u2026mm!\u201dInstead of waiting for Xu ZiYan to finish asking his question, Xu ZiRong bent down to kiss him, swallowing all of his words and moans. Leisurely, Xu ZiRong\u2019s free hand released those poor red cherries and began reaching down to take off his own pants\u2026\u202611qwe44[R-18 Finishes!]And then Xu ZiYan combusts from overstimulation and from his thousands of questions and your translator/bad smut writer dies from shame.The end.................(Haha.

His expression looked extremely somber.That person\u2026\u2026 was actually this sensitive to blood\u2026\u2026He could not stay!Xu ZiYan was completely oblivious that the little brother he thought to be kind and obedient was currently pondering how to kill that guy from before.

On a protruding bump of dirt, a woman dressed in Taoist robes, held a horsetail whisk and sat there quietly. The air surrounding her was calm and peaceful, and it seemed like she had blended together with the forest itself.When Xu ZiYan arrived there, he noticed that the atmosphere felt extremely strange.Although the dozens of candidates looked rather scattered, you could still see some clumps here and there. The largest group was led by none other than Wei Qing. The teen dressed in a golden changpao seemed rather indifferent. Although one could tell that the two people beside him were currently trying to curry his favour, Wei Qing had a faint, impatient look on his face.In addition to Wei Qing\u2019s group, there were still a couple of others. The Xiahou Lian they met yesterday was also standing in the middle of a big group of her own. However, the moment Xiahou Lian saw Xu ZiYan, she excitedly waved her hand at him. To this gesture, Xu ZiYan felt faintly startled and reflexively gave her a smile.Xu ZiRong\u2019s expression looked gloomy to the point it was slightly terrifying. That damned woman actually dared to seduce his older brother! She could never be forgiven!Xiahou Lian\u2019s actions made a lot of people around her curious enough to look over. One must understand that Xiahou Lian was one of the most popular candidates in this examination. Someone who was capable of being treated like that by her, whoever it was, definitely couldn\u2019t be an ordinary person.Although Xu ZiYan was only fifteen years old, he was already nearly a hundred and eighty centimeters tall. With that tall height and his handsome appearance, he was capable of attracting almost everyone\u2019s gaze.And although the Xu ZiRong standing beside him was only eleven years old, he was unexpectedly pretty. Currently, his small and delicate face was filled with impatience. If he had been an adult, an expression like that would make everyone loathe him. However, on a child\u2019s face like his, people would only scream about how cute he was.\u201cWho is that?\u201d A gloomy-looking teenager stood not too far away as he coldly watched this scene. Lowering his voice, he asked the person beside him.That person seemed utterly overwhelmed and flattered by his question. Following his gaze, he blanked for a moment upon seeing Xu ZiYan as a trace of surprise flitted through his eyes. \u201cThat is Xu ZiYan. He was the one who just wounded Wu Xun from the Wu family. In fact, Wu Xun was wounded rather heavily this time. Even if he recovered, he would definitely still be affected.\u201dThis gloomy teenager, Hu YuTian, frowned slightly. He was aware of Wu Xun\u2019s strength. Wounding Wu Xun was enough to prove Xu ZiYan\u2019s abilities. Suddenly, Hu YuTian\u2019s expression didn\u2019t look that good. The candidates participating in this examination could all be considered hidden dragons and crouching tigers with how everyone was concealing their talent. Wei family\u2019s Wei Qing, Xiahou family\u2019s Xiahou Lian, and the rest of the candidates from the other families were all staring at each other like a tiger looking at his prey. Who would have thought that even a remote family like the Xu family would have a person like this?The person beside Hu YuTian took a few more glances at Xu ZiYan before carefully adding, \u201cThe person standing beside him is his younger brother. It\u2019s said that the relationship between the two of them is very good. In addition, his little brother is also very amazing. Although he has the Water, Wood, and Earth Tri-Spirit Vein, he is already at the eight layer of Qi Condensation Stage.\u201dHu YuTian\u2019s expression turned even more serious. With things as they were, it seemed like this year\u2019s examination would be much harder than he had originally thought.Hu family, Wei family, Xiahou family. Coming from big families like these, becoming an inner-sect disciple was pretty much already a done deal. Thus, their goals were placed on the top three places of the examination. To be more accurate, they were after one of the rewards for the top three places, the one that allowed them to enter Qilin Tower.Although it was possible to obtain the eligibility to enter Qilin Tower after they entered the sect, the difficulty of that\u2026\u2026Hu YuTian rubbed the bracelet circling his wrist as his expression eased up. His talent was not inferior to the others, and he had been just as hardworking. Hu YuTian did not believe he would not be able to obtain one of the top three places!Xu ZiYan found some open space to sit down. Before he sat, the teenager rather thoughtfully took out a handkerchief and placed it on the spot beside him.Seeing this, Xu ZiRong\u2019s mood became a bit better. Sure enough, his older brother was always thinking about him.At this place, Xu ZiYan\u2019s identity wasn\u2019t some kind of secret. After all, the intelligence networks of those influential families weren\u2019t incompetent.In reality, after Xu ZiYan registered yesterday, information regarding him had already been placed onto the desks of many people. Xu ZiYan knew this as well, but he simply doesn\u2019t care. The strength of Xu family was still too small, and their intelligence network wasn\u2019t large enough to extend to Fa An City. Thus, toward the situation here, Xu ZiYan was completely just going in blind. Fortunately, he was able to take advantage of the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories.\u2018Tut, the Wei Qing over there still has that stinky face on. He\u2019s only a few years older than ZiRong, so how is he this uncute? That young girl Xiahou Lian doesn\u2019t seem to be a simple character, so it\u2019s a pity the original Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t have much contact with her in his previous life. Ah, the person beside Hu YuTian looks a bit familiar\u2026\u2026ah, right. Isn\u2019t that the rat that specializes in selling information? Hehe, currently, he shouldn\u2019t have developed yet. Let\u2019s wait and find an opportunity to gain his loyalty.\u2019Xu ZiYan recovered his gaze in a seemingly careless manner. The original Xu ZiYan had an impression of many people here, but unfortunately his relationship with them was very ordinary.However, it was understandable if one thought about it. For the original Xu ZiYan, he had been raised to such a high pedestal in the Xu family. It was only when he arrived at the Liu Guang Sect did the original Xu ZiYan find out that his strength had been super ordinary. The genius of Xu family was nothing in the Liu Guang Sect. His strength could barely be ranked at the lower end of the top disciples, but it was a joke if he was compared to those super geniuses.This huge gap between their strengths made the original Xu ZiYan struggle to accept the facts. He wanted to be haughty, but he didn\u2019t have the qualifications to be haughty anymore. No wonder he thought everyone he saw was displeasing to his eyes, and followed his Master every day.However, Xu ZiYan wasn\u2019t a young child. He was very clear on just how important the relationships between people could be. It was impossible for him to be on friendly terms with everyone there, but picking a fraction of the people to associate with was still no problem.\u201cBig brother, what are you thinking about?\u201d Xu ZiRong asked with a face full of curiosity.The Blood Devil Lord was very curious. This was the first time he ever saw big brother expose this kind of \u2014\u2014 calculating expression. Just, he didn\u2019t know who exactly his big brother was scheming for?\u201cNot much,\u201d Xu ZiYan rubbed the Blood Devil Lord\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when ZiRong grows up a bit more.\u201dXu ZiRong wasn\u2019t that happy with this answer but he did not reveal his emotions on his face. His current image was a clever and obedient little brother. Although he was rather indifferent when facing other people, toward his older brother he would never say anything.This was the character he molded with meticulous care, one that was most able to rouse Xu ZiYan\u2019s desire to be a good older brother. Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t want Xu ZiYan to become suspicious of him just because of some curiosity.As time passed, more people arrived at the meeting place.An interesting thing was that many of these people had wounds on their body. They all hatefully glared at the people who had sneak attacked them, but they didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of complaining to that female Taoist. Apparently, they seemed to have come to terms with the fact that they had suffered losses.\u201cDamn! Who ambushed me!!!\u201dUnfortunately, not everyone could accept this result. Someone protested.A fat person wearing gorgeous clothes rushed out of the forest before fiercely swepting his eyes over the people gathered there. It was as if he had wanted to find the person who had ambushed him.Everyone\u2019s gazes concentrated on him, making the fat person feel a bit uncomfortable. This was because it seemed as if everyone looking at him had a hint of a ridiculing smile in their eyes.However, the moment he thought of his misfortune, he immediately became bold and self-confident as he angrily roared, \u201cWho exactly was the bastard who ambushed me?! If you have the guts then step up!\u201d\u201cWhat will happen if they don\u2019t step up?\u201d A voice similar to the sound of ringing silver bells suddenly asked in a curious manner.\u201cIf they don\u2019t step up I\u2019ll slaughter them!\u201d The fat man answered in a shout.That voice continued to ask, \u201cBut if they don\u2019t step up then you won\u2019t know who they are. If you don\u2019t know who they are, how are you going to slaughter them?\u201dThe fat man was suddenly speechless. He turned around to stare in the voice\u2019s direction.When he saw who was speaking, he immediately became dazed. It had been a young, eleven or twelve year old girl. She was wearing a pink dress with fluffy pompoms sewn on it. With a round face and big eyes, the sweet smile on her blushing face made it hard for anyone who saw her to not feel fondness.\u201cHey, you still haven\u2019t replied to me. If you don\u2019t know who they are, how are you going to slaughter them?\u201d That young girl didn\u2019t seem satisfied with the fat man\u2019s dazed look. She continued to pester him with her question.\u201cI\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026\u201d The fat man stuttered for a bit and couldn\u2019t say anything as his face flushed bright red.\u201cTut, this is so boring,\u201d the young girl curled her lip in a pout as he face filled with disdain. Suddenly, she fished out a small and deep green snake from who knows where and placed it in her palm. \u201cBi Yun, look at this guy. He\u2019s so stupid. In the future I actually have to be in the same Sect as him, I\u2019m practically throwing away all my face1.\u201d\u201cSssss\u2026\u2026\u201d The small deep green snake named Bi Yun exposed its tongue as it began to emit a dangerous hissing sound.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Anyone who was capable of standing there were all naturally the elites of their various families and clans. Thus, the moment they saw that small snake, everyone immediately recognized that it was a highly toxic type of demonic beast.If someone got bitten by that thing, their bodies would be feeble and weak for a long time even if they managed to promptly obtain the antidote. Although that girl looked quite adorable on the surface, one could tell from her proficient technique at managing the snake that she wasn\u2019t as harmless as her appearance suggested.\u201cBi Yun, ah, I don\u2019t want to be tested together with this idiot. Wouldn\u2019t it be better if you just go over and give him a bite? Is that okay?\u201d The little girl had an innocent and naive expression on her face as she consulted her snake.The onlookers standing around them couldn\u2019t help their expressions from freezing. The gaze they used to look at the little girl also immediately changed. Without a doubt, this young girl was also a dangerous character.In their hearts, many people slapped a mark of importance onto this girl.\u201cYou! What are you saying?!\u201d The fat man looked extremely angry. He had also thought that this girl was very cute, but he never would have thought she dared to say something like that. This meant she was completely looking down on him!\u201cTut tut, not only he\u2019s dumb, but even his ears have hearing problems. Poor him,\u201d the little girl didn\u2019t even lift her head and continued to face her snake as she said those words.The fat man was so angry, his face became completely red. Immediately, he swung his fist at that little girl.The little girl looked as though she didn\u2019t hear anything. She didn\u2019t even lift her eyes, as if she completely didn\u2019t see the fat man charging toward her.BANG!A second before the fat man\u2019s hand touched the little girl, his body got blasted away. The calm-looking woman in daoist clothes slowly opened her eyes before stating, \u201cNo one is allowed to fight here.\u201dStaring at the daoist woman in fear, the fat man cut a sorry figure as he crawled up from the ground. He never would have thought that the Liu Guang Sect member responsible for welcoming them would actually make a move. Thus, at the moment the fat man was truly frightened. He was afraid that his actions would make the woman disqualify him.The fat man\u2019s family background was almost the same as Xu ZiYan\u2019s, for he was also the child of a remote cultivation family. However, the education he received was obviously not up to par. He completely did not know that there were some people he couldn\u2019t afford to anger.The people surrounding them started staring at the fat man with a gaze filled with concentrated ridicule. Anyone keen could tell that the daoist woman who was here to welcome them had directed her words to the little girl. And for those people standing a bit closer, they were able to clearly see how the blue scorpion in the girl\u2019s hand quickly withdrew into her sleeve after the woman blasted the fat man away.blue-scorpionThat scorpion wasn\u2019t even as big as a person\u2019s palm, but its body emitted rays of blue light. It wasn\u2019t hard for someone to guess that this thing was probably quite poisonous. However, the funny thing was that the fat man actually thought that the daoist woman made her move to protect the little girl.Xu ZiYan watched this lively show from afar. This scene and the one in the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories were exactly the same. In addition, this fat man would be quickly eliminated in the competition later. However, that little girl was indeed like the one in his memories\u2026\u2026ah, so arrogant.Xu ZiYan took a look at the Xu ZiRong sitting beside him and immediately felt comforted. Sure enough, his little brother was the best! Xu ZiRong was both obedient and thoughtful. Compared to that little girl, he was truly levels better.After resting for a while, the deadline to make it there had arrived\u2014\u2014The woman from Liu Guang Sect who was responsible for welcoming them slowly stood up as her sharp eyes swept over everyone.The people who had been touched by her gaze couldn\u2019t help their backs from turning cold as an inexplicable chilliness covered their hearts. The arrogant people who hadn\u2019t thought much of this woman immediately restrained the expressions on their faces. Originally, they had thought that the person responsible for welcoming them was just a high ranking older-apprentice sister. However, with this scene, they could confirm that this woman was a cultivator with at least Meridian Condensation Stage cultivation.\u201cSince you\u2019re already all here, then let us start,\u201d when the daoist woman expressionlessly finished talking, she threw out a piece of yellow paper. The yellow paper was stimulated by the wind and ignited. After releasing a high pitched sound, it swiftly turned to dust.After completing all of that, the daoist woman coldly swept her eyes over everyone again. \u201cStarting from this moment on, you are all Liu Guang Sect\u2019s potential disciples. In the examination later, you are forbidden from killing each other. If anyone violates this rule, they will be evicted!\u201dAfter she finished talking, the woman lept into the air. Suddenly, a white, red-crowned crane appeared out of nowhere and caught the woman on its back. Just like that, the crane flew swiftly as it carried the woman away.Everyone left behind began staring at each other in dismay. They didn\u2019t understand what that woman meant by doing this. She hadn\u2019t even told them the details of the examination, so how were they supposed to take this test?However, their doubts over this didn\u2019t last for long. Shortly after that woman had disappeared, a loud roar was heard from position far away from them.Every participant\u2019s face immediately changed. Although they knew that the roar was coming from a very far distance, it was still enough to shake a lot of people\u2019s hearts. Just that was enough to determine that the demonic beast who made this roar was extremely strong.Xu ZiYan swiftly stood up before pulling Xu ZiRong into the group of people. Stimulated by this roar, everyone spontaneously started to crowd together. Although this might not necessarily have any effect, having more people automatically strengthened a lot of people\u2019s courage.In reality, Xu ZiYan knew that the person who had almost arrived was their next examiner, and that the beast which emitted the previous roar was their examiner\u2019s mount. However, he didn\u2019t want anyone to discover that he already knew this secret, and thus decided to simply stand together with everyone else.Within a few moments, the presence of the beast that had emitted the huge roar began to approach them. A few people who stood at the edges of the crowd couldn\u2019t help but begin pulling out their weapons.Between the trees of the forest, everyone could already vaguely see that huge demonic beast. Thus, people began feeling as though their hearts were stuck in their throats. Although everybody had already guessed that this was part of Liu Guang Sect\u2019s test, if this happened to actually be a random demonic beast, then everyone there would probably end up in this beast\u2019s stomach.BOOM!This muffled noise immediately made all the extremely tense teenagers erupt. The people standing at the edges of the crowd couldn\u2019t help but attack in all sort of styles and manners before they even managed to clearly see the figure of the demonic beast.Everyone there were at the Qi Condensation Stage. Thus, although the attacks they performed were colourful and beautiful, to the demonic beast they were no different than someone tickling it.However, the demonic beast seemed to have been provoked by their attacks, for it opened its mouth and emitted an angry roar. The people standing in front of the beast were immediately hit by a fishy stench that almost made them faint. Therefore, their actions became even more urgent, like they were itching to beat back the beast.\u201cAh!\u201d The young boy standing closest to the beast let out a blood-curdling scream. That huge demonic beast opened its mouth again before it faced the young boy to bite off his head.At this critical moment, that young boy was so scared, he actually fainted. He toppled to the side, completely unconscious.\u201cWah!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dOther than that unlucky young boy, there were a lot of different people who let out muffled screams. Everyone who let out a sound had almost all been knocked down. This was because, at some undetermined time, many cultivators wearing black clothes and a black mask appeared at their sides.\u201cTut tut, you guys are only at this level but you still have the guts to come to the inner-sect disciple exam?\u201d A buff man with red hair slowly walked out of the woods. There was an obvious sneer hanging at the corner of his mouth.He coldly stared at the dozen or so teenagers before he raised his hand and pointed at a few. \u201cYou, you, and you. Your reactions weren\u2019t bad.\u201d Hearing that, everyone\u2019s gaze couldn\u2019t help but concentrate on the few people he had pointed at.Unsurprisingly, the three people he had pointed at were Wei Qing, Hu YuTian and Xiahou Lian.After he pointed out and praised those three, the red haired buff man once again pointed at those cultivators covered in black. He began to loudly explain, \u201cThese people are all your senior-apprentice brothers and sisters. They are also your enemies for this exam. However, you guys can rest assured, for their strength will be limited to the Qi Condensation Stage. The moment they use strength that is considered to be above the Qi Condensation Stage cultivation, they will lose.\u201dThose people wearing black all gave the teenagers a smile filled with maliciousness\u2026\u2026when they were taking this exam in the past, they had all been reduced to a miserable state by the teachings of their past senior-apprentice brothers and sisters. Now, they finally had a chance to get some revenge!Meanwhile, that huge, black leopard finally moved away from that young boy who had fainted from fear. Its golden pupils were full of a joking manner.The buff man glanced at that young boy before snorting coldly. \u201cTruly useless.\u201d He waved his hand and a black clothed cultivator from the crowd of people strode out. And then\u2014\u2014they slapped the young boy twice.When this person (who knew if it was their senior-apprentice brother or their senior-apprentice sister) made their move, it had been quick, accurate, and ruthless. After these two slaps, that young boy\u2019s face became immediately swollen. However, he also began to slowly wake up.The red haired buff man frowned. All the participants thought he was unhappy with the black clothed person\u2019s ruthless behaviour, but they would never have guessed that he would instead say, \u201cWhy did you hit his face? When we send him out later, the people there are gonna complain again. Why couldn\u2019t you just hit his stomach? In any case, there\u2019s clothing there to cover everything up!\u201dAll the teenagers there felt a wave of chilliness washing over their heart. Their gazes as they stared at the red haired buff man seemed similar to as if they were looking at a devil instead. Although the black clothed person bowed their head and looked as if they were acknowledging their mistake, they couldn\u2019t help but roll their eyes under the cover of their mask. They thought: Ghost Martial Uncle Ye was trying to scare people again!Next, the red haired buff man made a gesture and the black clothed people immediately separated themselves from the crowd of candidates before standing in two rows. The amount of black clothed people seemed about the same as the number of exam candidates, so there was probably a black clothed person responsible for every participant.The black clothed person who had woken up the young boy returned to the two rows. On the other hand, the young boy still hadn\u2019t woken up completely. Instead, he blankly stared at his surroundings in confusion.\u201cYou were eliminated,\u201d after casually saying those words, the red haired buff man stopped caring about the boy who had failed and instead turned toward the other candidates.The remaining participants were all frightened by those words he had said in such a light tone. They were all mentally wondering: just this and he was eliminated?As if he had seen the doubts hidden in their hearts, the red haired buff man raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m your examiner for this round. Should this waste of a person, one who can actually faint from fright because of a demonic beast, enter the Liu Guang Sect, then it\u2019s practically an insult to me.\u201dEveryone\u2019s hearts stiffened a bit. Although they all seemed calm on the outside, every teen there started mentally calculating and thinking up plans.The red haired buff man no longer paid attention to them. Instead, he gave Xu ZiYan a pondering glance before straightforwardly pointing his finger at Xu ZiYan and hooking it in a come-hither gesture.Xu ZiYan helplessly rubbed his nose. He didn\u2019t think he would be discovered this quickly.When they saw Xu ZiYan get ordered to come out, some people in the crowd revealed surprised expressions. The rest of the people looked as if they were rejoicing in his misfortune. After all, this Xu ZiYan\u2019s strength was very good. If he could also be eliminated, then it meant that their own rankings might rise by a bit.Within Liu Guang Sect\u2019s entry exam for inner-sect disciples, every advance in rank would mean a better reward. Although these rewards couldn\u2019t compare to the rewards of the top three rankings, for everyone there they were already considerably impressive.Could it be\u2026\u2026had Xu ZiYan offended the examiner?Wei Qing watched Xu ZiYan walk out with a cold gaze, however, his heart was quite puzzled.Xiahou Lian looked completely bewildered while Hu TianYu looked pleasantly surprised. To Hu TianYu, whether or not it was Xiahou Lian or Wei Qing or even Xu ZiYan, they were all his rivals. If one of them could get knocked out before the actual exam, then it was really too favorable for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Other people didn\u2019t know why he had been called out, but to him the reason had been clear.A moment ago, when the team of black-clothed cultivators took the opportunity to sneak attack while everyone\u2019s attention had been occupied by the demonic beast, the majority of candidates had fallen into their traps. However, with Xu ZiRong\u2019s assistance, Xu ZiYan had discovered their presences ahead of time and thus silently plotted against the black-clothed cultivator that had charged his way.At this very moment, a certain person standing in the middle of the black-clothed cultivators was currently gnashing his teeth as he glared at Xu ZiYan. He completely didn\u2019t expect this, ah! Qilian HongYun was always running around provoking cats and teasing dogs, never knowing his own place. So, he never would have expected that he would lose his face1 in front of everyone today.That damned, smelly kid was simply too treacherous. He didn\u2019t know how the other had discovered him, but the kid had unexpectedly made a move against him before he himself managed to. At that time, don\u2019t talk about trying to sneak attack Xu ZiYan, Qilian HongYun almost lost even more face and collapsed right there. Fortunately, the Liu Qi beside him had supported himself a bit, or else he would have really lost all his face and honour in front of his future junior-apprentice brothers and sisters.Currently, Qilian HongYun\u2019s right leg was so numb, he practically couldn\u2019t feel it. He really hadn\u2019t expected that a Qi Condensation Stage kid would actually have such a formidable lightning style attack.Qilian HongYun saw how Xu ZiYan wasn\u2019t panicking at all and couldn\u2019t help but want to vomit blood. He was a big, wild goose, however, he had been pecked in the eye until he became blind by a goose duckling. This kid! Alright! Qilian HongYun would remember him!The red haired buff man called Xu ZiYan out and patted his shoulder, \u201cNot bad, even your senior-apprentice brother couldn\u2019t keep you under control. I\u2019ll give you a bonus point.\u201d After he finished talking, he turned his head to face the other people and stopped paying attention to Xu ZiYan.Every candidate\u2019s expression suddenly changed. Although they didn\u2019t know what this one point represented, it was clear that this examiner had a very good impression of Xu ZiYan.The red haired buff man\u2019s gaze revealed a trace of a smile. Then, he deliberately turned his face emotionlessly cold as he told the exam participants, \u201cTo reach Liu Guang Sect from here, it will take about three days. Three days later, before yinshi2, those who have not yet arrived at Liu Guang Sect or those who do not have two points will all be eliminated.\u201d When he finished talking, he paused for a moment before lifting his hand. Then, he threw out a bunch of jade pendants that were radiating a faint red colour. All of the candidates held one in their hands, but unexpectedly, Xu ZiYan possessed two.\u201cThis jade pendant represents your identity, and it also represents one point,\u201d the red haired buff man raised one finger. \u201cCorrespondingly, your senior-apprentice brothers and sisters also have a jade pendant, although they\u2019re green. They also represent one point.\u201dThe red haired buff man laughed very fiercely, \u201cYour goal this time is to defeat your senior-apprentice brothers and sisters to steal their jade pendants. Of course, your objective isn\u2019t merely just this. If your own jade pendants are snatched away by your senior-apprentice brothers and sisters, you don\u2019t have to be too worried. You can just go and steal someone else\u2019s. Now\u2014\u2014\u201dHe swept his gaze over everyone before suddenly wrinkling his forehead. \u201cMark the jade pendants with an imprint of your soul.\u201d Everyone left their soul imprints onto their pendants according to the red haired buff man\u2019s instructions.\u201cAfter you return to Liu Guang Sect, I will be checking your jade pendants. If you still have your own pendant, that would be one point. If you snatched a green pendant, that will also be one point. If you stole another candidate\u2019s red pendant\u2014\u2014\u201d When he said that, he paused slightly before continuing. \u201cThree red pendants from other candidates will equal one point.\u201dAll the candidates suddenly made a commotion. Although the content of every inner-disciple exam for Liu Guang Sect was different, it was obvious that this year\u2019s exam was much more cut-throat. Apart from having to be careful of sneak attacks from their future senior-apprentice brothers and sisters, they also had to pay attention to attacks from their fellow participants.That buff man had said things so clearly: if they lost their own pendant, they could steal someone else\u2019s. In other words, while fighting with other people, even if you lose, one had to try their best to maintain their combat strength. This way, they would still have a chance to bully other weaker candidates afterwards.Nobody there was stupid. Although three red jade pendants equaled one point, if one compared a senior-apprentice brother or sister who had suppressed their strength to the Qi Condensation Stage to a candidate whose strength was originally only at the seventh or eighth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, the candidate would of course be easier to bully.The buff examiner didn\u2019t pay attention to the candidate\u2019s discussions. Instead, he turned around to smile at Xu ZiYan.Those candidates noticed who he was gazing at and gradually quieted down.\u201cKid, you\u2019re pretty lucky. Both of these red jade pendants of yours represent your identity. In other words, you already have two points. As long as you move quickly, perhaps you would be able to reach Liu Guang Sect before your senior-apprentice brothers and sisters catch up to you.\u201d The red-haired buff man smiled very sinisterly.Xu ZiYan could only force out a helpless, bitter smile. Didn\u2019t he only sneak-attacked that senior-apprentice brother or sister before they could do the same to him? Mister Examiner, why are you doing this to set me up?When that red-haired buff examiner said that, the gazes the other candidates used to look at Xu ZiYan all became extremely fierce. If only this happened, Xu ZiYan could let it pass. However, the problem was that even the gazes of those black-clothed senior-apprentice brothers and sisters started looking a bit weird.The reason the examiner said this was obviously to help Xu ZiYan accumulate some hatred. Now, whether it was the other candidates or the black-clothed senior-apprentice brothers and sisters, Xu ZiYan was afraid that they had all made him their target.Because of this, he felt pretty depressed. This examiner was really being too mean. In the (past) Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories, he clearly remembered that this examiner was pretty normal. Who knew he was actually this demented? If Xu ZiYan had known earlier, he would have just followed Wei Qing and the other two\u2019s actions and just stopped the black-clothed person\u2019s attack. Why would he insist on courting disaster before falling into a pit like this\u2026\u2026\u201cAh, right, I forgot to say this,\u201d the red-haired buff man seemed to have suddenly thought of something. \u201cTwo points mean you pass. However, like all marks and scores, it has always been the more the better. In addition, the first candidate who reaches the Liu Guang Sect will be able to obtain a bonus ten points. And then the second person will receive nine points. The bonus points will gradually decrease in order like this. These points will be your basis for when you begin the second exam. In short, they certainly won\u2019t bring you any harm. Good luck, ah!\u201dAfter the examiner finished talking, he waved his hand and allowed the candidates enter the forest one after another. Their future senior-apprentice brothers and sisters could only start moving one shichen3 after they leave. This could also be considered as giving them an opportunity to run a bit further away.Xu ZiYan was incomparably sullen as he entered the forest with Xu ZiRong. He didn\u2019t even have to look and he could already feel the burning gazes that were concentrated on him.Ah, forget about it. Although this was an unexpected mishap, this could also be considered as a good chance to for his strength to grow. In the future, should Xu ZiYan wish to create a huge organization backed with power, necessary strength would be the foundation for everything.This was the same as Mo ZiYuan\u2019s circumstances in the original novel. Don\u2019t just look at how his Moyu Long Court was flourishing everywhere in the Xuan Yu region. If Mo ZiYuan\u2019s strength was insufficient, then the Moyu Long Court trading company would just be a fat cash cow ready to be slaughtered. The more money Mo ZiYuan earned, the quicker he would die.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Xu ZiYan pulled Xu ZiRong\u2019s hand and entered the forest with a body flicker. Perhaps it was because the two of them both studied Xu family\u2019s escaping art, thus, even though Xu ZiRong was only at the eight layer of Qi Condensation Stage, he was still completely capable of keeping up with Xu ZiYan\u2019s speed.Xu family\u2019s escaping art wasn\u2019t some kind of superb martial art technique. The speed was merely ordinary, but the two of them was travelling in the forest as fast as possible. Xu ZiYan was half-pulling Xu ZiRong forward so it would be convenient for the younger to both save energy and probe their surroundings.\u201cBig brother, west, fifty steps ahead,\u201d Xu ZiRong spoke softly.Xu ZiYan\u2019s gaze sharpened. Sure enough, it came. That deceptive red haired examiner had only opened his red lips and white teeth to speak, but it sure brought him an endless inconvenience.Lightly sighing once, Xu ZiYan decisively took out his bow. Next, a purple arrow made out of lightning violently shot out. Rumbling, it penetrated the wide trunk of a tree before leaving behind a huge hole.untitledrHm?Xu ZiYan was quite surprised. His attack actually didn\u2019t succeed?\u201cThey ran,\u201d Xu ZiRong furrowed his forehead slightly.\u201cIf they ran then let\u2019s forget about them. We don\u2019t have time to deal with them. In this test, there are only a few candidates that pose a threat to us. Those senior-apprentice brothers and sisters are the ones who are the most dangerous.\u201dXu ZiYan rubbed his nose. \u201cIf I had known earler, I wouldn\u2019t have taken the initiative to make a move before. Tut tut, that examiner is so petty.\u201dXu ZiRong couldn\u2019t help but lightly smile. Every now and then, he would sometimes think that his older brother was actually quite cute\u2026\u2026\u201cDang! So dangerous ah\u2026\u2026\u201d A thin youth lightly stroke his chest with a face full of fright. \u201cLuckily I had ran fast enough. Otherwise, if I had to suffer that attack, I would certainly be done for.\u201d\u201cTut tut, where the heck did this Xu ZiYan come from? Mo New Town\u2019s Xu family? I have never heard of them before ah.\u201d That thin youth talked to himself in a distressed tone.\u201cOh well. Sure enough, anyone capable of being here for Liu Guang Sect\u2019s inner-disciple exam aren\u2019t easy to deal with. This Xu ZiYan\u2019s senses are too sharp, I can\u2019t afford to offend him, can\u2019t afford to offend him.\u201d The thin youth quickly helped himself find enough reasons as to why he shouldn\u2019t provoke Xu ZiYan, before firmly abandoning that goal.He lazily stretched before looking around. \u201cI wonder if those senior-apprentice brothers and sisters left yet? Fighting against them seems to be a better plan. In the very least, it\u2019s unlikely they would kill or injure me too badly.\u201dAfter the thin youth said this, his nose suddenly twitched. With his expression changing, his body leaned backward onto a tree trunk before he quietly disappeared.A few breaths later, a gloomy-looking teenager suddenly appeared. He looked around with a puzzled expression, \u201cStrange, how did they suddenly disappear? Forget it, let\u2019s look for the next one.\u201d When he finished talking, his figure flickered and he disappeared.The forest sank into silence. After a long while, that gloomy-looking teenager once again flickered there and appeared. He vigilantly checked his surroundings. However, from the beginning to the end, he never managed to find his target. Finally, he had no other choice but to give up, looking slightly unwilling as he departed.After another period of time, that thin youth\u2019s body slowly emerged once more. This time, he practically didn\u2019t even dare to breath big breathes. After leaving that place with light footsteps, he ran very far away before letting out a sigh of relief. Then, he couldn\u2019t help but curse, \u201cIsn\u2019t this f*cking too exaggerated! Everybody is this powerful, how do you expect people like me to live on, ah?!\u201dAngrily flapping his sleeves, his figure disappeared again\u2026\u2026All of these candidates were child prodigies. The moment the examiner explained how three red jade pendants from other candidates equalled one point, almost everyone started to make their own plans.Capture three unlucky guys, force them to give up their jade pendants, and then rush toward Liu Guang Sect at their fastest speed to snatch the first place in this assessment.At least half of the candidates had this kind of plan. This was why there were already people losing their jade pendants right after they had entered the forest, even before those senior-apprentice brothers and sisters had set off.If your own jade pendant was gone, then naturally you had to go and steal someone else\u2019s. In a short period of time, a bunch of the candidates had already fought against each other. A small number of the candidates with the worse strength hadn\u2019t even walked far before they had lost their own jade pendants. In addition, with their strength, it would be extremely hard for them to be able to snatch someone else\u2019s.What was even more frustrating was that within these candidates, there was actually someone who was actually proficient at the \u2018petty thief\u2019 art. This was great for them because there was a restriction seal on these jade pendants, so it wasn\u2019t possible for anyone to place them within their inter-spatial bags. Thus, the candidates could only keep their pendants on their bodies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If they placed the jade pendants into their inter-spacial bags and refused to take them out no matter how badly their opponents beat them up, then this part of the exam would have lost its meaning. After all, candidates were forbidden from killing each other.The fat man who had lost a lot of face from before was currently squatting in a corner and crying his eyes out. He was precisely one of those poor souls who had already lost his jade pendant\u2026\u2026in addition, perhaps it was because he didn\u2019t have much experience, but he had also managed to get lost in the forest.He lost his jade pendant and then got lost in the forest. The chances of him passing this part of the assessment was basically next to none. After losing all of his hope, he could only rely on sobbing to vent out his extreme depression.When the red-haired examiner who had been monitoring that area saw this scene, he felt completely helpless. It was truly the first time he had ever seen a candidate like this.Although the examiner felt some sympathy for this guy, he still found someone to send that fat man out of the assessment zone. For that fat man, his path to being an inner-sect disciple ended here. If he was lucky enough, perhaps he would still become one of Liu Guang Sect\u2019s outer-sect disciples.One shichen1 passed very quickly. Those black-clothed cultivators were all very energetic as they hopefully looked toward the red-haired buff man.The examiner laughed before waving his hand. \u201cGo ahead. Give those little rascals a lesson. Let them thoroughly understand the teachings of their future senior-apprentice brothers and sisters!\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d All of the black-clothed cultivators responded in an excited tone before they began rushing toward that forest filled with prey.Almost all of those black-clothed cultivators began following the trails left by the exam candidates. However, one cultivator didn\u2019t leave.The red-haired examiner stared at the stationary black-clothed cultivator in astonishment. He was extremely familiar with these disciples, to the point where he could distinguish them based on their aura alone. \u201cHongYun, what are you doing? Don\u2019t you want to find that kid and take revenge?\u201dQilian HongYun could only smile bitterly. \u201cMartial Uncle Ye Gui, my leg is still numb\u2026\u2026\u201dThis time, the red-haired buff man was truly surprised. He walked over and gave Qilian HongYun a push. This resulted in the younger man immediately sitting down. Previously, it hadn\u2019t been easy for him to maintain his facade. Thankfully, he could finally rest now.Ye Gui inserted his spiritual energy into Qilian HongYun\u2019s leg before circulating it. Immediately, he revealed a shocked expression as he said, \u201cThat kid isn\u2019t someone normal. His lightning spiritual energy actually integrated itself into your blood before following your bloodstream and flowing throughout your whole body.\u201dQilian HongYun suddenly saw the light and immediately understood. \u201cI thought it was strange! At first only my ankle was numb, but now my whole leg is completely numb.\u201dYe Gui was extremely puzzled. Lightning spiritual attacks were indeed very strong, and it was normal for them to cause numbness after a person was hit. However, he had never heard of someone being able to integrate lightning spiritual energy into a person\u2019s blood. After thinking about it, though, there were thousands of strange and different martial art techniques in the world. In addition, each one of them had different side-effects. If he hadn\u2019t heard of it before, it may be because he didn\u2019t have enough worldly experience. Thus, what was he doing being so puzzled over this?Ye Gui held Qilian HongYun\u2019s ankle before injecting fire spiritual energy into the other\u2019s leg in an unsophisticated manner. His powerful spiritual energy began forcing away the lightning spiritual energy contained in Qilian HongYun\u2019s blood bit by bit. This was so painful for Qilian HongYun, he couldn\u2019t help but screaming. However, Ye Gui didn\u2019t pull back until the very last drop of lightning spiritual energy was expelled from the younger man\u2019s blood.\u201cMartial Uncle\u2026\u2026I haven\u2019t offended you lately, have I?\u201d Qilian HongYun practically had tears streaming down his face. Although Ye Gui\u2019s method was very effective, it hurt like hell alright!!Ye Gui snorted coldly. \u201cYou actually have the nerve to say that? You fell into a kid\u2019s trap, and he hasn\u2019t even entered the Sect yet. I think, instead of calling you Qilian HongYun, we should call you Loser Qilian from now on.\u201dQilian HongYun looked wronged. \u201cHow would I know that kid was so powerful? Really, Martial Uncle, I still have no idea how he found me.\u201d When he got to this topic, his face looked completely serious. \u201cI could tell from the speed he used to make his move that he found me way before I got near to him. Otherwise, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have been able to react in time.\u201d\u201cYou mean, your concealing skills aren\u2019t good enough and thus you got discovered ahead of time?\u201d Ye Gui smiled grimly.A gloomy cloud floated over Qilian HongYun\u2019s head as he found a corner to draw some circles in the ground. No matter what he said now, he had already fallen into that kid\u2019s trap. It didn\u2019t matter how it had happened, but the fact that he had fallen into the trap was indisputable.untitledpp\u201cAfter this examination, go to the Practice Hall and stay there for half a year!\u201d Ye Gui said, looking as if he was hating iron for not becoming steel.\u201cNooo! Martial Uncle!!! Don\u2019t be like this!!!\u201d Qilian HongYun immediately began crying as he threw himself forward in an attempt to hug Ye Gui\u2019s leg. Unfortunately, the older man had long been prepared. After a body flicker, that very leg Qilian HongYun had wanted to hug had already kicked the younger man flying.Ye Gui\u2019s black leopard roared once before revealing a very human-like expression, one that looked as if he was enjoying Qilian HongYun\u2019s misfortune. In his heart, the leopard thought: this kid should have long been sent to the Practice Hall! After the last time where he had cut off the nicest fur on the end of his tail, Owner should have already made him go!\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d Ye Gui gave Qilian HongYun a glare. \u201cThat kid is with his younger brother. Since you\u2019re suppressing your cultivation level to the Qi Condensation Stage, you might not be able to defeat them!\u201dWhen he saw how his Martial Uncle had once again mentioned the kid that made him lose face, Qilian HongYun immediately rolled his sleeves up for battle as he became more spirited. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Martial Uncle. I\u2019ll make sure to finish that kid off this time!\u201d After he said that, however, his tone immediately changed. \u201cMartial Uncle, if I finish that kid off, please don\u2019t make me go to the Practice Hall\u2026\u2026\u201dYe Gui sneered. \u201cGo and finish him off before trying to discuss that with me. If you don\u2019t manage to take revenge, then the time you have to spend in the Practice Hall will double!\u201dQilian HongYun\u2019s eyes brightened before he immediately said with a spirited voice, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Martial Uncle! I\u2019ll make sure to properly give that kid a lesson about what it means to respect your elders. He even dared to harm his senior-apprentice brother, he truly needs to be thoroughly educated!\u201dAfter he finished talking, with a body flicker, Qilian HongYun charged into the woods and disappeared.\u201cRoar!\u201d The black leopard howled in dissatisfaction. Originally, he had been looking forward to that guy suffering in the Practice Hall. Why did his Owner let him off so easily?Ye Gui smiled slightly before patting the black leopard\u2019s head. \u201cOld pal, don\u2019t worry. That kid isn\u2019t someone who could be easily pushed around. This time, I\u2019m afraid Qilian\u2019s gonna end up kicking an iron plate.\u201dThe black leopard\u2019s eyes swirled before he understood Ye Gui\u2019s meaning. Immediately, his mood improved. He stuck out his tongue to lick Ye Gui\u2019s hand before he left to find the mountain\u2019s little leopard sister\u2026\u2026Ye Gui didn\u2019t plan to continue staying there either, thus, his figure quickly disappeared. This time, he had to pick out a few good seedlings from this year\u2019s candidates. After all, his Master had the intentions of accepting one last disciple this year.The battles in the forest continued. The weaker the candidate, the more they wanted to get three jade pendants before rushing toward Liu Guang Sect at their fastest speed. This wasn\u2019t completely because of the benefits they would get if they were first. More importantly, they didn\u2019t have the confidence to steal jade pendants from those super geniuses or their future senior-apprentice brothers and sisters.In addition, if they were too slow, there was a great possibility of being targeted by those senior-apprentice brothers and sisters. If they managed to lose their own jade pendant, then trying to find six red pendants would almost be impossible.The candidates with the seventh and eighth layer of Qi Condensation Stage had similar strength. Even if they prepared an ambush in advance, the result of their battles would be hard to predict.Some people who were quite quick managed to get three more red pendants and thus started rushing toward Liu Guang Sect. However, what they did not know was that while they were fighting it out with opponents that were similar in strength to them, someone else was already waiting for them as they blocked their path.Although there were many different ways of getting to Liu Guang Sect, no matter which path one chose, they all had to pass through the west river valley. This river valley was long and narrow. If one wanted to pass through it, it would be quite easy for other people to discover them.Wei Qing was quietly guarding this place. He was standing on a mountain peak on one side of the river valley. At his current position, it was easy for him to view the whole river valley. Wei Qing\u2019s expression was grave and stern, and it also emitted an arrogant air that seemed to come from the bottom of his heart. One reason for his arrogance was his genuine dragon blood, however, a bigger reason was because he had faith in his abilities.On the surface, he was a cultivator who had cultivated the whole Qi Condensation Stage. However, in reality, he had already possessed this cultivation level since last year. The grand Liang imperial family\u2019s growth relied on his huge cultivation family. Thus, with Wei Qing\u2019s identity, he naturally didn\u2019t lack pellet medicine that would help him build his Foundation.Unfortunately, Liu Guang Sect only gave Qi Condensation Stage cultivators a chance of entering the Qilin Tower. This was why Wei Qing forcibly suppressed his cultivation for a whole year.He was determined to win this year\u2019s top place for the inner-sect disciple exam! Wei Qing believed that with his strength, this would be absolutely no problem.\u201cHm? Someone came?\u201d Wei Qing couldn\u2019t help but lightly frown when he caught sight of that sneaky figure near the river valley. He remembered this person, back then, this guy had been standing beside Hu YuTian.Hu YuTian and Xiahou Lian had long been people he included in his list of opponents. Since this person was Hu YuTian\u2019s, he definitely couldn\u2019t let him pass.Lightly leaping up, Wei Qing fell down like a hawk with a prey in sight. That sneaky person had extremely keen senses and suddenly lifted his head. Unexpectedly, he discovered Wei Qing in advance before his complexion changed dramatically. He immediately began to flee, his speed completely astonishing.Wei Qing was indifferent to this. He only lifted his hand before a white light shot out from his finger. Naturally, that light was directed at that sneaky guy\u2019s back.The sneaky guy felt something was wrong, as if he was about to face a huge crisis. Completely unable to care about how ugly his actions were, the guy rolled on the ground, managing to dodge that white ray of light. That light hit the ground, followed by a huge exploding sound and a cloud of smoke. When the smoke finally dissipated, a huge hole was in the place of the flat ground from before.The sneaky guy lay on the ground in a daze. The corners of his mouth kept twitching. If an attack that powerful had managed to hit him, he was would have already died.He indignantly glared at Wei Qing. This guy actually didn\u2019t care about Liu Guang Sect\u2019s rules and thus tried to kill him??!!Wei Qing coldly said, \u201cTake out all of your jade pendants.\u201dThe sneaky guy yelled in an angered tone, \u201cYou actually dared to go against Liu Guang Sect\u2019s rules?!\u201dWei Qing\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cIf I wanted you to die, you would already be dead by now.\u201dThe sneaky man was immediately stunned. Don\u2019t tell him, this Wei Qing actually knew he would be able to dodge his attack?\u201cGive up your jade pendants. Don\u2019t waste my time.\u201d Wei Qing\u2019s cold and severe gaze was locked on the sneaky man. It made him feel extremely pressured.The sneaky man was angered, but he didn\u2019t dare say anything. Although Wei Qing wouldn\u2019t go against Liu Guang Sect\u2019s rules, it didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t torture him until he gave up his jade pendants.If he was injured, it would be even harder for him to find other jade pendants. Thus, with no other choices, the sneaky man was only capable of handing Wei Qing his jade pendants.Wei Qing glanced at the four red pendants he had obtained before a trace of ridicule appeared on his face. The sneaky man knew that Wei Qing was mocking him for not having the abilities to obtain a green pendant. However, the martial arts he cultivated wasn\u2019t one that was good for fighting face-to-face with an enemy. In addition, although those senior-apprentice brothers and sisters had suppressed their cultivation to the Qi Condensation Stage, their spiritual sense was still incomparably keen. Wanting to steal something from them was practically a joke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In his opinion, he only needed to obtain the jade pendants. He completely didn\u2019t care about what happened to the sneaky man after that.The sneaky man swallowed his anger and left. He intended to return to the forest before trying his luck once more. He didn\u2019t dare cross the river valley. After all, one didn\u2019t need a brain to know that he wouldn\u2019t be able to provoke the people who managed to pass Wei Qing and enter the river valley. Now, his only hope would be to steal as many jade pendants as he could before passing the river valley after Wei Qing left.After all, Wei Qing wasn\u2019t like him. The sneaky man only wanted to muddle a pass for this part of the assessment. However, Wei Qing definitely wanted to try and obtain this year\u2019s top place. No matter what, he wouldn\u2019t want to give up this assessment\u2019s first place. Thus, after he collected enough jade pendants, it was certain he would leave this place.After the sneaky man left, Wei Qing leapt up. He stepped onto the protruding parts of the mountain before easily landing on the very top. Then, Wei Qing sat down into a lotus position before quietly waiting for his next prey to arrive\u2026\u2026...Xu ZiYan was currently cautiously crouching in a cluster of short shrubs with Xu ZiRong. With the shrubs shielding them from view, he observed the black-clothed cultivator\u2019s actions. This person was currently standing beside the small creek in the distance.This small creek was the only source of water in the area. As for why they were hiding there, Xu ZiYan believed that though the candidates and their senior-apprentice brothers and sisters definitely brought enough drinking water in their inter-spatial bags, they probably didn\u2019t bring any bathing water.That was correct, Xu ZiYan was being very bold as he decided to hunt down a black-clothed cultivator. He believed that with Ye Gui\u2019s words, these older senior-apprentice brothers and sisters made him their target as well.Since they already wanted to deal with him, then they couldn\u2019t blame him for making a move. The prey and the hunter, if one wasn\u2019t careful, their roles can switch without any warning.Xu ZiYan\u2019s current smile looked exceptionally sinister. The Xu ZiRong who had made it a habit of paying attention to his big brother\u2019s mood no matter the time or place immediately caught this wicked smile. Immediately, he quivered once. For an unknown reason, Xu ZiRong felt a bit excited as he believed that this kind of big brother seemed to be even more delicious than usual\u2026\u2026No, that wouldn\u2019t do! This was the big brother who loved him! If he sucked away all of Xu ZiYan\u2019s blood, who would love him in the future?Xu ZiRong had no other choice but to repeatedly remind himself just how important Xu ZiYan was to him. However, as his body developed and he grew older, Xu ZiRong began to increasingly feel that his older brother produced an attracting smell \u2014\u2014 one that made him more and more thirsty\u2026\u2026As he secretly swallowed the bead of blood he had previously hidden, Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyes darkened. The refined essence blood from those low-level spiritual beasts had a smaller effect on him as time passed. If he wished to continue cultivating the Blood Heart Sea Sutra, he had to either slaughter a cultivator with the same cultivation as himself, or hunt stronger spiritual beasts.Xu ZiYan had concentrated all of his attention on that black-clothed cultivator. Just a few moments ago, when he and Xu ZiRong passed through an area with red berries, this idea suddenly popped into his mind.In general, this assessment had been more or less the same as the one in the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories. Although there had been a few minor incidents that were unique to this time\u2019s assessment, things didn\u2019t deviate too far.With the help of Xu ZiRong\u2019s Wood Element martial techniques, he set up many traps. These traps wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone, however, it was capable of spraying the red berry juice onto the people who walked into them.Because the traps had all been made out of vines, there wouldn\u2019t be any spiritual energy fluctuations. If one was walking in the forest, it was easy for anybody to walk into them if they weren\u2019t careful enough. After being hit by the juice, perhaps the exam candidates and the senior-apprentice brothers wouldn\u2019t do anything about it. However, Xu ZiYan believed that those senior-apprentice sisters absolutely wouldn\u2019t tolerate themselves walking around covered in such dirty berry juice.As he guarded the only water source and idly waited for opportunities, Xu ZiYan crouched there for about the time it took to burn one incense stick and yup, a black-clothed cultivator appeared.That person was very thin. As they were wearing a mask and the standard black clothes the other black-clothed cultivators all wore, it wasn\u2019t possible to tell whether they were male or female. However, following his previous theory, Xu ZiYan was ninety-percent sure that this person was female, especially since they were so concerned with their state of cleanliness.This black-clothed cultivator appeared with a mask soaked in red berry juice. It wasn\u2019t hard to guess that they had most likely tried to stop the trap from springing onto them. However, they probably didn\u2019t know that these red berries would explode the moment one touched them, thus, they still fell into their trap.Xu ZiYan was very careful. He believed that these senior-apprentice brothers and sisters of his would follow the rules and wouldn\u2019t use power beyond the Qi Condensation Stage. However, a person\u2019s strength didn\u2019t only include one\u2019s cultivation level. Their combat skills, weapons, and even their luck could be considered as one\u2019s strength.Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t want to gamble on his luckiness levels. Therefore, even though he had confidence in winning against this black-clothed cultivator, he still shamelessly joined hands with Xu ZiRong to bring them down.Just when that black-clothed cultivator leaned down to wash their hands and face, two thin vines began silently extending toward them from a short shrub. Although Xu ZiRong could also produce vines directly at that cultivator\u2019s feet, the close distance would most likely alert them. This was why he chose to create vines by his side before making them slowly crawl over there.Unfortunately, this time Xu ZiRong had really underestimated this person. The moment that vine touched the black-clothed cultivator\u2019s ankle, they suddenly leapt away and brandished their sword. With an effortless swing, they chopped those two thin vines into pieces.\u201cA sneak attack?\u201d With a smiling intent in their eyes, that black-clothed cultivator stared at the short shrubs.Seeing this, Xu ZiRong slowly stood up before smiling bashfully. \u201cBig sister found out\u2026\u2026\u201dThe black-clothed cultivator seemed to have not expected that the one who had ambushed them was such an adorable and lovely child. Although the mask covered their face, a trace of gentleness flitted through their eyes.Xu ZiRong mentally curled his lip. The Blood Devil Lord expressed that after so many years of acting cute, playing this kind of role again really didn\u2019t make him feel pressured. \u256e(\u256f_\u2570)\u256dThat black-clothed cultivator smiled. \u201cHow did you know I\u2019m a big sister?\u201dXu ZiRong poked his fingers together. \u201cI\u2026\u2026big brother told me. He said, if they come over here to wash up, then they have to be a big sister.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d The black-clothed cultivator seemed to be quite interested as she continued to question him. \u201cThen, where\u2019s your big brother?\u201dXu ZiRong slowly raised his head, before revealing a sweet smile.The black-clothed senior-apprentice sister instinctively realized something was wrong. She detected a burst of wind passing her. Then, she saw the Xu ZiRong in front of her open his mouth before throwing out four words in a light tone. \u201cHe\u2019s right beside you.\u201dThe black-clothed cultivator\u2019s face changed dramatically. Her figure flashed as she prepared to immediately dodge, however, a ray of lightning had approached too quickly. In addition, the two vines she had chopped up suddenly trembled before new sprouts grew from the top and wrapped around her feet. Although they were quite weak since Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t have much time, it was still more than enough to stop her for a brief moment.\u201cSenior-apprentice sister, pardon us for this offense.\u201d Xu ZiYan smiled as he stared at the person who had to unfortunately meet his lightning attack head-on. She was sprawled on the ground as her body became completely numb. Even though she was wearing a mask, Xu ZiYan could still feel her raging and flaming anger.A bit embarrassed, Xu ZiYan rubbed the back of his head. In the modern times, he considered himself to be somewhat gentlemanly. However, trying to be a gentleman now was the same as happily courting death.\u201cSenior-apprentice sister, you see\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu ZiYan crouched down and started to talk to the black-clothed cultivator. He raised out his hand and gestured for the woman to hand out her jade pendant. Just in case, Xu ZiRong controlled the vines and wrapped her up into a zongzi.qwqA zongzi, a type of Chinese dish. It\u2019s basically glutinous rice with fillings wrapped in bamboo leaves.That black-clothed senior-apprentice sister gritted her teeth and glared at these two brothers. In her heart, she had already cursed these two half to death.\u201cIt\u2019s in my boots.\u201d Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t know what kind of spiritual artefact these senior-apprentice brothers and sisters used, but her voice was raspy and hoarse, making it impossible to tell whether she was male or female.Xu ZiYan beamed a bright smile at this senior-apprentice sister and gave her a salute. \u201cThank you senior-apprentice senior!\u201d After saying that, however, he didn\u2019t make a move to take out the jade pendant. Instead, he gave Xu ZiRong a meaningful glance.Xu ZiRong controlled a vine to carefully probe into the black-clothed cultivator\u2019s boots. Finally, he was victorious as a green jade pendant rolled out.When she saw how careful these two brothers were, the black-clothed cultivator couldn\u2019t help herself from cursing them again in her heart. The amulet hidden in her boots no longer had the chance to activate. Instead, she could only helplessly watch these two guys bundle her up like a zongzi before leaving in a self-assured manner.\u201cTwo little bastards!\u201d After the two of them left, the black-clothed cultivator cursed out loud. Using some strength, she disintegrated those vines binding her and then scattered the remnants onto the ground.\u201cHa ha ha, Xue Yan, you also fell into a trap!\u201d Another black-clothed cultivator who was very tall and burly leapt off a treetop and landed beside the other cultivator. Then, they reached out to support them.\u201cWatching the lively show was quite entertaining for you, right?\u201d The black-clothed person called Xue Yan couldn\u2019t help but roll her eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even think about coming down and helping me?\u201dThe burly cultivator laughed again. \u201cThat kid is quite clever. Didn\u2019t you see how careful he was when he was collecting your jade pendant? If I came down, perhaps I\u2019ll have an ending like yours.\u201dXue Yan snorted instead of saying anything. Then, unable to restrain her smile, she laughed out loud. \u201cThese two stinky brats are really quite vigilant.\u201dThe burly black-clothed cultivator was quite cheerful as well. \u201cRight? These two kids are really interesting. It looks like this batch of new seedlings are all very good. I reckon those Martial Uncles and Martial Ancestors are going to fight over them until heads are rolling again.\u201dXue Yan smiled slightly. \u201cI heard there\u2019s also a Wei Qing in this batch. Is he from the Wei Family?\u201dThe burly cultivator frowned slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s right. He\u2019s precisely that kid who looks very puffed up and arrogant. However, it seems like he already left.\u201d\u201cHe left?\u201d Xue Yan paused for a moment. \u201cWho\u2019s jade pendant did he snatch?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the burly cultivator spread out both of their hands helplessly.Xue Yan rolled her eyes at that cultivator again. \u201cI don\u2019t want to continue talking to a guy like you. I already lost my jade pendant, so I\u2019m leaving first.\u201dIn response, the burly cultivator waved their hand at her before disappearing into the forest.Xue Yan helplessly shook her head before muttering to herself, \u201cAh, this is really shameful. Don\u2019t tell me I was the first one who got robbed of their jade pendant?\u201dIn reality\u2014\u2014She really wasn\u2019t.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a senior-apprentice brother or a senior-apprentice sister, but, thank you for your jade pendant.\u201d The lovely and adorable little girl smiled as she raised the jade pendant in her hand.The black-clothed cultivator sprawled on the ground had no other choice but to smile bitterly.The little girl waved her hand. From the black-clothed cultivator\u2019s body, a small and dark-green snake slithered out. This was exactly the little snake that was named Bi Yun.The little girl smiled at the black-clothed cultivator once more. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a senior-apprentice brother or a senior-apprentice sister, but you don\u2019t have to worry. Bi Yun only used his least venomous poison. With only some time and effort, you could force out the poison from your body.\u201dWhen she finished talking, the little girl hid the snake into her sleeves before skipping away happily.The black-clothed cultivator sprawled on the ground slowly sat up. Their body flashed a green light before a black liquid began shooting out from their hands. When it dripped onto the ground, the ground began sizzling as the liquid corroded the dirt.The black-clothed cultivator gently shook their head. \u201cThis batch of disciples are really\u2026\u2026heh heh, perhaps it will be quite lively next year.\u201d When they finished talking, they casually patted the dirt off their butt before leisurely walking toward the forest.At the same time\u2014\u2014\u201cHa ha ha! This senior-apprentice brother, you\u2019ve fallen into my trap!!\u201d Xiahou Lian smiled at the black-clothed cultivator who was currently hanging upside-down from a tree branch. Then, she gave him a cheerful wave.That black-clothed cultivator\u2019s face was filled with black lines. They casually threw out something green. Then, they quickly cut the vines wrapped around their feet before immediately disappearing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXiahou Lian speechlessly stared at the green jade pendant in her hand. This senior-apprentice brother was truly straightforward, ah.(The black-clothed man was extremely angry. If he wasn\u2019t straightforward, what else could he do? Had he not lost enough face?)In the forest, hunting and being hunted could happen anywhere. At the same time, the relationship between a hunter and prey could quickly change.Between candidates and between a candidate and a black-clothed cultivator, at every moment in time, there were people who lost their jade pendants. In addition, there were people who, after losing their pendants, refused to give up. Thus, they would make plans to steal the jade pendants of other people.For example\u2014\u2014A sneaky man very carefully pressed himself to the side of the mountain as he followed the path and used the mountain to cover his own figure. He was precisely that poor chump who had gotten robbed by Wei Qing when he was halfway to Liu Guang Sect. Although he had lost four jade pendants, including his own, this sneaky man hadn\u2019t become discouraged. Instead, he patiently concealed himself in the forest and waited for an opportunity to strike.Perhaps the Heavens really rewarded the diligent. Unexpectedly, at midnight, the sneaky man found two candidates that had knocked each other out at the same time. When he saw the two candidates who had fainted, the sneaky man felt extremely happy. After he carefully confirmed that they hadn\u2019t set any traps, he took away their jade pendants with no trace of politeness.A similar situation happened again. In the end, the sneaky man took advantage of his agility and managed to scrape together six red jade pendants.As he stared at the jade pendants in his hand, the sneaky man\u2014\u2014who was precisely the man named Yu Hao who would be known as \u2018rat\u2019 in the future, looked at his palm with a gloomy face. In normal circumstances, if someone had collected enough jade pendants to pass, they ought to be very happy. Yet, when Yu Hao remembered the deity guarding the river valley, he only felt a terrible headache.His concealing technique was very good. However, he really wasn\u2019t sure that he could make his way through the river valley under Wei Qing\u2019s nose. In addition, if he was blocked by Wei Qing again, he would lose all of his jade pendants. But if he continued to hide in the forest, he wouldn\u2019t be able to make it to Liu Guang Sect within three days. In that case, the result would be the same as getting caught again.The miserable-looking Yu Hao was practically anxious enough to scratch the wall. With Wei Qing guarding the river valley, he really couldn\u2019t think of anyone who could successfully make their way through\u2026\u2026Oh, perhaps Xiahou Lian could. Hu TianYu ought to be able to find an opportunity to make it across as well. Ah, right, that person with the surname Xu\u2026Xu something probably had a chance too. However, if Wei Qing wasn\u2019t intent on fighting to the death with those stronger people, and instead wanted to just intercept the \u2018weak and puny\u2019 candidates like him, that would be very troublesome.Hm?Just as Yu Hao was fretting over his choices, his ears suddenly perked up. Then, he immediately climbed onto a tall tree using a few moves before concealing himself. One couldn\u2019t help but say that his skill at concealing was extremely good. If the cheating Xu ZiRong wasn\u2019t here, Xu ZiYan wouldn\u2019t have been able to discover him no matter what.\u201cBig brother,\u201d Xu ZiRong abruptly spoke up. Xu ZiYan turned his head to look at him when he suddenly felt his little brother lightly stroke his palm a few times.Xu ZiYan immediately understood. His finger also lightly scratched the hollow of Xu ZiRong\u2019s palm a few times to tell him that he understood. However, he still asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, ZiRong? Are you tired?\u201dXu ZiRong\u2019s eyes flashed once before he shook his head. When he had felt that slightly rough finger on his palm, his heart felt as though it got scratched by a little kitten.Xu ZiYan smiled a bit. He held onto Xu ZiRong\u2019s hand and continued to lead him forward, but in reality he had already become very alert. A small and thin strand of purple lightning began swirling between his fingers, as if it was a tiny, travelling dragon playing around. However, this seemingly unremarkable dragon was able to produce tenfold the strength in just a short instant, sending out astonishing destructive power.kkk.PNGThe two of them didn\u2019t deliberately avoid that hidden person, and instead walked forward toward Liu Guang Sect, their original destination. Xu ZiYan wasn\u2019t worried that this person would sneak attack them. According to the secret signal Xu ZiRong made, this person\u2019s strength was merely at the ninth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. Unless they were assured they could defeat both Xu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong in a short period of time, nobody would make things difficult for the two brothers.Things progressed like what he had expected. The guy who had concealed himself indeed didn\u2019t make any moves against them. Toward that guy, Xu ZiYan completely didn\u2019t mind him. His goal was becoming this examination\u2019s top candidate, so naturally he wouldn\u2019t attach much significance to those \u2018worthless\u2019 red jade pendants. Xu ZiYan\u2019s target was those black-clothed cultivators. Just thinking about going into Liu Guang Sect and handing over a bag that contained only green jade pendants made him excited! Ah, how beautiful would that scene be?After the two brothers left, Yu Hao jumped down from the tall tree where he had stayed hidden. He stared at the direction the two siblings had disappeared in. Although he hesitated for a moment, in the end, he still decided to chase after them.\u201cBig brother, that person is following us,\u201d Xu ZiRong said without batting an eyelid.\u201cHm?\u201d Xu ZiYan was a bit surprised. When other candidates saw the two of them and didn\u2019t get robbed of their jade pendants, they were usually happy enough to thank the heavens. Could it be possible that the person chasing after them was actually quite strong, and was now planning to attack them?After reading the questions in his big brother\u2019s gaze, Xu ZiRong shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s only following us from very far away. It doesn\u2019t seem like he wants to make a move against me.\u201dXu ZiYan frowned. Although he had the confidence to take out a cultivator at the ninth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, just allowing the other to follow them wasn\u2019t his style.If by some chance a black-clothed cultivator got the better of them and he allowed the person who was following them to pick up a readily available bargain, then that really would be too stupid.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s take care of them,\u201d Xu ZiYan said in a whisper as he leaned by Xu ZiRong\u2019s ear.Feeling uncomfortable, Xu ZiRong moved a bit. The warm air Xu ZiYan breathed out had hit his ear, making it a bit itchy. He was extremely unused to this kind of feeling.However, Xu ZiRong quickly threw that thought into the back of his mind. As they continued to walk forward, he began setting up some traps made out of vines.Yu Hao cautiously followed the two brothers from the Xu family. He carefully concealed his figure in fear of revealing anything. After meeting Wei Qing and experiencing what it was like to fight against him, he now understood that his original notion about the small difference between the ninth layer of Qi Condensation Stage and cultivating the whole Qi Condensation Stage was utter nonsense. Wei Qing didn\u2019t even spend much effort to completely crush him.Of course, Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t hope to compare himself against Wei Qing. Wei Qing possessed genuine dragon blood and his family background was much stronger than Xu ZiYan\u2019s as well. However, Xu ZiYan had his little brother by his side, and his little brother was already at the eighth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. It would be easy-peasy for these two brothers to take him out.Completely unaware that he had already been discovered by others, Yu Hao was still perfecting his plan inside his head. He could tell that the Xu family brothers\u2019 concealing abilities were far worse compared to his own. In other words, it was certain that Wei Qing would discover them\u2014\u2014that is, if Wei Qing was still guarding the river valley.If they really met, then his best chance to cross the river valley would be when the Xu family brothers fought against Wei Qing. Yu Hao had the confidence that, as long as they gave him a small headstart, even Wei Qing wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up to him.Yu Hao began happily imagining how he may become the first person who reached Liu Guang Sect. Just as he started fantasizing how he would get all the Elders\u2019 and even the Sect Leader\u2019s favour as they began insisting to receive him as their disciple, he suddenly felt something tighten under his feet. Immediately following that, the ground he was stepping on turned into an immense net made out of vines. It wrapped around him before hanging him in the air.Yu Hao quickly snapped out of his daze and took out a dagger. He began attempting to cut those thin vines that made up the net. However, before he managed to do much, he suddenly sensed the Xu family brothers making their way to his position. Before he could even think of escaping, Xu ZiYan was already smiling at him under the net.\u201cContinue, ah. Why don\u2019t you continue cutting those vines?\u201d The purple thread of lightning began frolicking around the tip of Xu ZiYan\u2019s fingers. There was a kind smile on his face, however, to Yu Hao, this was a threat.Yu Hao helplessly raised both his hands to indicate that he had given up his intention to resist. In his heart, however, he couldn\u2019t help but curse. Why was he this unlucky? This time, he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep the jade pendants he had painstakingly gathered.\u201cHe he, dear friend. What noble errand requires you to chase after us?\u201d Xu ZiYan asked with a smile. But before Yu Hao could open his mouth, he added on another sentence. \u201cAnd don\u2019t say it\u2019s just a coincidence. You\u2019ve already followed us for perhaps half a shichen1.\u201dYu Hao looked expressionless, but in reality he already wanted to curse without restraint. The hell, was this batch of candidates all f*cking monsters???!!! One Wei Qing was already too excessive, now even this Xu ZiYan could see through his concealing technique??!!Forcefully squeezing out a smile, Yu Hao began speaking in a laborious manner. \u201cHa ha, brother Xu cracked a funny joke. I bear you no ill will.\u201dXu ZiYan continued smiling. \u201cYeah, you aren\u2019t malicious. Then, what do you want to do by following us two brothers?\u201dXu ZiRong had been standing to the side. When he heard Xu ZiYan\u2019s words, he snapped his fingers and made the net made out of vines immediately tighten. As a result, Yu Hao became wrapped up like a sausage.Xu ZiRong spoke in a cold tone, \u201cMy big brother is asking you something. Don\u2019t speak nonsense.\u201dYu Hao began raging in his heart. The hell! Forget about the cultivators who had completed the whole Qi Condensation Stage being like a monster, why was a cultivator at the eighth layer of Qi Condensation Stage this scary too??!!Yu Hao\u2019s complexion was unsightly as his expression collapsed. Though it was hard to determine Xu ZiYan\u2019s personality, it was a different case for Xu ZiRong. This Xu ZiRong was a genuine, murdering star. Yu Hao could feel the same dangerous aura from Xu ZiRong that had been surrounding Wei Qing. That was an aura that told others that this person disregarded the lives of others.Yu Hao believed that, had this examination not forbad killing others, perhaps to Wei Qing and Xu ZiRong, he was already a dead person.Gently swallowing his saliva, Yu Hao quickly adapted to the new circumstances and began explaining his entire plan to cross the river valley. In any case, the worst scenario was handing over his jade pendants. He had already lost them once to Wei Qing. Losing them again to the Xu family brothers didn\u2019t make much of a difference\u2026\u2026\u201cWei Qing, huh\u2026?\u201d Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyes flashed. The original Xu ZiYan did have memories of this, however, they weren\u2019t personal memories. At that time, the original Xu ZiYan had only been at the eighth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. He had completely depended on how lightning spiritual veins had very high destructive power to snatch away enough jade pendants from his fellow candidates. By the time the original Xu ZiYan had made it to the river valley, Wei Qing had long left, so of course he hadn\u2019t been robbed of his jade pendants. He had only heard of this happening from other disciples, but the original Xu ZiYan hadn\u2019t cared about it at all.\u201cBig brother, do you want to take out that Wei Qing?\u201d Xu ZiRong asked.Yu Hao mentally rolled his eyes. He wanted his brother to take out Wei Qing? This kid was over-exaggerating so much, his tongue was going to grow so heavy it would be sprained when the wind blew. After all, Wei Qing was most likely this examination\u2019s strongest candidate. Just escaping from him was pretty amazing, much less taking him out\u2026\u2026Xu ZiYang pondered for a bit. With his strength, even if he couldn\u2019t take out Wei Qing, their fight should at least result in a draw. One had to know, because of that BL novel, Xu ZiYan had worked much harder than the original Xu ZiYan. Exceptionally good talent added onto diligent practice, plus his extremely strong lightning spiritual martial arts, the difference between him and the original Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t be described with the simple explanation of, \u2018just a difference of two layers of Qi Condensation Stage\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As brothers, Xu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong trained together and lived together for many years. Their tacit understanding stat had long been brushed to MAX. Collaborating together to make a move, beating someone up as a group, or doing things like a 2 VS 1 duel\u2026\u2026Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t feel any pressure at all.\u201cLet\u2019s go and personally experience Wei Qing\u2019s strength,\u201d Xu ZiYan decided.Xu ZiRong indifferently nodded his head. As far as the Blood Devil Lord was concerned, Wei Qing was nothing more than a youngster who had cultivated the whole Qi Condensation Stage. Even if Wei Qing possessed genuine dragon blood, it was impossible for him to be a match for Xu ZiRong. Perhaps Wei Qing would be able to pressure Xu ZiYan a bit, but for Xu ZiRong, he truly couldn\u2019t even be considered as a plaything that could alleviate his boredom.The two brothers turned around, ready to immediately leave. However, the Yu Hao who was still tied up quickly began shouting, \u201cAh, can\u2019t you guys let me down?!\u201dXu ZiYan abruptly turned around, his bright eyes looking as if they were about to burn a hole in Yu Hao. Yu Hao suddenly couldn\u2019t help but pull back a bit as he shrunk into himself. His gaze began evading Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyes as he gave two hollow chuckles. \u201cUh\u2026\u2026it\u2019s alright if you don\u2019t want to release me.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll let you go, why wouldn\u2019t we?\u201d Xu ZiYan said with a beaming smile on his face. Hearing his brother\u2019s words, Xu ZiRong raised his hand and prompted that net made out of vines to immediately disperse. Yu Hao fell down from the tree and let out a shout of pain, \u201cOuch!\u201d\u201cI almost forgot,\u201d a calculative glint flickered across Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyes. \u201cSince you intended to follow after us and muddle across the river valley, that means you\u2019ve collected enough jade pendants, right?\u201dYu Hao immediately choked on his spit. In his heart, he really wished he could give himself two hard slaps. His mouth was basically courting a beating! What \u2018let me down\u2019 ah? After the two brothers left, couldn\u2019t he have just used his small knife and slowly wear down the net himself? Why had he yelled at those two and made them return for him?!\u201cCome now. Don\u2019t try hiding it or tucking them into your pocket,\u201d Xu ZiYan shoved his hand toward Yu Hao before he gave Yu Hao a \u2018you understand what to do, right?\u2019 kind of expression.A mouthful of blood was stuck in Yu Hao\u2019s chest. With a dejected face, he took out four, red jade pendants from his pocket. \u201cHere! I only have these four! My own jade pendant had long been snatched away by Wei Qing, so these are the ones I managed to obtain from other people.\u201dXu ZiYan nodded his head with a face full of smiles. \u201cThank you. In the future, if I get the chance to, I\u2019ll invite you out to eat.\u201dIn a gloomy tone, Yu Hao said, \u201cForget it, forget it. Let\u2019s just say I was unfortunate. In the future, don\u2019t let me come across you two again.\u201dXu ZiYan didn\u2019t get angry at those words. Instead, he just pulled Xu ZiRong\u2019s hand and dragged him away.Not long after they left, Yu Hao swept away his gloomy aura. After looking around in all directions, he quietly disappeared back into the forest\u2026\u2026\u201cBig brother, he should still possess some jade pendants. Why didn\u2019t we take them as well?\u201d Xu ZiRong asked as he stared at Xu ZiYan with incomprehension.Xu ZiYan reached over to rub the top of his head as he explained, \u201cWhen it is possible to let people off, you should spare them. Although that person\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t the greatest, the way he moved and his knowledge of martial arts is pretty good. It isn\u2019t necessary for us to force him to a desperate state.\u201dXu ZiRong nodded his head, looking as though he had only half-understood Xu ZiYan\u2019s words. This was the Liu Guang Sect, not his palace. Although crushing others with absolute strength was quite convenient, it was also easy to leave behind hidden dangers.Of course, this was a different story if Mister Blood Devil could silence someone in a neat and efficient manner before destroying their corpse to get rid of any clues. However, in Liu Guang Sect\u2019s exam, they were not allowed to kill others. In addition, if they followed Liu Guang Sect\u2019s rules, it would allow the two brother\u2019s future days in the Sect pass a bit more smoothly.Xu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong travelled very quickly. Although they did encounter other candidates, the moment those candidates saw them, they began running away as fast as possible.If the two of them wanted to chase after them, it would end up wasting too much time. In addition, perhaps those candidates had already long lost their jade pendants. It wasn\u2019t worth wasting the time to catch them.After spending almost two shichen, the two of them finally reached the West River Valley on the morning of the next day. If they looked at the West River Valley from a distance, the two sides of the mountains that made up the valley\u2019s walls didn\u2019t look too tall. On one of the highest pieces of rocks, there was the silhouette of a person wearing a golden changpao sitting there.Xu ZiYan pulled Xu ZiRong\u2019s hand before he pointed at Wei Qing\u2019s figure. With a serious expression, he asked, \u201cZiRong, do you know what that is called?\u201dXu ZiRong blankly shook his head.Xu ZiYan began explaining as he gnashed his teeth. \u201cThat kind of behaviour is called acting like a piece of (beep). Those who act like a piece of (beep) are usually the ones who like courting a lightning zap. In the future, you absolutely cannot do something this foolish, understand?\u201dXu ZiRong: =.=\u201cWait here for a bit and watch big brother put on a show for you, one that would explain what \u2018courting a lightning zap\u2019 means.\u201d After he finished talking, Xu ZiYan began gallantly and spiritedly walking toward Wei Qing.Although, before he left, he still hadn\u2019t forgotten to instruct Xu ZiRong, \u201cAfter Wei Qing and I begin fighting each other, quickly run across, understand? As long as you bring across those jade pendants, it could be considered that we won.\u201dXu ZiRong: \u2026\u2026That was right. Xu ZiYan was very shamelessly going over to challenge Wei Qing without carrying any jade pendants. In reality, he was actually not that confident in facing Wei Qing. After all, in the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories, Wei Qing was an ultra-powerful character. If he hadn\u2019t died in the original\u2019s lifetime because of a mishap during his exploration in a secret realm, Wei Qing might have become one of Bai Hua\u2019s people when Bai Hua and his husbands became the leaders of the entire Xuan Yu region.Eh? Xu ZiYan suddenly remembered that the novel had mentioned Bai Hua exploring that secret realm as well. In addition, within the secret realm, Bai Hua encountered a guy who had drooled over his charm. However, this guy was extremely powerful. In the end, Bai Hua relied on and worked together with Mo ZiYuan to lead that guy to death. Bai Hua led that guy into a powerful demonic beast\u2019s lair, and then took advantage of the time when both man and beast had suffered great losses to finally kill off that guy.Ah ah ah! Xu ZiYan finally remembered everything! In that book, it said that Bai Hua received the genuine dragon blood from this guy\u2019s body and then used it to open his spatial bag. After that, Bai Hua\u2019s cultivation progress became smooth sailing. Did this mean\u2026\u2026the person described in the novel as \u2018the super powerful guy that had drooled over Bai Hua\u2019s loveliness\u2019 was Wei Qing???Xu ZiYan\u2019s head was full of black lines. In all honesty, his contact with Wei Qing had been minimal thus far. However, according to the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories, Wei Qing was quite a haughty person. A person like that would fiercely kill someone because they coveted their beauty? No matter how Xu ZiYan tried wrapping his mind around this, he still believed something like that was impossible\u2026\u2026The most interesting thing was, for some reason, although he had received all of the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories, he couldn\u2019t see Bai Hua\u2019s face no matter what. It felt as if Bai Hua\u2019s face had been enveloped with a faint cloud of mist.Even in those scenes, the ones that made Xu ZiYan wish his dog eyes were blind and those super close-up scenes, Xu ZiYan still couldn\u2019t see Bai Hua\u2019s face. But contrary to what one might expect, Xu ZiYan was able to very clearly see Bai Hua\u2019s body\u2026\u2026\u201cWhen all was said and done, what kind of beauty was capable of being this alluring?\u201d Xu ZiYan rubbed his chin, completely puzzled.He was truly puzzled. After all, in the modern times, he had seen every type of beautiful woman or handsome guy there was. However, he truly couldn\u2019t imagine how beautiful Bai Hua had to be, in order to make three geniuses become so crazy about him. After all, those three had been blinded by Bai Hua\u2019s beauty to the point that they were willing to share their lover with other people.\u256e(\u256f_\u2570)\u256d Ahh, he just couldn\u2019t understand a harem world.\u201cBig brother, what are you saying?\u201d Xu ZiRong asked with an innocent expression.When he heard that, Xu ZiYan was immediately startled. So it turned out, he had just said something out loud? Shoot! Wasn\u2019t this leading his obedient little brother astray? That was completely out of the question. No matter how gorgeous that Bai Hua was, Xu ZiYan definitely couldn\u2019t allow Bai Hua to meet Xu ZiRong face-to-face!Although the original text had mentioned how Xu ZiRong hadn\u2019t felt anything for Bai Hua, the book kept hinting that it was because Xu ZiRong had an unmentionable illness.In other words, it wasn\u2019t that Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t react to Bai Hua\u2019s beauty. No, it was because he couldn\u2019t react to it.Regardless of whether the things the book said were true or false, Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t take risks over this. Currently, he raised his precious baby brother into a tender white and pure child. Thus, Xu ZiRong\u2019s body had to be one-hundred percent healthy.Xu ZiYan was rather confident in himself that he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to Bai Hua. However, if by any chance Xu ZiRong was unable to stand the temptation of Bai Hua\u2019s beauty and fell in love with him, Xu ZiYan would worry himself into death ah!He must decisively separate the two of them! It would be best if he could make it so that the two of them would never meet!That was right, Xu ZiYan had to introduce more beautiful girls to ZiRong! His little brother had to be straight! As straight as a pencil!!\u201cBig brother\u2026\u2026\u201d Sensing that he was being ignored by Xu ZiYan, a flash of gloom passed through Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyes.\u201cAh? Oh, it\u2019s not important, I was just talking to myself,\u201d Xu ZiYan patted Xu ZiRong\u2019s head to comfort him. \u201cAlright, big brother will go and take care of that Wei Qing now. You have to be careful as well.\u201dAs he watched his big brother\u2019s back walk further away, Xu ZiRong\u2019s expression became even more gloomy.Beauty? Alluring?In some place where he hadn\u2019t been present, his older brother actually encountered a beauty?? An alluring one that had even attracted him??Damn! Which cheap woman had managed to get that close to his brother without his knowledge? Had his brother also liked herWhen he thought of this, Xu ZiRong immediately became startled. In all these years, Xu ZiYan hadn\u2019t ever expressed any interest toward women. This had actually made him forget that Xu ZiYan could now be considered as an adult man.In the past, Xu ZiYan had been the one who kicked out the sex servant Ruo Qi who had been prepared by Xu Xiao. And after that, Xu ZiYan never asked for this type of request either.However, just because he hadn\u2019t requested something like this didn\u2019t mean Xu ZiYan hadn\u2019t wanted it. Could it be? Did his big brother want women now??A flash of blood-red flickered past Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyes. No! His brother was his!Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t care whether or not his brother wanted women! Xu ZiYan was the gift God had given to him. His entire body, his soul, and all his emotions belonged to Xu ZiRong. They belonged to only Xu ZiRong!\u201cWho is it?!\u201d Xu ZiRong yelled in a severe tone. His eyes, the ones currently dyed red, vigilantly watched the shrub not too far away from him.A breeze lightly blew past, making that bush produce the sound of rustling leaves. However, there was no sign of a human\u2019s figure anywhere near that bush.\u201cSince you\u2019re not coming out, then don\u2019t blame me for being impolite,\u201d Xu ZiRong laughed grimly. Then, he completely released all of his annoyed feelings.Since a punching bag had delivered itself to his door, he wasn\u2019t going to be polite!With a loud bang, three thick vines appeared and began ferociously lashing out on the big tree beside the bush.These vines weren\u2019t the thin vines that were only as thick as a thumb. Instead, they were blood coloured vines that were as thick as an adult man\u2019s thigh. A dense and concentrated aura of power and cruelty surrounded these vines.In these years, Xu ZiRong hadn\u2019t only cultivated the Wood Element martial arts that could only be used to support others. No, these vines that had been integrated with his Blood Sea Heart Sutra were his genuine trump card.\u201cDamn! What the hell are these things?!\u201d After the big tree was whipped by his blood vines, a black silhouette suddenly fell down from the treetop. Because the dangerous vines had struck so close to them, their expression was still one that had lingering fears.Xu ZiRong expressionlessly stared at them. However, he had already suppressed the ruthlessness in his heart.Although he would really like to dismember the unlucky guy in front of him into thousands of pieces in order to vent out his feelings, Xu ZiRong still remembered that this was Liu Guang Sect\u2019s exam site. If he really killed someone, it would be impossible for him to cover it up.As he stared at this black-clothed cultivator, Xu ZiRong suddenly revealed an ice-cold smile. He remembered this person\u2019s scent. For anyone who had been hurt by him, Xu ZiRong would always be able to smell the scent of that person\u2019s blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For this guy to have recovered that quickly, it seemed like this senior-apprentice brother\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t as bad as he had thought.Xu ZiRong stared at Qilian HongYun with a gaze brimming with malice. He didn\u2019t know this guy\u2019s name, but that didn\u2019t prevent him from deciding to give this senior-apprentice brother of his a gift. After all, this was the first time they were meeting, so Xu ZiRong ought to be polite.Lightly raising his wrist, those three blood vines began lashing out toward Qilian HongYun as they cut through the whistling wind. Qilian HongYun was shocked by his action and immediately jumped back. However, he didn\u2019t know that Xu ZiRong had already secretly created two thin, green vines behind him. Those two thin vines wrapped around his ankles, and although it was only enough to halt his movements for a short moment, it bought Xu ZiRong enough time for those blood vines to wrap around his body\u2026\u2026The dark red vines tied the black-clothed cultivator into the shape of a fried dough twist before hanging him in the air, upside down. Xu ZiRong had an extremely sweet smile on his face as he broke off a willow branch without much extra effort and slowly walked over to the Qilian HongYun\u2019s side.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026senior-apprentice brother. Since you were hiding here, did you want to do something?\u201d Although Xu ZiRong\u2019s current smile was sweet enough to astonish people, his eyes flashed with cold malice.Qilian HongYun suddenly shuddered. In his heart, however, he was already raging. What the hell was with this batch of candidates?! F*ck, even a little junior-apprentice brother at the eighth layer of Qi Condensation Stage was this awesome??!! How could they, the senior-apprentice brothers and sisters who had cultivated for many years endure this, ah?!\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You don\u2019t want to say anything?\u201d The corners of Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyes tilted upwards into a smile as a trace of ruthlessness flitted by in his gaze.Immediately, Qilian HongYun felt depressed. What the hell could he even say? Other than stealing Xu ZiRong\u2019s jade pendants, why else would he have been following him?Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t rush him. After all, Xu ZiYan had already begun fighting with Wei Qing. For a short while, his brother couldn\u2019t return. Thus, Xu ZiRong had enough time to vent out his recent frustrations.Making a gesture with both hands, the thin willow branches began elongating due to his Wood Element Martial Arts. Xu ZiRong used the tip of a willow branch to lightly scratch that black-clothed cultivators mask before he spoke in a gentle tone, \u201cSenior-apprentice brother, I\u2019m still a child. I still don\u2019t really know how to control my strength, so senior-apprentice brother, please don\u2019t take offense.\u201dXu ZiRong had barely finished speaking when a willow branch viciously whipped Qilian HonYun\u2019s thigh. Xu ZiRong had fine control over the power of the branches, for even the black layer of cloth hadn\u2019t been ripped open. However, the willow branch brought severe pain onto Qilian HongYun, which made him yell out in pain in a very immature manner.\u201cAh! It hurts like hell!!!\u201dTo be honest, even Xu ZiRong was stunned by Qilian HongYun\u2019s shameless behaviour. He had measured his strength when he had made that blow. Even though the pain was a bit unbearable, it shouldn\u2019t have made a cultivator let out such a miserable scream\u2026\u2026\u201cAh! A murderer! Someone save me ah! The new junior-apprentice brother wants to kill his senior-apprentice brother!!\u201d In an extremely shameless manner, Qilian HongYun began screaming in a loud voice. Xu ZiRong stared at him, stupified, as he watched this guy make a big fuss as he called for help. Suddenly, Xu ZiRong felt a bit helpless over this new development.\u201cShut up!\u201d From who knows where appeared two black-clothed cultivators. When the considerably taller one saw Qilian HongYun\u2019s appearance, blue veins immediately began bulging on his forehead. Then, that cultivator yelled at him as he gnashed his teeth.Xu ZiRong tensed a bit. Just now, he actually didn\u2019t sense where these two black-clothed cultivators had came from!Immediately, a great part of the contempt he had for these senior-apprentice brothers and sisters disappeared. He didn\u2019t know how the other senior-apprentice brothers and sisters were like, but just the fact that he hadn\u2019t noticed these two nearing him was enough to prove their power. Even if these two black-clothed cultivators had suppressed their cultivation level to Qi Condensation Stage, they still possessed the capability to mount a sneak attack on him.In a situation where he couldn\u2019t reveal his Blood Sea Heart Sutra, Xu ZiRong was afraid that he didn\u2019t have any chances of winning against them.Xu ZiRong vigilantly stared at the two people that had suddenly appeared. The moment Qilian HongYun saw them, he also immediately quieted down.That tall, black-clothed cultivator turned around to glance at Xu ZiRong. Within their gaze, however, appeared some appreciation.\u201cI\u2019ll be troubling this junior-apprentice brother to please let him down,\u201d although this black-clothed cultivator\u2019s voice was a bit hoarse, their attitude was quite gentle. They weren\u2019t making it difficult for Xu ZiRong just because he had captured Qilian HongYun.Xu ZiRong had always been a clever person. He snapped his fingers, and those blood vines quickly disappeared, as if they had never been there in the first place. Conveniently, he could also let Qilian HongYun fall down. After all, Xu ZiRong wasn\u2019t kind enough to remind the guy in advance that he was letting him go, and he would be happier if Qilian HongYun actually became half-dead from his fall.Fortunately for Qilian HongYun, although he was a bit shameless, he still had quick reflexes. Before he reached the ground, he did a flip, successfully saving the last bit of his honour.That tall, black-clothed cultivator gave Xu ZiRong a smile as the appreciation in their gaze increased. Then, they turned toward Qilian HongYun and held out their hand.\u201cWhat?\u201d Qilian HongYun pretended that he couldn\u2019t understand.That black-clothed cultivator raised their eyebrow. \u201cDo you want me to make a move against you myself?\u201dUpon hearing that, Qilian HongYun\u2019s expression abruptly became quite remarkable to see. He pursed his lips before he reluctantly took out a green jade pendant and dropped it into the tall black-clothed cultivator\u2019s hand.The tall man handed that green pendant over to Xu ZiRong before asking him in a deep voice, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201cXu ZiRong,\u201d Xu ZiRong stared at him with a cold expression. Other than his older brother, he wouldn\u2019t smile for anyone else.Oh, no, that wasn\u2019t completely correct. Whenever he wanted to make a move against someone, he would also give that person an extremely sweet and cute smile.The tall man didn\u2019t say much more. Instead, he turned around to grab Qilian HongYun\u2019s collar and then he began dragging him away. However, before he left, he told Xu ZiRong a single sentence, \u201cXu ZiRong, I hope you will become one of the top three candidates of this exam.\u201dAfter he watched those three black-clothed cultivators disappear into the forest, Xu ZiRong frowned slightly. In his last life, he practically had no contact with Liu Guang Sect. Naturally, he didn\u2019t know what shenanigans happened between the top three in the exam. However, he believed that the tall, black-clothed cultivator from before wouldn\u2019t speak without thinking. In that case\u2026\u2026perhaps he too should try hard to fight for a place?But of course, he wasn\u2019t going to aim for first place. After all, in Xu ZiRong\u2019s heart, the top spot was something he prepared for his older brother. However, under these circumstances where he accidentally revealed a lot of power despite originally trying to be lowkey, perhaps creating a high-profile was also a solution.While Xu ZiRong pondered over what kind of treatment he would get should he take one of the top three places of this exam, Xu ZiYan had already confronted Wei Qing.Following Xu ZiYan\u2019s appearance, the imposing aura surrounding Wei Qing began gradually increasing.Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t want to cover up his strength at all. He thoroughly understood that when one fought against an opponent like Wei Qing, a short moment of carelessness meant he would suffer a defeat. If he still wanted to hide his strength at a time like this, then that would really be foolish.\u201cXu ZiYan?\u201d When Wei Qing saw Xu ZiYan walk toward him, he slowly stood up.Within this exam, the only people Wei Qing viewed as his opponents were Xiahou Lian and Hu YuTian. Although this Xu ZiYan\u2019s behaviour hadn\u2019t been too bad, Wei Qing didn\u2019t really think much of him.However, at this moment, Wei Qing knew he had underestimated his enemy the moment he sensed the aura on Xu ZiYan. This Xu ZiYan who had come from a family that wasn\u2019t well-known, absolutely had the qualifications to fight against him.\u201cI originally believed that\u2026\u2026the first person who would arrive here would be Xiahou Lian or Hu YuTian. I never expected it would be you,\u201d Wei Qing\u2019s tone was very calm. After all, that had indeed been the case. In addition, although Xu ZiYan had the qualifications to fight against him, that didn\u2019t mean Xu ZiYan had the ability to defeat him. Wei Qing was absolutely sure he could win against Xu ZiYan in a battle.\u201cActually, I was very surprised too,\u201d Xu ZiYan spread out his hands. To be honest, he really wished he could use a peaceful method to solve all of his problems. It was a pity that Wei Qing was just too arrogant. His body possessed genuine dragon blood, something that was able to maximize his cultivation efficiency. As a result, Wei Qing was accustomed to looking down on other people.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to speak superfluous words. Just make your move,\u201d Wei Qing said in an indifferent manner.In his heart, Xu ZiYan felt a bit helpless. Hadn\u2019t he already said that acting like a piece of (beep) was the same as courting a strike of lightning? This Wei Qing must be addicted to acting like that, to actually allow him to make a move first when both opponents were around the same level. It was truly\u2026\u2026Well, then he wouldn\u2019t be polite! \u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256dXu ZiYan began sprinting as he pulled out the long bow on his back. The moment he pulled back his bow, an arrow made out of purple lightning formed.Cultivators usually learned all types of attacks made out of spiritual energy. Although there were people like Xu ZiYan who borrowed the power of his bow to attack, their numbers weren\u2019t a lot.In fact, most cultivators had a certain attack range they were most comfortable with. However, their ranges really couldn\u2019t compare with Xu ZiYan\u2019s range.The same could be said for Wei Qing. Thus, the first thing he had to do was shorten the distance between himself and Xu ZiYan.Xu ZiYan understood this as well and of course he wouldn\u2019t give up his advantage. While he ran, he continuously pulled back his bow and shot numerous purple arrows made out of lightning toward Wei Qing.Other than martial cultivators, very little cultivators would polish and strengthen their bodies. Ever since he had been young, Wei Qing had been the skies\u2019 proud child. With the innate talent of the Fire Heavenly Spiritual Vein and his genuine dragon blood, it would have been impossible for Wei Qing to pick the bitter path of a martial cultivator.If his opponent was someone normal, his body wouldn\u2019t be that much worse compared to his enemy. However, since he had came across Xu ZiYan, this guy who didn\u2019t do things based on common sense, the only thing Wei Qing could do was nurse his grievances.A dark red shield appeared and enveloped Wei Qing\u2019s body. This protective shield was extremely concentrated. When normal attacks made out of spiritual energy hit it, they weren\u2019t able to do much. However, unfortunately for Wei Qing, the arrows Xu ZiYan used were made out of condensed lightning spiritual energy. This type of arrow\u2019s special characteristic was that the moment it hit its target, it would explode to maximize its destructive power. In addition, because the tip of the condensed lightning arrow was extremely sharp, defensive spiritual artefacts suffered a lot of damage from its attacks.Although they were both using spiritual energy, only four of Xu ZiYan\u2019s arrows had hit Wei Qing\u2019s protective shield before small cracks began appearing. Wei Qing looked a bit sullen. Although he had also been continuously sending out spiritual attacks, since Wei Qing had to defend at the same time, his accuracy was greatly reduced.Xu ZiYan felt really happy because he chose a combat style that was most beneficial to himself.In all honesty, he would never have expected that Wei Qing would actually be willing to let him take the initiative. This kind of foolish thing\u2014\u2014well, in any case, Xu ZiYan would never do it. \u2192.\u2192Wei Qing\u2019s expression was very ugly. He spread out his fingers and stretched them a bit. For a moment, he seemed to want to use some kind of technique. However, in the end, Wei Qing still restrained that alluring urge. After all, this was only one part of the Liu Guang Sect exam. And judging by his current strength, if he used his genuine dragon blood now, he wouldn\u2019t be able to use it again for at least half a month.Of course, Wei Qing should use the astonishing power of his genuine dragon blood when it was most needed. It truly wasn\u2019t worth using it on a little, small Xu ZiYan.After all, even if he won against Xu ZiYan right now, he would at most receive a few jade pendants. However, if he met Xiahou Lian or Hu YuTian afterwards, then that would be quite bad.Forcing down the restless thoughts in his heart, Wei Qing suddenly stopped attacking Xu ZiYan. In response, Xu ZiYan began watching him vigilantly. After all, there was no rule that someone couldn\u2019t attack their opponent again after the battle was over. Naturally, Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t relax now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He raised his hand and threw over a green jade pendant. This was something he had snatched from a black-clothed cultivator. Although that black-clothed cultivator was pretty strong, he was still a bit stronger than them. Thus, after they had lost, they left behind this green jade pendant.Xu ZiYan felt very surprised. He had never expected that Wei Qing would be this straight-forward about admitting defeat. In his opinion, with how haughty Wei Qing was, it was truly abnormal if the two of them didn\u2019t risk their lives in a \u2018you live, I die\u2019 battle.Wei Qing gave him an indifferent glance. \u201cIf we fight against each other, it\u2019ll only allow other people to benefit.\u201dXu ZiYan raised an eyebrow. Was this\u2026\u2026Wei Qing\u2019s way of acknowledging his strength?Of course, Xu ZiYan understood that if the both of them really fought to the death, it would be hard to predict who would win. After all, a large reason he had won today was because Wei Qing had underestimated him too much.Now that his opponent had already adequately understood his strength, Xu ZiYan was afraid that should they encounter each other again in the future, winning against Wei Qing wouldn\u2019t be this easy. After all, although his lightning arrows were quite powerful and sharp, it wasn\u2019t like there wasn\u2019t a way to counter them.\u201cIn that case, thank you,\u201d Xu ZiYan raised the green jade pendant in his hand and gave Wei Qing a beaming smile.Wei Qing frowned slightly, although the furrow in his forehead quickly disappeared. His teacher had once told him before that should he continue to cultivate within Great Liang\u2019s Imperial Reign, he could only do so by walking on his difficult path by himself, never knowing the vastness of the world outside.There was never a lack of geniuses in this world. Geniuses like him, and like Xiahou Lian. However, if people did not compete with each other, there was a great chance of geniuses disappearing and turning into normal people.With his personality, only intense competition that pressured him would help his genius talent reach its full potential.When Wei Qing remembered how his teacher had assessed him, he couldn\u2019t help but frown again. His teacher had told him before that he was too haughty and proud. Apart from his need to improve himself from continuous practice, he needed some \u2018friends\u2019 who could constantly correct his ways. Otherwise, in the future, he wouldn\u2019t be able to walk far on his path of cultivation.However, even though he knew himself the best and knew that he needed some friends, it was impossible for Wei Qing to throw away his arrogance and go make friends with people that were clearly inferior to him.After pondering about this for a bit, he realized that within the candidates of this exam, only a few were \u2018qualified\u2019 to be his friend. In addition, his Wei family had always been at odds with the Xiahou family. Thus, he and Xiahou Lian were the same and were naturally enemies. It was impossible for that fact to change.On the other hand, that boy from the Hu family always had a gloomy expression on his face. He practically gave people the impression that he was an unlucky guy. Wei Qing really didn\u2019t think too highly of him either.After comparing people like this, Wei Qing suddenly felt that Xu ZiYan, this guy who had appeared out of normal, was at least somewhat pleasing to the eyes\u2026\u2026Wei Qing began sizing Xu ZiYan up as he considered the possibility of him becoming his friend.On the other hand, Xu ZiYan was feeling some goosebumps from this terrifying guy\u2019s constant staring. Thus, he dryly coughed twice before he turned around, intending to leave. However, who would have expected that before he could leave, Wei Qing suddenly raised his head. Giving Xu ZiYan a serene look, Wei Qing said, \u201cI permit you to become my friend.\u201dXu ZiYan\u2019s face blanked. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWei Qing\u2019s face was also expressionless. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXu ZiYan began roaring in his heart: F*ck, where the hell did this chuunibyou devil brat come from?! You actually allow me to become your friend?? Why can\u2019t you allow me to give you a beating instead?!Wei Qing continued to be expressionless.Xu ZiYan felt very helpless. What should he say? If he continued smiling at a time like this, would that be enough to get by?Although Wei Qing remained expressionless, his posture revealed hints of impatience. From what Xu ZiYan could tell, Wei Qing\u2019s body language was clearly saying, \u2018I\u2019ve already allowed you to become my friend, why haven\u2019t you reacted yet?\u2019Xu ZiYan mentally felt tears stream down his face. Sure enough, in this word, only his precious little brother was the most lovable! Other children were all little brats!\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u201d Wei Qing felt that the atmosphere had become a bit strange. He didn\u2019t understand why Xu ZiYan was smiling so foolishly right now (Xu ZiYan slipped! That was called a gentle smile!). At a time like this, shouldn\u2019t Xu ZiYan say he was very happy to become his friend?It was clear that\u2026\u2026although Wei Qing\u2019s teacher had long understood his personality, he hadn\u2019t taught Wei Qing enough skills.If you asked Xu ZiYan, he would say that this child\u2019s emotional intelligence was clearly insufficient and really required a recharge\u2026\u2026The two of them once again sunk into a strange silence. Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t know what to say, and Wei Qing seemed to have finally realized that something went wrong earlier\u2026\u2026However, Wei Qing clearly remembered that he had also said something like this to the son of a second ranked chancellor. At that time, he had even used a slightly annoyed and disgusted tone of speaking, but that guy had been so excited he nearly fainted. Afterwards, his teacher also criticized and scolded him for this, but even now he didn\u2019t know what he had done wrong.That strange atmosphere from before became more and more intense. More importantly, hints of anger actually began faintly appearing on Wei Qing\u2019s expressionless face.Xu ZiYan immediately felt startled. He completely didn\u2019t understand how things had developed to this stage. The haughty Wei Qing actually took the initiative to become his friend? (\u2026\u2026Please allow him to reword and change Wei Qing\u2019s words.)When he saw how the situation between them was about to become worse, Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t help but feel extremely anxious. However, it was at this moment did he suddenly realize that although Wei Qing still looked expressionless, the two ears half-hidden beneath the other boy\u2019s hair were slightly red\u2014\u2014Xu ZiYan became speechless.So\u2026\u2026wasn\u2019t this just a brat who didn\u2019t know how to express his own feelings?Trip! The hell, in the past, what kind of environment did this guy live in? If it was Xu ZiRong who been this bratty, he would have long suffered a spanking, alright!?Helplessly supporting his forehead, Xu ZiYan suddenly couldn\u2019t stop himself from smiling. He just realized that Wei Qing was nothing more than a young child. Although Wei Qing didn\u2019t know much about the ways of the world, it didn\u2019t necessarily mean he wasn\u2019t sincere.When you became friends with someone like this, you absolutely didn\u2019t need to worry about them betraying you. This was because their pride simply didn\u2019t allow them to do something like betraying their friends.\u201cAlright, alright. We\u2019re friends now,\u201d Xu ZiYan\u2019s expression was quite weird right now. After all, he had to restrain himself from laughing out loud.Although Wei Qing still looked calm and tranquil, one could see a trace of tension in his eyes.Ah. Sure enough, he was nothing more than a child. Xu ZiYan thought this, feeling still a bit amused.It could be considered that the two of them agreed upon a \u2018gentleman\u2019s friendship\u2019. However, before Xu ZiYan left, Wei Qing very seriously told him that should the both of them have a chance to fight against each other in the future, he definitely wouldn\u2019t go easy on him.Xu ZiYan agreed with a chuckle. He believed that should he seriously fight against Wei Qing again, it would be hard to predict the winner.After all, although Wei Qing had a hidden trump card he hadn\u2019t revealed yet, Xu ZiYan also hadn\u2019t used all the cards up his sleeve.After bidding farewell to Wei Qing, Xu ZiYan boldly passed through the west river valley. Being able to become friends with Wei Qing could be considered as an unexpected bonus. But following that, Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t help worry about this new, unexpected friendship of his.This was because it was still highly likely that Wei Qing would die in the hands of that novel\u2019s protagonist. Although there may be differences in this world because he had transmigrated, who could guarantee that Bai Hua wouldn\u2019t be able to ensure that the story\u2019s plot would progress without a hitch? He did have that damned protagonist halo!Even though he only met Wei Qing a few times, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t dislike this person. Otherwise, if he hadn\u2019t liked him, he wouldn\u2019t have agreed to become friends with him. Wei Qing was a very straightforward and upright person. Perhaps he was a bit haughty, but he indeed had the skills to back up his arrogance.\u201cUgh, I\u2019ll stop thinking about this. In any case, it\u2019s still long before that secret realm opens up. If worst comes to worst, when that moment comes, I\u2019ll just kidnap Wei Qing and bring him with me to the battlefield at the far west. I don\u2019t believe that if he doesn\u2019t go into the secret realm, that Bai Hua would come just to chase him to the battlefield!\u201d\u201cBig brother? What are you saying?\u201dAt their appointed meeting spot, Xu ZiRong was waiting for him in a well-behaved manner.Xu ZiYan\u2019s voice hadn\u2019t been loud when was talking to himself, so Xu ZiRong only managed to hear some indistinct mumblings about the far west.His gaze was a bit dark, because Xu ZiYan had never told him that he intended to go to the far west to temper himself. Thus, the only person that was connected to the far west was that barbarian clan\u2019s Lei Hu.Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyes became half-lidded as he swiftly pondered why Xu ZiYan would suddenly mention the far west. Could it be\u2026\u2026had Xu ZiYan just come across that sensitive Lei Hu again?Damn it! What had that guy said to his older brother?? Did he tell his big brother that there was a dense scent of blood surrounding his body??Xu ZiRong\u2019s thoughts were in a disorder, but nothing of that showed on his face. In his head, he had already created several responses he could use to counter any information Lei Hu revealed. But first of all, he had to take an indirect approach to find out what exactly did Lei Hu say to his brother.\u201cBig brother? What is the far west?\u201d Xu ZiRong asked in an innocent manner.Xu ZiYan abruptly snapped out of his daze to give his little brother a smile. Perhaps it was because he pitied Xu ZiRong for his bitter experience in his previous life, for although he knew Xu ZiRong was very happy this life, whenever Xu ZiYan faced his cute (not really!) little brother, he was never stingy with his smiles.\u201cThe far west is a battlefield. Big brother is intending to go there in the future to train myself. Does ZiRong want to go with me?\u201dXu ZiRong nodded his head without any hesitation. \u201cI want to go with big brother.\u201dIn his heart, however, he completely relaxed. So it turned out that his big brother wanted to go to the battlefield against the demonic races, huh\u2026\u2026?Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t continue speaking. After all, he had already intended to bring along Xu ZiRong. Although that place was a bit dangerous, what would be more dangerous than meeting that Bai Hua?In order to ensure his safety and Xu ZiRong\u2019s safety\u2014\u2014and now he needed to add on Wei Qing\u2019s safety as well\u2014\u2014he intended to avoid any place that would give him a chance of meeting Bai Hua.This was basically the so-called saying, \u2018if you cherish life, stay away from human scum\u2019! (Yes, in Xu ZiYan\u2019s opinion, Bai Hua was human scum.)If he couldn\u2019t afford to make him angry, he could always hide from him!But at this moment, Xu ZiYan still hadn\u2019t realized that under his manipulations, the story\u2019s plot had already been going astray like a runaway horse\u2026\u2026Far away from the west river valley, Xu ZiRong gave Xu ZiYan another green pendant.With regards to how Xu ZiRong unexpectedly managed to confront a black-clothed cultivator by himself, it made Xu ZiYan feel faintly depressed\u2026\u2026Alas! When he hadn\u2019t been aware of it, Xu ZiRong already became this strong! It truly made him, the big brother, feel a sense of loss. _(:\u0437\u300d\u2220)_At an extremely fast speed, the two brothers hastened on with their journey. Thus, it had only taken them one day to reach the mountain beneath Liu Guang Sect.When he saw that winding road that snaked upwards, Xu ZiYan suddenly felt as if he was seeing the stairs that would lead him to immortality\u2026\u2026So, why did he feel as if it wouldn\u2019t be easy to take a walk on this small path \u2026\u2026? \u2192.\u2192Xu ZiYan\u2019s prediction had been correct. At the entrance of this small path, a young man stood there with a beaming smile. This man looked extremely refined and handsome, and even the smile on his face was very kind. However, when Xu ZiYan saw this man, he couldn\u2019t stop his cheek from twitching\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayF*ck\u2026\u2026wasn\u2019t this senior-apprentice brother Qilian, the one within the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories? Why was this guy here? Xu ZiYan clearly remembered that the person who had kept watch here in the original\u2019s timeline was a senior-apprentice brother with a low sense of existence. So, how did it suddenly change to Qilian HongYun???While Xu ZiYan felt somewhat baffled over this sudden change, Xu ZiRong merely hooked up the corners of his lips. This familiar scent\u2026\u2026so it had been him, huh?The moment Qilian HongYun saw these two brothers, his eyelids immediately jumped. As a result, his smile became even more benevolent. If someone unfamiliar with him saw his current appearance right now, they would absolutely think he was an affable and proper senior-apprentice brother.Unfortunately\u2026\u2026The people he was facing right now was Xu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong, and both of them weren\u2019t ordinary people. Although they each had different reasons for it, both brothers had raised their vigilance against Qilian HongYun.\u201cThese two junior-apprentice brothers, congratulations for completing the first part of the exam,\u201d Qilian HongYun told them with a smile.Xu ZiYan also smiled and gave Qilian HongYun a salute, however, the sirens in his heart had already begun ringing.This senior-apprentice brother had a well-known reputation in the last generation of disciples. He had especially been known for his bellyful of evil tricks. In fact, it was said that there had been countless junior-apprentice brothers and sisters who had been conned by him. Although he never did anything too major, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t want to be randomly pranked out of the blue.\u201cThese two junior-apprentice brothers, you have already passed the first part of the exam. Please hand over your jade pendants to me.\u201dXu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong gave each other a glance before they took out all the pendants they had harvested.Qilian HongYun took a look at those pendants that emitted a soft green glow and immediately felt his balls hurt. After all, one of those green pendants was his! And just because of that green pendant, he actually had to be on duty at the training hall for an entire year\u2026\u2026oh the heavens! Just kill him now!Dumping him into that boring place and asking him to stay together with all those old geezers, it was the same as taking away his life!When he thought of this, Qilian HongYun couldn\u2019t help but glare at Xu ZiRong as he gnashed his teeth. However, he didn\u2019t expect that before he even managed to use his expression to convey his anger, his line of vision was blocked by Xu ZiYan.Xu ZiYan\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t that good as he stared at Qilian HongYun. What was wrong with this guy? Why was he glaring at his little brother? Didn\u2019t he know that it was easy for children to develop a psychological shadow?Moreover, for a grown-up guy to frighten a child around ten years of age, did he want to lose the rest of his honour?Xu ZiYan\u2019s current expression very clearly conveyed his disdain for Qilian HongYun. It immediately made Qilian HongYun choke on a mouthful of old blood, something he wanted to spit out but couldn\u2019t.In all honesty, Qilian HongYun really wanted to ask Xu ZiYan something: your little brother is this fierce and cruel already, so how does it feel to have to one-up him as his older brother??!!When Xu ZiRong saw Xu ZiYan blocking him from Qilian HongYun\u2019s sight, the corner of his mouth tilted upwards into a curve. This feeling, the feeling of being protected, really felt very nice.Qilian HongYun dryly coughed twice before he tidied up his slightly distorted expression. Then, with a righteous appearance, he said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ve already recorded your points. Your next task is to enter the Liu Guang Sect\u2019s main gates within three shichen1. As for the road you\u2019ll have to take, well, even if I don\u2019t point it out, I\u2019m sure you two can already see it. However, I do need to remind you that walking on this path\u2026\u2026wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201dBy the time he got to the end of his speech, the expression on Qilian HongYun\u2019s handsome face made it obvious that he was delighted over their misfortune.Xu ZiYan felt completely speechless. He really couldn\u2019t remember when he had offended this senior-apprentice brother of his. So, what did this expression mean?\u201cAh! Oh right, because you guys placed first and second in the first part of the exam, you must carry a special token on your body,\u201d Qilian HongYun finished talking with a smile on his face. Then, from his interspatial bag, he took out a few pieces of rope that were as thick as one\u2019s pinky.Startled, Xu ZiYan stared blankly at Qilian HongYun. This was different from what had happened to the original Xu ZiYan. Then again, the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s results for the first part of the exam had been very normal. If this only happened to the first few candidates who had arrived here, it wasn\u2019t strange for him to experience a scene different from the original Xu ZiYan.\u201cIn that case, many thanks to senior-apprentice brother,\u201d Xu ZiYan reached out to take those ropes. However, he didn\u2019t expect that Qilian HongYun would suddenly retrieve his hand.Xu ZiYan frowned slightly. \u201cSenior-apprentice brother, what is the meaning of this?\u201dQilian HongYun\u2019s smile looked brilliant as he explained, \u201cThis isn\u2019t normal string, so you can\u2019t put it into your interspatial bag. It\u2019ll only be valid if you tie it on your body. Thus, do you intend to tie it on your arms or tie it on your legs?\u201dXu ZiYan was puzzled by his words. It was only two pieces of string, so did it matter whether he tied it on his arms or tied it on his legs?He reached out his hands and was just about to tell Qilian HongYun that it would be fine if he tied it onto his arms. However, he didn\u2019t expect the Xu ZiRong standing behind him to suddenly pull on his robe.When Qilian HongYun saw Xu ZiYan reach out, the smile on his face became even more happier. Just when he was about to tie the strings onto Xu ZiYan\u2019s arms, the younger boy suddenly pulled back.Qilian HongYun: =.=\u201cTie them onto our legs,\u201d Xu ZiRong took a step forward before telling Qilian HongYun that.Although Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t know why Xu ZiRong was this adamant about tying the strings onto their legs, he believed his little brother had his reasons.When he saw how Xu ZiRong insisted on tying the strings onto their legs, Qilian HongYun looked a bit disappointed. He was unwilling to give up on this matter and questioned them again. Upon seeing this, how could Xu ZiYan not understand? Thus, he quickly reiterated Xu ZiRong\u2019s words and said that the both of them wanted the strings to be tied on their legs.Qilian HongYun pouted a bit before he flicked his fingers. Immediately, those four strings shot into the air and began coiling themselves tightly onto the legs of the Xu family brothers.In the beginning, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t feel much. However, as the strings made more laps around his legs, Xu ZiYan felt as if the weight on his limbs became heavier and heavier. And by the time the strings had completely wrapped themselves around his leg, at least fifty pounds had been added to each limb.Xu ZiYan immediately turned his head to look at Xu ZiRong. Although a cultivator\u2019s constitution was much better than a regular human\u2019s, Xu ZiRong was only eleven years old. With so much weight added at once, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t know if his brother\u2019s body could carry on.Unexpectedly, Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t look as if his burden was too hard to bear. When he saw Xu ZiYan look over, he said, \u201cOnly twenty pounds.\u201dXu ZiYan immediately relaxed. An addition of twenty pounds may be hard for a normal child to bear, but it wasn\u2019t a big problem for Xu ZiRong.Then, he gave Qilian HongYun a somewhat flabbergasted look. Was it possible that he had misjudged this senior-apprentice brother of his? Perhaps Qilian HongYun actually thought highly of ZiRong?Qilian HongYun couldn\u2019t help but pout again. What was he looking at? It wasn\u2019t as if he liked Xu ZiRong. With how freaky the small guy was, Qilian HongYun was sure that even a hundred pounds wouldn\u2019t be too much for him.\u201cThis senior-apprentice brother, we\u2019ll be taking our leave now,\u201d Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t know what Qilian HongYun was thinking, so his impression of him had become much better.\u201cGo ahead, go ahead,\u201d Qilian HongYun casually waved his hand. In all honesty, he had been hoping that they would decide to wrap the strings around their arms. If they had done that, there would be a fun scene worth watching later. Well, since they hadn\u2019t wrapped the strings around their arms\u2026\u2026that fun scene would only be a little less fun to watch.After they said goodbye to Qilian HongYun, Xu ZiYan took the lead and stepped onto that narrow path first.On one side of the path was the mountain, on the other side was a cliff. As far as a normal human was concerned, walking on a desert barren mountain range like this was a goal that would be hard to accomplish. However, for a cultivator, as long as they were slightly careful, it wouldn\u2019t be dangerous at all.According to the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories, there wasn\u2019t anything special about this path. In fact, the original Xu ZiYan was still very puzzled over this. Liu Guang Sect was powerful and influential, so why was the second part of their exam this simple?Thus, Xu ZiYan was moving forward like he was running as fast as the wind. At best, adding on a hundred pounds of weight would only make him a bit exhausted. It wouldn\u2019t hinder him too much. However, Xu ZiYan wasn\u2019t sure if he was imagining it, but was the mountain wind flying past him getting stronger and stronger after he began walking on this path?\u201cBig brother, walk slower,\u201d Xu ZiRong shouted behind him.Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t have any memories about the Liu Guang Sect exam in his previous life, so he was much more careful and vigilant compared to Xu ZiYan.Ever since they started walking on this mountain path, Xu ZiRong had already stretched out his senses to the limit. Thus, the mountain wind that had gradually became biting and cold didn\u2019t go unnoticed by him. This was also why Xu ZiRong couldn\u2019t help but open his mouth to remind Xu ZiYan.Xu ZiYan suddenly came to a halt before he he shook his head fiercely. In his eyes, a trace of confusement flitted by. Just now, what happened? Although he had the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories, charging blindly forward like this without the slightest bit of hesitation really wasn\u2019t something he would do.Xu ZiYan calmed down before he tried to carefully distinguish the noises surrounding him. The whistling wind scraped by his ears. Within it, however, he actually managed to hear some low and muffled murmurs.Walk forward\u2026\u2026Walk forward\u2026\u2026Black pupils immediately becoming incomparably bright and clear, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t move from his spot as he began to cold sweat.He had unconsciously fallen into a trap?? Where exactly did these soft murmurs come from?When whatever the source of those whispers was saw how the two brothers had stopped moving, their low mumbling mixed together with the roaring wind began increasing their efforts in bewitching them.A low level illusion like this couldn\u2019t effect Xu ZiRong at all. He could even suppress the Blood Sea Heart Sutra\u2019s ruthless power, let alone this trick that couldn\u2019t even be considered as a normal-ranked illusion.In reality, if Xu ZiYan hadn\u2019t trusted the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories too much, he might have noticed something odd. However, who would have expected that he would fall into this trap just because he had too much faith in those memories?Fortunately, Xu ZiRong had woken him up in time. Otherwise, he might have really ended up following those murmurs and then walking straight off the cliff\u2026..\u201cAh, what a close call,\u201d unconsciously, Xu ZiYan\u2019s foot had already been toeing the edge of the mountain path. As long as he walked forward a few more steps, he would end up walking off of the cliff without even knowing it. With a height like this, unless his innate talent could turn him into a bird and grow him wings, he would definitely end up becoming a pancake of meat pulp.\u201cHa, ZiRong, luckily you\u2019re here. Thank you,\u201d Xu ZiYan wasn\u2019t stingy about praising Xu ZiRong.Xu ZiRong bowed his head and smiled bashfully, looking completely like a pure and lovable child.\u2018I need to be more careful in the future. The original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memory can only be used as a reference. After all, a lot of things have already completely changed. I don\u2019t know how many waves my little butterfly has already created,\u2019 Xu ZiYan silently warned himself. What had happened today was already the best lesson he could get. If he continued to blindly believe in the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memory, he wouldn\u2019t even know how he died in the future.The two brothers stuck to the side of the mountain and continued moving forward. A bone-chilling coldness was starting to mix together with the mountain wind. Even though they were wearing a lot of clothes, the two of them felt as if their hands and feet were going to freeze.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry up a bit, ah,\u201d Xu ZiYan helplessly told Xu ZiRong.Xu ZiRong nodded. Although increasing their speed would increase the danger they were in as well, the strange mountain wind was getting obviously colder. If they continued to move so slowly, the two of them would become popsicles sooner rather than later.The two brothers sped up their walking pace. This narrow path wasn\u2019t easy to walk on. There were many times where Xu ZiYan stepped on a part of the path that broke because of his weight. If he hadn\u2019t quickly grabbed onto one of the protruding rocks on the mountain wall, he was afraid that Xu ZiRong would have to end up collecting his corpse.\u201cDo you think it got somewhat warmer?\u201d Xu ZiYan asked in confusion.Xu ZiRong narrowed his eyes. The temperature of their surroundings had indeed increased a bit. In fact, Xu ZiRong even picked up the subtle scent of sulfur. Was there a natural hot spring nearby?The two of them walked forward a bit more. After taking another turn, the path suddenly opened up. In fact, on the narrow mountain path, a clearing actually appeared. But what would make people feel the most surprised was that on the flat ground, there really was a natural hot spring.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he had some suspicions about the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories, wasn\u2019t this difference a bit too big??For a narrow mountain path to suddenly become flat, open land\u2026\u2026original Xu ZiYan, what was wrong with your memories? Did they get modified or something?However, Xu ZiYan had no clue that this so-called mountain path was not as simple as what he had originally thought.After all, just think about it. This place could be considered as the location for Liu Guang Sect\u2019s huge, mountain-protecting array. If they didn\u2019t have any protective spells here, then wouldn\u2019t the grand Liu Guang Sect be the same as those small-sized cultivation families?Even the Xu family set up all sorts of spells and arrays around the main branch family\u2019s residence to protect the place from enemy attacks. Thus, a Sect as big as the Liu Guang Sect naturally wouldn\u2019t relax or fall behind.When all was said and done, Liu Guang Sect was one of Xuan Yu region\u2019s cornerstones of strength. A big Sect naturally had the air of an influential school. Countless of spells and arrays had been placed at the location of the mountain-protecting array. Most of the time, these spells and arrays were all turned off. But for the sake of the examination that would determine the inner disciples for the next generation, the Sect turned on a couple of those spells and arrays. Even the bigshot elders at the Sect wouldn\u2019t think of that as a waste.In fact, the hot spring in front of the Xu family brothers right now was there because they had used a transportation array to move it out from within the mountains. After all, many elders had already set their sights on Xu ZiYan, since he was a disciple that was this outstanding.However, although being favoured by the elders meant receiving numerous benefits, it also meant he had to experience an even more rigorous test.Of course, this was quite normal. Compared to the regular folks, the elite needed to have more achievements under their belts in order to convince the general masses of their superiority. \u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256dXu ZiYan didn\u2019t know that his previous behavior had already been noticed by a number of Liu Guang Sect\u2019s elders. Currently, he was just staring at the misty hot spring in bafflement. In fact, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t really know what to do next.Xu ZiYan definitely wouldn\u2019t imagine that this was Liu Guang Sect\u2019s way of showing them how much remorse they felt for making their candidates run around suffering hardships. Liu Guang Sect wasn\u2019t nice enough to deliberately take out a hot spring just so their candidates could bathe and relax. However, Xu ZiYan immediately understood that wanting to detour around the hot spring would be a complete fantasy. After all, the mountain path from before had abruptly came to an end.Spash!Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyes suddenly sharpened. Just now, something seemed to have rose out from the hot spring before sinking back again. Whatever it was even caused a huge splash of water.He exchanged glances with Xu ZiYan before the two of them carefully made their way over to the hot spring. A ray of lightning around his fingertips began moving around lively as Xu ZiRong pinched three green seeds into his palm.Although Wood Element Martial Arts was indeed great for healing, there was nothing to write home about when it came to its attacking power. Other than the thick, blood-covered vines that relied on the existence of Xu ZiRong\u2019s own blood and thus could appear anytime and anywhere, at other times, plants had to be in the vicinity if he wanted to use any powerful techniques.Currently, Xu ZiRong couldn\u2019t even spot a blade of grass in this hot spring. Since that was the case, he could only force the growth of seeds to create a small number of plants in order to be of any use.Splash!The thing that had made a splash broke the surface once more. Xu ZiYan was immediately shocked as he somewhat dazedly stared at it\u2014\u2014it, a mermaid!That was right. The thing that was frolicking around in hot spring as it made splashes of water, was precisely a blue mermaid!1983375-00bcd4That mermaid was extremely beautiful. Long, scarlet hair slid down her back and stuck to her body. The \u2018clothes\u2019 on the upper part of her body consisted of only a bra made out of white oyster shells, and the lower part of her body was a fishtail that looked quite smooth and sleek.Just now, she seemed to be playing around in the hot spring. In fact, she looked equally surprised when she caught sight of the Xu family brothers.However, it looked like the mermaid didn\u2019t know how to speak. She merely widened her eyes in fright as she stared blankly at the Xu family brothers.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, we aren\u2019t bad people,\u201d Xu ZiYan promptly said that to the mermaid.The mermaid seemed to be able to understand human language. Although she still looked a bit afraid, she no longer looked as alarmed as she did before.\u201cI apologize for disturbing you\u2026\u2026\u201d The moment Xu ZiYan said those words, he felt as if something was amiss. Thus, he stiffly swallowed the rest of his sentence before he gave the mermaid an apologetic smile in an attempt to express his meaning.When the mermaid saw Xu ZiYan\u2019s expression, she couldn\u2019t help but let out a giggle. The tension in her eyes disappeared entirely, and she even gave him a friendly wave.Xu ZiYan relaxed a bit before saying, \u201cThis is my little brother Xu ZiRong. The two of us are just passing through here.\u201d Turning around, Xu ZiYan pulled over his brother and introduced him to the mermaid.Xu ZiRong\u2019s expression was as indifferent as always. Not even the slightest ripple could be seen. His gaze was also so serene, it was similar to a dead person\u2019s soulless gaze.However, because of the angle, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t see Xu ZiRong\u2019s expression. He only thought his little brother was being shy, so he ruffled Xu ZiRong\u2019s hair.The mermaid probably managed to finally recover from her fright. She stared at the two Xu family brothers with interest as her tail happily swayed about. Every now and then, her fishtail splashed the water surface.Xu ZiYan slowly approached her a little more. When he detected that the mermaid didn\u2019t have any intentions of hiding from him, he relaxed and walked over to the edge of the hot spring. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for inconveniencing you, but may I please inquire as to where I could find a path that would lead us out of here?\u201dXu ZiYan had long been subtly observing his new surroundings. Apart from the trail that brought them there, it was as if this flat land had fallen down from the skies, existing just to block their paths.Other than this mermaid, Xu ZiYan really couldn\u2019t think of any other methods of finding a way out of there. Thus, he could only place his hopes on this seemingly simple and pure mermaid.While Xu ZiYan crouched near the hot spring to talk to the mermaid, Xu ZiRong, who had been standing nearby, suddenly changed his indifferent look.A few streaks of blood appeared in his eyes as his expression became awfully fierce.The boy raised his head slightly to stare at Xu ZiYan\u2019s back. His gaze was full of anxiety and worry, but unfortunately, his body was firmly shackled to his spot. Xu ZiRong couldn\u2019t even say anything to warn Xu ZiYan. He could only watch on helplessly as that mermaid seemed to be \u2018moved\u2019 by Xu ZiYan and how she began to slowly approach him. Only Xu ZiRong knew that although the mermaid looked quite beautiful, she was actually an extremely powerful demonic beast.Mermaids like her who lived in the sea were a type of demonic beast that fed on humans. Don\u2019t get bewitched just because she looked beautiful. When female mermaids were born, they looked extremely ugly. It was only after they consumed human flesh, would they possess a beautiful appearance like the mermaid in front of them.A common thing these demonic beasts did was to use their beauty to lure over the fishermen that braved the seas. Their claws could easily rip apart a human\u2019s body. In addition, the more human flesh and blood they ate, the more beautiful they became, and the more stronger they become as well!In his previous life, Xu ZiRong once met the most powerful mermaid of the sea. His cultivation at that time had already been close to the Demigod Stage, but had he not made the prompt decision to flee in a bloody manner, Xu ZiRong was afraid that he had long became the food in that mermaid\u2019s belly.Right now, Xu ZiRong was extremely anxious. Other than the sea, one wouldn\u2019t be able to find the slightest trace of a demonic beast like a mermaid. This resulted in a bunch of cultivators who wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize a mermaid as a demonic beast. A good example of this was Xu ZiYan, who was actually trying to communicate with a demonic beast as if they were human. One had to know, unless a demonic beast achieved a certain cultivation level, they weren\u2019t intelligent at all. What they did possess, however\u2026\u2026were the instincts of a hunter!So, although this mermaid seemed to be approaching Xu ZiYan because she accepted Xu ZiYan\u2019s kindness, that wasn\u2019t really the case. In reality, the mermaid was acting like this just so that Xu ZiYan would become her next meal!On the other hand, Xu ZiYan was trying his best to use a soft and gentle voice to coax the mermaid into revealing the way out of there. He completely didn\u2019t notice that the mermaid\u2019s hands, ones hidden beneath the water surface, had already begun changing dramatically.Her white and slender fingers became covered by greenish-blue scales as her sharp nails grew half an inch.While that happened, Miss Mermaid\u2019s face still looked as innocent and sweet as ever. She curiously peered at Xu ZiYan, looking as though she was very interested in his hair ornament.Xu ZiYan felt very helpless. This mermaid was really too naive. In fact, her current curiosity was the same as a young child\u2019s. No matter what he said, the mermaid completely ignored him as she stared fixedly on his hair ornament. It was like she wouldn\u2019t rest until she got the chance to study it.Smiling bitterly, Xu ZiYan reached up to pull out his hair ornament. Immediately, Xu ZiYan\u2019s fine black hair scattered down his shoulder. There were even a few naughty strands of hair that hung beside his cheek.However, unexpectedly, the mermaid didn\u2019t reach over to take his hair ornament. Instead, she began approaching his face even closer than before.With such a beautiful face nearing his own, Xu ZiYan inevitably felt a bit awkward and embarrassed. Although this mermaid was as beautiful as one could be, Xu ZiYan wasn\u2019t planning on having a relationship that exceeded friendship with someone who wasn\u2019t even human.In addition\u2026\u2026His precious baby brother was watching him right now! Xu ZiYan still had to show Xu ZiRong a good example of what a gentleman was like!Huh\u2026\u2026that was odd, why had ZiRong been silent for this long?Suddenly realizing that something was wrong, Xu ZiYan instinctively turned his head to look back.And at that exact moment! From the corner of his eye, Xu ZiYan saw a slash of cold light swipe toward his own neck. He immediately leaned back and took a tumble, just barely escaping those two razor sharp fingernails.Xu ZiYan was covered in cold sweat. At a time like this, if he still couldn\u2019t notice what this mermaid wanted to do, then he practically wasted the past two lives he had lived.With a flick of his fingers, a ball of violet lightning began flying toward the mermaid.That mermaid seemed to be very scared of this ball of lightning. Raising her hand, she summoned waves of water that blocked the ball of lightning.Suddenly, however, a few traces of confusion appeared on the mermaid\u2019s face. It seemed like she didn\u2019t understand why her body felt a bit numb, even though she had already defended against that ball of lightning.After using a ball of lightning to buy him enough time to increase the distance between him and the mermaid, Xu ZiYan immediately shot out a few arrows made out of lightning. Compared to his hastily made ball of lightning, it was a given that his arrows were much stronger. That mermaid had to make numerous walls of water before she was able to stop Xu ZiYan\u2019s attack.\u201cZiRong!\u201d After successfully destroying the pace of the mermaid, Xu ZiYan quickly turned around to search for Xu ZiRong at the earliest time possible.At this moment, it was already too late for regrets. His little brother had just been beside him. Just now, his brother had acted so strangely, and he didn\u2019t even notice! As the older brother, Xu ZiYan really wasn\u2019t fulfilling his duties.Thus, Xu ZiYan flung himself at Xu ZiRong. He was still a bit afraid that Xu ZiRong would be hit by any stray attacks made by the mermaid. That was why Xu ZiYan used his own body as a shield and cushion as he rolled to the side with Xu ZiRong.And as for the Xu ZiRong who hadn\u2019t been able to move at all due to his suddenly rigid body, the boy could only mentally curse out the guy who had controlled him. After he, the Lord, recovered his strength, he definitely had to take that guy\u2019s worthless dog life! They actually made his older brother land in such a risky situation! It was an unforgivable matter!(\u201cAchoo!\u201d A certain red-haired buff guy who was sitting in front of a water mirror suddenly sneezed. He gave a baffled look to the black leopard beside him, the one who was currently gnawing on a bone, as he muttered to himself, \u201cWhich brat is cursing me out from behind my back?\u201dThe black leopard raised his head to glance at him. Then, he silently turned his head as he mumbled in his heart: what\u2019s so interesting about someone cursing you out from behind your back? Someone cursing you out in front of you would be something truly stunning!)\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Xu ZiYan hid behind a huge rock as he carefully examined Xu ZiRong\u2019s body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt this time, although Xu ZiRong still couldn\u2019t move, he was finally able to speak. He quickly reassured Xu ZiYan that he was alright, before he reminded his brother to be careful of that mermaid.Xu ZiYan nodded vigorously before saying, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re fine, that\u2019s good. Just now, I actually didn\u2019t realize there was something wrong with you. That\u2019s something that truly shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dThe expression on Xu ZiRong\u2019s face was also somewhat dignified. Ever since he was reborn, everything had proceeded in a smooth manner. After so many years, he actually became a bit careless.Just now, after he and Xu ZiYan entered this clearing, he unexpectedly and unwittingly entered a fantasy array. If he hadn\u2019t noticed how Xu ZiYan had been a bit off in the fantasy array, he wouldn\u2019t have managed to break out of it that quickly.However, he would have never expected to see Xu ZiYan approach that ferocious mermaid the moment he broke out of the array. In addition, he himself was suddenly controlled by some sort of power. He couldn\u2019t move his body nor speak any words. This kind of feeling of being suppressed by someone, helpless and unable to retaliate, immediately made him remember some of his extremely unpleasant memories\u2026\u2026Face becoming gloomy, Xu ZiRong glared at that mermaid. His gaze looked as if he was itching to dismember the mermaid into ten thousand pieces. Unfortunately, he was still unable to move a single step right now, and thus he could only use his glare against that mermaid.After carefully hiding Xu ZiRong behind the rock, Xu ZiYan pursed his lips and turned around. He planned to go and get rid of that mermaid.A few threads of sadness appeared in his expression as Xu ZiYan mocked himself. Sure enough, his understanding of his world was still not deep enough. The more beautiful something or someone were, the more dangerous they were, ah\u2026\u2026That mermaid was still soaking within the hot spring. When she saw Xu ZiYan emerge once more, hints of happiness appeared on her face. The food that escaped actually returned, it was truly great!After Xu ZiYan stood in a stable position, he pulled back his bow to shoot an arrow. Immediately, an arrow made out of lightning spiritual energy formed on his bow and flew toward the mermaid.That mermaid revealed a look that made it seem as if she had been wronged. She stared at Xu ZiYan with a blaming gaze, as if she was finding fault with how he had actually made a move to attack her.To be honest, if the mermaid hadn\u2019t almost slit his throat just now, just by looking at her current expression and attitude, Xu ZiYan was afraid that he would never believe this mermaid was actually a monster that would murder without blinking and even less that she was a demonic beast that fed upon the flesh of humans.This only proved that this mermaid\u2019s beauty was truly too bewitching. Even Xu ZiYan had temporarily made the mistake of judging a book by its cover.The moment he became aware of how dangerous his opponent was, Xu ZiYan no longer held back. He pulled back his bowstring over and over again. Every time he pulled it back, at least three arrows made out of lightning spiritual energy shot out.The endless wave of arrows seemed to have made that mermaid very angry. She pouted as she fumed, her face crimson red, looking as if she had suffered some sort of huge grievance. It looked like she was going to burst into tears the very next moment.Xu ZiYan\u2019s expression was ice-cold and blank. He had already learned the lesson he was just given. If he became soft-hearted now, then he would really be a complete fool!The next moment, he began praising himself for this decision.That mermaid suddenly opened her mouth to emit a resounding howl. What immediately followed that was the corners of her pink lips suddenly ripping apart, until the opening crack reached her earlobes. The teeth in her mouth also became incomparably sharp. One only need a single glance at her to know she was a violent, wild beast.A layer of cyan scales covered her pale and fair skin. Her round, wet black eyes also turned silver in colour, with vertical slits as pupils\u2014\u2014looking ice-cold and ruthless.At this point, the mermaid finally abandoned its own disguise, exposing her original and most primitive combat form.As soon as she transformed, the mermaid\u2019s fighting strength practically soared. Increasingly more different kinds of water elemental attacks were released in an endless manner.Fortunately, although she had many tricks, her strength was suppressed. Several times, Xu ZiYan\u2019s arrows made out of lightning spiritual energy struck her attacks head-on, before both disappeared without a trace.Xu ZiYan realized that if they continued to dally like this, his spiritual energy won\u2019t be able to last. Thus, Xu ZiYan clenched his teeth and released a protective shield. Then, he stopped moving and stood in one place before slowing pulling back his bowstring.Following his movements, a ray of lightning that was as thick as someone\u2019s arm formed on the bow. At the top of the arrow, the purple lightning was compressed so much, it was already at the point where it looked black in colour.That mermaid probably also sensed it was dangerous. She opened her bloody mouth and began roaring in a frantic manner. Her moving hands also accelerated a great deal as water arrows, water bombs, and even water dragons all rushed out at an insane pace.Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t the waters where her species lived. Even if she yelled in a louder voice, there wouldn\u2019t be members of her species to come and aid her.A second before Xu ZiYan\u2019s thunderstorm-like arrow completely formed, that mermaid began laying out water shields in front of herself. The water in the hot spring began disappearing at a speed visible to the naked eye. Instantly, at least seven or eight layers of water shields condensed in front of the mermaid.The bowstring was finally stretched out to its limit. Xu ZiYan\u2019s gaze was sharp as his fingers slightly relaxed\u2014\u2014A rumbling noise suddenly thundered through the air. That ray of lightning rapidly flew out with a berserk aura as it pounced toward the mermaid.Alarmed, the mermaid began to scream. This thunderstorm arrow could be considered as Xu ZiYan\u2019s current trump card. If it hadn\u2019t been for this troublesome mermaid, he would have never wanted to reveal it.With a fierce momentum, the bright and glaring arrow made out of lightning penetrated layer by layer of the water shields the mermaid had created. There was already no need to use words to describe the horror on the mermaid\u2019s face. She widened her eyes. Within her silver pupils, one could only see the black tip of an arrow approach her bit by bit. At the split second before the arrow was about to penetrate her body\u2014\u2014The pluck of a string sounded in the air.As if they were bubbles, the entire scene began collapsing. That mermaid\u2019s expression turned quite bewildered and hazy. It was like she had forgotten she was almost killed, forgotten the enemy standing right before her, forgotten\u2014\u2014everything.She once again transformed back into her innocent and cute appearance before she began cheerfully playing around in the hot springs. Soon after, a burst of ripple-like fluctuations began distorting the scene before Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyes. The mermaid and the hot spring she was in began to disappear. What was left was a small and narrow path on the mountain side opposite to them, one that extended outwards.After putting away the longbow he was holding, Xu ZiYan inhaled deeply. It could be considered that he finally passed this round. As for what followed next, it was time to take a look at the next round!\u201cBig brother,\u201d ever since the mermaid disappeared, whatever restrained Xu ZiRong vanished as well.He leisurely climbed up from the ground, where every movement was infused with an indescribable elegance.Xu ZiRong lightly pulled on Xu ZiYan\u2019s sleeves, before he stared at his brother with limpid eyes that were full of worship and adoration. \u201cBig brother is so powerful.\u201dXu ZiYan\u2019s heroic spirit immediately surged forward when he saw his little brother\u2019s worshiping expression. He chuckled and said, \u201cIt was just a mere trifle. Later, watch your big brother win first place!\u201dXu ZiRong smiled, his eyes turning into crescents. \u201cBig brother is the most amazing.\u201dXu ZiYan\u2019s mood became much better. In fact, the dismay that had just emerged because of how he had been deceived by the mermaid vanished without a single trace.If one compared his current strength to the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s, they wouldn\u2019t even be able to measure just how much stronger he was. Even if the original Xu ZiYan took his place today, he was afraid that he would be unable to do much better than himself.If he thought about it, in his nearly thirty years of life in his previous world, he had always lived in a very peaceful place. Although the business world had the same mutual deception and dog-eat-dog world concept, it would never pose any danger to one\u2019s life. Therefore\u2026\u2026in reality, he truly ought to praise his own adapting capabilities.Since even the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s life developed so well, there would be no reason for someone like him, a person well-acquainted with the plot, to die a violent death\u2014\u2014right?\u2018Ahh\u2026\u2026let\u2019s take things one step at a time. If worst comes to worst, let\u2019s just hide front the male protagonist.\u2019 Once again, Xu ZiYan made a firm decision to stay far away from Bai Hua.After all, in the original text, although Bai Hua admittedly obtained unceasing opportunities that arrived one after another, immense danger and a crisis followed every one of those opportunities. Other than Bai Hua\u2019s boyfriends who made it out fine every time, there were countless people who died because of those crises. Since Xu ZiYan decided to not become one of Bai Hua\u2019s boyfriends\u2014\u2014of course, he would want to stay away from those crises.And although he practically watered at the mouth at the thought of the protagonist\u2019s opportunities, the novel had described the rules very clearly. Apart from Bai Hua\u2019s three boyfriends, anyone else who tried stealing Bai Hua\u2019s opportunities all died a violent death\u2026\u2026Xu ZiYan hadn\u2019t lived enough after he inexplicably reincarnated into this world. In order to cherish life, he must hide far away from Bai Hua!After passing through the mountain wall by taking the small path that had appeared, the two brothers continued to climb to the mountain peak.The distance between their position and the Liu Guang Sect\u2019s summit was rapidly shortening. However, while the Xu brothers scaled the mountain, there were already Elders in the Liu Guang Sect main hall who were about to fight each other in order to secure their right to take the brothers as their disciples\u2026\u2026When it came to talented disciples, these Elders would never think they had too many.Unexpectedly, even that Wei Ying didn\u2019t want to miss obtaining the Xu brothers, those good seedlings. With no trace of politeness, he began arguing for them with those old men.\u201cWei Ying, what are you participating in this for? Isn\u2019t it certain that the youngster from your Wei family will be sworn in under your door?\u201d An Elder with a white beard and white hair gasped in anger. \u201cWith such a good younger generation like him, why are you still not satisfied?\u201dWei Ying offhandedly replied, \u201cHey! I don\u2019t dare to guarantee that. Although the children of our Wei family are outstanding, it isn\u2019t certain that he will throw himself under my door.\u201d\u201cOh? If that\u2019s really true, then I won\u2019t be polite,\u201d a middle-aged woman said with a gentle chuckle.\u201cWhatever,\u201d Wei Ying waved his big hand. \u201cIf that brat doesn\u2019t want to worship someone as his master, you could break his neck and he would still refuse to do it. In any case, I can\u2019t control him. If you could make him worship you as a master, then that is your skill.\u201dSomething flashed through the middle-aged woman\u2019s eyes. She couldn\u2019t help but start pondering the possibility of recruiting Wei Qing.A young girl in the prime of youth shook the sleeve of another icily arrogant-looking woman. \u201cSenior-apprentice sister Zhou, look\u2026\u2026that Xu ZiRong is so powerful ah, maybe you should stand in for Master and take him in as a disciple?\u201dIn response, Zhou XueTing couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cLittle Peach, why did you suddenly think about recruiting disciples for Master?\u201dLittle Peach\u2014\u2014she was precisely that young girl who looked very cute, shook her head. \u201cHe he, don\u2019t you think this Xu ZiRong looks very delicate? When he grows up a little bit in the future, it\u2019s certain he\u2019ll be able to attract many female disciples to our Shu Yun Peak. When that time comes, our Shu Yun Peak may become Liu Guang Sect\u2019s most prosperous Peak!\u201dNormally, Zhou XueTing was expressionless. However, whenever she was with Little Peach, the girl\u2019s bold and imaginative way of thinking always made her smile.\u201cNonsense,\u201d she quietly chided her. \u201cThis Xu ZiRong, he cultivates Wood Element martial arts\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that even better? Senior-apprentice sister, you also cultivate Wood Element martial arts. When the time comes, giving him pointers would be a super easy, trivial matter!\u201d Little Peach quickly cut her off.Zhou XueTing shook her head. \u201cWe were only watching him through our water mirror, however, when he attacked HongYun, Wood Element martial arts doesn\u2019t seem to be the only thing playing a role in those three, blood huge vines of his.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s weird about that?\u201d Little Peach asked in a disapproving manner. \u201cI already read his file. This Xu ZiRong has a Tri-Spirit Vein for water, wood, and earth. Mixing other things into his Wood Element martial arts wouldn\u2019t be something strange. What\u2019s more\u2026\u2026at eleven years old, with his Tri-Spirit Vein aptitude, he actually managed to cultivate to the eighth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. From this, it can be clearly seen that he either has a body suitable for cultivation, or\u2026\u2026he has extremely high comprehension skills.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The martial arts passed down in their Shu Yun Peak attached heavy importance to comprehension. There were two reasons for someone like her to be only twenty yet already possess the early stage of Golden Core stage cultivation. One reason was because she grew up in Liu Guang Sect. She had received her elders\u2019 protection in no small measure, and she never lacked various kinds of resources. However, the second reason was precisely because she possessed astonishing comprehension skills.People with merely good spiritual veins were easy to seek, but cultivators with good comprehension were hard to find. If one thought about it, in their entire Shu Yun Peak, Zhou XueTing was the only one with such good comprehension skills.It was also precisely because Shu Yun Peak\u2019s martial arts had too high standards for comprehension, that the disciples on their peak was the least among the seven main peaks of Liu Guang Sect. If it wasn\u2019t because their Master\u2019s strength was outstanding, being able to suppress other Peak Lords by a head with her late stage Nascent Soul cultivation level, perhaps they would have already been moved out of Shu Yung Peak.When she saw how Zhou XueTing\u2019s heart seemed to have stirred somewhat, Little Peach became even more spirited. In short, in her point of view, Xu ZiRong was good in this way and good in that way, basically, he didn\u2019t have any bad points. If they didn\u2019t manage to recruit him to Shu Yun Peak, then it was simply a loss for everyone in their Peak!\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Little Peach. You\u2019ve been noisy enough that my head already started hurting,\u201d Zhou XueTing helplessly rubbed her temples. Whenever Little Peach got excited, her voice would unconsciously get louder and louder. Although the other people in the main hall were also arguing very loudly, Little Peach\u2019s voice obviously possessed the best penetration attribute.\u201cOh? XueTing ah, are you intending to accept disciples on behalf of your Master?\u201d An elderly man with a white beard asked with affection.Zhou XueTing promptly replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Martial Uncle Wu. Little Peach keeps on recommending this Xu ZiRong to me.\u201d After she finished speaking, she secretly gave Little Peach a glare in a helpless manner.Little Peach stealthily stuck out her tongue, before she shrunk back her head, not daring to speak.This Martial Uncle Wu was definitely a very good person, but for some unknown reason, he was particularly fond of going against their Master. Their friendship built on their noisy quarrels had got to be a few centuries old. However, they still acted like children, and they liked competing against each other in almost everything.\u201cXu ZiRong?\u201d The white bearded elder naturally knew who this person was, but that child\u2019s brilliance seemed to always be covered up by his brother. He hadn\u2019t expected this Little Peach to actually have such sharp eyes.He glanced at Little Peach, only to notice how the other was currently hiding behind Zhou XueTing like she was lacking confidence. He thought about it before realizing that this little girl was definitely afraid he would try snatching potential disciples with that old woman.Speaking of that\u2026\u2026it seemed like it had been three or five years since he last accepted a disciple?The white bearded elderly man stroked the strands of his beard on his chin as he started pondering. Hmm, should he fight over a disciple with that old woman?But within a blink of an eye, he abandoned this thought and threw it to the back of his mind. That old woman herself wasn\u2019t even here, even if he did snatch away a disciple, he wouldn\u2019t feel a sense of accomplishment.The white-bearded elder didn\u2019t continue paying attention to Xu ZiRong. The martial arts he practiced did not match either of the Xu family brothers. Thus, no matter what kind of amazing achievements these two boys obtained, they wouldn\u2019t end up worshipping him as their Master.Within the main hall, numerous Golden Core elders were attentively watching every move that happened in the water mirror. The people in the water mirror were naturally the \u2018preparatory disciples\u2019 they were paying attention to.The white-bearded elder had always been closely following Xiahou Lian. Xiahou Lian\u2019s Dual Water and Wood Spiritual Veins actually extremely fitted the martial arts he practiced, the Embodiment of the Wooden Lotus Secret Arts. However, this Xiahou Lian was also a popular disciple everyone was fighting over, so he wasn\u2019t sure if he would be able to win her.At the same time\u2014\u2014After Xu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong experienced the test with the mermaid, they followed the mountain road behind the flat land and advanced up the mountain. After walking for approximately half a shichen1, they arrived at the summit.The summit of the mountain was coincidentally arranged in a crisscross pattern with another peak. The two peaks were connected by a wooden bridge that was about a chi2in width.An ash-grey stone tablet stood on this side of the wooden bridge. Three big characters written in seal script3 were carved onto the tablet: Li Chen4 Bridge. It obviously had the meaning of separating oneself away from the mundane world.Xu ZiYan took a deep breath. The hand he used to hold Xu ZiRong\u2019s hand also tightened unnaturally. The moment he stepped onto this Li Chen Bridge, it meant that he could never return to those peaceful and happy days of the past. At such a pivotal moment like this, even if Xu ZiYan had long did some mental preparations, it was inevitable that he would still feel a bit fretful.It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t thought about bringing Xu ZiRong far away from the cultivation world, so they could find a peaceful small town to pass this life. However, he couldn\u2019t allow himself to so selfishly decide Xu ZiRong\u2019s entire future.In addition\u2026\u2026in the end, after coming to a world like this, if he hid away without giving the cultivation life a shot, even Xu ZiYan would look down on himself.\u201cBig brother?\u201d Xu ZiRong stared at Xu ZiYan in confusion. He didn\u2019t know what his brother was hesitating over.As long as Xu ZiYan stepped onto this bridge, with his achievements in the test, he would absolutely become one of the top inner disciples. Even if there was another test afterwards, it could be assumed that those Elders of the Liu Guang Sect definitely wouldn\u2019t want to let go of a good seedling like him.Regarding his own prospects, Xu ZiRong wasn\u2019t worried at all. With his cultivation at his current age, it could be also assumed that he won\u2019t be assigned to be one of Liu Guang Sect\u2019s outer disciples. And as for which Elder he would worship to be a Master, Xu ZiRong personally didn\u2019t care at all.After all, his Blood Sea Heart Sutra was a top-notch martial arts technique. Since he already possessed the Heart Sutra, everything else he learned were merely just supplements.\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d When he saw the concern in Xu ZiRong\u2019s gaze, Xu ZiYan\u2019s heart softened as the resolve in his eyes became more firm.He turned to look at the wooden bridge with mist swirling around it and slowly closed his eyes. By the time he reopened his eyes, the last trace of bewilderment in his gaze thoroughly subsided.Xu ZiYan walked across the Li Chen Bridge in a very relaxed manner. When he reached the other mountain peak, he found a man wearing light blue robes watching him with a smile.\u201cCongratulations, you are the first person to arrive here,\u201d the smile on the man\u2019s face was very gentle, making one feel close to him.\u201cThank you,\u201d Xu ZiYan sincerely expressed his thanks. He didn\u2019t know whether or not it was the Li Chen Bridge\u2019s special effect, but he felt as if his heart had lighten loads after walking across it. All the annoying mental knots that had been accumulating in his heart these past years seemed to have vanished without a trace. He felt as if his whole person had been refreshed.The man wearing blue robes smiled, before his gaze passed by his shoulders to look at the person behind him.Xu ZiYan followed his gaze and looked over as well. As expected, Xu ZiRong had also crossed the Li Chen Bridge, thus arriving at Liu Guang Sect\u2019s main peak, Qian Yuan Peak.\u201cYou are the second person to arrive here, congratulations.\u201d When the blue-robbed man faced Xu ZiRong, his attitude clearly became somewhat indifferent. The man shot Xu ZiRong a faint glance, but didn\u2019t say anything more.Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t notice this man\u2019s attitude. Currently, his expression looked somewhat bewildered, and even Xu ZiYan was able to notice his uneasiness.\u201cSince you already entered my Sect, you must abide by my rules. Your killing nature is too strong. If you do not wish to implicate your close ones, you will have to be cautious when evoking your killing intent.\u201d While Xu ZiRong felt quite uneasy, the blue-robbed man suddenly passed on a transmitted message that flitted past his ear.Xu ZiRong\u2019s eyes suddenly narrowed, before he rigidly stared at the man in front of him.\u201cZiRong? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Xu ZiYan\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He had noticed that the blue-robbed man in front of them seemed to not like Xu ZiRong that much, but he would have never expected ZiRong to use such a hateful look to glare at the other.The man clothed in blue turned a blind eye to the gaze brimming with hostility. He merely gave Xu ZiRong an indifferent glance. But, only this one glance, made Xu ZiRong\u2019s pupils suddenly shrink before he bowed his head.Cold sweat spread across his white and fair forehead. Xu ZiRong only felt as if someone had poured a pail of cold water on him during the twenty seven days after the Winter Solstice, the coldest days of the year. It felt as if the man had completely saw through him.He wasn\u2019t this man\u2019s match!The blue-robbed man standing in front of them emanated an extremely dangerous feeling. Let\u2019s not say his current self who was merely just a child at the Qi Condensation Stage. Xu ZiRong was afraid that even if it was the him at his peak from his past life, he still wouldn\u2019t be an opponent for the man in front of him.After he calmed down, Xu ZiRong realized something. This man didn\u2019t seem to have any intentions of exposing him. If that wasn\u2019t the case, the other wouldn\u2019t need to specifically transmit a message to himself.Xu ZiRong curbed the hostility in his gaze. After respectfully saluting the man, he spoke up gently, \u201cI apologize. Just now, my state of mind had been very unstable. I\u2019ve truly been lacking in manners.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no bother,\u201d the man dressed in blue was still as indifferent as before. It seemed like no matter how Xu ZiRong treated him, whether it be with respect or with hostility, the man still wouldn\u2019t feel much.Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t help but frown. He felt as if something had just happened right now. However, although Xu ZiRong acted very cute and obedient in front of him, after three years, he had long understood the other\u2019s stubbornness. If Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t want to say anything, even if it was him, he wouldn\u2019t be able to pry any information from that mouth of his\u2026\u2026\u201cThis place, go straight, the third round requires everyone else to all be present before it could start. You guys can first take a rest in the plaza outside the main hall.\u201d The man in blue said softly.After Xu ZiYan thanked him, he began walking forward with Xu ZiRong in a quick pace. Although this blue-robbed man looked gentle, he kept feeling as though this man was quite hostile towards ZiRong.\u201cBig brother, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Xu ZiRong\u2019s heart softened, and the expression on his face began relaxing as well.He believed that even if the man from before was extremely powerful, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have known how he had been reincarnated. Since that was the case, at most, the blue-robbed man would have only noticed the bloody atmosphere surrounding his body, and thus probably believed he had learned some kind of demonic arts.When he thought of that, Xu ZiRong couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh of relief. In his last life, the reason his path had never intertwined with the Liu Guang Sect was precisely because Liu Guang Sect\u2019s attitude toward demonic cultivation was much better compared to the attitudes of other Righteous Sects. In the very least, cultivators from this Sect wouldn\u2019t want to fight a battle where only one side was left standing the moment he saw a demonic cultivator. One had to know that sometimes, the scum from the Righteous Sects did much more ruthless things compared to demonic cultivators.The two of them didn\u2019t walk for long before they saw a magnificent and gorgeous main hall. The doors of the main hall were tightly shut, and two youths dressed in white robes were guarding them. However, the doors on the sides of a side palace hall were wide open, and some food and water were laid out inside.\u201cWho comes hither?\u201d One of the two white-clothed youths asked in a stern tone.\u201cInner disciple candidate Xu ZiYan/Xu ZiRong, greets both senior-apprentice brothers.\u201d The two brothers replied at the same time.When that white-clothed youth heard their reply, he immediately smiled. \u201cSo it turned out to be two junior-apprentice brothers. Please wait for a little bit longer, the third round of your examination can only start after all the candidates are gathered here.\u201dAfter Xu ZiYan thanked the two of them, he went to the side palace hall to choose some food before eating. Although his inter-spatial bag was stuffed full with fasting pellets, those things were practically light-years apart from the word \u2018delicious\u2019.Xu ZiRong also indifferently ate some food as well. In regards to fasting pellets, he definitely didn\u2019t abhor them as badly as Xu ZiYan. However, as long as it was food Xu ZiYan personally cooked, he absolutely wouldn\u2019t miss eating it.As for these things\u2026\u2026it was nothing more than him eating them for big brother to see.After they waited for approximately half a day, some qualified candidates began arriving at the doors of the main hall one after another.Xu ZiYan had long ate his fill. Currently, he was mediating with his eyes closed in a peaceful corner. If the following third round hadn\u2019t changed, then the rest of them still had to eat some sufferings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who knew what kind of problems each of them had encountered in the second part of the exam, but there were actually many people who were injured.At this moment, Hu YuTian\u2019s normally gloomy face had an even larger black cloud surrounding it. One could sense the low pressure his body was emanating even without approaching him.Wei Qing\u2019s face had the same haughty expression as before. However, he would occasionally sneak glances at Xu ZiYan. Then, as if realizing there was a possibility of Xu ZiYan noticing his actions, he would suddenly turn his head away\u2026\u2026Xiahou Lian was still beaming like always, looking as if she had effortlessly passed the second round. And as for that seemingly very cute but in reality very dangerous little girl, she was currently pouting in a sulky manner.Xu ZiYan swept his gaze around in a circle before he finally found Yu Hao in an unremarkable corner. Last time, Yu Hao reached the foot of the mountain only a step slower than the Xu family brothers. However, this time, he was the seventh person that arrived at the main hall.In addition, Xu ZiYan realized something after carefully observing everyone. Among the people who made it here, only a minority had the same strings as his tied onto their arms or legs. It seemed like the reason the original Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t get this kind of \u2018special treatment\u2019 in his last life was because his results had been too ordinary.Regarding Yu Hao, don\u2019t just look at how his behaviour was sneaky and how his appearance wasn\u2019t the most astonishing. This guy was truly an expert at collecting information. Perhaps it was because he innately possessed sensitivity to all kinds of information, but in the near future, he would establish the largest intelligence agency in Xuan Yu region\u2014\u2014Qian Wen1 Pavilion.It was a pity the original Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t know who the boss behind Qian Wen Pavilion was. However, based on Yu Hao\u2019s strength, it was impossible for him to be the real boss of that place.Should he recruit Yu Hao to his side?Xu ZiYan was somewhat hesitant over this. The current Yu Hao hadn\u2019t displayed any abilities. On the contrary, since the martial arts he practiced wasn\u2019t suitable for combat, he didn\u2019t have much status at Hu YuTian\u2019s side. If Xu ZiYan wanted to entice him to his own side, now was the best time to do it.No one understood the importance of information better than him, and the way no one in the whole Xuan Yu region dared to offend the boss of Qian Wen Pavilion during the later half of the story was the best fact supporting that.One could find relevant information about all kinds of heavenly materials and treasures, secret realms and legendary immortal abodes, and practically anything found in the Xuan Yu region from Qian Wen Pavilion.But of course, the more precious the treasure was, the more expensive the price would be for the information. Reportedly, there was someone who had asked about a secret realm hidden in the sea. He spent all their money to purchase a map of that secret realm. Afterwards, he luckily managed to return. In a single month, he managed to jump from the early stage to the later stage of Golden Core Formation realm, so much that he was now just a single step away from the Nascent Soul realm.After the news about that spread, the entire Xuan Yu region kicked up a fuss. Since then, no one questioned the validity of Qian Wen Pavilion\u2019s information. As long as one had the money, they would be able to buy any kind of information.The extremely lucky person within the rumours was precisely the novel\u2019s protagonist, Bai Hua. In addition, not only did he obtain a great amount of medicinal pellets that could increase one\u2019s cultivation realm from this trip, he also caught a sea beast to be his spiritual pet.Afterwards, that sea dragon2 saved Bai Hua from calamity numerous times during his various adventures.It was decided!He could think more about all of this after he recruited Yu Hao to his side!Who knew where Qian Wen Pavilion\u2019s boss was right now? If Xu ZiYan made a move this early on, for all he knew, the future Qian Wen Pavilion would be his property!Xu ZiYan hadn\u2019t hesitated for long before he made up his mind.Although the behind-the-scenes boss of Qian Wen Pavilion hadn\u2019t been mentioned throughout the whole novel or within the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories, one could deduce from Yu Hao\u2019s abrupt rise in power that the boss behind him wasn\u2019t much older than him. Perhaps their age might even be similar to Xu ZiYan\u2019s.This also meant that Xu ZiYan\u2019s move to recruit Yu Hao definitely wouldn\u2019t cause that person to take revenge on him. After all, that \u2018boss\u2019 may not have even discovered Yu Hao yet.After figuring out this, Xu ZiYan shifted his gaze toward Yu Hao. When the boy glanced at him, he smiled slightly as he nodded at him.Yu Hao\u2019s expression froze for a moment, before he silently twisted his neck and looked away\u2026\u2026Xu ZiYan rubbed his nose and sweatdropped. He had completely forgotten how he had just robbed Yu Hao in the previous task.After everyone arrived, there were less than approximately 30 candidates remaining. If these people could pass the third part of the exam, then they would become Liu Guang Sect\u2019s inner-sect disciples. The disciple exam for Liu Guang Sect was admittedly pretty hard. However, the moment they passed, they could enjoy the treatment of the inner-sect disciples and obtain all kinds of resources according to their capabilities. Their benefits were absolutely incomparable to what the average outer-sect disciples received.After the clock sounded three times, the door to the main palace hall slowly opened. Numerous cultivators wearing all kinds of clothes filed out of the building.The person at the front of the line was a pale-faced middle-aged man without a beard who wore a bright red chang pao3. His expression looked very kind and his eyes were clear. The gaze he used to look at every one seemed very gentle.Xu ZiYan knew that this was none other than the Liu Guang Sect\u2019s Sect Leader\u2014\u2014 WuChen DaoJun4.As WuChen DaoJun watched these outstanding and vigourous youngsters, he couldn\u2019t help but reveal a smile on his face. In the future, these people would all become the pillars of Liu Guang Sect\u2019s next generation. It was precisely because they existed that the Liu Guang Sect would be able to continue its unending growth as a Sect.\u201cSince ye were able to pass through Li Chen Bridge, ye have become inner-sect disciples of my Liu Guang Sect. The purpose of the third part of the exam is to better everyone\u2019s wisdom. The longer ye persevere, the more benefits ye shall gain.\u201d WuChen DaoJun\u2019s short speech made everyone reveal surprised expressions.But right after their shock, they became very excited. So, it turned out that the third part of the exam wasn\u2019t actually a test and was rather something that would give them benefits. In other words, they were already inner-sect disciples of Liu Guang Sect.All the candidates had happy and cheery expressions on their faces. Those who knew each other began sending out their mutual congratulations.Although Xu ZiYan was also smiling, there weren\u2019t any hints of relaxation within his gaze. On the contrary, his eyes seemed even more grave.When WuChen DaoJun saw how happy the candidates were, he merely smiled brightly before standing to the side. Although the Elders surrounding him also had a smile on their faces, there were slight differences between them.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get ready to begin the third part,\u201d WuChen DaoJun saw how most of the candidates had calmed down, and thus spoke up in a warm voice.Because of his gesture, all of the candidates began promptly clearing out an open space in front of the main palace hall. They stood on the stairs of the side palace hall, anxiously waiting as they watched WuChen DaoJun.WuChen DaoJun pinched his fingers to activate a secret martial arts technique. Immediately, the spiritual energy in the open space began bubbling forward as it began emitting a dim blue light. As the blue light grew stronger, a lot of complicated patterns began appearing on the slabs of glossy limestone currently present.The blue light flashed once before vanishing, which also caused the decorative patterns to disappear in an instant, as if they were flowers of Dutchman\u2019s Pipe Cactus5The open space was still there. However, nobody knew exactly when, but delicate threads of mist had appeared on top of the space. In addition, it hadn\u2019t taken long for the mist to completely conceal the open space.\u201cEnter. Please bear in mind that the longer ye persist, the more benefits ye shall gain.\u201d WuChen DaoJun\u2019s expression grew solemn as he seriously reminded everyone.The spiritual array he had just activated was something fundamental that was passed down for generations within the Liu Guang Sect. Using this spiritual array was a complicated matter as it served many different purposes.Sharpening one\u2019s wisdom was only one of those functions. The more important function was that this spiritual array had the ability to discern whether or not any of these disciples were possessed or controlled by an outsider. They implemented this part of the exam to prevent bestial cultivators or cultivators from a demonic sect from planting their spies in the Liu Guang Sect. After all, if any of these inner-sect disciples were controlled by others, the moment Liu Guang Sect waged war again bestial cultivators, the damage suffered because of spies would be beyond measure.In addition to the functions previously mentioned, this spiritual array could also examine the disciples\u2019 spiritual veins and spiritual bodies. Examining spiritual veins was rather easy, but it was hard to get a good look at one\u2019s spiritual body. A person that possessed a spiritual body, had potential that definitely wouldn\u2019t lose to someone who possessed a Heavenly spiritual vein.As he stared at that lump of dense smoke, Xu ZiYan lowered his voice and spoke to Xu ZiRong, \u201cAfter you go in, you must persevere for as long as possible.\u201dHe was afraid that Xu ZiRong wouldn\u2019t be able to preserve for long, so he couldn\u2019t help but stress the importance of this to him once again. Although staying inside that array was very painful, the benefits they would gain couldn\u2019t even be described with words.When the original Xu ZiYan experienced this, because he hadn\u2019t suffered any torment ever since he was young, he only stayed in the array for a bit before leaving it. However, after he found out from other people what the array did, he regretted this for an entire half-year.Xu ZiRong lightly nodded his head. After meeting that blue-robed man from before, the contempt he had toward the Liu Guang Sect had long vanished without a trace.This was an enormous Sect that had thrived for a millennium. In his last life, Xu ZiRong had actually believed that the Blood Devil\u2019s Castle he had built himself was capable of confronting this kind of large Sect. It was simply a huge joke.According to the achievements he obtained in the last two parts of the exam, Xu ZiYan was fully worthy of being the first person to enter the spiritual array.There were a lot of people who felt disgusted that someone like him, who had popped out of nowhere, ended up becoming the top candidate of this year\u2019s inner-sect disciple exam.This was especially the case for the teenagers who really admired Wei Qing, Xiahou Lian, and Hu TianYu. To them, Xu ZiYan was nothing more than a lucky bastard.Xu ZiYan began mentally encouraging himself. Despite how he had long known what was going to happen in the spiritual array, Xu ZiYan was still very anxious.He mocked himself in his heart. At times like this, it would have been better had he went in completely ignorant. After all, at the very least, he wouldn\u2019t be this nervous.Composing himself and receiving another one of Xu ZiRong\u2019s worshipping gazes, Xu ZiYan took firm steps with his head high and his chest out\u2014\u2014 and then entered the spiritual array.The split-second he entered the fog, his figure faded away. Then, he immediately appeared in the middle of an empty wilderness.Even though he knew this was one of the functions of the spiritual array, Xu ZiYan was still shocked by how real his surroundings looked.He leaned down to grab a handful of sandy soil. The bits and pieces of the sand began sliding through the spaces between his fingers and falling onto the ground. The feeling of the coarse sand granules truly felt incomparably real, and he couldn\u2019t even see the smallest trace of imitation.At the end of the distant sky stood an enormous, tall, and erect stone statue that reached through the clouds as it towered over the wasteland. It was lofty and extended upwards in a boundless manner. At first glance, one\u2019s eyes would be faintly attracted there.\u201cLet\u2019s stake it all!\u201d Xu ZiYan cursed quietly. Don\u2019t be misled by how tranquil and serene the place currently looked. He knew that the moment he took a step forward, what followed next would be an extremely dangerous attack.Xu ZiYan raised his foot to take his first step\u2014\u2014Immediately, the weather of the heavens and earth began changing.The azure sky free of clouds from before seemed to have been split apart by a sudden ray of thunder. In a flash, darkness descended as screaming gales of wind began tormenting the wasteland.Xu ZiYan began walking forward as the wind worked against him. His footsteps was extremely quick. Although the wind was very strong, it was at best high resistance force. He wouldn\u2019t dare to waste his spiritual energy shield against the strong gales of wind.In a single breath, he rushed a hundred meters forward. The wind was becoming increasingly stronger, and the grains of sand whipped up by the gales felt the same as knife cuts as they hit his face. They made many gashes of blood.Xu ZiYan continued to rush forward with his head lowered as both of his hands protected his face. The stronger the wind, the bigger the rocks it could blow up. Just now, a rock the size of his fist flew past his forehead. If it wasn\u2019t for his quick reflexes and how he had finally activated his spiritual energy shield, his head might have been bleeding profusely now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The black clouds that had spread in the sky finally started to release their raindrops. Accompanied by the sound of pitter patter, they began falling onto Xu ZiYan\u2019s body.Xu ZiYan\u2019s heart tightened. He hadn\u2019t expected the rainstorm to arrive this quickly. It actually came so much earlier than it did for the original Xu ZiYan.The raindrops quickly soaked his clothes. The drenched fabric sticking to his body felt extremely uncomfortable, but at a time like this, he couldn\u2019t be bothered by it.Pursing his lips, Xu ZiYan began marching firmly toward the stone statue as he rapidly advanced forward. The falling raindrops began quickly congregating on the wasteland, making it seem like the vast wasteland had turned into a huge body of water.The ground beneath his feet was soaked with rainwater, and a thick layer of mud stuck to his shoes. Xu ZiYan\u2019s footsteps became increasingly heavier, but he just grit his teeth and increased his speed.The raindrops became bigger. In the end, after Xu ZiYan crossed over a large area of mud, the drops turned into hard granules\u2014\u2014 hail.Xu ZiYan\u2019s face turned expressionless. The rain and wind from before were merely a side dish to whet one\u2019s appetite. From this moment onward, this spiritual array was going to expose its sinister teeth and claws.Hailstones as big as a finger very quickly turned into hailstones as big as a fist. When something as heavy as that fell out of the sky, with the additional strength of the wind, they smashed into the ground and were embedded half an inch into the dirt.Xu ZiYan decisively widened the area of his spiritual energy shield. The howling wind and hail were immediately isolated outside his shield. It made him feel a lot more relaxed.The wasteland had already turned into a swamp, in which the gleaming surface made it simply impossible to see what was underneath the water.Xu ZiYan began staggering forward, a deep step here and a shallow step there. However, he hadn\u2019t even gone a hundred zhang before he exhausted all of his spiritual energy. His spiritual energy shield immediately collapsed, and those hailstones the size of a fist began hitting his body.\u201cF*ck, it hurts so much!\u201d Xu ZiYan was smashed into a very miserable state, badly battered with a bloody nose and a swollen face.He hadn\u2019t expected the rainstorm and hail to use up his body\u2019s spiritual energy this quickly. Right now, he could only endure and move forward with his will.Xu ZiYan tried his utmost to protect his head because he no longer had the ability to care about the rest of his body. As he walked, he couldn\u2019t help but enjoy himself despite his sufferings and muse: if someone took this fantasy array and brought it back to the modern times, they could probably create a 99% real virtual reality game with no problems, right?After he once again walked another hundred zhang, the clouds in the sky began scattering as the fog dissipated as well. A light drizzle began to fall. When he saw the sunshine that was gradually peeking through the clouds, Xu ZiYan actually felt a bit reminiscent of his past life.After the rain, the skies cleared. On top of the wasteland, plant sprouts began popping up. The caress of a cool breeze brushed past, and those plant sprouts immediately began growing. It hadn\u2019t taken many breaths before the wasteland turned into a prairie.Immediately, sirens began blaring out an alarm in Xu ZiYan\u2019s heart. There wasn\u2019t much spiritual energy left in his body. At a time like this, if some kind of enemy arrived, then his circumstances would truly be terrible.Unfortunately, it was evident that whatever one feared would end up arriving. A black shadow flashed by, and Xu ZiYan immediately felt his cheek hurt. Using his finger to wipe the area, it came back covered in an extremely unsightly scarlet red.He vigilantly surveyed his surroundings in all directions. Just now, he hadn\u2019t even seen anything before he was attacked. If the enemy\u2019s target had been his neck, then he might have collapsed on the ground already.Flipping his hand over, he took out a dagger and leveled it in front of his chest to protect himself. Then, Xu ZiYan began slowly walking forward.Out of the corner of his eye, he suddenly glimpsed yet another black shadow. Thus, he began urgently striking out the dagger in his hand. After hearing a few sounds of clashing metal, the black shadow fell onto the ground.Xu ZiYan picked it up and looked at it with rapt attention. So, it turned out that the thing that had attacked him was unexpectedly a light green dart. This dart was only around an inch in length, and the material it was made out of was neither gold nor wood. If one tried bending it with their fingers, it was actually quite flexible. In fact, it felt like it was made out of bone.After casually throwing away the dart, Xu ZiYan suddenly realized that his fingers had touched something sticky. He rubbed his fingers as a smell that was slightly sour floated through the air.A light green dart with a slightly sour smell\u2026\u2026Suddenly, Xu ZiYan\u2019s complexion changed. He bounced off his feet, throwing his body forward in a fierce manner. Not long after he began speeding up, the densely-packed sounds of crying frogs began echoing from underneath the bushes.\u201cHow unlucky! Why is it the Bone Arrow Frogs?\u201d Xu ZiYan complained bitterly to himself. Bone Arrow Frogs were a type of demonic beast that could grow spurs similar to darts on its back\u2014\u2014that\u2019s right, they were exactly the things Xu ZiYan had just defended against with his dagger.These Bone Arrow Frogs were only at the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. With Xu ZiYan\u2019s strength, eliminating them would only take a few minutes of work. Unfortunately, these demonic beasts were the typical case of demonic beasts that lived in a herd. The two Bone Arrow Frogs that had sneak-attacked him were none other than the \u2018scouters\u2019 for this herd.Finding them signified that it wasn\u2019t going to be long before he would be surrounded by a herd of Bone Arrow Frogs.Even if they were only demonic beasts at the sixth layer of Qi Condensation Stage, it would be a huge inconvenience to Xu ZiYan once there were a hundred of them. Thus, he didn\u2019t have the time to care whether or not there were other demonic beasts in the underbrush. No, he had no other choice but to sprint to the stone statue as if his life depended on it.Fortunately, demonic beasts that liked living together in herds usually had strong exclusiveness. Since there was already a herd of Bone Arrow Frogs here, it could be assumed that the chances of encountering other demonic beasts had lowered significantly.\u201cCroak, croak, croak\u2026\u2026\u201dThe croaking sounds of frogs began floating over from both in front of and behind Xu ZiYan. When he heard the continuous waves of croaks, Xu ZiYan immediately felt his scalp going numb.It was fortunate that he discovered them relatively early, hence their encirclement hadn\u2019t yet formed yet. Otherwise, he had to kill them all before he could advance forward again.Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!The Bone Arrow Frogs that had caught up to him the earliest had already begun shooting the spurs on their backs. Xu ZiYan tried his best to dodge them, but he still got hit a few times.Those sharp spurs embedded themselves into his body and hurt terribly, but Xu ZiYan could only endure with his entire will as he continued to run forward.\u201cCroak croak! Croak croak!\u201d A Bone Arrow Frog with an exceptionally resonant voice jumped out of the underbrush in front of Xu ZiYan. Compared to the other Bone Arrow Frogs, its huge body was around the size of a soccer ball. The spurs on its back also gleamed with a cold light.\u201cDo you have to be this excessive?! Even the Frog King has appeared!\u201d Xu ZiYan was practically at his wits\u2019 end with his luck. The Bone Arrow Frog herd hunts almost all day long, but the Frog King only participates in one or two hunts out of ten. Xu ZiYan never would have expected to be unlucky enough to actually encounter the Frog King.A Bone Arrow Frog King had cultivation at the eighth layer of Qi Condensation Stage. He wasn\u2019t actually scared of it, but if he had to waste time dealing with the Frog King, it would be bad if the herd managed to catch up to them.\u201cLet\u2019s stake it all!\u201d Xu ZiYan grit his teeth and then milked out the remaining spiritual energy in his body. Rays of thunder began gathering at his fingertips before condensing into a deep violet ball of thunder. Flickering cracks and sparks echoed from the ball of thunder, making it appear to be extremely dangerous.The Frog King seemed to also sense how the ball of thunder was extraordinary, so it didn\u2019t intend to go head-to-head with it. Instead, it ordered some of the other Bone Arrow Frogs to pounce onto the ball of thunder. Then, it leapt to the side and hid itself.Taking this opportunity, Xu ZiYan followed behind the ball of thunder and began rushing out. Using the time the Frog King used to hide away, he managed to slip away.The purple ball of thunder smashed into three Bone Arrow Frogs. It created numerous black scorches on the ground, but those three Bone Arrow Frogs didn\u2019t suffer heavy injuries. They were only repelled a few steps back with some minor wounds before they began chasing after Xu ZiYan again.Appearance-wise, this ball of thunder seemed very ferocious. However, in reality, its destructive power\u2026\u2026The Frog King realized it had been duped. It immediately became enraged as it began croaking loudly. The Bone Arrow Frog herd surrounding him began responding in agreement before they headed toward Xu ZiYan one after another to encircle him.While running, Xu ZiYan smiled bitterly. His spiritual energy had long been exhausted back when he was using the spiritual energy shield. The ball of thunder he had just created was something that only looked nice on the outside. At best, it could only be used to scare people.He never expected the Frog King to have really been fooled. In fact, he was only able to run away because of that.With a herd of angry Bone Arrow Frogs chasing him, Xu ZiYan could only flee haphazardly. Fortunately, the Bone Arrow Frogs didn\u2019t have the best agility, or else his back wouldn\u2019t be pierced with only three spurs right now. Instead, he would have long turned into a pin cushion\u2026\u2026After running a few hundred zhang, the end of the prairie could already be distantly seen. That huge stone statue was precisely situated at the edge of the prairie. Xu ZiYan felt pretty ecstatic, and his already extremely tired body actually felt a bit invigorated. Somehow, he managed to force himself to run to the edge of the prairie before entering the open space near the stone statue.\u201cCroak, croak!\u201dThe angry herd of frogs had always been chasing him, and that Frog King was practically going to overtake him. However, the moment Xu ZiYan stepped into the range of the open space, the herd of frogs merely emitted a clamour of croaks before they stopped advancing forward.The Frog King bellowed twice in rage, but in the end, it didn\u2019t have the courage to enter the open space. It could only lead the herd of frogs away in anger.Like a puddle of mud, Xu ZiYan collapsed onto the ground, his loud gasping comparable to the sound of the bellows.After resting for a while and feeling as though he had recovered some of his strength, he crawled up to his feet from the ground before he began gradually approaching that stone statue.From far away, he already thought that this statue\u2019s loftiness had been out of the ordinary. Now that he had walked closer, he could better sense the imposing aura the stone statue emitted.Xu ZiYan walked very slowly. While he walked, he also adjusted the rate of his breathing. Right now, he had long exhausted his physical strength, and he didn\u2019t even have a trace of spiritual energy left in his body. Speaking of this, it was really strange. There wasn\u2019t even half a drop of spiritual energy within this spiritual array. Even trying to meditate to recover some of his spiritual energy did absolutely nothing.The more he approached the stone statue, the more he felt a type of hair-raising sensation. Xu ZiYan felt as if he was seeing picture after picture flash by his eyes, and these pictures seemed to be about a cultivator who carried a huge hatchet on his back and how he fought against bestial cultivators.Fighting against Sea Dragons, exterminating the Flame Birds, subduing the Dark Foxes, this cultivator\u2019s heaven-shaking spiritual energy wiped out countless high level bestial cultivators.Merely watching those pictures made Xu ZiYan feel as if his blood was racing in excitement. He itched to charge into the far west right this moment and wage war against those bestial cultivators.The reason for the war between humans and bestial cultivators had long changed from the original reason that had prompted the first war.It\u2019s just that, if one analyzed things from today\u2019s standpoint, human cultivators required bestial cultivators\u2019 inner cores to refine into medicinal pellets and spiritual artefacts. And at the same time, the flesh of humans was a huge supplement to bestial cultivators.Both sides regarded each other as their prey. Thus, their war could only continue.One of the pictures Xu ZiYan saw was that cultivator carrying a huge hatchet on his back and four other cultivators slaughtering several million bestial cultivators together. At the time, the scene had been incomparably cruel. The demonic beasts suffered huge damages, but the human cultivators also suffered huge casualties.In that fight, they fought against the bestial cultivators until the bestial cultivators retreated in defeat. Only then did they succeed in striving to buy some time for the Xuan Yu region.At the time, all of the righteous cultivation Sects and demonic Sects joined together to establish a defensive line at the far west under the lead of those five cultivators. At the defensive line, whether one was a righteous cultivator or a demonic arts cultivator didn\u2019t matter, for they couldn\u2019t fight against each other. In that place, their only enemies were the bestial cultivators and the demonic beasts. If someone dared to go against this rule, they would be hunted down and killed by both the righteous cultivators and the demonic arts cultivators.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis rule regarding the far west had been set up for several hundred years. Within these several hundred years, there were people who had attempted to just pay lip service and oppose in secret. Unfortunately for them, anyone who went against the rule was slaughtered by the experts from both the righteous cultivators and the demonic arts cultivators. Only the geniuses who had attained a certain level understood that it was only because of this rule\u2019s existence that all the human cultivators within the Xuan Yu region had united together and created a resistance against the bestial cultivators.The movie-like moving pictures disappeared the moment Xu ZiYan touched the stone statue.A deity consciousness, majestic yet filled with killing intent, erupted from the stone statue. Xu ZiYan only felt his heart cool before a terribly frightening and heavy sense (one unable to describe with the human language) pressed down on his mind. It felt as if the very next second, he would be struck down by the stone statue, soul scattered, and ashes annihilated.That deity consciousness with killing intent circled a few times within Xu ZiYan\u2019s body before disappearing.Xu ZiYan lightly stroked his stomach. The oppressive feeling from before was impossible to get rid of. Frightened, Xu ZiYan gasped with wide eyes. That kind of \u2018dancing at the edge of death\u2019 sensation had felt too real, so much that he actually thought he saw Buddha\u2026\u2026Although that deity consciousness had appeared quickly, it disappeared even quicker. It was like it had come out to take a quick stroll just to scan Xu ZiYan\u2019s body before disappearing.Wait\u2026\u2026 a scan?Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyelid twitched. Combined with those pictures of the cultivator with the hatchet slaughtering bestial cultivators, Xu ZiYan was pretty sure he knew the purpose behind that divine consciousness.\u201cMeditate. Concentrate.\u201d Somewhere from above his head, a dignified voice suddenly spoke up.Xu ZiYan immediately sat down and crossed his legs in a lotus position. He converged all of his energy, spiritual energy and soul, in preparation to help him resist the heavy pressure that would soon descend upon his body.After the past two tests, his physical strength and spiritual energy had been completely exhausted. The only thing Xu ZiYan could still use now was the power of his own divine consciousness.However, he still had not built his Foundation yet, so he was unable to release his divine consciousness outside his body. With no other alternatives, he could only move the battlefield into his own body.That pressure felt heavy and was continuous. The force of its attack wasn\u2019t too strong, but it felt extremely hard to resist. Xu ZiYan\u2019s divine consciousness was practically being forced to retreat step by step. At most, he barely had enough strength to slow down the pressure\u2019s advancing speed. Repelling it would be completely impossible.After that force entered his body, it began destroying his meridians. However, after they destroyed them, there was a gentle force that would immediately begin repairing them. The destroying and repairing alternated, so it didn\u2019t take long for the meridians in Xu ZiYan\u2019s body to be hammered and refined by the force until they were exceptionally sturdy and tough.There was no need to talk about the benefits of having sturdy and tough meridians. One had to know, what needed to happen in the Meridian Condensation Stage that was after the Foundation Establishment stage was that the meridians had to be refined so they could accommodate more spiritual energy.But\u2014\u2014F*ck it hurt so much ah!!!Xu ZiYan was in so much pain, he was practically going to cry.Don\u2019t mention the saying about how real men do not cry. The pain of whoever said that probably hadn\u2019t been sufficient enough to make them cry in the first place\u2026\u2026Normally, with Xu ZiRong always beside him, Xu ZiYan had to consider his \u2018big brother\u2019s honour\u2019. So, even if he was in pain, he would hold out with all his will. But right now, there weren\u2019t others with him. That meant that even if he was pained until he was rolling on the floor, nobody would see him.\u201cThe hell! It really f*cking hurts ah!\u201d Xu ZiYan restrained himself until his face was bright red. Both his eyes were moist, and the corners of his eyes had some somewhat suspicious looking liquid. He rigidly held onto the ground with both hands, and his nails had all cracked.While hurting as if he was hovering between life and death, Xu ZiYan still didn\u2019t forget to transfer his pitifully little divine consciousness to continue meeting the enemy head on. Although it did not have much of an impact, he wasn\u2019t reconciled with allowing that force to tear apart and restore his meridians without doing anything.Practically biting his lower lip until it was mushy, Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. If he had not persisted with the thought of how he didn\u2019t want to let the force do whatever it wanted, he might have fainted a long time ago.That force circled around once within Xu ZiYan\u2019s body. Of course, this meant that it had already destroyed all of the meridians within his body.The benefits Xu ZiYan had received from that was immense. However, by now, he had long lost all consciousness.But his behaviour had already attracted the attention of a Nascent Soul cultivator. And this cultivator was precisely the one currently behind the whole palace hall. He was Luo Yun DaoJun, the one controlling the entire array.\u201cHe he, interesting.\u201d Somewhere within the palace hall, a middle-aged man let out a light chuckle\u2026\u2026Xu ZiYan opened his eyes and saw\u2014\u2014 a ceiling filled with leaks and holes.By chance, the sunshine that peaked through the holes shone on his face. This was what had awakened him with a start.Using a great deal of effort, he wanted to raise his arm. However, Xu ZiYan realized in alarm that he practically could not feel the existence of his arm anymore. Immediately, he started cold sweating.\u201cBig brother, you woke up?\u201d With a creaking noise, the door opened. Holding a basin of clear water, Xu ZiRong walked into the room. When he saw Xu ZiYan open his eyes, he immediately called out in pleasant surprise.After expending a lot of effort, Xu ZiYan managed to turn his head to look at him. He also attempted to squeeze out a smile, but unfortunately he failed.Taking a chance, Xu ZiYan began surveying his surroundings. However, the moment he did so, he immediately felt his heart chill. They were currently living in a very shabby little thatched cottage. Within the whole hut, there was only a single wooden bed, a wooden table, and a wooden chair\u2014\u2014nothing else.It couldn\u2019t be that they were sent to a place like this because he had failed the last part of the test, right?He opened his mouth, but his mouth was incomparable dry. Fortunately, he had an extremely considerate little brother. Upon seeing his movement, Xu ZiRong immediately picked up a bowl of warm water he had long prepared and set to the side, before he carefully fed it to his big brother.\u201cBig brother, you don\u2019t have to worry. The Sect Leader already said that you achieved the best results. In addition, because the inheritance you received was the most complete, your body couldn\u2019t quite bear it. Thus, you must take baths with medicinal herbs to help your recovery. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t feel your limbs right now, but you\u2019ll be better in a few days.\u201d Seemingly aware of his worries, Xu ZiRong promptly began explaining everything to him.Xu ZiYan nodded his head, before taking another look at his surroundings. \u201cThen, this is\u2026\u2026\u201dXu ZiRong\u2019s expression turned a bit subtle, as if he wasn\u2019t that happy. \u201cAfter the exam, the Sect Leader originally wanted to personally accept you as a disciple. However, a deranged cultivator stopped him.\u201dWhen he started talking about that cultivator, Xu ZiRong looked as if he was gnashing his teeth in anger. It seemed like he was just itching to take two bites out of that cultivator.\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine if they stopped it. In any case, I didn\u2019t want to worship him as Master in the first place.\u201d Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t really feel much about this news. After all, he had been preparing to worship an obscure and nameless cultivator as his Master. He hadn\u2019t known that cultivator\u2019s name, but he knew the place where the cultivator liked to laze off and sleep.\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu ZiRong looked very angry. \u201cI can let it go if he was just stopping you from becoming the Sect Leader\u2019s disciple, but that guy thickened his skin and was resolute in taking you as his disciple. He didn\u2019t even wait for to wake up before finishing all the procedures. Right now, you\u2019re already his disciple.\u201dXu ZiYan fell silent. Inexplicably getting saddled with a new Master, this feeling\u2014\u2014 was really too unfathomable.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, big brother. I can\u2019t win against him, so I wasn\u2019t able to stop him.\u201d Xu ZiRong gloomily said. After losing his original strength, the current him was truly too puny and weak. He couldn\u2019t even defeat a cultivator with cultivation at the Meridan Condensation stage.Originally, Xu ZiYan was feeling a bit depressed. However, when he heard Xu ZiRong\u2019s words, he couldn\u2019t help but find it funny. After expending some effort, he managed to rub Xu ZiRong\u2019s head. \u201cYou\u2019re still young. In the future, when you\u2019re all grown up, big brother will rely on you for protection!\u201dXu ZiRong frowned before nodding his head. But in his heart, he was still brooding over that deranged cultivator. The attitude the Sect Leader displayed toward him was really too strange. And a mere Meridan Condensation stage cultivator actually dared to oppose the Sect Leader. This couldn\u2019t be explained even if that WuChen DaoJun1had a kind personality.Could it be possible\u2026\u2026Xu ZiRong curbed his contempt for that cultivator. It could be assumed that a person who would make the Sect Leader\u2019s attitude like this wouldn\u2019t be an ordinary person. Right now, he merely didn\u2019t know if the person that made the others a bit nervous was the deranged cultivator himself, or the person behind him.\u201cAh, my arm can move now,\u201d Xu ZiYan yelled in surprise.He hadn\u2019t noticed before, and only discovered when he had reached out to rub Xu ZiRong\u2019s head. Currently, he was surprisingly already able to move his hand.Although he did feel rather stiff, it was true he was recovering.Xu ZiRong couldn\u2019t help but smile. Sure enough, the medicinal bath from Liu Guang Sect was quite useful.However, the excuse the deranged cultivator used to forcibly kidnap Xu ZiYan was that he wouldn\u2019t give them the prescription for the medicinal bath if Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t become his disciple. When he remembered that, Xu ZiRong couldn\u2019t feel happy no matter what.After moving his arms around, Xu ZiYan attempted to move both of his legs. Unfortunately, like before, he couldn\u2019t feel his legs at all. It looked as if he still had to wait a couple of days before they would get better.Xu ZiRong moved a stool over and placed it by his bedside. Then, the two brothers began swapping the information they each gathered these days.Of course, as a person who had been in a coma, all Xu ZiYan had to do was listen. And what Xu ZiRong was responsible for was to tell him what had happened that day.In all honesty, it was quite coincidental. The results of Liu Guang Sect\u2019s exam this year were probably the best in the last few decades.There had been three people who had received a complete inheritance. These were Wei Qing, Xiahou Lian, and Xu ZiYan.Hu YuTian\u2019s performance was also pretty good. Unfortunately, he hadn\u2019t been able to persevere and fainted a few moments before he would have received a complete inheritance.Apart from them, there were a couple of other disciples that did pretty good as well. Although, there was nobody who had managed to remain conscious to the very end.The two brothers chatted happily, and time unwittingly passed this way, until\u2014\u2014With a loud clang, the door to the hut was kicked open by a foot wearing a cloth shoe that revealed the owner\u2019s toes. That wooden door creaked twice before falling onto the ground with a loud bang, finally dying at its ripe, old age.\u201cAiya, sorry! I was too lazy to use my hands to open the door, and didn\u2019t expect that I would use too much strength!\u201d A cultivator wearing worn and tattered clothes walked inside with an apple in his mouth.Shocked, Xu ZiYan watched this guy walk to his bedside in an arrogant manner. Because there weren\u2019t any more chairs, the cultivator decided to push Xu ZiYan over until Xu ZiYan was sitting squished on the inside of the bed. Then, the guy sat down on the edge of the bed.\u201cDo you want to eat?\u201d From who knows where, the guy took out another bright red apple before waving it in front of Xu ZiYan\u2019s face.Xu ZiYan swallowed some saliva as his heart thumped. He knew the identity of this person, but he hadn\u2019t expected the other to appear here wearing a costume like this.Wasn\u2019t this guy supposed to be sleeping while hiding in some nook or cranny? Why did he walk over here in such a bold manner?\u201cMaster?\u201d Xu ZiRong glanced at that cultivator\u2019s dirty outfit and couldn\u2019t help but frown.\u201cWait a second. ZiRong, what did you call him?\u201d Xu ZiYan was stupefied. Didn\u2019t this guy accept disciples only if it was destined? Before, he had been planning to use his right as the top candidate of the inner sect disciple\u2019s exam to get the guy to take him in as a disciple. How did ZiRong suddenly turn into his disciple?\u201cOf course it was \u2018master\u2019, what else could it be? In addition, brat, don\u2019t you know to call me when you see me?\u201d The sloppy cultivator used his foot to give Xu ZiYan a kick.Xu ZiYan felt a bit sluggish. What was he supposed to call him by?\u201cWhat else can you call me by? Call me \u2018Master\u2019! Did the other brat still not tell you that you\u2019re my disciple now?\u201d The sloppy cultivator said in a deliberately high pitched voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sloppy cultivator stared back at him with big eyes. As a result, the master and disciple duo proceeded to stare at each other like this, big eyes staring into small eyes. After a long time, Xu ZiYan retreated in defeat as he silently shifted his gaze.The sloppy cultivator sneered at him once, \u201cGood disciple. Now, I want to hear you call me Master a few times. After all, you\u2019re someone I took great pains to steal from my senior-apprentice brother, the Sect Leader.\u201d\u201cEsteemed Master, please forgive this disciple and his body\u2019s illness for being incapable of kowtowing in respect.\u201d However, unlike what the sloppy cultivator had expected, not only did Xu ZiYan not get angry when he heard his explanation, he used the arms he could move to greet him earnestly with a ceremonial salute.The sloppy cultivator was instantly stupefied. Even the apple he had been holding in his mouth fell down. It landed on the bed and rolled around in a few circles, becoming covered with dust.Seeing the sloppy cultivator\u2019s current stupid appearance, Xu ZiRong suddenly felt gleeful and invigorated. The pent-up frustration he had suffered these couple of days caused by the sloppy cultivator\u2019s oppression had finally dissipated as well. In fact, he suddenly felt unimaginably comfortable.\u201cDid you hear me wrong?\u201d The sloppy cultivator appeared a bit unreconciled for things to end just like this. \u201cI said, I stole you from the Sect Leader. He originally wanted to accept you as his disciple. If I hadn\u2019t butted in, you would be the Sect Leader\u2019s succeeding chief disciple.\u201d\u201cThis disciple heard your words very clearly. Many thanks for Master\u2019s concern and care.\u201d Xu ZiYan smiled faintly before saying, \u201cBeing able to worship you as my Master is already this disciple\u2019s blessing of three lifetimes.\u201dThe sloppy cultivator immediately had nothing more to say. Although Xu ZiYan apparently regarded him higher than the Sect Leader, making him feel quite badass, the way Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t get angry at all made him, someone who liked evilly messing with his disciples, feel no sense of accomplishment ah!Rubbing his nose, a few hints of contemplation tinged the sloppy cultivator\u2019s gaze as he stared at Xu ZiYan. \u201cHuh. Obedient little disciple, you aren\u2019t an idiot, are you? If you become the Sect Leader\u2019s disciple, there\u2019s a chance you could inherit the Sect Leader\u2019s position in the future.\u201dXu ZiYan smiled faintly. \u201cMaster is wise, but disciple is dim-witted by nature. Thus, I dare not undertake such an enormous responsibility.\u201dThe sloppy cultivator choked, once again at a loss of words. Then, he glared at Xu ZiYan, looking as if he was hating iron for not becoming steel. \u201cHow did I accept a disciple like you? One without any future prospects! You don\u2019t even have any ambition.\u201dXu ZiYan smiled so brightly, even his eyes turned into crescents. \u201cMaster\u2019s insight is like an illuminating torch. You can even tell that disciple doesn\u2019t have any ambition. Master is truly very wise and far-sighted.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright. Flattering me more would still be of no use.\u201d The sloppy cultivator shot Xu ZiYan an unfriendly glance. During that time in the array, this brat had obviously not been like this. How had his personality become so greasy the moment he woke up? Had he hit his head on something?Since he couldn\u2019t win against Xu ZiYan, the sloppy cultivator simply shifted his gaze back onto Xu ZiRong. \u201cWhat are you looking at? What time is it already? Have you watered the herbal plants in the vegetable garden yet? Have you tended to my spiritual grain yet? Let me tell you, if there\u2019s a drop in crop yield for my spiritual grain, the two of you definitely won\u2019t have a good outcome!\u201d When he got to the end of his speech, the sloppy cultivator deliberately assumed a fierce appearance. He even bared his teeth to scare Xu ZiRong.Xu ZiRong expressionlessly gave him a look before he turned around to go work. However, in his heart, he couldn\u2019t help but silently curse. Sure enough, the important elite were all liars. The only reason the Sect Leader had made a concession was because this guy was a scoundrel, right?!\u201cBah! This child isn\u2019t cute at all!\u201d The sloppy cultivator pouted. When a normal twelve year old kid suffered an injustice like this, shouldn\u2019t they charge at him while roaring with anger? This was especially the case for children that had a relatively good family background, like Xu ZiRong. He should have been pampered and spoiled to the extreme. In addition, his older brother was a cultivator that had such remarkable innate talent. The sloppy cultivator could only imagine the fantastic treatment these brothers would have received in the Xu family.What a pity\u2026\u2026The older brother was a crafty one, while the younger brother had a wooden face. It had practically scared him into dropping his chin. The lofty cultivator had travelled around the mortal realm who knew how many times already, but among ten thousand cases, a case like theirs truly hadn\u2019t appeared.Xu ZiYan knew that the man before him was a Nascent Soul DaoJun, and that he was the Master he had just wordshipped. So, rationally, he ought to try his best to curry favour with his new Master. However, the moment he heard him criticize his little brother, he couldn\u2019t help but retort.\u201cZiRong is very responsible, and normally he is very lovable. He treats people with courtesy, and he has a modest personality. Were it not for his worries over my injuries, he would not be so rude.\u201dThe sloppy cultivator gave Xu ZiYan a glance before he discreetly pouted again. In his heart, he silently thought, \u2018I\u2019m afraid that out of all these words you just said, other than the part about being worried about your injury, none of the other descriptions would fit your little brother.\u2019Although\u2026\u2026Who cared about this?!The sloppy cultivator thought indifferently. The one he had taken a liking to was Xu ZiYan. As for Xu ZiRong, that boy had followed them himself. After all, no matter what, he could still make out the child\u2019s real nature to some degree. But, even if Xu ZiRong\u2019s personality was quite detached and cold, what about it? With how much importance he had attached to Xu ZiYan, as long as his big brother doesn\u2019t betray the Liu Guang Sect, that brat would never disobey his brother.As for Xu ZiRong\u2019s relationship with his fellow Sect members\u2026\u2026 Who cared about those things? Within these thousands of years, had the Liu Guang Sect ever lacked arrogant people? In every Peak and every Hall, when would there not be someone with bad temper? Adding another Xu ZiRong wouldn\u2019t be too much, nor would there be too little even if Xu ZiRong had not come. And in regards to his other aspects, as long as he did not betray the Liu Guang Sect, the Sect never cared too much.Perhaps it was precisely because Liu Guang Sect had such a liberal and free atmosphere that among all the other righteous Sects, they became the only intermediary between the righteous and demonic factions, one that closely united both sides.Little disputes were settled privately, but in the cases where big weapons of war were involved, Liu Guang Sect would inevitably be called over as an arbitrator.\u201cMaster,\u201d Xu ZiYan became aware that the sloppy cultivator seemed to be a bit absent-minded and immediately called out. A moment ago, he already had many doubts. What was the matter behind Master\u2019s orders to Xu ZiRong, the ones about watering the herbal plants and looking after the spiritual grain?\u201cAh? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d The sloppy cultivator snapped out of his daze before giving Xu ZiYan a lazy look.Xu ZiYan explained the misgivings in his heart. The sloppy cultivator yawned before saying, \u201cOh, it ain\u2019t a big deal. I merely do not raise idle people here. You are my disciple, and you are seriously injured. Lying here and enjoying life is naturally not a problem. However, your little brother forced his way here, and I reluctantly accepted him as a disciple. Since that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s natural he has to do some chores.\u201d\u201cBesides\u2026\u2026\u201d The sloppy cultivator glanced at Xu ZiYan. \u201cThe medical herbs in your bath all came from the Sect. Don\u2019t think you can randomly use them. These are all part of the debt you now owe. During the times you can\u2019t move, of course your brother has to take your place and help pay us back. Nowadays, he needs to water the medicinal herb fields that are a few hundred mu1 large everyday. In addition, he needs to capture the insects on the spiritual grain fields that are thirty mu large. Tsk, tsk, for the past few days, he\u2019s been so tired, his little face even looks a bit haggard!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Xu ZiYan immediately became anxious. \u201cZiRong\u2019s only twelve years of age. How could you make him do such heavy work?!\u201dA hundred mu ah! That was such a large area! Xu ZiYan only had to imagine Xu ZiRong\u2019s tiny figure carrying two heavy buckets on his shoulders, wiping away sweat while watering the herbal plants for his heart to immediately feel pained.\u201cSo what if he\u2019s twelve?\u201d The sloppy cultivator dug into his ear. \u201cHe is a cultivator. Even if he is only twelve, he\u2019s still no longer an ordinary person. He\u2019s only watering the plants for a field that is a hundred mu large. At best, he\u2019ll only be a little bit tired, and he definitely wouldn\u2019t die from this.\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201d Xu ZiYan raised his voice. The sloppy cultivator\u2019s indifferent tone made him feel very indignant.The sloppy cultivator glared at him. \u201cWhat are you yelling for? Your Master ain\u2019t deaf yet!\u201dXu ZiYan immediately forced himself to calm down. \u201cMaster, please allow ZiRong to rest for a few days. For the rest of the work, let me take over.\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d The sloppy cultivator looked askance at him before the man used the tip of his foot to kick Xu ZiYan\u2019s legs, which still completely lacked any feeling. Expressionlessly, he asked, \u201cDo you intend to crawl over to water the plants?\u201dXu ZiYan was immediately at a loss for words. Anxiously staring at the sloppy cultivator, he hoped the man could at least reduce Xu ZiRong\u2019s amount of work.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. I know you brothers have a deep, brotherly relationship. At that time, when I wanted to take you away, your little brother almost gambled his life away with me. Really! He acts like I\u2019m some kind of monster who wants to eat you!\u201d The sloppy cultivator said resentfully.\u201cMaster, how about this? For the Sect merits I owe, I\u2019ll repay them by twofold in the future. In return, please stop making ZiRong work so hard.\u201d\u201cYou, ah. There\u2019s nothing wrong, yet you\u2019re blindly worrying.\u201d The sloppy cultivator helplessly rolled his eyes. \u201cYour little brother\u2019s capabilities are quite high, being a bit tired like that wouldn\u2019t kill him. Just consider it as him tempering himself. As for you, make sure to properly rest. In the past few decades, only this batch of inner sect disciples have such good talent. I somehow managed to snatch one back with much difficulty. If internal injuries remain because you didn\u2019t rest properly, and those injuries affect your future development, then wouldn\u2019t those old men ridicule me to death?\u201dSeeing how his pleas for leniency were useless, Xu ZiYan had no other choice but to shut up. However, it was hard to avoid cursing the man out in his heart. An area more than a hundred mu large, and his Master actually said it was something to temper Xu ZiRong! It was seriously too excessive! This was just child labour, ah!!When the sloppy cultivator saw how Xu ZiYan still looked sulky, he immediately understood that the teenager was still worried about his little brother. In his heart, the sloppy cultivator felt resentful over how this new disciple actually didn\u2019t trust his own Master. However, after thinking over it more, he realized that the two of them had just met. In addition, the boy was someone he had forcibly swindled to his side. Lacking trust in him seemed to be natural.\u201cI truly fear you,\u201d the sloppy cultivator muttered before laughing. Then, he pinched his fingers together to activate a spiritual art. Immediately, the water from the basin Xu ZiRong had carried over suddenly floated into the air. Hovering in front of Xu ZiYan, it turned into a water mirror.The ripples on the water mirror gradually smoothed over. Then, what appeared on its surface turned out to be Xu ZiRong\u2019s figure.Xu ZiRong was currently carrying two buckets of water. On the mountain path, he ran as fast as if he was flying. He made it seem like he wasn\u2019t expending any effort at all.\u201cLook carefully.\u201d The sloppy cultivator was afraid Xu ZiYan wouldn\u2019t be able to notice the important point. Thus, he reached out to point at the area beneath Xu ZiRong\u2019s footsteps.With rapt attention, Xu ZiYan took a good look. It turned out that every time Xu ZiRong set foot on the ground, there would always be a flash of green flitting by his feet.The green was actually a vine, one Xu ZiYan was very familiar with. That was Xu ZiRong\u2019s Wood Arts spiritual energy.Under the nourishment of Wood Arts spiritual energy, the little strands of grass Xu ZiRong stepped on generated an upward force. Xu ZiRong was actually borrowing this force to launch himself forward.Although it looked like he was sprinting, in reality, Xu ZiRong was just borrowing the strength of plants to move forward. With this strategy, the spiritual energy he wasted didn\u2019t amount to much. However, the effects of this plan were very good. In addition, he could even practice his control over the Wood Arts spiritual energy. It was practically hitting two birds with one stone.\u201cDo you see it? Your little brother is still quite energetic,\u201d the sloppy cultivator felt a sense of defeat. In the beginning, he felt that the brat wasn\u2019t pleasing to his eyes. Thus, he deliberately wanted to torment him a bit. Just think about it! He was a magnificent Nascent Soul cultivator. Usually, he didn\u2019t want to accept disciples even if the others sent him extremely talented ones! After much difficulty, he somehow managed to take a liking to Xu ZiYan. However, that brat seemed to think he wanted to harm his older brother!Don\u2019t think he didn\u2019t see the laughter in the Sect Leader\u2019s eyes. Although he had cut a sorry figure because he had been busy researching the array, and although he had deliberately forced down his cultivation realm, that brat shouldn\u2019t look down on him like this!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThus, the sloppy cultivator borrowed the fact that Xu ZiRong\u2019s older brother owed the Sect a lot of merits. He said that if it was not repaid, he would stop supplying them with medicine. This forced the brat to work for himself.Originally, he merely wanted to make the brat beg for his forgiveness. He hadn\u2019t expected the boy to actually be quite strong-willed. On the first day, the brat had been tired to death, but he still wouldn\u2019t beg. The very next day, the boy discovered a new method of accomplishing his task. Not only did the brat complete the work the sloppy cultivator had assigned him, he even did it so that it would help his cultivation.This boy\u2019s future accomplishments were bound to be out of the ordinary!Although he was not fond of Xu ZiRong, that didn\u2019t stop Luo Yun DaoJun from thinking highly of Xu ZiRong\u2019s future prospects. At the very least, he was amazed by Xu ZiRong\u2019s tenacious behaviour. The sloppy cultivator had only sensed such willpower from those who had experienced many trials in life. It was astonishing that Xu ZiRong, who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, would have this kind of unique characteristic.Information regarding the Xu family brothers had long been placed onto his desk. Naturally, the files included information about Xu ZiRong\u2019s identity.Although this boy was the Xu family head\u2019s illegitimate child, he had never suffered any grievances ever since he was young. Even after he had been taken back to the Xu family, he always had his older brother to take care of him. The sloppy cultivator could ponder until his head exploded, but he still wouldn\u2019t understand just how this child acquired this kind of personality.Ah, forget about it. Every person had their own destiny. Since the Xu family brothers were able to pass through and walk out of the fantasy array, it was enough to prove they bore no relationship with demonic cultivators. As long as they weren\u2019t demonic cultivators, nothing could pose a problem.As for their future growth, it was enough to slowly watch after them. After all, they still had a lot of time.Luo Yun DaoJun withdrew his Water Mirror Art before unhappily giving Xu ZiYan a glance. \u201cDo you feel reassured now?\u201dEmbarrassed, Xu ZiYan nodded his head. He thought, if Master\u2019s personality in the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories wasn\u2019t weird and temperamental, I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to worry whether or not you were bullying ZiRong because he annoyed you\u2026\u2026(Xu ZiRong, who really was being bullied: \u2026\u2026)Luo Yun DaoJun rubbed his chin. Who knew what he had suddenly remembered, because he suddenly lifted the corner of Xu ZiYan\u2019s quilt. The man reached out and began pressing on Xu ZiYan\u2019s legs.Xu ZiYan was scared stiff. When he realized his Master was just inspecting his legs, the boy released a sigh of relief.\u201cYou still can\u2019t feel anything?\u201d Luo Yun thought it was a bit weird. Since Xu ZiYan\u2019s hands had already recovered, there was no explanation as to why his legs were still not reacting. He had never heard of that array differentiating between the upper and lower parts of one\u2019s body when it refined one\u2019s meridians!Xu ZiYan shook his head. He could see Luo Yun DaoJun using both hands to pinch the lower parts of his legs, but he felt nothing at all.\u201cForget it, just soak in the medicinal bath for a few more days.\u201d Luo Yun DaoJun didn\u2019t have any solution to this either. There weren\u2019t many people who were capable of receiving a full inheritance in the first place, so it was possible that Xu ZiYan was just experiencing a situation others hadn\u2019t.\u201cMaster, I didn\u2019t become disabled, right?\u201d Xu ZiYan asked, quite apprehensive.Disgruntled, Luo Yun DaoJun rolled his eyes. \u201cRelax, even if you truly became disabled, I\u2019d still be able to cure you.\u201dFeeling embarrassed, Xu ZiYan smiled. He had forgotten that this was a cultivation world. Although regenerating a broken limb was a bit difficult, it wasn\u2019t impossible to do. In addition, his Master was a Nascent Soul cultivator. A trivial matter like this was still something he could accomplish.\u201cOh right, your Master\u2019s moniker is Luo Yun, although usually there aren\u2019t many people who call me that. The average person just calls me Big Foot Luo.\u201d After saying that, Luo Yun DaoJun showed off his two big feet with visible pride.The corner of Xu ZiYan\u2019s mouth twitched. Although he had long made some mental preparations for how this Luo Yun DaoJun\u2019s personality was wanton and unrestrained, for him to be\u2026\u2026unconventional to this degree was truly something rare to see\u2026\u2026\u201cAlright, I already know the situation with you two brothers, so there\u2019s no need for you guys to say anything. Since you two have worshipped me as your Master, you must abide by my customs. Before taking you two in, I already had three other disciples. Right now, none of them are present within the Sect. You guys can meet them after they return.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Master.\u201d Xu ZiYan immediately agreed. Those who were accepted by Luo Yun DaoJun had to be people with skill. Although both the novel and the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories made no mention of them, this was precisely what the saying \u2018one tiny clue reveals the general trend\u2019 meant. With Luo Yun DaoJun\u2019s insight, how could the disciples he took a fancy to be ordinary?Master and disciple chatted for a while longer. Luo Yun DaoJun was extremely pleased with this new disciple he had accepted. Xu ZiYan understood how to be tactful and discreet, and was humble toward this Master of his. Although he came attached with a child from a previous marriage1 who wasn\u2019t particularly charming, at the very least, that child was smart and wouldn\u2019t lower Luo Yun DaoJun\u2019s reputation.\u201cAh, it\u2019s almost time\u2026\u2026You should also go soak in the medicinal bath.\u201d Luo Yun DaoJun took a look at the colour of the sky before telling Xu ZiYan this.Distressed, Xu ZiYan took a look at his two legs that were currently similar to blocks of wood. That reminded him, how had he soaked in the medicinal bath before? His Master couldn\u2019t have been the one who carried him over, right?The moment he thought of how his Master had probably attended to him, Xu ZiYan\u2019s expression immediately turned into one of shame. However, before he had the chance to open his mouth and ask, a short figure suddenly emerged by the doorway.\u201cBig brother, it\u2019s time to soak in the bath!\u201dThe hell! Could it be, the one who had carried him to bathe these two days had been ZiRong?? Ahh, how did ZiRong and his tiny body manage to carry him, someone who\u2019s almost a meter and eighty in height??!!Xu ZiYan\u2019s gaze, one that previously had a hint of gratitude, suddenly changed flavour. When Xu ZiYan looked at Luo Yun DaoJun now, he already had on an expression of deep condemnation. Master, you really went overboard! You actually made an eleven-year old child do these hard labour types of jobs!!!When Luo Yun DaoJun received Xu ZiYan\u2019s sharp look, the corner of his mouth kept twitching. This foolish disciple of his, had he already forgotten the scene from the Water Mirror? All one had to do was stick some fur onto that little brother of his, and he would make the perfect monkey! With how deceitful and wily the younger boy was, Xu ZiYan was doomed to be completely eaten by him!\u201cBig brother?\u201d Sensing how Xu ZiYan kept glaring at Luo Yun DaoJun, Xu ZiRong questioned in confusion.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Xu ZiYan promptly turned his head around and said, \u201cZiRong, how will you be able to carry big brother? It\u2019s better to let\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, big brother. It\u2019s not troublesome at all.\u201d Smiling, Xu ZiRong interrupted him. He wouldn\u2019t let go of any opportunities to have intimate contact with his brother.Helpless, Xu ZiYan had no other choice but to allow his little brother to give him a piggyback ride. Before long, they arrived in the little kitchen next door to the humble dwelling.There was already a large barrel in the kitchen, one that had been filled up with water. Many kinds of spiritual medicines had been mixed together and placed in the bath, releasing an extremely bitter smell.Perhaps he couldn\u2019t feel anything when he had been unconscious, but soaking in a bath like this while he was awake was truly a trial!Xu ZiRong moved both swiftly and efficiently. He first activated a spiritual art that created an immense amount of vines. Then, he made the vines cover up every single hole or gap in the entire kitchen.Every inch of his big brother\u2019s skin was his, so how could he give others an opportunity to see it?After grabbing two stools, Xu ZiRong began very carefully taking off Xu ZiYan\u2019s clothes. Then, he placed his brother into the bath. However, before that, Xu ZiRong didn\u2019t even forget to test the temperature of the water in a considerate manner.Xu ZiYan was extremely touched by Xu ZiRong\u2019s meticulous care. Look, look! This was the good little brother he raised. Look at how clever and adorable he was!Which family could have a little brother who was so thoughtful?Everyone, go ahead and envy, admire, or hate him! \u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256dXu ZiRong didn\u2019t know that his considerate attitude had touched Xu ZiYan. He just stubbornly believed that his big brother completely belonged to him. Since that was the case, caring for his older brother was naturally a task that could not be handed to other people.His own belongings should be attended to by himself and he alone should protect them. In addition, he had to hide them away carefully, or else it would be easy for other people to snatch his things away. In his last life, this was the lesson he had experienced most deeply while he had still been in the Xu family.Although Xu ZiRong couldn\u2019t hide his big brother away, taking care of him and protecting him were still things Xu ZiRong had to personally accomplish himself.Xu ZiYan soaked in the bath for around two shichen2. During this time, Xu ZiRong obediently stood to the side to guard him. His gaze made it seem like he could never have his fill of watching him.After two shichen, Xu ZiRong changed the medicinal water in the bath to clean water and gave Xu ZiYan\u2019s body a thorough rinse. Only after that did he finally help Xu ZiYan put on his clothes and then carry him back next door.Luo Yun DaoJun had already left the room. However, beside Xu ZiYan\u2019s bed, he left behind two strips of jade.The contents of the jade strip basically said that after Xu ZiYan\u2019s legs also recover their sense of perception, he should go to the Sect Leader and check in. As the top candidate of this year\u2019s inner disciple exam, he still hadn\u2019t taken any of the rewards he had received.Other than the spiritual pellets, spiritual stones, and the permission to go to the Training Hall to pick a spiritual arts manual, treatment all the inner disciples received, his rewards as the top candidate included a chance to enter the Qilin Tower.However, entering the Qilin Tower was restricted to those above the Foundation stage, so Xu ZiYan\u2019s most important mission right now was to build his Foundation.Building one\u2019s Foundation required Foundation-building pellets, which could be obtained by exchanging Sect merits at the Meritorious Service Hall. However, for Xu ZiYan, someone whose current merit balance was at a negative, he naturally couldn\u2019t go down that path to obtain a Foundation-building pellet. Thus, he could only think up a different way.Other than those rewards, originally, the top candidate would have the ability to choose their own Master. Unfortunately for the unconscious Xu ZiYan, Luo Yun DaoJun ended up immediately kidnapping him. Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t even have a single chance to protest\u2026\u2026In a flash, three days passed. Sure enough, Xu ZiYan\u2019s legs recovered their perception. During these three days, Luo Yun DaoJun hadn\u2019t reappeared again, although he did pass on a message to them. He told them that after they checked in with the Sect Leader, they should immediately go find him.Xu ZiYan rubbed the lower parts of his legs. Right now, they were made out of compact muscles and were very strong, and even doing a few casual kicks could create wind. Unable to contain his joy, Xu ZiYan bounced around a bit. His legs were incomparably flexible, and he felt no residual effects at all.\u201cZiRong, let\u2019s go. It\u2019s the perfect day to go and retrieve all our rewards.\u201d Xu ZiYan said with a smile stretching from ear to ear.The feeling of regaining use of both his legs really felt too wonderful. In addition, when he got up early that morning, the harsh bitterness from before had completely disappeared as well. Right now, his legs felt as if they had never been wounded before. And with his body\u2019s current strength, it even felt as if they had gotten a bit stronger than before.The two brothers walked along the only small path, leaving the mountain to hurry toward Qian Yuan3 Peak. Only after actually walking over did they realize just how far away the Tian Luo4 Peak they lived on was from Liu Guang Sect\u2019s main Peak. In all honesty, if it were not for how Luo Yun DaoJun would occasionally strengthen his sense of existence in front of the Sect Leader and those other Elders, they would probably forget there was still another Peak here.It took them a full shichen!Only then did Xu ZiYan arrive at Qian Yuan Peak after walking from Tian Luo Peak. Unless there was an emergency within the Sect, it was forbidden to travel by flying on their swords. Only the disciples of the Peak Lords from the seven main Peaks were entitled to receive a red-crowned crane from the Spiritual Beast Garden to use as a transportation pet.Originally, if Xu ZiYan had worshipped the Sect Leader as his Master, he naturally would have also received that kind of treatment. However, Luo Yun DaoJun\u2019s Tian Luo Peak wasn\u2019t one of the seven main Peaks. Rather, everyone had practically forgotten Tian Luo Peak existed.After arriving at Qian Yuan Peak, Xu ZiRong announced his identity to the disciple guarding the entrance. The moment that disciple heard his name, his expression immediately turned into one of sympathy. It seemed like the news of a Meridian Condensation cultivator snatching Xu ZiYan from the Sect Leader had already spread thoroughly\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cPlease wait here for a moment, I will inform him of your arrival.\u201d The man wearing a yellow robe gently spoke.Xu ZiYan cupped his hands and saluted, before he just quietly stood there.Xu ZiRong kept his face blank and expressionless as he obediently followed behind Xu ZiYan. He tried his best to weaken his presence. That day, during the examination, he had met that black-robed man after crossing Li Chen Bridge. The man had caused an extremely strong sense of danger to rise within him. Xu ZiRong always felt as if the man had thoroughly seen through him, so he had no choice but to become more careful.Not long later, the man wearing a yellow robe had returned.While smiling, he handed over two jade strips, \u201cHurry on in, the Sect Master is waiting for you. You are each getting one of these jade strips to prevent you from being injured by the restrictions set in place.\u201dAfter thanking the yellow-robed man, Xu ZiYan took Xu ZiRong\u2019s hand and led him up the mountain.Within the mountain range, Qian Yuan Peak was Liu Guang Sect\u2019s tallest Peak. Clouds and mist would curl and linger even halfway up the mountain. Immortal qi was faintly discernible, and one could occasionally see red-crowned cranes and other spiritual birds roaming about.Blooming flowers lined both sides of the road leading to the mountain top, and among them were all sorts of low-leveled spiritual flowers and herbs, growing freely as they pleased. Between the gaps of the bamboo forest, one could also frequently see some spiritual beasts frolicking about. Some of the more courageous ones would even come forward of its own accord to ask passersby for food. Everything appeared like a beautiful scene taken straight from an immortal world.It was just\u2026\u2026Xu ZiYan blankly watched as some spiritual beasts, ones that originally wanted to come close to him, all run away in the blink of an eye. He felt incredibly puzzled.After all, he did not see how the Xu ZiRong following behind him would viciously glare at any spiritual beast who tried to get close\u2026\u2026The senses of spiritual beasts were far keener than that of humans, so they could easily sense Xu ZiRong\u2019s malice toward them.It was blatant killing intent. As long as one wasn\u2019t too stupid, no one would come near that murderous person.This human was too scary!!! QAQ!The two arrived at the main hall. After the guard at the doorway inspected their identities, they were led to the rear court, where the Sect Master lived.When they saw the Sect Master, the man had been teasing a gorgeously coloured spiritual sparrow. However, the sparrow appeared uneasy and was listlessly squatting upon a tree branch. It looked entirely fed up with WuChen DaoJun\u2019s harassing.\u201cEh? You guys are here?\u201d When he saw them arrive, WuChen DaoJun gave them a kind smile. \u201cSit, sit.\u201dCautiously, Xu ZiYan found a chair to sit on. The person in front of them was a full-fledged, Nascent Soul cultivator. In his last life, the original Xu ZiYan never had any contact with the Sect Master, so Xu ZiYan did not know the Sect Master\u2019s personality. Thus, in accordance to the motto of \u2018being careful decreases blunders\u2019, Xu ZiYan did not dare to be excessive with his words or actions.When he saw how nervous Xu ZiYan was, WuChen DaoJun couldn\u2019t help but find it funny. However, when he remembered that they were only children no more than fifteen or sixteen years old, WuChen DaoJun felt at ease. This was probably the first time they got so close to a Nascent Stage cultivator, so being nervous wasn\u2019t anything unexpected.\u201cThe reason I had you guys come today was just so I could meet you two.\u201d Wu Chen DaoJun smiled faintly as he spoke. \u201cI originally prepared a celebration for the end of this examination, but I did not expect that three disciples were able to accept a complete inheritance. Since you guys were unconscious, the celebration was naturally canceled. However, in consideration of your outstanding achievements, I wish to add one more Green Spiritual Seal to your original reward.\u201dAlthough Xu ZiYan did not know what a Green Spiritual Seal was, since it was a gift from the Sect Master, there was no doubt that it was something good. \u201cMany thanks to the Sect Master for your generosity.\u201dXu ZiYan did not know why the other would care so much about him, but since WuChen DaoJun was giving him something, he naturally wouldn\u2019t refuse it. In any case, Xu ZiYan could already be considered as one of Liu Guang Sect\u2019s people, so giving it to him would not be a waste. This was the so-called, \u2018keeping the goodies within one\u2019s family\u2019. \u256e(\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3\u201d)\u256dXu ZiYan did not understand the significance of the Green Spiritual Seal, but Xu ZiRong did. And it was precisely because he did understand, that he became so shocked by WuChen DaoJun\u2019s generosity.The Green Spiritual Seal was the Green Spirit Secret Realm\u2019s \u2018entrance key\u2019. Only the people who have harmonized with the Green Spiritual Seal would receive a chance to enter the secret realm.Furthermore, the Green Spiritual Seal could only be used once. If he and Xu ZiYan could not harmonize with the Green Spiritual Seal, then the Green Spiritual Seal they used will become trash.The Green Spirit Secret Realm opened once every ten years. If Xu ZiRong remembered correctly, the secret realm would be opening next year. Within all the famous secret realms of the Xuan Yu region, the Green Spirit Secret Realm was the most popular.This was because the Green Spirit Secret Realm had very little danger, but many treasures. In addition, there were countless ancient inheritances still hidden in the realm.Reportedly, the Green Spirit Secret Realm was the ruins of an ancient sect, and that same sect once controlled the entire Xuan Yu region many thousands of years ago. The sect gathered countless inheritable martial arts, and if their sect members were unable to raise their cultivation, they would also leave behind their own martial arts before their fall.After the accumulation of a millennium years, the precious inheritable martial arts gathered in the sect had already reached an astonishing degree. However, it was precisely because of this staggering wealth that the sect suffered an attack from outside their region.A super strong sect of a different region had opened a tunnel that led directly to the Xuan Yu region after expending a great deal of manpower and resources. As a result, the two sides started an intense battle in the tunnel.Regardless of whether they were cultivators or ordinary people, the casualties were disastrous. The super strong sect that started the battle also did not expect the other sect to be so tenacious. The two sects fought for several hundred years before the losses of the two sects reached their lowest limits.In the end, that super strong sect spent an enormous amount of treasures and invited another Mahayana stage cultivator to attack the other sect. When the other sect\u2019s Sect Head saw how the end of his sect was imminent, he actually hardened his heart and imploded his own primordial spirit talisman, ripping apart space itself. He threw the entire area where the sect had been located into a spacial disorder. After that, it morphed into the current Green Spirit Secret Realm.Because of the many years of war, that super strong sect\u2019s development had been hindered and they were quickly annexed by the other sects in the region. And because Xuan Yu region lost the sect that was home to countless precious inheritances, they also sank into an extreme decline.After many, many years later, the cultivators of Xuan Yu region were finally able to raise their spirits. Thus, they began to look for the martial arts circulated by that sect. At the same time, some genius cultivators would also create their own martial art techniques and pass it down. After many millenniums of training, Xuan Yu region finally recovered. However, unfortunately, there was already no way for them to return to the flourishing era with that one sect.Afterwards, cultivators did a lot of research before they managed to retrieve the truth from that piece of dark history. In fact, the appearance of the Green Spirit Secret Realm along with the inheritable martial arts inside all became evidence.No one knew how the Green Spiritual Seal was formed. However, only by harmonizing with it could one pinpoint the Green Spirit Secret Realm\u2019s location from the vast space and time flow.Many people believed that the Sect Head from all those years ago had wanted to leave behind a seed of hope for the Xuan Yu region, and thus, the Green Spiritual Seal was made. It could not be denied that it was precisely because of the Green Spiritual Seal\u2019s existence, that the cultivation world in the Xuan Yu region could now be so prosperous.There was not a lot of Green Spiritual Seals, and the places they appeared in every year always changed. However, all the major sects had an object related to the Green Spiritual Seal. Whenever one appeared, the object would react. Then, the Sect would attempt to retrieve the Green Spiritual Seal as quickly as possible.But there was a limit to how many Green Spiritual Seals there would be. Even for a large sect like Liu Guang Sect, having ten was already enough to amaze Xu ZiRong. He hadn\u2019t expected that WuChen DaoJun would actually take out three at once\u2014or maybe even more. This wasn\u2019t the resolution normal people had.Seeing Xu Ziyan\u2019s unperturbed appearance, WuChen DaoJun did not bother exposing the truth. On the contrary, had Xu ZiYan known the significance of the Green Spiritual Seal, then WuChen DaoJun would have been surprised. Thus, Xu ZiYan\u2019s current reaction was very normal.To be able to obtain junior-apprentice brother LuoYun\u2019s favor, he figured that this Xu ZiYan indeed had to be special.After looking at Xu ZiYan, WuChen switched his focus onto Xu ZiRong.They were both children of the Xu family and were brothers related by blood, but Xu ZiRong\u2019s personality was truly too different compared to that of his elder brother.When he recalled what Qing Yi had told him, WuChen couldn\u2019t help but frown. This Xu ZiRong\u2019s murderous nature was so strong, they did not know if he might hinder Liu Guang Sect in the future.However, if they cut him off from the path to immortality because of his murderous nature, then that made it even more likely for him to walk down another path. WuChen felt that dealing with Xu ZiRong was rather troublesome, but after thinking it over again, he couldn\u2019t help but smile.Although junior-apprentice brother Luo Yun\u2019s personality was wanton and unrestrained, he was never muddle-headed when it came to important matters. Since he had already accepted Xu ZiRong as his disciple, then there likely wouldn\u2019t be any problems.Since it was something that even Qing Yi could make out, there was no reason as to why junior-apprentice brother LuoYun wouldn\u2019t know. WuChen felt he was really too much of a worrywart.But although he did not discriminate against Xu ZiRong, in the end, WuChen did not like him either. Thus, after giving him a few, short sentences of encouragement, he sent the two of them back.After Xu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong left Qian Yuan Peak, they once again rushed back to Tian Luo Peak. Although toward cultivators, the distance they travelled couldn\u2019t be considered much, using their own two legs to make a round trip was still very tiring.Xu ZiYan inwardly repeated to himself, he had to quickly build his Foundation and learn how to fly on a sword. Otherwise, if they had to rely on running every day, they wouldn\u2019t get anywhere. Liu Guang Sect was really too big, it was simply comparable to a small-scaled city.LuoYun DaoJun did not live half way up the mountain with them. Rather, he lived in a cave located on the rear mountain of Tian Luo Peak.The landscape there was charming and the scenery picturesque, and there was a brook with clear water that flowed down the mountain gaps. And most importantly of all\u2026..many wild hares, pheasants, wild ducks lived there, making it convenient for LuoYun DaoJun to have a large and sumptuous meal at any time. For example, he could make something like barbeque, and so on\u2026\u2026The first time he saw LuoYun DaoJun act like this, it made Xu ZiRong so shocked that he forgot his manners for a while and didn\u2019t even remember to close his gaping mouth. Although he indeed did not know that other was a Nascent Soul cultivator, he could guess that LuoYun DaoJun\u2019s identity was out of the ordinary.Doing something like making barbecue in Liu Guang Sect wasn\u2019t something an average person could do. Although of course, an average person would not be shameless enough to do it\u2026\u2026As such, if one looked at it from a certain degree, the thickness of LuoYun DaoJun\u2019s face was already out of the ordinary\u2026\u2026\u201cMaster, we have arrived.\u201d Xu ZiYan gave LuoYun DaoJun a salute.\u201cShh! Don\u2019t talk, the fish is about to take the bait.\u201d LuoYun DaoJun shushed him in a hushed voice, still looking as sloppy as ever. Although he could easily use a cleaning dirt spiritual technique to solve the problem, he just had to wear that dirty set of clothes.Xu ZiYan silently retreated a few steps, before he hid in a corner and started whispering with Xu ZiRong. He wasn\u2019t afraid of being heard by LuoYun DaoJun. In any case, the two brothers were only discussing their cultivation problems at this time.The two of them discussed for a moment and both harvested some insight. Xu ZiYan had only received the original Xu ZiYan\u2019s memories, but that didn\u2019t mean he had mastered everything. However, with Xu ZiRong\u2019s flawless guidance, he quickly comprehended and got the knack of things.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Master, why do you insist on playing around with practical skills when a single spiritual martial technique could solve the problem? And in the end, your skills weren\u2019t even good enough! So tell me, what should I, your disciple, do about this?\u201cZiYan!!\u201d Big Foot Luo\u2019s expression was very ugly!\u201cYour disciple is present.\u201d Xu ZiYan immediately responded.\u201cHave you heard of this saying before?\u201d Big Foot Luo\u2019s eyes rolled about before he asked a question.Very cooperatively, Xu ZiYan made a confused expression.\u201cWhen the Master is in trouble, the disciple shall toil!\u201d After saying that, Big Foot Luo slapped Xu ZiYan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe grilled fish your Master will have for lunch, I leave it to you!\u201dWith his part said, he slapped his butt to rid it of dust before he found a large tree and laid down in the shade. Then, Big Foot Luo comfortably crossed one leg over the other.Xu ZiYan: =\u53e3=Master, you are being too irresponsible! This disciple doesn\u2019t know how to fish, ah!!!!!He stared at the fishing rod on the ground in a complicated mood. Xu ZiYan felt deeply depressed. Since young, he had always been impatient and easily irritated. Xu ZiYan truly did not do well with work that required patience!!!Actually, if it was work, he could just grit his teeth and get it over with. But fishing\u2026\u2026 to sit there for half an hour just for a single fish\u2026\u2026In that time frame, Xu ZiYan could have already run to and from the market several times. What fish couldn\u2019t be bought at the market?!After feeling depressed for a while, Xu ZiYan bent down to pick up the fishing rod. Master\u2019s order naturally had to be completed. However, when he turned around, he saw Xu ZiRong holding a sharpened wooden stick, and at the end of the stick was two speared fish.\u201cBig brother, is this enough?\u201dXu ZiYan: =\u53e3=Oh my god, when did my younger brother unlock the fishing skill? Why did I have absolutely no clue about this???Xu ZiYan\u2019s amazed expression successfully pleased Xu ZiRong, and the corners of the younger boy\u2019s lips faintly quirked up. Thinking back to the days when he lived at the Xu family and never had enough to eat or wear, he had tried almost all the wild fruits the forest had to offer. If his luck was good, he could even catch a fish to eat. At that time, he considered it something very delicious.\u201cHaha, ZiRong is quite amazing. You can actually catch fish.\u201d Xu ZiYan praised in a loud voice. He wasn\u2019t giving him empty praises either. Just now, Xu ZiRong hadn\u2019t used any spiritual energy. In other words, he relied purely on his own skills to catch those fish.Xu ZiYan rolled up his sleeves for battle and took the stick speared with fish. \u201cSince ZiRong has already shown his skill, it would be inexcusable if big brother didn\u2019t show any skill.\u201dAfter he spoke, he swiftly started up a fire and erected a frame. After cleaning the two fish, he used two branches to string them together and then set them on the frame to grill.His Heaven and Earth pouch never lacked seasoning, and he had even gathered some goods exclusive to the cultivation realm.After the fish grilled for five minutes, he plucked off a small piece to taste it. Then, Xu ZiYan took out three red and green bottles from his Heaven and Earth pouch and sprinkled the seasoning onto the grilled fish.Not much time had passed before the grilled fish began emitting a tantalizing scent.Far away under the tree, Big Foot Luo sniffed deeply. Then, his crossed legs began swinging even more happily\u2026\u2026\u201cAlright, it\u2019s done. Here, try it.\u201d With a smile, Xu ZiYan took the grilled fish off the frame. He carefully peeled off the burnt layer of fish skin to reveal the creamy and white fish meat inside.He handed the grilled fish over to Xu ZiRong as if he was presenting a treasure. The words \u2018Hurry up and taste it!\u2019 were written plainly on his face.Xu ZiRong took the grilled fish with pure bliss. He did not have much desire for good food, but there was no way he would refuse Xu ZiYan\u2019s handicraft.\u201cHmph!\u201dThe harmonious and affectionate scene was instantly shattered by a cold snort. The Xu family brothers both turned their gazes over to the tree not too far away.\u201cYou evil disciples!\u201d Big Foot Luo angrily scolded. The fragrance of the grilled fish had long awakened his craving. However, he didn\u2019t expect that after waiting forever for it, that damn brat had actually given the finished fish to his younger brother first! Such an unfilial disciple!But against all reason, when Xu ZiYan heard his master\u2019s cold snort, not only did he not offer the grilled fish to Big Foot Luo, he immediately made a face that said, \u2018Master, don\u2019t make trouble\u2019. It was infuriating.Xu ZiRong glanced at Big Foot Luo before he leisurely opened his mouth. His spotless white teeth bit down on the sparkling, translucent fish meat. The way the meat melted the moment it entered his mouth made him moan with satisfaction.Big Foot Luo: \u2026\u2026These two evil disciples!!!Sensing that Xu ZiRong was deliberately flaunting in front of their Master, Xu ZiYan didn\u2019t know whether he should laugh or cry. In any case, Big Foot Luo was their Master. ZiRong was being too disrespectful.He lightly smacked the back of Xu ZiRong\u2019s head, \u201cDon\u2019t cause trouble.\u201d Then, Xu ZiYan picked up the other speared fish and delivered it to Big Foot Luo.\u201cMaster, please enjoy.\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201d In a cold and noble manner, Big Foot Luo turned away. It was quite unfortunate\u2014 If this movement was done by a beauty, it would be pleasing to the eyes. However, when done by a sloppy cultivator, it was simply\u2026\u2026 a tragic sight.Fortunately, Xu ZiYan did not need to observe this behaviour for a long time. Very quickly, Big Foot Luo was attracted by the fragrance of the grilled fish.He \u2018reluctantly\u2019 accepted the stick with the grilled fish that Xu ZiYan offered him. Two, three bites later, the only thing left of the grilled fish was a bunch of bones.Xu ZiYan watched Big Foot Luo in a dumbstruck fashion. That wasn\u2019t a small fish by any means. At the very least, it weighed five to six pounds. And since Xu ZiYan had just taken it off the fire, it was still very hot. He did not expect his Master to finish it in just a few bites\u2026.. Speaking of which, this was probably a high-level skill too, right?Being stared at by Xu ZiYan\u2019s \u2018Me and my little comrades were all stunned by you\u2019 gaze caused Big Foot Luo\u2019s face to heat up. LuoYun DaoJun coughed twice. As a result, he accidentally coughed up yet another fish bone.Seeing this, the corner of Xu ZiYan\u2019s eye began twitching. He silently lowered his gaze and deeply thought. Back then, when he wanted to worship LuoYun DaoJun as his Master, he must have been possessed by something\u2026\u2026\u201cCough cough, good disciple.\u201d Big Foot Luo made a satisfied belch before he patted Xu ZiYan\u2019s shoulder.The corner of Xu ZiYan\u2019s mouth twitched. Just now, he had called them evil disciples. But the moment Big Foot Luo ate his fill, they turned into good disciples.\u201cYour skill in grilling fish is really good. Where did you learn to do it?\u201d With a face full of satisfaction, Big Foot Luo patted his belly.\u201cMy family\u2019s cook in pretty skilled. I am also quite interested in cooking, so during my breaks from cultivating, I would practice by myself.\u201d\u201cNn, not bad, not bad. Good disciple, all of Master\u2019s future meals will be entrusted to you as of now. You must diligently make them. Any ingredients you need, you can tell me to obtain. As long as it\u2019s not dragon liver or a phoenix\u2019s gall bladder\u2026\u2026\u201d When he said that, Big foot Luo paused before he continued. \u201cActually, It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t get them, it\u2019s just that killing dragons and slaughtering phoenixes are rather troublesome tasks. However, your Master will be able to get any other types of ingredients.\u201dIn the blink of an eye, Xu ZiYan immediately raised a condition, \u201cTo cook food for Master is this disciple\u2019s privilege. However, cooking also requires time. If it delays my cultivation pace, this disciple certainly would not have the courage to face Master\u2019s instruction.\u201dBig Foot Luo sneered. \u201cAlright, alright. You think I don\u2019t know what you want? Here, take it.\u201d After speaking, he casually threw over a white porcelain bottle. When Xu ZiYan took it and opened the lid, the sweet scent of the Nourishing Yuan Pellet immediately floated out.\u201cMany thanks, Master!\u201d Xu ZiYan was immediately overjoyed at the unexpectedly good item. The Nourishing Yuan Pellet was the medicinal pill with the best results during the Foundation stage. The best time to use it would be after he built his foundation.\u201cThen\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu ZiYan\u2019s eyes lit up. He glanced at Xu ZiRong, before he anxiously looked back at Big Foot Luo.Big Foot Luo coldly snorted, \u201cHmph, evil disciple!\u201d After speaking, he dusted off the dirt from his butt and left.Xu ZiYan was somewhat stunned. He still wanted to get some Qi Condensation pills for ZiRong, but their Master had unexpectedly left without another word.\u201cBig brother, it doesn\u2019t matter. I will be fine even without it.\u201d Xu ZiRong could not bear to see his big brother look so disappointed, so he quickly comforted him.In fact, he wasn\u2019t speaking empty words. After all, for him, the most nourishing thing wasn\u2019t medicinal pills, but the blood of cultivators or demonic beasts. While medicinal pills were admittedly good if he had any, it wouldn\u2019t hurt even if he didn\u2019t have them.When Xu ZiYan saw how his treasured little brother was empty handed yet still came over to comfort him, he immediately felt that his Master was way too stingy.Look, look! My little brother is only eleven years-old and he is already so sensible! Master, you are several thousands of years old and you\u2019re actually fighting with a child over food. You truly can\u2019t be more embarrassing than this!After feeling depressed for a moment, Xu ZiYan got over it. But after he got over it, he suddenly realized\u2014 Master hadn\u2019t said why he had called him over before he left\u2026\u2026\u201cAHHHHHHHHHH! Just what the hell are you doing, Master!!!??\u201d Xu ZiYan couldn\u2019t help but face the sky and sigh.\u201cIsn\u2019t it because of you?!\u201dHe didn\u2019t expect Big Foot Luo to jump down from a tree before the sound of his cries even faded away.Xu ZiYan was scared out of his wits. After he stuck out his tongue in his mind, he assumed a very proper and serious expression, \u201cMaster, you\u2019ve returned.\u201dBig Foot Luo glanced at him before he spoke with a bland smile. \u201cThat\u2019s right. If I didn\u2019t return, I wouldn\u2019t have known you would silently cursed me like this.\u201d\u201cMaster, what a funny joke.\u201d Xu ZiYan summoned his courage and said.Big Foot Luo did not continue the subject. Instead, he beckoned the two of them over before he carefully questioned their previous cultivation methods.Whenever Liu Guang Sect accepted disciples, they would always give new disciples a martial arts technique. The outer disciples were all taught the \u2018Five Phases of Conversion1\u2019. This cultivation method was fair, honest and gentle. It was not challenging to cultivate, so naturally the results of that martial arts technique were pretty average.And as for the inner-sect disciples, because they were apprenticed to a Master the moment they entered the Sect, they were able to receive their Master\u2019s guidance. Thus, they could go to the Hidden Scripture Pavilion to choose a cultivation method that was more suitable for themselves.Although Luo Yun Daojun was usually very unreliable, he was still a responsible Master. He attached much importance to choosing a martial arts technique. Aside from his detailed questions about the things they had learned before, he also strived to obtain their consent to probe their dantian.Of course, Xu ZiRong was determined to disagree. However, it was to no avail, for Xu ZiYan picked this time to adequately display the authority of a big brother. He only made a symbolic wave of his hand, and Xu ZiRong yielded.He did not want to be spanked in front of Big Foot Luo\u2026.. He was fully convinced that his big brother would be capable of doing such a thing.Xu ZiRong sulkily allowed Big Foot Luo to check his dantian. He was not worried that the other would notice anything, but the dantian was a cultivator\u2019s lifeline. So unless one had someone\u2019s absolute trust, there was no way they would easily allow another person\u2019s spiritual power to enter their dantian.Of course, this only pertained to a situation where both counterparts were of similar strength. With Xu ZiRong\u2019s current, measly power, even if Big Foot Luo did not cause mischief in his dantian, the elder could still easily kill him. As such, Big Foot Luo\u2019s behaviour when examining their dantian appeared rather honorable.Big Foot Luo refrained from smiling as he happily looked at the wooden-faced Xu ZiRong.He did not know why Xu ZiRong caved right after Xu ZiYan waved his hand. However, he realized that it was very pleasant to be capable of making this always stiff-faced and ice-cold child sullen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nothing in particular was wrong. Rather, it took so long because he had deliberately followed every meridian circuit within Xu ZiRong\u2019s body.Weren\u2019t you reluctant to let me check your dantian? Not only did I check your dantian, I also checked your entire body. What about it? Come bite me if you dare!After recalling his spiritual energy in an immensely pleased manner, Big Foot Luo began carefully pondering over what kind of cultivation method would fit the two brothers.Xu ZiRong\u2019s face looked gloomy as he stared at Xu ZiYan with a note of blame in his gaze.After being stared at by his bitter gaze, goosebumps formed on Xu ZiYan\u2019s skin. In the end, he helplessly whispered in Xu ZiRong\u2019s ear, \u201cI\u2019ll make you wonton noodles tonight.\u201dAt last, Xu ZiRong\u2019s gloomy face finally cleared as he gave Xu ZiYan a faint smile.\u201cWhat? What wonton noodle? I want some too!\u201d Big Foot Luo immediately shouted.Xu ZiRong\u2019s face immediately darkened. With a gloomy gaze, he stared at Big Foot Luo. Xu ZiYan helplessly looked at him: Master, don\u2019t cause trouble!\u201cYou two unfilial disciples! You don\u2019t even make a portion for your Master when you sneak a bite at night!\u201d Big Foot Luo began to noisily reproach them.Xu Ziyan was practically about to kneel. If he compared Big Foot Luo and Xu ZiRong, his Master was the actual child, right? He was harder to coax than a brat!\u201cBig brother\u2026\u2026You told me before that you would only make wonton noodles for me.\u201d Xu ZiRong also began quietly clamouring. He lightly tugged onto Xu ZiYan\u2019s sleeve and spoke in a pitiful tone. Then, he bit his lower lip and continued, \u201cIf\u2026\u2026 Master must eat it\u2026\u2026 I\u2026\u2026 I\u2026\u2026\u201dThe moment Xu ZiYan saw his younger brother\u2019s wronged appearance, his heart almost shattered.He looked at Big Foot Luo with annoyance. My little brother already looks so pitiful. Do you still have the nerve to fight over food with a child?Standing behind him, Xu ZiRong gently raised his head and revealed a sly provocative smile to Big Foot Luo.Big Foot Luo looked at the two brothers. Although one stood in front of the other, each of them revealed an entirely different expression. He immediately felt as if there was a mouthful of old blood stuck in his chest.Hating iron for not becoming steel, Big Foot Luo glanced at Xu ZiYan with exasperation. Although he always found pleasure when teasing his disciples in a battle of wits, Xu ZiYan was usually pretty clever. Why was it that the moment something involved his younger brother, he became so stupid??He had already hinted at Xu ZiYan many times before. Your younger brother is so sly. How can someone like him be wronged by only a bowl of noodles??When Big Foot Luo saw how Xu ZiYan did not sense that his \u2018cute and clever\u2019 younger brother was hiding behind him and sending a provoking smile, Big Foot Luo really wished he could walk up to Xu ZiYan and smack some sense into him.He fiercely harped in his mind: Look, look! As expected, he\u2019s truly a little wolf cub. Not only is his heart dark and means ruthless, Xu ZiRong is also especially good at acting! Did he decide to stop pretending in front of me because I have already seen through his disguise? Foul brat, sooner or later, there will be a day when I will teach you a lesson!The enraged Big Foot Luo swung his sleeves and walked away. Before leaving, he even angrily shouted, \u201cEat, eat! Go eat to death, you small white-eyed wolf!\u201dXu Ziyan immediately felt unhappy. My younger brother is so cute and obedient, just which part of him is a white-eyed wolf!!!??? Master, you went too far!After mentally complaining, he couldn\u2019t help but turn around to take a look at Xu ZiRong. However, he only saw the other boy give him a bashful smile. Xu ZiYan immediately felt that his Master was blabbering complete nonsense!Although Big Foot Luo ran off after being too enraged by Xu ZiYan\u2019s stupidity, he did not forget to leave a message before leaving. He recommended them two cultivation manuals.One was called \u201cHidden Thunder\u201d while the other was called \u201cSpiritual Wood\u201d. These two cultivation manuals were complete polar opposites. The former had astonishing destructive power, while the latter was a cultivation method devoted nearly entirely to tempering one\u2019s nature. Spiritual Wood had almost no potential for attacking.When the two cultivation manuals were introduced to Xu ZiYan at the Hidden Scripture Pavillion, he was shocked beyond words. His Hidden Thunder cultivation method was very strong. Although cultivating it would be an arduous task, it was perfectly suited to develop the constitution of his Lightning Heavenly Spiritual Vein. However, the Spiritual Wood cultivation manual left him very puzzled.From his point of his view, at most, Xu ZiRong simply didn\u2019t like to be too intimate with other people. It wasn\u2019t necessary to temper his nature, right? Generally speaking, wasn\u2019t this prepared for great devils to prevent them from encountering qi deviations?Although Xu ZiYan was puzzled, Xu ZiRong understood very clearly that the murderous spiritual energy in his body had been noticed by his Master.And it was precisely because of this that Xu ZiRong became even more suspicious of Big Foot Luo\u2019s identity. He had enough confidence in himself to believe that the average Meridian Condensation stage cultivator wouldn\u2019t be able to see the bloody, murderous spiritual energy in his body. That Lei Hu had been an exception, because he had been born on the battlefield in the far west. In other words, he had been baptized in bloody, murderous spiritual energy since he was born, so he was naturally incomparably sensitive to it. And as for that blue-robed man at the end of Li Chen Bridge, he had noticed Xu ZiRong\u2019s abnormality because he was too strong.Although Big Foot Luo had a sloppy and unreliable appearance, Xu ZiRong suddenly felt an unexplainable sense of fear. He had a feeling that this person had hidden depths. At the very least, Big Foot Luo wasn\u2019t as simple as how he outwardly seemed.So despite how much he disliked Big Foot Luo for taking too much of his big brother\u2019s attention, Xu ZiRong decided to let him be for now because of that \u2018Spiritual Root\u2019 manual. In any case, the title of their \u2018Master\u2019 hung over Big Foot Luo\u2019s head, and his big brother seemed to respect him very much. Xu ZiRong could reluctantly endure this man\u2019s existence for the time being.After choosing their cultivation manuals, the two of them left for the Miscellaneous Affairs Hall. There, they received their identity jade strips and sect disciple clothing. At the same time, they also obtained their portion of disciple-assigned items for the month.The guard for the Miscellaneous Affairs Hall was an outer-sect disciple. When he saw Xu ZiYan and Xu ZiRong\u2019s identity jade strips, a bright smile immediately lit his face.In regards to the inner-sect disciples, the outer-sect disciples mostly felt a combination of both reverence and jealousy toward them. Some were hostile, while others were flattering. It was very obvious that the one on duty today was the latter.\u201cThese two senior-apprentice brothers are young but show great promise. Entering the inner-sect of my Liu Guang Sect is truly worthy of celebration.\u201d The thin male disciple cupped his hands to greet Xu ZiYan.Xu Ziyan also returned a salute. With a smile, he said, \u201cMany thanks. Junior-apprentice brother, we brothers are still newcomers. In the future, please look after us.\u201dWhen the thin man saw how Xu ZiYan was being so polite, he quickly said that he did not dare. The status of outer-sect disciples and inner-sect disciples were naturally as different as can be. If he could leech off this new senior-apprentice brother, then his position in the outer-sect would rise straight up.The thin man planned to curry favor with the Xu brothers. He told them pretty much anything they asked without holding back. After all, even if he didn\u2019t tell them these minor things, Xu ZiYan was more than capable of asking other people. At most, the only thing he would waste was time. How could the thin man give up such a good opportunity?After calling over a junior disciple to replace himself, the thin man took the initiative to passionately lead Xu ZiYan around the Miscellaneous Affairs Hall.Because the Miscellaneous Affairs Hall was where disciples obtained their monthly share of resources and received their jobs, it was located in the center of Liu Guang Sect. Scattered around it were the Training Hall, Rewards Hall, Medical Garden, Spiritual Beast Garden, and several other facilities.It could be said that this area was the most flourishing region of the entire Liu Guang Sect.When Xu ZiYan first came here, he naturally wanted to obtain as much information as possible. Since elder disciple Lin Qing was around, he could save a lot of energy.There were numerous people in a large sect like Liu Guang Sect. In their own halls and peaks, there would naturally be some battles out in the open and hidden in the dark. Even if the atmosphere of Liu Guang Sect\u2019s internal competition was well maintained, it was no match for the sheer amount of people in a sect and their various circumstances.Like the saying birds of a feather flock together, situations like these were simply unavoidable. Take the allocation of resources as an example. Everyone wished to obtain a bigger share, because more resources meant their disciples would be able to cultivate faster.Quick cultivation = powerful strength = strive for even more resources.This was a never-ending circle. Even if everyone was doing it for the future growth of Liu Guang Sect, there was no way they could evenly allocate all the resources.Xu ZiYan had more or less made his inquiries about the Liu Guang Sect\u2019s current factions through Lin Qing. It was just as he expected. Although the Liu Guang Sect did not have many factions within it, most of the Peak Masters and Hall Masters had their own views and ideas.But one good thing was that even if these Peak Masters and Hall Masters frequently disagreed, quarreled, or even physically fought, no one could deny that they were all doing it for the sake of Liu Guang Sect\u2019s future.After learning about that, Xu ZiYan quietly heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. As long as it wasn\u2019t an internal power struggle, it was fine. Since everyone was working toward Liu Guang Sect\u2019s future, no matter how at odds they were with each other, nothing too unreasonable would happen.The entire time Xu ZiYan and Lin Qing chatted, Xu ZiRong did not say a single word.Although Lin Qing also attempted to talk to him midway, Xu ZiRong\u2019s cold expression forced him to retreat. Lin Qing had no other choice but to turn back and continue chatting with Xu ZiYan.After the event, Lin Qing mentally wiped away his cold sweat. They were obviously brothers, so why was the younger brother more intimidating than the older one?After chatting with Lin Qing, the other expressed that, as an outer-sect disciple of the Miscellaneous Hall, he couldn\u2019t help with anything big, but he was capable of helping with simple tasks. If Xu ZiYan had something that needed to be done, such as taking care of the spiritual plant fields, raising spiritual birds, or even sweeping the floor\u2014 he could take on those kinds of jobs. He guaranteed that everything would be done perfectly, and Xu ZiYan would not need to worry about it.Xu ZiYan smiled and accepted his good intentions. He would never refuse any olive branches that were extended to him by someone\u2019s own accord.The so-called expression explained it clearly\u2014 another friend meant another potential path to take. Xu ZiYan never felt that the inner-sect disciples were much grander than the outer-sect disciples. He believed that all places needed people to do menial tasks such as the things Lin Qing had listed just now. If Xu ZiYan had a nasty attitude while ordering him to do something, Lin Qing would still do it. However, who could say whether or not he would do something shady in the background?After all, Lin Qing could allow your spiritual plant field to get infested with pests. He could have your spiritual birds suffer diarrhea. You could even tell whether he did his best to sweep the floor of your room or half assed it.Xu ZiYan knew that no matter which sect it was, the inner-sect disciples would use an aloof and remote attitude when facing the outer-sect disciples. In addition, the chief succeeding disciples would feel like they were even grander than the inner-sect disciples.Nowadays, he could be considered Big Foot Luo\u2019s succeeding disciple. However, Xu ZiYan definitely wouldn\u2019t use his identity to suppress others.He wasn\u2019t the main character of the novel, so he did not have a tyrannical aura that made others pledge their allegiance the moment they met. Since that was the case, as the former CEO of a medium-sized company, being benevolent was precisely the secret to his success.After bidding Lin Qing goodbye, Xu ZiYan took Xu ZiRong to the Training Hall.He had counted the days. Today just so happened to be the day the Training Hall began class. The outer-sect disciples were all taught by inner-sect disciples in the Foundation Establishment realm. Meanwhile, the inner-sect disciples would receive lectures from Meridian Condensation cultivators.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOf course, occasionally having luck, they can also meet the Jin Dan cultivator having a lecture, and those inner-sect disciples can be seen in this class by a cultivator, which they may be changed from inner-sect disciples to succeeding disciples.After the lecture, they can practice various exercises in the quiet room in the back hall of the cultivating hall. Although the price is very expensive, it is definitely worth the money.The main purpose of Xu Ziyan today is to go to the quiet room. Of course, he is not practicing the cultivating, but following the teachings of the master, going there to take advantage of it\u2026His cultivation manual of hiding thunder is to use thunder and lightning to temper the body. The so-called manual is to absorb that lightning into his body, as an energy reserve, and release them when they encounter the enemy.This cultivation manual of hiding thunder can only absorb a thunder in the first layer, and the quality of the first thunder is related to other lightning that it can absorb in the future.It\u2019s a pity that Big Foot Luo is a cultivator of the ice spiritual root, and there is no good thunder in his hand, so he can only have the idea of collections of Liu Guang Sect.Let him go to the Treasure House, which he will never do, even if he is a junior-apprentice brother of the master. If he wants to rob the Treasure House, I am afraid that he will be slain by his brother. However, he does not want his disciples to be bad, and he can deal with it casually. He wants to think about it, and only those green spiritual thunders which are practicing in the back of the cultivation hall are the best for him.Anyway, there are a lot of collections of the green spiritual thunder, and it doesn\u2019t matter if they get one or two. Big Foot Luo is very irresponsible to think of.And Xu Ziyan is obedient to the teachings of the master. Since the master said that he can take it, he will not be polite. Only the master gave him a special explanation of the method of \u2018take it\u2019 so that he should pay attention to it, don\u2019t be discovered by others. Even if it is discovered, he will not admit.The rest is solved by him.Xu Ziyan had a new understanding of the shameless degree of Big Foot Luo, but since the benefits were his, he doesn\u2019t not intend to refuse.After spending ten pieces of low-grade spiritual stone and renting two quiet rooms, he sent Xu Zirong to cultivating himself.Stealing something is so cumbersome. He must not let his baby brother know, otherwise, it is ruining his image.After entering the quiet room, he opens the mechanism. The door of the quiet room is blocked by a sleek, mirror-like boulder. Then, many cultivating projects emerged from the boulder.Select \u2018Thunder battle array\u2019 and then follow the instructions above to do it in a fixed position. Soon, the top of Xu Ziyan\u2019s head begins to form a piece of cloud.This thunder battle is used to make the body repaired, but also allows the general cultivator to feel the power of the thunder in advance.It is said that hundreds of years ago, there was a cultivator in Xuan Yu area who was in a Jin Dan battle. It was because the thunder was too huge that he failed. Although it was a joke, it gave all the sects a notice.Some of the thunders are very loud, and if they fail because of panic, it will be a joke.Since then, almost every sect has set up a similar array of a thunder array to honed his disciples. Later, it was discovered that it is also very good to use this array to repair the body, and the thunder array has become a standing array of various sects.Of course, the thunder array is easy to make, and the thunder inside the array is not easy to get. The ordinary sect also use the thunder that some cultivators condense, and those big sects go back to catch various flashes of lightning for the development of future generations.Among them, the green spiritual thunder is the most powerful, and this kind of thunder is only superior to the purple spiritual thunder, even if it has been weakened many times, it has a very high quality.At present, Xu Ziyan\u2019s small body can not withstand the real green spiritual thunder, so he can only secretly steal from the thunder array that is a little thicker than the hair.After the start of the array, the top of Xu Ziyan\u2019s head began to be in cloudy, and the moving was taking the thunder.Big Foot Luo reminded him that there are a total of nine thunders in this array, step by step, only the ninth thunder is the real green spiritual thunder, and the former ones, at most, are false.Therefore, if Xu Ziyan wants to steal the trace of thunder, at least he must survive the first eight thunders, and he can\u2019t lose consciousness. That is to say, it sounds simple, but it is very difficult to do.Xu Ziyan silently sits in the same place, doing all the preparations, but the difference in strength is not overcome by his will alone. How can he stand that because he is a small cultivator?Undoubtedly, after the first thunder, Xu Ziyan fainted with the whole balck body, which is still because of his physique of thunder spiritual root, otherwise, it is not just fainting.He doesn\u2019t know how long he was in a coma. When Xu Ziyan woke up, only with a slight movement, the bones of the whole body make a squeaking sound. He took a breath and only felt that the whole body was crisp as if he touched it casually the bones will break into the end.Lying on the ground for a while, Xu Ziyan barely climbed up. He is very clear that today\u2019s cultivation is over, and he does not want to cultivate the thunder before he builds the foundation.\u201cBrother! How are you?\u201d When the door of the quiet room is opened, he see Xu Zirong waiting anxiously outside the door.Once the door of the quiet room is closed, unless the person inside opens it, at least the repair of the Jin Dan Age will be able to open the door.\u201cNothing.\u201d Xu Ziyan made a casual smile. Fortunately, he had to take care of himself before opening the door, otherwise, Zirong would have to worry about him.Xu Ziyan keeps a straight face and complains: \u201cMy brother has been in for three days and has not come out yet. How could it be okay?\u201d\u201cThree days?\u201d Xu Ziyan was very surprised. Did he faint for three days?\u201cBrother, are you okay?\u201d Xu Ziyan frowned. He has been inactive since out the door of the quiet room, and he looks exhausted. It doesn\u2019t look like \u2018nothing\u2019.\u201cOh\u2026 it\u2019s a little tired.\u201d Xu Ziyan feels that in his current state, it is a difficult task to go straight out and he has to say half of the truth.Xu Zirong says nothing, raising his hand and holding Xu Ziyan\u2019s arm, let him lean on his body.The two brothers then left the cultivating hall and returned to Tian Luo Peak. On this road, Xu Ziyan does not bear the other grievances of the other side and said the consequences of his inside.\u201cBrother, that is so powerful, you still have to wait until you build the foundation.\u201d Xu Zirong secretly blamed Big Foot Luo in his heart. His brother was only refining the Qi. How could he bear the thunder array prepared by the cultivator in coagulation pulse state? This guy will not be a dotard!\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t think that the thunder was so powerful. It was only the first thunder that I fainted for three days. If I want to be awake to the ninth, I am afraid it will not work now.\u201d Xu Ziyan is also very helpless When the master said that he was relaxed, who knew that the thunder array was so powerful, and the master has deliberately framed him.Half of leaning on Xu Zirong, they spends nearly two hours to return to the simple grass house on the Tian Luo Peak.The leaking places have been blocked by the branches of vines that Xu Zikai has made. Today, the walls and roofs of this small hut are covered with green vines, and some small white flowers emit sweet smells.Living in this house, not only does not feel worn out, but there is a leisurely feeling.Holding Xu Ziyan to lie down, Xu Zirong himself also lies down. It was anxious for him in the past three days. If he could not feel the danger of his life through the blood of Xu Ziyan in his hand, maybe he could not help but open the door and rushed in.He didn\u2019t see brother for three days. Xu Zirong only felt that the temper of the heart was almost impossible to suppress.It\u2019s strange that when he was occasionally irritated, it\u2019s better to avoid his brother. He doesn\u2019t expect it to be more than a day. He found that his inner irritability has developed to the point of crazy.If it is not because of his reason, it is clear that the nature of this killer will bring great trouble to his brother. He wants to\u2026The blood gradually becomes stained with double eyes, and Xu Zirong closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, calming down slowly.After his eyes return to normal, he slowly blinks, but finds that Xu Ziyan looked at him apologetically: \u201cSorry, let you be worried.\u201dXu Ziyan touches Xu Zirong\u2019s head with a generous big hand. He could feel the child\u2019s dependence on him. He disappeared for three days. Even if he knew something, he was only an eleven-year-old child. He must be frightened.\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d Xu Zirong whispers and is into Xu Ziyan\u2019s arms.Xu Ziyan smiles, and generously contributes his arms and tokes him in.Xu Zirong listens quietly to Xu Ziyan\u2019s heartbeat, strong and powerful, and the blood pulsation is filled with jubilant vitality.His brother is his own!Every time Xu Zirong thinks about this fact, he will feel extremely satisfied.What about the master? In his brother\u2019s heart, the most important thing is always himself! It can only be himself!Anyone who might threaten his position, he must wipe out the other side without missing any traces.\u201cStupid disciple! Silly disciple!\u201dAt this warm time, there comes a loud voice out of the window destroyed this warm atmosphere.Xu Zirong suddenly feels bad and stares at the window.Xu Ziyan hasto smile and patted his back to pacify, and he wondered that these two people have the name of the master. Is it necessary to use such a tit-for-tat?He doesn\u2019t believe that Big Foot Luo did not realize that their two brothers were in contact with each other. It is not a problem to cover the entire Liu Guang Sect with the spiritual knowledge of his Yuan Ying cultivator, moeriver it is the small hut so close to him.Really\u2026 People always said old children, and the master are all over 2,000-year old. He is always angry with an eleven-year-old child\u2026\u201cHey, the stupid disciple is coming back.\u201d Big Foot Luo\u2019s big voice rings outside the door, following by a bang, and the wooden door that had just been repaired for a few days fell to the ground again.(The wooden door: Wuuuuu\u2026)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You won\u2019t even hold on to the first thunder?\u201d Luo asked with amazement.It is found that the look on Luo\u2019s face is not like a fake. Xu Ziyan suddenly had a guilty conscience. Isn\u2019t this thunder array difficult? Just he didn\u2019t find the trick.\u201cMy brother was comatose in a quiet room for three days.\u201d Xu Ziyan said coldly, looking at Luo\u2019s eyes, seems to be waiting for his explanation.\u201cThree days? Yes, the first score is still OK.\u201d Luo lickes the few beards that had just grown on his chin and shakes his head.Xu Zirong suddenly fells angry. Is three-days coma still a good result? ? The first thunder made his comatose for so long. If he continued, wouldn\u2019t it have to smash brother into dregs?Although he was a magician in las life, the people he killed was not too many, except that Xu\u2019s family, only those who coveted his beauty. Even so, he almost lost him half a life by the thunder. If he was not prepared adequately, and the location of the thunder array was very secret, even if he was not smashed into ash, he he would be seriously injured and died in the hands of the so-called righteous cultivators.Is the power of thunder that most people can bear? Although this thunder array is only an imitation, the power can not be underestimated. Big Foot Luo is to let his brother die.Xu Zirong\u2019s gaze on Luo\u2019s feet is already bloody, and Luo believes that this kid can fight against himself now, he will want to rush to destroy himself.But\u2026It is good to tease the disciple? Compared with other well-behaved disciples, the sense of accomplishment of teasing this disciple is very well.Looking at the other side\u2019s madness that because he can\u2019t beat the master and can only hold back, Luo only feels refreshed. It seems that the bottleneck of Yuan Ying late period has a relax.Deliberately pretending not to see Xu Zirong\u2019s murderous eyes, Luo looked at Xu Ziyan with a look of approval: \u201cYes, there is great potential. I thought that when one of my senior-apprentice brother practiced this hiding thunder, he alsohad the idea of the thunder. But he is much worse than you, he was in coma in a small half a year before he woke up.\u201dXu Ziyan looks at Big Foot Luo with no expression. Did you compliment me? But why do I want to hit you after I listen?It seems that he was aware of his own mistakes. Luo quickly laughed: \u201cAh, hahaha\u2026 I am not responsible for you, but my brother\u2019s heart is high when he first contacted the thunder array who are only have five layers of refining, I think you are all refining, and certainly you are not so bad.\u201dXu Ziyan was completely speechless, and the thunder array is prepared for the cultivator in in coagulation pulse state and a five-layer cultivator challenges it. Master, is your brother normal?Big Foot Luo does not pay attention to Xu Ziyan\u2019s doubts. He carefully asks Xu Ziyan the pass that he was struck by the Thunder and then calculates it again.Big Foot Luo is not like be irresponsible. The cultivation manual of hiding thunder is a very partial cultivation manual of the Liu Guang Sect. Its power is very large, but it has extremely high requirements for physique. If it is not because that Xu Ziyan has thunder spiritual root his physique is also very strong, Luo will not recommend him to cultivator the manual.Moreover, the manual can also be used as the killing skill of Xu Ziyan, because Xu Ziyan\u2019s thunder spiritual arrow is the way to condense the spiritual power of the body into an arrow. If he cultivates the manual to a very high level, then he can completely turn the thunder in the body into a Thunder arrow and shoots it out.The power of ordinary spiritual and the thunder cannot be said in the same breath. If the other party is accustomed to the power of ordinary Thunder spiritual arrow, it will be in after encountering the arrow. Luo even dared to say that the thunder spiritual arrow formed by the thunder may make a big loss for the cultivators who are higher than him.Combined with Xu Ziyan\u2019s experience, Luo added the results he had calculated. Soon, he deduced a method specifically for bearing the thunder.If this method is used well, it can be used as a hard-resisting attack against the thunder during the refining period, but this is only limited to the people like Xu Ziyan who has the physique of the thunder spiritual root.It can be said that this method is created by Luo specifically for Xu Ziyan. Except for him, no one else is applicable.Although he is extremely dissatisfied with Luo, Xu Zirong does not interrupt the other party\u2019s discussions with Xu Ziyan.In addition to some indignation at the beginning, Xu Zirong could not help but be fascinated about their words.The bloody demon of the previous life had a cultivation of the Yuan Ying period, but in all kinds of experience, he was not so far away from Luo Yun Dao. When Big Foot Luo explained to Xu Ziyan, Xu Zirong got great benefit unconsciously.The more he listened, the more he is surprised. The way Luo used to explain to Xu Ziyan is very clear, and even he benefited a lot.This Big Foot Luo is\u2026Xu Zirong has doubt, but the scruple to Luo is deeper and deeper.***Since Luo specially created a set of magic skills for Xu Ziyan, he began a sad cultivation career.Into the thunder array\u2014be split by the thunder\u2014coma\u2014wake up\u2014rehabilitate\u2014 continue to be split by the thunderBy repeating this process, he is pleasantly surprised to find that after he was split by the thunder, the time of coma becomes shorter and shorter.After seventeen days, he finally manages to be awake and bear the first thunder. After the ecstasy, he begins to repeat the process.Although Xu Zirong is very distressed that his brother suffers such torture every day, he also knows that in this cultivation world, no strength is impossible.Therefore, he just silently takes care of everything for his brother. All the tasks that Luo had made are taken over by him. Anyway, for him, cultivation is nothing but the accumulation of spiritual power. He has memory of his last life. He has no bottleneck, as long as it is time of cultivation, he can break through at any time.For the entire six months, Xu Ziyan experienced several dangers and finally succeeded\u2014stealing a trace of green spiritual thunder.Looking the blue spiritual thunder at his palm that seems to swim around like a dragon, Xu Ziyan has the urge to burst into tears.Who has the feeling of being split by thunder every day? Who can\uff1fNow, when he sees thunder and rain, he has the urge to greet the thunder.\u201cYes, you got it in half a year, very good.\u201d Luo sees the light obediently wandering around Xu Ziyan\u2019s fingers, his face is showing approval.In the beginning, he set up this plan for Xu Ziyan, and there are also many elements of riskiness. However, the benefit of the manual is not only the green spiritual thunder but that with the improvement of his cultivation, his thunder spiritual root will become more and purer. Even when he is flying, there is a certain chance to swallow up the thunder!Of course, this oddity is small, but his physical resistance to thunder is clear.Perhaps Xu Ziyan himself knows the magical features of the hiding thunder, so he is so hard, even in the short period of six months, the first layer of cultivation has been successful. Moreover, the first layer that he had absorbed is the level of the green spiritual thunder which would be a solid foundation for his foundation.After half a year of hard work, Xu Ziyan mastered the meaning of green spiritual thunder, and Xu Zirong is very considerate, through various responsibilities, and returns the contribution of the sects that Xu Xiyan originally owed\u2026In this regard, Xu Ziyan had self-reproach for a long time, and Xu Zirong told him that he had been trained through these chores and that he had an epiphany, and now he has made the refining.Because both of their brothers have already met the requirements of building a foundation, according to the regulations, they can apply for building a Dan base to the martial art, but Luo does not agree with them.In his view, whether it is Xu Ziyan or Xu Zirong, they are all talented and outstanding, how can a small building base stop them. Instead of taking the base, he will be able to use the opportunity to enter the kylin Tower to impact the Dan foundation. If he can build the foundation without the Dan foundation, then their future achievements will be even more unimaginable.For the proposal of Luo, the Xu brothers naturally agree with it.Xu Zirong does not need to say that if he is not afraid of being too conspicuous, he can already build a foundation. And Xu Ziyan also wants to try it out. After all, even if he fails, he can take Zhuji Dan, but if he doesn\u2019t try it, he will not be reconciled.The Kylin Tower is located on a side of the Liu Guang Sect. The original name of the side peak has long been forgotten, but because the Kylin Tower is above it, it is called the Kylin Peak.The altitude of Kylin Peak is not high, and Xu brothers only climbs to the summit in a short time. On the top of the peak is a blue-sanded square, and in the center of the square stands a wooden pagoda with only seven floors.The pagoda is not high but it is majestic and thorough. Just looking far away, you can feel the ancient atmosphere that came from above.The atmosphere is huge and powerful, Xu Ziyan even trembles unconsciously, and his eyes are also showing some horror.It is said that the Kylin Tower was cast from the blood of a dead Kylin,. He didn\u2019t expect the beast to die for so long, but his breath was still so strong that he felt extreme awe.Xu Zirong\u2019s performance is similar to that of Xu Ziyan. Although he has been in contact with many high-ranking cultivators in his life, no one can match the feeling of this Kylin Tower.Not to mention that the Kylin Tower is just a dead object. It is only by this that you can imagine how powerful the original beast would be.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He is stiff and his right foot on the bluestone board did not dare to move. He has a feeling that he would be killed as long as he moves a little.\u201cBrother?\u201d Noticing Xu Ziyan\u2019s feeling, Xu Zirong immediately becomes alert and looks around carefully, but nothing can be found.XuZiyan feels very uncomfortable. It is very difficult to keep a posture during a long time. In particular, one of his feet does not dare to force. One food standing is not a good posture to maintain balance.He bits his teeth and takes a foot from the bluestone board. He relives completely until his right foot steps on the ground outside the bluestone.Wiping the cold sweat from the forehead, Xu Ziyan guesses: he wondered before Important as the Kylin Pagoda is, but no one cares. Now, it seems that it\u2019s useless to take care of it. As long as there is still the big array in this square, everyone who goes into there will be smashed into slag!\u201cWhat a powerful array\u2026\u201d Xu Ziyan says with a long sigh.Xu Zirong come to know that Xu Ziyan\u2019s appearance like that is due to the big array\u2026After thinking about it, Xu Ziyan takes out the Pagoda entry certificate that the headmaster gave them and hangs it on his waist. Now he steps into the Qingshi square again, and there is no sense of crisis hanging above his head.When they enter the gate of the Kylin Pagoda, they are shocked by the strong spiritual energy inside.If the spiritual energy around the Mo Xin town where the Xu family is located is level one, then that in the gate of Liu Guang Sect mountain is about level ten, and the Kylin Pagoda on the first floor is at least one hundred times that of the Xu family. It\u2019s no wonder that the master said they can use the environment here to build the foundation, that is, without building the foundation pill, the spiritual energy here is enough to make them complete the breakthrough.The space on the first floor of the Kylin Pagoda is not large, only tens of feet in the square. In the middle of the room is a big pillar. All the spiritual energy in the room comes from this pillar.Close to the spirit column, dozens of cattail cushions randomly placed, and three people are meditated. Xu Ziyan is a stranger to all three of them. He doesn\u2019t have any impression. He guesses that they have no any contact with him.The quota of a Kylin Pagoda can only be cultivated for one month in it. Such a strong spiritual energy can be cultivated for one month here, which is worth one or two years of painstaking cultivation outside.Xu Ziyan does not dare to site his precious time. He hurriedly takes Xu Zirong to find a cattail cushion near the spiritual pillar and sits down.At the beginning, the spiritual energy in the room rushes towards them like a shark smelling bloody smell, into their bodies through a few acupoints.The pure spiritual energy in the Kylin Pagoda ishes the meridians of the two men over and over again, and forces some of the hidden stains in their bodies out of the body. This flushing feeling is very comfortable. If Xu Ziyan does not restrain himself forcibly, he almost came out comfortably.Xu Zirong is exposed to such a strong spiritual energy for the first time. He is overjoyed and begins to desperately absorb it. Because of the practice of Xuehai classic, the impurities in his body are several times more than that of Xu Ziyan. Although it is convenient and fast, it also has very serious sequelae.He didn\u2019t have too many choices in his last life. He could only endure the impurities in his blood. The initial situation is not obvious, but the more he practiced, the more he felt the impediments caused by those impurities.Everyone who cultivates the truth knows that the more pure things, the higher the quality, so does the spirit root and the body quality, thus, those with special physique will get more favor.In the last life, Xu Zirong could only stop at the first level. To a large extent, it is because there are too many impurities absorbed, and there is no such peerless treasure. There is no way to force them out of the body.In this life, he has the opportunity to use the pure spiritual energy of the Kylin Pagoda to build the foundation. As long as the foundation is built, the impurities will no longer be his obstacles. Perhaps, in this life, he is expected to advance the God of Mahayana.At the thought of this, Xu Zirong couldn\u2019t help but feel hot. The pursuit of strength was one of the most persistent things in his last life, and in this life \u2013 \u2013He opens his eyes softly and glances at Xu Ziyan, who was seriously practicing, and closed his eyes slowly.Perhaps\u2026 his attachment to his brother is enough to match his pursuit of power.The particular concentration of the two brothers cultivated, almost forgets the passage of time. After seven days of washing by spiritual energy, Xu Zirong starts building the foundation one step ahead of Xu Ziyan.Through internal vision, Xu Zirong clearly sees that his spiritual energy in Dantian had reached its apex. He begins to constantly compress and squeeze those pure spiritual energy to attack Dantian. The spiritual energy surge attacks again and again without stopping. Dantian\u2019s inner wall is broken and the diameter expanded more than double after three days of persistence.The capacity of Dantian expanded, and Xu Zirong immediately begins to exercise his power and once again absorbs the spiritual energy .A crazy spiritual energy is swirling around him, and the spiritual energy of the entire Kylin Pagoda begins to produce dramatic fluctuations.The layered spiritual energy even has a misty silk thread, which tightly wraps the Xu Zirong to form a huge spiritual energy cocoon.Xu Zirong\u2019s such great movement suddenly shocks the other three people. Except for XuZiyan\u2019s efforts to fight the impurities in his body, the other three can\u2019t help but wake up from the entrance and watch the huge spiritual energy.One of the beautiful girls is surprised and says: \u201cThis is\u2026 building a foundation? Is it a new entry for the disciples to build a foundation here?\u201d\u201cIt should be.\u201d A burly cultivator next to him nodded. \u201cI have always heard that this group of disciples is incredible. It seems that this is really true. At a beginner, there is a place for Kylin Court. I think it should be the top three of the inner sect assessments.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the first and the second.\u201d Another young man looks at the spiritual energy with a complex look: \u201cThe one that builds the base should be the second, next to is the top.\u201d\u201cOh? Have you seen them?\u201d asks the beautiful girl curiously.The young man said with a wry smile: \u201cAt that time, I just picked up the task of the wild ghost master, that is, to attack the disciples. As a result, the first attack, the Qi Lian next to me had bad luck, whose foundation has not been built yet.\u201d\u201cHe is the new disciple who has let Qi Lian stay in the practice hall for half a year and still have to stay for another half a year?\u201d the beautiful girl stuns with her lips sipped.\u201cYes, it is him.\u201d The young man raises his chin toward XuZiyan. \u201cYou definitely can\u2019t think of it. The one who built the foundation now is his brother\u2026\u201d He says and his expression becomes very tangled.\u201cHow old is the younger brother?\u201d The girl is as curious as a baby, and she wants to know everything.\u201cEleven years old, three spititual roots.\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201d The girl says: \u201cI remember that the top of the list has Lei spiritual root. If his brother has three spiritual roots, how could he build a base faster than his brother? And\u2026 no! You said that the small building now the younger brother is only eleven years old!!!\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d The young man looks helpless. He considers that he is also a young and promising scholastic disciple and build the foundation less than 20 years old. However, if he compares with him\u2026 , forget it, or don\u2019t compare it, leave some face for yourself!\u201cIt\u2019s really the new generation excels the last one.\u201d The burly man can\u2019t help but feel.\u201cHow? Worried about your status?\u201d The girl smiled. \u201cAfraid of being a former wave?\u201dThe burly man laughs. Of course he didn\u2019t worry about this kind of thing. He is so happy that his little younger brother can have such a result. How can he be jealous?The three people started to practice again after a few laughs. No one who can qualify for the Kylin Pagoda will waste this precious time.Under the efforts of Xu Zirong, his spiritual energy in Dantian is finally squeezed, forming the first drop of spiritual energy. With this first drop, those after that are no longer a problem.The endless purity of the surrounding spirit makes Xu Zirong not worried about the failure of the foundation. In essence, Zhuji Dan is actually a super spiritual energy source. Now the spiritual energy of the Kylin Pagoda can completely replace the role of the spiritual energy source. Moreover, he has built one in his last life. If the person who built the foundation once and fails again, he might as well find a belt to kill himself.It takes another three days, and the spiritual energy of Xu Zirong is transformed into a liquid. During the transformation process, these spiritual energy is swimming along the meridians again and again, and the impurities in his body are forced out a lot.At this time, Xu Zirong looked very dirty, and the skin is covered with some black and red stains. Fortunately, the three people have now settled again, otherwise they will look at the stains that seem to be abnormal, which will lead to some trouble.A simple dust-cleaning technique, the stains on the body are swept away. Xu Zirong takes a long breath and his body has a feeling of ease that he had never felt before.His eyes flashed a glimmer of joy, but he did not expect that the spiritual energy of the Kirin Pagoda is so pure, and cleans up all the impurities left in his body. With this base foundation, as long as he absorbs the refining blood, he will spend more time to purify it. In the future, the impurities in these blood will no longer be harmful.Looking up at Xu Ziyan, Xu Ziyu\u2019s possessiveness in his eyes is a bit thicker. He is very clear that all this is brought to him by his brother. If it is not the existence of his brother, he will definitely go back to the old way of his last life.Brother, you really are the gift that God compensated me.Xu Zirong has already identified Xu\u2019s existence as a compensation for his unfairness in his life. What happens today is that he once again confirmed Xu\u2019s ownership.His brother belongs to him, and God gives it to him. He will protect his brother and prevent anyone from taking him away.Compared with Xu Zirong\u2019s great noise when building the foundation, XuZiyan\u2019s is also much the same.The giant python formed by the spiritual energy wrapped him up layer by layer. If it is comparatively speaking, his spiritual energy may be bigger than that of Xu Zirong.Without any surprise, Xu Ziyan\u2019s movement once again awakened the three men who practiced there.Looking at this spiritual energy cocoon, the three have no words to express.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then they began cultivating once more.Such pure spiritual energy couldn\u2019t be wasted. Xu Ziyan got into the state of meditation again after confirming the building of the foundation was well.He didn\u2019t know that Xu Ziyan was enduring the torture from the green spiritual thunder inside the spiritual huge cocoon which he couldn\u2019t figure out.\u201cMaster, you\u2019re making troubles for me\u2026\u2026\u201d Xu Ziyan complained with sweat all over his head. His countenance was distorted.The building of the foundation before went well until he had smashed the inner wall of dantian which had widen dantian range; consequently the hint of green spiritual thunder he conserved in dantian erupted suddenly. It was like a moving fish constantly attacking the spiritual energy he gathered hard.Gathering energy into liquid was one of the marks which meant the building of the foundation was successful, but every time the spiritual energy he intended to condense was broken by that hint of green spiritual thunder.The green spiritual thunder now was like a naughty kid running about inside the dantian of Xu Ziyan\uff0conce the spiritual energy gathered around it would be broke by the kid right away which made Xu Ziyan had no opportunity to condense the spiritual energy.Xu Ziyan tried again and again which made him exhausted. Although the spiritual energy inside the Kylin tower was countless to supply, but if it kept the way it was, he would fail building the foundation sooner or later.Now he felt lucky that he didn\u2019t took the building medicine, or he would fail building depending on the spiritual energy inside the pill, he might get hurt.Now Xu Ziyan could only try again and again to condense the spiritual energy at the corner of dantian, but the green spiritual thunder seemed to have opened a radar, no matter where the spiritual energy was, it would rush to there and broke it.Xu Ziyan hated it like mad. If that green spiritual energy had turned into a kid in front of him, he would definitely kick his ass\u2026\u2026Just like this, Xu Ziyan and the green spiritual energy started guerrilla war inside his dantian, they fought forth and back happily.While Xu Ziyan and the green spiritual energy was playing, the building of the foundation for Xu Zirong had finished. He watched the spiritual cocoon anxiously after everything was settled.It had been seven days since Xu Ziyan got there. Technically the building of the foundation should have finished for seven days, but he didn\u2019t move at all.Xu Zirong didn\u2019t look good, he could never imagine that inside this Kylin tower Xu Ziyan would meet any difficulty building the foundation.He didn\u2019t know if that Xu Ziyan from previous life had ever experienced failure building the foundation, but now the truth in front of him was that the spiritual energy wave had became weaker and weaker; it was obvious that Xu Ziyan had no strength to break out.\u201cShit! What\u2019s going on?\u201d Xu Zirong thought anxiously. He couldn\u2019t endure any accident happened to his brother especially when the accident happened in front of him.He was always confident about himself, he felt that even though he was not that good, but depending on his memory and excellency from previous life he could protect his brother. He could never imagine that he had only joined Liu Guang Sect for half a year, the reality had taught him a lesson. He was so weak that he could only watch his brother\u2019s failure.\u201cWhat? That junior-apprentice brother hasn\u2019t finished building?\u201d The young girl woke up from meditation, she watched that spiritual cocoon and said so curiously.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The wave of spiritual energy gets weaker, maybe it gets dangerous about the building.\u201d The strong man said so with brows frowned.\u201cWhat? No way. Is it possible to fail inside the Kylin tower?\u201d The young girl said unbelievably with her hands covering her mouth.Xu Zirong gave her a black look. What did this lady mean? Was she hinting that my brother was a loser?The young girl was shocked by that look noticing her words were improper. She felt sorry for that and shrunk behind the strong man.The strong man had realized the mistake the young girl had made, but he also noticed the look with killing desire of Xu Zirong.The strong man got shocked at heart, he was surprised: that boy was still young, how come he got so strong will of killing? He was exactly like an old cultivator who had experienced numerous killings.They made eye contact. Xu Zirong restrained his will of killing a little bit. He didn\u2019t want to make any trouble for his brother especially when his brother was in trouble already.The three of them watched the spiritual energy inside the spiritual cocoon had become weaker and weaker, their expression turned into pitiful.Although there was no big danger if the building failed, but it might bring much pressure to those newcomers.That strong man had ever heard his master said that among the disciples of his generation, there was a cultivator from wood spiritual root who was an elite among those disciples; maybe just because he had never met any difficulty before, when he first built the foundation he failed because of some accident.This failure stayed a pain in his heart. Only for a building he should cost three years and three times he failed, only the fourth time he succeeded.But even though he succeeded, after that, he had lost the strong spirit like before. Years later, a well-known wood spiritual root cultivator only cultivated to the stage of Meridian Condensation. At last, the time had come and he died then.The strong man sighed seeing that there was no movement inside the spiritual cocoon. Now he only hoped that this junior-apprentice brother could put himself together and didn\u2019t ever step into the old way like his uncle apprentice.Boom!When everyone had confirmed that Xu Ziyan would definitely fail and sighed for him, that huge spiritual cocoon cracked suddenly. A powerful thunder force burst out of it.\u201cWatch out!\u201d The strong man shouted. He turned his wrist, an adult height yellow shield protected them firmly. \u201cYu Ling, help him out.\u201dThat young man immediately put a golden force to that big shield. There was a hint of golden light above the big yellow shield.The young girl cooperated in time as well. She swung her right hand, the belt popped out swiftly towards Xu Zirong.The moment he was wrapped, the first reaction of Xu Zirong was to condense the blood to a blade to cut off this belt.The good thing was that he had realized in time that she didn\u2019t want to attack him but to save him.Although he wasn\u2019t used to it, he tried to restrain himself not to attack and just let the belt wrap him and got him behind the big shield.Meanwhile, the strong man and the young boy naturally blocked beside him trying to protect him and that young girl.In front of them was the big shield and beside them were two senior-apprentice brothers, Xu Zirong was very safe, but this kind of protection by strangers made him feel weird.\u201cIt\u2019s coming!\u201d The strong man said.A flow of purple thunder burst out of the spiritual cocoon continuously. It jumped around hitting at everywhere of the room making sound of crack.Xu Zirong\u2019s eyes was blocked, he intended to see what was the situation of his brother but was pressed by the strong man. He didn\u2019t need to persuade but with his big hand pressing on his head, he could never move.Xu Zirong was upset. Let along the ability, his strength was weaker than the others. It was not beneficial!\u201cPhew! Too dangerous!\u201dJust when the three of them was eluding the attack from the thunder carefully the clouds went away after the spiritual cocoon boomed and a man showed up inside it.Xu Ziyan\u2019s hair was straight and his face was black, his all clothes were destroyed by the thunder. He was luck that he had found a rope when those clouds were still there or he would be embarrassed now.\u201cBrother!\u201d Xu Zirong couldn\u2019t help coming out of the big shield pushing the strong man\u2019s hands always when he heard his brothers voice.He didn\u2019t care too much about Xu Ziyan\u2019s safety, the condensed blood was there, he could feel the danger if Xu Ziyan was weak or under attack.He was so anxious just because he hadn\u2019t seen his brother for a long time. He had been much better now when he had heard his brother\u2019s voice.Noticing there was no danger, the strong man let Xu Zirong go.He had never thought that this indifferent boy should be so dependent to his brother.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. I shouldn\u2019t let you worry.\u201d Although Xu Ziyan looked embarrassed but it didn\u2019t prevent him giving his little brother a warm hug.He knew this kid was dependent on him. They only spent three days to complete building whereas he had cost seven days silently and he nearly died at the end, he must be worried a lot.Xu Zirong put his head in his brother\u2019s arms listening to the strong heart beat of his.Bang! Bang!The impulse of blood was conveyed through warm skin, Xu Zirong love this sound.He took a big breath, there was some unfamiliar odor between his nose!!!Damn! How come there was this burnt smell?? Were you grilling when you were building???He lifted his head watching Xu Ziyan with upset, he didn\u2019t like other smell on his brother\u2019s body except its own.Eh\u2026\u2026If the smell came from himself it was totally another thing but except this, the smell on Xu Ziyan\u2019s body belonged to him! Anyone who tried to own this smell was his enemy!\u201cShit\u2026\u2026will the master punish us?\u201d Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t notice the upset glare of his little brother, he was watching around humbly.The green spiritual thunder burst out when he was building was exactly from his body, it was a very powerful force which was only inferior to purple spiritual thunder.Now the walls and the floor in the room were full of burnt marks which looked rather miserable.It was fortunate that it only \u201clooked\u201d miserable, it naturally couldn\u2019t be destroyed by the power of thunder given the material of Kylin tower\uff0d\uff0deven though it was green spiritual thunder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The strong man was an outstanding person among disciples of Liu Guang Sect, who were firm and indomitable, bold and forthright and loyal. He was almost recognized as a big brother.The strong man smiled and said no more. No matter it was time or place, it was not suitable to have a deeper conversation. They were all disciples of Liu Guang Sect after all, there was lots of time to talk in the future.After the three of them had left, Xu Ziyan hurried to strengthen himself because the accident brought by the green spiritual thunder made him spend seven days more, now it got closer to the date for them to leave the Kylin tower, if he couldn\u2019t strengthen well, without the pure spiritual energy here it would at least cost him much more time to complete this mission. It was not worthy!After cultivation of days and nights, Xu Ziyan had finally strengthened himself at the last day before it was expired.Now he had conserved the energy, bright lights coming out of his eyes; if you watched it carefully you could see a hint of green thunder light from the deep of his eyes.Even Big Foot Luo had never imagined that the green spiritual thunder absorbed lots of spiritual energy when Xu Ziyan was building the foundation relying on the spiritual energy to break the dantian which had strengthened itself and it merged into the dantian of Xu Ziyan finally.If someone could see inside the dantian of Xu Ziyan, he must be shocked because the dantian of others was all very peaceful but the dantian of Xu Ziyan was full of ferocious thunder power.The green spiritual thunder now had been strengthened to the size of a thumb after being tested by lots of spiritual energy. The thunder among them played casually in the dantian of Xu Ziyan, it seemed that the thunder had merged into the spiritual energy; not only was it not opposed, but also it made others feel that the green spiritual thunder was originally part of the spiritual energy inside Xu Ziyan\u2019s body.Although no one knew why the green spiritual thunder would change like that, but Xu Ziyan could feel that his body had some changes already.The changes were difficult for Xu Ziyan to judge: the advantage was that when he cast a thunder spell the green spiritual thunder would be added to its power and consequently the power had been increased twice; the disadvantage was that except for thunder he couldn\u2019t cast other kinds of spells including the most easy one: cleaning spell.All in all, Xu Ziyan thought it was worthy, after all the thunder spell excelled in attacking essentially.After leaving the range of Green Stone Square, the identity jade strips hanged beside their waists exploded to powder.Xu Ziyan turned his head watching the lofty tower, he knew that without this identity jade strip if he wanted to enter the Kylin tower again he would be attacked by the large array from the square.\u201cLet\u2019s go, it\u2019s not impossible that you come here again, you can win a place to come here anyway.\u201d Noticing Xu Zirong didn\u2019t want to leave either Xu Ziyan pretended to be generous and said so.Xu Zirong nodded silently but he was wondering in the heart: was it his illusion? Just now when the identity jade strips cracked he seemed to sense eyes landed on him from the Kylin tower.After watching the Kylin tower deeply Xu Zirong turned and went away. He knew exactly that no matter if someone was watching him, he was not capable of fighting back.Whereas he wasn\u2019t sure if it was disaster or fortune that someone from the Kylin tower cared about him so much.When the two of them had went away, in the quiet room of seventh floor of the Kylin tower, the master of Liu Guang Sect and Taoist Luo Yun and the blue-roped man who warned Xu Zirong at the Li Chen Bridge were sitting together enjoying drinking teas.\u201cHa, junior-apprentice brother, your disciple\u2019s sense is really sharp anyway.\u201d Taoist Wu Chen said with laughter.Taoist Luo Yun now had completely got rid of the image of Big Foot Luo, his hair was tidy and his rope was clean as well.\u201cDon\u2019t mention that naughty disciple.\u201d Although Taoist Luo Yun had dressed up cleaner the tone of his was still as lazy as before, \u201cthis naughty boy, he opposed against me all day.\u201dTaoist Wu Chen smiled and didn\u2019t answer. He thought his junior-apprentice brother was funny, if disciples were quiet and docile he would feel dull.\u201cThis boy enjoys killing too much.\u201d The blue-roped man said without any expression.Taoist Luo Yun laughed: \u201cForget it, whoever came from the very west place was into killing, is it worth to discuss?\u201dThe blue-roped man stopped for a while and said again: \u201cHe\u2019s only eleven.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Taoist Luo Yun said impatiently, \u201cDoes it matter if he\u2019s eleven or he likes killing?\u201dHe watched the blue-roped man coldly: \u201cWill you expel him just because of these two points? Or will you get him grounded?\u201dThe blue-roped man said nothing. Obviously he was thinking the possibility of implementing these two options.Taoist Wu Chen couldn\u2019t help but came to compromise for them: \u201cAlright junior-apprentice brother, the blue-roped man was only worrying about him.\u201d\u201cHumph.\u201d Taoist Luo Yun didn\u2019t say anything more except that \u201chumph\u201d. Anyway, he couldn\u2019t figure out why he had bad feelings about the blue-roped man every time he saw him.He hated most about the old saying \u201cwhat the kid is like determines his future\u201d , that was totally bullshit; if it really determined the future there was no need to educate him because he would be what he was like now no matter he was a good kid or a bad kid. In that way, we just killed those bad kids in advance for good. That was in vain to educate them to be a good man.The blue-roped man was not human after all, he couldn\u2019t understand the emotions between humans. If Xu Zirong was the blade of a sword, Xu Ziyan would be the most firm scabbard of the sword; as long as he didn\u2019t let go his hands, Xu Zirong would be repressed without any complain.Taoist Wu Chen couldn\u2019t do anything to stop his junior-apprentice brother\u2019s protection for disciple unconditionally, but he did not agree with the blue-roped man who wanted to eliminate danger in advance either.Given the situation it was now, he agreed with his junior-apprentice brother. It was a well-known big sect, there was no way that it made any trouble for a kid just because of this.No matter how, as long as Xu Zirong didn\u2019t do anything that against Liu Guang Sect, the sect would protect him then. They were responsible for this as masters, nothing would change it for any reason.The discussion about Xu Zirong had ended. Taoist Wu Chen\u2019s words made a conclusion for this completely.Taoist Luo Yun felt satisfied about it, whereas the blue-roped man stayed expressionless, there was no clue what he was thinking. But as a container spirit he should have no more opinions about it. He was just giving some advice, it was Taoist Wu Chen\u2019s concern if he accepted it or not.\u201cWhat do you think about Xu Ziyan?\u201d Consequently Taoist Wu Chen couldn\u2019t help mentioning Xu Ziyan again.These two brothers from Xu family really surprised him a lot. They were making so much noise which interrupted him who was cultivating quietly on the top of the tower.\u201cHumph, the disciple I appreciate must be genius.\u201d Taoist Luo Yun answered elatedly. He didn\u2019t know how to be humble at all.The blue-roped man thought a while: \u201cHe\u2019s kind in the heart but he\u2019s smart as well. He\u2019s a little inexperienced in front of enemies but he\u2019s also a future star.\u201dHearing the comments of the blue-roped man Taoist Luo Yun lifted the corners of his mouth a little. Although this silly disciple looked stupid in front of his little brother, but in the eyes of the others he was pretty good.Taoist Wu Chen stroked his beard and nodded: \u201cPretty good indeed, it\u2019s worthy that I had given two of them two green spiritual prints.\u201d\u201cHumph, senior-apprentice brother\u2019s so stingy. Why you only gave them two, not four? What will you do if they failed the first time?\u201d Luo Yun couldn\u2019t help murmuring.Taoist Wu Chen was driven crazy, he looked at him reproachfully: \u201cDo you think the green spiritual print is like a cabbage, we can give as many as we want? If they indeed failed merging, the reason can only be that they are unlucky with the green spiritual area.\u201dTaoist Luo Yun didn\u2019t agree: \u201cA good luck depends on the sum of green spiritual prints anyway, if we had enough green spiritual prints, unlucky can be changed to lucky.\u201dTaoist Wu Chen hardly wanted to speak with this guy anymore. The total sum of the green spiritual prints was only a dozen even though it was from Liu Guang Sect. Giving three of them to reward newcomers was generous enough, if they gave a few more to them, those elder cultivators might come and fight for their disciples who couldn\u2019t get any of them.Taoist Wu Chen changed topic immediately. He mentioned some strange phenomena while Xu Ziyan was building: \u201cWas that green spiritual thunder emitted while Xu Ziyan succeeded building?\u201d After finishing speaking, Taoist Wu Chen looked at Taoist Luo Yun with a forced smile.Taoist Luo Yun said straightly: \u201cThat\u2019s right. It was stolen from Cultivating Hall. There existed so many thunders, it\u2019s no big deal that one of them is missing. What\u2019s more, a cultivator like Xu Ziyan who has thunder spiritual root is rare, I guess it\u2019s only him who has the opportunity to steal one.\u201dTaoist Wu Chen couldn\u2019t help laughing. It could only be his junior-apprentice brother who dared to committee stealing righteously.\u201cNever mind, never mind.\u201d Taoist Wu Chen didn\u2019t intend to argue more knowing that he was not an opponent of arguing.The three of them went away after discussion about the strange phenomena of Xu Ziyan. There were lots of things to take care in Liu Guang Sect after all, they had work to do.As for Xu Ziyan, even though the emphasis should be put on his cultivation knowing he had got strange phenomena when he was building, he shouldn\u2019t be treated differently at this time.These all needed time to prove. They would put much emphasis on him if he had brought any treasure or heritage from the green spiritual area.It should be recognized that luck was a very important element in the course of cultivating.The Xu brothers didn\u2019t know that they had become the topic discussed by the master when they had been back to Tian Luo Peak. They got some rest after returning to that little hut.It depended on Xu Zirong\u2019s wood spell before to exist, now it had been one month without care, those vines were all wilted because of the lack of spiritual energy and consequently the whole hut collapsed\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the very beginning it couldn\u2019t be mended because he couldn\u2019t move for the sake of injury; then everyday he got hit by thunder, he came back every few days held by Xu Zirong; in this case he had few time mending it. They just had stolen the thunder then they had to go to the Kylin tower immediately. Given these factors it was a miracle that the hut had lasted so long time\u2026(Mr.Hut : QwQ\u2026 Now they know how resilient I was.)The thunder spell couldn\u2019t help at this time, Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t intend to let Xu Zirong do it anyway. Although his wood spell could help him a lot but he felt that Zirong had done a lot the half year before, it was time for the big brother to take the responsibility.Having taken all the useful stuff out of the hut he began drafting the design of a new hut.This was where he and Zirong would live for a long time, it must be as cozy as it could be for their own home.He drew pictures on the ground for a long time and a satisfied solution came out finally.The blueprint had been completed, now it was time to complement it.Fortunately cultivators had better stamina than ordinary men and cultivators at building time were much more powerful.The two brothers only took one afternoon to finish all the work. In the first place Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t want Zirong to join this, but when Zirong was looking at him pitifully meaning that he wanted to join his brother, his brother couldn\u2019t say no to him.But afterwards he thought that it showed a good relationship if two brothers worked together. Why should he insist on working alone and letting his little brother get rest?After the hut had been built, Xu Zirong was responsible for cleaning the hut and Xu Ziyan was responsible for building a fire and making foods. Even though they had taken Bi Gu pills, the whole month without any fresh food they still felt empty in the bellies.Because they had been working the whole afternoon, Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t make any complicated food, only kneaded some dough which was cut into noodles; then he fried a basin of sauced meat. Then they had meal in the kitchen which was built just now. They hold their bowls eating happily\u2026Originally Xu Zirong did not attach great importance to eating, but perhaps it was because he had been with Xu Ziyan for a long time, and now he had no appetite for food, and he only liked what dishes his brother made.\u201cWow, that\u2019s really delicious! You two bad disciples! How come you didn\u2019t call your master to eat???\u201dAt the time they had almost eaten half of the noodles, the sound of powerful roar by Big Foot Luo came out of the hut suddenly.They paused for a minute then made two totally different actions.Xu Ziyan naturally stood up intending to take an empty bowl whereas Xu Zirong ladled a big spoon of noodles from the basin immediately.\u201cZirong, there are lots of noodles left.\u201d Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t know how to react. He was curious about what was going on with master and Zirong. Were they born to be opponents? Zirong was always obedient but in front of master he could be so childish\u2026\u201cBad disciple!\u201d Big Foot Luo walked inside with door being kicked, he got angry seeing the action of Xu Zirong.Xu Zirong lifted his head and took a glance at Big Foot Luo with pride of a victor. Clearly he knew that between himself and Big Foot Luo his brother would definitely choose him as an ally.Big Foot Luo saw what Xu Zirong meant and felt unpleasant in the heart: Jesus, I really wanna kick this kid! But it was too embarrassing for a Yuan Ying cultivator to bully a little kid.\u201cMater, please eat.\u201d It seemed that Xu Ziyan had sensed the displeasure in the eyes of Big Foot Luo. As a peacemaker, he hurriedly prepared a bowl of noodles put respectfully in front of Big Foot Luo.Big Foot Luo snuff heavily and took a look at Xu Ziyan which meant: I will let him go because of your respect.Xu Ziyan had to mediate between them which was an awkward experience\u2026No one was the match in the speed of eating of Big Foot Luo, the whole bowl of noodles disappeared in an instance.Looking at the empty bowl passed to him, Xu Ziyan could only weep; he prepared another bowl of noodles without any complain. He looked at the nearly empty basin and went to knead more dough voluntarily\u2026Having dined and wined to satiety, Big Foot Luo left patting his belly satisfactorily.Looking at his back Xu Ziyan wondered what was his master up to.Xu Zirong stared sullenly at the back of Big Foot Luo thinking that maybe this guy only came for free foods\u2026Soon this matter had been forgotten. Xu Ziyan got busy again.Cultivating Zang thunder, cultivating Purple Nine Changes, when he was vacant he would go visit every peak inside the sect. He had met Wei Qing whom he hadn\u2019t met for a long time.No one could ever imagine that Wei Qing didn\u2019t choose Wei Ying as his master, instead he was accepted as a disciple by Zhou Xueting. But Wei Ying didn\u2019t go back with nothing, he appreciated Lei Hu who was from the very west place. Almost everyone had got their own masters whereas Yu Hao\u2019s master was an unknown golden pill cultivator.Although when testing they were all opponents but now they had become disciples from the same sect; they should contact with each other occasionally.Xu Ziyan had an outgoing personality, he got along well with most of them; though it was not sure what the situation would be when it linked with death and life but apparently they were all very kind to each other.Of course Xu Ziyan was not supreme spiritual stone, he couldn\u2019t win everyone, so naturally there would be someone who didn\u2019t like him at all.\u201cPhew! Who do you think you are!\u201d A tall lean young man spat at the back of Xu Ziyan.He turned and talked to Hu Tianyu with flattering tone: \u201cSenior-apprentice brother Hu, this guy thought he was someone important, why doesn\u2019t he piss and have a look at himself; he\u2019s not even worthy putting your shoes on for you given his background! He said he wanted to improve our relations, I presume he just wanted to be taken under your wing.\u201dHu Tianyu didn\u2019t reply. He could be prideful given his background and gift but he was not foolish either, he could see through this low level trick of creating discord.This guy was a disciple from Hu family of non-lineal, the quality of three spiritual root of his was merely mediocre; as a family disciple of Liu Guang Sect, he was only taken by a master as a nominal disciple. Although they were all family disciples, the difference between nominal disciple and direct-line disciple was huge.To explain it straightly, this nominal disciple wasn\u2019t expected making any big contribution, they were only taken into the sect and of course they would get some lessons. But if some of them improved a lot maybe they would be promoted to direct-line disciple, whereas if they stayed the same they would be nominal disciple forever.This kind of characters, they followed him here and there only for the protection of Hu Tianyu. If Xu Ziyan got good relationships with others and intended to follow him, given the ability like that guy\u2019s he would naturally be substituted.In cultivation circles, you should have the ability even though you wanted to be a follower!Seeing Hu Tianyu didn\u2019t answer, that tall lean young man thought he had listened to what he said. He felt excited in the heart and continued his endless talking about the intention of Xu Ziyan\u2019s coming with the most malicious guess.He was getting good relationships, flattering others, even concluding discovering secrets about Hu family which was obviously nonsense. Seeing him talking bullshits Hu Tianyu felt a little helpless.His mother had warned him before he came that he must cultivate his own faction in Liu Guang Sect, or only depending on his identity of the son of the family he couldn\u2019t get recognized by other masters.Years before, when his father inherited the head of his family he had experienced lots of trials; if he wasn\u2019t strong enough, not to mention the head of the family, it would be fortunate if he could stay alive.Sighing calmly in the heart Hu Tianyu turned and left. There were so many things to worry, let\u2019s forget it and started cultivating\u2026\u201cSenior-apprentice brother Xu!\u201d On the way Xu Ziyan came back to Tian Luo Peak, the sound of an excited girl was heard behind him.Xu Ziyan\u2019s face twitched a little then turned and smiled: \u201cJunior-apprentice sister Xiahou.\u201d\u201cHa ha, congratulations for your success of building, senior-apprentice brother.\u201d Xiahou Lian smiled and said.Xu Ziyan immediately thanked back and said some courtesy words. He always felt that junior-apprentice sister Xiahou was fearsome, it was not because she would harm him, it was from some strange intuition. It seemed that she would bring much trouble for him but he couldn\u2019t ignore her because of this\u2014that was rude after all.After a casual conversation Xu Ziyan left hurriedly. He couldn\u2019t figure out why he had that kind of intuition, he just felt that if they stayed too long together something bad must happen.\u201cBig brother, you\u2019re back.\u201d Xu Zirong ran from a distance towards him then jumped into his arms.\u201cEh, are you tired after the cultivation?\u201d Xu Ziyan touched his head then.Since he noticed that Xu Zirong\u2019s hair was smoother than silk he got mad at touching his head.Touching for something or touching for nothing, if he got bored he would touch it for fun\u2026anyway if it wasn\u2019t because Xu Zirong\u2019s hair was of high quality maybe he would be bald now\u2026\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Xu Zirong smiled. He put his head on his brother\u2019s chest and took a deep breath\u2026!!!How did there come this mild smell of orchid?!!!His eyes turned into red suddenly and restored to normal when he lifted his head. He asked with a casual tone: \u201cBrother, why you have the smell of flower on your body? You like using perfume again?\u201d\u201cWhat smell?\u201d Xu Ziyan looked at Xu Zirong confusedly and snuff his own clothes hard. That was strange, there was no smell\u2026Although he didn\u2019t smell anything but Xu Zirong had confirmed then it must be true. He thought for a while and didn\u2019t think he had ever passed any place with flowers. The only possibility was when he met Xihou Lian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now their master came to get a free meal every day and he was always picky. He didn\u2019t like eating the same dish twice, fortunately, it was Big Foot Luo\u2019s duty to find food materials or Xu Ziyan would have an idea of how to find appropriate food materials.\u201cXiahou Lian\u2026\u201d Xu Zirong\u2019s eyes looked a little reddish, he murmured with the name.He could never forget Xiahou Lian! She was a cut and lovely girl who was about fifteen which was like the time of blossom. His brother was fifteen as well. It was time to get married.Getting married\u2026The red colour in Xu Zirong\u2019s eyes got darker. He couldn\u2019t bear it when he thought that Xiahou Lian might become his sister-in-law.Sister-in-law, nephew\u2026If his brother had got these relatives he might ignore his little brother. It was true that once a man got his own family, he wouldn\u2019t care about his little brother anymore who had no blood relationship with him.The red colour in his eyes got darker and darker. The energy in Xu Zirong\u2019s body soared, the colour of the surrounding grass turned into light red slowly and the colour got darker and darker which spread like a carpet with blood.Sister-in-law? Nephew?His brother belonged to him, so he didn\u2019t need anything else.It was enough that my brother had me, I could do whatever my brother wanted me to do!My brother couldn\u2019t fall in love with others, he shouldn\u2019t and it was not possible as well! He belonged to me! Only me! No one could grab him away from me!!!Xu Zirong only felt that everything in front of him was red, his nose was full of the taste of blood. He felt the taste of blood in his mouth.He couldn\u2019t help thinking that maybe his brother wouldn\u2019t be grabbed if he ate him up now.\u201cZirong, what are you doing outside? Come here and give me a hand!\u201d Xu Ziyan called in the hut.\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d Xu Zirong even didn\u2019t notice that the red colour in his eyes had vanished, he only responded spontaneously.The dim yellow light from the hut was not bright but warm.Xu Zirong smiled lightly. He was craving for a warm relationship which he couldn\u2019t get in the previous life, he had got one now, how could he bear it being grabbed by others?\u201cI\u2019m crazy.\u201d He laughed at himself and tidied himself up, then he went to the kitchen with ease. Just at the moment before, he suddenly remembered that Xu Ziyan had a crush with Bai Hua in the previous life and Bai Hua was a male.He had no idea if his brother still liked male now, but it didn\u2019t matter. Even though his brother didn\u2019t like a male he would make him like it.Eh\u2026that was not correct, it should be that no matter if my brother liked male, he had to like me.Recalling when he was trapped in the Kun Shen Light \u201cappreciating\u201d those nasty scenes he suddenly felt that if the two irrelevant people were removed and were replaced by himself and his brother, he wouldn\u2019t feel gross at all, on the contrary, he felt very harmonious.That was the case, if my brother ever needed someone to love then I could be the one to be responsible for it.Xu Zirong had made up his mind. At this moment, the pain of the soul which was tortured in the previous life seemed lighter now. He couldn\u2019t help sighing in the heart: although those four scums boldly showed kinds of X-rated scenes in front of his soul then but he didn\u2019t watch it because of repulsion; now he regrets it. At least he could learn the methods to make his brother happy\u2026Thinking of this he looked down at his body below\u2014alright, he had thought too far\u2026 at least from now on he had to improve as fast as he could, only in this way could he solve problems with the fastest speed once his brother or anyone else had this kind of thoughts.After Xu Zirong had gone into the kitchen a figure flashed from where he was before.Big Foot Luo was still sloppy but the look on his face was cold. He lowered himself and grabbed a straw of withered light red grass.The essence of the grass was absorbed by the blood and the red colour turned lighter and lighter for the sake of the blood owner\u2019s support with his spiritual energy.Big Foot Luo frowned with his sword-like eyebrows, he put energy in his finger then the straw of grass vanished.He stared at the yellow light came from the little hut seriously, the expression on his face was beyond description\u2026That night Xu Ziyan received a message rune telling him that his master couldn\u2019t come to the dinner because of some matters.Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t think too much he only cut back on the quantity of the meal to half. After they had finished their dinner, they went into their own quiet rooms to start cultivation.There was no short-cut for cultivation, although the life span of a cultivator was longer, it took the same efforts to promote.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 64": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019ve Led the Villain Astray, How Do I Fix It?chapter 63.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNow it took Xu Ziyan three days every cultivation, if he chose to start extensive cultivation, it took at least half a month.A few months had passed soon and it was almost the time of opening a green spiritual area.After receiving the message rune sent by the sect, Xu brothers went out of the quiet room for extensive cultivation.One month before the area was opened the green spiritual print would react and this was the best time to merge with the green spiritual print.Xu Ziyan\u2019s green spiritual print was a blue fruit, only when he had eaten it did he realize that it contained amazing thunder spiritual energy.This piece of fruit was juicy, the energy inside burst out and rushed into his dantian with formidable force.It was a shame that although the energy was strong it was obviously weaker than the green spiritual thunder which had occupied his dantian.As soon as the spiritual energy entered into dantian, the green spiritual thunder rushed to it like a shark who had smelled blood. The green thunder wrapped up the massive thunder energy and ate it up easily.The spiritual energy became more docile after being eaten up by the green spiritual energy. It was like the spiritual energy cultivated by Xu Ziyan merged into his body obediently.Xu Ziyan looked expressionless. Since the last time he finished building he had found his dantian was very special. He had known well about the situation after a long time trying.The dantian which was assimilated by green spiritual thunder could absorb any kind of spiritual energy. As long as the spiritual energy didn\u2019t exceed the sum of spiritual energy inside his dantian, in the help of green spiritual thunder he could devour the energy completely and used it as his own.It was a total surprise because it meant that he could almost absorb all the energy in it without any remainder after he had taken spiritual pills.Generally speaking, a cultivator could only absorb seventy percent energy after taking pills providing one started cultivating immediately after taking pills. If one supplemented energy while he was fighting, the effect of the pill could be half percent to the limit.Whereas the strange dantian inside Xu Ziyan could devour the whole energy in pills and without any other control the green spiritual thunder would complete the process spontaneously.The process of merging green spiritual print was very easy with the help of green spiritual thunder. Xu Ziyan only took two hours to finish it.The green spiritual print of Xu Zirong was straw of red grass, he only took a short time to finish merging.The two brothers rushed to the assembly place after receiving the message rune sent from the sect. It was a golden pill period uncle master who led them to the green spiritual area. Because the place of opening the green spiritual area was different every year, only the man who had merged green spiritual print could sense it.No one could assure if the entrance of the green spiritual area would hide in some dangerous place because, except those cultivators who had obtained the green spiritual print by chance and merged successfully, the other cultivators from sects would basically be led by experts who could secure them.Those who were sent to the green spiritual area were all elites from each sect if they died in the green spiritual area unfortunately, it was only because of their unlucky fate. But if they died on the way, these masters of them would be devastated.\u201cWell, so many familiar figures.\u201d In the distance, many cultivators were standing there on the square. Xu Ziyan saw many familiar figures.Except for Wei Qing who got the green spiritual print because he was a family disciple, Lei Hu and Xiahou Lian were also in the squad. He didn\u2019t know most of these people except them, but there was one who could be called his acquaintance.\u201cSenior-apprentice brother Qilian, long time no see.\u201d Xu Ziyan smiled and said hello when he saw Qilian Hongyun.\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Qilian Hongyun was surprised to see him here but he thought for a while, it was normal that a man who had that ability could acquire the green spiritual print.\u201cDon\u2019t you ever want to see me?\u201d Xu Ziyan said curiously. He wasn\u2019t sure if he had done something wrong to this Qilian brother, why did he show that kind of expression?\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Qilian Hongyun made a smile. What could he say? Should he say that the two brothers were a disaster to him? The big brother made him cultivate in Cultivating Hall for a year for punishment and the little brother defeated him easily and hanged him up in front of other apprentices which made him so embarrassed. Should he say these?Qilian Hongyun realized now that these two guys were his disaster! As long as he met them there couldn\u2019t happen anything good!Xu Zirong had a relatively good impression about Qilian senior-apprentice brother but he hadn\u2019t seen him for a year; he thought he was doing some mission at the beginning but then he heard that he was cultivating hard in Cultivating Hall the whole year.Xu Ziyan praised him in the heart. A place like Cultivating Hall, he couldn\u2019t stand staying there for half a year if it was not for the sake of stealing the green spiritual thunder and this senior-apprentice brother stayed there for a whole year, that was really impressive.\u201cQilian, what are you doing?\u201d A gorgeous young lady came slowly. When she saw the Xu brothers her eyes turned angry imperceptibly.\u201cAh, Xueyan, were you looking for me? I was looking for you as well. Let\u2019s go there to talk.\u201d The words hadn\u2019t finished Qilian grabbed Xueyan and left hurriedly leaving a handsome back to brother Xu Ziyan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the time of the assessment, these senior-apprentice brothers were all wearing masks. How could he recognize that it was the person, the black-robed man, who was fell on the tree and then threw down?Xu Zirong said that he did not know who he was, and how he might offend him.Xu Ziyan snorted. He did not remember that he had offended this senior-apprentice brother. The only possibility is that he met him during the Inner-sect examination. But he remembered that the one he had attacked by the river should be a senior-apprentice sister\u2026Right?Forget it, no matter what. Since this senior-apprentice brother dislikes me, just stay away from him. There is no need to be disgusted.\u201cXu Ziyan.\u201d Lei Hu strode over after he saw Xu Ziyan.He has no friends in the Liu Guang Sect because he always been silent. Perhaps because his northwest barbarian\u2019s identity is quite special, coupled with that his looks and dresses are barbarians, which makes him a bit out of place in the Liu Guang Sect.\u201cHey, Lei Hu, I haven\u2019t seen you for a long time.\u201d Xu Ziyan and Lei Hu have a good relationship. Although Lei Hu does not like to talk, Xu Ziyan knows that he is the person like taking action directly rather than expressing in words.Being friends with such people is a very pleasant thing.Lei Hu nodded silently. He really implemented the four words of cherished words like gold. Of course, it may be because he is not very skilled in the language of the Central Plains\u2026Xu Zirong stood quietly behind Xu Ziyan, and there was no expression on his face.Most of the time, he will maintain this attitude for people outside his brother. Lei Hu does not care, just nodded to him, too.Xu Zirong silently clenched his fist. He didn\u2019t like Lei Hu, who looked foolish and silly, but was not stupid at all. And it is strange that he was inexplicably congenial to his brother, and even became a good friend with his brother.Xu Zirong has restrained himself. Of course, he wants to monopolize his brother, and even hides him that nobody can see him. While he also knows that he can\u2019t do this at all.Since he can\u2019t do it, he can only be patient. Fortunately, he is always in the most important position in his brother\u2019s heart, and because of this, he can barely tolerate these people stand by his brother.\u201cTogether?\u201d Lei Hu asked Xu Ziyan.Xu Ziyan thought for a moment, nodded and agreed.Since everyone is in the same sect, it is safer to gather together. Although the Qingling mystic territory is safer than the outside world, it is relatively speaking. Just as, in the Liu Guang Sect, there is no danger in most places, but places like the Scripture Library, the Treasure House and even the Kylin Tower are full of danger.\u201cZiyan.\u201d Wei Qing looked arrogantly and came over with a little bit dissatisfied with Xu Ziyan.As the friend recognized by him, Xu Ziyan did not take the initiative to approach him but was so close to the barbarian. It was too much.Every time Xu Ziyan saw Wei Qing\u2019s arrogant attitude, he felt speechless. How did the wild kid be educated? That kind of arrogant deserved a spanking\u2026If Wei Qing is his own brother, he has already held him to account. As he is so rude to people, he could be beaten badly.At this time, Xu Ziyan selectively ignored that he is actually one year younger than Wei Qing in the present body\u2026Wei Qing did not speak after coming over, just looked at Lei Hu with the look like looking at the ants..Lei Hu frowned. His master Wei Ying is also a family number of Wei, but although the master is also a character principal, but has arrogant capital. But what\u2019s wrong with this kid? The eye that he looks down on me. Does he want to fight?\u201cHum!\u201d Wei Qing snorted and shifted his gaze from Lei Hu to Xu Ziyan.He didn\u2019t take Lei Hu seriously at all. What kind of ability can such a barbaric man from the northwest have? He was able to be a brother with Xu Ziyan, which is overreached himself.Wei Qing was very dissatisfied with Xu Ziyan made a friend with such a person.In his view, Xu Ziyan\u2019s strength is similar to his, so that he should at least choose the friend who can barely catch up with him. Even if someone wants to follow him, they can\u2019t accept it at will. Especially this kind of northwestern barbarians who have almost no spiritual root in them, how can there be a great development in the future!Wei Qing looked at Lei Hu in disgust, even his clothes were hated. Although the Liu Guang Sect is like a spring in all seasons, Lei Hu has maintained the habit of wearing animal skins in the northwest.If he just wears a leather jacket, he can forget it. But he even shows his breasts. It is so brazen!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The northwest barbarians are good militants, otherwise, they will not become the main force against the demon cultivator.If they could keep silence when they were looked by such people, they will not be called barbarians.Wei Qing\u2019s brow tipped slightly and Squinting at Lei Hu with a disdainful expression. Fighting with others is insulting to his identity.Lei Hu frowned slightly and raised his hand to give him a punch.Wei Qing didn\u2019t expect the other party to fight immediately. It was too late to prevent it. He could only be laid a thin shield with spiritual energy.With a slamming sound, the Shield was broken by Lei Hu\u2019s fist. The big fist slammed into Wei Qing\u2019s eyes, leaving a huge black eye.The entire square was quiet for a moment, and everyone was concentrated on Wei Qing.With a dark eye, the face of Wei Qing was distorted. He did not notice at that moment and was attacked by the barbarian, which was a shameful shame!!He cast a spell on his hand, and a dark red fire dragon rushed toward Lei Hu. Lei Hu looks the same, drew a machete from behind, and run the spiritual energy in his body, and slashes toward the fire dragon.The fight of them made the disciples around them exclaimed. It is forbidden to fight privately with the same-sect within the Liu Guang Sect. Are these two people crazy? Fight with each other even in the presence of so many people.Xu Ziyan looked at two men who were fighting and suddenly worried.Seeing that the leader cultivator is coming. If they are found to fight privately, they certainly have no good results.\u201cThe two fools!\u201d Xu Ziyan snorted and quickly pulled out the longbow and shot a Thunderbolt arrow. The place he shot was exactly the point that the two spells were about to touch. This thunderstorm blew up, not only destroyed the fire dragon released by Wei Qing, but the erupted wave almost overturned Lei Hu.\u201cYou two! Stop!\u201d Xu Ziyan rushed over to them and knocked hard on their heads one by one.These two little kids, it\u2019s really unreasonable!Xu Ziyan thought with annoy. Then roared them at the same time and said: \u201cIt is forbidden to fight privately with the inner-sect disciple. You two are living too well, and want to feel the feeling of being punished!\u201dWei Qing was wearing a dark circle and glaring at Lei Hu. If it weren\u2019t him to start first, how could he make a move?Lei Hu\u2019s appearance was also very miserable. After all, he used weapons to resist Wei Qing\u2019s spells. And his cultivating is not as good as Wei Qing. Just if the fire dragon did not interfere with Xu Ziyan, it would be more than burning some of his hair and eyebrows.Two embarrassed people glared at each other. Xu Ziyan had a terrible headache. Originally thought that Lei Hu is a sensible child. The result is he is also a wild kid.Did he cross the world to make these wild kids? !\u201cBrother, don\u2019t be angry.\u201d Xu Zirong pulled the sleeves of Xu Ziyan and said softly.Just saw Lei Hu fight with Wei Qing, he is very happy. Because the two guys are sharing his brother\u2019s attention without exception. For him, they are both enemies.He is naturally very happy about two enemies fighting. In fact, if they can die together, it would be better.It is a pity that the original good mood disappeared completely when he saw Xu Ziyan\u2019s shot to stop them.He was slightly gazing and estimated in his heart whether the two people\u2019s status in the heart of his brother had improved. If their threat is too big, he does not mind secretly destroying both of them.Anyway, there are so many accidents in the realm of cultivating. It is very common to fall down one or two cultivators in the foundation state.Seeing brother frowning for them, Xu Zirong\u2019s mood is even more uncomfortable. Fortunately, he can analyze from Xu Ziyan\u2019s expression that he is also very unhappy at the moment. He performed himself immediately.Hearing Xu Zirong softly comforted him, Xu Ziyan\u2019s heart was so refreshing. Sure enough, Wei Qing and Lei Hu are so wild, definitely because they don\u2019t have such a good brother like mine!!Xu Ziyan\u2019s proud eyes were seen by Xu Zirong, and he flashed a touch of joy in his sigh. He softly comforted: \u201cBrother, they are willing to fight and let them fight. Anyway, there will be a senior-apprentice uncle who is the team leader coming soon, seeing them fighting so badly, and maybe they would be forbidden to go to the Qingling secret, and it would be a lesson to both of them.\u201dLei Hu and Wei Qing heard the words suddenly. The opportunity to go to Qingling\u2019s secret place must not be missed. Now they don\u2019t know who is the senior-apprentice uncle to lead the team. If it is really an old-fashioned senior-apprentice uncle, maybe they can really be deprived of the opportunity to go to the Qingling secret because of the fight.After looking at each other and exchanging an angry look, the two men agreed to take over and start to take care of themselves and try to clean themselves before the leader senior-apprentice uncle arrival.Xu Ziyan saw that the two men were no longer stared at each other, finally relieved. Although both of them are wild kids, they are not as thorough as wild.He has heard about how rare the opportunity to go to the Qingling secret world from his master is. If they really missed it because of this, it is a pity.Fortunately, before the arrival of the leader senior-apprentice uncle, the two finally finished cleaning themselves up. The black circles of Wei Qing were soon disappeared after he applied a layer of ointment. And Lei Hu also cut off the hair that was scorched on his head, leaving only a thin layer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one would report this incident so much. They were offending these disciples meant offending the master behind them.Waiting for a while, there was a medium-sized monk came with his sword. When he saw the people here, he threw a cloud boat.The white cloud boat was greatly enlarged by the driving of Magic formula, and the white cloud of auspicious clouds floated under the cloud boat, and the light boat held the cloud boat slightly.This type of flying instrument had always been a must-have magic weapon for the far-away, and all the disciples were familiar with it, and they had boarded the cloud boat.\u201cQi Lian, come over.\u201d The male monk seemed to know Qi Lian Hongyun and called him in the past after he got on the boat.\u201cQi Xuan uncle.\u201d Qi Lian Hongyun smiled and made a greeting.Qi Xuan did not feel angry and looked like a good temper. He took out a transparent ball of light and handed it to Qi Lian Hongyun. \u201cHold, enter the spiritual power.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Qi Lian Hongyun obeyed the light ball and then entered his own spiritual power.The light in the ball gradually faded away, and a cyan pointer emerges. The pointer was rotated a few times and then fixed in one direction.When Qi Xuan saw it, he controlled the cloud boat and flew up, and flew in that direction.\u201cXue Yan, Sima Hui, you were coming.\u201d After setting the direction of the cloud boat, Qi Xuan called the beautiful girl and a tall and strong man. Told them that when Qi Lian\u2019s spiritual power was insufficient, they would take over.This pursuit of the ball did not require too much spiritual energy, and the three of them would be able to easily support this journey.The character of the Qi Xuan uncle was very harmonious. Apart from Qi Lian, the senior-apprentice brothers and sisters seemed to be familiar with him.Only the younger junior-apprentice brothers who were new to them were not familiar with him. Therefore, after he introduced himself, they did not immediately rush.Although Wei Qing and Lei Hu did not fight again, they still roared at each other.Xu Ziyan saw that the two cockfighting did not mean to fight, and he went with them.In his opinion, it\u2019s all boys. When they played, they would have a feeling. if they didn\u2019t play, they didn\u2019t know each other.Because there were men here, and Xiahou Lian and Wei Qing were still not able to deal with, so she had been staying there with a handsome senior-apprentice sister.Xu Zirong was just behind the tail of Xu Ziyan like a tail. Occasionally, the senior-apprentice brothers and sisters tried to tease this delicate child, and they all got only a cold look\u2026(Senior-apprentice brothers and sisters: Hey, this little junior-apprentice brother was too cute!!!)A group of people did not spend too much time on the road.About seven days or so, in the search for the ball in the hands of the tall and strong man named Sima Hui, the light began to appear.\u201cCome on.\u201d Qi Xuan\u2019s master\u2019s brother raised his hand and stopped the cloud boat, looking down at the environment below.Below was a blue lake, and there was a small island to the west of their reluctance.Qi Xuan controlled the cloud boat to fall. Before he arrived, he heard a burst of laughter: \u201cI didn\u2019t know which elders of the streamer ancestors arrived? I\u2019m Qi Wanhui of the Jiu Xiang Pavilion, It was polite to see you .\u201d\u201cIt turned out to be the real person of Jiu Xiang Pavilion, and Qi Xuan was polite to see you.\u201d Qi Xuan said.\u201cOh, Qi Xuan mysterious real people were polite.\u201d A glamorous woman wore a yellow gauze came to the sword and smiled at the bow of the cloud boat and Qi Xuan greeted.Jiu Xiang Pavilion was a middle-class sect, and all the disciples under the sect were women.Although this sect was inconspicuous in all respects, no one had ever overlooked this sect.There was no reason for it. The so-called sorrowful lady, the gentleman liked, the female disciples of Jiu Xiang Pavilion were all young and beautiful, and they had a marriage with many martial arts. Perhaps their fighting power was not outstanding, but because of these marriages. The existence of the relationship, if this sect was difficult, there would be many martial arts to lend a helping hand.Qi Xuan was also very polite to the real person of Jiu Xiang Pavilion. After all, some monks of the Liu Guang sect also became a Taoist with the women of Jiu Xiang Pavilion. It can be said that in this Xuan Yu region, almost every sects had a marriage relationship with Jiu Xiang Pavilion.The two-person had a lot of guests, and Qi Xuan did not refuse to invite the real people to invite them to camp together. In his view, after entering the Qing Ling mystery, if the two factions acted together, the safety factor could be increased.Besides, the disciples he brought out on this trip were the elites in the sect. It was inevitable that he could see the Jiu Xiang Pavilion. The combination of the elites of the two sides seemed to be very popular among the high-level members.After all, marrying a woman to marry a woman, if the elite of Jiu Xiang Pavilion was married to the Liu Guang sect, then it would become the elite of the Liu Guang Sect.At the time of Qi Xuan talking to the Qi real person, the cloud boat had fallen on the island.The Qi immortal raised his hand and played a magic formula, and a few red lights in the air flashed away.He said, \u201cWhen we first arrived here, we did a little protection. I would give you the magic formula in a while. In fact, this protection had no lethality. mainly to remind the disciples of the guards, someone came in.Qi Xuan\u2019s real person nodded. If he first came here, he would definitely do the same thing. The so-called anti-human heart was indispensable. If someone really touched the island and killed one or two disciples, then they were really no face to see people.After the cloud boat landed, Qi Xuan real people took it up.The Qi immortal led the way ahead and soon entered a temporary camp.There were several tents in the camp, and a few pretty girls were talking about something.\u201cMaster.\u201d A red girl who was headed by the girl saw that the real person was back, and quickly took the other person to come over.\u201cThese were the friends of the Liu Guang Sect. After two days, they would enter the Qing Ling mystery with you. You would be familiar with each other first. After entering the secret environment, you could also take care of each other.\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201d The red girl said with a compliment.Qi Xuan also confessed to these people with Liu Guang sect, and then followed the story of the Qi real person looking for a place to go.As the leader of this trip, the only task was to ensure the safety of these disciples. As for the communication between disciples, it was not within their jurisdiction.The red-haired girl headed by the girl was about sixteen or seventeen years old. She said hello: \u201cI had seen several brothers of Liu Guang sect.\u201d After that, she turned her eyes to Qi Lian HongYun: \u201cQian Lian senior-apprentice brother, long time no see\u201dQi Lian HongYun smiled and arched her, and she looked familiar with her.The two sides, led by the red girl and Qi Lian HongYun, introduced themselves separately, and the disciples on both sides also met each other and quickly became familiar with each other.Xu Ziyan was very good at hiding behind the senior-apprentice brothers and sisters, as low-key as possible.This was not because he has any special hobbies, but he did not know whether there were any famous female devils among the female disciples of Jiu Xiang Pavilion.Shortly after Xu Ziyan and Bai Hua hooked together, there was a powerful devil in the Xuan Yu region. This female devil had strong strength and specializes in the technique of picked up Yang and replenished Yin, None of the monks who had been recruited by her were not turned into a corpse, not only was it repaired, but even the flesh and blood essence of the whole body was sucked away.It was said that the female devil was once a disciple of Jiu Xiang Pavilion, and also found an evil practice in the forbidden land of Jiu Xiang Pavilion.By virtue of the practice, this female devil killed a myriad of monks and even interrupted the start of the white birch. At that time, Bai Hua was left because of his temper and his body, and went to find Lin Xiaotian. As a result, he was blocked by the female devil in the middle of the road.Later, perhaps the male aura of Bai Hua played a role. When the female practitioner tried to absorb the skill of the white birch, the evil skill suddenly went wrong. Instead of sucking away the skill of the white birch, she gave back all her cultivation. Bai Hua, let his strength breakthrough in a moment, directly from the late stage of the vein to the JinDan period.The female devil who had not been repaired was easily killed by the white birch, and the original body that did not arrive in time was only a dead body.It was a bit difficult to recognize this person with a dry corpse, and Xu Ziyan did not dare to guarantee that at this moment the female practitioner had begun to cultivate this evil.Therefore, for these female disciples of Jiu Xiang Pavilion, he had to think as far as possible, Just in case, the female devil was a bloody hurricane that caused a long time, who knew if she was already starting to make an idea and looking for the victim?Several junior-apprentice brothers of Liu Guang sect intended to talk to the female practitioners, but several senior-apprentice sisters did not have this nature but found a clean open space, set down and meditated.Xu Ziyan looked around and saw that the senior-apprentice brothers and sisters had found things to do, and now only four of them were standing here.Xu Ziyan did not intend to be too close to those women, Xu Zirong would only be secretly happy, of course, it was impossible to persuade him to pass.Wei Qing and Lei Hu finally lost the arrogant driving of the previous two days, and now they only used the hidden eyes to kill each other.Perhaps it was because both of them were focused on each other\u2019s attention, so they didn\u2019t pay much attention to which female repairs. When Xu Ziyan thought about it, he simply took the two of them to find a piece of open space and first lifted the tent.The tents they prepared were all distributed by the streamer, which was a kind of implement. As long as a piece of the next stone was embedded, it was easy to support a tent.The tent was used in a similar way to the universe bag. The space was huge enough for ten people to move around and there was more than enough.Originally, this tent was distributed by each person, but Xu Zirong would naturally not be separated from his brother, so he followed up with confidence.As for Lei hu and Wei Qing, the two of them would of course not be crowded with the Xu family. After they screamed at each other and set up their tents in the left and right of Xu\u2019s tent.They waited for seven days in the camp. During this period, several squadrons arrived here. The disciples brought by those sects were more or less, more than the Liu Guang Sect, about a dozen, and only one less.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even the sects of hostile relations were very restrained.It seemed that no one wanted to cause trouble at this time. After all, The secret realm of Qingling was floating in the void. It was only through the induction of Qingling Yin that a channel could be opened between this kind of induction and the Xuanyu region.This channel was extremely unstable. If the channel couldn\u2019t be opened because of their fighting between each other, then the parties to the fight would definitely be dealt with by everyone else.On the morning of the seventh day, at the moment when the sun rose, a wave of water waved began to form in a place not far from the island.It seemed as if a drop of water had entered a calm sleep, and in the midair above the lake, a slow-distributing ripple had begun to form.\u201cGo!\u201d The Qi Xuan immortal shouted, and the sword began to rise. All the disciples of the LiuGuang sect also flew past.\u201cThis Qi Xuan immortal was really an impatient personality.\u201d The Qi immortal grinned and said: \u201cLet\u2019s Go!\u201d after that, the same sword flew past.The six disciples of JiuXiang Pavilion followed behind the real person, and after a short flight, stayed in front of the ripples of the water ripples.Various other factions had also flown here, waiting quietly for the opening of the passage.After a while, the fluctuations of the water ripple began to intensify, and soon a swirling passage was formed.\u201cGo in, remember, you only had one month, more than a month, The secret realm of Qingling would once again enter the void, if you couldn\u2019t come out, you would be in trouble.\u201d Qi Xuan Uncle master shouted to everyone.The disciples nodded, and they were ready to enter the secret realm of Qingling. The notes mentioned by Qi Xuan Uncle master had been repeated many times by their masters. They would never make fun of their own lives.The disciples of Liu Guang sect stood at the head of the vortex, and the disciples of other sects did not object. Every time the location of the secret realm of Qingling was different, and the location of each entrance after entering the secret realm of Qingling was very different.No one knew what the law of this passage was. It was very likely that the time when the two entered the passage was only a short distance, but the place where they could fall into the secret realm of Qingling was thousands of miles away.Moreover, in the secret realm of Qingling, except for some secrets involving blood or soul, most of the communication symbols were unusable. If they did not fall into the same place when entering, basically there was no chance to meet before they come out.Xu Zirong naturally would not allow such a thing to happen, so he did not hesitate to hold Xu Ziyan\u2019s wrist.Fortunately, he was only an eleven-year-old child, this kind of action was not abrupt, and otherwise, it would inevitably attract the attention of others.\u201cYou would keep up with me for a while, didn\u2019t let go, you know?\u201d Xu Ziyan was also afraid that his brother would be single. After all, he was only an eleven-year-old child (not!), spending alone for a month in an empty secret. The loneliness of loneliness was hard to marry.Xu Zirong nodded silently and held his hand tighter.Xu Ziyan encouraged him to pull back and told him not to be so nervous.Xu Ziyan\u2019s hand was very big because the bow was held all the year round, the palm had a thin layer of old cockroaches, and the rough touch rubs against the delicate skin. Xu Zirong suddenly felt like a kitten caught in his heart.Just when Xu Zirong suddenly touched, it happened to be their turn into the passage.Not waiting for Xu Zirong to open, Xu Ziyan took him, and the two entered the whirlpool at the same time.At the moment of entering the whirlpool, Xu Ziyan only felt the heart jerk. It seemed that something had been integrated into his body, but after he looked inside again, he did not notice any abnormality.After Xu Ziyan entered the passage, he saw that the vortex suddenly trembled; the speed of the rotation increased, and then slowed down.\u201cWhat was going on?\u201d Qi Xuan was shocked. Only the elite disciples of their LiuGuang sect all entered the passage. If this passage changed, the disciples there\u2026\u201cQi Xuan, Didn\u2019t were in a hurry, just space here had been shaking.\u201d A thin old man smiled. He was an elder of the TianYu sect and was very proficient in space spells, so he was very sensitive to the fluctuations of space.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Qi Xuan was not good at space magic and asked without hesitation.The old man who feels was not angry. After all, the elites who had just entered were the elites of Liu Guang sect. It was also excusable that Qi Xuan was so anxious.He closed his eyes and felt it again, then nodded: \u201cIt\u2019s just a small accident, no problem!\u201d After that, he arranged that Tian Yu sect\u2019s disciples also entered the passage in order.Seeing the situation, the Qi Xuan mysterious calculations were completely relieved. If this Li was not sure, he would never dare to let the elite disciples of Tian Yu sect took risks.This secret realm of Qingling was very weird, and only the monks below the foundation could safely pass this passage. If there was a monk who was higher than the foundation, then the passage may even be collapsed.This was the inference of many sects in the Xuan Yu domain combined with the experience of the past. Therefore, among the disciples of this group, the highest one was the late stage of the foundation.Seeing that all the disciples of the martial art had entered the passage, the masters had tacitly arranged a large array around the vortex. Several of them were divided into two batches of turns to guard the entrance of the passage to prevent accidental damaged to the passage.Just as Xu Ziyan entered the secret realm of Qingling through the passage, in a dense forest, a handsome young boy was hiding in a dry tree hole, holding a jade-like fruit in his hand. The eyes were full of ecstasy.\u201cQing Ling cited\u2026\u201d The boy whispered, and his eyes flashed a slap in the face. He must not be the Ding furnace of the old man. He still had a good time to spend, how could he be willing to be ruined by such an old man.\u201cDeath was dead!\u201d The boy went out and swallowed the fruit.The fruit\u2019s entrance was instant, and a sweet taste flowed into his throat, warming his empty stomach.Ever since he discovered the true face of the master who looked like \u2018kind\u2019, the teenager took the opportunity to squander another apprentice and stole the baby of the old man \u2013 this fruit.He just faintly knew that this fruit seemed to be the key to a secret, but in detail, he was not clear.But in any case, the old man cared for his eyes in this fruit. He only knew that this was the treasure that even the old man must cherish.After serving under the service, the teenager only felt that the whole body was warm. He only had three layers of refining. In fact, if he was not too low, he might have been recruited by the old man.The boy, named Bai Hua, was born in a poor family. Later, in order to treat his father, his father sold him to a brothel when he was very young. He lived in a brothel for a few years and learned a lot of ways to serve people. He thought that this life would be like this, but did not expect, but when he first picked up at the age of twelve, he met his senior-apprentice brother.After seeing him, his senior-apprentice brother told him that he had a spiritual root, could practice, and even became a fairy.A 12-year-old child who lived in a brothel for many years was quickly impressed by the kind of fairy life described by his senior-apprentice brother. He left the senior-apprentice brothers without hesitation and then went under the door of his master.At first, the master seemed to be very invisible to his disciples. After a few words in the senior-apprentice brother and the master, he easily discovered the greed in the eyes of the master.For the kind of eyes of the master, he was very disgusted, but in order to change his destiny, he resisted that kind of disgust and stayed with the master. Fortunately, the master did not make any moves except for what kind of disgusting eyes he used. Instead, his other younger senior-apprentice brothers seemed to be always on the bed with the master.A few days ago, his brother suddenly came to the door and took him to a hidden secret room. He saw with his own eyes how the master had made a young man a man, and he remembered the younger senior-apprentice brother. Because of the ordinary appearance, there was no chance to wait for a bed, but he didn\u2019t know why, but today they suddenly heard the order to let him sleep.Frightened and covered his mouth, Bai Hua was tightly held in his arms by his brother. He whispered behind him: \u201cjunior-apprentice brother, now you know where the senior-apprentice brothers who were doing the task were going.\u201dBai Hua nodded with fear. From the secret room, he could clearly see that the younger brother\u2019s eyes were not eye-catching. He had just reached the refinement of the refining a few days ago. It was originally expected to build the foundation, but now he changed to a corpse.His senior-apprentice brothers and glared at his waist and rubbed back and forth: \u201cbrother, you know, you were a good temperament, the reason why the master had not let you sleep, did not pick you up, not because of pity you, But because you were not successful, the effect of the harvest was not good, but now you were sixteen years old, you know, what does this mean?\u201dWhite birch nodded, even if he didn\u2019t understand it former, he understood it now. He was like dead poultry, and now he was finally fattening, and naturally, he can be put on the table.His junior-apprentice brother kissed his earlobe and whispered in his ear: \u201cTeacher, did you know why I want you to see this scene? It was because I didn\u2019t want you to be inexplicably turned into a corpse. Brother, I like you.\u201dWhite birch looked at his senior-apprentice brother confusingly. At that time his head was like a paste. The fierce fear had made him unable to think; even his senior-apprentice brother said nothing.\u201cBrother, I would save you\u2026\u201dWhat the senior-apprentice brothers did next made him feel very comfortable. He didn\u2019t know if this was his physique, but he did not feel any pain, only comfortable.What happened later became a matter of course. His senior-apprentice brother did not lie to him. Instead, he recommended another younger junior-apprentice brother to his master. By enjoying the opportunity of the younger junior-apprentice brother, he ran quietly.Perhaps the only thing that the brother did not expect was that his courage was so big. He dared to steal the master\u2019s baby before he fled. But the master prepared for his favorite disciple, and the disciple was naturally his. Brother.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was only an exchange with the brother to do that kind of thing. Didn\u2019t think that he didn\u2019t know. Since his Yuanyang was useful to the master, he would certainly had the same effect for the junior-apprentice brother. He took this fruit and exchanged it with him.After Bai hua took the fruit, he felt warm and full of body. After a few days of escape, it was barely a safe place.Because he didn\u2019t know what would happen after eating fruit, he could only find a place that was as safe as possible.The warmth of the body quickly became roast, and the powerful energy contained in fruit continued to swim in him.His small poor cinnabar began to expand and shrink, and there were obvious signs of breakthrough.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Bai Hua couldn\u2019t stop moaning in pain.He did not know that this fruit would have so much power.Three layers of refining, with such a repair, taking fruit was simply looking for death, If there was no accident, soon the fruit\u2019s energy would break through his cinnabar, and then let him burst and die.The expression of the white birch became distorted, and the blue veins on the forehead were also highlighted. His skin became red and hot, and the blood vessels under the skin continued to jump, as if swimming a small snake.\u201cWas I going to\u2026 die?\u201d Bai hua was covered with sweat on his forehead. He half-squinted and looked at a small sky outside the tree hole.He was not willingly, obviously he was not a spiritual root? Obviously he should have become a fairy, wasn\u2019t it? Why was he dying in such a place?God was too unfair!He did not want to die! He didn\u2019t want to die at all!In order to survive, he could give everything! He wanted to live very well. He wanted to be a man. He would never die in this dry tree hole. The dead body would become the food of those beasts!Just as that Bai hua madly wanted to find a trace of life, a dragon-shaped jade hanging on his neck suddenly burst into a glare.The ray instantly covered his whole body, and soon, the feeling of being about to burst was suppressed.Under the glory of jade pendant, his spiritual power was compressed back to cinnabar, forming a golden mist. The light of jade pendant did not completely impede this group of aura, but instead a small mouth, let these aura had limit flows out.Without the aura of swarming, Cinnabar of Bai hua got a chance to breathe. Because of the impact, Cinnabar obviously expanded a few points, and then nourished by the aura, it went smoothly into the fourth floor of the refining.In this way, under the protection of jade pendant\u2019s radiance, the golden mist of the group could only be slowly released and absorbed by the Cinnabar refining of the Bai hua. This pure spiritual power without any impurities not only nourished his cinnabar, but also got smoothly. Let him complete the breakthrough.Five layers of Qi refining, six layers\u2026In the process of the fall of Bai hua into a coma, his cultivation was promoted to the realm of Qi refining and suffocating under the influence of fruit.At this time, even if jade pendant no longer worked, the Bai hua would never be hurt by the remaining half of the aura, but if those auras couldn\u2019t be absorbed, they would only slowly dissipate from his body and waste.At this moment, Bai Hua made a short sigh, and woke up from a coma.After waking up, he checked his Cinnabar for the first time. He thought he was dead. He didn\u2019t expect that jade pendant, who had inadvertently got it, played such a wonderful use.It was found that the light of jade pendant was weakening, and the half of the aura was still half, and the Bai hua did not endlessly, and began to build the foundation. Instead of letting those auras escape to the heavens and the earth, it was not allowed to fight once.Perhaps his determination, or perhaps a certain aura, in short, the foundation of the Bai hua was simply unbelievable.He looked at his white and almost transparent palm, and the ecstasy in his heart could not be described in words.He took out a mirror and showed a beautiful face in the mirror.After this foundation building, He didn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the role of dragon-shaped jade, or the effect of fruit\u2019s. His appearance had changed a lot.The original youth of the young man had completely faded. Today, the first impression he gave was a refined young man.It\u2019s just that his eyes had a special charm. When he was staring at him, he would have the illusion that he was deeply loved by this person.Bai Hua was overjoyed and looked at the mirror for a long time. In addition to the surprise that his appearance brought him, he broke through to building base and made him excited.He had been very upset since seeing the old demon in the secret room and taking in the cruel picture of his senior-apprentice brother. Master\u2019s powerful strength made him jealous. Although his junior-apprentice brother said that he wanted to save him, With the strength of his junior-apprentice brother, there was no difference between the master and self-seeking dead.It was not until this time that he really realized that he was no longer a mortal. With his face, if he was in the mortal world, he might still be able to live a few years in youth, but now he was the monk, with this kind of body, was almost doomed to his tragic fate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The vortex, whether in color or shape, was exactly the same as the entrance that Xu Ziyan entered. The difference was a lot smaller.Bai hua was shocked by the sudden appearance, but before he could do anything, he was sucked into the whirlpool.Qingling imprint, Qingling induction, the difference between the words was completely different. The Qingling induction by Bai hua was more advanced than Qingling imprint, and could be directly sent to the secret realm of Qingling without going to Look for the entrance.Just as the elder of Tianyu sect appeased Qi Xuan and let Tianyu sect disciples enter the passage, Xu Ziyan and Xu Zirong appeared in a dark cave.He didn\u2019t know if they said that they were lucky or not. The fluctuation of the channel caused the position to shift. They and all the junior-apprentice brothers and sisters were separated.Because they were the last disciples of the streamer\u2019s ancestors, and after the passage of the volatility, the Qi xuan elders were delayed for a while, and as a result, Tian Yu sect\u2019s disciples also went to other places, that is, in this dark cave, Only Xu Ziyan and Xu Zirong two brothers.\u201cBrother?\u201d Xu Zirong looked at Xu Ziyan with suspicion, perhaps because he was watching Xu Ziyan anytime and anywhere, so it was easy to find the look on his brother\u2019s face was changed after entering the passage.\u201cNothing.\u201d Xu Ziyan shook his head and took out a Fluorite from the Qiankun bag.Because there were various topographical terrains in the secret realm of Qingling, although it was unexpected to enter the underground caverns, he had everything he needed to prepare, so he was not flustered.Fluorite was only the size of a fist, but the radiance was very strong enough to illuminate the surrounding environment.The cave was dim, and only the fluorescing ball exudes a few faint white light. They were in the center of a passage at this time, and there were black and white tunnels in front and behind. The pressure of pressing was very uncomfortable. Fortunately, there was no decaying smell here, and if he carefully distinguish it, he could also feel the breath of the wind.\u201cLet\u2019s go here.\u201d There were only two options, Xu Ziyan naturally walked in the direction of the wind.Xu Zirong followed closely behind him. He didn\u2019t know why, he had a very uncomfortable feeling when he entered the Qingling secret. He didn\u2019t know where this irritability came from, just an intuitive uneasiness.The two brothers walked along the tunnel all the way. The tunnel was very dry and occasionally stepped on some soft moss under the feet.Xu Ziyan went forward while checking his body. He believed that when he entered the channel, his feelings were not illusions, so there must be something that had entered his body.Through internal vision, he checked his meridians and cinnabar over and over again, but he did not find anything wrong with his whole body.The thunder of cinnabar was still swimming happily. In fact, there was such a thunder and god. If anything wanted to enter his cinnabar quietly, it was basically impossible.There was no problem with dantian and meridians, andeverything was fine.Then what was the problem?Xu Ziyan carefully analyzed that the pace at the foot slowed down unconsciously.\u201cBrother, what happened to you?\u201d Xu Zirong asked with a frown. After entering this secret, he felt that Xu Ziyan was not right, but the other party did not say that he had no choice. If it was normal, Xu Ziyan did not say, he would only use the side-clicking method to ask, after all, his image was a good-looking younger brother, so straightforward questioning, It did not conform to his image.It\u2019s just that the feeling of irritability in the heart was getting stronger and stronger, and he had a bit of impatience and unconsciously brought it out in his tone.When the words were exported, Xu Zirong was shocked. He did not expect that this kind of uneasiness caused the violent suffocation of his heart to be silent. He quickly closed his mouth and did not dare to speak.Fortunately, Xu Ziyan was paying attention to his body, and he had not heard too much about Xu Zirong.\u201cwhat did you say?\u201dXu Zirong was relieved in the heart and said softly: \u201cBrother, you become very strange after entering the passage. was there anything happening?\u201dXu Ziyan thought for a moment and thought that this kind of thing told Zirong that there was nothing. Although Zirong was only eleven years old\u2026 Oh, no, it was already twelve years old, but he was very early, if not his height be here, plus the delicate face, but still a little tender face, he probably would often mistakenly think that he was talking to an adult.Speaking out of his feelings, Xu Zirong could not help but fall into meditation.He believes that his brother must not feel wrong. After all, the keenness of the monks made them rarely make such mistakes, unless they deliberately deceived with a magical array, otherwise they could see what was wrong, and it was impossible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xu Ziyan and Xu Zirong were already cultivating in the foundation period. The simple means of using the pathfinder to explore was completely with no pressure.He walked along the side of the passage and the echoes of only two people in the empty passage were behind them.It was a pity that it was discussed for a while, and even the passage had to come to an end, but the two of them still did not find any reason.\u201cForget it; anyway, I didn\u2019t have any discomfort in my body right now, just like this.\u201d Xu Ziyan said helplessly. If he didn\u2019t forget, he couldn\u2019t dissect himself and find out the reason.Xu Zirong was still somewhat embarrassed, and any means that may harm his brother were beyond his tolerance. Even if he didn\u2019t dare to take a sip of his brother\u2019s blood, how could he tolerate an inexplicable force to invade his brother\u2019s body!Xu Zirong secretly remembered this kind of power on his small book in his heart. After he recovered his strength in the future and found out the reasons, he would definitely make the price for those who left this trap!As the wind blowing in the front became stronger, the end of the passage appeared in front of their eyes.Going out from the hole, there was a prominent platform outside. Xu Ziyan stood on the platform and started using his own knowledge to explore for a long time, but still did not explore the end below.The top of the shed was not high, could be seen by the light of the fluorescing ball, but the darkness below could engulf the radiance of the fluorescing ball, as if it was a bottomless abyss.\u201cGo down?\u201d Xu Zirong asked with a sigh of his head. One side of the platform was a downward staircase, from which he could see the traces of tangible artificial carvings.The stairs were built along the rock wall and looked from afar, seemingly spiraling down. Because the light of the fireball could not be found the opposite, Xu Ziyan did not know how long and how deep the stairs would be.The end of the stairs was hidden in the darkness, and the light of the fluorescing ball could not be so far. Xu Ziyan thought about it and raised his hand to release a thunder-sized thunder ball. The thunder ball was bombarded into the air and suddenly exploded. With this moment of light, Xu Ziyan narrowed his eyes and saw the situation here.Similar to his guess, the platform they stood on was the only place that highlighted the rock wall. Above it was the cemetery of the cemetery. Below it was the dark abyss. The only two roads were either going down or returning along the way. But since he had already entered here, how could Xu Ziyan be willing to return empty-handed?\u201cI would go first, you were behind.\u201d Xu Ziyan took the lead and walked in front of him. Xu Zirong obediently followed him. He already knew this kind of thing. He was fighting for his brother. Xu Ziyan\u2019s desire to protect him was not something he could refute.Of course, he also enjoyed this feeling of being protected, and if there was a real attack, he also had the confidence to save Xu Ziyan at a crucial moment. Of course, if the strength of the person who raided them was too high, then he would not have any effect even if he walked in front, so he would not have to worry about it.Walking down the light of the fluorescing ball, Xu Ziyan looked at the six roads and listened to all directions. The various traps in the treasure-hunting novels that he had seen before began to flashback in his mind.He didn\u2019t know if there was something similar in this secret realm of Qingling mystery, but there was no big mistake in caution. There was no harm in being cautious.The two of them walked cautiously for a long time, and there was nothing to appear at all. Xu Ziyan couldn\u2019t help but breathe a sigh of relief. He thought the master said that there was nothing dangerous here. It was really right.They didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Since entering this secret realm of Qingling, Xu Ziyan had been unable to leave the incident happening at the entrance. Didn\u2019t look at him and talked to Xu Zirong it was very easy as if they didn\u2019t care, but he didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t let it go.Obviously, there was no reason to find it, but it was surrounded by his heart. It seemed that there was a voice constantly telling him that this matter was very important to him. He must find out the energy to go out.Silently sighed, Xu Ziyan was convinced that if he could not find the place where the energy was going, he might be annoyed by his own voice.He checked his body again, without any abnormalities.Spiritual Sense of the sea: safety.Meridian: no damage.Dantain: It\u2019s a pleasure to play with the green scorpion.Emma! Where was the damn energy go?Xu Ziyan couldn\u2019t help but be a bit violent. Whatever patience was never his advantage. After looking for a long time, he had begun to feel annoyed.Fingers screamed, Xu Ziyan was now looking for someone to fight, there were no enemies around, he naturally could not play his own brother, He just went to the Leiguang to fight!Xu Ziyan immediately praised his wit!The so-called Leiguang person was the cockroach in the jade slip that he found in the Treasure House of XujiaThe cockroach was formed by Lei Guang, and it was responsible for teaching Xu Ziyan how to cultivate the sable.When Xu Ziyan began his studies, he was not shackled by him. Later, as his strength improved, the strength of others increased.OK, okay, the fact was that Xu Ziyan would be stunned by the thunder when he practices the purple scorpion, but he was very annoyed now, just wanted to fight with people, it didn\u2019t matter if he won or lost.The existence of jade slip had never been swayed by Xu Zirong, but in order to prevent the treasure from being stolen, Xu Ziyan hid it in Fang Gejun.He believed that there was no one in the world who could steal things from Fang Gejun. This golden finger, which was useless, may only have this effect.(Fang Gejun: /(\u3112o\u3112)/~~ )What!Xu Ziyan suddenly stopped. He looked at the void in front of him and couldn\u2019t help but rub his eyes.After he passed it, he looked again. Well, it\u2019s not that he got it wrong. Fang Gejun had grown bigger!In the beginning, Fang Gejun only had 50 centimeters square. Later, he vaguely felt that Fang Gejun seemed to be a little bigger, but because there was no way to measure it in detail, he had not been sure.But now, Fang Gejun had become a one-meter square, and he could see it without using it.So\u2026 the power was actually eaten by Fang Gejun? Xu Ziyan guessed the chin.\u201cBrother?\u201d Xu Zirong looked at Xu Ziyan with a puzzled look. The other party not only suddenly stopped but also dazed in the air. What did he find?\u201cAh? Ah! Nothing, let\u2019s continue.\u201d Xu Ziyan woke up and quickly went on. Fang Gejun\u2019s business had never told Xu Zirong that it was too illusory. It was estimated that even if it was the real world, there would be no Like the existence of Fang Gejun, secondly, the book inside was always a thorn in his heart. Although the developments of the original were quite different from the memories of the original, in the end, they had not touched any scene in the original text.At the beginning of this novel, it was the beginning of the birth of the Bai Hua into Tianyu sect, which became the younger junior-apprentice brother of Lin Xiaotian. Now, the assessment of Tianyuzong was still a full year, that was, during this time. He didn\u2019t know that Bai Hua was hiding in that corner. Otherwise, he must definitely take a look at it. After remembering the other person\u2019s appearance, he should avoid him in this life\u2026 No way, the protagonist aura couldn\u2019t afford it, look. The original text would be known.Since he knew where the energy was going, Xu Ziyan was relieved. The left and right squares were his golden fingers. It was estimated that Fang Ge has been hungry for so many years, so the bite that was eaten just now was a bit big\u2026(Fang Gejun: (#\u2035\u2019) !! I did not eat, I just was in normal evolution!)Xu Ziyan continued to move forward, and Xu Zirong looked at his back thoughtfully. In the past few years, he had learned a lot about the secrets of Xu Ziyan, and even some things. Xu Ziyan thought that it was very secret, but he actually fell into the eyes of Xu Zirong. He just didn\u2019t say\u2026According to his multi-angle observations, he felt that Xu Ziyan may have an independent space that could accommodate small items. This space should be similar to Na\u2019s, but it did not require a physical carrier, but it was connected to the brother itself.Looking at his brother\u2019s appearance, it may be that space had changed, but he didn\u2019t know if it was good or bad\u2026Quietly withdrawing his sight, Xu Zirong quietly down the stairs. The stairs that were close to the rock wall were not wide and could only accommodate one person. If there was an accident here, 90% of the possibility would fall off the abyss next to it.Just now, Xu Zirong quietly felt that since entering the cave, the aura around them began to produce a little disorder. This kind of aura disorder would make them unable to fly the sword, that was, once they fell off the abyss, they were dead.Fortunately, there were no traps on the stairs. If he looked at the heights, he could only see a faint white light with the two figures walking down the road.After about half an hour, they finally set foot on the bottom of the abyss.Stepping on the first foot of the steps, Xu Ziyan only felt a soft feeling coming from under his feet as if he had stepped on someone.He was shocked. When he was just watching it with a fireball, the ground seemed to be only black and lacquered. He thought it was an ordinary ground and didn\u2019t pay attention. He did not expect it to be such a strange touch.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s soft skin.\u201d Xu Zirong also felt that something was wrong at his feet, but because he was very proficient in plants, he called the name of this moss for the first time.\u201cSoft skin?\u201d Xu Ziyan frowned. \u201cIf I remembered correctly, this thing seemed to be more in the cemetery?\u201d\u201cYes, the nutrients of the dead would nourish this moss. The more people died, the higher the cultivation, the softer the moss.\u201d Xu Zirong was on the ground and picked up a soft skin to analyze his softness.Xu Ziyan suddenly felt some discomfort when he saw it. Although he had been in this cultivation for a long time, he should have not taken the killing seriously, but he couldn\u2019t help but feel sick when he thought that the moss was raised by the dead bones.\u201cZirong, don\u2019t touch it, it\u2019s so dirty.\u201d Xu Ziyan quickly pulled Xu Zirong\u2019s arm. How could dirty things feel like it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The moss in his hand was freely lost, and then he wiped out his handkerchief and wiped his hand. Where there was a large area of soft skin, it was usually in a cemetery, but the soft skin here was different from what he had seen in his life, which seemed to be more flexible.\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d Xu Ziyan hesitated but decided to go back. If it was a general treasure room, he would certainly not give up the search. But when he thought that this was the graveyard of others, and they were doing the work of digging graves, so he was not comfortable.Xu Ziyan snorted after listening to it and looked back at Xu Ziyan\u2019s tangled expression, and he suddenly could not help but laugh. \u201cBrother, don\u2019t worry, even if it was a cemetery, it was certainly not of a cultivator.\u201d\u201cNot a cultivator?\u201d Xu Ziyan said with amazement.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not a cultivator. The soft skin of the cultivator\u2019s body was not so pliable. If I didn\u2019t guess wrong, it should be buried a beast and a lot of monsters.\u201dWhen he saw Xu Ziyan still very puzzled, he dragged himself into inadvertently reading a miscellaneous note, which mentioned that the plant of the soft skin would absorb the nutrients of the corpse to evolve itself, and the cultivators were relatively weak. About the birth of such a pliable soft skin, only the monsters would have such a strong body which could have such soft skin. That was to say, here was buried a large number of monsters.Moreover, compared to Xu Ziyan, Xu Zirong had a deep understanding of the pattern of various places in the realm of cultivation.If it was the tomb of the predecessors, it was impossible for them to walk calmly down. With their cultivation, it was estimated that they would not see this deep valley and may have died in the trap of the road.There was no trap, which meant that what was buried here was not a big deal, but something that could give birth to soft skin and be not important, except for a large number of monsters, nothing else.\u201cOh, it turned out to be like this.\u201d Xu Ziyan nodded. He found that a younger brother who likes to read a book was really convenient. It was almost as easy to go out with an encyclopedia. Although he could easily remember the contents of the book, in the aspect of learning and using, he was not so cleverer than Zirong.This kind of pride feeling that I had a younger brother was beginning to burst.\u201cBrother, let\u2019s go back.\u201d Xu Zirong turned and said to Xu Ziyan.\u201cGo back?\u201d Xu Ziyan stunned. He was planning to dig his treasure; so how could he go back?\u201cWhy were we going back, since this was the corpses of the beasts, the flesh and blood was absorbed by the soft skin, and it couldn\u2019t even absorb the bones? If the number of monsters was large, it was estimated that the bones could also sell a lot of money, you were really not the owner of the house, so you didn\u2019t know how expensive oil and salt was.\u201d Xu Ziyan knocked on a slap in the head of a child. This little boy, who was everything good, but he was too sensitive to money. He always did some wasteful behavior intentionally or unintentionally, um, this was not a good habit, the inferior spiritual stone was also money, it would not fall out of nowhere!Xu Zirong screamed and looked at Xu Ziyan with tears. Xu Ziyan was stunned by the big wet eyes. He had no choice but to hold him in his arms again.Really, he obviously tapped it lightly. Well, Zirong was more and more spoiled!Xu Zirong\u2019s tears disappeared at the moment when he plunged into Xu\u2019s arms. As soon as he discovered that his tears were so devastating to Xu Ziyan, he quietly lit up the skills of crying at any time.He once felt that tears were a shame for men, but he now confirmed that as long as he could achieve his own goals, it didn\u2019t say he wanted to cry or not cry, even if he was really crying, what could he do?The means to achieve the goal was a good means! This was also one of the most profound lessons he had learned in his life.The two brothers hold together for a sweet moment, and Xu Ziyan took out a small shovel from the Qiankun bag and prepared to dig.Xu Zirong was very cooperative, he used the wood-based spells to remove the soft skin, and then used the soil spells to make the following land softer.Putting the fireball on the steps of the high place, Xu Ziyan began to dig his head in this light. This was the first time he digs the treasure after he crossed. He used to watch the actor encounter various opportunities and treasures in the novel, he was now trying it again.\u201cI wanted to dig, I wanted to dig, I had to dig! Dug and dug!\u201d With a strange little tune in his mouth, Xu Ziyan happily dug and dug on the ground, because the land had become very soft, so he glanced going down was almost as easy as shovel into the tofu.What he expected was that since it could give birth to a soft skin, it would prove that there would be a large number of corpses underneath, but he had dug for an hour, and there were seven or eight pits over three meters deep on the ground, but But even the bone slag was not found.Moreover, as he continued to hollow out and hollowed out, Xu Zirong\u2019s face was more and more intense. He did not help Xu Ziyan to dig but began to carefully observe the direction of the soft skin on the ground.\u201cHum, it was exhausted, how was it still nothing?\u201d Xu Ziyan sat down on the ground and wiped the sweat from the forehead.Even if he dug the tofu, the action of repeatedly bending over and getting up for a continuous-time was enough, not to mention the weight of the soil.In fact, Xu Ziyan simply complained about it, and there was no irritating psychology. After all, even the male owner in the novel wanted to get any baby, but also he had to experience some crisis of nine deaths. If he wanted to do this, he could dig anything treasure casually. That\u2019s too comfortable.Of course, the bones of some ordinary monsters and those heavenly treasures must not be comparable, but it was also a fortune, there was no reason to send them to him.Therefore, Xu Ziyan just spits a bit, but when he looked up, he found that Xu Zirong was gone.\u201cZirong!\u201d Xu Ziyan was shocked, when? How could he not see Zirong? With Zirong\u2019s strength, unless the other party was a monk in the Jindan Period, there was no reason to sneak him away!\u201cI was here, my brother!\u201d Fortunately, the voice of Xu Zirong came from the darkness, and finally, Xu Ziyan calmed down.\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d Xu Ziyan jumped up quickly and ran in the direction of the sound. Without running far, he saw a vague black shadow standing next to a rock wall. It seemed to be looking at something.\u201cZirong?\u201d Since the last encounter with the mermaid attack, Xu Ziyan had also long-term memory. This was not the world of his own comfortable county. When met strangers, he must be careful to watch out for it. It was not too common to kill people.As for those non-human creatures, he must be more careful. Most people could have human forms feed on human beings. They dare not say that they were all, but 90% were always there.Now the black shadow in front of me was too vague, although the figure was very similar to Xu Zirong, but Xu Ziyan had not lost his mind and flew directly, but with a careful approach to the fireball.As it turned out, he really thought more\u2026 The one standing there was indeed Xu Zirong, and as long as he was a little closer, he could distinguish the breath of the other person.\u201cWhat did you find?\u201d Needless to think, since Xu Zirong stood here, he must have discovered something.\u201cWell, there was something wrong with the soft skin.\u201d Xu Zirong replied casually.Just nothing Xu Ziyan had found but in Xu Zirong\u2019s eyes, it was the discovery of the treasure. Because the soft skin was never going to go wrong, it could give birth to so many and soft skins, it could be seen that there must be buried a monster with great energy.If Xu Ziyan dug and dug a lot of corpses, Xu Zirong may not be so excited, but he hadn\u2019t dig it for so long, which made Xu Zirong think of another guess.\u201cWhat was wrong?\u201d Xu Ziyan\u2019s limited understanding of plants, and he coupled with Xu Zirong\u2019s small encyclopedia of plants that were left behind, so he naturally ignored this aspect of learning.Xu Zirong looked at this situation but never said it. He smiled lightly: \u201cBrother, the soft skin would only grow near the corpse, and it could give birth to such a large area of soft skin, which proved that the buried corpse must contain a lot of energy, if it was a normal monster, the number was at least tens of thousands, but with such huge energy, we had not found any corpse. What did you think of? My brother?\u201dXu Ziyan\u2019s eyes were bright when he heard this: \u201cThe following was a high-order monster, buried in quality!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Xu Zirong smiled slightly, the body of the general beast was naturally not seen by him, but the high-order monster was not the same. For the human monks, the high-order monsters were all treasures. In addition to their flesh and blood, their bodies were also excellent refining materials.It was important to cultivate the mutual struggle between the comprehensions, but the magic weapon on hand was also the key to success. The most suitable for your own use, of course, was a magic weapon tailored for yourself. Xu Zirong had the experience of his life, for himself. The magic of this life had already been conceived, and now if it was just the right material for him, then it would be better.For the high-order monsters buried below, the two brothers began to dig deep together. According to the growth of the soft skin, Xu Zirong inferred that it was the most likely place to bury the corpse. The two dug for a full hour before they dug a white jade-tooth.Looking at the tooth that stood up a meter or so higher than himself, the shock in Xu Ziyan\u2019s heart could not be told in words.It\u2019s just that the teeth were so huge. Imagine how great this high-end monster body is!\u201cGolden behemoth\u2026\u201d Xu Zirong looked at the tooth and murmured: \u201cI thought it was just something that exists in the legend.\u201d\u201cGolden behemoth?\u201d Xu Ziyan also heard his whisper, and he immediately found a record of the golden behemoth from memory.It was said that the golden behemoth was the most admired totem image of the extremely western barbarian. This kind of monster was huge and fierce, but they only existed in the legend, and no one had ever seen a real golden behemoth.He didn\u2019t expect this kind of thing that had always been considered to be in the legend, but it really existed.\u201cContinue to dig.\u201d Xu Ziyan said decisively.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The flesh and blood essence of the golden behemoth had not been sucked up by the soft skin, but most of them had melted into the bones.Only those energy that escaped would cover the entire ground with the soft skin, and even climb up the rock wall.Such a huge amount of energy made this skeleton exude a majestic power. This kind of momentum was extremely aggressive. If it was an ordinary person, he was afraid that if he looks at the skeleton, he would be scared to death.\u201cGood things.\u201d Xu Zirong loved the golden skeleton, and the golden beast was brave and fierce. After he was dead, his awareness would also be kept.This kind of skeleton had such power, and if it was made into a magic weapon, it would definitely be amazing.In addition to this skeleton, they also harvested two white jade-like fangs, with two natural textures on it, and Xu Zirong felt bloody on it.He gently stroked his fangs and felt the bloodthirsty atmosphere inside. He didn\u2019t need to distinguish at all. He knew that the texture on the fangs was a natural array.The effect of the array was to prevent the wound from healing. That was to say when the golden behemoth was alive, anyone who was bitten by his fangs would bleed. If it was an oversight, the person would be killed.In addition, their biggest gain was the golden core placed next to the skeleton, although the color of Gold Core was a bit bleak because of the passage of time, it did not detract from its value.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity.\u201d Xu Zirong sighed softly. The loss of core was only about a quarter. Compared with his huge energy, the remaining three-quarters was enough to be amazing, but if there was complete core, he could create a golden behemoth.Even if it couldn\u2019t restore its full strength, it was enough to compete with the monks of the Golden Age.It was a pity that alchemy was no longer complete. Even if he used the secret method to point out the embarrassment, he could only use a limited number of times. Once the energy in the core was completely used up, the puppet would be considered abolished.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What a pity?\u201d Xu Ziyan\u2019s eyes were all filled with the golden bones. Even if he didn\u2019t understand the market of the bones, he could see its quality from the color of the bone.Now, these bones were no longer bones in the eyes of Xu Ziyan, but the white shining spiritual stones. He had not yet developed the simple concept of the material of his life, and all the thoughts in his mind were these bones. How much stone could be earned when the material was sold.It was noticed that Xu Ziyan\u2019s eyes had become a spirit stone-like shape. Xu Zirong couldn\u2019t help but smile. He had discovered that his brother seemed to be a contradictory complex. He had a concept for many things in his mind, but he often couldn\u2019t be linked to practice.For example, the golden behemoth, from the reaction of his brother, it could be seen that he had the concept of the golden behemoth, but until he pointed out, he would realize that the front was the skeleton of a golden behemoth.\u201cBrother, How should you deal with this skeleton?\u201d Xu Zirong asked.\u201cWell? Handling? In addition to selling, how could I deal with it?\u201d Xu Ziyan asked inexplicably. He didn\u2019t know that many of the demons could use the corpse to cast spells, but he didn\u2019t understand it at all.No matter the original body or him, he was ignorant of any magical means. This corpse was in his hands, and he couldn\u2019t find other ways to deal with it.Xu Zirong hesitated a little and decided to give his brother a temptation.No matter how he disguised, in the eyes of his brother, the well-behaved brother was an illusion. He couldn\u2019t guarantee that his brother wouldn\u2019t reveal any flaws in his life. What he wanted to be sure was, if his brother would find out the identity of his demon cultivator, what kind of reaction he would make.It\u2019s definitely not right, to tell the truth directly, so it\u2019s better \u2013 start here.\u201cBrother, I had inadvertently seen a secret manual which can\u2026\u201d Xu Zirong said with hesitation.\u201cHey? What could we do? You Say!\u201d Xu Ziyan looked at him with confusion.\u201cWe could make this corpse bone into a puppet.\u201dAs soon as he finished, Xu Zirong stared at Xu Ziyan very nervously. He had already made up his mind. If his brother had a little bit of rejection of this means, he would immediately change to say that this was what he accidentally saw from a miscellaneous note so it may not be reliable, and then he would deliberately fail when he was conjuring.In a word, he would never have a chance to let his brother hate himself.Xu Ziyan\u2019s expression was very surprised. He looked at Xu Zirong with a sly look. Xu Zirong\u2019s heart was very nervous. When he almost changed to say, he suddenly took a slap on the shoulder of Zirong\u2019s shoulder: \u201cHow could you say this good method?!\u201dAfter he finished, he touched his chin and said: \u201cGolden behemoth, the cockroach you made should be very good. This was a very good life-saving card, oh, it\u2019s so lucky!\u201dXu Zirong stood a long time and finally recovered from the gods. He quietly wiped the cold sweat from the forehead and then stared at Xu Ziyan with a weird look.My brother wouldn\u2019t know\u2026 was this the means of demon cultivation?He couldn\u2019t help but confirm it carefully: \u201cBrother, didn\u2019t you think\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat did I think?\u201d\u201cDid you think this method was evil?\u201d\u201cEvil?\u201d Xu Ziyan widened his eyes, then he took Xu Zirong\u2019s shoulders with both hands and looked at him seriously. \u201cZirong, it seemed that I had not taught you enough before. You had to remember that there was never a difference between evil and justice. Only those who use the means would have such attributes. Even if we use the bones to make a puppet, he had been dead for so many years; was it still coming back to find you?\u201dXu Zirong was said by him that was helpless\u201cMore\u2026\u201d Xu Ziyan grinned: \u201cAs long as we did things with a conscience, the means was not a big deal. Imagine if we had been doing good things and we were using the golden beast to do good things, then who could say that we were bad people? Just because we had used the dead corpse?\u201dXu Zirong\u2019s eyes brightened a little with Xu Ziyan\u2019s explanation. When he finished, his eyes were simply like stars.He only felt that his cheeks were hot and his heart beat faster. He didn\u2019t even understand why he felt this way, but at this moment, he only felt that his brother was very attractive.If he wanted to do it, he did not hesitate and directly plunges into his brother\u2019s arms, his face was squatting on his chest.For Xu Zirong\u2019s sudden courtship, Xu Ziyan was stunned. He didn\u2019t think that one thing he thought was normal would have such a big touch on Xu Zirong, but he gently touched him and calmed him.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Xu Ziyan asked softly.\u201cNothing, brother, you were so good.\u201d Xu Zirong buried his face in his chest, said muffled.\u201cOh, what does it show that I\u2019m good?\u201d Xu Ziyan deliberately teased him.\u201cYou are all good; my brother was the best.\u201d Xu Zirong said with a bite on his lips.Xu Ziyan couldn\u2019t help but laugh, he didn\u2019t look at the child\u2019s appearance as a small adult, but in front of him, he was still the cute little child (not!).What a spoiled thing, which was too cute!Xu Ziyan gently patted the back of Xu Zirong and only felt that such a spoiled brother was too cute. Indulging in the image of his \u2018dependant\u2019 brother, he did not realize that the delicate face buried in his arms was filled with greed and hunger.Such a beautiful brother\u2026 I really wanted to eat him\u2026Xu Zirong gently rubbed his lips, took a deep breath and took the taste of his brother.Only when this kind of skin was attached could he suppress the instigation of his heart.It seemed that from the last time he realized his brother\u2019s importance to himself, and after making up his mind to become his brother\u2019s lover, his senses for his brother were gradually changing.In the past, he was only regarded him as a brother, but unconsciously, under the circumstances that his brother did not know, he had already begun to be as his lover.The change in consciousness also caused a violent change in the bottom of his heart. He didn\u2019t know when the violent temper began to turn into hungry anxiety.He often wanted to kiss his brother\u2019s skin, even if he didn\u2019t do anything, just hold it together.Taking a deep breath again, Xu Zirong forced down the instigation of his heart.No! Not at least now.Didn\u2019t say that his brother just thought of himself as a younger brother. Even if he wanted to do something, he did not have the proper tools.With the memories of his last life, he understood what the incitement of the heart came from, and what needed to be solved. But now his physical development had not kept up, it was a state of over-capacity.Depressed with a sigh of relief, Xu Zirong repeatedly told himself to be patient. In the last life, in order to destroy the Xu family, he came through hard days, so what was this sweet torture?\u201cWell. Don\u2019t get tired of it. Try your secret method. If it didn\u2019t work, this thing still had to be sold.\u201d Xu Zirong put out from his arms, and Xu Ziyan did not notice the sadness in his eyes.The coming days would belong! Xu Zirong said to himself silently in his heart.After he finished speaking to himself, he began to use the secret method. This secret method was created on the basis of the Sutra, combined with a secret method of the demon cultivation Sect.Compared to the skeleton-only, the shape of the skull he made was almost the same as the real gold behemoth.Hesitated a little, he said to Xu Ziyan: \u201cBrother, gave me a drop of your blood.\u201dXu Ziyan bites his fingertips without hesitation, forcing a drop of blood and giving to him.The little blood bead exude a sweet taste, and Xu Zirong swallowed his slaver quietly, and the feeling of hunger and thirst that was suppressed was once again coming up.He really wanted to drink\u2026 The smell of his brother\u2019s blood was so sweet that even his soul was shaking. If the self-control was a little worse, he would rush to directly swallow the drop of blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In any case, he could no longer let the other party recover.So, with a kind of sly feeling, he put the drop of blood into the inner bead of the golden behemoth, then put the inner core into the center of the skeleton, dripped a drop of his own blood, and began to conjure.Xu Ziyan\u2019s blood was thoroughly integrated into the inner core, and Xu Zirong\u2019s blood formed a blood net outside the inner core. As its gradual release of light was strengthening, the blood net was beginning to zoom in and out, walking along the veins of the bones, and then generating skin and hair. After a small half hour, a behemoth stood in front of the Xu family brothers.\u201cGreat!\u201d Xu Ziyang could not help but sigh.Although he had long been known that the manual was magical, this method of extracting a monster from the bones was really amazing.It\u2019s just that his heart couldn\u2019t help but had some doubts. Was such a spell really he seen in the miscellaneous notes?Moreover, At the very beginning, The blood Xu Zirong left on the inner core also made him feel a little uncomfortable. It was not a dislike of the spell, but in the novel, Xu Zirong cultivated the blood and heart and then fell into the devil cultivation, but in this life, he clearly did not cultivate the Sutra, why did he still do it\u2026No\u2026 It\u2019s impossible\u2026 It must be that I think more!Xu Ziyan slammed his head powerful. How could the cold and ruthless demon in the last life be his cute and well-behaved baby brother? For blood, what was so great, just not contributing a drop? It\u2019s always not related to blood. It\u2019s all the Sutra, and he was too sensitive.Although he didn\u2019t admit that his brother and demon had anything to do with each other, in a remote corner of Xu Ziyan\u2019s heart, a suspected seed had been planted, and in the near future, the seed would take root and eventually \u2013 a complete outbreak!At that time it was too late for many things.\u201cHey!\u201d The golden behemoth made a low roar under the control of Xu Zirong. His body was huge and his momentum was amazing. He was absolutely oppressive from his body shape, but Xu Zirong was very clear. This was such kind unless they could find something that could replace him with the same level of inner core otherwise the effect of this golden behemoth could only be considered to be unsatisfactory.Xu Zirong was actually lacking in such a thing, but his current strength was also very weak. Before recovered all the strength, this golden behemoth was a very good sign.There had never been a sense of peace in the Cultivation world. No mentioning the demon cultivation, many so-called decent disciples secretly was doing the same thing about killing and robbery.Such a thing, Xu Zirong looked much more in his life. He was once accused of cultivating magical powers and killing countless mortal towns. In fact, there was only one town that really had a relationship with him. The reason for being killed was that a righteous disciple was coveting his beauty. He was not able to be taught by him. He felt that he had no face, so he went to the nearest mortal town to kill and vent his anger.In the eyes of some self-cultivators, the mortal life was like an ant. In their long life, mortals could always give birth together, so even if they killed some, they would soon recover.Xu Zirong had always been scornful of this statement. He could pat his chest and say that his bloody devils were more bright and upright than those who were doing the secrets of many righteous cultivators.\u201cZirong, how did I collect this stuff?\u201d Xu Ziyan looked at the huge gold behemoth and made a sudden embarrassment. When it was the skeleton, it could be brought together, and then put into the Qiankun bag, but nowadays the size was so large, so it couldn\u2019t be loaded in the Qiankun bag\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It could open up space for itself.\u201d Xu Zirong said with a smile, \u201cThe talent instinct of the golden behemoth was an independent space. He had no life now, so it was appropriate to put it in.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s great.\u201d Xu Ziyan was happy, then\u2026 \u201cHey, how could I get him in?\u201d\u201cI put your blood into the inner core of this behemoth. You could communicate with him with spiritual awareness. When you need him to come out, you could call him.\u201d\u201cIt was good.\u201dXu Ziyan stared at the behemoth and gave orders in the brain to return him to his own space. The golden behemoth screamed low, and then the huge body gradually disappeared into the void.XuZiyan closed his eyes and felt it, because of the drop of his blood, so he could clearly feel that there was a connection between him and the golden behemoth, but unfortunately, after all, it was not a life, the golden behemoth could only accept his instructions. But there was no way to give any response.But thought about it too, if Xu Zirong made a living golden behemoth, it should be that he would stun. Creating life was a real means of immortality. It was definitely not something that their comprehension can master.It was only one day after entering the secret realm of Qingling, and there was such a big gain. It was absolutely fake saying that Xu Ziyan was not happy.Because this cemetery had nothing but the bones of the golden behemoth, the two brothers picked in the large-scale soft skin and found the highest-order soft skin that had become pale blue. After leaving, the light blue soft leather was an excellent additive for refining defensive instruments, which made the clothes softer without losing the defensive strength.Four pieces of soft leather could sell the price of ten spiritual stones, except that because of the good quality of these things. It was also because the energy needed to support the development of soft skin to blue was too large, even it was the place where the monster of the golden behemoth was buried, but the area had produced four pieces.In the process of finding the blue soft skin, they found a narrow passageway, and the fresh air was blown from the passage.After confirming that there was nothing worth to take away, the two brothers walked into the passage and walked for about half an hour. After turning a corner, they saw the hole in the front.Because of the long-time digging in the dark caves, Xu Ziyan couldn\u2019t help but squint when he saw the light in the hole, just accidentally mentioning a piece of gravel.The gravel struck on the rock wall and made a crisp sound. At this moment, the change suddenly occurred, and a large group of black pressed shadows screamed and rushed toward them.\u201cBe careful!\u201d Xu Zirong yelled, and the vine seeds in his hand were instantly changing, and they were directly woven into a green big net, blocking them.Xu Ziyan\u2019s thunder was in his hand, and ten tiny flying snakes came straight out of his fingertips.\u201cHey!\u201d The first ten black shadows were hit by the Razer, and they screamed fiercely, and the Razers did not give up after hitting them. It slammed dozens of thunder and splatters around.\u201cHey!\u201d The black shadows hit by thunder light had screamed, and they all became very black and stunned, and they fell to the ground.The remaining black shadows screamed and flew in the direction of the exit.\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Xu Ziyang was shocked. Just now his thunderbolt burst that was his ability and was not easy to expose. If it wasn\u2019t the case was too sudden, and the number of enemies was too much he also did not need to use his own big move.\u201cIt\u2019s a rock bat\u2026\u201d Xu Zirong carefully identified the body on the ground, and suddenly he could not laugh.This rock bat was a very low-level monster, only about five layers of refining. Their only advantage was that their food was the rock where they live, so their body composition was also rocked. When they stayed with the rocks, the general human consciousness could not detect their existence, or they would not be attacked so suddenly.Moreover, this hind of rock bat was timid, disgusting light, and lived in the depths of the cave for many years. If it was not the sound of the gravel kicked by Xu Ziyan, it was afraid that it would not suddenly launch an attack.Silently he said sorry to the group of unlucky rock bats in the heart, then Xu Ziyan put those bombed black rock bats into the Qiankun bag one by one\u2014the bones of the rock bats were also the material of the refiner. Anyway, they were all dead, and the body should not be wasted.After a few quick steps, the two quickly walked out of the cave. When they entered the secret realm of Qingling, it was early morning. Now it also has a rising sun. Although their brothers dug for a day, the harvest was enough to envy countless people.\u201cGo, just pick one side.\u201d Xu Ziyan said to Xu Zirong.The scope of the secret realm of Qingling was too big, and the number of people coming in was very limited, so far, no martial art had a map here.\u201cGo over there.\u201d Xu Zirong took a finger in the direction. He didn\u2019t know what was there, but he had some kind of induction to the other side.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t mind. Anyway, the harvest of their trip was enough. Even if they were empty in the next month, they wouldn\u2019t do useless work.The brothers flew upon the sword towards the direction pointed by Xu Zirong. The mountains and rivers were crossed by them at their feet. He didn\u2019t know if it was his own illusion. Xu Zirong felt that the closer he was in that direction, the feeling in his heart that was stronger.\u201cWaited a minute!\u201d Xu Ziyan suddenly stopped in midair, and Xu Zirong lowered his head.They saw there was a cultivator who was in a coma on the grass.The cultivator was wearing a white robe, but the robes were covered with stains. Xu Ziyan naturally descended. It seemed that he wanted to see the life and death of this person, but Xu Zirong just couldn\u2019t help but frown when he looked at the figure.\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. let me go and see whether he could be saved or not.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xu Zirong was shocked. What was his brother\u2019s character? No one knew that better than him. If someone came to ask for trouble, his brother would never be kind, but he would never allow himself to kill someone he hated.In a word, Xu Ziyan did not object to him killing others, but he must find a reasonable reason. Otherwise, it would definitely make his brother angry, and he couldn\u2019t even imagine what the result would be.\u201cHey, were you okay?\u201d Xu Ziyan did not go directly to the man who was unconscious on the ground. With the profound lessons of the mermaid, Xu Ziyan had deeply engraved the words of alert in his heart.\u201cWu\u2026\u201d The man who was lying on the ground only made a cry that it can hardly be heard, and his body was moving a little, and then he had no response.Xu Ziyan thought about it and simply called Xu Zirong to go down.Xu Zirong reluctantly fell to his side: \u201cBrother, what did you care about? We didn\u2019t know him.\u201d\u201cWe are all cultivators. If we had the ability to save him, we had to save him. Today we saved him. Maybe he would save us in the future.\u201d Xu Ziyan paused: \u201cIf we couldn\u2019t save him, we couldn\u2019t waste anything in Qiankun bag.\u201dXu Zirong silently held the forehead. His brother\u2019s thoughts were too simple\u2026 Although he also came over like this year, he really had not done such a thing for a long time since he had the name of a demon.Just in case, Xu Ziyan applied a spell to the man to ensure that the man did not have the ability to resist. Then he got closer and carefully observed.Xu Zirong couldn\u2019t help but licked his eyebrows and saw his brother approaching the man, making him feel that this person was even more annoying. Even the face of the man had not been seen yet, but the boiling intention of the heart had reached an astonishing level.\u201cWell? Was he still alive?\u201d Xu Ziyan turned him over the other side, and the slightly undulating chest proved that this person still had a sigh of relief.He checked this person a little and found that there was no wound on the other side. On the contrary, there was some disorder in the fluctuation of spiritual power, which seemed to be like a martyr while cultivating.After hesitating, Xu Ziyan took out a white porcelain bottle from the Qiankun bag and poured a pill into the mouth of this person, which just melted in the mouth instant, and soon, This person in the coma gave a sigh and then woke up.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Xu Ziyan let the person to lean on himself. Although he cared about his body on his asking, the hand was hidden behind him, the blue thunder between the fingers had begun to swim cheerfully.It\u2019s true that people should be wary of others. It was better to be careful.His brother\u2019s vigilance against this stranger made Xu Zirong\u2019s face look better, but it\u2019s just a little\u2026\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The young man who had been helped up looked a little puzzled. Then he suddenly woke up and looked around in a panic: \u201cWhere was this?\u201dXu Ziyan raised his eyebrows in surprise. Did he guess wrong? This person was not a disciple of other sects who came with them?\u201cHere was the secret realm of Qingling? If you didn\u2019t know where it is, how did you come in?\u201d Xu Ziyan asked.The young man blinked, and his eyes floated a few doubts: \u201cI didn\u2019t know, I just ate the fruit in the woods, and then I passed out, when I waked up I was here.\u201d\u201cI was Bai Muhua, I hadn\u2019t asked the Taoist\u2019s distinguished surname yet.\u201d Bai Hua was not stupid, and soon it would react. This should be the effect of Qingling cited, but he had not figured out the details of the two yet. He had to use a pseudonym first.\u201cMy name was Xu.\u201d Xu Ziyan said faintly.\u201cXu Taoist.\u201d Bai Hua said, seeing the other party did not mean the details, he did not ask again.\u201cAlthough he didn\u2019t know how you entered here since you came here, it was a chance. Bai Taoist may wish to look around and maybe even gain something.\u201d Xu Ziyan said plainly.He had a feeling of incomprehensibility to the person in front of him. The person was white and beautiful. He was a rare beautiful man. It was reasonable to say that people were a visual animal. He was also understandable about the good feeling for this man in his heart. But what made him feel surprised was that while he had a good feeling, he had an inexplicable disgust.These two completely opposite feelings were intertwined, giving him a very contradictory attitude towards the handsome young man in front of him.As if there were two different villains in his mind, they lobbied to him desperately. The one in white said to him that this person was handsome and beautiful, talking polite, was a worthy friend, and the other in black reminded him it was a demon that was abnormal. This kind of incomprehensible was definitely not a good thing.This white and black villain fights in his mind, and he had a headache, so he had always neglected his own movements at this moment, maintaining a half-holding position.\u201cBrother, I thought this\u2026 Taoist friend didn\u2019t need you to support it.\u201d Xu Zirong blackened his face and unceremoniously reached out and grabbed Xu\u2019s arm.\u201cAh\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dBoth of them exclaimed at the same time, but Xu Ziyan was a little embarrassed, while Bai Hua was a bit shy and his face was slightly red.Xu Ziyan\u2019s looks were very handsome. Although he was only a 16-year-old boy, he already had the outline of a mature man. Handsome looks with a hearty smile, it was easy to get the goodwill of others.Bai Hua grew up in a brothel, and the education he had received since childhood had already distorted his concept. For him, a handsome man like Xu Ziyan was also very tempting, Not to mention that he tasted the taste of making love for the first time two days ago. Now, he saw such a handsome man who held himself in arms. He was somewhat tempted.In addition, he also heard his master mention the secret realm of Qingling that the Qingling cited opened. Which was the entry of elite disciples of many sects\u2019 elites? Now that the two could enter here, it did not mean that the identity of the two was elite in the super-sect?If he could hold such a though\u2026 Bai Hua showed a bit of joy. He did not expect that when he entered the secret realm of Qingling, he would have such a good opportunity.But\u2026 Bai Hua looked at the beautiful child next to him. His eyebrows were wrinkled because he lived in that place since he was a child. He was extremely sensitive to his observations. Moreover, Xu Zirong\u2019s disgust was almost undisguised. It was impossible to detect it.Brother. this kid just called Xu, that was, he was Xu Taoist\u2019s younger brother?Bai Hua couldn\u2019t help but feel awkward. If he wanted to hold the Xu Taoist\u2019s thigh, he couldn\u2019t do it with just a few words. The best way was naturally to develop a more intimate relationship with him, but if this child was always there, he was afraid that Xu Taoist may not do something untimely in front of his brother in any case.After a few thoughts, Bai Hua decided not to follow the Xu Taoist first. If he had the opportunity to seduce him, he would always be able to grab the opportunity if he wanted to come for a month.\u201cHow long did you have to rely on my brother?\u201d Xu Zirong stared at the Bai Hua, looking at the handsome face, but he had the urge to rush to him to completely draw him.It was strange to say that he used to be bloodthirsty at first, but he never wanted to draw other\u2019s face. Today it was the first time.\u201cAh, sorry.\u201d The Bai Hua\u2019s face was redder, and he climbed up from Xu Ziyan.Xu Ziyan also squatted up straight, and he was wondered why the thing changed from Zirong\u2019s words?What the even more frightening thing was that he was guilty of Xu Zirong\u2019s tone. What was he guilty about? He was a proper straight man. It was normal to hold a man.Xu Ziyan resolutely repelled his own inexplicable emotions in his heart, and he couldn\u2019t afford to hide. Although he had a good impression on this Bai Muhua, he had only a good impression, so he saw Zirong was not waiting to see him, and his attitude was worse than that of Wei Qing and Le Hu. Xu Ziyan decided that he still stayed away from Bai Muhua.\u201cWell, since Bai Taoist had nothing trouble, then we would leave.\u201d Xu Ziyan patted his butt and wanted to go. Anyway, when he saved him, he didn\u2019t expect any return. It was better to leave early.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Bai Hua was suddenly stunned. He admitted that his appearance could be called a perfect man, and his behavior was not unreasonable. Even if the other side had a warning to strangers, there was no reason to directly that want to leave him alone?Besides, he couldn\u2019t let Xu Ziyan go. If Xu Ziyan was gone, what should he do? He was fortunate enough to break through the foundations through the Qingling cited and the dragon-shaped jade. He couldn\u2019t understand the various spells after the foundation, and there was only a few poor pieces stone in his Qiankun bag. It did not have a flying sword.Looking at the four wilderness around, if he walked with two legs, he was afraid that he would walk for a month, and it may not come to this grassland.\u201cXu Taoist\u2026\u201d Bai Hua smiled bitterly: \u201cI was inexplicably pulled here. I didn\u2019t bring anything on my body. Moreover, I built the foundation soon, and even the flying sword was not ready\u2026\u201dXu Ziyan couldn\u2019t help but frown. If Bai was told the truth, then things were a little difficult. After all, Bai was just building a foundation. Even his realm was not stable. If he had not flown sword, he stayed here that was waiting for death almost.If he couldn\u2019t save anything, he couldn\u2019t do anything like that. In desperation, he could only take him with him.Just when Xu Ziyan agreed to leave with the Bai Muhua, Xu Zirong\u2019s face was already black and he could not look straight.He did not understand why Zirong was so disgusted with this handsome young man. It was reasonable to say that people were visual animals. This was a good thing to talk to Bai Muhua, but why could Zirong hate him?Riding the flying sword of Xu Ziyan, Bai Hua was very honest and sat still behind. Occasionally, when he looked at Xu Ziyan\u2019s eyes, he only showed a shy smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xu Ziyan was the same. But in his heart, the concern for his younger brother overwhelmed everything. Xu Zirong was so disgusted with the man, and it let his goodwill was discounted.Therefore, Xu Ziyan was entangled in the like or dislike of Bai Muhua. Finally, the hated feeling was much. He decided to find a relatively safe place to put him down. When they were ready to leave for a month, he would pick him up.In fact, this idea was mainly to take care of Xu Zirong\u2019s mood. Although he didn\u2019t know why Zirong was so disgusted with the man, Xu Ziyan couldn\u2019t ignore Xu Zirong\u2019s feelings just for a stranger with a little bit of good feeling.Bai Hua calmly accepted the request of Xu Ziyan. Once he was confident in his appearance, he did not feel that he was absolutely unparalleled to let a stranger fell in love with a glance. If there was a long-term contract, he was more confident to attract Xu Ziyan, but in a few hours, it was absolutely impossible to do this. Secondly, he felt that his dragon-shaped jade seemed to feel something, and it was faintly hot. He wanted to explore the secret of jade, but this kind of thing could not be done before the Xu brothers.For the sensation of Bai Muhua, Xu Ziyan had a better impression of him. Some regrets in his heart that Zirong\u2019s ideas were against him, but he finally put him next to a stream according to his requirements.After bidding farewell to Bai Muhua, the low pressure on Xu Zirong immediately eased. Although his face was still cold, Xu Ziyan could feel that Zirong was relaxed.\u201cZirong\u2026 Did you hate Bai Muhua?\u201d Hesitated a moment, Xu Ziyan still asked. In his impression, although Zirong was cold, he would never make his disgust so obvious.Xu Zirong was silent for a while, and slowly raised his head: \u201cBrother, if I said that I didn\u2019t even know why I hate him, do you believe me?\u201dXu Ziyan stunned, and then nodded quickly: \u201cI believed you! Why didn\u2019t I believe you?\u201d Then he smiled and jumped to Xu Zirong\u2019s flying sword. He touched his head smoothly: \u201cAt any time, I would believe you.\u201dXu Zirong blinked and suddenly fell into the arms of Xu Ziyan.\u201cBe careful!\u201d Xu Ziyan was scared with a cold sweat, they were lying in the flying sword. If they were not careful, they would fall down. The cultivator was very powerful, but it did not include that he could not fall to death. If they let others know that they were falling to death because of the unstable sword, it was estimated to be the funniest news in the 10 years of the Xuanyu region.\u201cSorry.\u201d Xu Zirong spit out his tongue. His brother said that he would believe him at any time, which made him a little excited, and he forgot that he was still driving a lying sword.Xu Ziyan watched Xu Zirong for a long time, suddenly he burst into laughter. The expression of Xu Zirong spitting out tongue was so cute. Now thinking about it, he never seemed to see Zirong\u2019s so childish expression \u2013 even if he still was a 12-year-old child.Embarrassed by the laughter of Xu Ziyan, the Lord of the blood demon also realized what he had just done. His cheeks were reddish, and the chagrin in his heart was beyond words. He was confused about how could he unconsciously do something childish under Ziyan\u2019s doting, although he was alive for two generations.It\u2019s so shameful!As a matter of fact, the blood demon had only lived for 30 years in the last life. What impressed him the most in the past ten years was the abuse he suffered at the Xu family. In the middle ten years, he was endlessly practicing and cultivating. The only conviction that supported him to continue to cultivate was to return to the Xu family and revenge them. His aversion to the family had even become the belief that he would survive.In the last ten years, he killed the Xu family and established the blood demon Palace which becomes the famous demon at that time, because he did not want to die in the hands of those who were righteous cultivators. But he did not expect that he died in the hand of Bai Hua and his few boyfriends in the end.Wait\u2026Bai Hua?Xu Zirong\u2019s eyes suddenly widened, and he realized why he hated Bai Muhua because his back was so much like Bai Hua. He has watched countless times that bitch and his three boyfriends making love on a big bed, and naturally, it was familiar to the back, but the face of Bai Muhua and the face of Bai Hua\u2026Wait!!!Xu Zirong\u2019s eyes instantly became blood red, and his body burst into a very murderous look.Why? Why couldn\u2019t he remember the appearance of Bai Hua??He was very clear about all the memories of his last life, but he couldn\u2019t think of what Bai Hua looked like??!!It felt like someone had erased Bai Hua\u2019s face from his memory. Whenever he thought about the memory of Bai Hua, the face of Bai Hua would be hidden in the clouds, and even he would unconsciously ignore this point!\u201cZirong, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Xu Ziyan looked at Xu Zirong with amazement. The sudden murder of the screaming look scared him. He almost immediately put a layer of a spiritual shield in front of his brothers. The lightning snake between the fingers was also swimming cheerfully, ready to make a fatal blow.Until he realized that the look of this murderous was from Xu Zirong, his face suddenly became ugly. Most of the time on ordinary days, Xu Zirong was very cold, so what kind of revenge could arouse such a strong murderous spirit?Under his protection, Zirong did not suffer any grievances at the Xu family, and there were no enemies. And this murderous feeling was so rich that it was almost going to be turned into substance. What was going on?Xu Zirong\u2019s murderous feeling only took off for a moment and it was controlled by him. But Xu Ziyan\u2019s words made him fall into the ice suddenly.The doubts about Bai Hua were directly left behind mind by him. Now the only thing he needed to consider was how to explain to Xu Ziyan that this murderous feeling from his body.His body shape was stiff, Xu Zirong did not dare to move. He thought hard about the solution to the problem. But his distance from Xu Ziyan was too close before. If he said that the murderous feeling was from other places completely, it was to despise Xu Ziyan\u2019s IQ.He knew that his brother was very fond of himself, but if this thing was not explained well, it would definitely cause a fatal gap between their brothers.How to do it? How to do it?Xu Zirong was running fast with his brain, but at this moment his head seemed to be empty, and he couldn\u2019t think of anything.The little tricks played in daily life which were useless at this time. He tried to think and couldn\u2019t come up with a solution.\u201cZirong? Are you okay?\u201d Xu Zirong did not move or talk for a long time, Xu Ziyan was too anxious. He looked at Zirong standing numbly on the flying sword, and his heart was like being baked by fire.\u201cZirong, don\u2019t scare your brother, damn, what the hell was going on? There was no one around. How could you become like this?\u201d Xu Ziyan simply released his flying sword and held Xu Zirong and jumped out.Xu Zirong was still anxious about how to explain, but a sentence from his brother made him suddenly inspiring.At the moment when he was hugged by Xu Ziyan, he immediately softened his body, as if he had lost consciousness and hung himself completely on his brother.Xu Ziyan took Xu Zirong on his flying sword and saw that Zirong lost consciousness. He quickly fell down and placed him under a small tree, and then he checked him in a hurry.The result of the inspection was naturally that there was no damage. Xu Ziyan took his wrist without hesitation and let his spiritual power to examine the inside of Zirong\u2019s body along his meridians.Xu Ziyan\u2019s spiritual power was accompanied by the power of the green spiritual thunder, and he spent almost nine points to suppress the thunder, and the remaining one could be used to explore Xu Zirong\u2019s body.In a short period of time, Xu Ziyan\u2019s face began to shed a large sweat, and the bitter sweat poured into his eyes, but he did not even have the energy to wipe it. At this moment, all his spirits had been concentrated on suppressing the green spiritual thunder and exploring the body of Xu Zirong, and everything else was not taken care of.Only one point of a lot of spirits to explore, such the efficiency made Xu Ziyan\u2019s Dantian half-emptied soon. Seeing that nearly half of the Zirong\u2019s body had not been explored, Xu Ziyan felt the spiritual power that was about to dry up and secretly cries for help.Divided a bit of mind, he took a bottle of elixir to replenish vitality from the Qiankun bag. Xu Ziyan poured a bottle of pills into his mouth without looking at it. The smell of fragrant quickly turned into a heat flow into his Dantian. The green spiritual thunder in his Dantian was like a shark that smelled blood and rushed up\u2026With the supplement of the elixir to replenish vitality, Xu Ziyan finally managed to probe Xu Zirong\u2019s body meridians, including Dantian. There was no problem. The anxiety in his heart was even worse because there was no damage to the body, but Zirong was still unconscious. If he didn\u2019t wake up, it meant that the attack on him probably came from spiritual awareness.When Xu Ziyan was eager to leave the secret realm of Qingling to ask for help from his master, Xu Zirong suddenly sighed and then opened his eyes.\u201cZirong!\u201d Xu Ziyan was overjoyed and hugged him: \u201cAre you okay?\u201dXu Zirong blinked as if he had a big dream and was awakened: \u201cBrother?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me, what happened to you? Was someone attacking you?\u201dXu Zirong seemed to be a bit confused. He nodded first, then shook his head again: \u201cI didn\u2019t know. It seemed that someone suddenly got into my mind. He asked me to give my body to him. But as you said before, the body could never be handed over to others, and I started to fight with him. That person was very powerful, and he had many manuals, but I could control the surrounding environment, so I finally won.\u201dWhen he said that he finally won, Xu Zirong showed a bit of self-satisfaction and a look that he wanted to ask for praise.But Xu Ziyan was almost scared by what he described.Wasn\u2019t he taken the soul away? Oh, My God! My brother was almost taken the soul away by others! The world was too unsafe, and it was possible to be taken the soul away on the road!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then he held his shoulder and told him very seriously: \u201cRemember, your body was your own. If this happened again, you couldn\u2019t let that person succeed!\u201dXu Zirong seemed to have been scared too, and he nodded obediently, saying that he would insist on fighting and resolutely not let the people succeed who wanted to take his soul away.At this time, Xu Ziyan also linked the murderous look with the person who took the soul away. Suddenly he was scared, because that man was so strong murderous. How many people did that man kill? Fortunately, Zirong had won at home field, otherwise, he was afraid of two brothers would probably die here.Xu Ziyan took Xu Zirong in his arms and comforted him, and he simply did not go. He found an open space and set up a tent, Then he went hunting, intending to use food to comfort Xu Zirong\u2019s heart.Looking at his brother\u2019s busy figure, Xu Zirong had a rare guilt. This time his flaws were too big, otherwise he would not use such a bad reason as \u201ctaking away soul\u201d.Although his brother believed, it meant that he must be more careful in the future, unless he intended to have a showdown directly with his brother, Otherwise, he must not be exposed his such a strong murderous look without sufficient reason.It\u2019s not easy to make a fool of it, watching his brother sweating out because he was worried about himself. Xu Zirong\u2019s heart was full of guilt, but he would rather bear this guilt than the danger of losing his brother.\u201cBrother, I was all right, you should have a rest early.\u201dPerhaps he was self-blame that Zirong was attacked in front of his eyes and he did not even find out so Xu Ziyan was almost staring at Xu Zirong all night.The more worried Xu Ziyan was, the guiltier Xu Zirong was, although he only came up with this method when he was in a hurry, but in fact he did deceive his brother.Xu Zirong was with a guilty conscience. He didn\u2019t know if this matter was revealed in the future how his brother would think of him. He enjoyed the love of his brother and enjoyed the trust of his brother. He couldn\u2019t imagine that if he lost him one day. Would he fall into madness\u2026\u201cWell, you should have a rest too, Don\u2019t cultivator today.\u201d Xu Ziyan touched his brother\u2019s head, and his blue silk was still silky smooth.He sighed in his heart silently. The more sensible Zirong was, the more self-responsible he was. Although he also knew that his strength, he could not help at all, and still felt guilty. He always felt that he had not protected his brother well.The two brothers tossed and turned in the tent with different minds. It was rare for a night without training. None of them both slept well\u2026Getting up early the next morning, although it was not a problem for the cultivators to stay up all night, the two brothers had a lot of thoughts last night, so they looked awkward.Looking at each other, the two couldn\u2019t help but laughed at the same time, and Zirong got into the arms of Xu Ziyan and acted like a spoiled child, and Xu Ziyan was also very fond of messing up Zirong\u2019s hair.Xu Ziyan did not know what Zirong though about, but he had already completely thought it through.The little chick would start to fly. At this time, Xu Zirong was no longer the child who was being bullied in his memory.Although he was only twelve years old, he was a real cultivator of construction. Like in a sudden crisis yesterday, he may have encountered many times. As a brother, he could protect him as much as possible, but he could not guarantee that he would succeed every time.In this world, no one could protect another person forever. It was better to practice harder than to be at a loss when faced danger. If their own strength was strong enough, who could take them?After packing up the tent, the two brothers of Xu family began to attack the sword once again. The kind of call that Xu Zirong felt was getting stronger and stronger. Although he suffered a lot of attention in the encounter with Bai Muhua yesterday, the feeling of calling didn\u2019t disappear, just became weaker.When they left Bai Muhua, the feeling of calling was strong again. Xu Zirong was hesitant to go there, because the closer he was, the more clearly he felt and responded to the call that was the bloody heart of his body.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Seeing his brother\u2019s interest was not high, Xu Ziyan asked strangely.Xu Zirong stunned his eyebrows, and he could vaguely feel that this call for him would be of great benefit to him, but once he was involved in the bloody heart, he would had a feeling of guilty inexplicable. Especially because one of his small mistakes yesterday was to be compensated by a big lie, he didn\u2019t mind lying, but when the object of lying was his brother, it became a problem.\u201cNothing, I just suddenly remembered that person yesterday.\u201d Xu Zirong didn\u2019t want to discuss the topic about the bloody heart, but after he accidentally said this sentence, he couldn\u2019t help but wrinkle more tightly.If the back of that person was very similar to the Bai Hua yesterday, he couldn\u2019t go so far as to lose his temper and broke out in a violent rage.After all, half of his tragic experience in his life was caused by the original Xu Ziyan, and the other half of course was attributed to the monk of Bai Hua.His hatred of Bai Hua couldn\u2019t be described in words at all, even if it was a thousand knives, it was difficult to dispel his hatred.Just\u2026Xu Zirong looked at Xu Ziyan quietly. If he was only himself, he would definitely not hesitate to kill the Bai Muhua, not for anything else. It would be enough for him only because of his back like Bai Hua.But now he had his brother\u2026 He had to consider his brother\u2019s impression of himself.He knew that his brother\u2019s character was not the kind of ruthless or selfish. If he killed a person without any reason, he would definitely be played by his brother\u2026 This was what he experienced a few years ago.\u201cLucky of you\u2026\u201d Xu Ziyan flashed a slap in his eyes, but his face was a helpless look.His brother\u2019s personality made him unable to do whatever he wanted in many ways, but if he lost this character, then his brother would no longer be his brother\u2026Although Xu Zirong had many thoughts, he actually only figured it out between the moments.Xu Ziyan listened to him and mentioned that Bai Muhua had a slight glimpse. He thought that Xu Zirong hated that person very much. How could he take the initiative to mention him?\u201cWhy did you suddenly remind him?\u201dXu Zirong raised his eyebrows and showed a smile or not: \u201cIsn\u2019t brother thought that he was very beautiful?\u201dXu Ziyan was inexplicably guilty, and he moved away from his gaze: \u201cit\u2019s okay. Just so so.\u201dWhen the words were exported, he felt that something was wrong. He had a guilty wool thread. Well! He clearly did not do anything! What were Zirong talking about? Could a man be described as \u2018beautiful\u2019?He started his face and planned to teach him a lesson. But before he spoke, Xu Zirong said first, he said: \u201cDid brother think that he was very general?\u201dWhen he said this, his eyes sparkled and his eyes looked unobtrusive.Xu Ziyan stunned and couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He always thought that the character of Zirong should not be very fond of others mentioning his delicate and beautiful face, so he usually was careful that didn\u2019t describe Xu Zirong by a word like beautiful or anything else.But he did not expect that he was very proud of how beautiful he was? So when he saw a man with good looks, Zirong felt a heart in his heart?Xu Ziyan realized that Xu Zirong would hate Bai Muhua so much, but this kind of that I was very beautiful, more beautiful than everyone\u2019s little expression hung on Xu Zirong\u2019s face, how was it so cute!He finally couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter. In fact, he really didn\u2019t care much about one\u2019s appearance. Although he couldn\u2019t reach the old monk said that face and appearance was just like a stinking skin, but he was fancier one\u2019s heart.He did not deny that people who interact with each other and who had better looks were always more likely to get the favor of others, but as long as they got along for a long time, they would find that even those who were ugly, as long as they were used to see it, it was a normal thing .Xu Zirong would become a beautiful beauty in the future. He had already had an intuitive impression. In the past, the demon of a red robe was enough to surprise the whole magical figure.If he only looks at the appearance, for many years, including his life experience, he really did not find any man who was more beautiful than Xu Zirong, the delicate face was still a little tender, but once it was mature, it was definitely a national cursed beauty.He clearly remembered that when he mentioned the demon Palace in the novel, It said that there were many people who rely on the name of the demon because of coveting his delicate face, and even some people rumored that the whole demon Palace was the harem of Xu Zirong.Of course, these were all rumors. After all, from the memory of the original, Didn\u2019t talk about the harem, he was afraid that when Xu Zirong died, he was still a virgin\u2026What was he thinking about? Why did he study whether his brother was a virgin? With the conditions of his brother\u2019s life, was it still worried that he couldn\u2019t find a lover?Xu Ziyan felt that she was simply a typical representative of a good Chinese brother. Zirong was only twelve years old. He even started thinking about his brother\u2019s future wife.\u201cBrother\u2026\u201dSeeing that Xu Ziyan did not answer his questions for a long time, he was in a daze there. Xu Zirong was slightly unhappy. He quietly put his flying sword, deliberately calling him in the ear of Xu Ziyan.As soon as Xu Ziyan was aroused and shivered. He suddenly felt a warm breath blowing in his ear, which made him unable to control it and almost lost control of flying sword.\u201cZirong!\u201d Xu Ziyan shouted dissatisfied, blowing something into his ears, brother, you couldn\u2019t play like this!Xu Zirong looked at his brother\u2019s reaction with great interest. The one that he had just learned was from Bai hua. He had seen it several times. The Bai hua was just sighed softly to Xu Ziyan\u2019s ears. They would soon go to bed, and came to a hearty joy love.In his life, because of his childhood, so no matter whether it was a man or a woman, there was no way to evoke his sexual desire, and he plus the cultivation of the blood and sea heart, if he made love with a person who was willing to give his weaknesses to others, then he lost trust to everyone, and he became a sex cold feeling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The smile on his face was getting bigger and bigger. He couldn\u2019t help thinking that although Bai Hua was a bitch, his methods were quite effective.\u201cBrother? Why were you so angry?\u201d Xu Zirong pretended to be innocent and asked.Xu Ziyan was speechless with rage, but there was no way to tell Xu Zirong directly that his baby brother didn\u2019t even have primary sperm, how could he explain to him about the sensitive point?Besides, he never knew that his ears were sensitive. It was enough to be excited when someone blew it!\u201cNothing. Don\u2019t blow into my ear in the future, Did you hear me?\u201d Xu Ziyan had no choice but to show his brother\u2019s authority.\u201cWell.\u201d Xu Zirong nodded his head cleverly, but in his mind, he had already listed a series of temptation targets in a small book.If he remembered correctly, he had a wet dream for the first time when he was twelve years old in his last life. It\u2019s estimated to be faster. He didn\u2019t think about what he would do with Xu Ziyan now. After all, he was the delicate one; he would not act rashly until he had absolutely suppressed his brother\u2019s strength.Xu Ziyan shook his head gently and looked helplessly at Xu Zirong who looked at himself as a good baby.Why was his young brother so cute? He couldn\u2019t bring himself to scold him\u2026Xu Ziyan deeply despised his affection complex for his younger brother. But he also knew that unless it was a matter of principle, otherwise, his favor with Xu Zirong was enough to overwhelm all the thoughts of wanting to teach him\u2026From the eyes of his brother, Xu Zirong saw the familiar helplessness again. Xu Zirong smiled shyly, but he drew a hook on the small book. Well! This level of temptation was not found at all, so he would do it later!In the middle of fighting in jest or for fun, the two flew for a whole day, and finally, they stopped their steps in front of a green bamboo forest with the white fog rose.\u201cWas it here?\u201d Xu Ziyan whispered.Xu Zirong nodded, and the voice calling him was hidden between the bamboo forests.He hesitated: \u201cBrother, how about letting me go ahead and seeing?\u201d\u201cWhat were you talking about?\u201d Xu Ziyan was unhappy with the face. \u201cI\u2019m here, so how could I let you take risks?\u201dXu Zirong silently closed his mouth. In this kind of thing, his brother\u2019s desire for protection could not be violated.\u201cOkay, since we were all here, let\u2019s go in together. Since there was something in it that could sense you, maybe it would be your chance.\u201dXu Zirong was helpless, and he followed his brother stepped into the bamboo forest together.The bamboo forest was full of fog, and it was almost impossible to see the situation five meters away.Although the master once said that the danger territory in the secret realm of Qingling was really low, Xu Ziyan did not intend to take risks, but he moved slowly, and even every time he had to explore the front again.Because they had the feeling of the \u2018thing\u2019, So they wouldn\u2019t get lost in the bamboo forest. Now that the article was obvious to Xu Zirong than the bright light, the blood in his body seemed to be cheering and clear to him which guided the direction for him.Unconsciously, the pace of Xu Zirong\u2019s feet was getting faster and faster. Xu Ziyan had accelerated the speed after he realized that there was really no trap in this bamboo.When the two men went for half an hour, Xu Zirong\u2019s footsteps jerked.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Xu Ziyan wondered.\u201cArrived.\u201d Xu Ziyan whispered. He felt that the thing that called him was in front.Two brothers looked forward at the same time. They didn\u2019t pay attention to it. At this time, it seemed that the front was clearly an open space covered by fog.At this time, a breeze blew, and the mist that enveloped the open space was blown away with the breeze, revealing the hidden scenery inside\u2026Click, click!The small chewing sound was unusually obvious in the quiet bamboo forest, and the expressions of the two brothers were a bit dull.Xu Zirong did never think about it which echoed the blood and heart of his body. It turned out to be such a monster\u2026 Originally, he thought that it would be the blood core or other treasure left by a predecessor who had cultivated the heart of the blood.Click, click!The monster did not seem to notice that two people were peeking at it to eat, and it was happy to eat.Xu Ziyan looked at that one\u2013a bit like a rabbit\u2019s monster, and he couldn\u2019t speak for a while.The reason why he said \u2018like\u2019 the rabbit was mainly because it looked like a rabbit, and the one that was being licked in its mouth was indeed a carrot piece. Even its movements to move the place were no different from ordinary rabbits.To say the only difference, that is, the pink \u2018rabbit\u2019 had two antlers on its head\u2026Click, click!The antler rabbit was very happy, and a slender carrot quickly disappeared into its mouth.Perhaps it may have sensed someone else\u2019s gaze. It was slowly twisting its head, the bright red eyes were fixed to look at the Xu brothers, and then \u2013 it did not know where to take out a carrot, while watching them both \u201cClick, click\u201d chewed up.\u201cThis\u2026 was calling your baby?\u201d Xu Ziyan asked hesitantly. This thing really didn\u2019t like to be a lot of lethalities\u2026Xu Zirong also nodded a little bit: \u201cProbably\u2026\u201dThe two brothers and the antler rabbits squinted for a long time until the rabbit finished the second carrot, which was slowly smashed.It reached Xu Zirong\u2019s feet and looked at him for a long time with a look of scrutiny. This revealed a sigh of reluctance to go and raised his paw and patted it.Xu Zirong immediately revealed a strange expression, and Xu Ziyan next to him could not help but ask: \u201cWhat?\u201dXu Zirong looked tangled: \u201cBrother, it wanted to sign a contract with me.\u201dTo be honest, the Gorefiend had never raised a spirit beast for two generations. In his opinion, that stuff was a chicken rib, it\u2019s not working, so when the antler rabbit signed a contract with him, he was somewhat entangled.Xu Ziyan looked at the rabbit that looked like a \u2018weak wind\u2019 and couldn\u2019t help but speechless. The general monk looking for a beast must be the type of combat power, but this rabbit \u2013 even a long-horned rabbit \u2013 did not look like a powerful character.He never heard that someone used a rabbit monster to be a beast. Generally, this cute thing was used to give a female monk, and let the female was happy. After all, the rabbit monster was mostly gentle and grows. It\u2019s cuter, as the best messenger to communicate the feelings between men and women, it\u2019s still very competent.Xu Ziyan did not give Xu Zirong any advice. He felt that this kind of thing was decided by him.It was also the case. Xu Zirong did not consider how long it took to agree. In any case, since this thing could be called with the blood and heart of his body, how should it not be missed?After signing the contract of the spirit beast, the antler rabbit showed a pair of expressions of \u201cyou are right, kid\u201d. Xu Zirong\u2019s eyes were slightly pumped. Inexplicable, how could he want to play this rabbit?The pink antler rabbit yawned, then slammed on the shoulders of Xu Zirong, and found a place to squat down, half-squinting and enjoying.Xu Zirong\u2019s pupils shrank abruptly, and even Xu Ziyan on the side was a stunning look.Although a large part of the rabbit monsters was good at the fast speed, liked the antler rabbit, it was so amazing that the speed of both of them couldn\u2019t keep up.Xu Zirong half narrowed his eyes and slightly curled up the lips, it seemed that it liked a rabbit but not a rabbit; it did not seem so simple.Xu Ziyan looked at the pink rabbit on the shoulders of his brother, and then looked at his half-eyed eyes. He suddenly wanted to laugh, because at this time, Xu Zirong\u2019s expression and the look of the rabbit. It\u2019s really very similar.Inexplicably, they got a rabbit as a spirit beast, and they didn\u2019t come back empty-handed.Even though the rabbit looked sly and lazy, it lingered on Xu Zirong\u2019s shoulder all day, either by licking its carrots that could be changed at any time or by screaming.Three days after they left the bamboo forest grove, basically the two brothers had confirmed that the rabbit was definitely not simple.Not to mention its super-fast speed, just because it could make carrots all the time, it was enough for the two to put away the small flaws on it.There weren\u2019t many monsters that could have their own independent space, but they were all very powerful characters, just like the golden behemoths they made before, and only with its level of monsters could they open space up alone. Space was used to store your own baby.Didn\u2019t think that the monsters didn\u2019t care about those treasures. In fact, the more of the monsters, the more they value those things. After all, before they were transformed, it was a joke to use the beast to refine the refining device, so they could only rely on those naturally formed treasures.If someone could open their storage space while the beast was alive, they would find that the more ability they had, the better the things in their storage space, similar to the collection of golden behemoths. Most human monks were jealous. Unfortunately, at the moment when the golden beast died, the space it opened up lost contact with it. Without the control of the master, this space would be shattered by the turbulence of time and space in a short period of time.The space was broken, and the various treasures inside were naturally impossible to stay. The space where the golden behemoth was in existence that was still re-opened by it at the moment when it became a beggar.Is there any treasure in the space of this rabbit? Xu Ziyan did not think about this problem at all. The more he got along with the rabbit, the more he felt that it was unfathomable. Although he was now the spirit beast of Xu Zirong, but Xu Ziyan would not think that it would let Xu Zirong search its collection.Didn\u2019t forget it, at first, it took the initiative to become the spirit beast of Xu Zirong. The contract of the beast-like this was the highest level of contract. The beast and the owner were equal. There was no one to suppress the other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was based on the cooperation between the two parties. No matter which party wanted to destroy the contract, this contract had no limit which was possible to build a bridge between humans and monsters that could communicate with each other.After all, before turning into human form, it was too difficult for the monster to communicate with humans!However, Xu Zirong did not need to worry that the spiritual beast would be countered. Anyone who signed this contract would not be able to hurt each other within ten years even if the contract was lifted.With a strange rabbit, the two brothers began to wander in the secret realm of Qingling.The secret realm of Qingling\u2019s range was really too big. Xu Ziyan couldn\u2019t imagine how huge the super-sects was when they took the the whole range of secret realm of Qingling as their mountain gate.But thinking again, such a powerful sect was completely annihilated in the struggle with another large-scale sect, which could made people fear the super-sects in those large-scale regions.However, everything about this had nothing to do with Xu Ziyan. In addition to the struggle with the monster cultivators, Xuan Yu region was generally a relatively peaceful place.Although there were some battles between the justice and evil, even small movements among major sects, these frictions were controlled within an acceptable range under the pressure of monster cultivators.From this point of view, the peace of the Xuan Yu region was brought by monster cultivators.Because they didn\u2019t feel any inspiration or find any kind of ruins of the palace, Xu Ziyan and Xu Zirong walked for seven days in the secret realm of Qingling. The opportunity of looking for inheritance in Qingling, was very important. Xu Ziyan felt satisfied with the puppet of golden beast.\u201cHuh?\u201d Xu Ziyan found a shadow flying over them, and soon that shadow returned and flew towards the two brothers.\u201cHello, two cultivator friends.\u201d The man greeted them very warmly.Xu Ziyan also cupped one hand in the other hand for respect: \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cI was Zhao Youdao of Xiaoyuan sect.\u201d The thin young man smiled and said. \u201cWere you disciples of the Liu Guang sect?\u201dXu Ziyan nodded and smiled: \u201cExactly. I was Xu Ziyan; this was the younger brother Xu Zirong. Was there anything when you were looking for our brothers?\u201dZhao Youdao heard Xu Ziyan\u2019s words, affirmed his guess and suddenly brightened his eyes: \u201cI and two disciples of Tian Yu sect discovered a ruin. There may be the inheritance of a ancient sect. I wondered whether you are interested to explore there with us?\u201dXu Ziyan was surprised that it was a place of inheritance! But soon he was alert. Smiling and looking at Zhao Youdao: \u201cOh? I wondered why you wanted to invite us. The inheritance in the secret realm of Qingling was generally safe, so you did not need us to help.\u201dZhao Youdao smiled helplessly: \u201cI also knew that there was no danger in the inheritance place. But this place was special\u2026 Oh, I didn\u2019t mean that it was dangerous there, but there was a defensive array at the entrance. I and one disciples of Tian Yu sect took two days to study and understand that if we wanted to enter there, we must had five people, stepping on the five elements position to form a five-elements palingenesis to get in.\u201dAfter that, Zhao Youdao was very depressed: \u201cYou also know that the secret realm of Qingling was very broad. I had been looking for someone for a few days. It\u2019s hard to meet both of you.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Xu Ziyan nodded. He did not doubt Zhao\u2019s words. After all, the way of opening the inheritance place was different, and there was no certain rule. Every cultivator who left the inheritance place had different hobbies. For example, once there was a inheritance place where was left a spiritual beast to guard, only the female cultivators who had the appearance of that cultivator\u2019s affirmation were allowed to enter\u2026\u201cI wondered whether Xu cultivator-friend intended to explore with us. I and the disciple of Tian Yu sect were basically confirmed that there was a large inheritance place was where at least had three inheritances. After we pass through the big battle, we would dissolution. It was your luck for obtain inheritance.\u201d Zhao Youdao was also very honest that he did not say what benefits to give. After all, it was a great advantage for them to enter the inheritance place.He was also not worried that Xu Ziyan would refuse. Entering a large-scale inheritance meant that the chances of being passed on would increase a lot. No one would refuse such an opportunity. For cultivators, the chance was more important than the cultivation.\u201cWell! I agree.\u201d Xu Ziyan agreed without any consideration. He would never miss this opportunity.Zhao Youdao was very happy to receive a confirmed answer. Although it was still half a month away from the end of the secret realm of Qingling, who knew when Zhao would meet the next person in such big place? Being able to solve the problem of lacking people at one time could also give them more opportunities to choose inheritance. It was necessary to know that it needed time to accept the inheritance. If it was not enough time to accept the inheritance, it would definitely make people die.Xu Ziyan couldn\u2019t see the depth of Zhao Youdao, which meat that Zhao was at least had a mid-term foundation building\u2019s cultivation. Although Ziyan had been behind Zhao Youdao, he had carefully kept a certain distance.Although the probability was very low, Ziyan would not rule out that Zhao Youdao was a madman who wanted to ambush their brothers. Therefore, Ziyan deliberately made a small distance with Xu Zirong, so that if Zhao Youdao made a surprise attack, at least Xu Zirong would had a certain reaction time.Of course, Xu Ziyan\u2019s idea was met by Xu Zirong\u2019s rebellion, but this weak resistance was quickly taken over by Xu Ziyan. He was very fond of his brother, but once it came to about the safety of Xu Zirong, it was not good to do anything about spoiled!Zhao Youdao had no objection to Xu Ziyan\u2019s alert. If he encountered such a thing, he wouldn\u2019t certainly blindly believe in each other.The secret realm of Qingling was so vast. In addition to the disciples who had brought by the elders of the sects, there would be devils cultivation here occasionally. Although there were restrictions on access, everyone\u2019s cultivation was below the foundation-building period, and it had no problem for one in the later foundation building period to ambushed two in early foundation-building period.Zhao Youdao actually told a lie. He met another person before he met Xu Ziyan. But Zhao had never seen that person, and the breath on the other side made Zhao feel uncomfortable, so he simply gave up and he didn\u2019t even touch that person and passed by.Although Zhao was much older than Xu Ziyan, he was also a real cultivator in late foundation-building period, even if someone was a devil cultivator, he must also measure it while doing something on Zhao.As what Zhao expected, that person did not entangle with him, and immediately passed away even without a far-away greeting. At the same time, Zhao Youdao was more convinced of his own judgment that at least the person was a devil cultivator with the possibility of 80%.It was said that the secret realm of Qingling was not absolutely safe, because there existed devil cultivators. Devil cultivators could always be synonymous with evil. They would kill people and rob treasures, and even kill people just because they were unhappy.Zhao Youdao was actually quite fortunate, because he stood behind the elders of the sect before entering the passage, so when the people of the Liu Guang sect entered the passage, he saw it very clearly.The Xu brothers were remembered by Zhao at that time. After all, Xu Zirong was so young that he had already reached the foundation building, who had absolutely amazing performance.Zhao Youdao was very enthusiastic about chatting with Xu Ziyan on this road. It was definitely the elite of each sect that had the opportunity to enter here.As a head disciple of Xiao Yuan sect, he would almost certainly inherit Xiao Yuan sect in the future. At this time, it was definitely a profitable business to make good relations with other powerful cultivator.Xu Ziyan did not reject the goodwill of Zhao Youdao. He also knew that there were many roads for multiple friends. There was absolutely no way for a single person to live in this world.He and Zhao Youdao chatted very well together; Zhao was also chipper, so soon the two would be called Xu brother and Zhao brother.When Xu Ziyan and Zhao Youdao chatted happily, Xu Zirong looked gloomy at Zhao Youdao\u2019s back. Due to his brother\u2019s orders, Zirong had to make a certain distance from his brother, so he could not participate in their topic at all. He could only stare at the two people with resentful looking.\u201cHow weird! It\u2019s like spring all the year round in the secret realm of Qingling. How did I suddenly feel that there was a chill? Did you feel it? Xu brother?\u201d Zhao Youdao suddenly quivered and then looked around with confusion.\u201cWell? Cold? No? Zhao brother, you won\u2019t be infected with chill.\u201d Xu Ziyan laughed while talking. It was his habitual inquiry but Ziyan forgot cultivators would not be sick.Zhao Youdao heard the words and laughed. He thought it as a joke, and soon he left the cold behind.The three flew for a long time, finally saw a high mountain far away. The mountain was magnificent. A white waterfall rushed down from the top of the mountain and fell into the deep water, which inspired spray.\u201cWe arrived; our destination was behind the waterfall.\u201d Zhao Youdao pointed at the silver-white waterfall.Xu Ziyan nodded. The closer he was to the waterfall, the more he could feel a faint summoning. This was the unique feeling in the inheritance place. Anyone who had a Qingling imprint in the body would have this feeling when he was in a certain range near the inheritance place.Since the inheritance place was not a falsification, the possiblity of Zhao Youdao\u2019s cheat was less, and Xu Zirong also told Ziyan that after his communication with the surrounding plants, only three people passed through here.Confirming Zhao Youdao\u2019s credibility, Xu Ziyan was obviously more enthusiastic. For a friendly righteous disciple, Ziyan certainly couldn\u2019t show any defence against strangers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The entrance was slightly humid because of the splashing water, and it was covered with moss, but once you entered it, you would find that the cave was very dry and that there were very obvious artificial traces.Zhao Youdao led the way ahead, he wanted to show Xu Ziyan that there wasn\u2019t any danger. Xu Ziyan and Xu Zirong followed behind him and walked for a while. After passing a turn, their eyes suddenly widened, since there was a big empty hall.There was a dark gate in the hall, and next to the gate, there were two young cultivators.Xu Ziyan narrowed his eyes slightly and wondered if he saw an illusion. How come he found the cultivator in front of him so familiar?It wasn\u2019t until he got closer that he could clearly see the man\u2019s appearance.Gosh! He\u2019s one of the lovers of Bai Hua!How could he\u2026wait, Lin Xiaotian was a disciple of the Tian Yu sect, he would certainly join events like entering the Green Spiritual Secret Realm.While he lived on this small island, the distance between Tian Yu sect and Liu Guang sect were a bit far away. Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t notice at all that Lin Xiaotian was among all the disciples.However, Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t mean to be close with him at all. Actually, if they weren\u2019t interested in the same place of inheritance, he would\u2019ve turned around and left at once.There was a young girl in white clothes behind him. She was about 15 or 16 years old and seemed a little arrogant.Xu Ziyan touched his chin and thought deeply. If he guessed correctly, this should be the famous \u201cvicious female lead\u201d in the novel. Later, after she had set up a trap for Bai Hua, her Dantian was destroyed by the furious Lin Xiaotian. Since she had lost all her cultivation, she couldn\u2019t bear it and went insane. Her senior grandfather was also killed when he seeked revenge from Lin Xiaotian.Well\u2026that\u2019s such a familiar plot.\u201cCome on, cultivator Xu, let me introduce someone to you. This is Lin Xiaotian from the Tian Yu sect, and this is his junior sister, Mo Xueyan, cultivator Mo.\u201d After Zhao Youdao turned his head, he introduced the Xu brothers to Lin Xiaotian and Mo Xueyan as well.Now the five people have gathered together. All of them were in the first stage of foundation building except Zhao Youdao. Although Zhao Youdao was at the later stage of foundation building, he was alone.The three parties have basically maintained a balance, so that they could guarantee each other\u2019s safety.Xu Ziyan politely greeted Lin Xiaotian. Although Mo Xueyan looked proud, she was still nice to the disciples from such a big sect as Liu Guang.After some simple greetings from both sides, they shifted their attention to the black gate again. After all, the biggest purpose of their trip was to gain inheritance. Seeing such a large place of inheritance in front of them, they lost interest in making friends now.\u201cBrother Xu, let\u2019s get started without delay.\u201d\u201cGood,\u201d Xu Ziyan agreed immediately. Initially, their main purpose was to inherit, so they naturally didn\u2019t want to waste any more time.\u201cThis way.\u201d Zhao Youdao guided them to the side of the gate. They couldn\u2019t find it from a distance. The ground on the side of the gate was covered with five colorful stone slabs. These slabs had formed a reincarnation array in the order of the five elements, and each slab was engraved with a small footprint.\u201cBrother Xu can pick one randomly. I have stepped on these slates and there wasn\u2019t any danger, but there were only three of us, so we couldn\u2019t open the big array at all,\u201d Zhao Youdao explained in detail.Xu Ziyan picked a red slab and Xu Zirong picked a green one. The rest of them chose the remaining ones.\u201cPlease input spiritual power into your stone slab,\u201d Zhao Youdao said loudly.They followed suit and the five slabs began to radiate light.These lights got stronger and stronger.Eventually, two giant palms formed on their heads. The giant palms slowly stretched out and stuck on the black gate, which opened in response, revealing a wide passage.\u201cOkay!\u201d Zhao Youdao said excitedly, \u201cLet\u2019s enter!\u201dXu Ziyan and the others all jumped off the stone slabs and rushed towards the black gate.Without their spiritual power, the stone slabs dimmed again, and the giant palms began to disappear; the black gate was about to close.The five of them rushed into the black gate together. Then in a blink of an eye the gate slammed shut, leaving no gap.\u201cHaha, we\u2019re quite lucky,\u201d Zhao Youdao said with a cheerful expression, and the others were all smiling too.Perhaps because it was a large place of inheritance with many treasures, the specifications for opening the gate were not that strict. It only required five cultivators. If it had required one of them to have a specific spiritual root, then they could only watch this rare opportunity slip away.\u201cEveryone, since we\u2019re already here, let\u2019s try our best from now on,\u201d Zhao Youdao said with a bow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Regarding inheritance, luck plays a major role. If one does not meet the requirements of the cultivator\u2019s inheritance, there was no way one could get it. And since it was something that people can\u2019t really compete for, there was simply no competition. Aside from fighting for personal reasons, no one would try to kill each other in this place of inheritance.Zhao Youdao was a cultivator in the late stage of foundation building. After he finished speaking, he started walking towards the passage. It was a very wide one, and there were even lights on both sides, not depressing at all.Zhao Youdao found an intersection not far away. He thought for a while before walking towards the intersection. Then the entrance of it quickly disappeared, leaving only a smooth wall. Afterwards, another intersection opened on the opposite wall.Lin Xiaotian and Xu Ziyan were unfamiliar with each other and didn\u2019t have much to say. So Lin Xiaotian waved his hand at Xu Ziyan then left with his junior sister. Xu Ziyan stayed for a while after they went, then he left with Xu Zirong as well.There was absolutely no danger in the place of inheritance. This was a fact recognized by all people who have entered the Green Spiritual Secret Realm.Because of this, Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t feel nervous. While walking with Xu Zirong, he looked at the murals along the passage.Whether it was Zhao Youdao or Lin Xiaotian, their goal were the powerful inheritances; they weren\u2019t interested in the murals at all. Only Xu Ziyan was really interested in them, but it wasn\u2019t because he was artistic. Instead, his attention was drawn to a story of a cultivator with thunder spiritual roots.Starting from the first mural at the entrance, it described the magnificent life of this cultivator. According to Xu Ziyan\u2019s conclusion, this is a story of a person at the lowest level of society, who then got rich and married a beauty.Of course, there were still various kinds of hardships and experiences, but every crisis had brought great opportunities to this cultivator in the end. To put it simply, if someone would turn these murals into a novel of cultivation, it might get the highest number of clicks.If these were merely murals, Xu Ziyan wouldn\u2019t be so interested in them. However, he had already noticed from the beginning that there was a sign of lightning on the clothes and the belly of the cultivator.At first, he thought it was just a pattern on the clothes, but when he noticed the same sign was on the clothes he was wearing or on his belly, he felt that something was wrong.Logically, the sign should be in a conspicuous place. If it had appeared on the waist, Xu Ziyan would naturally think that it was just a mark. However, it was always on the belly, and no one could possibly draw such a sign on his clothes in an area like this.What succeeded in solving Xu Ziyan\u2019s confusion was a mural near the end of the story. On that mural, the cultivator was fighting a huge nine-tailed demon fox. The cultivator was unable to resist the power of that fox. There was also a huge city behind him, in which there were a lot of people. Apparently, even if that cultivator was beaten by the fox, he still might be able to escape, but the people in the city would surely die.As the protagonist of this mural, the cultivator could not escape. Therefore, in the next mural, he pulled out the lightning mark from his belly, and threw the mark at the demon fox. The demon fox was frightened and turned into ashes after being hit by the lightning mark.In the next mural, the lightning mark was still there, but it was obviously much smaller than in the previous murals. It seemed that there was a great negative impact on the lightning mark after defeating the demon fox.The following murals depicted the cultivator looking for the same lightning mark in several places. Then he merged those marks with his own so as to strengthen it.The combination of these murals made Xu Ziyan think of the Green Spiritual thunder in his Dantian. Since he was foundation building, the Green Spiritual thunder in his body had stopped growing. The size of it was enough given his current level of cultivation, but soon it wouldn\u2019t be enough if his cultivation level went higher.Moreover, because of the Green Spiritual thunder, he couldn\u2019t practice other spells at all, which also affected his performance.Through these murals, he vaguely felt that the Green Spiritual thunder in his body should also be able to devour other thunder-type powers to strengthen himself.Gradually, he reached the end of the story.According to the general ending of novels, this cultivator would naturally ascend to Heaven, but on the last mural, the cultivator took out the thunder inside his body and put it in a box.Xu Ziyan was greatly surprised at the ending of this story, as the cultivator ended up sitting there and died, not becoming an immortal.\u201cThis story is so strange.\u201d Xu Zirong had been following behind his brother, and when he saw his brother looking at the last mural, he made the comment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Making the connection between that and the Green Spiritual thunder in his brother Dantian, he started flipping through his own memories to find information or tale he might have heard related to secret realm which would hold a treasure like divine thunder.The end of the story had also taken him by surprise. No one would probably predict an ending like that.\u201cBrother\u2026 do you think the box would be here, in the legendary grounds?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible\u2026\u201d Touching the box on the mural painting, a slight rise beneath his fingertips made him hesitate.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Noticing his brother\u2019s reaction, Xu Zirong asked out of curiosity.\u201cNothing, it\u2019s just\u2026 it seems like\u2026\u201d Pressing the risen area, there didn\u2019t seem to be any reaction.A little disappointed, Xu Ziyan laughed out loud at himself. The cultivator\u2019s divine thunder must be extremely impressive. How could he expect the hidden box to be found so easily?Glancing at the mural painting one last time, he turned around, then suddenly felt the hairs stand up on the back of his neck.The box was gone!He whipped around, staring at the painting. It was just like he\u2019d thought he had seen it. The box that the cultivator was preparing to hide had disappeared. The man\u2019s hands were empty.\u201cHow?\u201d Xu Ziyan exclaimed in shock. He touched the mural again, where the box had been was smooth now.\u201cImpossible!\u201d He began to inspect the wall more closely. But no matter how much he searched, he couldn\u2019t find the risen area again.It was positively haunted. He was sure he wasn\u2019t seeing things. The person in the painting had been holding a black box, but now the painting was intact as before, just without the box.Other than that, for some reason, he felt like there was something else odd about the painting, but he just couldn\u2019t name it.\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d Xu Zirong pulled on his brother\u2019s sleeve.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Xu Ziyan asked, turning around.Xu Zirong pointed at the painting, his face twisted into an odd expression.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Xu Ziyan asked again, looking in the direction he was pointing. He was pointing at the cultivator.\u201cHis\u2026 eyes\u2026\u201d Xu Zirong\u2019s tone was shaken.Looking where he was pointing, Xu Ziyan discovered what was wrong. In the original painting, the cultivator was looking squarely at the box while trying to hide it. But now his hands were empty and his face turned toward them, black eyes fixed in the direction they were standing, like he was looking out of the wall at them.Xu Ziyan shuddered, opening his eyes wide to stare at the painting. And that\u2019s when he saw the man in the painting smile slowly!What the hell! Were they in a horror movie?The hairs were standing up for sure now on the back of Xu Ziyan\u2019s neck. He never believed in ghosts or spirits, but for something like that to happen in a dim tunnel like this was incredibly creepy.Swallowing hard, he stared harder at the smile of the man. The corners of the person\u2019s mouth curved higher and higher, until his expression was one of him bursting into laughter.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Somewhere in the dim tunnel, someone was laughing.\u201cWhat the hell is that!\u201d Already extremely nervous, Xu Ziyan literally jumped where he was standing, letting out his thunder snake move without hesitation.This time it was even more exaggerated than when he met the cave bats. Ten purple streaks of lightning as thick as his forearm scattered and exploded, letting out a tremendous sound.\u201cHahaha! Finally, someone has discovered my treasure!\u201d The voice finally stopped laughing. \u201cBy the time you hear this, I\u2019ll be long dead. But no matter. Everyone dies, and I have no intention to be immortal. Almost ten thousand years of life is more than enough.\u201dThe voice was low but free-spirited, with a casual tone. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking so closely at the wall painting, you must also be a thunder cultivator. Plus, the fact that you found the secret within, you must be interested in the box. Heh, I knew the person to inherit my secrets must be a smart one. If you can uncover those mysteries, I think fate has brought us together. How could I let someone fated to find my treasure go home empty handed?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can give you the box. But are you sure you want it? If you are, press the box in the second to last painting. If not, you can give up. After all, my gift is a little special, not everyone can handle it. So think about it on your own. If you don\u2019t make a choice I\u2019ll assume you\u2019ve given up and everything will return to place. There will also be no possibility of this painting opening up again. What about that? Think about it long and hard.\u201d\u201cOh, and about the gain and loss thing. Of course you\u2019ll be gaining my box. As for the price, I\u2019ll play the suspense card and just say you\u2019ll find out when you get the box. And finally\u2026 did I get you with the painting or not? Hahahaha\u2026 I thought a long time to come up with this idea, even asked a brother to help me make the painting. Hahaha\u2026 you must be cursing me right about now. Well, it doesn\u2019t matter anyways if you go home with the box. Plus, I can\u2019t hear you anyways. Hahaha\u2026\u201dHearing the final whooping laugh, both Xu Ziyan and Xu Zirong were exasperated. This elder really loved to play pranks. Given the 'sense of humor\u201d of this cultivator, Xu Ziyan was worried he left some kind of surprise in that box too.\u201cBrother, do you want the box?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d Xu Ziyan nodded. The cultivator\u2019s words were correct. Not just everyone could be able to handle the contents of that box. But now he had the right conditions, if he didn\u2019t take the box he would regret it forever.In terms of gain and loss, he didn\u2019t have too much concern about it. That\u2019s the thing about opportunity. Having two birds in the forest wasn\u2019t worth much compared to one bird in his hand. As long as he could figure out the \u201cgain\u201d, he could figure out the rest of the situation too.Reaching out, he pressed the box in the painting next to him.The cultivator in the final painting raised a hand slowly with a thumbs up. Then he pointed below him. In the direction he was pointing there was a thud as a green brick popped out of the corner of the wall.Bending over, Xu Ziyan pulled the green brick away, revealing a dark opening. He reached inside and grabbed a box about the size of his palm.Looking at the little black box, he smiled. In his previous life he\u2019d never experienced something like this. Seems like even if he didn\u2019t follow the path laid out for him he still had decent luck.\u201cCongratulations on obtaining the inheritance,\u201d Xu Zirong said with a grin.\u201cHaha, let\u2019s celebrate together.\u201d Xu Ziyan couldn\u2019t help but laugh with the box in his hands. Who would think that just looking at a wall painting was enough for him to get this inheritance that was perfect for him?\u201cAren\u2019t you going to open it up?\u201d\u201cWhy not? There\u2019s no one here anyways.\u201d Laughing, he opened the box.And that\u2019s when it happened. A shadowy figure shot out of the wooden box. Xu Ziyan only had to gesture for a small thunder streak to shoot out after it.Boom!The shadow fell on the floor.When the two brothers looked down to see what it was, both of them were immediately exasperated. Lying on the floor was a lovingly carved wooden mouse. There was an additional lid inside of the box with a spring trap. The moment someone opened the box the mouse would jump out, scaring anyone who opened the box.Due to the thunder Xu Ziyan had released, the mouse had been burnt black and was good for nothing more than trash.\u201cHaha, did you like that? Relax, this is the final surprise!\u201d A man\u2019s voice suddenly rang from the box.Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t know what to say anymore to this humorous cultivator\u2026Whatever. They\u2019d taken his inheritance, after all. It wasn\u2019t anything to get up in arms about.Comforting himself like this, he opened up the second lid on the box. When he saw what was inside, he couldn\u2019t disguise his excitement. He had been right after all. What was in the box was a Green Spiritual Thunder. It was tied to the bottom of the box with a red string. How odd was that, the cultivator had been able to find such a string to contain the thunder.After inspecting for a while, he tucked it away.A single streak of purple lightning was incredibly valuable. Thinking about how such a large sect as their own only had one Green Spiritual Thunder made this evident.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now the square had expanded in size, with more mobility too. Putting it by his side, he could stuff things into it easily.With this kind of harvest before even entering the land of inheritance, Xu Ziyan was incredibly excited. There were only a few places with such history in the Green Spirit Hidden Realm. Legend had it that one elder female disciple had accepted three inheritances in one visitation. If she hadn\u2019t run out of time and had to leave, she might even have accepted more.The brothers walked along the pathway for a while longer before discovering a forking path. Because they weren\u2019t going to separate, both of them took the smaller road.When they walked along the path, the entrance to the road disappeared just like before. The wall before them formed another forked path. Out walked Zhao Youdao, who looked extremely disappointed.Glancing around, he realized he was still walking the same path. Although he hadn\u2019t succeeded in inheriting anything, he found his confidence quickly again. Most of this was a matter of luck anyways. Since there were at least three inheritances to be had here, he could always try again if he missed anything.Walking along the path that seemed not to have an end, he quickly discovered another fork in the road. He gave himself a little pat on the back before walking forward again.Time passed quickly like that. Zhao Youdao, Lin Xiaotian, and the Xu brothers kept attempting to accept new inheritances. It was a place for inheritances after all, and there were so many that all of them were almost going crazy with excitement.Although every inheritance placed different demands upon their inheritors, the fact that there were dozens of them meant that no one in the group returned empty handed. Except for Xu Ziyan.Yes, Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t manage to inherit anything. What a sad story, right?But Xu Ziyan understood clearly that the reason he didn\u2019t was because the thunder cultivator from before.The price of what he gained\u2026he finally understood. Of course the gain was the box, and the loss was that he wouldn\u2019t be able to inherit any of the learnings in this ground.Perhaps the thunder cultivator had some kind of bad reputation among these cultivators, none of them were opening up to him. Most inheritances required a medium. If you didn\u2019t pass once approaching the medium, it would reject you. Xu Ziyan, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t even approach the medium, meaning he didn\u2019t even qualify to try\u2026\u201cI guess he meant what he said,\u201d Xu Ziyan said with a bitter smile. In the end, it seemed like he had received a decent harvest anyways. He had managed to find a complete Purple Spiritual Thunder. Xu Zirong had found a female cultivator\u2019s Usnea Dance. This was a set of light, elegant body work that could improve one\u2019s own dodging. When employing this dance, you could also trigger the plant-based spiritual energy around you, tripling the effect of your own plant-based spells.Xu Zirong was a little conflicted about inheriting something like this. Although in his previous life he had been slender and elegant, the Usnea Dance was obviously something for a female cultivator. He had no idea what the hell the specific requirements for inheritance were that he ended up with it.The least convenient part about this inheritance ground was that before you found an inheritance you had no idea what you might get, and when it started you couldn\u2019t stop. Thankfully, you were ultimately the owner of whatever you might inherit. If you really ended up hating it, you could always not use it.Overall, they ended up with good results. The only regret was that because they entered separately from Zhao Youdao and Lin Xiaotian, they also didn\u2019t end up being able to meet at the end.Xu Ziyan had a good impression toward Zhao Youdao, and was interested in talking with him. As for Lin Xiaotian, he didn\u2019t have such intentions at all. The only reason he\u2019d want to get to know him better was to use him as a radar so he could avoid bumping into Bai Hua directly. Originally Lin Xiaotian was the first to encounter Bai Hua. Whenever Bai Hua appeared alongside Lin Xiaotian, Xu Ziyan did his best to avoid him, especially avoiding the protagonist aura he had.Speaking of which, in his past life Bai Hua was incredibly impressive. Even the cold-hearted Lin Xiaotian couldn\u2019t avoid his traps laid in the name of love. In the end he was even willing to share him with two other men. Even now Xu Ziyan found that kind of thing shocking.Lin Xiaotian was cold and domineering, Mo Ziyuan was tender and clever. Although his original personality was more silent, he still didn\u2019t have much to say about Bai Hua. In a way, Bai Hua had a handle on almost all types of men\u2026Well, perhaps not every type. At least the Xu Zirong, with his wicked charm, didn\u2019t fall for him. But his final outcome in that story was being killed by all four of them and tortured for such a long time\u2026Although he knew this life\u2019s development was going to be completely different, just imagining his own cute little brother ending up like that in that novel made it difficult for Xu Ziyan to like Bai Hua at all.No matter how righteous, grand he might have been described in the novel, combined with his old memories, Bai Hua was clearly not the person described there.Right now Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t have any interested in investigating what kind of person Bai Hua was. From his point of view, he didn\u2019t plan on having more interaction with that person in this life. He could do whatever he wanted as long as he left them alone.A pity that reality never went along with what people wished for. Xu Ziyan\u2019s thoughts were destined not to become reality.\u201cBig Brother, I feel the Green Spirit Mark summoning.\u201d\u201cAbout time. We were in there for so long I can\u2019t even keep track of time anymore.\u201d Xu Ziyan shifted his body around a little. The final part of the tunnel was quite narrow, and he had a difficult time walking around inside.\u201cBrother, this means at most there are seven more days before these grounds close down. Should we go back now?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go back. We still don\u2019t know how far we are from the meeting point. Plus, didn\u2019t Master say? The point only opens once a day. If we end up delaying longer and not making it out then that\u2019ll be awful.\u201d Xu Ziyan said with a chuckle.\u201cYou have a point.\u201d Xu Zirong thought about it for a moment before completely abandoning the idea of continuing to seek out other inheritance grounds. Honestly he didn\u2019t really care about inheritances here at all. With high level spells like the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, those inheritances didn\u2019t really matter to him.His only regret was that his brother didn\u2019t receive any inheritances this time. Of course the Purple Spiritual Thunder was a great find, but it was a single complete streak. With Xu Ziyan\u2019s current strength, if he wanted to consume the thing he could only end up exploding from the sheer energy contained within.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad you didn\u2019t receive any inheritances\u2026\u201d Xu Zirong said in a low voice.Xu Ziyan gave him a rub on the head. \u201cI\u2019ve got the Purple Spiritual Thunder though. That\u2019s no worse than an inheritance.\u201dXu Zirong still felt a little regretful, but he also knew you couldn\u2019t force this kind of thing.Crunch. Crunch.While the two brothers were gazing at each other quietly, this unharmonious sound issued from above Xu Zirong\u2019s shoulder.Since they encountered this rabbit, the sound had never stopped. Xu Ziyan even doubted that the rabbit\u2019s little space was stuffed with rabbit.It was a very subtle existence. Most of the time the two of them would forget it was even there, other than the relentless crunching.There was nothing special about the rabbit either. Other than eating carrots, it didn\u2019t seem to have any skills.The oddest part was that in the past Xu Zirong would never allow a pink rabbit to slump over his shoulder and eat continuously. But somehow he had endless patience for this rabbit. Perhaps his instinct was telling him not to mess with this rabbit, so he let it make a home on his shoulder\u2013since it wasn\u2019t heavy anyways.Following the guidance of the Green Spiritual Mark, they spent about a day to find the meetup point. These points were similar to small transportation spells, able to transport them close to the entrance tunnel.The meetup point they had arrived at was pretty much deserted. Other than the two brothers, the only other person was a man in black, standing there in silence.After glancing at him, Xu Ziyan pulled Xu Zirong aside and backed away a few steps. The man\u2019s features were actually quite handsome, but there was just a hint of wickedness hidden in the corner of his eyes and in his smile. His eyes were slender and tapered with a little too much seductive energy that screamed beware to any decent women.Seeing Xu Ziyan\u2019s reaction, the man chuckled. But perhaps because the two of them were too similar in power, and the Green Spiritual Realm was about to close, he didn\u2019t seem inclined to start anything.The two parties waited in silence until the meeting point started to flash with a white light.The man in black stepped in first. Before he disappeared, he mouthed something to them.We\u2019ll see each other again, beauty.In an instant Xu Ziyan was angered. What a bastard! If he hadn\u2019t ran so fast, he would beat him up! My brother is only twelve, what are you planning!Positively disgusting pervert!While Xu Ziyan was busy steaming, Xu Zirong\u2019s expression was also frighteningly dark. His brother had misunderstood, but he could understand what was going on here. The final line was directed at his brother. In other words, he was interested in his brother, not him.More importantly, he recognized this man!His name was Duan Muning, and he was an infamous pervert among cultivators!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In his words, these kind of men are more long-lasting on bed.In his last life, he had a relationship with this person. Later, it\u2019s said that he had kidnapped a right-path cultivator, and was soon assassinated by the sect in which that cultivator belonged to. In the end, no one knew where he\u2019d gone to. When his bloody demon palace was intruded, he still hadn\u2019t heard from this person.It was also mentioned that someone had seen Duan Muning and that right-path cultivator hiding on a little island in outer sea, but this had nothing to do with Xu Zirong.Originally, he was purely cautious to this person, but after seeing his attitude to his brother\u2026Xu Zirong felt a strong sense of murder, his pupils turned into dark red. If he had a chance, he\u2019d kill this person who looked at his brother secretly.\u201cZirong! You have to be careful when you see this person again. If you see him doing anything shady, just kill him directly.\u201d Xu Ziyan said so, with his facial expression as dark as clouds.Damn it! Pervert! Pedophile! God knows how many people he\u2019d hurt already! If he saw this person ever again, he\u2019d definitely kill him for righteousness! Xu Ziyan thought so resentfully.Xu Zirong nodded gently, but he was amused by his brother\u2019s slow reactions. It turned out that his brother thought that person was interested in Zirong himself, but it\u2019s okay, at least he knew that Xu Ziyan had nothing against same-sex relationships.The two boarded on the transportation array, and after a beam of white light flashed, they came in front of a huge vortex. This is the place where they enter the Green Spiritual Secret Realm. Once they passed through this passage, they would appear again in the Xuanyu Realm where they left.Several cultivators gathered near the passage. This trip to the Green Spiritual Secret Realm was a reunion of the elite disciples of the major sects. Among them, it is likely that there would be leaders of different sects in the future.These cultivators were also willing to make friends with each other, the atmosphere in the Green Spiritual Secret Realm was therefore quite peaceful overall.Xu Ziyan hadn\u2019t noticed that among the people who gathered, there was a handsome man in white clothes who looked at him secretly from time to time.That person was exactly Bai Hua, who was rescued by Xu Ziyan once. Now, he was standing with a disciple of Tian Yu sect, who had an enthusiastic attitude. If anyone came closer, he would even hear that person inviting Bai Hua to Tian Yu sect as a guest.Although Bai Hua had a smile on his face, he was already feeling a bit annoyed. Although the person in front of him was from Tian Yu sect, his status wasn\u2019t that high. It\u2019s all because of luck that he could enter the Green Spiritual Secret Realm.Bai Hua had no intention to hook up with such a \u201cproduct\u201d. Since this person was over 30 years old and he\u2019d just started building base, Bai Hua was certain that he couldn\u2019t have any great development in the future.Bai Hua was very ambitious. After he discovered the secret of the dragon-shaped jade, he felt that he was the lucky one favored by God. Even a piece of jade that he\u2019d bought inadvertently could bring him such enormous power.Although he had no true blood of the dragon, and the jade wasn\u2019t completely activated, whatever that\u2019d been exposed already made him thrilled enough.After the verification of the jade, he realized that he had even possessed a rare Taoist body of an elite core. This body was born as a fine tool of double cultivation. Through continuous double cultivation with a human being, that person\u2019s cultivation speed would be as high as that of someone with divine spiritual roots.Moreover, this Taoist body would not absorb the other person\u2019s cultivation practices like those evil methods, but it would allow both parties to make progress together. That is to say, he did not have to worry about being killed as a demon cultivator.As for double cultivation, it was more like a means for him. As long as he was strong enough, he didn\u2019t care who he\u2019d sleep with.Besides, double cultivation is usually beneficial for both parties. It\u2019s entirely understandable if he wanted to choose a handsome man with impressive power, and one that could protect him.Such as\u2026Xu Ziyan of the Liu Guang sect.Bai Hua\u2019s eyes flashed, and his half-down eyelashes had covered his ambitions. Only a tall and handsome talent would make his heart beat faster. If Xu Ziyan agreed to be with him, it would be beneficial to both of them, right?Bai Hua glanced at Xu Ziyan quietly again, and immediately looked away. That Xu Zirong was just too annoying, he\u2019d never seen such an annoying one before.Unfortunatly, Xu Ziyan loved his brother a lot. If he approached now, it\u2019d certainly not look good.But it wouldn\u2019t matter. His brother was only 12 years old and it\u2019s normal Xu Ziyan to take care of him. However, he couldn\u2019t take care of him forever. Sooner or later, the two of them would be separated, and at that time\u2026Bai Hua raised his hand to touch the jade in front of his neck and revealed a smile as if he was saying that he\u2019d surely win. Not only would his Taoist body of elite core help him to cultivate, but it would make his admirer more infatuated with him. Once he slept with Xu Ziyan, there\u2019s basically nothing that Xu Zirong could do, as Xu Ziyan would turn against him at that time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although it was not as good as the demon cultivators who\u2019d cultivated the practices of attraction, he had this natural temptation to the others. It would only make the others like him more without themselves knowing.Seeing that Bai Hua was not angry, the cultivator smiled at him, but couldn\u2019t help but blush even more. He couldn\u2019t utter a word for a pretty long time.While Bai Hua was talking to the cultivator, Xu Ziyan also saw several cultivators of the Liu Guang Sect.He wasn\u2019t familiar with those senior brothers and sisters, but Le Hu\u2019s very special style and his half naked appearance made him stand out among all the cultivators who were dressed properly.When Xu Zirong saw Le Hu, he lightly frowned. It\u2019s so annoying, this person came to share his brother\u2019s attention again.\u201cHey, Le Hu, how is it going? Have you got any gains?\u201d Xu Ziyan greeted with a smile.When Le Hu saw Xu Ziyan, his eyes lit up. He had nothing in common with the same group of disciples who joined the Liu Guang sect, let alone those senior brothers and sisters.He ran over happily, scratched his head, and said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky, since I\u2019ve got an inheritance.\u201dXu Ziyan did not continue to ask in detail. Because of the private nature of the inheritance, many people took them as their last card. No one would be stupid enough to reveal it unless absolutely necessary. And a person must be stupid enough also to ask what the inheritance another cultivator has obtained.\u201cLook at you, you\u2019re already thrilled like this after having one inheritance.\u201d There was an extremely proud voice from Xu Ziyan.Le Hu\u2019s facial expression darkened, while Xu Ziyan could only smile helplessly.Wei Qing still looked arrogant, and he didn\u2019t hide his look of sarcasm to Le Hu a bit.Xu Ziyan felt puzzled and confused. Obviously, Wei Qing was usually arrogant and he didn\u2019t like to talk to most of the people. How come his sarcastic skills would be activated whenever he saw Le Hu?\u201cAre you looking for a fight again?\u201d Le Hu was clumsy in words and he didn\u2019t like to argue. In his opinion, it\u2019s better to fight than to waste time on words and argument.Within their barbarians, once disputes arise, most of them are resolved by fists. The fist has the absolute authority and that\u2019s what they believe in.Seeing Le Hu rubbing his fists and ready to fight, Wei Qing\u2019s facial expression turned dark. He suddenly remembered getting a black eye a month ago. Although it wasn\u2019t a big injury, for someone like him, hurting his face would hurt him more than being physically injured.\u201cWhy? Do you want it as well? I will accompany you to the end.\u201d Wei Qing said coldly, and his aura began to fluctuate, it seemed that he would start fighting at any moment.Xu Ziyan was speechless. When he was listening to the whispering of people around him, he didn\u2019t hesitate to reward them with some chestnut, \u201cfighting is so addictive, right? Since you like fighting so much, you can fight as much as you want when you return. Are you anxious to let others to know that you\u2019re from the Liu Guang sect? And that you dare to fight here?\u201dLe Hu massaged his temples, grinning his teeth as he was too furious to speak. Wei Qing was still acting coldly. Xu Ziyan wasn\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s an illusion, but he felt that there\u2019s a hint of sadness in Wei Qing\u2019s eyes.Xu Zirong stood quietly behind Xu Ziyan, holding Xu Ziyan\u2019s shirt tightly. Although his expression was still cold, his raised lips and eyebrows had told people obviously that he\u2019s very happy at that moment.\u201cLook at you both, how old are you now? How come you\u2019re acting like a kid? And comparing to Zirong, you guys aren\u2019t even kids! You even started arguing for such small stuff, are you both only two years old or what?\u201d Xu Ziyan pulled both to a corner and started scolding them, as if he wanted to train them to be better. He was confused, as he thought cultivators should mature earlier than ordinary people in this dangerous environment. How come this is not the case for Le Hu and Wei Qing?Or, he only happened to see these two naughty kids coincidentally\u2026Otherwise, they just became naughty when they saw each other\u2026Therefore, it\u2019d be themselves who didn\u2019t want a harmonious environment\u2026After listening to Xu Ziyan comparing himself with Le Hu and Wei Qing, Xu Zirong immediately behaved better. He was standing obediently behind his brother and didn\u2019t say anything further. When his brother wasn\u2019t looking, he\u2019d reveal a sarcastic smile to Le Hu and Wei Qing.Le Hu, Wei Qing, \u201c\u2026\u201dHaving an injury on his head, after Wei Qing and Le Hu were scolded and lectured by Xu Ziyan, they two became more obedient finally.They were following Xu Ziyan like a fool and they headed to the place where the Liu Guang sect gathered. Actually, one of them was proud and the other one arrogant, they had no idea why they were doing what they were doing. Among the disciples of the same age, they were supposed to be the elites.But when they were with Xu Ziyan, they would always subconsciously reveal their childish side.They were looking at each other as if they were ready to kill. And when they raised their head, they instantly saw Xu Ziyan glaring at them sharply.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Afterwards, they each took an arrogant and a stern attitude and followed Xu Ziyan behind.\u201cBrother Qilian, how was your gain this time?\u201d From afar, Xu Ziyan greeted Qilian Hongyun.Qilian Hongyun smiled, \u201cit\u2019s just alright.\u201dXu Ziyan didn\u2019t continue to ask. Initially, they were just saying hello to each other. If he didn\u2019t want to talk any further, he wouldn\u2019t find it offensive.The rabbit on Xu Zirong\u2019s shoulder was still chewing carrots, it didn\u2019t care about anything that happened around them.No one knew that in a particular corner, a man in white clothes was looking at Wei Qing with panic. He was holding a hot dragon-shaped jade\u2026In this trip to the Green Spiritual Secret Realm, basically, every sect had their particular gains. The leading seniors could basically tell what their disciples had gained from their facial expressions. Sometimes, when a disciple showed a frustrated look, the others would find it quite rare\u2026After the seniors greeted chatted with each other for a bit after coming out of the Green Spiritual Secret Realm, they said goodbye to each other. No one had noticed that there was one more person in Tian Yu sect.When cultivator Qixuan saw that all of his disciples were doing fine, he showed a smile. Although there was almost no danger in the Green Spiritual Secret Realm, no one would know what would happen if one was unlucky enough to encounter a demon cultivator.As the inheritances that everyone got was within the scope of confidentiality, the pink rabbit on the shoulders of Xu Zirong became the observing target of everyone else.There was a soft and lovely rabbit on a cute but cold teenager\u2026and that rabbit was making noises of chewing carrots. Many senior brothers and sisters found this scene very cute, but\u2026The way that Xu Zirong looked at things really didn\u2019t make him a twelve-year-old. Those senior brothers and sisters all sighed \u2013 how come this cute child had such an unlovely character!?\u201cIs this\u2026\u201d Cultivator Qixuan was a little surprised when he saw the rabbit. There were spiritual monsters coming out of the Realm, but there weren\u2019t many of them. However, the spiritual monsters that they\u2019d bring were usually those powerful and giant spiritual monsters. He\u2019d never seen such a cute one like Xu Zirong\u2019s.That rabbit looked really safe, and Qixuan didn\u2019t wonder too much about the kind of monster it was. All in all, there were countless monsters in the cultivation world. Many different kinds of monsters mate and their descendants would have a whole new outlook.A rabbit with antlers indeed looked strange, but Qixuan had seen much stranger ones. This monster looked so harmless and he didn\u2019t care about it much.He smiled secretly. All in all, a kid is a kid. Even though he\u2019d already finished building base, he\u2019d still pick such a lovely animal when he had to choose a spiritual monster. However, cultivator Qixuan had no intention to criticize him. He wasn\u2019t the master of Xu Zirong and he\u2019d leave that problem to Luo Yun.Very irresponsibly, he ignored the existence of the rabbit. Qixuan released his flying boat again to let everybody in.It was much quicker when they returned. It only took them five days to finish the whole journey.On their way, everyone exchanged their experiences with excitement, but they never said a word about their inheritances.Le Hu and Wei Qing still looked like they\u2019d kill each other, giving a headache to Xu Ziyan. He really didn\u2019t understand. One of them was the heir of the Central Plains Dynasty, while one was a trained, young warrior of the extreme west. How come these two people, having completely different background, became so childish whenever they met?These two people did not even stop on the boat. Although they weren\u2019t fighting, they never stopped saying mean things or being sarcastic to each other. They also hadn\u2019t stopped starting at each other. This made Xu Ziyan think that his brother was the most obedient one, as he didn\u2019t even have to worry about him a bit.When they were back to Liu Guang sect, Xu Ziyan and Xu Zirong both realized that it\u2019s time to cultivate in closed doors.This closed-door cultivation wasn\u2019t any similar to the kind they had before, in which they would wake up after five days. It\u2019s a true sense of closed-door cultivation. Each time, they had to do it for half a year, or it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cclosed-door\u201d at all.Previously, Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t like this way of training at all. It was extremely boring after entering this mode of cultivation. Also, it\u2019d be a test to his stomach and intestines. However, after the trip to the Green Spiritual Secret Realm, he was sure that this closed-door cultivation had become necessary.During this period, he had absorbed too much stuff. Aside from the trick of controlling a golden puppet that Xu Zirong taught him, he found that the absorbance of the Purple Night Divine Thunder was a big trouble as well.He didn\u2019t think that he could simply swallow the Purple Night Divine Thunder in the same way as described in the mural. In that case, his whole body would just burst and turn into ashes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The practice with Thunder Light Man seemed to have happened one year ago. He realized that after he joined the Liu Guang sect, he hadn\u2019t had the time to cultivate this.He had learnt so much, but all would be nothing if he couldn\u2019t turn them into his fighting power. After learning about this weird risk in the Green Spiritual Secret Realm, Xu Ziyan became guilty of his laziness.Although the content of the novel had not begun, in this world that had already undergone some changes under his influence, no one could still guarantee that the story would follow its original track.His strength has become much stronger than the original Xu Ziyan, but after encountering Lin Xiaotian, he suddenly found that his strength was only a little higher than his original body, and it was still nothing compared to the more talented ones.He did not dare to underestimate the charm of the original protagonist, Bai Hua. After losing him as the third Gong, who knows if he\u2019d go and find the fourth or fifth Gong\u2026At that time, if he was too lazy and he couldn\u2019t get powerful enough, let alone Zirong, he might be defeated as well\u2026For this own life and for the sake of his baby brother, he had to force himself to become stronger.Apart from these things, he also discovered one of his major shortcomings during this adventure. Because of his original memory, he was familiar with a lot of knowledge in the cultivation world, but it doesn\u2019t mean that he could apply these knowledges. Just like in the grave underground, it\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t know about the existence of soft moss, but he couldn\u2019t connect it to the reality.Cultivation and integration of his original memory became the two goals of Xu Ziyan\u2019s closed-door cultivation.Comparing to Xu Ziyan, Xu Zirong\u2019s aim of cultivation was much purer. It\u2019s only because he was irritated by Lin Xiaotian and the figure that looked like Bai Hua in the Green Spiritual Secret Realm.He was killed in his previous life and his soul was tortured. He would never forget such a hatred engraved in his heart.The Blood Sea Heart Sutra that Xu Zirong practiced was a very bloody one. He was lucky enough to always have Xu Ziyan by his side, and he had the consciousness to control his intentions to kill. Otherwise, he would kill Lin Xiaotian right at the moment he saw him.However, he cared more about leaving a nice impression to his brother. He would rather live with this hatred and wait for another chance, so that he could preserve his good image of being a \u201cgood baby\u201d.Whether it was Lin Xiaotian or Mo Ziyuan, he would never let go of the black hand \u2013 Bai Hua who\u2019s controlling things behind. However, he had no idea where Bai Hua was. Mo Ziyuan hid himself in the Mo Yulong Pavilion, and although he had already seen Lin Xiaotian, the fact that he was a disciple of Tian Yu sect reminded Xu Zirong that he had to think twice before taking any action.Fortunately, Xu Zirong had always been patient, and he also believed that according to his previous life\u2019s experience, he would surely see that person again.At that time, once things started again\u2026there\u2019s an evil smile on Xu Zirong\u2019s face. He could take his sweet time to take revenge.However, all this was based on his ability to kill the other person. He wasn\u2019t sure about the other people, but after seeing Lin Xiaotian, he had realized that although he\u2019d already obtained Blood Sea Heart Sutra, a high-level practice that could help him ignore any spiritual roots, Lin Xiaotian was also one of the rare talents possessing the Divine Spiritual Roots. Also, since he\u2019s with his brother all the time in this life, he couldn\u2019t hunt down people as relentlessly as before. He had to be extra careful or he might get himself killed.Since he had been suffering so much in his previous life, Xu Zirong could not tolerate himself getting hurt in the same area again. Even though he had to live with the fact that he wouldn\u2019t see his brother for a long time, he had to cultivate closed-doors for the future.Even though he had to do this with his brother at the same time and they had to be in their own rooms, it was still a comfort to Xu Zirong.Big Foot Luo made no objections to their proposal to cultivate closed-doors.Xu Ziyan wasn\u2019t sure if it was an illusion, but he saw that Big Foot Luo had become a bit cold to Xu Zirong.Previously, Big Foot Luo used to argue frequently with Zirong, but this scene seldom occurred anymore. It looked as if their master-disciple relationship had become more harmonized, but Xu Ziyan thought that it\u2019s because of something else.Xu Zirong hadn\u2019t realized it at all. He might have, but he didn\u2019t care about it.In this world, the only person who could influence his mood was Xu Ziyan. Although Big Foot Luo didn\u2019t treat him badly, for Xu Zirong, he was only categorized as \u201can okay person\u201d.There would be no disappointment if there are no expectations. And that\u2019s why Xu Zirong accepted the subtle change of Big Foot Luo\u2019s attitude much more easily than Xu Ziyan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, there were too many things in his body which he couldn\u2019t explain well to Xu Ziyan, and he was also worried that when he was cultivating, his breath of Blood Sea Heart Sutra would cause an inappropriate association to his brother.After finishing all the chores, Xu Ziyan refused to look at Xu Zirong\u2019s reluctant expression, and he completely closed the entrance of the quiet room. Then, he began his first long closed-door cultivation after he arrived the cultivation world.One day in the middle of the mountain, while there has already been a thousand years on earth\u2026When Xu Ziyan woke up again, although he had kind of expected it, he was still surprised that five years had passed already.It\u2019s five years\u2026It\u2019s not a very long time, but it\u2019s not a short period either, it could already make an elegant teenager grow into someone with gorgeous appearance.It was like waking from up a dream at first. When Xu Ziyan just woke up, he didn\u2019t even realize that such a long time had passed, but he discovered that his hair seemed to grow a lot longer, and his body was even covered with dust.What immediately followed was a loud bang, and the stone door of the closed quiet room was broken, a slim, slender figure rushed over and threw himself into Xu Ziyan\u2019s arms\u2014\u201cBrother, you\u2019re finally out.\u201dThe clear voice of the teenager had replaced his childishness, however\u2026Xu Ziyan was stunned by this coquettish beauty in his arms, and he couldn\u2019t speak for a long while\u2026Damn, who\u2019s this?Wait a minute, how come this person looked like his brother? Even their styles and senses were so similar?\u201cZirong?\u201d Xu Ziyan asked with a bit of doubt.\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d Xu Zirong pouted and looked at Xu Ziyan sadly.Xu Ziyan was horrified. Damn it, before he closed his eyes, this guy was still a short teenager, how could he grow so big and so quickly? Judging from his height, weight and his gorgeous face that had totally grown, this was exactly the adult version of Xu Zirong!God, give me back my lovely brother!!! Where\u2019s my little Zirong???Xu Ziyan felt sad and angry at the same time. Ever since he transmigrated, he had made up his mind to raise Xu Zirong well, and just before he had enough fun of it, Xu Zirong had already grown up in the blink of an eye! How unscientific was that?!\u201cBrother\u2026don\u2019t you like Zirong anymore?\u201d Xu Zirong bit his lower lip and looked at Xu Ziyan with tears in his eyes.Xu Ziyan was stunned. Okay, he admitted that he didn\u2019t hate the adult version of Zirong, but he couldn\u2019t really accept the fact that the little and na\u00efve boy had turned into an attractive man in such a short time. This was such a big difference.\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026it\u2019s just that\u2026why did you grow up all of a sudden?\u201d After all, Xu Zirong was still his little brother, Xu Ziyan stroked his head out of his old habit.Xu Zirong\u2019s eyes looked more sorrowful, \u201cbrother, have you realized how long you\u2019ve been cultivating?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Xu Ziyan froze for a moment. His original plan was to do it for half a year, but during the course, he had been studying the nine changes of Purple Night, the Green Night Divine Thunder in his Dantian, and how to devour Purple Night Divine Thunder. Naturally, it took a long time to study these things, and he became obsessed with it unknowingly\u2026he had no idea how long he\u2019d been cultivating.\u201cHow long had I been cultivating?\u201d Xu Ziyan asked with guilt.Xu Zirong kept silent, but the grief in his eyes was so full that Xu Ziyan almost felt drowned\u2026\u201cBrother\u2026 You had been cultivating for five years.\u201d Xu Zirong stretched out a hand and shook in front of Xu Ziyan\u2019s eyes.\u201cFive years!!!\u201d Xu Ziyan was shocked, \u201chow is it possible?!\u201dXu Zirong didn\u2019t say anything, but he just stood up straight and took Xu Ziyan\u2019s hand to compare his height.Xu Ziyan became speechless immediately. With such an obvious change, everyone could see it.In his eyes, there was also an inexplicable confusion, and Xu Ziyan had a dream-like feeling at this moment. Although the original body in his memory were once closed for ten or twenty years, he never thought of trying it again in this life. Maybe he would still need a long period of closed-door cultivation to break through when he encountered a bottleneck in the future, however\u2026that\u2019s not his plan at that moment!No matter what his initial expectations were, the fact that he was seeing represented his mistakes, which made Zirong masterless for the entire five years. The memories that he had about this place had stayed before the cultivation, and at that time, Big Foot Luo was very cold to Xu Zirong.Without his brother\u2019s care and the fact that his master was cold to him, Xu Ziyan could draw the conclusion that Zirong had been neglected during these five years.He had realized that Zirong always liked to stick to him, and it\u2019s also a kind of insecurity.What about the consequences? Well, he had disappeared for five years, and he had no idea how much sadness Zirong had to endure.\u201cZirong\u2026this has been very hard for you.\u201d Xu Ziyan was filled with guilt in his heart. Out of habit, he held Zirong in his arms and stroked his long hair gently.As Xu Zirong had grown taller, this familiar action had become a little awkward. Xu Zirong quickly adjusted his posture so that Xu Ziyan could find that familiar feeling quickly\u2026While burying his head in his elder brother\u2019sPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the surface, he seemed like an ordinary Golden Core cultivator, but Xu Ziyan had never believed in his fa\u00e7ade. However, he still thought that he had underestimated the depth of Liu Guang sect. He had always thought that he\u2019d been hiding it well, but Big Foot Luo already knew about him cultivating demon practices long time ago.Xu Zirong didn\u2019t ask how Big Foot Luo knew about it, as he knew asking it wouldn\u2019t make any sense. The only thing that he didn\u2019t understand was that Big Foot Luo could destroy him any second if he wanted to, but it seemed that he had helped Xu Zirong to hide something as well.\u201cWhy?\u201d Xu Zirong stopped faking and asked coldly. Both knew what he was referring to.Big Foot Luo glanced at him lightly, \u201cthere are two reasons. First, I admire your brother, and I think he\u2019s a good material. I don\u2019t want you, as a little shit, to interfere his plan. All in all, you\u2019re his spoilt little brother, if you die in the Liu Guang sect, it will certainly separate him from the sect.\u201d\u201cSecond\u2026\u201d This time, Big Foot Luo looked firmly at Xu Zirong and said slowly, \u201calthough you are cultivating magic skills, after my observation for a long time, I found that you have never taken a cultivator as your hunting target. \u201d Speaking of which, he paused before continuing, \u201cif I\u2019ve made the right guess, the one that you\u2019ve cultivated is the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, right? In fact, it\u2019s not demon cultivation itself. It was originally created by a righteous cultivator, and it also played a major role in the battle of the extreme west.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity\u2026\u201d He shook his head a little regretfully, \u201chuman beings are naturally evil. The Blood Sea Heart Sutra was initially made for cultivation with demon\u2019s blood, but it had turned into a method of demon cultivation after some bastard discovered its better effect with the use of human cultivator\u2019s blood.\u201dHe glanced at Xu Zirong again, \u201cthe reason why I haven\u2019t touched you is because there is no right or wrong in the cultivation itself, we just need to look at who\u2019s controlling it. From my current point of view, your performance is still satisfactory to me. Although I have no idea in what way you\u2019ve got this inheritance, you managed to control the sense of murder in your heart and you\u2019ve always put beasts and monsters as your first target. This is amazing, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve let you be.\u201dXu Zirong looked at Big Foot Luo silently. He never expected that Big Foot Luo had observed him for so long. Now when he thought of it, when his brother was cultivating closed-door, Big Foot Luo was exceptionally cold to him, and that\u2019s probably because he\u2019d discovered Xu Zirong having cultivated demon practices\u2026When thinking of this, Xu Zirong was having cold sweat. Fortunately, he had always considered his elder brother\u2019s feelings and never regarded human cultivators as his hunting target. Even though he was feeling super irritated during his brother\u2019s cultivation for the past five years, he had at most killed the beasts and monsters at the back of the mountain\u2026\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone about it, but remember \u2013 if you ever use human cultivators to cultivate demon practices in the future, I will kill you no matter where you are!\u201d Big Foot Luo couldn\u2019t be more expressive, and he even tried to suppress Xu Zirong as a nascent soul cultivator, leaving an impression of fear in his heart.This is also a magical power of nascent soul cultivators. He used this method to plant the seeds of fear in Xu Zirong\u2019s heart. If Xu Zirong desperately uses human cultivators to cultivate one day, then this seed of fear will grow, and when Xu Zirong upgrades himself, it will become the ultimate demon in his heart.Big Foot Luo had to do this out of no alternatives at all. Although it\u2019s an unfair method to Xu Zirong, he was really worried about Xu Zirong committing evil acts with his Blood Sea Heart Sutra. On the other hand, if Xu Zirong didn\u2019t do anything, Big Foot Luo couldn\u2019t attack him first.To choose between the two, he could only choose a less kind method.Such a method naturally had an impact on Xu Zirong, at least it imposed an influence on his state of mind. Big Foot Luo was just doing this out of precautions. Therefore, after looking serious, he tried to look more relaxed and comforted Xu Zirong.At the moment Big Foot Luo planted the seeds of fear in the heart of Xu Zirong, Xu Zirong lowered his head, seemingly forced by the momentum of Big Foot Luo. He was so scared that he couldn\u2019t even raise his head.Big Foot Luo thought that it\u2019s not a good moment to say anything further. He went on encouraging Xu Zirong, promising that as long as he didn\u2019t kill indiscriminately, Xu Zirong was still his disciple. Afterwards, Big Foot Luo left in a hurry. All in all, he was still a nascent soul cultivator. It was already too much to bully a kid like this, thus he did not want to arouse Xu Zirong\u2019s rebelliousness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If anyone would have noticed, there was no trace of fear on that beautiful face. Instead, there was a cold smile on his face.The repression of a nascent soul cultivator is absolute to a building base cultivator. If Big Foot Luo wanted to kill Xu Zirong, he didn\u2019t even need one second, but he\u2019d made the mistake of planting seeds of fear in Xu Zirong\u2019s heart instead of proving it by with his power.Xu Zirong knew what it felt like by being reborn, although he wasn\u2019t as good as Big Foot Luo in terms of cultivation, he had already reached the level of a nascent soul cultivator in terms of spirit.No matter how wise Big Foot Luo was, he would never expect that there would be a soul of nascent soul living inside a teenager\u2019s body. For Xu Zirong, getting rid of the seeds of fear would be too easy.\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d Xu Zirong murmured and hugged Xu Ziyan\u2019s waist tightly. He took a deep breath, and after five years, he finally smelled that familiar scent again.Although he had successfully cheated Big Foot Luo at the beginning, it also reminded Xu Zirong that his disguise was not as perfect as he had previously thought. Although he didn\u2019t know how Big Foot Luo discovered it, a flaw is a flaw. If Big Foot Luo could find out, it means that other people could find out as well.This time he got lucky, and Big Foot Luo didn\u2019t reveal the truth, but other people in Liu Guang sect might not be as nice.Over the past few years, he has lived in a simple life, and had almost become an invisible man in the Liu Guang Sect. Except for the tasks of the sect assigned to him, he never went out. He just stayed in his quiet room to cultivate every day.Occasionally, when he couldn\u2019t suppress the sense of violence in his heart, he would leave the mountain gate, find a secluded mountain range, and slaughter monsters and beasts. He managed to keep doing this for five years.But this was also his limit. If Xu Ziyan still didn\u2019t wake up, he really couldn\u2019t tell what he\u2019d do.\u201cOkay, okay, it\u2019s brother\u2019s fault, but I never expected that this closed-door cultivation would last for five years.\u201d Xu Ziyan smiled bitterly.Although that\u2019s not what he wanted, but he had indeed left Zirong aside for five years. The little boy in his memory had already become a beauty, Xu Ziyan was full of guilt\u2026Xu Zirong didn\u2019t speak any more, he just hugged Xu Ziyan tightly, buried his head in his arms and refused to let go.Xu Ziyan gently stroked his back. The two brothers were completely silent and they just hugged each other tightly.\u201cCough\u2026Am I\u2026 disturbing you?\u201d A sudden voice broke the silence.Xu Ziyan looked up and found that it was his master Big Foot Luo. The playful expression on his face made him blush.He patted Zirong on the shoulder and pulled him from his arms.Xu Zirong straightened his body, and Xu Ziyan realized that he hadn\u2019t paid attention to how tall Zirong had already grown.Thinking of that, he inevitably entered in a state of melancholy. The little boy who had only reached his chest had already grown up to the height of his shoulders\u2026Although he seemed to have grown taller after five years as well, compared to the difference of the previous year, Xu Zirong was now only a little shorter.Xu Ziyan was fully immersed into the thought of \u201cmy little brother is all grown up\u201d, and now he looked at his master.Although Xu Zirong really hated Big Foot Luo for having interrupted their brother\u2019s sweet moment, but he didn\u2019t show it in his face. Since the previous warning, Big Foot Luo was now much nicer to him. He had become much more careful in his daily reminders as well, as if he was trying to make up for planting seeds of fear.Xu Zirong received Big Foot Luo\u2019s courteous gestures well. He had no master in his previous life, and he had to rely solely on the Blood Sea Heart Sutra and those jade slips from the market for self-learning. Being guided by a master and self-learning are two totally different concepts. If not, no one would fight this hard to enter the sect.Big Foot Luo was a solid nascent soul cultivator. He had no pressure to instruct a building base cultivator at all. What Xu Zirong missed was exactly the most basic knowledge. Therefore, when one was willing to learn and the other one willing to teach, the master-disciple relationship became incredibly peaceful.Xu Zirong didn\u2019t pay attention to Big Foot Luo. As long his brother was around, he\u2019d put all his attention on him.The dust accumulated over the years was swept away by his dust removal technique. Xu Zirong was very attentive to tidy up the folds on his brother\u2019s clothes. Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t notice anything wrong with his brother\u2019s behavior. Ever since the Green Night Divine Thunder was mixed in his Dantian, he had become used to letting Xu Zirong take care of his clothes.Seeing how considerate Xu Zirong was, Big Foot Luo\u2019s eyes flashed. He glanced at Xu Zirong deeply, but he was so busy with taking care of his brother that he hadn\u2019t even noticed.\u201cMaster, is there anything you want from me?\u201d Xu Ziyan asked.Although he had been cultivating closed-doors for five years, he was sure that Big Foot Luo was looking for him for some other reason.Big Foot Luo nodded, \u201cI\u2019m not looking for you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Meaning he\u2019s looking for Zirong?He looked suspiciously at Xu Zirong. He still remembered that the attitude of Big Foot Luo to Zirong before the closed-door cultivation was very strange. Did it mean that they had reconciled?Then, he thought, it\u2019s been five years anyway, anything could be resolved in five years.\u201cAre you looking for me?\u201d Xu Zirong\u2019s voice was very cold, there was no childishness in it but much more like an elegant teenager.With such a beautiful look and the sound of jade, no wonder someone once said that the blood demon was the first beauty in the Xuan Yu Realm.Xu Ziyan couldn\u2019t help staring at Zirong\u2019s face. He had seen the eight-year-old and the twelve-year-old Zirong, and although he had also seen the grown-up Zirong in his memory, he couldn\u2019t deny the fact that Zirong was extremely gorgeous and he\u2019d captured his attention.The pale porcelain-like skin looked so flawless that it didn\u2019t seem like a real person, he had also had a tall nose bridge, full red lips, and his slightly opened lips kept saying, \u201cbrother\u2026\u201dOh?\u201cBrother? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Xu Zirong looked at him with confusion, \u201chow come you\u2019re staring at me blankly?\u201dXu Ziyan was suddenly embarrassed. He was looking at his younger brother but was in turn stunned by his beauty. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d say such a shameful thing!!!\u201cNothing.\u201d He looked away embarrassedly and despised himself. He had already seen all kinds of beauties in the world, how could he be so stunned by Zirong\u2019s beauty?It really couldn\u2019t be more embarrassing!But really\u2026Zirong was certainly gorgeous, and he\u2019s even more beautiful than women with cosmetics.\u201cThen\u2026brother, did you hear what we said just now?\u201d Xu Zirong asked helplessly.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Xu Ziyan felt dull\u2026He was in a daze just now, of course he didn\u2019t hear anything!He showed a helpless smile and Xu Zirong repeated to him carefully.Xu Ziyan silently wiped his forehead. He was the elder brother and he should be the one taking care of his little brother. How come he sensed a hint of being spoiled from his little brother just now?This was definitely just an illusion!\u201cAre you two over it yet? Wasn\u2019t it just a closed-door cultivation? How come you\u2019re still sticking to each other?\u201d Big Foot Luo couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, he had to teach the two brothers a lesson.One of them enjoyed pampering his younger brother, while the other one enjoyed playing an obedient baby the whole day\u2026Well, from another point of view, these two people were considered to have complemented each other. If Xu Zirong was a sharp blade, then Xu Ziyan would be his scabbard and knife holder.As long as he was there, Big Foot Luo did not need to worry about what crazy things Xu Zirong would do, plus the existence of the seeds of fear, he had full confidence to Xu Zirong to grow on his own.But\u2026these two little guys were acting a bit too much! It turned out he had completely ignored his master and just paid attention to his brother, this was a really disturbing scene!\u201cHo ho\u2026\u201d Xu Ziyan could only keep giggling when he heard Big Foot Luo. At this time, any refutation would be unwise at this time.Big Foot Luo was actually just saying that, he couldn\u2019t punish the two brothers just because they had a close relationship, but he was quite fed up with the scenario as he\u2019d never seen such anyone as clingy as Xu Zirong before.To be honest, if one only focused on the way Xu Zirong was acting now, they could never expect him to have cultivated the Blood Sea Heart Sutra.\u201cMaster, can my brother go with me?\u201d Xu Zirong asked suddenly.Big Foot Luo nodded casually, \u201cgo ahead, just treat it as yet another experience. Well, I assume that you haven\u2019t returned home ever since you joined Liu Guang sect? This time, you can do so. You have two months and it\u2019ll be enough. \u201dXu Zirong didn\u2019t agree, nor disagree about his suggestion of going home. He had no love or hatred for the Xu family. He had once wiped out the entire Xu family in his previous life, which was considered as revenge. The Xu family in this life has not done any damages to him so far. Also, it was also his brother\u2019s home. He could see that his brother still had feelings for that home, and he would naturally not do anything destructive.Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t think that much. He just thought that Xu Zirong was also Xu Xiao\u2019s son. He had lived with the Xu family for so many years, and he should have some feelings about it. It would be a nice idea to drop by.Big Foot Luo did not participate in the discussion of the brothers. He came here to ask Xu Zirong visit a friend\u2019s family on his behalf.That friend had deceased early, but Big Foot Luo was a righteous guy, he would take care of his family from time to time. The patriarch of that family was very wise, he never acted arrogantly because of the protection of Big Foot Luo. Instead, he was unusually low-key and never used his reputation to bully others.For this kind of informed and knowledgeable family, Big Foot Luo didn\u2019t mind offering them some help. This time, the patriarch of this family had his daughter married off, as the groom came from a medium-sized family, there were three golden core cultivators in it. In comparison, this family seemed a bit weak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t mind taking care of such trivial matters, so the task naturally fell on Xu Zirong\u2019s shoulders.As there was still nearly half a month before the wedding, Xu Zirong was not in a hurry to set off. Xu Ziyan just finished his cultivation, and he needed a good rest.Therefore, before going to bed at night, Xu Ziyan suddenly discovered that Xu Zirong had become extremely clingy.Previously, Zirong was still a kid and it\u2019s ok for him to always pull the clothes of Xu Ziyan; now that he\u2019s an adult, although he\u2019d stopped pulling Xu Ziyan\u2019s clothes, he started pulling his hands.Although the two were brothers, it was indeed eerie for them to hold hands\u2026Xu Ziyan tried to tactfully reject Xu Zirong. Unexpectedly, the moment he started mentioning it, Xu Zirong started looking at him extremely sadly. Then, Xu Ziyan couldn\u2019t continue and he started feeling guilty.Initially, Zirong was someone with insecurity. After five years of cultivation, it\u2019s normal for him to become this clingy, as he\u2019s really afraid to be left behind again.Xu Ziyan was really guilty, and he became much softer to Zirong. It\u2019s indeed super weird for two guys to sleep on the same bed, yet he could only agree.That night, Xu Zirong had a good sleep. Although cultivators usually didn\u2019t need deep sleep, he fell into sleep very easily by hugging his brother.However, Xu Ziyan had nightmares the whole night. In the dream, he was tightly entangled by a giant python, and the snake even licked his face for a few times. Just when he was about to be swallowed by that bloody mouth, he suddenly woke up. Then, he\u2019s completely dumbfounded when he discovered that it\u2019s Xu Zirong\u2019s limbs that had entangled him\u2026He silently held his forehead and suddenly realized that he hadn\u2019t set a good example for Xu Zirong in terms of sleeping posture. Xu Zirong probably trained himself to sleep like a snake in order to adapt to his brother.Although he didn\u2019t want to admit it, he knew very well how he looked like when he slept\u2026Before Big Foot Luo left the previous day, he left them with a cloud shuttle. This cloud shuttle was a flying magic weapon and was extremely fast. It was an absolutely effective weapon when they had to go somewhere urgently or to flee.This time, Xu Zirong and the others were attending the wedding on behalf of Big Foot Luo. Naturally, they couldn\u2019t appear to be too poor. This cloud shuttle was borrowed by Big Foot Luo from his senior brother, and he specially gave the brothers to look nice.They were happily passing through the clouds when driving the cloud shuttle. It\u2019s actually a magic weapon of intermediate level, and it\u2019s at least ten times faster than holding their swords.The Jiang family was located in a remote city called Wuti City, which was more than twice the size of Moxin City where the Xu family was located. However, the status of the Jiang family in Wuti City was completely incomparable to that of the Xu family.After all, the Xu family still bore the name of a peripheral family of the Liu Guang sect, and the Xu family had also worked hard for its reputation. Aside from its patron, Xu Xiao who was a Golden Core cultivator, there was at least one more guest who was in the same level.The two Golden Core cultivators may be nothing in some big sects, but in such a remote town, they were already very powerful. It\u2019s pretty evident when the Xu family could guard the whole Moxin city with two Golden Core cultivators.There were four powers in Wuti City where the Jiang family was located. These four powers were of equal strength, and none of them could dominate over the other one. It\u2019s just that Wuti City was relatively close to Tian Yu sect, and among these four families, the Fang family was the outer sect of the Tian Yu sect. Therefore, in the Wuti City, the Fang family had a greater say in various matters.This time, someone in the Jiang family would get married to someone from the Fang family. The daughter of the head of the Jiang family was going to marry the son of a senior of the Fang family. As the Fang family had the Tian Yu sect to rely on, on the surface, it looked like the Jiang family wanted to rely on the Tian Yu sect. However, Jiang Tianxing didn\u2019t mean this at all.As an ordinary father, he had never thought of enhancing his status through marriage. In his mind, the happiness of his daughter was the most important.It was for this reason that he deliberately contacted cultivator Luo Yun, hoping that he could send a disciple over. There\u2019s no need to argue about anything, he just wanted them to clarify their identity, letting everyone know that there\u2019s one Nascent Soul cultivator behind the Jiang family. It\u2019s also to let everyone know that the Jiang family doesn\u2019t need to establish any relationship by selling their daughter.After knowing the whole story from Big Foot Luo, Xu Ziyan also had a good impression of this patron of the Jiang family.Compared with Xu Xiao, Jiang Tianxing was a really good father. As his daughter, Miss Jiang who\u2019s going to get married was definitely a fortunate one.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What\u2019s this all about? Why would the cousin brother of her husband ask this question?Fang Tianrui gritted his teeth and looked at her, \u201cand why does it not have anything to do with me? We obviously\u2026\u201d Then, he swallowed the next words abruptly, since there\u2019s absolutely no way for him to mention the private encounter of him and Jiang Ying. He just didn\u2019t understand \u2013 since he and Jiang Ying obviously loved each other and they had seen each other so many times. Jiang Ying also promised to get married to him. Initially, he was going to propose marriage to the Jiang family, but the marriage letter of the Jiang family was there even before he got to meet her parents. It turned out it\u2019s the son of his second uncle, Fang Tianyun, who\u2019s going to get married to Jiang Ying.Among the children of the Fang family\u2019s generation, he and Fang Tianyun were the only ones with the best qualifications. They usually had a good relationship, but since he knew that Fang Tianyun was going to get married to Jiang Ying, Fang Tianrui absolutely couldn\u2019t face him anymore.\u201cWhy!?\u201d Fang Tianrui just wanted to know why. He knew that Jiang Ying and Fang Tianyun were about to get married, and he couldn\u2019t change the decision. So, he wasn\u2019t going to waste any effort trying to change anything. He just wanted to ask Jiang Ying, the one who\u2019d spent so much time with him before, the one who once vowed that she\u2019d get married to him \u2013 why the hell would she marry to Fang Tianyun?\u201cWhat why? What are you talking about?\u201d Jiang Ying was completely confused. She had never had anything to do with Fang Tianrui. She felt upset being questioned like this.\u201cYou don\u2019t admit it\u2026 You don\u2019t even admit it\u2026\u201d Fang Tianrui felt like a joke. Looking at Jiang Ying\u2019s beautiful face, he just found it abhorrent.This woman that he loved was going to marry his younger brother. Perhaps it\u2019s for this reason that she was eager to cut ties with him.Fang Tianrui felt so desperate. He was deeply in love with Jiang Ying, but Jiang Ying was about to marry his younger brother. From now on, he would have to face his lover and his brother together every day. This was just too cruel for him.\u201cForget it\u2026you don\u2019t admit it\u2026and that\u2019s fine.\u201d Fang Tianrui murmured to himself, and then left in a daze. He knew that Jiang Ying was right to deal with it this way. In the future, they would live in the same family. If the relationship between the two was revealed, it would definitely be the biggest scandal in Wuti City.When Fang Tianrui left, he looked very confused.Although Jiang Ying felt that it was annoying to be stopped and questioned inexplicably, it still made her worry. All in all, that guy was the cousin brother of Tianyun, and he looked extremely confused when he left.After thinking about this, Jiang Ying decided to let his guards follow. Then, she went to the house of the Fang family to report about this.When Fang Tianyun followed Jiang Ying\u2019s guards to find Fang Tianrui, he couldn\u2019t believe that the drunk guy who\u2019s still asking for more alcohol turned out to be his cousin brother.\u201cCousin, you-why are you drunk like this?\u201d Fang Tianyun snatched the flask from Fang Tianrui\u2019s hand quickly and turned his head to the waiter, \u201chow much did he drink?\u201dOf course, the waiter this young master of the Fang family, he immediately waved his hand, \u201cnot much, Mr. Fang had just drunken two flasks\u2026ugh, actually, it\u2019s one flask and a half, since the other half is with you.\u201dFang Tianyun didn\u2019t know what reaction to give. He never realized that his cousin brother had such poor ability to hold alcohol. He got drunk by just drinking so little.\u201cCousin brother\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not drunk\u2026\u201d Fang Tianrui was trying to snatch the flask, but a drunk man couldn\u2019t do this.Fang Tianyun frowned speechlessly, Fang Tianrui was actually just drinking the most ordinary wine. It might be an excellent type in the eyes of ordinary people, yet for cultivators, as long as the wines weren\u2019t made from spiritual fruit, they wouldn\u2019t get drunk at all. All they needed to do is to force the feeling of being drunk by using their spiritual force.Judging from Fang Tianrui\u2019s behavior, it was obvious that he was deliberately getting himself drunk. Fang Tianyun had no idea what\u2019d happened to his cousin brother. What made him so upset?Jiang Ying didn\u2019t tell Fang Tianyun the fact that Fang Tianrui had once questioned her. She didn\u2019t want to cause any friction between the two brothers.She analyzed once more about the questions that Fang Tianrui asked her. It implied that she\u2019d had an affair, but she had never done that at all.She and Fang Tianrui did know each other, but there was absolutely no private meeting. This was a profoundly serious matter for a woman. Even if she was a cultivator, she would not ignore her reputation and have private meetings with other men.Thus, there was a contradiction. She could guarantee that there\u2019s nothing between her and Fang Tianrui, but Fang Tianrui didn\u2019t think the same. Fortunately, he was still a gentleman and he didn\u2019t discuss this matter in public, no matter how much he insisted. Even though he was questioning her, he found a relatively quiet spot and he also opened the soundproof barrier, proving that he really cared about the reputation of Jiang Ying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She admitted that she\u2019s worrying. Although she\u2019d never had an affair with Fang Tianrui, it\u2019d be extremely troublesome if he told everyone anything he wanted after getting drunk.She would be married to Tianyun in a few days. If there was still something unclear between her and the Fang family brothers at this time, even if it could be resolved at the end, she would definitely become a joke of the whole Wuti city.\u201cTianyun, I think your cousin is very drunk, so let\u2019s send him back first.\u201d Jiang Ying was worried.Fang Tianyun also didn\u2019t want outsiders to see that the future heir of the Fang family being drunk like this. He quickly called two servants to send Fang Tianrui back.After sending Fang Tianrui home, Fang Tianyun couldn\u2019t help but feel his head hurting just by looking at his sleeping cousin brother. His uncle would surely know about this matter, and given his personality, his cousin brother wouldn\u2019t have a nice time in the next coming days.\u201cYing\u2019er, do you know what the hell is going on?\u201d Fang Tianyun asked, pointing at the drunk Fang Tianrui.Jiang Ying shook her head slightly. Although Fang Tianrui and Fang Tianyun were cousins, they had completely different personalities. Compared with Fang Tianrui who didn\u2019t like to smile, Jiang Ying naturally liked the cheerful Fang Tianyun more.It\u2019s just that it really looked as if Fang Tianrui was betrayed, and she really couldn\u2019t think of why he\u2019d make up this lie.Unless\u2026\u2026Jiang Ying\u2019s heart jumped suddenly. She lowered her head and tried to cover the panic in her eyes. Fortunately, Fang Tianyun was busy taking care of Fang Tianrui who wanted some water, and he hadn\u2019t noticed his fianc\u00e9 looking so abnormal at that moment.After saying bye to Fang Tianyun in a hurry, Jiang Ying hurriedly returned home. She still looked slightly worried, but the few sisters that greeted her later on hadn\u2019t noticed it.\u201cHuh, what does she look so happy? She just hooked up with the second young master of the Fang family and nothing more!\u201d A girl in a yellow dress looked at Jiang Ying\u2019s back disappearing behind the moon gate, she couldn\u2019t help but said angrily.The girl in pink clothes standing beside her frowned slightly, \u201cenough, don\u2019t talk about it anymore.\u201dThe girl in yellow clothes pouted her lips, since she didn\u2019t agree with her. Her father was the younger brother of the current patriarch, and his cultivation level has reached the stage of pulse condensation. His father kept saying that her grandfather originally wanted to pass on the position of the patriarch to him, but it was snatched by the uncle. Therefore, the girl in yellow clothes had always felt that if the patriarch had not taken the position of her father back then, she would be the beloved daughter in the Jiang family! If she were the daughter of the patriarch, Fang Tianyun would definitely choose to marry her instead of Jiang Ying, who was inferior to her in every aspect!The girl in yellow clothes thought bitterly, but she dared not show any signs. Jiang Tianxing had absolute control over the Jiang family, and her father could only tell his daughter how he thought.The girl in yellow clothes also understood the Jiang family\u2019s style very well. Even though she felt unwilling, she couldn\u2019t show it too obviously. It\u2019s only that\u2026once she realized that Jiang Ying would marry to the handsome Fang Tianyun in a few days, she couldn\u2019t make her hatred disappear.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go, have you finished today\u2019s homework?\u201d The girl in pink clothes only knew that the girl in yellow clothes was very jealous of Jiang Ying. In fact, many people were jealous of the next generation of the Jiang family.Although many people in Wuti city were spreading rumors about the Jiang family marrying Jiang Ying off to Fang Tianyun, only because they wanted to connect to Tian Yu sect, the girl in yellow clothes knew very clearly about the love of the patriarch to Jiang Ying. If Jiang Ying didn\u2019t like Fang Tianyun a bit, he would never allow the marriage to happen.When the girl in pink clothes thought of her father\u2019s attitude towards her, she couldn\u2019t help but sigh slightly.Who wouldn\u2019t be jealous when facing Jiang Ying, who\u2019s so fortunate?Neither the hatred of the girl in yellow clothes nor girl in pink clothes bothered Jiang Ying. After she came out of the Fang\u2019s house, she had had difficulty concentrating.Fang Tianrui\u2019s behavior shocked her, but what made her feel more disturbed was that she vaguely had a terrifying thought.After returning to her courtyard, she told all her servants to leave, leaving only her close maid, Qilan. She brought Qilan to the backyard. With special steps, she walked around the rockery.This rockery was made up of five bizarre boulders. The angles of these boulders were very sophisticated, leaving a hole as high as one person under the rockery.Usually, this entrance was hidden under the phantom array, and one had to use the weird steps that Jiang Ying had used just now to reveal the entrance.Jiang Ying let Qilan stay aside and she hurriedly got into the entrance. It was a cave built up by a rockery and it\u2019s naturally not very deep. When Jiang Ying walked to the bottom of the cave, she touched a switch on the wall.Very quietly, a hole extending downwards was exposed two steps away from Jiang Ying. Jiang Ying looked at the hole and took a deep breath, then jumped right in.Along the underground passage, Jiang Ying first went down, then up again. After walking for a while, she saw a door exposed in front of her.She pushed open the door slowly and saw a picturesque scenery.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sunlight that came through the window scattered on him, seemingly putting on a golden coat on him.When the door was opened, the young man who was reading was alarmed by the sound. When he saw Jiang Ying, he showed a soft smile, \u201cYing\u2019er, here you are finally.\u201d\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d Jiang Ying bit her lower lip lightly.\u201cWell, it\u2019s been a long time.\u201d The young man said with a smile.If someone broke in at this time, he would definitely be shocked, as the appearance of this young man was exactly the same as Jiang Ying.Jiang Ying was the only daughter of Jiang Tianxing. This was something that the entire Wuti city knew. However, only a few people knew about the existence of the man in front of Jiang Ying, who obviously had something to do with her.After hearing him saying that \u201cyou\u2019re here finally\u201d, Jiang Ying couldn\u2019t help feeling a little guilty.

However, there was nothing she could do about it, since she was facing a marriage and her future husband was more important. Why would she want to see this brother that scared her a bit anyway?That\u2019s right, she was scared of him.Jiang Ying really had an indescribable sense of fear for her older brother who was born with a demon-infused body.A demon-infused body was something that the demon cultivators really yearned for. Anyone with such a body could cultivate any demon skills extremely quickly. They were almost destined to become the first demon king of the generation.When Jiang Tianxing hid Jiang Ying (m) (translator\u2019s note: the word \u201cm\u201d is to differentiate between Jiang Ying and her brother, since they have the same spelling in their names in English, although different Chinese characters), his purpose was to protect him. In fact, when too many cultivators encountered this kind of cultivators, the first thought that came up in their minds was to kill them in advance.Jiang Tianxing didn\u2019t want his son to be killed inexplicably, but what he did not expect was that as Jiang Ying (m) grew up bit by bit, a terrible change flourished in his body.Jiang Ying (m), who had undergone this horrifying change, was immediately imprisoned by Jiang Tianxing. The initial protection became imprisonment, and the hut hidden in the Jiang family had become Jiang Ying\u2019s (m) entire space of activities.Jiang Ying always felt uncomfortable when facing her elder brother. No matter how gentle Jiang Ying (m) spoke to her, no matter how elegant his actions were, Jiang Ying always felt coldness down her spine.Jiang Ying breathed with a sigh of relief as her gaze swept across the black iron chain on his brother\u2019s ankle. The iron chain didn\u2019t look thick, but it\u2019s made of fine iron that\u2019s forged a thousand years ago. Anyone without reaching the level of pulse condensation wouldn\u2019t be able to break that chain.She exchanged a few words with her elder brother, then mentioned about Fang Tianrui with him. However, Jiang Ying (m) didn\u2019t seem to be familiar with the name of Fang Tianrui, and he didn\u2019t react.Without any discovery, Jiang Ying left after a short while. From what she had observed, she thought that her elder brother didn\u2019t know Fang Tianrui at all, and she was then sure that her brother had nothing to do with Fang Tianrui. She put herself at ease, but she also knew that the problem with Fang Tianrui still had to be resolved. She had to at least remind Fang Tianyun about Fang Tianrui. Who knows if someone had set them up?The marriage between the Fang family and the Jiang family not only represented the union of the young couple, but it was also a union between the two families. This marriage would not be a nice thing for other families. Jiang Ying would certainly believe it if anyone told her that someone had created troubles for her on purpose.Soon after Jiang Ying left, Jiang Ying (m), who initially had a gentle smile on his face, suddenly changed his facial expression. His elegant temperament disappeared in an instant. It was still the same person, but right now, this man looked particularly evil.\u201cYour nice sister isn\u2019t so stupid, she even thought of coming here for you.\u201d The evil Jiang Ying (m) said with a smile.In an instant, the expression on Jiang Ying\u2019s (m) face changed again, as if he had changed back to the elegant and handsome Jiang Ying (m), 'she\u2019s also your sister. Also, we have the same appearance, what\u2019s so strange about her coming here?\u201dThe gentle Jiang Ying (m) turned into the evil Jiang Ying (m) again. He curled his lips slightly, but there was no sense of happiness in his eyes, \u201cmy sister? Haha, don\u2019t be kidding. They all want to kill me and break my corpse, but they don\u2019t want to let you go.\u201dThe gentle Jiang Ying (m) frowned, \u201cwhat nonsense are you talking about? I am you, and you are me. Do I have to repeat this kind of thing to you over and over again?\u201dThe evil Jiang Ying (m) smiled coldly and didn\u2019t say anything further.The gentle Jiang Ying (m) tapped on the tabletop gently, \u201cYing\u2019er\u2019s wedding is about to take place soon, as for that Fang Tianrui\u2026what are you\u2026planning to do with him?\u201dThe expression on the evil Jiang Ying (m) suddenly froze, and he sneered, \u201cwhat to do? I will do whatever I want to him! He\u2019s just\u2026a thing to kill time.\u201dThe gentle Jiang Ying (m) frowned, \u201cdo you really think so? A thing\u2026to kill time?\u201dThe evil Jiang Ying (m) looked dazed again, still insisting, \u201cof course.\u201d\u201cOkay! I said that before, and we\u2019re one! Do you think that I really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking about?\u201d The gentle Jiang Ying (m) knocked hard on the table to express his dissatisfaction.The evil Jiang Ying (m) was immediately dumbfounded, and after a while, he said angrily, \u201cwhy would that guy be so stupid? He\u2019s been with me for such a long time, and he doesn\u2019t even know that I\u2019m a male!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could you blame him?\u201dThe evil Jiang Ying turned his head away furiously and he frowned tightly.The elegant Jiang Ying sighed slightly, \u201caccording to what Ying\u2019er just said, I\u2019m guessing that he\u2019s in a shock now.\u201dThe evil Jiang Ying rubbed the chair twice uncomfortably.The elegant Jiang Ying looked worried, \u201cyou can\u2019t continue lying like that. Judging from his personality, if Ying\u2019er and Fang Tianyun get married, there\u2019s no way he\u2019d develop an intimate relationship with \u2018the wife of his cousin\u2019. That\u2019s to say, it\u2019s entirely impossible to pretend as Ying\u2019er and see him in private.\u201dThe facial expression of the evil Jiang Ying was more than complicated. Obviously, he knew already that it\u2019s impossible to make that old-fashioned, rigid man date his 'sister-in-law\u201d in private.\u201cAnd\u2026 don\u2019t forget one fact. He has always thought that the \u2018Jiang Ying\u2019 that he\u2019s been seeing is a woman. Even if you see him now, are you sure that he can accept you as a male?\u201d The elegant Jiang Ying still analyzed this calmly.The evil Jiang Ying slammed the table, \u201chow dare he! Even if I\u2019m a guy, so what? He did promise that he\u2019d be with me forever! If he ever regrets, I\u2026I\u2026\u201d At the end, the evil Jiang Ying couldn\u2019t utter a word, he just sat down in frustration.The gentle Jiang Ying wasn\u2019t surprised at all, since he had been in the same body as the evil Jiang Ying for so many years, he knew perfectly well the character of his \u201cother half\u201d.\u201cI have told you long time ago, that you\u2019d encounter trouble if you continued like this.\u201d\u201cOkay! I knew that you\u2019re into him as well! If you have any ideas, tell me now!\u201d The evil Jiang Ying was obviously getting impatient.The gentle Jiang Ying curled his lips slightly. Yes, he was also into Fang Tianrui very much. It\u2019s just that when he got along with Fang Tianrui, it\u2019s the evil Jiang Ying who showed up. Also, what he said that day meant that he wanted to share Fang Tianrui with his \u201cother half\u201d.They were actually two souls in one body, and naturally two sides of each other. Although they had different characters, they liked and disliked almost the same things. Since the evil Jiang Ying fell in love with Fang Tianrui, the gentle Jiang Ying would of course feel the same way.However\u2026 As Jiang Ying\u2019s manipulator during the day, he didn\u2019t want to give up the right to enjoy some nights with Fang Tianrui. In this case, he had to communicate well with the \u201cnight version\u201d of Jiang Ying.He whispered to the evil Jiang Ying, who showed an obviously delightful expression. The gentle Jiang Ying smiled lightly. His family had always thought that this \u201cevil\u201d Jiang Ying would drag his feet. Without him, Jiang Ying would never enter this \u201cdemonic path\u201d.It\u2019s a pity that\u2026the gentle Jiang Ying smiled. They had never had an idea that the real \u201cevil\u201d one was him.The Xu brothers had no idea with all these that had happened with the Jiang family. They were busy getting on the cloud shuttle.Initially, they had a lot of time, but since Xu Ziyan spoilt Xu Zirong too much, their schedule became very tight. While Xu Ziyan blamed himself, he had no intention to change.It would be appropriate to describe him as someone reluctant to repent or change\u2026He could warn himself as much as he wanted, that he really had to stop spoiling Xu Zirong, yet once his little brother showed that kind of pathetic look, he couldn\u2019t reject at all.As a result, Xu Ziyan got himself drunk in a market operated by immortal cultivators and slept for three days in a row.The facts have proved that he could no longer stop himself from getting drunk. Given his current body, it would already be good if he didn\u2019t get drunk after three glasses.Of course, the high purity of the spiritual wine was one of the reasons. However, the culprit that had caused all this was Xu Zirong, who was rubbing his brother\u2019s forehead gently at this moment.\u201cBrother, are you feeling better?\u201d Xu Zirong asked softly.\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Xu Ziyan shook his head vigorously, trying to make himself think more clearly. He thought that he\u2019d been so careless. He didn\u2019t expect the spiritual wine to be so powerful, as he recalled himself just having taken four glasses. It would be so shameful if Zirong wasn\u2019t there to take care of him.\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything after getting drunk, did I?\u201d Xu Ziyan asked, rubbing his forehead. If it was the original him, he would not have the consciousness of being drunk at all, and naturally he didn\u2019t know what would happen if he was drunk. However, he had seen others getting drunk before and he knew that anything could happen. He couldn\u2019t help but worry a bit about what he could do if he got drunk.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. After getting drunk, my brother went to bed and slept very tightly. But brother, you must never drink other people\u2019s wine in the future. After you fell asleep, you had really\u2026no reaction at all.\u201d At the end, Xu Zirong couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and he started laughing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could he have such weak alcohol holding ability? However, he also had some responsibilities in this. Although it\u2019s Zirong who suggested to drink some wine, he hadn\u2019t rejected at all. He couldn\u2019t put all the blame on Zirong alone.Fortunately, he didn\u2019t do anything extraordinary. Xu Ziyan focused on controlling the cloud shuttle, trying to take back the three days he had slept.Xu Zirong smiled, and he used his slender fingers to gently massage his brother\u2019s temples.Was the ability of Xu Ziyan to hold alcohol really that weak? Of course not!Now, Xu Ziyan was a building base cultivator at later stage, if a little amount of spiritual wine could get him that drunk, then it shouldn\u2019t be called spiritual wine, it should be called poison instead.In fact, Xu Zirong had planned all this for a long time. He had to spend a huge amount of spiritual stones for that bottle of wine. They were in his \u201cQiankun bag\u201d for a long time before being used.After his elder brother was drunk, he booked a room in an inn as quickly as possible. In this kind of room specially prepared for cultivators, in order to prevent being disturbed, there were some defensive arrays. With these arrays, Xu Zirong didn\u2019t have to be worried of being ambushed all of a sudden.He had to admit that his drunk brother was way beyond cute. Although it seemed inappropriate to use this adjective to describe a tall and handsome man, Xu Ziyan was so obedient after he was drunk. He was willing to do everything that Zirong instructed.Xu Zirong kept touching and kissing his brother, and his needs were greatly satisfied. If certain actions wouldn\u2019t leave obvious traces, he really wanted to \u201ccomplete the whole action\u201d.Since Xu Ziyan\u2019s closed-door cultivation, Xu Zirong\u2019s body also entered the growth period. Ever since his first wet dream, he had planned to relive those moments which he had once seen as \u201cdisgusting\u201d. Also, he started to read a lot on this topic.Xu Zirong\u2019s performance in real life still needed to be assessed, but at least he\u2019s an expert in theories now\u2026After tasting almost every inch of skin on his brother\u2019s body, Xu Zirong had to use all of his strength to control himself.No\u2026it\u2019s not the time yet\u2026He didn\u2019t want to separate from his elder brother just because of his inability to control himself. At that moment, he wasn\u2019t entirely sure whether his brother would stay.After taking a few deep breaths and suppressing the burning urge in his heart, it took Xu Zirong a lot of effort to reluctantly put the clothes on his brother and calm himself down completely.He didn\u2019t get his brother drunk to take advantage of him. Instead, he wanted to form a blood contract with his brother.The blood contract is a very partial spell in the Blood Sea Heart Sutra, and its function was also very simple. It could produce a kind of inseparable connection between two people who have formed a blood contract.This connection is established through blood, so both parties have to exchange nearly half of their body\u2019s natural essence blood to achieve this.The blood of cultivators is very precious, and their essence blood is even more so. It is very dangerous to have half of the essence blood left the body. If Xu Zirong hadn\u2019t studied deeply of the blood contract in his previous life, he wouldn\u2019t perform this ceremony on his brother so easily.In his previous life, he studied about the blood contract as he wanted to use this to create some absolutely loyal subordinates, but no matter how much he studied it, he really couldn\u2019t convince himself about passing half of his essence blood to the others.Wouldn\u2019t that be like giving his life to someone?It wasn\u2019t possible for him to do anything like that, and he had to stop studying it.However, that issue could be solved with Xu Ziyan, as there was absolutely no issues of trust between them.After removing this biggest risk, the blood contract would become an everlasting connection for them.It\u2019s the bonding between him and Xu Ziyan.He was not Xu Ziyan\u2019s real younger brother, no one knew this except himself. His mother was so clever back then, and even Xu Xiao was cheated. However, what\u2019s fake will forever be fake, and there would always be a risk of exposure.Now that a blood contract was formed, the connection between them could no longer be cut off. No matter where his brother went, Xu Zirong could use the blood contract to find him.The ceremony was completed smoothly, and it only took a few moments for the two to complete the exchange of their essence blood. There was no big change of the two after that.A drop-shaped blood mark appeared on Xu Zirong\u2019s arm, while he had put Xu Ziyan\u2019s mark on his waist on the back.If nothing specific happened, this mark could be hidden for a pretty long time. Given Xu Ziyan\u2019s personality, even if he found out, he might just take it as a mark that he\u2019s born with.After finishing all this, Xu Zirong, who was extremely exhausted, hugged his brother and fell asleep. When Xu Ziyan woke up, he reluctantly let go of his hand.They still had enough time to travel to Wuti City. Even if Xu Ziyan slept for three days, with the cloud shuttle, they managed to get there before the marriage.Jiang Tianxing, the head of the Jiang family, welcomed them very enthusiastically. He also cleaned the courtyard with the best scenery so that they could stay there.Xu Ziyan did not stay in the yard. Instead, he found a servant to take them around Wuti City. This was the third city Xu Ziyan has visited since he came to this world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Xu brothers went exploring the city the whole afternoon and they just finished seeing less than one-fourth of it.\u201cAnything fun to do here?\u201d Xu Ziyan asked casually. The things sold in this so-called shop couldn\u2019t even be compared to the small shop in Liu Guang sect, specifically dedicated to serving disciples, so he naturally wasn\u2019t interested.The servant who followed was a little worried, but from the attitude of the patriarch, it was not difficult to notice the identities of the Xu brothers. There was indeed somewhere fun in Wuti City, but was it really suitable to bring the brothers there?\u201cSo, is there a problem?\u201d Xu Ziyan noticed that the servant seemed a little embarrassed, and he asked curiously.\u201cNot really\u2026\u201d The servant replied with hesitation.\u201cIf it is inconvenient for you, then simply forget it.\u201d Xu Ziyan didn\u2019t mind. All in all, they were guests. If it\u2019s really inconvenient, they might as well wait in the Jiang family for the ceremony.He didn\u2019t mind but Xu Zirong did. He seemed a little unhappy after hearing the vague answer of the servant.As soon as he started to look unhappy, the servant was scared. These were the very important guests of the patriarchs. If he offended them, he might face a consequence even more serious than being expelled from the Jiang family.He was really scared, and he hurriedly said, \u201cin fact, the finest places in Wuti City would be Liu Yun Pavilion and Cai Shi Pavilion.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Xu Ziyan felt a bit strange. These two places didn\u2019t sound very special, why would the servant act like that? \u201cWhat\u2019s so fun about these two places?\u201dAfter seeing this reaction, the servant smiled bitterly, \u201cwell\u2026the girls in Liu Yun Pavilion are all very beautiful\u2026and Cai Shi Pavilion\u2026you can earn a huge amount if you\u2019re lucky.\u201dXu Ziyan, \u201c\u2026\u201dWell, in the ancient world, the only places for entertainment would be brothels and casinos.Hmm\u2026no matter if it\u2019s a cultivator or not, these two kinds of places would never be attractive to the others.Xu Zirong was initially quite unhappy, now that he knew Liu Yun Pavilion was a brothel, he looked even more upset. His eyes looked extremely sharp and cold, and he was staring at the servant. If his brother wasn\u2019t there, he really wanted to tear the servant apart.His elder brother still preferred women, and he knew clearly about that. Given his age, it\u2019s a perfectly normal thing to visit brothels.However, in Liu Guang sect, there\u2019s no way for anyone to explore brothels. He had never expected that someone would instantly invite his brother after they went outside.The poor servant suddenly felt chills down his spine. He turned his head and looked at Xu Zirong, who looked at him extremely coldly.The servant thought, \u201cthat\u2019s so scary\u2026what have I done wrong\u2026\u201dXu Ziyan didn\u2019t notice that Xu Zirong was looking at the servant as if he\u2019d murder him. He thought for a while, then clapped his hands, \u201cwell, let\u2019s visit the Liu Yun Pavilion then.\u201dAs soon as Xu Ziyan said so, Xu Zirong had an even more horrifying facial expression. The servant was like a mouse spotted by a snake and he was trying to escape from the scenario. He was wrong, he really shouldn\u2019t have recommended the two places to the Xu brothers\u2026\u201cHuh? Zirong, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dBefore the servant was \u201ckilled\u201d by Xu Zirong\u2019s look, Xu Ziyan finally saw Xu Zirong\u2019s look.\u201cBrother\u2026Are you going to the brothel?\u201d Xu Zirong\u2019s face was full of disgust. It\u2019s such a filthy place, how could he let his elder brother go there?Seeing Zirong\u2019s disgusted look, Xu Ziyan hurriedly explained, \u201cwe\u2019ll just check out the place, it\u2019s not like we have to find a girl or something.\u201dXu Zirong didn\u2019t become happier after hearing the answer. Just check out the place? His brother just wanted to check out the women! It turned out that he really preferred women!Well\u2026there\u2019s absolutely no way!\u201cXu\u2026Young Master\u2026\u201d The servant avoided the powerful and threatening gaze of Xu Zirong and he stuttered, \u201cum\u2026Liu Yun Pavilion is not a brothel\u2026the girls there will just drink and sing with you, they won\u2019t sleep with you.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Xu Ziyan was surprised, he didn\u2019t expect that Liu Yun Pavilion to be such an elegant\u2026brothel.\u201cThat\u2019s better, let\u2019s go, Zirong, you have grown up too, it\u2019s time to get to know something new. Then, in case someone seduces you, you will still have some power of resistance.\u201d Xu Ziyan laughed.Xu Ziyan was kind of teasing, and that was indeed something that worried him.With Xu Zirong\u2019s charming looks, there would certainly be female cultivators approaching him. Xu Ziyan really didn\u2019t want his brothers to be defeated by a woman.A young man his age would usually be sexually impulsive. He really needed to be trained in a brothel to increase his power of resistance. After that, he would not be tempted by women so easily.With Xu Ziyan\u2019s persistence, Xu Zirong followed his brother reluctantly.He could not refute Xu Ziyan\u2019s arguments, as every heir in the family had to go through a training like this. At the beginning, Xu Ziyan\u2019s maid, Ruoqi, was specially prepared for him to break his virginity. Unfortunately, Ruoqi seemed to have offended Xu Ziyan, and she was expelled the day Xu Zirong joined the family. Later, Xu Xiao did arrange other girls, yet they were all sent away by Xu Ziyan silently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t want to control his son by sending him different women, just to make him more resistant to female attractiveness. Now that Xu Ziyan could totally withstand any temptation on his own, there\u2019s naturally no need to force him to accept those women.Xu Zirong had deep resentment in his heart, but he couldn\u2019t express it. There was nothing wrong with his brother\u2019s thoughts, but he couldn\u2019t explain to his brother that he already had the ability to resist this kind of temptation.The helpless Xu Zirong could only follow his brother closely and made sure he had no close contact with those prostitutes!The Liu Yun Pavilion was located in the Shangshui Lake to the north of Wuti City. There was an island in the middle of the lake, and Liu Yun Pavilion was on that island.The area of the entire island was not big, only about a thousand hectares, while Liu Yun Pavilion almost occupied three-quarters of the area, leaving only a pier outside for the pick-up and drop-off of guests.They were riding on a flat boat and drifting on the blue lake. The island in the middle of the lake was hidden in layers of white fog, and as the fog moved, one could almost see a corner of the pavilion. The pleasant sound of silk and bamboo seemed to be floating on the shore through layers of fog and it attracted many tourists who wanted to have a look.\u201cThat\u2019s nice, it\u2019s quite romantic.\u201d Xu Ziyan said with a smile when he was looking at the pier that they started to see.Xu Zirong looked at it without any facial expression. Romantic, what\u2019s that about? He would only hate that place, he wouldn\u2019t like it a bit.\u201cWell, Zirong, cheer up a bit. Just think of us being tourists. It\u2019s a brothel, not a dragon\u2019s cave.\u201d After seeing the dull look on Zirong\u2019s face, Xu Ziyan felt a bit helpless. He wanted Xu Zirong to see as many women as he could so that he could resist any future temptation more easily. However, Xu Zirong just kept looking so angry. It\u2019s not just a plain expression, it\u2019s very obvious that he\u2019s pissed off.If they entered the brothel like that, he was sure that no woman would approach them. In that case, this training was just meaningless.Xu Zirong turned his face silently and he looked at Xu Ziyan without moving away his gaze, \u201ctourists?\u201dXu Ziyan felt a bit dumbfounded. He didn\u2019t know what\u2019s been going on. After he woke up from his closed-door cultivation, he\u2019d felt that the grown up Zirong would sometimes give him a sense of oppression.\u201cSo, my brother isn\u2019t here to see beautiful women?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d Xu Ziyan replied somewhat dumbfounded. He really just wanted to join in the fun. After all, he had never been to such a place before, though he\u2019d by lying if he said that he\u2019s not curious at all. It\u2019s only that\u2026he\u2019d never expected Xu Zirong to think that he\u2019s here for the beautiful prostitutes\u2026well, perhaps it\u2019s part of the many reasons, but he mainly wanted to train Xu Zirong.After realizing that Xu Zirong hadn\u2019t changed his attitude because of his answer, Xu Ziyan rolled his eyes, and there\u2019s a smirk on his face, 'speaking of beauty, who else would be more beautiful than my Zirong?\u201dObviously, this sentence had caused quite an amazing effect. Xu Zirong\u2019s cheeks began to turn red slowly, and Xu Ziyan was shocked to see that.Uh\u2026Actually, Xu Ziyan said this just to lighten the atmosphere. Well\u2026perhaps not entirely. Zirong was a handsome guy, yet as his elder brother, Xu Ziyan would apparently not discuss his his appearance that way. However, Xu Ziyan would never expect him to blush just because of one sentence, especially when he usually appeared to be so calm and cool\u2026Oops\u2026he seemed to have joked too much. Xu Ziyan started to have a headache. However, after seeing that Xu Zirong had stopped being angry, he stopped his urge to explain.He felt that it\u2019d just be useful if he explained more\u2026well, all in all, Zirong was a beauty, no? So what was he struggling with?Xu Ziyan rubbed his forehead and thought, \u201cis it because I still haven\u2019t adapted to the adult version of Zirong after he grew up?\u201dXu Zirong was sitting quietly on one side, he could feel Xu Ziyan\u2019s inner struggle without looking at him.
