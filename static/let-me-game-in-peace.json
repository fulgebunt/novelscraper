Via hunting these dimensional creatures, humans acquire their powers\u2026\u201d As the grizzled Yu Qiubai lectured, he would occasionally cast his gaze to the corner seat at the back of the classroom.The other students were listening attentively, but the boy in the corner had his textbook in front of him while sleeping with his arm lay outstretched on the table. From time to time, one could hear faint snoring.Yu Qiubai shook his head indiscernibly as he sighed inwardly. So what if you are talented? What can you accomplish if you falter from a single setback? Although the setback from that failure was big, not recovering from it really doesn\u2019t make him live up to the former principal\u2019s approbation of him.Yu Qiubai recalled what the former principal had said to him before his retirement. Looking back at the boy sleeping soundly on the table with drool hanging from the corner of his lips, he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head and sigh.\u201cQiubai, I\u2019ve seen many geniuses in my life. In summary, there are two types of geniuses.\u201d The former principal back then had very bright eyes.\u201cWhat are the two types?\u201d Yu Qiubai had asked curiously.\u201cOne type of genius is called Zhou Wen, the other type is the other geniuses.\u201dThe former principal\u2019s words left a deep impression on Yu Qiubai, but the student who was given heaps of praises by the former principal was now a degenerate, one who had no intention of improving himself. All he did was sleep in class. After class, he would be gaming on his cellphone.Yu Qiubai had attempted to bolster Zhou Wen\u2019s confidence in the past, hoping that he could rally him up. But despite the numerous pep talks, Zhou Wen remained the same. He continued sleeping in class and gaming out of class. He didn\u2019t focus on cultivation as though he had lost all sense of enterprise.Ring!With the bell ringing to mark the end of class, Yu Qiubai saw Zhou Wen sit straight up, having awoken from his sweet slumber. Without even turning back, he grabbed his phone and rushed out of the classroom. This only disappointed Yu Qiubai as he muttered with a sigh, \u201cPrincipal, I\u2019ve tried my best. Unfortunately, Zhou Wen is a hopeless case.\u201dZhou Wen jogged the entire way and soon left the building before coming to a secluded corner in the school compound.He wasn\u2019t oblivious to the strange looks his teachers and schoolmates gave him, but he didn\u2019t take it to heart.Others believed that Zhou Wen had wallowed in self-misery because he had failed to handle the setback, but he knew very well that he had never taken the defeat to heart. The reason he was \u201cabandoning himself to vice\u201d was due to an incomprehensible reason that even he couldn\u2019t explain.After unlocking his phone, with great familiarity, Zhou Wen launched a game program called \u201cAnt Nest\u201d. Soon, the phone\u2019s screen revealed the dark interior of an ant nest. The meandering paths had countless black ants crawling about.After ensuring that no one was looking at him, Zhou Wen pricked his finger and dripped a drop of blood onto the screen.A strange scene happened the next second. The drop of blood seeped into the screen as a blood-colored avatar appeared in the game screen of Ant Nest. Beside the blood-colored avatar was a stat window.Zhou WenAge: 16 yearsLifeform level: MortalStrength: 9Speed: 5Constitution: 8Primordial Energy: 4Primordial Energy Art: Ascetic MeditationPrimordial Energy Skills: NonePrimordial Energy Pet: NoneEver since the dimensional storms, all sorts of dimensional life forms had appeared. They were roughly categorized as Mortal, Legendary, Epic, and Mythical. Humans stood at the bottom of the totem pole as Mortals. By cultivating in Primordial Energy Arts, they could raise their constitutions and evolve to higher life forms.However, simply cultivating in a Primordial Energy Art to hone one\u2019s body and evolve was extremely slow. Hunting dimensional creatures and robbing them of their dimensional crystals for one\u2019s own use allowed accelerated evolution.Pan-dimensional creatures lurked in dangerous places. Other than the zones where humanity had explored, the other zones were almost a sure ticket to death. Not everyone was willing to risk their lives.Furthermore, Earth\u2019s federation had clear rules\u2014underaged youths were forbidden entry into the dimensional zones.The Ascetic Meditation, which Zhou Wen had cultivated, was also a Primordial Energy Art. It solely relied on arduously tempering one\u2019s body to cultivate Primordial Energy without the reliance on external forces.In the federation, there were plenty of sixteen-year-old geniuses who could produce Primordial Energy from cultivation, but few people on Earth could do it simply by cultivating Ascetic Meditation and tempering his body to produce Primordial Energy, especially without any external help. He was the only one capable of doing so in the history of the small town of Guide City 1 .Shortly after, every teacher and student in Guide High School believed that Zhou Wen would achieve great things in the future. Then, one day a transfer student came to Guide High School and challenged him. To everyone\u2019s surprise, the transfer student defeated him in one strike. Furthermore, it was done by a girl.Zhou Wen stopped cultivating arduously after that. He appeared to abandon himself to vice. People imagined that he was mentally weak and couldn\u2019t suffer the setback, but Zhou Wen knew very well that his change had nothing to do with the failure. It was completely because of the mysterious phone in his hand.Zhou Wen looked down at his phone as he kept controlling the blood-colored avatar on it to slay the black ants in an Ant Nest.\u201cKilled Mortal creature, Vigor Ant\u2026 Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant\u2026 Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant\u2026\u201dNotifications quickly flashed past as he killed every ant.Ding!After killing countless Vigor Ants, he suddenly heard a crisp sound as a special notice appeared on the screen: Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant. Discovered Primordial Energy Crystal.Zhou Wen focused his gaze and saw a crystalline body resembling a diamond that appeared after a Vigor Ant was killed. On it was the number five.He was delighted as he hurriedly controlled the blood-colored avatar to pick up the Primordial Energy Crystal. The moment the Primordial Energy Crystal touched its fingers, it immediately transformed into a strange aura that drilled into the blood-colored avatar\u2019s body.Simultaneously, Zhou Wen felt strength surge into his body from his phone as though he had been struck by lightning. It caused the Primordial Energy within him to be rapidly replenished.The Primordial Energy entry in the blood-colored avatar\u2019s stats went from four to five.After killing a dimensional creature, there was a chance that various kinds of crystals would drop. The most common crystals were Strength, Speed, Constitution, and Primordial Energy Crystals.The usage of Strength Crystals enhanced the Strength of humans, while using Speed Crystals increased one\u2019s speed. The other crystals had similar effects.But in reality, crystals didn\u2019t have numeric displays. Humans couldn\u2019t see their own stats and only knew that their Strength increased after using a Strength Crystal without knowing the exact quantitative increase.The mysterious phone in Zhou Wen\u2019s hand not only allowed him to obtain dimensional crystals that others had to risk their lives in dimensional zones to obtain, but it also allowed him to see the numeric values of the dimensional creatures, himself, as well as the dimensional crystals.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEver since he had obtained that phone, Zhou Wen had spent nearly every moment grinding on it with a game. In turn, he received all kinds of dimensional crystals.In the past, his Strength was 7, Speed was 4, Constitution was 7, and Primordial Energy was 1. After receiving the dimensional crystals from grinding, he had raised all these values in slightly more than a month. If it were in the past, it might have taken him years to even develop so quickly.After using large numbers of dimensional crystals, Zhou Wen realized a set of rules. No matter which dimensional crystal it was, as long as its value was higher than his, using it would result in his stats directly rising to the same value as the said dimensional crystal.But if the dimensional crystal\u2019s value was lower or the same as his, it could only replenish some of his energy. Then, by cultivating the Primordial Energy Art, he could raise his own stats instead of a direct raise.This also meant that the higher the dimensional crystal\u2019s value was, the better. Its effects on Zhou Wen would also be amplified. However, having killed so many Vigor Ants in the Ant Nest, the highest Strength Crystal he had seen was a 9. The highest Constitution Crystal was only an 8. Speed Crystals were all low in value. Primordial Energy Crystals were extremely rare. The 5 he had received today were the highest valued he had seen to date.Zhou Wen had considered the possibility that it had something to do with the Vigor Ants\u2019 natural makeup. They were outstanding when it came to their Strength and Constitution, but their Speed was lacking. This was also why the Strength Crystals that he received were relatively high in value, while Speed Crystals weren\u2019t much to speak of.However, even low-valued dimensional crystals could be used as energy supplements, allowing Zhou Wen to quickly cultivate Ascetic Meditation; thus, it wasn\u2019t completely useless.The only regret was that the crystals that dropped in the game were directly absorbed upon contact with the blood-colored avatar. They couldn\u2019t be brought to the real world; otherwise, just the sale of the low-valued crystals he had no use for would be enough to make him quite a wealthy person.There were many ants in the Ant Nest, and whenever they discovered Zhou Wen\u2019s blood-colored avatar, the number that gathered only increased.After killing over a hundred Vigor Ants, another dimensional crystal dropped. Unfortunately, it was a Strength Crystal 3 and could only be used for energy replenishment.The drop rate of dimensional crystals wasn\u2019t high, and most of them were valued at 3 or lower. The higher-valued ones had extremely low drop rates, so Zhou Wen could only rely on massive amounts of grinding to raise the chances of him getting them.This was also the reason he often slept in class and stopped cultivating\u2014apart from classes, he spent the rest of his time grinding, even at night. He didn\u2019t have the time or energy to cultivate or pay attention in class.Even so, the rate at which he strengthened himself was incomparable to the past. If he had only cultivated Ascetic Meditation like before, the time it took to raise his Primordial Energy to 5 would have been several times or even dozens of times longer.As the number of Vigor Ants increased, Zhou Wen was beginning to feel overwhelmed. Before long, the blood-colored avatar was inundated by Vigor Ants, and the screen went black.Zhou Wen had no choice but to restart the game by dripping a drop of blood onto the game\u2019s screen. His blood was akin to a 1-Up in games\u2014one drop of blood was a life.With the game launched, he embarked on his grinding again, killing one Vigor Ant after another. However, Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t too lucky this time. Not a single dimensional crystal dropped despite killing over a hundred Vigor Ants.Since Zhou Wen was a sedate person and not quick-tempered, he continued to patiently grind in the Ant Nest.Suddenly, he saw a somewhat special Vigor Ant amidst the hordes.This Vigor Ant was blood-red in color as though it was completely covered in blood. It stood out among the other black Vigor Ants, and its head was slightly bigger. Zhou Wen noticed it immediately.Upon noticing the red Vigor Ant gearing for a charge, Zhou Wen cautiously probed it and found its Strength and Speed was far greater than other black Vigor Ants. However, it was still manageable for him.After positioning the blood-colored avatar several times, it managed to hit the red Vigor Ant, but only dealt minor damage to it. He had failed to slay it.However, there was still clear progress\u2014the red Vigor Ant\u2019s health bar was slowly dropping. Perhaps about a hundred strikes were needed to slay it.Thankfully, the red Vigor Ant was only slightly faster than the typical black Vigor Ant. The blood-colored avatar had enough time to position itself and dodge, so killing it was only a matter of time.However, the black Vigor Ants were increasing in number. The development worried Zhou Wen because, at this speed, he might be swarmed by the ant horde before he successfully killed the red Vigor Ant.However, no idea came to mind for the time being. Zhou Wen could only do his best to control the blood-colored avatar\u2019s speed to deal damage to the red Vigor Ant.Just as the red Vigor Ant\u2019s health bar almost depleted to zero, the surrounding Vigor Ants increased, giving the blood-colored avatar no space to circle around the former.Crack!The blood-colored avatar failed to dodge in time and was bitten by a black Vigor Ant. Instantly, its health bar was almost halved.Zhou Wen knew that he was at the end of the rope. All he could do was to use the blood-colored avatar to deliver one final strike with all its might at the red Vigor Ant.Boom!When the punch landed, the red Vigor Ant\u2019s vital spot was struck. Its final bit of health was depleted and its red carapace instantly exploded. Two crystals burst out from its carcass.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t have the luxury to see what type of dimensional crystals they were. His blood-colored avatar was in a critical state as the two crystals were picked up.Moments after the blood-colored avatar picked up the two dimensional crystals, it was swarmed by the Vigor Ant horde, and before long, the screen went black.Zhou Wen looked at the two notifications that appeared on the screen. He heaved a deep sigh of relief for he had had similar experiences. As long as he could pick up a dimensional crystal before dying, the effects would be applied.\u201cKilled Mortal creature, Vigor Ant. Discovered Primordial Energy Crystal.\u201d\u201cKilled Mortal creature, Vigor Ant. Discovered Vigor Ant Crystal.\u201dUpon seeing the two notifications on the screen, Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t help but be taken aback. He had seen a Primordial Energy Crystal drop plenty of times, but a dimensional crystal named after Vigor Ants was a first.After a brief pause, Zhou Wen reacted. Although he had never seen such dimensional crystals, he had heard of their existence. In textbooks and videos on the Internet, people had used similar crystals. However, they weren\u2019t Vigor Ant Crystals, but crystals of other dimensional creatures.Could it be that this is one of those legendary dimensional crystals? While Zhou Wen was feeling exhilarated, he felt a strange force from his phone spread through his body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA force surged through Zhou Wen\u2019s body like a bolt of lightning. He was no stranger to such a feeling for it was the feeling he received when absorbing Primordial Energy Crystals. However, this absorption was far more intense than anything he had previously felt. It was many times more intense than his past absorption of the five-valued Primordial Energy Crystal.What\u2019s the value of this Primordial Energy Crystal? Why is it so intense? As Zhou Wen reeled in delight, he felt another force surge into his body.Unlike the Primordial Energy Crystal, this force surged through his body like an electric snake, opening up his originally sealed meridians, opening up a strange new path.It\u2019s true\u2026 The Vigor Ant Crystal is a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal as spoken in legends\u2026 However, I wonder what this Vigor Ant\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill is\u2026 Zhou Wen was filled with anticipation.As the electric snake-like force flowed through his body, Zhou Wen\u2019s Primordial Energy was being stirred as it began circulating in the newly opened pathways.Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that with the circulation of the Primordial Energy, his hands turned blood-red with a metallic sheen. Furthermore, he had a strange swollen feeling. Although his palms didn\u2019t increase in size, it made him feel that his hands contained an immense strength, one that was eager to blast out his palms.Now, Zhou Wen had the urge to deal a punch, but he ultimately held back. He was on campus, and it wasn\u2019t in his best interest to cause a commotion. Furthermore, any damage to public property required him to pay compensation.Nearly twenty minutes later, the swelling feeling gradually subsided. His hands recovered to normal as the Primordial Energy in him stopped circulating. However, Zhou Wen knew that this Primordial Energy blast skill had been imprinted deep in his body and soul. It had seemingly become innate to his body, something he could not forget no matter how he tried.Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t wait to look at his phone. The game interface had already gone black. He immediately restarted the game and dripped a drop of blood in. When his in-game avatar appeared, he immediately checked his character stats.Zhou WenAge: 16 yearsLifeform level: MortalStrength: 9Speed: 5Constitution: 8Primordial Energy: 9Primordial Energy Art: Ascetic MeditationPrimordial Energy Skill: Vigor Divine Fist (Rank 7)Companion Beast: None\u2014Zhou Wen was overjoyed. His Primordial Energy had risen all the way to 9. It meant that the Primordial Energy Crystal he had absorbed was valued at 9. And the Rank 7 indicated behind Vigor Divine Fist was similar to seven-valued stat crystals. Without any cultivation, Zhou Wen\u2019s Vigor Divine Fist had reached a rather high rank.As Primordial Energy Skills were relatively rare, they were rather expensive. However, after receiving this Skill, he would make use of it. He could greatly enhance his various abilities, unleashing combat strength that far exceeded his normal standards. It gave him the important means to protect himself and kill enemies. No one would dislike having too many Primordial Energy Skills.In the past, Zhou Wen had lacked the finances to purchase Primordial Energy Skill Crystals and with him fully focused on cultivating Ascetic Meditation, he lacked the time and energy to practice the Skills. This Vigor Divine Fist was his first Primordial Energy Skill, and from its name and effects, it was likely a skill that enhanced the strength of both his fists.Indeed, the Ant Nest in the game is identical to the dimensional zones in the real world. Does this mean that the game will also drop Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen felt slightly pumped.As he began grinding again in the game, his avatar was similarly able to use Vigor Divine Fist. Eagerly, Zhou Wen made his avatar use Vigor Divine Fist to see its might.Boom!The blood-colored avatar struck a Vigor Ant, bashing its head into its body. Then, its body exploded due to the immense pressure. Its flesh, blood, and carapace splattered everywhere, reducing it to a blob.Zhou Wen was alarmed and delighted upon seeing this. The blood-colored avatar was equivalent to a clone. If it could produce such might, it also meant that he could do the same in reality.In the past, he had needed several strikes to kill a Vigor Ant, and that had needed him to strike a vital spot. Vigor Divine Fist could ignore the Vigor Ant\u2019s carapace\u2019s defense and directly blast them apart. Its strength was frighteningly potent.However, although Vigor Divine Fist was powerful, this punch expended 4 Primordial Energy. With Zhou Wen\u2019s maximum Primordial Energy at 9, he could only deliver two strikes before he was drained.Although Primordial Energy could recover on its own, it happened rather slowly. Zhou Wen took an hour to recover one point, so it was sorely insufficient to keep up with his expenditure.Of course, he could also use Primordial Energy Crystals to quickly recover Primordial Energy. To most people, this was an extremely extravagant act.Although he had received a Primordial Energy Skill, he could only use it as a trump card for now. Zhou Wen continued patiently grinding as before, hoping that a more magical drop would appear.Grinding was undoubtedly dull and boring. However, for a person who could hone his body and cultivate Primordial Energy through Ascetic Meditation before the age of sixteen, this boredom was nothing.While Zhou Wen was holding his phone and engrossed with grinding, he suddenly sensed someone approaching him. Looking up, he saw a tall girl in a high-school uniform walk over.Zhou Wen turned to look around her. Students typically didn\u2019t come here, and it was the same at present. He was apparently the only person around for dozens of meters, and it was for this reason that he chose this spot to game.Don\u2019t tell me Fang Ruoxi is looking for me? Zhou Wen looked at the girl walking straight towards him, and in response, he could only put away his phone for he didn\u2019t wish for anyone to see what was on it. Otherwise, it could invite huge trouble for him.Fang Ruoxi was tall, standing at a height of 1.75 meters. At this age, she wasn\u2019t short among men and would stand out among women.Although she was tall, her body proportions were excellent. Together with her slender body and constant training, she didn\u2019t seem too big in size. Her long, slender legs and exaggerated curves gave quite a strong visual impact. She had a primal charm of a feral nature.Fang Ruoxi\u2019s name was quite a demure name for a girl, but it didn\u2019t match her character. She was a rather proud girl. Before An Jing transferred over, Fang Ruoxi and Zhou Wen were considered the two most illustrious geniuses in Guide High School.However, the two of them weren\u2019t in the same class. They both had asocial characters, and as Zhou Wen spent most of his time focusing on cultivating Ascetic Meditation and honing his body, the two never had much interaction other than the polite greeting from time to time.Fang Ruoxi was clearly here for Zhou Wen. It left him perplexed, unsure why she was looking for him.\u201cZhou Wen, I wish to invite you to join my team for the combat test at the end of the graduation exams.\u201d Fang Ruoxi came before Zhou Wen and said those startling words to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe cultivation of Primordial Energy Art already played an important role in the Earth Federation\u2019s physical education system. Apart from the ordinary subjects tested at the college entrance examinations, there was a special combat test.As combat tests were dangerous, not every candidate needed to participate, and the results weren\u2019t included in the overall score of the entrance examinations. It was completely voluntary to participate, but to apply for some special schools, the results of a combat test was necessary for standardization purposes.In the past ten years, more and more famous schools used the results of the combat test as one of the standards for student recruitment.Of course, to get a job involving dimensional zones, the results on the combat test was a very good prerequisite.Although Zhou Wen could obtain dimensional crystals from the phone without him risking his life to enter dimensional zones, he still planned on taking the combat test and enter a school focused on cultivation. This would aid him in getting a job related to the dimensional zones in the future.If Zhou Wen didn\u2019t involve himself in any dimensional zone work, he wouldn\u2019t have the sources or channels to obtain dimensional crystals. This would make it difficult for him to explain his rapid growth or any Companion Beasts he might receive in the future.By hiding in plain sight he would not garner the notice of others, just as a diamond would be lost in a sea of crystals.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t wish to risk his life at the dimensional zones, but he needed to have a job involving such matters. At the very least, he needed a channel to obtain dimensional items. This way, he wouldn\u2019t be suspected when he used large numbers of dimensional crystals in the future.The combat test wasn\u2019t a solo affair. Instead, it was carried out in a team of four. Apart from one\u2019s individual combat prowess, teamwork, leadership, and other traits influenced the final results.If one were to be the final man standing in the combat test, with the other teammates dropping out ahead of time or an accident happening, one\u2019s score would be greatly affected, even if the individual did very well to receive high individual scores.Zhou Wen had quite a good reputation in Guide High School in the past. He was an ideal teammate, but in the past month or so, his image and reputation had drastically declined. There were also significant doubts about his abilities.It was still understandable if an ordinary student were to team up with him, but for Fang Ruoxi who had a chance of coming first in the Guide City combat test, there wasn\u2019t a good reason for her to recruit him.Zhou Wen had been famous because of his cultivation of Ascetic Meditation. But when it came to actual strength, there were a few sixteen-year-olds in Guide High School who had cultivated Primordial Energy. However, they were not like Zhou Wen who simply relied on honing his body to cultivate Primordial Energy. They had more or less absorbed Primordial Energy Crystals to supplement their cultivation.\u201cWhy are you recruiting me?\u201d Zhou Wen asked Fang Ruoxi with piqued interest.Fang Ruoxi and Zhou Wen locked gazes. Her eyes were clear and untainted like a mountain spring.\u201cI want to do my best to get a high score on the combat test, so I need a strong teammate. And you have that strength,\u201d Fang Ruoxi said calmly.\u201cYou are referring to me from a month ago, right?\u201dFang Ruoxi\u2019s glimmering eyes stared at Zhou Wen intently as she said firmly, \u201cFrom what I see, Zhou Wen is Zhou Wen. He has never changed. You are still the only person in Guide High School that I view as my match.\u201dZhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He was rather surprised that Fang Ruoxi thought so highly of him. He couldn\u2019t help but feel some indescribable, odd feelings.\u201cWhat\u2019s An Jing if you say something like that?\u201d Zhou Wen said in a self-deprecating manner. Although he wasn\u2019t concerned about his defeat under An Jing\u2019s hands, he had to admit that she was much stronger than he was.Fang Ruoxi sighed. \u201cI said the only person in Guide High School. An Jing was never one of us. Also, she will not be participating in the college entrance exams here.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Zhou Wen was taken aback.\u201cDon\u2019t you know? She has already transferred out.\u201d Fang Ruoxi paused and continued, \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know An Jing\u2019s origins, I\u2019m certain that she has exceeded the Mortal stage. To reach such a stage at her age, she must have quite a remarkable background. And with that strength of hers, it was completely unnecessary to challenge you. Furthermore, her arrival and departure happened so suddenly. It gives the feeling that she just came here to beat you up. I even imagined that you were acquainted with her and had crossed her somehow.\u201dZhou Wen had never thought too much about it previously. Now, on careful thought, it did seem to be the case. He could, however, be sure that he had never met An Jing before, much less have crossed her.\u201cHow is that possible? I\u2019ve never met her before. How could I have crossed her?\u201d Zhou Wen tried carefully recalling, but couldn\u2019t figure out how he could have had bad blood with her.\u201cPerhaps I was just overthinking it.\u201d Fang Ruoxi didn\u2019t continue on the topic as she looked at Zhou Wen and asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019s your answer?\u201d\u201cSince you are willing to team up with me, I naturally don\u2019t mind cozying up to someone powerful,\u201d Zhou Wen said with a shrug.\u201cThen it\u2019s a deal. I\u2019ve already found the other two teammates. Starting today, the four of us will train together during cultivation classes in the afternoon. We need to ensure that we have the necessary teamwork and coordination during the combat test.\u201d Fang Ruoxi looked at her wristwatch and turned to say to Zhou Wen, \u201cCome on. Cultivation classes are about to begin.\u201dWhen Li Zhi and Tian Xiangdong watched Fang Ruoxi return with Zhou Wen, they were quite surprised. They knew that she had gone to find their fourth teammate, but weren\u2019t aware of who she had in mind.Now, upon realizing that it was Zhou Wen, they felt puzzled. They all knew of Zhou Wen\u2019s antics over the past month.Cultivation was in an ever-regressive state, especially combat. Even frequent practice made it difficult to seize fleeting opportunities in battle. The lack of practice for a few days greatly slowed down one\u2019s reflexes. Considering how Zhou Wen hadn\u2019t practiced for over a month with him completely engrossed in gaming, to the point of looking pale and sickly, it was almost a certainty that his combat abilities had drastically fallen.It was just like a professional boxer. They needed enough time to recover and train after a period of zero practice to compete in matches again. No one could become stronger doing nothing. They only became weaker.They weren\u2019t that far off from the college entrance exams, and even if Zhou Wen made a comeback like a prodigal son, it would be very difficult for him to recover his original combat prowess.\u201cRuoxi, don\u2019t tell me the fourth teammate is Zhou Wen? Is this a joke!?\u201d Tian Xiangdong rubbed his nose and said in an exaggerated manner.\u201cI\u2019m not joking. Zhou Wen will be our fourth teammate,\u201d Fang Ruoxi said in all seriousness.Tian Xiangdong looked at Fang Ruoxi and then at Zhou Wen. He habitually rubbed his nose and said, \u201cRuoxi, all of us know how talented and capable Zhou Wen is, but he hasn\u2019t been training for more than a month. Even if he were to restart his training now, it will be difficult for him to recover his former standards. Our goal is to be first in Guide City\u2019s combat test. I don\u2019t think Zhou Wen is the best candidate? Why don\u2019t we do this? I have some ties with Zheng Yi. If you feel uncomfortable asking him, I\u2019ll do the invitation. How about that?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTian Xiangdong\u2019s words were clearly directed at Zhou Wen, but the latter wasn\u2019t angered.The combat test at the college entrance exam was key to the latter half of an average person\u2019s life. Anyone would hope to do their best and not have others affect their own results.Whether one could attend a reputable school, find a decent job after graduation, or even have the chance of entering high society, was highly tied to the test.Furthermore, the strength of a teammate affected one\u2019s safety. No one wished to use their lives as a joke.Even Zhou Wen had aimed for a reputable school before he obtained the mysterious phone. This gave him more opportunities to become stronger and not let his talent go to waste. Therefore, Zhou Wen could fully comprehend Tian Xiangdong\u2019s rationale for saying such things.After Tian Xiangdong said his piece, he stopped looking at Fang Ruoxi and stared at Zhou Wen.Fang Ruoxi looked at Zhou Wen and said, \u201cZheng Yi might be outstanding as well, but I think Zhou Wen is the best candidate.\u201dBy the side, Li Zhi thought and said, \u201cWe know you have an eye for talent, Ruoxi. Zhou Wen is indeed outstanding, but the combat test results are very important to all of us. We have to treat it with utmost seriousness. Let\u2019s do this. If Zhou Wen doesn\u2019t mind, we can do a simple test. Once the results of the test are out, it will be obvious if Zhou Wen suits our team.\u201d\u201cLi Zhi\u2019s right. I agree,\u201d Tian Xiangdong said immediately.\u201cWhat kind of test?\u201d Fang Ruoxi asked.\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be simple? I\u2019m the weakest among the three of us. Let Zhou Wen fight me in combat. As long as he wins me, he will naturally be qualified to join our team. You wouldn\u2019t call that bullying, right?\u201d Tian Xiangdong hurriedly said.Fang Ruoxi didn\u2019t say a word and looked at Zhou Wen.Zhou Wen knew that he needed to voice his opinion at such times; otherwise, it would be difficult for him to join the team. Although he wasn\u2019t too interested in joining this team, he still wished to get good results for the combat test. Fang Ruoxi\u2019s team was likely considered the strongest team at Guide High School, so there was definitely no harm in joining them.\u201cI\u2019m fine with that. However, actual combat has risks. It would be terrible if anyone gets injured,\u201d Zhou Wen said with a nod.Tian Xiangdong laughed in response. \u201cZhou Wen, I know you\u2019ve been cultivating Ascetic Meditation. Your Constitution and Strength must be extraordinary, but your Speed must be lacking. I won\u2019t take advantage of your weaknesses. Why don\u2019t we determine the winner through a Strength competition?\u201dFang Ruoxi couldn\u2019t help but frown when she heard Tian Xiangdong.Tian Xiangdong cultivated Lightning Art and it was also a Primordial Energy Art that primarily unleashed massive bursts of strength. Tian Xiangdong had also coupled Lightning Art with a Primordial Energy Skill, Lighting Fist. Tian Xiangdong\u2019s Lightning Fist had only reached Rank 1, however, among typical high school students, the chances of them coming into contact with a Primordial Energy Skill was rather low. To grasp one Primordial Energy Skill, especially one that matched their Primordial Energy Art, was very rare.Fang Ruoxi didn\u2019t know Zhou Wen\u2019s family background, but from the way he cultivated a Primordial Energy Art like Ascetic Meditation, without ever purchasing any supplementary Primordial Energy Crystals, it was highly likely that his family wasn\u2019t well-to-do. If he couldn\u2019t even afford Primordial Energy Crystals, how could he have the money to buy the expensive Primordial Energy Skill Crystals?Furthermore, in his battle with An Jing, he hadn\u2019t used any Primordial Energy Skills.Fang Ruoxi\u2019s lips quivered, but she didn\u2019t say a word. She thought inwardly, \u201cLet\u2019s see how Zhou Wen will handle this.\u201dZhou Wen looked at Tian Xiangdong and asked, \u201cHow do we compete in Strength?\u201d\u201cAlthough the school has a Strength-measuring device, those lifeless numbers don\u2019t mean much. Let\u2019s exchange blows. Whoever retreats loses. How about that?\u201d Tian Xiangdong said with squinted eyes.\u201cI think it\u2019s better we use the school\u2019s Strength-measure device,\u201d Zhou Wen said after some thought.\u201cWhy? Are you afraid of me injuring you?\u201d Tian Xiangdong said, curling his lips.Zhou Wen smiled without a word. He was more afraid of killing Tian Xiangdong with one punch.Tian Xiangdong\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill, Lightning Fist, wasn\u2019t a secret at school. Just relying on strength alone probably couldn\u2019t beat him. Therefore, if Zhou Wen used Vigor Divine Fist, he was afraid that a single punch would obliterate Tian Xiangdong\u2019s arm as well as his body.\u201cAlright. Since you\u2019re afraid, let\u2019s use the Strength-measuring device,\u201d Tian Xiangdong said, feeling some regret.For the past three years in high school, all the teachers and students had claimed that Zhou Wen was the number one genius of Guide High School. Tian Xiangdong naturally wasn\u2019t very accepting of this accolade and had long wished to prove himself by defeating Zhou Wen.This was a tiny wish many top students at the school had. After Zhou Wen was defeated by An Jing\u2019s single blow, this desire subsided significantly.However, since there was a chance to defeat him, Tian Xiangdong still held some anticipation and excitement. After all, Zhou Wen was once honored as Guide High School\u2019s number one genius.The only thing that left Tian Xiangdong regretful was that he couldn\u2019t personally defeat Zhou Wen as An Jing did. All he could do was defeat him with numbers on a Strength-measuring device.Now that it was lunchtime, the device room didn\u2019t have any students. As always, Yu Qiubai was inspecting the various devices personally, checking to see if there were any problematic ones that could receive timely repairs.Just as Yu Qiubai sat inside a spacecraft-like Primordial Energy-measurement device, he heard someone push open the door. Following that there were footsteps.It\u2019s lunchtime. Who would come here? Yu Qiubai looked out the observation hole from inside the device and discovered that it was Fang Ruoxi, Tian Xiangdong, Li Zhi, and Zhou Wen. He couldn\u2019t help but be somewhat surprised.These four students could basically be considered the top elites of Guide High School\u2019s graduating class. Apart from Zhou Wen\u2019s wallowing in self-misery, the other three were highly anticipated to do well.For the four to come to the device room, including Zhou Wen, left Yu Qiubai curious. He had no idea what they were doing here.Four\u2026 Could these four be forming a team to participate in the combat test\u2026 But with Zhou Wen\u2019s current state\u2026 How could Fang Ruoxi and the rest be willing to form a team with him? Yu Qiubai\u2019s heart stirred as he remained inside the Primordial Energy-measuring device. He was curious as to what they were up to.\u201cWho\u2019s going first? You or me?\u201d Tian Xiangdong walked to the Strength-measuring device and turned to look at Zhou Wen.\u201cAnything works,\u201d Zhou Wen said indifferently.\u201cAnyway, everyone gets three tries. The highest one shall count. Since it doesn\u2019t matter who goes first, I\u2019ll do the honors first,\u201d Tian Xiangdong said as he walked in front of the device.Tian Xiangdong took a deep breath as he circulated his Lightning Art and gathered his strength before smashing his fist into the pressure board on the Strength-measuring device.The pressure board was made up of a metal alloy with hydraulic machinery behind. Based on the different amount of strength delivered, the board would jerk back and produce a figure onscreen.When Tian Xiangdong threw the punch, a series of numbers lit up on the display one after another. It only stopped when it reached 7.Tian Xiangdong hadn\u2019t used Lightning Fist and had only relied on pure Strength. With regard to that, he was rather satisfied with the value of 7.For the average high-school student, a Strength value of 7 was undoubtedly head and shoulders above their peers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTian Xiangdong having 7 for his Strength surprised Zhou Wen slightly.The Strength-measuring device\u2019s value was slightly different from the Strength stat in the game on the phone. However, the difference wasn\u2019t that much. They could basically be considered as sharing the same unit.Before Zhou Wen received the mysterious phone, his Strength was only a 7 as well.\u201cIt\u2019s your turn,\u201d Tian Xiangdong took a step to the side and said to Zhou Wen.Zhou Wen stood in front of the Strength-measuring device as the trio\u2019s eyes landed on him. All of them wanted to know how much strength this former number one genius of Guide High School had left.Inside the Primordial Energy module, Yu Qiubai shared the same sentiments. After spending more than a month as a wastrel, how much more strength did Zhou Wen have?Although Strength wasn\u2019t something that declined as quickly as one\u2019s reaction in combat, having it was one thing, and delivering it was another.Skills to deliver Strength required plenty of practice before one could perfectly release one\u2019s Strength. Over time, one would get rusty; therefore, even if one still had Strength, they could hardly release it completely.Zhou Wen stood in front of the pressure board, taking on a pose to deliver an Inch Punch. It wasn\u2019t a Primordial Energy Skill, but an ordinary combat skill. It was part of the school\u2019s normal teachings.However, Inch Punch was easy to pick up but difficult to master. It was used to deliver the greatest amount of strength at the shortest distance and was one that needed plenty of practice to achieve a certain level of mastery. Furthermore, it was delivered at short distances, so Inch Punch didn\u2019t have any beautiful or cool poses. The typical student was more willing to practice something that showed its effects quickly and punching techniques that appeared domineering.Of course, even more students chose to train in weapons. After all, the damage from weapons in actual combat was far greater than one\u2019s limbs.Upon seeing Zhou Wen nearly plaster his fist to the pressure board, Fang Ruoxi and company realized that he was using Inch Punch.Tian Xiangdong curled his lips and said, \u201cThe explosive strength delivered by Inch Punch is very strong indeed, but it\u2019s not something easily mastered without years of strenuous training. Let\u2019s hope Zhou Wen doesn\u2019t end up overshooting his mark.\u201dAlthough Tian Xiangdong\u2019s words weren\u2019t pleasant, Yu Qiubai agreed. Inch Punch wasn\u2019t easily mastered. Zhou Wen didn\u2019t seem to practice much and in the recent month, he had engrossed himself in gaming. Therefore, to use Inch Punch for a Strength test might end up giving him worse results.Bang!As the quartet was still in thought, they saw Zhou Wen\u2019s fist tremble at an extremely fast speed. It was so fast that they might have imagined themselves seeing things if not for the explosive bang from the pressure board. It was as though Zhou Wen\u2019s fist had never moved.Their eight eyes quickly looked towards the screen. They wished to know the results of Zhou Wen\u2019s punch.The gap\u2019s too tiny! The same thought came to the minds of Tian Xiangdong, Fang Ruoxi, and Li Zhi simultaneously.The distance he threw his punch from was too tiny. Although Inch Punch is about delivering the most amount of Strength with the shortest distance, it\u2019s very difficult to deliver any Strength when the gap is too tiny, just like a person can jump higher when squatting down or retracting an arm to deliver a more powerful punch. Inch Punch goes the whole way. Only true Inch Punch experts can deliver that much Strength at such short distances\u2026 Yu Qiubai had a lot more going on in his mind.When all of them saw the number on the screen, their eyes widened immediately.They saw one number after another light up, and soon 10 was lit up. Zhou Wen\u2019s Inch Punch had delivered 10 points of Strength.10! It\u2019s a 10! How is this possible? Yu Qiubai was pleasantly surprised.Yu Qiubai had been teaching for years.The thought of a high-school student delivering a punch with a Strength of 10, without using any Primordial Energy Skills, was terrifying.Even if the typical student had Strength Crystals to use, it was very difficult for them to reach such levels during high school. This was because typical Strength Crystals were limited when it came to enhancing one\u2019s Strength. Beyond 7, using a typical Strength Crystal was practically useless.One couldn\u2019t have their Strength improve unless one had extremely high-quality Strength Crystals; otherwise, they could only cultivate a Primordial Energy Art to constantly hone their bodies to slowly grow their Strength.But that was just too difficult. Before evolving to the Legendary stage, it was very difficult for the typical human to have Strength reaching a value of 10. Most humans were at 7\u20138 at the Mortal stage.Zhou Wen was clearly still in the Mortal stage; yet, he could deliver Strength valued at 10 with just his muscles alone. This was considered extremely rare even in the entire League. It was probably not an exaggeration to call it one in a million.Could it be that Zhou Wen didn\u2019t wallow in his self-misery? The reason he\u2019s constantly sleeping in class is because of the fatigue from training himself even more excessively? The more Yu Qiubai thought about it, the more he was convinced of his theory. The look he gave Zhou Wen was mixed with approbation and cherishing, as well as relief. It has to be the case. The former principal knows better indeed. I had mistaken him. To have 10 Strength at the Mortal stage is not something anyone in Guide City can match. Even among all the high school students on Earth, he will still be top-class\u2026 What a good child\u2026 It must have been hard on him\u2026The more Yu Qiubai thought about it, the more he fondness he felt for Zhou Wen. He felt that not only was Zhou Wen talented, but the latter also had a good temperament. Ever since he was defeated by An Jing, many people had been wagging their tongues at him. Under such immense pressure, he hadn\u2019t tried to defend himself but had actually managed to cultivate such an impressive step in a short period of time. Such a state of mind and talent was very rare among high school students.\u201cNo way? Delivering 10 without using any Primordial Energy Skills? Don\u2019t tell me this fellow is hiding at home daily and honing his Strength?\u201d Tian Xiangdong couldn\u2019t help but gulp. To deliver 10 Strength at the Mortal stage was just too shocking. It was rare for a tiny city like Guide City to produce such a person.Li Zhi and Fang Ruoxi looked at Zhou Wen with odd looks. Although Fang Ruoxi never believed Zhou Wen to be someone who would wallow in self-misery and that he had trained arduously in private, she had never expected him to attain such progress.From the looks of it, the numbers from the Strength-measuring device are a little different from the game. In-game, my Strength is 9, but in the real world, it\u2019s 10. Zhou Wen thought to himself.\u201cTo be able to deliver 10 Strength, you do live up to your reputation as the number one genius of Guide High School. However, if you believe that you have defeated me, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Tian Xiangdong said as he looked at Zhou Wen.Upon seeing Zhou Wen\u2019s result, Tian Xiangdong was already willing to let the former join their team.Although Tian Xiangdong could deliver more than 10 Strength with Lightning Fist, it was something that expended Primordial Energy. At this present level, he could only deliver one punch in a short period of time, preventing him from using it for long.As for Zhou Wen, he had delivered 10 Strength. He could engage in combat for long periods of time, a huge boon to the team. It was even more useful than Tian Xiangdong\u2019s Lightning Fist.Another reason was Zhou Wen\u2019s Inch Punch. To be able to use that, it was obvious that Zhou Wen hadn\u2019t given up on himself. He must have been secretly cultivating and hadn\u2019t suffered from being rusty with his skills.However, Tian Xiangdong wasn\u2019t willing to admit defeat. He still planned on defeating Zhou Wen before magnanimously voicing out his acceptance of Zhou Wen into the team.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cXiangdong\u2026\u201d Li Zhi was just about to say something when Tian Xiangdong waved his hand to cut him off.The benefits were obvious if a person with Strength 10 could join their team. Li Zhi believed that since Zhou Wen had shown enough of his prowess, there was no need to continue. Making things ugly was not beneficial to any party.If Tian Xiangdong were to use Lightning Fist to defeat Zhou Wen; thus, causing him to leave. It would be a loss for them.Upon seeing Tian Xiangdong walk to the pressure board, Li Zhi had wanted to say this but was stopped by Fang Ruoxi.\u201cIs this really fine?\u201d Li Zhi looked at Fang Ruoxi and said.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. That fellow has already accepted Zhou Wen. He just doesn\u2019t want to lose,\u201d Fang Ruoxi said softly.Li Zhi was slightly taken aback before he was enlightened. He cursed in amusement before falling silent, \u201cThat fellow just can\u2019t bear to play second fiddle.\u201dTian Xiangdong began the second round of Strength tests.Tian Xiangdong\u2019s expression was heavy as he stood in front of the pressure board. He slowly lifted his fist as veins protruded from it. Lightning bolts seemed to mesh together, making it look ferocious and terrifying.Bang!The fist slammed heavily into the pressure board. The special metal alloy pressure board jerked back obviously as the numbers on the screen rapidly lit up, eventually stopping at 11.\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d As he reeled from expending all his Primordial Energy, Tian Xiangdong secretly wiped sweat from his brow.His Strength was only a 7. And with a Rank 1 Lightning Fist, it could raise his Strength by about half. It wasn\u2019t extremely stable, allowing him to dish out 10 or 11 randomly. He had done pretty well today, allowing him to defeat Zhou Wen.\u201cThat\u2019s impressive.\u201d Zhou Wen was indeed a genius when it came to cultivation. However, he wasn\u2019t a sensitive person. He didn\u2019t notice Tian Xiangdong\u2019s emotional changes and was caught up with the notion that he couldn\u2019t join the team unless he defeated Tian Xiangdong. Therefore, he walked towards the Strength-measuring device again.However, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t immediately throw out his punch. Instead, he began studying the Strength-measuring device.\u201cWhat are you looking at? Just tell us if you can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not embarrassing losing to me.\u201d Realizing that Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t delivering the punch, Tian Xiangdong was imagining that Zhou Wen lacked the confidence and was hesitant about delivering the punch.Zhou Wen looked at the Strength-measuring device and asked worriedly, \u201cThe school won\u2019t ask me to pay for it if I break it, right?\u201dThe moment Tian Xiangdong heard Zhou Wen, he burst out in exasperated laughter. \u201cBro, nice bragging. This is a Strength-measuring device. It\u2019s specially made for Strength-measuring. Although it\u2019s only a low-end model meant for high schoolers with an upper limit of 20, few high schoolers can hit the limit, much less destroy it. Let\u2019s do this. If you really destroy it, I\u2019ll pay for the damages.\u201d\u201cMakes sense.\u201d Zhou Wen nodded. The device did seem rather solid, so it was unlikely it be damaged.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t hesitate further as he raised his fist. The skin on his fist gradually turned red with a metallic sheen. It looked like it was wrapped in a red metallic membrane.\u201cPrimordial Energy Skill\u2026 So Zhou Wen has already learned a Primordial Energy Skill\u2026\u201d Tian Xiangdong was instantly somewhat disappointed.Without a doubt, with Zhou Wen\u2019s Strength, the knowledge of a Primordial Energy Skill\u2014no matter how weak it was\u2014could dish out Strength that was far greater than Tian Xiangdong\u2019s. Therefore, the latter knew that his loss was a certainty.Fang Ruoxi and Li Zhi were somewhat surprised that Zhou Wen knew a Primordial Energy Skill. It enabled them to earn higher points at the combat test.Bang!Zhou Wen slammed his fist heavily into the pressure board and as though it was hit by a sledgehammer, it jerked back. The numbers on the screen kept lighting up, instantly surpassing 11.I wonder what his final score will be through the use of a Primordial Energy Skill, Fang Ruoxi thought, but she saw the numbers lighting up at a blisteringly fast rate. In a blink of an eye, all of the numbers were lit up as her expression changed.Boom!Before the spectators could have any thoughts, the Strength-measuring device produced a strange sound. At some spot, the back of the device cracked as pale yellow liquid spewed out like a fountain.Tian Xiangdong and company widened their mouths into an O shape as they stared blankly at Zhou Wen and the liquid-spewing Strength-measuring device. There was silence.Yu Qiubai\u2019s eyes widened as well, eager to rush forward to personally determine if the Strength-measuring device was really broken.He naturally wasn\u2019t wanting payment from Zhou Wen, but that he was filled with disbelief that a high schooler\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill could be this strong.Tian Xiangdong trembled. At the thought of the punch\u2019s might, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to imagine what would have happened if he had battled Zhou Wen in a Strength test.The upper limit of the Strength-measuring device was 20, but it didn\u2019t mean that it could only withstand Strength 20. In fact, to burst the hydraulic mechanism needed Strength that far exceeded 20.Even with Strength 10, Zhou Wen probably needed a Primordial Energy Skill at Rank 8 or 9 to deliver such damage.If he hadn\u2019t learned of Zhou Wen\u2019s background from the former principal, he would even have suspected that Zhou Wen had used high-level Primordial Energy Skill Crystals; otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to possess such Strength.However, with Zhou Wen\u2019s background, it seemed impossible for him to possess such high-level Primordial Energy Skill Crystals.If he had truly mastered a Primordial Energy Skill to such a level by himself, that\u2019s way too terrifying! Yu Qiubai couldn\u2019t help but recall the former principal\u2019s evaluation of Zhou Wen: \u201cThere are two geniuses in the world. One type of genius is called Zhou Wen, the other type are the other geniuses.\u201d\u201cYou said that you\u2019d be paying if it\u2019s damaged. You\u2019re a man of his word, right?\u201d Zhou Wen was taken aback as he looked at Tian Xiangdong.He hadn\u2019t expected Vigor Divine Fist to really be vigorous enough to destroy the Strength-measuring device.He was poor and really didn\u2019t have the money to compensate the school if it really pressed him for damages.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll pay for it. Bro, any problem that can be solved with money isn\u2019t a problem. We are old classmates and a team. Leave this to me,\u201d Tian Xiangdong said with a beaming smile as he came round.Tian Xiangdong came from a rich family and could easily afford it. However, a second teammate like Zhou Wen was probably impossible to find in a small city like Guide City.With Zhou Wen joining the team, Tian Xiangdong believed that perhaps they weren\u2019t only able to obtain first at the combat test in Guide City, but that they could even raise their targets.Li Zhi and Fang Ruoxi were in a good mood as well. Having a powerful teammate like Zhou Wen join the team brought them one step closer to their goals.This fellow is more interesting than I imagined. Fang Ruoxi narrowed her eyes as she looked at Zhou Wen.With Zhou Wen officially joining the team, the four submitted an application form for the combat test. Many of the teachers and heads in the school were rather surprised to see Zhou Wen\u2019s name on the list.The teachers of Fang Ruoxi, Li Zhi, and Tian Xiangdong had even spoken to them privately, openly and covertly trying to get them to select another teammate. They didn\u2019t want Zhou Wen to be a burden on them. However, the trio refused, adamant about having Zhou Wen in their team. It left their teachers vexed.Only Yu Qiubai drank his tea calmly. He knew very well that Zhou Wen was the strongest among the four.Just wait and see. After the test, we will know who\u2019s the burden. Yu Qiubai drank his tea as he thought.Zhou Wen was his student, so he was naturally displeased that the other teachers spoke ill of him behind Zhou Wen\u2019s back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen didn\u2019t think too much about it. The thoughts of others had nothing to do with him. All he wanted was to score well at the combat test during the college entrance exams. From that, he could enter a reputable school before focusing on gaming. After cruising through college and graduating, he could then get a job related to the dimensional zones.However, there was one thing that Zhou Wen took notice of. Fang Ruoxi\u2019s mention of his defeat under An Jing\u2019s hands had made him realize something was amiss. It was something he hadn\u2019t thought too deeply about previously.An Jing was about his age and was perhaps a little younger; yet, she was very likely already a Legendary stage expert. Although they were just separated by one stage, it was a night and day difference between the Mortal and Legendary stages. It was almost impossible for someone at the Mortal stage to defeat a Legendary stage expert.The clearest indicator of a Legendary stage expert was the opportunity to obtain a Companion Beast. And at the Mortal stage, it was very difficult to obtain Companion Beasts. Even if one did get a Companion Egg, they lacked the Primordial Energy to carry out the incubation.There were also many opaque differences. For example, after a human advanced to the Legendary stage, they would awaken their Legendary Life Providence, greatly augmenting their constitutions. It also widened the gap between Mortal stage and Legendary stage.Unless there was any reason that prompted action, the typical Legendary stage expert found it beneath them to attack people at the Mortal stage. For An Jing to challenge him, a student at the Mortal stage, and then transfer out of the school shortly after the challenge, it appeared as though she had specially come to beat him up.\u201cI\u2019ve never left Guide City all my life. How could I have offended someone like her? Could it be Dad\u2026\u201d As Zhou Wen thought about it, he came up with one possibility.Zhou Wen\u2019s mother had passed away during childbirth, causing him to be brought up in a single-parent family. As for his dad, he was an unreliable man.Zhou Wen\u2019s father was named Zhou Lingfeng. Like the word \u2018feng\u2019 symbolizing \u2018wind\u2019 in his name, he was like a gust of wind. From the age of five, Zhou Wen learned to be independent. He had to do simple cooking, laundry, and the management of household matters, as well as do groceries.And in the words of his unreliable dad, this was to nurture his survivability as a man. It would also be the foundation on which he would use to get a wife.Although his dad was very lazy, there was something that left Zhou Lingfeng slightly relieved. Zhou Lingfeng had never missed out on paying his living expenses.As a polyglot, Zhou Lingfeng did translation work. When Zhou Wen was young, his father often translated documents from home. However, with the improvement in technology, translation software became much better and Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s work reduced as a result.When Zhou Wen grew a little older, he became more independent, so Zhou Lingfeng took on interpretation work. He often went out of town for a week or even as long as a few months.The latest instance was more ridiculous. Zhou Wen hadn\u2019t seen his father in half a year. If it wasn\u2019t for his monthly living expenses being transferred into his account, he would have been worried his father had died.This was because Zhou Lingfeng often went to relatively remote places. The reception conditions there were often terrible, so it was common for him to be uncontactable. Zhou Wen was used to it.Even if he wasn\u2019t used to it, it wasn\u2019t as though he could do anything about it other than waiting for Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s return.Their home was made up of two men. Zhou Wen had no chance to offend a figure like An Jing, so he was highly suspicious that his dad had offended her. Failing to find him, all she could do was to vent her anger on his son.Zhou Wen had zero confidence in his dad. He was the kind of person that indulged in pleasures. He was also someone who often spent time at bars. He had often hit on chicks in the past, only to be beaten up by the woman\u2019s male partner.Luckily Zhou Wen was able to fend for himself. If not, he wondered if Zhou Lingfeng would even have had the ability to raise him.As he thought about it, his phone suddenly rang. With his mind wandering, Zhou Wen jumped. After taking out his ordinary phone, he realized it was from his father, Zhou Lingfeng.Speak of the devil. Zhou Wen hurriedly picked up the call. Just as he was about to say something, he heard Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s voice: \u201cSon, I\u2019m getting married. Will you be coming to my wedding?\u201dThankfully, Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t drinking any water; otherwise, he would have spewed it all out.\u201cYou\u2019re getting married? To who?\u201d Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t against Zhou Lingfeng getting married. After all, he had been single for so many years, so it was very normal for him to find a partner. Besides, he might become more reliable after his marriage, so it could be a blessing in disguise.\u201cI\u2019ll send Sweety\u2019s photo to you,\u201d Zhou Lingfeng said. Before Zhou Wen said a word, the phone hung up and a photo was sent.Zhou Wen glanced at the photo and saw Zhou Lingfeng with a young woman. The woman looked to be in her thirties at most. She was elegant and beautiful, and she had a rather good presence. She looked different from the so-called beauties on the Internet. This lady had a sensual aesthetic and a unique presence that could hardly be described with words.\u201cHow\u2019s it? Your new mom isn\u2019t too bad, right? Her name is Ouyang Lan,\u201d Zhou Lingfeng called again and said smugly.\u201cNot bad, but she\u2019s not my mom,\u201d Zhou Wen said.Although he didn\u2019t mind Zhou Lingfeng getting remarried, he didn\u2019t plan on acknowledging a new mother at his age. After all, Zhou Lingfeng wasn\u2019t home most of the time and he was already accustomed to living alone. It was also not necessary that the lady would like baggage like him, so it would be quite nice if they led their own separate lives.\u201cMy wife is naturally your mom. That\u2019s an undeniable fact. By the way, my wedding is in a few days. You have to come, alright?\u201d Zhou Lingfeng said indifferently, as though he took nothing to heart.\u201cWhere is it? When is it?\u201d Zhou Wen asked.\u201cLuoyang. In a week,\u201d Zhou Lingfeng said.\u201cI\u2019ll be taking the college entrance exams in a few days. The period you mentioned happens to clash with the combat test which I plan on participating in. I won\u2019t be able to go even if I wanted,\u201d Zhou Wen said helplessly.He was willing to participate in the wedding, but he really couldn\u2019t go.\u201cWow, time passes so quickly. You are already having your college entrance exams.\u201d Zhou Lingfeng clearly didn\u2019t remember this as he made a poignant comment.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t expect his father to know it, but he was still somewhat disappointed hearing him say that. Perhaps Zhou Lingfeng had even forgotten that he was graduating from high school this year.\u201cDad, do you know that metal biscuit tin inside our wardrobe?\u201d Zhou Wen suddenly asked.\u201cBiscuit tin? What biscuit tin?\u201d Zhou Lingfeng asked in puzzlement.\u201cThe one that\u2019s about thirty centimeters long. It\u2019s a biscuit tin that\u2019s squarish and made of metal. It has a picture of a cartoon bear\u2026\u201d Zhou Wen described the biscuit tin\u2019s characteristics in detail.\u201cOh, that bear biscuit tin. I often ate from it when I was little. However, that brand of biscuits isn\u2019t sold anymore. The one we have at home was probably left behind. Why are you asking about it?\u201d\u201cInside that bear biscuit tin is a cellphone. Did you put it in?\u201d Zhou Wen\u2019s heart raced slightly. That cellphone was the mysterious phone he was using.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cCellphone?\u201d Zhou Lingfeng was somewhat puzzled. Only after quite some time did he suddenly say, \u201cIs the phone you\u2019re talking about one with a completely white metal case and a black screen without any buttons. About five to six inches big?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Is that phone yours?\u201d Zhou Wen asked in surprise.\u201cNo, it\u2019s your grandfather\u2019s. I\u2019d have already forgotten about it if you hadn\u2019t mentioned it,\u201d Zhou Lingfeng said with a laugh. \u201cThat phone was your grandfather\u2019s baby.\u201d\u201cGrandfather\u2019s baby? Where he did get it from?\u201d Zhou Wen seemed to notice something amiss with Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s tone as he pressed on.Zhou Lingfeng recounted the phone\u2019s origins, leaving Zhou Wen quite surprised.Zhou Wen\u2019s grandfather was a carpenter years ago; however, he wasn\u2019t a carpenter who made tables or chairs. He could do those, but his focus was on building wooden buildings that mimicked ancient structures.In the past, when Guide Ancient City was being rebuilt, they needed to preserve the ancient city\u2019s former state, so the construction of many wooden buildings in the ancient style was needed. Zhou Wen\u2019s father had taken the job and spent more than a year in the City.During this period, an ancient dried well was excavated from the ancient city\u2019s site. It was the graveyard shift, so there weren\u2019t any outsiders around. Only Zhou Wen\u2019s grandfather and a few workers were present.When the ancient well was dug out, there was a glow that emitted from below. Imagining that they had dug out treasure, the workers came to an agreement and headed down to dig for it, hoping to strike it rich.After they went down the well, they discovered an ancient rotting wooden case. The case had almost disintegrated, and there were many holes in it. It was from these holes that the light shone out.The few workers brought the case up, imagining that there was some treasure in it. With just a few of them, they could split it and end up living in the lap of luxury for the rest of their lives.To their surprise, it was a cellphone. Although cellphones had just become widespread back then, it was no longer anything rare.Furthermore, the phone was still lit in the beginning. After they took it out, the screen went black as though it had lost power. There weren\u2019t any buttons on the phone, nor was there any charging port.Zhou Wen\u2019s grandfather and company were greatly disappointed, imagining that it was a prank. Since it looked broken without any value, everyone lost interest in it. Eventually, Zhou Wen\u2019s grandfather threw it into a tool bag.Later, it was brought back home. Zhou Wen\u2019s grandfather didn\u2019t throw it away and kept it in the storeroom. When Zhou Lingfeng was young, Zhou Wen\u2019s grandfather had even told him the story. However, it was recounted like a horror story; thus, leaving quite a deep impression on Zhou Lingfeng.\u201cThat crappy phone can\u2019t even be turned on. When I was young, I took it to a phone repair shop, hoping to sell it for a few packets of cigarettes, but the boss said it was worthless. So I just threw it into the biscuit tin. Don\u2019t tell me you plan on selling it for money? Cellphones have such a short lifespan and they aren\u2019t considered antiques. Old models aren\u2019t worth anything,\u201d Zhou Lingfeng said.Zhou Wen thought to himself, Thankfully, you didn\u2019t manage to swap the phone for cigarettes; otherwise, me crying would be an understatement.\u201cThe phone has never lit up before?\u201d Zhou Wen asked further.\u201cHow could it? It\u2019s been sitting there for years. Ignoring the fact that it\u2019s broken, even if it isn\u2019t, it would have long run out of charge.\u201d Zhou Lingfeng cut off Zhou Wen and said, \u201cAlright. I have many things to tend to over here. Since I\u2019ve already informed you, it\u2019s up to you to come to the wedding.\u201dWith that said, Zhou Lingfeng hung up.Something dug up from Guide Ancient City? Unfortunately, that place has already become a dimensional zone. Ordinary people have no way of going close. However, Guide City\u2019s combat test is inside Guide Ancient City. I wonder where that ancient well is or if I have a chance of heading over to take a look. Zhou Wen thought about it but was without any clues.Just as Zhou Lingfeng had said, phones were something that were made in the last few decades. It was impossible for them to be antiques. Even if they were antiques, they couldn\u2019t possess any mystical power.\u201cDamn it. I forgot to ask dad if he had offended anyone.\u201d Zhou Wen was planning on calling again, but after some thought, he decided against it.Since An Jing was gone and hadn\u2019t really done anything to him, there was no point in raising it now the matter was already over.Taking out the mysterious phone, he opened the Ant Nest app and once again started his grinding.The ants were killed by the blood-colored avatar as his in-game character behaved like him. Zhou Wen received all the experiences and lessons learned from combat.Now, Zhou Wen was getting more experienced at killing Vigor Ants. He lasted much longer and could now kill four to five hundred Vigor Ants with just one life. In the past, he would usually succumb after killing about a hundred.Unfortunately, his luck today was nothing to speak of. Two Strength Crystals and a Constitution Crystal dropped. Furthermore, they were low in value and could only be used for energy replenishment. He wasn\u2019t able to upgrade himself directly with them.As he was getting pumped from the killing, he suddenly saw a red Mutated Vigor Ant appear. Delighted, he controlled the blood-colored avatar to rush over.Before he had mastered Vigor Divine Fist, killing Mutated Vigor Ants was somewhat difficult, but this time, he delivered one Vigor Divine Fist immediately, blasting its head apart. Following that, he threw out another punch to blast its body apart.Ding!A crisp sound was heard as a dimensional crystal dropped. Unfortunately, there was only one.\u201cKilled Mutated Vigor Ant. Discovered Constitution Crystal.\u201dZhou Wen took a careful look and saw that it had a value of 9, delighting him.His Constitution was at 8, and with this Constitution Crystal, he could improve once again.Constitution involved a person\u2019s resilience and endurance. Only with high Constitution could someone fight prolonged battles without becoming exhausted. One would also be able to better withstand blows. The Ascetic Meditation he cultivated in mainly strengthened his Constitution and Strength.Picking up the Constitution Crystal with the blood-colored avatar, a strange force was transmitted from the phone, instantly spreading across Zhou Wen\u2019s body. It made every cell in him seem to come to life.As he watched his in-game Constitution change to 9, Zhou Wen felt his body become significantly tougher. When ordinary Vigor Ants bit at his blood-colored avatar, the amount of health he lost was much less.Zhou Wen continued grinding and discovered that such Mutant Vigor Ants occasionally appeared in the nest, but its spawning spot was random. Furthermore, they didn\u2019t always drop dimensional crystals.Later, Zhou Wen encountered two Mutated Vigor Ants again, but nothing dropped.Time quickly passed amidst his grinding. Nothing changed. He slept through his classes and gamed after classes. Only during cultivation classes did he hone his teamwork with Fang Ruoxi and company.However, over the past few days, Zhou Wen often felt that Yu Qiubai looked at him strangely. The latter was often smiling at him with narrowed eyes, creeping him out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTian Xiangdong was training his fist techniques on the field, but from time to time, he would sneak a glance at Zhou Wen who was under a tree. He had been training for nearly an hour while Zhou Wen had spent the same amount of time gaming on the phone.\u201cIt\u2019s really exasperating to compare. We spend so much effort training, but that fellow just games.\u201d Tian Xiangdong felt more depressed the more he looked.After the past few days of training, Tian Xiangdong had learned something. The reason Zhou Wen was considered the best genius in Guide High School wasn\u2019t solely because of his cultivation talent.Tian Xiangdong had originally thought that cultivation akin to sailing against a current was suitable for all humans since humans weren\u2019t machines. It was very easy to regress if one didn\u2019t train daily.It was especially so when putting theory into practice in actual combat. Some level of deviation would affect the timing of opportunities and distance placement.But Zhou Wen was different. As long as he learned something, regardless of whether he trained or not, he appeared very skilled and natural when actually putting it to practice.Over the past few days, Zhou Wen would join them when the quartet trained together. But when it was time for individual training, Zhou Wen would run to the side to game.If it wasn\u2019t because Zhou Wen\u2019s performance was impeccable when cooperating with the rest and, in fact, was the most outstanding one among the four, Tian Xiangdong might have taken on a teacher\u2019s responsibility to teach the former a good lesson, inculcating in him the importance of daily practice and improvement.But now, all Tian Xiangdong could do was sneak glances at Zhou Wen sitting there gaming while he had to engage in strenuous training.\u201cWhere are you looking at? Focus. Your actions aren\u2019t right,\u201d Li Zhi said as he walked over.Tian Xiangdong glanced at Zhou Wen who was just gaming and said in envy, \u201cHow nice it would be if I had talent like Zhou Wen. Cultivation is so miserable. Who doesn\u2019t want to just game daily?\u201dLi Zhi said with a laugh, \u201cDo you think Zhou Wen is really just gaming all day?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that so? He has so much fun gaming daily. It\u2019s obvious for us all to see,\u201d Tian Xiangdong said.Li Zhi shook his head and said, \u201cWe can only see him when he\u2019s in school. We have no idea what he does after school.\u201d\u201cAre you telling me that he\u2019s cultivating hard at home after school?\u201d Tian Xiangdong understood what Li Zhi was getting at.\u201cThere\u2019s no free lunch in the world. A person like Zhou Wen might appear harmless as though he cares about nothing, but deep down in his bones, he\u2019s extremely prideful. He suffered such a terrible defeat under An Jing\u2019s hands, and although there might be extenuating circumstances for his defeat, with his character, he probably couldn\u2019t accept it. He must have worked very hard at cultivation. This can be seen from how adept he is in actual combat. He\u2019s definitely just putting on a farce that he\u2019s decadent and engrossed in gaming,\u201d Li Zhi said with a severe countenance.\u201cThen why does he act so decadent in school? There\u2019s no need for him to do so. Isn\u2019t it better to spend time gaming than on cultivation?\u201d Tian Xiangdong was doubtful.Li Zhi shot a glance at Zhou Wen and said, \u201cI believe that he suffered quite a psychological setback when he was first defeated by An Jing, causing people to mistake him for wallowing in self-misery.\u201d\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t explain why he games in school?\u201d Tian Xiangdong was still puzzled.\u201cThink about it. If everyone believes you to be trash, and you end up scoring shockingly well on the college-entrance exams, taking first place in the city, wouldn\u2019t it feel awesome to look back at the naysayers with a beaming look of success?\u201d Li Zhi said.\u201cHoly sh*t, Zhou Wen has such nefarious thoughts? That scumbag\u2026\u201d Tian Xiangdong instantly came to a realization as he nearly exclaimed. Thankfully, Li Zhi cupped his mouth in time.Zhou Wen obviously wasn\u2019t as Tian Xiangdong imagined. Gaming similarly allowed him to grow stronger. Furthermore, the in-game character was equivalent to another him. When the in-game character was in combat, he would acquire the experience and skill familiarity from combat; therefore, he had no need to train.\u201cMutated Vigor Ant!\u201d Zhou Wen was grinding happily when he saw a blood-red Vigor Ant appear.Over the past few days, he had killed more than ten Mutated Vigor Ants, but the outcome wasn\u2019t anything desirable.Apart from the first Mutated Vigor Ant dropping two dimensional crystals, the subsequent ones dropped dimensional crystals at a much lower rate. Their qualities were also worse.Ignoring the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal, even dimensional crystals with a value of 9 were rare. They didn\u2019t appear even after about ten Mutated Vigor Ants were killed.Now, Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t as excited as before when he saw Mutated Vigor Ants. He very calmly controlled the blood-colored avatar to proceed forward and deliver two Vigor Divine Fist strikes to kill it.Ding!He heard a familiar chime. Something had dropped this time.Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t too excited. Even if a dimensional crystal dropped, it was useless even if it was valued at 7 or 8, unless they were Speed Crystals. They could only replenish his energy expenditure.However, when Zhou Wen identified the item that dropped, he was slightly taken aback. It was because the word \u201cCrystal\u201d wasn\u2019t in the name of the item.\u201cKilled Mutated Vigor Ant. Discovered Companion Egg.\u201dA game notice popped up at the bottom left of the screen. It left Zhou Wen surprised and delighted.Having a Companion Egg drop meant that he had a chance of possessing a Companion Beast. But based on what he knew, it was very rare for Companion Beasts to appear at the Mortal stage. One could usually only have one after reaching the Legendary stage.It could be said that Companion Beasts were a manifestation of one\u2019s strength and status. Humans that would take their Companion Beasts on the streets were basically experts at the Legendary stage or higher. They were respected and envied by others.The reason people at the Mortal stage lacked Companion Beasts was that Mortal stage dimensional creatures almost never dropped Companion Beasts. Even Legendary stage dimensional creatures had a relatively low probability of dropping one. Furthermore, Legendary stage Companion Eggs required one to provide Legendary stage Primordial Energy to incubate it. Therefore, even if Mortal stage humans obtained a Companion Egg, they had no means to incubate it.Companion Beasts that hatched after incubation would live and die with their masters. It was very difficult for them to be transferred. If a forceful transfer was made, an extremely huge price needed to be paid. The typical person had no way of achieving that.In a tiny city like Guide City, Zhou Wen had never seen a human at the Mortal stage have a Companion Beast.The Companion Egg was about the size of the fist of the blood-colored avatar. It was completely milky-white and translucent. It was oval in shape and inside some red lights were flickering. It looked mysterious and beautiful.Zhou Wen eagerly made the blood-colored avatar pick up the Companion Egg. The moment it made contact, Zhou Wen felt a jolt through his body. As though extracted by a needle, his Primordial Energy instantly flowed towards the phone.And in-game, the blood-colored avatar\u2019s Primordial Energy instantly went from 9 to 0.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen felt exhausted as though he had been sucked dry. The color in his face instantly drained as beads of sweat oozed out of his forehead.In-game, the Companion Egg\u2019s red stream of light brightened after it absorbed the Primordial Energy, dyeing the entire Companion Egg red, making it look like a blood crystal.Crack!It cracked open and a blood-colored Vigor Ant\u2019s light projection flashed and entered the blood-colored avatar\u2019s body.At this moment, Zhou Wen felt an odd force surge into his body. It was as though the force had a life of its own. Although it was indescribable, it was transmitting information to Zhou Wen in a magical manner.\u201cPledge my life to follow you\u2026 Pledge my life to follow you\u2026 Pledge my life to follow you\u2026\u201dAs the voices sounded in Zhou Wen\u2019s mind, the force in him gathered towards the back of his left hand. Slowly it formed a blood-colored ant symbol like a tattoo made from blood.Zhou Wen subconsciously pulled his sleeves down and shrank his left hand in to prevent others from seeing the ant symbol on the back of it.Companion Beasts had an extremely mystical existence. They were like parasites that live on humans, living and dying with their masters.Zhou Wen took a look at the in-game information. Indeed, there was an additional entry of Mutated Vigor Ant at Companion Beast. Then, he took another look at the Mutated Vigor Ant\u2019s stats.Mutated Vigor Ant: MortalStrength: 9Speed: 5Constitution: 9Primordial Energy: 9Talent Skill: Vigor Divine Fist (Rank 9)Companion Form: Boxing Glove\u2014Zhou Wen was delighted seeing this. A Mutated Vigor Ant\u2019s stats could match a top Mortal stage human and it had a Rank 9 Vigor Divine Fist. If he summoned it out, it was equivalent to having another hatchet man as strong as him. It could even be more ferocious than Zhou Wen since his Vigor Divine Fist was Rank 7 while it was at Rank 9.Zhou Wen was eager to immediately summon the Mutated Vigor Ant to see what it looked like in real life, since all he saw in-game was a Mutated Vigor Ant drawn in a cartoon style. He had no idea what it really looked like.However, with him being in school, Zhou Wen could only resist his desire.A Mortal stage Companion Beast would probably attract plenty of attention if he summoned it in school. Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t have any good explanation for the Mutated Vigor Ant\u2019s origins.Tian Xiangdong couldn\u2019t help but sneakily size up Zhou Wen. Upon seeing him, he said in a depressed tone, \u201cLook at Zhou Wen. He\u2019s gaming until he\u2019s pale and breaking out into a cold sweat. He looks so frail. If I hadn\u2019t seen his Strength and Primordial Energy Skill with my own eyes, I would really think that he was a sickly fellow.\u201dLittle did he know that the reason for Zhou Wen\u2019s sickly look was because he had been using his blood to revive himself in-game over the past month. Although one drop of blood each time wasn\u2019t a lot, the numerous times he did so still caused him to lose a shocking amount of blood. This made Zhou Wen look somewhat pale and weak as though he was malnourished or suffering from anemia.This was also one of the reasons why Yu Qiubai and the others believed that he was being decadent. That pale face was like a perfect example of someone wallowing in self-misery.After returning home from school, Zhou Wen drew the curtains. Only then did he summon the Mutated Vigor Ant in his living room.The symbol on the back of his hand burst out in a resplendent sanguine light. The symbol\u2019s blood color seemed to come to life as it turned into a stream of blood that flowed over his palm and soon enveloped it within, turning it into a boxing glove that was neither gold or jade. On the back of the boxing glove was the symbol of a Vigor Ant.Zhou Wen looked at the boxing glove on his left hand. He felt an explosive force fill his left fist as though he could blast apart a tank if he threw it out.Indeed, it\u2019s just like the livestreams on the Internet. Companion Beasts provide an augmentation effect in a companion state. A Vigor Ant augments Strength, right? Unable to test the augmented effects of the boxing glove at home, Zhou Wen could only put it away and switch to summoning the Mutated Vigor Ant.As the Mutated Vigor Ant symbol on the back of his hand shimmered, a strange blood-colored projection appeared in front of him. The projection gradually materialized, turning into a blood-colored ant the size of a racehorse.A Mutated Vigor Ant in real life was in no way as adorable as the cartoon version in-game. Its blood-red carapace appeared to be cast from metal. Its physical contours seemed to contain infinite explosive strength. Its long, slender ant legs were like saws. The feelers on its head looked like resilient steel pieces.Ignoring being pierced by its leg, just being slammed by its body would probably result in fractures and debilitation.It left a strong impact on him when he observed it up close. It had a dangerous beauty that looked somewhat demonic. While it left one shuddering in fear, it also prompted one to subdue it.The game\u2019s depiction really can\u2019t be counted on. Such a ferocious killing machine actually looks so cute in-game. Zhou Wen swung himself onto the back of the Mutated Vigor Ant and made it circle the living room.Unfortunately, the living room was too small, making it difficult for the Mutated Vigor Ant to turn around. He didn\u2019t experience much of a thrill as a result.I\u2019ll try riding you out when I next have a chance. Unless necessary, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t plan on letting others know of the existence of the Mutated Vigor Ant.Although Mortal stage Companion Beasts were rare, they were much weaker than Legendary stage Companion Beasts. It was pointless showing it off.However, the dropping of the Companion Egg made Zhou Wen more diligent. He continued striving hard with the phone, hoping to see what other drops he could get from the Ant Nest.With the college entrance exams approaching, Zhou Wen went into school earlier, hoping to sleep in class. The moment he reached the school\u2019s entrance, he saw Tian Xiangdong standing there with an odd expression.Seeing Zhou Wen walk over, Tian Xiangdong hurriedly came forward, wearing an odd look on his face. He gritted his teeth and said, \u201cZhou Wen, I\u2019m sorry. My friend invited me to join his team. I can\u2019t be in the same team as you.\u201dWith that said, Tian Xiangdong didn\u2019t wait for him to say another word before running off.Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback, unsure what was wrong with the fellow. The test was about to begin, yet here he was switching teams.I wonder if Fang Ruoxi has any backup plans for Tian Xiangdong quitting the team. It\u2019s not easy to find another teammate this late. Zhou Wen walked into the school as he thought about the matter only to find Li Zhi standing in front of him.\u201cLi Zhi, do you know about Tian Xiangdong quitting the team?\u201d Zhou Wen asked.Li Zhi was taken aback before he looked at him with an odd expression. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. For some reason, I can\u2019t take the combat test with you either.\u201dZhou Wen looked at Li Zhi and felt an ominous feeling rise in him.\u201cWhy?\u201d Zhou Wen looked at Li Zhi and asked.\u201cDon\u2019t ask. It\u2019s my bad.\u201d Li Zhi wore a look of guilt and bowed before quickly walking away.When Zhou Wen saw Fang Ruoxi, he could tell from the look on her face what she was about to say.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zhou Wen. I can\u2019t take the combat test with you.\u201d Fang Ruoxi came in front of him and remained silent for a long while before speaking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhy?\u201d Zhou Wen stared into Fang Ruoxi\u2019s eyes and asked.Fang Ruoxi\u2019s gaze dodged his, unwilling for their eyes to meet. She shook her head slightly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t ask. In short, it\u2019s my fault.\u201dZhou Wen smiled and reached out to press onto Fang Ruoxi\u2019s head. He ruffled her hair and said, \u201cI should be the one apologizing. Someone is out to get me; thus putting you, Tian Xiangdong, and Li Zhi in a difficult position. Now that there\u2019s still time, get another teammate. Make sure to do well, or I\u2019ll feel uneasy. Also, help me apologize to Tian Xiangdong and Li Zhi.\u201dFang Ruoxi stared at Zhou Wen blankly. Her face wore a complicated expression. It was a lost, guilty, confused look with a hint of abnormality.\u201cAlright, move along. I need to work hard as well.\u201d Zhou Wen retracted his palm as he left with a smile.Fang Ruoxi stood there watching his back and after he had walked quite a distance away, she said with her body trembling, \u201cZhou Wen, I\u2019ve no idea who you offended, but that person wields great power. You have to be careful.\u201dZhou Wen didn\u2019t say a word. All he did was turn his head and smile at her before briskly walking away.Zhou Wen knew that he didn\u2019t have much time left. Li Zhi\u2019s family was ordinary, but Tian Xiangdong belonged to one of the most powerful families in Guide City. Furthermore, Fang Ruoxi\u2019s family was even better. Rumor had it that her father was a high official in the city and someone with plenty of power.Someone who had the ability to influence; all three must wield extraordinary power.Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t figure out who he could have offended, but connecting it to An Jing\u2019s transferring to fight him had clues left behind.Coming to a spot devoid of anyone else, Zhou Wen took out his phone, thinking of asking his father if he had offended anyone.However, there was only the voice message that the phone was not in service. He didn\u2019t know what Zhou Lingfeng was up to for him to not even switch on his phone in the day.After hanging up, Zhou Wen contemplated his subsequent plans.The most important goal now is to find three students who are willing to join me in the combat test. Zhou Wen frowned in thought.The combat test was different from the other subjects in the college entrance exam. As it was held in the dimensional zone and although humans had already obtained control over the dimensional zones, reducing the dangers involved, there were still a number of casualties from the yearly test. Therefore, the combat test needed to be voluntary and the team formed freely.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t know what method of testing the League government would choose for the test. Every year, the result of casualties would result in a massive debate, but the combat test still continued every year. There weren\u2019t any signs of the League changing the situation.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t mind danger. With his present strength, even if he were to join the combat test alone, he was still bound to receive stellar results.However, it was a rule by the League government. It required four students from the same school to participate. Therefore, before the application deadline, he needed to find three students who were willing to form a team with him.I\u2019m still a few days away from the college entrance exam. The students who are willing to take the combat test probably already have their own teams. How am I to find people to form a team? Zhou Wen was rather vexed.In the beginning, all he wanted was to apply to a reputable school and find a stable job. Then, he could game in peace, but someone didn\u2019t seem willing to give him his peace. They were bent on messing things up.\u201cZhou Wen, follow me.\u201d Just as Zhou Wen reached the classroom, Yu Qiubai called out to him.He had a nasty expression as he took Zhou Wen back to his office. After closing the door, he looked at him and with a grave expression, asked, \u201cZhou Wen, do you know Overseer An?\u201d\u201cWho is he?\u201d Zhou Wen asked blankly.\u201cOverseer An is an honorific title that also includes his rank. His real name is An Tianzuo. Do you really not know him?\u201d Yu Qiubai asked Zhou Wen again with glaring eyes.\u201cNo.\u201d Zhou Wen shook his head firmly.Noticing that Zhou Wen didn\u2019t seem to be hiding anything, Yu Qiubai revealed a look of puzzlement. \u201cThat\u2019s strange. If you do not know Overseer An, why did he criticize a high schooler like you when he came to inspect Guide City?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of background does An Tianzuo have?\u201d Zhou Wen got a rough idea about the reason Fang Rouxi and the rest had quit the team. It was likely to do with An Tianzuo.Yu Qiubai wore a bitter smile. \u201cI\u2019m only a teacher. I have no chance of coming close to a figure like that. I\u2019ve only heard the principal mention a person like that. Earth\u2019s League is split into four districts\u2014north, south, east, and west, and Guide City is just a tiny city in East District. Although Overseer An Tianzuo is young, he comes from an illustrious family. In his twenties, he enjoys a high rank and is a high official in the East District\u2019s military. He wields plenty of power and is an impressive figure.\u201d\u201cSir, are you implying that An Tianzuo is targeting me?\u201d Zhou Wen asked with a frown.\u201cPerhaps not, but he said one sentence criticizing you. However, the people who were trying to be cozy with him are free to think and do many things,\u201d Yu Qiubai said helplessly.\u201cAs a high official, doesn\u2019t he know that a mere sentence is enough to destroy the future of a high schooler?\u201d Zhou Wen said coldly. \u201cCould this Overseer An be related to An Jing?\u201d\u201cFrom the looks of it, probably. As for what the exact relationship is, I\u2019ve no idea either.\u201d Yu Qiubai thought for a moment and said, \u201cWe can figure this out later. It\u2019s imperative we find you a team to participate in the combat test. The day after tomorrow is the deadline. We don\u2019t have time to spare.\u201dZhou Wen said helplessly, \u201cAt this point in time, the students who are willing to take the combat test already have their teams. How am I to find others? Besides, even if I found one, can\u2019t the dismantling of my team happen a second time?\u201d\u201cTherefore, the teammates you will be finding this time must not be ordinary students.\u201d Yu Qiubai appeared to already have a plan.\u201cNot ordinary students?\u201d Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback, confused as to what Yu Qiubai was getting at.Yu Qiubai pondered for a moment and said, \u201cThe combat test requires four students to freely form a team. This rule has a huge loophole, but the League has insisted on keeping it without changing it for decades. Under such rules, many students who aren\u2019t too strong but have extremely powerful teammates have obtained results that don\u2019t match their ability.\u201dAfter a pause, Yu Qiubai continued, \u201cOur school has a student named Li Xuan. If you are willing to form a team with him, and as long as he\u2019s willing, I doubt anyone will make it difficult for you. However, you have to ensure that he receives good results in exchange. Furthermore, he needs to be the one doing the best on the team.\u201d\u201cAre you telling me I\u2019ll be carrying Li Xuan?\u201d Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t a fool, so he naturally understood what Yu Qiubai was getting at.\u201cUnder normal circumstances, you naturally wouldn\u2019t have to do so. But in the present circumstances, although you won\u2019t get first in the team, you will still receive quite remarkable results. You just won\u2019t be first. This will be much better than not being able to participate at all.\u201dZhou Wen wasn\u2019t a stubborn person. Without any hesitation, he said, \u201cSir, I\u2019ll be troubling you to help me then. However, does our school really have a student named Li Xuan?\u201dIf Guide High School really had a student with such a striking background, there was no reason for him not to know.\u201cAlthough Li Xuan is a student at our school, he has never come to school except on matriculation day. It\u2019s normal that you don\u2019t know him. Even amongst the teachers, few of them know of him,\u201d Yu Qiubai said with a smile. \u201cIn short, let\u2019s get over this obstacle first. You can leave any considerations to the future.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter leaving Yu Qiubai\u2019s office, Zhou Wen took out his phone and tried to call his dad, Zhou Lingfeng. No matter how he thought about it, it was impossible for him to offend a figure like An Tianzuo.For An Tianzuo to know him, a high schooler from a tiny city, and then criticize him by name was truly inexplicable.This time, the phone call connected as Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s voice sounded. \u201cSon, missing daddy so soon?\u201dZhou Wen was already used to Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s character. Unmoved, he directly asked, \u201cDad, do you know a person named An Tianzuo?\u201d\u201cTianzuo? Of course.\u201d Upon saying that, Zhou Lingfeng exclaimed in surprise. \u201cHey, how do you know that Tianzuo is your elder brother? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve introduced the two of you.\u201d\u201cMy elder brother?\u201d Zhou Wen was left somewhat stunned.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Tianzuo is Little Lan\u2019s son. I married Little Lan, so he\u2019s naturally your stepbrother. By the way, you also have a stepsister named An Jing\u2026\u201d He had slipped effortlessly into addressing his fianc\u00e9e by an affectionate diminutive.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t manage to hear the rest of what Zhou Lingfeng had to say. It was because he was so shocked. The development had exceeded his imagination. Zhou Lingfeng had actually married such a woman.\u201cDad, how\u2019s your relationship with An Tianzuo?\u201d Zhou Wen tried probing.\u201cGreat. Tianzuo and Little Jing honor me greatly. We have a very good relationship,\u201d Zhou Lingfeng answered without much thought.Zhou Wen understood his father\u2019s character. It was unlikely that he was lying. However, he couldn\u2019t help but feel bitter deep down. If An Tianzuo and An Jing really have a good relationship with Zhou Lingfeng, why would they be treating me this way? Could it be that they aren\u2019t agreeable to dad\u2019s marriage with Ouyang Lan?\u201dZhou Wen could sense Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s good mood and how happy he was about his impending wedding. He didn\u2019t wish to affect Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s wedding because of his matters, much less be a burden on him.If An Tianzuo and An Jing had treated him that way because they didn\u2019t want Zhou Lingfeng to marry Ouyang Lan, he didn\u2019t want his problems to affect Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s wedding. Otherwise, he would fall into their plans.Although he hadn\u2019t met An Tianzuo before, nor did he know what motives An Tianzuo had, Zhou Wen had a terrible impression of him.Regardless of how powerful the An family is, it has nothing to do with me. I have no plans on benefiting myself through the An family. This family is really going too far. Although Zhou Wen now knew the underlying reasons, it was meaningless.It wasn\u2019t as if he could tell others that An Tianzu was pissed off because his dad had hit on her mom, thus also making him a sore sight to An Tianzuo, right?Not only couldn\u2019t he say it, but even if he said it out loud, it wasn\u2019t going to change the situation he was in.An Jing was able to defeat me with one strike. An Tianzuo\u2019s one sentence nearly made me lose the qualification to take the combat test. At the end of the day, it\u2019s because I\u2019m too weak. I can only be bullied when I lack strength. If I were an Epic stage expert, would they dare do this to me? Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t someone to bemoan his fate. He quickly put the matter aside and focused on grinding on the mysterious phone.Guide High School\u2019s former principal once commended Zhou Wen for being the most focused person he had ever met.Focused sounded like a very ordinary commendation, but to truly be focused was an insurmountable feat.Humans weren\u2019t saints. They had all kinds of desires and emotions that made them prone to enticement and disturbance. Even gods were no exception. Buddha suffered the temptation of Mara the demon, so what chance did mere mortals have?Many people claim studying to be difficult, but that was because they were unable to fully focus on their studies, nor did they have the ability to maintain that focused state.However, Zhou Wen was different. No matter what he did or no matter what the environment was, it was very easy for him to enter a focused state as he put a hundred percent into it. It was very difficult for him to be influenced by external factors; thus, the reason the former principal had made such a remark about Zhou Wen.In-game, Zhou Wen summoned his Companion Beast, the Mutated Vigor Ant. Although it also had 9 for Constitution, this fellow\u2019s carapace was hard and its defense was much stronger than Zhou Wen.The blood-colored avatar rode on the Mutated Vigor Ant, storming through the Ant Nest. Even a horde of Vigor Ants besieging him was no longer a worry.When the Mutated Vigor Ant struck with its front pincers, it killed ordinary Vigor Ants with one strike. With its hard carapace, it remained invincible amongst the hordes.\u201cIf only I had a spear.\u201d Zhou Wen discovered that by riding on the Mutated Vigor Ant\u2019s back, the blood-colored avatar could hardly hit the Vigor Ants around it due to the distance. It had to jump off the Mutated Vigor Ant\u2019s back and fight alongside it.Ever since he had obtained the mysterious crystal, Zhou Wen had never had such a good time grinding. The man and ant basically wiped out everything in their path as they stormed through the map. Whenever they met Mutated Vigor Ants, they could quickly kill them with their combined forces.In the past, Zhou Wen was only able to grind in the opening area, dying before he could reach deeper. Now, he was able to storm all the way in, quickly allowing him to enter areas he had never entered before.With so many Vigor Ants killed, two dimensional crystals dropped, but they were of very low values. Zhou Wen only replenished some of his energy after absorbing them.Ding!After killing another Mutated Vigor Ant, Zhou Wen heard a familiar sound. On careful look, he was delighted. This time, it was a dimensional crystal\u2014a Vigor Ant Crystal at Rank 9.Zhou Wen got the blood-colored avatar to pick it up, instantly feeling a jolt of electricity surge into his body as it blasted through his circulation.His Vigor Divine Fist instantly rose from Rank 7 to Rank 9.His Vigor Divine Fist might raise once again at Rank 9. However, the amount of Primordial Energy drained increased as well. Each usage expended 5 Primordial Energy. With only 9 Primordial Energy points, he was unable to use Vigor Divine Fist twice in short periods of time.With this new addition, Zhou Wen lost himself to grinding. The man and ant slaughtered through the Ant Nest, leaving a wake of destruction as they forged deep into the nest.The Ant Nest was like a huge underground maze. After nearly two hours of killing, he finally saw its end. The cave ahead seemed to become broader as the passageway became wide as though he was entering a large warehouse.As he was storming through the horde of ants, he suddenly saw a silver glimmer of light. All Zhou Wen saw was a strange ant with silver wings sweep above the blood-colored avatar, and the next second, the latter\u2019s head flew into midair. The game screen then went black.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhou Wen thought.He had planned on reviving the blood-colored avatar and heading for the area where the silver flying ant had appeared, but with noon almost approaching, Zhou Wen could only put it on hold.Although Yu Qiubai had tacitly allowed him to skip classes, he had arranged for Zhou Wen and Li Xuan to meet at noon. Therefore, Zhou Wen needed to make the trip.Zhou Wen originally imagined that they would meet in school, but to his surprise, Yu Qiubai drove Zhou Wen out of school after morning classes and arrived at a private club east of the city.\u201cLi Xuan is quite someone with an ostentatious character, but he\u2019s not a bad person. You are only here for the test, so don\u2019t take anything else to heart.\u201d Before entering the club, Yu Qiubai exhorted Zhou Wen with deep underlying tones.\u201cSir, don\u2019t worry. I know what I should do,\u201d Zhou Wen said with a nod.Although Zhou Wen was already mentally prepared, he was still somewhat surprised when he saw Li Xuan inside a luxurious private room.A teenager who looked about sixteen was sitting on a huge sofa. His shirt was untidy and frivolous and around him were beauties.\u201cLao Yu, come and have a drink,\u201d the teenager raised his glass of alcohol when he saw Yu Qiubai, slipping effortlessly into addressing him by an affectionate diminutive.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. I still have classes this afternoon.\u201d Yu Qiubai seemed accustomed to this. As though not noticing the sexy ladies, he pointed to Zhou Wen and introduced, \u201cLi Xuan, this is the Zhou Wen I mentioned before. He\u2019s very capable and should be of some help for your test.\u201d\u201cLao Yu, don\u2019t worry. On your account, I\u2019ll let him join me. Getting a pretty good result won\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Li Xuan downed his alcohol and said indifferently.\u201cHearing you say that puts me at ease. I still have lessons so I\u2019ll be heading back to school. Have a discussion with Zhou Wen about the combat test,\u201d Yu Qiubai said.\u201cLao Yu, are you really not going to have any drinks? The alcohol and women here are really good.\u201d Li Xuan said with a chuckle.\u201cThanks for the offer. I still have classes, so I\u2019ll be heading back.\u201d Yu Qiubai waved his hand and said to Zhou Wen, \u201cLeave the application to me. Stay here for the next few days to familiarize yourself with Li Xuan and the rest. It will be good for you during the combat test.\u201d\u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d Zhou Wen was rather moved.Yu Qiubai had no ties with him; yet, he was helping him at the risk of offending An Tianzuo. It left him feeling very grateful.\u201cBy getting into a reputable school and having a decent future is a way to not let me and the former principal down.\u201d Yu Qiubai patted Zhou Wen on the shoulder and said with a smile, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be heading back. Have a good discussion with Li Xuan about the details.\u201dAfter Yu Qiubai left, Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan who was reveling amidst the embraces of the beauties. He asked, \u201cDo we get the other two teammates here and do some teamwork training before the test begins?\u201dLi Xuan narrowed his eyes and said to Zhou Wen, \u201cZhou Wen, right? I\u2019ve heard of you, the number one genius in Guide High School.\u201d\u201cJust some random rumors. Don\u2019t treat it seriously,\u201d Zhou Wen said.\u201cThat\u2019s right. In a small city like Guide City, how can there be a real genius? If you were really a genius, you wouldn\u2019t have been defeated by An Jing\u2019s single strike,\u201d Li Xuan said languidly. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for any teamwork practice. I\u2019m allowing you to join my team solely because of Lao Yu. When the time comes, make sure you follow obediently behind us and not give us trouble.\u201d\u201cThat works,\u201d Zhou Wen said, unfazed.\u201cDo you drink? If you can finish this bottle, I\u2019ll let you choose from them.\u201d Li Xuan placed a bottle of alcohol in front of Zhou Wen.\u201cI don\u2019t drink.\u201d Zhou Wen shook his head.\u201cUp to you.\u201d Li Xuan found Zhou Wen boring and ignored him as he began having fun himself.Zhou Wen found a corner to sit down and began gaming on his phone, continuing his grinding fest.He wasn\u2019t interested in staying here, but since Yu Qiubai had requested he stay behind, he didn\u2019t think it was right to leave. Therefore, he just stayed behind to game.Seeing Zhou Wen sitting motionless in the corner gaming, Li Xuan had a feeling of contempt for him. To wallow in self-misery just because of a little setback. For this good-for-nothing, Lao Yu had to beg me. It wasn\u2019t worth it.Suddenly, Li Xuan\u2019s heart stirred. He whispered to a sexy girl beside him.\u201cYou\u2019re naughty.\u201d The girl jokingly snapped back as she walked towards Zhou Wen with her hips swaying.Zhou Wen was busy grinding, eager to rush back to where the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was. He wanted to know what level the dimensional creature was.Just as he was getting into it, he suddenly felt a softness touching his arm. Then, a sweet voice rang in his ear. \u201cHey Handsome, what\u2019s this game? Is it fun?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhou Wen continued grinding without looking up. After all, even if they saw the game, the cartoon-styled ants and the interface made it difficult for one to connect it to the dangerous dimensional zones.Besides, Zhou Wen had never heard of a dimensional zone that was an ant nest.When the girl saw Zhou Wen ignoring her, she subconsciously bit her lip. Then, she reached out to caress his cheek. She slightly used some force as she turned Zhou Wen\u2019s head towards her as she leaned into his ear and breathed out. \u201cWhat\u2019s so fun about the game? Why not play a game with me?\u201dAs Li Xuan drank, he watched Zhou Wen\u2019s reaction with piqued interest. He thought to himself, Zhou Wen is such a gaming addict. He probably has never touched a woman\u2019s body, much less a woman as coquettish as Xiaoya. Will he end up with a nose bleed as a result?Xiaoya had only thought of turning Zhou Wen\u2019s face slightly. Under such situations, men would automatically look at her, but despite doing so, Zhou Wen\u2019s face was unmovable, like a rock. His eyes were still peeled to the phone screen.A little peeved, Xiaoya exerted some strength, and forcibly turned Zhou Wen\u2019s head. As she used too much strength, Zhou Wen\u2019s cheeks were a little deformed from the squishing.Zhou Wen was grinding and was unwilling to be unfocused. The blood-colored avatar was amidst a horde of Vigor Ants, so any moment of distraction led to possible death\u2014the loss of one drop of blood.Over the past month, Zhou Wen had been using his blood to game. With so much blood being expended, he was beginning to suffer from anemia; therefore, he didn\u2019t even wish to lose one drop.Although Zhou Wen was facing her because of her twisting, Xiaoya realized that his eyes were still diagonally peeled to his phone screen. Enraged, she reached out her other hand and held his face with both hands. She turned his head even more, making Zhou Wen have no choice but to look at her. Then, she revealed a mesmerizing smile and said sweetly, \u201cStop gaming. Let\u2019s have some drinks, alright?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Zhou Wen\u2019s gaze was forced away from the phone screen, he immediately frowned.He had just seen a Mutated Vigor Ant rush over and if he didn\u2019t control his blood-colored avatar to take on the battle, it could easily lead to a \u201cGAME OVER.\u201dWithout having the luxury of time to think, Zhou Wen only wished to shift his gaze back to his phone. He instantly extended his hand and pressed it against Xiaoya\u2019s face. With a slight nudge, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t disturb my gaming.\u201dZhou Wen didn\u2019t use much of his strength, but he had forgotten how substantially his Strength had increased recently. Xiaoya hadn\u2019t cultivated at all, so her physical constitution was inferior to even the typical high schooler.This casual push ended up pushing Xiaoya entirely backward as she plopped to the ground.\u201cPfft!\u201d Upon seeing Zhou Wen pushing Xiaoya to the ground with a look of contempt, Li Xuan spewed out a mouthful of alcohol as he choked and coughed.The room instantly fell silent as the eight sexy girls looked at Zhou Wen as though he was a monster.Xiaoya was half-slumped on the ground as she wore a look of disbelief. She next felt aggrieved and furious. As she got to her feet, she cursed, \u201cWhy resort to violence? Serves you right to be single!\u201dZhou Wen was focused on killing the Mutated Vigor Ant and hadn\u2019t noticed her rage. He ignored her and continued rapidly firing commands into his phone.Upon seeing Xiaoya\u2019s aggrieved look, Li Xuan was amused. This punk\u2019s quite interesting!Xiaoya was a headliner at this private club. Although her demeanor was inferior to the top escorts in the big cities, her figure was unparalleled. Even Li Xuan found Xiaoya excellent in everything other than her demeanor, speech, and actions. She left him rather mesmerized.However, Zhou Wen\u2019s look of contempt when he pushed her amused him greatly.If it isn\u2019t because this punk is a naturally insensitive man, there\u2019s a high chance that he has gynophobia because of the beating he suffered under An Jing, a woman. Li Xuan thought without any ill intent.Zhou Wen sat there gaming the entire time. Li Xuan quickly lost his interest in him and began reveling in fun again.The entire club\u2019s top floor had been reserved by Li Xuan. There was everything one needed. Li Xuan\u2019s ignorance of Zhou Wen was something the latter enjoyed as well. He could keep grinding in-game.After storming the Ant Nest for an hour, Zhou Wen once again arrived at the area he had previously spotted the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. Indeed, it had grown a pair of silver wings and its entire body was silver like the typical flying ant.It was extremely fast and even though Zhou Wen was prepared, he wasn\u2019t able to last long against it. Soon, he had his chest impaled by the Silver-Winged Flying Ant as it flew across the sky.It was extremely fast and it was very agile in midair. It was able to change trajectory like a bat, causing Zhou Wen\u2019s Vigor Divine Fist to be of no use against it. He couldn\u2019t hit it.Although the Silver-Winged Flying Ant is powerful, it\u2019s unlikely to have reached the Legendary stage. Killing it isn\u2019t impossible, but I need to make careful plans. Zhou Wen thought.From his observations, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s Strength and Constitution were not weaker than that of the Mutated Vigor Ant. Furthermore, its speed was much faster than the Mutated Vigor Ant. This was also why it was so difficult to beat.Rank 9 Vigor Divine Fist was likely capable of injuring the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, but without being able to touch it, no amount of Strength mattered.Also, the ant horde\u2019s influence on Zhou Wen was significant. Although Zhou Wen and his Mutated Vigor Ant weren\u2019t afraid of a huge group of Vigor Ants, it severely restricted his freedom of movement, making him unable to dodge the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s attacks in the confined space.From the looks of it, to kill it, I need to deliver the attack at the moment it approaches. However, it\u2019s not easy to grasp the opportunity. Zhou Wen entered the game again and as he stormed towards the area where the Silver-Winged Flying Ant resided, he considered how he could seize the opportunity to deliver a counterattack.After about an hour, Zhou Wen once again arrived in front of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. At the instant the latter charged and appeared above the blood-colored avatar, Zhou Wen threw out Vigor Divine Fist in a bid to kill it.However, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s body did a bizarre twist when it was less than half a feet from Zhou Wen\u2019s fist. While dodging the Vigor Divine Fist, its blade-like claws decapitated the blood-colored avatar from the back.Zhou Wen made repeated attempts, but all of them ended with failure. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant was just too nimble and his Vigor Divine Fist just couldn\u2019t touch it.The only time he hit the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was when he used Inch Punch. He threw out the punch when it was extremely close to him and had successfully hit it.However, Inch Punch wasn\u2019t augmented like a Primordial Energy Skill. It wasn\u2019t too effective when hitting the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and failed to seriously damage it.If only Vigor Divine Fist can deliver strength just like Inch Punch. That way, I don\u2019t have to waste so much time swinging my arm. I\u2019ll then have the chance of releasing my strength instantaneously when it\u2019s in close proximity to kill it. Unfortunately, Vigor Divine Fist is an in-game technique\u2026 That\u2019s not right\u2026 The in-game character is no different from me. If I\u2019m able to use Vigor Divine Fist like Inch Punch, I\u2019ll be able to deliver explosive strength at short distances. As such, my in-game character will also be able to do it\u2026 Realizing this, Zhou Wen put away his phone and began experimenting with how he could deliver Vigor Divine Fist using the principles of Inch Punch.Vigor Divine Fist was a very open and showy move, a Primordial Energy Skill that delivered a critical strike. When delivering it, he had to make some huge retracting moves, somewhat different from Inch Punch. Clearly, to modify Vigor Divine Fist\u2019s delivery to be similar to Inch Punch\u2019s was very difficult.Zhou Wen made repeated attempts and although it was very difficult, he wasn\u2019t willing to give up.Li Xuan woke up from his nap and saw Zhou Wen throwing out punches again and again in the corner as if he was practicing punching.He didn\u2019t pay much notice at first, imagining that Zhou Wen was tired from gaming and was simply stretching his body. However, when he realized Zhou Wen was still punching two hours later, he couldn\u2019t help but observe.This is Inch Punch? But the way strength is delivered and the magnitude of the movement is too much. It\u2019s terrible. Li Xuan lost interest after watching for a moment. Zhou Wen\u2019s punches weren\u2019t anything worth watching.Two days before the college entrance exams, Zhou Wen kept trying to fuse the Vigor Divine Fist and Inch Punch together. He had a brief inkling of what was needed but was unable to fully master it.Time quickly passed and the college entrance exams began. The first three days were ordinary high school subjects. After Yu Qiubai came with their candidate passes, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan headed for their exam centers separately and completed their own examinations.On the fourth day, Zhou Wen came to the combat test venue and met up with Li Xuan.The combat test was held in a dimensional zone. As every dimensional zone was different, there were some differences in the combat test across districts.Guide City\u2019s combat test was held in Guide Ancient City. In the dimensional storms decades ago, a dimensional rift opened, turning the area into a dimensional zone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe vegetation outside the ancient city was abnormally luxuriant. The moat\u2019s banks were lined with willow trees, all more than ten meters tall. Even the normal grass on the roadside was half an adult\u2019s height.The moat\u2019s surface was filled with lotuses the size of boats. The lotus flowers were the size of a face washbasin and they presented a strange redness as though they were dyed in blood.Due to the influence of the dimensional zone, the nearby animals had experienced different levels of mutations. However, the mutations weren\u2019t as serious as those inside the dimensional zone.Stationed outside the ancient city were armed soldiers with tanks patrolling the area. Without an entry pass, no one was allowed into the ancient city.There were even surface-to-air missiles installed in the vicinity. However, Zhou Wen had never seen those missiles launch.In fact, the threat firearms had on dimensional creatures was highly limited. Little damage would be incurred even if a nuclear bomb were to explode inside a dimensional zone. It would lead to more dimensional creatures absorbing the radioactive energies and mutating to become more terrifying.Ordinary bullets were even more useless. When shot at dimensional creatures, they would be devoured and fuse with them.Only bullets made from special materials could generate damage on dimensional creatures, but those materials were very rare to begin with. Making such expendable bullets was wasteful, so they were typically made into melee weapons like swords and sabers.Firearms were not very useful against dimensional creatures, but they still dealt plenty of damage on humans. These days, the main usage of such weapons was solely to maintain order in human society.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t have an entry pass, but his candidate pass could be used as one. During the combat test, these passes allowed a single entry into Guide Ancient City via the north gate.Guide Ancient City had four gates at the four directions. It wasn\u2019t a small city, and circling the entire city didn\u2019t even cover more than five kilometers.However, after the dimensional storms, Guide Ancient City became a dimensional zone. The space within became several times bigger than it originally was. To date, humans had yet to completely explore the whole of it.Entry via the different gates allowed one to encounter different dimensional creatures. The creatures encountered from the north gate were the weakest. Typically not much danger, as long as one didn\u2019t venture too deep.As the candidate pass only allowed four people to enter together after a verification process, Zhou Wen could only stand outside the ancient city\u2019s gate to wait for Li Xuan and the two other teammates who Zhou Wen had never met. Luckily there was still some time before the entrance closed.The ancient city\u2019s north gate was ancient and mysterious. Its bricks were mottled and worn, with many spots having signs of weathering.However, Zhou Wen had heard of stories in which the troops had bombarded Guide Ancient City with massive amounts of ordnance for more than ten minutes. Yet, not a single tile, from the seemingly desolate ancient city, shattered.Above the city gate was a board with the words \u201cGuide City\u201d written in traditional text. They had an ancient and vigorous flair with a lingering charm that went back a thousand years.Zhou Wen\u2019s gaze finally fell onto the strange symbol at the end of the gate\u2019s board.The symbol looked like a palm-sized indentation left by a baby\u2019s palm. However, inside the mark was an engraved pattern that looked like a bulb of garlic or onion.Guide Ancient City naturally hadn\u2019t had such a symbol in the past. Legend had it that this strange symbol appeared after the dimensional storms, but no one knew the meaning of it. Nor did anyone know who had engraved it.Zhou Wen was studying the symbol when he suddenly felt the phone in his pocket vibrate.Believing that Yu Qiubai or Li Xuan was looking for him, Zhou Wen reached into his pocket to take it out. But he was left momentarily stunned.This was because the phone inside that pocket wasn\u2019t the phone he usually used. Instead, it was the mysterious phone. It didn\u2019t have any calling functionality, nor had it ever vibrated. So why would it suddenly do so now?Seeing no one around him was looking, Zhou Wen took out the phone from his pocket and saw that the screen had automatically lit up. A camera icon was flashing on it.Why didn\u2019t I see this camera app in the past? What use does it have? Does it want me to take a selfie? Zhou Wen was puzzled as he tapped the camera icon.Like an ordinary phone, it entered photography mode. However, it wasn\u2019t taking a picture of Zhou Wen. The rear camera had been activated.Thankfully, the ancient city didn\u2019t restrict photography. Therefore, the soldiers didn\u2019t approach to stop him despite seeing him taking out his phone to take a picture.Zhou Wen raised the phone and pointed it at the vegetation beside him in an attempt to figure out the uses of the photography function.He quickly realized that it was apparently broken. There was no way for him to press the shutter button to take the picture.The phone still wouldn\u2019t take a picture of the scenery despite Zhou Wen\u2019s finger tapping the screen. There wasn\u2019t any reaction.What exactly is it? Zhou Wen raised his phone and waved it around. When the city gate\u2019s tiny hand symbol appeared on screen, there was a beep. Surprisingly, the phone responded.Zhou Wen was alarmed as he took a careful look. He realized that there was a green box that appeared on screen that locked onto the strange palm symbol above the city gate.After three consecutive beeps, the palm symbol was zoomed in. The ancient city in the background gradually blurred and the words beneath appeared: \u201cLoading\u2026\u201dCould it be\u2026 Zhou Wen looked at his phone with the loading screen as a thought flashed across his mind. This thought gave him a fright as he found it unbelievable.But before long, the phone proved that his guess was correct. The loading completed and the hand symbol turned into an icon that appeared on the phone\u2019s home screen. It was right beside the Ant Nest logo, with the three words: \u201cAncient Imperial City.\u201dIt\u2019s really become a game dungeon? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised as he held back his excitement and tapped the Ancient Imperial City icon.Indeed, the screen displayed the familiar loading screen of the game. After a while, the interface changed into Guide Ancient City\u2019s north gate. Unlike reality, the door to the ancient city was already open.Zhou Wen dripped a drop of blood on the screen which manifested into the blood-colored avatar that directly walked through the gates.The sights that welcomed him were ancient stone pavements and antiquated old wooden buildings. Although Zhou Wen had never entered Guide Ancient City, he had seen videos of its interior on the Internet. It was identical to what he was seeing.Before Zhou Wen could do a comparison, a ragged-clothed skeleton holding a bone club appeared on the streets. It ran straight for the blood-colored avatar.Zhou Wen had seen this creature before in the videos. It was none other than Guide Ancient City\u2019s dimensional creature, Skeleton Soldier.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySkeleton Soldiers were rather weak dimensional creatures. They had slow Speed, medium Strength, and weak Constitution. They had been taught in school how to deal with them. A typical high schooler who wasn\u2019t too terrible at cultivation had no trouble dealing with one or two Skeleton Soldiers.Although Zhou Wen had never fought with a real Skeleton Soldier before, he could tell that they were much weaker than Vigor Ants. He didn\u2019t know how much Strength or Constitution it had, but its Speed was at a max of 3.Controlling his blood-colored avatar to rush over, Zhou Wen met the Skeleton Soldier as it struck down with the club but due to its extremely slow speed, it was reduced to scattering bones by the blood-colored avatar before it could even land a hit.Ding!Amidst the pile of broken bones, a dimensional crystal dropped. Upon scrutiny, it was a Skeleton Soldier Crystal.Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. The chance of a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal dropping was very low. To have one drop almost immediately meant he was very lucky.Unfortunately, the Skeleton Soldier\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill is supposedly Skeleton Palm. It can only boost some Strength and its effect isn\u2019t very strong. Besides, it\u2019s typically a low Rank 1 Primordial Energy Skill. Zhou Wen recalled the information he learned from school and felt somewhat disappointed.Getting the blood-colored avatar to pick up the Skeleton Soldier Crystal, caused it to instantly transform into a gray stream that bored into the blood-colored avatar\u2019s body.Zhou Wen also felt a cold aura go from his phone to his palm. Then, it circulated through his body, forming a strange Primordial Energy circulation path.Obtained Primordial Energy Skill: Skeleton Palm (Rank 1). Expends 1 Primordial Energy.Skeleton Palm expends 1 Primordial Energy per use. It uses much less than Vigor Divine Fist but is much weaker. It should be one of the weakest Primordial Energy Skills. Zhou Wen knew that typically, the stronger the Primordial Energy Skill, the more Primordial Energy it used. Something that only expended 1 Primordial Energy was definitely weak.Since it wasn\u2019t convenient to test the might of Skeleton Palm, Zhou Wen made the blood-colored avatar continue walking deeper into Ancient Imperial City.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t know why Guide Ancient City would be renamed as Ancient Imperial City in-game. Based on what he knew, Guide City was an ancient city with a long history. In ancient times, it had the names of Yingtian and Shangqiu, and its history traced back to the mythical times of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.Emperor Zhuan Xu of the Five Emperors had once set up his capital here before moving it to Diqiu. The leader of the Three Sovereigns, Suiren was born here. Likewise for Emperor Ku of the Five Emperors and his son, Xie of Shang.A name like Emperor Ku was probably unfamiliar to the average person, but Emperor Ku was the underlying archetype in which Emperor Dijun was depicted in the classic text of mythic creatures, Classic of Mountains and Seas.These were all myths and no one knew if they truly existed. However, after the dimensional storms, Guide Ancient City became a dimensional zone, and to date, it hadn\u2019t been fully explored.A few years ago, powerful humans at the Epic stage stormed deep into Guide Ancient City, never to return. From that moment forth, no one dared to venture deep into it.Over the past few decades of evolution, the strongest human was only at the half-step Mythical stage. In fact, that only meant the peak Epic stage. The disappearance of such an expert spoke volumes of how terrifying the deep depths of the ancient city were.Thankfully, the dimensional zones seemed to have powerful restrictions, making it difficult for the dimensional creatures to rush out of the zone\u2019s confines. Otherwise, human society would probably be in pandemonium, and wouldn\u2019t be as calm as it was.Summoning the Mutated Vigor Ant, he charged deep into Ancient Imperial City with it. From time to time, Skeleton Soldiers would charge up to him only to be easily slain by him and the ant.However, apart from the first Skeleton Soldier encounter, no other crystals dropped. The drop rates of Skeleton Soldiers were lower than Vigor Ants.In the game, Zhou Wen tried the might of the Skeleton Palm, and unsurprisingly, it was much weaker than Vigor Divine Fist. It boosted his Strength by about 10\u201320%, making it significantly weaker than Tian Xiangdong\u2019s Lightning Fist.However, there was a pro to Skeleton Palm. It had a mildness to it, and the amount of motion required when delivering it was minimized. It was agile and quick, unlike Vigor Divine Fist which required open and exaggerated actions.Skeleton Palm is more suitable for fusing with Inch Punch. However, Skeleton Palm is too weak. Even if I fuse it, the damage against the Silver-Winged Flying Ant will be limited. As Zhou Wen was in thought, he sensed someone walking towards him.There were quite a number of students gathering for the combat test. However, Zhou Wen had chosen a corner, so anyone who walked over was highly likely to be looking for him.Thankfully, there weren\u2019t many Skeleton Soldiers, so the Mutated Vigor Ant was more than sufficient to handle them, making it possible for Zhou Wen to divert his attention. He looked up and took a glance.Believing that it was Li Xuan, Zhou Wen was surprised when he identified the person. It was An Jing who he hadn\u2019t seen since she had defeated him in one move.An Jing was a girl who didn\u2019t have the modern interpretation of beauty. She didn\u2019t have a sharp chin, double eyelids, or a high nose. She looked more like a classic beauty with a petite nose and a slight chubbiness to her face that wore a sharp, masculine air. She had feline-like eyes and her gaze was firm and forceful.She was taller than Fang Ruoxi and was almost Zhou Wen\u2019s height. To men, a woman this tall exuded a suppressive feeling. It was especially so with An Jing\u2019s demeanor that automatically warded off strangers. Boys with slightly weaker willpower might not even dare to look her in the eye.An Jing walked straight to Zhou Wen and, without waiting for him to say a word, she threw a USB drive at him.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Zhou Wen caught it and asked An Jing in puzzlement.\u201cUncle Feng got me to give this to you.\u201d An Jing glanced at the phone Zhou Wen was holding and said in a seemingly mocking tone, \u201cHowever, I think Uncle Feng\u2019s painstaking actions were for nothing. Anything, no matter how good it is, is a waste when given to someone who wallows in self-misery.\u201dBefore Zhou Wen could say a word, An Jing turned and walked a few steps before pausing. Without looking back, she said, \u201cIn the future, don\u2019t you say that you\u2019re from the An family. Our family does not want such a weakling like you.\u201dWith that said, An Jing walked off without turning back. Once she had left the warning zone, she left in a car with a military license plate.Zhou Wen stared blankly as the military vehicle left. Only then did he shake his head and mutter, \u201cI\u2019m not from your family to begin with. Neither did I plan on rubbing off some of your family\u2019s glory. Perhaps you guys are overthinking things.\u201dPlacing the USB drive into his pocket, Zhou Wen continued grinding the Ancient Imperial City dungeon and kept killing Skeleton Soldiers.Even if nothing good dropped, it allowed him to familiarize himself with the environment inside Ancient Imperial City.Although the school had provided them with the information and a map of the ancient city, the map was only limited to the vicinity around the northern city gate. On the one hand, the map wasn\u2019t complete and on the other hand, it was to prevent the students from venturing too deep into the ancient city for fear of any mishaps.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIf Zhou Wen didn\u2019t have the phone or the game dungeon, he wouldn\u2019t have ventured deep into the ancient city either. It would be risking his life for nothing and there was no need to do so.But things were different now. He could venture deep into the game dungeon and figure out the situation inside. When he later entered the ancient city, he would naturally be familiar, reducing his risk.It was quite similar to the information and maps given by the school. The region in the vicinity of the north gates had some Skeleton Soldiers. These Skeleton Soldiers were slightly stronger than adult men who had never cultivated. Against high schoolers who had cultivated, they were only in for a beating. Unless one courted death and charged into a horde of Skeleton Soldiers, it typically wouldn\u2019t be too dangerous.Without much holding him back, Zhou Wen made the blood-colored avatar ride on the Mutated Vigor Ant and storm in. Even if he encountered Skeleton Soldiers that formed a group of a dozen or so, the Mutated Vigor Ant was easily able to kill the horde. It wasn\u2019t something Zhou Wen needed the blood-colored avatar to take action on.Soon, Zhou Wen rushed outside of the map given by the school.The ancient city\u2019s interior was filled with stone-paved streets and ancient buildings. The further he ventured, the more ancient the style of the buildings.Zhou Wen only dared to proceed along the streets and avoided the ancient buildings that lined them. In the education curriculum, it had been repeatedly mentioned that it was best that one didn\u2019t enter the buildings of dimensional zones. Many buildings were connected to dimensional rifts, so entry might lead to getting lost in a different dimension.The drop rate of Skeleton Soldiers was extremely low. He had killed more than two hundred, but other than his first Skeleton Soldier, nothing else had dropped.Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t surprised by this. He had previously heard that Skeleton Soldiers seldom condensed dimensional crystals because of their low level.Although Skeleton Palm was weak, it was really rare to obtain a Skeleton Palm Crystal.While in thought, he suddenly saw a group of Skeleton Soldiers on the street up ahead. There were about twenty to thirty of them. This was the biggest horde of Skeleton Soldiers he had seen since he had stepped in.Unlike the Skeleton Soldiers from before, this horde of Skeleton Soldiers was surrounding a skeleton horse. Riding it was a Skeleton General wielding a bone spear.The Skeleton General on the skeleton horse was clearly taller and stronger than the typical Skeleton Soldier. It was at least one head taller. Furthermore, its skull was especially thick. It wasn\u2019t the ordinary grayish-white color as it had an ivory sheen to it.The armor he wore was ragged, but he wore a dark red cape over his back. Although it was somewhat old, it was complete.The bone spear was about two meters long and its surface was rough. Its tip was sharp like a thorn and it was barbed. If one was stabbed by the spear, it would probably lead to incessant bleeding.When Zhou Wen saw him, the Skeleton General had also seen the blood-colored avatar and Mutated Vigor Ant controlled by Zhou Wen. However, he wasn\u2019t like the typical dimensional creature who immediately charged forward. Instead, he continued riding on his skeleton horse as though he loathed the idea of attacking. It was the horde of Skeleton Soldiers that charged forward like savage tigers and wolves.The Mutated Vigor Ants front claws sliced like Death\u2019s scythe and in one revolution, cleaved through the Skeleton Soldiers, killing around ten of them.The fellow on the skeleton horse finally couldn\u2019t put up with it and it roared into the sky, letting out a harsh, terrifying cry before charging forward.The skeleton horse\u2019s speed wasn\u2019t something the typical Skeleton Soldier could compare with. It even took Zhou Wen by surprise for it was faster than the Mutated Vigor Ant and the blood-colored avatar. It swept over like a tornado in no way slower than the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.In the blink of an eye, the skeleton horse landed in front of the Mutated Vigor Ant. Zhou Wen commanded the Mutated Vigor Ant to meet the enemy with its claws, hoping to hold back the bone spear before the blood-colored avatar leaped up to strike at the enemy\u2019s head.But to his surprise, the bone spear accelerated, turning into a blur in Zhou Wen\u2019s vision as though it had vanished for a moment.By the time Zhou Wen could see again, the bone spear had penetrated the Mutated Vigor Ant\u2019s claws, stabbing straight into the blood-colored avatar\u2019s chest.Boom!Blood spewed out as the blood-colored avatar was thrown off the back of the Mutated Vigor Ant. The game screen instantly went black. Clearly, he had died an instant death.That powerful? Zhou Wen felt a little delighted. Challenges were meant to be met and overcome. Killing the ordinary Skeleton Soldiers was meaningless as they didn\u2019t drop anything fancy.Just as he was about to restart the game, he saw Li Xuan walking over with two similarly aged youths.Zhou Wen had never met them before. They didn\u2019t appear to be students of Guide High School, and there was a high chance that they were like Li Xuan, being a student of Guide High School in name, but had never schooled there.\u201cWhen we enter the ancient city, you don\u2019t have to do a thing. Just follow by my side, leave the rest to them.\u201d Li Xuan didn\u2019t introduce Zhou Wen to the two youths. All he did was give a casual warning.\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhou Wen nodded in agreement. Since he could easily pass the combat test, he had no plans on stealing the limelight.With the two youths having no intention to greet him, Zhou Wen was happy to be free of the small talk. He stood by the side as he continued gaming.While the two youths discussed the combat test with Li Xuan, they kept assuring him, claiming that with them around, Li Xuan was definitely getting first on the Guide City combat test.Their tone made it seem as though obtaining first in the Guide City combat test was as easy as drinking water.\u201cThat may be so, but you have to do it well for me. Nothing must go wrong. I have to be first in the Guide City combat test at all cost,\u201d Li Xuan said.\u201cBrother Xuan, rest assured. What kind of true experts can there be in a small place like Guide City? Ignoring the fact that I\u2019ll be joining forces with Jiang Hao, just me alone would be able to guarantee that you get first,\u201d Xu Miantu said without any concern.Seeing Li Xuan frown slightly, Jiang Hao hurriedly said, \u201cBrother Xuan, rest assured. We will do our best. We guarantee you that nothing will go wrong.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Only then did Li Xuan nod slightly.Xu Miantu was still about to say something when he saw someone walking over.The four turned their heads over. It was a tall beauty who easily lit up the eyes of others.\u201cZhou Wen, it\u2019s great that you can find a team,\u201d Fang Ruoxi came in front of Zhou Wen as she said in relief.Zhou Wen smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s all thanks to Li Xuan. I\u2019m able to join the combat test thanks to him.\u201dFang Ruoxi didn\u2019t know Li Xuan, nor did she know Xu Miantu and Jiang Hao. However, she felt a weight lift off her chest that Zhou Wen was able to participate. She said with a smile, \u201cI thought I could still try my luck at first, but with you around, I guess first is impossible.\u201dXu Miantu wasn\u2019t too happy when he heard that. Fang Ruoxi\u2019s words sounded as though them teaming up with Zhou Wen was them taking advantage of him.\u201cBabe, with Zhou Wen joining us, you can be at ease. Although he has no hopes of getting into the top three, it\u2019s still easy to guarantee that he gets fourth thanks to the team,\u201d Xu Miantu said to Fang Ruoxi with a grin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFang Ruoxi glanced at Xu Miantu before ignoring him. She continued looking at Zhou Wen and said, \u201cZhou Wen, what school do you plan on attending?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it yet,\u201d Zhou Wen said.Fang Ruoxi nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. With how capable you are, you can attend any school you wish. There\u2019s no rush. That\u2019s good too. I\u2019ll try my best to complete this test. I hope my results aren\u2019t too far from yours.\u201dWith that said, Fang Ruoxi waved her hand at Zhou Wen, turned around and left. From beginning to end, she had ignored Xu Miantu.Xu Miantu was displeased with this treatment, but it wasn\u2019t the right place to flare up. All he did was shoot a glance at Zhou Wen and said to Jiang Hao and Li Xuan, \u201cPeople from small cities really have limited horizons. What a waste of her good looks, too bad she lacks brains and eyes.\u201dJiang Hao didn\u2019t say a word, but Li Xuan\u2019s interest in Zhou Wen was slightly piqued. He asked Zhou Wen, \u201cI heard that you were once Guide High School\u2019s number one genius. From the looks of it, that\u2019s true. That chick seems to hold you in high regard.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just encouragement between fellow students. She\u2019s excellent herself and no way weaker than me. Placed anywhere, she will be one of a handful of cultivation geniuses,\u201d Zhou Wen said.Xu Miantu could naturally tell that Zhou Wen was rebutting him. He said in disdain, \u201cIf you were really excellent, why would you need us to carry you?\u201dLi Xuan hadn\u2019t informed Xu Miantu and company about Zhou Wen. All he had said was that he was helping a friend to take a student along with them for the participation of the combat test.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t defend himself, finding an argument with Xu Miantu beneath him.Li Xuan cut off Xu Miantu who still hadn\u2019t said his piece. \u201cEnough, cut it out. It\u2019s about time we enter. All of you are to focus.\u201dWith Li Xuan saying so, all Xu Miantu could do was swallow the words he was about to say. He gave Zhou Wen a pissed look.The examiners were already verifying the students\u2019 candidacies. With four people a team, they each brought their candidature passes to a verification machine. They gathered their fingerprints, scanned their passes, and checked the items on them. Only when they were confirmed to be the candidate in question and that they hadn\u2019t brought any item that aided in cheating, were they allowed entry into the ancient city.Most of the students weren\u2019t nervous. Instead, it was the family who came with them who were almost fainting while standing beyond the warning line. They watched helplessly as the students entered the ancient city, some almost having a cardiac arrest.Zhou Wen and his team lined up to go through the inspection, passing through a secured passage, before arriving in front of the ancient city.The gates to the ancient city had already opened, but everything inside seemed to be a blurry mist. There was no way to discern the interior.Guarding the ancient city\u2019s gates, the soldiers who were armed to the teeth urged, \u201cStop looking and enter quickly. There are plenty of people lining up behind you.\u201dZhou Wen followed Li Xuan and company to walk towards the ancient city\u2019s gates. With the trio walking into the ancient city, he followed closely behind them. However, when they passed through the gates, he realized he couldn\u2019t see them.He hurriedly walked through the blurry gates and felt a strange giddiness overwhelm him as he got goosebumps all over him.But with just one step, the scene before Zhou Wen\u2019s eyes opened up. The mist inside the ancient city was gone. He could clearly see the stone-paved streets and ancient buildings with blue tiles and red walls lining the streets. Li Xuan and the other two were right in front, just a few steps away from him.Those scientists have theorized that the dimensional zones are equivalent to another spatial dimension. It does seem to make sense from the looks of it.After most students had entered, they curiously sized up the ancient city just like Zhou Wen.Although they had watched some of the footage inside Guide Ancient City from the school\u2019s video material, to truly step in here gave them a different feeling. The antiquity and feeling that seemed to span the entire gamut of human experiences were things that video footage couldn\u2019t capture.The examiner gathered the batch of candidates and mentioned a few key things to take note of. When that was done, the combat test officially began.All the students who participated in the test rushed for the ancient city\u2019s streets and alleys, hoping to kill the most number of Skeleton Soldiers to obtain a better result.Of course, there were people who had the hope that a few dimensional crystals would drop during the test. That would make things even better.The Earth League had made it clear that any dimensional crystals that dropped during the combat test were the property of the students themselves.However, the examiner had also made it clear that the student was to be responsible for whatever happened during the test.According to the League\u2019s laws, after reaching the age of sixteen, one could freely choose to take the combat test. The responsibility was theirs to undertake. Even if death was to occur, the League wouldn\u2019t provide a single cent of compensation.Compared to the other subjects in the college entrance exams, only a few hundred students from the city actually participated in the combat test. Inside the transformed ancient city, they appeared inconspicuous.Zhou Wen and Li Xuan headed deep into the ancient city. In the beginning, there were plenty of students, so the Skeleton Soldiers that appeared weren\u2019t enough for them to kill. Li Xuan and company didn\u2019t intend to snatch the mobs with the other students, so they circled around the battlefields and ventured deep into the ancient city.Xu Miantu and Jiang Hao took point and every Skeleton Soldier they encountered was taken down with one strike. Mobs of Skeleton Soldiers were nothing worth mentioning due to the huge disparity in strength.Amidst the skeleton of the Skeleton Soldiers, there was a bone the size of a rice grain. Each Skeleton Soldier only had one of those, and one\u2019s score in the combat test was determined by the number of bones that had been gathered.However, the number of bones could only determine a team\u2019s ranking. The ranking within the team was determined by the number of dimensional crystals.Perhaps it was a coincidence, but the direction the quartet was heading in happened to be the one Zhou Wen had attempted while in-game. As they stormed their way through the ancient city, all the scenery was identical to the one in-game.It wasn\u2019t only the ancient buildings in the ancient city. Even the number of Skeleton Soldiers that appeared was identical to the game.Does this mean that we will be meeting that fellow on the skeleton horse? However, Zhou Wen quickly had another idea. That area had exceeded the confines of the test, so it was unlikely Li Xuan and company would risk entering.But things exceeded his expectations. Xu Miantu and company stormed their way through without stopping when they reached the boundary of the test. They went straight out of the test\u2019s boundaries.\u201cLi Xuan, we have already left the test boundaries. Should we be heading back?\u201d Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan.Before Li Xuan said a word, Xu Miantu said in contempt, \u201cThe area of the test is so tiny. The number of Skeleton Soldiers is extremely limited. Even if we could get all of them, how many can we get? If you\u2019re afraid, just wait here until we return. There\u2019s no need for you to follow us in.\u201dLi Xuan also said with a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We have the complete information of Guide Ancient City. All we will encounter for the next ten to fifteen kilometers are Skeleton Soldiers. There won\u2019t be any Legendary stage dimensional creatures appearing. The test\u2019s area is rather conservative because they do not wish for students to get into accidents. Just as Miantu said, with that small number of Skeleton Soldiers in the test area, it\u2019s not enough for us to get a high score. It\u2019s almost necessary that we continue forward.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUpon seeing the trio\u2019s expression, Zhou Wen knew that his persuasion was completely useless.He did have the intention to stay behind, ignoring whatever the trio might encounter. However, his results would be severely impacted if they were to die inside. He might even be removed from the list of candidates from the top schools.Also, Yu Qiubai had introduced him, so he had the responsibility to help Li Xuan attain good results. Although Li Xuan didn\u2019t think so, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t wish to see Li Xuan sending himself to his death. That would affect Yu Qiubai\u2019s reputation and it was highly likely that the Li family would blame it on Yu Qiubai.Let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t venture too deep. As long as they don\u2019t approach the area where the Skeleton General is, there shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem. Zhou Wen thought without saying another word as he followed Li Xuan and company.Seeing Zhou Wen silent, Xu Miantu imagined that it was because Zhou Wen didn\u2019t dare be alone. He scoffed in contempt. \u201cWhen one\u2019s a burden, one should realize that. Just follow us obediently and cut the nonsense.\u201dZhou Wen didn\u2019t have the interest or time to bother with him. Taking out his phone, he secretly dripped a drop of blood before entering the Ancient Imperial City game dungeon.He wanted to venture ahead to test the Skeleton General\u2019s strength. It was best if he could find a way to kill him, and even if he failed, he could at least find a way to ensure his survival in front of him.After all, Jiang Hao and Xu Miantu were taking point, killing all the Skeleton Soldiers that rushed at them. There was nothing Zhou Wen needed to do.The danger was nonexistent. Even if a Skeleton Soldier were to rush at him, he could easily finish it off with his present strength.Zhou Wen kept walking behind, unafraid that they would see his screen since they were unlikely to recognize it.The game interface followed a cartoon style, making it very disparate from real life. The typical person wouldn\u2019t make the connection.Li Xuan was like Zhou Wen; he had nothing to do. When he saw Zhou Wen taking out his phone to game in such an area, he quipped, \u201cYou are really a gaming addict. You still feel like gaming in here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like I have anything else to do, so I\u2019m just playing games to kill time,\u201d Zhou Wen replied without looking up. His eyes were peeled to the screen as he controlled the blood-colored avatar, blazing a trail while riding the Mutated Vigor Ant.The ordinary Skeleton Soldiers were unable to block the Mutated Vigor Ant at all. Their bodies scattered from the impact and they weren\u2019t as fast as it was.Zhou Wen also couldn\u2019t be bothered to kill them. All he wanted was to rush to the spot where the Skeleton General was.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I shall game as well,\u201d Li Xuan said as he took out his phone. He tapped on the screen; the game he played a mystery.Li Xuan\u2019s gaming could be ignored, but Zhou Wen was also playing. This pissed off Xu Miantu.\u201cWhat the hell? Is this the number one genius of Guide High School? He\u2019s like a gaming nerd,\u201d Xu Miantu cursed under his breath in great displeasure.Although Xu Miantu and Jiang Hao were powerful, they were still made up of flesh and blood. They were still susceptible to fatigue and injury; therefore, when they encountered relatively large hordes of Skeleton Soldiers, they had to be very careful. This slowed down the speed of their advancement.As for Zhou Wen, he was charging the entire way in-game. His rate of progress was far faster than their progress in real life. In just half an hour, he arrived at the spot where he had met the skeleton horse-riding Skeleton General.Like the last time, that fellow immediately charged when it saw the blood-colored avatar and Mutated Vigor Ant. Its speed was terrifying, in no way something Zhou Wen and the Mutated Vigor Ant could compare with.This time, Zhou Wen was fully focused. He was thinking of ways to deal with the spear attacks, but when he saw the bone spear thrusting at him, he failed to dodge it. He didn\u2019t have the opportunity to extend his hand to block the attack before being penetrated in the chest.That was fast. This spear attack must be some type of Primordial Energy Skill. Zhou Wen could already confirm that the spear attack was a Primordial Energy Skill; otherwise, it was impossible that he had failed to even react.A speed-type Primordial Energy Skill? This fellow is more difficult than the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. However, that Silver-Winged Flying Ant apparently never used Primordial Energy Skills. As Zhou Wen pondered over the matter, he revived the blood-colored avatar, rode the Mutated Vigor Ant, and charged into the depths of Ancient Imperial City.As Zhou Wen rushed over, he carefully recalled the details of his previous two deaths. He hoped to find a strategy to deal with the Skeleton General by studying the details.By doing so, he came up with a few possibilities. However, their viability needed him to test them out to know if they worked.When he saw the Skeleton General charge at him again, Zhou Wen deliberately dodged the skeleton horse\u2019s direct charge. He wanted to know if the Primordial Energy Skill was only capable of a frontal thrust.The facts proved that he was wrong. When the blood-colored avatar dodged to the side of the skeleton horse under Zhou Wen\u2019s control, the bone spear tip swept a crescent arc like a stream of light, instantly decapitating the blood-colored avatar\u2019s head. It was no doubt an instant kill.Making mistakes wasn\u2019t a terrifying problem. What was terrifying was the lack of opportunity to amend strategies. However, the mysterious phone was what gave Zhou Wen this opportunity for amendments.His Primordial Energy Skill is not only a thrust, but it\u2019s also capable of side cleaving. This makes it difficult. Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t discouraged; instead, he secretly dripped another drop of blood on the phone\u2019s screen.Perhaps it was because of his severe loss of blood in the past month or so, Zhou Wen felt a little giddy.I need to think of means to replenish my blood in the future. If this continues, I might really end up dying from anemia. Zhou Wen felt a slight headache, but he couldn\u2019t think of a good solution.With the first experiment failing, all Zhou Wen could do was switch methods. Thankfully, he was only making attempts in-game. If it happened in real life, there was no way he would do something beyond his means. After all, he only had one life. He couldn\u2019t just bet on it.While Zhou Wen made his attempts, Xu Miantu and company were continuing their push forward.The dimensional creatures in the dimensional zone were nearly endless. As the zone was connected to dimensional rifts, even if the creatures were wiped out, the area would be occupied again by new creatures. There was no way of killing them all.However, the dimensional rifts weren\u2019t stable. Pan-dimensional creatures didn\u2019t appear at random, so after clearing an area, there wouldn\u2019t be any Skeleton Soldiers appearing for a short period of time. Xu Miantu and company\u2019s advancement was still pretty good.The chances of Skeleton Soldiers producing dimensional crystals were quite small, with one Strength Crystal being dug out from the Skeleton Soldiers\u2019 bodies every two to three hundred Skeleton Soldiers.Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t a game. They could only roughly identify the Strength Crystals, but had no idea what their values were.The Strength Crystal was naturally Li Xuan\u2019s. In fact, as long as he had one, he would be first in the team.\u201cWe\u2019ve already hunted enough Skeleton Soldiers. We are very far from the determined region of the test. We need to rush back before the end. Can we not continue proceeding forward?\u201d Upon noticing that they were approaching the Skeleton General\u2019s region, Zhou Wen said once again to Li Xuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBefore Li Xuan could say a word, Xu Miantu said, \u201cIt\u2019s still early, and the number of bone beads we have isn\u2019t enough to guarantee us first place. We naturally need to proceed forward.\u201dJiang Hao also looked at the map and said, \u201cBased on the map, this area is still the safe zone. We can proceed another ten kilometers without encountering much danger.\u201dLi Xuan opened up the map on his phone and nodded after taking a look. \u201cBased on the information, there aren\u2019t any Legendary stage creatures in the vicinity. It should be ok if we proceed forward a little. We need to obtain enough bone beads to be the bona fide winners of Guide City. We cannot afford otherwise.\u201dZhou Wen knew that he needed to dissuade Li Xuan and company from proceeding forward; otherwise, the death of any one of them when they encountered the Skeleton General would drastically affect his results.Although Zhou Wen didn\u2019t have any plans to enter high society via the university he attended, he still wished to enroll in a reputable university.If any of the four of them died, the chances of entering a top reputable university became extremely slim. No matter how well he did in his other subjects, he would only be able to enroll in a first-rate university. That wasn\u2019t something Zhou Wen wanted.\u201cLi Xuan, do you believe in the sixth sense?\u201d Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and asked Li Xuan.\u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d Li Xuan didn\u2019t directly answer as he asked with piqued interest.\u201cI find my sixth sense better than most people. Since I was little, I would have a vague feeling just before encountering danger. This feeling leaves me very uncomfortable. Although I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a premonition for danger, I usually encounter trouble soon after.\u201d Zhou Wen continued, \u201cAnd I just had a very uncomfortable feeling.\u201d\u201cJust admit to being afraid. Why use sixth sense as an excuse?\u201d Xu Miantu spoke with contempt.Li Xuan sized up Zhou Wen for a moment before casting his gaze at Jiang Hao.Jiang Hao thought and then said, \u201cThe bone beads we have at present can\u2019t guarantee us first place. It might be a little inappropriate if we were to head back now.\u201dClearly, Jiang Hao was supportive of continuing forward.Seeing Li Xuan somewhat persuaded, Zhou Wen hurriedly said, \u201cLi Xuan, please trust me. Although this feeling of mine doesn\u2019t happen every time danger rears its head, great trouble is certain once I have this feeling. If I\u2019m just a coward, I could have just retreated to the entrance and waited for you guys. There isn\u2019t a need for me to tell you this.\u201dAfter a pause, Zhou Wen continued, \u201cJust as Xu Miantu said, Guide City is a small city. There aren\u2019t many high schoolers who are that strong. I doubt many high schoolers will dare to venture past the designated zone to kill Skeleton Soldiers. We have already obtained a sizable number of bone beads and can always return to the designated zone to kill more. First place is practically guaranteed without taking any risks. After all, we only have one life. There\u2019s no harm in being cautious.\u201d\u201cWhat you say makes sense.\u201d Li Xuan seemed to be moved by Zhou Wen\u2019s words as he nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s do this then. We shall head back before heading elsewhere to hunt Skeleton Soldiers.\u201d\u201cCome on, there\u2019s no need for that.\u201d Xu Miantu grumbled but didn\u2019t dare disobey Li Xuan\u2019s decision. He turned around and headed back with the team.Jiang Hao also followed and walked by Li Xuan\u2019s side.Obviously, Zhou Wen had already turned around to head back, but after taking two steps, he suddenly heard Jiang Hao exclaim. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dHe gave everyone a shock as they turned to look. They found him looking at an ancient building with a bewildered look as though he had seen something most terrifying.Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Xu Miantu subconsciously turned their heads to look when a glint flashed in Jiang Hao\u2019s hands. A strange jade dagger appeared in each of his hands.The jade dagger in Jiang Hao\u2019s left hand struck like a venomous snake\u2019s tongue, instantly stabbing Li Xuan. The foot-long blade plunged into his waist completely.This sudden development happened so abruptly that Xu Miantu didn\u2019t even realize what was happening when the other jade dagger in Jiang Hao\u2019s right hand swiped at his neck.Xu Miantu had retreated quickly but had failed to avoid being injured. Although none of his arteries were severed, his neck was instantly dyed red with blood.\u201cJiang Hao\u2026 What are you doing\u2026\u201d Xu Miantu wore a look of alarm as he covered the wound on his neck, shouting as he retreated. He was filled with disbelief over what had just happened.Jiang Hao ignored Xu Miantu as he clenched the pair of jade daggers with both hands, staring intently at the wound on Li Xuan\u2019s waist.He was responsible for the wound and he knew what kind of effect such a wound would have; however, the flesh and fat at the wound seemed to possess a certain force that exerted pressure on the wound. The tiny amount of blood that had seeped out was nearly impossible for a wound this deep.\u201cI never expected that the promiscuous third scion of the Li family would have mastered something that would require being a virgin\u2014the Invincible Connate Divine Art,\u201d Jiang Hao said slowly as he glared at Li Xuan.Zhou Wen was similarly alarmed when he heard \u201cInvincible Connate Divine Art.\u201dPrimordial Energy Skills and Companion Beasts could be obtained by hunting dimensional creatures, but Primordial Energy Arts weren\u2019t things that could be obtained by dimensional crystals.Legend had it that Primordial Energy Arts stemmed from ancient arts like Chinese qigong , battle qi , or Japanese ninjutsu . However, due to the lack of Primordial Energy Crystals in the past, those arts lacked the support of Primordial Energy, preventing them from expressing their true might.It was only when the dimensional creatures appeared, allowing humans to absorb dimensional crystals, that these arts grew in use, gradually developing into present-day Primordial Energy Arts.Primordial Energy Arts had significant effects on humans. Absorbing dimensional crystals allowed humans to grow stronger and evolve, but this wasn\u2019t sufficient at advancing between stages. Instead, it was Primordial Energy Arts that possessed the power to allow a breakthrough of such restrictions.For instance, if Zhou Wen wanted to advance from the Mortal stage to the Legendary stage, simply absorbing dimensional crystals would be insufficient. He would need to advance Ascetic Meditation to a whole new realm before his body would evolve to the Legendary stage.However, Primordial Energy Arts had their differences. Ascetic Meditation could, at best, advance Zhou Wen to the Legendary stage\u2014the maximum it could go. It was unable to advance Zhou Wen to the Epic stage no matter how much more he cultivated in it.Among the known Primordial Energy Arts, there were fewer than twenty that allowed humans to advance to the Epic stage. Invincible Connate Divine Art was one of them.Furthermore, Invincible Connate Divine Art had a strange cultivation requirement. It required the cultivator to be a virgin.Once one was no longer a virgin, the Invincible Connate Divine Art would become ineffective, losing all of its original might.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDue to the strange cultivation requirement, the Invincible Connate Divine Art was also known as a Virgin Divine Art. It was the least cultivated among all the Epic stage-capable Primordial Energy Arts.Firstly, Invincible Connate Divine Art could only be cultivated by men. Women who took up slightly more than half of the human population were incapable of cultivating it. Furthermore, with the requirement of being a virgin, even fewer people cultivated in it.No matter how potent the Invincible Connate Divine Art was, to become useless the moment one lost their virginity was a fatal flaw.Of course, the typical person didn\u2019t have the chance to acquire it, so they had no chance of cultivating it even if they wished to.Zhou Wen wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if someone else had cultivated in it, but Li Xuan was a man who found himself swimming amongst women daily. Therefore, it was truly unbelievable that he had managed to master the Invincible Connate Divine Art.Li Xuan didn\u2019t look at the wound on his waist. In fact, due to the compression and suppression of his muscles, the wound had basically stopped bleeding.\u201cDid my second brother send you?\u201d Li Xuan glared at Jiang Hao as he asked. He didn\u2019t wear the blank, ignorant look that Xu Miantu wore.Jiang Hao nodded and said, \u201cI originally thought that it wasn\u2019t necessary for him to take such actions, but from the look of it, your second brother has quite a discerning eye. For you to maintain your virginity, despite swimming in pussy daily, you are truly an incredible genius. You will definitely be a thorn in his side.\u201d\u201cJiang Hao, are you mad? You are actually helping Li Mobai kill Brother Xuan? Do you not know that if Brother Xuan dies here, there will be no way we can answer to Godfather. Don\u2019t forget how much we owe Godfather for his kindness. He also dotes on Brother Xuan the most, so how can you bear to make him sad?\u201d Xu Miantu said as he held his wound.His injury was a lot lighter than Li Xuan\u2019s, but unfortunately, he hadn\u2019t cultivated in the Invincible Connate Divine Art. The blood that he had lost was enough to make his head spin.Jiang Hao ignored Xu Miantu as he gripped his dangers tightly, staring intently at Li Xuan like a ravenous wolf.Xu Miantu still wasn\u2019t done when he was interrupted by Li Xuan. Li Xuan looked at Jiang Hao and said, \u201cI\u2019ve never fought Brother for anything since I was little. To prevent him from second-guessing me, I spent all my time with women and never paid attention to any Li family matters. Yet, he still is unwilling to let me off.\u201d\u201cTwo tigers cannot share one mountain. A family can\u2019t have two heads. If there\u2019s anything to blame, it\u2019s that you only acted like a pig instead of being a real one. Otherwise, none of this would be necessary,\u201d Jiang Hao said.\u201cJiang Hao, do you really believe you can kill me?\u201d Li Xuan said coldly.\u201cBy telling you this much, it shows how determined I am to kill you. Your mastering of the Invincible Connate Divine Art has indeed exceeded my expectations, but unfortunately, you are only at the Mortal stage and have yet to advance to the Legendary stage. Your death is a certainty today,\u201d As Jiang Hao spoke, he tore off his left sleeve, revealing his entire left arm.There was a spiraling blue-green tattoo that nearly covered Jiang Hao\u2019s entire left arm\u2014a coiled snake.The snake tattoo was shimmering with a demonic green-blue glow as though it was alive. Green-blue scales surfaced and enveloped Jiang Hao\u2019s entire left arm and hand, making his arm appear like a bizarre venomous snake exuding extremely uncanny vibes.\u201cExplosive Scaled Snake, a Legendary stage Companion Beast\u2026 Impossible\u2026 You are only at the Mortal stage\u2026 How could you incubate a Legendary stage Companion Beast? Don\u2019t tell me that you have already advanced to the Legendary stage? To reach the Legendary stage at sixteen\u2026 That\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201d Xu Miantu stared at Jiang Hao\u2019s left arm as he exclaimed, a look of horror plastering his face.Jiang Hao shook his head slightly. \u201cI haven\u2019t advanced to the Legendary stage. I\u2019m just capable of using the Explosive Scaled Snake.\u201d\u201cHow is it possible to incubate one without advancing to the Legendary stage? The Primordial Energy needed by an Explosive Scaled Snake is enough to suck dry anyone at the Mortal stage. It\u2019s impossible to incubate one\u2026\u201d Xu Miantu still found it unbelievable.Li Xuan harrumphed and said, \u201cBrother sure went for broke in order to kill me. There\u2019s only one way to possess a Legendary stage Companion Beast at the Mortal stage without incubating it yourself\u2014it\u2019s to let a Legendary stage expert with a Legendary stage Companion Beast transfer it to the person at the Mortal stage, even at the cost of their lives, \u201d\u201cYou are indeed smart. Unfortunately, you will have to die today.\u201d Jiang Hao no longer hesitated as he rushed towards Li Xuan. Meanwhile, his arm that resembled a snake slashed down with the jade dagger.He was exceedingly fast as his snake-like arm seemed to phase away. It was almost impossible for one to use the naked eye to capture its trajectory. As an uncanny green-blue stream of light, it flashed across Li Xuan\u2019s neck.It was at a speed so fast that it even exceeded the Skeleton General\u2019s spear attack. It gave Zhou Wen the impression that Li Xuan was doomed.But to his surprise, he heard a clang. Li Xuan had gripped the lightning-fast jade dagger, holding it right in front of him.Li Xuan\u2019s hand holding the dagger, or perhaps it should be said that most of his body, was enveloped by black iron armor.\u201cBlack Knight, a Legendary stage Companion Beast. So you have also used the same method to obtain a Legendary stage Companion Beast at the Mortal stage. It\u2019s no wonder you held no fear.\u201d Jiang Hao instantly recognized what the black iron armor on the Legendary stage represented.\u201cNo, you are wrong. I don\u2019t have to use such a cruel method to obtain a Legendary Companion Beast. Nor do I have such a need to.\u201d Li Xuan exerted strength, immediately snapping the dagger in his hand and leaving Jiang Hao to retreat rapidly with the remnants of the jade dagger.\u201cThe Invincible Connate Divine Art is the Primordial Energy Art that has the most amount of Primordial Energy amongst its peers. Even though I\u2019m only at the Mortal stage, I still have the chance of incubating a Legendary stage Companion Beast despite them being the weaker ones and me needing to take on some risk. However, it\u2019s more than sufficient when dealing with your Explosive Scaled Snake.\u201d Li Xuan had a sharp glint in his eyes as he approached Jiang Hao.\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder Second Brother views you as a threat. Such talent is indeed terrifying,\u201d Jiang Hao said as he retreated. After saying that, he turned around and ran deep into the Ancient City.Li Xuan didn\u2019t hesitate as he immediately pursued him.\u201cDon\u2019t chase after him!\u201d Zhou Wen hurriedly yelled to stop Li Xuan when he saw Jiang Hao fleeing in the direction of the Skeleton General.However, Li Xuan was bent on killing Jiang Hao. There was no hesitation in his huge strides.The two probably had Speed valued at 8 or 9, making it too late for Zhou Wen to catch up with them. Soon, they vanished around a corner.Zhou Wen slowed down his pace without continuing his pursuit. Instead, it was Xu Miantu who handled the wound on his neck before chasing after them.\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Why aren\u2019t you chasing after them to help Brother Xuan?\u201d Xu Miantu yelled at him when he saw Zhou Wen stop.Zhou Wen held his phone and launched the Ancient Imperial City dungeon as he said to Xu Miantu, \u201cAfter you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cCoward,\u201d Xu Miantu cursed under his breath before ignoring Zhou Wen. He immediately continued his pursuit.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t mind really. He wished to help Li Xuan, but heading over was of zero use.Jiang Hao and Li Xuan had Legendary Companion Beasts, while he had none. Death was a certainty for him when facing the Skeleton General. It was probably more beneficial for him to find the means of dealing with the Skeleton General in-game.The reason Zhou Wen wanted to help Li Xuan was that deep down he knew that Jiang Hao would silence him and Xu Miantu after he had successfully killed Li Xuan to ensure his own safety.Jiang Hao\u2019s attack on Xu Miantu had already revealed this thought of his. If Li Xuan was successfully killed, there was no way he would spare Zhou Wen.Therefore, Zhou Wen was inevitably helping himself by helping Li Xuan.However, any help he rendered was useless. The might of a Legendary Companion Beast was not something he could equal at present. Be it against Jiang Hao or the Skeleton General, the chances of him being killed was extremely high.As Zhou Wen proceeded forward slowly, he controlled the blood-colored avatar and stormed deep into Ancient Imperial City.He didn\u2019t know what kind of developments might happen after Li Xuan and Jiang Hao encountered the Skeleton General; therefore, he needed some preparation.Before encountering the Skeleton General with his blood-colored avatar in-game, he heard a blood-curdling roar coming from deep within the ancient city. \u201cPledge my life to defend the city\u2026 Pledge my life to defend the city\u2026\u201dZhou Wen\u2019s expression changed slightly. This voice was clearly not from Jiang Hao or Li Xuan. However, he had not heard the Skeleton General speak while gaming.With a mere thought, Zhou Wen had composed himself as he continued focusing on his game.His surroundings were unable to influence his line of thought. Soon, the blood-colored avatar found the Skeleton General in-game and after repeated failed attempts, Zhou Wen had a general understanding of the Skeleton General\u2019s strength and Primordial Energy Skill.He knew very well that his strength was insufficient to resist the Skeleton General, especially when it came to Speed. The difference was too disparate, making it difficult for him to even dodge.The Skeleton General is stronger than me in every aspect. There\u2019s a high chance that he\u2019s a dimensional creature at the Legendary stage. It\u2019s definitely impossible for me to fend him off. However, he\u2019s not without flaws. His bone spear is too long, making it unconducive for him to fight in close-range. Furthermore, the skeleton horse he\u2019s sitting on would affect his attack trajectory beneath the waist. This results in an offensive blind spot\u2026 Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar and approached the Skeleton General once again, trying to put theory into practice.When the Skeleton General charged over, Zhou Wen advanced instead of retreating with the blood-colored avatar. With a forward roll, he rushed under the skeleton horse\u2019s belly.Zhou Wen grasped the opportunity perfectly. Despite the Skeleton General having the Strength and Speed, he was unable to attack due to the skeleton horse\u2019s obstruction.After the Skeleton General raised his spear and stabbed downwards again, Zhou Wen had already rolled over to the other side of the skeleton horse\u2019s underside.The skeleton horse was not part of the Skeleton General, making it difficult for them to act perfectly as one. This gave Zhou Wen a slim chance of survival and several possibilities.Unfortunately, the Skeleton General was just too strong. Zhou Wen had to constantly circle around the skeleton horse to avoid being stabbed by the bone spear. He had no means to launch a counterattack.Even so, this lasted less than thirty seconds before the blood-colored avatar was stabbed by the Skeleton General on the ground. Blood immediately splattered as the avatar died on the spot.As he watched the screen go black, Zhou Wen carefully recalled the battle.He soon heard shouts and clashing sounds. Going around a bend, he immediately saw Li Xuan and Jiang Hao fighting each other on the other end of a stone-paved street.And in real life, the Skeleton General was around as well. He wore a cape and the skeleton horse he sat on was tall and mighty, its body akin to jade. The bone spear had terrifying barbs and there were blood-colored flames flickering in the skull\u2019s eye sockets. He looked formidable.This was a completely different existence to the comic-version of the Skeleton General in-game. Zhou Wen nearly failed to recognize him.What left Zhou Wen even more intrigued was that the Skeleton General was charging everywhere with the skeleton horse, but his target was ultimately fixated on Li Xuan. He ignored Jiang Hao, never attacking him even once.Odd. Why would the Skeleton General only be attacking Li Xuan? Seeing the miserable Li Xuan, who kept retreating with his body covered in injuries, Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t help but frown slightly.However, when Zhou Wen\u2019s gaze carefully observed Jiang Hao, he immediately came to a realization.On Jiang Hao, there was an additional bone breastplate. The grayish-white ribs penetrated out of his clothes, protecting his chest and back, making him look odd.From the looks of it, the reason the Skeleton General isn\u2019t attacking Jiang Hao stems from the bone armor he\u2019s wearing. Zhou Wen knew that it was likely a manifestation of a Companion Beast, but the type was unknown to him.Although Xu Miantu had a nasty tongue, he didn\u2019t seem to have a bad character. He rushed over to help Li Xuan when he found the latter in trouble.But the outcome was nothing surprising. Upon clashing, he was sent flying by the Skeleton General, tumbling far away across the street and stopping only when he hit a wall.Xu Miantu bent his back like a shrimp, his hands clasping his abdomen. His mouth was filled with blood and there was cold sweat covering his forehead. The grimace he wore spoke volumes of the pain.\u201cBe patient. Once I kill Li Xuan, I\u2019ll send you off to hell,\u201d Jiang Hao said coldly, as the dagger in his hand stabbed at Li Xuan\u2019s vital spot.Li Xuan was fighting two adversaries alone, and he wasn\u2019t even at the Legendary stage. By relying solely on the Legendary Black Knight Companion Beast, it was taxing on him to hold out in battle. The black armor that encased him was damaged in multiple places and blood seeped through.However, he was a tenacious person. Despite such a perilous situation, he was still able to maintain clarity in thought and avoided most of the lethal strikes.Unfortunately, he just wasn\u2019t a Legendary stage expert. He was already a stage lower than the Skeleton General and with Jiang Hao taking opportunistic jabs at him, every second placed him in extreme peril. If not for the potent defensive capabilities of his Black Knight armor and the Invincible Connate Divine Art\u2019s ability to slow down the deterioration of his injuries, he would have long been killed.After watching for a moment, Zhou Wen suddenly shouted at Li Xuan, \u201cLi Xuan, if I can help you distract the Skeleton General, how long will it take for you to finish off Jiang Hao?\u201dZhou Wen\u2019s words shocked the trio. In this battle, it was no longer something that a person at the Mortal stage could interfere in, much less that of a regular high-schooler.Xu Miantu imagined that Zhou Wen was mad, but unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have the energy to say a word. Otherwise, he would definitely have ridiculed Zhou Wen.Jiang Hao didn\u2019t share the same thoughts, he didn\u2019t believe Zhou Wen was capable of the proclaimed feat. He believed that Zhou Wen would be sending himself to his death if he really rushed over to help Li Xuan.\u201cTwo minutes. I need that much time,\u201d Li Xuan said as he fought for his life. There was no hesitation in his voice.\u201cAlright. Then, I\u2019ll give you two minutes.\u201d Zhou Wen put away his phone and headed for the battlefield.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen picked up his pace and entered the battlefield in a most ingenious manner, appearing behind the Skeleton General.The Skeleton General keenly noticed Zhou Wen\u2019s appearance and gave up attacking Li Xuan. It struck backward, transforming the bone spear into a cold beam that stabbed at Zhou Wen\u2019s head.Without waiting for the Skeleton General to raise his spear, Zhou Wen crouched down and lunged for the underside of the skeleton horse. This prevented the bone spear from locking onto him; thus, resolving the Skeleton General\u2019s thrust.Xu Miantu struggled to his feet as he looked at Zhou Wen with a look of disbelief. Zhou Wen had actually managed to hold back the Skeleton General!Zhou Wen oscillated between the skeleton horse\u2019s sides, occasionally tumbling to the ground. It looked extremely pathetic, but his actions worked.Xu Miantu knew how difficult it was. He had the same idea as Zhou Wen earlier, hoping to hold back the Skeleton General to give Li Xuan time to finish off Jiang Hao.However, he had been swept away the moment he approached the Skeleton General and nearly died from severe injuries. It made him deeply realize the huge differences between the Mortal stage and the Legendary stage.Zhou Wen was likewise at the Mortal stage, but he had managed to hold back the Skeleton General. It might look pathetic, but he remained unharmed the entire time. It left Xu Miantu amazed.Thinking back to his mockery of Zhou Wen, his originally pale face blushed an abnormal red.Jiang Hao was alarmed to see Zhou Wen hold back the Skeleton General. Despite all his plans, he had never expected a Mortal stage high-schooler to be capable of holding back a Legendary Skeleton General.In fact, Jiang Hao long knew of the existence of the Skeleton General in the vicinity. He had planned on taking Li Xuan nearby and letting the Skeleton General finish him off.Unfortunately, this plan had been foiled by Zhou Wen. Jiang Hao had no choice but to take action himself, but he ultimately failed.While Zhou Wen was holding back the Skeleton General, Li Xuan had already rushed towards Jiang Hao. He unleashed a barrage of punches that shimmered like shooting stars at him.He knew that it wasn\u2019t pragmatic to expect a Mortal stage hold back the Skeleton General for extended periods of time. He had to finish off Jiang Hao before Zhou Wen was killed by the Skeleton General.Jiang Hao now truly realized how terrifying this intemperate scion, Li Xuan, was. Despite using similar Legendary Companion Beasts\u2014even with him having two\u2014he was still completely overpowered by Li Xuan.\u201cI don\u2019t believe I can\u2019t last two minutes. We are both at the Mortal stage and are using Legendary Companion Beasts!\u201d Jiang Hao battled Li Xuan with gritted teeth.Bang!In less than twenty seconds, Jiang Hao was hit on the left elbow by Li Xuan, snapping the bone armor in two.The color in Jiang Hao\u2019s face drained as he rapidly retreated. However, upon seeing Li Xuan pursue him like a leech, his eyes flashed with a ruthless glint. With a swing of his left arm, the Explosive Scaled Snake tattoo shimmered as a brightly-colored blue-green venomous snake tore out from his arm, coiling towards the pursuing Li Xuan.Seizing this opportunity, Jiang Hao pushed his speed to the limit, allowing him to traverse four to five meters. He was attacking Zhou Wen from behind with a dagger!\u201cAh!\u201d This sudden development caused Xu Miantu to cry out.Zhou Wen was already in a perilous situation while holding back the Skeleton General. Now, with Jiang Hao sneaking an attack on him, death seemed inevitable for him.Li Xuan was alarmed and furious as well. However, with the Explosive Scaled Snake blocking him, he didn\u2019t have the time to rescue Zhou Wen.While the bone spear thrust around at lightning speed, a dagger stabbed at Zhou Wen\u2019s waist from the back. At this critical moment, Zhou Wen exerted strength into his legs, allowing him to do a sharp turn. A powerful twisting force erupted from his waist muscles as his body twisted at an odd angle.Zhou Wen\u2019s feet were still facing the Skeleton General\u2019s side, but his torso had already turned to face Jiang Hao.The bone spear stabbed at Zhou Wen, just brushed past his cheek. This left a faint wound on Zhou Wen\u2019s cheek, but he remained stoic. Without even blinking, he threw a punch at Jiang Hao\u2019s dagger.A look of mockery flashed in Jiang Hao\u2019s eyes. Although the Explosive Scaled Snake had left his body, he still had the bone breastplate protecting him. It was also a Legendary Companion Beast and, although it wasn\u2019t a Strength-type, it augmented his Strength a little. It wasn\u2019t something a typical Mortal stage human could withstand.Furthermore, the jade dagger was made of special materials. Not only did it have the ability to kill dimensional creatures, but it also had a terrifying sharpness to it.\u201cDie!\u201d Jiang Hao steeled his heart as he exerted all his Strength, gathering it at the blade tip. He wanted to slice through Zhou Wen\u2019s fingers.\u201cDodge! You can\u2019t handle it!\u201d Li Xuan cried out in panic.Xu Miantu spewed another mouthful of blood\u2014a result of his anxiety, not his injuries.At the instant the fist and blade met, a sanguine glow shimmered across Zhou Wen\u2019s fist. The red carapace instantly wrapped around his fist, condensing like a dark red boxing glove.\u201cCompanion Beast!\u201d Jiang Hao\u2019s eyes constricted as an ominous feeling arose in him.As Mortal stage Companion Beasts were rare, he had subconsciously imagined the Companion Beast to be at the Legendary stage. This alarmed him greatly.However, the distance between the fist and blade was just too narrow. Just as the thought came to Jiang Hao, Zhou Wen\u2019s fist had already struck the blade of the jade dagger.Crack!The mighty force tore through the blade as cracks rapidly extended, shattering the entire dagger, turning them into countless fragments.Bang!Zhou Wen\u2019s punch didn\u2019t pause as it struck Jiang Hao\u2019s dagger-wielding fist. It smashed the bones in his hand and arm.The fractured bone tore out of Jiang Hao\u2019s flesh as blood gushed out. Without the protection of the bone armor, his arm popped like popcorn. He flew out with a tragic cry.All of this happened in a split second. As Xu Miantu watched, he glared with a wide-open mouth, momentarily speechless.Li Xuan was thrilled. Ignoring the Explosive Scaled Snake that embroiled him, he charged forward and smashed open Jiang Hao\u2019s head in midair. There were no more chances for him.Zhou Wen was calm. After destroying Jiang Hao\u2019s arm, his body twisted around like a loach and, using the momentum, lunged for the skeleton horse\u2019s back. This made the Skeleton General miss once more.Everything happened with such fluidity, as though it had been practiced countless times. It was a beautiful sight.\u201cWho the hell is he?\u201d Xu Miantu snapped to his senses as his mind was filled with puzzlement. He refused to believe that Zhou Wen was merely an ordinary high-schooler from Guide City.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJiang Hao\u2019s death signified the dissipation of his Companion Beast. The Explosive Scaled Snake and the bone armor Companion Beasts exploded, turning into bits of Primordial Energy that scattered across the land.Li Xuan didn\u2019t have the luxury of time to entertain nonsensical thoughts like Xu Miantu. After finishing Jiang Hao, he rushed straight for the Skeleton General. At the same time, he shouted, \u201cZhou Wen, I\u2019ll attract his attention. Try to find an opening to deliver the lethal strike.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhou Wen retreated. Just as the Skeleton General was about to chase after him, Li Xuan had already delivered a punch to the skeleton horse\u2019s head.This contained the Strength of a Black Knight, but all it did was cause the skeleton horse\u2019s head to flinch and its feet to stagger for a moment.\u201cPledge my life to defend the city\u2026\u201d The Skeleton General was enraged as the glow in his eyes burgeoned. He let out a furious roar as he charged at Li Xuan with his spear.Li Xuan could barely kite the Skeleton General with the Black Knight\u2019s powers, but he was completely suppressed. He had no means to counterattack.Zhou Wen circled around the skeleton horse without giving the Skeleton General a chance to attack him. From time to time, he would deliver a Vigor Divine Fist at the horse\u2019s legs or body. It affected the skeleton horse\u2019s mobility, giving Li Xuan a breather.The two besieged the Skeleton General, but everything remained in a tizzy.The Skeleton General in-game doesn\u2019t seem this powerful? Zhou Wen was quite puzzled. He was certain of his judgment.It wasn\u2019t only aspects like Strength or Speed, most importantly, the Skeleton General in-game was rather uniform in his attacks. It was obvious he was a NPC 1 in a game. But in real life, the Skeleton General was clearly more intelligent and autonomous than in-game. His combat experience seemed to be honed from multiple battles, making him completely different.Zhou Wen hadn\u2019t seen this phenomenon on the ordinary Skeleton Soldiers. Be it in-game or in real life, the Skeleton Soldiers shared the same rigidness.What\u2019s the reason? Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to figure out the reason.Bang!Li Xuan was sent flying by the Skeleton General\u2019s spear sweep, but he managed to stop himself after tumbling about eight meters.He got to his feet and charged forward once again while enduring the pain. Meanwhile, he shouted, \u201cThis Skeleton General is a little odd. He appears to be getting stronger!\u201dIf any other Mortal stage were to suffer such injuries, they would probably be dead, even if they had a Legendary Companion Beast protecting them.However, Li Xuan\u2019s Invincible Connate Divine Art was indeed formidable. It allowed him to continue battling with full force.Zhou Wen had heard of how potent Epic stage Primordial Energy Arts were in the past, but it was only today that he realized how disparate things were.The Ascetic Meditation he cultivated had similar benefits to the Invincible Connate Divine Art. They were Primordial Energy Arts that strengthened one\u2019s Constitution, but the differences were huge when a comparison was made. If he had suffered injuries as terrible as Li Xuan\u2019s, it would be unlikely that he could get back on his feet.As expected, I need to cultivate in a top-grade Primordial Energy Art. But where am I to get one? These things aren\u2019t like Primordial Energy Skills that can drop from the game. Zhou Wen was slightly vexed.In the schools of Earth\u2019s League, especially in university, different Primordial Energy Arts would be taught. However, they were capped out at the Legendary stage. There weren\u2019t any Epic stage Primordial Energy Arts to be taught. Zhou Wen had no chance of cultivating in such Primordial Energy Arts even if he wanted to.\u201cBro, stop daydreaming. Help me finish him quickly!\u201d Li Xuan was running about yelling while being pursued by the Skeleton General. The black armor that encased him had nearly shattered.Zhou Wen had no intention of helping. Instead, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s useless. My Strength isn\u2019t enough to injure it. I think it\u2019s better we flee.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have a weaponized Companion Beast?\u201d Li Xuan exclaimed.\u201cIt\u2019s only a Mortal Companion Beast. Although the augmentation to Strength is great, it wouldn\u2019t be very effective against such a Legendary stage dimensional creature,\u201d Zhou Wen explained.\u201cMortal Companion Beast?\u201d Li Xuan immediately felt speechless.The higher the grade of a dimensional creature, the easier it could condense a dimensional crystal. The chances of producing a Companion Egg was also higher. Therefore, it was the low-grade dimensional creatures that could hardly produce Companion Eggs.Therefore, a Mortal Companion Beast could be more expensive than his Black Knight Legendary Companion Beast, but at this juncture, money meant nothing.\u201cThat\u2019s bad. Although my Black Knight also augments my Strength, it mainly augments my defense. It\u2019s not great when it comes to Strength\u2026 Damn it\u2026 I should have learned a few Primordial Energy Skills with potent destructive forces\u2026 Or I should have incubated a Strength-type Legendary Companion Beast\u2026\u201d Li Xuan said in regret.\u201cIf not for your black armor protecting you, you would have died a couple of times. Having a Strength-type Legendary Companion Beast is useless,\u201d Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.Li Xuan no longer had the time to chat with Zhou Wen for the Skeleton General almost stabbed him in his thigh.The Black Knight Companion Beast didn\u2019t enhance his Speed, so Li Xuan was unable to dodge the Skeleton General\u2019s thrusts. All he could do was rely on the black armor to resist the blows. It seemed quite tragic for it appeared as though he would be stabbed to death at any time.The skeleton horse was too fast and, with Li Xuan not being at the Legendary stage, there was no way of escaping.\u201cZhou Wen, I beg you to save Brother Xuan.\u201d Xu Miantu struggled to get up as he pleaded with Zhou Wen.At this moment, Xu Miantu no longer had the arrogance from before. Instead, he treated Zhou Wen as a pillar of support.Deep down, he no longer treated Zhou Wen as a higher schooler from a small city. Just the Mortal Companion Beast was not something the typical person could possess. From his point of view, Zhou Wen definitely had an extraordinary background.And his previous actions made Xu Miantu believe that the former could save Li Xuan if he so wished.Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not completely impossible, but I\u2019m not sure if it will work.\u201d\u201cWe have to try it regardless,\u201d Xu Miantu said.Zhou Wen nodded slightly as he observed the Skeleton General but was thinking about the Skeleton General in-game.He had fought the Skeleton General several times in-game. It wasn\u2019t without any benefit because through his observations, he had noticed a weakness on the Skeleton General.However, Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t certain if the weakness in-game was the same in real life. After all, the Skeleton General was a lot more powerful in real life.But at this moment, Zhou Wen could only give it a try.Seeing Li Xuan being pursued by the Skeleton General, Zhou Wen silently circled to the back and gradually approached to await an opportunity.Without needing Zhou Wen to say a word, Li Xuan knew that he needed to create a window of opportunity for Zhou Wen. Li Xuan gritted his teeth and used his black armor to envelope the left area of his abdomen to take on the Skeleton General\u2019s thrust.When the sharp tip plunged into the black armor, it ripped apart Li Xuan\u2019s flesh. However, before the spear could be retracted, he gripped the stone spear tightly.Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen leaped up and jumped onto the Skeleton General\u2019s back. He rode on the skeleton horse just like the Skeleton General while reaching out his hand at his target\u2019s neck. Lodging the head up to the sky, he used his other hand which wore the Vigor Ant\u2019s boxing glove, slamming it heavily at the Skeleton General\u2019s eye sockets.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBang!With the combined forces of Vigor Divine Fist and the Vigor boxing glove, the Skeleton General\u2019s eye sockets cracked as Zhou Wen\u2019s fist plunged straight in. The sanguine flame scattered immediately like splattering blood.The Skeleton General, who had been retracting the spear with all his might, came to an abrupt halt. The next moment the bone spear fell to the ground, as all his bones scattered around him. Even the skeleton horse crumbled to a pile of rotting bones.And inside the skull which Zhou Wen had collapsed, there was a slight red glow.Zhou Wen flipped the skull around and saw the red Companion Egg. It was the size of a goose egg, its entire body crystalline, like jade. Blood flames seemed to burn in it.\u201cA Companion Egg? Your luck ain\u2019t bad. Unfortunately, you don\u2019t have enough Primordial Energy to incubate a Legendary Companion Egg. Besides, that Skeleton General was a little odd. It\u2019s best you don\u2019t incubate it randomly.\u201d Li Xuan was covered with wounds, but regardless of their sizes, they were beginning to close up and stop bleeding. It was clearly thanks to the Invincible Connate Divine Art.\u201cDon\u2019t you want it?\u201d Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan.Li Xuan shook his head. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, Miantu and I would be dead. Also, what use is a Companion Egg? Besides, I don\u2019t really take a mere Legendary Companion Egg to heart. You should take it for yourself.\u201dZhou Wen nodded without any intention of standing on ceremony. He directly stuffed the Skeleton General\u2019s Companion Egg into his pocket before looking at Jiang Hao, whose head had ruptured. \u201cJiang Hao deserved this, but his death will definitely affect our results. It will probably be difficult for us to get into a reputable school.\u201dLi Xuan laughed when he heard that. \u201cRest easy. Once we leave, apply to any reputable school you like. I guarantee you your admission..\u201dXu Miantu suffered grievous injuries and, although Li Xuan\u2019s wounds didn\u2019t worsen, they weren\u2019t trivial either. He was also in need of medical attention. The trio stopped hunting Skeleton Soldiers and left Guide Ancient City directly after gathering all the bone beads.After the invigilator inspected the number of bone beads and dimensional crystals, he sent Li Xuan and Xu Miantu for treatment. As for Zhou Wen, he headed home alone on public transport.On the way back, he used his phone to enter the Ancient Imperial City dungeon once more. He wanted to confirm that the Skeleton General in-game was weaker than the one in real life.As expected. It\u2019s not an illusion of mine. The Skeleton General in-game is much weaker. It\u2019s no wonder I suspected that he wasn\u2019t a Legendary creature.But even so, without Li Xuan to divert the Skeleton General\u2019s attention, Zhou Wen was only capable of circling around the Skeleton General in-game. Killing him by his strength alone was almost impossible. The blood-colored avatar that Zhou Wen controlled had zero chance of getting close enough to smash through the Skeleton General\u2019s eye sockets.However, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t mind. He continued circling around the Skeleton General with the blood-colored avatar. Since Zhou Wen knew the Skeleton General\u2019s weakness, a solo-kill was just a matter of time. He just needed to do the best he could.Back home, Zhou Wen continued his daily lifestyle. Apart from sleeping, he would be gaming even while eating or using the bathroom.After repeated attempts, he finally relied on a perfect positioning to kill the Skeleton General.Although the Skeleton General in-game didn\u2019t drop a Companion Egg, it gave Zhou Wen a pleasant surprise\u2014a Speed Crystal valued at 13.Zhou Wen absorbed the Speed Crystal and immediately felt a jolt run through his body. It made him feel as if he was on cloud nine.After a while, the feeling gradually dissipated. When Zhou Wen looked at his in-game stats, he was stunned.He had absorbed a Speed Crystal valued at 13, so logically speaking, his Speed should have risen to 13. However, his Speed had only increased to 9, much lower than he expected.After some thought, Zhou Wen roughly understood why this was happening.I was taught that although the effects of absorbing Legendary stage crystals are good at the Mortal stage, that doesn\u2019t allow one\u2019s body to rise to the level of a Legendary stage. Only by raising one\u2019s Primordial Energy Art to a new realm would the absorption of a Legendary stage dimensional crystal raise one\u2019s stats. From the looks of it, this is the reason. Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t help but frown when he thought of this.He originally intended on relying on Ascetic Meditation to advance to the Legendary stage, but after witnessing how formidable the Invincible Connate Divine Art was, it was apparent to him that advancing to the Legendary stage with Ascetic Meditation wasn\u2019t the best choice.But if I don\u2019t use Ascetic Meditation to advance to the Legendary stage, how am I to obtain an Epic stage Primordial Energy Art? Zhou Wen was at a loss.\u2026A few days later, the examination results were announced. Zhou Wen\u2019s results in his various subjects put him amongst the top. He got second on the combat test, one spot below Li Xuan. He was ranked even higher than Xu Miantu, so it did seem that Jiang Hao\u2019s death hadn\u2019t affected his results.While pondering over the matter, his phone suddenly rang. It was an unknown number.Picking up the call, Li Xuan\u2019s voice sounded over the phone. \u201cZhou Wen, have you seen the results? I should have given you first place, but I have some special use for being first place. So please forgive my shamelessness in taking first. I\u2019ll make sure to compensate you in the future.\u201d\u201cWe agreed on being fourth, so getting second is good enough. I don\u2019t really care for my placing as long as it doesn\u2019t affect my university enrollment.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about that. I owe you one, so I have to repay you one day.\u201d Li Xuan paused before continuing, \u201cI\u2019ll be studying at Sunset College in the future. Are you interested in joining me there? We can take care of one another as friends.\u201d\u201cSunset College?\u201d Zhou Wen revealed a pensive look.Sunset College was one of the top schools in the East District of the League. At the very least, it was ranked within the top ten. And there were dimensional zones inside Sunset College; therefore, students of Sunset College could enter them during their college years for actual combat. This was a boon compared to the typical university.Entering Sunset College wasn\u2019t a bad choice. The only thing that held Zhou Wen back was that Sunset College was located in Luoyang City and the An family was in Luoyang as well.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t wish to have close ties with the An family; thus, leaving him hesitant about choosing Sunset College.Li Xuan did his best to persuade Zhou Wen to attend Sunset College, but all Zhou Wen said was that he would consider it.After hanging up, Zhou Wen recalled something. An Jing had given him a USB drive, claiming that it was given to him by Zhou Lingfeng. Zhou Wen had been spending the past few days trying to take down the Skeleton General, so he had forgotten all about it. He had no idea what was on it.After finding the USB drive, he inserted it into his computer and opened it. There was only one folder in it, labeled\u2014Sun Strafe Art.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen was slightly alarmed. He had heard of Sun Strafe Art. It was a Primordial Energy Art that reached the Epic stage and was in no way inferior to the Invincible Connate Divine Art when it came to fame. However, in comparison, the Sun Strafe Art was far more precious.After all, the Invincible Connate Divine Art\u2019s cultivation requirements were excessively harsh. In contrast, the Sun Strafe Art didn\u2019t have that many requirements. As long as one was willing to work hard at it, even the most mediocre person could attain certain levels of achievement.Furthermore, Sun Strafe Art was an extremely potent offensive Primordial Energy Art. It was far more popular than the Invincible Connate Divine Art that only strengthened one\u2019s Constitution.However, based on what Zhou Wen knew, the Sun Strafe Art was an exclusive Primordial Energy Art of some bigwig in the League. Apart from this bigwig\u2019s descendants, no one else had the chance of obtaining it.How did Dad get the Sun Strafe Art? It\u2019s most likely obtained thanks to the An family, right? Zhou Wen had a guess in mind.He didn\u2019t reject the Sun Strafe Art because of this guess. Since Zhou Lingfeng had given it to him, he must have paid the corresponding price even if it was thanks to the An family. Zhou Wen naturally didn\u2019t have any reason to reject it and couldn\u2019t ignore Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s well-meant intentions.After all, the number of things that Zhou Lingfeng had given him since he was young\u2014apart from his living allowance\u2014was limited to a handful.He actually remembers that he has a son. Zhou Wen didn\u2019t immediately look at the Sun Strafe Art. Switching off his computer, he pulled out the USB disk and prepared to get some food.Cultivating a Primordial Energy Art wasn\u2019t something that could be done in a day. Even though he had a 9-valued Primordial Energy as a foundation, making it faster for him to cultivate other Primordial Energy Arts, it still wasn\u2019t something that could be mastered in a month or two. There wasn\u2019t any rush.Opening the fridge, he found nothing inside. Looking at the cardboard boxes in the corner of the living room, there wasn\u2019t a single packet of instant noodles left.Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment and gave up the thought of getting a delivery. He washed his face, changed his clothes, and prepared to head out to get something to eat. He could also buy some food to stock up on the way.At almost nine in the evening, there weren\u2019t many pedestrians on the street.Zhou Wen had heard from his grandfather when he was young that before the dimensional storms happened, even a small city like Guide City was lit up for the entire night. However, such scenes were very rare these days.The dim street lamps left Zhou Wen a little uncomfortable. His anemia was also getting worse.He had lost too much blood recently. Thankfully, he was young and sufficiently strong. If he were an elderly man, the amount of blood he expended was definitely something his body\u2019s self-replenishment wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with. Things would have deteriorated much earlier.\u201cI\u2019ll head to the supermarket to buy some brown sugar and make it into a syrup for drinking. Let\u2019s hope this old wives\u2019 tale can help in replenishing my blood,\u201d Zhou Wen muttered to himself.He also knew, deep down, that it wasn\u2019t going to be of much use. Even if he visited the doctor, it was unlikely to resolve the problem.The only way to resolve the excessive loss of blood was to prevent his blood-colored avatar from dying frequently in-game. As long as it didn\u2019t die, he wouldn\u2019t need to waste his blood.Cough! As Zhou Wen was walking, he heard a man cough in front of him. Looking up, he saw an elderly man walking over with a hunched back. He had his head bowed, holding one hand to his mouth as he coughed from time to time.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t think too much of it as he continued proceeding forward. But to his surprise, the elderly man collapsed to the ground when he was less than three meters away from him.\u201cUncle, are you alright?\u201d Zhou Wen walked over to check on the elder.The elder seemed weak as he sat on the ground without getting up. He said feebly, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Old age is getting at me. I\u2019ll be fine after resting for a while.\u201d\u201cLet me help you to the side.\u201d Zhou Wen saw that there was a bus stop nearby which had benches for commuters to sit on.With the elder nodding, Zhou Wen reached out, held him by the arm and helped him to the bench.He observed the elder from the side and guessed that he was in his seventies to eighties. His hair was gray and his face was covered in wrinkles. However, from his thin face and facial features, this elder had probably been a handsome man in his prime.Zhou Wen felt some pity for him. An elder at this age was truly from the most tragic generation.When the dimensional storms descended upon the world, it created pandemonium. That decade or two was the most chaotic and darkest period of human history.And the source of this chaos wasn\u2019t the terrifying dimensional creatures, but humanity itself.Most dimensional creatures were unable to leave the dimensional zones; therefore excluding those zones, humans in the other zones weren\u2019t in too much danger.However, when humans realized that they could have superpowers with the help of dimensional crystals, those who obtained these powers revealed the darkest side of humanity.In this dark era, many vile and ambitious people who struck fear into people were produced. The number of deaths that arose among humanity\u2019s infighting could be said to be awash with rivers of blood.At the elder\u2019s age, he was a person who had survived the dark era but he was also beyond his prime for cultivation during the same period. Back then, there weren\u2019t any systematic education or resources available. Most men his age had never cultivated. And even if they did, their achievements were extremely limited.To be lucky enough to not die in that dark and chaotic era and live to this day wasn\u2019t something worth being happy about either.Humans nowadays who cultivated from a young age not only had a strong immune system that made them less prone to falling sick, but the speed at which they aged was reduced. They also experienced an extension of their lifespan, something incomparable for the elder from that era.Now, most people in their forties and fifties looked no different from the twenties or thirties of yesteryear.Even if one grew old in the future, they wouldn\u2019t be so frail like this elder in front of him.\u201cUncle, if you\u2019re fine, I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201d Seeing how the elder\u2019s condition had improved, Zhou Wen planned on leaving.\u201cLad, it\u2019s a lucky coincidence that we meet other. Why don\u2019t you have a chat with me?\u201d the elder looked at Zhou Wen with his turbid eyes as he spoke with his feeble voice.\u201cI\u2019m not good at chatting.\u201d Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t declining the elder\u2019s request. He really wasn\u2019t good at chatting.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Let me ask you a few questions.\u201d The elder smiled, only to break into a coughing fit a moment later.\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Zhou Wen said and stood in front of the bench.He usually only gamed and seldom communicated with people. Therefore, it didn\u2019t seem like a bad thing to have someone willing to chat with him.Of course, this was under the premise that the elder didn\u2019t ask questions that stumped Zhou Wen.\u201cDo you like women with big or small breasts?\u201d The elder\u2019s question left Zhou Wen taken aback.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen was still a pure and innocent virgin who had never been in a relationship before. Furthermore, always being focused on cultivation, he had never considered this problem.The elder\u2019s question was somewhat odd, but Zhou Wen answered after some serious thought, \u201cWomen with smaller breasts.\u201dThe elder was delighted to hear that as he said with a smile, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I think too. Only women with smaller breasts are beautiful. What\u2019s so nice about big-breasted women? They are no different from cows. Only babies who still suck on their mother\u2019s tit will like cows.\u201dAlthough Zhou Wen didn\u2019t agree with the elder, he didn\u2019t think it worth arguing with him. He chose women with smaller breasts because having big breasts made it unsuitable for combat. It would affect one\u2019s sense of balance.The elder\u2019s complexion seemed a lot better once he broached the topic of women. He continued asking in excitement, \u201cLad, let me ask you another question. Do you like gentle women who are docile and obedient or women who are shrewd and unreasonable?\u201dThis old man sure is odd. Does he have a screw loose? Who wouldn\u2019t like a docile and obedient woman and instead like an unreasonable shrewd?Zhou Wen had the intention of answering that he preferred docile women, but he felt that choosing this would only excite the elder even more. There would then be no end to the conversation. Besides, Zhou Wen had no interest in continuing his chat with the elder.\u201cI like shrewd and unreasonable women,\u201d Zhou Wen swallowed the words he wanted to say and spoke against his will.To his surprise, the elder smacked his thigh before Zhou Wen could even finish his sentence. He said in great excitement, \u201cNot bad! Not bad! It\u2019s only when women are shrewd and unreasonable that they are cute and fun. Those docile and obedient women are no different from dead fish. What\u2019s so fun about that? I never expected a young lad like you would have such refined taste in women\u2026\u201dThe way the elder treated Zhou Wen as though he was a confidant left him bewildered. He was momentarily at a loss for words.He\u2019s a lunatic indeed. Zhou Wen was increasingly convinced that the elder wasn\u2019t mentally sound. Otherwise, how could he have said such inane stuff?If Zhou Wen had chosen honestly, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have chosen unreasonable shrewd women.\u201cUncle, where do you live? Do you need me to take you home?\u201d Zhou Wen really didn\u2019t want to be caught up here. All he wanted was to send the elder off and find somewhere to eat so that he could return to his gaming.The elder ignored Zhou Wen and continued rambling, \u201cLad, you have exquisite taste when it comes to women. You are a genius. However, you don\u2019t look good and your body condition isn\u2019t great. One\u2019s body is crucial when hitting on chicks. If you don\u2019t have a good body, you will be lacking in the strength needed, despite having good taste\u2026\u201dWhat the hell? You call this good taste? Zhou Wen regretted agreeing to the elder\u2019s request for a chat.Having said that, the elder groped around before pulling out a tattered diary. \u201cYou are quite a fine lad and are rather compatible with me. Written in here is a Primordial Energy Art. If you cultivate it, it will be beneficial for you. As long as you can master it, you will have the strength to deal with any problematic women in the future.\u201dA dark cloud hovered over Zhou Wen. The elder seemed to be implying that the cultivation of Primordial Energy Arts was meant to deal with unreasonable shrewd women.\u201cUncle, thanks for the offer. However, I\u2019ve already cultivated in a Primordial Energy Art. I don\u2019t need any others.\u201d Zhou Wen already had the Sun Strafe Art, so he naturally wasn\u2019t very interested in other Primordial Energy Arts. Furthermore, he doubted that the elder\u2019s Primordial Energy Art was anything impressive.The elder glanced at Zhou Wen and said in contempt, \u201cAlthough this Skyfiend Treatise isn\u2019t a top-grade Primordial Energy Art, it\u2019s not anything your crappy one can compare with. Useless Primordial Energy Arts like Ascetic Meditation are meant for trash. You are a lad with exquisite taste. You shouldn\u2019t be cultivating in such a trashy Primordial Energy Art.\u201d\u201cHow do you know I cultivate in Ascetic Meditation?\u201d Zhou Wen was alarmed.The elder curled his lips. \u201cAlthough you don\u2019t look well, there\u2019s a yellow jade-like luster suffusing your skin and flesh. Your eyes are spirited and your bones are huge. Clear signs of cultivating Ascetic Meditation. However, it\u2019s also at the beginner level. It\u2019s good that you are still a beginner; otherwise, cultivating such a trashy Primordial Energy Art would have been a waste of your youth. It would have ruined your entire life.\u201dZhou Wen sized up the elder. He hadn\u2019t noticed before that this sickly old man was so keen.As though reading his mind, the elder said, \u201cDazed? This Skyfiend Treatise is hundreds if not thousands of times better than Ascetic Meditation. It\u2019s stronger than any Epic stage Primordial Energy Art at present. As long as you master it, you would definitely amount to much in the future. Although it wouldn\u2019t make you invincible, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for you to advance to the Epic stage.\u201d\u201cThank you. I can\u2019t accept something this valuable from a stranger. I\u2019m very grateful for your kind intentions, but if there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll be making a move now.\u201d Zhou Wen didn\u2019t know about the authenticity of the elder\u2019s Skyfiend Treatise for he had never heard of such an Epic stage Primordial Energy Art.Regardless if it was one, Zhou Wen already had the Sun Strafe Art. There was no need for him to cultivate in the Skyfiend Treatise of unknown origins.With that said, Zhou Wen turned around as he prepared to leave. With the elder\u2019s queer actions, he didn\u2019t wish to attract more trouble. It was best he left as soon as possible.\u201cStop right there.\u201d Just as Zhou Wen turned around, he heard the elder\u2019s cold bellow.Zhou Wen wanted to ignore him and leave, but just as he opened his stride, he felt as though his body was being grabbed by a huge invisible hand. It yanked him back, turning him around to face the elder.The elder\u2019s turbid eyes were shimmering with a fearsome glint that resembled light bulbs.He sat on the bench as he coughed slightly with his hand over his mouth. However, Zhou Wen could only stand motionless in front of the elder due to the invisible hand.\u201cI, Jing Daoxian, have reigned supreme for decades and no one has ever lived to say no to me.\u201d The elder glared at Zhou Wen as he spoke coldly.He found the words \u201cJing Daoxian\u201d familiar; however, it was only when he matched this name to a memory did his expression change drastically.When the dimensional storms first happened\u2014in the period before the League government was established when it was the most chaotic period in human history\u2014there had been a vile and bloodthirsty people. The most terrifying and evil of them all was named Jing Daoxian.The legends of Jing Daoxian\u2019s cruelty was enough for a novelist to write an epic tale, spanning ten million words or more.Jing Daoxian was most infamous for storming the League government\u2019s office, killing twenty-seven Epic experts. The rest of the lower-stage experts were too numerous to count. He had turned what represented the highest authority of the League into a river of blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMany of the history books in the League had depicted that battle, the Day of the Fiendish Calamity. As for Jing Daoxian, he had the nickname of Fiend King. The number of Epic experts back then weren\u2019t as numerous as the number these days, so to kill twenty-seven Epic experts basically meant slaughtering most of humanity\u2019s strongest experts. It set back humanity\u2019s strength by at least ten years.Zhou Wen stared at the elder in front of him, finding it difficult to put this sickly old man with the terrifying Fiend King of legends.\u201cYou are Fiend King Jing Daoxian?\u201d Zhou Wen didn\u2019t feel horrified because of his restrainment. This was because he knew very well that it didn\u2019t make a difference.\u201cDo you now want it?\u201d Jing Daoxian said to Zhou Wen with a faint smile.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhou Wen didn\u2019t hesitate in answering for he had no intention of dying at the hands of this devil.When Jing Daoxian heard Zhou Wen\u2019s reply, he narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cYou may say so, but you don\u2019t want it deep down. Even if you take it, I\u2019m afraid you wouldn\u2019t cultivate in it.\u201dIs this guy nuts? Zhou Wen thought. \u201cI\u2019m naturally not going to cultivate in it. If that Skyfiend Treatise is really a Primordial Energy Art of yours, wouldn\u2019t the League\u2019s government believe that I\u2019m related to you if I were to master it? I would also be wanted.\u201dJing Daoxian fell silent for a moment before his eyes lit up as though he had thought of something. Putting the notebook away, he took out something else.It was a violet, metal box that resembled copper. However, it didn\u2019t have the luster of copper with its dark, brushed-metal texture.Looking small and exquisite, the metal box was squarish, about the size of a cigarette case. Carved on it were strange and messy patterns with three words written vertically in the middle.\u201cLost Immortal Sutra!\u201d Zhou Wen recognized the three words but didn\u2019t understand what they meant.The elder held the tiny box in front of Zhou Wen before lifting the lid. At this moment, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn\u2019t a box but pieces of violet metal sheets that were connected to one another. They were like violet metal name cards.There was a total of thirteen extremely thin, violet sheets. Each one was engraved with words the size of a fly\u2019s head. Due to the tiny text, Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t able to read the words on them.Jing Daoxian didn\u2019t look at the words on them. After opening it, all he did was wave the sheets in front of Zhou Wen before stacking them back together, turning them back into the violet metal block that resembled a cigarette case. Finally, he stuffed it into Zhou Wen\u2019s hands.\u201cA Primordial Energy Art is written on it. It\u2019s rather interesting, so take your time to cultivate it.\u201d Jing Daoxian gave an odd smile, revealing his white teeth. It gave Zhou Wen the creeps.Jing Daoxian stuffed the Lost Immortal Sutra into Zhou Wen\u2019s hands before walking away amidst coughs with his back hunched. Soon, he vanished from the dark street.Only then did Zhou Wen feel the invisible force around his body dissipate. Having regained control of his body, he glanced at the direction in which Jing Daoxian had vanished. Unable to see him, he hurriedly looked down at the metal slab in his hand.The history books speak of Jing Daoxian as having an eccentric and unreasonable temperament. He does things as he pleases. It\u2019s really an apt description. Legend has it that Jing Daoxian was capricious, killing people in a way no different from having his meals. He had no sense of morals. Zhou Wen didn\u2019t believe that Jing Daoxian was nice enough to give him a high-grade Primordial Energy Art due to a lucky encounter.Zhou Wen observed the metallic slab but failed to find anything special about it. Without opening it, it looked like a metal cigarette case.After some thought, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t check the Lost Immortal Sutra\u2019s contents. He had the mysterious phone and Sun Strafe Art that destined him to become an expert. There was no need for him to take the risk of cultivating a Primordial Energy Art given to him by Jing Daoxian.Hesitating for a moment while holding the metallic slab, Zhou Wen carefully placed it in his pocket.Firstly, he was afraid that Jing Daoxian was watching nearby. If he were to throw it away, he was afraid that Jing Daoxian would flare up into a rage and kill him.Secondly, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t know if there were any harmful traps in the Lost Immortal Sutra. He wasn\u2019t sure if others would be harmed if he just threw it away.Looking in the direction that Jing Daoxian had vanished, Zhou Wen turned around and headed for the supermarket.At the moment he turned around, Jing Daoxian, who was standing on another street, curled his lips. He sneered with an odd expression. I originally wanted to give you an opportunity for catching my fancy. Who knew that you are such a philistine. No one can live comfortably in this world after rejecting me. You\u2019ll die regardless of whether you cultivate the Lost Immortal Sutra. If there\u2019s anything to blame, blame it on yourself for not knowing better.Suddenly, Jing Daoxian frowned slightly. Did they catch up that quickly?With that said, Jing Daoxian walked towards the other end of the city, quickly vanishing from the city\u2019s landscape.Before Zhou Wen walked far, he saw people running toward him from the street ahead. They were wearing black uniforms that resembled a police uniform, but there were some differences. Despite carefully looking at it, he failed to recognize the uniform.There were men and women in the group, with all of them looking to be in their twenties or thirties. The person leading them was a man in his thirties. He was clean-shaven other than the thin mustache above his lips. He was thin, with a hooked nose, and his eyes were as sharp as a blade.\u201cHey there, did you see an elder in his seventies or eighties when you came from there?\u201d The person ran past Zhou Wen without giving him a second glance. However, before they went far, the man who led the group stopped and turned to ask Zhou Wen.\u201cI think there was one. He headed in that direction.\u201d Zhou Wen pointed in the direction where Jing Daoxian had left.The man observed Zhou Wen for a moment before he nodded and said his thanks. Then, he led the group of uniformed personnel in the direction Zhou Wen had pointed.Zhou Wen waited until they were a distance away before he turned around and briskly walked off. He really didn\u2019t wish to embroil himself in such trouble. He sought a life of gaming in peace while schooling.This time, he finally arrived at the supermarket without any mishap and bought plenty of food. Like always, Zhou Wen headed home and continued his grinding fest.He gamed past one in the morning before he forced himself to put down the phone and go to bed.Zhou Wen\u2019s sleep quality had always been good. This might have something to do with his talent in being able to get into a focused state when learning something. It was the same with sleep. He could fall asleep within three seconds of lying down.Zhou Wen imagined that he would be able to sleep till daybreak, but he felt something amiss while sleeping in the middle of the night.In the past, Zhou Wen was able to sleep the entire night unless roused up by someone. But today was different. The room was so silent that one could hear a pin drop; yet, Zhou Wen woke up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBadump! Badump!Zhou Wen felt his heart beating like a drum as it raced faster and faster. It gave him a feeling that his heart would literally leap out of his chest.Could this heart arrhythmia be a result of my frequent loss of blood? Zhou Wen had never experienced this before. He intended to open his eyes and get up to ease the discomfort.However, he could neither open his eyes nor sit up. He wasn\u2019t even able to move his fingers. The feeling was akin to the desire to urinate while dreaming, but being unable to get up.What\u2019s happening? Zhou Wen felt an ominous feeling rise up in him. He was certain that he wasn\u2019t dreaming for his mind was extremely lucid.What made him feel worse was that he felt as though something was pressing down on him. It was growing in weight, leaving him stifled. He could hardly breathe.Even so, Zhou Wen still couldn\u2019t open his eyes. Nor could he move. It appeared as though he couldn\u2019t wake up from his dream.Could this be the ghost oppression that Grandfather was speaking of when I was little? He thought.As Zhou Wen\u2019s father was very busy with work and he lacked a mother, he was brought up by his grandfather from a young age. Every evening, his grandfather would tell him stories to coax him to sleep.As for his grandfather\u2019s stories, they were mostly ghost stories. Perhaps one of them was the story of the mysterious phone. However, Zhou Wen was still young back then, so he didn\u2019t remember most of them. Only a few especially frightening ones had left a deep impression on him until today. One of them was about ghost oppression.Zhou Wen felt that his present situation was very similar to the ghost oppression his grandfather had spoken of. His mind was very lucid, but he couldn\u2019t wake up or move.It felt as though a heavy object was pressing on him as his heart raced. It left him extremely uncomfortable, to the point of retching. Yet, he couldn\u2019t do so.This feeling continued from the middle of the night until just after six in the morning. Only then did Zhou Wen recover the control of his body. He instantly got up, ran to the bathroom, and vomited into the toilet.Even as he was about to vomit his bile, he remained somewhat in discomfort.What\u2019s wrong? It couldn\u2019t be as simple as food poisoning, right? Zhou Wen suddenly thought of his encounter with Jing Daoxian last night. He couldn\u2019t help but be alarmed. Don\u2019t tell me it has to do with Jing Daoxian?Zhou Wen washed his face before heading to the living room. He picked up the stack of violet metal sheets he had stored away in a drawer.It hadn\u2019t experienced any changes and the words were clearly engraved on the metal, neither too deep nor too shallow.Jing Daoxian is known for being capricious. He definitely wasn\u2019t up to any good by giving me the Lost Immortal Sutra after I rejected him. Perhaps the problem stems from this metal slab. Could it be that he poisoned me? Zhou Wen suspected that Jing Daoxian had placed some form of hallucinogen on the violet metal slab that could seep into the body through contact.He had learned such general knowledge in school, and he did pretty well in his studies. Using tweezers, he placed the violet slab in a glass container and did a simple test. However, he didn\u2019t find any poisonous reactions.There isn\u2019t any poison? Or could the poison be relatively special and prevent ordinary methods of discovering it? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.With all of that done, Zhou Wen felt that his body had recovered. His heart had calmed down and he no longer felt nauseous.He suspected a case of food poisoning, so he took some digestive medicine. His body seemed to fully recover and there weren\u2019t any further abnormalities.As he took note of his body, he began grinding in-game. Now, Zhou Wen was already capable of singlehandedly killing the Skeleton General in-game. He just required quite a bit of time, taking nearly an hour to kill the Skeleton General once.Nothing dropped when he killed the Skeleton General in-game a second time. It left him somewhat disappointed.Unwilling to waste his blood to restart the Ancient Imperial City dungeon, he decided to venture deeper into it.The ancient buildings were connected like a massive maze. Zhou Wen had the intention of heading into one of the ancient buildings to take a look, but he was afraid of dying, making it a waste of blood.The deeper he headed into Ancient Imperial City, the more Skeleton Soldiers he encountered. Towards the end, he had encountered tides of Skeleton Soldiers that he couldn\u2019t clear no matter how hard he tried. Yet, there was no sight of a Skeleton General.This continued late into the night and the streets were filled with endless numbers of skeletons. Giving up, Zhou Wen stormed out of the area and chose to quit the game.He hadn\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep the previous night, so his fatigue was getting to him. He decided to sleep early to spruce himself up for tomorrow\u2019s continued efforts.It didn\u2019t take him long to fall asleep, but not long after, he snapped awake again. He was suffering from sleep paralysis again.His heart raced as something heavy pressed down on him. He felt extreme discomfort.Damn it\u2026 It\u2019s definitely not as simple as food poisoning\u2026 It must have been Jing Daoxian\u2026 Zhou Wen had the urge to curse.He had no grudge with Jing Daoxian. He had just declined Jing Daoxian\u2019s offer of the Skyfiend Treatise and this was the outcome. He was truly loathsome.After enduring through the night, the feeling vanished at dawn. Roughly at the same time as the day before, Zhou Wen once again regained control of his body.He got up again and rushed to the bathroom. The vomiting was worse than yesterday, making him feel as though he was about to vomit out his stomach.Like yesterday, the discomfort quickly vanished. If it wasn\u2019t because of the excruciating pain from before and his vomit still in the toilet, Zhou Wen would have thought that his discomfort was nothing but an illusion.He was very certain that the problem was likely a result of Jing Daoxian.To seek him out was clearly unpragmatic.The entire League had Jing Daoxian on a wanted list for decades but had failed to apprehend him. It was nearly impossible for a higher schooler like Zhou Wen to find him.Even if he were lucky and ended up finding Jing Daoxian, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t believe that he possessed the means to redress this injustice.After some thought, he took out the Lost Immortal Sutra slab. Without any hesitation, he flipped through it and read its contents.Jing Daoxian had told him that it recorded an interesting Primordial Energy Art that he should cultivate in. This made Zhou Wen believe that the resolution to his problems lay in the Lost Immortal Sutra.Although this thought didn\u2019t seem to hinge on anything reliable, Zhou Wen was without options. All he could do was first figure out what Lost Immortal Sutra was before making a decision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Its contents were viewable the moment he opened it. There were tiny words densely packed on every page and on both sides.Zhou Wen began reading from the back of the first page. It was indeed the opening of a typical Primordial Energy Art. It mentioned things like the human magnetic field and Primordial Energy Art. As he read it, Zhou Wen suddenly felt hungry. Recalling that his favorite salted eggs were among the food he had bought yesterday, he put down the Lost Immortal Sutra and peeled one to add it to a bowl of instant noodles.After he had finished eating, he returned to read Lost Immortal Sutra, only to realize that he had forgotten his reading progress.Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He was confident in his memory and although it wasn\u2019t a photographic one, he wouldn\u2019t forget anything he read for a couple of years.Yet, in less than ten minutes, he had forgotten the few lines he had just read.Reading the Lost Immortal Sutra again, he was astonished to realize that it wasn\u2019t as simple as forgetting his reading progress. When he read it from the beginning, he found the content equally unfamiliar as though it was the first time he was reading it. He had apparently forgotten all the content he had read just minutes ago.There\u2019s indeed something odd about this! Zhou Wen continued reading before finding himself feeling hungry again. He needed some more food.This moment of distraction was enough to make him forget his reading progress in Lost Immortal Sutra. When he read from the beginning, he found the content he had just read unfamiliar once more. He had forgotten the content again.Zhou Wen refused to have his beliefs shaken as he picked up his phone, opened its notes app, and began recording the content he read from the violet sheet.However, whenever Zhou Wen memorized a sentence and turned his gaze to the phone, he would find his thoughts a blank when he tried to input the content. He couldn\u2019t recall the line he had just memorized.After attempting to memorize the Lost Immortal Sutra again, Zhou Wen quickly discovered that he could clearly remember the content when reading it, but once he moved his gaze away in a bid to record it, everything would be forgotten.Zhou Wen attempted to write as he read, but it was useless. Just any level of distraction was enough to wipe his memories of Lost Immortal Sutra\u2019s content.He tried using his phone to snap pictures of the Lost Immortal Sutra, but after taking a few pictures, he found that the pictures only showed the metal sheet being a uniform violet color without any engravings.This Lost Immortal Sutra is indeed odd. Not only can\u2019t I divert my attention to read it, but I\u2019ll be affected by the text within when focusing, getting distracted by my various emotions. It\u2019s truly bizarre. Zhou Wen thought as he looked at the Lost Immortal Sutra engraved on the metal sheets.Unbeknownst to him, this Lost Immortal Sutra wasn\u2019t only simple but bizarre. He just experienced distractions in the beginning, but towards the end, it escalated to something far more fatal.Many Epic stage experts in history had died because of reading of Lost Immortal Sutra. Even if they were lucky to survive, they would go crazy and become no different from an idiot.Even Jing Daoxian wasn\u2019t able to finish reading Lost Immortal Sutra after obtaining it. He closed it after reading it midway without daring to continue. If it wasn\u2019t because the Lost Immortal Sutra had a magical connection to its owner, making it impossible to forcefully abandon it, Jing Daoxian wouldn\u2019t have kept it on him.If it wasn\u2019t because of the influence that Lost Immortal Sutra exerted on him, Jing Daoxian wouldn\u2019t have been injured inside a dimensional zone. He had originally planned on finding a way of disposing of it.When Zhou Wen declined Jing Daoxian\u2019s Skyfiend Treatise, the latter was insistent that Zhou Wen cultivated in the Primordial Energy Art he had given. Not only did he want Zhou Wen to cultivate it, but he also wanted Zhou Wen to suffer for his actions. He even wanted him to die a tragic death. This was the reason why he had given the Lost Immortal Sutra to him.His vile nature was absolutely nothing the average person could compare with. He was truly a devil.Due to the strangeness of the Lost Immortal Sutra, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t continue reading. He even wanted to experiment if anything would happen to him if he distanced himself from the metal slab and the Lost Immortal Sutra.\u2026In a hotel suite in Guide City, a few people were sitting around a table, discussing something. If Zhou Wen were around, he would have recognized them to be the uniformed personnel he had met that fateful night.\u201cWe let Jing Daoxian escape once again. Damn it,\u201d a man said angrily.It hadn\u2019t been easy for them to acquire clues of Jing Daoxian\u2019s whereabouts. Furthermore, the latter was heavily injured, giving them their best chance of apprehending him. Yet, they had still failed to catch up to him.\u201cDespite being so heavily injured, how did he break through our blockade and escape without us realizing it,\u201d a woman said, perplexed.\u201cRegardless of how injured he is, he is still Jing Daoxian nonetheless. We shouldn\u2019t take it to heart. If we had locked down all of Guide City in the beginning, we might have stood a chance of finding him.\u201dEveryone exchanged their views, except for a man who remained silent. At the seat of honor, he rhythmically tapped the table\u2019s surface as he hung his eyelids low, seemingly in thought.\u201cMinister Qiao, what\u2019s your take on this?\u201d a blonde, green-eyed lady gave the man a teasing look as she asked with a coquettish voice.Qiao Siyuan looked up slightly when he heard her question. Stopping his tapping of the table, he swept his gaze across everyone.\u201cHow long did Jing Daoxian spend in Guide City, from the moment he entered until he left?\u201d Qiao Siyuan didn\u2019t reply to the lady\u2019s question and returned with a question.The woman switched on her tablet and said after taking a look at the information. \u201cFor a person like Jing Daoxian with extremely powerful perception, it won\u2019t be easy for cameras to capture any traces of him. Thankfully, the Eye in the Sky is a rather well-refined system. There are certain areas that make it impossible to escape surveillance. From the video feed we have at present, we can determine that Jing Daoxian entered Guide City at approximately 8:30 p.m. and left at 9:20 p.m., spending a total of fifty minutes in Guide City.After Qiao Siyuan heard this, he picked up his pen and drew out a red line on Guide City\u2019s map. \u201cThis is the path we took while pursuing Jing Daoxian. Based on the information we have at present, he has suffered grievous injuries, so he can\u2019t advance too quickly. In addition, there are no reports of him using any transportation.\u201d\u201cBased on the snapshots occasionally taken by the Eye in the Sky, that\u2019s indeed the case. Jing Daoxian didn\u2019t walk very quickly, reaching the square\u2019s vicinity at approximately 8:55 p.m\u2026.\u201d the lady briefed him in detail.\u201cThen, did you notice that the distance between Xiangjun Road to Changjiang Road only takes up less than 5% of his entire trajectory in Guide City. Yet, he spent nearly ten minutes there. Can someone tell me why?\u201d Qiao Siyuan glared at everyone as he asked.\u201cPerhaps he needed to tend to his wounds?\u201d a young man suggested.Qiao Siyuan said stoically, \u201cDoes anyone of you remember our encounter with a high-schooler on that stretch of road?\u201dEveryone took some time to recall. When the lady realized what he was talking about, she hurriedly said, \u201cThe youth who you asked about Jing Daoxian\u2019s direction of escape?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s the one.\u201d\u201cMinister, do you think that youth is in cahoots with Jing Daoxian?\u201d the blonde, green-eyed lady asked Qiao Siyuan.Qiao Siyuan focused on the laid-out map on the table before saying, \u201cNo. He\u2019s likely an ordinary high-schooler. However, since he met Jing Daoxian in that period of time, perhaps we might be able to understand why Jing Daoxian had spent abnormal amounts of time in that area through him. Think of a way to find that high-schooler.\u201dEveryone exchanged looks. They hadn\u2019t especially taken note of the youth that passed them by. Furthermore, it was in the evening and the youth hadn\u2019t worn anything that made himself stand out. To seek him out without a clue left them somewhat at a loss.\u201cI\u2019ll sketch up the youth for you. To appear in that vicinity at that time while wearing home clothes means that he lives nearby. Check the nearby cameras to see if they managed to capture him. Bring him back as quickly as possible,\u201d Qiao Siyuan said.\u2026With the Lost Immortal Sutra in hand, Zhou Wen originally had the intention of leaving it somewhere far from home. However, the moment he left his doorstep, he saw a car parked along the street. Li Xuan was inside the car, waving at him.\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d Zhou Wen walked over and asked.\u201cGet in the car first.\u201d Li Xuan opened the door and moved inside, gesturing for him to get in.Zhou Wen thought for a moment and got in.Li Xuan closed the door and rolled up the window. Then, he unlocked his phone and handed it to Zhou Wen. \u201cTake a look at this.\u201dZhou Wen gave him a suspicious glance and discovered that there was a picture shown on the screen\u2014a document.As the text was too tiny, Zhou Wen had no choice but to swipe across the phone\u2019s screen to zoom in. Only then did he see what the document was about.It appeared to be a draft, indicating that a new dimensional zone had been found in the vicinity of Ancient Inlet. Furthermore, Companion Beasts in the form of organs had been discovered inside. The report then provided some data and analysis.\u201cWhy are you showing me this?\u201d Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan with a perplexed look.Li Xuan answered in excitement, \u201cAncient Inlet is inside Sunset College. This newly discovered dimensional zone will be Sunset College\u2019s in the future.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Zhou Wen still didn\u2019t get Li Xuan\u2019s excitement.\u201cSo what? It means that students of Sunset College will have the opportunity of entering this newly discovered dimensional zone in the future. They will have a chance of obtaining organ-type Companion Beasts.\u201dSeeing Zhou Wen\u2019s unfazed expression, Li Xuan continued, \u201cCompanion Beasts in the form of organs are extremely rare. You might not have heard of them, but I can very responsibly tell you that those things are a lot more precious than the typical Companion Beast. Let me put it this way. If your heart were to be wrecked by someone or if you were on your deathbed with a heart disease, having a Companion Beast in the shape of a heart means it could fuse with your heart and replace your original heart. It would enhance your heart\u2019s functionality\u2026\u201d\u201cIt does sound useful.\u201d Zhou Wen finally had a chance to speak after listening for a period of time.\u201cIt\u2019s far from useful. Let me ask you. Do you know how many elderly people in the League die a year from heart diseases? And how many people die from tumors in their organs? Organ-type Companion Beasts can be sold for astronomical prices. Besides, even if you don\u2019t sell it and keep it for yourself, it will be equivalent to having an additional life when you adventure in dimensional zones\u2026\u201dLi Xuan droned on before ending with one statement. \u201cThe benefits of that dimensional zone producing organ-type Companion Beasts is something only members of Sunset College can enjoy. Don\u2019t hesitate any further. Follow me to Sunset College. Delay any further and it will be too late. If this piece of news is officially announced, all the top students across the country will swarm to apply at Sunset College. That special admissions quota won\u2019t be enough.\u201d\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll head back and do the registration.\u201d Zhou Wen didn\u2019t hesitate and agreed to it.Although he didn\u2019t wish to have ties with the An family, he also didn\u2019t wish for the An family to affect his normal life. Since applying to Sunset College brought about so many benefits, there was no reason for him to give it up, much less give it up because of the An family.\u201cFill in the application on the Internet before handing me your identification card. Leave the rest to me,\u201d Li Xuan hurriedly said.In fact, after Zhou Wen had his college entrance examination results, all he needed to do was apply at Sunset College\u2019s official website and await admission.With Zhou Wen\u2019s results, it wasn\u2019t a problem for him to be admitted under ordinary circumstances. However, things were no longer the same. Once the discovery of organ-type Companion Beasts had been announced, competition for the limited number of spots would become intense. Zhou Wen might not be admitted as a result.Li Xuan took Zhou Wen\u2019s identification card and planned on using some of his connections to get him admitted to Sunset College.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t speak further. After registering on the website with his phone, he gave his identification card to Li Xuan.\u201cThat should be it. I\u2019ll be heading back to Luoyang. If there\u2019s nothing else for you here, pack up and head with me to Luoyang. I\u2019ll take you around to familiarize you with Luoyang and Sunset College\u2019s campus,\u201d Li Xuan said as he put away the identification card.\u201cAlright. Wait a moment.\u201d Zhou Wen got out of the car and headed home to pack up.\u201cWait? I\u2019ll help you with the packing.\u201d Li Xuan got out of the car and followed Zhou Wen home.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t have much to pack to begin with. After packing up some of his daily necessities and clothes, he left Guide City with Li Xuan.Guide City wasn\u2019t too far from Luoyang. Before the dimensional storms happened, it took about three to four hours by car.However, many areas these days had turned into dimensional zones. Circling around them doubled the journey time at the very least, so it took them more than ten hours to get there.Li Xuan had wanted to have a good chat with Zhou Wen, but to his dismay, Zhou Wen began gaming the moment he got into the car. His eyes stayed peeled to the screen, leaving Li Xuan somewhat depressed.Is this guy for real? Does he have such skills despite being so obsessed with gaming? Li Xuan was very experienced when it came to acting\u2014especially when it came to playing the pig to prey on tigers.But regardless of how he looked at it, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t seem to be acting. He truly looked obsessed with gaming.Li Xuan sat there watching Zhou Wen game for quite a while before becoming extremely bored. Wasn\u2019t it just the constant grinding of some monster ants? Such repetitive and boring games had lost favor decades ago.\u201cZhou Wen, is that game so fun?\u201d Bored after watching for a while, Li Xuan asked.\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d Zhou Wen said without looking away from the screen.As he was afraid that Li Xuan had noticed something, he didn\u2019t enter the Ancient Imperial City. Instead, he kept grinding at the Ant Nest.After obtaining the mysterious phone, Zhou Wen had already looked up most of the dimensional zones on Earth. Although there were a few dimensional zones that resembled the Ant Nest, they were different from the one in-game. Vigor Ants didn\u2019t exist either.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Xuan found it boring as he closed his eyes to circulate his Primordial Energy to begin cultivating his Invincible Connate Divine Art.As for Zhou Wen, he controlled his blood-colored avatar and stormed towards the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.Although he had the experience gleaned from killing the Skeleton General\u2014a Legendary stage creature\u2014he found his ability falling short when facing the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. He was killed after a few clashes.This Silver-Winged Flying Ant seems more difficult to deal with than the Skeleton General. It\u2019s faster and it has the ability of flight. It\u2019s unrestricted due to the lack of the skeleton horse. Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He originally thought that he had improved significantly over the recent period of time, but after a clash with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, he realized how small the improvement was.If I can incubate the Skeleton General\u2019s Companion Egg, I should be able to kill the Silver-Winged Flying Ant using the Skeleton General\u2019s strength to fight it. Unfortunately, as I don\u2019t have the Invincible Connate Divine Art, it\u2019s almost impossible for me to incubate a Legendary stage Companion Egg at the Mortal stage. As Zhou Wen thought over the matter, he went back to his original thoughts of combining Inch Punch and Vigor Divine Fist.However, he didn\u2019t have the means to practice while in the car. Having reached a bottleneck in-game and unable to make any progress, he felt that it was pointless continuing for it was a waste of his blood.Seeing Li Xuan enter a cultivation state and with the driver not taking a look back at the situation, Zhou Wen took out the Lost Immortal Sutra and planned on reading the contents within.The Lost Immortal Sutra had the ability to perplex the mind. Even a terrifying expert like Jing Daoxian was unable to focus fully to finish reading the text.However, Zhou Wen was different. As the former principal of Guide High School had mentioned, Zhou Wen could be absolutely focused on anything if he so wished. This was the main reason for his excellent studies and fast cultivation.Now, with Zhou Wen\u2019s mind completely settled, he read the Lost Immortal Sutra without any distractions. The power of the text that could perplex the human mind failed to distract Zhou Wen at all.The focused Zhou Wen just wanted to finish reading the contents; his brain didn\u2019t have any capacity for second thoughts. So even though the textual power of the Lost Immortal Sutra was extremely bewitching, the thoughts failed to distract him.No one had ever been able to read Lost Immortal Sutra from cover to cover; yet, Zhou Wen managed to do so without any incidents occurring. Zhou Wen was completely engrossed as he finished reading it.Humans had a plethora of emotions that could cause them to be enticed by various things. Even Buddha found it difficult to remain unmoved. So although it wasn\u2019t the case that there wasn\u2019t anyone who could finish reading the Lost Immortal Sutra, there was only a handful.People like Zhou Wen, who could dedicate himself once they made up their mind to be truly focused, were an extremely small minority in the League. Even Epic stage bigwigs whose strength far exceeded Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t achieve this focused state of mind.Even the immortals of heaven would be lost to the enticement, giving Lost Immortal Sutra its name.Zhou Wen managed to read it from cover to cover without being perplexed by the textual power. The Lost Immortal Sutra which had never been read by others finally appeared in Zhou Wen\u2019s eyes in their entirety.When Zhou Wen had finished reading the final word of Lost Immortal Sutra, he suddenly felt his body quake. Primordial Energy in his body began automatically flowing at some point in time.In the past, Zhou Wen had cultivated years of Ascetic Meditation, so once his Primordial Energy did a circulation, it would circulate in the Ascetic Meditation\u2019s trajectory. However, this time, the Primordial Energy\u2019s trajectory followed a strange path that Zhou Wen had never seen before. It nearly coursed through his entire body in constant circulation.Based on what Zhou Wen knew, any kind of Primordial Energy Art had a beginning and an end.For example, Ascetic Meditation\u2019s beginning point was in the dantian\u2019s sea of energy. When the Primordial Energy flowed out of it, it would follow his meridians and ultimately return to the sea of energy after completing one circulation. The sea of energy was the reservoir of Primordial Energy.Most Primordial Energy Arts were the same. Certain special Primordial Energy Arts would forge an extremely special sea of energy in particular regions, or multiple ones. However, they were ultimately meant as a reservoir for Primordial Energy.Now, Zhou Wen\u2019s physical situation was a little odd. The Primordial Energy in his body kept flowing repeatedly without stopping. There wasn\u2019t anywhere he could store his Primordial Energy or for it to stop. It was like a perpetually moving train on a circular track.Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed as he attempted to circulate Ascetic Meditation to redirect the out-of-control Primordial Energy back to a proper trajectory. However, he quickly realized that the Ascetic Meditation he had been cultivating for years was helpless. The Primordial Energy didn\u2019t listen to his instructions.He didn\u2019t panic as a result. He carefully sensed the trajectory of his Primordial Energy circulation and quickly discovered that the trajectory followed the Lost Immortal Sutra\u2019s circulation trajectory.Eh, I actually still remember the Lost Immortal Sutra? Zhou Wen was somewhat taken aback when he thought of the Lost Immortal Sutra. After all, he had been thinking about other things, but at this moment, he still remembered it clearly. He could recall each and every word of the entire Lost Immortal Sutra. There weren\u2019t any signs of forgetting them as he had previously.If the narrow-minded Jing Daoxian were to know that Zhou Wen hadn\u2019t died from reading the Lost Immortal Sutra in its entirety, to the point of gaining a basic mastery of it, he would probably throw up blood in anger.Unable to stop his Primordial Energy from circulating, Zhou Wen could only take the risk to cultivate in the Lost Immortal Sutra. Once he tried, he felt his Primordial Energy immediately course in delight, answering to the call of the Lost Immortal Sutra.He originally intended to read the Lost Immortal Sutra\u2019s content once, but to his surprise, he actually ended up mastering it after he had finished reading. He had no idea if it was a boon or bane for him.Zhou Wen entered a cultivation state without realizing that the thirteen violet metal sheets had gradually turned to dust and vanished when he began cultivating the Lost Immortal Sutra.After cultivating it, he found several points of interest. It really didn\u2019t have a concept of a sea of energy. His Primordial Energy would constantly circulate around his body unceasingly, like the blood that coursed through his veins.Zhou Wen\u2019s circulation of the Lost Immortal Sutra allowed him to control the speed of the Primordial Energy flow, but he wasn\u2019t able to completely stop it.Even if he didn\u2019t circulate the Lost Immortal Sutra, his Primordial Energy would continue circulating slowly, following the Lost Immortal Sutra\u2019s pathways.With the circulation of the Lost Immortal Sutra, Zhou Wen felt his entire body abruptly become light. It felt as though his body had its shackles unlocked, giving him an indescribable sense of freedom and comfort.But other than that, there was nothing special. He hadn\u2019t advanced to the Legendary stage and it was still slowly circulating.Zhou Wen realized that he didn\u2019t need to deliberately cultivate in the Lost Immortal Sutra. When he opened his eyes to move about, he found that the Primordial Energy would continue to circulate automatically. His actions didn\u2019t influence it at all.I have to cultivate even if I don\u2019t wish to. Zhou Wen sighed secretly.Without needing to deliberately cultivate Lost Immortal Sutra and with nothing else to do, Zhou Wen picked up the mysterious phone and used the hidden needle in his ring to stab his finger, dripping a drop of blood onto the phone\u2019s screen.This time, Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t in a rush to enter the game dungeons. He first took a look at his stats in-game.Zhou WenAge: 16 yearsLifeform level: MortalStrength: 10Speed: 10Constitution: 10Primordial Energy: 10Primordial Energy Art: Lost Immortal SutraPrimordial Energy Skill: Vigor Divine Fist, Skeleton PalmCompanion Beast: Mutated Vigor Ant (Mortal)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen was slightly surprised. He hadn\u2019t advanced to the Legendary stage, but all his stats had risen by 1 point, from 9 to 10.This increment of one point left Zhou Wen somewhat amazed. This was because 9 seemed to be the limits of the Mortal stage. If one didn\u2019t advance to the Legendary stage, absorbing dimensional crystals with values of 10 or more was useless.This had already been proven when he absorbed the 13-valued Speed Crystal. However, the appearance of the Lost Immortal Sutra had broken that limitation.What kind of Primordial Energy Art is Lost Immortal Sutra? The moment he thought of it, he realized that the thirteen violet metallic sheets had vanished at some point in time.Beside him, Li Xuan was still in cultivation while the driver ahead was isolated from them by a transparent bullet-proof glass. It was impossible for them to have taken the Lost Immortal Sutra away.Zhou Wen searched everywhere for the Lost Immortal Sutra\u2019s violet metallic sheets to no avail.How odd. Zhou Wen frowned slightly, unsure if the loss of the Lost Immortal Sutra was a good or bad thing.But since he couldn\u2019t find it, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t force it. Seeing Li Xuan still cultivating his Invincible Connate Divine Art, he raised his phone and began gaming. However, killing ordinary Vigor Ants and Mutated Vigor Ants were of little meaning. He quit the game after playing for a while, leaning into his seat and sleeping.If the typical person wanted to sleep, it wasn\u2019t something that could happen at will. However, Zhou Wen was different. If he wished to sleep, he could quickly fall asleep anytime, anywhere. Even if perilous situations were all around him, he could still fall asleep.This was a type of talent that not everyone was capable of.The reason Zhou Wen decided to sleep now was to figure out if he would still suffer from sleep paralysis after mastering Lost Immortal Sutra.Badump! Badump!Shortly after he fell asleep, Zhou Wen felt his heart race again. He felt stifled in the chest as though something was pressing down on him.Damn it, here it comes again! Zhou Wen was stumped. He had already cultivated the Lost Immortal Sutra, but the anomaly of sleep paralysis remained.Not only had it not been removed, but it had appeared to have worsened. Zhou Wen could vaguely hear strange murmurings by his ears. They didn\u2019t sound like they came from the mortal world, appearing in an oxymoronic manner of being extremely far and extremely near. He couldn\u2019t figure out what was being said as they sounded like the ravings of devils in hell.In this turbid half-sleep state, Zhou Wen snapped awake from the abnormal state of sleep paralysis only when Li Xuan nudged him awake.However, unlike the last two instances of sleep paralysis, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t have the discomfort of having the urge to vomit. He had only broken out into a cold sweat. He felt refreshed when the wind blew on him, giving him a better state of mind.\u201cSunset College follows the management model of a partially-restricted state. After we matriculate, we will have to stay in dorms. Even I\u2019m no exception. Before that, why don\u2019t you stay at my place?\u201d Li Xuan got out of the car and took Zhou Wen to a villa.After the dimensional storms, due to Luoyang being rich in pan-dimensional resources, it quickly became a first-tier city of the League\u2019s East District. This area was also the most flourishing area in the city, so every spot was worth its weight in gold. People who could live in such villas were both rich and noble.Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t surprised that Li Xuan could live in a place like this. What left him surprised that apart from Li Xuan\u2019s driver, this massive villa didn\u2019t have a single servant.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you clean such a huge place alone?\u201d Zhou Wen asked while sitting on the sofa.\u201cThere were a few servants in the past, but I managed to get rid of them. After all, I don\u2019t want outsiders to know of certain matters.\u201d Li Xuan took out a beverage can from the refrigerator and threw it at Zhou Wen. He then continued with a smile, \u201cBesides, I seldom return here. As a profligate scion, I naturally have to spend my nights out. That matches my persona. As for you, feel free to stay here. After school begins, I\u2019ll think of a way to get the school to assign us the same dorm.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t there any single-person dorms in school?\u201d Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He had been used to living alone from a young age. Besides, he needed to game, so it would be better if he lived alone.\u201cNo. The League has always been thinking up means to nurture our teamwork. Be it in the combat test of having four people a team or the team assignments during university, it\u2019s all built on this premise. It\u2019s especially so for Sunset College which has a military background. The management style is also partially militaristic. It\u2019s impossible to get a single room. Even An Jing has to live in a group dorm,\u201d Li Xuan said.\u201cAn Jing has also entered Sunset College?\u201d Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.\u201cDefinitely. Her elder brother is Overseer An Tianzuo, one of the military brass. She definitely will attend Sunset College which has a militaristic background.\u201dHaving said that, Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen with a cheeky smile. \u201cBro, tell me. How the hell did you offend An Jing? She even especially transferred to Guide High School to beat you up. An Jing would never have done something like that in the past.\u201dZhou Wen thought and asked Li Xuan, \u201cDo you know Ouyang Lan?\u201d\u201cOf course, if one doesn\u2019t know Ouyang Lan in a place like Luoyang, they would have lived here for nothing,\u201d Li Xuan said with a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you offended Ouyang Lan? Then you are truly unlucky. It\u2019s no wonder An Jing came over to beat you up.\u201dZhou Wen shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t offend Ouyang Lan.\u201d\u201cThen why did you mention her?\u201d Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen, baffled.Zhou Wen asked again, \u201cHas something happened to Ouyang Lan recently?\u201d\u201cYes. Who in Luoyang City doesn\u2019t know that Ouyang Lan has remarried? However, there wasn\u2019t any grand wedding. Only a few close relatives and friends were invited for a gathering. Outsiders don\u2019t even know what kind of man Ouyang Lan has married. I heard it\u2019s a translator with the surname Zhou\u2026\u201d Having said that, Li Xuan\u2019s eyes widened. He looked at Zhou Wen and asked, \u201cYour surname is Zhou as well\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me that there\u2019s some relationship between the two of you?\u201dZhou Wen shook his head without a word. Li Xuan felt his curiosity itching at him but was helpless with Zhou Wen refusing to speak.After Zhou Wen took up residence in Li Xuan\u2019s place, he went to his room and immediately called Zhou Lingfeng.Zhou Lingfeng was his father, not his son. It wasn\u2019t his prerogative to question Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s decisions. Therefore, Zhou Wen had never delved deep into his thoughts before.In fact, Zhou Lingfeng had never overturned Zhou Wen\u2019s decisions. He hadn\u2019t even participated or given his advice on something as major as attending university. This had seemingly become something tacit between the father-son duo.Zhou Wen called Zhou Lingfeng to inform him that he was in Luoyang and would be attending school at Sunset College.\u201cSon, you\u2019re done with the college entrance exam? How did you do?\u201d Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s voice sounded over the phone, sounding lethargic.\u201cNot bad. I applied for Sunset College. If nothing surprising crops up, I\u2019ll be attending school at Sunset College in the future,\u201d Zhou Wen said.\u201cSunset College? Isn\u2019t that in Luoyang? Come over and live with me then,\u201d Zhou Lingfeng said.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to. I\u2019ll be staying at a friend\u2019s place for the time being. I\u2019ll be living on-campus once I matriculate.\u201d Zhou Wen didn\u2019t wish to have any ties with the An family.Zhou Lingfeng didn\u2019t force him. \u201cAlright then. If there\u2019s anything, just tell me. I\u2019ll make sure to help you. You are already in college, so you aren\u2019t young anymore. I\u2019ll give you a bit more living allowance in the future.\u201dZhou Wen didn\u2019t reject it but asked, \u201cDad, where do you obtain the Sun Strafe Art from?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhat Sun Strafe Art?\u201d Zhou Lingfeng asked in surprise.\u201cDidn\u2019t you get An Jing to send me the Sun Strafe Art?\u201d Zhou Wen was also taken aback.\u201cIt\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know that I have zero interest in cultivation. I don\u2019t know much about such matters,\u201d Zhou Lingfeng said.Zhou Wen fell silent in thought. If the Sun Strafe Art wasn\u2019t given to him by Zhou Lingfeng, then why did An Jing claim that it was given by Zhou Lingfeng? Matters had seemed to become somewhat complicated.What is An Jing up to? Is the Sun Strafe Art real or fake? Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to figure things out.Zhou Wen had no means to figure out the authenticity of the Sun Strafe Art. The average person had no means of coming into contact with the Sun Strafe Art, so it was even more impossible to determine its authenticity.Meanwhile, Zhou Lingfeng continued, \u201cIf it was given by Little Jing, it might be some well-meant. Just keep it for now. I\u2019ll ask her when I meet her again.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhou Wen didn\u2019t continue. Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s impression of the An family siblings seemed pretty good, so it was pointless to say anything else until he figured out the truth.Everyone had their independent thought processes. It was impossible to force someone to view things from your own point of view, even the person closest to you. Only reality had convincing power. Zhou Wen had understood this reason from a young age.After hanging up, Zhou Wen composed himself. He didn\u2019t game but instead began practicing his palm techniques.He had tried many times but had failed to use the force-exerting principles of Inch Punch on Vigor Divine Fist. Therefore, he went for second best in a bid to fuse Skeleton Palm and Inch Punch together as a reference.With complete focus, he used the techniques of Inch Punch when delivering Skeleton Palm.Skeleton Palm\u2019s uniqueness was indeed compatible with Inch Punch. This process was a lot smoother than Zhou Wen imagined. The first few palm strikes were somewhat rough as he failed to fuse the two together correctly.However, it didn\u2019t take long for Zhou Wen to grasp the trick. The fusion of the two attacks became increasingly better.After striking out about ten times, Zhou Wen\u2019s Primordial Energy was completely drained. All he could do was go in-game to grind on Vigor Ants to use the Primordial Energy Crystals that appeared to replenish his Primordial Energy for further practice.Shortly after he entered the game, Zhou Wen was astonished to discover that his Primordial Energy had already recovered a little before a Primordial Energy Crystal dropped.Back when he cultivated Ascetic Meditation, it would take him about an hour to recover one Primordial Energy point. Now, only a few minutes had passed for him to recover one point of Primordial Energy. The speed at which the recovery far exceeded his imagination.Is this the outcome of Lost Immortal Sutra? Zhou Wen felt the Primordial Energy slowly coursing through his body as he felt some delight.To achieve such Primordial Energy recovery speeds at the Mortal stage was unprecedented according to what Zhou Wen knew.Ignoring whether the Lost Immortal Sutra had any other uses or not, just this one trait alone was sufficiently shocking.While grinding in-game with the blood-colored avatar, the mysterious phone was purely controlled by a touch-screen. However, the control of the blood-colored avatar didn\u2019t require any contact with the screen. Most of the time, just thinking was enough to control it. There was some psychic connection between the two.Thoughts and feelings were synchronized, so all the battle experience the blood-colored avatar received in-game was shared with Zhou Wen.Upon seeing a Mutated Vigor Ant crawl over, Zhou Wen controlled his phone\u2019s angle and used his thoughts to control the blood-colored avatar. He wanted to attempt to see if he could fuse Skeleton Palm and Inch Punch together.When the blood-colored avatar struck the Mutated Vigor Ant on the head with its palm, the carapace on the Mutated Vigor Ant\u2019s head remained undamaged. However, after lunging forward a few steps, the Mutated Vigor Ant staggered before collapsing onto the ground.On the left corner of the phone\u2019s screen: Killed Mortal Mutated Vigor Ant.The first line wasn\u2019t of anything to take note of since Zhou Wen had seen it countless times. Besides, this Mutated Vigor Ant hadn\u2019t dropped anything.It was the second line that left Zhou Wen somewhat surprised.\u201cAcquired Skeleton Palm\u2019s high-level skill. Skeleton Palm has evolved into Ashen Palm.\u201dZhou Wen glanced at the blood-colored avatar\u2019s stats and found that the Skeleton Palm in the Primordial Energy Skill row had vanished. Replacing it was a Primordial Energy Skill known as Ashen Palm.Primordial Energy Skill: Vigor Divine Fist (Rank 9)Primordial Energy Skill: Ashen Palm (Rank 10)Rank 10? Wasn\u2019t Skeleton Palm a Rank 1 Primordial Energy Skill? How did it become Rank 10 after it evolved into Ashen Palm? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.Ashen Palm at Rank 10 required expending 5 Primordial Energy points with each use. Its cost was the same as the Rank 9 Vigor Divine Fist.From the Primordial Energy cost, a Rank 10 Ashen Palm likely has the same potency as a Rank 9 Vigor Divine Fist. Zhou Wen had the intention to test the potency of Ashen Palm, but ordinary Vigor Ants and Mutated Vigor Ants were unable to withstand this single strike. It didn\u2019t matter if it was Rank 1 or Rank 9.After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to leave the Ant Nest dungeon and switch to entering the Ancient Imperial City dungeon.As long as the blood-colored avatar didn\u2019t die, leaving a dungeon and re-entering or switching dungeons didn\u2019t require him to waste blood.However, if the blood-colored avatar didn\u2019t die, the game dungeons wouldn\u2019t refresh, so the creatures in the dungeons wouldn\u2019t be refreshed either.The blood-colored avatar had previously died in the Ant Nest, so after entering Ancient Imperial City, the dimensional creatures in Ancient Imperial City had already reappeared. The blood-colored avatar rode the Mutated Vigor Ant as it stormed ahead and soon found the newly spawned Skeleton General.Like previously, he made the blood-colored avatar jump off the Mutated Vigor Ant and charge at the Skeleton General.Using his positioning techniques to circle around the skeleton horse, it took him less than twenty minutes to find an opportunity. He got the blood-colored avatar to leap up and ride on the skeleton horse\u2019s back, sitting right behind the Skeleton General.However, this time, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t get the blood-colored avatar to strike the Skeleton General\u2019s weakness\u2014the eye sockets. Instead, he directly struck at the back of the Skeleton General\u2019s skull with his palm.This palm didn\u2019t injure the Skeleton General\u2019s head at all. However, the blood-colored flames in the skull seemed to splatter out like a crushed watermelon.Due to the momentum of the strike, the Skeleton General lunged forward on the skeleton horse before his bones scattered, turning into a pile on the ground.\u201cKilled Legendary Skeleton General. Discovered Skeleton General dimensional crystal.\u201dZhou Wen looked at the dimensional crystal that had dropped in-game, feeling a pleasant surprise.Ashen Palm could destroy the Skeleton General even without striking its weakness. Its potency was clearly above the Rank 9 Vigor Divine Fist.A Rank 10 Primordial Energy Skill is indeed powerful. I wonder if Ashen Palm has a chance of killing the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. Zhou Wen had the urge to immediately storm to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to give it a try.Vigor Divine Fist was too slow when it came to throwing a punch, preventing him from touching the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. However, Ashen Palm didn\u2019t have such a weakness. It was extremely fast when delivering a palm strike.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe blood-colored avatar picked up the Skeleton General\u2019s crystal and immediately, a potent Primordial Energy surged into Zhou Wen\u2019s body like a boring drill that opened up a brand new path.After this force slowly disappeared, a notification popped up on the game screen: Absorbed Skeleton General Crystal. Learned Legendary Primordial Energy Skill\u2014Penetrating Pierce.Zhou Wen had already been prepared to suffer damage, but he was surprised that everything had happened rather smoothly.With a Mortal stage body, one could only fuse with Mortal Primordial Energy Skill Crystals under normal circumstances. If one forcefully fused a Legendary Primordial Energy Skill, their bodies would suffer an immense impact. The consequences ranged from damaged meridians to instant death.Zhou Wen had relied on his body being far stronger than the typical Mortal stage, and with no fear of death in-game, this gave him the courage to absorb the Skeleton General Crystal. Everything went smoothly and other than the pain of having a Primordial Energy passageway open up in him, there wasn\u2019t any damage dealt to him.\u201cIs this the case when played in-game or is this an effect of Lost Immortal Sutra?\u201d Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t be sure of the reason, but ultimately, it was a boon for him.After glancing at the provided information in-game, Penetrating Pierce was a Rank 1 Legendary Primordial Energy Skill. However, Penetrating Pierce was a Primordial Energy Skill that required a spear-type weapon to deliver maximum force.\u201cLi Xuan, come out here!\u201d Zhou Wen was planning on switching dungeons to try his chances at killing the Silver-Winged Flying Ant in Ant Nest when he heard a woman\u2019s voice sound at the villa\u2019s entrance. At the same time, the doorbell kept ringing.Li Xuan probably wasn\u2019t home and he was the only one inside.Although Zhou Wen heard the doorbell, the visitor had come for Li Xuan. Since the latter wasn\u2019t home, he didn\u2019t have any intention of opening the door. He continued gaming while sitting on the sofa.\u201cLi Xuan, I know you\u2019re home. If you don\u2019t come on out, don\u2019t blame me!\u201d After pressing the doorbell for quite some time, the woman still refused to give up.Zhou Wen completely ignored her and pretended not to hear her shouts. The doorbell\u2019s ringing didn\u2019t disturb him in any way, so he continued gaming.Zhou Wen imagined that the woman would leave quickly, but to his surprise, the woman stopped after yelling for a while. Then, two seconds later, there was a loud bang followed by two thuds. The door had been kicked open!The woman dashed into the villa and saw no one in the living room, so she headed straight upstairs.She appeared to be very familiar with the place, rushing straight for Li Xuan\u2019s room. Without knocking, she kicked the door open.\u201cLi Xuan, there\u2019s no hiding today!\u201d Seeing the room empty, the woman headed down the corridor and kicked open one room after another.When she reached the second room, she saw Zhou Wen gaming while leaning on the bedhead.Seeing a person, the woman was delighted. However, she immediately wore a look of disappointment when she realized that it wasn\u2019t Li Xuan. She glared at Zhou Wen and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Didn\u2019t you hear me screaming?\u201d\u201cI did,\u201d Zhou Wen answered as he gamed, not even looking up at the woman.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer when you heard me?\u201d the woman said, peeved.\u201cYou were looking for Li Xuan, not me. What should I say?\u201d Zhou Wen answered in passing.The woman was instantly at a loss for a rejoinder. She glared at Zhou Wen fiercely and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Li Xuan?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s out.\u201d\u201cI know that he\u2019s out. I\u2019m asking you where he is.\u201d The woman didn\u2019t feel that there was any need to be polite in front of this fellow.\u201cI\u2019ve no idea,\u201d Zhou Wen answered very succinctly because he really had no idea.Just as the woman was about to say something, her phone rang. She picked up the call, said a few words, and prepared to turn to leave as though there was something pressing.But after taking a few steps, the woman seemed to think of something. She rushed back in front of Zhou Wen and yanked him up by the arm. \u201cFollow me. Count it as helping me. At the very least, you can make up the numbers.\u201d\u201cWho are you? I don\u2019t know you.\u201d Zhou Wen frowned slightly, wishing to free himself from the woman\u2019s grasp.\u201cFor you to stay here, you must be one of Li Xuan\u2019s trashy friends. How can you not even know his elder sister? You enjoy life with Li Xuan all thanks to him. Is there a problem helping his sister with something?\u201d The woman seemed anxious, pulling Zhou Wen as she walked out.Zhou Wen was immediately rendered speechless. He wasn\u2019t a trashy friend as she described, but it was true that he was living at Li Xuan\u2019s place at his expense.\u201cLet me go. I can walk on my own. What help do you need from me?\u201d Zhou Wen thought about it and felt that if it wasn\u2019t anything serious, he could always help as payment for rent.The woman didn\u2019t loosen her grip upon hearing that. She continued speaking as she walked. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m only getting you to make up the numbers. I don\u2019t have any hopes of you doing anything. Just don\u2019t screw things up.\u201dWithout even knowing the name of Li Xuan\u2019s sister, he was pulled out of the villa.A motorbike was parked at the villa\u2019s entrance. After throwing the helmet that hung on the handle to Zhou Wen, she got on and said, \u201cCome on up.\u201dWhen he saw her tall figure in a pair of short boots, t-shirt, and jeans, with black curly hair freely cascading down, he found a heroic vibe to her. She was very different from the women Zhou Wen had previously met.However, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t have any other thoughts about it. After putting on the helmet, he sat behind Li Xuan\u2019s sister.\u201cSit tight.\u201d As there was only one helmet, the woman naturally didn\u2019t have one to wear after giving it to Zhou Wen. When the engine roared to life, her curly hair began flailing in the wind, sweeping across Zhou Wen from time to time.On the streets of Luoyang, one could occasionally see experts riding all kinds of dimensional creatures. In contrast, this was rarely seen in Guide City.Vehicles and Companion Beasts followed their own paths looking somewhat bizarre and harmonious.Companion Beasts were taking on an increasingly important role in the League. Work that many humans and machines were unable to complete required the help of Companion Beasts.With powerful Companion Beasts, not only did it strengthen oneself, but it could also provide service to all of humanity.The woman drove extremely fast, swerving through traffic in a harrowing manner. However, she was surprisingly stable, without showing any signs of emergency braking.Zhou Wen sat behind her, with his hands still on his phone gaming. The journey didn\u2019t affect his ability to game.After riding for quite a while, Li Xuan\u2019s sister\u2014Li Weiyang\u2014impression of Zhou Wen improved after not feeling any hands placed around her waist.She had never had a good impression of Li Xuan\u2019s bad company. If she wasn\u2019t in a rush to get Zhou Wen to make up the numbers, she wouldn\u2019t have brought him along. She originally had imagined that Zhou Wen would hug her waist to take advantage of her while riding on the bike, but none of that happened. Even his body hadn\u2019t made any contact with her, as though he was deliberately keeping a distance.I never expected Li Xuan\u2019s friends to show some manners, Li Weiyang thought as she subconsciously looked back at Zhou Wen. It would have been fine if she hadn\u2019t looked back, but with that one look, all her favorable impression was gone.She originally imagined that Zhou Wen was being a gentleman, but when she looked back, she realized that Zhou Wen was still gaming on his phone, having the time of his life. From the way he was engrossed in it, it looked as though he wished to be in the game itself.From the looks of it, I was overthinking things. How could any of Li Xuan\u2019s friends be a gentleman? Li Weiyang thought to herself in a self-deprecating manner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Weiyang stopped inside a Companion Beast Arena with Zhou Wen. A few girls who had been waiting outside rushed over and began breaking out into a cacophony.After listening for a while, Zhou Wen had a rough idea of what was happening.Li Weiyang and the few girls were students of Sunset College. They were his future seniors.These girls and another girl had entered a dimensional zone to slay dimensional creatures and were lucky enough to have a Mortal Companion Egg drop.It was an Ancient War Steed Companion Egg. Furthermore, it had apparently dropped from a Mutated Ancient War Steed.Mortal Companion Eggs were rare to begin with, so to have one drop was a really lucky event. Furthermore, it had dropped from a Mutated Ancient War Steed. This meant that its stats would be extremely high, making it priceless.Companion Beasts of the same level varied drastically in terms of stats. Mortal Companion Beasts\u2019 four main basic stats typically varied between 1\u20139. As for Legendary Companion Beasts, their basic stats varied between 10\u201318.The importance of basic stats was obvious. The higher the stats, the more powerful their innate abilities were. After becoming a Companion Beast, the augmentation they provided their owners was boosted as well.Mutated Ancient War Steeds were top-notch when it came to Strength and Speed at the Mortal stage; therefore, they definitely weren\u2019t inferior in Companion Beast form. To be able to drop such a Companion Egg was definitely a great thing to happen.However, the owner of the Companion Egg became the reason for the strife.As a team, they should have split the spoils of war equally, but the girl who had obtained the Mutated Ancient War Steed Companion Egg claimed that she was the one responsible for killing the Mutated Ancient War Steed and digging out the Companion Egg. Therefore, she should have sole possession of it.The other girls naturally disagreed. However, the girl, Su Mei, forcefully snatched the Companion Egg thanks to her boyfriend being quite a force to be reckoned with in school. She didn\u2019t even intend to provide any compensation.The girls were infuriated and as one of them had a close relationship with Li Weiyang, she got her to stand up for them.After Li Weiyang had heard of the ins and outs, she originally intended to mediate the situation and get both parties to compromise. Su Mei could take the Companion Egg, but she needed to compensate the rest.But to her surprise, Su Mei wouldn\u2019t compromise at all thanks to her boyfriend\u2019s standing. The situation became worse as both sides decided to battle at the Companion Beast Arena. The winner would then be able to take the Mutated Ancient War Steed away.Su Mei\u2019s boyfriend was a senior student at Sunset College named Gao Yang. Li Weiyang also knew him and how strong he was. Therefore, she wanted Li Xuan here and have him bring more people to stand by them in the event Gao Yang went back on his word after losing.But to her dismay, she wasn\u2019t able to get Li Xuan on the phone. Unable to find him at home, all she could do was bring Zhou Wen along.\u201cSis Weiyang, what do we do without Li Xuan being here?\u201d The girls wore a look of worry.Although Li Xuan had just been admitted into Sunset College, his infamy as a prodigal son of the Li family was well known in all of Luoyang. The girls were no exception.Furthermore, they had often seen Li Xuan visiting Li Weiyang.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be afraid of? I\u2019m around?\u201d Li Weiyang said.\u201cBut Su Mei\u2019s boyfriend, Gao Yang, is a fourth-year senior. I heard that he\u2019s very\u2026\u201d a girl said, trembling.\u201cSo what if he\u2019s a fourth-year? He\u2019s still at the Mortal stage. I have confidence in beating him and getting back the Companion Egg,\u201d Li Weiyang said.Zhou Wen found it odd. Since Li Weiyang was Li Xuan\u2019s sister, it meant that she was the eldest daughter of the Li family. Why wasn\u2019t she able to settle such a trivial matter, to the point of having to settle it with a battle at the Companion Beast Arena?He was automatically ignored by the girls because although he had a good build, he looked pale due to his loss of blood. He looked sickly and looked incapable of fighting.After entering the arena, they came to a ring. From afar, there was a group of young men and women. Not only were their numbers far greater than Li Weiyang\u2019s side, but they were also mostly stoutly men.Leading them was a tall and handsome man who was hugging a girl\u2019s waist by the side of the spectator stand. Upon seeing Li Weiyang walk over, he said with a laugh, \u201cLi Weiyang, you actually have the guts to come?\u201d\u201cWhy not? Defeating you won\u2019t be difficult. I\u2019ll definitely get back the Companion Egg,\u201d Li Weiyang said.\u201cI\u2019ve heard of your capability, but you are no way my match. Besides, I\u2019m a fourth-year senior. It\u2019s really not nice bullying a junior like you,\u201d Gao Yang said with narrowed eyes.\u201cGao Yang, what are you getting at?\u201d Li Weiyang had an ominous feeling.\u201cI never bully others, so I\u2019ve deliberately found a second-year junior like the rest of you. As long as anyone of you can defeat him, I\u2019ll return the Companion Egg on a golden plate. Of course, it needs to be a student at Sunset College. Outsiders don\u2019t count,\u201d Gao Yang said as he clapped his hands.On a seat on the spectator stand behind Gao Yang, a figure stood up.\u201cGu Dian!\u201d When Li Weiyang and the other girls saw the figure, the color in their faces drained. The more timid one nearly burst into tears out of fear.Zhou Wen was also alarmed as he stood by the side and sized up the man.He had never seen a person look this fierce all his life.Ugly and fierce-looking were two completely different concepts. This person didn\u2019t look ugly, but he exuded vibes like a devil that left one shuddering. Timid people would probably be frightened to death if they met him in the middle of the night.Zhou Wen never believed that looks alone could frighten someone to death. However, Gu Dian really left chills running through one\u2019s heart, making one not dare look at him straight.\u201cGao Yang, how despicable of you. You actually got Gu Dian to represent you. How much of a sore loser are you?\u201d Li Weiyang said with an ugly expression.Although she was very confident in her strength, Gu Dian was no ordinary student.Gu Dian was nicknamed The Devil at school. Not only was it because of his muscular body, that stood more than two meters tall, or his fierce, devilish looks, but that he had unfathomable strength. His abnormal strength made him nearly invincible among those at the Mortal stage.Gu Dian was probably the first and only person to beat up a senior on the first day he was admitted into Sunset College.Although Li Weiyang had never fought Gu Dian, the latter had once pummeled a fourth-year senior whose strength almost equaled her with a few punches. Li Weiyang knew that her chances of victory against Gu Dian weren\u2019t high.Su Mei, who remained leaning on Gao Yang, mocked, \u201cLi Weiyang, there\u2019s something wrong with what you say. Gao Yang got a second-year because he just doesn\u2019t want to bully a junior like you. So how can you say something like that? Besides, didn\u2019t we already agree that the battle shouldn\u2019t involve any outsiders? Only students from our school can participate in the battle. Isn\u2019t Gu Dian a student of our Sunset College? If you think your strength is lacking, you are free to get help. We aren\u2019t stopping you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Weiyang was rendered speechless. It wasn\u2019t that there weren\u2019t any students that were stronger than Gu Dian in Sunset College. Those that ranked in the top twenty in the school\u2019s internal examinations were basically at the Legendary stage. They were naturally stronger than Gu Dian.However, Li Weiyang didn\u2019t have any close ties with those seniors. They weren\u2019t necessarily going to provide their help without any reason if she recruited them. Furthermore, with the battle about to begin, it was too late.Gao Yang and Su Mei had never mentioned letting Gu Dian fight. Clearly, by letting him step forward now, it was to prevent Li Weiyang and company from having the time to find more reinforcements.\u201cSis Weiyang, what do we do now?\u201d A girl looked at Li Weiyang worriedly.Li Weiyang clenched her teeth. \u201cAt this juncture, I can only try my best.\u201d\u201cSis Weiyang, perhaps we should just forget it. We don\u2019t want the Companion Egg. Gu Dian is so terrifying. It won\u2019t be good if he flares up and injures you,\u201d a girl said.Although the girls were somewhat unwilling, they persuaded her to relent.\u201cWe can\u2019t let those two f*ckers, Gao Yang and Su Mei, walk off with all the benefits.\u201d Li Weiyang just couldn\u2019t let it go seeing Gao Yang\u2019s and Su Mei\u2019s smug looks.After taking off her denim jacket and throwing it to a girl, Li Weiyang walked over to the ring with a heavy expression.The fighting ring of the Companion Beast Arena was actually meant for Companion Beasts. This was because combat had many indeterminable factors and was extremely dangerous. Therefore, the League didn\u2019t promote private battles.However, battles between Companion Beasts were greatly encouraged. Every city had numerous Companion Beast Arenas\u2014facilities that allowed human experts with Companion Beasts to use their companions for battle.Companion Beast competitions had already become a huge industry in the League. Many humans with powerful Companion Beasts had become celebrities with an influence that far exceeded those entertainment celebrities of yesteryear.After all, having strong companions meant powerful strength for themselves. They were genuinely the best among humanity.Although Zhou Wen didn\u2019t pay too much attention to Companion Beast competitions, he also knew several Companion Beast celebrities due to the advertisements that were everywhere.For example, the number one Companion Beast in the world was the Epic stage Verbis Diablo Holy Angel that was known by all. The person who owned her had naturally become a top celebrity.Of course, this ranking of first place only included those who participated in Companion Beast competitions. There were definitely powerful Companion Beasts who had never participated.Zhou Wen heard that when Legendary experts went on expeditions in the dimensional zones, they would mostly fight with their Companion Beasts. Unless necessary, no one wished to engage the battle in person. After all, they only had one life. The death of a Companion Beast wasn\u2019t the end, but it wasn\u2019t the same for humans.Furthermore, a person could control multiple Companion Beasts. This made them far stronger than fighting alone.Li Weiyang got into the fighting ring and stood opposite Gu Dian. Although Li Weiyang stood at 1.7 meters, making her rather tall among girls, she appeared petite in front of Gu Dian.\u201cGu Dian, can you not intervene?\u201d Li Weiyang glared at Gu Dian and asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Gu Dian answered very directly without any hesitation.Li Weiyang wasn\u2019t one to drag things out. Without a word, her long legs produced terrifying strength, appearing in front of Gu Dian in a few steps. She leaped up and exerted immense strength with a twist of her waist, throwing out a kick. It struck out like a bolt of lightning, hitting Gu Dian in the neck.Zhou Wen nodded secretly. Li Weiyang was indeed pretty good, far stronger than Xu Miantu. Furthermore, her kick was clearly a Primordial Energy Skill. That strike alone was enough to snap a human-sized tree.However, Gu Dian didn\u2019t react, despite being hit by such a kick, allowing Li Weiyang to cleave down at his neck with her long blade-like leg.Bam!There was a loud thud and everyone was alarmed. Gu Dian remained standing there, having received Li Weiyang\u2019s strike. Yet, his neck didn\u2019t even move.Although Gao Yang and Su Mei knew that Gu Dian was strong, they never expected him to be this terrifyingly strong. Faced with Li Weiyang\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill kick, he had taken on the blow without dodging. His body hadn\u2019t even trembled once.Li Weiyang was equally shocked, but she didn\u2019t hesitate. Clenching her teeth, she turned her body and did a back kick, throwing out four kicks from her long, but strong, legs like a butterfly.Gu Dian stood there like a tower, taking Li Weiyang\u2019s four kicks without defending or dodging. From beginning to end, he stood there motionless without Li Weiyang injuring him at all.When Li Weiyang was about to kick the fifth time, Gu Dian finally moved. His hand shot out like lightning and grabbed her leg in midair.The next moment, Gu Dian held up Li Weiyang\u2019s leg and, like throwing a sandbag, smashed Li Weiyang onto the ground.With a loud thud, Li Weiyang\u2019s body bounced half a foot in the air after hitting the ring and then fell.Although the ring\u2019s surface was covered with a special rubber material that provided powerful dampening force, it still didn\u2019t stop Li Weiyang from spewing out a mouthful of blood. She didn\u2019t manage to get up immediately.\u201cGu Dian, you really don\u2019t know how to go easy on girls. How can you treat such a beauty in this way?\u201d Su Mei said gloatingly.Gu Dian ignored her and asked Li Weiyang, who was struggling to get up, \u201cAre we continuing?\u201d\u201cYes. Why not? I haven\u2019t lost.\u201d Li Weiyang struggled to her feet, the corners of her mouth stained with blood. Her arm had been dislocated from the throw, but she continued speaking stubbornly.\u201cSis Weiyang, stop it. We don\u2019t want the Companion Egg\u2026\u201d A girl was on the brink of tears.However, Gu Dian didn\u2019t care. Just as Li Weiyang made it clear that she could continue, he dashed towards her like a tank. Grabbing her by the head, he pressed her down onto the ring.Bang!Li Weiyang\u2019s face hit the ground and although the rubber surface provided some dampening, Gu Dian was just too strong. By exerting some force, he made her nose bridge and brow ridge crack. Blood began flowing everywhere.\u201cAre we continuing?\u201d Gu Dian looked at Li Weiyang and continued asking.Li Weiyang\u2019s face was covered with blood. She propped herself up with one hand on the ground, making several bids to exert strength to stand up, the look in her eyes tenacious.A timid girl was about to cry. Zhou Wen could tell that Li Weiyang would continue based on the look in her eyes.Why is this woman so stubborn? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.He hadn\u2019t had any intention of bothering with this matter, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to watch Li Xuan\u2019s sister being brutally tortured having received free board and lodging from him.\u201cWait a moment,\u201d Zhou Wen said before Li Weiyang could even reply.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEveryone was reeling with anxiety. Even Gao Yang and Su Mei were shocked.Although they had gotten Gu Dian, none of them expected him to be this ruthless. If Li Weiyang were to really suffer any serious injuries, it would only escalate the matter.Although she was an illegitimate daughter of the Li family and was never allowed inside the Li family\u2019s house, she ultimately had the Li family\u2019s blood coursing through her veins. It would be impossible for them to ignore it if something really happened to her.When Zhou Wen\u2019s voice sounded, it immediately provided a vent for everyone\u2019s tense feelings. Even Li Weiyang and Gu Dian looked over at him.\u201cSchoolmate, did you say that we can enter the ring as long as we are students of Sunset College?\u201d Zhou Wen asked Su Mei.\u201cThat\u2019s right. What do you wish to say?\u201d Su Mei didn\u2019t know what Zhou Wen was getting at.\u201cI\u2019ve just been admitted into Sunset College, but I haven\u2019t matriculated. Am I allowed to enter the ring?\u201d Zhou Wen asked.He imagined that if Su Mei said no, he could use this opportunity to pull Li Weiyang from the ring and return home early to game.Upon hearing that, Su Mei guffawed. \u201cSo you are our Sunset College\u2019s junior. I can\u2019t tell that you are a man who knows how to cherish women. But as your senior, I\u2019m giving you the chance to be the hero to rescue the damsel in distress. Go on up if you wish to, but don\u2019t blame me for not warning you if you get injured. University and high school aren\u2019t the same.\u201dGao Yang and company jeered. Anyone that could be admitted into Sunset College was an elite. There were plenty that came first or second in their own cities.But so what? After stepping into the college, won\u2019t they all schooled? High school geniuses only lined the bottom at Sunset College. The ones who could really stand out were few and far between. Most ended up drowning in a sea of talent.It was especially so for the top students in small cities. Most of them gradually became mediocre once they arrived at Sunset College. It wasn\u2019t that they weren\u2019t outstanding, but there were just too many people who were more outstanding than them.Gu Dian happened to be one who stood out from his peers. For a rookie who hadn\u2019t even been matriculated to actually dare challenge Gu Dian because of Li Weiyang was, in their opinion, blinded and driven by lust.Gao Yang said with a cheeky smile, \u201cJunior, you do resemble me from a few years ago. It\u2019s fine. Go on up if you want to. As your senior, I\u2019ll give you a chance to show off in front of the beauties.\u201dAs he said that, he thought to himself, Gu Dian doesn\u2019t know how to hold back. It\u2019s definitely not good to injure Li Weiyang. So it\u2019s good that she can be swapped.The girls on Li Weiyang\u2019s side looked at Zhou Wen worriedly. They were afraid that his sickly body would just die from a single punch from Gu Dian.\u201cSenior Weiyang, let me,\u201d Zhou Wen said as he flipped himself into the ring.\u201cDon\u2019t mess around. Go down.\u201d Li Weiyang had only pulled him here to add to the numbers. She had zero intention of getting him to fight.Furthermore, Gu Dian was just too strong and he didn\u2019t hold back. based on Zhou Wen\u2019s sickly look, it was really possible that he could die from a single punch. As students, they might not be able to extricate themselves from his death, nor could Li Weiyang bear the responsibility.Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t be bothered to speak further. He just wished to settle this matter so that he could game in peace.Without waiting for Li Weiyang to speak again, he reached out and lifted Li Weiyang up.Li Weiyang\u2019s arm was dislocated and she was heavily injured. Unable to put up any resistance, she was lifted up by Zhou Wen.\u201cWhat are you doing? Let me go!\u201d Li Weiyang was embarrassed and enraged.Zhou Wen ignored her and directly leaped out of the ring with her. After handing her to the girls, he returned to the ring.\u201cWe are students of the same school, not some archenemies. There\u2019s no need for us to fight to the death. No one can shoulder the responsibility if an accident happens. Why don\u2019t we change the criteria for victory?\u201d Zhou Wen sized up Gu Dian and said.\u201cHow so?\u201d Gu Dian spoke very succinctly. His voice didn\u2019t sound like a college student. It was low, gruff, and forceful\u2014akin to a man in his thirties or forties.Matched with his fierce looks, Zhou Wen really couldn\u2019t believe that he was a college sophomore if it wasn\u2019t for the Sunset College uniform he was wearing.\u201cYou let me punch you once. If you take less than three steps back, count me as the loser. Otherwise, I win. What do you think of my suggestion?\u201d Zhou Wen had only said it randomly. Clearly, this disadvantaged Gu Dian.However, finding a Strength-measuring device was just too much of a waste of time. Therefore, Zhou Wen had given the suggestion.To everyone\u2019s surprise, Gu Dian said coldly without any thought, \u201cSure.\u201dSomewhat surprised, Zhou Wen said with a smile, \u201cThen let\u2019s begin.\u201dGao Yang curled his lips and said, \u201cThis rookie even thinks that he has taken the advantage. If he knows what Primordial Energy Skill and Primordial Energy Art Gu Dian cultivates in, he might be crying, much less laugh.\u201d\u201cBrother Yang, what Primordial Energy Skill and Primordial Energy Art does Gu Dian cultivate?\u201d Someone beside him was intrigued.\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to mention what Primordial Energy Art he cultivates in. However, I\u2019m sure all of you have heard his Primordial Energy Skill before.\u201d Gao Yang deliberately acted mystifying.\u201cSo what Primordial Energy Skill is it?\u201d Su Mei couldn\u2019t hold back her curiosity as she wheedled and nudged Gao Yang\u2019s arm.Gao Yang chuckled. \u201cHave you heard of dimensional creatures known as Needle Porcupines?\u201d\u201cBrother Yang, are you kidding me? We\u2019ve obviously heard of Needle Porcupines. Although they are at the Mortal stage, they are especially thorny. Not only are their carapace tough, but they are also covered with quills. Unless it\u2019s those Legendary stage seniors, we have to circle around them,\u201d a male schoolmate said.\u201cGu Dian\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill came from a Porcupine Skill from a Needle Porcupine Crystal. If he were to use it, not only will his body be as hard as steel, he will also have the ability to deal thorns1 damage,\u201d Gao Yang said.\u201cNo way. I heard that Needle Porcupines very rarely drop Primordial Energy Skills, and even if it drops, with the powers of a Needle Porcupine, it will be a Rank 1 or 2 Primordial Energy Skill. How strong can it be?\u201d Su Mei said in disbelief.\u201cThat\u2019s why people call Gu Dian terrifying. Not only did he have exceedingly good luck to have the Porcupine Skill drop, he even managed to cultivate a Rank 1 Porcupine Skill all the way to Rank 9. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t rely on Primordial Energy Skill Crystals to increase his rank. Isn\u2019t that sick or what?\u201d Gao Yang paused before sneering. \u201cWhen it comes to Rank 9 Porcupine Skill, I\u2019ve once seen a fourth-year use a Primordial Energy Skill strike Gu Dian, only to have his palm riddled with countless bloody holes as though he had been stabbed by countless steel needles. His hand was almost crippled. It\u2019ll be fine if that rookie doesn\u2019t use any Primordial Energy Skills, but if he does, he\u2019s in for a bad time.\u201dSu Mei was delighted when she heard that. She naturally didn\u2019t want Zhou Wen to win, much less hand over the Mutated Ancient War Steed Companion Egg.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cSis Weiyang, is he ok?\u201d The few girls asked worriedly, as they helped Li Weiyang up.Li Weiyang obviously had no idea. However, since Zhou Wen was Li Xuan\u2019s friend and based on the kind of company the latter mixed with, the former was definitely not someone they could rely on.However, Li Weiyang couldn\u2019t say it out loud. All she could do was say something assuring. \u201cSince he dares to enter the ring, he should be somewhat capable.\u201dInstead of saying that to assure her companions, it was more to assure herself.Zhou Wen stood in front of Gu Dian. He wasn\u2019t short among men, but in front of Gu Dian, he was a head shorter.Gu Dian\u2019s body was extremely brawny. Not only was he tall, but his muscles were taut, exuding vibes that he had explosive strength within. There was nothing clumsy about him.During Gu Dian\u2019s battle with Li Weiyang, Zhou Wen had already noticed that the former cultivated in a high-level defensive-type Primordial Energy Skill. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to withstand the strike from a Primordial Energy Skill no matter how strong his physical body was.Gu Dian glared at Zhou Wen with his cold eyes like the devil. In a chilly manner, he said, \u201cCome. Don\u2019t waste any more time.\u201d\u201cYou have to be careful. This punch of mine has great Strength,\u201d Zhou Wen warned him before slowly raising his fist.Su Mei was amused when she heard Zhou Wen. She said in mockery, \u201cIt\u2019s great if you have great Strength. Gu Dian loves that. Use more of your strength, lest you disappoint him.\u201dSu Mei\u2019s words sounded like a joke, but they hid extreme wickedness. Gu Dian\u2019s Porcupine Skill possessed terrifying thorns damage, so the more Strength Zhou Wen used, the greater the damage he would suffer.Although Gao Yang didn\u2019t say a word, he waited to watch the spectacle.Sunset College had many powerful students, but at the Mortal stage, no one was Gu Dian\u2019s match.\u201cIf you aren\u2019t afraid of death, feel free to strike.\u201d Gu Dian\u2019s expression remained unperturbed, but it was already extremely terrifying.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t speak further as he threw out his right fist, producing immense strength with Vigor Divine Fist. It caused his fist to swell up to a whole new size as though it was a hammer.Gu Dian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he stood firmly on the ground. An abnormal redness flushed through his body as though he was lit aflame.Knowing that this was a trait of Porcupine Skill, Gao Yang\u2019s smile became more obvious.When Li Weiyang saw the anomaly on Gu Dian\u2019s body, she immediately recalled something. Ignoring her injuries, she hurriedly yelled at Zhou Wen, \u201cDon\u2019t throw out that punch! It\u2019s Porcupine Skill! It will rebound\u2026\u201dBang!Unfortunately, Zhou Wen\u2019s fist had struck Gu Dian\u2019s abdomen before she could finish her sentence.This was a spot Zhou Wen had deliberately chosen\u2014it was an area that could resist relatively more impact; thus, reducing the chances of death.When the hard-as-steel fist struck at firm muscles, there was a loud thud with the slightest hint of a metallic clash.Zhou Wen\u2019s and Gu Dian\u2019s eyes narrowed simultaneously as Gao Yang and Su Mei watched in disbelief. Gu Dian\u2019s gargantuan body curled slightly like a shrimp as his feet slid across the ice, stopping only after he retreated nearly four meters.Two nearly four-meter-long black marks appeared on the rubber surface like skid marks left by a car\u2019s emergency braking.Li Weiyang stared at Zhou Wen with a blank look, finding his strength unbelievable. He had managed to send Gu Dian retreating about four meters despite the latter using Porcupine Skill.The other girls had already broken out into cheers. This wasn\u2019t just three steps, but three to four meters! It was probably as many as eight steps!\u201cGao Yang, can I take your word?\u201d Zhou Wen retracted his trembling fist and asked.He had sent Gu Dian retreating with one punch, but he wasn\u2019t too good either. His fist was trembling uncontrollably.Gao Yang didn\u2019t say a word as he looked at Gu Dian who said coldly, \u201cI\u2019ve lost.\u201dGao Yang nodded as he looked at Su Mei. \u201cGive the Companion Egg to them.\u201dSu Mei immediately stood up and yelled, \u201cWhat right do they have? The agreement was between them. I didn\u2019t agree that a loss would be counted if Gu Dian retreated three steps. It\u2019s completely unreasonable. Besides, Gu Dian\u2019s feet didn\u2019t even more. It can only be considered one step. Let him fight Gu Dian. If he can trounce Gu Dian, I\u2019ll count it as his win. Besides, he isn\u2019t a student of Sunset College yet\u2026\u201dSmack! Before Su Mei could finish her drivel, Gao Yang slapped her in the face, leaving her stunned.\u201cDo I need to say it a second time? A loss is a loss. I, Gao Yang, never go back on my word. Do you think that a Companion Egg of yours is more important than a promise of mine?\u201d Gao Yang glared coldly at Su Mei.Su Mei was much aggrieved, but she didn\u2019t dare say another word. Unwillingly, she took out the Companion Egg from her bag and handed it to Gao Yang with gritted teeth. Then, she turned around in anger.Gao Yang ignored Su Mei and walked to Zhou Wen with the Companion Egg in hand. Throwing it to the latter, he stared at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cZhou Wen,\u201d Zhou Wen replied calmly.\u201cZhou Wen? I\u2019ll remember you. Since you will be a student of Sunset College in the future, we\u2019ll have plenty of time to spend together soon,\u201d Gao Yang said coldly before he turned around and left with the group of students.Gu Dian glanced at Zhou Wen, but didn\u2019t say a word. He then left, following behind Gao Yang and company.\u201cZhou Wen, I sure couldn\u2019t tell that you had such Strength when you look like such a pretty boy,\u201d Li Weiyang walked over and said as she sized him up.\u201cZhou Wen, are you really our junior?\u201d\u201cAre high-schoolers these days so strong?\u201d\u201cJunior, you used a Primordial Energy Skill, right? How impressive. What is its name?\u201dThe few girls circled around Zhou Wen as they asked him all kinds of questions. Their interest in him seemed to exceed the interest in the Companion Egg he had snatched back.\u201cMy victory was all thanks to luck. That devil-like fellow was truly terrifying. If we had really engaged in battle, it would be hard to tell who would have won.\u201d Zhou Wen handed the Companion Egg to Li Weiyang before raising his injured fist. There were dense, needle-like holes on the back of his hand which were beginning to ooze a tiny bit of blood.\u201cAre you injured?\u201d Li Weiyang was alarmed when she saw the wound on Zhou Wen.Without waiting for his reply, Li Weiyang handed the Companion Egg to the girls and got them to leave. Then, she pulled Zhou Wen outside. \u201cLet\u2019s go. You need to check on your injuries.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need. It\u2019s just some superficial wounds. It didn\u2019t injure my bones,\u201d Zhou Wen hurriedly said.\u201cYou need to have a check-up, otherwise it will be a problem if it leaves some side effects.\u201d Li Weiyang dragged Zhou Wen to the medical room without listening to his protests.The Companion Beast Arena had dedicated medical facilities. By the time they arrived, Zhou Wen\u2019s wounds had already healed and produced scabs that were fine after some treatment. Instead, Li Weiyang was the heavily injured one. She had dislocated her arm and the wound on her face needed treatment. It was Zhou Wen who had to run around to do all kinds of medical paperwork for her.Li Weiyang lay in bed, looking at Zhou Wen and his staid, gentle face as he ran around. With mixed feelings, she thought, I never expected Li Xuan to have such a friend.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was quite an ordeal for Zhou Wen to finally return home and be able to game in peace. But just as he sat on the sofa and launched the game dungeon, Li Xuan rushed home.\u201cYour door was kicked down by a woman who claimed to be your sister. Her name is Li Weiyang,\u201d Zhou Wen immediately made things clear, afraid that Li Xuan would blame him for damaging his villa.However, Li Xuan didn\u2019t heed that at all. In excitement, he asked Zhou Wen in a mysterious manner, \u201cAre you interested in visiting the dimensional zone I previously mentioned?\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the dimensional zone that produces organ-type Companion Beasts?\u201d Zhou Wen asked.\u201cBingo. Are you interested?\u201d\u201cBut we haven\u2019t matriculated! Can we enter now?\u201d Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan suspiciously.\u201cThe average person obviously can\u2019t, but I\u2019m no average person,\u201d Li Xuan said as he languidly slapped his chest.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s head over.\u201d Zhou Wen was quite intrigued, but it wasn\u2019t that he wanted to enter a dimensional zone. Instead, he wanted to know if the dimensional zone could be installed on his phone just like Guide Ancient City.\u201cBro, can you show me some excitement? I really can\u2019t feel a sense of achievement with that face of yours,\u201d Li Xuan said gloomily.\u201cWow! You\u2019re awesome!\u201d Zhou Wen cried out in a very perfunctory manner as he continued gaming on his phone without looking up.\u201cForget it.\u201d Li Xuan became even more depressed. However, he cheered up almost immediately. Pulling Zhou Wen out, he said, \u201cPal, I\u2019ll be broadening your horizon today.\u201dWhen they arrived in the yard, Zhou Wen saw a white tiger sprawled outside the villa. It was even bigger and muscular than an ox.\u201cLegendary Jade-Eyed White Tiger. How cool is that? I incubated it just today. It was such a harrowing experience\u2026\u201d Li Xuan bragged as his saliva splattered about.\u201cWith such flaunting, you have no plans on acting any further, right?\u201d Zhou Wen asked curiously.Li Xuan\u2019s face sank. \u201cIn the past, I wished that things wouldn\u2019t turn nasty among the family, so I didn\u2019t compete with him. Since he doesn\u2019t even want to spare my life, there\u2019s no need for me to stand on ceremony with him. From now on, I\u2019ll become the Li family\u2019s genius, Li Xuan. What should be mine will be mine, nothing less.\u201dZhou Wen gave Li Xuan the thumbs up. Indeed, a genius like Li Xuan didn\u2019t deserve to be hidden. However, he was curious. Li Xuan cultivated in the Invincible Connate Divine Art, so was he to stay a virgin his entire life if he continued cultivating in it?\u201cLet\u2019s not touch on such matters. Come on up. Let\u2019s go a joyride. This Jade-Eyed White Tiger is extraordinary. If I use enough resources on it, it has a chance of advancing to an Epic King of White Tigers. That would make it truly terrifying,\u201d Li Xuan said as he jumped onto its back.Zhou Wen knew that certain Companion Beasts could evolve, but they were in the minority. Furthermore, evolution required special dimensional materials and very strict criteria.Currently, the League was doing research in this respect. There were less than four hundred on the official list of evolvable Companion Beasts. The rest were still being studied.Riding on a Companion Beast didn\u2019t feel good in any way. The trembling was intense due to the lack of a suspension. Zhou Wen would rather ride in a comfortable sedan car.However, Li Xuan was thrilled. He dashed down the road riding the Jade-Eyed White Tiger, whistling and waving to beauties he passed on the street.This fellow\u2019s foppish character sure doesn\u2019t appear to be an act. Zhou Wen suddenly thought of a problem. He whispered into the Legendary stage\u2019s ear, \u201cLi Xuan, what are the criteria needed to incubate a Legendary Companion Egg for those at the Mortal stage?\u201dLi Xuan said, \u201cYou wish to incubate that Skeleton General, right? I\u2019m warning you not to mess around. Don\u2019t try it just because it seems it\u2019s easy for me to incubate one. Let me tell you seriously that people with such thoughts mostly end up either crippled or dead.\u201dAfter a pause, Li Xuan said smugly, \u201cTo incubate a Companion Egg, the most important criteria is to have sufficient Primordial Energy. A typical Legendary Companion Egg needs more than ten Primordial Energy to incubate it. The typical human at the Mortal stage doesn\u2019t have that much Primordial Energy. After being sucked dry of their Primordial Energy, one\u2019s vitality and essence would be drawn in place of Primordial Energy. When that happens, it\u2019s either death or disability. The reason I can incubate a Legendary Companion Egg is because my Invincible Connate Divine Art has cultivated to 9 points of Primordial Energy. Furthermore, I have plenty of vitality and essence that I\u2019m not afraid of being drained. Even so, I had to specially select Legendary Companion Eggs that require relatively fewer Primordial Energy points. Only then can I succeed and survive. It\u2019s almost impossible for others to succeed, unless you aren\u2019t afraid of death.\u201cGive up, man. I\u2019m unique,\u201d Li Xuan added smugly.What Li Xuan had said served as a warning for Zhou Wen. The latter was obviously afraid of death, but the blood-colored avatar in-game wasn\u2019t. Perhaps he could use the blood-colored avatar to incubate a Legendary Companion Beast.Unfortunately, I have no way of taking the Companion Egg into the game. To make an attempt, I can only wait until a Companion Egg drops in-game. With this in mind, he was quite tempted.The phone\u2019s camera feature is able to download dimensional zones. I wonder if it can be used on Companion Eggs? When Zhou Wen thought of this, he took out the Companion Egg and phone from his pocket.He was sitting behind Li Xuan and, with him in the way, no one else could see what he was doing. Zhou Wen then attempted to open the mysterious phone\u2019s camera function and aimed it at the Skeleton General Companion Egg.Beep!To Zhou Wen\u2019s surprise, the camera function was usable. When the camera was pointed at the Skeleton General Companion Egg, a green box appeared on the screen, and with a beep, it focused on the Companion Egg. At the same time, many text and numbers appeared.Skeleton General Companion Egg: LegendaryLife Providence: Oath of City DefenseStrength: 15Speed: 13Constitution: 16Primordial Energy: 18Primordial Energy Skill: Penetrating Pierce (Rank 3)Companion Form: General Bone ArmorZhou Wen looked at the Skeleton General\u2019s stats in surprise. It wasn\u2019t because the stats were surprising, but that no one was able to run tests before a Companion Egg was incubated; thus, making it impossible to know how good a Companion Beast would be before incubation.With just a snap, the phone could list down detailed numbers. It was amazing.The same Companion Beast type all had different stats. The higher they were, the better they were naturally. It was especially so with Primordial Energy Skills. The higher the Rank, the more valuable the Companion Beast was.Beep!While Zhou Wen was looking at the Skeleton General\u2019s stats, his phone beeped again. At the same time, a notification popped up on the screen.\u201cSkeleton General and Mutated Vigor Ant have a compatibility score of 47%. Fusion has a success rate of 47%. Proceed with fusion?\u201dA \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 option popped up on the screen. Without any hesitation, he chose \u2018yes.\u2019 Then there was a clicking sound\u2014the sound of a camera\u2019s shutter.The phone snapped a picture of the Skeleton General, simultaneously making the Skeleton General Companion Egg in Zhou Wen\u2019s hand vanish into thin air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs the phone screen presented the Skeleton General Companion Egg, Zhou Wen\u2019s Mutated Vigor Ant appeared beside it.A notification popped up on the screen again: \u2018As the Mutated Vigor Ant has already finished incubating, the Skeleton General Companion Egg will be used as supplementary material. Proceed with fusion?\u2019Zhou Wen chose \u2018yes.\u2019 Since he was unable to incubate the Skeleton General Companion Egg and there were chances for him to obtain Mutated Vigor Ants again in the future, there was no harm trying.With Zhou Wen making the choice, the Skeleton General Companion Egg flew towards the Mutated Vigor Ant. After infusing into the Mutated Vigor Ant, the screen immediately turned into a spiraling chaos.Ding!After a while, the game screen finally returned to normal. At the same time, there was a notification sound as the following line appeared: \u2018Fusion successful. Mortal Mutated Vigor Ant has evolved into Mortal Mutated Skeleton Ant.\u2019Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed when he heard that. The outcome was still a Mortal Companion Beast after fusing with a Legendary Skeleton General. It felt like a terrible loss.When he carefully studied the Skeleton Ant after the successful fusion, he saw that its originally red carapace had turned dark red. Furthermore, the carapace\u2019s texture had changed. It now seemed like bone that had been dyed red. Even its feelers and claws had the same texture.Furthermore, its claws had turned sharp, covered with razor-like barbed bones. It looked ferocious and terrifying, especially its two front claws. They looked like two strange sickles.Although it had evolved to something rather strong, it was still at the Mortal stage. No matter how much it evolved, it had no way of competing with a Companion Beast at the Legendary stage.Tapping on the Mutated Skeleton Ant\u2019s stats to take a look, Zhou Wen was immediately taken aback. Compared to the Mutated Vigor Ant, its stats had changed tremendously.Mutated Skeleton Ant: MortalStrength: 10Speed: 9Constitution: 10Primordial Energy: 9Talent Skill: Skeleton Pierce (Rank 10)Companion Form: BracerStrength and Companion Beast has increased to 10. Same for the talent skill\u2026 Zhou Wen was alarmed. He had never heard of Companion Beasts having Rank 10 talent skills.In fact, Zhou Wen always believed that Rank 9 was the limit to Primordial Energy Skills. Only when his Ashen Palm reached Rank 10 did he realize that there was such a thing.Zhou Wen had the urge to summon the Mutated Skeleton Ant to see what it looked like. After all, it was drawn in a cartoon style in-game. There were bound to be differences in real life.Unfortunately, he was sitting on Li Xuan\u2019s Jade-Eyed White Tiger. This wasn\u2019t the best time to summon it.Despite his arrogance, Li Xuan put away his Companion Beast at the entrance to Sunset College. He then walked in with Zhou Wen without the pompous attitude.Sunset College was a new college that was established after the dimensional storms. It was very close to the Dragon Gate Grotto\u2014the biggest dimensional zone in Luoyang to date. To this day, humanity had not finished exploring it in its entirety. It was even said that humans had only managed to explore a very tiny area.Apart from the Dragon Gate Grotto, there were several dimensional zones found inside Sunset College. It could be said that Sunset College took most of the dimensional zone resources in Luoyang.Due to it being a partially-restricted school, the students still had to wear uniforms despite being university students. It was a little like military wear.It was still the holidays, but there were plenty of students on campus. Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were stopped by the guards at the door.The guards of Sunset College weren\u2019t security guards but real soldiers. In fact, the dimensional zones in Sunset College were guarded by real military troops.Li Xuan took out two special passes before being permitted to enter.As Li Xuan led Zhou Wen in, he explained, \u201cLuoyang was home to thirteen Chinese dynasties., Ancient cities had been built on this piece of land for millennia, but for all kinds of reasons, these ancient cities had been destroyed and lost to the rivers of time. It could be said that the ground that Luoyang sits on is piled up from multiple ancient cities. Ever since the dimensional storms, many dimensional zones were formed underground. The deeper one goes, the more terrifying the zone becomes.\u201cPeople from Luoyang are accustomed to calling the underground dimensional zones dungeons. At present, the explored dungeon has four levels. There\u2019s definitely more, but no human expert can get any lower. This time, an entrance to a new dungeon was discovered at Ancient Inlet, and new dimensional creatures and organ-type Companion Beasts were found inside\u2026\u201dZhou Wen listened attentively to Li Xuan\u2019s explanation. Sunset College was just too huge. After walking for nearly an hour, they finally arrived at Ancient Inlet which Li Xuan had mentioned.Ancient Inlet was, in fact, a marshland. Rumor was that it was once a river mouth of the ancient Yellow River which once brought disaster to this area by drowning the ancient cities. Later, the Yellow River moved and stopped flowing over this region.In this former riverbed, a new dimensional zone was discovered. When Zhou Wen looked at a stele inside the marshland, his eyes lit up.The stele stood in the middle of the marsh at a height of over ten meters tall. There was a sitting Buddha engraved on it with fairies circling him.Amongst the various engraved symbols, Zhou Wen found a tiny palm symbol. It was rather inconspicuous amongst the fairies and Buddha palm symbols, but to Zhou Wen, it was extremely familiar.On the city gates of Guide Ancient City, Zhou Wen had seen a similar symbol. Furthermore, he had focused his mysterious phone on it to download the Guide Ancient City game dungeon.However, this tiny palm symbol was a little different from the one he had seen at Guide Ancient City.The palm in the Guide Ancient City\u2019s symbol carried something akin to an onion or garlic. But here, engraved in the middle of the tiny palm symbol was a blooming lotus flower.I\u2019ll try to download this game dungeon now. Zhou Wen took out his phone and turned on the camera before aiming it at the tiny palm symbol.Beep!A green box appeared on the screen as it focused on the tiny palm symbol. After the light beep, the familiar \u2018Installing\u2019 word appeared.It really works. Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.Imagining that Zhou Wen was snapping photos, Li Xuan said, \u201cThis stele looks to be in the style of the Northern Wei dynasty. Back then, Buddhism thrived\u2026\u201dZhou Wen wasn\u2019t listening to what Li Xuan had to say. The phone had finished installing as a lotus icon appeared on his phone\u2019s home screen. Beneath it were three words: \u2018Underground Buddha City.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe bottom of the stele was the entrance to the dimensional zone where military troops were standing guard. Li Xuan took out two entrance passes before they entered.Going down the blue-tiled stairs beneath the stele, they ventured deep underground. Zhou Wen finally knew why the people of Luoyang described dimensional zones as dungeons.In an underground space tens of meters deep, a dilapidated ancient city connected as one with the underground world. All sorts of blue-tiled ancient architecture made it appear like a maze.At fixed distances, oil lanterns hung on the blue-tiled walls for lighting purposes. The dim yellow light made the already dark and humid ancient dungeon appear even older.Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were on a street. The buildings that stood on either side were engraved with several symbols related to Buddhism. Even the blue-tiled roofs were engraved with flying fairies.\u201cTrading 8-valued Strength Crystals for 8-valued Speed Crystals. Grab it if you want it!\u201d\u201cOne Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal. Only trading, no selling\u2026\u201d\u201cThe most complete and detailed Buddha City map. With one map in hand, Buddha City is your oyster\u2026\u201dThere were several youths dressed in school uniforms setting up stalls along both sides of the street. Clearly, they were seniors of Sunset College.Zhou Wen had wanted to buy a map but was stopped by Li Xuan.\u201cBuddha City was only recently discovered. The students here can only explore the vicinity. What value can their maps have? I have here the latest map released by the military. It\u2019s much more useful than theirs. Let\u2019s head over to the Lotus Pond to try our luck. Let\u2019s see if we can find the Buddha Heart Lotus,\u201d Li Xuan said as he walked with a map in hand.\u201cWhat\u2019s a Buddha Heart Lotus?\u201d Zhou Wen asked.\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of plant-type dimensional creature. Didn\u2019t I mention that organ-type Companion Beasts were found here? Buddha Heart Lotus is one of them. Buddha Heart Lotus in Companion Beast form is the heart,\u201d Li Xuan explained.Li Xuan held the map and navigated the dark dungeon with Zhou Wen in tow. Perhaps a result of the dimensional creatures having been wiped clean, they didn\u2019t encounter a single one.After walking for nearly an hour, the scene before them opened up. They saw a large swath of green lotus leaves appear in their sights. They were as green as jadeite and they shimmered with a green glow.This huge underground lotus pond was several acres in size. The glimmering green light dyed the entire underground world with a green hue and at spots relatively far from the bank, one could see huge white lotus flowers blooming.\u201cIs that the Buddha Heart Lotus?\u201d Zhou Wen stared at the huge white lotus and asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s the Buddha Heart Lotus, a plant-type dimensional creature. However, those Buddha Heart Lotuses are too far from the bank. Unless one can fly, there\u2019s no way of getting near them,\u201d Li Xuan said.\u201cCan\u2019t you swim over?\u201d Zhou Wen looked at the water in the pond. It was a transparent green and resembled crystals.\u201cDefinitely not. The water here can even melt steel beams. Humans will be reduced to nothing instantly,\u201d Li Xuan hurriedly said.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, what\u2019s the point of coming?\u201d Zhou Wen frowned slightly.\u201cThat\u2019s why I said we are trying our luck. If a Buddha Heart Lotus happens to bloom near the bank, we have a chance.\u201d Li Xuan rubbed his nose and said, \u201cBut it seems we aren\u2019t having much luck. There isn\u2019t a Buddha Heart Lotus blooming by the bank.\u201dJust as he said that they heard galloping sounds coming from behind them. They turned their heads and saw a white horse bolt over with a cold-eyed man sitting on it.The white horse was extremely fast, allowing him to arrive in front of the lotus pond almost instantaneously. However, the man had no intention of reining his horse in and it didn\u2019t drop in speed at all. It rushed straight into the lotus pond.In the next second, Zhou Wen was astonished to find a pair of snow-white wings grow out from the white horse\u2019s sides. It leaped into the air and flew above the lotus pond.\u201cWhite-Winged Flying Horse at the Mortal stage. A very rare Companion Beast. That\u2019s presently the only one in Sunset College. Its owner is Sunset College\u2019s sophomore, Luo Xuan. He\u2019s been called one of the four most handsome hunks of Sunset College. I don\u2019t like him; he\u2019s very arrogant,\u201d Li Xuan said as he looked at the White-Winged Flying Horse in envy.His Jade-Eyed White Tiger was far faster than the White-Winged Flying Horse, but it couldn\u2019t fly. Naturally, he wasn\u2019t able to ride on a white horse and leap across the lotus pond as coolly as Luo Xuan.Luo Xuan rode on his white horse and approached a Buddha Heart Lotus. When he was about ten meters away from it, he suddenly saw the petals of a Buddha Heart Lotus close up on itself, turning into an oval. When the petals suddenly spread open, a green lotus seed was shot out, seemingly blasting Luo Xuan with a cannonball.With a stoic expression, a flash appeared at Luo Xuan\u2019s waist, halving the green lotus seed. Only then did others notice a sword in his hand.\u201cWhat a fast move!\u201d Zhou Wen was somewhat astonished.\u201cThe Luo family are swordsmen. The Azure Star Sword Anthology is a rather famous sword art. It\u2019s not surprising that he\u2019s fast with his sword,\u2019 Li Xuan said, feeling sour grapes.It wasn\u2019t that he was jealous of Luo Xuan\u2019s sword techniques. It was just that the White-Winged Flying Horse drew too much attention. Although it was at the Mortal stage, it was cooler than his Jade-Eyed White Tiger.Zhou Wen was envious as well. Although the Mutated Skeleton Ant was strong, it had a frightening look. In terms of looks, the White-Winged Flying Horse was on a completely different level.Of course, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t care about looks. It was simply that the White-Winged Flying Horse\u2019s ability of flight made it extremely useful.The White-Winged Flying Horse swept across the white lotus pond as Luo Xuan swept his sword, slicing off the huge white Buddha Heart Lotuses.Li Xuan and Zhou Wen could only watch in envy as the Buddha Heart Lotuses were harvested by Luo Xuan.\u201cIf I had known, I would have tried to obtain a Companion Beast that can fly,\u201d Li Xuan said through gritted teeth.\u201cForget it. Let\u2019s head elsewhere to take a look. There should be other dimensional creatures apart from Buddha Heart Lotuses, right?\u201d Zhou Wen asked.\u201cThe area ahead has dimensional creatures, but it\u2019s a little odd there. When the military explored the area, many people died for no reason. It wasn\u2019t an exception even with Legendary experts. It has already been labeled a restricted zone. Ordinary students cannot approach the area,\u201d Li Xuan said as he looked at his map.Intrigued, Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan, \u201cHow did those people die?\u201d\u201cIf the cause of death was known, it wouldn\u2019t be called odd. They just died while walking. No dimensional creature was sighted, nor were there any wounds. Even when the corpses were taken back for an autopsy, it was discovered that their organs had failed and they had shriveled terribly,\u201d Li Xuan said.\u201cOther than these two places, is there nowhere else in Buddha City with dimensional creatures?\u201d Zhou Wen frowned slightly.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely more in the deeper areas of Buddha City. However, even the military hasn\u2019t explored the area, so how would the typical student dare to venture in? It would only be courting death. We can\u2019t risk our lives for adventure, right?\u201dAfter a pause, Li Xuan added, \u201cIn fact, the military has offered a reward. If anyone can crack the mystery of the deaths, the military will reward them with a Legendary Companion Egg. Furthermore, they will be awarded perpetual rights to entering Buddha City.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen had wanted to say something when he heard a splash. It was as though a bomb had exploded in the water.The duo turned their heads and saw a wave rise up from the lotus pond like an erupting undersea volcano. Amidst the wave, a gigantic lotus flower with a diameter exceeded ten meters emerged.The lotus flower was different from the normal Buddha Heart Lotus. Ordinary Buddha Heart Lotus had petals that were pure white, but this Buddha Heart Lotus had blood vessel-like patterns on their white petals. The patterns were faint, outlining a sitting Buddha\u2019s silhouette. It appeared as though a blood-colored Buddha was sitting on each petal.Luo Xuan rode on his White-Winged Flying Horse as he dodged the splashes in midair, but some still managed to splattered onto his steed.The White-Winged Flying Horse neighed in pain as its snow-white hide began corroding away, turning into a bloody, gaping hole. It looked extremely terrifying.Luo Xuan wore an ugly expression as he struggled to steer the White-Winged Flying Horse towards the bank. If they were to fall into the water, they were doomed.Real life wasn\u2019t a game. Be it a human or a Companion Beast, death meant death. There were no second chances. It wasn\u2019t like Zhou Wen\u2019s game, which could be repeated after dying.Luo Xuan wished to escape, but the strange Buddha Heart Lotus had no intention of sparing him. It shot out a lotus seed the size of a basketball that tore through the sky and headed for the White-Winged Flying Horse and Luo Xuan.Typically, lotus seeds shot out by Buddha Heart Lotuses were green in color, but this lotus seed was like crystal blood. It appeared instantly in front of Luo Xuan.The White-Winged Flying Horse could no longer dodge in time. Luo Xuan drew his sword and cleaved, sending a beam that sliced through the blood-colored lotus seed. However, before his sword could fully slice through the blood-colored lotus seed, his expression changed.Almost instantly, Luo Xuan retracted his sword as he tapped his toes on the White-Winged Flying Horse\u2019s back, jumping nearly three meters back like a hawk.Bang!At the same time, the blood-colored lotus seed exploded, turning into bloody rain that enveloped the White-Winged Flying Horse.Following that, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan saw a horrifying scene. The blood landed on the White-Winged Flying Horse like red-hot metal hitting snow. It instantly melted away the White-Winged Flying Horse\u2019s flesh.In just seconds, the White-Winged Flying Horse\u2019s flesh was completely gone, revealing its white bones. All it could do was let out a tragic neigh before plummeting into the lotus pond. There was zero hope for it.\u201cLittle White\u2026\u201d Luo Xuan yelled out in anger and sadness but to no avail. He was still in danger.He was at least five hundred meters away from the bank. With the White-Winged Flying Horse dead, he had no means of flying. The lotus pond was no different from the rivers of hell.Zhou Wen and Li Xuan wanted to help, but they were helpless. They didn\u2019t have any Companion Beasts capable of flight, nor did they have invulnerable bodies. All they could do was stand at the side and watch, unable to do a thing.As the duo believed that Luo Xuan was doomed, they saw him tap a toe on a lotus leaf, soaring back up as though he was weightless as he stepped towards the next leaf.\u201cHey, this pretty boy has quite some skills. He even has a Primordial Energy Skill that imbues alacrity,\u201d Li Xuan exclaimed.When Zhou Wen saw Luo Xuan leap up from the lotus leaf, he was delighted to see the frail lotus leaf tremble slightly instead of being crushed by him.\u201cIn the dimensional zones in Sunset College, are there places that drop Primordial Energy Skill that imbues alacrity?\u201d Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan.\u201cObviously. The most famous one is Dragon Gate Grotto.\u201dZhou Wen began planning to visit Dragon Gate Grotto when he had the chance. If he could download the game dungeon at Dragon Gate Grotto, he could grind for one without any worries. Such a Primordial Energy Skill would be extremely useful. Even if he was no match for his enemies, he could always use it to escape.Boom! Boom!Luo Xuan used the lotus leaves to leap into the sky, but before he got far, two salvos were heard. More than ten blood-colored lotus seeds enveloped the area, sealing off all of Luo Xuan\u2019s exits, leaving no room for him to dodge.Although he still had half a sword left, it was useless against the blood-colored lotus seeds. After slicing them apart, their explosive might would only grow stronger.Gritting his teeth, the clothes on Luo Xuan tore apart, revealing a blue ox tattoo. The next second, it tore out of his body, taking on the form of a blue ox Companion Beast. It appeared in front of Luo Xuan and blocked the blood-colored lotus seeds.With the blue ox as a shield, Luo Xuan finally found a chance of survival. At that split second, he rushed out of the lotus seed bombardment.However, his blue ox Companion Beast had taken the hit. Once the seeds exploded, splattering the blood within them onto it, its flesh and blood began corroding. It then plummeted into the pond with a tragic cry.\u201cThat pretty boy, Luo Xuan, sure has plenty of expensive stuff up his sleeves. He actually has two Mortal Companion Beasts. Unfortunately, it still won\u2019t be easy for him to survive. He\u2019s just too far from the bank,\u201d Li Xuan said with a shake of his head.Zhou Wen ignored Li Xuan as he stared at the lotus pond.The White-Winged Flying Horse and the blue ox had their flesh corroded, reducing them to a pile of bones as they fell into the pond.This terrifying scene made Zhou Wen recall his Mutated Skeleton Ant.The lotus pond and the Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s bloody liquid seemed to be only capable of corroding flesh. Bones weren\u2019t corroded, so was it possible for the Mutated Skeleton Ant who was already reduced to bone to survive in the lotus pond?At this thought, Zhou Wen summoned his Mutated Skeleton Ant and commanded it to approach the lotus pond. Then, it extended one of its claw tips into the water.When the Mutated Skeleton Ant flew out of the back of his hand, it seemed to be made out of blood-stained bones. Its body was filled with bone spikes and it was much bigger than before its evolution. It looked like a skeleton tank, much more ferocious and terrifying than in-game.\u201cHoly sh*t. What Companion Beast is that?\u201d By the side, Li Xuan jumped in fright from the appearance of the Mutated Skeleton Ant. Then, he realized that it was Zhou Wen\u2019s Companion Beast.\u201cSkeleton ant,\u201d Zhou Wen answered without much thought as he made the skeleton ant extend one claw into the lotus pond.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Li Xuan jumped in fright.Soon, Li Xuan realized that the skeleton ant was completely fine, despite extending its claw into the water. It hadn\u2019t been corroded by the lotus pond\u2019s water.Only then did Zhou Wen confirm that his theory was right. The Mutated Skeleton Ant, which was all bone, wasn\u2019t afraid of the lotus pond\u2019s water.With a command from him, the Mutated Skeleton Ant slowly entered the lotus pond. Nothing happened despite its body being soaked in the water. Clearly, the pond water had zero effect on it.Zhou Wen was originally worried that the Mutated Skeleton Ant couldn\u2019t swim, but he was immediately relieved when he saw it paddling its claws on the surface of the water and the lotus leaves like a water spider. It crawled at a rapid speed, in no way different than it was on land.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Li Xuan saw the Mutated Skeleton Ant crawling across the water at a rapid speed, he turned agape.Luo Xuan hopped across the lotus leaves with great speed, but the Buddha Heart Lotus shot its second round of lotus seed bombardment. He had nowhere to hide.Furthermore, even if he could dodge the second salvo, his Primordial Energy could hardly support his continuous use of his Primordial Energy Skill with alacrity traits. He would still die if he were to land in the lotus pond.Suddenly, he heard a voice from the bank. \u201cLuo Xuan, jump on that ant\u2019s back!\u201dLuo Xuan had no idea who was speaking, nor could he process it. He tried his best to avoid a large portion of the blood-colored lotus seeds, but there was one he couldn\u2019t dodge completely. All he could do was grit his teeth and block it with his sword.Although he knew that this action was meaningless\u2014the blood-colored lotus seed would explode once it struck his incomplete sword, reducing him to a pool of blood\u2014he still chose to do so due to his survival instinct.Before his sword hit the blood-colored lotus seed, Luo Xuan suddenly saw a blood-colored figure flash above him. A huge, ghastly ant had leaped over him, slamming into the lotus seed.The blood-colored lotus seed exploded on the ant\u2019s head, splattering it all over with its contents. However, the ferocious-looking ant seemed unfazed by it. It landed on the water surface as it began moving its six claws rapidly, turning to crawl towards Luo Xuan.Luo Xuan was alarmed, imagining that the ant was about to attack him. However, upon recalling the voice and how the ant had blocked the seed, he immediately understood what was happening. He exerted strength on the lotus leaf and jumped onto the Mutated Skeleton Ant\u2019s back.The Mutated Skeleton Ant crawled swiftly across the water surface, much faster than Luo Xuan\u2019s hopping about. By the time the Buddha Heart Lotus produced its third salvo, the ant had already escaped beyond its reach.The Mutated Skeleton Ant rushed onto the bank and stopped in front of Zhou Wen.Luo Xuan jumped off the ant\u2019s back. Even if he were dumb, he could tell that the Mutated Skeleton Ant was Zhou Wen\u2019s Companion Beast. The one who had shouted was likely Zhou Wen.\u201cMy name is Luo Xuan. I\u2019ll definitely repay you for saving my life. May I know your name?\u201d Luo Xuan said.\u201cI\u2019m Zhou Wen. He\u2019s Li Xuan. We are fellow schoolmates. It\u2019s nothing, so don\u2019t take it to heart,\u201d Zhou Wen said casually.\u201cZhou Wen. I\u2019ll remember you.\u201d Luo Xuan sized up Zhou Wen\u2019s looks before turning around to leave.\u201cThat fellow is already in such a pathetic state, but he still wears that cocky look. He pisses me off,\u201d Li Xuan couldn\u2019t stand Luo Xuan.But moments later, Li Xuan was happy again. He chuckled. \u201cWithout the White-Winged Flying Horse, let\u2019s see how he can act cool in school in the future.\u201dZhou Wen ignored him as he sized up the gigantic Buddha Heart Lotus in the middle of the lotus pond. He guessed that it was a Legendary stage dimensional creature.\u201cZhou Wen, this skeleton ant is quite impressive. It seems to be the Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s nemesis. Why don\u2019t you send it over and try eliminating that Buddha Heart Lotus? If you succeed, you might even get something good,\u201d Li Xuan said as he looked at it.\u201cForget it. That Buddha Heart Lotus is odd. I only have this Companion Beast. It\u2019s best I don\u2019t take risks.\u201d Zhou Wen planned on returning to grind the Underground Buddha City dungeon. In-game, his Companion Beast could be revived unlike in real life. There was no need for him to take such huge risks here.\u201cYou are good at everything except that you lack the spirit and fervor of a young man. What\u2019s there to be afraid of? It\u2019s only a Companion Beast. You can get another one in the future. If you can kill that strange Buddha Heart Lotus now, who knows if a special Companion Beast will drop. Wouldn\u2019t you make a killing that way?\u201d Li Xuan commented in dejection.\u201cI don\u2019t like betting.\u201d Zhou Wen shook his head as he turned around and headed back.Li Xuan could only helplessly follow Zhou Wen to head back. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to get two entry passes, and now they were returning without even killing a single dimensional creature after coming to Underground Buddha City.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we visit that bizarre place where everyone dies mysteriously?\u201d Li Xuan suggested as he was unwilling to leave empty-handed.\u201cYou have a Legendary Companion Beast to protect you. I don\u2019t. Besides, I don\u2019t wish to bet my life.\u201d Zhou Wen walked off without even turning back.\u201cYou have zero spirit of adventure.\u201d Li Xuan shrugged before leaving Underground Buddha City with Zhou Wen.Li Xuan grumbled the entire way about how timid Zhou Wen was, but the latter completely ignored him. After returning to Li Xuan\u2019s place, he went straight to his room and launched the Underground Buddha City dungeon.When the blood-colored avatar entered, it looked identical to what Zhou Wen had seen of Underground Buddha City. He then used the map from Li Xuan and used it to find the lotus pond in-game.Unlike reality, where the Buddha Heart Lotuses near the bank had been sliced clean by students, leaving only Buddha Heart Lotuses deep inside the lotus pond, the game was filled with Buddha Heart Lotuses everywhere across the pond. However, there wasn\u2019t a gargantuan Buddha Heart Lotus.To prevent the blood-colored avatar from dying, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t let it enter the lotus pond. He summoned the Mutated Skeleton Ant and got it to rush towards a Buddha Heart Lotus situated near the bank.The Mutated Skeleton Ant\u2019s sharp front claws sliced through the green lotus seeds that shot out as it didn\u2019t hesitate to slice through the Buddha Heart Lotus.\u201cKilled Mortal dimensional creature, Buddha Heart Lotus.\u201dThe system\u2019s notification appeared, but nothing dropped.Zhou Wen ordered the Mutated Skeleton Ant to storm into the lotus pond, slicing any Buddha Heart Lotuses he saw. After killing more than thirty Buddha Heart Lotuses, a dimensional crystal finally dropped.However, Zhou Wen realized that it was a Constitution Crystal with a value of 2. All it could be used for was replenish some of his expended Primordial Energy.While Zhou Wen was mindlessly killing Buddha Heart Lotuses, the news of the gargantuan Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s appearance had spread across Sunset College.Many students who hadn\u2019t left campus during the school break rushed to the lotus pond when they heard. There was no lack of powerful Legendary stage students.Everyone wanted to slay the gargantuan Buddha Heart Lotus. When a Legendary stage student released a Legendary Golden-Eyed Condor Companion Beast in a bid to slay the Buddha Heart Lotus from the air; to everyone\u2019s surprise, it was struck down. It nearly fell into the pond and almost all its feathers dropped off.Thankfully, the Golden-Eyed Condor\u2019s owner was quick to react and made it return early. However, it barely escaped with its life. To make it receive a full recovery was not easy.Many Legendary stage students tried various methods but failed to make much progress. After all, Companion Beasts capable of flight were relatively rare. And with a place like the lotus pond, humans didn\u2019t even dare do the deed themselves, relegating it to their Companion Beasts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDing!In the Underground Buddha City dungeon of the game, Zhou Wen slew countless Buddha Heart Lotuses before a Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal dropped.He was somewhat disappointed. After spending the entire night grinding\u2014with the dawn approaching\u2014not a single Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg had dropped. The dimensional crystals he obtained were useless, with only the Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal being of some use.Li Xuan hadn\u2019t informed Zhou Wen what Primordial Energy Skill the Buddha Heart Lotus had. However, from the lotus seeds it shot out, it was likely a projectile-type Primordial Energy Skill.Mortal stage Primordial Energy Skills basically didn\u2019t have the ability to project their Primordial Energy outwards. This was limited to a small number even at the Legendary stage.Even for a projectile-type Primordial Energy Skill, only the use of a physical projectile could be used at the Mortal stage. There was no way to condense the Primordial Energy into a projectile.Zhou Wen directly absorbed the Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal and quickly a strange force traveled from his phone into his body.The force of the Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal was different from the crystals he had previously absorbed. Its force was extremely mild like a spring\u2019s warm water infusing his body. It slowly flowed through his body before gushing into his heart. It strengthened his heart, making it beat with greater strength.\u2018Absorbed Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal. Attained Primordial Energy Crystal Heart Meditation (Rank 7).\u2019Zhou Wen tried using Heart Meditation and found a warm stream flow out of his heart into every corner of his body. Other than giving him a warm and fuzzy feeling, there was nothing else.No wonder Li Xuan only said that Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Beasts are awesome, but he didn\u2019t mention the Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill. It\u2019s really useless. Zhou Wen didn\u2019t mind as he continued ordering the Mutated Skeleton Ant to slay the Buddha Heart Lotuses.As he was having a great time killing them, he suddenly heard a boom. The pond water nearby spewed hundreds of feet high as a gargantuan Buddha Heart Lotus with petals having a sitting Buddha tore out of the water.Before the Mutated Skeleton Ant could react, the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus had shot out more than ten blood-colored lotus seeds at it.Knowing that the Mutated Skeleton Ant wasn\u2019t afraid of the corrosion, Zhou Wen ordered it to rush forward against the torrent of seeds.When they struck the Mutated Skeleton Ant, they blasted open, releasing the blood within. They flowed everywhere across its body but failed to deal any damage.The Mutated Skeleton Ant dashed towards the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus and when it was about six meters away, it leaped up, inward slashing its razor-sharp claws at the flower bud.Based on Zhou Wen\u2019s observations, the Buddha Heart Lotus itself wasn\u2019t very powerful. Even if it was a Legendary stage creature, the Mutated Skeleton Ant had a chance of cleaving off its bud based on the Strength and talent skill it had.With the Mutated Skeleton Ant right in front of the Buddha Heart Lotus, the Buddha Heart Lotus suddenly spread its petals open like a bizarre mouth and devoured its aggressor. The petals then contracted, turning into a closed bud.Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen saw the system\u2019s notification of the Mutated Skeleton Ant\u2019s death.Indeed, when the petals spread open again, the Mutated Skeleton Ant was nowhere to be seen. There weren\u2019t any remnants of its bones.What a terrifying Buddha Heart Lotus. Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t help but sigh.Without the Mutated Skeleton Ant, Zhou Wen lacked the ability to enter the lotus pond to attempt killing the Buddha Heart Lotus. Although his Companion Beast could be revived in-game, it could only be revived together with the blood-colored avatar. This also meant that when Zhou Wen revived the blood-colored avatar with a drop of blood, his Companion Beast would also revive.But as the blood-colored avatar was still alive, sending it to its death for nothing would be quite a waste.Looking at the map Li Xuan had given him, he controlled the blood-colored avatar and sent it to the restricted zone carved out by the military. Since death was required, he might as well visit to figure out the mystery.In the ancient, dark, and moist Underground Buddha City, there were crumbling walls everywhere. There was also plenty of sand and gravel that tumbled across the ground.Zhou Wen saw a stone bridge when he approached the restricted zone on the map.Typical stone bridges had flowers, grass, birds, or beasts patterned on the bridge railings. But this bridge had several colored, flying fairies.They were in the form of young women as their clothes fluttered in the sky while they danced. It was a staggeringly beautiful sight.Comparing it to the map, Zhou Wen quickly confirmed that the restricted zone was just after the bridge. The soldiers had died mysteriously on the other side of the bridge.Zhou Wen was only gaming, so he naturally didn\u2019t have many apprehensions. He controlled the blood-colored avatar to step onto the bridge.He didn\u2019t discover anything abnormal, it seemed an extremely normal stone bridge. The blood-colored avatar easily crossed and arrived at the other side.Across the bridge, it\u2019s original appearance could no longer be identified. Boulders filled both sides, leaving a narrow path among the rock that was enough for a single person\u2019s passage.There was a faint flickering of flames at the end of the rocky path. It was likely an illumination object such as a fire torch or oil lamp.Zhou Wen carefully observed the path but didn\u2019t discover anything abnormal. He then controlled the blood-colored avatar to walk in and head toward the light.The passage gradually headed up and it was then that Zhou Wen realized that there were stone steps at his feet. However, due to the mud and rubble, the steps had been hidden.After walking for a while, he saw the stone steps exposed outside.He didn\u2019t encounter any danger despite walking hundreds of meters. However, he didn\u2019t let down his guard as he kept observing the stone walls and the steps beneath him.But nothing happened at all. Instead, the flaming light gradually turned clear. With it, he could barely make out a grandiose entrance.The entrance had a plaque that was rather old and damaged. The red paint had mostly faded and the text was already very blurry. At this distance, it was impossible to see what the words were.Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to approach the entrance. Shortly after, he finally saw the words: \u2018Small Buddha Temple.\u2019What\u2019s Small Buddha Temple? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He had heard of Grand Buddha Temple, but he had never heard of Small Buddha Temple.While he was in thought, he suddenly saw the game screen turn black\u2014clearly, the blood-colored avatar had died.How did it die? He couldn\u2019t help but frown. He had been staring at the blood-colored avatar the entire time, but he didn\u2019t see how it had died.After dripping his blood to revive, he sent the blood-colored avatar to the Underground Buddha City. He made the first stop at the lotus pond and spawned the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus, only to have the Mutated Skeleton Ant killed again.The blood-colored avatar then headed to Small Buddha Temple, but it once again died mysteriously at the stone steps in front of the entrance. Zhou Wen had watched very carefully with widened eyes, but he failed to see how the blood-colored avatar had died under his nose.However, Zhou Wen shared the same feeling when the blood-colored avatar died. At that instant, he felt all his organs suddenly contract.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOf course, this was the feeling the blood-colored avatar had given Zhou Wen. None of his organs really contracted.Strange. I didn\u2019t see any dimensional creatures appear. There wasn\u2019t even a strand of grass in the stone rifts. What could have caused the blood-colored avatar to die? It\u2019s no wonder the military are helpless. This place is indeed quite odd. Zhou Wen was thinking of trying another round at the lotus pond and Small Buddha Temple when he heard knocking on the door.\u201cZhou Wen, are you up?\u201d Li Xuan\u2019s voice sounded.Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the sky had already lit up. He had unknowingly gamed for the entire night. Time passed way too quickly.\u201cIt\u2019s unlocked,\u201d Zhou Wen said.Li Xuan pushed the door open and saw Zhou Wen gaming. Furthermore, he had dark circles under his eyes and his hair was disheveled. He couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you gamed the entire night.\u201d\u201cTell me if there\u2019s something interesting. Otherwise don\u2019t disturb my sleep,\u201d Zhou Wen said as he put down his phone.He still planned on having a short nap. Sleep was a form of repose for him in the past, but now, he found sleep torture.The feeling of sleep paralysis was terrible. Furthermore, he often heard devil-like murmurs that went on throughout the entire night.It was only because Zhou Wen was capable of completely focusing that he could ignore these soul-crushing murmurs and withstand the pressure. If any other person were to suffer such torture daily, they would probably have gone mad.Subconsciously, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t wish to sleep. It was also why he gamed with such obsession without realizing it.\u201cSunset College\u2019s matriculation day is earlier than the average university. School will officially begin in a few days. If nothing surprising happens, we might have a chance to watch a good show play out after we matriculate,\u201d Li Xuan said with a chuckle.\u201cWhat good show?\u201d Zhou Wen asked.Li Xuan said mysteriously, \u201cI heard that many Legendary stage students ranked in the top twenty of Sunset College have gone to the lotus pond, hoping to slay that gargantuan Buddha Heart Lotus, but not only have they failed, but some have even lost their Legendary Companion Beasts. Now, they are all actively purchasing Companion Beasts capable of flight. We should be in time to watch a grand battle play out.\u201d\u201cSunset College and the military have Epic stage experts. Why don\u2019t they just mobilize them to vanquish that Buddha Heart Lotus?\u201d Zhou Wen asked, perplexed.\u201cIf every problem is resolved, how are they to nurture the younger generation? The League has rules that reserve these resources for us, the future seedlings. Unless it\u2019s something special, the military or school will not interfere.\u201dPausing, Li Xuan continued, \u201cI was planning on having breakfast with you, but looking at your present state, you probably want to have some more sleep. I\u2019ll have breakfast alone.\u201dAfter Li Xuan walked out, Zhou Wen slept. As always, he quickly fell asleep. The sleep paralysis happened once again as the devil-like murmurs kept sounding in his ears like a fly that he couldn\u2019t chase away.Zhou Wen ignored the discomfort and noise as he focused his mind on sleeping. However, he was unable to sleep as soundly as he used to.After about five hours of sleep, he was woken up by his phone ringing. He felt his mind a lot clearer.\u201cFang Ruoxi?\u201d Zhou Wen saw the caller\u2019s number and was surprised that it was Fang Ruoxi.\u201cZhou Wen, long time no see. I heard you applied to Sunset College. Is that true?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201d Fang Ruoxi seemed to exhale in relief.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Zhou Wen didn\u2019t know what Fang Ruoxi was getting at.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I still have something else to do. Bye.\u201d Fang Ruoxi\u2019s voice sounded a lot happier and she hung up after saying goodbye.She\u2019s crazy! Zhou Wen looked at his phone, having been rendered speechless.Just as he put his phone down, it rang again. This time, it was Zhou Lingfeng.\u201cDad.\u201d Zhou Wen picked up the call.\u201cSon, are you in Luoyang now?\u201d\u201cYes. What\u2019s up?\u201d Zhou Wen had an ominous feeling.\u201cLittle Lan wishes to treat you to a meal. Let\u2019s have a reunion,\u201d Zhou Lingfeng said with a smile.\u201cI\u2019m having it pretty good over here. It\u2019s probably good over on your side, so there\u2019s no need to force a meeting, right?\u201d Zhou Wen said with a frown.\u201cNo matter what you say, we will be a family in the future. It\u2019s only right to get to know one another. Besides, Little Lan really wishes to meet you. Come have a meal on account of your dad.\u201d Zhou Lingfeng didn\u2019t show any intentions of giving up.Zhou Wen thought for a moment before saying, \u201cAlright then. What\u2019s the time and place?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to find the place. Where are you? I\u2019ll get someone to pick you up.\u201dZhou Wen gave an address. he didn\u2019t mention that it was Li Xuan\u2019s place and only said a nearby street\u2019s name.\u201cAlright. Wait there. I\u2019ll get someone to pick you up.\u201d Zhou Lingfeng hung up once that was said.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t know when his ride would come. So all he could do was get out of bed, wash up, and head out. He got to the designated street and, when he saw no one, he crouched by the side of the road to game.This time, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t continue grinding at Underground Buddha City. Instead, he chose the Ant Nest. He wanted to see if he now had a chance of killing the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.Before he found it, he heard the sound of a vehicle stopping beside him. It was a jeep.Zhou Wen saw a long snow-white leg extend out of the car when he looked up. Then, he saw a familiar face.\u201cAn Jing?\u201d Not expecting Zhou Lingfeng to get An Jing to pick him up, he was somewhat taken aback.An Jing looked at Zhou Wen\u2019s phone and couldn\u2019t help but frown when she saw the game running on the screen. She then sized him up and coldly said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t cultivate the Sun Strafe Art?\u201d\u201cI was about to ask you. I asked my dad and he said he didn\u2019t give me the Sun Strafe Art,\u201d Zhou Wen said to An Jing as he controlled the blood-colored avatar to a safe corner before quitting the game.\u201cI gave you the Sun Strafe Art to harm you,\u201d An Jing said with a cold expression before getting into the car. Without looking back, she asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you getting in?\u201dZhou Wen never expected An Jing to be so direct. He was momentarily unsure if she was speaking the truth.However, since she was here and he had agreed to meet, there was naturally no reason for him to turn back. Zhou Wen pulled open the car door and sat at the passenger\u2019s seat.\u201cI\u2019m returning this to you.\u201d Zhou Wen handed over the USB disk with the Sun Strafe Art.After cultivating the Lost Immortal Sutra, no other Primordial Energy Art could work in his body. Regardless of its authenticity, it was already meaningless to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDriving forward without turning her head, An Jing said, \u201cI never take back things I give away. If you don\u2019t want it, you can delete it and throw it away.\u201dZhou Wen placed the USB disk deeper into his pocket. It wasn\u2019t worth much, so there wasn\u2019t any need to return to An Jing. Although he didn\u2019t know the veracity of the Sun Strafe Art inside, it was just as An Jing said; he could just delete it.The entire journey was silent, and soon, they had reached their destination.Zhou Wen had found Li Xuan\u2019s villa extremely luxurious, but when he saw his destination, he realized what luxurious meant. It was like a garden itself.An Jing drove the car passed an elegant and beautiful garden. There was no lack of modern style buildings, but they fused perfectly with the surrounding gardens. The contrast was perfectly balanced, clearly the work of a meticulous designer.In front of a three-story building, An Jing stopped the car and took Zhou Wen straight into the building by the main door.As he entered the foyer, he saw a mature, elegant woman sitting on the couch with Zhou Lingfeng.He sized up the woman and found her resembling the photo that Zhou Lingfeng had sent him. She was likely Ouyang Lan, but she looked more beautiful with a greater disposition in real life. She looked as though she was only in her thirties.\u201cHello, Auntie,\u201d Zhou Wen greeted. Firstly, he didn\u2019t wish to put Zhou Lingfeng in a difficult position. Secondly, he wanted to make it clear that he didn\u2019t treat her as his mother.\u201cLittle Wen, you\u2019re here. You look more handsome than your photographs. Your complexion just doesn\u2019t seem too good. We happen to have cooked some ginseng soup. You should have some later. It helps.\u201d Ouyang Lan stood up and pulled Zhou Wen\u2019s hand, bringing him to the couch.\u201cThank you, Auntie.\u201d Although Zhou Wen had low EQ, he wasn\u2019t foolish enough to reject Ouyang Lan\u2019s well-meant intentions. He just needed to prevent making it awkward for everyone. All he wanted to do was to finish this meal before returning to game. He wanted to see if he could kill that Silver-Winged Flying Ant.Ouyang Lan clearly was a person with very high EQ. Even though it was their first meeting, she made him very comfortable as though they had known each other for ages.Zhou Wen originally imagined that Zhou Lingfeng was someone who had the gift of the gab, but when with Ouyang Lan, his father appeared somewhat wooden. It surprised Zhou Wen.\u201cThese are some fresh persimmons that were delivered earlier. Little Jing, you like them the most, so try them. They\u2019re sweet.\u201d When Ouyang Lan seemed to realize that she had given An Jing the cold shoulder, she personally offered An Jing a succulent, enticing persimmon.An Jing took it, peeled it open and took a bite. It was really sweet.\u201cHere, have another one.\u201d Seeing An Jing finish eating it, Ouyang Lan offered her another one.An Jing took the persimmon and deliberately shot a glance at Zhou Wen. Although she didn\u2019t say a word, he could read her mind.That\u2019s what you call a real mother. An Jing seemed to say because Ouyang Lan hadn\u2019t offered any persimmons to Zhou Wen who sat beside her.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t mind. Ouyang Lan was An Jing\u2019s mother to begin with. Doting on her was only normal, so there was no reason for him to be jealous. Furthermore, he had no plans on becoming a part of the family, so there was even less reason for him to mind.While Ouyang Lan and Zhou Wen were chatting, a butler came over and informed her, \u201cMadam, the meal is ready.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve waited for so long. You must be hungry. Make sure you have plenty.\u201d Ouyang Lan pulled Zhou Wen into the dining room, making him sit beside her. An Jing could only sit somewhere farther away.Upon seeing the table of dishes that were impeccable in smell and appearance, he realized that he had never seen some of the dishes. However, he was able to identify the huge lobster among them.Ever since the dimensional storms, most of the sea had turned into dimensional zones. The creatures in them mutated, so seafood had become much rarer.Lobsters were things that Zhou Wen had only read about in history books, biological textbooks, and on the Internet. He had never seen one in person before, much less eaten one. It was especially so in Guide City which was landlocked. There was almost no chance of eating seafood, not to mention such a huge lobster.\u201cThis lobster was delivered by air this morning. I prepared it myself. Little Jing loves such lobsters the most,\u201d Ouyang Lan said.As there was only one lobster, Zhou Wen imagined that Ouyang Lan had said so as a hint that he shouldn\u2019t fight An Jing for the lobster.When An Jing heard that, she felt touched. Her icy look finally produced a smile as she looked provocatively at Zhou Wen again.However, the next second, Ouyang Lan said with a wistful look, \u201cHowever, seafood like lobster cannot be eaten with persimmons or it will cause diarrhea. In serious cases, it might even cause food poisoning. An Jing has just had persimmons, so Little Wen, you should have the lobster. Have a taste of my culinary skills.\u201dWith that said, Ouyang Lan served the lobster to Zhou Wen.Instantly, An Jing, who was prepared to take the lobster for herself, became petrified. Zhou Wen also wore a look of shock.It was deliberate, definitely deliberate\u2026 Zhou Wen was convinced that Ouyang Lan had deliberately made An Jing eat persimmons. It was clearly a trap.It was no wonder Zhou Wen found it weird. With Ouyang Lan having such high EQ and there being so many persimmons on the plate, there was no way An Jing could finish them alone, so why wouldn\u2019t the former offer him one?Is she really An Jing\u2019s mother? As Zhou Wen looked at the elegant Ouyang Lan with her beautiful features, his mind filled with questions.Regardless, Ouyang Lan treated him very well. If one didn\u2019t know them, one would imagine that Ouyang Lan was Zhou Wen\u2019s real mother while An Jing was the stepdaughter from her husband\u2019s previous marriage.An Jing\u2019s expression fell, but it was obvious that she had been brought up well. No matter how aggrieved she was, she didn\u2019t stomp off in a fit. She waited until the end of the meal.However, her mood was rather terrible, leading her to have a poor appetite.Today, Zhou Wen acutely experienced what it meant to feel at home as a guest and the feeling of returning home.Even though he was slow and distant when it came to social relations, he had to accept that it was difficult to feel irked by Ouyang Lan. He even felt willing to deepen his relationship with her.\u201cLittle Wen, I heard that you\u2019ve been admitted into Sunset College. It must have been tough, right? It\u2019s not easy for foreign students to be admitted into Sunset College. I have nothing much I can offer you, so treat this as a meeting gift.\u201d After the meal, when Zhou Wen was preparing to bid farewell, Ouyang Lan handed a card to Zhou Wen.He originally imagined that it was a credit card or something similar. Just as he was about to decline it, he heard Ouyang Lan say, \u201cThis is a dormitory room card for Sunset College\u2014the single room kind. I heard from Lingfeng that you enjoy some peace and quiet, so I got the principal to prepare one for you. After you matriculate, head to the dormitory according to the card number. You have to accept this tiny gift of mine. Don\u2019t make me feel that I didn\u2019t put too much thought into this present, alright?\u201d\u201cThank you, Auntie. I like this gift a lot.\u201d Zhou Wen thought about it and accepted the gift. Since it was Ouyang Lan\u2019s gesture of goodwill, he wasn\u2019t willing to be antagonistic about it. A dormitory card wasn\u2019t much and a single room was indeed very useful for Zhou Wen.Ouyang Lan\u2019s gift increased Zhou Wen\u2019s impression and favorability of her. Even her gift left him feeling good. She was truly a thoughtful person.\u201cBy the way, don\u2019t call me \u2018auntie\u2019 in the future. Am I that old? Just call me Sis Lan in the future,\u201d Ouyang Lan said with a faint smile.Zhou Wen could sense that she had enunciated the word \u2018auntie\u2019 rather clearly, making it clear that she minded such an address.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter leaving the An family, a chauffeur took Zhou Wen home. He didn\u2019t see An Jing again.Why would Ouyang Lan deliberately try to win my favor? With the An family\u2019s power, there\u2019s no need for her to do so. Zhou Wen saw that the An family\u2019s compound had proper soldiers guarding it. This was a treatment few families in Luoyang enjoyed.He wasn\u2019t convinced that Ouyang Lan was simply trying to build better ties with him just because of Zhou Lingfeng.After all, Zhou Lingfeng left him to his own devices, so there was no need for her to do something as troublesome as this.Completely perplexed at this development, Zhou Wen decided not to vex over the matter. After all, he was just a poor kid and Ouyang Lan likely couldn\u2019t benefit much from him no matter how she schemed.After returning to Li Xuan\u2019s villa, he found it empty. Over the past few days, he seldom saw Li Xuan at home.Zhou Wen sat on the sofa and took out his phone to launch the Ant Nest dungeon once more. As he had only quit the game and the blood-colored avatar remained alive, there was no need for him to waste a drop of blood to enter the game.The blood-colored avatar appeared at the spot he had quit where there were a number of Vigor Ants crawling around him. Zhou Wen summoned the Mutated Vigor Ant and got the blood-colored avatar to ride on it before storming off.The Mutated Vigor Ant was just too powerful. Not even Vigor Ants posed a threat, even Mutated Vigor Ants could be cleaved apart with one swipe.After leaving a wake of destruction and slaying a Mutated Vigor Ant, Zhou Wen heard a notification sound. Originally imagining that a dimensional crystal had dropped, through observation he realized it was only a Mutated Vigor Ant Egg.\u201cDiscovered Mutated Vigor Ant. It has a compatibility score of 73% with the Mutated Skeleton Ant. Proceed with fusion?\u201dZhou Wen chose no because the last fusion hadn\u2019t brought about any excellent effects. He had no idea if a fusion might end up making the Mutated Skeleton Ant weaker; therefore, he chose not to.After choosing \u2018no,\u2019 the Mutated Vigor Ant Egg automatically entered an incubation mode. In turn, Zhou Wen felt his Primordial Energy flow towards the Companion Egg.This time, the incubation was very successful without having his Primordial Energy drained. He took a look at his stats in-game and realized that he still had two Primordial Energy left.After the Mutated Vigor Ant had finished incubating, it turned into an ant tattoo that appeared on the back of his right hand. Perhaps due to the Mutated Skeleton Ant on his left hand, this new Companion Beast had chosen the right.Mutated Vigor Ant: MortalStrength: 7Speed: 4Constitution: 7Primordial Energy: 2Talent Skill: Vigor Divine Fist (Rank 2)Companion Form: Boxing GloveThis Mutated Vigor Ant\u2019s stats are far worse than the first one. It\u2019s not of much use to me. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t take out things that drop in-game. Otherwise, I could sell them for money. Zhou Wen felt a little depressed.Despite so, he was still happy that something had dropped. After all, this was rare to begin with.Due to having his Primordial Energy expended, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t head straight for the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. He first circled the region and killed large numbers of Vigor Ants, using the Primordial Energy Crystals that dropped to replenish his Primordial Energy.After refilling his Primordial Energy to 10, Zhou Wen headed for the spot where the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was.When he saw the Silver-Winged Flying Ant from far away, it flapped its wings and flew over, its speed so fast that it left behind after-images on the screen.Without hesitation, Zhou Wen summoned the Mutated Vigor Ant and made it deal with the nearby ordinary ant horde. As for the Mutated Skeleton Ant, he had summoned it out as his Companion Form.Blood-red bones appeared on his left arm as though he had an exoskeleton. It enveloped his entire left arm, including his hand, turning into a fearsome bracer.The bracer could not only serve as protection, it even had quite a number of bone spikes that made it even more terrifying.Almost at the instant the bracer took form, he felt a force pump into his left arm, condensing its Strength and making it more robust. He had the feeling that his single punch could blow through a mountain.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant arrived at the next instant. Its silver transparent wings rapidly flapped, streaking a curve across the air like a silver bolt of lightning. Its claw stabbed towards the blood-colored avatar\u2019s chest.Zhou Wen had fought the Silver-Winged Flying Ant multiple times, so he knew it very well. Upon seeing its actions, he knew where it was attacking. Without waiting for it to complete the attack, he took a sidestep and turned his body, using his left hand, which was protected by the bracer, to deliver an Ashen Palm strike.At this close distance, with Ashen Palm\u2019s explosive speed, Zhou Wen imagined that it was in the bag. To his surprise, silver streams of light shot out from above the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s four transparent wings.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant, which was already exceedingly fast, had its speed increase significantly. At such close proximity, Zhou Wen\u2019s Ashen Palm failed to keep up with his opponent\u2019s speed. He was just a sliver short of hitting its body.Instead, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s claw directly stabbed into the blood-colored avatar\u2019s chest in that fluid motion. There was no chance for the latter to even struggle as it died on the spot.\u201cA flying-type Primordial Energy Skill?\u201d Looking at the blackened screen, Zhou Wen was excited instead of being sad.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant had never used Primordial Energy Skills before. However, he had managed to force it to use it, meaning that Zhou Wen felt that he had a chance of defeating it.After all, Primordial Energy Skills required Primordial Energy. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant couldn\u2019t keep using it. As long as he figured out a way to stall for time, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible for him to slay it.Furthermore, since the Silver-Winged Flying Ant had a flight-type Primordial Energy Skill, this was undoubtedly good news for him. They were relatively rare and were very useful.With something to look forward to, Zhou Wen worked even harder. He used a syringe to draw some blood and dripped it on his screen, reviving the blood-colored avatar and immediately sending it do battle.When he came in front of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant again, Zhou Wen lasted an additional three seconds. The third time he fought it, he used positioning and Ashen Palm that threatened the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, successfully dodging its use of the Primordial Energy Skill twice.Zhou Wen exchanged the repeated deaths for combat experience as he slowly approached his goal of killing the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.Finally, he confirmed that the Silver-Winged Flying Ant could only use its Primordial Energy Skill twice. This was its limit. As long as Zhou Wen could dodge the greatest threat twice, he would have the chance of defeating it.During his seventh encounter with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, he successfully dodged the two critical instances and found an opportunity to deliver Ashen Palm, striking at the thin waist of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s thin waist didn\u2019t snap. It didn\u2019t even show signs of being injured. However, after it flew several meters away, its waist suddenly seemed to bend. Its upper body drooped down as though it lacked the strength to prop it up. After staggering for a while, it collapsed to the ground due to a lack of balance.Zhou Wen was delighted to see this. He immediately controlled the blood-colored avatar to rush over to deliver another Ashen Palm strike, hitting the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s head.After this strike, Zhou Wen\u2019s Primordial Energy was completely drained. He was unable to use Primordial Energy Skills again, but the effects of this strike were very evident. With the augmentation of the skeleton bracer and Ashen Palm\u2019s cold, explosive might, it blasted apart the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s head. Immediately, it began going in circles as it flapped its wings.Seeing it still alive, Zhou Wen threw a few more punches. However, without any Primordial Energy left, he was unable to use Primordial Energy Skills. He relied only on his Strength and the augmentation of the skeleton bracer. However, he only managed to leave the Silver-Winged Flying Ant tumbling around without dealing any serious injuries to it.However, the two Ashen Palm at full might were lethal. After the Silver-Winged Flying Ant slammed around randomly, it slowly stopped moving.\u201cKilled Legendary creature, Silver-Winged Flying Ant. Discovered Silver-Winged Flying Ant Companion Egg.\u201dZhou Wen was taken aback, having never expected a Companion Egg to drop. Although the chances of a Companion Egg dropping were significantly higher for Legendary creatures, it was still a relatively low probability.To have a Companion Egg drop on his first kill of a Silver-Winged Flying Ant was sheer good luck.However, with this happening, Zhou Wen could only make a bet. A Legendary Companion Egg required plenty of Primordial Energy during incubation. He wasn\u2019t necessarily capable of incubating the egg successfully.Zhou Wen\u2019s only advantage was to use the game character to incubate. Even if he failed, it only led to the game character\u2019s death and nothing to do with him. However, he didn\u2019t know if the Companion Egg would still exist in such circumstances.Can\u2019t this darn game have a backpack? Let me store the Companion Eggs or dimensional crystals that I pick up in an inventory instead of having to use them immediately. Zhou Wen\u2019s grumblings were in vain. He still got the blood-colored avatar to pick up the Companion Egg. Otherwise, the Companion Egg would no longer be there once the dungeon refreshed if his in-game character were to die.However, he didn\u2019t pick it up immediately. He did some grinding on the Vigor Ants and used the dropped Primordial Energy Crystals to replenish his Primordial Energy. Only then did he pick up the Silver-Winged Flying Ant Companion Egg.\u2018Silver-Winged Flying Ant and Mutated Skeleton Ant have a compatibility score of 21%. Silver-Winged Flying Ant and Mutated Vigor Ant have a compatibility score of 11.1%. Proceed with fusion?\u2019They are all ants, so why is the compatibility so low? The system\u2019s notification left Zhou Wen speechless.Without having the intention to change his mind, Zhou Wen chose \u2018no\u2019 before letting the Companion Egg enter the incubation mode.Hum!Zhou Wen felt all his meridians tremble vigorously as his Primordial Energy was instantly drained, leaving not one bit behind. He felt as though he was about to die.He felt a burning pain that seemed to come from an explosion across his back and couldn\u2019t help but spew out a mouthful of blood.Boom!Without any surprises, the blood-colored avatar in-game exploded to its death, turning the screen black.Indeed, even with a 10-valued Primordial Energy limit as a Mortal, using that to incubate a Legendary Companion Beast is still too demanding. Besides, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant isn\u2019t an ordinary Legendary. Zhou Wen felt a little stifled. He had long steeled himself for the worst possible outcome, so he wasn\u2019t too disappointed.When he dripped a drop of blood and relaunched the game, he couldn\u2019t help but widen his eyes when he looked at the stats of the blood-colored avatar.The other stats hadn\u2019t changed, but in the Companion Beast entry, there was an additional \u201cSilver-Winged Flying Ant.\u201dIt actually managed to be incubated\u2026 Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He hadn\u2019t held any hope, so he was surprised to see the Silver-Winged Flying Ant appear in his Companion Beast entry.He hurriedly checked on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s stats. He was rather expectant of it. Other than having a slightly weaker Constitution, it was unlikely to have any other weakness.More importantly, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s body shape could perhaps be used as a mount.Also, with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant as a Legendary Companion Beast capable of flight, he could now attempt to kill the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus.However, when Zhou Wen saw its stats, he was taken aback. He took quite some time to recover.Silver-Winged Flying Ant: Legendary (Larva State)Legendary Life Providence: King of Low AltitudesTalent Skill: Silver Wing FlashCompanion Form: WingsStrength: 12Speed: 14Constitution: 10Primordial Energy: 11Ignoring everything else, its stats were clearly too weak. Among Legendary Companion Beasts, it was the weakest kind. It was even inferior to the Skeleton General and could even be said to be much worse.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant shouldn\u2019t be this weak. Could it be because it couldn\u2019t finish the incubation? Does this Larva State mean that it still has room for growth? Zhou Wen thought about it as he summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.A silver glow appeared on the back of the blood-colored avatar before a silver flying ant flew out. The moment it appeared, Zhou Wen saw how different it was.This Silver-Winged Flying Ant he had incubated was at least half the size of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant he had killed.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant was bigger than a Vigor Ant to begin with and about the size of a Mutated Vigor Ant. But now, it was only about half the size of a Vigor Ant.This size was definitely unsuitable for riding as it was just too small.Zhou Wen tried turning the Silver-Winged Flying Ant into its Companion Form and saw a silver light flash. Four silver transparent wings appeared on the back of the blood-colored avatar.However, the wings looked a little too small, extremely disproportionate to the blood-colored avatar\u2019s size. It left Zhou Wen wondering whether such small wings could lift the blood-colored avatar.He made an attempt and the four silver wings actually managed to allow the blood-colored avatar to fly. The speed was not bad and allowed for nimble maneuvering. However, the wings didn\u2019t allow him to fly high. Its maximum height didn\u2019t surpass twenty meters.Zhou Wen then had a serious look at the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s Life Providence\u2019s and Talent Skill\u2019s introduction.King of Low Altitudes: Has tremendous air superiority, but can only fly at low heights. A king when it comes to low-altitude flight.Silver Wing Flash: Significantly boosts flying speed for a short period of time.Silver Wing Flash was as Zhou Wen expected. However, the Legendary Life Providence title of King of Low Altitudes left him depressed. This creature couldn\u2019t fly high.From the looks of it, I can only count on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant maturing. Otherwise, with such stats, it\u2019s unlikely to hold much of an advantage over any Legendary creature. I shouldn\u2019t even pin my hopes on it to kill the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus. I\u2019m just curious what needs to be done to allow the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to mature, Zhou Wen thought.While Zhou Wen was pondering over the matter, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s Companion Beast interface produced a system notification: Silver-Winged Flying Ant is currently in a hungry state. Proceed with feeding?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen chose \u2018yes\u2019 out of curiosity. He had no idea how feeding was done, nor did he know what Companion Beasts ate.Although people would use dimensional crystals to strengthen their Companion Beasts in real life to expedite their evolution, the situation with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was somewhat different. It wasn\u2019t evolving but growing up.\u2018Two foods available: Mutated Vigor Ant and Mutated Skeleton Ant. Please select the food for feeding.\u2019The food is actually Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen found it extravagant. The price of any Companion Beast could feed an ordinary person for half a year; yet, this fellow was actually eating them.Thankfully, Zhou Wen had no way to sell the Companion Beasts that dropped in-game. For instance, the Mutated Vigor Ant was no longer of much use, so using it as food wasn\u2019t something to be sad about.He didn\u2019t hesitate as he chose the Mutated Vigor Ant as food and fed it to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.The Mutated Vigor Ant which had been selected transformed into a swirl of light that flew towards the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. There was nothing apart from a silver flash after it had infused the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. It allowed the latter\u2019s hungry state to disappear.Having killed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, the ordinary Vigor Ants and Mutated Vigor Ants couldn\u2019t stop the blood-colored avatar and the skeleton ant. Zhou Wen stormed forward, hoping to see what hid deeper in the Ant Nest.The Mutated Skeleton Ant was like a tank. It left a wake of destruction through the ant swarm, but the swarm was like a terrifying tidal wave. Despite spending half an hour, he only advanced a few hundred meters.Zhou Wen\u2019s heart stirred when he saw the underground area widen significantly. He summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and four transparent wings appeared behind the blood-colored avatar, allowing the blood-colored avatar to fly up.Although it could only fly about ten meters high, it was sufficient to prevent the Vigor Ants from touching him. Besides, they were underground, so there wasn\u2019t that much space for him to fly.In fact, even if he flew higher, it wouldn\u2019t help as there were ants crawling on the ceiling. Zhou Wen didn\u2019t allow the blood-colored avatar to get too close.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s Life Providence as King of Low Altitudes made things easier. It flew very agilely at low altitudes and even if Vigor Ants were to pounce off the ceiling towards him, he was able to easily dodge them.Zhou Wen had hopes of encountering other Silver-Winged Flying Ants as he flew or other higher-level dimensional creatures since he was no longer satisfied killing ordinary Vigor Ants.The cave became wider as he ventured deeper. Before long, the game screen suddenly opened up. An underground cavern appeared; huge beyond imagination.And in that underground cavern, there were ant nests stringed together like a gigantic underground city.However, these ant nests were different from human buildings. They looked like stone spheres of varying sizes with huge stone strips in between them, covering nearly half the underground space.Around the ant nests\u2019 periphery, there was a swarm of black-winged flying ants circling the area. Zhou Wen could only see the center where there was a huge spherical ant nest. Furthermore, there was a strange golden glow emitting from it.The next second, Zhou Wen saw a swarm of black-winged flying ants charge at him. The blood-colored avatar didn\u2019t even manage to put up a struggle before being overrun and dying.Upon seeing the black screen, Zhou Wen quit the game. He believed that he had no means of exploring the ant city for quite some time.\u201cAt the very least, I\u2019ll have to wait until the Silver-Winged Flying Ant grows up before I have a chance of exploring the ant city. I wonder what that golden glow in the middle of the ant nest is. It doesn\u2019t look like an ant.\u201d Zhou Wen hadn\u2019t had much time to observe it and since it was too far, he hadn\u2019t managed to take a good look.He happened to be hungry, so he headed to the kitchen to look for some food. He realized that Li Xuan\u2019s fridge was empty. The only thing there was leftover pizza\u2014moldy pizza.Isn\u2019t it a waste to have this huge refrigerator switched on all the time with nothing inside? Zhou Wen decided to buy some food. They were still a few days away from the first day of school, and he needed food for those days.\u2026Inside a hotel suite in Luoyang City, Qiao Siyuan was carefully reading through a document.A blonde, green-eyed woman, Liz, reported as she held a tablet in hand, \u201cThat youth\u2019s information is all in here. His name is Zhou Wen, a student of Guide High School. He graduated this year and scored pretty highly. He came in second in the city for the combat test. He has already been admitted into Sunset College. His father is Zhou Lingfeng, a translator. He doesn\u2019t have any background worth mentioning, but interestingly, Zhou Lingfeng recently remarried and his new wife is the An family\u2019s widow, Ouyang Lan.\u201d\u201cAn Tianzuo\u2019s mother, Ouyang Lan?\u201d Qiao Siyuan was taken aback when he heard that as he looked up at Liz.Liz smiled with a nod. \u201cYes, Overseer An\u2019s mother. According to the intel, An Jing had once specially transferred to Guide High School to beat up Zhou Wen.\u201dQiao Siyuan fell into deep thought after hearing that. He glared at Liz and asked, \u201cDoes Zhou Lingfeng really not have any background?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already had his background investigated. For three generations, their family has been poor. Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s father was a carpenter. He didn\u2019t enjoy physical labor from a young age, and due to his aptitude in language, he chose to be a translator,\u201d Liz said as she took a look at her summary.\u201cCould it be possible that Zhou Lingfeng had made contact with people overseas?\u201d Qiao Siyuan asked.\u201cUnlikely. Although Zhou Lingfeng has some aptitude in language, he\u2019s quite a frivolous person. He\u2019s gluttonous and lazy and quite lustful, often spending his time in bars. His cultivation is terrible and he only barely entered the Legendary stage a few years ago. I doubt such a person will catch the fancy of those fellows overseas, right?\u201d Liz replied.\u201cThat\u2019s strange. Why would a woman like Ouyang Lan like such a man?\u201d Qiao Siyuan frowned.\u201cWomen like a bad boy. Perhaps Ouyang Lan likes a pretty boy like Zhou Lingfeng?\u201d Liz suggested.Qiao Siyuan firmly shook his head. \u201cOuyang Lan definitely isn\u2019t such a woman. The An family went into turmoil following An Datong\u2019s death. An Tianzuo was only fourteen when he inherited the An family\u2019s business. Countless important figures in the League crave what the An family has. Even members of the An family have their sights on these things, a classic case of domestic trouble and foreign invasion. For An Tianzuo to keep the family business secure to this day at such a young age, who do you think was responsible for it? With a woman as powerful as Ouyang Lan, even if she\u2019s remarrying, why would she randomly choose such a useless man?\u201d\u201cBut we\u2019ve already checked very carefully. The Zhou family really doesn\u2019t have any background. Zhou Lingfeng is clean, so it\u2019s unlikely he has any relationships with those overseas,\u201d Liz said.\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate those people overseas.\u201d Qiao Siyuan thought and said, \u201cIs Zhou Wen living at the Ans presently?\u201d\u201cNo. As he had teamed up with Li Xuan for the college entrance exams, they seemed to build up quite a good relationship. Therefore, he has been living at his place since he arrived in Luoyang. We failed to find him in Guide City previously because Li Xuan had brought him to Luoyang early,\u201d Liz said.\u201cBring Zhou Wen here. Remember not to alert anyone, especially the Ans,\u201d Qiao Siyuan said in a deep voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen left Li Xuan\u2019s place and walked along the road. It was a really nice neighborhood, but there weren\u2019t any large-sized supermarkets. Zhou Wen navigated using his phone and discovered that the nearest supermarket was about a kilometer away.Everything around here is nice except the distance needed to buy stuff. Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t averse to walking, but he didn\u2019t wish to waste time on walking.He believed that wasting time was no different from wasting life, so he took out the mysterious phone and gamed while walking.Liz, who had received Qiao Siyuan\u2019s orders to bring Zhou Wen back, had already dispatched men to watch Li Xuan\u2019s place.Upon seeing Zhou Wen leave the house, a subordinate whispered, \u201cDirector Liz, shall we head over and take him away?\u201dLiz rolled her eyes. \u201cZhou Wen enjoys a special status. We mustn\u2019t allow others to discover that he was taken by us. And there are cameras everywhere in that upscale neighborhood. We\u2019d be exposed if were to directly take him away?\u201d\u201cThen what should we do?\u201dLiz impatiently waved her hand. \u201cHead back now. Leave this to me.\u201dAfter chasing away all her subordinates, Liz combed her wavy blonde hair and thought, With my charm, won\u2019t it be a piece of cake dealing with his kid?Liz wasn\u2019t in a hurry. She waited until Zhou Wen left the upscale neighborhood before she started her red convertible sports car. When she saw a stretch of road without any cameras, she drove over.She deliberately stopped her car beside Zhou Wen, and flicked her blonde hair, exposing the snow-white, supple skin of her shoulder. She then shot Zhou Wen a glance with an expectant and alluring look.That kid will be groveling at my feet seeing a sports car matched with a beauty like me. Having this thought, Liz\u2019s look and posture became even more seductive as she wore a faint mesmerizing smile.But soon, her smile froze. Zhou Wen walked as he gamed on his phone, his head lowered. He didn\u2019t even look at her and walked past the car, wasting all of her efforts to present her beauty.Darn loser! Liz fumed with anger, but she still maintained her mesmerizing pose. She then shouted with a voice that could make any man swoon, \u201cHandsome, mind giving me a hand?\u201dAs she spoke, Liz blinked her eyes, preparing to send his heart into a flutter. As long as Zhou Wen looked at her, she planned to sweep him head over heels.Liz maintained her coquettish pose while waiting for Zhou Wen to turn around. However, he didn\u2019t even hear her. He continued walking forward without any intention of turning back.\u201cHandsome\u2026 Handsome\u2026\u201d Liz resisted the urge to pull Zhou Wen back and beat him up. She deliberately shouted charmingly a few times.However, Zhou Wen was completely engrossed in his game, ignoring Liz completely. He didn\u2019t know that Liz was shouting at him since he hadn\u2019t heard his name.Liz finally realized that her strategy had failed when she saw Zhou Wen extending the gap between them.This loser\u2026 Liz gritted her teeth, adamant about not giving up. She floored the accelerator, taking the sports car in front of Zhou Wen again.This time, Liz didn\u2019t make the same mistake. She got out of the car, stood in Zhou Wen\u2019s way, putting one hand on the car. Her other hand twirled her hair as she posed in a most charming and alluring manner, accentuating her exquisite curves to the fullest.Zhou Wen had no choice but to move his gaze from the phone when he realized that something was in his way. He saw Liz when he looked up.\u201cHandsome, can you help me?\u201d Liz asked, blinking her eyes.Yes, take it in and appreciate my charm. You\u2019ll pay in a while. Liz thought hatefully, having already prepared her lines. Once Zhou Wen answered her, she would invite him to get into the car and take him back with her.\u201cNo.\u201d However, Zhou Wen\u2019s single-word answer instantly left Liz\u2019s words stuck in her throat.After speaking, he bowed his head and stared intently at his screen. Then he circled around Liz and walked past her.The corners of Liz\u2019s eyes twitched as flames nearly spewed out of her eyes. Plumes of fiery anger nearly tore out of her busty chest.Darn loser\u2026 He actually dared ignore my charm\u2026 You\u2019re dead\u2026 Liz thought hatefully as she turned around slowly and sat back in her car.Hum!The sports car\u2019s engine roared like the rage in her heart. The red sports car was like an unbridled mare on the plains as it drove straight for Zhou Wen who was by the side of the road.Since soft tactics didn\u2019t work, Liz decided to switch tactics. She planned on taking Zhou Wen back with her by creating an accident.Controlling the strength and spot to hit with a car was nothing for a peak-Legendary like Liz. If she wanted his left leg broken, there was no way his right leg would be broken.I planned on having you comfortably return with me, but you just insisted on doing it the hard way. Liz floored the accelerator pedal as strange patterns surfaced over her skin. Faint swirls of light extended from her body and enveloped the car.Her eyes flickered with excitement. She didn\u2019t believe that she would miss; given the close distance, the car\u2019s speed, her maneuvering, and Zhou Wen\u2019s engrossment in his game.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t seem to notice. He remained gaming, even when the sports car was very close to him. However, when the car ramped up the curb, Zhou Wen finally reacted and saw the sports car slamming towards him.It\u2019s too late to notice it now. Liz floored the accelerator in hate as she slammed over with the car.Just as she was about to succeed, Zhou Wen\u2019s back suddenly grew four transparent silver wings and a silver stream of light flashed over the silver wings. Zhou Wen\u2019s figure instantly retreated in violation of the ordinary laws of physics, dodging the sports car.Bang!The sports car missed Zhou Wen and collided with an electricity pole by the side of the road. While the pole snapped, the car\u2019s head was dented. Components were left flying everywhere.\u201cHello? Is this the traffic police? There\u2019s an accident here\u2026\u201d Zhou Wen took out his ordinary phone and called the police hotline.Liz glared at Zhou Wen viciously and reversed the car onto the road. Then, she sped off in a blink of an eye.What\u2019s the brand of that car? The quality is so good. How can it still be driven after such a collision? Zhou Wen watched in astonishment as the sports car vanished from his sight, leaving a gloomy look in his eyes.Clearly, the sports car was targeting him instead of just having an accident. Furthermore, he had already recognized the female driver. On the night he had met Jing Daoxian, she was one of those pursuing the latter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since they were pursuing Jing Daoxian, it makes them either League civil servants or soldiers. But why would they drive a car to knock over an ordinary League citizen?Zhou Wen secretly frowned as he thought, I didn\u2019t have any relationship with Jing Daoxian. Could it be that those people know that Jing Daoxian gave me the Lost Immortal Sutra and have treated me as his accomplice?The more he thought about the matter, the more he found it serious. From the actions the woman had taken, those people wouldn\u2019t stop at anything.Without managing to buy his items, Zhou Wen directly turned back and gave Li Xuan a call.\u201cZhou Wen, how rare it is for you to call me,\u201d Li Xuan teased. The phone call was affected by the noisy din\u2014a result of loud music and shouting.\u201cFind somewhere quiet. I have something to say to you,\u201d Zhou Wen said.\u201cWait a moment. Don\u2019t hang up.\u201d After a while, the phone turned silent. Li Xuan\u2019s voice then sounded. \u201cYou can tell me what\u2019s up now.\u201d\u201cIs there a way for me to be matriculated now?\u201d After racking his brains, Zhou Wen believed that matriculating was the only viable solution.After the dimensional storms, the institute was different from the universities of the past. It was especially so with Sunset College. It had close ties and history with the military and was considered a ministry department. In a law-by-law situation, it was impossible for one to enter Sunset College to apprehend someone.Sunset College was a partially-restricted school. As long as he didn\u2019t leave campus, outsiders were unable to drive into him like today.Furthermore, with the other party being so fearless, he believed that there was a chance of implicating Li Xuan if he continued to stay at his place.\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll settle it immediately. Can you tell me what happened? Just pretend I didn\u2019t ask if you can\u2019t.\u201dZhou Wen had no intention of hiding the matter as he explained all that had happened, apart from his conversation with Jing Daoxian and how the Lost Immortal Sutra had been forced on him.\u201cHoly sh*t, you actually met Jing Daoxian?\u201d Li Xuan exclaimed.\u201cI wish I had never met him. I\u2019ve attracted so much trouble simply from meeting him once,\u201d Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile.Li Xuan pondered for a moment before saying solemnly, \u201cWait at home for me. I\u2019ll head back immediately. It\u2019s best we don\u2019t talk about certain topics over the phone.\u201dAfter hanging up, Zhou Wen returned to Li Xuan\u2019s place and waited for him to return.\u201cIf my guess isn\u2019t wrong, the woman who was pursuing Jing Daoxian, and attempted to run you over in the car, likely comes from the Special Inspector Bureau.\u201d\u201cWhat department is the Special Inspector Bureau? Does it come under the military or the police?\u201d Zhou Wen had never heard of such a department.\u201cNeither,\u201d Li Xuan said with a shake of his head. \u201cThis department specializes in special cases. It has great authority and autonomy, so they often carry out operations that do not come under the legal process. It can almost be described as unscrupulous. It does many sordid things that get covered up. There\u2019s a lot of disagreement regarding the existence of this department in the League with many people hating it. They call the people in the department hyenas.\u201dZhou Wen wore a heavy look. From the name \u2018hyenas,\u2019 he knew what kind of people this department comprised of.Hyenas were the most scheming, filthy, dirty animals in the natural world. To achieve their goal, they did anything, not releasing their grip once they bit down hard. Furthermore, they always appeared in packs.\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to matriculate early. Although the Special Inspector Bureau has great authority, they are unable to flout the law openly. They can only covertly do certain deeds. It won\u2019t be easy for them to deal with you when you stay on campus. However, there\u2019s a need to resolve this matter ultimately. Otherwise, they will keep biting down on you and something bad will ultimately come out of it.\u201dLi Xuan thought before continuing, \u201cStay on campus now. I\u2019ll discuss it with my father. He should be able to find people from the Special Inspector Bureau to figure out why they are targeting you. If it\u2019s nothing too serious, we can try to think of means to resolve this matter once and for all.\u201dZhou Wen didn\u2019t reject Li Xuan\u2019s offer for help, but he didn\u2019t place all his hopes on him.Strength. I need greater strength. If I was as powerful as Jing Daoxian, would I be afraid of a mere Special Inspector Bureau? A cold glint flashed in Zhou Wen\u2019s eyes.He could sense that the woman didn\u2019t want his life. However, the outrageous attempt to run him over was something he wouldn\u2019t forgive even if the Special Inspector Bureau were to close the case.Li Xuan quickly finished the matriculation procedure. He claimed that since he had nothing better to do at home, he decided to matriculate early with Zhou Wen.However, Li Xuan wore an odd expression when he told Zhou Wen about the matter. \u201cI originally wanted to pull strings so that we could get allocated to the same dorm. But the school\u2019s side said that your dorm has already been assigned\u2014Four Seasons Garden.\u201d\u201cIs there something wrong with Four Seasons Garden?\u201d Zhou Wen had guessed that it was the dorm that Ouyang Lan was referring to. However, he had no idea why Li Xuan wore such an odd expression.\u201cFour Seasons Garden is a place where special admissions students live. They are quite different from the typical student. You were admitted just like me and not a special admit, so why were you allocated Four Seasons Garden?\u201d Li Xuan chuckled. \u201cFrom the looks of it, you have quite an extraordinary relationship with the An family. Can you help me get one at Four Seasons Garden?\u201d\u201cIf you wish to live there, can\u2019t you just live with me? But, how are you certain that it has to do with the An family?\u201d Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you aren\u2019t aware? Sunset College was originally spearheaded and established by the An family. Although it\u2019s a public school in name, the An family has greater say than the League President inside Sunset College.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Zhou Wen never expected that Sunset College had such a connection with the An family.\u201cYou actually weren\u2019t aware? Then what relationship do you have with the Ans?\u201d Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen with a suspicious look. If Zhou Wen really had a close relationship with them, how was it that he didn\u2019t know about it?Feeling that there was no point in hiding this matter from Li Xuan, Zhou Wen said, \u201cZhou Lingfeng is my father.\u201dPfft! Li Xuan spewed out all the water that he had just drunk as he widened his eyes and looked at Zhou Wen. \u201cYou are Zhou Lingfeng\u2019s son? That makes Overseer An your stepmother. An Jing and An Tianzuo are your step-siblings? Holy sh*t, you have a huge backer with the An family or Overseer An. Why are you afraid of the Special Inspector Bureau? Once you live with the An family, even if the minister of the Special Inspector Bureau were to come, he wouldn\u2019t even dare touch you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s them. I\u2019m me. My surname isn\u2019t An, so we aren\u2019t considered family. I only wish to coexist with them peacefully. It\u2019s best if we each mind our own business.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too stubborn. If I were you, I\u2019d wheedle my way into Ouyang Lan\u2019s good books. When that happens, I\u2019d have whatever I want,\u201d Li Xuan joked.\u201cHowever, Four Seasons Garden is nice too. It will be difficult for the Special Inspector Bureau to deal with you if you were to live there,\u201d Li Xuan said, feeling relaxed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But what did you do? You tried to run him over with a car! Have I been too lax on all of you recently that you\u2019ve forgotten how to abide by the rules?\u201d Qiao Siyuan said calmly, but his eyes were rather cold.Liz trembled as she quickly stood up and bowed. \u201cSir, I was derelict in my duty. It was thankfully not detected by the Ans. Please give me another chance. I\u2019ll definitely bring Zhou Wen back.\u201d\u201cNot detected?\u201d Qiao Siyuan placed a document dossier on the desk and said calmly, \u201cTake a look at this.\u201d\u201cThis is?\u201d Liz opened the dossier in puzzlement and was alarmed when she read its contents. \u201cHow is this possible? It\u2019s impossible, right? Sir, is the information in here real?\u201dQiao Siyuan shot a look at Liz and said slowly, \u201cI had a feeling that Ouyang Lan\u2019s marriage with Zhou Lingfeng was odd. I felt that it might be connected to that matter, so I deliberately requested my teacher to help me investigate the An family\u2019s candidate. This was the outcome my teacher gave me. Do you think it could be wrong?\u201d\u201cNaturally not!\u201d The alarmed look on Liz\u2019s face became more pronounced. \u201cBut isn\u2019t the An family\u2019s candidate An Jing? Why did it turn into Zhou Wen? He has zero blood relations with the An family and isn\u2019t even half a son. Why would the An family give such a huge opportunity to an outsider?\u201d\u201cThat I do not know, but I can be sure that after Zhou Wen was admitted into Sunset College, the An family indeed changed their candidate\u2019s name from An Jing to Zhou Wen. And based on the regulations, the An family only has one chance of changing their candidate. Even if Zhou Wen were to die, it would be impossible to change it to anyone else.\u201dHaving said that, Qiao Siyuan glared at Liz with a burning gaze. \u201cDo you still believe that the An family is completely unaware of your little accident with Zhou Wen?\u201dLiz broke out into a cold sweat as she bowed her head. \u201cSir, I\u2019m aware of my mistakes. I\u2019m fully prepared for any punishment.\u201dShe knew very well how important Zhou Wen now was to the An family. It was impossible for them not to know of such a person being hit by a car in Luoyang. If they really were so oblivious to such developments, they would have long been cleanly devoured by others.\u201cConsidering how you were only recently transferred to the Special Inspector Bureau and aren\u2019t aware of how we run things here, I\u2019ll let this pass. Don\u2019t repeat this a second time,\u201d Qiao Siyuan said.\u201cSir, please give me an opportunity to make up for my mistakes,\u201d Liz requested.\u201cNot now. Zhou Wen has already headed for Sunset College early. If there\u2019s no reasonable excuse, it won\u2019t be that easy to invite him over. I have other arrangements, so stay out of this matter,\u201d Qiao Siyuan said with a wave of his hand.Liz said with an odd expression, \u201cI really find it unbelievable that the Ans would switch their candidate to Zhou Wen. Even if Ouyang Lan were blinded by love and couldn\u2019t be bothered about the opportunity for her daughter, how could they be agreeable to giving this opportunity to Zhou Wen? How is it possible for An Tianzuo to agree? This opportunity should belong to the Ans!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to waste your efforts trying to understand something you don\u2019t. Just do what you\u2019re supposed to do. You are dismissed.\u201d Qiao Siyuan waved his hand, an indication that Liz should leave. He then picked up the dossier and muttered to himself while reading it, \u201cWhat\u2019s the An family up to? How\u2019s it possible for them to give such a huge opportunity to an outsider? Could it be that Ouyang Lan gave away this opportunity because she doesn\u2019t want her daughter to take the risk? But with An Jing\u2019s talent, the chances of her succeeding is rather high. It wouldn\u2019t be considered risky. Is Jing Daoxian\u2019s encounter with Zhou Wen, and the way he abnormally remained in the vicinity, purely coincidental?\u201dAfter Zhou Wen and Li Xuan had completed the matriculation paperwork, the latter chose not to stay in Four Seasons Garden with Zhou Wen. Therefore, Zhou Wen headed to the specially designed region like a park, alone, with the dormitory card Ouyang Lan had given him.There were rows of two-storied buildings which weren\u2019t too big. They were minimalistic and simple and each building came with a tiny yard.The yard didn\u2019t have any walls. They were just surrounded by a white wooden fence that was half an adult\u2019s height, allowing people to clearly see into their neighbors compound.702. It should be this one. Zhou Wen stood in front of a small building by following the dormitory card. He looked around and realized that this was the last row in Four Seasons Garden. There were three buildings in this row, and his building was in the middle. The building on the left seemed uninhabited and the right building\u2019s yard had some plants grown with the soil still moist. It was likely inhabited by someone.Zhou Wen thought of pushing the door open to enter when he heard the door open on the building to his right. Then, he saw a figure walk out.An Jing? Zhou Wen was taken aback when he identified the figure.An Jing was equally taken aback, clearly not expecting to meet Zhou Wen here.However, she instantly understood what was happening. Biting her lip, she ignored Zhou Wen and left her yard.Since An Jing had ignored him, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t plan on being chummy with her. Without a word, the two pretended as though they hadn\u2019t seen the other.After entering the building with his dormitory card, Zhou Wen found the place excellent. Although the layout and renovations were simple, they were very suitable for cultivation. It even came equipped with Strength-measuring devices and other useful tools.A new beginning. Seems pretty good. After Zhou Wen surveyed the entire building, he planned on buying some necessities first.Although the building was furnished, it didn\u2019t come with blankets or other personal belongings. It still required Zhou Wen to buy them himself.Previously, Li Xuan had taken him to the entrance of Four Seasons Garden. However, attempting to walk out himself, he realized how ridiculously huge Sunset College was. Although it wasn\u2019t big to the point of getting lost, Zhou Wen still took several detours due to the inaccurate navigation on his phone.Furthermore, he wasn\u2019t aware of where he could buy daily necessities on campus.As he walked, he found himself in an increasingly remote and isolated area. Just as he was about to ask around for directions, he realized that he was surrounded by old, dilapidated buildings\u2014likely old teaching buildings that had been abandoned.How is the GPS tracking so ridiculously wrong? Zhou Wen looked at the map on his phone in exasperation.Just as he was about to turn back, he heard voices from a bend ahead.I should ask for directions. Zhou Wen took a few steps forward, planning to ask the talking person about the location of the on-campus supermarket.\u201cLittle Mei, you have to be good. Work hard in the future.\u201d Zhou Wen heard a man\u2019s voice around the bend and found it somewhat familiar. However, he wasn\u2019t able to immediately put the voice to a face.As he was thinking, Zhou Wen turned the corner and saw in the corner of a dilapidated building nearby, a towering figure. He had his hands raised high, raising a petite and adorable kitten. His eyes wore a warm look as he suffused a smile. However, that face still looked as ferocious as a devil despite smiling. It left anyone who laid their eyes on him afraid.Gu Dian? Zhou Wen was momentarily left rooted to the ground. He couldn\u2019t put Gu Dian with this man who was warmly smiling and raising a kitten high up.Likewise, Gu Dian noticed Zhou Wen. When his eyes locked with Zhou Wen with him raising the kitten, the atmosphere between them immediately became odd.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Two of them were kittens and one of them was an adult. Clearly, this group of four was a family. The mother cat was sunbathing in the sun with her three kittens.By the side of the grass patch were two bowls. One of them had water in it and the other had cat food. It was obvious that they had been prepared by Gu Dian.After putting down the kitten, the look in Gu Dian\u2019s eyes turned extremely cold. He glared at Zhou Wen like a devil and coldly said, \u201cYou\u2019re dead if I hear any rumors spreading.\u201dHis devil-like looks and bone-chilling voice would probably frighten Zhou Wen at any other time. However, the scene of Gu Dian raising the kitten high kept flashing across his eyes. Zhou Wen just couldn\u2019t bring himself to feel any fear.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not a gossipy person.\u201d\u201cThat better be the case,\u201d Gu Dian said coldly. Ignoring Zhou Wen, he bent down and picked up the two bowls. After taking another glance at the four cats who were frolicking on the grass, he turned and left.After taking a few steps, Gu Dian stopped and said without turning his head. \u201cAlso, don\u2019t you attempt to harm them; otherwise, you\u2019re dead.\u201dAfter saying that, Gu Dian took huge strides and left.Li Xuan said that not only does Gu Dian look fierce, but that he\u2019s extremely bad. It\u2019s said that he\u2019s willing to do anything awful as long as he\u2019s paid. Now from the looks of it, he might not be as bad as the rumors say. To be so close to cats which are naturally wary of others, to the point of letting him get so close to the kittens, he\u2019s probably not as evil as the rumors say. Zhou Wen glanced at the four cats and thought to himself.In present times, animals like dogs and cats were no longer as cherished as in the past. After all, they were only for aesthetics. In contrast, Companion Beasts had magical powers. People were more willing to spend money on them.In the past, all kinds of valuable pet cats and dogs had mostly turned into strays. They were no longer doted on by humans.With the time changing, many things changed as well. In the past, figures who could fly or have tremendous strength were extolled for being capable of becoming Legendaries. Their tales were spread to this day because few humans in the past had such powers.But in this day and age, it wasn\u2019t difficult to have tremendous strength if one could advance to the Legendary stage. Now, almost everyone could become as legendary as those people from the past since the Legendary stage was no longer rare. As long as one cultivated hard, they would definitely advance to the Legendary stage as long as they weren\u2019t without any aptitude.However, to advance from the Legendary stage to the Epic stage wasn\u2019t simple. This required talent, Primordial Energy Arts, resources, and the combination of all kinds of factors. It wasn\u2019t achievable simply through hard work.After all, those people who had their names put into the annals of history to be extolled in poems and songs were basically close to mythical existences.Back when Zhou Wen cultivated Ascetic Meditation, he had planned on advancing to the Legendary stage during college. Such a speed made him a genius among humans.However, his Ascetic Meditation had already been replaced by the Legendary stage. To advance to the Legendary stage with the Lost Immortal Sutra wasn\u2019t a simple endeavor to begin with.Zhou Wen had been repeatedly studying Lost Immortal Sutra recently and he discovered that it was very different from the typical Primordial Energy Art.In typical Primordial Energy Arts like Ascetic Meditation, advancement was in fact breaking one\u2019s shackles. Humans had the limits of their Strength, Speed, Constitution, and Primordial Energy shackled, so consuming no amount of supplements was of any use. The stats just wouldn\u2019t continue rising.Only after breaking those shackles would a human\u2019s upper limits be unlocked. While being able to continue raising one\u2019s stats, one would also obtain a Life Providence that was related to one\u2019s aptitude. It was commonly known as Legendary Life Providence.However, after Zhou Wen\u2019s repeated studies of the Lost Immortal Sutra, he didn\u2019t see any descriptions regarding the breaking of those shackles.Therefore, Zhou Wen still hadn\u2019t figured out how he could use the Lost Immortal Sutra to advance to the Legendary stage.After going through quite a hassle to find the on-campus supermarket and buying the daily necessities he needed, he returned to his dorm to unpack it. Once he was done with all of that, he then began grinding.Since it was unlikely for him to have any progress with Ant Nest any time soon, Zhou Wen chose to enter the Underground Buddha City.He spent some time grinding the Buddha Heart Lotuses at the lotus pond, but not a single Companion Beast dropped. Instead, his Mutated Skeleton Ant was devoured by the gargantuan blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus.Zhou Wen then controlled the blood-colored avatar to Small Buddha Temple. Before climbing up the stone steps, Zhou Wen got the blood-colored avatar to activate his Primordial Energy Skill\u2014Heart Meditation.The stretch of road in front of Small Buddha Temple was extremely bizarre. Death seemed to be the only outcome no matter how he traversed it. He still hadn\u2019t found the reason why that was the case.Using Heart Meditation was a last-ditch effort. He felt that since Heart Meditation came from the Buddha Heart Lotus, it was possible that using it worked.To Zhou Wen\u2019s surprise, the blood-colored avatar, which would usually die once it arrived at a spot where it could see the Small Buddha Temple\u2019s signboard, didn\u2019t die this time. It could still move higher and progress forward.Does Heart Meditation really work? Even Zhou Wen was surprised.He made the blood-colored avatar proceed forward and indeed, nothing happened the entire way. However, Heart Meditation was a Primordial Energy Skill which expended Primordial Energy while it was in use, at a rate of two points a minute.By climbing up the stone steps in such a way, there was still quite a distance from Small Buddha Temple before his Primordial Energy was completely drained.The moment Heart Meditation wasn\u2019t in effect, the blood-colored avatar collapsed to the ground and the game\u2019s screen went black.Since he knew that Heart Meditation worked, Zhou Wen eagerly revived the blood-colored avatar and made it come in front of the Small Buddha Temple\u2019s stone passageway.Zhou Wen activated Heart Meditation and made the blood-colored avatar run towards the Small Buddha Temple at full speed. However, it died once again when its Primordial Energy was drained about ten meters away from its destination.With my present speed, the time Heart Meditation can be in effect isn\u2019t enough for me to rush into Small Buddha Temple. Do I have to wait until I\u2019ve advanced to the Legendary stage and have plenty of Primordial Energy before I can rush in with Heart Meditation? But I\u2019ve no idea how long it will take before I advance to the Legendary stage\u2026Primordial Energy Skills like Heart Meditation that continuously expend Primordial Energy expend less Primordial Energy at higher ranks. I wonder if it\u2019s the same with Heart Meditation? Currently, Heart Meditation is at Rank 7. If I can grind a Rank 8 or Rank 9 Heart Meditation, perhaps I might have a chance of entering Small Buddha Temple.Since he had nothing else to do, Zhou Wen continued grinding Buddha Heart Lotuses with a try-and-see attitude, hoping to receive something.After repeated grinding, Zhou Wen realized a pattern. The blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus was always submerged underwater in the beginning. Only after Zhou Wen cleaved some of the Buddha Heart Lotuses around the middle of the lotus pond would the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus rise above the water surface in rage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he died plenty of times, it wasn\u2019t without return.Zhou Wen was rather familiar with the few moves available to the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus\u2014knowledge he had gained from repeated deaths. Although he was temporarily unable to slay it, he knew of a way to kill it. He just wasn\u2019t powerful enough; thus, preventing him from actualizing his strategies.\u201cZhou Wen, quickly get up. It\u2019s great that we matriculated early. Otherwise, we would have missed a great show.\u201d Li Xuan called him on the phone early in the morning.\u201cWhat great show?\u201d Zhou Wen put down the phone and stretched before asking.\u201cDidn\u2019t I mention that the Legendary stage students are purchasing powerful Companion Beasts capable of flight? They plan on slaying the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus today. Let\u2019s head over to take a look,\u201d Li Xuan suggested.\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhou Wen was also interested in watching battles at the Legendary stage.He got out of bed, washed up, and headed out, meeting Li Xuan at the entrance of the Four Seasons Garden.Li Xuan had clearly been waiting for a while, pulling him to head for Ancient Inlet the moment he saw Zhou Wen come out. As they ran, he said, \u201cQuick! We\u2019ll miss the show if we are late.\u201dZhou Wen learned from Li Xuan that the person who planned on killing the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus was a famous third-year senior in Sunset College, Yang Lie. He was a mighty figure who had advanced to the Legendary stage.Apparently, he had spent a large sum of money buying Legendary Companion Eggs and had tried means to speed up the incubation in order to slay the blood-colored Buddha Heart Lotus. As soon as that was done, he rushed for the lotus pond.After the two entered Underground Buddha City, they rushed to the lotus pond, where there were many students surrounding the pond. They had clearly heard the news and were here to watch Yang Lie battle the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.Just as the duo arrived, a man ran over.\u201cBrother Xuan, Brother Wen!\u201d\u201cXu Miantu, you also applied for Sunset College?\u201d Zhou Wen recognized the person.Xu Miantu scratched his head in embarrassment, seemingly unable to verbalize his reasons. By the side, Li Xuan scolded him in a bemused state, \u201cDude, just say it. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s something disgraceful. In fact, Xu Miantu should have been matriculated last year. However, to help me in the examination, he deferred his application to Sunset College by one year.\u201dXu Miantu chuckled and said, \u201cA genius like Brother Xuan didn\u2019t even need my help. I was just ignorant.\u201dJust as the trio began having a conversation, they heard an uproar.\u201cAn Jing\u2019s here.\u201d\u201cAn Jing from the An family?\u201d\u201cWho else could it be? Tsk, she indeed lives up to the rumors. She\u2019s really a beauty.\u201d\u201cI heard that she advanced to the Legendary stage at the age of thirteen. She\u2019s extremely talented and she comes from a formidable family. She has the money, the talent, and the looks. It\u2019s like the Creator favored her when creating her.\u201dZhou Wen traced the students\u2019 gaze and looked over. Indeed, he saw An Jing arriving on a white horse. However, it didn\u2019t have any wings, so it wasn\u2019t a White-Winged Flying Horse.Yang Lie, who had been surrounded by people, walked over to An Jing.This gave Zhou Wen a chance to see him. He stood at more than 1.80 meters. His sword-like brows and starry eyes made him look sharp. Beside him was a black leopard with one eye, making it look extremely odd.\u201cAn Jing, you came just in time. Regardless of what drops today when I slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, I\u2019ll be giving it to you as a matriculation gift,\u201d Yang Lie said with a spirited look.Many students revealed a teasing smile when they heard him. It was obvious that Yang Lie was expressing his interest in An Jing.However, Li Xuan said in contempt, \u201cAlthough the Yang family is rather famous in Luoyang, it\u2019s not of the upper class. Besides, they have many businesses that rely on the An family\u2019s power in Luoyang. This punk is probably up to no good by expressing his interest in An Jing. However, it\u2019s probably in vain. No matter how blind the An family is, they wouldn\u2019t fancy the Yang family.\u201d\u201cBrother Xuan, I believe you are the only one qualified to be with An Jing in all of Luoyang,\u201d Xu Miantu said with a chuckle.Li Xuan spat at that thought and said, \u201cAn Jing is an arrogant woman. She also has a bad temper. That cold demeanor of hers isn\u2019t fun at all, so it\u2019s useless no matter how beautiful she is. Only an idiot will marry a woman like her.\u201dWith that said, Li Xuan glanced at Zhou Wen and said with a mysterious, furtive smile, \u201cBesides, I understand the rationale of not hitting on a friend\u2019s sister.\u201dZhou Wen couldn\u2019t be bothered to refute and he pretended not to hear it.Xu Miantu had no idea of Zhou Wen\u2019s relationship with the An family, so he failed to understand what Li Xuan meant. Puzzled, he looked at them blankly.An Jing sat on the white horse with no intention of getting off. She said in a calm tone, \u201cI don\u2019t need any gifts. Besides, you won\u2019t be able to slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus either.\u201dYang Lie wasn\u2019t angry when he heard that. Instead, he guffawed and said, \u201cThen let\u2019s have a bet. Why don\u2019t you accept my present if I succeed in slaying the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d An Jing replied without any hesitation.\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of losing?\u201d Yang Lie said provocatively.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, so the bet can\u2019t even be established. There\u2019s no need for it.\u201d After An Jing said that, she rode the white horse to the side of the lotus pond.Yang Lie felt embarrassed, but due to her extremely special identity, he didn\u2019t dare flare up at her.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll show you that I\u2019m capable of slaying the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus,\u201d Yang Lie said. He spread his arms and two Companion Beasts were summoned out by him.They were two Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks, but they were much larger than the typical hawk. Their wingspans reached more than ten meters and with a flap, they shot out like a golden beam of light. They then spiraled above the lotus pond like two golden clouds.A Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk swooped down and extended its claws like a phantom, instantly grabbing a Buddha Heart Lotus.\u201cSilver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk. And there\u2019s two of them. This fellow sure is willing to make the investment,\u201d Li Xuan curled his lips and said.Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks were rare Legendary Companion Beasts. They were only found in the dimensional zones of the Heavenly Lake of the Heavenly Mountain. However, there were many dimensional zones in the Heavenly Mountain\u2019s vicinity, so it wasn\u2019t easy to reach the Heavenly Lake itself. Furthermore, Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks were rare in number. They also lived on cliffs, making it difficult to kill them and have a Companion Egg drop.If one\u2019s luck wasn\u2019t good, even experts at the Epic stage would return empty-handed.Seeing the students look at his pair of Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks in envy, Yang Lie felt slightly pleased with himself. Without any hesitation, he ordered the hawks to attack the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.When they rushed at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus from the flanks, the latter sensed the threat and shot out twenty to thirty blood-colored lotus seeds that hurtled towards the two hawks.As the blood-colored lotus seeds were about to hit the hawks, they showed no intention of dodging. They continued flying forward and released a golden glow over their feathers as though they were emitting light themselves.Boom! Boom!When the blood-colored lotus seeds exploded on the golden feathers and splattered into bloody water, they rolled off as if the golden feathers were nonstick. The hawks weren\u2019t damaged at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They are truly extraordinary. It appears this blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus will likely be slain by Yang Lie,\u201d Li Xuan said.Zhou Wen shook his head and whispered, \u201cNot necessarily. The blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus can\u2019t be slain by just two Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks.\u201dZhou Wen\u2019s research on the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus was nothing these students could compare with. He was acutely aware of how powerful the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus was. It was impossible to slay it with just two Legendary Companion Beasts capable of flight.Perhaps intentionally or unintentionally, An Jing happened to shoot Zhou Wen a look when he said those words.Li Xuan was just about to ask why when the lotus pond experienced an anomaly. One of the Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk rushed right in front of the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus and was swallowed by the latter\u2019s petals that opened like a gaping mouth.Just as the other Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk was about touch the petals with its talons that were glimmering in gold light, the blood patterns on the petals-a sitting Buddha-shot out beams of sanguine light. What seemed like a fragile petal remained undamaged after clashing with the hawk\u2019s talons.When the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus opened its petals again, the Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk which had been devoured was reduced to bone. Furthermore, the bones were rapidly melting.The students watching this battle gasped. It was shocking that the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus could devour the Legendary Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk and instantly corrode its bones.It even managed to resist the Golden Halo Talons of the Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk, a Primordial Energy Skill. It was quite shocking.Flower-type dimensional creatures typically were rather weak in Constitution. Amongst dimensional creatures of the same stage, their Constitution usually lined the bottom.However, the fact that this blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus was able to withstand a powerful Legendary Primordial Energy Skill like Golden Halo Talons made it terrifying. It overturned the average person\u2019s understanding of flower-type creatures.Yang Lie\u2019s expression was livid. He didn\u2019t dare order his Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk to continue attacking as he summoned the surviving one back.All the students looked at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with fear and greed. It clearly had more than one Primordial Energy Skill. If it dropped as a Companion Beast, they could possess a Companion Beast with more than one Primordial Energy Skill.However, the chances of Companion Beasts dropping were low to begin with. Furthermore, with Yang Lie\u2019s two Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks suffering a defeat, it meant that no student could currently kill it.\u201cHow did you know that the two Hawks weren\u2019t a match for the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus?\u201d Only then did Li Xuan have the chance to ask the question that was eating at him.\u201cIt was obvious to the eye.\u201d Zhou Wen shrugged, preparing to leave the area. It was unlikely that the students could kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus anytime soon. This lotus flower was probably a top existence among Legendary creatures. Unless one had even more powerful Companion Beasts or was capable of targeting its weak points, even a siege against it wouldn\u2019t be of much use.\u201cBrother Wen, since you were able to tell that the Hawks weren\u2019t the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s match, doesn\u2019t that mean that you have the means to kill it?\u201d Xu Miantu\u2019s eyes lit up as he asked Zhou Wen.Xu Miantu wasn\u2019t much to speak of. He wasn\u2019t a bad man either, but he was someone who shot his mouth off. He hadn\u2019t suppressed his voice, allowing people around them to hear him.Yang Lie was already in a bad mood, so when he heard Xu Miantu, he turned his head and saw that it was Li Xuan, Xu Miantu, and an unfamiliar youth, he immediately felt even more infuriated.Li Xuan was well known to be a foppish person in Luoyang. Together with an adopted son of the Li family, Xu Miantu, Yang Lie naturally knew how much they amounted to. It could even be said that he viewed them with contempt.Yang Lie often imagined that if he were Li Xuan and had all the resources of the Li family, he would be able to achieve so much more.Xu Miantu\u2019s unintentional question sounded like a mockery to Yang Lie.\u201cTo be able to tell at a glance that the hawks aren\u2019t the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s match. Not a bad eye. Might I know how you should be addressed?\u201d Yang Lie held back his anger and asked Zhou Wen as he sized him up.Although he was angry, he wasn\u2019t willing to offend students with significant backing. After all, the students of Sunset College were the elites of East District. Many of them had strong backers.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t say a word, but Xu Miantu drummed up support for him. \u201cZhou Wen got second in the combat test of Guide City. He\u2019s the number one genius of Guide High School. He\u2019s Brother Xuan\u2019s buddy!\u201dXu Miantu didn\u2019t brag emptily but was trying to use this opportunity to make Zhou Wen known to all, making students of Sunset College know of his existence.This brought about plenty of benefits. In the future, when they formed teams to enter dimensional zones to complete the missions handed out by the school, other strong students would be willing to team up with Zhou Wen.Otherwise, if Zhou Wen was unknown to everyone, how would those strong students be willing to team up with him? It was already a very common way of societal thinking for the strong to ally together.However, those who heard Xu Miantu looked at him and Zhou Wen with a look of mockery. It wasn\u2019t only Yang Lie, but all the other students as well.Many students in Sunset College had the accolades of being the number one genius of so-and-so high school or first in the combat test of so-and-so city. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had only gotten second place. Others weren\u2019t even interested in who got first place, much less second place.If it were first place in places like Beijing, people might have paid some attention. However, a tiny city like Guide City wasn\u2019t worth paying any attention to.When Yang Lie heard that Zhou Wen had come in second at the Guide City\u2019s combat test, he knew that Zhou Wen likely didn\u2019t have much of a background. Otherwise, he would have obtained first place. Only those who obtained the first place of a city could receive certain privileges and resources from the Sunset College. This was also one of the reasons why Li Xuan needed to get first.\u201cSecond place. That\u2019s pretty impressive,\u201d Yang Lie quipped. \u201cIn that case, I would like to know what amazing strategy you have to kill that blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.\u201dThe other students could naturally tell that Yang Lie was being sarcastic. They were freshmen and only at the Mortal stage. They weren\u2019t even close to the Legendary stage, so it was obvious that they didn\u2019t have the qualifications to kill top Legendary creatures like the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.Xu Miantu couldn\u2019t tolerate the treatment as he curled his lips and said in disdain, \u201cAre you a fool or do you think of us as fools? Why should we tell you the strategy we\u2019ve come up with?\u201dEver since the battle at Guide Ancient City, Xu Miantu was truly impressed with Zhou Wen. He strongly believed that Zhou Wen had the means to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Since it was a given, he naturally wouldn\u2019t tell others of the strategy.But his words only amused Yang Lie. \u201cAlright. There\u2019s no need to tell me. Don\u2019t you have the strategy? Isn\u2019t being second in Guide City impressive? Fine then, slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Please broaden our horizons.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a fervent look of encouragement in it.Zhou Wen could only smile wryly in secret. Xu Miantu had thought too highly of him. He didn\u2019t have the strength to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus at present. All he could do was slightly shake his head at Xu Miantu.However, Xu Miantu had full confidence in him. Believing that Zhou Wen was only being humble, he continued encouraging him. \u201cBrother Wen, there\u2019s no need to be overly humble in a place like Sunset College. You have to showcase your absolute strength. This will give you the opportunity to obtain more resources.\u201dZhou Wen felt a little depressed. He did wish to slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, but he really wasn\u2019t capable of doing so at present.Seeing Zhou Wen show a stumped look, Yang Lie sneered and said, \u201cOne needs to have the strength to actually showcase it. Otherwise, they will only be a joke.\u201dAfter saying that, Yang Lie ignored Xu Miantu and turned to walk to An Jing.From Yang Lie\u2019s point of view, he would only disgrace himself if he continued embroiling himself with Xu Miantu, Li Xuan, and Zhou Wen.Although Xu Miantu didn\u2019t wish to let it go, he was helpless when he saw Zhou Wen remain silent. All he could do was watch the supercilious look Yang Lie had while turning around.Yang Lie came in front of An Jing and said in a very gentlemanly manner, \u201cI lost the bet. If you have anything you need me to do, I\u2019ll definitely give my all. However, I\u2019m curious why you knew that the Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks weren\u2019t the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s match? Could it be that you\u2019ve already fought it before?\u201d\u201cFirst, I\u2019d said that the bet was completely meaningless. Neither do I have anything I need you to do. I am equally capable of doing what you are capable of. If I can\u2019t do it, it only makes it impossible for you to do it. Second, those who are truly in the know do not need to engage in a fight to know who\u2019s stronger.\u201d An Jing wore a calm look, but every word she said was biting.Zhou Wen suspected that with her vicious tongue, she might have been beaten up by many if she hadn\u2019t been born into the An family.Indeed, Yang Lie wore a rather embarrassed look. His face oscillated between blue and white. He was a student who wasn\u2019t even twenty years old, so he wasn\u2019t thick-skinned enough.\u201cWell said.\u201d Xu Miantu took this opportunity and cheered. This only made Yang Lie glare at him hatefully.An Jing ignored him and rode her white horse, brushing past Yang Lie\u2019s shoulder. She headed for Zhou Wen.\u201cYour sister is coming over,\u201d Li Xuan whispered as he nudged Zhou Wen with his elbow.Zhou Wen shook his head, gesturing to Li Xuan to cut the nonsense. However, before he could say a thing, An Jing had already arrived in front of him.When Yang Lie and the other students saw An Jing standing in front of Zhou Wen, all of them cast their gazes over, curious as to what she wanted.An Jing stared into Zhou Wen\u2019s eyes and asked, \u201cDo you have the confidence in slaying the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus?\u201d\u201cIt definitely won\u2019t be a problem. An Jing, let\u2019s work together to slay this blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Brother Wen will definitely not let you down.\u201d Xu Miantu didn\u2019t know the relationship between An Jing and Zhou Wen. Imagining that An Jing was interested in Zhou Wen, he believed that Zhou Wen might be able to sweep her off her feet if he did well.Furthermore, this beauty\u2019s family was extraordinary. She was the daughter of Luoyang\u2019s An family. She was practically a princess in Luoyang.\u201cIs that right? Brother Wen?\u201d Xu Miantu nudged Zhou Wen as he winked at him while his back was facing An Jing. His meaning was clear-he wanted Zhou Wen to do a good job.Although Zhou Wen knew that Xu Miantu had good intentions, he really couldn\u2019t do it. All he wanted was to game in peace and he had no intention of stealing the limelight here. Involving himself with An Jing was the last thing he wished to do.\u201cYou really have wild ideas. If An Jing really wants to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, would you have even have a chance?\u201d Yang Lie already detested Xu Miantu, so he couldn\u2019t help but shoot off a snide remark. He vented all the pent up anger he had thanks to An Jing on Xu Miantu. \u201cA dog is a dog. It only knows how to threaten others thanks to its master. However, you have to at least take a good look. Is that really your master?\u201dWhen Yang Lie said that, not only did the expression on Xu Miantu\u2019s face change, even Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were no exception.Li Xuan coldly said, \u201cYang Lie, who did you say was the dog? I dare you to say it again.\u201dYang Lie sneered and said, \u201cWho in Luoyang City doesn\u2019t know that your patriarch enjoys adopting sons. To put it nicely, it\u2019s an adopted son, but at the core of the matter, it\u2019s just a lapdog reared by your Li family. This is known by all, so what did I say wrong?\u201dThe look in Li Xuan\u2019s chilled. Just as he was about to flare up, he was held back by Xu Miantu. Surprisingly, Xu Miantu wasn\u2019t angry. He grinned at Yang Lie and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m a dog of the Li family. I even feel proud and honored being the Li family\u2019s dog. The Li family is my benefactor and I\u2019ve benefited from them. It\u2019s not like someone who yearns to be the dog of the An family, but they can\u2019t even be bothered to spare him a glance. Something that\u2019s worse than a dog isn\u2019t worth mentioning.\u201dXu Miantu\u2019s words hit Yang Lie where it hurt. It was true that the Yang family was trying to cozy up with the An family, but the An family\u2019s attitude was rather vague. It had never truly accepted the Yang family.Therefore, Yang Lie\u2019s expression changed drastically once he heard that. His face was extremely livid. His eyes stared viciously at Xu Miantu as a look of killing intent flashed through them.\u201cDoes a dog of the Li family only know how to bark? If you\u2019re as impressive as you say you are, slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus; otherwise, quit the barking,\u201d Yang Lie said with a cold look. If they weren\u2019t in public, he would have immediately taken action and slaughtered Xu Miantu.Xu Miantu was about to snap back when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Then, he heard Zhou Wen whisper, \u201cIf you wish to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, we can do it together.\u201d\u201cBrother Wen, really?\u201d Xu Miantu was delighted as he hurriedly asked.Zhou Wen nodded slightly and said seriously, \u201cAs long as you aren\u2019t afraid of sacrificing your Companion Beast.\u201dXu Miantu had started the conflict because of Zhou Wen and Yang Lie, so naturally, he couldn\u2019t sit idly as Xu Miantu was being ridiculed by Yang Lie. However, his claim of being able to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus wasn\u2019t just a spur of the moment.Zhou Wen really couldn\u2019t kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus in-game, but this wasn\u2019t the game. He didn\u2019t need to face it alone and he still had Xu Miantu and Li Xuan to help him.Zhou Wen had carefully run through the Companion Beasts they possessed. If they controlled them well and no mistakes happened, he believed he could slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus based on his understanding of it.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. Let\u2019s do it,\u201d Xu Miantu turned to say to Yang Lie. \u201cHeard that, Yang? We\u2019ll be slaying it right now. Open your eyes and watch it well. Don\u2019t blame us for not teaching you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d Yang Lie said with a sneer.From his point of view, it was fool\u2019s talk that the trio could kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Even two Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks weren\u2019t a match for it, so it would be ridiculous if three freshmen at the Mortal stage could slay it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Let Me Game in Peacechapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Xuan and Zhou Wen were amongst the first group of people who had discovered the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Zhou Wen had been thinking up a strategy to slay it in-game. Likewise, Li Xuan hadn\u2019t been slacking off either. He had also tried all kinds of means to obtain Legendary Companion Beasts capable of flight, hoping to slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.However, Legendary Companion Beasts capable of flight were rare. Those with considerable strength weren\u2019t easily acquired. Furthermore, Li Xuan was only at the Mortal stage, so the Legendary Companion Beasts he incubated needed more time and effort than those at the Legendary stage.At this point in time, Li Xuan had only incubated a Legendary Sky Conch.Xu Miantu was also at the Mortal stage. He didn\u2019t have the Invincible Connate Divine Art, so he wasn\u2019t capable of incubating a Legendary Companion Beast. However, he had always been Li Xuan\u2019s right-hand man. He had also contributed when Jiang Hao betrayed Li Xuan.Therefore, Li Xuan had gotten a Mortal Dragon-Scaled Turtle Companion Egg and given it to him. Although it was only at the Mortal stage, it lived in Black Dragon Pool, so it had extremely high resistance against corrosive liquids.Li Xuan had prepared a Dragon-Scaled Turtle to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, so it was perfect to have Xu Miantu control it.Zhou Wen knew of this, so after taking into account all the Companion Beasts they had, he had the confidence that the three of them combined could kill it.\u201cTo kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, apart from letting our Companion Beasts engage in battle, we will need to enter the lotus pond as well. Only then will we have a hundred percent chance of killing it. Are you certain that you want to enter?\u201d Zhou Wen looked at Xu Miantu and Li Xuan, confirming with them with great solemnity.\u201cBuddha needs incense, and a man needs self-respect. I\u2019m bent on killing that blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus,\u201d Xu Miantu said loudly.\u201cZhou Wen, how confident are you?\u201d Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen with a serious look.\u201cFollow my instructions, 100%. However, there mustn\u2019t be any mistakes in our cooperation or it will be very dangerous. It\u2019s especially so for Miantu who has to control the Dragon-Scaled Turtle. You mustn\u2019t make any mistakes or both you and I will be in grave danger,\u201d Zhou Wen said as he looked at Xu Miantu.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make sure nothing happens to you even if I were to die,\u201d Xu Miantu said as he slapped his chest.\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s do it,\u201d Li Xuan locked eyes with Zhou Wen and said with a nod.\u201cThen let\u2019s begin. Listen to my every command. Miantu, release your Dragon-Scaled Turtle\u2026\u201d Zhou Wen softly informed the other two of his plan.The trio made their own preparations. Xu Miantu released the Dragon-Scaled Turtle and a turtle the size of a tiny boat appeared on the lotus pond. Not only did it have a turtle shell, but it also had black scales on its shell, making it look very odd.The average Companion Beast would immediately be reduced to bone upon contact with the lotus pond\u2019s water. Yet, this Dragon-Scaled Turtle was completely fine. It floated in the lotus pond like a tiny black boat.Xu Miantu and Li Xuan jumped onto the turtle\u2019s back. Zhou Wen was about to jump onto it when he suddenly heard a cold, clear voice. \u201cGood intentions might not result in good outcomes. At times, good intentions might even kill.\u201dZhou Wen turned his head and looked over to see An Jing sitting on her white horse with a cold expression. She had been the one who had said that sentence.Zhou Wen shot a look at her and smiled before jumping on the turtle\u2019s back.The Dragon-Scaled Turtle waded through the lake and the green lotus leaves, rapidly approaching the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. When it was nearly twenty meters from the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, Zhou Wen got Xu Miantu to stop the Dragon-Scaled Turtle.\u201cMiantu, stay here to wait for us. Make sure to constantly take note of Li Xuan\u2019s landing points. Follow the plan. Make sure nothing goes wrong,\u201d Zhou Wen told Xu Miantu again.\u201cBrother Wen, don\u2019t worry. As long as I\u2019m not dead, I guarantee you that nothing bad will happen to the two of you,\u201d Xu Miantu guaranteed with a slap of his chest.\u201cOkay.\u201d Zhou Wen nodded and looked at Li Xuan. \u201cAct according to plan.\u201dAfter uttering a confirmation, Li Xuan summoned his Legendary Companion Beast, the Sky Conch.The Sky Conch resembled a conch that was found in the sea, but it had a pair of wings. Its body was about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. It was extremely stable while flying in midair. Although it flew very slowly, it was good at being able to glide in the sky for long periods of time without needing to land on the ground to continue its flight.\u201cLegendary Sky Conch? How is it possible? Isn\u2019t Li Xuan at the Mortal stage? How is it possible for him to incubate a Sky Conch?\u201d One of the students on the bank immediately recognized the Sky Conch and couldn\u2019t help but exclaim.\u201cAren\u2019t you making too much of a fuss?\u201d Li Xuan chuckled as he summoned Black Knight and Jade-Eyed White Tiger.Black Knight transformed into an armor that encased Li Xuan\u2019s body. As for the Jade-Eyed White Tiger, it turned into a Tiger Soul Saber. Its cold glimmers stirred one\u2019s soul. Embedded in the saber\u2019s handle was a gem resembling a tiger\u2019s eye.\u201cBlack Knight and Jade-Eyed White Tiger. They are both Legendary Companion Beasts\u2026 Heavens\u2026 Isn\u2019t Li Xuan at the Mortal stage? What\u2019s going on? Is this fellow really that prodigal son of the Li family?\u201d The students widened their eyes as they looked at him in disbelief.Li Xuan felt a little pleased with himself. Wearing the black armor and holding the Tiger Soul Saber while riding a Sky Conch, he flew towards the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with tremendous pomp.Zhou Wen seemed to pale in comparison. He summoned the Mutated Skeleton Ant and stood on its back without any weapons or armor. The Mutated Skeleton Ant waded across the water surface to another side of the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.\u201cMiantu, pay attention to Li Xuan more. Make sure he doesn\u2019t fall into the water,\u201d Zhou Wen looked at Xu Miantu urging him again.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Brother Wen,\u201d Xu Miantu said with a slap on his chest.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t speak further. The Mutated Skeleton Ant and Sky Conch closed in on the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus from both sides. With Li Xuan\u2019s speed faster than Zhou Wen\u2019s, the latter had apparently deliberately stayed a little behind.Boom! Boom!More than ten blood-colored lotus seeds shot at Li Xuan, instantly blanketing him and the Sky Conch, sealing off all routes of retreat.With a loud roar, Li Xuan slashed the Tiger Soul Saber at the blood-colored lotus seeds. The saber was so fast that the seeds didn\u2019t explode when they were halved.The seed only exploded when both halves had flown out further than a meter.\u201cIs that really the Li family\u2019s foppish Third Young Master Li Xuan?\u201d Yang Lie watched in astonishment as Li Xuan showed his prowess. He sliced through all the blood-colored lotus seeds and charged at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.And while Li Xuan was handling the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s attacks, Zhou Wen took the chance to order the Mutated Skeleton Ant to rush towards the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus at full speed.When he was less than three meters from the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, Zhou Wen ordered the Mutated Skeleton Ant to jump. And it was at this moment that the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus spread open its petals in a bid to devour the Mutated Skeleton Ant. If the latter had been one bit slower, Zhou Wen and the Mutated Skeleton Ant would have been devoured.\u201cRight now!\u201d Zhou Wen roared.Li Xuan didn\u2019t hesitate to jump from the Sky Conch, slashing down at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with two hands clasping the saber.A blinding-white saber beam blasted out of the Tiger Soul Saber, instantly cleaving the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s petals. The petals shot out a red luster that attempted to resist the Tiger Soul Saber\u2019s strike.However, the saber beam was just too sharp. Combined with Li Xuan\u2019s saber-type Primordial Energy Skill, the Tiger Soul Saber sliced through the petals.The petal was cleaved open, revealing the black lotus receptacle. Crouching on it was a pitch-black toad covered in black venomous warts. It opened its mouth and spat a mouthful of venom at Li Xuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Let Me Game in Peacechapter 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Xuan\u2019s strength was used up by the time his cleave tore through the Buddha-patterned flower petals. Furthermore, he wasn\u2019t able to dodge in midair. The Sky Conch was too slow at flying, making it unable to keep up with Li Xuan. It was still gliding at a relatively high altitude and the direction in which it was heading wasn\u2019t towards Li Xuan.Suddenly a fist appeared beneath Li Xuan\u2019s feet, striking his soles. Zhou Wen had come flying over!Li Xuan exerted Strength in his feet as he stepped onto Zhou Wen\u2019s fists and used this as an impetus to soar high into the sky. Zhou Wen ended up plummeting rapidly, allowing them to dodge the toad\u2019s venomous shot.Li Xuan used his momentum to leap onto the lotus receptacle and cleaved down at the venomous toad\u2019s head. After the saber beam flashed by, Li Xuan flew back in retreat, jumping out of the lotus receptacle.Bang!The venomous toad exploded like a bomb, splattering venomous liquid in every direction like flying arrows, covering a massive region.Li Xuan was already unable to dodge the attack while in midair, but the Sky Conch which had been constantly in the sky arrived in the nick of time, putting its body in between Li Xuan and the venomous liquid.Zhou Wen also landed on the Mutated Skeleton Ant before leaping up once again, jumping back tens of feet to dodge the range of the venom\u2019s splash.The venom was extremely terrifying. The Sky Conch\u2019s body was immediately corroded like snow touching ember. With a tragic cry, it fell straight into the pond.When Zhou Wen landed, the Mutated Skeleton Ant had already stopped beneath his feet. On the contrary, Li Xuan was plummeting straight into the pond without having any place to land his feet.The Dragon-Scaled Turtle, which was meant to catch Li Xuan, was still a distance from Li Xuan under Xu Miantu\u2019s flustered commandeering. It was apparent that he wasn\u2019t going to arrive in time.Zhou Wen had just landed on the Mutated Skeleton Ant and it was already too late for him to command it to rush over when he saw this scene. He stomped on the Mutated Skeleton Ant and flew across the pond for Li Xuan, pulling him up just as his back was about to touch the water.However, Zhou Wen\u2019s leap was ultimately limited. He soon began falling.\u201cMiantu, what are you waiting for? Quick catch us!\u201d Li Xuan, who had been pulled up by Zhou Wen, shouted at the nearby Xu Miantu.Xu Miantu watched Zhou Wen and Li Xuan fall from about three to four meters away. He was likely to able to reach the two of them if he extended his arms while getting the Dragon-Scaled Turtle to speed up.However, he stood there motionless. He clenched his teeth in silence as his forehead\u2019s veins throbbed. Ultimately, he chose not to do a thing\u201cXu Miantu, why!?\u201d Li Xuan wore a grimace. At this stage, it was already obvious to him that Xu Miantu had deliberately thrown him and Zhou Wen into a trap.From the initial provoking of Yang Lie to turning a blind eye to their peril, everything was a deliberate ruse by Xu Miantu.The only person who was capable of doing this had to win the trust of Li Xuan and to know everything about him-Xu Miantu.However, Li Xuan could do nothing. All he could do was stare intently at Xu Miantu as the duo were on the brink of falling into the pond.There were exclamations on the bank. After all, they were still students. Even if they didn\u2019t like Zhou Wen or Li Xuan, none of them wished them dead.With Li Xuan and Zhou Wen about to fall into the pond, Xu Miantu\u2019s face read, I had no choice. Don\u2019t blame me.Am I really such a failure as a friend? Li Xuan, who had been staring at him, could read his lips. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a dreary sadness. The people he thought were his friends-Jiang Hao and Xu Miantu\u2014had both betrayed him. It left him downhearted.Just as Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were about to fall into the water, a white and silver beam shimmered above the lotus pond.Silver light swirled behind Zhou Wen as four transparent wings appeared behind him. They were rapidly flapping as they pulled him and Li Xuan up, allowing them to escape certain doom.Impossible\u2026 How do you have a Companion Beast capable of flight? Xu Miantu looked at the flying Zhou Wen, feeling alarmed and afraid. His expression was distorted beyond description.With Li Xuan in tow, Zhou Wen landed on the Dragon-Scaled Turtle\u2019s back. He looked at Xu Miantu and said, \u201cI kept giving you an opportunity, but unfortunately, you still didit.\u201d\u201cHave you always suspected me? So you deliberately hid the fact that you own a Companion Beast capable of flight?\u201d Xu Miantu stared at Zhou Wen in alarm andanger.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t the case, how would I be able to test if you really treat me as a friend?\u201d Zhou Wen said indifferently. \u201cI\u2019m cool-natured and do not know how to be nice to others, so when others are nice to me, I suspect if they have any ulterior motives. Although I also wish that you really had treated me as a friend, the facts have unfortunately proven that this world is as cruel as I imagined.\u201dHaving said that, Zhou Wen glanced to the side of the lotus pond. He saw a beautiful girl floating in the sky with a pair of pure-white wings. This beautiful and holy beast was shockingly the legendary angel Companion Beast.This angel Companion Beast had flown over and across the lotus pond almost at the same time that Zhou Wen had summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.\u201cThank you.\u201d Zhou Wen looked at An Jing riding the white horse\u2019s back. Zhou Wen had understood An Jing\u2019s warning; he had just feigned ignorance to test Xu Miantu.At the instant the angel Companion Beast appeared, even if Zhou Wen didn\u2019t like An Jing as a person, he felt that he needed to thank her.\u201cI was afraid you wouldn\u2019t die and wanted to make your death a clean one. From the looks of it, I don\u2019t have an opportunity,\u201d An Jing said with a deadpan expression as she reached out her hand to withdraw her angel Companion Beast. She then rode the white horse away.\u201cXu Miantu, give me a reason to let you live,\u201d Li Xuan said to him with a cold glare.\u201cBrother Xuan, I\u2019m sorry. I was really forced. I was forced by your brother\u2026 Please, spare me\u2026\u201d Xu Miantu plopped to his knees as he hugged Li Xuan\u2019s legs to beg for mercy.\u201cYou\u2019ve once risked your life for me. I can choose not to take your life, but you tried not only to harm me but Zhou Wen as well. Your life isn\u2019t enough to atone two lives.\u201d Li Xuan kicked Xu Miantu away and turned around. With his back facing Xu Miantu, he said, \u201cScram. If you can leave Luoyang alive, I\u2019ll spare your life.\u201dXu Miantu wore a livid expression. He was from the Li family and knew what it was capable of. As long as Li Xuan was unwilling to spare him, there was no way he could live Luoyang alive.In his despair, a look of hatred flashed in Xu Miantu\u2019s eyes. He pounced at Li Xuan with all his might, roaring with a ferocious look. \u201cThen let\u2019s die together!\u201dJust as Xu Miantu was about to pounce on Li Xuan, the latter took a sidestep to dodge him as though he had eyes on his back.Unable to stop himself, Xu Miantu fell into the lotus pond.\u201cAh!\u201d Xu Miantu struggled and cried in the water. His flesh was corroded as bloody bubbles emerged. It looked extremely tragic and horrifying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 QualificationsDue to Xu Miantu\u2019s death, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were investigated by the school, but they were quickly released.\u201cWhat kind of person is your brother?\u201d In the dorm, Zhou Wen leaned against a chair and asked Li Xuan.Li Xuan casually sat on the floor, holding a can of beer and downing it slowly. Then, he said, \u201cMy family has three brothers. My eldest brother was a genius. He was good at everything, believed to be a super genius on par with An Tianzuo in Luoyang City. He was the most talented of our Li family. Unfortunately, he died young.\u201dDowning another mouthful of beer, Li Xuan continued, \u201cMy second brother, Li Xiubai, was promising at a young age. Although he wasn\u2019t as illustrious as An Tianzuo. He\u2019s a Li family genius known to all and he has a very good reputation outside. At home, he\u2019s a figure who can discuss the Li family matters with the other uncles. He\u2019s a lot stronger than a foppish scion like me. Most of my old man\u2019s adopted sons look up to him as their leader.\u201cBut you can see that my childhood friends, Jiang Hao and Xu Miantu, people who had the strongest relationships with me in the Li family betrayed me one after the other. They spent no effort to help my brother kill me. It was especially so for Xu Miantu. I\u2019m certain that he wasn\u2019t working for my brother before he returned to Luoyang. But in a few short days, he turned his back on me. You should be able to guess what kind of character and means my brother has.\u201d Li Xuan crushed the beer can upon saying that.\u201cWhy? Aren you vying for the Li family\u2019s business? Just to be safe, he\u2019s willing to do this to his younger brother? Doesn\u2019t your father care?\u201d Zhou Wen found it somewhat unbelievable.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not because of the Li family\u2019s business. If it was only that, we wouldn\u2019t have reached this point,\u201d Li Xuan said with a shake of his head.\u201cThen what\u2019s the reason?\u201d Seeing Li Xuan silent, Zhou Wen said, \u201cForget it if you can\u2019tsay.\u201dLi Xuan shook his head slightly and sighed after a long period of time. \u201cThe higher the levels of dimensional creatures, the greater the difference in strength. Just like Legendary creatures are almost no match for Epic creatures, with the gap between the Epic stage and the Mythical stage even larger, it can be said that even a hundred humans at the Epic stage might not be able to kill a Mythical creature. It might even lead to their complete wipeout.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve learned that from the textbooks.\u201d Zhou Wen felt that Li Xuan was saying the obvious.Li Xuan continued, \u201cThen have you thought about how humans were able to kill the first Mythical creature considering the huge difference in strength?\u201d\u201cLegend has it that the few founders of the League combined forces to kill it. It\u2019s also the Six League Heroes as taught in the textbooks.\u201d Zhou Wen knew that Li Xuan definitely had more to tell\u201cThen do you know how they killed the Mythical creature?\u201d Li Xuan asked with a smile.\u201cThe books say that they had a difficult battle that lasted three full days\u2026\u201d Before Zhou Wen finished his sentence, Li Xuan interrupted him.\u201cDon\u2019t believe in the books\u2019 nonsense. If they were really only at the Epic stage, even sixty people wouldn\u2019t be able to kill a Mythical creature, much less six,\u201d Li Xuan said in disdain.\u201cThen how is one killed?\u201d Zhou Wen asked out of curiosity.\u201cIt\u2019s because they had Mythical Companion Beasts,\u201d Li Xuan said.\u201cIsn\u2019t what you say contradictory? Without killing the first Mythical creature, how will one have a Mythical Companion Beast? This doesn\u2019t adhere to logic.\u201dLi Xuan laughed in reply, \u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t adhere to logic. It\u2019s because their Companion Beasts weren\u2019t obtained by killing Mythical creatures. Instead, someone gave them to them. Although they can\u2019t be considered real Mythical creatures and can only be called larva of Mythical creatures, it\u2019s already enviable.\u201d\u201cThis still doesn\u2019t adhere to logic. If someone gave them Mythical Companion Beasts, then the person who gave them must have killed Mythical creatures before,\u201d Zhou Wen said with a frown.\u201cNo one can answer this question. At the very least, not me. I only know that there\u2019s such a department in the top brass of the League that does such matters. Some humans can obtain the qualifications just like the Six League Heroes. And my Li family has such a qualification. Then, the person who might be able to obtain a Mythical Companion Beast might be me. Only with me dead will this opportunity have a chance of landing on my brother. It\u2019s because I was appointed by my old man,\u201d Li Xuan said in a teasing tone.\u201cSo that\u2019s the reason. In that case, isn\u2019t your old man going to rein in and do something about your brother?\u201d Zhou Wen asked, puzzled.If it were him, he definitely wouldn\u2019t kill his younger brother over such matters. However, everyone was different. Zhou Wen didn\u2019t believe that his thoughts represented everyone. In fact, he always felt that his character and thoughts were in the minority.\u201cRein in? How? Beat him to death? Or get me to give up the Mythical Companion Beast qualifications? At this point in time, I can only compete with my brother,\u201d Li Xuan said with a glint in his eyes. He didn\u2019t seem afraid and was even excited.\u201cYou have to be careful.\u201d Although Zhou Wen had never met Li Xiubai, he had a deep impression of him after what had happened to Jiang Hao and Xu Miantu.\u201cI will soon advance to the Legendary stage, then I\u2019ll have nothing to fear. Instead, it\u2019s you that should be careful. You have foiled my brother\u2019s plans twice. With my understanding of him, he will definitely not spare you,\u201d Li Xuan said very solemnly.Zhou Wen nodded slightly. He didn\u2019t believe that Li Xuan was being an alarmist. It was something very possible.Although the campus didn\u2019t permit private fighting, even Xu Miantu dared to take action in a dimensional zone under Li Xiubai\u2019s scheme. It was difficult to guarantee that a second or third Xu Miantu wouldn\u2019t appear on campus.\u201cThankfully you live alone in Four Seasons Garden. The situation there isn\u2019t as complicated as the ordinary dorms. It makes it a lot safer. Speaking of which, I recall that the An family also has the qualifications to obtain a Mythical Companion Beast. Unfortunately, you aren\u2019t born into the An family; otherwise, you might have a chance to vie for it from An Jing,\u201d Li Xuan joked.\u201cWhy would it be with An Jing? Didn\u2019t you said that An Tianzuo was the genius? Shouldn\u2019t the An family\u2019s Mythical Companion Beast qualification be his?\u201d Zhou Wen asked with a frown.\u201cThat I\u2019m not sure. While my old man was telling me about the Mythical Companion Beasts, he had mentioned in passing that the An family had likely chosen An Jing. In Luoyang City, only my Li family and the An family has the qualifications,\u201d Li Xuan said with great certainty.Li Xuan was in a bad mood, so he drank plenty. In his drunken stupor, he vomited and collapsed in Zhou Wen\u2019s bed.Zhou Wen had no choice but to sit on the chair to game since he had no intention of sleeping.Although the Li family\u2019s matters had nothing to do with him, it was as Li Xuan said; Li Xiubai-in his displeasure-might even want him out of the way, so he needed to be wary.But no matter what he did, nothing was as effective as being strong himself.After today\u2019s experience and the battle with the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, Zhou Wen was quite inspired. He wanted to see if he could kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus alone. Although this was a crazy idea, Zhou Wen could already see its viability.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He continued forward, only to receive automatic notifications from the system every ten minutes.This fellow feeds on Companion Beasts, but Companion Eggs aren\u2019t easily produced. Zhou Wen felt a little depressed and could only ignore the notification.If Zhou Wen were rich, he could purchase Companion Eggs to feed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, but he wasn\u2019t rich. The living allowance Zhou Lingfeng gave him was only enough for his usual expenses, leaving nothing left for him to buy Companion Eggs.It\u2019s best I am self-sufficient. I should grind more. Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar as he stormed into the lotus pond.At this moment, a video remained at the top of the school\u2019s Intranet trending searches-a video of Zhou Wen and Li Xuan combining forces to strike at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.It was unknown which student on the bank had recorded the video. From a bystander\u2019s angle, the entire process had been recorded in high definition.However, the video had clearly been edited. The entire video only reached the point when Zhou Wen summoned his silver wings and flew up with Li Xuan in tow.\u201cWhat the f**k. Isn\u2019t Li Xuan that prodigal of the Li family? How is he this strong? He summoned three Legendary Companion Beasts at the Mortal stage and even slew the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus that many Legendary seniors at school couldn\u2019t?\u201d\u201cLi Xuan is too cool!\u201d\u201cThe other freshman isn\u2019t bad either. Although he\u2019s slightly weaker, he also has two Companion Beasts. They\u2019re just quite unfamiliar ones. I\u2019ve never seen them in the past. Are they at the Mortal stage or Legendary stage?\u201dLi Xuan went completely viral. Due to him hogging the spotlight, Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t noticed by many.This video also appeared on the desktop computer of Qiao Siyuan. He sat in front of his computer watching it several times with his arms crossed.\u201cNoticed anything?\u201d Qiao Siyuan asked Liz.\u201cLi Xuan is very strong. This fellow is rather interesting. He really acted the part well in the past. All three brothers of the Li family are real pieces of work. It\u2019s only because the eldest brother died early that the An family\u2019s standing in Luoyang has not been shaken.\u201d Liz watched a few times, but with Qiao Siyuan silent, she was already growing impatient.Qiao Siyuan shook his head gently. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about that. Did you notice Zhou Wen?\u201d\u201cNaturally. Although Li Xuan is very strong, the one giving instructions was Zhou Wen,\u201d Liz said.Qiao Siyuan stared at the computer screen as his eyes glowed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not talking about that. Look carefully. Zhou Wen did three consecutive jumps at full strength. Such a jump would probably be difficult even for you to accomplish without special Primordial Energy Skills or Primordial Energy Arts to support you.\u201dLiz was taken aback as she watched again carefully. A look of surprise emerged as she said, \u201cIndeed. Without a Primordial Energy Skill or Primordial Energy Art to support that, the human body can hardly complete three consecutive jumps under gravity. He clearly didn\u2019t use any Primordial Energy Skills. That must mean that his Primordial Energy Art is extraordinary\u2026\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it written in his dossier? He cultivates in Ascetic Meditation and has cultivated it for years,\u201d Qiao Siyuan said.\u201cBut Ascetic Meditation is a Primordial Energy Art that\u2019s good for Strength and Constitution. It doesn\u2019t equip one with the characteristic of such repeated bursts. From the looks of it, Zhou Wen has hidden his cards well. He likely doesn\u2019t cultivate in Ascetic Meditation,\u201d Liz said.Yet, Qiao Siyuan said with great certainty, \u201cNo, I\u2019m very certain that Zhou Wen cultivated in Ascetic Meditation. At the very least, he was definitely cultivating in it before we met him in Guide City.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Liz was confounded.\u201cDidn\u2019t you size him up carefully when you encountered the youth that appeared out of the blue? Back then, his skin was slightly yellow and there was a dark gold luster at the bottom of his eyes. That\u2019s the characteristic of long-term cultivation of Ascetic Meditation. Back then, he must have cultivated it for years, but now, I don\u2019t see those traits.\u201cBut it\u2019s only been days since our meeting with him in Guide City. Even if he were to switch Primordial Energy Arts in such a short period of time, he wouldn\u2019t be able to completely replace Ascetic Meditation which he cultivated for years, right? At the very least, there should be signs of retrogression of those traits. It shouldn\u2019t vanish in such a short period of time.\u201cThat\u2019s where the problem lies. Zhou Wen encountered Jing Daoxian and shortly after that, the Ascetic Meditation he cultivated for years was replaced by another Primordial Energy Art. And shortly after that, the An family changed the nomination from An Jing to Zhou Wen. Is there some connection in this matter?\u201d Qiao Siyuan rapped his fingers on the table and said slowly.Liz trembled. \u201cSir, do you mean that the An family and that devil, Jing Daoxian, have some kind of relationship?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that. However, there\u2019s indeed something abnormal about Zhou Wen. Perhaps something happened between him and Jing Daoxian. Only a handful of people in the League can change the Primordial Energy Art that they have been cultivating for several years in such a short timespan, and Jing Daoxian happens to be one of them,\u201d Qiao Siyuan said.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, doesn\u2019t it mean that Zhou Wen is in cahoots with Jing Daoxian? We should do our best to bring him back for questioning as soon as possible.\u201d Liz\u2019s eyes litup.\u201cThere\u2019s indeed such a necessity, but we are in Luoyang, not at our headquarters in the capital,\u201d Qiao Siyuan said with a sigh.\u201cWe can request the higher-ups for an arrest warrant. The Sunset College wouldn\u2019t dare stop us from arresting someone,\u201d Liz said.\u201cSunset College might not, but one person would,\u201d Qiao Siyuan said indifferently\u201cAn Tianzuo? No way, right? Would he dare openly defy the League\u2019s laws?\u201d Liz asked with a frown.\u201cYes, he will,\u201d Qiao Siyuan said with great certainty.After some thought, Qiao Siyuan added, \u201cHowever, it will depend on An Jing\u2019s and An Tianzuo\u2019s attitudes. They are likely displeased that Zhou Wen took away the nomination that originally belonged to An Jing. Otherwise, would the great Overseer An deliberately criticize an ordinary high-schooler during his inspection of Guide City? An Jing wouldn\u2019t have specially transferred to Guide High School to beat Zhou Wen up.\u201d\u201cSir, what are you getting at?\u201d Liz probed.\u201cImmediately apply for an arrest warrant, then bring back Zhou Wen as quickly as possible. You have to be fast. When that happens, even if the An family receives the news and tries to rescue him, we should have already asked everything we would like to know. Besides, An Tianzuo might not necessarily want to save him,\u201d Qiao Siyuan said lightly.\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019ll apply for an arrest warrant as soon as possible. Once he\u2019s brought back, I\u2019ll definitely interrogate him personally.\u201d Liz\u2019s eyes flashed a burning flame.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhou Wen brought a chair over and rested in the courtyard, suntanning while gaming.As school hadn\u2019t officially started, there weren\u2019t any training or missions assigned yet. Zhou Wen led a rather pleasant life.He had been constantly trying to slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus alone, but he had failed.Thankfully, all his efforts had not been in vain. He managed to have an ordinary Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg drop, but it was quickly fed to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.The typical Companion Beast only needed to depend on its master, absorbing the Primordial Energy that emitted from its master\u2019s body for survival. It could also slowly recover from its injuries without needing to eat anything. At best, it would absorb some Primordial Energy Crystals, allowing it to quickly recover Primordial Energy.However, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant needed to swallow Companion Eggs or Companion Beasts or the game would constantly notify him that it was in a hungry state. In the beginning, Zhou Wen ignored it, but later, the game indicated that the Silver-Winged Flying Ant would vanish in twenty-four hours if it remained in a prolonged hungry state.Therefore, Zhou Wen had no choice but to feed it the Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg to alleviate the pressing matter at hand.Zhou Wen gamed in the yard, half leaning back. His neighbor, An Jing, had finished morning cultivation and had walked out of the cultivation room to the balcony on the second floor. Hoping to look far into the distance to relieve stress before continuing her cultivation, her gaze subconsciously swept towards the courtyard beside hers. Immediately she saw Zhou Wen gaming in the courtyard while sunbathing. Immediately, her mood turned foul.Even if it\u2019s as Mom said, that his talent is better than mine, so what? A person\u2019s talent cannot decide his achievements. What right does a person who has engrossed himself in games to avoid reality-even after suffering a tiny setback-have to fight me for the Mythical Companion Beast? Besides, his talent might not be better than mine. An Jing watched for a while before heading downstairs, muttering to herself, \u201cMom, watch and see. I\u2019ll prove that I\u2019m better than Zhou Wen. I totally have the ability to fight for the right to possess a Mythical Companion Beast by myself. There\u2019s no need for Zhou Wen.\u201d\u201cZhou Wen.\u201d Zhou Wen was having a great time grinding when he suddenly heard his name. He turned around and saw that someone was standing quietly in the other courtyard by the fence, staring at him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Zhou Wen gave An Jing a look before lowering his head to continue staring at his game screen.\u201cThat Sun Strafe Art is real. You can cultivate it.\u201d An Jing paused for a moment before saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, give a call to Uncle Feng. He will help you verify its authenticity.\u201dZhou Wen was unconcerned about the authenticity of the Sun Strafe Art as he could no longer cultivate it anyway.\u201cWhy did you give it to me?\u201d Zhou Wen asked as he gamed.An Jing looked at Zhou Wen and said, \u201cYou must feel indignant about losing to me last time, right?\u201d\u201cNot at all. You beat me fair and square,\u201d Zhou Wen said in passing. He really didn\u2019t want to have any connection with An Jing. It was best if they could be like strangers.The words An Jing had originally prepared were swallowed. Feeling a little uncomfortable holding it, she bit her lip and said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you three months to cultivate the Sun Strafe Art and advance to the Legendary stage. With your foundation, three months should be enough. We will then fight another match. If you still haven\u2019t advanced to the Legendary stage within three months, I won\u2019t show any mercy.\u201dAfter pausing for a moment, she added, \u201cDon\u2019t say that I\u2019m bullying you. I\u2019ll get someone to deliver you Primordial Energy Crystals and other cultivation necessities. Whatever Primordial Energy Skills you need can be given to me as a list. I\u2019ll try to get them for you. Remember, you only have three months.\u201dZhou Wen felt that An Jing was being unreasonable. He frowned and said, \u201cI admit defeat. You win. There\u2019s no need to go through so much trouble.\u201dHe neither wanted to take advantage of the An family nor did he want to waste time competing with An Jing again. It was meaningless to him and defeating her brought him no benefits.\u201cYou have to fight. Remember, I\u2019m only giving you three months. I definitely won\u2019t show you any mercy when the time comes.\u201d After saying that coldly, An Jing turned around and left. She was afraid that she wouldn\u2019t be able to hold herself back from beating Zhou Wen with how detestable he looked.\u201cWhy must you fight with me?\u201d Zhou Wen felt puzzled. If An Jing hated him because of Ouyang Lan\u2019s remarriage, she could have beaten him right there and then without going through all that trouble.\u201cI want to prove that I\u2019m better than you.\u201d After finishing her sentence, she walked into her dormitory without looking back.Zhou Wen was somewhat baffled. When it came to who was better, Zhou Wen only had a little fame in Guide City. However, An Jing was publicly known as a genius in Luoyang. She had advanced to the Legendary stage at the age of thirteen and Zhou Wen still hadn\u2019t advanced. The difference between the two was almost unbridgeable.Do all people from noble families have such odd tempers? Li Xiubai can scheme to kill his younger brother for a qualification. An Jing is likewise ridiculous. Zhou Wen shook his head slightly.He had no intention of fighting An Jing, much less cultivate the Sun Strafe Art. As for advancing to the Legendary stage in three months, he was still working hard towards that. Of course, he wished to advance to the Legendary stage within three months, but the Lost Immortal Sutra was somewhat weird, making it difficult to make any prior estimates.An Jing returned to her small building and couldn\u2019t help but head for the balcony on the second floor. She secretly shot a glance at Zhou Wen and saw that he was still sunbathing and gaming. He didn\u2019t seem to feel any sense of urgency after what she had said or any intention to work hard. She couldn\u2019t help but bite her lip.After An Jing finally left, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t manage to game for long before someone came to his door. Furthermore, there was not one but four people.Zhou Wen looked up and saw four people, three of which he didn\u2019t know. One of them was Gao Yang who had a grudge against him because of Li Weiyang.Zhou Wen originally imagined that Gao Yang and company were here for revenge, but to his surprise, Gao Yang greeted him with a smile when he saw Zhou Wen sitting in the yard. \u201cZhou Wen, still remember me? I\u2019m your fourth-year senior, Gao Yang.\u201d\u201cWhy are you looking for me?\u201d Zhou Wen continued gaming, having no intention of inviting them in.Gao Yang didn\u2019t get angry as he continued chuckling. \u201cYou really don\u2019t become close unless you fight. What happened wasn\u2019t a big deal. If I had done anything wrong, I\u2019d apologize to you today. Let\u2019s ignore who was right or wrong and just bury the hatchet, alright?\u201dGao Yang naturally wouldn\u2019t make up with Zhou Wen for no good reason. The typical student who watched the video of Li Xuan and Zhou Wen battling the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus would feel that Li Xuan was formidable; thus, overshadowing Zhou Wen.However, those who were truly keen knew that Zhou Wen\u2019s role in the battle far exceeded Li Xuan\u2019s.Li Xuan was indeed strong, but there were still other students at Sunset College that were as strong as him. After all, Li Xuan hadn\u2019t advanced to the Legendary stage and there were many students at the Legendary stage. They could replace Li Xuan\u2019s role in the battle.As for Zhou Wen, no other student could replace him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He pushed the door open and entered the yard, speaking as he walked. \u201cI came here today for one other matter. Let me do the introduction. These three are students at our school. They are also your seniors. This is Hui Haifeng. You just matriculated, so you might not have heard his name. However, you\u2019ll definitely learn of his name once you familiarize yourself with the campus.\u201d\u201cZhou Wen, hello there.\u201d Hui Haifeng reached out his palm in a friendly manner.\u201cHello. I\u2019m gaming, so just get straight to the point.\u201d Zhou Wen was controlling the blood-colored avatar to battle in the Ant Nest. There were Vigor Ants everywhere swarming around him. He couldn\u2019t divert his attention to shake hands with Hui Haifeng, so it wasn\u2019t because of any disrespect.Gao Yang and the other two showed their displeasure, but Hui Haifeng thought nothing of it. He said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019ve watched the video of you and Li Xuan fighting the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. It was truly impressive, your judgment and commanding left me surprised. It\u2019s like you could predict the future. The only thing that\u2019s a pity was that one of your teammates was problematic, preventing you from slaying the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.\u201dWith Zhou Wen not having the intention to answer him, Hui Haifeng continued, \u201cI came here hoping to invite you to our team to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.\u201d\u201cNot interested.\u201d Zhou Wen was already rather familiar with the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. He believed that it wouldn\u2019t take long for him to slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus in-game, so there was no need for him to take any risks.Gao Yang tried persuading him. \u201cZhou Wen, consider it. Hui Haifeng is a lot stronger than Li Xuan. These two are Legendary experts that rank in the top twenty in school. Killing the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with them is almost guaranteed. There won\u2019t be many risks and it can be said that there are only benefits to it.\u201d\u201cSorry, I\u2019m really not interested.\u201d Zhou Wen shook his head again.He was doing his best grinding the Ant Nest dungeon, hoping to drop Companion Eggs to feed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. For this reason, he wasn\u2019t even visiting the lotus pond and chose to head to the Ant Nest where there were more dimensional creatures. He didn\u2019t have the time to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with Hui Haifeng.However, on second thought, Zhou Wen felt that what Xu Miantu said previously was right. In a place like Sunset College, showcasing one\u2019s strength allowed one to gain more opportunities.However, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t need the opportunities as they would affect his gaming and become a distraction.Gao Yang was slightly displeased. He thought differently of Zhou Wen only because Hui Haifeng appreciated Zhou Wen. He himself didn\u2019t think Zhou Wen was that strong.Hui Haifeng patted Gao Yang on the back, indicating him to swallow his words back. Then, he said to Zhou Wen, \u201cLet\u2019s do this. I\u2019ll hire you to help us slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. If you have any requests, raise it.\u201dZhou Wen was just about to reject him and send them off so that he could game in peace when a thought flashed in his mind. He looked up and asked Hui Haifeng, \u201cAny condition?\u201d\u201cThat will depend on whether it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Hui Haifeng said with a smile.\u201cYou can hire me. But I want a Legendary Companion Egg.\u201d Zhou Wen gave his condition immediately.He had grinded an entire day at Ant Nest, killing countless Vigor Ants and only with good luck could a Companion Egg drop. Otherwise, nothing would drop, making it difficult for him to rear a Silver-Winged Flying Ant.If he used a Legendary Companion Egg to feed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, perhaps it could grow faster and no longer suffer from hunger that quickly.Gao Yang wasn\u2019t willing when he heard that. \u201cZhou Wen, aren\u2019t you being exorbitant? We are killing a blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, so the chances of a Companion Egg dropping isn\u2019t high. By wanting a Legendary Companion Egg, aren\u2019t you being difficult?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my price. If you want it cheaper, you are free to hire others,\u201d Zhou Wen continued gaming as he said without looking up.Gao Yang wasn\u2019t done, but Hui Haifeng cut him off. \u201cA Legendary Companion Egg, no problem. What kind do you want?\u201d\u201cAny kind will do.\u201d Since Zhou Wen was only using it as food, he didn\u2019t have any special requests.\u201cAlright. I can give it to you tonight. Shall we head to the lotus pond tomorrow?\u201d Hui Haifeng said without hesitation.Zhou Wen finally looked up at Hui Haifeng and said, \u201cSure, I still have another request.\u201d\u201cZhou Wen, don\u2019t push it,\u201d Gao Yang said unhappily.\u201cNo worries. Go ahead.\u201d However, Hui Haifeng was unperturbed as though he didn\u2019t care about it.\u201cIf I am to go, everyone has to follow my commands. Before taking action, I also need to understand all the Companion Beasts you will use in detail. If you are also participating in the battle, I\u2019ll also need to know your combat standards and Primordial Energy Skills\u201d\u201cNo problem,\u201d Hui Haifeng replied immediately.\u201cAlso, I will not join the battle myself like the last time. I\u2019m only in charge of giving commands,\u201d Zhou Wen added.\u201cIt\u2019s your commanding ability that caught my eye. I don\u2019t need you to take risks,\u201d Hui Haifeng said with a smile.\u201cDeal. When will you send my Legendary Companion Egg to me?\u201d Zhou Wen lowered his head and continued gaming.Hui Haifeng thought for a moment before giving a time. \u201cEight in the evening.\u201dAfter discussing the specifics, Hui Haifeng and Gao Yang left. On the way, Gao Yang said unhappily, \u201cHaifeng, I really can\u2019t tell how Zhou Wen is as important as you describe him to be? I\u2019ve watched the video of his battle with the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus numerous times. We are already very clear about what needs to be done. With our strength, we should be able to kill it by ourselves. Why must we spend so much to hire him?\u201dHui Haifeng shook his head slightly. \u201cSeeing and doing are two completely different matters. Besides, we only saw a portion. We still have no idea what other capabilities the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus has.\u201d\u201cWe might not know, but neither will Zhou Wen. What use is he?\u201d Gao Yang still couldn\u2019t get his mind around it.\u201cI have a nagging feeling that Zhou Wen is somewhat different. Just treat it as buying some insurance,\u201d Hui Haifeng said with a smile.At eight that evening, someone sent a Legendary Companion Egg over. At the same time, a contract was included. Zhou Wen read through it and signed it after checking that it was fine. He then accepted the Legendary Companion EggClosing the door and returning to his cultivation room, Zhou Wen took out the Legendary Companion Egg from the box. At the same time, he summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, hoping to see how it would eat a Companion Egg in real life.Once the Silver-Winged Flying Ant saw the Companion Egg, it flew over and opened its huge mouth, biting onto the Egg and sucking at it. Soon, all that was left of the Companion Egg was its outer skin.The next second, Zhou Wen saw a silver swirl around the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s body with a red hue within.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Let Me Game in Peacechapter 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s silver and red light intensified and enveloped its body like a massive flame.When the flame gradually died down and revealed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s body, Zhou Wen\u2019s eyes lit up.It was now twice its former size, about the same size as the Silver-Winged Flying Ant which Zhou Wen had killed. However, its exterior wasn\u2019t exactly the same.On its body were some additional red-ringed stripes that alternated with the silver patterns. They made the lower half of its body appear like a hornet.More strangely, the tip of the ant\u2019s bottom had grown a silver spike that resembled a hornet\u2019s tail.Is this growth or mutation? Zhou Wen was astonished seeing this. He remembered that the person who delivered the Companion Egg mentioned that it was a Fire Hornet\u2019s Companion Egg. From how it looked, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant had apparently obtained some of the characteristics of the Fire Hornet.He quickly checked the in-game stats and found that the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s stats had changed drastically.Silver-Winged Flying Ant: Legendary (Adult)Legendary Life Providence: King of Low AltitudesStrength: 17Speed: 20Constitution: 16Primordial Energy: 19Talent Skill: Silver Wing Flash, Magical NeedleCompanion Form: WingsZhou Wen was pleasantly surprised and delighted seeing this. With such stats, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant could be said to be a pinnacle existence among Legendary Companion Beasts, especially its Speed. Typically, the stats of a Legendary maxed out at 18. 20 points was described as an Overdrive.Although the Primordial Energy was lower than Speed, it was also an Overdrive value.What surprised Zhou Wen, even more, was that the Silver-Winged Flying Ant had an additional Magical Needle Primordial Energy Skill. It had become a Companion Beast with two skills, making it an excellent Companion Beast.Although compared to the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus which had many skills, two skills weren\u2019t many, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was already considered rather rare when most Companion Beasts only had one Primordial Energy Skill.Zhou Wen was even more delighted when he saw the information regarding Magical Needle. It was a long-range Primordial Energy Skill. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant could release a Magical Needle and attack a target from afar.With this Silver-Winged Flying Ant, I don\u2019t have to worry about killing the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Without a second thought, Zhou Wen ended the summoning of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and chose to enter the game dungeon.Zhou Wen headed straight for the Underground Buddha City. With the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s present size, it was big enough for him to sit on it. Zhou Wen got the blood-colored avatar to ride on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and quickly fly to the lotus pond.A Speed of 20 was much faster than Zhou Wen could run himself. It was almost the difference between a horse carriage and a sports car. It didn\u2019t take long for him to fly to the bank of the lotus pond.The blood-colored avatar jumped off the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s back and watched the ensuing battle from the sidelines. Without any hesitation, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant flew towards the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus in the middle of the pond.Boom! Boom! Boom!More than ten blood-colored lotus seeds shot at the Silver-Winged Flying Ant as it flapped its four wings, leaving behind afterimages in the sky, easily dodging the attack range of the blood-colored lotus seeds.A Speed of 20 was just too fast. In a blink of an eye, it arrived in front of the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, to which the latter\u2019s petals contracted in a bid to devour the former.Just as the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was about to be devoured, silver light swirled from its back. Like a rocket, it blinked several meters away, dodging the petals. At the same time, it slashed at them with its blade-like claws.The blood pattern on the petal shimmered, producing a halo that blocked the claws.Although the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s Strength was already one of the best amongst Legendaries, it was unable to slice through the petal without the augmentation of any Primordial Energy Skills.The petal wasn\u2019t slashed through, but it opened by itself, revealing the venomous toad which opened its mouth and spat venom at the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.While the Silver-Winged Flying Ant easily dodged this, a silver light flashed at its tail, shooting a silver beam through the toad\u2019s forehead.Bang!The toad exploded, splattering its venom everywhere. However, the speed of the venom couldn\u2019t catch up with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s Speed.After the toad was killed, the lotus receptacle was completely exposed. The lotus seeds that resembled blood crystals exposed their tips as they suffused a sanguine luster.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant didn\u2019t stop as its silver tail flashed, shooting another Magical Needle at the lotus receptacle.Magical Needle\u2019s attack range was less than twenty meters. Although its range was limited, it was potent. The blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus closed its petals, blocking with the blood-patterned Buddha Glow, but ended up being penetrated by Magical Needle.At the instant the Magical Needle impaled the lotus receptacle, a blood-colored explosion erupted like a volcano. Twenty to thirty blood-columns spewed out, turning into bloody rain that covered twenty meters of the area. Whatever touched the bloody rain was liquefied. Even the other Buddha Heart Lotuses and lotus leaves living in the pond were no exception.The blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s petals were corroded by the bloody rain as they became riddled with holes.Thankfully, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was fast enough and dodged most of the splash; otherwise, it would have been reduced to a pool of blood.After the bloody rain finished its attack, Zhou Wen ordered the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to fly forward. At this moment, the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus was no longer capable of putting up any resistance. It didn\u2019t take long for its lotus receptacle to be sliced open.\u2018Killed Legendary creature, Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.\u2019A dimensional crystal from the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus dropped. It almost fell into the pond, but Zhou Wen was quick enough to command the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to grab it.Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal! Zhou Wen studied the text on the dimensional crystal carefully and was immediately exhilarated. He was originally a little depressed that no Companion Egg dropped, but after reading the text, he instantaneously felt better.Although a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus wasn\u2019t as valuable as a Companion Egg, it was possible that this Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill was able to help him enter Small Buddha Temple.The Primordial Energy Skill of ordinary Buddha Heart Lotus is Heart Meditation. But a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus has several Primordial Energy Skills. I wonder if Heart Meditation will be obtained by absorbing its Primordial Energy Skill? Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t sure either.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant brought the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus back to the blood-colored avatar\u2019s side. The moment the latter touched the crystal, the energy within surged into its body.Almost simultaneously, Zhou Wen felt a burning strength surge out of the phone. It instantly filled his body, making his body feel like a furnace. His body perspired profusely as though he had been scooped out of the water and was now being baked.After quite some time, the heat gradually subsided and he felt a refreshing coolness emerge in his body.It was especially so for his heart. It felt an indescribable comfort. It had a miraculous feeling of tranquility and coolness. At the same time, plenty of magical information surged into Zhou Wen\u2019s brain.\u2018Absorbed Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus. Attained Blood Meditation (Rank 9).\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Let Me Game in Peacechapter 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen took a look at the blood-colored avatar\u2019s stats and saw that the Heart Meditation in the Primordial Energy Skill slot had vanished. Replacing it was Blood Meditation.Zhou Wen attempted activating Blood Meditation and immediately a cool aura emerged from his heart. That aura went to every part of his body by coursing through his veins, making Zhou Wen feel an indescribable comfort.As for his skin, it suffused an abnormal ruddiness that made him look a little odd.It felt a little different from Heart Meditation. Furthermore, the Primordial Energy expenditure was much slower. One point of Primordial Energy lasted almost three minutes. With 10 Primordial Energy, Zhou Wen could use Blood Meditation for almost half an hour.If Blood Meditation is like Heart Meditation, half an hour should be enough to counter the Small Buddha Temple\u2019s mysterious force. It\u2019s enough for me to make a few trips to the stone staircase in front of the temple. Zhou Wen didn\u2019t waste any time and immediately got the blood-colored avatar to ride the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and fly for Small Buddha Temple.As he expected, Blood Meditation and Heart Meditation had the same effect. After activating Heart Meditation, the blood-colored avatar ran all the way up the stone stairs until it arrived in front of Small Buddha Temple without any accidents.Small Buddha Temple was dilapidated. The sign on the door had already faded and the walls surrounding the temple were crumbling in many places.Pushing open the dust-covered door, Zhou Wen saw the interior laden with dust. However, he was slightly taken aback.He was prepared to battle a powerful dimensional creature, but he didn\u2019t see any dimensional creature in the yard. There was only a stone monument in the middle of the yard.Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra? Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t help but be somewhat perplexed when he identified the biggest words on the stone monument.Large Perfection of Wisdom Sutra was well-known to many. It was a theoretical foundation of the Great Vehicle Buddhism. After the dimensional storms, a Buddhist figured out a Primordial Energy Art from it. Along with the Agama, it was ranked as the two greatest Primordial Energy Art in Buddhism. They were Primordial Energy Arts capable of the Epic stage, in no way inferior to the Li family\u2019s Invincible Connate Divine Art.However, Zhou Wen had never heard of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. This name sounded like a joke.After getting the blood-colored avatar to approach it and carefully look at its contents, he immediately felt his mind groggy, with his head almost exploding.This sutra is odd! Zhou Wen was alarmed. Just as he was about to cast his gaze away, he suddenly felt the Primordial Energy in his body slow down.Ever since Zhou Wen cultivated the Lost Immortal Sutra, it would constantly flow without him needing to deliberately cultivateit.Now, the sudden slowdown of the Lost Immortal Sutra\u2019s automatic circulation speed was unprecedented. However, after it slowed down, Zhou Wen felt his splitting headache seem to alleviate.When Zhou Wen looked at the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra again, he no longer felt the discomfort.He was surprised as he continued reading the sutra. He realized that the more of it he read, the slower the Lost Immortal Sutra\u2019s circulation became.There was just too much text on the monument, so before Zhou Wen could finish reading it, the screen went black\u2014the blood-colored avatar had died.Ah! Only then did Zhou Wen recall that he had Blood Meditation activated the entire time. By reading the sutra for an extended period of time, Blood Meditation had expended all his Primordial Energy and stopped circulating.From the looks of it, Small Buddha Temple is just like the stairs. It has an odd force blanketing it. Without Blood Meditation to protect me, means death. If I had known earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have read the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, Zhou Wen thought.Dripping a drop of blood and entering the Underground Buddha City dungeon again, Zhou Wen first headed for the lotus pond, planning to kill the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus. It was best if a Companion Egg dropped and even if none dropped, a Primordial Energy Crystal was appreciated.However, to his dismay, after spending plenty of effort, all that dropped was a 14-valued Strength Crystal when he finally killed the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus.When the blood-colored avatar picked up the Strength Crystal and absorbed it, its Strength stat didn\u2019t grow. It remained at 10.From the looks of it, even if I cultivate the Lost Immortal Sutra, the bottleneck of my realm remains. I\u2019m unable to exceed the limitations of 10 points at the Mortal stage. Zhou Wen felt somewhat disappointed.After killing all the Buddha Heart Lotuses and finally replenishing ten points of Primordial Energy, Zhou Wen headed for the Small Buddha Temple.This time, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t waste time at the stone monument. After entering the temple, he headed straight for the grand hall\u2019s entrance.The grand hall was already in a shambles. Its roof had mostly collapsed and its door was slanted, about to topple at any moment. There wasn\u2019t any sign above the door, so the name of the hall was unknown.The blood-colored avatar pushed the door, causing it to creak and fall into the hall. With a thud, it sent dust flying into the air.Looking at the dust-laden hall, his eyes first noticed a Buddha statue.Although the game had a cartoon version of a Buddha statue, it still shocked Zhou Wen. Buddha statues typically had genial looks and stately bearing. Only a few guardians had furious glares.However, those kinds of deities would never be consecrated in the middle of the main hall. Yet, this Buddha statue wore a devil\u2019s expression. Although it didn\u2019t have a furious expression, it made Zhou Wen shudder. It seemed to be staring at him coldly.Boom! Zhou Wen only managed to take one look because the blood-colored avatar exploded the moment it took a step into the hall. It reduced to a pool of blood and the game screen went black.Zhou Wen broke out into a cold sweat. Small Buddha Temple sure is odd. Just one look can kill. Thankfully, I didn\u2019t head there with my real body; otherwise, no amount of lives could keep me alive. I wonder how those predecessors explored dimensional zones. Perhaps plenty of lives were sacrificed to attain what we have today.Although Zhou Wen knew of stories of the tragic sacrifices when soldiers explored dimensional zones while in school, it was nowhere as shocking as experiencing it himself.Zhou Wen then had another thought. After entering the hall, even Blood Meditation is useless. However, the temple has a stone monument with the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. Perhaps it might be of some use. However, there\u2019s clearly a Primordial Energy Art and I\u2019ve already cultivated Lost Immortal Sutra. I can\u2019t change my Primordial Energy Art and this Small Buddha Temple is so odd. Who knows if that Primordial Energy Art has any problems.After some hesitation, Zhou Wen decided to first memorize the sutra when entering the Small Buddha Temple.As for taking pictures, that could be struck off. Ordinary phones couldn\u2019t take pictures of the screen of the mysterious phone, so all Zhou Wen could do was memorize it himself.The sutra was very long, but thankfully, it wasn\u2019t like the Lost Immortal Sutra which made memorizing untenable. Zhou Wen memorized a few paragraphs each time and left Small Buddha Temple whenever the time was almost up. He would then head back in once he recovered his Primordial Energy.After he had memorized the entire sutra, he realized that the sky had lit up. He had stayed up the entire night again.Just as Zhou Wen remembered the last line of the sutra, Lost Immortal Sutra, which had nearly stopped circulating, suddenly circulated crazily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Let Me Game in Peacechapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHowever, the circulatory path wasn\u2019t that of the Lost Immortal Sutra, but a brand new one. It seemed as though he had completely switched Primordial Energy Arts.Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra? Zhou Wen immediately recalled that the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra he memorized followed such circulatory methods.With the Primordial Energy\u2019s circulation, Zhou Wen felt the cells in his body seem to come to life. His body burned and itched as though countless worms were crawling under his skin.He resisted the urge to scratch himself, but in fact, he didn\u2019t dare move. When the energy flowed into him according to the Lost Immortal Sutra, he could move freely, but the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra was different. The turbulent flowing of Primordial Energy made Zhou Wen afraid of moving, afraid that it would branch out wrongly.After sitting on the sofa for quite some time, Zhou Wen felt his body jolt as though some shackle had been cleaved apart. His body relaxed indescribably as the hot and itchy feeling vanished.Zhou Wen could sense that he had achieved initial mastery of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.Opening his eyes and planning to look at his phone, Zhou Wen got a fright when he looked at his hands.They were covered in lumps of peeled skin. He ripped off the skin without feeling any pain. In fact, it felt awesome.Soon, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn\u2019t just his hands. His entire body had shed a layer of skin. Large amounts of dead skin could be easily peeled off by him.He had no choice but to head for the bathroom and soak himself in hot water. The dead skin on his body peeled off, revealing supple new skin that had a milky luster to it.He looked at himself in the mirror after taking a bath. There weren\u2019t any intrinsic differences other than he now looked more refreshed and cleaner.Returning to the living room, he once again lost himself to gaming. After he saw the stats of the blood-colored avatar, he couldn\u2019t help but be alarmed.After cultivating the Lost Immortal Sutra, his four stats were at 10. It didn\u2019t improve even if he absorbed dimensional crystals.But now, his Constitution had raised to 11.Zhou Wen subconsciously looked at the other stats which hadn\u2019t changed. Even the listing of Primordial Energy Art remained as Lost Immortal Sutra. It didn\u2019t have the addition of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.What happened? Why didn\u2019t the game indicate my mastering of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra? Could it be that the game is unable to identify this kind of Primordial Energy Art? Zhou Wen felt puzzled as he attempted to circulate it and found it circulating as he wished. Clearly, he had gained some initial mastery of it.He attempted to circulate the Lost Immortal Sutra and his Primordial Energy immediately circulated according to its pathway just as it had before without any changes.Odd, what\u2019s happening? Zhou Wen made a few more attempts and realized that he could freely switch between the Lost Immortal Sutra and Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra without any difficulty.Zhou Wen seldom heard of people cultivating two Primordial Energy Arts at the same time. Many Primordial Energy Skills could be learned, but Primordial Energy Arts involved too many things. Typically, the higher the grade of the arts, the more conflict they had, making it difficult to cultivate two at the same time. It was especially so with arts capable of the Epic stage. If one were to cultivate both, it was possible to suffer a deviation and end up dyingTo be able to switch freely between two Primordial Energy Arts was something Zhou Wen had never seen before.He was just about to attempt using the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra to enter the temple when he heard his phone ring.\u201cZhou Wen, it\u2019s about time. Let\u2019s meet at the lotus pond,\u201d Hui Haifeng\u2019s voice sounded over the phone.\u201cGot it.\u201d Zhou Wen looked at the time and realized that it was almost nine. Although he hadn\u2019t taken a wink of sleep the entire night, he was in no way tired.He rushed to Underground Buddha City after packing up.\u201cZhou Wen, you sure made us wait,\u201d Gao Yang said in displeasure.\u201cI don\u2019t think I was late, right?\u201d Zhou Wen looked at the time. It was ten minutes to the agreed-upon time.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about that. Here\u2019s the information on our Companion Beasts. Have a look.\u201d Hui Haifeng handed Zhou Wen a tablet computer.The information included the details of the four people\u2019s four Companion Beast, including Hui Haifeng. There were even videos of the skills their Companion Beasts could release. It made it easy for Zhou Wen to understand what abilities they had.After carefully taking in the information, Zhou Wen looked up and asked Hui Haifeng, \u201cYou plan to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with the four Legendary Companion Beasts without joining the battle, right?\u201d\u201cWe only have one life after all. It\u2019s best if we don\u2019t take risks.\u201d Hui Haifeng looked at Zhou Wen and said, \u201cIf four Companion Beasts aren\u2019t enough, I can still think of other solutions.\u201d\u201cAs long as your control isn\u2019t too poor, these four Companion Beasts should be enough. However, I have to make it clear. All of you have to obey my instructions. If any problems arise due to the disobedience of my instructions, I will not be responsible for anything. I will not refund the Companion Egg either,\u201d Zhou Wen said.\u201cNo problem. We\u2019ll leave it all up to you.\u201d Hui Haifeng was rather obliging.\u201cAlright then. Let me go through the detailed plan. However, a plan is ultimately a plan. When the actual battle happens, follow my orders.\u201d Zhou Wen informed them of his plan.Hui Haifeng and company didn\u2019t raise any objections after hearing it. One of the girls named Nana looked at Zhou Wen with piqued interest and asked, \u201cIf we follow your instructions in battle, but end up failing to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus or have any losses, what will you do?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make compensation,\u201d Zhou Wen said casually.\u201cAlright.\u201d Nana was very pleased with his reply.Zhou Wen pointed at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus and said, \u201cIf there are no other problems, let\u2019s begin now,\u201dHui Haifeng and company summoned their Legendary Companion Beasts\u2014three of them were birds while Nana\u2019s was a vine. According to the detailed information, this was a Water Wisteria at the Legendary stage. It could resist the lotus pond\u2019s corrosive nature and could move in the water. It was a plant-based Companion Beast that was excellent at water combat.Under Zhou Wen\u2019s command, the four Companion Beasts charged into the lotus pond.Many students were watching this battle. Although the battle involving Zhou Wen and Li Xuan was interesting, they had failed to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. This time, with Hui Haifeng participating, many students believed that there was a high possibility of slaying it.Not far away, two of the university\u2019s teachers were looking at the lotus pond.\u201cMiss Wang, do you think Hui Haifeng and the rest will succeed?\u201d Liu Zhengyan looked at the four Companion Beasts rushing into the lotus pond and asked in passing.\u201cZhou Wen and Li Xuan nearly succeeded the last time. This time, Li Xuan has been swapped with the stronger Hui Haifeng. The chance of victory is naturally higher,\u201d Wang Fei said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It doesn\u2019t seem to be the same one?\u201d Wang Fei gave the video a look and immediately saw a few soldiers fighting the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus via their Companion Beasts.Liu Zhengyan said, \u201cThis is a blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus found by the military elsewhere in Underground Buddha City. They used five Legendary Companion Beasts but ended up with tragic losses. They were almost wiped out.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d Wang Fei was somewhat alarmed.Liu Zhengyan skipped to the end of the video and let Wang Fei watch carefully. The final scene had twenty to thirty jets of blood spew out from the lotus receptacle.Once they were hit by the blood, the flesh melted off the five Legendary Companion Beasts, plummeting them into the lotus pond amidst cries. None of them survived with an intact body.\u201cI never expected the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus to have such an ability. Should we stop Hui Haifeng and the rest?\u201d Wang Fei frowned after finishing the video.Liu Zhengyan shook his head and said, \u201cIf we were to warn them now, who can warn them when they head to some unknown dimensional zone in an expedition? Cruel reality is the best teacher. Today, they will pay for the experience using only a few Companion Beasts. In the future, it might save their lives.\u201dWang Fei nodded slightly. Liu Zhengyan was right-in school, the dimensional zones they encountered had all been explored by the military. The level of danger wasn\u2019t too high, causing some students to think little of dimensional zones. It was also good to let them suffer a little.\u201cMr. Liu, what\u2019s your take on Zhou Wen?\u201d Wang Fei\u2019s gaze landed on Zhou Wen who was overseeing the battle.\u201cTo be honest, although his performance with Li Xuan was very exciting, I still think more highly of Li Xuan when it comes to potential. After all, to go far, relying on talent and hard work isn\u2019t enough. Besides, I\u2019ve heard that Zhou Wen is engrossed in gaming. He might not amount to much.\u201d Liu Zhengyan paused and looked at Wang Fei. \u201cYou are the teacher in charge of Zhou Wen\u2019s class, right? I\u2019m afraid it will be hard for you.\u201dWang Fei nodded as she looked at the distant Zhou Wen with a deep, meaningful look. She muttered to herself, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. This Zhou Wen might be quite an interesting fellow.\u201dUnder Zhou Wen\u2019s commands, the four Companion Beasts besieged the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Hui Haifeng and the other three followed his instructions and were good at controlling their Companion Beasts. Soon, they tore open the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s petals and defeated the venomous toad.After the toad exploded, the four controlled their Companion Beasts to charge at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, hoping to slay it.\u201cWindchime Bird, Blood Raven, retreat ten meters. Water Wisteria, retreat fifteen meters. Crow Tengu, head left seven meters and shoot Crow Feathers,\u201d Zhou Wen instructed.Seeing that victory was at hand and that the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus was about to die, the boy controlling the Blood Raven said in excitement, \u201cLet me finish the final strike. Blood Raven, cast Blood Feather Storm!\u201dHui Haifeng and Nana had followed Zhou Wen\u2019s instructions and retreated the Companion Beasts they controlled. As for the boy, he didn\u2019t make his Blood Raven retreat and instead launched the final strike.Everything had gone too smoothly, so smoothly that he felt he could complete everything without the need for Zhou Wen.As the blood feathers hit the lotus receptacle, it immediately riddled them with wounds. It seemingly cracked open as the boy felt a sense of smugness when he heard a boom.The lotus receptacle suddenly exploded as blood splattered out, instantly raining down.The Companion Beasts of Hui Haifeng and the other two had already retreated according to Zhou Wen\u2019s instructions. They reacted with great composure, retreating out of reach of the blood rain\u2019s range in a timely fashion.As for the Blood Raven, it was too close to the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus since it hadn\u2019t retreated ahead of time. It had no time to escape and it was drenched by the blood rain.Gu!The Blood Raven cried out tragically as most of its feathers rotted. It fell straight into the lotus pond, leaving all the other students drawing a cold gasp. The boy\u2019s expression also turned nasty.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t say a thing as he continued commanding, \u201cWindchime Bird, cast Primordial Energy Skill attack to attack the flower stalk. Crow Tengu, use Crow Feathers as cover. Water Wisteria, prepare to catch the lotus flower.\u201dUnder Zhou Wen\u2019s command, the trio successfully slew the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus and dragged the damaged lotus flower out.\u201cJunior, not bad,\u201d Nana said with a smile.\u201cBlood Raven\u2019s death wasn\u2019t my responsibility. I\u2019m not making compensation,\u201d Zhou Wen said.The boy who controlled Blood Raven blushed as he said in embarrassment, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m sorry, I was just too anxious. Zhou Wen, you were impressive. How did you know that the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus still had such an internecine attack?\u201d\u201cFaced with any dimensional creature, one has to view it with a sense of fear and reverence. Otherwise, you might end up paying with your life. I was only trying my best to prevent any accidents.\u201d Zhou Wen randomly gave an excuse.\u201cI have to thank you or we would have really suffered terribly,\u201d Hui Haifeng said with narrowed eyes. He didn\u2019t mind the losses, but Zhou Wen\u2019s performance had garnered his interest.\u201cI was paid so it was part and parcel of my job. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll be heading back.\u201d After Zhou Wen said that, he turned and left. The only thing on his mind was to head to Small Buddha Temple\u2019s main temple and figure out what was inside. He really didn\u2019t have the mood to say anything else.Gao Yang watched Zhou Wen leave with mixed expressions. He always felt that Hui Haifeng\u2019s hiring of Zhou Wen was superfluous, but now, he realized that without Zhou Wen, it was very likely that all four Companion Beasts would have died. It was better to lose a single Companion EggLiu Zhengyan also wore an odd look. \u201cStrange, could it be that he has a relationship with the military and has seen that video?\u201dWang Fei smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that Zhou Wen\u2019s staying at the Four Seasons Garden was arranged by the An family?\u201d\u201cI see. No wonder.\u201d Only then was Liu Zhengyan enlightened.However, Wang Fei narrowed her eyes as she watched Zhou Wen leave. She still had something she didn\u2019t say: Although Zhou Wen\u2019s ties with the An family aren\u2019t to be dismissed, this is definitely not obtained from the An family. How did this fellow do it? What an interesting chap. From the looks of it, I should delve deeper and treat it as helping Little Lan.Zhou Wen returned to his dorm and eagerly launched the game on his phone, entering Underground Buddha City.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Let Me Game in Peacechapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen was already very familiar with Underground Buddha City. He rode on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to the lotus pond at full speed before killing the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus.For others to kill the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus, they needed to wait for one to travel through the dimensional rift; however, Zhou Wen simply needed to revive his blood-colored avatar and refresh the dungeon, allowing the game to reproduce a new Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus. He could practically kill it an infinite number of times.Killing the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus was extremely easy for Zhou Wen now. After following a standard set of steps, it was killed.Ding! An item dropped out of the lotus accompanying the crisp, melodic chime.A Companion Beast! Zhou Wen was overjoyed for he never expected it.However, he was currently unable to incubate Legendary Companion Beasts. The thing he could do was use the blood-colored avatar\u2019s death to create an incomplete one just like the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.There was little meaning to doing so. Zhou Wen already found it difficult enough to rear a single Silver-Winged Flying Ant, so another one would probably bankrupt him.When the blood-colored avatar picked up the Buddha Heart Lotus, the system gave the fusion notification.\u2018Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus and Silver-Winged Flying Ant have a compatibility score of 3%. Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus and Mutated Skeleton Ant have a compatibility score of 5%. Proceed with fusion?\u2019Fusion my ass. Zhou Wen felt depressed. The compatibility score was so low that the chance of a successful fusion was no different from striking the lottery. There was no need for him to take the risk.If only I could take the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus out of the game. Zhou Wen spent some time studying if it was possible, but there was no such function to be found.However, Zhou Wen also realized that he couldn\u2019t sell it if he brought it into reality. It would be difficult to explain how he had obtained a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg.Using the mysterious phone\u2019s function, Zhou Wen directly checked the Companion Egg\u2019s stats.Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus: LegendaryLegendary Life Providence: Turbid Waters Clear LotusStrength: 15Speed: 13Constitution: 12Primordial Energy: 18Talent Skill: Blood-Patterned Buddha AspectZhou Wen felt somewhat disappointed after seeing that. The Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus wasn\u2019t too terrible in stats compared to the typical Legendary Companion Beast; however, compared to how potent a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus was, this Companion Beast\u2019s stats were nothing laudable.It was especially so for the talent skills. The Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus should have four Primordial Energy Skills, but this one only had one. Clearly, these weren\u2019t the stats an excellent Companion Beast should have.Zhou Wen had been somewhat hesitant in the beginning, but he no longer had any doubts now. He chose not to proceed with the fusion and fed the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.He originally imagined that the Silver-Winged Flying Ant wouldn\u2019t need to be fed after becoming an adult, but he soon realized that he was wrong. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant not only needed food, but it needed more than before.After feeding the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, there weren\u2019t any obvious changes other than the slightly hungry notification disappearing.I can always wait till I have an excellent-grade Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus drop before incubating it. Zhou Wen naturally wished to have a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Beast with maximum stats.After all, he had plenty of time to grind the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus in the future, so getting one was only a matter of time and luck.After slaying all the Buddha Heart Lotuses in the pond, he didn\u2019t obtain any ordinary Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Eggs and headed straight for Small Buddha Temple.After entering Small Buddha Temple, Zhou Wen switched his energy circulation from the Lost Immortal Sutra to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. Then, he controlled the blood-colored avatar to head into the temple hall.The Buddha statue still wore a ferocious expression as it stared at the blood-colored avatar, but this time, the latter didn\u2019t immediately die.I\u2019ve succeeded. The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra is really related to this temple hall. Zhou Wen was delighted as he continued proceeding forward with the blood-colored avatar. Finally, he saw what was inside the temple hall.The temple hall had many Buddhist murals; however, they were different from the murals Zhou Wen had seen in the past. The murals here looked like scenes from hell.There were ox-headed demons being thrown into boiling oil as well as bird-headed and human-bodied monsters having their tongues pulled out. There were also imps who were sawn into two. The entire temple appeared creepy and terrifying as though it was a punishment chamber in hell.And the Buddha statue was very different from the typical one. Other than its ferocious face, it also had two other faces.It had three faces on one head, with the one facing Zhou Wen looking ferocious. As for the faces on the sides, the left one looked similar to the ordinary Buddha statue with a benevolent look and smile.However, the right face was even stranger than the front-facing face. It was a crying face with bloody tears at the corner of its eyes. There was a sliver of melancholy amidst the ferociousness.What Buddha is that? Zhou Wen was alarmed and puzzled, he had never heard of any three-faced Buddha in the little he knew of Buddhism.The temple didn\u2019t have a sign, nor were there any signs indicating the name of the Buddha statue. The entire hall was empty except for the Buddha. There weren\u2019t any dimensional creatures either.Amidst Zhou Wen\u2019s puzzlement, he saw the Buddha statue\u2019s six eyes light up with a golden glow. Then, the statue which appeared to be carved from stone slowly suffused a golden halo, making it appear gilded.Zhou Wen was alarmed as he tried to get the blood-colored avatar to retreat. There was definitely something sinister due to the anomaly. Although death in-game wasn\u2019t true death, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t wish to waste a drop of blood.However, before Zhou Wen could retreat out of the hall, the six eyes shone out like a torchlight, illuminating his body. Then, he saw the Buddha statue speak.However, the words said were soundless. Instead, they appeared onscreen in text form.\u2018My pious child, a Buddhist representative that walks the land, you shall earn the grace of Buddha. You can choose one of the three Buddhist-type creatures as your guardian.\u2019As the text appeared, the two arms of the Buddha statue\u2019s gilded body raised up slowly. In his palms, swirls of light condensed and gradually formed three Companion Eggs.The three Companion Eggs were resplendent with golden light as though they were emitting a strange Buddhistic glow.That nice? A Companion Egg is given directly? Is it the same for the Small Buddha Temple in reality? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he carefully sized up the three Companion Eggs.They were glowing with golden light as though protected by the Buddhistic glow. The only difference was the size, making it obvious that they were not the same Companion Beast.Zhou Wen tried to use the phone to check the three Companion Eggs\u2019 stats, but failed. All he could do was try his luck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Using the blood-colored avatar as a comparison, the biggest Companion Egg was about half a person\u2019s height. Not only did it have a golden Buddha glow swirling around it, but there was even a scarlet hue amidst the golden glow. Although its temperature couldn\u2019t be felt, the huge egg seemed to be scorching hot inside.The leftmost Companion Egg was the smallest. It was about the size of the blood-colored avatar\u2019s fingertip. It was also golden, but the Companion Egg was crystalline like a golden opal.The middle Companion Egg was about the size of a soccer ball. It looked like it was tempered with gold and its outer shell was filled with rugged patterns. They looked like Buddhist scriptures that Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t understand.Which one should I choose? Zhou Wen sized up the three Companion Eggs, having been thrown into a dilemma.Although he could sense the same sensory feelings as the blood-colored avatar, he wasn\u2019t able to tell which was better from its vision.\u2018My child, choose by following your heart. There\u2019s no need to hesitate.\u2019 The strange three-faced Buddha spoke again. And again, it appeared in text form.Zhou Wen thought for a while and realized that there was nothing to be hesitant about. He had never heard of the three Companion Eggs before and had nothing to base his judgment on. He might as well choose one that caught his fancy and leave the rest to fate.With this in mind, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t hesitate further. He got the blood-colored avatar to reach out to grab the smallest of the three Companion Eggs.The small Companion Egg appeared like a golden crystal in the blood-colored avatar\u2019s hand. Immediately, the Buddhistic glow emitted.\u2018Obtained Mythical Companion Egg, Truth Listener. Automatically incubating\u2026\u2019\u201cF**k\u2026 You are going to kill me\u2026\u201d Zhou Wen immediately cried out as he threw the mysterious phone out of his hand.A Mythical Companion Egg was very strong and impressive, but Zhou Wen knew himself. With his Primordial Energy, just incubating a Legendary Companion Egg was enough to suck him dry, much less a Mythical Companion Egg.Unfortunately, Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t fast with the throwing. A terrifying force surged out from the phone and instantly sucked dry Zhou Wen\u2019s Primordial Energy.11 points of Primordial Energy was pathetic. Zhou Wen instantly felt drained and that wasn\u2019t all. His blood seemed to be sucked by a water pump, gathering towards his ten fingers.The tips of his fingers burst as ten spouts of blood spewed onto the phone, and instantly, the phone sucked it clean.I\u2019m doomed. Am I going to be the first college student in the new era to die gaming? This thought flashed across his mind, but the suction force from the phone vanished the next second.Zhou Wen\u2019s fingers finally regained their freedom. They no longer had blood gushing out. At the same time, a strange golden pattern appeared on his left ear.The golden pattern resembled a symbol that tattooed itself on the back of his left concha. It gave him a warm, fuzzy feeling in his left ear.I actually incubated a Mythical Companion Egg? Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t believe the outcome for it was too unbelievable.A Legendary Silver-Winged Flying Ant Companion Egg was enough to kill the blood-colored avatar, but the Mythical Companion Egg didn\u2019t blast it apart. It only sucked dry all of Zhou Wen\u2019s Primordial Energy and a portion of his blood. This didn\u2019t seem to match the status of a Mythical Companion Beast.After Zhou Wen incubated Truth Listener, the two other Companion Eggs in the three-faced Buddha\u2019s hands disappeared. The resplendent Buddha statue that emitted a Buddhistic glow also slowly converged its glow and was restored to its original stone form. It no longer spoke or did anything.Zhou Wen hurriedly checked Truth Listener\u2019s stats to confirm whether it was really a Mythical Companion Beast.Truth Listener: Mortal (Evolvable)Strength: 11Speed: 11Constitution: 11Primordial Energy: 11Talent Skill: Truth Listener, Indestructible Golden Body, Evil Warding, Nine ExtremesCompanion Form: EarringZhou Wen\u2019s eyes nearly popped out. Truth Listener wasn\u2019t at the Mythical stage but at the Mortal stage. However, Zhou Wen had never really heard of a Mortal Companion Beast with 11 for all its stats.Furthermore, it had four talent skills. This was already the maximum number of talent skills a Companion Beast could have.The system\u2019s notification said that it was at the Mythical stage, but why is the incubated result at the Mortal stage? Could it be related to the evolvable trait? But how do I evolve it? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s like the Silver-Winged Flying Ant-evolving by eating Companion Eggs? Zhou Wen didn\u2019t dare to stay in the temple any longer, worried that something bad might happen.After leaving, he circled Small Buddha Temple and realized that it lived up to its name-it was really small. Apart from the temple hall, there weren\u2019t any other temples, but it was possible that the collapsed rubble had covered the other areas of the compound.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t find anything after circling Small Buddha Temple once. The three-faced Buddha didn\u2019t react when he entered the temple again.All he could do was leave and quit the game. Only then did he dare summon Truth Listener.Small Buddha Temple was just too odd. Even in the game, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t dare mess around in there.Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t a stranger to the name Truth Listener\u2019; in fact, he knew it well.In Buddhist myths and legends, Truth Listener was the mount of K\u0219itigarbha Bodhisattva. Legend has it that it was manifested from a white dog and had the ability to know all that happened in the world. It was also extremely loyal.In Journey to the West, the six-eared Macaque had impersonated Sun Wukong and no deity was able to distinguish between them. Although Truth Listener could tell them apart, it didn\u2019t dare speak it out loud.Don\u2019t tell me this fellow is really the legendary Truth Listener? Zhou Wen felt somewhat expectant.However, after Truth Listener was summoned, Zhou Wen was left somewhat depressed. It wasn\u2019t a white dog but a golden-silk monkey the size of a palm.Its golden fur resembled golden silk and its eyes resembled two golden gems. It looked extremely adorable, but it was just too small.This fellow is Truth Listener? Zhou Wen found it somewhat unbelievable.This mini-figure stood at opposite ends with those terrifying stats. They didn\u2019t seem connected at all.Zhou Wen tried Truth Listener\u2019s companion form and immediately, it turned into a golden earring behind Zhou Wen\u2019s left ear.He felt his ear quiver suddenly as though whatever blockage in his ear had been pulled out. His hearing became clear, many times sharper than his normal hearing. What he couldn\u2019t hear before could now be heard very clearly.\u201cUh!\u201d A woman\u2019s moan suddenly sounded in Zhou Wen\u2019s ear, making him feel somewhat odd. When he glanced at the direction it came, he realized it was from his neighbor.And his neighbor was that proud and cold, somewhat crazy, An Jing.That\u2019s not right. The buildings here should have special soundproofing features. Even those with hearing Primordial Energy Skills can\u2019t hear things through the walls, so how am I hearing what\u2019s happening next door? Don\u2019t tell me that Truth Listener boosts my hearing ability this much? Zhou Wen thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he hesitated whether to take a look.But when he considered how An Jing was an unreasonable person, he decided it was best not to have anything to do with her. Besides, they were on campus with the most advanced hospital attached to it. If An Jing really was in trouble, she was a phone call away from having a doctor rush over to rescue her.Zhou Wen was just about to take off the Truth Listener earring when he heard a thud as though something heavy had fallen to the ground.When the sound reached Zhou Wen\u2019s left ear, a blurry scene of An Jing falling to the ground from a great height appeared in his mind. The scene vanished almost as quickly as it came when it was silent next door.Don\u2019t tell me that something really happened to An Jing? Although Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t too concerned with An Jing, he didn\u2019t have a blood feud with her. On the account of her mother, Ouyang Lan, he couldn\u2019t just watch as she died.After some hesitation, Zhou Wen decided to head next door to take a look.Washing his face and walking out of the building, he jumped over the low wooden fence and stood in front of An Jing\u2019s door and pressed the bell that came equipped with acamera.Zhou Wen believed that if An Jing could reply, it meant that she was okay. He could then return to gaming.However, if no one replied, it definitely meant that something had gone wrong. He couldn\u2019t just sit idle; after all, he had a basic sense of compassion. He would call emergency services even for a stranger.After pressing the doorbell once, he didn\u2019t hear any response as the building was silent. Zhou Wen used the ring on his left ear to listen carefully, but still failed to hear any sounds inside. There weren\u2019t any footsteps either.Don\u2019t tell me something really happened? Zhou Wen frowned slightly. To make sure, he repeatedly pressed the doorbell, but silence was the only response.From the looks of it, something really happened. Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen began looking carefully at the building.The door had a keypad door lock and it was made of special materials. It wasn\u2019t easy to smash through the door. If he couldn\u2019t enter, he planned on reporting it to the school.Shifting his glance up, he realized that the special tempered glass sliding door on the second-floor balcony was closed but not locked. He leaped up to the balcony, opened the sliding door and entered the building.The buildings in Four Seasons Garden were identical. Zhou Wen rushed straight for the bedroom with great familiarity.Fortunately, the problem happened in the bedroom. If something untoward had happened in the cultivation room, I\u2019ll probably have to report it to the school authorities. I wonder if they will be in time to save her though. Zhou Wen opened the unlocked door and entered.What welcomed him was An Jing in bed, her face shockingly pale. Her eyes were closed as she gritted her teeth tightly. She was profusely sweating and her body appeared stiff. She didn\u2019t look like she was in a good condition.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Zhou Wen walked forward and crouched down beside An Jing. He then pinched the bottom of her nose.However, An Jing wished she were dead. Due to her physique, she had been diagnosed with a strange illness. She had periodic relapses that would leave her body in excruciating pain. In serious cases, her entire body would go numb and she would remain motionless.Thankfully, this strange illness was like a woman\u2019s period. It came rather punctually and An Jing could expect when it would happen. During those periods of time, she would stay in her room to silently endure the pain until itwas over.Today, she had planned to stay in bed to silently endure the pain just like she usually did. But this episode was worse than normal, so she couldn\u2019t help but let out a soft, painful moan. This was heard by Zhou Wen wearing Truth Listener as an earring.Due to the pain, An Jing fell from the bed while rolling about. The fall made her body stiff and motionless, but she remained lucid.She had also heard Zhou Wen pressing the doorbell. She believed that he would leave without any response, but to her surprise, he had barged in by jumping into her balcony.An Jing felt deep regret for not locking the sliding door.In fact, she wasn\u2019t to be blamed. They were in Sunset College after all. Only students were admitted inside and there were surveillance cameras everywhere. Since no one knew of her physical problem, they wouldn\u2019t dare barge into her room.When Zhou Wen walked towards the bedroom, An Jing kept enduring the pain while praying that he wouldn\u2019t enter. This was because she was only wearing a nightgown.A symptom of each episode was profuse sweating, so there was a need to change her clothes. To reduce the trouble, she changed into a nightgown.Furthermore, An Jing\u2019s current position was rather unbecoming due to her fall. Having received etiquette lessons from a young age, she couldn\u2019t accept others seeing her in that pose, especially Zhou Wen who she treated as her enemy.He clearly didn\u2019t think too much about it. He treated her as a patient and asked while pinching her nose. \u201cCan you hear me? Canyou?\u201dAn Jing opened her eyes and glared at Zhou Wen, but that was all she could do. At this moment, her pain had already reached its climax. Her body was stiff and her entire body was trembling. Even her teeth were chattering, so she had no strength to speak.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll call the doctor for you.\u201d Zhou Wen felt relieved when he saw her open her eyes. Since she wasn\u2019t dead, there was likely a chance of treating her.He didn\u2019t hesitate and took out his ordinary phone and called the school\u2019s emergency number to get the hospital to send a doctor over.As a student of Four Seasons Garden, the perks they enjoyed were pretty good. They also had the best medical facilities.An Jing fumed with anxiety when she saw him about to call the hospital. Her ailment wasn\u2019t something an ordinary doctor could treat, so visiting the hospital was pointless. Otherwise, with the An family\u2019s resources, she would have received the best treatment from the best doctors and hospitals in the League.What made her feel most unacceptable was that she wore a nightgown that only covered half her thigh. Also, her hair was disheveled. She couldn\u2019t accept letting other students see her in this state if she were carried out by the medical team.Although she knew that he was doing it out of goodwill, An Jing couldn\u2019t help but grit her teeth in anger.With Zhou Wen about to make the phone call, An Jing tried hard to regain control of her body. With immense willpower, she shouted through chattering teeth, \u201cD\u2026 Don\u2019t call\u2026 I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201dAn Jing was drained of all her strength by the time she said those words. Her face was even paler and her voice was intensely trembling. She almost couldn\u2019t hear what was being said.Thankfully, Zhou Wen was wearing the Truth Listener earring and could hear her clearly. However, he looked at her painful expression in a doubtful manner and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem fine. If you\u2019re sick, you need treatment. You shouldn\u2019t hide your ailment and not take medical advice. Relax and leave the rest to the doctors\u2026\u201dAn Jing was in despair. Thankfully, her pain had already climaxed and she was now feeling a lot better. Enduring the stabbing pain, she said harshly, \u201cI\u2019m really fine. Leave.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t worry. Although I don\u2019t think too highly of you, I wouldn\u2019t harm you on account of Sister Lan and my dad. I\u2019m just calling for a doctor.\u201dWith that said, Zhou Wen continued calling the emergency hotline.An Jing burned with anxiety and embarrassment as she shouted once more, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. Really, there\u2019s no need. I\u2026 I\u2026 I was having menstrual cramps\u2026 I\u2019ll be fine after some rest\u2026 Leave\u2026 Don\u2019t disturb my rest\u2026\u201dAn Jing had given that reason because she couldn\u2019t think of anything else. She just wanted him to leave.\u201cI see. I\u2019ve heard that women can be in great pain a few days a month, but I never expected it to be this bad.\u201d Zhou Wen had lived alone from a young age and he didn\u2019t have a mother Thus, he had little contact with women. When he was a little older, he began cultivating and hadn\u2019t ever had a girlfriend. He knew almost nothing about such matters.Although he remained suspicious, Zhou Wen believed that it was unlikely that she would play games with her life.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019ll leave now,\u201d Zhou Wen said in embarrassment before he turned to leave An Jing\u2019s room.An Jing heaved a sigh of relief when she saw him leave. The pain she was experiencing also seemed to lessen significantly.\u201cWomen sure have it tough. Fortunately, I\u2019m a man. I don\u2019t have to endure such pain every month,\u201d Zhou Wen mumbled to himself as he returned to his residence.However, on second thought, he realized that he had it tough as well. He had endless noise blaring into his ears like an irritating chant when he slept. He also had to lose large amounts of blood daily. It was especially so this time. To incubate Truth Listener, he had lost at least 500-600 cc of blood. He didn\u2019t have it good either.I bought some brown sugar and wolfberries last time, and I\u2019ve no idea if it will work. I might as well cook some to give it a try. My anemia has been pretty terrible recently. Zhou Wen scratched his forehead and thought to himself.Returning to his room, Zhou Wen forgot the matter of making the blood-replenishment drink as he continued grinding.This time, Zhou Wen entered the Ancient Imperial City dungeon. After killing the Skeleton General, he had a Skeleton General Companion Egg drop.However, the stats weren\u2019t comparable to the first one in every aspect. Zhou Wen directly fed it to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. As for Truth Listener, as there weren\u2019t any hunger notifications, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t know if it needed to be fed.Switching to the Underground Buddha City, he no longer had any need to explore the Small Buddha Temple again since he had finished covering the area. He had slain the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus in the lotus pond and it hadn\u2019t spawned again.Zhou Wen skipped the lotus pond and ventured deep into Underground Buddha City.In the midst of his travels, he saw a few lotus ponds, but not every one of them had a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus. After spending an entire day, only one ordinary Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg dropped.Although the stats were relatively ordinary, it was a heart-type Companion Beast. Zhou Wen incubated it, planning on using its companion form to temporarily allow his heart to continue functioning if it was ever damaged.After so many sleepless nights, Zhou Wen finally couldn\u2019t take it. He switched off his phone and slept through to the next morning. Only then did Zhou Wen get up to cook the supplements, making a pot of brown-sugar, wolfberry tea.\u201cZhou Wen, are you up? Today is matriculation day. Come on out and walk around.\u201d Just as Zhou Wen finished brewing his tea, Li Xuan called.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to see?\u201d Zhou Wen asked curiously.\u201cToday\u2019s the matriculation day for the freshmen. Many clubs in school are recruiting freshmen. We can also take a look,\u201d Li Xuan said with a chuckle.\u201cI have no interest in joining any clubs.\u201d Zhou Wen poured a cup of blood-replenishing tea and drank it.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to join one. You can take a look at all those beautiful female juniors and seniors.\u201d Li Xuan revealed his true motives.\u201cNot interested.\u201d Zhou Wen still planned on exploring Underground Buddha City.\u201cDon\u2019t be so cold. There are benefits. The school will assign missions and most of them need to be completed by a team. The seniors already have their own teams. If we want to make a new team, we will have to recruit from the freshmen. To walk around now is also to prepare for the future\u2026\u201dLi Xuan gave plenty of reasons that irritated Zhou Wen so much that he agreed to walk around campus.After drinking a huge bowl of tea, Zhou Wen filled up a thermos and walked out of his place.It just so happened that An Jing walked out at the same time. She couldn\u2019t help but grit her teeth when she saw him. However, she was slightly taken aback when she saw the glass thermos in his hand.She recognized it. There were wolfberries and other supplements in it and it was obvious that it was brewed with brown sugar. Her servants had previously prepared it for her.Do you think you can bribe me with a cup of brown-sugared water? Men almost never drank this and after what happened yesterday, An Jing imagined that he had brewed it for her, hoping to warm up his relationship with her.Although she had this in mind, the look in her eyes softened. She found Zhou Wen rather thoughtful and sensitive.When Zhou Wen walked out of his yard, An Jing came out as well. He needed to walk past her to leave the compound.She watched as Zhou Wen walked over, wondering if she should accept it if he were to give it to her.Amidst her thoughts, he arrived in front of her and saw An Jing looking at him. He nodded at her gently as a greeting.An Jing imagined that Zhou Wen was about to give her the tea when he nodded at her. She turned her head away slightly, waiting for him to hand it over.To her surprise, Zhou Wen just walked past her with the thermos in hand. He had no intention of walking towards her. Furthermore, he even drank a mouthful while walking off.\u201cIt seems to be a little too sweet,\u201d Zhou Wen muttered to himself after taking one mouthful.An Jing\u2019s face burned as her eyes nearly spewed flames.Zhou Wen hadn\u2019t paid any attention to her and walked straight out of Four Seasons Garden.Why don\u2019t you die from an overdose drinking something like that! An Jing clenched her teeth hatefully as she looked at his departing figure.Today was matriculation day. However, Sunset College was unlike the typical school. There wasn\u2019t any welcome ceremony or many decorations. Apart from the crowds, it didn\u2019t seem any different from usual.On the two sides of the road, there were two rows of tables neatly placed. There were banners and signs placed in front of themrecruitment notices of the school\u2019s clubs.Sunset College encouraged them to set up clubs, hoping that it could increase cooperation between students, especially when they entered dimensional zones to complete missions.\u201cZhou Wen, I\u2019m here.\u201d Just as Zhou Wen was looking around, he heard Li Xuan\u2019s voice from a particular club\u2019s recruitment booth.He looked over and found Li Weiyang and Li Xuan standing together, the former waving her hand at him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Many of them are beautiful female seniors.\u201dZhou Wen didn\u2019t reply as Li Xuan yelled, \u201cSis, that\u2019s not fair. How can you snatch him from me? However, it\u2019s useless even if you try. Zhou Wen and I are establishing a new club. He won\u2019t join your Weiyang Club.\u201dLi Weiyang curled her lips and said, \u201cThat depends on whether Zhou Wen is willing to establish a new club with you. Sisters, let\u2019s show our Weiyang Club\u2019s strength to our junior.\u201dThe row of female students behind-all contending in beauty and fascination-began putting up all kinds of sexy, mesmerizing, and adorable poses.

We can always complete missions together if an opportunity arises.\u201d\u201cNo problem. Absolutely no problem,\u201d Li Xuan agreed immediately, his gaze wandering across the bodies of the female students of Weiyang Club.\u201cWhat are you looking at? Little Virgin?\u201d Li Weiyang mocked Li Xuan. After saying bye to Zhou Wen, she led the girls to recruit other freshmen.Li Xuan chuckled and said, \u201cZhou Wen, you missed an excellent opportunity. The Weiyang Club usually only recruits female students. You almost became their only male member. You missed a chance of being an emperor.\u201dHowever, Zhou Wen thought nothing of it. He looked around and said, \u201cWhen can we establish the club? Can we begin recruiting members now? If we don\u2019t do it now, the better freshmen might all be taken.\u201dThe other clubs were recruiting freshmen, but Li Xuan didn\u2019t seem prepared at all.He said helplessly, \u201cThis is also beyond our control. Freshmen can only apply to set up a club one month after matriculation. Also, you will need to have at least five students before you can make the application. The typical student will choose to join existing clubs, so it will make it quite difficult for us to set up a new one. However, we wouldn\u2019t be under the mercy of others or care about other older members.\u201dZhou Wen nodded. That was one of the reasons he hadn\u2019t joined the Weiyang Club.If possible, he\u2019d rather not join any club. Gaming alone in peace was much better than joining any club.Zhou Wen looked at the freshmen entering from the school\u2019s main gates when he was suddenly taken aback. He saw two familiar figures.One of them was a tall girl and the other was a boy of medium stature. They were none other than Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong.The duo also saw Zhou Wen. They walked over with backpacks. Tian Xiangdong even greeted him in a rather triumphant manner. \u201cZhou Wen, you never expected to see us here,right?\u201d\u201cI never expected the two of you to be admitted into Sunset College.\u201d Zhou Wen was really surprised. The League had plenty of universities and Sunset College wasn\u2019t the best choice. Yet, the duo had chosen to study here.Fang Ruoxi looked at the clubs around and asked Zhou Wen, \u201cZhou Wen, have you chosen a club?\u201d\u201cBabe, Zhou Wen and I plan on setting up our own club. Join us. I\u2019ll make you vice chairwoman.\u201d Li Xuan posed handsomely and hit on Fang Ruoxi.\u201cAlright,\u201d Fang Ruoxi replied with a smile.Li Xuan never expected her to answer so quickly, leaving him stunned. Then, he said bashfully, \u201cHowever, we are all freshmen. We will only be able to apply for the club in one month. Babe, if you are in a rush, you can always take a look at the established clubs.\u201dLi Xuan might speak bombastically, but he was a genuine virgin. Furthermore, he was a virgin who didn\u2019t dare lose his virginity.\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I\u2019ll wait till your new club is established,\u201d Fang Ruoxi said firmly as she stole a glance at Zhou Wen.\u201cZhou Wen, you sure are fortunate,\u201d Li Xuan patted Zhou Wen on the shoulder and said with a smile.He naturally could tell that Fang Ruoxi was only joining because of Zhou Wen.\u201cZhou Wen, I\u2019m really sorry about what happened. Please believe me that nothing like that will ever happen again.\u201d Fang Ruoxi was naturally referring to her sudden quitting of the team during the college entrance exams.\u201cNo worries. It wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Zhou Wen didn\u2019t take it to heart.He always believed that since Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong were unrelated to him, it was only normal for them to quit.Tian Xiangdong hurriedly said with a smile, \u201cThat\u2019s right. We really had no choice. Now that we are at Sunset College, we have a promising future. We don\u2019t have to worry that much anymore. We guarantee you that nothing like that will happen again.\u2019Zhou Wen didn\u2019t speak further. Things were always unpredictable. No one knew the future, so any guarantee now was without meaning.\u201cSince we are all former schoolmates, I\u2019ll take you to the matriculation booth,\u201d Li Xuan introduced as he walked. \u201cSunset College is different from the other schools. There are very few protocols and ceremonies. There aren\u2019t any welcoming ceremonies or matriculation ceremonies for freshmen. Just register at the matriculation booth and be assigned to your dorm. Classes start tomorrow. By the way, I forgot to tell you, the first class of the first day at Sunset College is a combat test. Freshmen will be sent into dimensional zones to hunt dimensional creatures. Make sure you are mentally prepared.\u201d\u201cWhere will be the test? Buddha City?\u201d Zhou Wen asked in surprise.\u201cOf course not. Buddha City was only recently discovered. It isn\u2019t fully under control, so they won\u2019t send freshmen to take risks. Based on past experience, they will go to one of the four relatively safer dimensional zones on campus. Every freshman just needs to kill one dimensional creature to complete the mission. The more killed, the better the results,\u201d Li Xuan said.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point in that?\u201d Zhou Wen asked.\u201cCount it as a way to benchmark. Although you can be admitted into Sunset College and everyone is a top student in their various high schools, everyone\u2019s abilities are varied. Such a test allows the teachers to understand their true strength. Secondly, it\u2019s also to create a ranking of the freshmen,\u201d Li Xuan explained.\u201cWhat\u2019s the freshmen ranking?\u201d Tian Xiangdong asked out of curiosity.\u201cA results ranking. The higher the ranking, the more resources the school will provide. Consider it a reward system.\u201d Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen and continued, \u201cIf this were in the past, Zhou Wen would have had the chance to enter the top three, but there are just too many strong freshmen this year. Just An Jing alone, who advanced to the Legendary stage two to three years ago, makes her a definite first in the rankings.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wasn\u2019t too interested in such activities.Just as he reached Four Seasons Garden, he saw a few students walking in with their luggage in tow. Clearly, the special admissions students had arrived and were beginning to move in.Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t interested in them. He naturally didn\u2019t care what they looked like. He walked to the row of buildings at the back of Four Seasons Garden with his head bowed.Just as he reached the last row, he saw a girl standing in front of the other building, opening the door with her dorm key.\u201cHello there. My name is Wang Lu. You live next door, right? We will be neighbors in the future,\u201d the girl greeted Zhou Wen in a friendly manner.\u201cI\u2019m Zhou Wen.\u201d Zhou Wen replied before entering his dorm.This guy is odd. As expected of special admissions students. Do all of them have such a character? Wang Lu was curious.Zhou Wen returned to his room and used his phone to enter Ant Nest.Previously, he had encountered a bottleneck at Ant Nest. After entering, his strength hadn\u2019t allowed him to progress deeper. Now with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant evolving to an adult state, he planned on giving it another try.Ant City was identical to before. It looked mysterious and bizarre. The ants were coming in and out of their nests and many of the black-winged flying ants were flying around.He controlled the blood-colored avatar and stayed far away from the City, sending Silver-Winged Flying Ant to fly over alone.The adult Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s stats made it a pinnacle existence among Legendary Companion Beasts. With a flap of its four wings, it flew directly towards Ant City.The black-winged flying ants immediately discovered it and rushed at it while flapping their black wings. The black swarm looked rather frightening.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant moved like lightning as it used its stinger to shoot Magical Needle, tearing through the head of the black-winged flying ant that charged headfirst. It then plummeted.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant didn\u2019t stop as it shot into the ant swarm like a silver bolt of lightning\u2018Killed Black-Winged Soldier Ant. Discovered dimensional crystal.\u2019Zhou Wen saw a dimensional crystal drop due to the black-winged flying ant\u2019s death, but he was unable to pick it up due to the distance.If the blood-colored avatar were to rush into the Ant City\u2019s vicinity, it would suffer an attack. With his present strength, it would be difficult for him to survive the black-winged flying ant swarm.He kept watching as chimes kept ringing. Many dimensional crystals dropped, but Zhou Wen didn\u2019t dare pick them up. He felt quite depressed as a result.moThe Silver-Winged Flying Ant could hardly move amidst the black-winged flying ant swarm. Although he slew a lot, there were just too many of them. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant was constantly in peril with the chances of it being overwhelmed by the ant swarm at any time.Damn it. There are too many ants and they are Legendary creatures. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant can\u2019t rush in at all. Zhou Wen thought of getting the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to rush out, but it was already too late. Surrounded, it could only fight the black-winged flying ants that inundated it, the injuries it suffered increasing.Ding!Another black-winged flying ant was killed, dropping a black-winged flying ant dimensional crystal-a black-winged flying ant\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill Crystal.I\u2019ll risk it! Zhou Wen looked at the copious numbers of dimensional crystals strewn across the ground. He could hold back, but upon seeing the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal, he couldn\u2019t hold back any longer.He sent the blood-colored avatar to rush to the periphery of Ant City without any hesitation, summoning the Mutated Skeleton Ant and Truth Listener to distract the swarm.The black-winged flying ants quickly noticed him. Before he could arrive near the dimensional crystal, massive numbers of them rushed over.The Mutated Skeleton Ant tried to lead a number away, but it was only a Mortal Companion Beast. It died almost instantly under the Legendary creature horde.Using this brief moment, he leaped up and rushed towards the spot where the dimensional crystal dropped. He had his eyes fixed on the black-winged flying ant crystal.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant also died at this moment from the barrage of attacks. Its bleeding carcass fell and large numbers of black-winged flying ants turned around and rushed for the blood-colored avatar.Let me pick it up! Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar and used his greatest Speed and Strength to grab that black-winged flying ant crystal.However, when its fingers were two feet away from the crystal, a large swarm of black-winged flying ants had rushed over, drowning it.Thankfully this is in-game. If I had done that in real life, death would have been a certainty. Zhou Wen looked at the black screen and wore a bitter smile.Dying without gaining anything in return was something Zhou Wen was already used to. Recently, he seldom died, unlike the period when he had first obtained the mysterious phone.Dripping a drop of blood to revive himself, Zhou Wen entered the game once more. However, he knew that his strength was still lacking if he wanted to charge into Ant City. Therefore, he headed for Underground Buddha City.Zhou Wen wished to visit Small Buddha Temple and see if he could make the selection again with the dungeon refreshed, hoping to get another Mythical Companion Egg.However, he was disappointed when he entered. Even though Small Buddha Temple had been respawned, he wasn\u2019t able to trigger the scene with the three-faced Buddha.From the looks of it, I can only obtain one Mythical Companion Egg in-game. I wonder if visiting it in real life will allow me to trigger the three-face Buddha\u2019s gift of a Companion Egg. Although Zhou Wen was somewhat tempted, he didn\u2019t wish to take the risk and finally eliminated the thought.To obtain the three-faced Buddha\u2019s Companion Egg, I apparently need to first master the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra or death is certain. Those soldiers do not know this secret, so I\u2019m afraid there will be many sacrifices. Zhou Wen had the intention of telling this secret to the scouts who explored Underground Buddha City; thus, reducing their losses. However, firstly, he didn\u2019t have the chance to interact with these soldiers and secondly, he had no way of explaining how he knew that.Suddenly, Zhou Wen\u2019s eyes lit up as he muttered, \u201cSince I can\u2019t tell them directly, I can post the strategy guide of Underground Buddha City on the League\u2019s Dimensional Forum. This way, I can receive the official\u2019s reward and also prevent those soldiers from making sacrifices in vain.\u201dThe League had always been encouraging its citizens to write out their thoughts and experiences regarding dimensional zones. For this, it had specially set up a server and an official Dimensional Forum.Posting dimensional zone strategies on the forum could be set as paid articles. It was even possible for the officials to buy the rights and use it as teaching material in textbooks.To ensure that the poster didn\u2019t have any hesitation in writing these, the Dimensional Forum used a completely independent server and high-security measures. Unless it was voted by Congress, no one could check the data of the Dimensional Forum.For this, the League had clearly set up a guarantee by law. It was to prevent experts who didn\u2019t wish to expose themselves to freely write their strategies on the forum.The League had many powerhouses who had the habit of browsing the Dimensional Forum. The typical citizen also treated it as a resource database.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Let Me Game in Peacechapter 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen didn\u2019t rush to post on the Dimensional Forum; instead, he first took a look at the other threads on it.The threads mainly had three different kinds of monetization methods.The first kind was a thread that provided a free strategy. Such threads didn\u2019t require payment when reading. According to the number of clicks, the officials would pay a certain number of Dimensional Points in a particular ratio.Of course, if the reader count was very low, one wouldn\u2019t be able to earn many Dimensional Points. 10,000 clicks were probably only enough to earn 1 Dimensional Point.Dimensional Points was the point system of the Dimensional Forum. It couldn\u2019t be spent like money or be withdrawn. However, it could be used to exchange items at the Dimensional Forum\u2019s official shop. Dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs were options for exchange and different items required a different number of points.Exchanging for an item only required a mailing address. Receipt of the goods was done with a password without any need for identification.The second kind of thread was monetized threads. Such threads could be read by paying. The price was determined by the poster and was also purchased with Dimensional Points.Of course, threads posted by unknown people on the Dimensional Forum basically didn\u2019t have many people paying to read. One had to have a certain level of fame before people considered the purchase.The third kind of thread was official threads. An official guide and strategy was provided and could typically be read at very cheap prices. Furthermore, the authenticity of the content could be guaranteed.Zhou Wen registered a Dimensional Forum account which only required a bank account number, password, and alias without any other agreements.The entry of a bank account number and password was relatively simple. As for aliases, there were many which were duplicated. It was difficult to find a unique name.Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t be bothered to think of one. He randomly tapped on the keyboard and pressed space, immediately having a few words appear in the alias field.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t know what he had written, but on careful inspection, he realized that autocomplete had filled it in as \u201cPoison.\u201d Zhou Wen subconsciously pressed confirm and realized that it could be used. The registration succeeded immediately.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t care about his alias and directly used this account to log in and post his first thread.When posting, Zhou Wen chose monetization. Firstly, he was really poor and wished to earn something to buy Companion Eggs to feed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.Secondly, there were too many threads on the Dimensional Forum. Ordinary threads very easily sank to the bottom and in comparison, monetized threads were rarer. They stayed longer on the monetized boards.After seeing the forum shop\u2019s prices for Legendary Companion Eggs, Zhou Wen set the price for his first thread to be 20,000 Dimensional Points. This was the price of two Legendary Companion Eggs.Soon, a monetized thread named \u201cSmall Buddha Temple Stone Steps Strategy\u201d appeared in the monetized board.Ordinary monetized threads ranged from a few points to a dozen points, and the more expensive ones were about a hundred points. For a thread to cost more than a thousand Dimensional Points, meant they were usually professional strategies usually written by some bigwigs on the forum.Yet, the Small Buddha Temple mentioned in the thread was almost unheard of. Even the alias which was used to post the thread was rather unfamiliar.\u201cThis must be a nutcase. 20,000 points? Only an idiot will read it.\u201d\u201cThis must be a scammer that\u2019s hoping someone gives him Dimensional Points.\u201d\u201cThe rules on the forum need to be more comprehensive. Such scams need to be held legally responsible.\u201dWang Fei was also browsing the Dimensional Forum when she suddenly saw the thread. She couldn\u2019t help but be astonished.This was because Small Buddha Temple was in Sunset College\u2019s Underground Buddha City. This secret wasn\u2019t known even by ordinary teachers of Sunset College, but Wang Fei, who had an official position, knew very well what kind of place it was.Since the person who wrote the thread knew of Small Buddha Temple and wrote the keywords \u201cstone steps,\u201d it meant that they knew something.Could it be just some nonsense? Wang Fei felt hesitant seeing the price of 20,000 points. However, if the thread really held the method of entering Small Buddha Temple, then 20,000 points was nothing.With so many lives sacrificed on the stone steps, each one of them was worth far more than 20,000 Dimensional Points.Gritting her teeth, Wang Fei paid and opened the thread. When she saw the content inside, she revealed a look of disbelief. The Heart Meditation Primordial Energy Skill at the Mortal stage can crack the oddness of the stone steps? Is this possible?The soldiers responsible for exploring the stone steps were at least at the Legendary stage. Even if they had obtained the Buddha Heart Lotus dimensional crystal, none of them would be interested in a low-grade Primordial Energy Skill. To her surprise, such a puny Heart Meditation was able to resist the stone step\u2019s mysterious powers.The thread had little content. That was all it said. Finally, it warned that one was not to enter the temple or death was a certainty.Zhou Wen had posted the thread out of goodwill, but he also had some selfishness.He only had one life, so he was worried about risking his life heading for the Small Buddha Temple in reality. If reality was different in-game, he could at least get the military to scout it out. If they could safely enter Small Buddha Temple, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate any further.After all, the military didn\u2019t know the secret of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. Even if they did, cultivating it wasn\u2019t something that could be done in a short span of time. Zhou Wen could beat them in entering the temple hall in the real world and visit the three-faced Buddha.Of course, he had to confirm that reality\u2019s Small Buddha Temple was identical to the game. Only with him being able to safely enter would he personally visit it.After Wang Fei saw the thread, she immediately made a phone call and informed the military department she came under.Before long, Wang Fei received feedback from the military. They had already sent a soldier who had cultivated Heart Meditation to attempt ascending the stone steps. He ended up entering the compound of Small Buddha Temple without dying like all the soldiers from before.The thread is real! Who\u2019s that Poison? How does he know about Small Buddha Temple? Wang Fei was shocked.Zhou Wen discovered that he had two clicks on his thread which also meant that two people had purchased his thread. Immediately, he had 40,000 Dimensional Points deposited into his account.That\u2019s some easy money. Zhou Wen was delighted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Silver-Winged Flying Ant dodged the firebird\u2019s charge with Silver Wing Flash, but the blood-colored avatar didn\u2019t have the same speed. It was already too late to summon the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to turn it into wings.Since he couldn\u2019t dodge, Zhou Wen struck out with Ashen Palm.However, when the palm made contact with the firebird, it felt like he had struck air. There was no corporeal entity to direct his force and by then, the firebird had already charged into the blood-colored avatar\u2019s body.Bang!The next second, the blood-colored avatar exploded like fireworks, turning the screen black.Unwilling to accept this, Zhou Wen dripped his blood and revived the blood-colored avatar. He charged straight for Fire God Platform and before long arrived there. This time, he was prepared. He first turned Silver-Winged Flying Ant into its companion form. Four translucent silver wings appeared behind the blood-colored avatar.Indeed, the firebird flew out from the top of the Fire God Platform once more. Zhou Wen used the flight obtained from silver wings to face off with the firebird and, although he couldn\u2019t shake it off, the firebird was unable to catch up to him.Ignoring the firebird, Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to fly towards the Fire God Platform. He wanted to see what was on top of it.The Platform was squarish in shape like a gigantic chimney. It was a thousand feet tall and although he wanted to fly to its peak, his silver wings only allowed him to fly a dozen meters or so. He wasn\u2019t able to reach higher altitudes.The Life Providence as King of Low Altitudes allows the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to be extremely agile at low altitudes, but it can\u2019t fly too high. This is a damning weakness. Zhou Wen landed on the stone steps of the Fire God Platform and seeing the firebird about to chase up to him, he summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and shot Magical Needle at it.The firebird didn\u2019t dodge and allowed it to rush straight at it.Bang!Magical Needle was useful as it exploded the firebird; however, the system didn\u2019t indicate that he had killed a dimensional creature.Zhou Wen was delighted. Just as he was about to rush up to the Fire God Platform, he saw another flame soar into the sky from the top of the platform. This time, two firebirds swooped down.Zhou Wen continued rushing up the staircase and before long, the two firebirds came to him. The blood-colored avatar gained the silver wings and faced off with the two firebirds again. After taking painstaking efforts, he finally slew the two firebirds. But this time, four firebirds flew out.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t dare kill them. All he could do was try his best to escape the firebirds\u2019 pursuit and head to the top of the Fire God Platform as quickly as he could.Unfortunately, Zhou Wen was wrong. Even if he didn\u2019t kill the firebirds, the top of the Fire God Platform sent out eight firebirds when he reached a certain height.Zhou Wen was already doing the best he could, but he wasn\u2019t the firebird\u2019s match. Soon, the blood-colored avatar had a firebird charge into his body and exploded to its death.However, from where it stood, he could already see some of the Fire God Platform\u2019s peak. There was a stone monument erected on it, but Zhou Wen was only able to see the tip and vaguely made out the word: \u2018Imperial.\u2019The game screen went black, but he didn\u2019t immediately revive again. Instead, he recalled his past experiences.After killing the firebird, there wasn\u2019t any indication of me killing dimensional creatures. This means that they aren\u2019t dimensional creatures. If they aren\u2019t, it means they are a type of Primordial Energy Skill. But why didn\u2019t the dimensional creature at the top of Fire God Platform release large numbers of firebirds at the very beginning but instead slowly double them up?Zhou Wen then thought of something. In real life, the ancient city is clearly Guide Ancient City, but the game dungeon\u2019s name is Ancient Imperial City. That Fire God Platform has a stone monument with the word \u201cImperial\u201d on it. Could it be related?Unable to figure things out immediately, Zhou Wen decided to take a rest and calm his mind.Pouring himself a cup of blood-replenishing tea, he sipped at it as he checked if there was any new income from the thread he had posted on the Dimensional Forum.He was left disappointed as the clicks remained at two. However, he had received a private message on the forum.Zhou Wen saw that the message was posted by a user named \u201cWang\u2019s Man.\u201d He clicked it and gave it a look.\u201cDear Sir, might I discuss Small Buddha Temple with you?\u201d\u201cDiscuss?\u201d Zhou Wen replied.Wang Fei always had the forum open on her phone. Although she hadn\u2019t received a reply after waiting for quite some time, she had continued waiting patiently.The discovery of Small Buddha Temple was too astonishing. After using Poison\u2019s method, the military had finally rushed into the compound of Small Buddha Temple and discovered the stone monument with the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.This discovery astounded Wang Fei and the military top brass. Such a stone monument had been discovered in other mysterious dimensional zones in the past. People had mastered the Primordial Energy Art on the stone monument and earned a mysterious Companion Beast.However, Wang Fei and the military top brass knew very well that although the Primordial Energy Art was potent, it wasn\u2019t something that anyone could cultivate. One needed the corresponding special physiques to cultivate the corresponding Primordial Energy Arts.Although they saw the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, no one dared to cultivate it. A volunteer attempted to memorize the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra on the stone monument, but a few words were enough for him to clasp his head and cry out in pain. He then died with blood gushing out of his seven orifices.A general had personally visited the stone monument before ordering all soldiers to leave Small Buddha Temple. Furthermore, all news regarding Small Buddha Temple was made top secret.Wang Fei contacted Poison on the general\u2019s orders.\u201cHave you mastered Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra?\u201d Wang Fei hurriedly asked.\u201cWhat has that got to do with you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m willing to pay large sums of money to buy information from you.\u201d Sensing the other party\u2019s tone to be somewhat impatient, Wang Fei got straight to the point and indicated her motives.\u201cWhat information? Tell me.\u201d\u201cDo you know what special physiques are needed to cultivate in the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra?\u201d Wang Fei hurriedly replied.Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He had no idea what physiques were needed. However, on second thought, he immediately came to a realization.I was wondering why the three-faced Buddha called me his child. I thought it had to do with my cultivating of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, but from the looks of it, it\u2019s not that simple. But I don\u2019t seem to possess any special physique. If Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra requires one to cultivate, how did I succeed? With this in mind, Zhou Wen\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up. Could it be the Lost Immortal Sutra?He recalled that his brain felt extreme discomfort when he began reading the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. After the Lost Immortal Sutra took effect, he was able to finish reading the former in its entirety and mastered it.From the looks of it, it\u2019s most likely Lost Immortal Sutra.Wang Fei waited for quite a while, but there was no reply. She couldn\u2019t help but feel a little uneasy, but it wasn\u2019t appropriate for her to send another message to rush the person. All she could do was continue waiting, with every second feeling like an eternity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her message was like a rock sinking into the ocean. Finally, she couldn\u2019t help but send another message, but once again, she didn\u2019t receive a reply.Unbeknownst to her, Zhou Wen had already closed the forum and was gaming away.He didn\u2019t know what physiques were needed to cultivate the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, so he naturally wasn\u2019t able to answer her. However, he didn\u2019t wish to let the other person know that he was clueless. He decided to not answer for there was a chance he could learn more from the other party in the future.But this only served to torture Wang Fei. This was because the Dimensional Forum didn\u2019t have any indication of online status, nor was there any way of checking. Therefore, she didn\u2019t know if Zhou Wen was online or not. All she could do was continue waiting.Wang Fei immediately picked up her phone when it suddenly sounded and she saw the number flash up.\u201cLittle Fei, did you figure out Poison\u2019s identity?\u201d A man\u2019s voice sounded over the phone.\u201cSorry, General Shen. There was no response from him. I\u2019m also temporarily unable to figure out his identity,\u201d Wang Fei said after a pause. \u201cGeneral Shen, can we figure out his geographical location through the forum?\u201d\u201cThe Dimensional Forum is under the Zhang family. You know what they are like. Unless Congress passes it through a vote, there\u2019s no way we can get the information from them. It\u2019s impossible. The Zhangs won\u2019t even entertain me,\u201d General Shen thought for a moment before continuing, \u201cSince Poison knows about Buddha City and Small Buddha Temple, as well as the secret of the stone steps, it means he must have been there. This place is a recently discovered dimensional zone, so not many people have been there. Apart from our military personnel, there are only the students and teachers of Sunset College. Investigate it from this angle. You have to find Poison no matter what.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wang Fei hung up and thought about how she could begin.Quite a number of students and teachers had entered Buddha City, so it wasn\u2019t an easy task to find out who they all were.Early in the morning, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan reported for class.Sunset College used an education system that followed half-restricted military practices. It was different from the typical university. Here, there was no distinction between electives and compulsory classes. They only needed to attend the lessons of one teacher. They could attend the classes of other teachers based on their own interests.Li Xuan and Zhou Wen happened to be assigned to Wang Fei\u2019s class, and she was in a rather unhappy mood today. After entering the class, she saw all the freshmen looking languid. She pursed her lips before curling the ends of her mouth slightly.\u201cStudents, from today, I\u2019ll be your counselor. Let me introduce myself. My name is Wang Fei.\u201d Wang Fei wrote her name on the board.When the students realized that she was in her late twenties, exuding a mature lady\u2019s sexiness by wearing a gray professional blazer matched with stockings, something that the female students were unable to compare with, some of the bolder students cheered.Li Xuan was clearly one of the bolder ones. He called out, \u201cMiss Wang, are you taken? If you aren\u2019t, you can consider me.\u201dUpon hearing Li Xuan\u2019s words, many students laughed out. Many students also made catcalls.Wang Fei seemed used to such situations and thought nothing of it. She shot Li Xuan a look and said, \u201cOf course. But you have to first be able to graduate while under me. Alright, this is Sunset College. The word \u2018Sunset\u2019 is a warning to us that time is precious. Our school\u2019s purpose is to cherish time. Now, I\u2019ll be assigning you your first matriculation homework. It will also be your first test. Kill a Demonized General within ten days. Each team is only allowed a maximum of four people. The kill has to be done within ninety seconds. If you fail to complete the test, you will be expelled from school. You can then seek out other opportunities for yourself. The school will also arrange for you to apply to other ordinary schools.\u201dThe noisy classroom instantly fell silent.Students who were admitted into Sunset College weren\u2019t to be trifled with. Before arriving on campus, many of them had gained an understanding of Sunset College via various channels.To have a test on the first day of classes was a tradition of Sunset College. It wasn\u2019t much of a surprise.However, to slay a Demonized General within ninety seconds in a group of four, it was quite demandingSunset College had many dimensional zones, so the typical matriculation test was to kill a certain number of Mortal dimensional creatures, but a Demonized General was a Legendary dimensional creature.Although the students here were all elites, most of them were at the Mortal stage. Killing a Legendary dimensional creature through the combined forces of four students at the Mortal stage wasn\u2019t simple. Furthermore, Demonized Generals didn\u2019t appear alone. They would have plenty of Mortal stage Demonized Soldiers around them, increasing the difficulty.Most students probably were incapable of killing one in ninety seconds as a group of four.\u201cMiss Wang, we just matriculated and have learned nothing. Isn\u2019t it too demanding for us to kill a Demonized General?\u201d a student raised his doubts.\u201cDidn\u2019t I give you ten days to learn? As long as you are willing to put in the effort, ten days is sufficient. If you don\u2019t have the will, a hundred days would be useless. This is Sunset College. It doesn\u2019t have that much time for you to waste. Kill a Demonized General in ten days or study at another university. Your fates are in your hands. Alright, this will be the end of the administration matters before class starts. You can officially begin attending lessons. As for the classes you would like to attend, it\u2019s up to you to decide. The timetable has the various counselors\u2019 lesson timings. You can choose the subjects you would like to learn more about.\u201d Wang Fei handed out passes before she left, leaving the room filled with dumbfounded students.\u201cCollege life seems to be a little more interesting than I expected. Killing a Demonized General in ninety seconds in a group of four probably isn\u2019t easily accomplished, much less ordinary students,\u201d Li Xuan whispered to Zhou Wen.The other students either lamented or grumbled. Their test was the hardest among all the matriculation tests in previous years.\u201cWhat kind of dimensional creature is the Demonized General?\u201d Zhou Wen held the pass he had received and studied it. On it were the words: Tiger Cage Pass.Li Xuan said, \u201cTiger Cage Pass is a dimensional zone east of campus. In ancient times, it was called Sihui Pass. After it became a dimensional zone, large numbers of Demonized General and Demonized Soldiers appeared. Among dimensional creatures of the same level, Demonized Generals and Demonized Soldiers are middle to upper tier. Some Demonized Generals even reach the level of pinnacle Legendary. They are very difficult to deal with. Such a matriculation test is really difficult for newly matriculated students.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s visit Tiger Cage Pass then,\u201d Zhou Wen said with piqued interest.His other dungeons had reached a bottleneck. He was unable to reach the top of Fire God Platform and he couldn\u2019t break into Ant City There wasn\u2019t much to be discovered in Underground Buddha City, so it would be a good development to have a new dungeon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Let Me Game in Peacechapter 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cMs. Wang, you shouldn\u2019t have used the test meant for the special admissions students of the previous two years on ordinary students, right?\u201d Liu Zhengyan told Wang Fei inside the school office.\u201cThese imps are filled with arrogance; if they aren\u2019t taught a lesson, it might not be easy teaching them in the future. Mr. Liu, rest assured. I know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Wang Fei said with great confidence.Wang Fei naturally wouldn\u2019t expel her students. She had prepared a strategy for killing the Demonized General. As long as these students worked hard to look up information on it, they would discover the strategy she had specially written.By studying the strategy completely, it wasn\u2019t difficult to slay the Demonized General within ten days.The average student did research in school, but Zhou Wen was clearly an exception. Without doing any research, he and Li Xuan headed straight for the Tiger Cage Pass dimensional zone.Tiger Cage Pass was similarly underground. After receiving a temporary pass from the school, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were able to enter it.The pass had to be returned in ten days, so it wouldn\u2019t be easy for them to enter Tiger Cage Pass again after that time.It wasn\u2019t that the school wasn\u2019t willing to open Tiger Cage Pass to everyone, but it had too few resources available for all. Real life wasn\u2019t a game where dimensional creatures would keep respawning after being killed. One had to wait for new dimensional creatures to come out of the dimensional rift, and this process was much slower than in-game respawning.Therefore, dimensional zones like Tiger Cage Pass that were specially prepared for students were typically opened up to them for fixed periods of time to ensure that there would be sufficient dimensional creatures in it.Outside Tiger Cage Pass, Zhou Wen discovered the familiar palm symbol, but it was a symbol with a tiger-headed gate.Before entering, he used his mysterious phone to snap a picture of the palm symbol and indeed, he successfully downloaded the Tiger Cage Pass game dungeon.Since he was here, he entered with Li Xuan to take a look. Several students from the same class had come as well. They too were here to take a look at Tiger Cage Pass\u2019s situation.In the underground ancient battlefield, Demonized Soldiers were wandering in groups. They wore ragged clothes and had blood-red eyes. Their dark skin suffused a metallic luster.There were also different types of Demonized Soldiers. Most of them carried lances while others held knives and shields. A few of them had bows and arrows.Most of the students were geniuses of their various high schools, so dealing with the typical Demonized Soldier wasn\u2019t difficult. However, there were no signs of Demonized Generals anywhere in the vicinity.\u201cShall we head in and find a Demonized General so that we can complete the test today?\u201d Li Xuan asked with a smile.\u201cAnother day perhaps. It\u2019s best we head back and study the information regarding Tiger Cage Pass.\u201d Zhou Wen didn\u2019t wish to underestimate any dimensional zone. It was equivalent to dancing on the edge of a blade.Although he now had the capability of killing Legendaries, Legendary creatures were varied in their abilities. No one could guarantee that nothing would go wrong.\u201cYou\u2019re just too careful. Without strength, we can just be over and done with by storming in,\u201d Li Xuan said with a laugh.Zhou Wen ignored him and headed out. After returning to his dorm, he first launched the school\u2019s official page and looked up the information regarding Tiger Cage Pass.Wang Fei had deliberately stuck to the strategy, so Zhou Wen naturally found it at a glance. When he loaded it, there was a detailed introduction to the strategy and how it could be used. As long as one cooperated well with one another, killing a Legendary Demonized General wasn\u2019t difficult.However, it had pointed out something\u2014the Demonized Generals mentioned in the strategy were typical Demonized Generals. If one were to encounter a Demonized General with engraving on their helmets, one was to immediately stay away from them.After studying the information available, Zhou Wen launched the game dungeon and entered Tiger Cage Pass.The game\u2019s graphics were nearly identical to Tiger Cage Pass, other than the fact that it was cartoonish. It didn\u2019t look as bloody and terrifyingWith Zhou Wen\u2019s strength, killing ordinary Demonized Soldiers was easy. Even small groups of them didn\u2019t pose any threat. He stormed his way and headed in the direction of Tiger Cage Pass\u2019s gate.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant slew the ordinary Demonized Soldiers as if it was dicing vegetables. This went on for kilometers until he suddenly saw a Demonized General rushing over on a Demon Horse.The Demon Horse was entirely red in color. It looked like a cloud of flames and its speed was astonishing. It arrived in front of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant almost in the blink of an eye.The Demonized General on the horse was abnormally stocky. It wore black armor and a helmet, and the weapon in its hand looked extremely odd. It looked like a spear, but the two sides of the spear tip had two crescent blades. It was more than three meters long and looked a little like the trident of the mythical Poseidon.The raven-black spear suffused a red glow and although it was drawn in a cartoon style, it still gave one the feeling of ferocity and dominance.Zhou Wen\u2019s gaze swept across its helmet and saw a circular groove. Engraved in it was the word \u201cPaper.\u201dBoom! The Demonized General raised its spear and thrust it at the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. Burning flames spewed out of the spear tip, making the strange spear appear like a flaming wyrm that swept towards the ant at blistering speed. Clearly, it was a Primordial Energy Skill.Under Zhou Wen\u2019s control, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant used Silver Wing Flash to dodge the Demonized General\u2019s thrust. At the same time, it moved its stinger and shot out Magical Needle, aiming right at the Demonized General\u2019s eyes.\u201cRoar!\u201d The Demonized General let out a roar as its body produced fiery ripples that resembled lotus flower petals. It had surprisingly withstood Magical Needle as it threw the strange burning spear right at the Silver-Winged Flying Ant in midair.Zhou Wen hurriedly made the Silver-Winged Flying Ant fly higher, hoping to use the distance of height to prevent the attack fromhitting.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant flew to a height of more than ten meters, a height that Zhou Wen imagined the strange spear wouldn\u2019t be able to reach.But to his surprise, the Demon Horse, the Demonized General was riding, leaped up and jumped more than ten meters into the sky, instantly closing the distance between it and the ant. The strange spear in the Demonized General\u2019s hand again swept at it like a fiery wyrm.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant lived up to its name as King of Low Altitudes. As it flapped its four wings, it dodged the attack like a silver bolt of lightning. However, a shocking scene happened the next second.The Demonized General aimed one hand at the Silver-Winged Flying Ant in midair and sucked at it. As though space was collapsing towards its palm, the Ant which was at least two meters away was pulled towards the Demonized General. No matter how hard it flapped its four wings, it was unable to escape the suction.Crack!The strange spear cleaved down, immediately lopping off the motionless Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s head. Zhou Wen turned around and retreated, but the blood-colored avatar did not have enough strength to fend off a pinnacle Legendary creature.Zhou Wen had ultimately retreated too late. Without even pursuing him, the Demonized General sat on the Demon Horse\u2019s back and threw the strange spear over.The flaming wyrm tore through the sky and without being able to dodge in time, the blood-colored avatar was pinned to the sandy ground in the battlefield. The screen went black.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhou Wen didn\u2019t feel depressed. Instead, his eyes lit up as he felt pumped with excitement.The stats of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant were already considered top-notch among Legendaries. Yet, it had been butchered by the Demonized General. Such a powerful existence made Zhou Wen eager to obtain it.Be it the Demonized General Companion Beast or the Demonized General\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill, they were both of extreme value. It was especially so for the skill that could pull the Silver-Winged Flying Ant over. It was practically godlike.Without any hesitation, he dripped his blood to revive the blood-colored avatar. He then chose to head for Tiger Cage Pass immediately.The typical Demonized Soldiers held little meaning to him. He stormed all the way in, leaving a wake of destruction behind him. Soon, he encountered the Demonized General who came riding on a horse.However, this Demonized General was somewhat different from the one he had previously encountered. Although it wore the same black armor and helmet, there wasn\u2019t any engraving on its helmet. Furthermore, it was riding a black horse and it was slightly shorter. The weapon it wielded was an ordinary spear.Upon exchanging blows, Zhou Wen realized that this was the ordinary Demonized General as described in the school\u2019s strategy. It was completely different from the word-engraved Demonized General he had seen.Although an ordinary Demonized General was rather strong, it wasn\u2019t the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s match. After about ten minutes of battle, it was slain and had dropped a Primordial Energy Crystal.A 15-valued Primordial Energy Crystal didn\u2019t help Zhou Wen break through his limits. Apart from his Constitution at 11, his other stats peaked at 10. He was unable to exceed the limit.Zhou Wen continued controlling the blood-colored avatar as he stormed towards Tiger Cage Pass. The nearer he was to it, the more Demonized Soldiers there were. He did encounter two Demonized Generals, but they dropped nothing of note.When the city gates of Tiger Cage Pass were in sight, Zhou Wen wanted to continue charging forward when he heard the twang of a bowstring. An arrow shot out from Tiger Cage Pass like a bolt of lightning, instantly killing the blood-colored avatar.What the hell? Zhou Wen was able to hear the bowstring\u2019s twang thanks to the Truth Listener earring, but he hadn\u2019t managed to see who had shot the arrow, nor was he able to dodge it in time.Such an outcome clearly didn\u2019t satisfy him. He dripped his blood and entered the game again, but this time, he didn\u2019t enter Tiger Cage Pass but first entered Ant Nest, Ancient Imperial City, and Underground Buddha City. After killing the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, Skeleton General, and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus once, he headed for Tiger Cage Pass.He failed to encounter a word-engraved Demonized General again and only encountered two ordinary ones. After killing them, he was killed on the spot by the arrow as he tried to approach Tiger Cage Pass. He still failed to identify who had killed the blood-colored avatar.Without immediately entering the game, Zhou Wen headed online to check the school\u2019s online database and studied in detail the information regarding Tiger Cage Pass.There was plenty of information, but little regarding the word-engraved Demonized General. It was only mentioned that they were occasionally encountered outside Tiger Cage Pass and were very rare, with one not even appearing for a month or two.Furthermore, there were many bigwigs who had their sights on word-engraved Demonized Generals. It was said that their Primordial Energy Skills were very valuable, but Zhou Wen didn\u2019t manage to find any information regarding that.As for what was inside Tiger Cage Pass, an Epic stage expert had once rushed in but ended up escaping with grievous injuries. To date, humanity hadn\u2019t yet cleared the Tiger Cage Pass dimensional zone.The area twenty-five hundred meters outside Tiger Cage Pass was considered a forbidden area. Typical students and teachers were forbidden from entry and they had only themselves to blame if an accident were to occur there.Without finding the word-engraved Demonized Generals\u2019 detailed information, Zhou Wen tried again. He dripped his blood again to revive himself in the bid of encountering one outside Tiger Cage Pass.However, before heading to Tiger Cage Pass each time, he would kill the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, Skeleton General, and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus. A Legendary Companion Egg did drop and ordinary Companion Eggs dropped as well. They were all given as food to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and Truth Listener.Truth Listener also needed food, but it was picky. It only ate Companion Eggs and had no interest in incubated Companion Beasts. This made it different from the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.Ding!For the next few days, Zhou Wen continued grinding crazily. After he slew a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus once more, a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Crystal dropped-a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal.This was even rarer than a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg. He had already had three of them drop, but the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill Crystal only had one drop.I already have Blood Meditation. I hope it isn\u2019t the same one this time. Zhou Wen carefully looked at the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal\u2019sstats.Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus: Lotus Flower Buddha Body (Rank 9)Zhou Wen\u2019s eyes lit up as he didn\u2019t hesitate to let the blood-colored avatar fuse with it.Lotus Flower Buddha Body was the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s protective Primordial Energy Skill and furthermore, it was Rank 9. Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t ask for more.Thankfully, the Buddha-type Primordial Energy Skill was relatively mild. Although it was at the Legendary stage, it didn\u2019t excessively burden Zhou Wen\u2019s body. It allowed him to successfully obtain the Rank 9 Lotus Flower Buddha Body.When Zhou Wen attempted to circulate it, faint blood patterns immediately suffused his skin. They covered his entire body with flower petals as though a Buddha\u2019s aspect was hidden within.Lotus Flower Buddha Body expended one Primordial Energy point every second, therefore, only allowing him to use it for ten seconds. This was under the condition that he didn\u2019t use any other Primordial Energy Skills.This Primordial Energy Skill is good in every way, but its expenditure is just too high, Zhou Wen thought with an insatiable desire.He entered the game to try his newly mastered skill and realized that he had basically achieved invulnerability against the attacks of Demonized Soldiers at the same Mortal stage. His defensive strength was indeed pretty good.It could also defend the attacks of ordinary Demonized Generals if they didn\u2019t use Primordial Energy Skills. If they were to use one, the Lotus Flower Buddha Body wasn\u2019t able to defend against it, but it still prevented him from being killed instantly.Of course, this was under the condition that the ordinary Demonized Generals could hit the blood-colored avatar. In fact, with the silver wings formed by the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, ordinary Demonized Generals were incapable of touching the blood-colored avatar.As for the arrow that shot out from Tiger Cage Pass, it was still able to penetrate his body. Lotus Flower Buddha Body\u2019s defensive powers were like paper mache that didn\u2019t show any obvious effects. Even Silver Wing Flash didn\u2019t help him in dodging it.The one shooting the arrow from Tiger Cage Pass is likely an Epic dimensional creature. Zhou Wen no longer dared to approach Tiger Cage Pass and only sought Demonized Generals in the periphery.He grinded Tiger Cage Pass countless times, and one time, he encountered a red horse dash towards him shortly after he arrived near Tiger Cage Pass. The Demonized General riding on it was stocky and tall. Its strange spear, resembling Poseidon\u2019s trident, was eye-catching. There was a word engraved on its helmet, making it the word-engraved Demonized General which Zhou Wen had been trying hard to find.However, upon careful inspection, he was stunned. This was because the word engraved was different from the one he had previously seen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Let Me Game in Peacechapter 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe last time Zhou Wen saw the Demonized General, it had the word Paper engraved on the helmet. This time, it wasn\u2019t Paper but Blade.It was Paper and now it\u2019s Blade. Don\u2019t tell me the next one is Rock? Although he didn\u2019t know why they differed, he still followed his plans. He fused the Mutated Skeleton Ant, Silver-Winged Flying Ant, and Truth Listener into the blood-colored avatar and prepared for a full-power skirmish.Although the Demonized General was strong, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant wasn\u2019t weak, especially when it came to Speed. It was definitely not weaker than any Legendary dimensional creature.The Demonized General\u2019s attack was identical to the one he previously encountered. The strange spear in its hand swept over with blazing flames, but Zhou Wen managed to dodge it by flyingHe didn\u2019t rejoice when he dodged the strange spear\u2019s attack. He continued staring intently at the Demonized General\u2019s left hand.Indeed, after the spear missed, the Demonized General raised its left hand just as Zhou Wen had expected.However, to his surprise, the Demonized General didn\u2019t suck the blood-colored avatar over. Instead, it transformed its palm into a blade and waved it at it.The faint red blade aura tore out like a thin thread, instantly cleaving the blood-colored avatar\u2019s waist, an attack that even the silver wings were unable to dodge.The blade aura flashed past the blood-colored avatar\u2019s waist, slicing it into two. It then plummeted from the sky and the screen turned blackZhou Wen was confused when he saw the black screen. The left-hand technique of Paper is suction, while Blade has a blade aura that\u2019s as fast as lightning. If there\u2019s Rock, would it be a powerful punch that strikes from afar?He didn\u2019t immediately revive the blood-colored avatar to try again. He carefully considered the battle and quickly realized that he was unlikely to defeat the Paper Demonized General with only the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. However, he had a chance of defeating the Blade Demonized General.The suction force of the Paper Demonized General\u2019s palm was something the Silver-Winged Flying Ant couldn\u2019t avoid. However, the extremely fast Blade aura of the Blade Demonized General could be avoided if Silver-Winged Flying Ant was used properly. This also meant that Zhou Wen had the chance of killing a Blade Demonized General.This was if the Silver-Winged Flying Ant fought alone. If it fused with the blood-colored avatar as a companion form, there was zero chance.This was because, in its companion form, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was unable to use its talent skills. And since Zhou Wen hadn\u2019t had the Silver-Winged Flying Ant Primordial Energy Skill drop, he wasn\u2019t able to use such flight-capable skills. Therefore, he ended up losing his advantage after fusion.Heavens, show your grace on me. Let me encounter a Blade Demonized General again. Zhou Wen entered the dungeon once more, but luck was clearly not on his side. After repeatedly grinding, he didn\u2019t encounter any word-engraved Demonized General outside Tiger Cage Pass.He spent several days in his dorm grinding without attending class. Li Xuan visited him a few times, hoping to invite him to complete the test at Tiger Cage Pass, but Zhou Wen would decline with some excuse.Wang Fei constantly monitored her students in secret and discovered that most students had diligently done their research and formed teams to attempt slaying the Demonized General at Tiger Cage Pass.Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were the only ones in class who didn\u2019t do a thing. Excluding their first visit to Tiger Cage Pass, there had been no sight of them again.n noI can ignore Li Xuan, but what\u2019s Zhou Wen doing? Why didn\u2019t he head to Tiger Cage Pass to complete the mission? Wang Fei was rather curious about Zhou Wen.She had a good relationship with Ouyang Lan and knew how proud and doting she was as a mother. Even a woman like Ouyang Lan had given Zhou Wen an extremely high appraisal and had even given the rights that should have been An Jing\u2019s to Zhou Wen. This had piqued Wang Fei\u2019s curiosity.Zhou Wen had showcased impressive potential back in his participation in the slaying of the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus, so this deepened her curiosity.She wouldn\u2019t have thought much about it if Zhou Wen had completed the mission at Tiger Cage Pass without any fuss, but there was nothing from him for several days. This just intrigued her even more.Wang Fei clearly wasn\u2019t a patient person. Since she was curious, she decided to visit Zhou Wen at his dorm to see what he was doing.And in a room in a particular part of Luoyang City, Liz excitedly came to Qiao Siyuan with an arrest warrant. \u201cMinister Qiao, the arrest warrant has been granted. Shall we take immediate action?\u201dQiao Siyuan nodded slightly. \u201cTake some men to Sunset College. However, don\u2019t use the arrest warrant. Get the school to bring Zhou Wen over under the guise of getting him to aid in investigations. If he\u2019s cooperative, bring him back. If not, you\u2019ll have to use the warrant. Try not to garner the notice of too many people when you do it, especially the An family.\u201d\u201cMinister, rest assured. I know what needs to be done. I\u2019ll definitely bring Zhou Wen back,\u201d Liz said confidently.\u201cGo then. Come back quickly. We don\u2019t have much time. We have to get what we need to know before the An family sends someone, so it has to be fast,\u201d Qiao Siyuan exhorted once more.Liz obeyed the order and took men to Sunset College. Then, in the name of needing Zhou Wen to aid in investigations, she met the school\u2019s managing vice-chancellor.If they were ordinary police, they probably wouldn\u2019t be able to meet the managing vice-chancellor. However, being in the Special Inspector Bureau allowed Liz a meeting.In the League, the Special Inspector Bureau was feared and hated by everyone. Although the vice-chancellor didn\u2019t wish to involve himself with Liz and company, he had no choice but to talk to them.The entire League knew of many high-ranking officials that had their reputations ruined after entering the Special Inspector Bureau. If one was targeted by this bureau, severe loss or even death was certain.\u201cChancellor, rest assured. We just wish to invite a few witnesses to provide us with some information. It won\u2019t take too much of these students\u2019 time,\u201d Liz said with a smile.There was a name list on the managing vice-chancellor\u2019s desk, one with a total of six names. They were all Sunset College students, but five of them were just a ruse. Zhou Wen was the person she really wanted.\u201cAlright then.\u201d The managing vice-chancellor didn\u2019t wish to offend the Special Inspector Bureau because of such trivialities, so he got his secretary to summon the students on the list.Zhou Wen was gaming in his dorm when he received the notice to head to the school\u2019s administrative building. He had no idea why the chancellor was summoning him.Knocking on the door and entering the office, he instantly saw Liz who was sitting there drinking tea. He immediately knew that things weren\u2019t good, but he knew that escape was futile. All he could do was pretend to not recognize her and walk in calmly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just answer truthfully,\u201d the vice-chancellor said to Zhou Wen and company.Liz didn\u2019t look like she was targeting Zhou Wen. She asked all six students some questions and treated him the same as though she didn\u2019t know him.\u201cOfficer, will that do?\u201d the vice-chancellor asked after Liz was done with her questioning.\u201cThe other students can head back now. However, I would like to invite Mr. Zhou Wen back to assist us in our investigations.\u201d Liz waved her hand, permitting the other students to leave the office as she scrutinized him as though speaking casually.The vice-chancellor frowned slightly but soon smiled. \u201cOfficer, you naturally can get our students to assist in your investigations, but as you know, Sunset College is considered half a military school. These students can be considered part of the military reserve force. If you wish to take him away, you will need to go through the procedures. If you are in a rush for time, I can do the paperwork for you now.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need. This is an arrest warrant. Take a look at it. I\u2019ll only be taking him with me to assist in our investigations. We will bring him back unharmed, so you don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d Liz said with a sneer as she took out the arrest warrant, placing it on the desk in front of the vice-chancellor.How could she not be aware that the vice-chancellor was a sly old fox? Despite speaking pleasantly, he was probably planning to head out to inform the An family. Sunset College has been set up by the An family to begin with, so if anything were to happen, they wouldn\u2019t sit idle even if they didn\u2019t like Zhou Wen.The vice-chancellor looked at the arrest warrant carefully and immediately, his expression changed. He glared at Liz and asked, \u201cWhat law did our student break? To actually use an arrest warrant of this level?\u201dHe could already tell that Liz was here for Zhou Wen. Whatever excuses previously used had been solely to get Zhou Wen here.\u201cNo comment,\u201d Liz said as she gestured for her man to apprehend Zhou Wen.She knew that she couldn\u2019t waste any time. She needed to take Zhou Wen away before the Ans came.Zhou Wen was the An family\u2019s only candidate, one that couldn\u2019t be changed. Ignoring his importance to the An family, to request they hand him over without any concrete evidence was something they would definitely disagree with.Interrogation of Zhou Wen under the An family\u2019s supervision was nearly useless. It was basically telling Zhou Wen that they couldn\u2019t do a thing to him, so how could they get anything out of him?Furthermore, Qiao Siyuan also suspected that the An family was involved in this matter. This was also one of the reasons he needed to take Zhou Wen back for interrogation.As for killing Zhou Wen, not only was Liz fearful of doing so, but even Qiao Siyuan wouldn\u2019t do so. The An family had Zhou Wen as their only candidate, so killing him was equivalent to crossing them. Qiao Siyuan didn\u2019t wish to completely offend them; at least he wouldn\u2019t do so until he had concrete evidence.Of course, if he could obtain actual evidence from Zhou Wen that the An family was involved with Jing Daoxian, that would be a whole different matter.The possibility was very small to begin with; therefore, Liz didn\u2019t really have much hope of obtaining such evidence. She only wanted to take Zhou Wen back and question him about the things that Qiao Siyuan wanted to know before the An family arrived.Zhou Wen immediately hid behind the vice-chancellor\u2019s back. He had heard Li Xuan describe the modus operandi of the Special Inspection Bureau-a place that was enough to figuratively skin a person no matter who they were. For them to have spent so much effort to come all the way to Sunset College to arrest him, he clearly wasn\u2019t going to be released after a simple interrogation.Furthermore, Zhou Wen felt guilty. After all, he had cultivated Jing Daoxian\u2019s Lost Immortal Sutra. If the bureau were to believe that this Primordial Energy Art was related to Jing Daoxian, wouldn\u2019t that make him his accomplice?Zhou Wen didn\u2019t know that Jing Daoxian hadn\u2019t cultivated in the Lost Immortal Sutra himself because it wasn\u2019t his. Even if others were to recognize the Lost Immortal Sutra, it was impossible to connect him to Jing Daoxian.Furthermore, no one in the League had ever mastered the Lost Immortal Sutra, so it was almost impossible to recognize.\u201cOfficer, you should know that Overseer An shows great concern about Sunset College. Shouldn\u2019t you inform him of this?\u201d the vice-chancellor said with a frown.Liz said in all seriousness, \u201cThe League\u2019s laws are supreme. I don\u2019t care where this is or who\u2019s here. I\u2019m duty-bound to do what needs to be done. It doesn\u2019t matter who comes. Chancellor, are you implying that Overseer An is greater than the League\u2019s laws?\u201d\u201cYou are taking me out of context. On this matter, our Sunset College will definitely seek an explanation from Congress.\u201d The vice-chancellor\u2019s face was livid.\u201cFeel free to do so.\u201d Liz knew that she couldn\u2019t waste any more time. She had to leave immediately with Zhou Wen, so she gave her men the signal.Two men moved like phantoms as they tried to take Zhou Wen away by force.\u201cDon\u2019t touch me. I can walk by myself.\u201d Zhou Wen knew that the school was powerless against them since the vice-chancellor didn\u2019t stop them.\u201cAlright, move along.\u201d Liz wasn\u2019t afraid that Zhou Wen could do much. She waved her hand, giving the silent order to her subordinates not to touch him and let Zhou Wen walk by himself.She didn\u2019t wish to blow matters up if things could be done in a furtive manner.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t resist as he obediently walked out. The two men walked behind him, prepared to immediately restrain him if he did anything abnormal.\u201cChancellor Ya, goodbye for now,\u201d Liz said and directly walked off.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t dawdle as he directly walked towards the school\u2019s entrance.He was lacking in EQ, but it didn\u2019t mean he was dumb.Liz had tricked him and was now eagerly taking him away. Although she spoke in an overbearing manner, he could tell that there were things holding them back. Their eagerness was apparently because they were afraid of something.Every second I stall counts. Zhou Wen didn\u2019t have the opportunity to send an SOS message. From the moment he entered the room and saw Liz, he knew that he wasn\u2019t able to do so under Liz\u2019s nose. Therefore, he hadn\u2019t made any attempts to prevent himself from being taken into custody immediately. It might even cause his mysterious phone to be confiscated.However, believing that the vice-chancellor would have already sent out the news, all he needed to do was stall for time to have a turnaround.Under normal circumstances, it was clearly impossible for someone at the Mortal stage to escape from a few Legendary officers.Zhou Wen kept walking towards the school\u2019s entrance without acting out of place. Nor did he take any detours. He made Liz and the officers believe that he had stopped resisting and was returning with them.In fact, even high officials of the League wouldn\u2019t try anything funny if they were under the bureau\u2019s control, much less a student.Zhou Wen walked normally as though he had resigned himself to fate. But when he arrived near a forest within the campus grounds, he suddenly exerted full force and dashed into the woods. As he ran, he said, \u201cI need to pee. Wait a moment.\u201dBy passing through the forest, he was already close to the entrance of Underground Buddha City in the real world. As long as he could escape into it, he could use the Small Buddha Temple\u2019s mysterious forces to stall for time.Although doing so was risky as he still didn\u2019t know if Small Buddha Temple in the real world was identical to the game, he no longer had the luxury of choice. He had things on him he absolutely couldn\u2019t expose.If he were to be taken away for interrogation, all the items on him would be scrutinized\u2014the mysterious phone would thus be exposed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If a student at the Mortal stage were to escape under their noses, they could forget about staying in the bureau.Without needing Liz to give the word, the two officers behind Zhou Wen reached out their hands to grab him. Speed at the Legendary stage emerged as four hands seemed to lock onto Zhou Wen\u2019s arms like phantoms.But in that split second, a silver glow flashed behind Zhou Wen. Four silver wings extended and with one flap, he flew seven to eight meters high. He was incredibly fast and unexpectedly dodged the officers\u2019 attacks, successfully rushing into the forest.\u201cA Legendary Companion Beast capable of flight\u2026 Chase after him\u2026\u201d Liz was slightly taken aback, but she immediately led the chase after snapping back to her senses.They originally imagined that it would be impossible for Zhou Wen to escape from the Legendaries even with his Legendary Companion Beast, but to their surprise, Zhou Wen was like a nimble bat. He flapped his four wings and darted through the woods, using the trees to conceal his motion. He cut off their attempts to encircle him as he rushed out of the woods.\u201cI want to see how far you can go!\u201d Liz was alarmed and infuriated. She chased Zhou Wen at an unimaginably fast speed.Without the woods concealing his actions, Zhou Wen was unable to pull open the distance between them. All he could do was rush towards Ancient Inlet, that wasn\u2019t too far away, at full speed, rushing into Underground Buddha City before Liz and company could catch up to him.Zhou Wen showed his pass and directly entered Underground Buddha City. However, Liz and company were stopped by the soldiers who were guarding it. After they revealed their identification as bureau officers, they were permitted into Underground Buddha City to continue the pursuit.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t even turn his head as he ran towards Small Buddha Temple at full speed. Liz and company chased him relentlessly and were closing up to him despite the Speed he obtained with the wings obtained from the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.\u201cZhou Wen, do you know what crime it is to resist arrest? We originally only required you to return to assist us with our investigations. Now that you\u2019re escaping, that will compound the crime. It\u2019s still not too late for you to stop now,\u201d Liz shouted as she chased.Zhou Wen completely ignored her as he dashed forward at full speed.Liz knew that she couldn\u2019t waste any more time when she saw Zhou Wen running in silence. Gritting her teeth, she summoned an azure sword and slashed it towards Zhou Wen.An azure sword beam appeared immediately, traversing several meters as it headed straight for Zhou Wen\u2019s back.Zhou Wen heard the sound of wind as he hurriedly dodged with a sidestep, barely dodging the sword beam\u2019s slash. Without another word, he continued running forward.He originally only had the thought of finding an opportunity to hide the mysterious phone, but with Liz\u2019s tight pursuit, they weren\u2019t giving him a chance to do so. All he could do was desperately escape in the direction of Small Buddha Temple.\u201cMy name isn\u2019t Liz if you escape me today!\u201d Liz was infuriated and couldn\u2019t care less. She slashed out with her sword repeatedly.Although the sword beams weren\u2019t aimed at Zhou Wen\u2019s vital spots, it was enough to grievously injure him.Due to him dodging the sword beams, Zhou Wen\u2019s speed immediately dropped. This allowed the other officers to catch up to him. They didn\u2019t stand on ceremony as they cast several Primordial Energy Skills at him.They were experienced veterans and attacked viciously in a non-lethal manner. It was solely to heavily injure him so that he could be taken back.A huge burst of blood shot out of Zhou Wen\u2019s thigh as Liz\u2019s sword beam sliced across it. The blood continued gushing out of the laceration.Zhou Wen continued dashing forward in silence, but the injuries he suffered kept increasing. Although they weren\u2019t lethal, his wounds were extremely horrifying.Liz was also alarmed. Although Zhou Wen was augmented by a Legendary Companion Beast and he was flying very quickly, he was ultimately at the Mortal stage.Under their relentless attacks, he only suffered injuries without succumbing. Although he looked seriously injured, he had avoided having his vital parts injured. He hadn\u2019t suffered any serious damage.This definitely had to do with Liz and company having no intention of really killing Zhou Wen, but he had been able to avoid any injuries that were enough to put him out of combat.Many times, Zhou Wen was able to dodge an attack at the final moment even without taking a look. It was as though he had eyes in the back of his head. This shocked Liz greatly.This Zhou Wen is so calm in battle. Even when injured, he chooses to allow himself to be injured to minimize the overall damage. He\u2019s terrifyingly calm. It\u2019s unbelievable that he\u2019s only sixteen. Liz looked at the bloody Zhou Wen flying off with a resolute look in his eyes. Her heart stirred as she thought, It\u2019s no wonder the An family chose him. It\u2019s probably not just because of the relationship between Zhou Lingfeng and Ouyang Lan.Zhou Wen fought as he retreated. After his body was injured, his Lost Immortal Sutra automatically switched to Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. What further surprised him was that his wound pulled together to exert compression and prevent blood from gushing out just like Li Xuan.I never expected the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra to have such ingenious uses. Zhou Wen was quite surprised.The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra allowed Zhou Wen\u2019s Constitution to exceed 10\u2014the only stat that reached 11. Therefore, it definitely boosted Constitution, but he had no idea what it did.The Small Buddha Temple\u2019s stone staircase was already in sight. It had a metal fence barricading it with a forbidden zone sign to prevent students from accidentally venturing in.Small Buddha Temple didn\u2019t have troops guarding it because it was unnecessary. If someone was really able to enter Small Buddha Temple and master the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, the military would be very happy.There were all kinds of similar, mysterious places in the world, but less than 10% of them had been completely cleared.Zhou Wen rushed to the fence as his left arm conjured the skeleton bracer. He tore a huge hole through the fence and immediately crawled through it.Liz and company weren\u2019t from Luoyang, so they knew little about the recently discovered Buddha City. Although they saw the forbidden zone sign, they continued their pursuit.Firstly, Liz needed to capture Zhou Wen as soon as possible. Secondly, with Zhou Wen in front of them, he would end up bearing all the dangers first. Therefore, she didn\u2019t hesitate to rush in with her men.In the narrow rock passageway ahead, the space that allowed him to dodge decreased. Liz managed to slash a beam on Zhou Wen\u2019s back, causing him to trigger the Lotus Flower Buddha Body skill. However, a long bloody gash cleaved open on his back as he was thrown forward. He spat out blood when he slammed onto the stone steps high above.Liz approached Zhou Wen with a sword in hand as she said coldly, \u201cZhou Wen, you\u2019re cornered. Stop having illusions that you can escape. Returning with us to assist in the case will only benefit you,\u201dZhou Wen shot a look at Liz and company who had managed to catch up to him. Wiping away the blood that trickled from the corner of his mouth, he said indifferently, \u201cWhy would I be escaping? You are the ones who should be escaping.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She gestured with her hand for the officers to head over and apprehend the heavily injured Zhou Wen.She had already wasted too much time, far more than she had originally planned. It was already hard to tell if they could take Zhou Wen away before the An family came. She couldn\u2019t afford to waste any more time.The few officers lunged forward. By heading higher, the stone stairs had broadened. They were no longer as narrow as before, allowing them to rush up together.But this time, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t immediately run. He sat at the top of the stairs, striking forward at the officer that led the charge.This strike seemed soft and powerless as though he hadn\u2019t exerted a sliver of strength. The officer was nearly two meters away, so not even his sleeves were touched.Liz and the few officers naturally didn\u2019t believe that Zhou Wen had the ability to strike them from a distance. Skills that could project Primordial Energy was considered a minority even at the Legendary stage, so it was impossible for someone at the Mortal stage to master such a skill. Even if there was one, someone at the Mortal stage didn\u2019t have the Primordial Energy needed to support the expenditure.However, with Zhou Wen\u2019s gentle strike, the officer silently collapsed to the ground. It instantly shocked the rest.Zhou Wen remained unperturbed as he repeatedly struck the air. In response, the remaining officers collapsed in the zone as though their souls had been dissipated.Liz was stunned and bewildered, nearly unable to believe her own eyes. The few Legendary officers had clearly stopped breathing; yet, she couldn\u2019t tell how they had been killed by Zhou Wen. Her eyes flickered with a glint of shock and puzzlement. Momentarily, she didn\u2019t dare approach him.Yet Zhou Wen knew very well that they hadn\u2019t been killed by him. Instead, it was the mysterious force of the stone stairs and Small Buddha Temple that robbed them of their lives.However, no one knew this mysterious force better than Zhou Wen. He had accurately estimated the moment of the officers\u2019 death and just posed with a strike. It was simply to scare them off.What puzzled Zhou Wen was that Liz wasn\u2019t affected by the stone stairs\u2019 force; otherwise, she should have been lying dead.Strange, don\u2019t tell me Liz possesses a Primordial Energy Skill similar to Heart Meditation? That\u2019s why she hasn\u2019t been killed by that mysterious force? But that\u2019s not right. Even if she has something like that, she doesn\u2019t know the secret of this place. She wouldn\u2019t be using it ahead of time\u2026 What\u2019s happening?Zhou Wen was puzzled, but he didn\u2019t show it. He continued sitting on the stone stairs with a leisurely look, looking down at Liz with an air of superiority. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to kill, but why did you have to force me?\u201dHis words were half-truths. If Liz hadn\u2019t forced him, he definitely wouldn\u2019t wish them dead, much less make people from the bureau die.He didn\u2019t know if he could explain their deaths clearly in the future, with the possibility of the League putting him on a wanted list.But even so, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t wish to expose the secret of his mysterious phone.At most I\u2019ll be a fugitive, escaping into dimensional zones that aren\u2019t within human control. As long as I have the mysterious phone, the dangers of the dimensional zones are nonexistent to me. Zhou Wen made up his mind that if he were truly cornered, he would have to become a wanted fugitive.\u201cDon\u2019t try to act all mysterious. Do you think you can fool me?\u201d Liz didn\u2019t believe that a student like Zhou Wen at the Mortal stage could possess such terrifying power.However, she was unable to instantly tell how the four officers had died. This hesitance made her lack the courage to directly rush forward.\u201cYou can give it a try if you don\u2019t believe it. Let\u2019s see if my Formless Divine Palm is capable of killing you,\u201d Zhou Wen said with a deadpan expression as though he had everything in thebag.However, Zhou Wen was lamenting inwardly, I\u2019ve already stalled for so long. Even without Heart Meditation\u2019s protection, no matter how strong Liz is, she should have died on the stone stairs. Why is she completely fine?\u201cWhat Formless Divine Palm? I\u2019ve never heard of it.\u201d Liz kept staring at Zhou Wen and the four dead officers in an attempt to figure out the reason for their deaths.\u201cThe Formless Divine Palm is colorless and shadowless. It kills people in an invisible manner, a Primordial Energy Skill Ouyang Lan gave me. It was meant to protect me, and I usually wouldn\u2019t readily use it. If you hadn\u2019t cornered me today, I wouldn\u2019t have used such a vile Primordial Energy Skill.\u201d Zhou Wen spoke nonsense, but he was considering how he could escape.He didn\u2019t believe he could really scare Liz. She hadn\u2019t rushed up because she hadn\u2019t figured out how her four colleagues had died and was unwilling to take the risk.Liz was doubtful of Zhou Wen\u2019s words. It was true she couldn\u2019t tell how the deaths occurred because they didn\u2019t seem to have any injuries at all.Suddenly, an idea came to Liz. She recalled the forbidden zone sign she had seen and immediately came to a realization. She sized up her surroundings and sneered. \u201cThen, let me try and see how your Formless Divine Palm can kill me!\u201dAs she spoke, Liz summoned a Companion Beast.It had pure-white wings and supple skin and was dressed in a white gown. It resembled the mythical angel but had one thing that was different. This angel Companion Beast didn\u2019t have a head. It was empty from the neck up.\u201cHeadless Angel!\u201d Zhou Wen immediately cried out when he saw the headless angel.Headless Angel was very famous as a Companion Beast. Although it came from the League\u2019s West district, its name had already spread across Earth\u2019s League.Headless Angel wasn\u2019t a true angel, but a figure in western legend.Legend had it that a pious nun believed in God with the purest heart, hoping that she could one day ascend to heaven to serve God as an angel.Every person who saw the nun believed that she was the purest and most flawless person in the world. Therefore, everyone who knew her believed that she was bound to ascend to the heavenly kingdom after her death, becoming an angel who would serve God.Perhaps the nun\u2019s devotion moved God. One day, God descended before the nun and cast a divine light down on Earth, purifying the nun\u2019s body into that of an angel\u2019s.Just as the nun\u2019s body was being transformed into an angel\u2019s body, she saw a prisoner on death row piously praying and confessing to God.Hence, the nun asked God, \u201cThat prisoner is so pious. Can you absolve him of his sins?\u201dGod answered, \u201cI can, but his sins need to be burdened by someone. If you agree, you can replace the prisoner at the guillotine and bear his sins.\u201dAfter hearing that, the nun resolutely chose to bear the sins for the prisoner. Hence, with a flash of divine light, the prisoner at the guillotine was switched to the nun who was quickly transforming into an angel. Before her body could completely turn into an angel\u2019s, her head was chopped off.wasAlthough her head had been chopped off, the other parts of her body were already that of an angel. It was an unaging and immortal body that didn\u2019t die because of a beheading.However, the head wasn\u2019t able to recover due to it not being angelized. Therefore, the nun became the legendary Headless Angel in western legend.Although the name was terrifying, a Headless Angel was synonymous with purity in the West district.After the dimensional storms, inside one dimensional zone in the West district, a Headless Angel dimensional creature appeared. It was later slain by humanity and its Companion Egg obtained.As such, the Headless Angel at the Epic stage became famous across Earth\u2019s League. She wasn\u2019t the greatest at combat strength but she was great for protection.With the protection of a Headless Angel, all kinds of evil forces like curses and hexes were unable to harm her master. It was to date, the strongest defensive Companion Beast in the West.The master of Headless Angel relied on her defensive powers to explore dimensional zones amidst many mysterious dangers-ones that humanity believed were forbidden-returning safely every time.Hence, the fame of Headless Angel intensified. But based on what Zhou Wen knew, there was only one Headless Angel Companion Beast, and its owner wasn\u2019t Liz.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its body appeared like a holy halo that floated in front of Liz.Liz extended her hand and beckoned, causing the Headless Angel\u2019s body to quickly transform into a white crucifix that landed in Liz\u2019s palm.The crucifix suffused a holy glow that made Liz appear like a goddess with it in hand.Zhou Wen finally understood why Liz hadn\u2019t been killed by Small Buddha Temple\u2019s mysterious force. It was likely due to the Headless Angel\u2019s protection.He didn\u2019t hesitate to turn around and flap his wings to fly towards Small Buddha Temple.The wings the Silver-Winged Flying Ant manifested gave Zhou Wen Speed that was in no way inferior to a pinnacle Legendary. He instantly rushed to the entrance of Small Buddha Temple at the end of the stone stairs.Zhou Wen originally didn\u2019t wish to risk entering Small Buddha Temple in real life, but now wasn\u2019t the time to consider that. All he could do was enter to seek refuge.\u201cContinue running and I\u2019ll cut off your legs.\u201d Liz\u2019s voice was cold as she held the Headless Angel\u2019s crucifix. Like a panther, she chased after Zhou Wen with a sword in her hand. She then slashed it at Zhou Wen\u2019s thigh like it was a whip.Liz had previously held back due to her qualms with regards to the An family.However, the death of the four officers had triggered Liz\u2019s rage. All she wanted to do was take Zhou Wen back alive. She had zero other scruples.The strike was exceedingly fast as the sword beam instantly arrived behind Zhou Wen.Summoning the Silver-Winged Flying Ant with clenched teeth, he made it watch his back as he rushed into Small Buddha Temple.At the same moment Zhou Wen rushed into Small Buddha Temple, he heard a creaking sound behind him. When he looked back, he saw the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s two foreclaws cleaved apart by Liz. Even its forehead had a bloody gash that was seeping blood.Reality wasn\u2019t a game, so the Silver-Winged Flying Ant couldn\u2019t be revived if it died. With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned it back as he continued running into the temple hall at full speed.Without the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s wings to help him, his speed was much slower.The environment inside the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra was identical to the game. The first thing he saw when he entered the Small Buddha Temple\u2019s compound was the stone monument with the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra inscribed on it.In reality, the stone monument looked even more ancient and spartan as though it had suffered the ravages of time. The mottled exterior made it look even more rugged as if there was an indescribable charm to it.Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t be bothered with it. He circulated the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra as fast as he could before rushing into the temple hall.Liz followed closely behind as she slashed her sword at Zhou Wen\u2019s thigh again without any hesitation. It was as though she wanted to lop off both of his legs.Even without turning his head, Zhou Wen was able to know that the sword beam was already behind him, due to Truth Listener.He leaped without any hesitation towards the temple hall.In midair, he felt the bottom of his feet become chilly. His sports shoes were made of high-tech cloth and had their soles sliced off. Even some of the flesh on the sole of his feet wasn\u2019t spared. The bleeding of his soles was rather harrowing.However, Zhou Wen had finally rushed into the temple hall and landed on the stone panes.Buddha, please watch after me. Let the forces in this temple be effective against that woman; otherwise, that mad woman will definitely lop off my legs. As Zhou Wen retreated inside the temple, he prayed silently.Under the Headless Angel crucifix\u2019s protection, the forces of Small Buddha Temple seemed to lose all its original mystery, being completely useless against Liz.Liz held the crucifix in one hand and sword in the other, dashing straight inside the temple hall.However, at the instant one of her legs breached the temple hall\u2019s interior, the three-faced Buddha statue inside suddenly widened its eyes.Bang!The holy crucifix\u2019s glow instantly exploded like a red-hot metal piece being shattered by a sledgehammer. The glow of the crucifix seemed to splatter like liquid and instantly became dim. It even seemed incomplete.As though she had suffered a tremendous blow, her body flew backward and slammed into the stone monument, her mouth spewing out blood.Liz struggled on the ground and failed to get to her feet.Zhou Wen was delighted and surprised by this, almost to the point of giving the statue a thumbs up and expressing his deepest feelings: \u2018You\u2019re awesome.\u2019Without thinking further, he summoned the injured Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2014its front claws had been sliced off and its head injury was serious. Thankfully, it hadn\u2019t died.Zhou Wen instructed it to conjure Magical Needle and shot at Liz.At this stage, if he could retain everyone, Zhou Wen would still have the time to escape from Luoyang and into the unknown dimensional zones.However, if he allowed Liz to escape and gather more people for a second wave of attacks, he probably wouldn\u2019t have a chance of escapingLiz could hardly move due to her serious injuries, but she was able to summon a Companion Beast that resembled both a tiger and a lion. It picked her up and dodged the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s Magical Needle before rushing out of the temple.Zhou Wen immediately carried out his pursuit, but the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was too injured and unable to maintain its companion form. Hence, he wasn\u2019t able to catch up with her.When he rushed to the stone staircase, the Legendary Companion Beast had already run far away with Liz.Despite seeing that he couldn\u2019t catch up to her, he continued pursuing while giving Li Xuan a call, explaining the entire situation to him.He didn\u2019t hope that Li Xuan could help him resist the bureau; he only hoped to get some suggestions from him.Zhou Wen was still a student, so he had limited horizons. Furthermore, he knew little about the bureau and wasn\u2019t sure what was his best option.Liz was enraged as she endured her injuries, rode the Companion Beast out of Underground Buddha City and headed for the school\u2019s entrance.Zhou Wen resisting arrest was already a serious crime. She believed that she now had every right to mobilize the forces of the bureau to openly capture Zhou Wen without worrying about the An family.\u201cImmediately inform the Minister\u2026\u201d As Liz rushed out of the school gates, whilst trying to order the bureau officers outside the school to contact Qiao Siyuan, she suddenly stopped, stunned.She saw the officers who often appeared high and mighty standing silently by the roadside with their heads bowed. Beside them were a row of soldiers aiming their rifles at them.And on the road opposite them, there was a black sedan car. Beyond the rolled-down windows in the backseat, she saw a handsome man sitting there. He was looking straight at her.\u201cAn Tianzuo!\u201d Liz couldn\u2019t help but tremble when she saw the man.Back when she was in the vice-chancellor\u2019s office, she had claimed that she didn\u2019t care if he came and would continue carrying out whatever she needed to do. However, when she actually saw An Tianzuo, everything was different.This ridiculously young man had authority in the League that made even her uncles steal glances at him. Although she was about the same age as him, their level of accomplishment was on completely different levels.\u201cOverseer.\u201d Liz endured her pains and came off the back of her Companion Beast, bowed at An Tianzuo, and forced a smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I am under orders from Congress to arrest people related to Jing Daoxian\u2026\u201d Before Liz finished her sentence, she suddenly heard a bang.She felt an intense pain and burning feeling coming from her left thigh. While crying out loud, she couldn\u2019t help but fall to the ground on one knee as a bloody, gaping hole appeared on the side of her thigh. There were burn marks on her wound.Besides the sedan car, a man in military uniform and white gloves holstered his pistol and said, \u201cAnswer whatever the Overseer asks, and nothing that he doesn\u2019t ask.\u201d\u201cHow dare you fire at me? You\u2026\u201d Before Liz could finish her sentence, she heard another bang. A bullet had shot through her other leg, causing her to collapse to the ground with blood pooling around her.\u201cAs the adjutant to the Overseer, I am obligated to remind you once more that you only need to answer the Overseer\u2019s questions. If you say anything wrong or utter any unnecessary nonsense, the next thing to be crippled won\u2019t be your legs,\u201d the white-gloved man said gently with a smile.If it wasn\u2019t because he had crippled Liz\u2019s two legs, anyone would have mistaken him for a kind man who couldn\u2019t bear to kill even a mosquito.However, Liz\u2019s forehead was breaking out into a cold sweat. It wasn\u2019t just a result of the excruciating pain in her legs, but more a chill that came from deep down in her bones.Upon seeing the white-gloved man raise his gun again and aim it at her head, Liz snapped to her senses and, ignoring the pain in her legs, shouted, \u201cIt was Minister Qiao Siyuan who sent me.\u201dAt this moment, she had forgotten the status that she had always been proud of and her family\u2019s standing in the League. She only knew that if she didn\u2019t immediately answer the question, the seemingly harmless man would immediately blow her brains out.Liz didn\u2019t hesitate that the bullets within the gun had such might. Typical bullets could hardly injure her, but that didn\u2019t include bullets made of Primordial Gold.Very few materials could damage dimensional creatures on Earth, but Primordial Gold was one of them. And the An family controlled the biggest Primordial Gold mine in the League. The reserves it had covered more than 70% of the entire Earth League\u2019s reserves. Wealthy tycoons who could extravagantly use Primordial Gold in bullets weren\u2019t unheard of, but the An family was probably the only one to actually issue them to one\u2019s troops.\u201cCall Qiao Siyuan,\u201d An Tianzuo said mildly again, but it was a tone that didn\u2019t permit any doubt.The white-gloved adjutant handed a phone to Liz.Liz didn\u2019t hesitate and reached out to call Qiao Siyuan.Qiao Siyuan was feeling uneasy, having a nagging feeling that something was about to happen. Just as he was frowning in thought, he heard his phone ring.It was an unknown number. Seemingly realizing something, he picked up the call and said, \u201cI\u2019m Qiao Siyuan. Who\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m giving you five minutes. If I do not see you, all those who dared cross Sunset College will be executed by firing squad.\u201d A male voice with a magnetic charm sounded from the phone.\u201cH\u2026 Hello\u2026\u201d Qiao Siyuan broke out into a cold sweat. He wanted to say something, but the phone emitted a loud beep, an indication that the call had already been disconnected.What has Liz done? I clearly told her to be quick and bring Zhou Wen back before the An family arrived. Now, even An Tianzuo is there. Qiao Siyuan immediately felt his head ache, but he didn\u2019t hesitate. He didn\u2019t even put on the coat on his chair, he rushed straight out of the office, heading for Sunset College.He was long aware of An Tianzuo\u2019s style of doing things, but he never expected him to be so domineering to even dare execute a Senator\u2019s daughter.The League\u2019s Congress was split into the Senate and the House. They were all representatives of the various areas of the League and were voted in by the citizens of each jurisdiction.The Senate was different. There were perpetually six Senators, with only people from six families qualified to have a seat. They were the families of the Six League Heroes.The Senate had veto rights for any bills the House proposed. It could be said that the entire League\u2019s government was in fact controlled by these six families.Every League President was also selected from one of the six families.And the Special Investigation Bureau that Qiao Siyuan was from came directly under the Senate. Under the insistence of the Senate, agencies like the Special Investigation Bureau, which were hated by all, continued their existence in the League.Liz wasn\u2019t considered a smart woman, and her work ethic had never left Qiao Siyuan assured. However, as she was a daughter of a Senator, he had no choice but to keep her by his side.If Liz was really executed by An Tianzuo, Qiao Siyuan didn\u2019t dare imagine what the outcome would be. He didn\u2019t know if An Tianzuo would die as a result, but he knew that his death was a certainty. There was no question about it.Outside Sunset College, the nearby road had been sealed off by the soldiers. The students and passersby didn\u2019t know what was happening and could only circle around it.\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d An Tianzuo looked at the sky outside and asked casually.\u201c4:43,\u201d the adjutant looked at his watch and politely replied.An Tianzuo didn\u2019t say a word as he waved his hand. Immediately, a row of soldiers raised their rifles, aiming their black muzzles at the back of Liz\u2019s and other officers\u2019 heads.Liz was trembling. She had never felt this afraid before because she could tell that An Tianzuo really had no scruples about killing her.She really wished to say that she was a Senator\u2019s daughter and declare her identity, but she was afraid that the moment she spoke, the seemingly harmless and perpetually smiling adjutant would blow her brains out.\u201cOverseer, it\u2019s time,\u201d the adjutant turned and politely said to An Tianzuo after looking at his watch.\u201cThen, proceed with the execution,\u201d An Tianzuo said indifferently.\u201cOverseer Sir, please wait.\u201d A voice suddenly sounded from the sky as a figure flapped two wings and rushed down from the sky.The person who landed on the ground with his clothes soaked in sweat was none other than Qiao Siyuan. He had rushed over at such speed that he nearly had a heart attack. Thankfully, he had arrived just in time.Upon seeing Liz\u2019s crippled legs, Qiao Siyuan\u2019s heart was filled with agony.\u201cYou\u2019re Qiao Siyuan?\u201d Although An Tianzuo sat in the car, making his eye level much lower than Qiao Siyuan\u2019s, the way he looked at him was as though he was looking from high above.Qiao Siyuan walked to the car and said politely, \u201cI\u2019m Qiao Siyuan from the Special Investigation Bureau, Overseer Sir. Can we have a private chat?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just say it straight,\u201d An Tianzuo said indifferently, without looking at Qiao Siyuan.Qiao Siyuan\u2019s heart skipped a bit, aware that there was likely no way of conciliating the matter today.\u201cOverseer, Liz and the rest were just acting under orders from our people higher-up. This matter has nothing to do with them. Can they be sent to the hospital?\u201d Qiao Siyuan drew a deep breath and said.\u201cWho are the people higher-up,\u201d An Tianzuo continued asking with the same expression.\u201cOverseer, you should have heard of Jing Daoxian, right?\u201d\u201cThe League\u2019s vilest criminal.\u201dQiao Siyuan continued, \u201cJing Daoxian slaughtered many high-ranking members of the League at the League government office. It halved our League\u2019s strongest combat strength and set back our overall strength by ten years. The Senate has always placed the utmost importance on Jing Daoxian. Over the years, the League has been trying all means to pursue him. Our Special Investigation Bureau has also been putting in great efforts towards this cause. Just a few days ago, we discovered that Jing Daoxian had interacted with Zhou Wen.\u201d\u201cOh, so are you implying that Zhou Wen is in cahoots with Jing Daoxian?\u201d An Tianzuo shot Qiao Siyuan a look.Qiao Siyuan shook his head and said, \u201cWe are still unable to confirm if they are in cahoots; therefore, we wanted to invite Zhou Wen back to assist in our investigations. Overseer, you are of noble birth, but the responsibilities you bear are unimaginable to the typical person. It\u2019s not easy for you nor the An family. Why should you burden yourself with nagging tongues because of a huge problem like Jing Daoxian? Besides, didn\u2019t you once criticize Zhou Wen and say that there was a problem with him?\u201d\u201cSo are you saying I should thank you?\u201d An Tianzuo asked.\u201cNot at all. Overseer, I\u2019ll just be extremely grateful if you can understand where we are coming from.\u201d Qiao Siyuan felt more and more uneasy as he forced a smile.An Tianzuo looked at Qiao Siyuan with a faint smile. \u201cI did criticize Zhou Wen and I do find him a sore sight. But how I criticize or bully him is down to my whims, did I say that any Tom, Dick, and Harry could bully him?\u201dQiao Siyuan\u2019s expression instantly changed. He forced a smile and said, \u201cOverseer, you\u2019re absolutely right. We\u2019ll definitely change for the better. We will definitely inform you of any operations that involve the An family in the future.\u201d\u201cNot a bad attitude. Alright, I\u2019m not an unreasonable person. Since you have said this much, I\u2019ll spare their lives,\u201d An Tianzuo said.\u201cThank you, Overseer. I\u2019m truly grateful. Feel free to issue me orders if there\u2019s anything you need of me,\u201d Qiao Siyuan quickly said.\u201cThey can be spared from death, but not punishment. Otherwise, wouldn\u2019t any Tom, Dick, and Harry come to Luoyang to do as they please? Are the League\u2019s laws to be flouted?\u201d An Tianzuo spoke another sentence, one that was completely different from the previous one.Qiao Siyuan long knew that An Tianzuo wouldn\u2019t let this matter rest easily as he grumbled inwardly, You are the one who\u2019s best at flouting the League\u2019s laws.\u201cYou can take them back with you, but cripple them of their cultivation to prevent them from using it to run amok,\u201d An Tianzuo said casually.Liz was horrified when she heard that as she yelled crazily, \u201cNo\u2026 No\u2026 You can\u2019t cripple me of my cultivation\u2026\u201dQiao Siyuan\u2019s expression changed drastically as he said through gritted teeth, \u201cThey were just obeying orders and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Overseer, if you were to punish them, what does this make of the Senate? You should also know the League\u2019s present situation. The President and the Senators have spared no effort dealing with matters regarding Jing Daoxian. If you were to implicate yourself in this matter, wouldn\u2019t it give a great opportunity to those people who are watching you and eyeing the An family\u2019s Primordial Gold mine? Liz\u2019s father is Senator Cape. If you give Liz a chance, Senator Cape and the entire Cape family will be very grateful. In the future, he will definitely help the An family at congressional meetings. A thought separates heaven from hell. Overseer Sir, you must think about it carefully.\u201dAn Tianzuo looked at Qiao Siyuan in contempt and said, \u201cQiao Siyuan, do you know why my name is An Tianzuo?\u201d.\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. Please tell me, I\u2019m all ears.\u201d\u201cAs the saying goes Heaven[1] is on the right, and Hell is on the left. And I incline towards the left[2],\u201d An Tianzuo said indifferently.\u201cAh!\u201dLiz let out a painful cry as the adjutant drew an exquisite knife, stabbing into her Primordial Energy sea. Blood stained the hand holding the knife, turning the white gloves red.\u201cRemember, Luoyang belongs to the An family.\u201d An Tianzuo looked forward as his car windows wound up, slowly hiding his face.At this moment, Zhou Wen was hurriedly sneaking out of Sunset College via the back door. Li Xuan had given him two suggestions. One was to head to the An family to seek their help in settling this matter. The second suggestion was to immediately hide in unknown dimensional zones, never to appear again.Zhou Wen never wanted to have any relationship with the An family; therefore, he decided to flee into the dimensional zones. With the mysterious phone, unknown dimensional zones weren\u2019t too dangerous for him.He planned on escaping to the nearest, Dragon Gate Grotto. There were many dimensional zones in its vicinity that humans had yet to explore to date.However, just as he left Sunset College\u2019s back door, he saw a young, refined-looking military officer standing there in a military uniform and white gloves.\u201cYoung Master Wen, Madam has gotten Overseer to take you home for dinner.\u201d As the young officer smiled, he revealed two rows of neat, white teeth, emitting a warm, comforting glow like the sun in spring.When Zhou Wen sat inside the car, beside him was the person whose name he knew but had never met before-An Tianzuo.They had never met and had no ties in the past. But now, there was a particular relationship between them, making the mood rather delicate.\u201cYou must hate me, right?\u201d An Tianzuo suddenly asked.Zhou Wen never expected him to say this. However, he wasn\u2019t someone with a high EQ, so he replied, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it hate, but I definitely ain\u2019t fond of you.\u201d\u201cVery good. This is what I want to say to you. I have never believed that you have the qualifications to replace Little Jing. It has been that way in the past, the present, and will be so in the future,\u201d An Tianzuo\u2019s gaze was peeled to the front as he spoke without expression.\u201cYou are talking about An Jing? How did I replace her?\u201d Zhou Wen asked with a frown.An Tianzuo didn\u2019t reply but said indifferently, \u201cI really don\u2019t understand why my mom believes you are better than Little Jing. A man who only knows how to escape reality when encountering something doesn\u2019t have the right to be called a man, much less be better than Little Jing.\u201d\u201cI think you should visit a doctor and check if you have a screw loose in the head.\u201d Zhou Wen felt that An Tianzuo was definitely crazy as he spoke in a completely baffling manner.The adjutant, who was driving the car, couldn\u2019t help but twitch when he heard Zhou Wen.(1) Tian in An Tianzuo\u2019s name can be interpreted as heaven.[2] Zuo in An Tianzuo\u2019s name is a homophone to left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although An Tianzuo didn\u2019t like him, what had that got to do with him?Zhou Wen sat beside Ouyang Lan and focused on eating. He had a great time chatting with Ouyang Lan.An Tianzuo and An Jing sat opposite him and focused on eating as well as though they couldn\u2019t see him.After dinner, Zhou Wen planned on bidding them farewell and leaving when Ouyang Lan pulled Zhou Wen\u2019s hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be in a rush to leave. Have a walk with me.\u201dZhou Lingfeng got up and was about to accompany them when Ouyang Lan said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s rare for Tianzuo to return. Help me nag him to get married and have children so that he can carry on the family line. Also, teach him how to coax women. You are the best at that.\u201dZhou Lingfeng said with a bitter smile, \u201cCan you not sully my reputation when you\u2019re getting me to help?\u201d\u201cThis is me praising you,\u201d Ouyang Lan said with a giggle as she headed out while holding Zhou Wen\u2019s hand.The An family home was really big and beautiful. As they walked on the stone trail inside the garden, Ouyang Lan said, \u201cLittle Wen, there\u2019s something troublesome that I took the liberty of pushing the matter on you. Can you help me?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zhou Wen asked in surprise.Ouyang Lan sat on a bench by the side of the lawn and said in thought, \u201cWhen you were in school, you must have heard of the story of the Six League Heroes, right?\u201dHe nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s how humanity first slew a Mythical creature. It was also them who established the League government and ended the darkest and most chaotic period of humanity.\u201dOuyang Lan said with a smile, \u201cEstablishing the League government is real, but it\u2019s not necessarily true that darkness and chaos were ended.\u201dZhou Wen\u2019s knowledge of this was limited to his textbooks, so he waited silently for Ouyang Lan to continue.\u201cCurrently, the League appears to be stable and flourishing, but there are dark undercurrents surging. Something can happen anytime that develops into a cataclysm for human society,\u201d Ouyang Lan said with a sigh.\u201cIs the cataclysm related to dimensional creatures?\u201d Zhou Wen asked.\u201cThe dimensional zones restrict the region of activity of dimensional creatures, but no one knows how long such restrictions can last. However, this isn\u2019t the most pressing cataclysm at the moment.\u201dOuyang Lan paused before continuing, \u201cIn fact, the greatest cataclysm now is humanity itself. The Six League Heroes established the League and on the surface, it promotes democracy and freedom, but in fact, the ones in true power are the Senate and President. And the selection of these people comes from the families of the Six League Heroes. Therefore, the League is in fact no different from an autocracy.\u201cAnd an autocracy needs absolute central power. But in this era, to have absolute rule clearly isn\u2019t an easy task. At the very least, the families of the Six League Heroes do not have the absolute strength to control all of the Earth League. Even though they have been working hard for a number of years, it\u2019s noticeable from the outcome, that their control over the League is constantly weakening. Currently, the League is more of a fragmented nation with rival factions.\u201dUpon saying that, Ouyang Lan cast her gaze on Zhou Wen and asked with a smile, \u201cDo you know why the League remains stable and doesn\u2019t completely collapse despite reaching such a state?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.\u201cThat\u2019s because, in the League, only the families of the Six League Heroes have experts at the Mythical stage.\u201dZhou Wen was surprised. \u201cIsn\u2019t it said that no one in the League has broken through to the Mythical stage?\u201d\u201cIf one relied on themselves, it\u2019s true that no one has been able to break through to the Mythical stage, but there\u2019s a shortcut that allows humans to first obtain Mythical Companion Beasts and then by nurturing them, use their powers to advance to the Mythical stage. That\u2019s why Mythical experts are born amongst the families of the Six League Heroes,\u201d Ouyang Lan said.\u201cThen what\u2019s the shortcut?\u201d Zhou Wen asked curiously.\u201cYou were chased into Small Buddha Temple by the Inspection Bureau. You should have seen the stone monument and temple hall. Engraved on the stone monument was a Primordial Energy Art. If you can master it, you can enter the temple hall and directly receive the mysterious powers from the dimension; thus, obtaining a Mythical Companion Beast.\u201d\u201cReally? Then as long as Small Buddha Temple is controlled, wouldn\u2019t we be able to obtain a Mythical Companion Beast just like the families of the Six League Heroes?\u201d Zhou Wen said, feigning surprise.Ouyang Lan shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. To master the Primordial Energy Art on the stone monument, one needs a special physique. And people with such bodies are one in a billion. In a place like Small Buddha Temple, there are far more than one or two that have been discovered in the League. However, the number of people who can truly master the mysterious Primordial Energy Art is a pathetic number.\u201cThe six heroes all had special physiques. Furthermore, they found the mysterious lands that matched their bodies and mastered the mysterious Primordial Energy Arts, obtaining their Mythical Companion Beasts.\u201d After a pause, Ouyang Lan continued, \u201cHowever, the special physiques of their bodies weren\u2019t innate, but obtained from a mysterious dimensional zone. There are still mysterious creatures inside it that can make other humans obtain special physiques like the six heroes; thus, obtaining a chance to acquire a Mythical Companion Beast.\u201d\u201cWith such a place, the hero families probably do not wish to share it with others, right?\u201d Zhou Wen asked.Ouyang Lan curled her lips. \u201cIf they have the strength to suppress the entire League, they naturally won\u2019t share it with others. Unfortunately, even if they have Mythical experts, it\u2019s only limited to a few people. To suppress the massive Earth League is impossible. Besides, there are terrifying enemies overseas, beyond the League\u2019s jurisdiction. The hero families can\u2019t just put all their efforts on their own members.\u201d\u201cEnemies overseas?\u201d Zhou Wen was puzzled.\u201cThe Earth League only controls the land. Overseas, there are other human factions in existence. I\u2019ll tell you about them in detail in the future. To prevent the League from fracturing, the hero families have given the bigwigs of the various lands certain candidate spots, allowing the descendants of these bigwigs to have a chance of entering such mysterious lands. They will vie with the descendants of hero families for the chance to obtain special physiques. This temporarily stabilizes the League\u2019s peace on the surface. As for the An family, it possesses one such spot.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you gave me the spot?\u201d Zhou Wen suddenly realized something as he looked at Ouyang Lan in disbelief.She nodded and said, \u201cThat spot was meant for Little Jing, and with her talent and capabilities, she had a very high chance of obtaining a special physique. Unfortunately, she was born with an ailment. As her mother, I don\u2019t wish for her to take further risks. Therefore, I wish for you to replace Little Jing in this competition and obtain the special physique, thereby obtaining a Mythical Companion Beast.\u201cI will need to ask for your forgiveness for changing our nominee to you without obtaining your permission. Furthermore, it can\u2019t be changed again.\u201d Ouyang Lan patted Zhou Wen on the head and said with a smile, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel too pressured. I never planned on sending An Jing to begin with, so this spot would have been a waste. That\u2019s why I changed it to you. So don\u2019t worry if you aren\u2019t willing to go.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s useless sending him.\u201dZhou Wen didn\u2019t understand what Ouyang Lan meant. However, he had a general idea. Perhaps the obtaining of a special condition limited one\u2019s evolutionary level.\u201cWhy did you give me the nomination?\u201d Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t silly enough to believe that this nomination would be for nothing.Even if An Tianzuo and An Jing couldn\u2019t do it, the An family could use this nomination to exchange for immense benefits. Many famous and noble families would be very interested in this nomination spot.Taking ten thousand steps back, the An family could always give the spot to another collateral relative. It was a big family clan, so it would be easy for it to find someone suitable.Ouyang Lan looked at Zhou Wen and said, \u201cLittle Wen, whether you believe it or not, since I\u2019ve married Lingfeng, we should accept each other\u2019s children. I\u2019ll treat you as my own child. Of course, Tianzuo and Little Jing are my children, so my feelings for them go far deeper than yours. If all three of you were to encounter danger together, I\u2019d definitely prioritize saving them. But other than that, I\u2019ll do my best as a mother.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to do that.\u201d Zhou Wen was actually quite fond of Ouyang Lan\u2019s style.She said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel psychologically burdened. This is just a thought of mine that I won\u2019t force on you. If you wish, this family\u2019s door is forever open to you. If you aren\u2019t willing, I won\u2019t get others to disturb you. Everything is up to you to choose.\u201d\u201cDo you really believe that I can obtain the special physique?\u201d Zhou Wen still found it inexplicable why Ouyang Lan was so confident in him.Even someone as outstanding as An Jing wouldn\u2019t have absolute confidence, and with Zhou Wen not yet having advanced to the Legendary stage, he was far inferior to An Jing to others.Ouyang Lan smiled as she raised her phone and opened the Photos app. She opened up a photo that had a refined, bespectacled old man on it.\u201cDo you know him?\u201d Ouyang Lan pointed at the elderly man in the photo and asked.\u201cHe\u2019s the former principal\u2026\u201d Zhou Wen said in surprise. Back in Guide High School, he had been very taken care of by the former principal.As Zhou Wen spent most of his time living alone, he seldom returned home when he was in high school. He even spent the weekends arduously cultivating.Whilst doing this, he would often encounter the former principal. Over time, they built up quite a relationship. The former principal had even invited him over to his place for meals.Later, the former principal had to retire early due to his ailing physique. Back when he left, Zhou Wen had planned on sending him off, but the former principal refused. He claimed that he hated such scenes the most.Ever since then, Zhou Wen never met him-it had almost been a year.\u201cIt was he who told me that you\u2019re excellent, far better than Little Jing. Although I\u2019m not fully in agreement with that, you must be excellent since he says so,\u201d Ouyang Lan said with a smile.\u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with the former principal?\u201d Zhou Wen looked at Ouyang Lan and asked politely.\u201cHe\u2026\u201d Ouyang Lan blinked craftily before saying, \u201cis my father.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he looked at the photo and back at Ouyang Lan. They did share some resemblances.After Zhou Wen returned to the school\u2019s dormitory, he still found it incredible. The woman his father had married happened to be the former principal\u2019s daughter.Ouyang Lan told him not to worry further. The Special Inspection Bureau wouldn\u2019t find fault with him in the future under the premise that he didn\u2019t leave Luoyang.She also told Zhou Wen that he could attempt cultivating the Sun Strafe Art that An Jing gave him.The Sun Strafe Art also came from a mysterious land; however, it had been modified to a simplified version that could be cultivated even without special physiques. In fact, the famous Primordial Energy Arts, like the Invincible Connate Divine Art, all had similar origins.However, the simplified versions were inferior to the original versions. They lacked the capability of obtaining Mythical Companion Beasts.Although the simplified versions were a lot weaker than the original versions, they were still far stronger than the typical Primordial Energy Art. Ouyang Lan hoped that Zhou Wen could master the Sun Strafe Art to increase his chances when he vied for the special physique and Mythical Companion Beasts.Even if he wasn\u2019t concerned about these two factors, cultivating such a high-level Primordial Energy Art only brought benefits.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t make his decision on whether he would be vying for the special physique, but he did plan on taking a look at the Sun Strafe Art.It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t wish to cultivate the Sun Strafe Art, but since the Primordial Energy Art came from lands of mystery like the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, Zhou Wen wished to know if the Lost Immortal Sutra had any effect on these Primordial Energy Arts.Having had the USB drive in his possession for so long, this was the first time he was seriously reading the contents. The Sun Strafe Art was indeed a high-level Primordial Energy Art, far greater than Ascetic Meditation.After reading the entire Sun Strafe Art, nothing happened to the Lost Immortal Sutra in him. It wasn\u2019t like when he had read the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in which the Lost Immortal Sutra would automatically switch to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra\u2019s circulation method.Could it be that I need to see the original scriptures for it to be of use? Zhou Wen guessed inwardly.Zhou Wen put away the USB drive and was about to use his phone to grind the Tiger Cage Pass dungeon when Li Xuan came to him.\u201cThe An family has settled the problem for you. The Special Inspection Bureau won\u2019t dare come again. You can rest easy now. Isn\u2019t it about time we complete the test mission Counselor Wang gave us?\u201d Li Xuan said with a grin.\u201cAlright,\u201d after some thought, Zhou Wen agreed. After all, they didn\u2019t have much time left. It wasn\u2019t a bad idea to complete the test mission now.Although Wang Fei had said that they could kill the Demonized General in a team of four, Li Xuan and Zhou Wen had no intention of recruiting others. Just the two of them were good enough.Sunset College was so large that news of yesterday\u2019s ongoings on hadn\u2019t spread to the others. Those who knew Zhou Wen and what had happened were even fewer. Amongst those students, they didn\u2019t react differently when they saw Zhou Wen either.Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were walking towards Tiger Cage Pass when they suddenly heard a commotion up ahead. Then, they saw many students running back.A few of them were running and shouting, \u201cRun! There\u2019s a word-engraved Demonized General ahead. It\u2019s rushing over here.\u201dAs the strategy had specially mentioned that even Legendary stage experts were not necessarily able to defeat word-engraved Demonized Generals, none of the freshmen dared to take risks. All of them fled for the Tiger Cage Pass dimensional zone\u2019s exit.\u201cWe sure have bad luck. To think that a word-engraved Demonized General would appear. Let\u2019s head back now and wait until the school eliminates it before coming back.\u201d Although Li Xuan was arrogant, he knew where to draw the line.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Word-engraved Demonized Generals were extremely powerful, pinnacle existences among Legendaries. He was only confident of killing Blade Demonized Generals among the word-engraved Demonized Generals. If he were to encounter a Paper Demonized General, death was certain, so there was no need for him to take the risk.Just as the two were prepared to leave, they saw the stocky Demonized General riding over on a red horse with spear in hand. A few female students were too close to it and were about to be caught up by it.\u201cSis!\u201d Li Xuan took a careful look and immediately, the color in his face drained. He summoned the Jade-Eyed White Tiger and rushed over against the escaping crowd.Zhou Wen also saw Li Weiyang among the students being pursued by the Demonized General. However, he did not rush over immediately. He was too far away and couldn\u2019t see clearly what the engraved word on the head was.If it was Blade, he was confident that he could help Li Xuan rescue Li Weiyang. It was even possible to kill it in passing and he might obtain something good.However, if they had encountered a Paper Demonized General, Zhou Wen would only be sending himself to his death if he rushed over. It would be meaningless.Li Weiyang had the Legendary Companion Beasts, Black Knight and Jade-Eyed White Tiger. Even if they weren\u2019t a match for the Paper Demonized General, they were enough to rescue Li Weiyang by sacrificing them.\u201cIsn\u2019t Li Xuan your friend? Why aren\u2019t you going to help him?\u201d Zhou Wen was trying to make out the word engraved on the Demonized General\u2019s helmet when he heard a familiar voice.He turned around and saw An Jing standing beside him with a deadpan expression. She had walked over at some point in time.Her tone had a clear hint of mockery. He glanced at her before ignoring her. He turned his head back to scrutinize the Demonized General\u2019s helmet, trying hard to figure out what the word was.Although Zhou Wen was quite fond of Ouyang Lan, it did not mean that he had a favorable impression of everyone in the An family. At the very least, he didn\u2019t have a favorable impression of An Jing and An Tianzuo, so he didn\u2019t want to have any interaction with them.Zhou Wen wouldn\u2019t vent his anger on Ouyang Lan because of the An siblings, but he wouldn\u2019t extend his fondness to them just because of her.An Jing didn\u2019t say anything else. She also knew that it was unrealistic for a Mortal stage student to fight a word-engraved Demonized General. It wouldn\u2019t be a heroic act but a suicide.However, for some reason, An Jing just found Zhou Wen a sore sight. Even if he did the right thing, she just couldn\u2019t help but poke fun at him.Although she said that, An Jing\u2019s eyes were peeled at the Demonized General. She was prepared to summon her Companion Beast to engage it in combat.Firstly, it was because An Jing wouldn\u2019t allow her fellow students to be killed by the Demonized General and secondly, the probability of a word-engraved Demonized General\u2019s appearance was very low. Once it appeared, it became the target of the best students in school.The Companion Beast and Primordial Energy Skill that the word-engraved Demonized General dropped were extremely rare and very useful.The Companion Beast needed no explanation. It was a Legendary Companion Beast with exceptional strength and could even be of certain use in battles with Epic creatures. It was a top-grade Legendary Companion Beast that was extremely rare.The word-engraved Demonized General\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill was also very useful. The Paper Demonized General\u2019s Astral Suction Palm, the Blade Demonized General\u2019s Astral Slash Blade, and the Fist Demonized General\u2019s Astral Fist were all rare top-grade Primordial Energy Skills among Legendary ones.Astral Suction Palm could suck things across space. Astral Slash Blade had a blade beam that was as fast as lightning. Astral Fist\u2019s explosive might was unparalleled. All of them were Primordial Energy Skills that Legendary experts yearned for.Unfortunately, there were too few word-engraved Demonized Generals. The drop rate of Companion Beasts and Primordial Energy Skill crystals were just too low. It had been years since the discovery of the Tiger Cage Pass dimensional zone, but the number of people with word-engraved Demonized General Companion Beasts and Primordial Energy Skills was few in number.Inside Sunset College, if one could possess a word-engraved Demonized General Companion Beast, or possess a word-engraved Demonized General\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill, they would be envied by everyone.It was easy for An Jing to get Companion Beasts and Primordial Energy Skills, but to obtain a word-engraved Demonized General Companion Beast wasn\u2019t an easy endeavor. There were just too few of them and there was practically none on the market for sale.Furthermore, a Companion Beast that dropped from one\u2019s kill gave one a better sense of achievement than buying one.Just as An Jing was prepared to take action, she saw Zhou Wen suddenly dash forward like a released arrow as he headed straight for the word-engraved Demonized General.An Jing was taken aback as she hurriedly rushed over.Although she found Zhou Wen a sore sight, she didn\u2019t wish to see him die here.She believed that she could easily catch up to him since she was already at the Legendary stage while he was only at the Mortal stage.However, shortly after she chased him, she saw Zhou Wen with four translucent silver wings behind his back. Instantly, his speed was elevated significantly and was in no way inferior to a Legendary. He was even faster and prevented An Jing from catching up to him.A Legendary Companion Beast? An Jing was puzzled. Zhou Wen was only at the Mortal stage which usually meant the impossibility of incubating a Legendary Companion Beast unless Zhou Wen cultivated in Primordial Energy Arts like the Invincible Connate Divine Art.However, An Jing knew him pretty well. She knew that he only cultivated in Ascetic Meditation which made it impossible for him to incubate a Legendary Companion Beast at the Mortal stage.Furthermore, she had never seen the Companion Beast he was using. This was quite astonishing to her, considering her background as a member of the illustrious An family.Even if he has a pinnacle Legendary Companion Beast, it\u2019s impossible to fend against a word-engraved Demonized General. An Jing knew how powerful they were, so she didn\u2019t stop and continued rushing forward.However, she didn\u2019t plan on overtaking him this time. She wanted to know how strong Zhou Wen currently was. She could take action when he was in danger.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t think too much. The moment he saw that the Demonized General\u2019s helmet was a Blade, he had rushed forward.Since he had the ability to help, there was no reason for him to idly stand by. Furthermore, word-engraved Demonized Generals had a low probability of spawning even in-game. Zhou Wen was already hoping to find a Blade Demonized General, so encountering one here was a boon.Just as Li Xuan had said, he had summoned the Jade-Eyed White Tiger and Black Knight to stop the Demonized General, protecting Li Weiyang and the other girls as they retreated.The Black Knight rushed right in front of the Demonized General and slammed forward by relying on its heavy armor.Bang!The Demonized General\u2019s strange spear thrust out powerfully with roaring flames, stabbing the Black Knight\u2019s helmet right into the breastplate. Half of the Black Knight\u2019s body was slammed into the ground like a wooden column.Meanwhile, the Jade-Eyed White Tiger had leaped up, flashing its claws at the Demonized General\u2019s neck. However, before it arrived in front of the Demonized General, the left hand slashed out with a faint, thin blade beam, splitting the Jade-Eyed White Tiger into two.Li Xuan felt his heart ache. Although Legendary Companion Beasts weren\u2019t much to him, the Jade-Eyed White Tiger was quite a rare Legendary Companion Beast, so finding a second one wasn\u2019t going to be easy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It raised the strange spear in its hand and the crescent-like side blades swept across the Black Knight\u2019s waist with terrifying flames.Half of the Black Knight\u2019s body was buried in the ground and it was unable to move at all. If it was struck, it was likely to have its head separated from its body.\u201cLeave quickly.\u201d Li Xuan didn\u2019t have the luxury of time to moan over his Companion Beasts. The Blade Demonized General was just too fast and powerful. The speed at which it killed the Jade-Eyed White Tiger and Black Knight had far exceeded Li Xuan\u2019s expectations. If they didn\u2019t pull open a distance quickly, it would probably chase after them again.Suddenly, a figure flew over Li Xuan, arriving above the Demonized General in a blink of an eye. Then, it was split into two.Zhou Wen had summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and was riding on its back, rushing straight for the Demonized General\u2019s head.The Demonized General waved its left hand, shining out a lightning-like blade beam that moved at an inconceivable speed. The instant it smashed down, the beam had arrived in front of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant spread its four wings and phased away with silver, dreamy light. Its speed was instantly raised to a terrifying level, allowing it to dodge the Demonized General\u2019s blade beam.An Jing, who was prepared to take action, was stunned. The Blade Demonized General\u2019s Astral Slash Blade was famous for being fast, accurate, and mighty. Yet, that Companion Beast had managed to dodge it. It truly caught her by surprise.To have a non-avian Companion Beast that has a flight Primordial Energy Skill is rather rare. An Jing stopped in her tracks as she watched the battle.When the Demonized General missed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant with its blade, the strange spear in its hand swept flames up into the sky, hoping to sweep the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and Zhou Wen down.However, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant agilely changed directions in midair, dodging the Demonized General\u2019s strike. At the same time, its stinger shot out Magical Needle at the Demonized General\u2019s head.However, before it reached the Demonized General, it was cleaved apart by the Astral Slash Blade it sliced out with its left hand.Zhou Wen controlled the Silver-Winged Flying Ant as he battled the Demonized General. Using its speed and flight capabilities, and Silver Wing Flash, he dodged all of the Demonized General\u2019s attacks.\u201cOld Zhou, that Companion Beast is awesome. Where did you get it from? Help me get one in the future.\u201d Li Xuan\u2019s eyes glimmered as he slipped effortlessly into address Zhou Wen affectionately.To use speed to dodge the Demonized General\u2019s attacks made the Silver-Winged Flying Ant a pinnacle speed-type Companion Beast.An Jing, Li Weiyang and company also noticed the value of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, but An Jing was able to figure out more.That strange flying ant is a top speed-type Companion Beast at the Legendary stage, but to be able to dodge the Blade Demonized General\u2019s attacks so perfectly isn\u2019t something that can be done with speed alone. Zhou Wen\u2019s control and predictions are all excellent. An Jing didn\u2019t let her hatred for him affect her own judgment. She could tell how formidable Zhou Wen really was.With Zhou Wen fighting the Demonized General, Li Xuan finally seized the opportunity to get the Black Knight to escape from the ground. Just as he was about to order it to help, he saw Zhou Wen jump off from the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s back.\u201cHoly sh*t, Old Zhou, what are you trying to do?\u201d Li Xuan jumped in fright. For the Mortal Zhou Wen to lunge at the Demonized General looked no different from courting death.Li Weiyang and the other students had their hearts pounding nervously as though they were about to leap out of their chests. Even An Jing\u2019s breathing sped up.From An Jing\u2019s point of view, Zhou Wen\u2019s actions were too rash. Furthermore, there weren\u2019t any substantial effects.He was only at the Mortal stage. With Strength at the Mortal stage, even if it was boosted by Primordial Energy Skills, striking a Demonized General\u2019s helmet probably didn\u2019t deal it much damage.Zhou Wen wore a stoic expression as his body rapidly plummeted. He swung his arm that had been enveloped by the skeleton bracer, striking straight at the top of the Demonized General\u2019s head.This leap looked like a risky move, but in fact, Zhou Wen had already simulated it hundreds of times in his head. Ever since he had fought the word-engraved Demonized General, he had been thinking of a way to kill them.The only possibility was to first kill the Blade Demonized General. As for the Paper Demonized General, he temporarily had no means of killing it.This leap had been calculated by Zhou Wen countless times before he deduced the opportunity.Back when the Silver-Winged Flying Ant kept flying, it had made the Demonized General run through all its moves. Its Primordial Energy Skills had all been used and it couldn\u2019t immediately use them again. All those powerful moves prevented it from instantly retaliating against Zhou Wen.Bang!Zhou Wen leaped down headfirst as his palm struck the Demonized General\u2019s helmet.If it were only an ordinary Mortal Primordial Energy Skill, it wouldn\u2019t be able to tear through the helmet\u2019s defense with the skeleton bracer\u2019s augmentation.However, Zhou Wen\u2019s Ashen Palm at Rank 10 was different. This was a palm with a cold, explosive might. It could generate a penetrative effect at short distances.Although this palm looked like it had smacked the helmet, its force had already penetrated into the Demonized General\u2019s head, striking its brains.With the success of the attack, Zhou Wen pressed down on the Demonized General\u2019s helmet and used the reactionary force to retreat several meters. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant was already waiting there for him as he somersaulted and landed on its back, his eyes staring intently at the Demonized General.As he had never attempted it in-game, he wasn\u2019t sure of the effects of this palm strike.An Jing, Li Xuan, and the other students were also staring at the Demonized General. They felt that the palm didn\u2019t seem to have much of an effect as there wasn\u2019t any mark on its helmet.But the next second, the Demonized General looked up and spewed a mouthful of blood before collapsing from its horse. The red horse neighed as it exploded, scattering its flesh and blood everywhere.He had managed to slay a word-engraved Demonized General! When An Jing saw the horse explode, she knew that the Demonized General was definitely dead.Li Xuan yelled, \u201cDid anyone do a recording? Did anyone record that battle? How long did he take?\u201dThe school\u2019s test missions required video proof. Although he didn\u2019t know how long Zhou Wen had taken, it didn\u2019t feel like he took more than ninety seconds.\u201cI did,\u201d a girl beside Li Weiyang said meekly.The few of them had come to complete a test mission, so they had a video recording the entire time. They had also recorded the battle that had just finished.Li Weiyang got the girl to play the recording as they looked over. He had taken 79 seconds.\u201cOld Zhou, you took 79 seconds to kill a word-engraved Demonized General. You are really awesome!\u201d Li Xuan yelled at Zhou Wen.Zhou Wen was in no mood to care about the numbers. He ran straight to the dead Demonized General, hoping to find a dimensional crystal or Companion Egg from its corpse.Pulling apart the Demonized General\u2019s helmet, he saw red and white fluids flow out. Amidst that was a resplendent object.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The glow had the appearance of the Demonized General, making it a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal.\u201cThe Blade Demonized General\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill. I wonder which one is it. He\u2019s really struck it rich if it\u2019s Astral Slash Blade,\u201d Li Xuan said as he approached to take a look at the crystal.As the Blade Demonized General had several Primordial Energy Skills, with Astral Slash Blade being one of them, the chances of it dropping were extremely low even if a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal were to drop.By the side, An Jing suddenly said, \u201cThe Demonized General figure inside the crystal has a faint red glow on the word engraved on top of its head. This Primordial Energy Skill Crystal is Astral Slash Blade.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really Astral Slash Blade! Old Zhou, your luck is really unparalleled!\u201d Li Xuan said in excitement, \u201cIf you wish to sell this Astral Slash Blade skill, just sell it to me. I\u2019ll quickly advance to the Legendary stage, so I\u2019ll be able to use it.\u201dZhou Wen shook his head slightly and placed the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal in his pocket.The average person couldn\u2019t withstand the surge of Primordial Energy Skills at the Mortal stage. Any forceful absorption would damage the body, and in serious cases, might even lead to death.However, Zhou Wen was different. If he could take the Primordial Energy Skill into the game and let the blood-colored avatar attempt to absorb it, he himself wouldn\u2019t be in any danger.Zhou Wen had already tried absorbing Legendary Primordial Energy Skills in-game and all of them had happened without a hitch.Zhou Wen\u2019s news of killing the word-engraved Demonized General quickly spread across campus. To kill one in 79 seconds was unheard of even amongst special admissions students.However, the topic of conversation was the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. Many people believed that it was due to it that Zhou Wen was able to slay the word-engraved Demonized General. Such Speed and ability of flight made it a top Speed-type, flight-capable Companion Beast among those at the Legendary stage.After Wang Fei saw the recording of Zhou Wen slaying the word-engraved Demonized General, she gave Zhou Wen a very high evaluation, believing him to be a talent worth nurturingEven An Jing, who always found him a sore sight, viewed him in a different light. She believed that Zhou Wen would once again get back on his feet, turning back into the genius he once was.However, Wang Fei and An Jing quickly realized they were wrong. After killing the word-engraved Demonized General, Zone didn\u2019t come out of his dorm at all. He didn\u2019t enter the dimensional zones to train himself, nor did he attend any classes.An Jing often saw Zhou Wen lying in the yard, holding his phone gaming while sunbathing. He gamed for several hours at a time without even changing his pose.After he obtained the Astral Slash Blade Primordial Energy Skill, many students tried to buy it from him through different means, but they were all rejected by him.Although Zhou Wen already had the ability to kill Blade Demonized Generals and could always slowly grind one in-game, that would take him too much time. He didn\u2019t wish to waste any time for just some pittance of money.On the day he returned home with the Astral Slash Blade Crystal, he had tried using the mysterious phone to snap a picture of it. It instantly pulled it in-game and allowed him to successfully master the Astral Slash Blade Primordial Energy Skill.What left Zhou Wen perplexed was that Astral Slash Blade was somewhat different from the typical Primordial Energy Skill. This was because it didn\u2019t have a rank and the amount of Primordial Energy it expended wasn\u2019t fixed.Either 1 or 10 points of Primordial Energy was enough to release Astral Slash Blade, but the unleashed force was different. The more Primordial Energy used, the stronger the Astral Slash Blade\u2019s beam was.Zhou Wen had tested the might of the Astral Slash Blade in-game. When using 10 points of Primordial Energy, it could instantly cull the Legendary Silver-Winged Flying Ant in midair. It was fast and ruthless, giving him the exhilaration of killing someone through empty space. It was something Ashen Palm and Vigor Divine Fist couldn\u2019t compete with.Over the past few days, Zhou Wen had been grinding Tiger Cage Pass in a bid to encounter Paper Demonized Generals. He wanted to see if Astral Slash Blade could crack the Primordial Energy Skill of the Paper Demonized General.Unfortunately, his luck was terrible. After repeatedly grinding Tiger Cage Pass, he only encountered one word-engraved Demonized General. It wasn\u2019t a Blade Demonized General, but a Fist Demonized General.When Astral Slash Blade and Zhou Wen\u2019s other Primordial Energy Skills hit the Fist Demonized General, its body would flash a golden light as though it was layered in gold. Even the Astral Slash Blade\u2019s beam couldn\u2019t leave a scratch.Finally, the blood-colored avatar was slain by the Fist Demonized General with one charge, leaving him rather disheartened.However, he was used to such outcomes. Compared to others being capable of encountering one word-engraved Demonized General in a timespan of two to three months, his efficiency was considered a lot higher.Just as he was preparing to continue grinding Tiger Cage Pass, he heard his phone ring. He still picked it up despite it being an unknown number.\u201cIs this Zhou Wen? You have a delivery.\u201d A man\u2019s voice sounded from the phone.I don\u2019t think I bought anything on the Internet recently. Who would deliver something to me? Zhou Wen thought for a while to no avail. However, he went to the door to take receipt of the parcel.The parcel wasn\u2019t very big. Zhou Wen looked at it carefully and saw that the sender had the word \u201cprincipal\u201d written on it.The former principal mailed me something? Zhou Wen found that the most probably.Previously, Ouyang Lan had mentioned to him that the former principal had been invited to a mysterious dimensional zone and hadn\u2019t returned to date. That was because the magnetic fields there were abnormal, preventing any communication devices to be used. Even Ouyang Lan didn\u2019t know his present situation.After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen opened the parcel and couldn\u2019t help but be shocked when he saw the thing inside.The parcel wasn\u2019t big to begin with. Stuffed inside it were several old newspapers, but the only thing of note was a name card.It was a real name card. The owner of the name card was the owner of a dimensional crystal shop. His name was Qin Xiyuan. On the back of the name card was the address and contact number of the shop.Apart from that, there was a string of numbers that were handwritten at the bottom. It was just underneath the telephone number, so it looked like an additional number to call.Is this name card really from the former principal? Zhou Wen felt puzzled, unsure why he would mail this to him.He picked up the delivery notice and tried calling the sender\u2019s number, but he only received the notification: \u201cThe number you called is not in service.\u201dWhat\u2019s going on? Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t help but frown. He took a look at the sender\u2019s address and saw that it was a place in the East District named Zhuolu County. There wasn\u2019t an exact street or unit number.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Let Me Game in Peacechapter 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen studied it for quite some time before figuring out what the name card meant. On it was a string of handwritten numbers that didn\u2019t seem like a telephone number.Typical cell phone numbers were 11 digits with landlines being 7. However, this number had 10 digits, so it clearly wasn\u2019t right.It didn\u2019t seem right either that certain digits of a cell phone number were missing. This was because the string of numbers started with a 5 while cell phone numbers typically started with 1. Most people usually wouldn\u2019t write the first digit wrongly.What does this string of numbers represent? Zhou Wen had the urge to ask the former principal if it was from him, but he didn\u2019t have his contact details.Although he could return to the An family to ask Ouyang Lan, he didn\u2019t wish to have too much interaction with them, nor did he wish to head to the An family home again.Ouyang Lan was nice, but Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t fond of the An siblings, much less wish to have much to do with them.After some thought, he put away the name card. If this item had really been mailed to him by the former principal, it was likely that he would contact him in the future.After packing up, Zhou Wen continued gamingWang Fei\u2019s mood was terrible. Her opinion was that Zhou Wen was a genius. For him to slay the Blade Demonized General single-handedly, that level of combat skill was enough to shock Sunset College even if one didn\u2019t consider his cultivation talent.Wang Fei believed that if he was properly nurtured, his future was limitless. Furthermore, Ouyang Lan had also requested her to take good care of him.No matter how good his talent is, it will all go to waste if he keeps gaming. I have to place him back on the right track. Wang Fei believed that she was obligated and responsible for teaching Zhou Wen well.Even without Ouyang Lan, she didn\u2019t wish a genius like Zhou Wen to let his talent go to waste.How can I get Zhou Wen to quit gaming and reestablish his values towards life and the world? Wang Fei frowned in thought.The harm games brought about was a serious societal issue before the dimensional storms. Countless parents and teachers did their best to stop students from being obsessed with gaming, but this problem wasn\u2019t solved at its roots.After the dimensional storms, due to the change in society and the collective consciousness, the number of students who gamed had reduced significantly. However, there were still many who were obsessed with gaming.Wang Fei felt that Zhou Wen mustn\u2019t have fallen too deep. After all, he had been a diligent student in the past. He was only using games to escape reality after suffering a heavy setback.However, from the two battles Zhou Wen engaged in after coming to Sunset College, his foundation was excellent. He had to be a very diligent and assiduous student. As long as his confidence and values towards life were established again, he could quit his gaming addiction.After some thought, Wang Fei\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up. He that hides can find. Since Zhou Wen lost his confidence and is escaping from reality after his defeat by An Jing, wouldn\u2019t defeating An Jing allow him to reestablish his confidence?The more Wang Fei thought about it, the more viable she found it to be. To get Zhou Wen to defeat a genius like An Jing was also a challenge and accomplishment for a teacher. This would only make it more interesting.Wang Fei steeled her resolve to complete this plan of hers. She wished that a student she mentored could defeat An Jing who the An family treated like a treasure. Even her body heated up in excitement.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t know that he had become a gaming addict youth in Wang Fei\u2019s eyes. He had even become a target for receiving plenty of help. At this moment, he was still focusing on grindingHaving lost count of the number of times he grinded Tiger Cage Pass, Zhou Wen finally encountered a word-engraved Demonized General. From a distance, Zhou Wen was delighted because engraving on the Demonized General\u2019s helmet was \u201cPaper.\u201dHe sent the blood-colored avatar charging at the Demonized General for he was already very familiar with its series of attacks. With the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s Speed, it wasn\u2019t difficult for him to deal with it.When the blood-colored avatar dodged the strange spear\u2019s first strike, the Paper Demonized General used its Astral Suction Palm. It widened its left palm and aimed it at the blood-colored avatar.The blood-colored avatar seemed to be bound by a potent, invisible force and was yanked towards the Paper Demonized General.With a thought from Zhou Wen, the blood-colored avatar\u2019s left palm exploded a faint beam that resembled a blade. It instantly sliced through the invisible force beyond his body.The Astral Suction Palm\u2019s strength was like a piece of paper that was sliced through by the sharp blade beam. The thin silk-like blade beam then cleaved into the gap between the Paper Demonized General\u2019s helmet and breastplate, beheading it with one strike.Zhou Wen was delighted. Although he guessed that Astral Slash Blade could counter the Paper Demonized General\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill, he never expected it to be this strong. He had expended 10 points of Primordial Energy for the Astral Slash Blade, and it ended up beheading the Paper Demonized General.\u2018Killed Mutated Demonized General. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.\u2019However, what left Zhou Wen depressed was that the Paper Demonized General didn\u2019t drop a Primordial Energy Skill or Companion Egg. All it dropped was a Strength Crystal valued at 18.If Zhou Wen had advanced to the Legendary stage, such a Strength Crystal was naturally the best. He would instantly have his Strength stat rise to 18. Unfortunately, he was still at the Mortal stage and his Strength\u2019s limit couldn\u2019t be broken. Having such a high-valued Strength Crystal was useless.Rushing in the direction of Tiger Cage Pass, he was shot to death once again. It was equivalent to him committing suicide but he had no way of having the dungeon respawn its monsters without him dying.When he entered the game again, Zhou Wen killed the Skeleton General, Silver-Winged Flying Ant, and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus once more.As the chances of a drop were too low, Zhou Wen\u2019s repeated grinding didn\u2019t reward him with anything good. However, with a massive number of grinding instances, anything with a low probability would eventually drop.This time, after killing the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus, a Companion Egg dropped. When Zhou Wen saw its stats, his eyes lit up. He nearly kissed the Companion Egg.Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus: LegendaryLegendary Life Providence: Turbid Waters Clear LotusStrength: 18Speed: 15Constitution: 17Primordial Energy: 18Talent Skill: Blood-Patterned Buddha Aspect, Lotus Bullets, Venom Toad, Buddha Lotus Rage.A Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus with four talent skills. Its Strength and Primordial Energy are considered at max level. Even for a flower-type Companion Beast with weak Constitution, it\u2019s at 17. This Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus is an excellent one! Zhou Wen drooled as he looked at the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg.But in an instant, Zhou Wen felt vexed. He couldn\u2019t bear to feed such an excellent-grade Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus to Truth Listener and the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.However, if he were to incubate it, his lacking Primordial Energy might create new problems.I can only risk it. Zhou Wen saw that the Mutated Skeleton Ant and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s fusion success rate and decided to fuse them together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This also meant that the chance of a successful fusion was at about a third. It was quite a low probability.However, the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus was so excellent that Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t bring himself to feed it to Truth Listener. He had no way of taking it out of the game after all.As for the Mutated Skeleton Ant, although it was quite a good Mortal Companion Beast, it was limited by its Mortal stage. After having the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, there was a decreasing need for it. Even if he didn\u2019t fuse it now, it would gradually be eliminated in the future.Therefore, after plenty of thought, he decided to risk it to fuse the two Companion Beasts together.After Zhou Wen chose to proceed with the fusion of the Mutated Skeleton Ant and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus, the game system immediately gave a notification: \u2018As the Mutated Skeleton Ant is an adult, the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus will be treated as a supplement for fusion. Proceed with fusion?\u2019It was identical to the previous time. Zhou Wen was already mentally prepared, so he instantly chose \u2018Yes.\u2019The Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg and Mutated Skeleton Ant bloomed with light as the former flew to the latter. As the two blobs of light merged into one, it caused the entire phone screen to light up. Instantly, nothing could be seen.Zhou Wen waited for quite some time until the phone\u2019s screen dimmed. Then, he heard a chime.\u2018Fusion successful. Obtained Legendary Companion Beast, Mutated Lotus Flower Ant.\u2019Only then could Zhou Wen see a Companion Beast on his screen. It didn\u2019t look much different from the Mutated Skeleton Ant from before. It still had a white bone exterior and its body seemed to be bigger. On its head, there was a budding blood-colored lotus flower.After opening the stats of the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant, Zhou Wen was overjoyed by what he saw.Mutated Lotus Flower Ant: LegendaryLegendary Life Providence: Turbid Waters Clear LotusStrength: 19Speed: 17Constitution: 18Primordial Energy: 18Talent Skill: Skeleton Pierce (Rank 10), Blood-Patterned Buddha Aspect (Rank 9), Lotus Bullets (Rank 5), Venom Toad (rank 8), Buddha Lotus Rage (Rank 9).Companion Form: Bracer.The Lotus Ant had inherited the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s Life Providence-Turbid Waters Clear Lotus. It was a pretty good and pragmatic one that made it immune to venomous liquids and corrosion.Amongst the four stats, only Speed was 1 point short of maxing out. As for Strength, it was an Overdrive at 19, having exceeded the limits of a typical Legendary maximum. It was considered the best among the best.Even crazier was that the Lotus Ant had retained all the Mutated Skeleton Ant\u2019s and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus\u2019s skills, becoming one with five Primordial Energy Skills. Furthermore, it was a terrifying existence with rather high Primordial Energy Skill ranks.If such a Legendary Companion Beast was put on sale, just the fact that it had five Primordial Energy Skills was enough for it to be sold at an astronomical price. If there was an overall Legendary Companion Beast ranking, the Mutated Lotus Ant would definitely rank high.In his joy, Zhou Wen summoned the Mutated Lotus Ant and saw a horrifying tank-sized ant appear in front of him. Its body was covered in terrifying bone spikes that made it look ferocious and terrifying.But on its head was a red lotus flower. It was connected to the top of its head with a flower bud. It made its terrifying looks appear rather adorable.As the Mutated Lotus Ant crawled, the lotus flower on its head would bob up and down, making it rather interesting.Just as Zhou Wen was admiring the Mutated Lotus Ant, he suddenly heard the doorbell ring. After dispelling the summon, he opened the door and was astonished to see Wang Fei.Sunset College\u2019s education methods were very simple. One counselor led a class and was responsible for giving class homework and missions. Under normal circumstances, they wouldn\u2019t be directly involved in the education of students.Students could select which teacher\u2019s classes they attended based on the mission they had. They could then learn the knowledge and techniques they needed.Therefore, although Wang Fei was Zhou Wen\u2019s counselor, there weren\u2019t many opportunities for him to meet her. She typically wouldn\u2019t request a meeting with her students before the ten-day deadline of the last mission.Unless a student encountered problems and sought her help, a counselor typically didn\u2019t interfere with a student\u2019s usual studies.\u201cZhou Wen, pack your things. Let\u2019s have a walk,\u201d Wang Fei said directly before he could even speak.\u201cMiss Wang, what do you want me to do?\u201d Zhou Wen asked, feeling somewhat unhappily.Wang Fei said with a smile, \u201cProfessor Chen has a project that requires a student to be his assistant. I think you are very suitable for it, so I recommended you to him.\u201d\u201cIs that a homework mission?\u201d Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He had no intention of being an assistant.He had long heard of the benefits that came from being a professor\u2019s assistant as it allowed one to interact with many high-level objects and broaden one\u2019s horizons while also gaining some pointers from a professor. It was an opportunity many students wanted.However, Zhou Wen didn\u2019t like having such an opportunity. Although it was beneficial, it required him to sacrifice his time to work for the professor.To other students, such work was a way of honing themselves, a type of improvement. But to Zhou Wen, it was a waste of time that would eat into his gaming time.\u201cIt\u2019s not a homework mission. I just find you very suited for it, so I recommended you. Professor Chen has great achievements when it comes to nurturing Companion Beasts. In Sunset College, he\u2019s an authority in such matters. Furthermore, he has done a great amount of research on melee-fighting Primordial Energy Skills. I believe it will be very beneficial to you if you were to learn from him.\u201d Wang Fei was feeling rather pleased with herself.Professor Chen was a famous old fogey. Getting anyone to convince him to take in another student as an assistant was practically impossible. In Sunset College, not more than three people could get Professor Chen to agree to such a request.Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t able to see Wang Fei\u2019s face as he said directly, \u201cMiss Wang, if it\u2019s not a homework mission, I hope to decline the offer.\u201dWang Fei\u2019s smile instantly froze. Imagining that Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t aware of what was happening, she explained, \u201cProfessor Chen Qishan isn\u2019t just an authoritative figure in Sunset College, but in the entire League. By being his assistant, you can come into contact with several high-level Companion Beasts and learn of their characteristics and powers. This will be of tremendous help to your future exploring of dimensional zones. Furthermore, Professor Chen is\u2026\u201dBefore Wang Fei could finish, Zhou Wen said firmly, \u201cMiss Wang, thank you for your kind intentions. I still wish to decline. My usual homework missions give me enough stress. I need time for studying and revision. I really do not have enough time, so if it isn\u2019t a homework mission, I wish to decline.\u201dWang Fei felt as if she had been doused in cold water. All her excitement and glee instantly turned to nothing. It left her mood extremely nasty.\u201cAre you sure you are declining?\u201d Wang Fei asked Zhou Wen with a glare.\u201cYes, Miss Wang.\u201d Zhou Wen clearly wasn\u2019t good at reading people as he nodded.\u201cAlright.\u201d Wang Fei turned and left, her teeth grinding angrily.As Zhou Wen\u2019s counselor, one who had paid special attention to him, Wang Fei knew that he hadn\u2019t attended any teacher classes for the past few days, so what did he mean by studying and revision? Apart from slaying the Blade Demonized General, he likely spent most of his days in his dorm gaming.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Regardless of her being a counselor or Ouyang Lan\u2019s good friend, she believed that she had the obligation to rescue Zhou Wen who was a gaming addict who had excellent talent.Since you have no intention of improving yourself, I\u2019ll make you realize the importance with the help of external forces. Wang Fei\u2019s eyes darted about as she came up with an idea.However, her idea couldn\u2019t be carried out immediately. She needed to wait for the Demonized General slaying mission to end before she could use a new homework mission and force Zhou Wen to face the difficulty.In the next homework mission, it appears I need to get that little fellow to make a trip to Jingshi Mountain. Wang Fei\u2019s eyes flickered with excitement.Jingshi Mountain was also known as Mount Laojun. It was the main peak in the of the Funiu Mountain Range that spanned 400 kilometers. Legend had it that this was the place the founder of Daoism, Li Er, had hidden himself. Although the legend\u2019s veracity couldn\u2019t be confirmed, Mount Laojun also became a dimensional storms zone after the dimensional storms. Furthermore, it became rather strange.The other dimensional zones were fraught with danger with dimensional creatures extremely ferocious. However, Mount Laojun\u2019s dimensional creatures wouldn\u2019t attack humans without reason. They almost never injured anyone.Mount Laojun\u2019s Golden Peak had many Daoist temples, but to date, no one had been able to conquer the Golden Peak.Beneath the Golden Peak was a Wordless Monument. Although there were no words engraved on it, whoever viewed it would feel inspired and refreshed. They wouldn\u2019t be frustrated by trivialities of the human world. Therefore, the Wordless Monument was named Unwinding Monument.However, looking at Unwinding Monument for a while was good, but if one looked at it for too long, one\u2019s mind would be so stimulated that not only couldn\u2019t they sleep, they would even be in a hyperactive state, as though they had infinite energy and were eager to do something.Some people who looked at Unwinding Monument for too long would begin boxing with all their might for three full days. Others would begin running until they were exhausted and unable to crawl.In short, as long as one looked at the Unwinding Monument, they would become extremely inspired and diligent no matter how lazy they were.The amount of time one looked at Unwinding Monument had to be controlled. If one were to stare at it for too long, they might die from overstimulation. It was something that had happened before.Although Mount Laojun was in Luoyang, it wasn\u2019t inside Sunset College. Therefore, Wang Fei planned on leading the class to Mount Laojun after the Demonized General homework mission was over.Zhou Wen continued grinding in his form, but he wasn\u2019t just mindlessly grinding.He had planned on rushing into Ant City, Fire God Platform, and Tiger Cage Pass to see if there were any places similar to Small Buddha Temple. Unfortunately, he met with repeated failures.Zhou Wen had a suspicion that the reason the Lost Immortal Sutra couldn\u2019t advance him to Legendary had to do with his mastery of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in Small Buddha Temple.Due to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, Zhou Wen\u2019s stat had broken through to 11 points while the other stats remained at 10.Therefore, Zhou Wen believed that the Lost Immortal Sutra allowed him to master other Primordial Energy Arts and they also could perhaps raise his other stats to 11.He didn\u2019t know if the Lost Immortal Sutra had such a feature, nor did he know if he could advance to the Legendary stage when all his stats reached 11. However, it brought him some hope, far better than not having any clue at all.It was a pity that Zhou Wen didn\u2019t find any places similar to Small Buddha Temple. There was a monument above the Fire God Platform, but there were firebirds protecting it, preventing him from rushing up and seeing what the monument with the word \u201cImperial\u201d engraved on it was.Truth Listener is said to be a Mythical Companion Beast, so all its beginning stats are at 11. Perhaps the value 11 has some specialness. Zhou Wen thought about rushing to the Fire God Platform again, but before he could rush to its peak, he died under the ever-increasing horde of firebirds.From the looks of it, I need to obtain a Primordial Energy Art that imbues alacrity. It\u2019s impossible to reach the top of Fire God Platform by simply relying on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. Zhou Wen switched off the phone and began researching on the school\u2019s website.Currently, his phone had Ant Nest, Ancient Imperial City, Underground Buddha City, and Tiger Cage Pass. None of these dungeons produced Primordial Energy Skills that imbued alacrity. Therefore, Zhou Wen had to find new dungeons.The school\u2019s data was very comprehensive. When he searched for Primordial Energy Skills that imbued alacrity, he quickly found an answer.Sunset College had many dimensional zones that produced such skills. And the most famous one was at Dragon Gate Grotto.There were two from Dragon Gate Grotto. One of them was the Mount Dragon Gate\u2019s Fish Dragon Transformation while the other was the Dragon Gate Grotto\u2019s Dragon Gate Fairy Skill.Mount Dragon Gate\u2019s Fish Dragon Transformation stemmed from the legend of carps jumping through a dragon gate to transform into a dragon. It was a Primordial Energy Skill that allowed one to soar straight up to a height of hundreds of feet as though one was flying in the sky.However, a single leap of Fish Dragon Transformation was enough to drain all of one\u2019s Primordial Energy. Such massive expenditure wasn\u2019t one that Zhou Wen needed. Furthermore, Mount Dragon Gate wasn\u2019t in Sunset College.Dragon Gate Fairy Skill was the complete opposite of Fish Dragon Transformation. It was a long-lasting Primordial Energy Skill that imbued alacrity. It used one\u2019s changes in motion to fly and dance in the sky like a fairy. Although it needed a point to leverage upon, making it not true flight, it was good enough.However, obtaining the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill wasn\u2019t simple. This was only produced by the Lotus Flower Cave in Dragon Gate Grotto. Furthermore, the drop rate was very low. People could spend more than a year inside without having it drop.Firstly, Dragon Gate Fairy Skill\u2019s drop rate was very low and secondly, there were very few dimensional creatures in Lotus Flower Cave.Zhou Wen naturally didn\u2019t have any qualms about that. All he needed to do was head to Dragon Gate Grotto and download the dungeon before being able to grind it infinitely. He didn\u2019t need to worry about not having dimensional creatures to clear.Of course, that was on the premise that he had enough blood to support such an action.Thinking of how great his recent blood loss was, he drank a mouthful of his self-brewed blood replenishing tea. Although it didn\u2019t seem to be of any use, it gave him a placebo effect.He was about to head to Dragon Gate Grotto and see if he could download it, but to his surprise, just as he left his building, he saw the young white-gloved military officer standing at his yard\u2019s entrance, instructing two soldiers to carry a crate in.Zhou Wen recognized the young military officer. He was An Tianzuo\u2019s adjutant and driver who he had met before.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t know why he was here. Just as he was about to ask, the adjutant said, \u201cYoung Master Wen, Madam has requested me to bring this crate to you. Please acknowledge receipt.\u201dZhou Wen frowned slightly and walked over to the crate and opened it up a little. Immediately, he saw all kinds of dazzling dimensional crystals inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If it\u2019s not enough, you can always request more from Madam. She had actually planned on preparing a few Companion Beasts that would be suitable for you, but after recognizing the fact that you would be advancing to the Legendary stage soon, they weren\u2019t made. There will be more choices and useful ones when the time comes,\u201d the adjutant said.\u201cSis Lan really gave this to me?\u201d Zhou Wen asked the adjutant.\u201cYes,\u201d the adjutant answered with great certainty.\u201cThen help me thank Sis Lan. I appreciate the gesture, but I don\u2019t need it,\u201d Zhou Wen said as he lowered the lid.The adjutant looked at Zhou Wen in surprise. \u201cYoung Master Wen, this is your allowance, just like Miss Jing. It\u2019s what you deserve.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what An Jing deserves, not me. I have no need for it either. Please return and tell Sis Lan. I respect her, but my surname isn\u2019t An,\u201d Zhou Wen said.The adjutant looked at Zhou Wen but stopped trying to persuade him. He just took out a pen and paper to write down a cell phone number and handed it to him with both hands. \u201cYoung Master Wen, I\u2019ll take the items back. This is my number where I\u2019m contactable any time of the day. If you have any requests, feel free to give me a call.\u201d\u201cAlright. Thank you.\u201d Zhou Wen took the paper slip and saw the number. There were the words \u201cAh Sheng\u201d written behind the number, perhaps the name of the adjutant.However, the name looked more like a nickname or pet name. It didn\u2019t seem like a real name.As though he noticed Zhou Wen\u2019s doubts, Ah Sheng said, \u201cI was picked up by Overseer An in a dimensional zone. I had suffered serious injuries to my head and lost all my memories. Overseer An hopes that I can be reborn from the flames, which is why he gave me the name \u201csheng\u201d representing life. I also took on his surname as An. Young Master Wen, you can just call me Ah Sheng.\u201d\u201cAlright, thank you Ah Sheng. Please help me take the things back.\u201d Zhou Wen put away the paper slip and after sending Adjutant Ah Sheng off, he headed straight for Dragon Gate Grotto.Ah Sheng returned to the An family with the items; however, he didn\u2019t take them to Ouyang Lan but to An Tianzuo.\u201cWhy did you bring the items back?\u201d An Tianzuo looked at the crate with a frown.\u201cYoung Master Wen wanted me to bring them back,\u201d Ah Sheng said.\u201cDid you tell him that they were from my mom?\u201d An Tianzuo asked.\u201cYes, Young Master Wen said to thank her. He appreciates her gesture, but he doesn\u2019t want the items,\u201d Ah Sheng replied truthfully.\u201cThen put them away,\u201d An Tianzuo said after some thought.\u201cOverseer, I think Young Master Wen must have guessed that these things weren\u2019t from Madam,\u201d Ah Sheng added.\u201cWhy so?\u201d An Tianzuo asked with piqued interest.\u201cJust a feeling without any basis.\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t a woman, so what feeling is there to speak off.\u201d An Tianzuo paused and said, \u201cThis Zhou Wen has quite a backbone. However, one cannot be successful with backbone alone. If he wishes to cultivate the Sun Strafe Art, it\u2019s a mystery how long it will take for him to advance to the Legendary stage without enough Primordial Energy Crystals. We can\u2019t have Little Jing waiting for him all the time, right?\u201d\u201cOverseer, I have something I\u2019m not sure if I should say,\u201d Ah Sheng said with some hesitation.\u201cCut it out. When have you held back?\u201d An Tianzuo said with a grunt.Ah Sheng said, \u201cMiss Jing\u2019s body isn\u2019t good, so Madam preventing her vying for the special physique is for her own good, but why must she compete with Young Master Wen for supremacy?\u201dAn Tianzuo said lightly, \u201cI know Little Jing\u2019s personality all too well. She doesn\u2019t care about the nomination, but she wants to prove to Mom that Zhou Wen isn\u2019t as excellent as Grandfather claims him to be, and definitely not better than she is.\u201dZhou Wen followed the navigation and headed for Dragon Gate Grotto.As Dragon Gate Grotto was just too huge, Sunset College actually covered a tiny area of it. Most of it was outside the campus.After Zhou Wen arrived, he realized a serious problem.Places like Ancient Imperial City, Underground Buddha City, and Tiger Cage Pass had a small palm symbol that allowed him to see it at a glance, thereby successfully scanning it and downloading the dungeon.However, Dragon Gate Grotto was a kilometer-long stretch. There were countless stone monuments and stone sculptures here, but there was nothing that resembled an entrance like a city gate. There was no obvious spot to find the small palm symbol.There were many caves that could be entered in Dragon Gate Grotto. The dimensional zones inside formed an infinitely extensive area. For instance, the Lotus Flower Cave which Zhou Wen wanted to go to was just one of many.Without the palm symbol, Zhou Wen could only follow the river, carefully taking in everything around him\u2014the Buddha statues and stone sculptures. He hoped to find the palm symbol and download the dungeon into his mysterious phone.The Dragon Gate Grotto had about a hundred thousand Buddha statues. The tallest one reached nearly twenty meters and there were more than fifty caves. The masonry numbered thousands. After the dimensional storms, every cave had a huge number of dimensional creatures appearing in their interior.Zhou Wen looked around as he walked, making extremely slow progress. However, he didn\u2019t find the palm symbol.\u201cZhou Wen?\u201d As he was searching for the symbol along the river, he suddenly heard someone call his name.Zhou Wen turned and realized that the person who called out to him was the girl, Wang Lu, who lived next door to him.\u201cZhou Wen, have you come to Dragon Gate Grotto for cultivation as well?\u201d Wang Lu asked with a smile.\u201cI\u2019m just here to take a look. I don\u2019t plan on entering,\u201d Zhou Wen said.\u201cSince you\u2019re here, it\u2019s a shame if you don\u2019t go in. I heard there have recently been dragon roars inside Old Dragon Cave. There\u2019s also a treasure-like glow that appears at night. It\u2019s very strange. Why don\u2019t you go in with me to take a look?\u201d Wang Lu invited.\u201cThe stranger it is, the more dangerous it is. It\u2019s better I do not enter,\u201d Zhou Wen said as he continued walking ahead.Wang Lu stuck her tongue out and headed for Old Dragon Cave.Dragon Gate Grotto was just too huge and there were too many carvings. To find a small palm symbol clearly wasn\u2019t an easy task. Zhou Wen was very patient, but despite scouring every inch, he ultimately failed to find the tiny symbol.Could it be that not all dimensional zones can be downloaded? Zhou Wen began having doubts, but he continued searching.Outside Dragon Gate Grotto was a rather popular place as many Sunset College students came here for cultivation and to kill dimensional creatures.There were some people from Luoyang who weren\u2019t students who entered via the north entrance. He also saw many people setting up shop by the caves, some selling the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs that came from the respective cave.Upon seeing those stalls selling Companion Eggs, Zhou Wen suddenly had a thought. The mysterious phone can download a Companion Egg into the game via taking a picture. Then, can I take the Companion Eggs of others in-game by snapping a photo? The phone shouldn\u2019t be smart enough to tell who the Companion Egg belongs to, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Let Me Game in Peacechapter 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Wen wasn\u2019t the kind of person who would rob for no good reason. Although he thought of doing so, he didn\u2019t actually do it.However, he still used the phone\u2019s camera app to aim it at a Companion Egg placed on a stall but he didn\u2019t press the shutter button.Although he didn\u2019t snap the photo, the phone\u2019s screen still showed the Companion Egg\u2019s stats.Stone Warrior: LegendaryLife Providence: Stone ContractStrength: 16Speed: 13Constitution: 16Primordial Energy: 12Talent Skill: Stone Blast PunchIt was a Legendary Companion Egg with very ordinary stats and nothing outstanding. However, the mysterious phone\u2019s feature delighted Zhou Wen.Dimensional crystals did not have numbers in real life, but technological methods could be used to roughly measure their power. This allowed them to roughly tell the level of dimensional crystals.However, Companion Eggs could not be measured at all because the same type of Companion Eggs gave almost the same figures even when measured using a device. To get a Companion Beast with excellent stats depended on luck.With the mysterious phone\u2019s feature, he could directly see the Companion Egg\u2019s stats. That way, he didn\u2019t need to count on his luck and directly choose a Companion Egg with excellent stats for incubation.The Companion Eggs sold at Dragon Gate Grotto were basically at the Legendary stage and were few in variety. Most stalls only sold two types.One of them was a Stone Warrior and the other was Stone Qilin. Other than those, it was rare to see other types.\u201cBoss, are there any other Companion Eggs besides the Stone Warriors and Stone Qilin?\u201d Zhou Wen asked curiously.The boss shook his head impatiently and said, \u201cNo, Dragon Gate Grotto produces plenty of these. The other Companion Eggs have an extremely low chance of dropping. They are almost unobtainable. Even if someone obtains one, they won\u2019t sell it cheaply.\u201dBefore Zhou Wen could ask further, he heard someone beside him say, \u201cThe Stone Warriors and Stone Qilins are the most common dimensional creatures in Dragon Gate Grotto. The probability of them dropping Companion Eggs is also very high. In Luoyang, those at the Legendary stage will have two Companion Beasts but don\u2019t think little of them just because they are common. In fact, excellent-grade Stone Warriors and Stone Qilins are rather powerful and useful Legendary Companion Beasts.\u201dZhou Wen turned his head and realized that the person who spoke was Wang Lu.Wang Lu continued, \u201cAn excellent-grade Stone Warrior is top amongst its peers in terms of Strength and Constitution. They are just a tad slower. However, the might of its Stone Blast Punch is very powerful. It\u2019s a Companion Beast with extremely strong offensive ability. A Stone Qilin is even stronger. A typical Stone Qilin has a Primordial Energy Skill that can harden one\u2019s skin by turning it to stone, but if one can obtain a Stone Qilin that has Qilin Dominance Body, they will be a powerful existence among the top-ranking Legendary Companion Beasts.After Wang Lu said that, the stall owner gave her a thumbs up and said, \u201cThis young lady is an expert. She even knows about Qilin Dominance Body. That\u2019s right, Stone Qilin with Qilin Dominance Body are indeed excellent among Legendaries, but despite the numerous Stone Qilin Companion Eggs, the number with Qilin Dominance Body are one in a thousand. They are just too rare.\u201dWith that said, the boss chuckled and pointed at a stone egg on his stall\u2019s counter. \u201cI only have one Stone Qilin Companion Egg. Lady, do you want to try your luck?\u201dWang Lu smiled and shook his head. \u201cAlthough Stone Qilins are strong, they don\u2019t look very cute. It\u2019s not the type I\u2019ll like, so I think I should forget it.\u201dOut of interest, Zhou Wen used his phone\u2019s camera to take a look at the Stone Qilin Companion Egg. Then, he was surprised to discover that the stats of the Stone Qilin egg had the talent skill of Qilin Dominance Body.Is it that coincidental? Zhou Wen found it unbelievable. He carefully took a closer look and indeed, there was the Qilin Dominance Body Primordial Energy Skill. Furthermore, the other stats were pretty good. It was likely one of the most excellent Stone Qilins.\u201cHow much is a Stone Qilin Companion Egg?\u201d Zhou Wen asked.\u201cIf you are paying in cash, 150,000 and you have yourself a deal.\u201d When the boss saw that Zhou Wen was a student of Sunset College, he expected him not to have any high-valued dimensional crystals, so he only reported the price in terms of the League\u2019s currency.Zhou Wen shook his head with a wry smile. It was useless even if he knew that the Stone Qilin egg was an excellent-grade egg. He didn\u2019t have the money to buy it even if he added up all the money in his accounts since it didn\u2019t even reach 10,000.Wang Lu suddenly said, \u201cZhou Wen, if you want this stone Qilin Companion Egg, why don\u2019t you make a deal with me? Do me a favor and I\u2019ll help you buy it.\u201d\u201cWhat deal?\u201d Zhou Wen asked, puzzled.\u201cI saw the video of you killing the word-engraved Demonized General. You were really impressive, so I hope that you can help me complete my homework mission,\u201d said Wang Lu.\u201cDo you still need to spend money to hire someone to help with your homework mission?\u201d Zhou Wen looked at Wang Lu in puzzlement.Wang Lu was a special admissions student at Sunset College, so she was definitely not weak. She could even be said to be an extremely strong person amongst her peers. It was hard to believe that a special admissions student like her, needed help in a homework mission.Wang Lu smiled and said, \u201cIf it\u2019s just a simple homework mission, I naturally don\u2019t need your help. However, I want to get first place in class and even break the records. This requiresyou.\u201d\u201cWhat is your homework mission?\u201d Zhou Wen asked after some thought.\u201cIt\u2019s to kill a Fairy in Lotus Flower Cave with a party of fewer than four people. There is no time limit, but the previous record is 56 seconds,\u201d Wang Lu said.\u201cHow much time do you have left?\u201d Zhou Wen asked again.\u201cThere are still six more days.\u201d Wang Lu counted with her fingers.Zhou Wen nodded and said, \u201cAlright, deal.\u201dWang Lu\u2019s goal was exactly the same as his. Zhou Wen had to go to the Lotus Flower Cave anyway. It was best if he could download Dragon Gate Grotto as a game dungeon; otherwise, he had to enter the Lotus Flower Cave and kill a Fairy himself. He wanted to see if he could get the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill Crystal. Making a trade with Wang Lu in passing wouldn\u2019t affect his plans.Wang Lu was very straightforward. Upon hearing Zhou Wen agree to the trade, she directly bought the Stone Qilin egg for 150,000. She didn\u2019t even blink her eyes or ask for a discount. It delighted the boss so much that he couldn\u2019t even contain his joy.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t stand on ceremony either. After receiving the Stone Qilin egg, he placed it in his backpack.\u201cDo you want to head to the Lotus Flower Cave now?\u201d Zhou Wen asked. He felt extremely responsible when it came to mercenary jobs.\u201cI\u2019d like to make a trip to the Old Dragon Cave first. If you have nothing to do, why don\u2019t we go take a look together?\u201d Wang Lu invited.\u201cI\u2019ll pass. This is my phone number. Call me before going to the Lotus Flower Cave.\u201d Zhou Wen gave Wang Lu his phone number.Wang Lu was somewhat taken aback. It was her first time seeing such an insensitive man as Zhou Wen.This person is really interesting. Wang Lu didn\u2019t mind and turned to head to the Old Dragon Cave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As Wang Lu and the boss said, there were very few Stone Qilins that possessed the Qilin Dominance Body, so he didn\u2019t discover a second one.It was common for students to use their phones to take photos. Zhou Wen\u2019s actions were not out of the blue, nor did he attract the attention of others.The mysterious phone\u2019s functions are impressive, but unfortunately, I\u2019m too poor. Even if I can discover excellent-grade Companion Eggs, I wouldn\u2019t have the money to buy them. Zhou Wen felt vexed.It was impossible to sell the Companion Egg to earn money because although he knew that the Companion Egg was an excellent-grade egg, others didn\u2019t know that. It was impossible for others to buy an unknown Companion Egg at the price of an excellent-grade Companion Beast.The dimensional crystals in the game could not be used, so they could not be exchanged for money.Zhou Wen realized that unless he sacrificed some gaming time, it would be difficult for him to obtain money.\u201cHey there, hey there, you are a freshman this year, right?\u201d As Zhou Wen walked, a stall owner held him back.Zhou Wen realized that the stall owner was about the same age as him and was wearing Sunset College\u2019s uniform. He was also probably a student from Sunset College, so he asked, \u201cI\u2019m a freshman who recently matriculated. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cJunior, you came to Dragon Gate Grotto right after you matriculated. It\u2019s obvious that you are a diligent student. However, dimensional zones are dangerous and you don\u2019t know much about the dimensional zones in Dragon Gate Grotto. Entering like that is extremely dangerous. I have something good here that can allow you to understand the dimensional zone before entering,\u201d the student-like stall owner said.\u201cI\u2019ve already seen all the information available from the school.\u201d Zhou Wen prepared to continue walking forward.Upon seeing Zhou Wen about to leave, the young stall owner hurriedly peddled his service. \u201cJunior, don\u2019t leave. It\u2019s useless just reading that information. Those things are dead after all. No matter how much you read them, it doesn\u2019t imbue you with deeper memory from experiencing it yourself. I have something here that can make you faster than others. You will be able to understand the situation inside deeply before entering.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? Show it to me.\u201d Zhou Wen sized up the young stall owner curiously.Seeing Zhou Wen\u2019s interest, the young stall owner hurriedly took out his cell phone and opened a game app on his phone. Then, an extremely simple game interface appeared.\u201cJunior, this is a mobile game app I created. Don\u2019t write it off just because of its graphics. The map and monsters here are designed according to Dragon Gate Grotto\u2019s actual terrain and dimensional creatures. After playing this mobile game, you will have a full understanding of the Dragon Gate Grotto dimensional zone\u2026\u201dThe graphics of the mobile game were very simple, but this student\u2019s creativity made Zhou Wen\u2019s eyes light up.\u201cSenior, did you make this game yourself?\u201d Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the game interface.\u201cThat\u2019s right. A person\u2019s time and capabilities are limited after all, so it\u2019s a little crude. However, I can guarantee that the content is absolutely real. They are places that I have personally been to. Those dimensional creatures were also seen with my own eyes.\u201d The young stall owner came close to Zhou Wen and said, \u201cJunior, download it. It\u2019s absolutely beneficial for you. You can download it from the official app store. It\u2019s only a hundred bucks.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll download it to take a look. What\u2019s your name, Senior?\u201d Zhou Wen found the game app on the app store according to the name he was told.\u201cMy name is Huang Ji. Junior, you have good taste. Work hard.\u201d Seeing Zhou Wen download his game, Huang Ji was overjoyed.Zhou Wen launched on the game and played. He realized that the controls were smooth and the graphics were crude. The avatars\u2019 and dimensional creatures\u2019 actions were stiff like robots.\u201cSenior Huang, can you improve this game and make it more real?\u201d Zhou Wen asked as he played.\u201cOf course I can. However, that requires a professional team and a large amount of money. I don\u2019t have that much time or money right now, so I can only make it like this for the time being.\u201d Huang Ji said regretfully.\u201cIf given a professional team and funding, what level of development could you push it to?\u201d Zhou Wen asked.He was really interested in this game. If such mobile games became popular in the future, then no one would be suspicious of him if he kept gaming on his phone.Huang Ji said, \u201cThe technology these days is actually very mature. However, gaming is gaming after all. It\u2019s different from real battles. The officials haven\u2019t invested too much in this area. If a person wants to do it, the amount of technical support and resources needed is too much. It\u2019s especially so when it comes to funding. The average person would find it difficult to obtain the huge sums needed. Furthermore, even if one really developed it, they wouldn\u2019t be able to provide precise information to the experts who could venture deep into the dimensional zones. That would make the game meaningless as it would be better to just watch videos.\u201dZhou Wen pondered for a moment before asking, \u201cSenior, if I can obtain a large amount of funds, are you willing to make this game better?\u201d\u201cDo you have money to invest? How much can you invest?\u201d Huang Ji\u2019s eyes lit up as he asked Zhou Wen.\u201cI don\u2019t have money for the time being,\u201d Zhou Wen said as he shrugged.\u201cThen let\u2019s wait until you have money.\u201d Huang Jing was very disappointed.Zhou Wen thought that it made sense. He didn\u2019t have any money, so there was no point in saying anything. All he could do was ask Huang Ji for a contact number before seeking him out when he had money.After separating from Huang Ji, Zhou Wen continued walking forward in search of the tiny palm symbol that might exist. However, he failed to discover it despite nearly reaching Lotus Flower Cave.\u201cZhou Wen, why haven\u2019t you reached Lotus Flower Cave?\u201d Wang Lu called him and urged him to meet up at the entrance.\u201cDidn\u2019t you go to Old Dragon Cave?\u201d Zhou Wen asked casually as he continued walking forward slowly.\u201cI waited inside Old Dragon Cave for quite some time, but I didn\u2019t see any treasure light, nor did I hear any dragon roars. I had no choice but to head to the Lotus Flower Cave now. Come quickly,\u201d Wang Lu said.Zhou Wen wasn\u2019t far from Lotus Flower Cave, so as he walked he carried on searching. Soon, he arrived at the entrance of Lotus Flower Cave and saw Wang Lu waiting for him outside.There were soldiers guarding outside Lotus Flower Cave, preventing ordinary people from entering. Wang Lu took out two passes before leading Zhou Wen inside.\u201cI don\u2019t have the same counselor as you. Is it really fine for me to participate in your homework mission?\u201d Zhou Wen asked while examining the situation inside Lotus Flower Cave.\u201cNo problem, as long as it\u2019s a student from our school,\u201d Wang Lu said nonchalantly before continuing. \u201cThe record for Lotus Flower Cave was maintained by a fourth-year named Huang Ji. We have to break his record this time, so I need to ensure that all the steps are done well. I\u2019ll leave the recording to you later. You must do a good job filming me\u2026\u2019\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the senior that maintained the record?\u201d Zhou Wen asked with a frown.\u201cHuang Ji,\u201d Wang Lu repeated.It couldn\u2019t be the same person, right? Zhou Wen recalled Huang Ji who had used rather pushy sales tactics to promote his game app. He felt that it was probably just two people who shared the same name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead, there was a huge lotus stone sculpture carved on the ceiling. Around the stone statue were many graceful flying fairies.According to the school database, the gigantic lotus flower sculpture was where a dimensional rift was located. Occasionally, a dimensional creature would burrow out of the dimensional rift, looking as though it had flown out of a lotus flower.Dimensional creatures that appeared in the Lotus Flower Cave were currently limited to creatures known as Fairy Beasts. However, they were different from the fairies in the murals. Dimensional creatures called Flying Beasts didn\u2019t look beautiful. Instead, they were like monkeys, so Fairy Beasts were also known as Fairy Monkeys.The Dragon Gate Fairy Skill that Zhou Wen needed was a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal that dropped from Fairy Monkeys. However, there were very few Fairy Monkeys. The chances of it dropping a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal were even lower.Before the dimensional storms happened, the Lotus Flower Cave had been an individual cave, but now, there were many caves that connected to it. Each cave had a lotus flower ceiling and fairies. There were also many sculptures of Buddha, Bodhisattva, Malla, and monks.Lotus Flower Cave had been sealed for a period of time, so it would have accumulated quite a lot of Fairy Beasts. However, the numbers were only enough for special admissions students. Therefore, every special admissions student only had two chances. If they couldn\u2019t obtain their ideal results after killing two Fairy Monkeys, they were not allowed to continue killing them.Zhou Wen followed Wang Lu through the different lotus flower caves and finally found a Fairy Monkey.The Fairy Monkey was somewhat different from what Zhou Wen had imagined. Zhou Wen\u2019s impression of a monkey was an animal with brown fur, but it was actually covered in white fur. Its eyes were bloodshot with a pair of white wings on its back.When the Fairy Monkey noticed Zhou Wen and Wang Lu, it immediately bared its teeth and charged over.\u201cDo you know how to use this? Help me take a good shot. You have to keep up with my speed. Make sure that I look good in it.\u201d Wang Lu handed a special camera to Zhou Wen.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you hired me just to film you?\u201d Zhou Wen said as he took the camera.\u201cThat\u2019s right. What other reason would there be?\u201d Wang Lu said as she charged at Fairy Monkey.Rich people are really willful! Spending 150,000 bucks for a videographer? Zhou Wen couldn\u2019t understand the thought process of rich people.However, he quickly learned why Wang Lu was hiring.The Fairy Monkey\u2019s Speed was extremely fast and it was good at flying. It moved like a ghost in the sky, making it impossible for an ordinary person to keep up with it.Wang Lu changed her movement technique as a pair of butterfly-like wings spread open on her back, allowing her to actually keep up with Fairy Monkey\u2019s speed.If it were any ordinary person to do the filming, they would only be able to shoot from afar. They wouldn\u2019t be able to follow Wang Lu\u2019s figure. Zhou Wen summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and kept filming while riding on its back. He could barely keep up with Wang Lu.Before long, Wang Lu\u2019s saber beam flashed as the Fairy Monkey was struck down. It fell to the ground and died.\u201cHow long did it take?\u201d Wang Lu asked Zhou Wen without looking at the Fairy Monkey\u2019s corpse.\u201cOne minute and five seconds.\u201d Zhou Wen looked at the time of the camera and gave an accurate account of the time.\u201cDid I take that long? It\u2019s still quite a distance from Huang Ji\u2019s record.\u201d Wang Lu frowned slightly. Clearly, her results were not satisfactory.However, Wang Lu only had two chances, so she wasn\u2019t in a rush to find another Fairy Monkey. She called out to Zhou Wen and they left Lotus Flower Cave together.\u201cIf I want to break the record, it looks like I still need a more detailed plan. Let\u2019s end it here for today. Let\u2019s do it again next time.\u201d Wang Lu took back the camera and watched her battle with the Fairy Monkey.\u201cCall me when you need me,\u201d Zhou Wen said.\u201cOf course, you only have to help me do the filming.\u201d Wang Lu had no intention of letting Zhou Wen help her. She had to break Huang Ji\u2019s record alone, or it would be meaningless.After separating from Wang Lu, Zhou Wen continued following the stone stairs and looking around Dragon Gate Grotto, hoping to find the tiny palm symbol.There were many palm imprints within Dragon Gate Grotto. The Fairies, Buddhas, Malla, and Monks had different palm symbols, but they were different from the ones Zhou Wen remembered.Zhou Wen was beginning to wonder if the Dragon Gate Grotto didn\u2019t have any tiny palm symbol when he suddenly felt his mysterious phone vibrate. He took it out and switched on the camera. Soon, he found a tiny hand symbol in some inconspicuous spot on the mountain wall. It then locked onto the symbol.I\u2019ve finally found it! Zhou Wen was overjoyed when he saw the tiny palm symbol.The position of the tiny palm symbol was very inconspicuous. It wasn\u2019t as beautiful and eye-catching as the other Buddha palm imprints. It simply extended its five fingers and held a picture of a sitting Buddha.If one took a closer look, one would realize that the Buddha pattern in the hand was very similar to the biggest Buddha statue at Dragon Gate Grotto. However, it was just several times smaller.Zhou Wen used the camera function and aimed it at the tiny palm symbol. Indeed, a scene was locked onto it.In that case, I can grind Lotus Flower Cave without any qualms. Zhou Wen only wished to obtain Dragon Gate Fairy Skill and then attempt to rush up Fire God Platform.Very quickly, Dragon Gate Grotto was downloaded onto his phone, forming a Buddhist icon.Zhou Wen tapped on the Dragon Gate Grotto\u2019s icon. This time, he didn\u2019t enter the game like before. Instead, many options appeared.Ancient Yang Cave, Myriad Buddha Cave, Old Dragon Cave, Lotus Flower Cave, Inferno Cave. There were plenty of options.After he chose the Lotus Flower Cave, the blood-colored avatar entered the game interface of Lotus Flower Cave. Inside the cave filled with mysterious colors, a gigantic lotus flower sculpture was situated in the middle of the dome, surrounded by symbols of Fairies, Monks, and Malla.A Fairy Monkey burrowed its head out of the stone lotus flower and pounced at the blood-colored avatar while screaming with its teeth bared.Zhou Wen controlled the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to face the Fairy Monkey. Instantly, the two dimensional creatures\u2014which were equally outstanding at flight-began having an aerial battle in Lotus Flower Cave.Finally, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant took nearly ten minutes to slay the Fairy Monkey, but nothing dropped.Zhou Wen continued walking deeper into the Lotus Flower Cave with the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant summoned. He hoped to test it to know how strong it was after becoming a Legendary through the fusion.Seeing a Fairy Monkey charge at him, the lotus flower on the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant\u2019s head suddenly bloomed, revealing a venomous toad. It spewed venom at the Fairy Monkey, instantly drenching it.The Fairy Monkey yelled as it rolled on the ground, its fur and skin corroded as blood gushed out.The Mutated Lotus Flower Ant charged forward without any hesitation and stabbed at the Fairy Monkey with its bone-spiked front claws, impaling its head and chest.47 seconds! Zhou Wen looked at the time. From the beginning of the battle to the system\u2019s indication of the Fairy Beast\u2019s death, it took a total of 47 seconds. He had already broken Huang Ji\u2019s record.The Mutated Lotus Flower Ant is really powerful! Zhou Wen was delighted. The more he looked at it, the more adorable it looked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It wasn\u2019t able to keep using Primordial Energy Skills. However, even if it didn\u2019t use any Primordial Energy Skills, the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant and the Silver-Winged Flying Ant could easily kill a Fairy Monkey.Fairy Monkeys often produced dimensional crystals, but they were mostly Speed Crystals. Occasionally, it would drop some Primordial Energy Crystals, allowing Zhou Wen to replenish the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant\u2019s Primordial Energy.Now, Zhou Wen believed that the Primordial Energy Crystals were rather useful. He only had two Companion Beasts at the moment, but he already needed plenty of Primordial Energy Crystals to replenish his Primordial Energy. In the future, with more Companion Beasts, the Primordial Energy Crystals would be even more useful.Unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing like a storage bag in the game. Otherwise, I could store up the Primordial Energy Crystals and use them when needed. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about it, he heard a chime.After a Fairy Monkey was killed, a dimensional crystal dropped. Zhou Wen took a closer look and saw that it was a crystal with the words Fairy Monkey on it. He was delighted.Fairy Monkeys typically only had one Primordial Energy Skill, which was Dragon Gate Fairy Skill. He had never heard of there being a second Primordial Energy Skill. Now that a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal dropped, it was definitely Dragon Gate Fairy Skill.Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to pick it up.Wisps of white light floated out of the crystal and drilled into the blood-colored avatar\u2019s body. Zhou Wen also felt a strange power surge from his phone into his body. It opened up a strange aura circulation path that allowed him to feel light as though he could fly at any moment.As Zhou Wen had expected, this was the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill\u2019s Primordial Energy Skill Crystal. The information regarding it also surged into Zhou Wen\u2019s brain at the same time, giving him deep knowledge about the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill.\u2018Attained Dragon Gate Fairy Skill (Rank 6)\u2019With Dragon Gate Fairy Skill, I can attempt to storm Fire God Platform. Zhou Wen was delighted. As he was about to leave Dragon Gate Grotto, he suddenly saw a dimensional creature burrow out of the lotus flower situated at the Lotus Flower Cave\u2019s ceiling.Zhou Wen originally imagined that a Fairy Monkey had appeared and planned on killing it before leaving, but upon careful inspection, he realized that it wasn\u2019t a Fairy Monkey, but a female fairy with fluttering clothes.The fairy had a graceful figure, and her silk ribbons were dancing in the air. Although she did not have any wings, she was able to spiral and fly in midair, completely defying the laws of physics.Is this a real Fairy? Zhou Wen looked enviously at the beautiful Fairy. There was some discomfort using wings to fly, so it was better to fly freely like a Fairy.The Fairy spun a few times before flying towards the blood-colored avatar.Zhou Wen hurriedly controlled the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant and the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to charge forward in battle. However, the beautiful Fairy waved her hand gently, sending a ribbon to sweep over like a white python. Even the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s Silver Wing Flash failed to dodge the ribbon that resembled a living creature. The blood-colored avatar and the two Companion Beasts were soon coiled together.The Fairy in the air pulled and tightened the grip on the ribbon, rupturing their bodies and causing the game screen to instantly darken.What a terrifying Fairy! Zhou Wen marveled inwardly.He didn\u2019t continue gaming as he put away his phone. He planned on returning to his dorm before dripping blood and making a trip to the Fire God Platform. He wanted to see if he could rush up Fire God Platform with a Rank 6 Dragon Gate Fairy Skill and see what was engraved on the stone monument.After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen eagerly launched the Ancient Imperial City dungeon. He dripped his blood to be reborn and rode the Silver-Winged Flying Ant towards the Fire God Platform.This time, Zhou Wen was fully prepared. He rushed up the stairs on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s back, dodging all the firebirds without killing them. The higher he charged, the more firebirds appeared.Previously, Zhou Wen could only rely on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s flight, but now, the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill had also given him a pretty good ability that allowed him to hover in midair.Just as a firebird was about to hit the blood-colored avatar, the blood-colored avatar leaped up in the air and spiraled in midair like a giant bird. It circled around the firebird and avoided its attack before landing on the Silver-Winged Flying Ant\u2019s back.Although the Dragon Gate Fairy Skill didn\u2019t allow for true flight, it could allow one to hang in midair for a short period of time, making one look cool and elegant.Boom!With the blood-colored avatar rushing past the furthest he had reached last time, the Fire God Platform\u2019s flames surged into the sky as flocks of firebird-like clouds descended upon him, their numbers inestimable.I\u2019m dead! Zhou Wen knew that no matter how agile he was, it was impossible for him to charge through the dense flock of firebirds. All he could do was try his best.The lotus flower on top of the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant\u2019s head exploded like a bomb, turning into a rain of blood that killed many nearby firebirds. Taking the moment when the pressure of the firebirds lessened, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant charged into the sky and broke through the firebirds\u2019 encirclement.However, there were too many firebirds. They immediately gathered together and blocked their path.The Silver-Winged Flying Ant spread its wings and charged towards the firebirds, colliding with the firebirds at the head of the flock. As for the blood-colored avatar, it leaped up under Zhou Wen\u2019s control and circled above the sky like an eagle.One firebird after another was dodged by the blood-colored avatar as it reached an unprecedented height. Through the holes in between the firebird flock, he saw half of the stone monument.Zhou Wen\u2019s sharp eyes immediately saw that the largest three ancient characters on the stone monument were \u201cAncient Imperial Sutra.\u201d And when he saw the three words clearly, a ball of fire seemed to rise within him.However, the moment he saw those three words, the blood-colored avatar was inundated by the flock of firebirds. The game screen quickly turned black.It\u2019s impossible for me to rush up with a technique that imbues me with alacrity. However, I can now see a part of the stone monument. If my movement skills are better, I can hold on for a longer period of time. I\u2019ll then be able to memorize parts of the monument\u2019s content. This way, I don\u2019t have to reach the peak. Zhou Wen held his phone as he thought.He felt that this idea was feasible, but his movement skills were still lacking. He wanted to last longer and see more of the content, so he needed a higher ranked movement skill.After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to continue grinding the Lotus Flower Cave. Peeking at the Ancient Imperial Sutra could wait until he first grinded a Rank 9 Dragon Gate Fairy Skill.While Zhou Wen was trying his best to grind Fairy Monkeys, the first homework mission that Wang Fei assigned finally came to an end. Although some students were unable to complete their homework mission, they were not expelled. They only had some homework points deducted.Wang Fei convened a meeting with all her students and announced her second homework mission. It was for them to visit Mount Laojun to look at the Wordless Monument.When the mission was announced, Wang Fei gave Zhou Wen a meaningful glance\u2014this mission had originally been prepared for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhou Wen originally didn\u2019t wish to go that far, but he had to complete the school\u2019s homework missions. Otherwise, he couldn\u2019t graduate so it was practically compulsory.As for Li Xuan, he was very excited as he sat on the bus and continually explained Mount Laojun to Zhou Wen.\u201cA place like Mount Laojun can be said to be the safest dimensional zone. Although there are many dimensional creatures, they won\u2019t attack humans without reason. As long as you don\u2019t annoy them, there\u2019s no danger at Mount Laojun. The only thing to take note of is that our homework mission is to visit the Wordless Monument. It\u2019s also known as Unwinding Monument. No matter how strong a person\u2019s will is, they can\u2019t look at it for more than half an hour or things will turn fun\u2026\u201dZhou Wen sat by the window, grinding the Ant Nest dungeon while listening to Li Xuan\u2019s detailed explanation of Mount Laojun.\u201cWhat\u2019s so fun?\u201d Zhou Wen asked.\u201cThat thing is very sinister. Although it doesn\u2019t kill people, it will make people excited and make them constantly wish to do something,\u201d said Li Xuan with a chuckle.Mount Laojun was in Luoyang, so it wasn\u2019t long before the bus arrived.It was different from what Zhou Wen had imagined. Mount Laojun wasn\u2019t too tall, but it had many peaks with pine and cypress trees winding around them. There were ancient buildings erected above the mountain, making it a picturesque scene.From afar, Mount Laojun looked like a classic ink painting of landscapes.Wang Fei did a headcount before taking the students up the mountain.There were rabbits, squirrels, and other small critters on the mountain, as well as groups of immortal cranes flying in the clouds. They showed no fear of humans and only curiously observed the students from Sunset College.Zhou Wen kept searching for the palm symbol, but he hadn\u2019t discovered one. However, he wasn\u2019t worried as the mysterious phone could automatically lock onto the tiny palm symbol if it was close enough.The most mysterious thing about Mount Laojun was the Golden Peak. There were many mysterious ancient buildings there, but no human could ascend to the Golden Peak.Legend had it that people once saw countless animals crawling out of the mountain, such as snakes, worms, rats and insects. The black mass of creatures covered the entire Mount Laojun as they prostrated for three full days in front of the Golden Peak before dispersing.It was almost taboo to spill blood on the land around Mount Laojun. There was once someone who attempted to carry out a massacre and kill those gentle dimensional creatures.Just as that person had killed a dimensional creature that resembled a white rabbit, his expression changed drastically for some reason. He turned around and ran down the mountain like a madman.When his friend went to look for him the next day, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to recognize him if not for his clothes and personal items.That person was covered in rabbit fur, and his mouth had turned into three lines like a rabbit. His eyes were red and he was sprawled on the ground eating grass like a rabbit. He couldn\u2019t be stopped from doing so no matter how hard his friend tried. He became a lunatic for the rest of his life.Since then, no one dared to kill on Mount Laojun. Even the spilling of blood was taboo.Legend had it that an Epic expert didn\u2019t believe in the rumors and started a killing spree on Mount Laojun, but the outcome was equally tragic.This was all the knowledge taught in school, and Zhou Wen didn\u2019t know how true it was. However, as he walked up Mount Laojun, he indeed felt very serene. There seemed to be a magical power here that calmed one\u2019s mind.Wang Fei led the students to a platform on the mountainside and pointed to a stone monument at the end of the platform, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s the legendary Unwinding Monument. Although it doesn\u2019t have a word on it, it has magical powers. Your homework mission is to sit in front of the Unwinding Monument for half an hour and stare at it. Not one second less and not one second more.\u201dThe stone monument was only two to three meters tall. It looked old and dilapidated, and there was nothing out of the ordinary about it. It stood by the edge of the mountainside, looking like it accompanied the rosy clouds of dawn. Its solitude had an indescribable feeling to it as though just staring at it would placate any irascible feelings.\u201cLine up, ten people in a row. Sit down in front of Unwinding Monument. Wear the sunglasses I gave you. Listen to my instructions before taking them off. Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, don\u2019t just stand at the back. Come to the first row.\u201d Wang Fei arranged for a group of students to sit in front of Unwinding Monument, and, when she saw Zhou Wen and Li Xuan at the back, she immediately called them to the front.The closer one was to the Unwinding Monument, the stronger the effects. Wang Fei had steeled her heart to help Zhou Wen regain his drive.Zhou Wen didn\u2019t mind where he sat. Anyway, there wasn\u2019t any risk looking at the Unwinding Monument as long as one didn\u2019t exceed the time limit.The only things that left Zhou Wen a little disappointed were his failure to find the tiny palm symbol, and that the mysterious phone hadn\u2019t vibrated.Could it be that Mount Laojun\u2019s dimensional zone is at the Golden Peak? Zhou Wen looked at the mountaintop as he secretly made plans.Seeing how Zhou Wen was still looking around, Wang Fei thought to herself, After you look at the Wordless Monument, you won\u2019t be as half-hearted as you are now.\u201cAlright, take note. Take off your sunglasses. Everyone is to begin looking at the Wordless Monument. The time limit is half an hour. If you get up before half an hour, it will be a failure and you will have to look at it for another half an hour.\u201d Wang Fei wore the sunglasses without any intention of taking them off. All she did was start the stopwatch in her hand.These sunglasses were specially made. Wearing them to look at the Wordless Monument decreased its effects significantly. However, one still couldn\u2019t keep looking at it because with prolonged staring at it, even the sunglasses were useless.Zhou Wen and the rest of the students took off their sunglasses as their gazes landed on the Wordless Monument.It was strange. Initially, many students felt nervous. However, after looking at the Wordless Monument, their nervous feelings vanished instantly. They relaxed entirely and their spirits became extremely tranquil.However, this feeling of tranquility became a little odd as time passed.Although one\u2019s mind remained calm, energy seemed to surge in their bodies. It made the students feel like they were filled with Primordial Energy. They yearned to immediately get up and begin carrying out a series of boxing moves or fight someone. This irascible feeling that came from within stood in strong contrast with the tranquility their minds generated.The students naturally didn\u2019t dare to stand up. They had only sat down for less than three minutes, so standing up now would mean the failure of their homework mission. All they could do was sit there and bear with it.This feeling was like a person who was hyperactive but had to sit there and not move an inch. It was not something a person could usually understand.Zhou Wen also felt the same stirring feelings, but he only felt them a little bit at the beginning. Just as his body began to stir, the Lost Immortal Sutra that was circulating at a normal speed gradually slowed down. It made Zhou Wen\u2019s body feel strange as the irascible feelings slowly vanished.Why is this happening? Zhou Wen was alarmed. The last time the Lost Immortal Sutra did such a thing was when he was reading the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
