If we just defeat her, we can go back to our normal lives!Countless players were filled with newfound determination, and their hope was rekindled.For a day.That\u2019s how long it took for hope to become despair.On the day that the Frost Queen walked out of the gate, the southern Pacific froze over with a flick of her wrist. Everyone\u2019s determination froze along with it.There were only five people who weren\u2019t shaken.These top players took a plane to Antarctica.\u201cLet\u2019s catch that Frost Queen.\u201dAll for the sake of what others thought impossible.***Final dungeon, Antarctica.The Queen\u2019s Nest, 2nd floor.The five players stood in front of the stairs leading to the next floor. A message popped up.[Only one person may go up the stairs.]\u201cAre you fucking kidding me? After coming all this way?\u201d A muscular man stomped the floor with a loud bang as he swore.\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean that the other four will die here?From the moment they entered the Nest, they\u2019d been chased by the Frost Queen\u2019s breath. There was only one way to avoid getting frozen by the poisonous breath: to keep climbing. This meant that only one person would ascend and that the remaining four would freeze to death.\u201c\u2026There\u2019s only two minutes left until the breath catches up. Let\u2019s choose quickly,\u201d the Great Mage Skaya said as she looked to the others.\u201cI think Specter should go. He has the best chance of killing the Frost Queen.\u201d\u201cI could kill her too.\u201d\u201cAnd who would win in a fight between you two?\u201c\u2026Tsk. Touche.\u201d The muscular giant raised his hands in surrender.The man wearing a cowboy hat, Gilbert Green nodded in agreement. \u201cI agree. With the exception of Specter, our odds against the Frost Queen aren\u2019t too great.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s true.\u201dHe was right. Rahmadat Kahli had great physical strength, but that wouldn\u2019t be a match for the Frost Queen. If she so much as breathed or raised her hand, the entire area around her would freeze.It was the same for Tenmei Mio, who was treating/protecting Japan. She and Skaya already had their hands full guarding against the Frost Queen\u2019s approach from the rear guard.\u201cThen it\u2019s settled.\u201dThe four of them turned to look at Specter. He wore a black mask.\u201c\u2026Are you sure you won\u2019t regret this?\u201d A dry voice spoke from behind the mask. Rahmadat shrugged.\u201cWe probably will. A whole fucking lot. But what can we do? You have the best chance of succeeding.\u201d\u201cAlright. Then, I\u2019ll kill her before her breath reaches us.\u201d\u201cNo way. That\u2019s impossible.\u201d Tenmei Mio shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t rush because of us. Lie in wait until you\u2019re sure you can kill her.\u201d\u201cMio\u2019s right. It\u2019s impossible to kill her in two minutes. If you rush in like that, you\u2019ll actually give her the initiative.\u201d Rahmadat and Skaya nodded in agreement.\u201cYou hear that? Don\u2019t be impatient, and kill her properly. That\u2019s what it\u2019ll take to be the one that goes up.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about the rest of us, but you can definitely do it.Specter looked at his faithful teammates. If he was the one that was left behind, could he cheer them on so casually?\u201c\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t.Biting his lip under his mask, he gave a heavy nod.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll see you again. I promise.\u201dHis teammates laughed and told him that they got it, that he should go.With that empty promise, Specter ran up the stairs, skipping multiple steps at a time.He didn\u2019t look back. Because he couldn\u2019t afford to at the time..CrashNot even when the stair crumbled behind him and he couldn\u2019t hear their voices anymore. His eyes were fixed on the top of the stairs.At that moment, he reached the top.\u201cSo you\u2019ve finally come to my grave.\u201d[The final boss for the area Earth, the Frost Queen, has appeared.][Upon her defeat, safe zones will be added.]In the middle of the room, the Frost Queen sat on a frozen throne. Her legs were crossed, her demeanor elegant and aloof.But Specter wasn\u2019t fooled by her alluring appearance. The aura that she radiated threatened to freeze everything around her.Shing.The sound of the weapon being drawn seemed to lower the temperature. Specter spoke in a flat voice.\u201cFive years.\u201d That\u2019s how long the world had been changed to become like a game. \u201cLet\u2019s end this.\u201d\u201cEnd\u2026 this?\u201dThe Frost Queen burst out in laughter, covering her lips with her slender fingers. \u201cAhahaha! You really don\u2019t know anything about this world.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m only here to kill you, why would I need to know such things?\u201dWoooong!Darkness surged around him, and the ice started to fill with black. The best player in the world, Specter Seo Jun-ho, opened his mouth.\u201cAll I need to confirm is your death and the end of this game.\u201dDarkness and ice clashed, creating a massive explosion.***\u201cHaa, haa\u2026\u201d At the end of a long battle, the Frost Queen let out a violent cough. Her complexion was pale, but a smile teased at the edge of her lips.\u201cI had fun.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201dWith a sullen voice, an exhausted Seon Jun-ho swung his broken sword with as much force as he could muster.Slice!The Frost Queen\u2019s head was no different from other living organisms. It was cut through cleanly.At the same time, a message rang in his ears.[Congratulations! The boss for area Earth, the Frost Queen, has been defeated.][You have received the title \u201cThe One who Opens Spring\u201d.][Safe zones have been created on area Earth.]\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Seon Jun-ho let out a long breath.He\u2019d done it.It had been 5 years since the world had become hell. He\u2019d finally exacted revenge on the monsters who\u2019d stolen his normal life.\u201cMother, father.\u201dThinking of his parents, Seon Jun-ho looked at the digital clock with nervous eyes.His teeth dug into his lips, bringing a metallic taste to his mouth.\u201c\u2026Shit. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201dFight time: 76:48:16.His comrades had already frozen long ago.\u201cI\u2026 I couldn\u2019t keep my promise.\u201d He looked at the ground in shame and exhaustion.In that moment, a hellhound crawled out from the ground and started chewing at the Frost Queen\u2019s body.Crunch, crunch!After it finished its scrumptious meal, the hellhound spit something out before it disappeared.A nucleus.It was a power source some of the monsters used. It was also a new energy source that had recently been in the spotlight.\u201cMy friends sacrificed themselves\u2026\u201dRoll.With a horrified expression, Seo Jun-ho reached down to pick it up.\u201cFor something like this.\u201dBut when he picked it up, a dizzying amount of messages appeared.[Warning! You have started to absorb the Frost Queen\u2019s nucleus.][Absorption percentage 0.001%\u2026][Because of the cold it radiates, the Frost Queen\u2019s nucleus will cause your stats to drop to level one.][Strength 217->21][Stamina 201->24][Speed 225->26][Magic 183->18]\u201cWhat?!\u201d Startled, Seon Jun-ho started to drop the nucleus, but it had already started to absorb through his skin.Frost started to spread on his skin and he felt his blood flow and his heartbeat slow. The horrible chill filled his veins and his body. His joints went cold, and his chin shook uncontrollably, causing his teeth to chatter.\u201cThis\u2026 crazy dungeon\u2026\u201dSeon Jun-ho felt his consciousness slip, and froze.***Someone asked: \u201cEveryone, what\u2019s on November 11th?\u201dIn the past, they would have answered Pepero Day. But the answer changed in the year 2024.\u201cHuh? That\u2019s the Day of Heroes.\u201d\u201cIs that even a question?\u201dThe Day of Heroes. After 2024, November 11th became the day that the five heroes saved the world. From the middle of October to the beginning of November, tickets to Korea sold like crazy.There was a simple reason. On that one day, the frozen statues of the 5 heroes were put on display at the Seoul History Museum.\u201cThe result of such a world that was overrun with monsters\u2026\u201dThousands of people sat in their seats, listening to the suit-clad curator on stage. She spoke in Korean, but thanks to the live translation system, there was no one who couldn\u2019t understand.\u201c\u2026In 2024, a monster that humanity could not quell appeared.\u201dA kindergartener wearing a yellow hat raised their hand and yelled. \u201cThe Frost Queen! I heard from my teacher!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Our young friend is smart,\u201d the curator said with a smile. \u201cThe Frost Queen was a monster that could freeze the southern Pacific with one wave of her hand. While everyone else lost hope, five people had hope in their hearts as they traveled to Antarctica.\u201d\u201cThe Nest Attack Team?\u201d\u201cRight again. These legendary players achieved the most important thing in history.\u201dThe lights on the stage flicked off.The curator swallowed as she looked at the audience. She pulled her hand back. The curtain was pulled aside, and five frozen statues stood behind a reinforced glass wall.\u201cToday, we call them the Five Heroes. Please be respectful.\u201dCameras flashed all over. The audience was captivated by the statues. Some closed their eyes and said a prayer of thanks.\u201cThanks to the Five Heroes, the Frost Queen was defeated and numerous safe zones appeared. Additionally\u2026\u201d As the curator launched into a deep explanation, the kindergartener pointed, eyes wide.\u201cT-the statue moved!\u201d\u201cOho, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s incorrect.\u201d The curator smiled and shook her head. \u201cThe temperature behind the wall is regulated 24/7 so there won\u2019t be\u2026\u201dCrack. The curator paused at the peculiar sound and turned around. She cautiously took a step forward to check the statues beyond the wall. The sound had come from the direction of Specter\u2019s mask-wearing statue. She let her gaze linger for a moment, but the statues had been fine for 25 years.\u201cW-well, as I was saying. There wouldn\u2019t be any problems\u2026\u201d She\u2019d barely gotten the words out of her mouth when one of the statues shattered and a person fell to the ground.\u201cUgh\u2026euh\u2026\u201d System filled his eyes and ears with messages.[Absorption percentage 99.9999%\u2026][Absorption percentage 100%.][Congratulations.

The world hadn\u2019t changed much, so he wasn\u2019t exactly shocked. He\u2019d first wondered if it was something like a hidden-camera prank, but there was too much evidence against that.\u201cMy muscles are gone. They\u2019ve completely atrophied.\u201d Seo Jun-ho stared down at his body, dumbfounded. His bones poked through. The body he\u2019d trained vigorously for 5 years was gone, just like that.\u201cSpecter-nim. The President of the Players\u2019 Association has come to see you.\u201dWherever he went, the top doctors of the world spoke to him with their two hands clasped together*. (T/N a sign of respect/hierarchy)That was the least they could do to show respect to the savior of humanity. Seo Jun-ho wasn\u2019t uncomfortable with this, because this is how he\u2019d always been treated.\u201cIs the President someone I know?\u201d If he didn\u2019t, he would tell them to leave. It hadn\u2019t even been a day since he woke up. He didn\u2019t want to be bothered already.But the doctor said something surprising. \u201cYes. The President spoke casually and said you were their friend.\u201d\u201cFriend\u2026? Huh.\u201d There weren\u2019t many who he considered a friend. \u201cWell, I suppose I\u2019ll know once we meet.\u201dSeo Jun-ho turned to look out into Seoul, as if he was amazed. \u201cI suppose the world really has changed.\u201d There were many more skyscrapers, and magic had been used to get rid of the fine dust pollution. More than that, there wasn\u2019t a single gate in Seoul.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 the peaceful world that we wanted.\u201d Thinking of his comrades, Seo Jun-ho closed his eyes and smiled faintly. \u201c\u2026What will I do now?\u201dThe world had changed when he was 20, and he\u2019d become a player and cleared gates. The only thing he knew how to do was to hunt monsters.\u201cI guess I\u2019m unemployed now.\u201d It wasn\u2019t an unpleasant thought. With an unburdened heart, he took off his mask. \u201cHup!\u201dThe doctors covered their mouths, swallowing screams.Besides his Korean nationality, Specter was a mystical figure whose name, age, and face were unknown. But to take off his mask so casually?One of the doctors spoke with a shaky voice.\u201cW-why\u2026 why did you take off your mask?\u201d\u201cHuh? I don\u2019t need it anymore.\u201d Seo Jun-ho said this as he twirled his trademark mask in his hands. \u201cThe world is peaceful now.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 I\u2026\u201d A shadow crossed over the doctors\u2019 faces. Seo Jun-ho noticed the shift.\u201cWhat\u2019s with your reactions?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe doctors couldn\u2019t say anything, and only glanced at each other.\u201cI\u2019ll explain.\u201d As the door opened, a put-together man stepped in. Upon seeing his face, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes went wide. He had a few wrinkles now, but it was a face he would never forget.\u201cAre\u2026 are you Deok-gu?\u201d\u201cPfft.\u201d The doctors turned their heads away as they held back their laughs.\u201cAhem!\u201d The man turned to the doctors, his face slightly red. \u201cI want to speak to him in private.\u201d\u201cYes, President.\u201dAfter the doctors trickled out, the President pulled up a chair and took a seat. His eyes started to water.\u201c\u2026Jun-ho, you still look exactly the same.\u201d Even after 25 years, his friend was exactly the same. He was at the age when his skin started to wrinkle and his stomach started to stick out, but he still looked exactly as he did when he was younger.On the other hand, Jun-ho\u2019s healthy body had deteriorated to be sickeningly skinny. The lingering doubt faded, and the President bit his lower lip.\u201cWow. That voice. You really are Deok-gu.\u201d It had become rougher with age, but it was the voice of his childhood friend Shim Deok-gu.Seo Jun-ho stared at his friend who\u2019d become a middle-aged man. He started laughing as he noticed something.\u201cHey, look! I told you that M-shape was a sign of balding! You said it wasn\u2019t!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say after\u2026!\u201d He\u2019d gotten choked up in the moment, and Shim Deok-gu let out a sigh. \u201cHoo, that\u2019s right\u2026 The Seo Jun-ho I knew was always like this. What kind of heartfelt reunion\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you really expect that?\u201d Seo Jun-ho was still gripping his stomach and laughing. \u201c25 years\u2026 Pfft, it\u2019s been 25 years but there\u2019s still no cure for balding?\u201d\u201c\u2026The wigs are good. You can\u2019t tell the difference. I didn\u2019t wear one today because I was in a rush.\u201d\u201cReally? Then show me next time.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised.\u201d Those two really did like to speak of such trivial things. Without a moment to breathe, they launched into another topic. Shim Deok-gu would start talking, and Seo Jun-ho would peel clementines from the basket* and chime in. A few hours passed like that. (T/N In Korea, people are often given big baskets of fruit as get-well gifts)Shim Deok-gu smiled fondly. \u201cYou rascal, you\u2019re exactly the same.\u201dEven after 25 years, the two friends who were born and raised together were still the same.Deok-gu had actually been nervous on the way to the hospital. He was scared to show Jun-ho the \u201cadult\u201d he\u2019d become. But they were still talking as freely as before.\u201cYou\u2019re the same too. Though your stomach sticks out a bit now.\u201d\u201c\u2026You try getting old.\u201dSeo Jun-ho spoke to a bashful-looking Shim Deok-gu. \u201cNow that you\u2019re not so tense anymore, tell me why those doctors reacted like that.\u201d\u201cAh, um.\u201d There was no more avoiding the topic. Shim Deok-gu swallowed. \u201c\u2026The moment you guys defeated the Frost Queen, all the players received the same message.\u201d He looked out the window as if recalling the memory.[Congratulations. The Frost Queen has been defeated.][Safe zones will now appear on the area Earth.]The whole world rejoiced. They didn\u2019t need to fight anymore. They could live peacefully like before. Players and non-players alike cried tears of joy. But the message didn\u2019t stop there.[A dimensional elevator has been unlocked in the Pacific area.][The 2nd floor Frontier Area has opened.][The max level in the Frontier will be raised from 80 to 120.][Stay strong until you reach the last floor.]\u201c\u2026.What?\u201d\u201cFuck, what kind of shit is this?!\u201d\u201c2nd floor? So it didn\u2019t end with the Frost Queen?\u201dPeople fell into a panic. There was nothing else they could do. They\u2019d thought it was the end, but it was actually only the beginning..Strong players, association presidents, and politicians from all over the world held a big conference. During the days it was held, the players kept receiving the same message.[The only way to stop Earth\u2019s destruction is to go up the floor.][The only way to stop Earth\u2019s destruction is to go up the floor.][The only way to stop Earth\u2019s destruction is to go up the floor.]Earth\u2019s destruction. Frightened by the ominous phrase, the people came to a decision.For now, they would have to send a scouting team to the newly opened 2nd floor.\u201c\u2026So?\u201d Seo Jun-ho asked this in a low voice. Hearing the anger and dejection in his voice, Shim Deok-gu carried on.\u201cThe 2nd floor was a land of opportunity. It had abundant resources, new magic, and new techniques. We were able to harvest a great amount of resources and knowledge from there, and it\u2019s the reason Earth is in such an abundant state today.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I wanted to know\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s 10 floors in total.\u201d Shim Deok-gu cut him off.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s what you wanted to know, right? The dimensional elevator has buttons for floors 1 to 10.\u201d\u201cSo if there are only 10 floors\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho relaxed a bit. He and his teammates had taken 5 years to clear the first floor and defeat the Frost Queen.\u00a0And if it\u2019s been 25 years since then\u20262, 3, 4, 5, 6. So they should have at least reached the 7th floor by now. But he didn\u2019t expect even that much.At the time, the difference in skill between my team and the other players was huge.\u00a0There had been an immeasurable difference between them. That was why only five people went to Antarctica. Anyone else would only be a burden.\u00a0And since the difficulty would have increased\u2026 Realistically, they\u2019ve probably only reached the 5th floor or so.Finishing his calculations, Seo Jun-ho looked back at Shim Deok-gu. \u201cSo what floor are we on?\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dShim Deok-gu opened and closed his mouth a few times before squeezing his eyes shut. Feeling nervous, Seo Jun-ho pressed him on.\u201cHey\u2026 why won\u2019t you say anything?\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dThere was a long silence.Shim Deok-gu let out a long sigh and opened his eyes.\u201cIn the past 25 years, all we\u2019ve cleared is the 2nd floor.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dUpon hearing that, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s mind went blank. All he did was lay on his fluffy bed and stare at the ceiling. Finally, he spoke again.\u201cShit.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t have anything to say.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years, 25. How could you only clear the 2nd floor?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m making excuses, but there\u2019s a reason for this.\u201d\u201cHoo, alright.\u201d Having sat up, Seo Jun-ho stared expectantly. \u201cWell, say it. If anything, I\u2019m curious what kind of stupid reason it is.\u201d\u201c\u2026The Frost Queen\u2019s nucleus.\u201d As soon as the words left his mouth, Seo Jun-ho started to tremble. Not noticing, Shim Deok-gu continued.\u201cThe 3rd floor resembles a volcanic region. Most players can\u2019t even withstand the environment. We decided that it\u2019s impossible to launch an attack and searched for any possible means to withstand the heat.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an altar where the lava originates. If we freeze it with the Frost Queen\u2019s nucleus, the environment will change.\u201d\u201cD-did you find it?\u201d\u201cHoo\u2026\u201d Shim Deok-gu hung his head and covered his face with his hands. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed. We searched the Nest countless times, but we couldn\u2019t find it.\u201dOf course they hadn\u2019t. Because it had been absorbed by Seo Jun-ho.\u201cI, uh\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho rolled his neck and stretched his arms. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else you could have done. I guess it was just bad luck.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 you understand? Even after we wasted all your efforts?\u201d Shim Deok-gu looked touched.\u00a0I didn\u2019t notice when we were younger, but\u2026 was he always this mature?\u00a0At the same time, the two friends felt embarrassed for judging the other too quickly.The Seo Jun-ho he knew would have thrown a fit\u2026 but he currently had a pure look in his eyes that didn\u2019t hide his guilt.\u201cEveryone makes mistakes. We have to understand each other.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you feel that way.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSo if I also make a mistake, you have to be understanding, alright?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Shim Deok-gu looked at Seo Jun-ho warmly.Quietly avoiding his eyes, Seo Jun-ho pondered to himself.\u00a0Ah\u2026 How can I tell him without being scolded too much?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Feeling hungry, Shim Deok-gu checked the time and spoke.\u201cWow, it\u2019s already this late. Aren\u2019t you hungry? Wanna grab something to eat?\u201d Seo Jun-ho shook his head after a moment.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Rather than that, I have a favor to ask.\u201d\u201cA favor? What is it?\u201cI heard the Seoul History Museum is super famous.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dHe meant that he wanted to go visit. Shim Deok-gu knew why.\u00a0This rascal, he misses his teammates.\u00a0Actually, he knew that he\u2019d ask and had already made preparations.Even though he acted aloof, he treasured his friends as much as himself.Slide.Shim Deok-gu pulled out a bracelet and placed it on the bed. Seo Jun-ho blinked.\u201cWow, technology sure has come a long way. Is this the famous Seoul History Museum?\u201d\u201cVery funny. This is Vita. It\u2019s similar to a computer. Live interpretation, calling, internet, maps, payment\u2026 You can basically do everything with it.\u201d\u201cSounds fun. So why are you giving this to me?\u201d As soon as he put it on his wrist, Shim Deok-gu started laughing.\u201cI\u2019m going down to the first floor by the stairs. Reporters, politicians and players are crowding the area so it\u2019ll be more bothersome for you to come with me.\u201d\u201cYou can just tell me to take an elevator. Why make it so complicated?\u201d\u201cAhem. You can make most payments with Vita, but use this if you need cash.\u201d Deok-gu pulled out a big stack of bills.\u201cHey, this feels kind of weird. I feel like I\u2019m getting allowance from an ahjussi.\u201d\u201cShut up. If you go to the back of the museum, there\u2019s a door with restricted access.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the password?\u201d\u201cI registered your iris.\u201d\u201cHoo, you\u2019ve gotten better at these things.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years. I wouldn\u2019t be the president if I didn\u2019t improve.\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked at his friend with a new light.\u201cCome back to the hospital when you\u2019re done. The doctors want to monitor your condition for a while.\u201d\u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, then.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dShim Deok-gu stood up to leave. But before he stepped out, he looked back three times.\u201cWhy do you keep looking back?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just. I still can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re back.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten weirder with age. Hurry up and leave.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201dDeok-gu left the room while laughing as Seo Jun-ho threw a pillow at him.\u201c\u2026I should get ready too.\u201dHe took off his patient gown and wore his clothes, which had been cleaned. There wasn\u2019t a huge difference in fashion in 2049.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I was worried that tights or something would become popular.\u201d Well, it was obvious from looking at Deok-gu\u2019s clean suit and the doctors\u2019 gown that not much had changed. He left his room and got on the elevator to the first floor.By the stairwell, Deok-gu was surrounded by a huge crowd.Click! Click!\u201cHow is Specter\u2019s health?\u201d\u201cIs there nothing wrong with him?\u201d\u201cWas it really Specter?\u201d\u201cKeeping his identity secret is an abuse of power by the Player Association! The world has the right to know!\u201d\u201cWhen will you be holding a press conference?\u201dHe answered calmly, not looking the least bit nervous. The look on his face was familiar as he answered questions with confidence. He really was a good president.\u201cYou rascal. Good job.\u201dSeo Jun-ho left the hospital with a small smile on his face.There were numerous taxis at the station in front of the hospital, but the driver\u2019s seats were empty.\u201cWhat? Did they all go out for dinner?\u201d Seo Jun-ho crouched by the sidewalk, waiting for the drivers to return. A moment later, a sweating businessman ran forward.\u201cJeez, so much to do.\u201dHe took a seat in one of the empty taxis. It took off.\u201c\u2026Huh? I\u2019m sure there wasn\u2019t anyone in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201dWatching the taxi drive off, Seo Jun-ho inched toward another. He carefully opened the door and took a seat. As soon as he did, an automated voice spoke.\u2014Please choose your destination.\u201c\u2026Seoul History Museum.\u201d\u2014Departing.The taxi started to move.\u201cWoah! This is great! I really feel like I\u2019m in the future now.\u201dAs he looked around with an amazed expression, he spotted a small pamphlet.[After the self-driving taxi was commercialized 18 years ago, the rate of traffic accidents have dropped to 0%\u2026]\u201c0%? Wow, this world is amazing.\u201d The car was comfortable to ride in too. Feeling better, Seo Jun-ho opened the window as he smiled. The cool wind felt good on his face, and he took in the sight of Seoul\u2019s nightscape.The time was 8:20 PM. The streets were filled with office workers in suits and young college students.It had been a rare sight when the gates had appeared.\u00a0Back then, we never knew when gates or monsters would show up.\u00a0He felt content as he watched the streets, and the taxi soon arrived at its destination.As he paid with Vita, he was met by a large park built with white stone. The courtyard of the museum was full of couples on dates and families who were out taking walks together.Something caught Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes as he watched the children run around.\u00a0Hey, isn\u2019t that my mask?The children were wearing plastic Specter masks. When he looked around, he found a stand selling them. He stepped closer, feeling curious, and saw a small child pulling on his parent\u2019s sleeve.\u201cPleaseee! I want it! I want the Specter mask!\u201d\u201cBe quiet. I bought you one last time.\u201d\u201cLast time was the Skaya mask!\u201d\u201cShush! Stop making a scene.\u201d\u201cPleaseeee!\u201d (tl/n crying noise idk how to tl)\u201cThen Jin-ho can live here. Mom and dad are going home.\u201d The child started to lay and cry on the ground, begging for the mask.Feeling a bit conceited, Seo Jun-ho went up to the seller.\u201cDo the Heroes\u2019 masks sell well?\u201d\u201cOf course they do. They\u2019re my most popular product. Especially\u2026\u201dAs if they were telling him a great secret, the seller looked around.\u201cThe Great Mage Skaya\u2019s. They\u2019re the most popular,\u201d they said in a low voice.\u201c\u2026That doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201dSeo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes went wide in surprise, and he looked at the seller with a confused expression.\u201cDoesn\u2019t Specter\u2019s mask sell the best?\u201d\u201cOf course not. They\u2019re the fourth best.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dWith a sour expression, Seo Jun-ho looked at the other items that were for sale. The collection of masks wasn\u2019t complete.\u201cUm, well, the other Heroes\u2019 masks have their faces on them, but we don\u2019t know what Specter looks like. All we can do is sell this black mask\u2026 Of course the kids wouldn\u2019t like them.\u201d\u201cBut they\u2019re cool. The black masks, I mean.\u201d (t/n \u314b\u314b\u314b he\u2019s so petty)\u201cWell, kids like things that look pretty.\u201d\u201c\u2026I would like a mask.\u201dSeo Jun-ho bought four Specter masks and carried them in his arms.\u201cMy original mask looks really cool though.\u201dHe made his way to the back of the museum and found the door. After it scanned his iris, he had the Seoul History Museum all to himself.\u201cWow, they put these on display?\u201dInside the museum, there were monster models, hides and bones, along with battle gear from famous players of the past.Seo Jun-ho walked around casually, looking at the display cases, and arrived in front of the morgue.\u2014Iris scan successful. Door is opening.Creak.As soon as the door opened, white smoke began to flow out.\u201c\u2026..\u201dThis chill, this feeling. The morgue felt eerily similar to the Frost Queen\u2019s Nest.\u201cI suppose it\u2019s because they wanted to preserve the ice statues\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t feel good about it. It seemed that his comrades couldn\u2019t escape from the Frost Queen\u2019s grasp, even in death.Step, step.He reached the center of the morgue and stared hard at the four statues.The Great Mage, Skaya Killiland.The King of Destruction, Rahmadat Kahli.The Gray Envoy, Gilbert Green.The Sky Phoenix, Tenmei Mio. (t/n Tenmei is her surname)They were his comrades, his reliable friends.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late.\u201d He\u2019d carried out his promise three days ago, after 25 years. He\u2019d never thought that he\u2019d keep it in this way.Rustle.Seo Jun-ho sat on the cold ground.\u201cDo you guys know? The world has gotten a lot better. Have you heard of the self-driving taxi?\u201d He explained the peace they\u2019d brought together. He wasn\u2019t great with words, but he used his hands to explain every single detail.\u201cIt\u2019s the peace we dreamed of.\u201d Even though it wasn\u2019t true peace, they\u2019d saved humanity and the world.\u201cSo please\u2026\u201d\u00a0My work is done, right? I can rest now, right?Seo Jun-ho pressed his lips together, unable to say the words. Because if he did, he felt like he\u2019d be admitting that it was the end.His friends were stuck in time forever in ice, and it seemed like only he was given that time back.\u201c\u2026Have a drink.\u201dHe pulled a bottle of alcohol from his inventory and poured a bit in front of each of his teammates.Drip.Only a little bit for Mio and Skaya, who didn\u2019t drink well, and plenty for the two others. He poured the rest down his throat.\u201cKeuhhh.\u201d (tl/n like a groaning noise when you drink lol)Feeling more awake, he put one mask in front of each statue.\u201cTake it with you. I\u2019ve done a lot of good deeds, so they\u2019ll give you the VIP treatment in heaven too.\u201d He finished soothing his friends\u2019 spirits.Still feeling some lingering regret, Seo Jun-ho dusted the ice statues\u2019 shoulders.\u201c\u2026Hey, don\u2019t go around looking dirty like that.\u201dTap, tap.\u00a0He brushed the dust off their shoulders without a second thought.[Effect of the skill \u2018Frost (EX)\u2019 has been checked.][Seal of Frost (EX) can be removed.][Your base magic stat is not high enough. Removal failed.]His eyes widened as he read over the three lines.\u201c\u2026What?\u201dAs if he was possessed, Seo Jun-ho touched the ice statue again. The same message popped up, but his mind was already racing.I can remove the seal? Me?Deok-gu had said that the ice couldn\u2019t be melted even with the current technology or player skills.But he could.\u201cThe Frost skill\u2026\u201dHe\u2019d acquired the skill from the Frost Queen\u2019s nucleus.\u201cFuu, haa, fuu, haa.\u201d Taking deep breaths to calm himself, Seo Jun-ho fell deep in thought. He\u2019d have to check his current stats before he did anything else.\u201cStatus window.\u201d As soon as he muttered the words, a small hologram window appeared. It is one of the abilities the system gave to the players.[Seo Jun-ho]Level: 1Title: The One Who Opens SpringStrength: 21\u00a0Stamina: 24Speed: 26\u00a0Magic: 18Frost (EX), Watchguard of Darkness (S), Hunter\u2019s Night (A), Hero\u2019s Mind (A), Weapon Mastery (A), Keen Intuition (B).Original abilities have been drastically reduced.Original abilities will be restored as time passes and as you level up.\u201c\u2026..\u201dHe glanced at the special status section, and his eyes glimmered with hope. He had the Frost (EX) skill.This is the key.\u00a0The key to saving his friends. Not only that, it had skipped right over the S-grade to be an EX-grade skill.Deok-gu always said that S-grade was the highest.If Korea\u2019s Player Association believed that, that probably meant that he was the first one to ever have such a skill.But the system said that my magic stat is too low to remove the seal\u2026\u00a0He looked closer at his status window.\u201cTsk.\u201dHe\u2019d dropped from level 80 and his stats were depressingly low. But it wouldn\u2019t be that way forever.I\u2019ll be able to restore them.Of course, it wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d be able to do in a day or two. His Keen Intuition skill told him that. (t/n girl i can tell you that without a special skill)\u201cMy magic is 18? Is this on purpose?\u201d He laughed until his chest hurt, remembering all the times his low magic stat had gotten in his way. \u201cMagic is always the problem.\u201dHe\u2019d tried supplements and magic-boosting items, but his low magic stat always made things harder. He let out a long, frustrated sigh, and spotted something.\u201cHuh? The One Who Opens Spring?\u201dHe recalled that he\u2019d received the title when he defeated the Frost Queen. He\u2019d been a player for 5 years, but that had been the first title he\u2019d ever received.\u2026When Skaya created magic for the first time, she received the title \u2018Mage\u2019s First Steps\u2019.\u00a0He remembered her boasting about getting 15 extra magic stat points and being able to cast spells faster.\u00a0Either way, I think you can only get them from doing near-impossible tasks\u2026 I should check the effects.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCheck title, The One Who Opens Spring.\u201dWoosh.A new section popped up below the status window.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of the Frozen PlayerCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay25 years later (3)[The One Who Opens Spring]Rank: SDescription: A title given to the one who defeated the master of the starting floor, the Frost Queen.Effects: +500% Stamina and Magic regeneration speed, +30 to all stats every time you go up a floor.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAt a loss for words, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eye widened, as if an earthquake was occuring. He re-read the effects of the title over and over.These are the effects of the title?He thought it would have raised his stats by a little at best, just like Skaya\u2019s.Bloody hell. This is far greater than that.To be honest, the +500% regeneration speed for Stamina and Magic was nice to have, but it wasn\u2019t essential. However, the second effect was something else.\u201cSo all my stats will increase by 30 everytime I go up a floor\u2026\u201dIn other words, the effect would activate every time he went up a floor on the dimensional elevator. Hypothetically, if he made it up to the 10th floor, all his stats would be greater than 270 at the very least.\u201cOh my god.\u201dJun-ho got goosebumps all over his body thinking about such ridiculous stats. When he defeated the Frost Queen, his highest stat was Speed at 225. His lowest stat was Magic at 183.I wasn\u2019t afraid of anything before. So if all my stats become higher than 270\u2026The look in Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes changed. His stats would be a little over 270 at the bare minimum. Now, what if he was fully equipped and maxed out his levels?And on top of that, if I restore my original stats\u2026He could picture it clearly in his head. The Frost Queen had an incredible amount of magic. The world froze over at a simple flick of her wrist.That power\u2026 No, I could obtain an even greater power than that.That amount of power should have no trouble thawing the ice statues.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter collecting his thoughts, Jun-ho silently stared at the four ice statues in front of him. After standing there for a good while, he quietly left the morgue. When he exited the Museum, there was a resolve in his eyes that wasn\u2019t there before.There\u2019s 10 floors? I guess I\u2019m climbing it.Did he want to reach the top floor to achieve humanity\u2019s desire to clear the game?\u00a0 Or perhaps to save the Earth from destruction?\u201cBullshit.\u201dSeo Jun-ho knew better than anyone else that he was a selfish person. There was only one reason he decided to not quit as a player.To free my friends from their freezing, ice prison.That was the only reason he decided to become a player once again. He buried his resolve deep into his heart.* * *\u201cWhat?! You want to become a player again?\u201dThe next day, Shim Deok-gu was shocked by Jun-ho\u2019s sudden declaration. Jun-ho looked up at him slyly while chowing down a large bowl of Seolleongtang (Korean ox bone soup).\u201cWhy are you so surprised? It\u2019s not like I know how to do anything else.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s so sudden. Aren\u2019t you the same guy that used to whine about how you want to retire everyday?\u201d\u201cPeople can have a change of heart.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best idea.\u201dBecause he thought that his friend would have been fully on board with the idea, Jun-ho put down his spoon and questioned him.\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, I want you to get some rest. I\u2019ve personally seen how hard you pushed yourself. I think you\u2019ve done enough. It\u2019s about time you let go of all your burdens and find something you want to do.\u201dNagging, nagging, and more nagging. This guy was always nagging him, but Jun-ho was well aware that his friend nagged him out of genuine concern. His heartfelt concern made Jun-ho smile as he asked the next question.\u201cSo what\u2019s the second reason?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of the fiends.\u201d\u201cHuh? Are they at it again?\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dThe silence affirmed his question. Jun-ho quickly got the gist of the situation.\u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that there are more of \u2018em when the world is like this. They\u2019re harder to get rid of than cockroaches.\u201dFiends. They are people who had no interest in closing the gates or exterminating monsters. Instead, they were the scum of society, using their powers to commit crimes, murder, and terrorism.\u201cThe fiends have been rampaging lately.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s funny. When I was around, they didn\u2019t even dare to peep.\u201d\u201cWell, that was back then.\u201d28 years ago, all the fiends in the world went into hiding. It was because they feared the Five Heroes. They accepted the fact that they were no match and went incognito into the underworld.\u201cOnce the 2nd floor opened up, things changed due to the lack of video surveillance and satellites in the Frontier.\u201dIt meant that there was no means of monitoring and restricting the actions of the fiends. Shim Deok-gu stared at Jun-ho.\u201cAnd we lost our Five Heroes.\u201d\u201cThey were probably unbelievably elated.\u201d\u201cThey must have been really pent up because they started going even crazier than before.\u201dThe absence of someone to fear, someone to teach them a lesson with overwhelming power, meant that the fiends no longer had a reason to hold themselves back.\u201cI think I get why you don\u2019t want me to go back to being a player.\u201dJun-ho slowly nodded his head. If Deok-gu was telling the truth, it wouldn\u2019t be weird if he dropped dead at any moment. He was the perfect prey to the fiends who have accumulated more power over the last 25 years.With a hesitant voice, Jun-ho asked, \u201cDo they\u2026 still hate me a lot?\u201d\u201cAre you kidding? They were probably happier than anyone to hear the news of your return, since they can finally kill you.\u201d\u201cFuck,\u201d said Jun-ho with a frown. He thought he\u2019d get to level up easily while being treated like a hero, but things had taken a turn for the worse.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you that it\u2019s a bad idea. The only way you could be a player right now is to abandon your mask and nickname of Specter\u2026 but do you really want to do that? You could live being treated like a king while being protected 24/7 by the greatest players.\u201d\u201c\u2026The 10th floor. I need to get there.\u201d\u201cWait, why all of a sudden?\u201dDeok-gu clearly didn\u2019t understand what was going on. The Jun-ho he knew should have been scheming how to collect the reward for saving the world.\u201cThe 3rd floor. Have you guys found a way to clear that floor yet?\u201d\u201cI already told you yesterday. There\u2019s no way to do it as of now.\u201d\u201cWhat if I told you I knew a way how?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d* * ** * *Deok-gu frowned his eyebrows. He knew Jun-ho wasn\u2019t the kind of guy who would joke around with this kind of topic.\u201cCan you explain what you mean by that?\u201d\u201cYou said you were looking for the Frost Queen\u2019s nucleus, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. Why? Do you perhaps know where it might be?\u201d\u201cI think I do.\u201dSlurp.Jun-ho picked up the bowl and downed the remaining broth before continuing.\u201cUgh. I ate well.\u201d\u201cWe were in the middle of talking\u2026 whatever, so what do you know?\u201d\u201cI ate well.\u201d\u201cHey, now isn\u2019t the time for you to talk about your Seolleongtang\u2026\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about, though?\u201dDeok-gu started blinking in disbelief.\u201cSo if you\u2019re not talking about the Seolleongtang\u2026 Wait, did you\u2026?\u201d\u201cEhem.\u201d\u201cPlease tell me I\u2019m wrong. You\u2019re not actually saying something crazy like how you swallowed up the Frost Queen\u2019s nucleus, right?\u201dWhen his friend suddenly got up in fury, seemingly ready to split his stomach open, Jun-ho tried to calm him down.\u201cWhoa, whoa! You\u2019re still as hot-headed as always, huh. First hear me out.\u201d\u201cYou, you, you\u2026! Did you really fucking eat it?!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t eat it because I wanted to! It\u2019s not my fault that it got absorbed into my body as soon as I touched it!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Oh lord. My doctor warned me I need to avoid stress.\u201d Deok-gu said, massaging the back of his neck. After a brief moment, he continued, his face now drained of energy. \u201cI know you\u2019re not the type to bring things up if you don\u2019t have to. So, you have a solution, right?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d Jun-ho nodded his head. \u201cI got a Frost ability after absorbing the nucleus.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is it possible to freeze the 3rd floor\u2019s altar with it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Jun-ho answered confidently.It was an EX-rank ability. If he couldn\u2019t with this ability, it would also be impossible with the Frost Queen\u2019s nucleus.\u201cPhew, that\u2019s a relief.\u201dDeok-gu nodded his head to Jun-ho\u2019s plan. He had zero doubts. His friend was the guy that defeated the Frost Queen, something everyone else deemed impossible. If Jun-ho said it was possible, then it meant that it was possible. This also gave Deok-gu an insight as to why he wanted to become a player again.\u201cThis is related to your comrades, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cNone of them kept their promise to see me again later. I need to wake them up, so I can yell at them.\u201d\u201cWake them up\u2026 Is that actually possible?\u201d\u201cThe system told me it was.\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s great news.\u201dWhile giving a wide smile, Deok-gu started calculating things in head. It didn\u2019t take long for him to realize what Jun-ho wanted right now.\u201cIf I recall correctly, the doctors saw your face earlier, right?\u201d\u201cNine of them saw, to be exact.\u201d\u201cI happen to have a subordinate with the ability to erase memories. It\u2019ll be best if we take some precautionary measures.\u201dThey were like two matching puzzle pieces. Seo Jun-ho felt more comfortable chatting with Shim Deok-gu than anyone else.\u201cOh, by the way, my level was reset, so I\u2019m level 1 now.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did that also reset your stats?\u201d\u201cBingo.\u201d\u201cSigh, why do you always save the bad news for last?\u201dAfter pinching the bridge of his nose, Deok-gu tried to think positively about the situation.\u201cLet\u2019s look on the bright side. Others are probably assuming that you\u2019re still as strong as ever.\u201d\u201cThey probably can\u2019t imagine\u00a0The Specter\u00a0being only level 1.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about your identity being revealed for a bit.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re able to issue player permits with your authority, right?\u201d\u201cWell, the thing is\u2026\u201dDeok-gu made an unhappy face.\u201cAfter the 2nd floor opened up, guilds have become more powerful than the World Players\u2019 Association.\u201d\u201cDid you guys lose the authority to issue permits?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not quite it. Instead, a few guilds now stand in as observers during the association\u2019s player permit test. Only people who have passed this open exam are able to receive a player permit. I can\u2019t get around this rule even with my authority.\u201d\u201cTsk, that\u2019s annoying.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more rules and regulations than before, but think about this as an opportunity.\u201dDeok-gu\u2019s eyes glimmered as he spoke with excitement.\u201cThink about it. In order for me to fully back you, I need a proper reason.\u201d\u201c\u2026Aha, I see.\u201dDeok-gu was telling him to get the best possible results on the test. If Jun-ho proved that he was a player worthy enough to grab the attention of all the guilds, Deok-gu would be able to provide massive support in the name of the association.\u201cOf course, you can\u2019t use your Darkness skill at all. If possible, you should also hide your Frost skill.\u201d\u201cI get Darkness, but why Frost as well?\u201d\u201cThe fiends also know that ice-related skills are the key to clearing the 3rd floor. It\u2019ll be best if you don\u2019t stick out in that regard.\u201d\u201cHmm, I get it.\u201dLaying on the hospital bed, Jun-ho lightly cracked his neck.\u201cMy body is ready\u2026 What equipment am I going to use for the test?\u201dUnfortunately, his first-rate equipment was currently unusable due to the level and stat restrictions. So, they were just being safekept in his inventory for the moment.\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to select them on the day of the test. Everyone has to use the same grade of equipment for it.\u201d\u201cSeems fair.\u201dJun-ho couldn\u2019t help but smirk.\u201cIt\u2019s honestly quite refreshing. Can you believe that I\u2019m being evaluated like this after all I\u2019ve been through?\u201d\u201cJust don\u2019t go too crazy. As for me, I guess I\u2019ll need to create an identity for you. Date of birth, background story, acquaintances\u2026 I guess I\u2019ll be pretty busy for a while.\u201d\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take you?\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cFour or five days. How long do you think it\u2019ll take you to get ready? About a month?\u201dAfter hearing that question, Jun-ho had a cocky smile on his face.\u201cOne week. That\u2019ll be more than enough.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of the Frozen PlayerCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBack in my day (1)Physical Therapy Facility #12, HanGook Hospital.Seo Jun-ho sat on the floor, in the middle of the room, with his legs crossed and eyes closed. It was a technique for improving the flow of magic power. He learned it from his comrade, Rahmadat.Getting my body back in shape will be no simple task.It would take at least a few months for him to train his body. Of course, he couldn\u2019t just spend his time training for who knows how long. That\u2019s why he decided to start with stuff he could improve on right away.My Magic stat is only 18\u2026It was a pretty unimpressive stat.Even slightly talented players often awakened with at least 20 Magic stat.\u201cDamn, I\u2019ll have to struggle like hell again to increase my magic.\u201dReminiscing his old memories brought a shadow to Jun-ho\u2019s face. The day that he awakened as a player was also the day that he swore vengeance after losing his family. That was when he obtained the S-rank skill \u2018Watchguard of Darkness\u2019.However, it took half a year before he was able to use the skill properly. There was a simple reason.This stupid skill. It requires so much fucking magic.As powerful as it was, it required equally as much magic to use. Jun-ho, who possessed less magic than the average person, did everything he could to make up for his weakness.All your stats increased by 1 every level. When he had just become a player, that was the only method he knew to raise his magic. So he killed monsters again and again to grind up levels. In the time that a person would go hunting once, he went on a hunt at least 3 to 5 times. While others were hospitalized from injuries, he just put on some bandages and continued to hunt. After a few years of repeating his hellish routine, he had become the world\u2019s greatest player.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dAfter emptying his thoughts, Jun-ho started slowly gathering the magic inside his body. The magic started flowing through his entire body, awakening his magic circuit.I\u2019ve gotten real rusty.Due to not using it for 25 years, his magic circuit has fallen into a deep slumber. People commonly compared magic to trains, and magic circuits to train tracks. It was only natural for an unused train track to become covered in foliage. It was the same thing for Jun-ho\u2019s magic circuit. It\u2019s been so long since any magic has flowed through it that it became rusty.Most players actually don\u2019t concern themselves about such details, since no matter the condition, one can still use magic. However, Jun-ho was the kind of person who felt unsatisfied if his circuit wasn\u2019t in tip-top shape.I already lack magic, I need to at least use it as efficiently as possible.There was a smaller loss of magic when it passed through a clean and clear circuit. That\u2019s why Jun-ho always maintained his magic circuit as best as possible.I\u2019m only at 70% magic efficiency. This is basically unusable.Rush!Jun-ho collected the little magic he had onto a single point and unleashed it onto his rusted magic circuit. Magic quickly started rampaging through his circuit, which was spread across his entire body like tree roots. As magic coursed through the circuit, it slowly scraped off the impurities.Swoosh.When he opened his eyes again, three hours had passed. His entire body was soaked in sweat.\u201cSniff, sniff.\u00a0Luckily, I don\u2019t stink.\u201dMaybe it was because he was trapped in ice, there weren\u2019t much toxins built up inside him. This was good news. It meant that he could just focus on getting his body back to its optimal condition.After getting up from his spot, Jun-ho tried gathering some magic. Unlike 3 hours ago, he was able to gather magic with greater ease.\u201c95% magic efficiency\u2026 It\u2019s less than what I had, but this isn\u2019t too bad.\u201dThis satisfying sensation was the reason why he took good care of his magic circuit. With a satisfied smile, he tightened his fist. Jun-ho started gathering all the magic he possessed. It was time to test the limits of his skills.Fwoooosh!The darkness created by magic bloomed flamboyantly, like a drop of black paint that fell in water. Someone who has seen this for the first time might even describe it as beautiful and approach it. But anyone who knew the truth about this skill would never do such a stupid thing. Darkness was more heinous and violent than any other attribute.\u201cKugh\u2026\u201dJun-ho\u2019s face started crumpling while maintaining the skill.\u201cUgh, cough! Cough\u2026\u201dUnable to hold it anymore, he started hacking and coughing. When he was able to lift his head back up, the darkness had subsided.Wiping the spit off the corners of his lips, he thought to himself,\u00a0So this is my limit with my current magic.Many thoughts rushed through his head.In this case\u2026 how should I utilize it in real combat?How did I fight when I used to lack mana?Ugh, I really am fucking short on magic.After searching through his memories, he quickly found the answers.I could use it as a blind or a trap, since I can only momentarily affect physical matter.He would be able to blind the target or grab their ankle. That was all he could do right now with his insignificant amount of magic.Once I replenish my magic, let\u2019s look into my Frost skill.Thanks to the effects of\u00a0The One Who Opens Spring, he could notice the fast recovery speed of his magic. Once his magic was fully replenished, he squinted his eyes in thought.\u201cI wonder what it\u2019s like.\u201dHe was so curious, he thought he would go mad. When he gained proper control over the S-rank\u00a0 Watchguard of Darkness, he became unmatched. Frost was EX-rank, so it should be even stronger. He was honestly even a bit terrified.\u2026Is this thing also going to eat up a shit ton of magic?With a worried face, Jun-ho slowly closed his eyes.Like this\u2026 or no, is it like this?Darkness and Frost. The two abilities were similar in that it created something from nothing. Thanks to that, he was able to activate the Frost skill much easier than he anticipated.Shoooo!The ground he stood on froze solid. In contrast, there was a warm smile on his face.\u201cIt uses up less than I expected!\u201dAs an EX-rank skill, it definitely took a bit of magic, but it used up similar amounts of magic as Watchguard of Darkness. That meant that it had a great magic-to-performance ratio.If it only takes this much magic\u2026 I think I\u2019ll be able to use it in actual combat with just a slightly higher Magic stat.Also, unlike Watchguard of Darkness, he didn\u2019t have to experiment to figure out how to optimally utilize it.\u201cI\u2019ve already seen enough of how it should be used.\u201dJun-ho battled against the Frost Queen for over 70 hours. That means he learned her techniques for 70 hours. And he didn\u2019t just see it. He experienced it firsthand.\u201cI can\u2019t wait for the examination.\u201dThe wide smile on Jun-ho\u2019s face wouldn\u2019t subside.* * ** * *A week flew by pretty quick. During that week, Seo Jun-ho trained his body and memorized all the materials that Shim Deok-gu brought over. Most of it was a summary of major events that occurred in the last 25 years.\u201cAlright, I\u2019m ready.\u201dPop, pop, pop.Jun-ho cracked his neck, and put on some casual clothes. He was planning on getting discharged from the hospital on top of taking his test.Though, there will still be a body double that will occupy this bed for me.Officially, Specter was still bedridden. The association released a public statement saying that he was in critical condition and needed at least a few months to recover.\u201cReveal Specter-nim* to the public!\u201d(T/N: -nim is an honorific used in Korean to refer to someone with respect)\u201cReveal him!\u201dAfter leaving the hospital, Jun-ho walked away from the chaos of loud reporters and civilians. Some were even using a megaphone.\u201cReveal my ass. Do they not feel sorry for a hospitalized patient?\u201dThough, if they had any common sense, they wouldn\u2019t be making such a ruckus first thing in the morning. But he really couldn\u2019t comment more on it, since he was the root cause of the commotion.After getting on a taxi, he immediately headed to the Players\u2019 Association headquarters.\u201cThey must have spent a pretty penny.\u201dThe 80-floor building had an elegant, curved design. In front of the building, countless people were gathered. They were all people applying for the player permit exam. Jun-ho had pre-registered, so he was able to enter without having to stand in line.\u201cPlease rest in the waiting room for the meantime, and enter once it\u2019s your turn.\u201dJun-ho glanced over at the queue monitor. Number 75. He still had a bit of time until his turn.Clamor, clamor.The waiting room had a surprisingly relaxed atmosphere. It was because the permit exam didn\u2019t have a limit to the number of participants that could pass. As long as you were skilled, you would pass, so there was no need for people to be conscious of each other.\u201cPhew.\u201dAfter sitting down at a chair, Jun-ho crossed his arms, closed his eyes, and listened closely. He was able to gather intel that wasn\u2019t found in the very formal materials that Deok-gu handed him.\u201cDid you see the news this morning? Finally, the ancient dungeon on the 2nd floor will be raided\u2026 the Sky\u2019s Breath will\u2026\u201d\u201cApparently, today\u2019s judge will be the association president Shim Deok-gu of all people.\u201d\u201cSigh, if I fail the exam again, it\u2019ll be my 3rd time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been 2 years since I awakened, but I still haven\u2019t been able to pass the test. Am I really that untalented?\u201d\u201cDoes anyone know which weapon has the highest probability of passing?\u201dThere really isn\u2019t any super useful information.That shouldn\u2019t be surprising, since it was a conversation among people that haven\u2019t even become a player yet. In fact, it would be more shocking if they knew any valuable intel. The moment he opened his eyes after losing interest in reconnaissance, an announcement started.\u2013 \u201cParticipant Number 1, please enter.\u201dA humongous holographic screen appeared in the center of the waiting room. One could clearly observe the situation inside the testing room with it. Soon, participant number 1, who just finished selecting his weapon in the prep room, came up on screen.A spear.He was holding a long spear, and his face was full of anxiety. However, the exam didn\u2019t care for his condition, starting without any warning.\u201cOho.\u201dHolographic monsters charged at the man. He took a large swing with his spear, advancing towards the monsters. That made them slowly back off.\u201cOoh, isn\u2019t he quite fierce?\u201d\u201cThe monsters are retreating because they\u2019re scared.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so jealous. Number 1 looks like he\u2019s going to easily pass.\u201dAmazement from the participants who didn\u2019t know anything filled the waiting room. However, Jun-ho simply shook his head.Come on, that\u2019s not how you use a spear.The spear was a weapon that was most effective when you secured a safe distance from your opponent. Getting that up close meant that he had no proper understanding of the spear.And would you look at that. The man fell down on his ass after getting tangled up with the monsters that charged back at him. With that, the combat was over. The monsters disappeared in an instant, and the man held a dazed look while he was given the notice of failure.So this is how this goes.Seo Jun-ho could feel his body itch, full of anticipation. He wondered if he would be able to feel \u2018the sensation of cutting\u2019 against holographic monsters.* * *The layout of the judges\u2019 room was quite unique. One side of the room was a glass wall, which gave you a complete view of the examination room. In front of the glass wall was a cushy sofa, where 10 men and women sat.\u201cHmm. This participant is also pretty lackluster.\u201d\u201cHe appears to have not studied the characteristics of the monsters or tactics to face off against them.\u201d\u201cThat kind of preparation should be essential for a player.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019ll be best to fail him.\u201dOne by one, the guilds\u2019 observers spoke, but unlike the usual, they were unable to strongly voice their opinions. They all carefully gave their 2 cents, watching the mood of one of the people in the room.\u201cI\u2019m of the same opinion. Let\u2019s fail him.\u201dThough the Korean Players\u2019 Association might no longer have its former glory, he was still the president of the association. All the observers were careful to not upset Shim Deok-gu.\u201cBring in the next participant.\u201dAs soon as Deok-gu finished speaking, an announcement was made. After a minute, a new participant entered the examination room. At the same time, multiple observers frowned.\u201cSigh\u2026\u00a0Every test, there is always at least one person who does this.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this way over the top, though? Sword, bow, throwing knives, even a spear and a gun\u2026 He basically brought in as many weapons as he could.\u201d\u201cDespite lacking understanding of the weapon, they always bring in a whole bunch like that.\u201d\u201cThey probably think that the more weapons they have, the stronger they become.\u201d\u201cDo they think that they\u2019re Specter or something?\u201d\u201cLooking at how skinny he is, I\u2019m even doubtful of his ability to take care of himself.\u201dThis participant had what people commonly called the Specter disease. They were little greenhorns that wanted to copy Specter who was called the master of all weapons a.k.a. the Walking Arsenal. Their common characteristic was that they carried around multiple weapons.\u201cEven we\u2019re baffled. I bet this really grinds your gears, president.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWell, aren\u2019t these people imitating your close friend, Specter-nim?\u201d\u201cAnd you were closer than anyone else to him, the one that people called the perfect player.\u201d\u201c\u2026That is indeed true. This is quite a funny situation.\u201dAfter finishing his sentence, Doek-gu couldn\u2019t help but let out a faint laugh while looking down at the examination room.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euI told you to be flashy and knock their socks off\u2026 but isn\u2019t this too much, you bastard?The patient with the Specter disease(?), Seo Jun-ho, looked around the room with fascination.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of the Frozen PlayerCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBack in my day (2)\u2013 \u201cParticipant Number 75, please enter.\u201dIt\u2019s finally my turn.As soon as he heard the announcement calling for him, Seo Jun-ho entered the prep room.Inside, there was an association employee that started talking to him.\u201cWe welcome you, participant Seo Jun-ho.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou can select any weapon you want from this room, and once you are ready, you simply have to exit through this door.\u201dJun-ho looked around at all the weapons displayed in the room. On top of the Eighteen Arms of Wushu*, bows and pistols, there were even unique weapons like halberds prepared.(TN: The 18 main weapons of Chinese martial arts. The actual list of 18 weapons differs depending on the school of martial arts.)\u201cThere\u2019s no limit on how many weapons I can take, right?\u201d\u201cYes. Every once in a while, there are people who pick more than 2 weapons.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201dWith a face full of excitement, Jun-ho started grabbing weapons left and right. First, he holstered a Glock 17 to his waist, and hung a bow and quiver on his back. Next, he secured 5 throwing knives onto his thigh and a sword to his waist. Finally, he picked up a spear.Watching Jun-ho, the employee let out a small sigh before asking, \u201cParticipant Seo Jun-ho. Are you planning on bringing in all those weapons?\u201d\u201cCan I not?\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026\u00a0No, you can.\u201dThe employee shook his head. Because he\u2019s seen many other participants like Jun-ho, he knew it was pointless to advise them against it. Having lost the ability to give a fuck, he handed Jun-ho a pair of gloves.\u201cIf you\u2019ve finished preparing, please equip these gloves.\u201dNoticing the blank face on Jun-ho, he started explaining.\u201cThis is a magical tool that lets you interact with the summoned holographic monsters in the examination room.\u201d\u201cOooh, that\u2019s cool.\u201dJun-ho put on the gloves, and after a final check on his weapons, he raised his head.\u201cI\u2019m ready, so am I good to go?\u201d\u201cYes, you just have to enter through this door.\u201dJun-ho opened the door, and entered the examination room. The room was much larger than it appeared on screen, and the entire room\u2014wall, floor, and ceiling\u2014was white.\u2013 \u201cParticipant Seo Jun-ho. Are you ready?\u201dWoosh, swoosh.He nodded at the speakers while gently spinning around the spear.\u2013 \u201cThen the evaluation will commence.\u201dImmediately after the announcement ended, monsters started spawning all around him.This is even cooler in person.The holographic monsters were so vivid, it felt like real monsters were in front of him. While being in awe, Jun-ho already finished analyzing the monsters.20 dwarves*, huh. It does seem like a few too many for a beginner.(TN: It is possible that the monster that the author is referring to is a gnome or some other short mythological creature here.)This was the reason why the passing rate for the permit evaluation was not even 3%. The average height of a dwarf was 130cm. Compared to a human male adult, they were much smaller, and their physical abilities matched their small physique. As much as the players knew this fact, dwarves were even more self-aware of their weakness.Dwarves are smart and cunning.They were monsters that used their relentlessness and cunning to make up for their lack of physical prowess. So if you underestimated them and recklessly approached them like participant number 1, you will find yourself suddenly knocked over. And if you ever get knocked down, it was game over.Their daggers will tear you apart like you\u2019re Julius Caesar.Jun-ho couldn\u2019t help but chuckle, watching the dwarves who were on their guard against him.This is making me nostalgic.The ugly, drooling dwarves re-awakened his old memories.\u201cThings have really gotten better. We didn\u2019t have stuff like this before.\u201dPermit evaluation? Holographic monsters?Such luxury.Long ago, the only way to become a player was to risk your life and enter a gate. If you came back alive, you were issued a permit, and if you failed, you left no traces of your corpse.\u201cBack in my day, you had to put in a thing called effort. And I mean a looooot of effort.\u201d(T/N: Oki Boomer.)Effort to not die and effort to kill the monster. And even after putting in a lot of effort, it was still common for a player to die because they were simply unlucky. After living through such a turbulent time, holographic monsters were funny to Jun-ho.They might be really great imitations, but\u2026They were still \u2018fakes\u2019 created by an AI.\u201cWill this make them attack me?\u201dJun-ho slightly shifted his hips, purposefully creating an \u2018opening\u2019. Without any hesitation, dwarves charged at him while hissing.1.5 meters.The spear he was holding was approximately 130cm. Taking his arm length into account, he was able to take complete control over the 1.5m radius around him. Of course, the mobs made of data in front of him wouldn\u2019t know such things.\u2013 \u201cKrrugh\u201d\u2013 \u201cKiii-egh!\u201dTightly gripping their daggers with both hands, 4 impatient dwarves jumped towards Jun-ho. They planned on swinging at his head with all their might, but the moment their bodies were at the apex of their jump\u2014Heave ho.Jun-ho had a small frame, yet the muscles on his arms suddenly ballooned up.Pow-pow!The spear blew up the heads of the dwarves at lightning speed. Their bodies turned into polygons and disappeared before it could even hit the ground.\u2013 \u201cKkirugh?\u201d\u2013 \u201cHiss!\u201dThe death of their comrades halted their charge and made them disperse.Dispersing and surrounding a stronger enemy\u2026 They\u2019ve done a good job replicating their behaviour.Jun-ho planted his spear into the ground.\u201cBut that\u2019s not going to be enough against me.\u201d* * ** * *With his left hand, he pulled out the 5 daggers on his thigh, and with his right hand, he readied his Glock 17.Start with the guys behind me.Fwoosh!Jun-ho threw the 5 daggers behind him.Bang, bang, bang, bang!The Glock 17 spat fire. Five with the daggers, four with the pistol. In a literal blink of an eye, 9 dwarves disappeared before they could even let out a peep.\u2013 \u201cKii, kkiugh.\u201d\u2013 \u201cKuu-rrang!\u201dThe massacre dampened the bloodthirst of the 7 remaining dwarves, making them slowly walk backwards, away from Jun-ho.\u201cOoh, so they even feel fear?\u201dHaving read the emotions off their eyes, Jun-ho was entertained.\u201cDamn, this is pretty sadistic.\u201dCan you kill a monster that has lost the will to fight? That\u2019s what the test was asking the player.\u201cWell, I only have one answer for that.\u201dJun-ho grabbed the bow that was hanging on his back, immediately drawing an arrow.\u2013 \u201cKki, kkiegh!\u201dSuccumbing to fear, the dwarves started running away. Due to their small size and quick speed, they were a beginner archer\u2019s worst nightmare.But I have Weapon Mastery (A) and Gilbert taught me archery and gunmanship.Gilbert Green was one of the Five Heroes. He was a gunman known as the Gray Envoy.I can\u2019t smear mud on his face now, can I?Puuuuuull.As Jun-ho drew his bow, the dwarves started running faster. Despite being holograms, their desire to survive was even greater than real dwarves.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJun-ho closed one eye and aimed at his moving target. His form was textbook perfect.Wooooosh!The arrow was shot without any warning, piercing the dwarf\u2019s back. An amazing feat, as the dwarf has been zig-zagging. However, Jun-ho wasn\u2019t satisfied by this. He quickly grabbed another arrow.Woosh, fwip! Wooosh!Three arrows flew one after another, creating three polygons.\u201cPhew.\u201dAfter the last show, he put down his bow and caressed the scabbard of his sword.The finale should be this guy.The sword was the weapon he had been using the longest, so it was also the weapon he was most confident in.\u2013 \u201cKkiyaaaack!\u201dDid they realize that they would die no matter how much they ran? The final 3 dwarves charged back, their eyes bloodshot.Brush, brush.Even though the dwarves were charging at him, Jun-ho just stood there, stroking his scabbard.He drew an imaginary line, one meter in front of him. It marked\u00a0 the maximum reach of his sword, and it was also the \u2018Death Line\u2019 for the dwarves.\u2013 \u201cKkiyaaack.\u201d\u2013 \u201cKkraaagh!\u201dThe moment the dwarves crossed the \u2018Death Line,\u2019 Jun-ho smirked as he gripped his sword.\u201cIf you cross the line\u2026\u201dThe steel of the sword revealed itself in a flash.Swoosh! Slice!A single, clean cutting sound echoed, and the beheaded bodies of the dwarves dispersed as polygons.\u201cYou deserve death.\u201dHis display of skill was enough to impress anyone, but Jun-ho looked down in disappointment at his hand wielding the sword.I really have gotten dull.It shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, but his current skills couldn\u2019t even hold a candle to him in his prime. That wasn\u2019t the only lament.\u201c\u2026It hurts.\u201dHaving pushed his body to its limits, his bones and muscles were screaming in anguish.In order to explore the gates, I\u2019ll have to build up my body a little.While making a face of displeasure, Jun-ho listened to the results of his examination.\u2013 \u201cPa-pass\u2026\u2026 Participant number 75, Seo Jun-ho-nim. Congratulations on passing.\u201d* * *\u201c\u2026Incredible. I literally don\u2019t know how to describe it any other way.\u201dWhen Jun-ho\u2019s test was over, the observers couldn\u2019t hide their amazement. Normally, they sat in their chairs feigning refinement, so their action of sticking to the glass window with excitement spoke for itself.\u201cI stand corrected. He isn\u2019t some discount Specter copycat.\u201d\u201cFrom the spearmanship that perfectly utilized its range, to the usage of throwing knives, marksmanship, archery, and ending with that powerful but refined swordsmanship\u2026 his understanding of weaponry is outstanding.\u201d\u201cAnd look at the balance of his body. Just by looking at him, you can tell he lacks muscle mass to the point that it\u2019s almost pathetic\u2026 yet he\u2019s able to move like that?\u201dThe observers couldn\u2019t stop complimenting Jun-ho. That\u2019s when the only other person than Shim Deok-gu who has been remaining silent, started speaking.\u201cLooking at his profile\u2026 his only skill is Weapon Proficiency, and it\u2019s only D-rank.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cOnly D-rank?\u201dThe observers quickly clamored down like they were a fire that got sprayed with water.It\u2019s not even his sub-skill, but it\u2019s his only skill that\u2019s D-rank? That doesn\u2019t seem too promising for me to back him.Hmm, so this is that case. Someone who put all their effort into the one skill they possess\u2026I wonder. Did he put everything on the line for this evaluation knowing that his own skill is lackluster?It really won\u2019t be worth it to invest in him.I almost got tricked.The observers quickly finished their calculations. If his skill was even at C-rank, they would have scouted him to their guilds. But it\u2019s only D-rank? Of course, if they invest enough, and with a bit of luck, he could become a top-tier player. However, they were scouts of profit-seeking \u2018guilds\u2019.Winning a gamble tastes sweet\u2026 but nothing is more bitter than losing one.Why should I pick the harder, more dangerous road when there is an easier path.I do like his sense of combat, but I\u2019m not quite sure about signing him\u2026Without even realizing it, he was being treated like chicken ribs\u2014not enough meat to feel satisfied, but that didn\u2019t mean you should just let someone else have it. It was a perfect metaphor for a player that they didn\u2019t want to sign on, but they also didn\u2019t want to let another guild have him.Deok-gu watched them struggle with their dilemma, peacefully taking a sip from his coffee.This should be enough pre-tense for me to bring on Jun-ho without ruffling any feathers.Jun-ho exhibited a perfect result in the evaluation. There was enough of a \u2018reason\u2019 for him to fully invest in him, even if the scouts were hesitating to sign him on, deeming him as having little potential\u2026It almost makes me feel bad for hiding the skills he has from them.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeo Jun-ho was a top-tier player that could handle not one but two elements. And he also possessed a myriad of skills. Even the Weapon Proficiency (D) skill they think he has is actually Weapon Mastery (A).I\u2019ll have to get the windows cleaned once the evaluations are over.As he put his coffee cup back down, a smile of a winner was faintly visible on Shim Deok-gu\u2019s face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wore a bright smile as he finished his work for the day.\u201cLMAO! Damn, this novel\u2019s so hilarious.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA dark shadow wiped away his smile. He could see a nuisance in front of him. A nuisance that was lying down on his office sofa, eating chips and drinking cola while reading a novel.The most respected player in the world, the player that everyone aspires to be like\u2026Deok-gu thought, \u2018Is it okay for someone like him to have that honor?\u2019 After letting out a deep sigh, he approached Jun-ho.\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d\u201cHuh? It\u2019s a novel where the main character is a priest, but all he does is swing his sword around instead of healing.\u201dTN: This is a reference to another LN by the same author, \u201cPresident of Healing: Sun\u2019s Priest\u201d\u201cWhat a crazy-ass priest.\u201dTaking a seat on the sofa directly opposite him, Deok-gu tapped his Vita, holographically displaying a few documents.\u201cTake a look at these. They\u2019re the stuff that you asked for.\u201d\u201cOho?\u201dJun-ho\u2019s eyes glimmered as he lowered his book.Flap!\u00a0He closed his book and sat upright, reading the digital documents floating in front of him.\u201cDamn. They\u2019re all what I asked for! You really are good at your job.\u201dDeok-gu felt conflicted while watching his friend who appeared happy.\u201cNo need for compliments. Tell me why you needed this data instead. You\u2019re not planning on raiding them, right?\u201cOf course I\u2019m raiding them. Why would I waste time researching them if I wasn\u2019t planning on entering?\u201d\u201cWhat?! But\u2026\u201dDeok-gu quickly skimmed through the displayed documents. They were information on all the \u2018Uncleared Gates\u2019 that people haven\u2019t been able to clear during the last 25 years.\u201c\u2026You\u2026 you know what it means to be \u2018uncleared\u2019, right?\u201d\u201cA mistake inside a gate equals death. You think I wouldn\u2019t know such a basic fact?\u201dPlayers that have gone inside Uncleared Gates died without even leaving behind a corpse.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. They\u2019re still low-level, easy-ass gates.\u201d\u201cI guess they don\u2019t even have any stars yet\u2026\u201d\u201cStars? What are you talking about?\u201dJun-ho\u2019s question made Deok-gu exclaim, \u201cOh, right!\u201d\u201cI forgot. This is something that became a thing while you were asleep.\u201dDeok-gu tried to explain it as simple and fast as possible. Stars. They were given to a gate everytime over 10,000 players died inside it. This idea started 17 years ago, and a total of 14 gates have received stars so far.\u201cUp till now, there hasn\u2019t been a gate where more than 20,000 people have died, so 1-star is the highest rating a gate has ever received. A total of 11 of them have been cleared so far. The remaining 3 gates are called \u2018the 3 Great Uncleared Gates of the World.\u2019\u201cWait a sec. Haven\u2019t I cleared a few gates with over 10k deaths before?\u201dWhile he was Specter, there were a few gates with over 10k player casualties. They were gates that were far more common in overpopulated countries like China and India.\u201cI think I cleared 3\u2026 no, 4 of them?\u201cThat\u2019s right. Publicly, Specter has obtained 4 stars. Does that give you a feel for the strength of 1-star gates?\u201d\u201cYep. So you guys call them 1-star gates now. They were clearly different from the other gates.\u201dCompared to other gates, the boss monsters that appeared in them were on another level. The 1-star gates that Jun-ho remembered were places like that.\u201cWait, if I only have 4 stars, does that mean the Frost Queen\u2019s Nest had no stars?\u201d\u201cOf course. She never killed 10,000 people. You guys were the first challengers of the Nest,\u201d Deok-gu said shrugging his shoulders.\u201cThe current 9 greatest players, a.k.a the Nine Heavens, all have at least 1 star.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What a childish nickname, calling people Heavens.\u201d\u201cHaha, are you jealous?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean jealous.\u201dJun-ho replied with a pout. Deok-gu continued while thinking how cute his friend was.\u201cAnyways, you\u2019re still just level 1. Even if they don\u2019t have any stars, I think Uncleared Gates are too risky for you.\u201d\u201cDeok-gu, have you ever heard of this saying?\u201dJun-ho lifted his chin, made a cocky face, and spread his arms wide onto the sofa.\u201cForm is Temporary, Class is Permanent.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you not embarrassed saying that about yourself?\u201d\u201cNope. It\u2019s the truth. Why should I be embarrassed?\u201dIf he wasn\u2019t sure he could clear it, he would have never attempted them. To Jun-ho, hunting was the one thing he was always cold and analytical about\u2014never letting his emotions sway him.\u201cWhat are you so worried about? Besides, aren\u2019t Uncleared Gates a pain for the association as well?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t want to send my friend somewhere dangerous.\u201d\u201cAigo*.\u201dTN: Korean equivalent of Haiya.Jun-ho couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh, seeing his friend having grown old and full of worries.\u201cI know this is supposed to be a touching moment, but I\u2019m going because it\u2019s beneficial to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026beneficial? Beneficial how?\u201d\u201cThe longer a gate goes uncleared, the more EXP it gives as a reward.\u201dGates that haven\u2019t been cleared for years end up accumulating a ton of EXP.\u201cSo what, you want to go into an Uncleared Gate just so you can level up quicker?\u201d\u201cBecause that\u2019s the fastest way for me to level up.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you just safely grow stronger by raiding normal gates? With your skills, your growth rate shouldn\u2019t be slow at all.\u201d\u201cNot being slow isn\u2019t enough.\u201dJun-ho looked at Deok-gu with a serious face.\u201cAs long as the fiends are after me, time is not on my side.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I need to level up as fast as possible.\u201dHe needed to become strong at least to the point that he could fight back even if his identity gets exposed.The only people who can go up to the 2nd floor, the Frontier, are players above level 30.Getting to level 30 as fast as possible was Jun-ho\u2019s current goal. Having heard Jun-ho\u2019s honest words, Deok-ku nodded with a heavy expression.\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t think that far. I didn\u2019t realize you were feeling so much pressure.\u201dI wouldn\u2019t call it pressure.To be honest, he just wanted to beat up the fiends that were after him, not knowing their place. However, Jun-ho had no plans of correcting his friend who thought he became more mature.\u201cThen the first gate you could enter\u2026\u201dLooking at the documents in front of him, Deok-gu\u2019s brows frowned.\u201cOh no, there\u2019s only one Uncleared Gate for a level 1.\u201dIt was a monstrous gate that swallowed up a total of 142 players since it appeared 7 years ago. Since only \u2018Level 1\u2019 players could enter, people call it the \u2018Novice\u2019s Grave\u2019. Even the name of the gate gave people the creeps.\u201cThe Curse of Dawn.\u201dJun-ho shrugged after reading the name of the gate.\u201cThe name honestly makes me think that zombies might appear.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way to know until you go in. The clear condition is to survive until sunrise.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re always too confident\u2026\u201dHowever, Deok-gu could never blame Jun-ho, since he had the skills to back up his confidence.Deok-gu took a card out of his coat pocket and handed it to Jun-ho.\u201cHere\u2019s your sign up bonus.\u201dIt was the money he received by signing a contract with the Player Association. As soon as Jun-ho took the card, Deok-gu grinned super wide.\u201cFrom today on, you\u2019ll be my underling for a year.\u201d\u201cYou think it\u2019s funny? Wanna get bossed around by your underling?\u201dA 200 million won* signing bonus, an annual salary of 1.5 billion won*, and even additional rewards and benefits for gate clears. Those were the terms of the contract that Seo Jun-ho signed, terms never heard of before for a newbie.TN: Approx $175k / $1.3M\u201cRight. For your housing, what if you resided here in the Player Association building for now? We have a residential area for association players here.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea. It would guarantee my safety.\u201dThere were over 100 players that lived in the Association building. And a magic barrier covered the entire building. Unless one was beyond batshit crazy, one could never even dream of attacking here. Jun-ho quickly made a decision after taking all the factors into account.\u201cI guess I\u2019ll live here, but make sure to give me a room with a view.\u201d\u201cAs you wish. If you do well, I\u2019ll even give you a whole floor.\u201d\u201cI look forward to it.\u201d\u201cBy the way\u2026\u201dDeok-gu carried over a huge box from the corner of the room. Wiping the sweat from his forehead, he signaled Jun-ho with his eyes.\u201cOpen it up. It\u2019s your armor.\u201d\u201cArmor?\u201dFilled with expectation, Jun-ho opened the box right away. Inside the box, there was a leather armor set. Leather armor was always his armor of choice, so he quickly picked it up.\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s light?\u201dAfter scratching the surface of the armor with his nails, he nodded in approval.\u201cAnd it\u2019s durable? This is way better than I expected.\u201d\u201cOf course it is. It\u2019s made by\u00a0The\u00a0Kwon Noya.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dJun-ho\u2019s eyes widened. Who was Kwon Noya? He was a world-class blacksmith who used to swing his hammer only for Specter.\u201cThat old man\u2019s still alive? Isn\u2019t he at least a hundred years old?\u201d\u201cHe turned 98 this year. He passed on his workshop to his grandson long ago, but he\u2019s still well and alive.\u201d\u201cDamn. Well, I can\u2019t just take this without showing my gratitude. I\u2019ll have to go see him in person.\u201dHe was ready to leave right away, but Deok-gu stopped him.\u201cI can\u2019t let you do that.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\u201cWe need to be cautious of everything for your own safety.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you doubting Kwon Noya right now?\u201dJun-ho sharpened his eyes. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to call Kwon Noya his first ever comrade.\u201cIt\u2019s not him that I\u2019m doubting.\u201dDeok-gu shook his head. His face was saying, \u201cHow could I ever doubt him?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the eyes of the fiends and guilds that I\u2019m cautious of.\u201d\u201c\u2026So they have eyes on the workshop.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s well-known that Specter and Kwon Noya were close.Now that Specter had returned, it was unavoidable for people to keep an eye on Noya\u2019s workshop. If Jun-ho visited the workshop and met Noya, it would raise suspicions. There weren\u2019t many people in the world that had the privilege of talking \u2018face to face\u2019 with Kwon Noya.\u201cHmm\u2026 You\u2019re right. If a novice player went to Noya\u2019s workshop\u2026 it\u2019d definitely raise a few eyebrows.\u201d\u201cI sent someone to explain the situation to Kwon Noya while they were purchasing the armor. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll understand.\u201d\u201cGood work.\u201dHe was a bit disappointed he couldn\u2019t go see him in person. Though he was a raggedy old man that complained non-stop, they shared a close bond.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019ll just have to wait until I\u2019ve leveled up a bit. Besides\u2026\u201dJun-ho looked down at his scrawny arms.That geezer, he\u2019s even better at giving a lecture than Deok-gu.If he went to the old man in his current state, he couldn\u2019t even imagine how many hours he\u2019d talk his ear off. Smirking, Jun-ho got up from his seat.\u201cThanks for the armor. What about weapons?\u201d\u201cThere are quite a few useful things in the association warehouse, so feel free to use whatever you want.\u201dAfter quenching his thirst with coffee, Deok-gu asked a really important question.\u201cSo, when do you plan on raiding the gate?\u201d\u201cOriginally, I planned on going right away, but\u2026\u201dThe evaluation changed his mind.I was so exhausted after only killing 20 dwarves.A gate, especially an Uncleared Gate, would be a much more difficult trial than fighting 20 dwarves.\u201cI might be short on time, but I should get back in shape.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good plan. How long do you think it\u2019ll take you?\u201d\u201cSince I just need to meet the bare minimum requirements\u2026\u201dJun-ho gave it a thought with his eyes closed.\u201cTen days. Let\u2019s set that as my goal.\u201dTime flew by in a flash.* * *Mount Cheonma in the city of Namyangju was just slightly shy of the safe zone. And so, 7 years ago, a gate appeared there.Screech.A self-driving taxi stopped in Mt. Cheonma\u2019s parking lot, which was located very close to the gate. From the taxi, an average looking man in his mid-20s got out.\u201cSo this is the place.\u201dThe man was Seo Jun-ho, who managed to gain a bit of weight in the last 10 days. He was still skinny, but his eyes had a new shine to them.Jun-ho stared at the 4-foot tall, blue oval in front of him.Gates.Mysterious portals that were connected to unknown worlds. Riddled with traps and monsters, you could trust nothing inside a gate.Only trust yourself.And in order to \u2018trust\u2019 yourself, you needed skills to back up that faith. He knew that better than anyone else, which is why he trained his body like a madman for the last 10 days.It was quite difficult.From the moment he woke up, until he fell asleep, he didn\u2019t stop training. He only stopped to eat for nutrients. It couldn\u2019t be helped. In order to improve his body with maximum efficiency, he had to be that rough on himself. Fortunately, the results of that hell-like training were satisfactory.[Seo Jun-ho]Level : 1Title : The One Who Opens SpringSTR : 25\u00a0STA \u00a0 : 27SPD : 31\u00a0MAG : 18Though he wasn\u2019t able to raise his Magic stat, he was able to raise his Strength from 21 to 25, Stamina from 24 to 27, and his Speed from 26 to 31.It\u2019s best to raise your stats as much as possible before you start growing.That was because it became increasingly harder to increase your stats from basic training as you level up.\u201cNow, shall I head in?\u201dAn empty parking lot. A parked self-driving taxi.\u201cMeow.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euAnd a stray cat.That was everyone that witnessed Seo Jun-ho\u2019s entry into the Uncleared Gate, \u27eaCurse of Dawn\u27eb.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of the Frozen PlayerCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Curse of Dawn (2)Step, step.As Seo Jun-ho took a step into the blue oval gate, the world around him changed. Everything\u2014from the sights to even the air around him.\u201cSo it\u2019s a graveyard.\u201dHe had arrived at another world\u2019s graveyard. Not only the dirt he stood on but also the trees and grass were not of Earth.Jun-ho closed his eyes and started taking deep breaths.\u201cBreathe in\u2026 Breathe out\u2026 Breathe in\u2026 Breathe out\u2026\u201dThe air was unique and heavy, unlike any air he ever breathed on Earth. With every breath, he could feel his cells waking up. That sensation comforted Jun-ho.\u201c\u2026I must be going nuts, thinking this kind of place is cozy.\u201dAfter looking around his surroundings, Jun-ho said, \u201cGate info.\u201d That brought up a holographic window, displaying a summary of the gate.\u27eaCurse of Dawn\u27ebEntry Requirements : Level 1 and belowParty Cap : 10 peopleClear Conditions : Survive until sunriseDifficulty : AverageHmm. It\u2019s just like I researched, but this isn\u2019t a hard condition at all.It was a relatively simple condition: to survive until sunrise. Looking up at the sky, the sun was slowly setting. That was possible because time inside and outside of the gate flowed differently.\u201cI got here at the perfect time. I\u2019m glad I did my research.\u201dEven while he was busy building up his body, Jun-ho did not slack off on researching this gate. As a result, he found out that the party that entered early in the morning survived the longest. That\u2019s why he purposely arrived at the gate in the morning.\u201cParties that came in the afternoon probably struggled quite a bit.\u201dThe moment a player clears their first gate, they become level 2. In contrast, this gate\u2019s entry requirement was level 1 and below. That meant that everyone who entered this gate were brand-new novices that had never entered a gate before.And if novices had to start fighting as soon as they arrive at a foreign environment\u2026Their loss was inevitable. They probably didn\u2019t even get to fight at half their normal condition.\u201cI wonder how many will appear.\u201dOn the other hand, Jun-ho was perfectly prepared, ready to display more than 100% of his abilities.* * *The sun fell, and complete darkness befell the graveyard. Jun-ho contemplated while staring at the starry sky.A ghastly aura.A blood-chilling aura overflowed the graveyard. It was an aura that the undead normally radiated, and it was something that you could never forget if you ever experience it.\u201cI hate this feeling. It feels like it\u2019s sticking to my skin.\u201dLetting out a sigh, Jun-ho surveyed the graveyard with the help of the moonlight.The ground bathed in moonlight started shaking.Crack, smash!Dozens of hands started piercing through the dirt.\u201cI had my doubts, but it really was zombies.\u201dJun-ho unenthusiastically drew his sword. The moment one could easily kill a zombie was right now.\u201cNo, no. You don\u2019t have to get up. Just stay the fuck dead.\u201dStab, stab!Jun-ho cleanly pierced the heads of the zombies that were crawling out from the ground. Zombies were known for being hard to kill, but even they couldn\u2019t move if their brains were destroyed.\u2026\u2026I can\u2019t see exactly how many, but there\u2019s quite a few of them.It was during nighttime when humans lost a lot of visibility. That\u2019s why most players disliked nights inside of gates. However, no matter where you went, there was always an exception to the rule.[Night has come. Hunter\u2019s Night(A) has been activated.][All stats increase by 10%.][All your senses have been enhanced.]That exception was Seo Jun-ho. A player who could win day or night. It was one of the reasons why he was called the Undefeated Player.\u201cAh. I can finally see properly.\u201dAs part of\u00a0 his enhanced senses, his vision also improved. The silhouettes that were only barely visible thanks to the moonlight became clear as day.\u201cDamn. There\u2019s a lot of \u2018em.\u201dLooking at the dozens of corpses charging at him, Jun-ho smirked.* * *In the graveyard blessed by moonlight, an untimely party was ongoing. Except, unlike a normal party, there was neither exciting music nor fireworks. Instead, the sounds of zombie\u2019s heads rolling was the symphony, and the blood spraying everywhere was the fireworks.\u2013 \u201cGu-uhhhh.\u201d\u2013 \u201cUuu-uhhhh.\u201dDealing with zombies was not as easy as they made it seem to be in the movies. To start with, they were much faster than your average adult.These guys don\u2019t even bother defending themselves.Zombies didn\u2019t care about losing their arms or legs. Because they can\u2019t feel any pain, they could focus all their strength on attacking. They\u2019re the worst kind of monsters for a novice\u2014inexperienced with killing\u2014to face.\u201cI feel bad for you guys. I\u2019m a super-novice.\u201dThe zombies\u2019 attacks couldn\u2019t even scrape Jun-ho. Zombies had a simple attack pattern, only knowing how to charge and bite. To Jun-ho, they were nothing more than moving punching bags.\u201cThis sword from the association is pretty decent.\u201dSlash!The swords that the association provided to players were of higher quality than he expected. Thanks to that, it didn\u2019t take much force to slice the zombies\u2019 heads.Everytime the sword shined in the moonlight, a zombie\u2019s head flew into the sky.But there really are a fuckton of them.He counted at least 40 of them. Even the great Seo Jun-ho wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid a bite if he was surrounded on all sides with no room to swing his sword.And if I get bit, it\u2019ll be the end of me.That\u2019s why he did all he could to never let a zombie get behind him.Bang! Bang-bang!As soon as 3 zombies passed by him, Jun-ho, without even looking at them, pulled the trigger on his monster-grade Glock 17.The zombies\u2019 heads popped like water balloons.\u2013 \u201cGu-uuuuh.\u201dI\u2019m glad I\u2019m against zombies.Starting with Orcs, you had to imbue your bullets with magic in order to pierce their hard skin. However, rotting corpses didn\u2019t require magical bullets. That\u2019s why experienced players weren\u2019t afraid of zombies. Because they didn\u2019t know fear, zombies made the \u2018best soldiers,\u2019 but they could never be the \u2018best weapon\u2019.\u201cTo be the best weapon, you need to be able to kill any enemy.\u201dThe moment zombies faced an opponent far stronger than them, their value disappeared.Like right now.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dJun-ho glimpsed at his watch.3 hours. That\u2019s how long it\u2019s been since the battle started. There were only four zombies remaining.\u201cCome at me already. I just wanna go home and shower.\u201d\u2013 \u201cGu-uhhhhh.\u201dDid one of them understand him? A zombie with an incredibly stinky breath charged at him. Finding the stench unpleasant, Jun-ho placed the barrel of the gun directly onto his chin.\u201cMake sure you brush properly in your next life.\u201dBANG!Before even checking if the zombie died, he spun around with his sword.Slice!\u2013 \u201cGu-uhh\u2026\u201d\u2013 \u201cUh\u2026?\u201dAfter cutting off the heads of two zombies in a clean horizontal line, the sword flew out of Jun-ho\u2019s hand.Fwoosh! Thump!The sword pierced through the zombie\u2019s head\u2014right between its brows\u2014and the sword still had so much force left that it flew into a tree behind the zombie. The zombie with a hole in it\u2019s head twitched a few times before flopping dead.\u201cFinally.\u201dAfter retrieving his sword from the tree, he wiped the blood off his weapon while looking around the now quiet graveyard.If he hadn\u2019t brought the pistol, things would have been quite the hassle. A horde of over 50 zombies continuously crept out of the ground at him.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmm.\u201dThinking that something was off, he pulled up the status window. The gate hasn\u2019t even been cleared yet, but he already leveled up twice.Coming to an Uncleared Gate was the right decision.While he was patting himself on the back, he heard a voice from somewhere, \u201cIs\u2026 Is someone there?\u201dThe smile waned off Jun-ho\u2019s face immediately.A voice?It was a woman\u2019s voice. A trembling voice, gasping for air, soon to be cut off anytime. And she was speaking Korean of all languages.\u201cWhere are you!?\u201d\u201cA-A person\u2026? Here! I\u2019m over here!\u00a0Sob, sob, thank you so much\u2026\u201dOne could hear the strong conviction to survive in her voice. With the last of her breath, she kept notifying Jun-ho of her location.\u201cIs this where you\u2019re at?\u201d\u201cYes, yes\u2026 I\u2019m right below\u2026\u201dA grave at the edge of the graveyard. The voice was coming from underground.\u201cGive me a moment.\u201dJun-ho started digging up the grave with his bare hands. He uncovered a dark brown coffin made of wood.\u201cSo you came inside the gate two days ago with your friends?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 We heard that we could make it big if we conquered an Uncleared Gate\u2026\u00a0Sob, sob.\u201d\u201cOh my, that was rash of you guys.\u201dClicking his tongue, Jun-ho showed his remorse.\u201cI can\u2019t hear you well, so could I ask for you to yell really loudly?\u201d\u201cYell\u2026 why?\u201d\u201cPlease just do this for me.\u201dAfter hesitating, the lady inside the coffin yelled at the top of her lungs.\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cThat should be enough.\u201dMaking a eureka face, he mumbled to himself.\u201cSo that\u2019s where the head is.\u201dHe quickly drew his pistol and indiscriminately fired in the direction of the voice.Bang! Bang, bang, bang, bang!After emptying an entire magazine, Jun-ho drew his sword as \u2018something\u2019 that was dripping blood crawled out from the battered coffin.\u2013 \u201cGu-ugh\u2026\u00a0How\u2026 did you know\u2026?\u201dThe wretched smelling monster appeared dejected. It couldn\u2019t be helped. While facing hundreds of players for the last 7 years, not once did they discover its identity.Jun-ho pointed the tip of his sword at the head of the monster that was screaming in pain.\u201cI don\u2019t trust others easily, especially inside a gate.\u201dPhugh!The sword easily pierced the monster\u2019s head like a knife through butter. Staring at the limp corpse, Jun-ho chortled.\u201cThere\u2019s no way there\u2019d be a survivor inside a gate.\u201dAs long as even a single player was alive, a closed gate never opened up. Even if they were novices, the players that succumbed to this monster probably knew that as well.However, there was a stark difference between simply knowing something and always keeping it in mind.After wiping out the zombie horde, Jun-ho knew something was off.50 zombies is definitely a big threat, but it\u2019s not something 10 players wouldn\u2019t be able to handle.However, the gate hadn\u2019t been cleared for a whopping 7 years. That was what put Jun-ho on alert.It all adds up with the existence of the Tricker.Trickers are much stronger than zombies, and they can even absorb the memories of the creatures they ate. The reason he was able to speak such fluent Korean is because of all the Korean players he devoured.\u201cPretty cunning for a monster. You even hid yourself inside a coffin to hide your stench.\u201dUnfortunately for the Tricker, he died without being able to put up any resistance because he was hiding in the coffin.Ding. A system message popped up.[All hostile monsters have been killed.][You have achieved the clear conditions in a roundabout fashion.][You have successfully cleared \u27eaCurse of Dawn\u27eb.][You have leveled up.][You have leveled up.][All your stats have increased by 2.][You have regained 4 Magic stats.]The EXP gained from an Uncleared Gate was massive. On top of that, he also regained some of his lost stats.So I regain my lost stats every 5 levels? That\u2019s not a lot but\u2026Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt least it was something. Jun-ho was satisfied that he got back some of the magic that he needed more than anything else, but it was clearly not enough for him. His eyes twinkled, wanting something more.\u201cThis isn\u2019t all of it, right? That\u2019d be pretty lackluster for an Uncleared Gate.\u201dWith flawless timing, additional messages popped up as soon as he said that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was confused, but rather than be disappointed, he broke into a grin.I got a new skill right away. Isn\u2019t my luck too good?He wouldn\u2019t mind being wrong a hundred times if he received a reward like this.He studied the skill\u2019s description.[Confession of the Dead]Rank : CEffect : Allows you to look into the memories of the target. Only works on dead lifeforms.\u201c\u2026It lets me look into the memories of the dead?\u201dLike psychometry, it was likely one of the \u2018memory-reading\u2019 skills, but the conditions were much stricter.So, I can read the memories of the target, but they have to be dead.He could see it being useful to him in the future, but it wasn\u2019t a versatile skill. Suddenly, he realized why the Gate had dropped such a skill.The Tricker.The Tricker was a monster that could steal the memories of a dead target, and Gates tended to drop rewards related to the monsters within it.\u201cI\u2019ll have to do some research to see how I can best use it.\u201dMost importantly, with this, he was starting to acquire new skills that Specter didn\u2019t have.\u201cWill I get stronger than before\u2026?\u201dHe could barely imagine such a future. He looked up at the bright night sky with a small smile, wanting a cold beer.***No matter where you go, there will always be people who do the opposite of what you do.Choi Man-deuk of Namyangju (37, single, male) was one of those people.(TN: Namyangju is a city in Gyeongi Province).\u201cHoho, hiking is great for your health. I don\u2019t know why they won\u2019t let us go up the mountain.\u201dAfter the Gate in Cheonma Mountain had appeared, the Association immediately warned the citizens in the area. However, it was impossible to seal it off completely in such a large area. Some careless people had snuck up the mountain and found an open path.\u201cKeuhh,\u00a0the air here is sweet. Sweet, I tell you!\u201dChoi Man-deuk had come at dawn to taste the early-morning air. He wiped the sweat off his face with a towel and paused as he saw the Gate in the corner of his eye.Still, I should be careful about getting too close to the Gate\u2026He made his way back to the tree at the entrance, then looked back up.\u201cHuh?\u201dHis throat went dry.\u201cWhat? The Gate is usually over there\u2026 Why can\u2019t I see it?\u201dDid it become an Open Gate after being left alone for so long?Choi Man-deuk considered this, a chill climbing up his back. He shook his head to himself.No way. If it had really become an Open Gate, the Association would have warned us already.Then why wasn\u2019t the Gate there?Choi Man-deuk swallowed and slowly made his way to where the Gate had been.

You don\u2019t need anything else, do you?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s one thing.\u201d Seo Jun-ho waved the schedule in his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s only one Uncleared Gate left in the country.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a good thing?\u201d\u201cFrom a national standpoint, yes. But after I clear it, I won\u2019t have anywhere else to hunt.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 How about I look into some foreign Gates?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.

For that reason, many parties had attempted it.For a total of 124 attempts, there were 124 failures, and 0 successes.Leuf\u2019s Garden refused to fall to the hands of the humans.So that\u2019s why they decided to do that.\u00a0He continued to read through the articles.In the past, the Korean Player Association had declared that there weren\u2019t enough qualified players to challenge Uncleared Gates and came to a decision during a conference.In the end, they hired India\u2019s rising star, Tushar Vishi, with the prize money.According to what he read, his abilities were amazing. But Seo Jun-ho was still unconvinced, so he watched a few videos of his training.He\u2019s good.\u00a0His form was perfect, and he shot arrows with amazing speed.\u00a0If he had continued to grow like that, he would have surpassed Green.But he\u2019d failed, and that failure brought upon his death.He was 22 years old with a bright future ahead of him, and not a trace of him was left behind.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\u201d It was still a sore spot for both Korea and India.Seo Jun-ho closed his eyes and sorted out his thoughts before he reached for the spear leaning against the wall.\u201cI should bring this.\u201d The spear was a cheat weapon that could dominate a battlefield if a perimeter around the user was established.The Leufs probably have shield skills and a large attack area.\u00a0A sword wouldn\u2019t have enough reach, and bullets wouldn\u2019t be able to pierce through their hide.\u201cStatus window.\u201d[Seo Jun-ho]Level: 5Title: The One Who Opens SpringStrength: 30\u00a0Stamina: 31Speed: 35\u00a0Magic: 26Except for Magic, all of his stats were 30 and over now.With these stats, I\u2019m stronger than most people who are level 10.\u00a0He was likely the strongest level 5 player in the world right now.

I don\u2019t think any guild would ever treat one of their members like this.\u201d\u201cAin\u2019t that right. Did the Association lose their marbles or something? How dare they send such a youngster to an Uncleared Gate by himself?\u201d\u2026\u2026Ah.After watching the reporters\u2019 3rd-rate acting, Jun-ho finished connecting all the dots. He could clearly tell what article they wanted to write.I see. So they want to write an article about the Association forcibly sending in a player to an Uncleared Gate.A Gate was a bomb of sorts. If people didn\u2019t regularly enter it, it would forcibly Open Gate. It was a phenomenon where monsters inside the Gate overflowed into the outside world.Safe Zones prevented the appearances of Gates. It didn\u2019t protect people from monster attacks.That\u2019s why Uncleared Gates were a pain in the ass for the Association. It\u2019s not like they could just force unwilling people to enter them. That\u2019s why these tabloid journalists kept spreading conspiracies.It\u2019s a conspiracy that will be on all the front pages if they can just obtain conclusive evidence.The Association that should be protecting the rights of players is sending them to their doom? Even if it was just rumors, if it circulated enough, it would be enough cause for guilds to tear the Association apart.Tabloid parasites will never change, huh.Not caring about facts, they only care about exciting gossip. The title of \u2018journalist\u2019 is too good for them. Their articles had no ethics nor any objectivity. Since long ago, Jun-ho refused to recognize these scum as \u2018real journalists.\u2019Jun-ho brushed aside the reporter\u2019s hand off his shoulder, and he mumbled in a blood-chilling tone. \u201cThere should be a limit to how much of a disgrace you can be as journalists.\u201dJun-ho massaged his neck, feeling drained before he even got to enter the Gate.\u201cCome on. Just spit it out. What did the Association tell you before sending you here?\u201d\u201cYou keep pleading the fifth. Is that because you\u2019re facing pressure from the Association?\u201dWithout giving him any room, the reporters swung their mics in front of his face, annoying the hell out of him. Unable to take it anymore, Jun-ho finally snapped.\u201cHey, fucking scram.\u201d\u201c\u2026Wh-what?\u201dThe reporters were shocked by his sudden swearing. No matter how famous of a player someone was, they never made enemies out of the media. With only a few exceptions, star players were all created by the media.\u201cD-did you actually just say \u2018fucking scram\u2019 to us reporters, the voice of the people?\u201d\u201cSeriously? I treat you like a brother and this is what I get?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that you can get cancelled if you act like this?! Huh?!\u201dAngry reporters, not knowing their place, yelled and glared at him.\u201cReporters? I don\u2019t see any reporters in front of me.\u201dWhen Jun-ho exuded killing intent, the reporters all flinched. Though his stats were at rock bottom, he was still someone who had faced all sorts of life-threatening trials. His killing intent was not something keyboard warrior office pigs could handle.Uhh\u2026 How can he have such a look in his eyes\u2026I might end up dying for a story at this rate.Is this guy an actual psychopath?The reporters had no choice but to turn tail and slowly back away. They could see the immeasurable irritation in Jun-ho\u2019s face.\u201cThese nobodies are really pissing me off.\u201dHe could never imagine a reporter spouting bullshit in front of him, nor asking Specter for his identification. To be more precise, some idiots tried that and ended up bankrupting their news organization after worldwide criticism.Ahh, I miss the old days.Jun-ho sighed at his current pathetic condition before entering the Gate.Woooom.The reporters all snapped out of it when the Gate\u2019s color shifted from blue to red.\u201c\u2026N-no way.\u201d\u201cA red Gate means\u2026 that it\u2019s really locked, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cSo he actually went in? Without even leaving any last words?\u201dTheir faces gradually changed from shock to anger.\u201cThat fucking disrespectful greenhorn!\u201d\u201cI-isn\u2019t he a real son of a bitch?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t the people have a right to hear about this? Player Seo Jun-ho\u2019s true self!\u201d\u201cHow dare he glare and speak to his elders like that\u2026 Let me tell you, back in my day\u2026!\u201dAfter having a swear fest, one of the reporters started packing up his belongings.\u201cI\u2019m gonna call it a day.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh? But hyung-nim*, are you really going without seeing the results?\u201d(TN: Hyung-nim is a Korean honorific used by men to refer to older males in a respectful manner.)\u201cDo you really think it\u2019s worth seeing? Why? You think such a degenerate piece of shit can actually clear that Gate?\u201dAfter cackling, the reporter pointed towards the Gate.\u201cThat guy. He\u2019s for sure gonna die in there. So why should I wait up?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 It\u2019s an Uncleared Gate, so his chances of clearing it is extremely slim.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s not slim. There\u2019s zip. Nada. I\u2019m telling you, the chief editor is going to agree with me.\u201dSold on his logic, the reporters started packing up their belongings. Their mood had also been soured by Jun-ho making a mockery of them.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we have some gukbap* at a rest stop on our way home?\u201d(TN: Gukbap literally means soup(guk) and rice(bap). It\u2019s a popular, wide category of Korean food.)\u201cSounds good. I think this shitty feeling also calls for a drink.\u201dThe reporters each got in their vehicles and started driving off the curvy rural road. The last reporter to remain looked back towards the Gate before getting in his car.But, what happens if he actually succeeds in clearing the Gate while none of us are present?He tried to think things through. If this guy named Seo Jun-ho actually managed to clear the Gate, he would never get another chance to personally point a mic at him. Because by then, he\u2019d be a super rookie that is at the center of everyone\u2019s attention.Cutting his daydream short, the reporter snickered. \u201cNah, this isn\u2019t some light novel.\u201dSure that it would never happen, he also got in his car.* * *\u201cThis is pretty,\u201d said Jun-ho.It was his first impression of Leuf\u2019s Garden. It was a garden that rivaled The Huntington Library Botanical Gardens in America. Flowers of all kinds were in full bloom.It was an objectively astonishing sight, yet Jun-ho said the following, \u201cSuch pretty trash.\u201dAnyone who was ignorant of Leufs would refute his claim. They\u2019d exclaim, \u2018How can you call such pretty flowers trash?\u2019However, when the sun goes down, these flowers turn into the worst kind of monster. They were monsters derived from flowers called Leufs.Woosh, swoosh.Jun-ho swung around his spear as a warm up.\u201cCompared to the spear I used to use\u2026 it\u2019s pretty crappy.\u201dThat was unavoidable. His favorite spear was a Unique-grade weapon. Compared to his old spear, this one not only had a very plain design, but the weight was also slightly off-center. Though Jun-ho did have a tendency to use whatever weapon, he still couldn\u2019t call this spear \u2018decent.\u2019\u201cMaybe I just have too high a standard.\u201dAfter pompously talking to himself, he spun the spear around in a flashy maneuver. After practicing for two days, he had gotten well used to the spear\u2019s weight.\u201cGate info.\u201d\u27eaLeuf\u2019s Garden\u27ebEntry Requirements : Level 5~10Party Cap : 4 peopleClear Conditions : Eliminate all monstersDifficulty : Difficult\u201cHmm.\u201dLeuf\u2019s Garden was a Gate that allowed up to four players per party. So, Jun-ho was the first person to ever enter this Gate by himself.Even the super rookie from India brought 3 teammates.If they were acquainted, they should have worked well as a team. But the fact that they still failed meant that there is a dangerous trap hidden in this Gate.\u201cAnd that\u2019s probably\u2026\u201dJun-ho\u2019s eyes drifted beyond the garden. He spotted a maze with 3m-tall walls made of branches and vines.There\u2019s probably a trap hidden there.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euWithout stepping on any of the flowers, Jun-ho walked down the dirt path, sitting down at the gazebo in the center of the garden. Now, he just had to wait patiently until the Leufs woke up.\u201cI\u2019m glad I bought some e-books.\u201dLaying down on the bench, Jun-ho started reading a novel that was saved into his Vita. He continued to read peacefully until the sun set.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing the sun was down, Seo Jun-ho turned off his Vita and got up.\u201cYawn.\u00a0It\u2019s about time now.\u201dLeufs were monsters with the appearance of a flower, but anatomically, they were the complete opposite of a flower.To start with, the beautiful petals were on their feet with the stem pointing upwards. And the thick and tough stems coiled together into a humanoid form. That was the monster called Leuf.\u201cIn a dark night like today, I swear they look just like people.\u201dThat was why their nickname was Flower Ghost.[Night has come. \u2018Hunter\u2019s Night(A)\u2019 has been activated.][All stats increase by 10%.][All your senses have been enhanced.]With his sharpened senses, Jun-ho closed his eyes and honed in on his hearing. It was time to test the results of his training.Crrrk, crack.He heard the ground behind him shift.During the day, Leufs burrowed themselves into the ground and attracted their prey by keeping only the flowers above ground. That\u2019s why Jun-ho only walked on the dirt path, avoiding the flowers.If you carelessly walk around a Leuf, you\u2019ll find yourself tied up by vines and pulled into the ground in an instant.He wasn\u2019t safe because it was nighttime. On the contrary, when the moon shone, they came out from the ground to actively hunt their prey.\u201cLeufs. They have high defense thanks to their hard and tough vines, but\u2026\u201dThey were slow and had a clear weakness. The flowers on their feet. That was the weakness of a Leuf.\u201cOnly two of \u2018em? What a lukewarm greeting.\u201dJun-ho still had his eyes closed, but his razor-sharp senses told him everything that was going on.One to the left, another on the right.After getting a full picture of his surroundings, he grabbed both ends of the spear before charging towards his left.Crack, wha-cha!A Leuf swung its arms like a whip towards the human charging at it.It\u2019s coming.Feeling the flow of air change in front of him, he stuck the spear into the ground and jumped high like an olympic athlete.Woooosh!With a single jump, Jun-ho obtained two strategic advantages. One, he perfectly avoided the Leuf\u2019s attack. And two\u20261.5 meters.He secured the optimal distance for his spear. And the Leuf had an opening in his defense from having just attacked.Fwoosh!Jun-ho spun his body around, sweeping the ground with his spear.Shash!\u00a0The Leuf got one of its legs torn apart, making it lose balance.Now.With all his might, Jun-ho slammed into the Leuf\u2019s chest with his shoulder.\u00a0Thump!\u00a0The Leuf fell, making a heavy sound.Is it about two steps back?Step, step.Jun-ho casually took a few steps back. And right on cue, the knife-like arm of the Leuf swung right across the spot he was just standing on.I\u2019m in tip-top shape today.With a super-wide smile, Jun-ho shifted his grip on the spear to the center of the pole. At the same time, he heated up his magic circuit.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can control the power output. It\u2019s my first time using it in real combat.\u201dBefore he even finished his sentence, the temperature around him started dropping.K-kk-crack!A Frost energy coated the tip of Jun-ho\u2019s spear as he opened his eyes back up, finally adjusted to the dark.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJun-ho stared at his spear.It looks exactly like the one the Frost Queen used.That was unavoidable. The skill he was using was a power he obtained from the Frost Queen.\u201cWhat an odd feeling.\u201dIt was hard to verbalize the feeling of fighting with the skill of an opponent who he fought to the death.That\u2019s enough sentimentality. Time to check this baby\u2019s firepower.He tested out the Frost skill in the training center plenty of times. However, he never tried it out against an actual monster before. So, this would be the first time he would be seeing the actual strength of the Frost skill.Pheeew!The Leuf that had fallen to the floor shot its arm out without any warning. Jun-ho ducked down a bit, barely avoiding the attack.Tchew!\u00a0The Leuf\u2019s attack clipped a few strands of his hair. In the same instant, his biceps tensed up.\u201cHeave ho!\u201dHe thrusted the spear with great force, piercing through the air.K-kk-crack! Shatter!He attacked twice with the spear in rapid succession, perfectly hitting the Leuf\u2019s flower on its feet. The petals froze the instant it came into contact with the frost spear, and the second hit completely shattered the flower into countless ice crystals.\u2013 \u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dUnable to make any noise, the Leuf thrashed in pain. It flapped around like a fish on a cutting board before going limp.[You have defeated a Leuf.]\u201c\u2026\u2026It died? Already?\u201dJun-ho couldn\u2019t believe it. He did attack its weak point, but Leufs were creatures famed for being hard to kill due to their toughness. But it died after just two hits?Jun-ho looked back at his spear, which radiated a blood-chilling energy.Isn\u2019t this\u2026 A little too effective?Freezing then smashing it. It was the most effective method for breaking the flowers.But I don\u2019t think I can continuously use this.The short battle just now had already drained a fifth of his magic.Let\u2019s try using slightly less magic this time.That would decrease the power a bit, but it would extend the active time of the skill.After collecting his thoughts, he looked at the remaining Leuf. It slowly walked over to Jun-ho with both its arms coiled into a sharp weapon.\u201cDouble spears? That\u2019s pretty cool!\u201dAs if it liked Jun-ho\u2019s approval, the Leuf shot both of its sharp arms towards him.Woosh, woosh!\u00a0Jun-ho gently spun his spear, blocking the Leuf\u2019s attack.Kling, klang!Though the Leuf possessed a sharper weapon, Jun-ho was far more proficient at combat.The failed attack made the Leuf pull its arms back and retreat a bit. Jun-ho didn\u2019t miss that opportunity. He slid his hand down the spear, gripping the bottom of the pole. By adding momentum through a spin, he swung the spear like a bat.Crack!The spear hit the temple of the Leuf, letting out a loud noise akin to chopping wood.\u201cWow. That\u2019s impressive.\u201dA normal person would have died from that strike, but the Leuf simply shrugged it off. However, the attack did anger the Leuf, making it violently thrash its viney arms around.Too slow.Leufs were extremely tough monsters, but there\u2019s no way a strike to the head would leave it unharmed. Its attacks have gotten much slower.After dodging the attacks with some light footwork, Jun-ho unleashed a counterattack.K-kk-crack!He swung the spear, hitting the Leuf\u2019s temple in the exact same spot.\u201cA flower also dies when its stem gets snapped.\u201dAgain and again, he repeatedly hit the Leuf\u2019s temple with his spear.Crack, crack, kk-crack!Unable to withstand the impact any longer, the Leuf\u2019s head got chopped in half.[You have defeated a Leuf.]After his extended battle with the Leuf, he observed his surroundings, still tense.\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s what I thought. There\u2019s no way it would end after just two of them. It\u2019s an Uncleared Gate, after all.\u201dThud, thump.Four new Leufs burrowed out from the ground, slowly walking towards him.A monster wave.It referred to a phenomenon where monsters appeared non-stop like a wave.\u201cI wonder. How many waves will crash ashore this time?\u201dWoosh, fwoosh.Jun-ho casually spun his spear around, waiting for the Leufs to get closer. He had yet to even break a single sweat.In the garden swallowed up by darkness, a horde of mysterious creatures chased someone.An attack from the left, three from the back, two from the front\u2026Surrounded, Jun-ho became irritated after confirming all the attacks headed towards him.\u201cFucking stop already, you bastards!\u201dFinally caving into his anger, he swore loudly as he swung his spear with his right arm and raised his left arm.Ch-ch-chuk!In an instant, a thick ice shield formed on his left arm, blocking the barrage of attacks from the Leufs.Cra-ack!The ice shield blocked a total of twelve attacks before it shattered into pieces.\u201cKugh.\u201dTaking advantage of the smokescreen created by the ice fragments, Jun-ho focused his magic onto his legs, boosting himself off the ground. It was uncharacteristic of him, always preaching the importance of using your magic conservatively, but that was how dire the situation was.Fwoosh!In his landing spot, there were Leufs, ready to shower him in a flurry of sharp attacks. He tried to avoid it to the best of his abilities, but his left shoulder was grazed while his right hip started bleeding.\u201cWhat kind of a bullshit pattern is this?!\u201dJun-ho laughed to himself when he only saw two Leufs appear at first. When four Leufs appeared after that, he even put on a goofy smile. However, he felt that things were amiss when eight Leufs popped up.There\u2019s no way they\u2019re doubling every time I clear a wave, right? Pssh, that\u2019d be ridiculous.But reality was a cruel mistress. His bad premonition hit the bullseye.\u201cGoddammit. Why am I always right about these things.\u201dOn the 4th wave, 16 Leufs popped up. And before he could even gather his breath, without anyone even asking for them, another 32 Leufs popped up.\u201cHuff, puff\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter two grueling hours of combat, he was completely out of breath. If he had slacked off on endurance training, his body would have turned into swiss cheese by now.I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m at the end of the rope from only fighting against Leufs. When I get back, I\u2019m doubling my training regimen.Fully on edge, Jun-ho scouted the area. Ironically, now that both his stamina and will have reached their limit, his combat sense was at its highest. As if his body was stuck in a tight space, all his senses were on maximum alert.\u201c\u2026\u2026Phew.\u201dThanks to that, he was able to empty his head of distracting thoughts, and his focus was as sharp as a pin. If he lost his focus for even a fraction of a second, he could become dead meat.It\u2019s coming.Jun-ho\u2019s body moved elegantly. With refined movements that didn\u2019t waste a single bit of stamina, he started dodging the rain-like barrage of attacks. Of course, just dodging would be uncharacteristic of him.Shwooosh!He thrusted his spear with all his speed, strength, and anger, blowing apart four Leufs\u2019s heads.\u201cKugh!\u201dAs a result, magic drained out of his body. For a moment, his face even turned white. Unfortunately for him, there were still 15 Leufs remaining.\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t stop now.\u201dIt\u2019s not like he had a choice. If he couldn\u2019t fight anymore, only death awaited him.With all his might, Jun-ho gripped the spear, which had become slippery from being drenched in sweat. It\u2019ll take time and all his stamina, but he had to take care of all these bastards.If I run away to that maze over there, it\u2019ll temporarily make my life easy, but\u2026There was no way of knowing what traps awaited him, and the maze would only give him a narrow corridor to fight the monsters. The maze was the optimal battlefield for creatures like Leufs, which had high defense and could extend their arms out to attack.I need to throw a Hail Mary.Prepared to make his final gamble, Jun-ho stomped the ground while letting out a deep breath.\u201cHi-yah!\u201dIn an instant, two-thirds of his remaining magic vanished.Ch-ch-chujuk!An ice spear that disregarded efficiency for maximum destructive force glimmered in the moonlight.30 seconds. I can\u2019t hold it any longer than that.That was the maximum amount of time he could hold this form.Racing against the clock, Jun-ho charged forward without a thought.Slash!The spear that was reinforced with the Frost skill was far sharper than your average weapon. As proof, the tip of the spear was able to cut down Leufs like they were made of tofu.Jun-ho stared down at all the attacks that were headed his way.\u2026\u2026It\u2019s impossible for me to fight while avoiding all those attacks.He was skilled enough, but he didn\u2019t have the time. He only had 25 seconds remaining\u2026 now only 24 seconds.Not wasting any time, Jun-ho made a bold decision.Sacrifice the plum tree to preserve the peach tree.It\u2019s a saying from Sun Tzu, meaning there are circumstances where short-term objectives must be sacrificed in order to gain the long-term goal.So, Jun-ho pushed forward, disregarding any non-lethal attacks.Whish! Splatter!From his arms, thighs, and back, blood spurted out like a fountain. However, his reckless charge allowed him to take down 9 Leufs in just 30 seconds.\u201cHuff\u2026 Puff, huff\u2026\u201dAny spectator would applaud his skills, but unfortunately for Jun-ho, there was no audience. Instead, he stood alone, drenched in blood and sweat from having achieved such a feat.Kk-krrk.Jun-ho placed his shaky hands on his wounds.This should stop me from losing any more blood.Only 6 enemies remaining.His breath smelled sweet, and his arms and legs wouldn\u2019t stop shaking. However, Jun-ho was not about to throw in the towel.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euI have\u2026 The One Who Opens Spring. If I can just hold out for a bit, I can win.\u27ecThe One Who Opens Spring\u27ed had the effect of increasing one\u2019s Magic and Stamina regeneration by 500%.Jun-ho gripped his spear tight once again, looking around at the Leufs that had surrounded him.\u201c\u2026\u2026Come at me.\u201dAs if they had understood his words, the 6 Leufs simultaneously launched an attack on Jun-ho.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He then patted the dirt off his pants.With a dead-tired face, he looked around.\u201c\u2026I almost saw my life flash before my eyes.\u201dHe was looking at the remnants of the fierce battle all over the garden when a message rang in his ear.[You have cleared \u27eaLeuf\u2019s Garden\u27eb.]\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dInstead of happiness, Jun-ho\u2019s face was filled with suspicion. The clear condition for this Gate was eliminating all the monsters.Hunting 62 monsters was no easy feat.Unless there are four players.It wasn\u2019t a hard task for each player to defeat 15 Leufs. This put Jun-ho into deep thought.I verified all 186 players that entered this Gate in the last 9 years.A majority of them were novices, but among them was the rising star of India.If the data isn\u2019t wrong, he should have been able to handle even 40 Leufs just by himself.Unless the three that went in with him were some mega trolls, he should have been able to clear it.\u201cSo how did he fail?\u201dThere was something he was missing. As his brows were about to frown:[You have received a\u00a0\u300cBlood Flower\u300d\u00a0as a clear reward.][You have leveled up.][You have leveled up.][All your stats have increased by 2.][You have regained 5 Strength stats.][The Gate will automatically disappear in one hour.]New messages filled up his field of vision, and Jun-ho\u2019s eyes widened.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dHe was honestly not expecting much for the clear reward. He was thinking, \u2018How great of a reward could a low-level Gate give?\u2019 But the reward was a Blood Flower?Jun-ho couldn\u2019t hold back his smile.What amazing luck.Blood Flower seeds had a rare chance of materializing inside a Gate, and it required a ton of human blood for it to bloom into a flower. That\u2019s how it got its name.Jun-ho had also only ever heard of rumors about it. This was the first time he ever obtained one in person.\u201cItem info,\u201d he mumbled while taking out the Blood Flower from his inventory.A holographic window popped up.\u300cBlood Flower\u300dGrade : RareDescription : A strange flower that became a magical plant after consuming human blood. Its effect varies on the number of petals.Effect : Gain +1 Magic stat for each petal you consume.A wide, peaceful smile bloomed on Jun-ho\u2019s face. He radiated the energy of a nice, neighborhood grandma.At this moment, he could even talk to the tabloid reporters outside with a smile.From what I know, Blood Flowers grow only a single petal a year\u2026It\u2019s been 9 years since this Gate formed. Unfortunately, the seed must have sprouted a bit late, because instead of 9 petals, there were only 7 on the flower.\u201cBeggars can\u2019t be choosers. Thank you for the meal.\u201dWithout even an ounce of hesitation, Jun-ho started shoving the petals into his mouth.Munch, munch.The bitter taste of iron filled his mouth.[Your Magic stat has increased by 1.][Your Magic stat has increased by 1.][Your Magic stat\u2026]\u2026After eating all the petals, he licked his lips.\u201c\u2026It tastes absolutely awful, but I wish I had more.\u201dHe had the resolve to eat even worse tasting food for stats.\u201cWait, what are my stats right now\u2026 Status window.\u201d[Seo Jun-ho]Level: 9Title: The One Who Opens SpringStrength: 34\u00a0Stamina: 35Speed: 39\u00a0Magic: 37He slaughtered Leufs all night, and he even cleared the Gate, but he only went up 4 levels. That\u2019s because the higher the level, the more experience it requires.All my stats went up by 4 from leveling up\u2026 and the Blood Flower gave me an additional 7 Magic stat.In just a single night, he managed to increase his Magic by 11.\u201cI won\u2019t have to be worried about my magic for a while.\u201dIt was clear to Jun-ho that he\u2019ll be able to fight better in the next fight.With a grin, Jun-ho turned his head.\u201cNow that the Gate\u2019s been cleared\u2026 time to pick up some nuclei.\u201dDiligently, he pulled the nucleus out of each and every Leuf corpse, storing them in his inventory. But when he finished collecting them, instead of exiting the Gate, he turned his steps towards the maze.Up close, the maze was far taller than he originally thought.It looked 3m tall from over there, but this has gotta be at least 5m tall.The looming height gave some serious psychological pressure. It was this intimidating in the daylight. How awful would it be in the dark, while being chased by Leufs?Jun-ho was glad he hadn\u2019t retreated here last night.K-kk-crack.In order to not get lost in the maze, Jun-ho periodically froze the ground to mark his path.Inside the maze, there were all kinds of weapons and armors littered on the floor. Jun-ho quickly discerned the equipment with his eyes.That one\u2019s worn out. That one\u2019s broken. Wait, what\u2019s that? Is that a flower growing inside that armor?He wasn\u2019t finding any equipment that was up to his standards.\u201cHmm.\u201dAfter arriving at a dead end, Jun-ho made a small spooked noise. He had found a skeleton lying against the wall. And next to it, a notepad and a bow.\u201c\u2026Found it.\u201dHaving found what he was looking for, Jun-ho approached the wall. He carefully picked up the bow. It was covered in dust, but it was a fine, undamaged bow.So this is Tempest.If you shoot an arrow with it, it flies around unpredictably like a butterfly. And the wind caused by the arrow felt like a storm, hence its name*.(TN: The full name for the bow in Korean is \u201cTempest Butterfly\u201d.)\u201cIt\u2019s probably not as great as the \u2018Final Horizon\u2019 that was discovered in the ruins of the 2nd Floor, but\u2026 it\u2019s still a great bow.\u201dFinal Horizon. It was a name given to the bow because it could shoot an arrow to the ends of the horizon. However, he heard it fell into the hands of a fiend, so it was unlikely he would ever come across it.After closely examining the bow, Jun-ho looked over at the skeleton. It was obvious who this fellow was.\u201c\u2026\u2026Tushar Vishi.\u201dThe late up-and-comer from India.Jun-ho paid his respects to him.\u201cThank you.\u201dIf he was bitter in his last moments, he would have put the bow in his inventory before dying. And had he done that, this Rare-grade bow would forever vanish from the world. However, he hadn\u2019t done that.\u201cI\u2019ll probably find the reason in his notepad.\u201dJun-ho carefully flipped through the worn-out notepad. Inside, very neat handwriting filled up the pages.\u201cThis is\u2026 a diary.\u201dThe notepad closely told the tale of Tushar Vishi.Inside of the notepad, the entries were divided by date and time. Since Jun-ho was proficient in English, Japanese, and Hindi, he had no trouble reading the diary.\u2013 2044, April 7th, 12:40PMI got a request from the Korean government to raid Leuf\u2019s Garden. I was promised an unbelievable reward despite only being level 10. My friends and family told me to reconsider, but I can\u2019t give up on this kind of opportunity.\u2013 2044, April 23rd, 4:12PMI\u2019m shaking. Tomorrow\u2019s the day we enter Leuf\u2019s Garden. I did pretty good while shooting some arrows as practice. I have a good feeling about this.\u2013 2044, April 24th, 11:37AMWe finally entered the Gate. With me are my trusted comrades. We\u2019ve been working together since I was level 1. We first scouted our surroundings. It was such a beautiful place, we couldn\u2019t believe that we were inside a Gate.\u2013 2044, April 24th, 8:33PMWhen night fell, Flower Ghosts started crawling out of the ground. The pattern for the Gate was monster waves. Eight Leufs appeared in the first wave. Our group hunted them while laughing at how easy it was. But then 16 appeared in the 2nd wave, and 32 appeared in the 3rd. When 64 Leufs appeared in the 4th wave, we escaped into the maze.There\u2019s no way 128 of them will appear once we finish this wave, right? Dammit. This Gate\u2019s completely crazy.\u2013 2044, April 25th, 5:29AMDawn broke. I managed to scrape by the first day. The Leufs that were chasing us went back into the ground. However, one of our comrades died from blood loss\u2026\u2026 We buried him and made a simple grave for him. The time that I spent inside this Gate felt longer than any other moment of my life.\u2013 2044, April 25th, 7:12PMThe sun\u2019s about to set. I hope that I\u2019ll be able to write in my diary once again. O Shiva, God of Destruction, please grant mercy unto us.\u2013 2044, April 26th, 2:48PMI passed out as soon as the battle was over. My hand feels so weak, I can barely hold the pen. We finished off the rest of the Leufs from the previous night. However, the 5th wave started after that, and a total of 128 Leufs appeared. This is not an exaggeration. There really were 128 of them. After fighting for our lives, there\u2019s about 40 of them left. I\u2019m confident I can take care of that many by myself once the sun goes down. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll be able to leave this cursed Gate\u2026\u2026 Wait. There won\u2019t be a 6th wave, right?\u2013 2044, April 26th, 5:02PMSon of a bitch! Fucking bastard! One of our comrades was a fiend. How could he deceive us like that? He ambushed me from behind. I was able to take care of that dirty, cowardly fiend, but my left hand got torn in battle. I can\u2019t feel my left arm. I can\u2019t wield my bow like this. Having heard the sound of battle, my last comrade\u2019s face turned white. We were the final survivors. I\u2019m worried about tonight.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dReading the diary painted sadness onto Jun-ho\u2019s eyes. The handwriting started getting much more scribbly. The messy letters were screaming his desperation.\u2013 2044, April 26th, 6:58PMI escaped into the maze, running like hell, not even looking back. My final comrade, who continued to fight in my stead, died to a Leuf. Dammit! My tears won\u2019t stop. I\u2019m scared. What am I supposed to do? The terror had taken control of my body. I can\u2019t stop shaking in fear. When I had come to, I had arrived at a dead end. I\u2019m bleeding like crazy from stepping on a trap. I can\u2019t move any longer. This will likely be my grave\u2026\u2026 I can hear the Leufs getting closer. If someone finds this notepad, please tell our families that we\u2019re sorry\u2026\u2026The Leufs must have taken a bit to arrive because the diary had another entry written after a bit of time. Jun-ho deduced the gap in time from the handwriting that had gotten much cruder. It was a handwriting that was filled with grudge and anger. There wasn\u2019t even a date or time preceding this entry.\u2013 If I somehow make it out of here alive, I\u2019m going to annihilate every single one of these fiend bastards. The cancer of society. O Great Shiva, let this Tushar Vishi become one with the eternal soul, and let all those sinners be condemned to hell. Someone, anyone, I beg of you to fulfill the vengeance of this poor warrior.The rest of the notepad was filled with incoherent swearing and resentment. It continued on for many pages. But then, on the last page, the tone shifted radically. It felt like it was written by someone who had a clear mind after having given up on everything. It was written in his normal, neat handwriting that reflected his personality.\u2013 2044, April 27th, 12:01AMI\u2019m still alive. I\u2019ll now put down my pen, and pull the bowstring with my mouth if I have to. O Goddess of War. O God of Archery. Please grant me the miracle of the grand tempest once again.And that was the end of the diary.\u201c\u2026\u2026Alas, there was no miracle.\u201dHad a miracle happened, he wouldn\u2019t have died. And with that, Jun-ho\u2019s suspicions were cleared up.The number of Leufs in this Gate scaled off the number of players.Jun-ho shook from the chills that crept up his spine. What would have happened if he had entered the Gate with 3 noob players? He would have had to face a total of 248 Leufs in the course of 5 waves.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m not sure if even I could have handled that.\u201dIt would have been especially difficult while carrying 3 useless idiots.I can\u2019t believe the most optimal clear method would be to enter alone.In the last 9 years, Jun-ho was the only one to ever enter this Gate alone. After the failures of the first few groups, the latter groups always challenged the Gate with 4 people.Shaking off the sick feeling, Jun-ho got up from the spot.\u201cYosh.\u201dHe rummaged around his inventory. He searched for the thing he always carried around, just in case.\u201cHere it is.\u201dPop! Glug, glug, glug.Jun-ho poured the cheap liquor from his inventory in front of the skeleton.\u201cHinduism believes in Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra*, right? I pray that you\u2019ll reincarnate to a good place.\u201d(TN: Cycle of death and rebirth.)Jun-ho gave a short prayer for Tushar. Only after he was done paying his respects to the dead, he checked the info of the Tempest.\u300cTempest\u300dGrade : Rare250% Piercing strength on attacks.Arrows create a strong gust while flying through the air.Equipment Requirements : Level 10, 45 Strength, 45 SpeedThe world had become like a game, but weapons still didn\u2019t have things like attack damage. At the end of the day, this was a reality where you died if your head got blown off or your heart pierced.\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s amazing.\u201dThe Tempest was a strong weapon, but he wasn\u2019t overjoyed like he normally would be. Because that would have been disrespectful to Tushar Vishi.I don\u2019t have enough Strength or Speed stats. I won\u2019t be able to use it for a while.He could still technically use the bow. However, if you didn\u2019t meet the item\u2019s Equipment Requirements, you couldn\u2019t utilize its bonus effects.Jun-ho said to Tushar\u2019s skull, which was looking up at the sky as if it was contemplating life, \u201cI\u2019ll be borrowing this for a bit. It won\u2019t be enough as payment, but I\u2019ll definitely get your revenge on those damned fiends because I also hate those motherfuckers.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs if it understood Jun-ho\u2019s words, the skeleton rattled and Tushar\u2019s skull shifted, now facing the floor.\u201c\u2026Then, take care, India\u2019s young hero.\u201dWalking away from Tushar, Jun-ho promptly exited the Gate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We didn\u2019t say a thing, but everyone knows that it was you.\u201d\u201cI told you so.\u201dJun-ho was lying across the sofa in the president\u2019s office.\u201cDamn, this sofa\u2019s so comfortable\u2026 Can I eat one of these chocolates?\u201d\u201c\u2026Go for it, why dontcha,\u201d Deok-gu said with a sigh. He continued, \u201cBy the way, you got a thank you message from the Indian Government. Tushar\u2019s family couldn\u2019t stop crying after receiving his diary.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad they at least got a keepsake thanks to you\u2026 though it is a shame.\u201d\u201cWhat is?\u201dDeok-gu shook off the regret from his face before speaking, \u201cNope. If I tell you, you\u2019ll chew me out for being a dirty, greedy bastard.\u201d\u201cPssh.\u00a0I already know you\u2019re a dirty, greedy bastard. Why would I bother chewing you out for that?\u201d\u201c\u2026Geez, thanks.\u201d\u201cSo what do you think is such a shame?\u201dPressured by Jun-ho, Deok-gu eventually spilled the beans.\u201c\u2026\u2026Well, the Tempest. The famous bow used by Tushar Vishi. It\u2019s a shame it couldn\u2019t be recovered.\u201d\u201cOh, that? Right\u2026 I forgot to tell you.\u201dWhile nibbling on some chocolate, Jun-ho pulled out the Tempest from his inventory.\u201cHere.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dAfter looking back and forth between the bow and Jun-ho, Deok-gu exclaimed with a dumb look on his face, \u201cYou! Y-you\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou scared me. You\u2019re going to burst my eardrums.\u201d\u201cYou idiot! Why did you keep this?! How are you going to solve the diplomatic issues when you\u2019re found with this in your possession?\u201dThe Tempest was an item that was discovered inside an Indian Gate. Despite being lent to Tushar Vishi, it was still the property of the Indian Government.Jun-ho smirked while staring at Deok-gu.\u201cI have a friend who specializes in taking care of these problems.\u201d\u201cPlease tell me that friend isn\u2019t me.\u201d\u201cThat friend is also pretty quick at understanding the situation.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sigh. You\u2019re driving me nuts.\u201dDeok-gu flopped down onto the sofa. He looked like he aged a month in just a few seconds. Jun-ho held out the Tempest to his tired friend.\u201cWanna take a look at my bow?\u201d\u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to\u2026\u201dThe Tempest was such an amazing bow, it was classified as a national treasure by the Indian Government. It would be strange if it didn\u2019t pique someone\u2019s curiosity.After scratching his head through his wig, Deok-gu carefully picked up the Tempest. After carefully taking a closer look, he couldn\u2019t hold back his compliments, \u201c\u2026\u2026Damn. It really is something. No wonder it\u2019s an Indian national treasure.\u201d\u201cRight? It\u2019s a shame I won\u2019t be able to openly use it.\u201d\u201cWell, of course. Publicly, it\u2019s been acknowledged as a weapon that dematerialized inside Tushar Vishi\u2019s inventory.\u201d\u201cOh, no. I\u2019m not worried about the Indian Government. It\u2019s the fiends that concern me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Fiends?\u201dDeok-gu wasn\u2019t following Jun-ho, but that was only for a second. After finally understanding the situation, Deok-gu\u2019s face went grim.\u201cYou\u2019re worried about Kal Signer, aren\u2019t you?\u201dJun-ho nodded.Demon Bow, Kal Signer. He was a fiend that collected bows like a maniac.He even publicly announced before that he would steal the Tempest. The fiend that went inside the Gate with Tushar was probably following his orders.That\u2019s why, no matter what, Jun-ho couldn\u2019t risk getting caught having the bow in his possession. The moment he\u2019s caught, Signer\u2019s arrow would point towards him.That guy\u2019s probably seen the articles by now.Jun-ho released an official statement that he wasn\u2019t able to find the Tempest. However, as previously stated, Kal Signer had a maniac-level obsession when it came to bows. There was a chance he didn\u2019t believe the reports.If he suspects me of having the bow\u2026He will surely send in a fiend when Jun-ho attempts to raid the last Uncleared Gate in South Korea, which has a level requirement of 13.Just like what he did to Tushar.Jun-ho gently caressed the Tempest with his hand. If he played his cards right, he\u2019d be able to keep his promise to Tushar sooner than he had hoped.* * *Becoming famous overnight. It was something that most people would never get to experience in their life, and those who do end up with a face of disbelief. However, Jun-ho has already experienced similar events so many times, he wasn\u2019t the least bit surprised. If anything, he was annoyed.\u201c\u2026\u2026The reporters are here?\u201d\u201cYeah! After finally confirming that you were the one that cleared the Uncleared Gate, they gathered like flies to manure.\u201dHaving come to Jun-ho\u2019s room first thing in the morning, Deok-gu already looked flustered.\u201cBy reporters\u2026 do you perhaps mean the tabloid scumbags I met in front of the Gate?\u201d\u201cNo. The major news networks finally got their heavy asses moving.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dAfter hearing that, Jun-ho finally peeked his head out of his thick, blanket burrito.\u201cWhat about the guilds?\u201d\u201cOf course they\u2019re here. They\u2019re not ones to miss out on a juicy meal.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Does that include the Big 6?\u201d\u201cHold your horses. You\u2019re not quite there yet,\u201d Deok-gu shook his head.The Big 6 were the six guilds that possessed the greatest might and achievements in the world. They were famed for only being interested in big fries.\u201cOf course, if you keep raising your name value\u2026 You\u2019ll eventually catch their interest.\u201d\u201cIf I can woo all of the Big 6\u2026\u201d\u201cYour value will shoot through the roof.\u201dJun-ho smirked as he spoke, \u201cWell, well, well. They\u2019re fussing about when I still got a long journey ahead of me.\u201d\u201cI mean, you\u2019ve made quite the impression. You\u2019re the player that cleared not one but two South Korean Uncleared Gates.\u201dGetting up from his seat, Deok-gu continued while fixing his tie, \u201cAnyways, I wanted to let you know ASAP.\u201d\u201c\u2026You should have just texted me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s polite to deliver news like this in person.\u201d\u201cYou know what\u2019s not polite? Waking up someone who was sleeping peacefully\u2026\u201dHe was moaning and groaning but had already gotten 6 hours of sleep. With his fatigue having long been washed away, he slowly crawled out of his blanket burrito.\u201cYawn. I guess I need to do a press conference.\u201d\u201cOkay. When do you wanna do it?\u201d\u201cRight now.\u201d\u201c\u2026Right now, right now?\u201dDeok-gu looked up and down at Jun-ho before asking again, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t need a bit of time to wash up?\u201d\u201cNah. I\u2019ve had enough of pretending to be cool and awesome to the public as \u2018the Specter\u2019.\u201dEven though he didn\u2019t like it, back then, he had to put on an act. It would have been unbefitting of the hero of humanity, the hope of mankind.\u201cI\u2019m Seo Jun-ho now, not Specter.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, if that\u2019s your stance.\u201dDeok-gu promptly nodded.\u201cI keep telling you this, but you\u2019ve earned the right to live however you want.\u201d\u201cAnd what if I cause trouble living like that?\u201d\u201cImmediately fired from the Association.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not fair\u2026\u201dKnowing that Deok-gu was joking, Jun-ho smiled as he got up.\u201cHead on down first. I\u2019ll come after I wash my face.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get everything set up. Be down in 30 minutes.\u201dAfter Deok-gu left the room, Jun-ho went into the bathroom. He looked into the mirror and saw that his hair was messy like a bird\u2019s nest.\u201cMy life, you say\u2026\u201dWhen he was the Specter, he charged forward non-stop. He neither had the time nor reason to look around. The Specter only needed monsters to unleash his anger on. That berserk anger subsided thanks to his comrades.Fast but not rushed. Calm but not slow.After giving himself a reminder, Jun-ho washed his face and straightened out his pajamas.\u201cHey, good-looking.\u201dIn his reflection, he could neither find the charisma nor the impeccable appearance of the Specter.But I don\u2019t really need them, do I?A life of freedom, not caring what anyone thinks. That was the life that Jun-ho desired when he was the Specter.Clamor, clamor.Countless reporters and guild intelligence agents filled the Association\u2019s press hall.\u201cHis first Gate was the Curse of Dawn. Next was Leuf\u2019s Garden\u2026 He seems like the real deal.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll see guys like these every once in a while. They\u2019re wildcards, purposely choosing the road less travelled.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s one of those geniuses, huh?\u201dThe eyes of the crowd were filled with great expectations. Seo Jun-ho was like a gemstone to them.Among the countless gemstones, few shine bright on their own.Korea could have another star player on their hands\u2014just like Kim Woo-joong or Shin Sung-hyun.More than anything, he has a talent for attracting attention.We\u2019ve been short on news about players on the 1st floor\u2026 What a great turn of events.Carrying all their hopes and expectations, Jun-ho appeared after exactly 30 minutes had passed.\u201cHe\u2019s coming!\u201d\u201cTake a picture!\u201dClick, Snap!\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWha\u2014?\u201dThe reporters and intelligence agents paused their flurry of snapshots. Their pause came from Jun-ho\u2019s extremely oddball outfit.What the? How is that public-appropriate clothing?Is that a new trend, perhaps?That guy\u2026 He does know that he\u2019s at a press conference, right?He was the first person ever to appear at a press conference wearing pajamas and slippers. And the disheveled, unkempt hair was the cherry on top. Of course, that wasn\u2019t the only reason for the crowd\u2019s hesitation.\u2026Wait, is he actually a player? He looks even weaker than me.Is that really the player who conquered two Uncleared Gates?This can\u2019t be right. Did he accidentally sleepwalk into the press conference instead of his room\u2026?Setting his outfit aside, Jun-ho\u2019s appearance was far from what they\u2019ve been expecting. They were all dumbfounded. Their expectations of a strong, muscular man or even a cold-faced killer shattered to pieces.While everyone was unable to hold back their shock, Jun-ho got on his seat and spoke while yelling out a huge yawn, \u201cHuaaaam. I am Seo Jun-ho. I\u2019ll be holding a press conference for 30 minutes starting now. Anyone wanna ask the first question?\u201dSnapping out of their shock, all of the reporters raised their hands.\u201cPlease tell us in detail about your experiences in the Gate!\u201d\u201cWhat was your resolve when you challenged these Gates?\u201d\u201cIs there any particular reason why you debuted with the Uncleared Gates?\u201dTo the crowd that squawked like a nest of birds asking for food from their mother, Jun-ho answered their questions one by one.\u201cLet\u2019s start with the Curse of Dawn. The inside of the Gate was a graveyard. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware, the Clear Condition was to survive till sunrise\u2026\u201dThey wrote their article in real-time, writing down everything he said. Though none of them dared to say it, they all had the same thought.He\u2019s definitely exaggerating, saying he defeated 50 zombies by himself inside an Uncleared Gate\u2026A level 1 novice took down all those zombies and a Tricker? Who\u2019ll believe this crap?Shim Deok-gu is definitely behind this. He probably came up with this story for the masses and made him memorize it.I guess it doesn\u2019t matter since the public is going to eat this up.The barrage of questions and answers flowed smoothly like water. Jun-ho\u2019s veteran-level control over the press conference surprised the reporters.Is this actually his first-ever press conference? This doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s his first-ever rodeo.Most players end up stuttering from how nervous they are during their first press conference\u2026 He\u2019s slier than he lets on.He\u2019s a natural. There\u2019s no other way to explain this.They were fully mistaken. Jun-ho had been in this exact situation more times than he could count. However, their misunderstanding only benefited Jun-ho.A player that looks weak at first sight accomplished something incredibly remarkable\u2026With a loose-screw personality, coming to a press conference in pajamas.I kind of dig it.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe\u2019ll be a great subject for stories for now.For reporters that were desperate for news, Jun-ho became the sweet rain in the midst of a drought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The promised 30 minutes had passed, and the room couldn\u2019t get any more heated.Nice. Tomorrow\u2019s newspapers will be interesting.Seeing the reporters\u2019 eyes sparkle, Seo Jun-ho thought that it was about time to wrap things up.\u201cI\u2019ll take one last question.\u201d At that moment, a reporter raised their hand as if they\u2019d been waiting.\u201cHave you decided on which Gate you\u2019ll be going to next?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d The response cut like a knife, as if he\u2019d been expecting it.\u201cThere\u2019s one Gate that I really want to go to, but my level isn\u2019t high enough yet.\u201d\u201cYour level is too low\u2026 Which one are you talking about?\u201dAs the reporter pushed up their glasses, a faint smile spread across Seo Jun-ho\u2019s lips.\u201cThe Eastern Sea Gate.\u201d\u201cI see. So it\u2019s the Eastern Sea G\u2014Excuse me?!\u201dThe reporter let out a piercing scream, but no one could blame him. Everyone\u2019s eyes were wide as they stared at Seo Jun-ho for an answer. Some of them turned to each other to double-check if they\u2019d heard wrong.Their reaction was natural. The Eastern Sea Gate was the last Uncleared Gate in Korea.\u201c\u2026\u2026Well, if you look at Seo Jun-ho\u2019s other achievements, it\u2019s not so strange.\u201d\u201cYes, definitely. He\u2019s already cleared two Uncleared Gates.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of that earlier?\u201d\u201cBut of course\u2026\u2026\u201dNaturally, their gazes turned to Seo Jun-ho himself. He looked a little bigger, but he was still as scrawny as always. It didn\u2019t help that he was wearing pajamas and three-striped slippers instead of some shiny armor. No one would ever think that he\u2019d be an amazing player that could enter the Eastern Sea Gate.\u201cSo\u2026 Are you saying that you plan to go to other Uncleared Gates once your level is high enough?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s surprising. If you clear the Eastern Sea Gate, you\u2019ll have cleared three Uncleared Gates. That\u2019s unheard of.\u201d The silent reporter slowly started speaking again.\u201cThe Eastern Sea Gate requires a minimum level of 13. It\u2019s one of the Gates with the highest difficulty level on the 1st floor.\u201d\u201c8,715 players have already failed to clear it. There\u2019s even rumors that it\u2019ll be declared a 1-star Gate.\u201d\u201cAccording to the information from the guilds, it\u2019s also likely that there will be a Boss Monster inside.\u201d\u201cDo you think that you can defeat the Boss Monster?\u201d\u201cI was wondering if you were ignoring the fact that\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was only natural that the reporters would react so negatively.Of course, since a Boss Monster is a big deal.They were on a different level from normal monsters. They had overwhelming strength and ruled over other monsters as kings.That was a Boss Monster.Looking at the eager reporters, Seo Jun-ho laughed.\u201cIf I fight a Boss Monster, I\u2019ll win.\u201dIt was a fitting remark for the title of the \u2018Indifferent King\u2019 from 25 years ago.* * *[\u201cBoss Monster? I\u2019ll defeat them all.\u201d Player Seo Jun-ho\u2019s strange comment.][No one has ever said anything like this before. Is it arrogance or confidence? Hot topic Seo Jun-ho.][Seo Jun-ho confirms again: \u201cI couldn\u2019t find the Tempest after I cleared the Gate.\u201d][Seo Jun-ho\u2019s next conquest will be carefully selected from a flood of commission requests.][When asked who he admires most, Seo Jun-ho replied with \u201cthe Specter\u201d.]A man sat in the Guildmaster\u2019s office as he flipped through the newspapers. He was looking at a photo of a pajama-clad Seo Jun-ho on the fourth page.\u201c\u2026And a picture on the 4th page? That\u2019s amazing for a rookie.\u201dThe man sitting on the sofa opposite from him looked up.\u201cI think it\u2019s clear just how significant the Uncleared Gates are.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve heard something interesting from the 1st floor.\u201dTwo of the so-called Big 6 guilds were from Korea. One was the Silent Moon led by Son Chae-won, and the other was Dokkaebi led by Shin Sung-hyun.\u201cIf you\u2019re interested, would you like me to contact him?\u201d\u201cHm? No, not yet. He\u2019s still far off from that.\u201d With a resolute look, Shin Sung-hyun continued. \u201cIf something extraordinary happens, people call it chance or fate. But do you know what they call it when it happens twice?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t that be skill?\u201d\u201cPrecisely. But I disagree with that notion.\u201d He held up three fingers, \u201cThree times. I think it has to happen at least three times before you can call it skill.\u201d\u201cThree times\u2026 I understand.\u201d The Vice-Guildmaster bowed his head. He realized what his boss wanted.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho has one more left.If he performed another miracle, he would receive an invitation from the Dokkaebi Guild.\u201cPass. This one too.\u201d\u201cThen how about this one?\u201d\u201cHm, not bad but not that good either. Pass.\u201dSeo Jun-ho and Shim Deok-gu were in the process of going through a mountain of documents. They were all commissions labeled \u2018personal request\u2019.\u201cI didn\u2019t know the press conference would have this big of an effect. You\u2019re totally hot right now.\u201d\u201cDeok-gu, this is just another day for me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Cheeky bastard.\u201d Shim Deok-gu just gave Seo Jun-ho a look and shook his head.They were looking for a request that fulfilled 3 conditions:A Gate with good EXP drops.A Gate with an appropriate difficulty.A good reward.Shim Deok-gu scratched his head through his wig, \u201cHm. It\u2019s hard to find a commission that fulfills all three of them.\u201d\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m fine with giving up on the third one.\u201d\u201cNope. This is your first personal commission. It\u2019ll set a precedent for your prices.\u201d\u201cBut image is important too. The gap between a player who gets 100 million won commissions and another who gets 1 billion won commissions is bigger than you think.\u201d(TN: $0.89 = 1000 won)Right now, Seo Jun-ho was level 9. He needed to level up four more times before he could enter the Eastern Sea Gate.\u201cHuh?\u201d Shim Deok-gu\u2019s eyes widened as he read over a commission. With an earnest gaze, he handed the paper over to Seo Jun-ho.\u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cLet me see.\u201dStrangely, the form was filled out by hand. Looking at the neat writing was refreshing to his eyes.But the description wasn\u2019t.\u201cHuh. So it\u2019s a request from a father whose daughter is terminally ill.\u201d\u201cThe only thing that can cure it is the Cinder Fox\u2019s core.\u201dThe Cinder Fox. Seo Jun-ho\u2019s brows furrowed at the name.\u201cThat\u2019s a name I haven\u2019t heard in a while.\u201d\u201cYou killed one before, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah. I almost died.\u201dAt that time, it hadn\u2019t even been half a year since he became a player. Looking back on it, everything had been fun and games.\u201cAre there still Gates with Cinder Foxes? I only ever encountered one in my entire career as a player.\u201d\u201cYup. In Korea, no less.\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked surprised as he heard that.\u201cReally? Why did I not know this until now?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you were so focused on the Uncleared Gates.\u201d\u201cIt has a Cinder Fox but it\u2019s not Uncleared?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t quite meet the requirements. It only appeared 3 months ago.\u201dUncleared Gates had to meet two conditions. One, it had to be at least 6 months old. And two, it had to have at least 5 failed attempts.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to just show you.\u201d Deok-gu tapped twice on his Vita and a display appeared.\u27eaBurning Dunes\u27ebRequired Level : 5 \u2013 15Party Cap : 30 peopleClear Condition : Defeat the Cinder FoxDifficulty : HardSeo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes sparkled as he read over the description.\u201cThis is gonna be harder than the one I caught before.\u201d There was a reason he thought that. \u201cThe Cinder Fox from before required levels 10 through 20 and had a Party Cap of 50.\u201d But this time the requirements were stricter.Shim Deok-gu shook his head.\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why not?\u201d\u201cThe standards for players have gone up. So have item specs.\u201d\u201cTheir skills have been getting better?\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded slowly, \u201cWell, that\u2019s probably true. I haven\u2019t seen any players in action since I\u2019ve come back.\u201d All he\u2019d seen were the players from the licensing test.I wonder how strong they are these days.\u00a0Were they as strong as Shim Deok-gu suggested? How much stronger have they gotten?\u201c\u2026I\u2019m curious now.\u201d He was a first-generation player. Didn\u2019t that mean he was everyone\u2019s sunbae?\u00a0I\u2019m curious to see how my hubaes are doing.Seo Jun-ho waved the commission form in his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll do this one. I want to see my hubaes.\u201d Shim Deok-gu\u2019s face brightened.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYup. Why do you look so happy about it?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what Shim Deok-gu was like around others, but his inner feelings were always clear to Seo Jun-ho. He gave up on making excuses and answered.\u201cI actually know the person who sent the commission.\u201d\u201cReally? Are you two close?\u201d\u201cNot really. I didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d sent it in.\u201d That made sense. Deok-gu looked shocked when he first saw it. \u201cYou know the Myungho Group? He\u2019s the CEO.\u201d\u201cOh? So he\u2019s old man Choi Man-hyuk\u2019s son?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the second son. Choi Pil-ho. You probably haven\u2019t met him, but you\u2019ve heard of the name, right?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I suppose, when Choi Man-hyuk was bragging about his sons.\u201d Seo Jun-ho stared at the form with a new look in his eyes and nodded, \u201cSounds interesting. Schedule a meeting for me.\u201d* * *The next day, Seo Jun-ho made his way to the Association President\u2019s office as Deok-gu had ordered.\u00a0Huh?He paused as he opened the door. There was another person in the office aside from Deok-gu. It was a beautiful woman with shoulder-length black hair.\u201cAh, you\u2019re here.\u201dSeo Jun-ho glanced at Shim Deok-gu and nodded.\u201cI\u2019ll introduce you. This is Cha Si-eun. She will be your manager and secretary starting today.\u201d\u201cMy name is Cha Si-eun! Please take care of me!\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, likewise.\u201d As he took in her cheerful greeting, Seo Jun-ho realized what was going on.\u00a0I see. She\u2019ll be in charge of my international work.No matter how close he and Deok-gu were, that was a personal relationship. If the Association President personally assisted a player, it would clearly be suspicious.\u00a0It\u2019s a good thing that he\u2019s separating his public and private lives.Rather than annoyed or sad, Seo Jun-ho only felt more confident in Deok-gu.\u201cYou have a meeting with the Myungho Group CEO, correct?\u201d\u201cYes, President.\u201d The corners of Shim Deok-gu\u2019s mouth twitched as Seo Jun-ho switched over to a formal tone.\u201cMs. Cha Si-eun over here will escort you. She\u2019s very capable, so you\u2019ll find yourself relying on her in the future.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m not that\u2026 Thank you for your kind words.\u201d Cha Si-eun looked at Seo Jun-ho as she responded with a timid voice. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 There\u2019s 32 minutes until the scheduled meeting time, so we should leave within 6 minutes to make it on time.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThen let\u2019s go right now.\u201d\u201cAh, alright!\u201d Cha Si-eun\u2019s heels clicked as she escorted him.\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting here, expecting good results.\u201d Shim Deok-gu laughed as he waved from his seat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The family that owned the ever-expanding Myungho Group had clean tax records and led lives that garnered both respect and envy.\u201cIt seemed that they would be that way forever. Until misfortune struck.\u201dSeo Jun-ho looked up from the back seat. Sitting in front of him, Cha Si-eun briefed him with a quiet voice, as if she were reciting a story.\u201cMisfortune\u2026 You mean the daughter?\u201d\u201cYes. Choi Pil-ho\u2019s eldest daughter was struck with a terminal illness: \u2018Nine Yin Severance Syndrome\u2019.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s a hard one to fix\u2026\u201dThose who have Nine Yin Severance Syndrome were born with high Yin energy and most of them died young. The only way to treat it was to counteract it by infusing the victim with the opposite Yang energy. The problem was, it was hard to find anything these days with the appropriate amount of Yang energy.\u201cOne of the only items that can treat Nine Yin Severance Syndrome is the Cinder Fox\u2019s core. The world-famous player Specter-nim hunted the Cinder Fox and proved it 29 years ago.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yeah, well. It\u2019s not that amazing.\u201d Seo Jun-ho scratched his cheek, embarrassed. Cha Si-eun glanced back at him.\u201cExcuse me, why is Jun-ho-nim embarrassed?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve admired Specter-nim all my life. I\u2019m just nervous about the fact that I\u2019ll be hunting the same monster as him.\u201d He came up with the excuse on the spot. It wasn\u2019t too convincing, but she glossed right over it.\u201cThe core that Specter-nim recovered was sold to a rich Frenchman, and he successfully treated his wife with it.\u201d\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded slowly. He remembered selling the Cinder Fox\u2019s core for a high price.\u201cIn conclusion, that is the background pertaining to President Choi Pil-ho\u2019s commission.\u201d\u201cIt was a nice story. I understand now.\u201d\u201cThank you. I\u2019ve also heard that you\u2019re not the first one that Choi Pil-ho has commissioned.\u201d\u201cBut of course. His daughter\u2019s life is on the line. How many were there before me?\u201d\u201cSeven teams have accepted the commission and failed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a lot. Am I the only one going this time?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find out once we talk with him.\u201d As if on cue, the car stopped. Seo Jun-ho got off and looked up at the Myungho Group\u2019s company building.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed a bit\u2026\u201d\u201cHave you been here before?\u201d\u201cYeah. A long time ago.\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked at Cha Si-eun with a faint smile.\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAs they approached the 1st floor reception desk, the receptionist smiled.\u201cHow can I help you?\u201dCha Si-eun reached into her pocket and showed her Player Association identification card.\u201cWe\u2019re from the Player Association. We have a meeting scheduled with President Choi Pil-ho regarding a personal commission.\u201d\u201cOh, player Seo Jun-ho-nim, correct? The elevator is right over the\u2026?\u201d The receptionist trailed off as a flustered look filled her face. At the same time, the chattering behind her got louder.What is it?As he turned, he saw a middle-aged man flanked by bodyguards approaching them. The man held out his hand as his clear eyes sparkled.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019ve been waiting. I am Choi Pil-ho.\u201d Seo Jun-ho and Cha Si-eun were both shocked. Neither of them had expected the President to come all the way down to the 1st floor.As Seo Jun-ho took his hand, he felt something in his chest. Perhaps he was sensing the sincere love of a father.\u201cI\u2019m Seo Jun-ho. It\u2019s an honor to meet you in person.\u201d\u201cHaha. You\u2019re a hero who\u2019s saved countless citizens by clearing the Uncleared Gates. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s honored.\u201d He laughed as he said this, but Seo Jun-ho could feel his eagerness in the way he gripped his hand.\u201cLet\u2019s talk upstairs.\u201dThey followed him to his office on the top floor and were greeted by the scent of good coffee. Choi Pil-ho waited for Seo Jun-ho to take a sip before he slowly opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2019d imagine that you already heard everything, considering the Association\u2019s ability to gather information.\u201d Seo Jun-ho did not contradict him.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my only wish. My daughter\u2026 Please help my Sun-hee.\u201dWith tears forming at the edge of his eyes, Choi Pil-ho no longer resembled the nationally-renowned businessman that he was. It was the face of a worried father who could no longer hide his sadness.\u201cI need the core of the Cinder Fox.\u201d Seo Jun-ho finished his coffee with one gulp.\u201cYes. It\u2019s the only method that\u2019s been successful in treating my daughter\u2019s disease.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Since you already seem to know everything, let\u2019s move on to the payment.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re straightforward. I like it. I was thinking\u2026 150 billion won.\u201d150 billion won.(TN: ~$13m)Cha Si-eun\u2019s eyes widened. It was much more than she\u2019d expected. She looked at Seo Jun-ho expectantly, as if to say, \u201cHurry up and accept it!\u201d.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut after considering it for a second, Seo Jun-ho shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dChoi Pil-ho let out a low breath and immediately raised the price. \u201c200 billion.\u201d\u201cPresident.\u201d\u201cIs that still not enough? Then 250\u2026 No, I\u2019ll give you 300 billion. Do you need more?\u201dChoi Pil-ho stared at Seo Jun-ho, biting his bottom lip hard. Seo Jun-ho slowly opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m not telling you to raise the price. 100 billion. I\u2019ll take 100 billion won.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d Both Choi Pil-ho and Cha Si-eun\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.\u201cReally?\u201d He felt that Seo Jun-ho\u2019s price wasn\u2019t high enough. Specter had sold the core to the Frenchman for exactly 100 billion.But things were different now. Inflation was one thing, but the Frenchman had bought the core without knowing if it would work or not. Choi Pil-ho was buying it with a guarantee. The price of an item went up depending on how badly one wanted it. Actually, the most he\u2019d paid a team for this commission was 240 billion won.\u201cYes. 100 billion is more than enough.\u201d\u201cCan I ask why?\u201d Seo Jun-ho grinned.\u201cThe Frenchman actually offered 500 billion won for the core. He was willing to sell everything if it meant he could save his wife.\u201d\u201c\u2026This is the first time I\u2019m hearing this.\u201d\u201cOh, I heard this from President Shim Deok-gu.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be strange for Shim Deok-gu to know the truth of such a story because he had been Specter\u2019s close friend.\u201cBut the Specter refused the offer and sold it for lower. Do you know why?\u201d After a moment, Choi Pil-ho shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d\u201c\u2018You shouldn\u2019t play around with the feelings of someone who\u2019s trying to save their family\u2026\u2019 is what he said.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI agree with Specter-nim. If I took advantage of such a situation to fill my own belly\u2026 It wouldn\u2019t feel right.\u201dAfter listening to his explanation, both Choi Pil-ho and Cha Si-eun looked deep in thought. After a moment, Choi Pil-ho opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026Phew, I think I should apologize first.\u201d He bowed his head and started to explain as Seo Jun-ho looked on with a curious gaze.\u201cAll the others who have accepted my commission were only after the money. I had to set a price for Sun-hee\u2019s life and only looked for expensive hirees.\u201d\u201cIt must have been hard on you emotionally.\u201d\u201cThank you for understanding. You\u2019re the only one who understands the pain that my family has been going through. I apologize once again for thinking that you were like the others.\u201d Choi Pil-ho had been extremely touched by Seo Jun-ho\u2019s words. That was because no other player had been this concerned or considerate of him.\u201cAnyway, I think player Seo Jun-ho alone will be enough this time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m surprised. Are you that confident that I\u2019ll bring back the core?\u201d Choi Pil-ho laughed at the question.\u201cAs I get older, the only things that increase are my wrinkles and my eye for people.\u201d\u201cThank you for your praise.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost lunchtime. Shall we dine together?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have to make preparations if I want to defeat the Cinder Fox.\u201dEven though he\u2019d swiftly rejected the offer, Choi Pil-ho didn\u2019t seem offended.\u201cAh, I apologize. Your life is at stake. You should prepare as thoroughly as possible.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no problem. We can dine together next time. When I return with the core, I mean.\u201d\u201cI feel better just hearing that. I\u2019ll prepare the best chefs.\u201dWith a kind smile, Choi Pil-ho escorted them out.\u201cI\u2019ll be counting on you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Because you chose the best person for the job.Seo Jun-ho swallowed those words and got in the car.\u201cIs that story about Specter-nim true?\u201d Cha Si-eun broke the silence, eyes sparkling.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, isn\u2019t it? He had an image for being cold and mechanical\u2026\u201dCha Si-eun shook her head.\u201cNope. Actually, it makes sense that someone as kind as Specter-nim would do that.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is he kind? The Specter?\u201d\u201cI think so. And after what you said, I\u2019m more sure now.\u201d Cha Si-eun closed her eyes as if remembering someone and gently placed her hands on her lap. \u201cSpecter-nim probably refused the initial offer because he was thinking of his own family.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSpecter-nim watched his parents die right in front of his eyes. It\u2019s probably his biggest regret. So when he saw someone faced with the same situation, he probably didn\u2019t want them to experience the same pain\u2026 Don\u2019t you think so?\u201dSeo Jun-ho quietly watched the Han river pass by before he closed his eyes and muttered a reply.\u201c\u2026Perhaps.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWell, no one knows but Specter-nim himself.\u201dThey rode the rest of the way to the Association in silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Isn\u2019t she great?\u201d\u201cWe only spent two hours together. How should I know?\u201d After a pause, Seo Jun-ho continued. \u201c\u2026Well, she\u2019s good at giving briefings.\u201d\u201cYou have no idea. She could work at a conglomerate company or a famous guild with her credentials.\u201d\u201cThen why is she working at a place like this?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you notice? She really admires Specter. She said she wanted to work here simply because Specter was here for a while.\u201d\u201cWhat a strange girl.\u201d As Seo Jun-ho muttered to himself, Shim Deok-gu stood up.\u201cAnyways, she\u2019s good at her job, so make good use of her. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cGo where?\u201d\u201cIf you want to defeat the Cinder Fox, you\u2019ll need good equipment.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going shopping?\u201d\u201cNo. We\u2019re going to the Association\u2019s weapons warehouse.\u201d\u201c\u2026You cheap bastard.\u201d\u201cHey, they make good stuff. Take a look before you judge.\u201d Shim Deok-gu led his grumpy friend and started toward the warehouse.\u201cI\u2019ve gone there before. There isn\u2019t much.\u201d\u201cYou only went to zone 1 last time.\u201dThe back door of zone 1 opened as Shim Deok-gu\u2019s iris was scanned.\u201cDon\u2019t you think you at least need gear from zone 2 if you\u2019re gonna fight the Cinder Fox?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hoo.\u201d Now interested, Seo Jun-ho slowly looked around zone 2. The quality of the equipment was much better than in zone 1. \u201cCan I take anything I want?\u201d\u201cYeah. I can explain them to you if you\u2019d like.\u201d\u201cPlease. There\u2019s a lot of unfamiliar stuff here since it\u2019s been a long time.\u201d Shim Deok-gu laughed and grabbed the sword in front of Seo Jun-ho.\u201cDo you remember the game we\u2019d play in PC bangs* after school?\u201d(PR: \u201cPC room\u201d, basically internet/gaming caf\u00e9s.)\u201cYeah. League of Gods, was it?\u201d\u201cYeah. Whenever they had big patches, they released new builds and items.\u201d\u201cRight. When it came out, we\u2019d come up with strategies and plans.\u201d They laughed as they reminisced.\u201cIt\u2019s the same with gears. They\u2019ve been developing for the past 25 years.\u201d Shim Deok-gu held out the sword to Seo Jun-ho.\u201cTake it.\u201d He did. It was of high quality, but other than that, it just seemed like a normal sword. However, it felt much lighter.\u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed. It\u2019s nice\u2026 but it\u2019s pretty normal.\u201d\u201cInfuse it with magic.\u201d As soon as he did, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.\u201c\u2026What is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a sword with the highest rate of magic transference. Your old sword couldn\u2019t do this, could it?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThese weapons are the same.\u201d Shim Deok-gu excitedly introduced Seo Jun-ho to the other equipment.\u201cThis one releases electricity. You can stun monsters with it.\u201d\u201cIf you infuse this armor with magic, it creates an energy shield to block the enemy\u2019s attacks.\u201d\u201cOh, have I explained this one? It\u2019s called a magic bomb. It\u2019s super powerful.\u201d Shim Deok-gu paused and glanced toward Seo Jun-ho. \u201c\u2026Hey, what\u2019s with that face? I thought you\u2019d be more excited.\u201d After all, Seo Jun-ho was greedy when it came to items.\u201cI mean, it\u00a0is\u00a0impressive\u2026 but you said most players use these sort of things nowadays?\u201d\u201cOf course. They\u2019re a lot more efficient than the normal weapons we used back then.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho furrowed his eyebrows and turned back to him. \u201cThen when do they train with them?\u201d\u201cHuh? That\u2019s\u2026\u201d Shim Deok-gu shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not a player, so I\u2019m not too sure, but do they really need to train with them? All the newest equipment is at this level.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho shook his head. \u201cDeok-gu, the\u2026 rankers. Do they use these things too?\u201d\u201cWell, rankers usually get custom-made gear, so I\u2019m not too sure.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPursing his lips, Seo Jun-ho thought for a second.\u00a0He said that the standards for players have gone up\u2026 I can see that.In the past, players would die miserable deaths because they couldn\u2019t pierce the orcs\u2019 hides. But with these new weapons, an orc\u2019s hide could easily be stabbed through.\u00a0But these are mere toys that can only kill normal monsters at best.These weapons couldn\u2019t be used to hunt the strongest ones\u2014predators that made even Seo Jun-ho nervous.These toys wouldn\u2019t even put a scratch on them. He was sure of it.\u00a0A player\u2019s magic will short-circuit in front of such destructive power.And what about these fake artifacts that weren\u2019t even worthy of a grade rating? They\u2019d simply break and fall apart.\u201cNot only that, the Cinder Fox\u2026\u201d It was the strongest of its kind, a \u2018Boss Monster\u2019.Getting a little annoyed at Seo Jun-ho\u2019s long silence, Shim Deok-gu finally spoke up.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying anything? Is there a problem?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only one type of monster these toys can defeat.\u201d Seo Jun-ho placed the sword back to its place and shook his head. \u201cDeok-gu, do you know why a player only encounters weak monsters when their level is low?\u201d\u201c\u2026Because they\u2019ll die if they encounter a strong one?\u201d\u201cExactly. This shitty system is really fair about things like that.\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201dSeo Jun-ho closed his eyes and recalled the training he and his four comrades went through.\u201c\u2026A player grows by fighting monsters. That way, they can use the experience and skills they\u2019ve accumulated to face more powerful monsters.\u201d\u201cSo you think these high-tech weapons won\u2019t work on strong monsters.\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s why I asked if rankers use these too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shim Deok-gu paused to consider this.\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026 players who use these weapons don\u2019t exactly achieve much. But they\u2019re great for Gates and low-leveled monsters.\u201dChuckling, Seo Jun-ho looked around. Something caught his eye, and he walked toward a corner. A longsword was propped up against the wall.Shing.The sound rang across the room as he pulled the sword out of its sheath.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s also made with new materials. But it doesn\u2019t have any particular features, so I just put it away in the corner.\u201d\u201c\u2026The world has become very interesting. Personal growth has been hindered by mere toys.\u201d That was probably because the world was so peaceful. \u201cI\u2019ll take this. I don\u2019t need anything else. Oh!\u201d Seo Jun-ho grabbed a few of the magic bombs. \u201cAnd these look pretty fun, so I\u2019ll take some.\u201d\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Shim Deok-gu\u2019s shoulders sagged as he muttered to himself.There was a crowd of people gathered in front of the Burning Dunes Gate. They were mostly players and their families, but there were also reporters waiting for Seo Jun-ho.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of people.\u201d Cha Si-eun shuffled in her seat as Seo Jun-ho looked outside. She opened her thermos and offered it to him.\u201cIt\u2019s lavender tea. It\u2019s good for concentration as well as easing the body and mind.\u201d\u201c\u2026You really came prepared.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a secretary. I heard that players get quite nervous and anxious before entering a Gate\u2026\u201d She tilted her head as she studied him. \u201cBut it\u2019s strange. You don\u2019t seem nervous at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026I am, on the inside.\u201d Seo Jun-ho blew on the tea before taking a sip and looked back outside. \u201cIt\u2019s good. But I didn\u2019t expect there to be this many players.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going in alone. They all want the Cinder Fox\u2019s core.\u201d\u201cI heard that there are guild members here too. How many players are there?\u201d\u201cCounting Jun-ho-nim, there are a total of 27 players who will go inside the Gate.\u201d And they didn\u2019t know how many would return. Seo Jun-ho shook his head and got out of the car. As soon as he did, he was showered with camera flashes and mics shoved in his face.\u201cHow do you feel about going inside a Gate with other players for the first time?\u201d\u201cThe Cinder Fox is known to be a fickle Boss Monster. How confident are you?\u201d\u201cIs it true that you received a commission from the Myungho Group\u2019s President, Choi Pil-ho?\u201d The other players snickered as the reporters crowded him.\u201cWow, you\u2019d think he\u2019s a ranker or something.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been blowing up even though he\u2019s a rookie. The newspapers are all over him.\u201d\u201cThat scrawny guy cleared two Uncleared Gates? Were the reports mistaken?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it either. His equipment looks shabby too.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 he probably has stuff in his inventory. Do you think he\u2019d clear the Gate with just that?\u201dThere was a simple reason for their contempt. There were almost no novices who received as much attention as Seo Jun-ho did. Most players who weren\u2019t part of famous guilds couldn\u2019t even land interviews.Seo Jun-ho knew this too.There are this many reporters already\u2026 It\u2019s more than in the past.It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that the reporters were a representation of his hold on the media. Feeling good about himself, he curled his lips.\u201cNervous? I feel like I\u2019m out for a walk.\u201d\u201cCinder Fox? I\u2019ll defeat it easily.\u201d As soon as he ended the short interviews, Cha Si-eun stepped up.\u201cFor the sake of player Seo Jun-ho\u2019s mental state, we will end the interviews here.\u201d The reporters looked disappointed, but it would be rude to pester someone who was about to enter a Gate. As they started to disperse, Cha Si-eun let out a sigh.\u201cPhew, I didn\u2019t know that there would be this many reporters.\u201d\u201cIt just shows how interested they are in me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCha Si-eun scanned the other players. There was no one else who looked as calm as Seo Jun-ho.\u00a0And he\u2019s only been to two Gates before\u2026\u00a0Was he trying to act cool because he was in front of a girl?Cha Si-eun glanced at Seo Jun-ho before nodding at him.\u201cPlease return safely.\u201d\u201cYes. And please make me lavender tea again. It was good.\u201d As he started to walk toward the other players, he said something else. \u201cOh, and you should get up earlier tomorrow.\u201d\u201cExcuse me? Get up early\u2026?\u201d Cha Si-eun blinked as Seo Jun-ho turned back to face her.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAfter today, we\u2019re gonna get a whole lot of personal commission requests, so prepare yourself.\u201d11:28 AM.27 players entered the Gate, leaving their family\u2019s cheers and the media\u2019s attention behind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)The inside of the Burning Dunes Gate was a desolate desert. The only sights were the color of the sky and the sand. The players who didn\u2019t expect a desert environment erupted in complaints.\u201cDammit, I wore metal armor, and it\u2019s a desert?\u201d\u201cOh no\u2026 I didn\u2019t bring a lot of drinking water.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with this sand? My feet keep sinking. And we\u2019re supposed to fight here\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s crazy hot.\u201dThere weren\u2019t many people who\u2019d been to a desert before. On top of that, they had to fight on the sand.Some of the players started to panic at the realization and began cursing loudly.\u201cPlease lend me your ears!\u201d All the players turned toward the voice.\u201cFor now, please gather here.\u201d\u201cWho is that bastard?\u201d\u201cI dunno. Oh, is he a player from a guild?\u201d\u201cHuh, a guild?\u201dWith uncertain looks on their faces, they gathered around the man who\u2019d called out to them. Three of his teammates were behind him.\u201cLet me introduce myself. I am Cha Min-woo, a member of Korea\u2019s rank 13 guild, Cheong-hae.\u201d\u201cCh-Cheong-hae?\u201d\u201cWhat the heck. Cheong-hae was participating?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re really good.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the guild that only takes elites?\u201d In an instant, their wary attitudes changed. Cheong-hae wasn\u2019t good enough to be part of the Big 6, but it was still a famous, prestigious guild.\u201cAs you all know, there\u2019s not much an individual player can do in such a big Gate.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 That\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cBecause these Gates aren\u2019t meant to be conquered alone.\u201d The players nodded in agreement. \u201cSo, I would like to make a proposal.\u201d\u201cA proposal?\u201d\u201c10 million won. We will give 10 million won to every player that follows our orders. Of course, we will also guarantee your safety.\u201d(TN: ~$89,000 ; for comparison, the core is $10m+)\u201cGeez\u2026 10 million won, that\u2019s worse than I thought.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s a small sum compared to the price of the core\u2026\u201d The players glanced around at each other. They\u2019d all entered the Gate with the hopes of making it big with the Cinder Fox\u2019s core. And among them were those who hadn\u2019t even mastered the fundamentals\u2014those who couldn\u2019t even be called players. Usually, those types of people were met with shock when they first entered a Gate.Good move.\u00a0The Cheong-hae Guild really was elite. They\u2019d already made a proposal before the players did anything.If we succeed, they\u2019ll either refuse the offer or ask for more than 10 million won.That said, he understood players well. In such a dangerous and desolate place, the guarantee of safety made it a tempting offer.Seo Jun-ho slowly raised his hand.\u201cThen how will we divide the reward? The Cinder Fox\u2019s core, I mean.\u201d\u201c\u2026Of course our guild will take it.\u201d Everybody stopped. They were so confident even though they\u2019d never faced the Cinder Fox before.Cha Min-woo took advantage of the silence and drove the nail in.\u201cAhem, alright. Those who join us right now will receive 20 million won, but those that join us later will only receive 5 million.\u201dIt was time to choose.Follow the guild players and receive 20 million won with guaranteed safety, or go down the dangerous route and attempt to hunt the Cinder Fox on your own\u2014with a reward that\u2019s worth billions.The practical people raised their hands first.\u201cI accept.\u201d\u201cSo will I. It\u2019ll be hard to fight alone in this heavy armor\u2026\u201d\u201cWill you give us drinking water too? If so, I\u2019ll join.\u201dAs well as the people who were unprepared.Soon, the others started to complain.\u201cWait, so you guys will take the core all for yourselves?\u201d\u201cNah, even if you give 10 million to every person, it won\u2019t cost 300 million to pay everyone off.\u201dCha Min-woo raised an eyebrow as they started to complain. \u201cSo you think that you can defeat the Cinder Fox alone, without our help?\u201dAs the rest of the players joined up, the ones left over had no other choice but to follow.\u201cWhat, they\u2019re all going over?\u201d\u201cTsk.\u00a0I wanted to make it big this time, but there\u2019s nothing we can do compared to such a big group.\u201d\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to settle for 20 million won. That\u2019s also a lot.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll join too.\u201dOf the 23 players that were present, 22 joined the Cheong-hae Guild\u2019s group. With a satisfied look, Cha Min-woo turned to the last one, Seo Jun-ho.\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 Oh.\u201d Seo Jun-ho bent over and tied his shoes tightly before standing back up. He looked at the others.\u201cI\u2019ll go alone.\u201d As they watched him disappear into the sand-filled view, the other players started to whisper.\u201cThat\u2019s Seo Jun-ho? I heard he cleared two Uncleared Gates\u2026\u201d\u201cI guess he\u2019s still greedy for the core.\u201d\u201cI wanted to see him fight. What a waste.\u201dAs he listened to the others talk, Cha Min-woo looked surprised.\u00a0That was Seo Jun-ho? The one who cleared the Curse of Dawn and Leuf\u2019s Garden?He\u2019d never seen a picture of Seo Jun-ho, but he\u2019d heard more than enough rumors. Cha Min-woo had been looking forward to meeting him, but he looked disappointingly shabby. Nor did he sense any particular pressure.(TN: In webtoons/novels, \u2018pressure\u2019 is felt from strong people.)As if they were thinking the same thing, his teammates spoke up.\u201cAs I thought, the rumors were exaggerating.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s divine, he\u2019s a genius, blah blah blah\u2026 He doesn\u2019t even seem that strong.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not worth your concern, Team Leader.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you saying. I was never concerned in the first place.\u201d Cha Min-woo erased Seo Jun-ho from his mind and joined the others.After escaping from the crowd, Seo Jun-ho started to climb the dunes without a particular destination in mind.The Cinder Fox\u2026 It\u2019s something between a monster and a mythical creature.The Cinder Fox he\u2019d defeated in the past had six tails. It could grow up to nine over the course of a thousand years. Once it grew all its tails, it would ascend to the heavens and become the Millenium Fox that watched over its kind.\u201cThe Cinder Fox is stronger the more tails it has.\u201d And they could command Fire Fox soldiers.There was no way to tell how many tails the current Cinder Fox had at the moment. Seo Jun-ho thought that it would be a good idea to find a scouting spot first.I have to find a good vantage point.Seo Jun-ho climbed a number of dunes before he found a suitable hill. From the top, he could see the players in the distance walking in a line.\u201cI can relax now.\u201d The Fire Foxes would find them soon, and then the Cinder Fox would appear. Seo Jun-ho planned to wait until then.I\u2019ll make my move after I see how many tails it has. That\u2019s the first thing I need to do.Seo Jun-ho conjured some chunks of ice and cooled himself down. He wouldn\u2019t have to wait long.Because Fire Foxes have good noses.* * *A scream tore out from the front of the formation.\u201cI-it\u2019s a Fire Fox!\u201d\u201cHow many are there? Thirty\u2026 Forty\u2026 What the hell\u2014there are at least 50!\u201dThey were surrounded in an instant, and the players gulped nervously.Cha Min-woo calmed them down first.\u201cDon\u2019t panic! Follow the strategy! This way!\u201d They came back to their senses and started to move.They pulled out their weapons and readied their skills as they waited for the Fire Foxes to attack.\u2013\u00a0\u201cGrr\u2026\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cKhak.\u201dThey were at least four times bigger than a normal fox. Dozens of them circled the group.The players soon realized that there were only 26 of them, and the 50 clever Foxes rushed them without hesitation.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKhaaa!\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cGraaaagh!\u201dCha Min-woo\u2019s eyes flashed. He calmed the nervous players and waited for the right moment.\u201cNow!\u201d As soon as he gave the command, the players used their magic. The trap hidden under the sand started to activate.Bzzt!Powerful lines of electricity shot out between each machine. The unsuspecting Foxes fell, a burning scent wafting from their flesh.\u201cIt worked!\u201d\u201cThey fell for it!\u201d\u201cPhew, of course they did.\u201d Cha Min-woo felt satisfied as he saw the way the others looked at him. He\u2019d set up the formation to be like a martial arts ring.Methods of hunting have changed from the past.\u00a0It was the age of technology. Things were different from the times when they made weapons by hand and made shabby pitfalls. The researchers at the National Guild of Scientists made weapons that were easy to use. They set the new standards for hunting.And if I\u2019m this good at using weapons and tactics\u2026\u00a0It was only a matter of time before he achieved the title of a ranker.Cha Min-woo had no doubt.\u201cWe\u2019ve already reduced their numbers by half! The time is now!\u201dAs their numbers decreased to 20, Cha Min-woo stepped out of the ring and pulled out his weapon. He continued to give orders as he started to hunt the Fire Foxes. It was important to raise his individual level as well as the level of contribution.Rip! Slice!Like the Cheong-hae elites that they were, Cha Min-woo and his teammates hunted faster than the other players.\u201cAnd here I thought the Gate would be hard because of the Cinder Fox\u2026 This is nothing.\u201d\u201cWe made a good choice. It was right to join the Cheong-hae Guild members.\u201dAs their fear of death started to fade, their abilities started to shine. Not a single player was injured, and they easily won the battle. They gathered around Cha Min-woo.\u201cThat was an amazing strategy. You\u2019re like the reincarnation of Zhuge Liang*.\u201d(PR: A distinguished statesman and military strategist in Ancient China.)\u201cAfter we clear the Gate, your reputation will spread.\u201d\u201cThey say that even brushing collars is a connection. Would you like to trade numbers?\u201d (TN: Basically, even though they don\u2019t really know each other, it counts as a business connection.)They were looking at him like he was a hero. Cha Min-woo laughed.\u201cNow, now, we haven\u2019t won quite yet. The most important battle is still ahead of us.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 That\u2019s right. We still have to fight the Cinder Fox.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019ve already prepared a strategy for that, correct?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s Team Leader Cha, I bet he\u2019s already guaranteed our victory.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thankful that you have so much faith in me.\u201d So he said, but Cha Min-woo was actually nervous.After we clear this Gate, I\u2019ll have taken the first step in becoming a hero.\u00a0He\u2019d have achieved the same thing as the legendary player, Specter.Actually, he\u2019d stand out even more if he defeated the Cinder Fox without a single casualty. He calmed himself and realigned the traps.I was right. It\u2019s best to use the latest technology for weapons and traps.Shortly after the group took a water break, a soft sound came from the distance.Sizzle. Sizzle. Growllll.The sound of stepping on sand? No, the sound of burning sand? The players stood up and grabbed their weapons even though there wasn\u2019t a monster in sight.The primal instinct in their DNA was warning them.\u201cT-Team Leader Cha. What was that?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s here.\u201d Cha Min-woo was nervous for a different reason. He calmed himself.A second later, a great shadow came over them, blocking the sun.\u201cHuh? A shadow\u2026?\u201d As if on cue, the players turned, and their faces fell.\u201cN-no way.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s not the Cinder Fox, is it?\u201dIt was 20 meters long and 6 meters tall, with each tail extending to 5 meters. An enormous monster loomed over them like a building.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe great Cinder Fox stared down at the corpses of the Fire Foxes beneath it. Its eyes flashed like the eyes of a parent who lost their children.Its eyes clouded with sorrow. It raised its head toward the sun and howled.\u2013\u00a0\u201cAwoooooo\u2026!\u201dThere were no mountains, but the sound of its cry rode the dunes until it echoed in the sky.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe players were lost in their panic and stared up in astonishment.[The Boss Monster of the\u00a0\u27eaBurning Dunes\u27eb, the Cinder Fox, has appeared.]From behind its enormous body, nine tails flicked about like thundering clouds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(2)The players stared at the nine swaying tails before them.\u201c\u2026No way. It\u2019s a Nine-tails?\u201d\u201cT-this is crazy! Specter was barely able to defeat a Six-tails!\u201d\u201cAh, ah\u2026\u201dThe players looked to Cha Min-woo, faces turning white. They\u2019d lost the will to fight just by the sight of it.Such was the nature of a \u2018Boss Monster\u2019.Even if he was going to die soon, Cha Min-woo was still an elite. He raised his voice and spoke to the fearful players.\u201cThere\u2019s no place to run within the Gate. As soon as we turn our backs, we\u2019ll all die!\u201dOf course, he hadn\u2019t expected a Nine-tails. But his spirit wasn\u2019t shaken.It\u2019s still a monster. If we pierce its heart or cut its head, it\u2019ll die.Plus, the traps that they\u2019d prepared for the Cinder Fox were at least three times stronger than the first.\u201cWe can do it! Everyone, get it together!\u201d He shook them out of their stupor.\u201cY-yeah. Let\u2019s get it together.\u201d\u201c\u2026We\u2019ll die if we try to run. We should at least get in a punch or two.\u201d The players got back into formation. At the same time, the Cinder Fox slowly started toward them.\u201cNow!\u201dAs soon as he gave the command, the players activated the trap.Bzzzzzt!The trap activated in the same manner as before. The transmitters were three times as thick, and it sounded similar to thunder as it activated.It made the Cinder Fox pause.\u201cI-it worked!\u201d\u201cThe trap worked!\u201d\u201cWe can do it\u2026 We can defeat it!\u201dThey had hope that they would write their names in the pages of history.And then they saw it.Grrraaahh!The eyes of the Cinder Fox, filled with rage.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cG-gah!\u201d They lowered their eyes without even knowing. A shiver ran down their spines and goosebumps prickled their skin under the eyes of the predator.The Cinder Fox splayed its tails like a fan.The magic it released destroyed the trap in one fell swoop.Crackle, pop! Boom!The players started to panic as they looked upon the remains of their trap.\u201cH-how could it break right now?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dDozens of Fire Foxes trailed behind the Cinder Fox. Each one held as much magic as a magic user\u2019s \u2018Fireball\u2019 spell. They attacked at once, breaking through the players\u2019 formations.Crash! Slam!The sand kicked up into the air, and the players started to fall, shrieking.\u201cGaaahh!\u201d\u201cUrk, my leg! My leg!\u201d\u201cI-I\u2026 I can\u2019t see!\u201dAs battle erupted around him, Cha Min-woo shouted to the players.\u201cWhere are you going?! Stick to the formation! If we break it now, we\u2019ll\u2026\u00a0Ahh!\u201dHis shoulder was suddenly filled with burning pain. Quickly turning, he saw that it was ablaze with foxflame.I didn\u2019t even see it coming\u2026!As soon as he put it out, the skin on his shoulder started to blister.This was the strength of his enemies.He was arrogant to ever think that he could defeat them.\u201c\u2026What is this?\u201dWith a dejected look on his face, he let out a low laugh. Weren\u2019t the monsters supposed to be at his level?He shivered. The desert was hot, and the Cinder Fox\u2019s fire only made it hotter. But his chest was starting to feel cold.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis eyes glazed over, conviction broken.It\u2019s over.\u201cNone of our strategies, tactics, or hi-tech equipment worked. How\u2026\u201d How were they supposed to defeat it? How did Specter kill such a monster?He couldn\u2019t find an answer. He looked up at the sky, feeling the heat gather around him. The air above him glowed. The fire fell around the players like a falling sun.At that moment, he thought to himself.Ah\u2026 This is how I die.He had no thought to dodge it, nor did he have any time to process it as the fire hurled toward him.A clear voice brought him back to reality.\u201cStrategies, tactics, and\u2014what was it\u2014hi-tech equipment? Sure, they\u2019re good.\u201dStep, step.A man walked on the hot sand, toward him. He casually stood in front of Cha Min-woo and looked up.\u201cDo you know what you do when you come across a monster that can\u2019t be defeated by those things?\u201dWithout knowing, Cha Min-woo nodded. He didn\u2019t understand why the man thought that, but he thought that he would know the answer.With his scrawny body, Seo Jun-ho was like a light in the darkness.\u201cIt\u2019s simple. Players sought it even when they first appeared. Even after all these years, it\u2019s something that every player needs.\u201dShing!Seo Jun-ho\u2019s sword rang as he pulled it from its sheath.\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming combat ability.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dCha Min-woo\u2019s eyes reflected Seo Jun-ho\u2019s back.Seo Jun-ho sliced from the top to the bottom. With a single swing, his sword cut through a wall of fire.Wooooshhh!It was the Cinder Fox\u2019s strongest attack: Cinder Fireball*. Seo Jun-ho lowered his arm with a frown. (*Same attack as the webtoon but has a different name from the players\u2019 Fireball.)Tsk. Still a long way to go.It had used a third of its magic in the attack, but the poor soul next to him was still in shock.But\u2026 will this be enough?Seo Jun-ho looked behind him and sighed. First, he had to get the others out of harm\u2019s way.He looked back to the Cinder Fox.\u201cTake the others and run.\u201d Already flustered, Cha Min-woo quickly answered.\u201cLight\u2026 I-I mean. What about you, Seo Jun-ho-nim?\u201d Seo Jun-ho turned around in confusion as he heard the formality.\u201cI have to fulfill my inherent duty as a player.\u201d\u201cInherent duty\u2026 as a player?\u201d\u201cWhy\u2019re you asking? Is there anything else I\u2019d do?\u201dHunting monsters and clearing Gates. That was the alpha and omega of the players.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKrahhhh!\u201dThe Cinder Fox directed its fury at the player that had blocked its attack.Seo Jun-ho made a face and muttered to himself.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s hot.\u201d The air around him was as hot as a sauna.I thought this last time too, but this guy sure is hot-blooded.(TN: He uses the word \u2018burn/hot\u2019, which can also mean \u2018wild/full of energy\u2019.)Cha Min-woo had snapped back to his senses and gathered the others behind the dunes. After Seo Jun-ho saw this, he let out a small laugh.\u201cNow that the stragglers are gone\u2026\u201dHe stared into the raging eyes of the Cinder Fox.\u201cYou and me, let\u2019s have some fun.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cGuoohhh!\u201dThe sand exploded as the Cinder Fox roared. But Seo Jun-ho wasn\u2019t shaken. He took a step forward.Wooooosh!Dozens of foxflame started to form again above him.\u201cNow that there\u2019s no one here to see\u2026\u201d He could use his Frost skill as much as he wanted.Crackle!A shield formed before him. It was at least twice as thick as before. With his ice shield in hand, Seo Jun-ho rushed forward.Clang!! Wooooosh!He wasn\u2019t quick enough and foxflame rained on the shield, but Seo Jun-ho gritted his teeth and ran.I have to close the distance for now.\u2013 \u201cGrahhhhk!\u201dStill the human did not stop. The Cinder Fox opened its mouth. It planned to use its strongest attack, Cinder Fireball, once more to stop him by force. Seo Jun-ho blinked.It\u2019s taking a long time to charge up. Is it Cinder Fireball again?If a powerful attack was used, it would give a bigger opportunity. Seo Jun-ho wasn\u2019t stupid enough to miss his chance.\u201cHup!\u201d As the Cinder Fox released Fireball from its mouth, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s aching legs pushed him off the ground and over the dunes.Even though I\u2019m me, if I take a direct hit\u2026Neither his magic nor his body would be able to take it. Knowing this, Seo Jun-ho lowered his shield and stepped on top of it.Woooosh!He rode the shield like a board over the sand dunes.Woooosh!The attack grazed over his head.Anyone watching would have felt their heart race from danger, but Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t even blink.Crash!The dune that was hit exploded and rained down dust.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026Grrr.\u201dThe Cinder Fox narrowed its eyes. It couldn\u2019t see the human because of the sand.\u2013\u00a0\u201cSniff.\u201dBut it could \u2018smell\u2019 it.The Cinder Fox followed the scent and swiped its front paw.Swooooshh!Its claw caught on something. Its eyes quickly turned violent. That was because it hadn\u2019t caught a human, but a towel drenched in sweat. Seo Jun-ho leapt out of the dust and into the air, stepping on its nose.The Frost skill sure is nice.As soon as the dust had started to kick up, he\u2019d thrown the towel and frozen himself. Of course, his scent had been erased perfectly. From the very beginning, the Cinder Fox would only have been able to take the bait.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKyaaak!\u201dHe jumped over its enormous body.(TN: man be jumping like a frog | PR: man be flexing them leg day gains)I\u2019m finally here.As it turned, its nine tails were perfectly in view.The Cinder Fox was a monster that got stronger the more tails it had.Back when he was still Specter, he\u2019d considered the opposite.It gets stronger the more tails it has. But what if the number of tails decreased?Seo Jun-ho brandished his sword. His past self had seen it himself. He was sure of the results.Crackle!The temperature around him dropped.It was because the sword in Seo Jun-ho\u2019s hand radiated a cold energy.Crack!As the sword and tail met, they let out a sound like shattering china. The corner of Seo Jun-ho\u2019s mouth quirked up as he saw the hundreds of ice shards fall before him.\u201cLast time, I got all burned while cutting off each tail one by one\u2026\u201d Thankfully, there was no need to do that anymore. \u201cNow, all I have to do is freeze and break them.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2013\u00a0\u201cKyaaack!\u201dThe Cinder Fox let out a piercing cry as it lost four of its precious tails.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(3)The Cinder Fox is the ultimate predator. It doesn\u2019t have any natural enemies, nor were there ever any beings that could compete with it.In other words, it was the first time it had felt fear in its 1000 years of life.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKrraaaaah!\u201dThe Cinder Fox\u2019s scream shook the earth as it whipped its head around. All it needed to do was crush the tiny human that had dared to wound it. He was smaller than its front paw. But it wouldn\u2019t make the mistake of rushing in blindly.As expected.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes squinted into half-moons. The Cinder Fox still had its guard up as it rushed toward him, but he sensed fear in its movements.Their sole purpose in life is to gain nine tails over a thousand years and become the Millenium Fox.It was no wonder it was scared after losing its tails. One tail took 111 long years to grow.I\u2019m the hunter.\u00a0The one who kills the prey. He would use whatever he could.Once he figured out its weak point, it only got even more defensive. Even if it acknowledged the strength of its hunter, there was nothing it could do.I can probably face it in direct combat now.\u00a0A few moments ago, it would have been impossible to make up for the difference in size and magic. But now that the Cinder Fox had five tails, it was different.\u201cHup!\u201dSeo Jun-ho dashed forward like a bullet. Surprised by the sudden ambush, the Cinder Fox instinctively swiped its paw.Wooooshhh!The air screamed as it split into four directions.That\u2019s how big it was. Simply because of its size, it could play with the laws of physics.Tap!Seo Jun-ho twisted midair, stepping on its paw and launching himself higher. He reached the rear of its body in an instant and swung his sword.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKyraaaaack!\u201dRefusing to fall for the same trick again, the Cinder Fox whipped its body around and crouched down to protect its tails.\u201c\u2026You caught me.\u201d Seo Jun-ho smirked.The intelligent Cinder Fox was not the type to fall for the same trick twice.Other than its tails, there was another place where he could land an effective blow.Slice!Seo Jun-ho swung his sword vertically upright, cutting something soft.The Cinder Fox\u2019s left eye.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026!!!\u201dAll living things feel fear after being injured. And that sense of danger can narrow one\u2019s range of sight.On top of that, the Cinder Fox had just lost an eye. If it was experienced in combat, it would have known to stay calm after receiving a heavy injury. Losing your focus is one of the most dangerous things to do during a battle.\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t know such simple things.\u201d That was how little the Cinder Fox experienced combat. It had never had a competent opponent that could teach it such things.\u201cIf you mess up, you should be punished.\u201dSeo Jun-ho snuck to the Cinder Fox\u2019s left side. After losing its eye, it had become the perfect blind spot.Swoosh! Slice!He started to make scratches on the Cinder Fox\u2019s hide. Blood started to pour out.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKiiiaaaaaaack!\u201dThe Cinder Fox finally started to realize. If it let itself get attacked any more, it would lose its chance of becoming the Millenium Fox and die.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKiack! Kryaaaack!\u201dIt started to swing its paws frantically and dozens of foxflames started to appear.\u201cAnnoying.\u201dEven as Seo Jun-ho stared up at the fire-filled sky, he didn\u2019t say that it was too much. If it was his first time fighting it, he might have given up and run away. But now, it was simply a bit troublesome to deal with. That\u2019s all it was.Woosh!Every time he swung his ice sword, the incoming foxflame exploded on contact. He didn\u2019t dodge when the Cinder Fox raised its paw again.\u201cGet it together. You\u2019re not a Nine-tails anymore.\u201dSlice!With his sharp sword, he could stab through its paw. It had lost a significant amount of magic from its tails, and its defense had fallen as well.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKack! Krrr!\u201dThe Cinder Fox started to cough. After taking multiple blows, its body was falling apart.\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered hoarsely.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKyaaaaack!\u201dThe Cinder Fox gave a final struggle. It still had two charges of its Cinder Fireball. It had surpassed its limits and reached a new stage. But\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201dRiiiip!Bam!Dozens of ice spikes shot from the ground, stabbing the Cinder Fox through. The light in its remaining eye started to fade.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Cinder Fox that was powerful enough to topple dozens of players bowed its head without so much as a final cry. Without magic to power it, its spell disintegrated.\u201cHoo.\u201dThis was a skill he\u2019d practiced when freezing something from far away, but it was the first time he\u2019d actually got to test it out.It\u2019s a good thing that it went as easily as I had expected.Usually, Seo Jun-ho would summon ice weapons by freezing the moisture in the air. But in this kind of environment, it was impossible. So he\u2019d needed a medium.\u201c\u2026It was hard to make them.\u201dHe needed a large amount of liquid. That\u2019s why he\u2019d left so many scratches on the Cinder Fox earlier: to use its blood.\u201cPhew\u2026 Dammit. My body feels like it\u2019s gonna implode.\u201dHe\u2019d pushed his body to its limits and used up all his magic. He just wanted to collapse and rest, but it wasn\u2019t over yet.\u201cI\u2019ll finish what I have to do, and then sleep.\u201dStep, step.He dragged his feet to the dead Cinder Fox and looked up at its corpse.It really was enormous.Without magic to support them, the ice spikes started to melt. It was a desert, after all.Is it because it\u2019s an EX-rank skill? The attack power is outstanding.It wasn\u2019t just the attack power. The Frost skill had many uses, and was also good for defending. Looking back, he didn\u2019t understand how he\u2019d managed to defeat the Frost Queen.\u201cWell, my abilities were different back then.\u201dSmug, Seo Jun-ho sliced through the Cinder Fox\u2019s stomach and stuck his hand in. A moment later, he pulled out an item about the size of a baseball.\u201cGeez, this is gross\u2026\u201d It was the Cinder Fox\u2019s liver. It looked disgusting in shape and color, but that wasn\u2019t an excuse to not eat it.If I eat this, all my stats will go up by 5.Seo Jun-ho squeezed his eyes shut, emptied his mind, and swallowed the raw liver. It felt like forever until it passed, but he was eventually rewarded.[You have ingested the Cinder Fox\u2019s raw liver.][All stats +5.]\u201c\u2026Ick.\u201dAs he gargled his mouth with clean water, the messages popped up.[You have cleared \u27eaBurning Dunes\u27eb.][You have leveled up.][You have leveled up.]\u2026\u2026[All stats have increased by 4.][You have regained 3 Strength stats.][You have regained 2 Speed stats.][You have received \u300cCinder Fox\u2019s Core\u300d as a reward.][The Gate will automatically disappear in 1 hour.]\u201c\u2026\u2026So it\u2019s really over, right?\u201dHe checked his inventory for the core, just in case.And then, he fainted.These days, it was hard to be a reporter in Korea, especially one that reported on Gates. That was because they had to stay from the moment the players entered with no promise of return.It was hard to get up even for a moment because you might miss it when the players come out.\u201cPlease, sunbae-nim*. Let this go, just this once.\u201d(TN: Senpai/Superior.)\u201cNot on your life, newbie. This is how society works. Hand over your money.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Goddammit.\u201dThat\u2019s why reporters tended to work in pairs. They also tended to play games while the players were in the Gate. Sometimes it was chess, sometimes it was go, and sometimes, like now, it was poker.\u201cYou know, they say being a Gate reporter is hard, but it\u2019s a piece of cake. We just get to play while working.\u201d\u201cBullshit. What\u2019s so great about freezing our asses off? I\u2019d rather work overtime at an office.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 The most annoying thing is not knowing when the players will come out.\u201d It had already been two days since they\u2019d entered the Burning Dunes. It was the average amount of time it took to see results, but that also included the duration for failure.Even if they succeeded this time, it would probably take at least another day.\u201cWell, we can go home earlier if they fail.\u201dAs soon as those words left their mouth, the sunbae started scolding them.\u201cLook here, you little bastard. Those people went there for the sake of their country. Don\u2019t be rude.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. It was my mistake.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Just shuffle.\u201dWatching carefully, the hubae* slowly started to shuffle the deck.(TN: Kouhai/Junior.)As they started their 85th poker game, the hubae stared with wide eyes over the sunbae\u2019s shoulders.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you trying out a new poker face or something?\u201d\u201cN-no. Sunbae-nim, the Gates turn red when the players go in, right?\u201d\u201cAre you asking \u2018cause you don\u2019t know? It\u2019s blue before they go in and then red after.\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s what I thought, but\u2026\u201dHearing the hubae talk nonsense, the sunbae wrinkled his forehead.\u201cHey. You have a bad hand, don\u2019t you?

Suddenly, he shot up.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hey, why\u2019s it green?\u201dThe reporter dropped his cards, dumbfounded. The Gate was neither blue nor red. That meant it had been cleared.\u201cWhat? Green?\u201d\u201cWait, so they really did it?\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe clear time was only 13 hours\u2026 They cleared it faster than the previous team failed!\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 This will be a scoop!\u201dThe reporters on standby emerged from their tents and quickly reached for their cameras.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Players started coming out one at a time. The reporters watched nervously, clutching their cameras.\u201cThe battle must\u2019ve been hard. No one looks like they want to talk.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. The Cinder Fox is something else.\u201dEventually, they couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer and started pulling away uninjured players, handing them mics.\u201cHow many tails did the Cinder Fox have?\u201d\u201cWas the inside of the Gate a meadow like it was for the Specter?\u201d\u201cWho would you say was the MVP in the Gate?\u201dThe first two questions were answered easily, but when the third was asked, the players looked to the Gate as if they\u2019d promised to stay silent.What?Their response\u2026 Does that mean they\u2019re not out yet?Who hasn\u2019t come out yet?The reporters wracked their head for an answer.One player\u2019s voice carried over the rest.\u201c\u2026Hey, look, he\u2019s coming.\u201dAll the reporters\u2019 heads turned to look .Step, step.A man was slowly coming out with someone on his back.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cCha Min-woo! Cheong-hae Guild\u2019s Cha Min-woo!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the younger brother of the Guild Master, Cha Won-woo, right?\u201d\u201cThey said he led the players as a group inside the gate.\u201d\u201cYeah. So he\u2019s the MVP this time.\u201dThe reporters quickly started drafting their articles. If they uploaded faster than the others, they would get more views.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the man on his back Seo Jun-ho?\u201d\u201cReally? Why is he carrying him?\u201dAs they watched, the reporters started to look disappointed. He\u2019d already cleared two Uncleared Gates, made a daring statement at his press conference, and was the most famous rookie right now.\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. It seems he couldn\u2019t do much this time around.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t be helped. The elites in high-ranked guilds have been training since they were children.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s never received that kind of formal training. You can\u2019t compare him to the elites.\u201dThe reporters whispered to each other as they waited for Cha Min-woo. He set Seo Jun-ho down carefully in an ambulance and went to receive treatment for his own injuries. As soon as the medic gave the sign that they were done, his interview started.Unlike the other players, he stood behind a podium to answer his questions. That was because the reporters thought he was the MVP.\u201cThey say you led the players to victory. How do you feel?\u201d\u201cI heard that the Cinder Fox had nine tails this time. How difficult was the battle?\u201d\u201cYour name is already trending as the number one searched keyword. You\u2019ve said in the past that being a hero is your dream, so how do you feel now that you\u2019ve achieved that?\u201dCha Min-woo blinked as he listened to their questions. He tapped on his Vita to check if it was true, and frowned.\u201cGoodness\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t seem remotely happy. Confused, the reporters continued to ask him questions.\u201cYou don\u2019t look happy at all. Is there a problem?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dCha Min-woo paused, looking over the podium to the crowd of reporters.\u2026\u2026So this is what it looks like.There were dozens of cameras and faces trained on him. It was supposed to be a sight reserved for heroes who were being interviewed after successfully clearing a Gate. He\u2019d grown up watching their beaming faces on TV. Maybe it was because of that, but at some point, his dream was to become a hero like Specter.This is the perfect chance to achieve my dream.Instead, he closed his eyes. He had no thoughts of shamefully claiming someone else\u2019s achievements. He had to become a star with a light of his own, until he became the sun.Shining in someone else\u2019s light would only make him a lit firecracker.It would be classless.Feeling unburdened, Cha Min-woo opened his eyes.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be standing here in this spot.\u201d The reporters looked confused.\u201cIs he\u2026 being modest?\u201d\u201cHe looks really serious, though.\u201d\u201cFirst Seo Jun-ho and now this guy\u2026 why are the interviewees so cryptic these days?\u201d\u201cLeave it. It\u2019s probably trendy or something. Just ask him what he means.\u201dThe buzzing reporters asked what he meant. Cha Min-woo answered with a solemn voice.\u201cI did not defeat the Cinder Fox. No, to be exact, I\u00a0couldn\u2019t\u00a0defeat it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh? What do you mean? Are you saying that all the other players were lying?\u201d\u201cPlease think carefully about what they said. Did they say that I was the one who defeated it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe reporters tried to remember, drawing a blank. No player had actually mentioned Cha Min-woo.But they definitely called him the MVP when he came out\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Huh? Wait a second.He didn\u2019t come out alone.Then, the MVP of the battle was\u2026Seo Jun-ho?!The cogs in their brains slowed, and their hands started moving instead. They had to make both corrections and follow-ups.(TN: Very bad journalism.)It was all over, and his whole body felt warm, as if he was floating in a hot bath. As soon as the comfortable feeling started to set in, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes fluttered open.\u201cHuh?!\u201d They settled on Cha Si-eun, who let out a loud screech.\u201c\u2026My injuries aren\u2019t even that bad. Why are you so surprised? Did you do something?\u201d\u201cO-of course not. You just woke up so suddenly.\u201d She glanced away.\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\u201c9:28 AM. You slept for eight hours.\u201d\u201c\u2026It seems I was quite tired. Were you here by my side the whole time?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head.\u201cI came here to the hospital at 6 AM. You told me to get up early.\u201d\u201c\u2026Goodness.\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked very sorry.\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that. I was asleep\u2026\u201d\u201cYou could have woken up earlier. Oh, right. I got bored so I organized your commission requests, and you were right\u2026 There were a lot. I mean, that was before. They\u2019re still coming.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been working hard all morning.\u201d As soon as he tried to sit up, Cha Si-eun scolded him.\u201cThe doctor said you overworked yourself. Don\u2019t push yourself and just lie down.\u201d\u201cI tend to have trouble staying still, so it\u2019ll actually be harder for me to stay lying down.\u201dHe pulled away the troublesome bandages and stood up, blinking.\u201cHuh? Your body\u2026 looks alright?\u201dHis muscles still ached, but he just needed to stretch a bit. He\u2019d engaged in a violent battle with the Cinder Fox, but he looked shockingly healthy. Confused, he asked a question.\u201cDid someone feed me an elixir while I was asleep, by any chance?\u201d\u201cFrom what I know, they just gave you some nutrients.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then what was it?\u201dWas the title of The One Who Opens Spring this good? He looked around as he rolled his shoulders.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t mind it. Which hospital are we at?\u201d\u201cHanguk Hospital. Specter-nim is recuperating here too. It\u2019s Korea\u2019s best hospital.\u201dCha Si-eun turned and stared at the ceiling. It seemed that she believed that Specter was somewhere upstairs.\u201cAhem.\u201dFeeling a bit embarrassed, Seo Jun-ho went to the bathroom and changed. As he came out, Cha Si-eun stood up.\u201cYou really don\u2019t need any more rest?\u201d Seo Jun-ho gave a faint smile and shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m fine. President Choi Pil-ho is probably waiting for me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dCha Si-eun pursed her lips as she realized why he was in such a rush. She looked at him with a new look in her eyes.\u201cYou still haven\u2019t fully recovered\u2026 yet you\u2019re already thinking of others.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a bit stiff. But right now, someone is dying and someone else is falling apart from being forced to watch.\u201dChoi Pil-ho probably wanted to sprint here and get the core as fast as he could. But since that wasn\u2019t proper, he was probably pacing around instead as he waited for Seo Jun-ho to wake up.\u201cI can take a break whenever I want after she\u2019s healed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I understand. I\u2019ll escort you, then.\u201dCha Si-eun bowed her head without another word as she opened the door and led him to the parking lot. They arrived at President Choi Pil-ho\u2019s house in no time.He\u2019d already been contacted by Cha Si-eun, and had come out all the way to the front gate to meet them.\u201cIs it ok for you to move around this soon? The articles said you were unconscious\u2026\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re exaggerating. I was just a little tired and slept for a bit.\u201d Seo Jun-ho spoke with a grin as he looked around the large courtyard. \u201cActually, I was wondering if it would be presumptuous of me to come so early in the morning.\u201d\u201cOf course not. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201dAs they went into his house, Choi Pil-ho asked a servant to make coffee. But Seo Jun-ho refused.\u201cNo. Coffee can come later. Where is your daughter\u2019s room? I\u2019ll start with the treatment.\u201dChoi Pil-ho\u2019s complexion brightened at his words and led him directly there.A girl lie on a bed inside the charming, pink room.\u201cEu\u2026 mm\u2026\u2026\u201dThe cold sweat on her forehead, her dry, cracked lips, and her pale complexion were telling of her state.\u2026\u2026It\u2019s worse than I thought.It was admirable how much she\u2019d endured so far.Seo Jun-ho reached into his inventory to pull out the Cinder Fox\u2019s core, and Choi Pil-ho took a few steps back.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I forgot to tell you. Being close to the core may burn you.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m fine\u2026 But is it ok to feed her something so hot?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not just going to feed her.\u201d Seo Jun-ho gripped the core in his hand.\u201cPresident, do you know how the core is used to treat Nine Yin Severance Syndrome?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOf course he didn\u2019t. Even the rich Frenchman had told him he didn\u2019t know.\u201cI do.\u201d At that, both Choi Pil-ho and Cha Si-eun looked surprised. \u201cBecause President Shim Deok-gu told me how.\u201d\u201cWait, how does he know how to treat Nine Yin Severance Syndrome\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe one who used it in the past to treat the Frenchman\u2019s wife was Specter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Oh!\u201dSuddenly, they understood. Shim Deok-gu had been close friends with Specter.Choi Pil-ho took Seo Jun-ho\u2019s hand and squeezed tightly. They should have been hot, but his eyes were determined.\u201c\u2026\u2026Please take care of my daughter.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me. It won\u2019t take too long.\u201dHe forced himself to pull his hands away and left the room with Cha Si-eun so Seo Jun-ho could concentrate.Scrape.Seo Jun-ho sat down on the chair and took the patient\u2019s hand. Her complexion darkened.I see. Her magic circuit\u2019s all clogged up.She was in a worse state than the one he\u2019d treated in the past.For now, I\u2019ll grind down the core to powder and sprinkle it to melt down the circuits\u2026As he started to make a plan, an unexpected message popped up.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[You sense Intermediate-level Yin energy from the target.][You can absorb it with the \u2018Frost\u2019 skill.][Your Magic stat will increase upon absorption.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But the message in front of him didn\u2019t disappear.In my 25\u2026 no, is it my 50 years of life? I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before.The Frost skill really was all-powerful in all aspects.I can even absorb the Magic stat.It really was the perfect skill. Not even Watchguard of Darkness could let him do anything like this.No. It\u2019s too early to draw conclusions.If the Frost skill could absorb Yin energy from a rare disease like this\u2026 It was possible that Watchguard of Darkness could absorb something with a \u2018Darkness\u2019 attribute.Something with a Darkness attribute\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen anything with it, but I\u2019ll have to do some research.This situation wasn\u2019t bad. Actually, it had turned out for the better.If it\u2019s gonna raise my Magic stat, I\u2019m definitely gonna absorb it.And if it worked, he would be able to save the Cinder Fox\u2019s core for another time.Seo Jun-ho slowly closed his eyes and grabbed Choi Sun-hee\u2019s wrist. He concentrated all of his attention into his hands.Shwaaaa.All of the magic in her body pooled into her wrists.First, let me take a look at her magic circulation.He pictured the magic circuits in her head like a drawing. It was much more crowded than an average person\u2019s. The Yin energy had frozen into icicles.I should do this with one push.\u00a0If he prolonged the treatment, it would be hard on the patient.Crackle!Seo Jun-ho\u2019s magic pierced through Choi Sun-hee\u2019s circuits. The icicles cracked and shattered into fragments from the collision of magic. But it wasn\u2019t over yet.It\u2026 looks like a snowball.\u00a0Like a snowball being pushed around in a field, the shards gathered around his magic energy until it started to enlarge. Seo Jun-ho switched his attention over and checked on the patient.\u201c\u2026Oh?\u201d His face became curious.This is beyond my expectations.In the past, he\u2019d used the Cinder Fox\u2019s core to cure Nine Yin Severance Syndrome, using its Yang energy to melt down the frozen magic circuits.It wasn\u2019t good for the patient.\u00a0The two extremes would clash, and he had to work to cancel them out. They were like little explosions within the patient\u2019s body. It was unimaginably painful, both mentally and physically.But now, it was the opposite.Choi Sun-hee let out a slight groan, breathing evenly with a peaceful look on her face.I\u2019m relieved.After making sure she was ok, he no longer felt nervous. Seo Jun-ho grabbed her wrist with both hands, using both of them to absorb the Yin energy. It was faster than using just one.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOf course, it also helped him concentrate. Magic circuits required care and focus. If he made the slightest mistake, he wouldn\u2019t know how it would affect her. So he went slowly, keeping his focus as if he were crossing a rope bridge.Drip.A drop of sweat fell from the bridge of his nose onto the bed sheet, and Seo Jun-ho let out a long sigh. It was finally over.\u201cPhew\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to do this again.\u201d When he glanced at the clock, he found that four hours had passed since he started.Using the core only took about two hours and ten minutes last time\u2026Perhaps it was because the method was different, but it had taken nearly twice that time. But the successful results made him proud.\u201cShe probably won\u2019t have any side effects either.\u201d He\u2019d absorbed all the Yin energy that had spread throughout Choi Sun-hee\u2019s body. It was good for her, but it was even better for him.[Your Magic stat has increased by 5.]Finally, his Magic stat had gone up.\u201cStatus window.\u201d[Seo Jun-ho]Level: 13Title: The One Who Opens SpringStrength: 46\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Stamina: 44Speed: 50\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Magic: 51As he took in his stats, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s lips curled.\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d He laughed like a senile old man. There was no helping it. Even compared to his peak, his stats were crazy good.People tend to deviate slightly from the average stats of their level\u2026\u00a0But he was sure.\u00a0My stats are similar to someone around level 35.In other words, there was no one at his level who could compare to him. On top of that, his Magic stat had finally passed 50.Now I can use Watchguard of Darkness properly.\u00a0The skill required a crazy amount of magic. Of course, he wouldn\u2019t be able to use it as he\u2019d had at his peak, but he\u2019d at least be able to use it at the level it was when he\u2019d first started out as Specter.As he opened the door and left the room, Choi Pil-ho stood up from his seat right outside.\u201cTh-the treatment\u2026\u201d Hearing the trembling in his voice, Seo Jun-ho gave him a bright smile.\u201cIt went well. The disease is cured, and there won\u2019t be any side effects either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Urk.\u201dThere was nothing else he needed to say. President Choi Pil-ho couldn\u2019t form the words. He simply gripped Seo Jun-ho\u2019s hands as his tears fell.The gratitude spilled from his touch, hitting him like a wave.\u201cPlease, go in.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026 I\u2019m really thank\u2026\u00a0Sniff\u2026\u2026\u201dCrying like a child, Choi Pil-ho asked him to wait as he stepped inside.Choi Pil-ho\u2019s estate.Seo Jun-ho sat on the sofa opposite the President.\u201cReally, truly, thank you,\u201d he said once again. His complexion was much brighter after checking on Choi Sun-hee.\u201cI just did what I had to.\u201d\u201cNo. Technically speaking, you were only contracted to bring me the core. You could have demanded me to write up a separate contract and reward for the treatment itself.\u201dIt was true. But Seo Jun-ho hated the dirty feeling of making money with others\u2019 lives on the line.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot in this short span of time about how I could possibly repay you.\u201d Choi Pil-ho looked up at him with warm, grateful eyes. Seo Jun-ho glanced away, feeling pressured by his gaze.\u201cAt first, I considered giving you more money\u2026 But I remembered that when we first made the contract, you didn\u2019t seem like the type of person who\u2019d want that.\u201d\u201cI feel like my finances are stable enough.\u201d Seo Jun-ho already enjoyed luxuries that money both could and couldn\u2019t buy. For him, money was something that was nice to have and something he could always earn if he didn\u2019t.\u201cSo I\u2019ve decided. One time.\u201d Choi Pil-ho raised an index finger.\u201cOne\u2026 time?\u201d\u201cIf you ever need our help, the Myungho Group will do everything in our power to assist you that one time.\u201dOnly once.It seemed cheap. But Seo Jun-ho tried to imagine what he could do with their power.\u2026\u2026No, it would be quicker if I considered the opposite.Rather than what they\u00a0could\u00a0do, it was faster to list what they\u00a0couldn\u2019t.\u00a0The Myungho Group was Korea\u2019s number 1 company.They also had one particular weapon in a specific field. A guild.The Scarlet Tower.The guild whose leader was Choi Pil-ho\u2019s eldest son.People called it a nation of players, ranking as the top 5 guild in Korea.I\u2019ll be able to call them up as reinforcements when I really need them.\u00a0Overwhelmed by the thoughts of his reward, Seo Jun-ho bowed his head lightly.\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to use it carefully so as to not harm the Myungho Group\u2019s reputation.\u201d\u201cHahaha, just give me the word. You\u2019re our family\u2019s savior.\u201d Choi Pil-ho gave a generous look. \u201cThen, how about we have a meal together? We missed it last time.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cYour secretary should come too.\u201d Seo Jun-ho was hungry and didn\u2019t refuse.It was the best meal he\u2019d had after being freed from the ice.* * *Cha Si-eun wouldn\u2019t stop repeating herself after they returned to the Association.\u201cThe doctor said you should rest\u2026 At least four days\u2026 Don\u2019t do any strenuous exercises\u2026 Understand?\u201d\u201cI said I got it. But Secretary Cha should go home early today too. You\u2019ve worked hard since early in the morning.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Really?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d As he nodded, her face brightened a bit.\u201cTh-then\u2026 I\u2019ll go home early and spend some time reading.\u201d\u201cYou like to read?\u201d\u201cThe old scholars would say that books hold the secrets of the world.\u201d To think that she would voluntarily spend her free time studying; she really was a model student. Deok-gu kept praising her as an elite, after all.\u201cI hope you enjoy your reading, then.\u201d\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. And I\u2019ll just say this one more time\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll rest for at least four days and not do any strenuous exercises.\u201d\u201cWow, you\u2019ve memorized it. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201dSeo Jun-ho watched her leave blankly with a satisfied look on his face.\u201c\u2026\u2026Why does everyone nag me so much?\u201d Were the people around him just like that? Or was he himself the problem? He shook his head as he went up to the Association\u2019s executive office.\u201cOh!\u201d Deok-gu exclaimed as he saw him. He grinned as he patted Seo Jun-ho\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI just got off a call with Choi Pil-ho. I heard she made a full recovery. He was really happy.\u201d\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t stop smiling.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great. How\u2019re you feeling?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. My muscles are just a bit sore.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Did they give you an elixir or something?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, but they said they didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYour body\u2019s amazing.\u201d The two sat down on the sofa as they talked. \u201cThe press is a mess right now. They\u2019re calling every few seconds, asking when you\u2019ll be free to give interviews.\u201d\u201cInterviews\u2026\u2026?\u00a0Tsk, that\u2019s annoying. I held a press conference not long ago.\u201d\u201cThat was for Leuf\u2019s Garden, but this time, you defeated the Cinder Fox. Aren\u2019t you starting to realize how great your feats are?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so annoying\u2026\u2026\u201d When Shim Deok-gu saw how serious he was about it, he spoke with a wave of his hand.\u201cThen just ditch it. Just do what you did in the past.\u201d\u201cIn the past?\u201d\u201cUnless it\u2019s really important, don\u2019t do interviews at all\u2026\u2026 You know, the \u2018mysterious\u2019 concept.\u201dSeo Jun-ho considered this, then nodded.\u201cI won\u2019t go all the way, but I\u2019ll pass this time. They\u2019d probably ask really basic, simple questions, and I don\u2019t want to waste my precious time.\u201d\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\u201cThanks. Oh, and\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho took out the Cinder Fox\u2019s core from his inventory. The temperature in the room suddenly shot up, and Shim Deok-gu frowned as he loosened his tie.\u201cHey, it\u2019s hot. What is that?\u201d\u201cThe Cinder Fox\u2019s core.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShim Deok-gu looked between Seo Jun-ho and the core with a confused look.\u201cWhat? It gave you two?\u201d\u201cHey, the core isn\u2019t a ramen soup packet. It only gave me one.\u201d(TN: He\u2019s saying that the core doesn\u2019t drop by accident. It sounds funnier in Korean lol)\u201cWhat? But Choi Pil-ho\u2019s daughter made a full recovery\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t use the core for that.\u201dCrackle.As he activated the Frost skill, the temperature went down again. Shim Deok-gu looked happy as he tightened his necktie again.\u201cAh, that\u2019s nice. You\u2019re lucky. You can save money on your electricity bills during the summer.\u201d\u201cPfft.\u00a0Anyways, I cured Choi Sun-hee with the Frost skill. I absorbed all the Yin energy from the disease.\u201d Shim Deok-gu tilted his head.\u201c\u2026\u2026Is that possible?\u201d\u201cYeah, it worked. It even raised my Magic stat.\u201d\u201cDamn, you really can use that skill for anything.\u201dShim Deok-gu looked momentarily bored, but his eyes flashed as he realized something.\u201cHold on. Does that mean you can absorb items with Yin energy?\u201dSmart dude.Seo Jun-ho grinned. He\u2019d been thinking the same thing. \u201cWhy else would I mention it?\u201d\u201cAha.\u00a0You want me to find those items for you.\u201d He snorted as if annoyed, but he didn\u2019t look mad.\u201cThanks. There\u2019s a problem, though. The disease\u2019s energy level was only Intermediate, and it only raised my Magic by five.\u201d\u201cHm.\u00a0Nine Yin Severance Syndrome is so potent that modern medicine can\u2019t even touch it\u2026 but it\u2019s only Intermediate-level? That means most items won\u2019t even trigger the message.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing.\u201d Shim Deok-gu raised his hands, surrendering to Seo Jun-ho\u2019s continuous demands.\u201cAh, yes, yes~ Your wish is my command, Seo Jun-ho-nim.\u201d\u201cI want to know if Watchguard of Darkness is able to absorb things too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Of course. It would be good to know.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euSkills with specific attributes were rare. And Seo Jun-ho was the only player who had attribute skills that were S- and EX-rank. That meant he had no other choice but to do the research himself.Shim Deok-gu considered this for a moment before nodding.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll look for items you can use while you go look in the Market.\u201d Of course, he wasn\u2019t talking about the neighborhood supermarket.He was talking about the global Player Market.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of the Frozen PlayerCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBlack Market (1)There\u2019s nothing the Player Market didn\u2019t have. It had elixirs, weapons, armor, alchemic materials, skill books, and everything else. You could buy anything as long as you had the money.It was popular even among non-players as a place to shop, so it was always full of people.\u201cIt looks exactly the same as before.\u201d Seo Jun-ho stared up at the entrance, a new feeling filling him. Around 29 years ago, Insa-dong\u2019s flea market had sold nothing more than spare parts. But now, it had transformed into a Player Market.Korea only has two branches. Insa-dong in Seoul, and Nampo-dong in Busan.(TN: \u2018-dongs\u2019 are neighborhoods within big cities.)And today, he was at the Seoul location. The LED sign was much more familiar than the hologram.The streets are a lot livelier now.\u00a0There had been non-players in the area in the past, but not as many as there were now. The large market street was filled with people and couples. Seo Jun-ho strolled around the loud market, looking at the items on display.They have a big assortment.\u00a0There only seemed to be Low- and Intermediate-level items.They still keep all the good stuff inside.\u00a0Deeper in, there was the \u2018Black Market\u2019. You needed a special player skill to get in.But Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t see a need to go through all that, so he\u2019d asked Deok-gu about it.The Black Market entrance changes every year, so the old one won\u2019t work.All of Korea\u2019s populous cities had theaters and restaurants. Just like Player Markets*.(TN: Just like there are markets all over the world, every Korean city has these.)\u201cFound it.\u201d Seo Jun-ho started inside the theater. Most people were using ticket machines out of convenience, but he headed to the counter.\u201cWelcome.\u201d The male worker gave him a bright smile as he greeted him. Seo Jun-ho spoke the password that Deok-gu had given him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the best movie you\u2019re showing?\u201d The worker\u2019s smile didn\u2019t falter as he replied.\u201cActually, all the movies we\u2019re showing right now have good reviews.\u201d\u201cThen, can you give me a ticket for the shortest movie and a cup full of ice?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The worker\u2019s face stayed the same as he coolly handed over the ticket and the cup full of ice.Theater 8, seat G-10.As soon as he sat down, the commercials stopped and the screen shut off. If he went to the movies often, he would have known that no one paid attention to other people. On top of that, his seat was in the back corner of the theater.The audience held their breaths as the movie started, and Seo Jun-ho\u2019s seat started to leak a small amount of magic.It\u2019s working.He didn\u2019t resist it. His body disappeared from the theater in an instant, without a sound. No one in the audience noticed, too consumed by the movie.Transport\u2014or teleport magic, as it was often called\u2014felt similar to when you entered a Gate. But depending on the skill of the user, it could cause motion sickness.Ugh\u2026 Skaya\u2019s teleport magic really is the best.Seo Jun-ho stood at a street entrance as he tried to soothe his nausea. The passersby gave him occasional glances as they passed. They were all people who had the right to enter the Black Market.Every country has their individual Player Market, but the Black Market is different.All the Player Markets of the world were simply ports that lead to here.This place\u2026 It\u2019s Estonia, I think.The Black Market was an underground market in a European country whose name was unfamiliar. It was perhaps for that reason that the sky, no, the ceiling was covered in glittering rocks instead of the sun and moon.There were only ten people in the world who knew where this wonderful place was.Well, that was an old saying, so it\u2019s probably changed since then.Skaya had complained about the incompetent teleporters and backtracked her magic to find the location so she could teleport herself. That was why he knew where it was. After that, Seo Jun-ho had never used a Market teleporter. All he\u2019d had to do was ask Skaya.The Market owner hated her because of that.\u00a0Of course, he wasn\u2019t obvious about it because he valued his life.After taking in his surroundings, Seo Jun-ho started moving. The Black Market had no guides or anyone to help those that entered it.It will never become a normal shopping center like the Player Market.\u00a0There was a reason why normal people and low-level players were denied access. The Black Market was like an independent state in the underworld. There was no common language or common sense here.If you so much as brush shoulders or look at someone the wrong way, some would kill you.You could do anything in the Market if you had the money.The Black Market took that a step further. All you had to do was bribe keepers if you wanted them to turn a blind eye to murder.But Seo Jun-ho\u2019s steps were confident. There was a very low chance of running into any players that were stronger than him.Most of the good players went to the 2nd floor. Maybe it\u2019s because the Frontier requires you to be level 30 or higher.Most of the players on Earth were either below level 30 or came down from the 2nd floor because they were unable to handle it.So, with his current stats, he could take on anyone that came at him.It\u2019s here.Seo Jun-ho stared up at the worn sign as he found the store he was looking for.[Ginosha\u2019s Secondhand Store]It was written in English, and the store sold what most people would consider junk or trash. Most players wouldn\u2019t go in even if they died and came back to life, but it was the perfect place where Seo Jun-ho might find the items he was looking for.Creak!\u00a0The old door shrieked as he entered. The stench of dust filled his nose.\u201cWelcome.\u201d A shabby, blonde man greeted him, and looked at his newspaper as he saw Seo Jun-ho. \u201c\u2026\u2026Oya? Look at that, it\u2019s the Korean celebrity.\u201d The newspaper he was reading had Seo Jun-ho\u2019s picture on the front page.He didn\u2019t have to read it. The article was probably raising him up for defeating the Cinder Fox.The man lit his cigarette and spoke with it between his teeth.\u201cWhatever you\u2019re looking for, I don\u2019t think you can find it here.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this a secondhand store?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Hm.\u00a0So you came even though you knew that.\u201d His forehead wrinkled as he looked around his store. \u201cWell, take a look. There won\u2019t be anything useful, though.\u201d\u201cDo you have items with specific attributes?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026That aisle, second shelf.\u201d As he made his way over, Seo Jun-ho nodded at the sight of the mountain of items.Bingo.Items with certain abilities were called \u2018artifacts\u2019 and were often sold at higher prices. But that didn\u2019t mean that all artifacts were useful. Some inflicted curses, and some had such strict requirements that they were practically useless. Those items were left at this store.He looked at the dusty pile, hoping something would catch his eye.It\u2019s a gold mine.Seo Jun-ho\u2019s lips curled as he looked up at the worker\u2019s back. Countless messages were popping up before him.[You sense Low-level Cold energy from the target.][You sense Low-level Yin energy from the target.][You sense Low Intermediate-level Frost from the target.]\u2026\u2026The items had been abandoned for decades in the corner of the store, and they cried out to him. Just like that, Seo Jun-ho found eight artifacts with an Ice attribute. Most of them were just Low-levels, but he was lucky and managed to find a Low Intermediate-level.With this much, my Magic stat should go up at least a bit.Holding his items, he went back to the shifty man. The worker put out his cigarette in an ashtray and spoke.\u201c\u2026\u2026What? You\u2019re buying all this?\u201d\u201cCan I not?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that\u2026 Yeah. I should be thanking you.\u201d He lowered his head and pulled out a cash register from below the counter.\u201cI\u2019m saying this now, but no matter how much you complain that they\u2019re useless, these guys were expensive because they\u2019re artifacts with attributes.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I like your attitude.\u201dHe banged at the register and glanced up at Seo Jun-ho.\u201cEven the shabbiest ones start at 50 million won\u2026\u2026 And in my opinion, this one can be really good with the right user. It\u2019s worth around 400 million won.\u201d(TN: 50m KRW\u00a0\u2248\u00a044k USD, 400m KRW\u00a0\u2248\u00a0350k USD)\u201cSo what\u2019s my total?\u201d\u201c1.02 billion won for eight of these\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll take off the 20 mil at the end.\u201d(TN: around 900k USD)After seeing the price, Seo Jun-ho turned around, but it was the worker that got hasty.\u201cW-wait! I\u2019ll take out another 10 million won\u2026\u2026!\u201dHis panicked voice made him stop, but Seo Jun-ho had already decided.It\u2019s cheap.An elixir that raised your Magic stat by 1 started at around 1 billion won. But these eight artifacts were being sold to him at the same price. So he turned around and went back to the store.I\u2019ll check one more time to see if there are any other Ice attribute items, and look for Darkness attributes while I\u2019m at it.He spent 30 more minutes searching, eventually finding two Low-level Ice items. Unfortunately, there were no items with the Darkness attribute. It was extremely rare, after all.When he went back to the counter with the two extra items, there were two more cigarette butts in the ashtray.\u201cHuh? You want to buy those too\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cHow much is it?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201dThe worker pushed the eight items toward him, deep in thought.\u201c1.1 billion won for everything.\u201d(PR: Around 970k USD)So he would only charge 50 million each for the two extra.Nice.He hadn\u2019t planned to haggle, but he wouldn\u2019t refuse a discount.\u201cI\u2019ll buy everything.\u201d\u201cGoodness! Celebrities sure are different.\u201dThe worker quickly rung up the items as if he were afraid that Seo Jun-ho would change his mind.\u201cNow then\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho put the items in his inventory and leaned in. \u201cSince I\u2019ve bought this many, won\u2019t you show me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What do you mean?\u201d As soon as he feigned innocence, Seo Jun-ho gave an annoyed look.\u201cI overheard from some rookies that your best artifacts and items are kept in a different room.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe worker scratched his head as he gave a bleary look.\u201c\u2026\u2026Dammit. Where\u2019d ya hear that?\u201d\u201cNo comment.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGeez. So many loose-lipped bastards these days.\u201d The worker walked toward the entrance.Clink.He locked the door and flipped the sign to \u201cCLOSED\u201d before he lit another cigarette. He jutted his chin.\u201cFollow me.\u201dSeo Jun-ho\u2019s steps were light as he followed him inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, there was one with an Ice attribute.There\u2019s only one.\u00a0A glove radiating a cold aura. He picked it up.As soon as he did, the worker\u2014who\u2019d been leaning against the wall with a fresh cigarette\u2014suddenly leaped forward.\u201cHey, hey, you can\u2019t just touch that!\u201d He rushed over, snatched the glove from Seo Jun-ho\u2019s hand and put it back in its place. He let out a long sigh, looking like he\u2019d just lost 10 years of his life.\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy item. It\u2019s cursed, I tell you! It has a great boost, but sometimes the magic converges and freezes the user\u2019s body. It\u2019s already happened three times.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Let me take a look.\u201d Seo Jun-ho felt a pull toward the item. He checked the info.\u300cGlove That Holds the Frost Fairy\u2019s Wrath\u300dGrade: Rare (Curse)Speed +1Stamina +1Magic +2Wrath of the Frost Fairy:Occasionally freezes the body of the user.Requirements: Level 10, Speed 40, Magic 50[You sense Intermediate-level Frost from the target.][You can purify the item.]\u2026\u2026Amazing.\u00a0It was on the same level as Nine Yin Severance Syndrome. That meant it could raise his Magic stat by around 5 again. Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cHow much is this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re really gonna buy it?\u201d The worker licked his lips as he glanced toward him. \u201cYou probably know from looking at its data, but this would sell for at least around 3 billion won if it were purified by someone skilled.\u201d(TN: around 2.7m USD)\u201cAnd its current price?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Well, it\u2019s annoying to have an item that can harm customers\u2026 It\u2019s also hard to find someone who can purify it, so I\u2019ll offer 1.8 billion.\u201d(TN: about 1.6m USD)It was a cheap price to pay for a rare-grade item. Seo Jun-ho nodded coolly.\u201cIs this all you have? No items with a Darkness attribute?\u201d\u201cPfft.\u00a0Do you think there would be Light or Darkness items in this kind of place? They might have some in the 2nd floor market though.\u201dThe 2nd floor. I have to go there sometime.After adding the glove to his total, the worker saw him off with a wide grin.\u201cPlease come again!\u201dAfter leaving, Seo Jun-ho looked around in the artifact store too. But the player items started at 1 billion won, even if they were the lowest grade.\u201cSo overpriced.\u201d Seo Jun-ho shook his head and started toward a bar near the center of the Black Market. It wasn\u2019t because he was hungry.\u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to do. I\u2019ll just go back.\u201d A teleporter was required to enter the Black Market, and it was the same for leaving. This bar provided this service. Of course, it also served alcohol like a normal bar, and was a place to buy and sell information.As soon as Seo Jun-ho entered the bar, the other players looked up to stare at him.\u201cHey, that guy\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI think I saw him on the news. Korea\u2019s rising star or something?\u201d\u201cI heard he caught the Cinder Fox.\u201d\u201cReally? Not bad for a newbie.\u201dTheir attention and impressions came at him like knives. Seo Jun-ho ignored them and walked toward the bartender who was cleaning glasses.\u201cInformation? Drinks? Or\u2026 Are you looking to be teleported?\u201d\u201cYes. To the Insa-dong branch in Korea.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait around 10 minutes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have a drink while I wait, then. A martini, please.\u201d He listened to the chatter around him as he sipped his martini.\u201cThe amount I won from gambling this time\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you hear? No one\u2019s seen Kim Woo-joong of the Nine Heavens lately.\u201d\u201cJust how long is the Association gonna hide Specter for?\u201d As he listened, Seo Jun-ho suddenly wrinkled his forehead.\u201cTsk.\u00a0The Black Market isn\u2019t like it was in the past. Did you see Seo Jun-ho come in?\u201d\u201cOf course I did. He\u2019s not even level 20 yet, is he?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s barely over level 10.\u201d\u201cGeez, is the Association trying to say they\u2019re better or something?\u201dThe chatter was starting to annoy him. Seo Jun-ho clicked his tongue.Tsk. Those insects are already starting to gather.A player\u2019s name was their brand. The more acclaimed they became, the more expensive they were to hire and the better contracts they got. And of course, they became more famous and would get more admirers.But it was difficult to raise your reputation. Even if you risked your life in Gates, you needed to stand out. Most players\u2019 names never spread beyond third-rate internet articles.But there\u2019s one way you can guarantee it.Seo Jun-ho raised his hand, gesturing toward the bartender.\u201cI want to buy some information.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of information?\u201d\u201cInformation on those three players sitting in the booth on the left.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Understood.\u201d The experienced bartender didn\u2019t even glance toward them as he disappeared. Seo Jun-ho chewed on the olive as he waited for the bugs to come find him.The best way to raise your reputation is to win in a fight against a famous player.It was the simplest, most obvious way to signal to others that you were better. Naturally, their conversation started to flow in that direction.\u201cHm.\u00a0Is he really that amazing? He looks pretty weak.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t judge a player by their looks. But\u2026\u201d\u201cClearing a Gate and fighting a player is different. Is that what you\u2019re gonna say?\u201d\u201cExactly. Fighting a monster and fighting a person is fundamentally different.\u201d\u201cFufu, he\u2019s good prey\u2026\u2026 What do you think?\u201d The two men exchanged looks and stood up to walk toward Seo Jun-ho. At that moment, the bartender returned and handed an envelope to Seo Jun-ho.\u201cHere is the information you requested. It\u2019ll be 3,000 dollars.\u201d Seo Jun-ho held out his left hand. \u201cTake another hundred. As a tip.\u201d(TN: Man I wish I could bartend for SJH.)\u201cThank you.\u201d Seo Jun-ho ripped open the envelope and skimmed through the documents.23, 25, 22.\u00a0Those were the levels of the men that were headed toward him. The information on their skills and specialties was short, but there was nothing that would be dangerous to him.They\u2019re just some lowlife thugs.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho quickly covered his mouth to hold back a laugh.\u00a0It almost feels like I planned this myself.Those who\u2019ve experienced infestations know that pests have to be stamped out completely from the start. If you missed even one, they would multiply uncontrollably.They probably think that I\u2019m the best prey.\u00a0Well, their levels were almost twice as high. In a normal situation, they wouldn\u2019t be able to lose even if they wanted to.\u00a0It\u2019s a move often used by those who\u2019ve never really achieved anything.Stamping out budding talents, that is. It was a cheap, nasty tactic, but it was effective. Negative attention was still attention, after all.It\u2019s a different kind of annoyance from the past.\u00a0Back then, there were also many pests who came after them. But they were a little different. They would flatter him while scrunching their eyes.\u00a0Back then, simply being able to greet me would raise your specs.So it was more fun this time. It had been a long time since someone had faced him head-on.I don\u2019t want anything personal\u2026\u00a0But it was the same for them. They didn\u2019t have anything specifically against him, but they were picking a fight for their own interests.Then, I\u2019ll use you too.\u00a0That way, no other pests of this kind would come after him.Seo Jun-ho placed his empty glass down with a clink.\u201cOi.\u201d\u00a0Tap, tap.\u00a0An unfamiliar, coarse hand hit at his shoulder, making him feel dirty. \u201cAre you Seo Jun-ho? I\u2019ve seen you a lot in articles. We\u2019re big fans.\u201d\u201cYeah, I collect scraps of your pictures.\u201d The men laughed with their teeth bared. They slid into the seats next to him, showering him with unwanted praise.\u201cActually, we\u2019re really proud of you.\u201d\u201cFrom a sunbae\u2019s perspective, we\u2019re proud of outstanding hubaes like you.\u201d\u201cWe want to teach our cute little hubae.\u201d Seo Jun-ho smiled as he listened, nodding.\u201cSunbaes\u2026\u2026 When did you guys debut?\u201d\u201cHuh? Well, I\u2019m the oldest and I debuted four years ago\u2026\u2026 Hey, you guys debuted over three years ago, right?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d\u201cWow, you guys are experienced.\u201d The men stood up straighter at his admiration.\u201cAhem.\u00a0Well, since you mentioned it, it\u2019s thanks to us that you guys can hunt easily.\u201d\u201cOf course. It\u2019s because people like us paved the way, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Pft!\u201d Seo Jun-ho exploded into a fit of laughter. Once he started, he couldn\u2019t stop. \u201cHa\u2026\u00a0Pft\u2026\u00a0Ahahaha!\u201d He hunched over the table, gripping his stomach as his shoulders shook with laughter.The mens\u2019 faces darkened. Their voices became low.\u201c\u2026\u2026Why are you laughing?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be funny, you know.\u201dThe warm conversation suddenly shifted. Seo Jun-ho slowly raised his head, wiping the tears from his eyes.\u201cOf course it\u2019s funny. You paved the way? The 1st generation of players did.\u201d It hadn\u2019t even been five years since they debuted. For a 1st-generation player like Seo Jun-ho, it sounded ridiculous.The men wouldn\u2019t sit still against a hubae who was now speaking informally and insulting them. They stood up, enraged.\u201cYou\u2019re just a stupid kid!\u201d\u201cHow dare you insult your sunbaes?\u201d\u201cWe need to teach him a lesson.\u201dEven as they stood over him, he wasn\u2019t the least bit scared. In fact, he smiled as he asked them a question.\u201cDo you guys know what the handle of a millstone is called?\u201d They responded immediately.\u201cAn eoi.\u201d\u201cIf it falls off while you\u2019re grinding something, you don\u2019t have an eoi.\u201d\u201cThis situation we\u2019re in? There\u2019s no eoi, you bastard hubae.\u201d(TN: \u2018Eoi\u2019 is the name of the handle, but when something\u2019s ridiculous\u2014basically a bruh moment\u2014in Korean, we say \u2018there is no eoi\u2019. \u2018Eoi\u2019 doesn\u2019t really mean anything, it\u2019s just an expression.)\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThey looked dumb, but they were smarter than he thought. Seo Jun-ho stood up with a sullen look on his face, having had his line stolen from him.\u201cWell, your goal was obvious from the beginning. Let\u2019s drop the act.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You knew?\u201d\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t run away\u2026\u2026 I applaud your courage.\u201d The men took it in stride, grinning as they surveyed the area. Everyone in the bar was watching. It\u2019s what they wanted. They exchanged looks and spoke loudly.\u201cWe just wanted to teach our hubae a few things\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut seeing how disrespectful he is, I don\u2019t think we can just let this go with a short lesson.\u201d\u201cRemember, you brought this upon yourself.\u201d The man who\u2019d debuted the longest time ago gestured him over with a finger.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNo need to talk. Come here. We\u2019ll show you how great your sunbaes are.\u201d He didn\u2019t feel the need to reply. Seo Jun-ho turned to the bartender who was watching everything unfold.\u201cHow much time is left until I can teleport?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Around four minutes.\u201d\u201cFour minutes. I see.\u201d Seo Jun-ho rolled his shoulders, stretching them out. \u201cThat\u2019s more than enough time to play with them.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The three men stood proud as the audience whispered among themselves.\u201cThey\u2019re so shameless.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s barely over level 10, and they want to use him to get their name out\u2026? They\u2019re animals.\u201d\u201cWell, if he ends up being weak, that\u2019s just how things work in this world. It\u2019s not like I want to help, either.\u201d\u201cSeo Jun-ho\u2019s at his peak right now. It\u2019ll be a huge blow for him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why they\u2019re picking a fight. If they win, the media will go crazy.\u201d In fact, there were those that were using their Vita to record them. Seeing this, the three men smiled at each other.This is perfect.What did I say? This guy\u2019s a walking gold mine.After today, we\u2014the Gangnam Trio\u2014will be famous!They were confident because their levels were high.Since our levels are higher, our stats will be higher too.He\u2019s just a novice who\u2019s never fought against other people in earnest.The first one that stepped up was the level 22 player who held a lance.\u201cThey call us the Three Reapers of Gangnam. We wield the lance, the sword, and magic with great talent. I am the Life-Severing Lance. You should be honored.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Sigh.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the one who should be honored. He\u2019d never even heard of such a lame-sounding group. Even the onlookers looked at each other in confusion. \u201cThree Reapers?\u201d \u201cGangnam?\u201dThis will do.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho pulled out a small dagger from his inventory. It was thin and small, about the length of his palm. The Life-Severing Lance wrinkled his forehead as he watched.\u201c\u2026\u2026Is that your weapon? It\u2019s different from what I saw in the papers. Aren\u2019t you a sword user?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for catching cows. This\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you gonna say it\u2019s for catching chickens?\u201d Seo Jun-ho twirled the dagger in his hands as he turned.\u201cNo, it\u2019s for killing bugs.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You bastard!\u201d Red-faced, the Life-Severing Lance lunged without warning like a third-rate fighter.\u201cOh my god!\u201d\u201cWhat a cheat!\u201d The audience erupted in disapproval as they held their breath. As they did, the space between the two men shrank from 10 meters to 5. In the blink of an eye, the Life-Severing Lance\u2019s weapon arrived in front of Seo Jun-ho\u2019s heart. And then\u2014Crash!The Life-Severing Lance rolled onto the floor.\u201cGah\u2026..!\u201d He couldn\u2019t even scream as his back folded.\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to swing a lance so obviously\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho spoke in a soft voice as he stood over him. He wanted to scream, but he couldn\u2019t find the energy to do so. \u201c\u2026\u2026Well. I\u2019d say you live up to your name.\u201d\u201cThe bastard, he was too cocky. He\u2019s the Association\u2019s rising star, after all.\u201d His teammates shook their heads. They still looked confident.He thought Seo Jun-ho wouldn\u2019t be able to react at all and rushed in.His opening was too big. It\u2019s not hard to flip him over if the opponent is waiting for it.\u00a0They didn\u2019t seem to make much of it.This is a lot easier than I thought.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho stepped on the Life-Severing-whatever\u2019s back.\u201cAck!\u00a0It\u2014it hurts!\u201d(TN: He switched to formal speech lol)As soon as he cried out, his teammates\u2019 faces fell.\u201cHey, move your foot!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still being so disrespectful to your sunbae.\u201d\u201cI was never respectful in the first place though? You said you\u2019d teach me.\u201dThe Life-Severing Sword brandished his weapon, as if provoked. Seo Jun-ho recalled what he\u2019d said earlier.It was that guy. He said killing a monster and killing a human are fundamentally different.He knew that all too well. When you fight monsters, you immediately go for the weak points. But it was hard to do that with a human\u2014especially if you\u2019d never killed before.But he chose the wrong opponent.\u00a0His words were irrelevant to Seo Jun-ho. When he was Specter, he\u2019d killed a countless number of fiends.\u201cNo more playing around. Take out your sword, Seo Jun-ho.\u201d He held out his dagger. His opponent let out a deep sigh. \u201cIt seems that you\u2019re underestimating the Three Reapers of Gangnam because of that guy.\u201d He assumed that Seo Jun-ho chalked them up to the same level as the Life-Severing Lance. \u201cDon\u2019t regret it later on.\u201d\u201cSpeak for yourself. Don\u2019t make excuses when you lose.\u201dNeither the Three Reapers of Gangnam nor their descendants would be able to live up this battle. Whether he knew or not, the Life-Severing Sword silently charged his sword with magic.Wooong!A faint, thin aura covered the sword. Seeing this, the audience ooh\u2019d.\u201cWoah! He knows how to use sword ki?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d have to be good at magic to use that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s amazing for his current level.\u201dSword ki* was a technique that overlaid the sword with magic to enhance its sharpness and durability. If you used it on a knife, it became knife ki; if you used it on a lance, it became lance ki.(TN: Weaker version of sword aura, where the ki physically manifests.)Sword ki? Yeah right.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho shook his head. People who didn\u2019t know better would be impressed, but it was a fake.\u00a0He probably saw it once and is trying to imitate the shape.There was a reason why sword ki was so impressive. With it, you could cut things that couldn\u2019t be cut and pierce things that couldn\u2019t be pierced. But his sword ki was all for show and barely did anything.The sword is probably more destructive, but its durability is decreasing at this very second.Seo Jun-ho was bored by the sloppy technique, but the Life-Severing Sword took his expression differently.\u201cHoo, it\u2019s no surprise that you\u2019d be scared after realizing how much stronger I am. But it\u2019s too late for you.\u201d He slowly walked toward Seo Jun-ho.\u00a0 He thought he would be able to win if he didn\u2019t give an opening like the Lance had. But Seo Jun-ho thought differently.He\u2019s messing up.\u00a0He\u2019d hunted a lot of fiends as Specter, winning consecutive matches against those that were much stronger than the average player. Some thought that he was able to win because of his incredible weaponry skills or because of his S-rank skills. Of course, those were part of the reason, but there was a bigger factor.Breath.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho was good at stealing his opponents\u2019 breaths. Experts let in and let out an equal amount of breath from the beginning of the battle. But inexperienced fighters couldn\u2019t do that.Generally, when someone untrained is caught by surprise, they take a deep breath.\u00a0In the moment that their lungs get filled, their body would get stiff. Seo Jun-ho relished in interrupting his opponent\u2019s breath and creating an opening.Of course, it doesn\u2019t work on people that are good\u2026\u00a0But luckily, the one in front of him wasn\u2019t.\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d The onlookers were confused. They thought Seo Jun-ho had been cornered, but he walked up to the Sword on his own.Is he giving up?It\u2019s like a trapped mouse going up to a cat.Let\u2019s keep watching for now.\u00a0All the anticipation, concern, and confusion was directed at him. And Seo Jun-ho lowered his palm-sized dagger.To novices, his body looked like the perfect target.\u201cHe\u2019s completely open!\u201d The said novice swung his sword. But right before it could hit his shoulder, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s dagger met the blade.Woosh!Instead of Seo Jun-ho\u2019s shoulder, the sword stabbed the empty air. The Life-Severing Sword\u2019s face darkened.\u2026He dares to block me? I guess the Lance was an easy match for him.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho had a better eye and reaction time than he\u2019d expected. After all, he was being trained under the Association as their rising star.But you can\u2019t make up for the difference in level, you cocky bastard.\u00a0He twisted his wrist, showing the side of the blade. It cut forward in a straight line. If Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t block or dodge it, it would cut his head clean off.\u201c\u2026\u2026I think I\u2019ve indulged you long enough. You\u2019ve crossed the line.\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes narrowed. He\u2019d only planned to play around a bit, but the Sword\u2019s attack was filled with murderous intent.He couldn\u2019t let them go anymore.Drip, drip.There was a sound like water dripping from a faucet. It came from an artery of the Life-Severing Sword.\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201d Blood spurted from his wrist like a fountain, overlapping with the sound of the loud clang of the fallen sword. Seo Jun-ho\u2019s dagger had cut him precisely.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to hold a sword with that hand anymore. You might be able to hold a spoon though.\u201d It was a death sentence for a sword user.The Life-Severing Sword looked down at his trembling hand with a blank look in his eyes as if it wasn\u2019t his. He tried to stop the bleeding with pressure, but his hand wouldn\u2019t stop shaking.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026!\u201d He stood hunched over for a moment before picking up his sword with his left hand. Dripping blood with a look of venom, he looked terrifying.But Seo Jun-ho looked at him with pity, not fear. He muttered with a tired voice.\u201c\u2026\u2026You came for my life first.\u201d His opponent had no right to feel wronged, and there was no need for him to feel guilty. But as he watched the Sword who looked as if he\u2019d lost everything, his mouth was filled with a bitter taste.Clang!Seo Jun-ho swiftly dodged the flying sword and kicked his knees. As the Sword lost his balance, Seo Jun-ho landed a punch in his stomach.\u201cGah!\u201d\u201cYou fucking bastard!\u201dAs the Sword fell, the Life-Severing Magic stepped in.(TN: I\u2019m sorry for the lame names, you won\u2019t hear them after this chapter lol \u00a0 | \u00a0 PR: Lame names for a lame group, makes sense anyway.)Anyone could see that the Life-Severing Sword had attacked first, but men were blind to their causes.Woosh!A lance made of magic formed in the air and flew toward Seo Jun-ho, aimed at his heart.\u201cYou guys started it.\u201d But even in situations like these, he always felt like he was the bad guy.Seo Jun-ho slapped aside the lance with the back of his hand and swung his other. The dagger stabbed perfectly into his opponent\u2019s stomach.\u201cGah! Urk!\u201d Breathing shallow, he instinctively reached to pull it out, but Seo Jun-ho leaned toward his ear.\u201cIf you pull that out, you\u2019ll die. Go to the hospital and you can live,\u201d he said coldly. He stiffened and let go of the handle, swallowing hard. As soon as he said that, the situation started to look bleak.It hasn\u2019t even been a month since he\u2019s become a player\u2026 Why is the gap so big?\u00a0A chill went down the Magic\u2019s spine. If Seo Jun-ho hadn\u2019t been merciful, they would have all been dead.It\u2019s over.\u00a0The fight had lasted a little over three minutes, but the result was the complete opposite of what everyone had expected. The Three Reapers of Gangnam laid on the floor, groaning. But instead of being appalled, the crowd clapped and cheered.\u201cWow, that was amazing!\u201d\u201cHe took out three players that were higher-leveled than him!\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t even have to try. He\u2019s just too good.\u201d\u201cIt seems that a great player has come out of the Association!\u201d\u201cThat was so cool, Seo Jun-ho!\u201dAfter the world had become like a game, this was one of the ways common sense had twisted. Instead of being concerned about the injured, they only cheered the victor.Yeah, I\u2019m the only normal one. It\u2019s only gotten worse after 25 years.There were three ways to survive in this crazy world. Go crazy with the rest, suppress all your emotions, or always be in despair.You couldn\u2019t survive if you didn\u2019t choose one.\u201c\u2026\u2026Phew.\u201d Seo Jun-ho walked up to the Life-Severing Lance, who was the least injured, and crouched down.\u201cWill you come after me for revenge?\u201d He asked casually, as if he were asking if he was hungry.But he understood instinctively what Seo Jun-ho meant. If he said yes, he would kill them all right now.Trembling, he bowed his head. \u201cN-no. We will not. W-we won\u2019t even look at your shadow for the rest of our lives\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cReally? Okay. Have a good life.\u201d Satisfied with the answer, Seo Jun-ho turned around and walked up to the bartender.\u201cIs the teleporter ready?\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cLead the way.\u201d The teleport was over in an instant, just like when he\u2019d come. Seo Jun-ho landed in a dirty alleyway in Insa-dong. He looked up at the narrow sky.\u201c\u2026\u2026I miss my friends.\u201dHis chest stung again today.No matter how much and how long people resented him, he never got used to the feeling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Three players had been bested by Seo Jun-ho in a single breath.\u201cWho are these guys?\u201d\u201cI looked into it, and they weren\u2019t any relevant. But they were all over level 20.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d The video ended, and the girl didn\u2019t seem all that interested.

She\u2019d been impressed by the swift way he dodged attacks.A second later, they pulled up in an alleyway.\u201cPlease finish your ice cream. I think he\u2019s coming soon.\u201d\u201cWhatever.\u201d She bit into her ice cream before she suddenly turned to the window. \u201cHey, hey, isn\u2019t that him?\u201dRight on time, Seo Jun-ho emerged from the alleyway.

He looked weak at first sight because his body was untrained, but the look in his eyes was sharp. It was second to none, not even first-rate players.\u201cI\u2019ll bring him here, then.\u201d She shook her head and opened the car door.\u201cI\u2019ll go myself.

In line?\u201d Shocked, Seo Jun-ho turned around. At some point, dozens of people had lined up behind him.They\u2019re so civilized!\u00a0In fact, the line was getting longer by the second. If things kept going like this, he wouldn\u2019t be able to go home for hours. A loud alarm went off in his head, one he didn\u2019t hear even when he was fighting.\u201cPlayer Seo Jun-ho?\u201d A soft, beautiful voice cut through the loud noises, clear as day. When he turned around, he saw a petite girl who came up to his chest. She was staring up at him. She looked extremely suspicious with her mask and sunglasses, but Seo Jun-ho was looking at something else.\u2026She\u2019s strong?\u00a0His words weren\u2019t empty. She was the strongest player he\u2019d seen after waking up from the ice.\u00a0The female players that were this strong were\u2026He\u2019d already researched and filled his head with information on the famous players, including rankers. Thanks to that, he found his answer right away. Short stature, long and wavy red hair, and a burning heat that he could feel just by standing near her. There was only one person in the world who had those traits.\u2026\u2026Dokkaebi\u2019s Princess.They called her the Red Lotus, a flame-using player from the Dokkaebi Guild. She was actually a Team Leader, but she was more often called \u2018the Princess\u2019 because of her peculiar name.Seo Jun-ho feigned ignorance.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cSorry, but can we talk inside somewhere? I\u2019m not some suspicious person.\u201d She pulled out a business card.[Dokkaebi Guild. Team 2 Leader Gong Juha.](TN: Her nickname is Gongju, which means \u2018princess\u2019.)I knew it.\u00a0He was right.\u00a0Since she\u2019s from Dokkaebi\u2026 They\u2019re probably trying to scout me.He had no thoughts of joining a guild, but being scouted felt good. After all, it was one of the six strongest guilds in the world. One of the famous, influential Big 6.It\u2019s well-known that they make more in a year than a small country\u2019s budget.Seo Jun-ho feigned a surprised look.\u201cWow, what business does the Dokkaebi Guild have with me?\u201d\u201cFufu.\u00a0Let\u2019s go to a cafe and talk over an iced choco.\u201dOf course, he agreed. After all, it was a legal(?) escape from the photo zone.They sat in a private booth in the cafe while Gong Juha\u2019s subordinate stood guard at the door. She finally took off her mask and sunglasses, and fanned her face.\u201cMan, I\u2019m sweating. I hate going out. I hate the heat, but I have to wear a disguise on top of that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Aren\u2019t you a flame-user?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. I like cool, cold things,\u201d she complained.It was hard to believe that Gong Juha was 23 with her baby face.Is this meek-looking girl really Dokkaebi\u2019s Princess from the rumors?Dokkaebi\u2019s Princess, or the Red Lotus Princess, was one of the few things that even the fiends were afraid of. But to Seo Jun-ho, she just looked like a cute* girl around his age.(TN: The word used is similar to \u2018adorable\u2019, usually used to describe animals or babies etc.)\u201cOh, before we start.\u201d Gong Juha suddenly used her magic, creating an intangible field around them. It was a perfectly soundproof wall. Seo Jun-ho blinked as he realized this.Huh? This technique\u2026\u00a0It was familiar.Seeing his unreadable expression, Gong Juha quickly explained.\u201cAh, sorry if I scared you. It\u2019s a maintenance spell based on Skaya-nim\u2019s theories. It\u2019s just a thin wall that blocks out nearby sounds.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s annoying to learn, but it\u2019s useful. You should learn it later on.\u201dI know how to do it\u2026\u2026Sipping on her iced choco, Gong Juha got straight to the point.\u201cWould you like to join our guild?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026All of a sudden?\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked dumbfounded. She invited him like she was asking if he wanted to eat jjajangmyeon for lunch. To Dokkaebi, of all places, the guild that all players dreamed of.(TN: A very famous Korean black bean noodle dish.)\u201cThe Vice-Guildmaster wanted to scout you. Of course, they also told me to make the final decision after meeting you in person\u2026 And you pass.\u201d\u201cIn what sense?\u201d\u201cYour achievements, for one. It\u2019s not so strange that we\u2019d want you after looking at all you\u2019ve achieved so far, seeing that you\u2019re the Super Rookie.\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded in agreement. After all, he\u2019d done all that with this kind of outcome in mind. There was no one around his level who was building a better career than he was.\u201cAnd you score high on my end in combat sense and future potential.\u201d\u201cCombat sense\u2026 Have the videos already started spreading?\u201d He\u2019d seen people at the bar filming his fight with the Three Reapers of Gangnam. Of course, he\u2019d known that it would blow up, just not this fast.\u201cI enjoyed it. You\u2019re good at fighting. Is D-rank Weapon Proficiency really your only skill?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The only skill registered on his official profile was D-rank Weapon Proficiency.\u201cThat only makes me want you more. Think about it: you only have one D-rank skill, but you\u2019re already at this level, with this career. What if you gained more skills?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Obviously, I\u2019d get stronger.\u201d\u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking of, you\u2019ll get even stronger than that.\u201d Her voice was sweet like honey.\u201cIf you join our guild, our skill books will help you. Not only that, our Gate coordinators will draw up a course for you to help you level up as fast as possible.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d He felt sorry for Deok-gu, but there was a reason why the guilds were better off than the Association. Just by going off of what she\u2019d said, joining a guild was much more beneficial.Plus, their yearly salary is higher and their incentives are better.\u00a0It was a total loss for the Association.\u201cAs you know, we are one of the best guilds in the world. And we have a lot more information on the 2nd floor than the Association does. It\u2019ll be greatly beneficial for your growth.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about the penalty fees for breaking your contract with the Association, we can also pay for that.\u201d At this point, most players would\u2019ve instantly left the Association and joined the guild.Well, if they have this many benefits, it\u2019s no wonder that there are no useful guys left at the Association.But Seo Jun-ho had no thoughts of joining a guild, no matter what they offered.I\u2019d become rich and famous. But\u2026\u00a0It wouldn\u2019t come for free. He\u2019d have to give up an equal amount to what he accumulated in glory and riches.Usually, it\u2019s carrying out orders.\u00a0Carrying out tasks assigned by the guild. That was what most players spent their time doing. For Seo Jun-ho, who only focused on his own growth, the guild system was like a ball and chain.I\u2019m happiest with where I\u2019m at now.The Player Association was an international organization, so players were treated like government officials.Most government officials have to adhere to a strict hierarchy\u2026\u2026\u00a0But the chief of the Korean Association had his back. Even if he didn\u2019t insert himself into official business, no one would complain.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Even as she asked, Gong Juha thought it was a stupid question.\u00a0There\u2019s no way he\u2019d decline.\u00a0They were one of the Big 6, Dokkaebi. And she was the ranker, Dokkaebi\u2019s Princess. She\u2019d come down to the 1st floor briefly and came to recruit him in person. It would be much stranger if he refused.But Seo Jun-ho\u2019s answer was unexpected.\u201cI respectfully decline.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah, you can speak casually from\u2026\u2026 Eh?\u201d Gong Juha\u2019s eyes went wide, blinking.She clapped her hands together and started again. \u201cUm\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t think you understood what I said.\u201d\u201cNo, I did. The Dokkaebi Guild has made me an amazing offer.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026So, why?\u201d The look on her face was one of utter confusion. She wasn\u2019t even angry, just truly curious. She wanted to hear why in the world he would refuse.\u201cDo you know the saying \u2018the snake\u2019s head is better than the dragon\u2019s tail\u2019?\u201d(TN: Korean idiom meaning that it\u2019s better to be at the top of something than the bottom of something else, even if the latter is better overall.)\u201cAh, got it.\u201d Gong Juha. She looked at Seo Jun-ho with a new light.\u00a0He\u2019s more ambitious than I thought.The snake\u2019s head is better than the dragon\u2019s tail. She understood.Well, even if he joined Dokkaebi, he likely wouldn\u2019t be able to reach a high position.Seo Jun-ho was outstanding, but there were already players of his level at Dokkaebi. The top players like Shin Sung-hyun and Kim Woojoong had already established themselves at around Seo Jun-ho\u2019s level. He did have them beat when it came to Uncleared Gates though.Besides, they have S-rank skills.\u00a0It was incredible how far he\u2019d come with just a D-rank skill, but no matter how hard he trained, it would cap at around B-rank. No matter how good he was, there would be a gap between the growth potential of an S-rank skill versus a D-rank skill. He\u2019d probably refused the offer because he understood all that.He\u2019s smart.\u00a0For most people, joining one of the Big 6 was the finish line. They fell into the trap of believing that their world would expand if they just joined one. But the competition within the guilds was much fiercer than outside. After all, the Big 6 was where the elite of elites gathered.Having become the Team 2 Leader through her hard-earned efforts, Gong Juha understood him.Hm. He knows where he stands and is backing out peacefully\u2026\u2026 How admirable.It was a bit of a waste. If she took him in and trained him properly, she thought he\u2019d be able to become one of the low-tier rankers. She asked one more time, looking disappointed.\u201cI\u2019m not usually the nagging type, but I\u2019ll ask one more time. You really won\u2019t join us?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Well, nothing we can do about it then.\u201d It\u2019s not like she could force him to join. It would be disgraceful.Gong Juha stood up from her seat to leave.\u201cOh, and I advise\u00a0 you to be careful.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you planning to get revenge on me for refusing?\u201d\u201cNo, no, I may be small but my heart isn\u2019t! What do you take me for?\u201d Her cheeks flared red. She lowered her voice. \u201cThe fiends have suddenly started getting active again, including on the 1st floor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026The 1st floor?\u201d\u201cYes. There\u2019s been a guy called the Skeleton Mage going around different countries and wreaking havoc through terror. He\u2019s a headache to deal with. What, is he Bigfoot or something? Anyways, you should be careful.\u201d\u201cThank you for warning me.\u201d\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll see you again sometime, Mr. Snake head.\u201d Gong Juha quickly left the cafe with her subordinate. Seo Jun-ho watched her go and slowly closed his eyes.So the fiends have been moving.He felt it. It was an instinct that was carved into his DNA. Gong Juha\u2019s warning was some sort of sign.If they come after me\u2026 It\u2019ll be because of the Eastern Sea Gate.\u00a0The sleeping Rare-grade bow wavered in his inventory.He\u2019d already met the requirements to use it.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euI\u2019ll show them something worthy of its name.The bow that brought storms, Tempest Butterfly.(PR: Tempest Butterfly is the bow\u2019s full name in Korean.)He wanted to witness its glory with his own eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Really?\u201d Shim Deok-gu looked at him, aghast.\u201cDokkaebi has no reason to lie to me. It\u2019s probably true.\u201dSeo Jun-ho had hurried back to the Association and immediately gone to Deok-gu to share the information he\u2019d gotten from Gong Juha.\u201cGuh, the Skeleton Mage\u2026 I\u2019ve never heard of him. I knew the Big 6 had a better information network than us, but I didn\u2019t know it was to this extent.\u201d The guilds had information that the Association wouldn\u2019t even catch wind of. Their information network was always two, three steps ahead of them.\u201cAnyways, will you really not regret not joining Dokkaebi? Didn\u2019t Gong Juha come in person? Her team is doing great on the 2nd floor.\u201d\u201cNah. I told you. If I join a guild, I won\u2019t be able to do what I want.\u201d\u201cA player of your caliber would be able to negotiate the contract.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to go?\u201d Shim Deok-gu\u2019s face went dark as he sighed.\u201cI\u2019m just thinking that it would be better for you\u2026 I don\u2019t want to hold you down either.\u201d\u201cI was wondering what you were trying to say.\u201d Seo Jun-ho shrugged. \u201cIf you buy a new knife, you\u2019ll want to take it out. If you take it out, you\u2019ll want to swing it, and if you swing it, you\u2019ll want to cut something. That\u2019s how humans are. If I join a guild, they\u2019ll use me like that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIf I was only after the money and glory, I would\u2019ve left without a word\u2026 But that\u2019s not who I am.\u201dHis only goal was to save his friends. It was much more comfortable for him to stay at the Association than to join a guild.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m glad to hear you say that.\u201d Deok-gu looked touched. He nodded, determined. \u201cOkay! Let\u2019s renew our contract in the morning.\u201d\u201cAll of a sudden?\u201d\u201cYour reputation is more than enough. You even received an offer from one of the Big 6.\u201d He wrote up a new contract on the spot. Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face went sour as he skimmed over it.\u201c\u2026Hey, isn\u2019t this too much? Can you handle it?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re someone who\u2019s wanted by Dokkaebi. This much is a given. Just because we\u2019re frugal doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have money.\u201d\u201cBut 5 million won for clearing a normal Gate is too much\u2026\u201d And for Uncleared Gates, it was 15 million won.(TN: ~440k USD and ~1.3m USD, respectively.)Even with his previous contract, he made a yearly income just by clearing one Gate. Combined with the personal commissions he\u2019d received, he made a\u00a0lot.\u201cI\u2019ll move your room too. Take the whole floor.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m starting to get scared. Why are you treating me so well?\u201d\u201cI wanted to do this from the beginning, but I couldn\u2019t. But now that you\u2019ve received an offer from one of the Big 6, there\u2019s no need for me to be discreet.\u201d Shim Deok-gu looked proud as he swiftly signed the contract. \u201cAnd as for the problem with our information network\u2026 I\u2019ll do my best to close the gap.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d be thankful.\u201d Seo Jun-ho finished signing his name and stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll go to my new room. Which floor should I go to?\u201d\u201c77th. It has a great view.\u201d\u201cI just need to move my stuff. Oh,\u201d Seo Jun-ho stopped at the door and turned around. \u201cSchedule the Eastern Sea Gate conquest for a week from now.\u201d\u201cYou said the fiends are planning something.

The world watches.][Breaking news! Seo Jun-ho refuses a lucrative deal from the Dokkaebi Guild.][Official statement from the Korean Player Association: \u201cPlayer Seo Jun-ho has renewed his contract and has no thoughts on transferring.\u201d]The news of Seo Jun-ho\u2019s plans to conquer the Eastern Sea Gate was causing a stir. It was something that everyone wanted, but it had never been achieved. Seo Jun-ho made the announcement himself. He was a monster who had debuted just over a month ago, and he\u2019d already received an offer from one of the Big 6. The whole world was watching.\u201cFinally.\u201d At the summit of a mountain in the northeastern region of the 2nd floor, a man sat reading the articles.\u201cYou\u2019ve come.\u201d A voice spoke through the empty air.\u201cYou called for me, Signer-nim.\u201dAnyone who heard his name would have been alarmed. Kal Signer was an executive of the Fiend Association and was an internationally wanted terrorist.\u201cIt\u2019s that guy.\u201d\u201cI also saw the reports. Is he the human who you suspected has the Tempest Butterfly?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 It\u2019s a bow that I want very much.\u201d A greed rose in Signer\u2019s eyes, then quickly subsided. His subordinate spoke carefully.\u201cBut the official statement said that the Tempest was in Tushar Vishi\u2019s inventory.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201d Signer wrinkled his nose. \u201cObviously, he hid it. He published Tushar Vishi\u2019s journal that said he was killed by a fiend. Of course he\u2019d be wary of us.\u201d\u201cThen, do you think that he has the Tempest Butterfly?\u201d\u201cI have my suspicions, but I don\u2019t have proof.\u201d\u201cShall I go down to the 1st floor?\u201d\u201cNo. The Association\u2019s surrounded him with other players. There\u2019s no point if we tip them off.\u201d Kal Signer rubbed his chin, thinking. \u201cIs there anyone left on the 1st floor that we can use?\u201d\u201cOf course. There are always those that hunger for power. As for those we can use\u2026 How about the Shadow Brothers? They\u2019re assigned to the Last Vegas auction.\u201d\u201cThe Shadow Brothers\u2026 Will the two of them be enough?\u201d The subordinate considered this for a second, then nodded.\u201cTheir skills are more than enough.\u201d\u201cThen send them to the Eastern Sea Gate. We don\u2019t need to explain the assignment, do we?\u201d\u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI should start getting ready to go.\u201d\u201c\u2026Already?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a persistent one.\u201d As soon as Kal Signer stood up, he scowled. The traps he\u2019d set out a few kilometers out had sensed his enemy.\u201c\u2026Fucking bastard.\u201d He grit his teeth. He was an archer and fought best with a sizable distance between him and his opponent. But even if he had the range, he didn\u2019t have the guts to fight his pursuer.I can\u2019t fight one of the Nine Heavens in my current state.They were the nine strongest players and fiends in the world. The one chasing him right now was the Sword Saint, Kim Woojoong. He\u2019d picked up Kal Signer\u2019s trail a few months ago and had been persistently chasing him since.\u201cSeo Jun-ho, was it? He\u2019s a lucky man.\u201d If only he wasn\u2019t being chased, he would have gone down to the 1st floor himself. The Association had eyes everywhere, and with the monster called Kim Woojoong on his tail, going down to the 1st floor would be suicide.\u201cI shall watch until your luck runs out.\u201dKal Signer licked his dry lips. He looked down at the thick fog of the mountain, then turned around and disappeared.\u201cHow lucky!\u201d Cha Si-eun exclaimed. \u201cHave you seen this article? The Shadow Brothers are joining the Eastern Sea Gate raid! It\u2019ll be a lot easier!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about that\u2026\u201d Cha Si-eun tilted her head.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good or bad thing that they\u2019ve decided to join.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a plus? Of course, they\u2019re not as good as Jun-ho-nim, but they have great skills and a great career.\u201d Seo Jun-ho shrugged.\u201cReally? Please get some information on them for me. I want to judge them myself.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dAs she left to prepare the documents, Seo Jun-ho headed to his fitness training room. It was his own personal room, a benefit from the contract.\u201cHuff, huff\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho started to run laps around the big room. Every time he finished a lap, he went faster.Training like this will prevent mistakes in an actual fight.\u00a0It was like training the gear shift of a car. His muscles would already be used to the progression. The wheels would go faster, and so would he. Like that, he finished a hundred laps.\u201cHah! Hah!\u201d His heart pounded, feeling like it was about to explode. His breath was hot and he felt like he couldn\u2019t move a finger, but this was just his warm-up.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Evening out his breath, he started to pull out his magic.When you use magic, you need to focus.\u00a0If your concentration broke, so did the flow of magic. That\u2019s why Seo Jun-ho liked to train in magic after he exhausted his energy. If he could use it properly in this state, it would get rid of a huge weak point.It\u2019s an unsophisticated method that Skaya came up with\u2026 But it\u2019s effective.Woosh!Watchguard of Darkness bloomed from the void like a flower. It didn\u2019t have a conscience, but the darkness flowed around him as if in greeting.\u201c\u2026Long time no see.\u201d In the past, he\u2019d used it everyday and everywhere. It was that reliable, and it had never let him down before.I\u2019ll have to use this guy again in the Gate.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho pet the wavering shadows and tapped on his Vita, pulling up information on the Eastern Sea Gate.\u27eaForgotten Dragon\u2019s Island\u27ebEntry Requirements: Level 13-25Party Cap: 20 peopleClear Condition: Rout the Nameless DragonDifficulty: Very HardDragon\u2026\u00a0Seo Jun-ho gulped. After the Gates appeared, dragons were no longer just a fiction. The players had come face-to-face with Eastern and Western dragons as powerful, top-class monsters.(TN: There are two different words for Eastern/Asian dragons and Western/European dragons. The Nameless Dragon is the Asian kind.)I\u2019ve fought both kinds before.\u00a0They were tricky opponents. Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t have any flying abilities either, so they were an especially bad match.There are two ways I can defeat a dragon.\u00a0He could either grab onto its scales and try to fight it in the air, or drag it down to the ground.\u201cPersonally, I think the second one is better\u2026 But it probably won\u2019t work out that way.\u201dDragons were intelligent monsters. If they thought that their opponent was too strong for them, they wouldn\u2019t come down from the sky. That also meant they wouldn\u2019t present a chance for their opponent to grab onto their scales.Ring!\u00a0Cha Si-eun\u2019s files arrived. Their skills and profiles were described in detail.\u201cHuh?\u201d Seo Jun-ho blinked.\u00a0This\u2026 I\u2019ll be able to use it.As soon as he saw their skills, two strategies popped up in his head.The first was a scenario in which they feigned innocence and pretended to help him with the conquest. \u201cIn that case, we can work together to defeat it.\u201dThe problem lay in the possibility that they\u2019d come after him on purpose. \u201cIf that happens, it\u2019ll be annoying to deal with.\u201dWith the amount of magic he currently had, it would be hard to deal with two fiends and a dragon at the same time.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut Seo Jun-ho had a solution for that.\u201cInventory.\u201dClatter!The artifacts he\u2019d bought from the Black Market tumbled to the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How come it shakes so much during the boss fight?\u201d\u201c\u2026You were talking about the game?\u201d\u201cHuh? Were you talking about that?\u201d Seo Jun-ho jutted his chin toward the beach. He waved his hands and looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cI defeated the Frost Queen. Do you think I\u2019d be scared of a dragon whose name I don\u2019t even know?\u201d Most boss monsters had a distinct name or sobriquet. For example, the Perrin that had only appeared once in Northern Europe. Or the Kraken from Norway that appeared from the ocean. Even the Cinder Fox he\u2019d fought not too long ago had a name.\u201cWell, it\u00a0is\u00a0called the Nameless Dragon\u2026 If it doesn\u2019t have a name, it\u2019s probably not all that great.\u201d\u201cIf it was, it would have a name.\u201d Seo Jun-ho spoke casually, but Shim Deok-gu was uncharacteristically nervous.\u201cDon\u2019t be careless. Don\u2019t forget that almost 9,000 people have died trying to defeat it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not like that. And by the way, a dragon is still a dragon.\u201d They were one of the strongest monsters out there.\u201cDragons aren\u2019t easy opponents for those who are unprepared.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cSo don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201dShim Deok-gu grumbled. \u201cThe most useless things to worry about are celebrities, rich people, and you.\u201d\u201cIf you know that, why do you look so nervous?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026 It\u2019s not just monsters you\u2019ll be going up against.\u201d There were only three people going into the Gate today: Seo Jun-ho and the Shadow Brothers. \u201cSeeing as how no one else is going in, it\u2019s very likely that they\u2019re fiends.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re barely at level 25. I took down three players who were over level 20 not long ago.\u201d\u201cHey, do you think the Shadow Brothers are that weak?\u201d\u201cWell, considering their career, I\u2019d say they\u2019re a little better. Just a bit.\u201d\u201cJust be careful\u2026\u201d The Shadow Brothers were revered as heroes back in America, which meant they\u2019d had a good, clean career thus far.They haven\u2019t failed a single one of their 200 plus commissions.However, their main business wasn\u2019t clearing Gates. Their specialty was acting as guards, so they were highly sought after.\u201cBoth brothers awoke shadow abilities. What luck.\u201d Even if they were blood-related, it was unlikely for two people to awaken their abilities at the same time; even more unlikely for both to obtain skills with certain attributes. Even if that happened by some chance, the possibility of them awakening abilities with the\u00a0same\u00a0attribute was close to 0%.\u201cIt\u2019s like winning the Powerball, buying two more tickets, and then winning again.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why the Americans love them. They\u2019re brothers with a heroic destiny,\u201d Shim Deok-gu said at once. \u201cAmericans love a good hero story.\u201d\u201cYeah. All the Marvel and DC comics I read are from there.\u201dBut if they truly were pawns for the fiends, why did they choose that path? People were expecting them to be heroes.\u2026Well, I\u2019ll find out soon enough.Seo Jun-ho drank a soda as he looked out the window. \u201cHuh? They\u2019re here?\u201d\u201cSeems like it. Let\u2019s get off too.\u201d The car carrying the Shadow Brothers had parked in the lot. As Deok-gu and Seo Jun-ho made their way over, the car door opened and two tall men stepped out. They smiled brightly as they saw him.\u201cHey! I\u2019m a big fan of yours, Sir Jun-ho!\u201d\u201cThanks, but I am not a sir. My name is Jun-ho Seo.\u201d(TN: These lines are originally in English but I fixed up the grammar.)As the perfect English spilled from his lips, the surrounding reporters, as well as the Brothers, looked surprised.\u201cDamn, you\u2019re good at English.\u201d\u201cYour pronunciation\u2019s good. Did you study abroad?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m just familiar with it. I have a friend from England, you see.\u201d An eccentric young lady who spent all her time locked in her room to study magic.The Shadow Brothers fist-bumped him and laughed heartily.\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s a relief! Vita\u2019s interpretation feature has a slight delay, so we were worried that it might be inconvenient when we go inside\u2026 But it seems like that won\u2019t be a problem!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were so good at English either. You should introduce us to your friend if we ever get the chance.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 We\u2019ll see.\u201d As they introduced each other warmly, the atmosphere around them also lightened. Only Shim Deok-gu didn\u2019t seem to notice.Just by looking at them, I\u2019m already starting to doubt myself\u2026\u00a0Was that really a mask? If so, he was worried about how things would unfold within the Gate.One of the brothers noticed Deok-gu staring and turned to him.\u201cHm? Is there something on my face?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable. I was just amazed by the sight of America\u2019s hottest heroes.\u201d(PR: Smooth, Deok-gu. Smooth.)\u201cOh, well, no need to be sorry about that\u2026\u201d They finished exchanging greetings and started the interview. They didn\u2019t ask any questions about their favorite K-pop stars or their thoughts on kimchi.\u201cWhy did you come here to participate in the raid today?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Well. I\u2019d say the biggest reason is the man called Seo Jun-ho.\u201d\u201cPlayer Seo Jun-ho?\u201d\u201cCorrect. When we read that he defeated two Uncleared Gates and the Cinder Fox\u2026 we felt our blood boiling.\u201d(TN: In Korean, this doesn\u2019t always insinuate anger. Usually it\u2019s just used to denote strong feelings/passion.)\u201cYou felt competitive?\u201d\u201cHaha, let\u2019s just call it respect.\u201d The interview went on for another hour and ended pleasantly. The Shadow Brothers and Seo Jun-ho then gathered at the shore during their short break.\u201cThis is Korea\u2019s last Uncleared Gate, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll give it our all so that Korea can become a special safe zone.\u201dHearing their encouragement, Seo Jun-ho laughed lightly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve prepared as much as I can.\u201dWhen do you think players are most nervous when challenging a Gate? Some might say it\u2019s when they\u2019re facing the boss, others might say it\u2019s when their teammates get injured. But most players are most nervous when they enter the Gate.They don\u2019t know what environment, monsters, or traps await them. That\u2019s when they are most on edge.That\u2019s why we thought it would be easy\u2026The Shadow Brothers had been planning to ambush Seo Jun-ho as soon as they entered the Gate. But as they stared at his defenseless back, their hands wouldn\u2019t move.Is it\u2026 truly an opening?Seo Jun-ho looked careless, but there was an irrationally strong feeling that he would perfectly block their attacks. The two exchanged looks and widened their steps to flank Seo Jun-ho.\u201cPretty breezy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cI never knew the inside of a Gate could look like this\u2026\u201dCurrently, they were on a lonely-looking island. Besides the small forest area in the east, they were surrounded by shorelines.Shwaaaa!\u00a0The rough, fierce waves hit the beach without rest.\u201cI don\u2019t see a single monster. Where\u2019s the Nameless Dragon?\u201d\u201cA dragon\u2026 I\u2019ve always wanted to fight one.\u201d With their arms crossed, the Shadow Brothers looked confident.\u2026Something\u2019s weird.\u00a0The Nameless Dragon didn\u2019t even have a proper sobriquet. But Seo Jun-ho got a too-familiar feeling.\u00a0This is the same feeling I get when I enter a 1-star Gate.Of course, the Shadow Brothers wouldn\u2019t know. They chattered away as they watched Seo Jun-ho for an opening.Wooooooosh!At that moment, a great shadow covered the island.\u201cHuh? What\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it a cloud?\u201d As they squinted up to the sky, the Shadow Brothers\u2019 necks craned.\u201cWhat\u2026 is that?\u201d Above the white clouds, something black and enormous flickered.\u201cIs it the Nameless Dragon?\u201d\u201cWell, we\u2019ve confirmed its location now. But how are we supposed to hunt something that flies above the clouds?\u201d They turned to Seo Jun-ho. He\u2019d been standing between the two of them just a moment ago, but he had disappeared.\u201cWh-when did he\u2014?\u201d\u201cNo way! I didn\u2019t even feel his presence\u2026!\u201d A great cry resonated above the two confused brothers.\u2013 \u201cGuoooohhh!\u201dIt was 15 meters long and covered in black, tumor-like scales. The Nameless Dragon\u2019s fierce, red eyes glared as it finally descended.[The Forgotten Dragon has appeared.]Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu* * *At the same moment, the darkness in the eastern forest wavered. Seo Jun-ho stepped out and looked down at the panicked Shadow Brothers with cold eyes.\u201cNow, show me. Whether you\u2019re working with the fiends\u2026 or not.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There\u2019s no such thing as heroes in this generation.\u201d The Shadow Brothers chatted quietly, coming together and staring up at the dragon ahead of them.Shiver.\u00a0They got chills just by getting close.\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t know dragons were this strong.\u201d\u201cSame here. But we can defeat it if we work together.\u201d\u201cAnd what about Seo Jun-ho? The Gate will be cleared if we kill it, and we\u2019ll fail our mission.\u201d The older brother, Edvar, thought to himself for a second before coming to a decision.\u201cI\u2019ll deal with the dragon while you go after him, then. He\u2019s probably watching us from the forest over there.\u201d\u201cWill you be alright on your own?\u201d\u201cWho do you think I am?\u201d As he sneered, the shadows cast on the ground slowly started to rise.One, two, three\u2026 Fifteen shadows formed into humanoid shapes, holding spears and swords made from the same shadows. They were formidable soldiers.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me and just kill him. Meet up when you\u2019re done.\u201d\u201cOk, hyung*. Be careful.\u201d As the younger brother broke away, the Nameless Dragon\u2019s eyes briefly followed.(TN: Older/big brother.)\u201cOver here, you worm!\u201d Its attention shifted as Edvar landed an attack on its scales.\u201cThat rat bastard. Where the hell did he go?\u201d Vincent was the younger brother simply because he had been born a little bit later. He looked around, eyes wide.God dammit. When\u2019s the last time we messed up like this?\u00a0There was a simple reason as to why their personal commission success rate was 100%. They planned their missions meticulously and had the ability to execute them perfectly. Those two things had the perfect synergy, which was why they\u2019d never failed before.How dare he ruin our plans? I won\u2019t kill him gracefully.\u00a0His pride as a professional was hurt, and Vincent ground his teeth. He\u2019d never wanted to come here in the first place.\u00a0It\u2019s hard enough preparing for the Las Vegas auction\u2026 I can\u2019t believe I have to deal with something like this.This year\u2019s auction would feature a high-class magic core from an ancient dungeon in the 2nd floor: Heaven\u2019s Breath. There was no way the Fiend Association would miss out on such an opportunity. If the core fell into their hands, it would serve as another foothold for them.If Seo Jun-ho messes up our plans for the auction\u2026\u00a0A shiver went down Vincent\u2019s spine. Even if he and his brother lived, death might be more merciful.Vincent remembered his current predicament, and bloodlust started to trickle into his eyes. His bloodshot eyes soon turned red as he started to look around the forest.\u00a0I\u2019ll kill him quickly and complete our assignment.Woosh!\u00a0His body suddenly disappeared into the ground, only to reappear dozens of meters ahead. \u2018Shadow Movement\u2019 allows the brothers to travel through shade and shadow. Of course, it had a limit: they could only travel 30 meters in one stride.\u201c\u2026I can feel him.\u201d Vincent arrived deep in the forest, looking up at the dense cover of leaves. He muttered to himself, sensing a subtle magic wavelength behind the tree. He\u2019d picked up on Seo Jun-ho\u2019s magic aura when he\u2019d fist-bumped him outside the Gate, and it was the same as this one. Vincent sneered and quietly started to gather his magic. He moved inconspicuously so his opponent wouldn\u2019t be able to notice.In an instant, the shadows gathered in his hands to form a sharp dagger. He hid it behind his back and shouted, sounding panicked.\u201cHey, are you there? Hyung\u2019s fighting the dragon right now! We need your help!\u201d He\u2019d already figured out his location and stepped close. He gripped his dagger, intending to kill Seo Jun-ho in one hit.\u201cWhat did we do to deserve this? We decided that we\u2019d work together, so\u2026\u201dVincent built a pitiful expression, looking like he was about to cry. Anyone that saw him would feel bad. But as he took one, two, three steps\u2026 He reached his destination and his face turned dark like a demon\u2019s.\u201c\u2026Stop fucking around and die already!\u201dWoooosh!\u00a0Vincent didn\u2019t swing his dagger. There was no need for it. This deep in the forest, the thick cover of leaves and branches created numerous shadows.This is my home ground. He must be crazy.\u00a0The dagger in Vincent\u2019s hand disappeared, reappearing a second later where he felt Seo Jun-ho\u2019s magic.Stab!\u00a0He felt it. He hadn\u2019t wielded the dagger himself, but he felt the weight in his hand and the thick sound. Vincent laughed in delight and strode over.\u201cWhy are you causing trouble when you\u2019re this weak\u2026\u201d Vincent\u2019s face crumbled as he stepped behind the tree to check on the corpse.\u2026It\u2019s not a body?\u00a0The dagger had hit a doll formed out of condensed darkness.A trap!\u00a0As he realized this, Vincent expanded his senses with his magic. He was confident that he\u2019d be able to find Seo Jun-ho even with his eyes closed.But\u2026 he couldn\u2019t sense anything.What? There\u2019s no way\u2026\u00a0As he tried to process his confusion, a voice came from behind him.\u201cSo you really were fiends. What a shame.\u201d He whipped around to find Seo Jun-ho leaning against a tree with his arms crossed. He realized what Seo Jun-ho had said.\u201c\u2026What do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cHm? I said it in English, so you should understand.\u201d Seo Jun-ho tilted his head. \u201cYou\u2019re a fiend. Why are you denying it? Fuck that.\u201d Vincent trembled.How did he\u2026?\u00a0The only people who knew about this mission were the two brothers and the person who\u2019d sent them\u2014a servant of Kal Signer. Those were the only four people who would know, and there was no way any one of them would let the information leak.\u00a0Then that means\u2026He was bluffing. He shrugged. \u201cWhat do you mean I\u2019m a fiend?\u201d\u201cAha,\u00a0so you\u2019re playing dumb? You just tried to kill me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you betrayed us first.\u201d Seo Jun-ho smirked. He found it cute that Vincent was trying to make excuses. It was like watching a child hide under a blanket in hide-and-seek, thinking it was a good hiding spot.\u201cIf you get rid of those red eyes first, I\u2019ll consider it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow am I supposed to believe you when you have a fiend\u2019s scarlet eyes?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMomentarily confused, Vincent bit his bottom lip.I\u2026 can\u2019t control it?\u00a0When fiends used Demonic energy, their eyes turned red. It was a special trait of theirs. Because of it, they trained themselves to control it while they lived among people.Vincent thought he was good at controlling it. After all, he and his brother had never been suspected during their two years of activity.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to control, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Seo Jun-ho was right. Vincent looked at him with a furious expression.\u201cShut up. You don\u2019t seem to understand the situation you\u2019re in\u2026 Did you think I\u2019d just stand by if you figured out that I was a fiend?\u201d He said coldly.\u201cNope. You\u2019d try to kill me to hide the evidence. That\u2019s how you guys operate.\u201d The way he spoke was infuriating.\u201cSo you do know.\u201d Vincent gave up on hiding his identity and let his scarlet eyes glisten with bloodlust. Most players would have noticed where this was going and braced themselves, but Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t look the least bit fazed.\u201cAww,\u00a0are you mad, pal?\u201d\u201cPal? I humored you for a bit\u2026 and now you\u2019ve forgotten your place!\u201dDemon clans appeared very rarely in Gates, but the players who drank their blood and survived became those savages known as fiends. Vincent brought out his Demonic energy.Seo Jun-ho stroked his chin and looked upon the Demonic energy. He hadn\u2019t seen it in a long time.Yup, Demonic energy is a lot more violent and unrefined than normal magic.\u00a0Just seeing it could also cause the opponent to shrivel.Vincent took Seo Jun-ho\u2019s silence as fear.\u201cTremble all you want.\u201d He gripped his fists. It had been a while since he\u2019d used all his Demonic energy.Ah\u2026 This is the best feeling.\u00a0He felt light and fuzzy, as if he was on drugs. Power flowed out of his body like he was a god. He felt like he could crush the likes of Seo Jun-ho any time he wanted.\u201cI won\u2019t kill you quickly. You\u2019ve pissed me off too much.\u201d Vincent had no thoughts of giving him an easy death. He\u2019d taunt and torture Seo Jun-ho until he begged to die.\u201cLet\u2019s get rid of those useless legs first.\u201d Vincent summoned three daggers from the shadows and muttered to himself. Seo Jun-ho wouldn\u2019t need those legs while he tortured him.Finally, Seo Jun-ho uncrossed his arms.\u201cWell, since you\u2019re showing me something interesting, I\u2019ll return the favor.\u201d\u201cNo need!\u201dWoosh!\u00a0The floating daggers disappeared, then reappeared behind Seo Jun-ho to cut off his legs\u2026\u201cWhat?\u201d Vincent started, shocked. In the blink of an eye, Seo Jun-ho had vanished.Did I aim wrong? No, there\u2019s no way\u2026A voice spoke from behind him.\u201cAt first, all I could hide was my general presence.\u201d Vincent whipped around, only to find Seo Jun-ho rippling in the darkness at his feet. His ankle, calves, and thighs emerged, as if growing from the darkness.\u201cAs I got used to it, I could hide my sounds and scent.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 what\u2019s with this energy?\u201d Vincent\u2019s whole body started to tremble. The energy surrounding Seo Jun-ho was definitely not Demonic.What is he saying? And what\u2019s with this intense pressure?\u00a0It was far more fierce and atrocious than anything he\u2019d ever encountered. A simple touch gave him a violent sense that he would be consumed.\u201cI erase one part at a time. Presence, sound, scent\u2026 What would come next?\u201d As he spoke, the rippling darkness beneath him covered every hair on his head.\u2026\u2026A peaceful silence covered the forest.Seo Jun-ho\u2019s scent, presence, sounds, magic aura\u2026 Every part of him had disappeared.This was Specter\u2019s unique skill that could deceive legions of monsters.Night Walking.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHa\u2026 haha?\u201d Vincent was left alone in the forest. He let out a dejected laugh. He was fighting an opponent who could hide himself perfectly.I fucked up.\u00a0This wasn\u2019t his home ground. It was the stage Seo Jun-ho had chosen so he could go wild.\u00a0I\u2019d be crazy to fight him here.One word filled his mind.Run.He started to sprint, not looking back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The thought of an invisible enemy chasing him made his hairs stand on end.\u201cThat bastard. He\u2019s good at running away.\u201d Seo Jun-ho stepped quietly. He didn\u2019t plan to attack him.I\u2019ve confirmed that they\u2019re fiends, so it\u2019s a bit of a waste to kill them right now.\u00a0It would be better for Seo Jun-ho if he used them to kill the Nameless Dragon first.\u00a0They\u2019ll be the hunting dogs.\u00a0Of course, he\u2019d put them down once they served their purpose. That\u2019s why he hadn\u2019t shown Vincent his true strength and just scared him a bit.\u201cIt\u2019ll be troublesome if he\u2019s already scared.\u201d As he watched the hunting dogs come together, he also started to prepare for the hunt.* * *\u201cWow, he must\u2019ve been feisty.\u201d The Nameless Dragon had flown up to the clouds after fighting for a bit. Edvar looked to his brother. He wasn\u2019t saying anything. For some reason, he was covered from head to toe in dirt and weeds, and his face had turned white. \u201cYou took care of him, right?\u201d\u201cN-no\u2026 I couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Hearing his brother\u2019s half-hearted answer, Edvar yelled.\u201cWhat? What do you mean?!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something weird about him! He knew that we were fiends and hid his true strength! I used all my Demonic energy but couldn\u2019t even sense him, let alone find him!\u201dVincent had suspected that Seo Jun-ho was hiding his true strength. But as he hadn\u2019t experienced it himself, he was cold.\u201cHow are you alive, then?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cIf he was truly hiding his strength, why did he let you go?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dVincent wracked his brain. His brother was right. If Seo Jun-ho had the strength to kill him, he would have done so while he was separated from his brother. But he had let Vincent go and hadn\u2019t attacked him once.I only got dirty because I fell while running\u2026\u00a0Vincent\u2019s face twisted as he realized. \u201cSo I fell for his bluffs?\u201d\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have let you go so easily. Of course he\u2019d try to take us out one by one.\u201d He gritted his teeth and turned back to the forest. \u201cThat sly bastard! How dare he trick me.

I can\u2019t defeat the Nameless Dragon alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s that strong?\u201d\u201cNot just that, it\u2019s annoying to deal with. It\u2019s hard to land attacks because it\u2019s flying.\u201d\u201cThen we should try to ride it.\u201d\u201cYeah. But it\u2019s been focused on me, so I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026So you want me to help?\u201d Vincent understood immediately.\u201cAttacks from the ground don\u2019t work. We have to go for its reverse scale.\u201dAll dragons* had a reverse scale as a weak point. Their enormous bodies had a single scale that faced the opposite of the rest.(TN: Both European and Asian dragons.)\u201cThen what about Seo Jun-ho?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll corner him with a pincer attack after we kill the Nameless Dragon.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright. Then, you get the dragon\u2019s attention when it comes down. I\u2019ll use Shadow Movement to get on its back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m counting on you.\u201d As they finalized their plan, the Nameless Dragon pierced through the clouds and appeared in their field of vision. Its mouth was opened wide, revealing a concentrated black energy. When Edvar saw this, his face fell.\u201cGoddammit! It was gathering its breath above the clouds!\u201d\u2013 \u201cGuooohhhh!\u201dThe beam in its maw shot at Edvar.\u201cGah!\u201d He barely managed to dodge with Shadow Movement, but his remaining Shadow Soldiers were all destroyed. Edvar coughed up blood.\u201cHyung!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me\u2026 Focus!\u201dThe long shadows on the ground formed into a spear. Edvar gripped it in his hand and got into a javelin-throwing position.The eye! I have to hit the eye.The Nameless Dragon was protecting its reverse scale with its entire body. Even if he could attack it, he wouldn\u2019t be able to land a scratch on its natural defense.Wooshhh!\u00a0As Edvar summoned all his Demonic energy, his eyes turned redder. He\u2019d land this attack no matter what it took and make the Nameless Dragon come lower so that Vincent could ride on top of it.\u201cHup!\u201d He accelerated forward on his feet. As he reached the peak of his speed, the spear left his hand.The spear flew straight like a comet, only to pivot off its path, hitting the Nameless Dragon in the face.Clang!\u201cAh!\u201d Edvar cursed. He\u2019d missed by an inch. But since the scales on its face were less resilient, the spear had broken skin.\u2013 \u201cGuoooohhhhh!\u201dThe Nameless Dragon lashed in pain. It wriggled like an eel on a cutting board, descending lower and lower. It fell from 500 meters in the air to 200.Just a bit more\u2026\u00a0Edvar hoped, but the Nameless Dragon quickly returned to its senses. After receiving a life-threatening attack, it started to go up again.\u201cDammit, Vincent! Now!\u201dEdvar knew instinctively. If it went back up into the sky, it wouldn\u2019t come down again. Vincent realized this as well.\u201cHelp me!\u201d He shouted. Edvar lightly stepped with his right foot.Boom!\u00a0He picked up pieces of shadow and threw them toward the dragon and Vincent. They had a limit of 30 meters, the same as Shadow Movement.Woosh! Wooosh!Vincent used his brother\u2019s shadows to make his way to the Nameless Dragon.(TN: So he throws one shard 30 meters out, and uses one shadow to transport the rest 30 meters more.)\u2013 \u201cGuooohhhhh!\u201dAs it sensed its enemy approaching, the Nameless Dragon tried to climb higher in the sky, but Vincent was one step ahead.\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201d He grabbed onto the scales on the Nameless Dragon\u2019s tail. He then yelled down to his brother. \u201cI did it!\u201d\u201cThe reverse scale\u2026 It\u2019s near the back\u2026!\u201d Edvar\u2019s voice grew fainter by the second.\u201cKuh!\u201d Vincent held onto the scales with his two hands and gripped his knees around its tail. With the way the dragon\u2019s body squirmed and moved, he felt like he would fall at any moment.Dammit, I\u2019d rather ride a rollercoaster without a seatbelt.Realizing that a human was clinging onto its tail, the Nameless Dragon glanced at its back and started to move its body even faster.\u201cHuff, huff\u2026\u201d\u00a0As Vincent covered his mouth and clung onto its tail, he glanced down.\u00a0Urp!He never experienced motion sickness on planes or boats, but he suddenly felt nauseous. The island he\u2019d been standing on had become as small as an ant. All he was surrounded by was a sea of clouds.\u2026I\u2019m confident that I\u2019ll live, but it\u2019s still scary.\u00a0He gulped and barely kept himself together as he slowly started to move. As he crawled on top of its body, he arrived at its back.\u201cFound it!\u201d His eyes sparkled as he found his target. There was a white scale that stood out among the black ones, facing the other direction.The reverse scale.\u00a0The weak point of dragons. Vincent ripped it off without hesitation.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dCrackle.The Nameless Dragon felt a spark of electricity course through its body.\u201cI did it! I ripped off the reverse scale, so\u2026\u201d He looked up, eyes bright.Woosh!A long, black spear tore through his shoulder.\u201cGuh\u2026?\u201dEven a seasoned player would\u2019ve lost their head. But Vincent was a fiend who had some immunity to pain. He quickly gripped the spear and checked the bleeding.Who? Is it Seo Jun-ho\u2026?\u00a0He quickly shook his head. It was impossible. Even if he\u2019d hidden his true strength, they were 5,000 meters up in the air. No attack from the ground would be able to hit him.\u00a0If it\u2019s not Seo Jun-ho, then\u2026Vincent looked at the Nameless Dragon, trembling.\u2013\u00a0\u201cGuoooohhhh!\u201dEyes shining red, dozens of black spears had formed near its head.I\u2019m fucked.\u00a0Vincent turned white and jumped off its back without a second thought.Wooooshh!He heard the sound of the spears behind him. Vincent summoned the last of his Demonic energy.Shadow Return!The world around him spun, and he rolled onto the ground.\u201cCough! Cough!\u201d\u00a0He vomited blood, and Edvar ran over.\u201cDid you do\u2026? Wait, what\u2019s with that injury?\u201d Edvar dropped to the ground next to him, and Vincent gripped his arm.\u201cHyung, we\u2026\u00a0Urk,\u00a0we\u2019re fucked!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou have to run\u2014\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, the Nameless Dragon ripped through the clouds.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKuroouhhhhhhhh!\u201dThe black spears shot toward them.Seo Jun-ho watched the Nameless Dragon rage at the Shadow Brothers from a distance.\u201cYou can use textbooks to study for college exams, but not for hunting\u2026 I always say this, but it\u2019s a famous saying.\u201d He\u2019d expected this to happen. \u201cOf course it would react like that if you went for its reverse scale.\u201d\u2018If you attack the reverse scale, it\u2019s easy to defeat a dragon.\u2019 That\u2019s what rookies who\u2019d never fought a dragon thought.Of course, the reverse scale was the weak spot. But just because you found it didn\u2019t mean you could easily kill the dragon.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euIf you bother the area where the reverse scale is, the dragon senses danger and becomes much more vicious.But that wasn\u2019t a well-known fact. Players that couldn\u2019t take on its rage would be better off not touching the reverse scale at all.To be honest, I don\u2019t think I could take on a rampaging dragon in my current state.But it was a different story if he had \u2018bait\u2019 that would receive the brunt of its wrath.\u201cDon\u2019t die. Keep running until I kill the guy,\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered as he pulled back the Tempest\u2019s bowstring.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I need to concentrate!\u201dIt was strong enough to test their brotherly bond. Edvar and Vincent were covered in sweat as they dodged each black spear that came every second.Dammit\u2026 Do dragons have unlimited magic?This is too much.Every time they dodged an attack, they would instinctively look up at the sky. But the number of floating spears wasn\u2019t decreasing at all.Woooooshhh!Every time a spear was thrown, a new one formed in its place. An enormous wall was forming before them.When will this fucking attack end?Will it\u00a0ever\u00a0end?A person can properly run to the end when they see a finish line, but the Shadow Brothers ran in circles with no end in sight. All they could do was waste their stamina.If our attacks could reach it, we could at least fight it out properly\u2026Those fucking scales. We can\u2019t even make a dent because they\u2019re so hard.They\u2019d run into a dead end. And just as they started preparing themselves for death, all the color drained from their faces.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dA fearsome storm had started to fly in. It made their hairs stand on end.Behind it! You\u2019re telling me there\u2019s a new attack pattern?Shit, is this where we die\u2026Just as they started to accept their fate, an arrow carried by the fierce winds pierced through the Nameless Dragon\u2019s eye.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!It opened its jaws wide, its painful shriek shaking the air around it.Wooshhh!The dragon\u2019s blood spurted like a fountain, raining on the brothers and the earth. They looked at each other, jaws slack.Was that\u2026Seo Jun-ho?They quickly realized at the same time that he was supporting them. They also realized the reason behind it.Well, it\u2019ll just be harder for him if we die.It\u2019s impossible for him to kill it alone.Regardless of what happened after, the three of them had to work together to fight the Nameless Dragon. They\u2019d become enemies again after the battle was over, but they would have to cooperate if they wanted to live. A new hope burned in their eyes. They\u2019d given up before, but now, they had something to cling onto.\u201cLet\u2019s fall back when the opportunity arises.\u201d\u201cOf course. Since he\u2019s attacking from that direction, it\u2019s obvious where the Nameless Dragon will turn to.\u201dThey finished their calculations and started to dodge the black spears that were falling again.* * *\u201cI feel sorry for them\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered dryly, lowering his bow. After he\u2019d shot the arrow, the Shadow Brothers had become lively again. He\u2019d given them hope. And it wasn\u2019t hard to guess what exactly they were hoping for.\u201cThey\u2019re probably waiting for the Nameless Dragon\u2019s attention to turn to me.\u201dBut that would never happen.\u201cSo optimistic\u2026 It\u2019s not an oasis. It\u2019s a mirage.\u201d If he simply wanted to grab its attention, there was no real reason to attack like this. The Shadow Brothers had made the wrong assumption. Seo Jun-ho was confident that he could defeat the Nameless Dragon on his own.Still, pulling the Shadow Brothers in made it easier.There\u2019s no need to make it harder than it has to be.Seo Jun-ho raised the Tempest Butterfly again. He was aiming at neither the Nameless Dragon nor the Shadow Brothers, but at the grey sky.The scales really are tough. Most attacks won\u2019t break them.\u00a0Even powerful attacks would only be able to damage the eye.\u00a0And if I make a big blow\u2026The Nameless Dragon would change its target. An enemy that threatened its life was more worth fighting than ants who didn\u2019t even try to attack.\u201cSo I have to finish everything in this next attack.\u201d It would be better to finish this sooner or later.A delayed attack.\u00a0Pouring multiple hits into one attack so that it wouldn\u2019t be able to react. It was one of the merits of ranged weapons, unlike melee weapons.Seo Jun-ho aimed the bow at the sky and poured all his focus into his sight. He blocked out all the sounds around him, forcing himself into a trance. It was as if he was the only person left in the world. As the solitude feeling wrapped around him, he started to make the calculations.Damage area confirmed. Arrow trajectory confirmed. I\u2019ll attack at 0.5 second intervals.He finished fine-tuning and glanced up at his hair blowing in the wind.\u201cWind speed and wind direction\u2026 There\u2019s no need to calculate those.\u201dHe stared at the bow as he muttered to himself. The Tempest Butterfly was only a Rare-grade weapon, and there were many bows that were higher in grade. But there was a simple reason as to why it had become a national treasure.The ability to create a storm.Every arrow that was shot from the Tempest Butterfly carried a storm with it. Whenever an arrow was released, it would create a strong air pressure and rip through all the winds it met.That\u2019s why the wind speed and direction don\u2019t matter.The wind was an age-old enemy for all archers, but once the Tempest Butterfly came into play, its effects disappeared like a ghost.That\u2019s why it became a national treasure, and why the fiend Kal Signer was so interested in a Rare-grade bow.Seo Jun-ho pulled the bowstring as far as it would go, but there was nothing nocked.The Nameless Dragon is a lot bigger than I thought, so an arrow won\u2019t work.\u00a0He started to gather his magic, creating an arrow made of darkness on the bow.Actually, it was much too big to be called an arrow.\u201cDark spear.\u201d It was a two-meter-long spear with a pointy tip. He hadn\u2019t summoned it for show.Darkness is a power that corrupts everything.\u00a0A weapon made of darkness would even ignore the effects of defensive magic. That\u2019s why people had called it \u2018Specter\u2019s strongest spear\u2019 in the past.Woooooshhhh!Seo Jun-ho let go of the bowstring without a second thought. A powerful rush of wind pressure hit him, but he didn\u2019t stumble and repeated the motion instead.Wooosh! Woooooosh! Wooosh!By the time he shot twenty projectiles, only seven seconds had passed. Each spear had their own trajectory as they shot into the sky.They\u2019re all going in the right direction.\u00a0A skilled archer knew the outcome as soon as they let go of the bowstring. Having perfectly launched his attack, he remembered his next goal.\u201cI should get going.\u201d The hunt had finished with this. Now it was time to catch the hunting dogs.Seo Jun-ho, that fucker\u2026Why isn\u2019t he attacking?The Shadow Brothers were starting to panic. After shooting an arrow into the Nameless Dragon\u2019s eye, Seo Jun-ho hadn\u2019t attacked again.As they started to wonder what was wrong, a voice came from behind them.\u201cWhy are you playing some barrage game instead of hunting like I told you to?\u201dIt was a voice that they shouldn\u2019t be hearing. The brothers yelped as they whipped around.\u201cYou crazy\u2026 Why are you here?!\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t you supporting us from the back?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked up at the sky and jutted his chin. Naturally, they followed his line of sight.Twenty stars were falling.\u2026Stars? No, wait, they\u2019re spears. Black spears! Is it the Nameless Dragon\u2019s attack?No, those\u2026 Those are a little different from the dragon\u2019s spears.For the first time since the battle started, the spears fell on the Nameless Dragon instead of the Shadow Brothers.\u2013\u00a0\u201d\u2026?\u201dThe Nameless Dragon turned at the sound of rushing wind.Stab!A black spear pierced through the Nameless Dragon\u2019s body. It didn\u2019t even have time to scream as the spears kept coming. They penetrated through all 15 meters of its body from head to tail, pinning it to the ground.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKiaaaaaaaaahhh!\u201dIt let out a cry so loud that nearby rocks went flying. It thrashed its body in pain, but the spears kept it pinned to the ground and didn\u2019t let it move. As the Shadow Brothers looked upon the dragon writhing like a bug, they started to tremble.He defeated the Nameless Dragon so easily? It was so strong!With such a powerful delayed attack? Wasn\u2019t his main weapon a sword?His weaponry skills were good enough to make them go pale, and the spears were filled with a mysterious power. They quickly realized the situation they were in and waved a white flag.\u201cHey, since we fought together, how about we talk it out?\u201d\u201cYou know that we\u2019re just small fries. Spare us and we\u2019ll tell you the fiends\u2019 meeting point.\u201d It was a pretty good trade and would let him catch bigger fish.But the look in Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t change.\u201cNo. I have no thoughts of letting you go. Fuck off.\u201d He knew that, if they left the Gate alive, things would only get more difficult.Even if they try to escape, the Fiend Association won\u2019t stand idly by.\u00a0They\u2019d either use a telepath or torture to make them spit out everything that had happened in the Gate.\u00a0And then the Fiend Association would start to suspect the origin of my powers.Killing them would be the most efficient option. Seo Jun-ho unsheathed his sword.\u201cYou think we\u2019ll go down without a fight?!\u201d Vincent cursed as he realized Seo Jun-ho wouldn\u2019t negotiate.Stab!There was a familiar sound.Huh? This sound\u2026It was a sound that he heard often. His favorite sound of a heart being stabbed.But this time, it was exceptionally loud. As if it was coming from inside his body instead of out.\u201c\u2026Ah?\u201d Before he knew it, he was on his knees, vomiting blood. He felt at his chest.A sharp sword stuck out through the front side.When did\u2026 he?He couldn\u2019t process what had happened.\u201cVINCENT! You bastard!\u201d Edvar\u2019s enraged shout rang in his ears. Vincent barely managed to turn his head as the life started to fade from his eyes.The last thing he saw before he died was Edvar being beheaded by Seo Jun-ho\u2019s sword.Vincent chuckled as the blood dripped from his lips.What kind\u2026 of bullshit\u2026The fiend, Vincent, died comfortably and cleanly.\u201c\u2026Am I getting softer? I sent them off too easily.\u201dSeo Jun-ho shook the blood off his sword and looked down coldly at the two corpses before him. Killing people always felt icky, but if they were fiends, there was no reason to feel that way.They\u2019d probably already taken hundreds of lives, and that number would only multiply if he let them live.\u201cIf there\u2019s an afterlife for the lot of you, you should spend the whole time repenting.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cKyaooooo!\u201dSeo Jun-ho slowly walked over to the Nameless Dragon as it thrashed. The overwhelming pain wouldn\u2019t let it gather its magic, even if it was a dragon. In other words, it was defenseless.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs he got closer, its bright red eye stared at him. He didn\u2019t know why, but he felt like it was full of sadness.\u201cWhat\u2019s with that look?\u201d Seo Jun-ho started to feel uneasy, but he raised his sword. A black sword aura covered the blade. If the Three Reapers of Gangnam saw, they would have spat out the orange juice they were drinking.\u201cGoodbye.\u201d Seo Jun-ho got on top of the dragon\u2019s body and stabbed his sword through the reverse scale. The Nameless Dragon convulsed, and then went still.[You have cleared \u27eaIsland of the Forgotten Dragon\u27eb.][You have received \u300cDragon Bones (20kg)\u300d as a reward.][You have leveled up.][You have leveled up.][You have leveled up.][You have\u2026][All stats have increased by 5.][You have regained 2 Magic stats.][You have regained 2 Stamina stats.][You have regained 2 Strength stats.][The Gate will automatically disappear in 1 hour.]His level had increased by 5 as a reward for clearing the Gate, but it had gone up a total of six.Hunting other players gives you EXP too.\u00a0That\u2019s why fiends loved PK*.(*Player kill/killing.)Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeo Jun-ho scanned the island before he started toward the Shadow Brothers.

There\u2019s a search bar too.He let out a sigh of relief. People had countless memories, and it would take him days to find the memories he was looking for.Seo Jun-ho started with the most recent memories.\u2014 Wh-why are you doing this to me?\u2014 I-I\u2019ll give you everything! I\u2019ll give you all my money!\u2014\u00a0Gah, urk\u2026Most of the Memory Projection was filled with countless scenes of murder. Seo Jun-ho furrowed his eyebrows and started to regret his actions.Shit, it seems that I let them off too easily.\u00a0He clicked his tongue lightly and put \u2018Association\u2019 in the search bar.In the video, the Shadow Brothers were in America, carrying suits to a laundromat. A man took their clothes and started to press them as he spoke.\u2014 These are orders from above. Check them.\u2014 Orders? We\u2019re preparing for the Las Vegas auction.\u2014 Why are you complaining to me? I\u2019m just a messenger, so I don\u2019t know the details.Jim\u2019s Cleaners.

It was obvious that he was a higher-ranking fiend than them.\u201cIt would\u2019ve been nice if I saw his face.\u201d It might have been because his skill rank was too low, but the man\u2019s face was dim, as if covered by static.Seo Jun-ho huffed in frustration and stood up. He looked through Edvar\u2019s memories this time, but the man\u2019s appearance caused the skill to deactivate again.If I want to see more useful memories, I should raise my skill rank.If you used a skill a lot, your technique would improve and it might raise the rank.Of course, depending on one\u2019s talent and the amount of effort given, there are people who can\u2019t raise a skill rank their entire lives\u2026But Seo Jun-ho was extremely talented. He was also a hardened worker who pushed his body to its limits.

Seo Jun-ho walked over to the Nameless Dragon\u2019s corpse.To be honest, I am a little curious.\u00a0As to why the dragon had looked at him with such a sad expression, and about its origins.\u201cIf the dragon is this strong, it should have had a name too.\u201d The Cinder Fox didn\u2019t even begin to compare to it.He was only able to kill it that easily because he\u2019d used the Shadow Brothers as bait. If he hadn\u2019t, he would have had to prepare to take damage. That\u2019s how strong it was.\u201cShow me what kind of guy you were.\u201dSeo Jun-ho gently placed his hand on the Nameless Dragon\u2019s forehead.Wooosh!Perhaps it was because he\u2019d already done it twice before, but the sight of the screen was familiar. However, unlike the brothers, the Nameless Dragon\u2019s Memory Projection consisted only of one short video.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dAs he started to admire the scenes of the video, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face gradually softened.* * *The king on the throne had a very sickly complexion. He coughed up phlegm and looked down at the empty Royal Palace.\u201cBeop-sa*,\u201d he said solemnly.(TN: Means Buddhist priest, also a title.)\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d A Buddhist monk wearing a robe bowed his head to the king.\u201cI don\u2019t have much time left.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201d\u201cMy death is already decided. I should be more focused on more realistic problems at present.\u201dThe king slowly got up from his seat and opened a window, looking up at the painted-blue sky.\u201cIt has only been five years since the long war between the three nations ended.\u201d\u201cYour peoples\u2019 praises reach the sky.\u201d\u201cOf course, the people are enjoying this era of peace. But we know that the war is still not over.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe king was right. The Great Republic* from the north was still waiting for a chance to invade their land.(TN: Old Korean name for China.)They said that an era of peace had begun, but it was as futile as a lamp in a storm.\u201cI will die soon. Even my peerless generals who once defended this land are getting old.\u201d\u201cRiver water always flows from above to below. The junior scholars will not smear the names of their ancestors.\u201d\u201cAh, as they should. As they should.\u201dThe king had a proud expression on his face as he looked up at the floating clouds and closed his eyes.\u201cBut talent is not enough. The Great Republic is a nation protected by countless Shin-ryongs* of departed heroes.\u201d(TN: lit. God-dragon)\u201cThey are simply evil spirits.\u201d\u201cBut what if they are not?\u201d The king\u2019s bright red yong-po* fluttered as he turned around.(TN: Kingly robes, usually red with golden embroidery and dragon symbolism.)\u201cIf there really are dragons that protect their land, do you think my people and soldiers will be able to face them?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The beop-sa closed his mouth. From his Buddhist perspective, he did not understand the king\u2019s concern.The king looked at him for a second and slowly opened his mouth. \u201c\u2026When I die, cremate my body and release my ashes in the Eastern Sea.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d The beop-sa\u2019s voice cracked in surprise. He was supposed to be laid to rest with his ancestors in the tomb. Why did he suddenly want to be cremated?But the king spoke firmly with an unbreakable resolution.\u201cI shall become the Guardian Dragon of the Nation and protect this country.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, a dragon is but a dragon. Even though we reside in the human realm, we are no different than the animals below us. Why must you reject reincarnation and carry the karma of an asura?*\u201d(TN: These are all Buddhist concepts. In Korean Buddhism, an asura is a violent spirit that is always fighting with Sakra, a ruler of one of the heavens. Because the king will not die as a dragon, he will not be reincarnated.)\u201cBeop-sa, I have already experienced all the luxuries the world has to offer. If I lose myself and become a beast, that will be my destiny.\u201dThe Memory Projection zoomed out of an image of the laughing king as it ended. Seo Jun-ho took a second to process this and forced a laugh.\u201c\u2026Hah?\u201dHe\u2019d started to realize who the Nameless Dragon was.The person who called himself a Guardian Dragon of the Nation\u2026It was a name that anyone in Korea would have heard at least once in their history class: the person who brought an end to the Three Kingdoms Era through unification, King Munmu of Silla.\u201cWow, I never expected this. What just happened?\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered to himself as he scratched the back of his head.Then, a new message popped up in front of him.[You have witnessed a portion of history through the confession of the dead.][Your skill proficiency has increased drastically.]Huh? I didn\u2019t expect this either.\u00a0Today was full of surprises, it seemed.Seo Jun-ho looked wearily at the Nameless Dragon\u2019s corpse. He\u2019d killed him, but wasn\u2019t he an ancestor who had protected this land from foreign invasion?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho took a moment to sort his thoughts. He slowly brought his hands politely together in prayer. \u201c\u2026O King, this land is now safe. I bid you a good rest.\u201dA white light started to peek between the Nameless Dragon\u2019s pitch-black scales. The tumorous scales melted against the light, and a transparent, holy dragon looked down at him from the sky.Is that\u2026 his spirit?\u00a0A soul without a body.He heard a clear voice in his head.\u2013\u00a0\u201cYou prayed\u2026 for me\u2026 Thank you\u2026 I can now\u2026 ascend\u2026\u201dThe dragon looked down at Seo Jun-ho once more before it pierced through the pitch-black clouds and ascended above the sky.[You have cleared the hidden quest of \u27eaForgotten Dragon\u2019s Island\u27eb, \u2018Dragon\u2019s Ascension\u2019.][You have received the item, \u300cFlute of Tidal Breath\u300d.][You have received the title, \u27ecHelper of Ascension\u27ed.][You have leveled up.][All stats have increased by 1.][You have regained 3 Speed stats.][You have regained 1 Strength stat.][You have regained 2 Stamina stats.]\u201cThis was a hidden quest?\u201d He\u2019d even reached level 20 as an additional reward. Seo Jun-ho scratched his head and let out another laugh.\u201c\u2026Well, sometimes surprises are good.\u201d His perfect clear was completely different from what he expected, but it wasn\u2019t bad.His eyes lingered on the evening glow against the ocean before he left the Gate.* * *\u201cTh-the Gate\u2019s color changed! It\u2019s green! They did it!\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll come out soon! Keep the doctors on standby!\u201d\u201cHey, reporters at the front! Stand behind the line!\u201dIlsan Beach was full of commotion. The Association had sent a medical team just in case, keeping them on standby while the reporters were being blocked from the front.A man walked out of the Gate and into an air full of anxiety and anticipation.\u201cSeo Jun-ho! It\u2019s Korea\u2019s player Seo Jun-ho!\u201d\u201cBut why does he look so dark?\u201d\u201cHuh? Wait, the Gate is\u2026 closing?\u201d\u201cThen the Shadow Brothers\u2026\u201d The people fell into chaos.If someone died in the Gate, they expected it to be Seo Jun-ho. They\u2019d never imagined that it would be the Shadow Brothers.Shim Deok-gu walked up to Seo Jun-ho with a forlorn expression and patted his shoulder.\u201c\u2026You\u2019ve worked very hard, player Seo Jun-ho.\u201d It was a charged statement.The fact that he came out alone meant that the Shadow Brothers had indeed been fiends. It also meant that he\u2019d taken care of them.Click, click!Detached from the scene, the reporters took two-shots of them. A grieving player who\u2019d lost two teammates, and the Association President who was consoling him. It was the perfect composition.A moment later, he was cleared of any major injuries and went up to the interview podium.\u201c\u2026It was an accident.\u201d Fat tears spilled from his eyes, convincing enough to make Shim Deok-gu squint from a distance.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter spending plenty of time sniffling, Seo Jun-ho finally continued.\u201cI will not forget the Shadow Brothers and their heroic sacrifice.\u201dHe was thoroughly making them into heroes.(PR: Someone give this guy an Oscar.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They watched Kal Signer silently, and he slowly nodded.\u201cI\u2019m sure of one thing. This guy\u2019s luck is damningly good.\u201d Seo Jun-ho explained the conquest in great detail in his interview.Seo Jun-ho had been shocked when he first went in.\u2026Well, it makes sense. No one would have guessed that a Gate with a dragon would be formatted as a maze.Generally, Gates with dragons were large, open spaces. But this time, it was a tight, narrow maze. It was something even Kal Signer hadn\u2019t expected.On top of that, it\u2019s the type that separates them from the beginning\u2026 The worst.But the Gates that separated the teammates often had a pattern.[I barely managed to escape from the twisting maze\u2026 That took me about five hours. And when I finally got out, there was an open space. And there were the Shadow Brothers\u2019\u2026 c-corpses\u2026 and a dying dragon. If I\u2019d only gotten out a little earlier\u2026\u00a0Sniff,\u00a0it\u2019s all because I wasn\u2019t strong enough.]Kal Signer\u2019s face contorted even more. As Seo Jun-ho twisted the story even more, his teary face became detestable.Hoo\u2026 The most frustrating thing is that it makes sense. Even if he\u2019s strong for someone barely over level 10, the Shadow Brothers were stronger and would have come out earlier.And their superior skill had gotten them killed. They\u2019d encountered the Nameless Dragon and fought without a moment to prepare.In the end, it was mutual destruction.As ridiculous as it was, the weakest one had emerged last and lived.\u201cHe really is lucky.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s my first time seeing someone like this.\u201d\u201cHow shall we deal with the Las Vegas auction? It was originally assigned to the Shadow Brothers.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201d Talk about adding insult to injury. This year\u2019s auction would feature the top-grade magic core, \u2018Heaven\u2019s Breath\u2019. The Fiend Association\u2019s executives had directly ordered for it to be retrieved. They had to get it no matter what.\u201cFuck. The Shadow Brothers were perfect for the job\u2026\u201d Kal Signer looked like he had a headache.If he didn\u2019t figure this out, he would be in danger.I sent the Shadow Brothers to find the Tempest Butterfly\u2026 out of my own judgement.\u00a0When he\u2019d given the command, he didn\u2019t expect things to get this complicated. He\u2019d thought that the brothers would be able to kill Seo Jun-ho easily, but they\u2019d died because of the Gate\u2019s unexpected pattern.If I can\u2019t retrieve Heaven\u2019s Breath because of their absence\u2026\u00a0It would become an issue that would even affect the area around him.Kal Signer seemed to have decided something as he spoke to his subordinate.\u201cAren\u2019t the Watchdogs coming to the 2nd floor?\u201d\u201cYes, the superior said their skills were wasted on the 1st floor. They were ordered to advance to the 2nd floor.\u201d\u201c\u2026Send them the order to push it off. I\u2019ll leave the Las Vegas auction to them.\u201d\u201cHuh? But Signer-nim, their summons\u2026\u201dThe executive who\u2019d called the Watchdogs to the 2nd floor was of higher status than Signer. He was overstepping his authority. The Fiend Association was ruled by a single, powerful ruler, and no one would bat an eye even if Kal Signer\u2019s head was cut off.But he had no other options.\u201cDid you forget? The Fiend Association only cares about results and skill. I might get beaten a few times\u2026 but that\u2019s better than losing Heaven\u2019s Breath.\u201dHis subordinate gulped.He made sense. The Watchdogs were the strongest fiends on the 1st floor.But if the Watchdogs fail\u2026\u00a0Their boss would definitely die, but they might die too. Their shoulders shook as they bowed their head.(PR: \u201cTheir\u201d and \u201cthey\u201d both refer to the subordinate here.)\u201cI\u2019ll tell them that they must succeed.\u201d\u201cThey won\u2019t fail. The Watchdogs\u2026 It\u2019s a waste for them to be on the 1st floor.\u201dThe average level out of the three members was 53. Their level and skills no longer suited the 1st floor, so Kal Signer was sure that they would succeed.* * *\u201c\u2026What\u2019s all this?\u201d Seo Jun-ho stared blankly at the mountains of documents on the desk. Cha Si-eun poked her head out from behind it.\u201cThey\u2019re love calls for Jun-ho-nim. Personal commission requests.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why didn\u2019t you sort them this time?\u201d He asked, looking at the enormous pile of documents. She looked tired as she responded.\u201c\u2026I worked hard to organize them.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still this much\u00a0after\u00a0you sorted them?\u201d Seo Jun-ho was shocked. Sure, clearing the Eastern Sea Gate was a great achievement. Now, South Korea was the first country in the world without Uncleared Gates. It was even deemed the first special safe zone.\u201cBut still, I didn\u2019t expect this much\u2026 I barely even helped in clearing the Gate.\u201d\u201cBut in the end, you\u2019re the only one who survived. Luck is also a skill for players.\u201d\u201c\u2026Touch\u00e9.\u201d Slowly nodding, Seo Jun-ho looked at the mountain of documents in disgust. \u201cSo, you wanted to show me these because you wanted me to choose?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve picked out the best ones by taking into consideration the commissioner, compensation, and difficulty.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u00a0I got it.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Cha Si-eun took a step toward Seo Jun-ho.\u201cWh-what is it?\u201d She stared closely at him and gave a look of dissatisfaction.\u201cAs I thought, you need to get your hair done. I\u2019ve noticed it for a while now, but it\u2019s a lot more obvious in the pictures from yesterday\u2019s press conference. Your hair is too messy right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not a celebrity or anything. Is it really necessary?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d She shouted with a determined voice. She tapped on her Vita and pulled up a window for reference. It was a list of profiles of the current star players. Not all of them were as handsome or pretty as celebrities, but it was clear that they were all well-maintained.\u201cSome of them aren\u2019t even as big as you. But at least they don\u2019t look lame in their official photos.\u201d\u201cLame\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered sullenly. He picked up the mirror on the desk and looked at his hair.\u2026Yeah, it\u2019s gotten a lot longer.\u00a0It had already been a month since he\u2019d emerged from the ice. His hair had kept growing, and it looked messy.\u201cYou\u2019re planning to rest today, correct?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d\u201cThen please go to the salon on this business card and get your hair cut.\u201d Seo Jun-ho took the card and sighed. At times like this, he missed being Specter.Now I get why my friends always complained about makeup.Whenever the Five Heroes held a press conference, he always had to listen to their grumbling. Of course, he always wore his mask and had never gotten his makeup done before.\u201cYou should go home early too, then.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how much you worked if this is the result of sorting the commissions. Go home for today.\u201dShe looked the happiest he\u2019d ever seen her.\u201cThank you!\u201d Cha Si-eun bowed and quickly dashed out of the room, leaving Seo Jun-ho alone.\u201cWow, she sure is happy.\u201d He reached into a drawer and put on a face mask. There were too many people that recognized him now.Seo Jun-ho studied his freshly-cut hair in the elevator mirror, looking satisfied.\u201cYou handsome bastard.\u201d If someone heard him, they\u2019d call him a narcissist and look at him weirdly, but they wouldn\u2019t be able to deny it. He really did look good with his voluminous swallow perm.Getting a haircut is pretty refreshing.\u00a0In the past, he\u2019d go to a nearby hair salon whenever he felt like his hair got too long. It was run by an old lady who was always chewing gum and had a dog with a tail that was dyed pink.\u201cYou take some, you lose some.\u201d When he was Specter, no one would recognize him if he simply took off the mask. But now, it was different.He was Korea\u2019s young hero and a rising player. He\u2019d made the country into a special safe zone and was just as good as the other star players.Well, it\u2019s just annoying for me.\u00a0He grumbled as he sighed and put his face mask back on before the elevator opened again. He went out into a crowded street and hailed a taxi to go to a manhwa bang*.(TN: \u2018Manhwa room\u2019, you pay to sit in a quiet space and read the manhwa/books that they have. Usually quite cheap and often offer snacks/drinks.)\u201cIt\u2019s nice to relieve stress like this every once in a while.\u201dHe\u2019d done that often when he was Specter. When you lived your whole life training and fighting, you needed to breathe every once in a while.Ring!\u00a0Seo Jun-ho entered the manhwa bang and started to pick out some novels.This place never has any customers. I wonder if they\u2019ll go under.\u00a0This was only the third time he\u2019d come here, but it was easy to guess why that was the case.There\u2019s a lot of luxurious book cafes these days.\u00a0Those places were like cafes or restaurants and offered coffee, drinks, and good food. On the other hand, this was a classic manhwa bang that only offered ramen, frozen dumplings, and fish cake bars.Well, it\u2019s better for me if there aren\u2019t any customers.\u00a0He pulled off his mask and found himself a spot in a corner.\u201cHuh?\u201d He paused. He\u2019d thought that there weren\u2019t any customers, but there was an occupant. She was wearing a sloppy gym suit, and there was a hair roller in her windblown hair. She was blowing on the ramen in one hand, but her focus was on the novel in the other. It wasn\u2019t the skill of a manhwa bang newbie.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe noticed his presence behind her and glanced up. When she saw him, she started coughing as if she were poisoned.\u201cUrk\u2026\u00a0cough, cough!\u201d\u00a0She placed her chopsticks down at the speed of light and hid her face behind the book.The book was enough to cover her entire face\u2014perhaps because it was small\u2014but it was too late.\u201c\u2026Secretary Cha?\u201d Seo Jun-ho asked awkwardly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing as how her cheeks were slightly red, she was probably embarrassed. She started to make excuses as if she was caught doing something wrong.\u201cI\u2019m 23 years old. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s strange for a grown adult to be reading novels.\u201d This new side of her was refreshing, Seo Jun-ho thought.\u201cI didn\u2019t say it\u2019s strange.

It was very good.\u201dSeo Jun-ho looked around the shabby manhwa bang. \u201cTo be honest, I was a little surprised.\u201d\u201cTo see me in a place like this?\u201d\u201cYes. I heard you were an elite. I thought you were far above places like this.\u201d\u201cMost people think that.\u201d She stretched and pulled out her hair roller. \u201cBut I like this place.

There were only two small-fry fiends there.If I can\u2019t extract anything useful from them\u2026 the trail will go cold.\u00a0He prayed that they\u2019d have useful information.\u201cWell, since you say that, I\u2019ll stop worrying. Just let me know if you ever need help.\u201d He sure was reliable. Shim Deok-gu changed the subject. \u201cDid you hear? There was a civilian petition on the Blue House* homepage to give you a medal.\u201d(TN: Korean equivalent of the White House.)\u201cMedal? Why?\u201d\u201cKorea became the first special safe zone thanks to you.\u201d\u201cGeez\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho sulked.\u201cThe Association can help you get it if you want\u2026 What do you think?\u201d\u201cDeok-gu, do you know how many medals Korea has?\u201d Deok-gu was snapped out of his thoughts and shook his head.\u201cNope. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s common knowledge.\u201d\u201cThere are 56 in total. How do I know? I received all of them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen he was Specter, he had been showered with medals. He\u2019d received the famous Grand Order of Mugunghwa*, and the insignificant Saemaeul Merit* because it was forbidden by law to receive two of the same medal.(TN: The mugunghwa/rose of Sharon is the national flower of Korea. This medal is only given to Presidents and their spouses. Saemaeul Merit is given to those who make social contributions.)\u201cThe highest I can get is probably the 3rd-grade Order of Diplomatic Service Merit*. I don\u2019t need it. I already have it.\u201d(TN: Second-highest medal after the mugunghwa, one of the highest civilian awards. It has 5 grades with 1 being the highest.)\u201c\u2026Most people would tremble at the thought of getting the 5th-grade Order.\u201d\u201cYou try getting 50 medals. The ceremony\u2019s hella annoying. And\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho took out 10 kg of dragon bones from his inventory. Shim Deok-gu stared, dumbfounded.\u201cBones?\u201d\u201cDragon bones.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d It depended on the individual grades, but 10 kg of dragon bones could easily sell for hundreds of millions of won.\u201cSo you got it from killing the Nameless Dragon. But why did you take them out?\u201d\u201cThis is 10 kilograms. I\u2019ll take half. Give the rest to Kwon Noya and commission him for a sword.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d Deok-gu turned on his Vita and opened a memo. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any other specifications? The weight, the length?\u201d\u201cJust tell him to make the one I always use. He\u2019ll know.\u201d\u201cThe old man\u2019s turning 100 tomorrow. Are you sure he will?\u201d Seo Jun-ho grinned.\u201cThen tell him this: if he can\u2019t remember that much, he should put down his hammer and start a gamgyul* orchard in the countryside.\u201d(TN: A type of Korean mandarin orange.)\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not my fault if he adds a suicide bomb to the sword, okay?\u201d\u201cKek.\u201d\u201cAnyways, thanks for the dragon bones.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied coolly.Seo Jun-ho went back to his room and flopped onto his bed. He tapped on his Vita and sent a message to Secretary Cha.\u2013 Secretary Cha, please get me a ticket to Las Vegas for tomorrow.\u2013 (An emoticon of a saluting cat.)She never used emoticons before. He felt like it was a sign that they\u2019d gotten closer after yesterday.\u201cNow, then\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes sparkled as he rifled through his inventory. A moment later, he pulled out a refined bamboo flute.\u201cThe Flute of Tidal Breath.\u201d It was the ritual flute that rid the whole world of hardships and brought peace. Depending on how it was used, you could have the whole world in your hands. It was such a treasure. He admired the flute with a new glint in his eyes.It looks cool. Though I won\u2019t know the extent of its abilities until I use it.\u00a0He checked the item info.\u300cFlute of Tidal Breath\u300dGrade: UniquePlaying the flute will grant one of the following abilities:King\u2019s armyKing\u2019s expanseKing\u2019s purityThis item will break after three uses.

Sword aura didn\u2019t simply require a high Magic stat but also required an understanding for it. In the past, his Magic stat had been 115 when he\u2019d received an understanding and started to use sword aura.I might be able to get it faster than in the past.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeo Jun-ho had been planning to rest all day, but he suddenly sat up.\u201cI can\u2019t just lay around after seeing this.\u201d He needed to fine-tune his body with his new stats.A drop of sweat spilled in training is a drop of blood saved on the battlefield.That was one of his favorite mottos.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He really missed her at times like these.He let out a light sigh, stretching out his stiff body before going to check in at the hotel. As soon as he entered the room, he tossed aside his suitcase and opened the curtains wide to look at the city below.\u201cIt really is an amazing city.\u201dLas Vegas was famous for having barely any monsters. All the hotels were owned by rich heirs, and they hired players to protect their assets whenever monsters showed up.\u201cCapitalism is the best here.\u201dHe\u2019d heard on the street that a huge auction would open in a few days.

A shiver went down his spine.\u201c\u2026Dammit, I didn\u2019t think we would have to see the Watchdogs again, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\u201d\u201cWatchdogs? Oh, they\u2019re going instead of the twins?\u201d\u201cYeah, those lunatics.\u201dThe Watchdogs were famous among the fiends on the 1st floor for their skill and were respected by many. But the bald man was only scared of them.\u201cLunatics? Have you met them before?\u201d\u201cYeah. They\u2019re actually crazy.\u201d He\u2019d come to own the laundromat because the Watchdogs had killed his former boss for no apparent reason.\u201cThey said that it had been too long since they\u2019d smelled blood\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d The bald man shook his head and sighed.Ring!\u00a0The door opened and three people walked in. His face fell and he stood up immediately.\u201cW-w-welcome.\u201d\u201c\u2026The fuck. Why\u2019s it so hot in here? Wanna die?\u201dThe woman looked at him hysterically, chewing loudly on gum. If it were anyone else, he would\u2019ve told them to try him, but the bald man shivered and bowed his head.\u201cI apologize!\u201d\u201cTsk.\u00a0Just bring the orders.\u201dThe bald man went to the supply room and back at a speed unfitting for his size, carrying an envelope.The woman snatched it from his hands and read over the documents. She spat her gum on the floor and her eyes narrowed.\u201cLook at this. The rumors were true.\u201d\u201cSo we\u2019re really not going to the 2nd floor?\u201d\u201cSee for yourself.\u201dThe skinny man next to her looked over the documents and gritted his teeth.

Heaven\u2019s Breath, of all things.\u201d\u201cI agree with Bones here for once.

He was covered in sweat.His co-worker had read the room and had stayed silent the whole time. \u201cWere they\u2026 the Watchdogs?\u201d He asked carefully.\u201cYeah. I thought I was gonna die.\u201d\u201cThe lady and the man were pretty scary. But the boss seemed like a decent person?\u201d\u201cDecent?\u201d\u00a0The bald man looked at him like he was a discarded cigarette butt. \u201cAre your eyes just there for decoration?\u201d\u201cThe fuck? Why are you taking it out on me?\u201d The bald man held his tongue as he stood up.\u201cDidn\u2019t you see how the so-called scary guys were intimidated by their own boss?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, they were. I don\u2019t know why, though.\u201d To him, those two seemed much stronger than their quiet boss.\u201cI\u2019ll only say this once, so listen carefully.\u201d He looked around to double-check that no one else was in the store. \u201cThe Watchdogs\u2019 boss is the third disciple of the Nine Heaven\u2019s Nazad Hallow.\u201d\u201cWhat? Wait, if he\u2019s Hallow-nim\u2019s student\u2026\u201d His co-worker\u2019s eyes went wide. He lowered his voice. \u201cThen is that man the one who caused the massacre in Turkey six months ago\u2026 Skeleton Mage Arma?\u201d\u201cRight. He has a huge international bounty on his head because of it, but no one\u2019s ever come close.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201d He\u2019d looked down on such a man?A chill went up his neck and he unconsciously touched his throat.\u201cThere\u2019s also a rumor that the Watchdogs was originally comprised of five members, but two of them became Arma\u2019s skeletons.\u201d\u201cHe really is a lunatic.\u201d\u201cRight? He\u2019s a nutjob.\u201d One of the most enjoyable things in the world is gossiping behind your superior\u2019s back. The two men whispered to each other. Suddenly, the door opened.The two men\u2019s faces went pale, thinking that the Watchdogs had come back. They quickly looked toward the door.\u201c\u2026Phew.\u201d\u201cGeez, that timing. I got scared.\u201d The two fiends sighed in relief.The person who\u2019d come in was not one of the Watchdogs, but an Asian man wearing a baseball cap. Annoyed by the sudden entrance, the bald man looked at him in disgust.\u201cAre you here to fix the air conditioner?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s broken?\u201d The man spoke in fluent English. But that wasn\u2019t strange in America, which was a multiethnic state. The bald man nodded.\u201cI\u2019m about to die from the heat.\u201d\u201cI think I can help with that.\u201d\u201cYou can? How?\u201d At that, the man held up one hand. The temperature of the store quickly began to fall.\u201cOooh. It\u2019s cool!\u201d\u201cAh, finally.\u201d The two fiends laughed and clapped their hands like seals.\u201cYou\u2019re amazing!\u201d\u201cYou were a player?\u201dThe man nodded lightly. And the temperature continued to fall.Shiver.\u00a0The two fiends felt cold all over their bodies and started to rub at their arms.\u201cHey, that\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cThanks for helping, but the temperature\u2019s too low now. It\u2019s cold.\u201dBut the man didn\u2019t stop. And the cold only got more intense.The cold started to seep into their bones, and their teeth started to chatter. They scowled.\u201cHey, we said it\u2019s cold! There\u2019s no need to make it even colder!\u201d\u201cIf this is your idea of a joke, stop it while we\u2019re being nice.\u201dSeo Jun-ho chuckled as he lowered his cap\u2019s visor even more.\u201cYou\u2019re stupid, even for fiends.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cTh-this bastard, he knows something!\u201dThey realized what was going on and reached for their weapons, but their bodies wouldn\u2019t listen. Seo Jun-ho easily defeated them and changed the sign of the front door to say \u2018CLOSED\u2019. He looked back at the two frozen fiends and muttered to himself.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like boiling frogs.\u201dIf you put a frog in a pan of boiling water, it would be startled by the heat and leap out right away. But if you made the water lukewarm and slowly boiled it, it wouldn\u2019t try to escape.Thanks to that, I was able to wrap it up quietly.The two fiends were around level 30 each. Seo Jun-ho would still have won easily in direct combat, but he was in a city, and the sandwich store next door was also open for business.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing good about causing a ruckus.\u201d He hadn\u2019t expected the air conditioner to be broken, but Seo Jun-ho had been able to use his wits.\u201cHey, what do you want from us?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll cooperate. We\u2019ll tell you everything we know.\u201dTheir eyes had gone red at some point. Seo Jun-ho shook his head. The fiends started to panic and spoke sharply.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to find anything in this store if you kill us.\u201d\u201cYou need our help. Dead men don\u2019t speak.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really? I disagree.\u201dClack.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho turned off the lights and laughed coldly as he approached the two men.\u201cActually, the dead have a lot to say.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho finished using his skill as he sat on a chair in the supply room. He\u2019d plucked all the memories he\u2019d needed from the two dead fiends and started to sort his thoughts.They really were just small fries.\u00a0But that didn\u2019t mean that they were weak players. The laundromat was a front to deliver orders to fiends on the 1st floor. The Fiend Association wouldn\u2019t leave it to just anyone.Crunch, crunch!\u00a0Dark canines emerged from the floor and chewed on the fiends\u2019 corpses. A moment later, the floor of the supply room didn\u2019t have a single drop of blood.\u201cThe Watchdogs\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho suddenly remembered something and quickly tapped on his Vita.\u2013 \u201cUgh\u2026 Hello\u2026\u201d\u201cDeok-gu?\u201d\u2013 \u201cHey, you crazy bastard\u2026 It\u2019s 2:30 AM here\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry I woke you, but I have a favor to ask.\u201d\u2013 \u201c\u2026Why?

Even your shoes, necktie, and watch have all been prepared.\u201dThe gift was sudden, but it made sense.

Though kids these days might not know.(TN: Boxing match between two world champions that happened in 2015. The hotel and arena are a real place.)Today, he was just planning to check out the hotel.

Obviously, he\u2019d never gone as a kid, and when he became an adult, he\u2019d been too busy hunting monsters. It piqued his curiosity, but when he got close to the entrance, an alarm went off. Right away, a number of male players in suits approached him.\u201cHuh? Mr. Seo Jun-ho?\u201dThe person at the front looked at him with recognition, his eyes wide.Do I know that guy?\u00a0Even after seeing his face, Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t recognize him.

It was the player who had been escorting Gong Juha. He shook his hand in a friendly gesture. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t recognize you. I\u2019m Seo Jun-ho.\u201d\u201cNo worries. I wouldn\u2019t have recognized me either. I\u2019m Ha Inho of the Dokkaebi Guild.\u201dA princess and a servant, they were a match made in heaven.(TN: The characters \u2018Gong Ju\u2019 and \u2018Ha In\u2019 from their names mean \u2018princess\u2019 and \u2018servant\u2019, respectively. \u2018Gong\u2019 and \u2018Ha\u2019 are real surnames.)Ha Inho looked around. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we would meet in a place like this.\u201d\u201cI heard a huge auction is going to be held here, so I came to take a look.\u201d Inho grinned at that.\u201cReally? Actually, my team came down to the 1st floor because of the auction as well. We received a commission from the hosts to act as security.\u201dIt was the Dokkaebi Guild, after all. At such a big auction, they needed someone with that level of skill and reliability.\u201cAh, were you thinking of entering the casino?\u201d\u201cYes, but the alarm went off.\u201d Seo Jun-ho shrugged, and Ha Inho laughed.\u201cYou may know this, but players are very different from normal people.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cAfter the world changed, the casino industry suffered huge losses because of players.\u201d\u201cBecause they used their physical abilities and special skills to cheat.\u201d\u201cExactly. It started with X-ray vision, then mind reading, then foresight and et cetera\u2026 There are so many skills you can use in a casino.\u201d Ha Inho casually started to lead Seo Jun-ho somewhere. \u201cSo, their solution was to separate casinos for normal people and players.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 there\u2019s a casino made specifically for players?\u201d\u201cBingo. You catch on quick.\u201dHa Inho opened a large hardwood door with a clack. At first glance, it didn\u2019t seem much different from the outside, but Seo Jun-ho quickly realized.\u201cThey\u2019re all players.\u201d The hundreds of people in the room were all players.\u201cYes. This is a casino for players. You\u2019re allowed to use your skills however you wish because the dealers are also players.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 doesn\u2019t that mean that higher-level players are at an absolute advantage?\u201dA higher level meant higher stats and a better understanding of one\u2019s skills. But Ha Inho looked a little embarrassed as he tilted his head.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not necessarily true. The skills you use in combat are quite different from the skills you need in games.\u201d\u201cNooooooo!\u201dSeo Jun-ho turned at the sound. It came from a girl who was holding her head in her hands. An elegant frame and wavy, red hair. Someone you can\u2019t forget after meeting once.\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t she with you?\u201d\u201cOur Princess\u2026 has no talent for games.\u201d Ha Inho looked at Gong Juha with the face of a parent looking at their child who was playing instead of studying. \u201cThen, we\u2019ll be going back to our patrol.\u201d\u201cThank you for taking me here.\u201d Ha Inho waved goodbye, and Seo Jun-ho started to walk around.A Player Casino\u2026\u00a0First, he\u2019d check out what games they had. Most people would go to a casino to play roulette, slots, baccarat, poker, blackjack, and so on. But this place didn\u2019t have those kinds of games.Rather than a game of chance or wits\u2026 it\u2019s gambling based off of a player\u2019s skills.\u00a0It would be more accurate to call it a game center than a casino. Though, based on the chips that were passed around, it was merely another casino.\u201cI-it was definitely number two! Is this a scam?\u201d Seo Jun-ho walked toward Gong Juha, who was vehemently denying the truth. The scam she was talking about was a game where you had to guess which out of the three cups had the ball underneath.\u201cIs this fun?\u201d\u201cI already lost 10 million won, do you think I\u2019m having\u2014Huh?\u201d(TN: ~90k USD)Gong Juha instantly recognized him as she turned around. Her expression quickly softened, and her eyes went wide.\u201cWow, it\u2019s Mr. Snake head!\u201d She exclaimed.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s Seo Jun-ho.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up? Did you come all the way here because you wanted to become my subordinate? I\u2019m touched!\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked at her with an absurd expression and took a seat.\u201cAhaha, it\u2019s a joke. A joke. So, what brings you here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m participating in the auction tomorrow. I had some time so I came to look around the casino, and Mr. Ha Inho brought me here.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201d She looked down at the band on her left arm and shrugged. \u201cWell, let me know if anything happens. I\u2019m the captain of security here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t bother asking if it was okay for her to gamble during work hours.\u201cOh, I heard that Korea became a special safe zone thanks to you.\u201d\u201cI was lucky. The Shadow Brothers did most of the work.\u201d\u201cIn this industry, luck is also a skill.\u201dSeo Jun-ho smiled faintly and nodded. \u201cThank you. Anyways, is this game hard?\u201d\u201cUgh!\u00a0Don\u2019t mention that.\u201d She glared at the dealer. Having nowhere else to look, the dealer innocently looked at the ground. \u201cHis hands are really fast. I heard that he was active on the 2nd floor but retired and became a dealer.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know who he is?\u201d\u201cHow would I? They\u2019re all wearing masks.\u201d Just as she said, all the dealers wore pure-white masks and matching gloves. It was easy to tell why.To hide the dealers\u2019 identities and skills.Seo Jun-ho raised his hand, and a waiter brought him chips to trade. He only bought about a million won\u2019s worth of chips and pushed out ten.(TN: ~10k USD)\u201cYou\u2019re going all-in? This guy\u2019s hands are really fast. It would be better to bet higher after you get used to it\u2026\u201d She remarked.\u201cDid you lose 10 million after doing that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe hit her with the facts, and Gong Juha turned away, looking hurt.She\u2019s sulking.\u00a0But because of that, it was quiet now.\u201cShall I start?\u201d The dealer asked.\u201cYes.\u201d The dealer flipped the cups to show him the ball was in the middle and started shuffling them. Seo Jun-ho looked surprised.\u2026He\u2019s super fast.\u00a0The dealer\u2019s hands left afterimages as he mixed them. There were only three cups, but it looked like there were six.Tap!\u00a0The dealer finished shuffling them.\u201cPlease choose.\u201d His voice was confident.\u201cOh, I got it.\u201d Gong Juha seemed to have cooled off as the cups were shuffled. She advised him. \u201cI think it\u2019s the one on the left. I think I really got it this time. Oh, should I bet now\u2026?\u201dSeo Jun-ho turned to her. \u201cI think it would be best if Team Leader Gong stopped gambling from now on.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t finish the sentence after seeing her innocent face tilted to the side.\u00a0Because you really suck.\u00a0He picked the cup in the center.Next to him, Gong Juha muttered that it was the one on the left and Seo Jun-ho laughed. The dealer flipped the cup in the middle to reveal the ball.\u201cCongratulations.\u201d The dealer stacked ten more chips to Seo Jun-ho\u2019s pile and pushed it toward him. He\u2019d doubled the amount in no time at all.\u201cW-wow! What is this? Is this the so-called beginner\u2019s luck? It really was the middle!\u201d She exclaimed like she was the one that won, and then gave her two cents again. \u201cBut you should stop. You\u2019re supposed to stop gambling after you win.\u201d She looked bitter as she added, \u201c\u2026Of course, I couldn\u2019t stop because I didn\u2019t win.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with that sob story?\u201d He was about to get up when two new players sat next to them.\u201cHey, Bones. Wanna play against me?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeo Jun-ho watched them from the corner of his eyes and sat back down.\u2026Why are they here?He\u2019d never met those two before but ironically knew them better than anyone else.The Watchdogs.\u00a0He\u2019d seen them in the fiends\u2019 memories.

    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of the Frozen PlayerCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWatchdog Hunt (1)They\u2019re only 30 centimeters away.\u00a0Both of them were within Seo Jun-ho\u2019s range. If he made a surprise attack, he could cut their heads off with a single stroke.But\u2026 I don\u2019t have a good pretext to do that.He knew that they were fiends, and he\u2019d gotten that information from reading another fiend\u2019s memories. But if he killed them, he would have no way to prove that.The best-case scenario would be for them to reveal that they\u2019re fiends themselves\u2026\u00a0But that was impossible. They weren\u2019t amateurs; they wouldn\u2019t reveal themselves in a place with lots of players.Then the only thing I can do is to make my own playing field.\u00a0Luckily, they didn\u2019t know that he knew who they were. Seo Jun-ho calmed himself as he turned to Gong Juha and laughed.\u201cIsn\u2019t this fun? I\u2019ll play a few more rounds.\u201d\u201cGeez, gambling is a scary thing\u2026\u201d Even as she expressed her concerns about gambling addiction, Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t let his attention on the Watchdogs waver.\u201cShall I start?\u201d The two Watchdogs nodded as they pushed forward ten chips each. At that, Seo Jun-ho pushed all twenty of his chips forward.\u201cPlease begin.\u201d\u201cSince there are three people this time, I\u2019ll be using five cups.\u201d The dealer began to elegantly shuffle the cups. As he got faster, it began to look like there were twenty.\u201cWow, that dealer is no joke.\u201d\u201cWho is he? With that level of skill, he was probably big.\u201d Even onlookers admired his beautiful skills.Tap, tap. Tap, tap, tap!The dealer finished shuffling and looked at the players, waiting for them to choose.\u201cThe far right.\u201d As soon as Seo Jun-ho answered, the delinquent woman and the skinny man followed.\u201cThe middle.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go with the far right.\u201dThe dealer flipped the cups. Seo Jun-ho and the skinny man were right.Gong Juha\u2019s eyes sparkled at his forty chips.\u201cWow. Mr. Snake head, you have a talent for this. How are you so good?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho trailed off as he reminisced.\u00a0Green taught me.One of the Five Heroes, Gilbert Green. Seo Jun-ho\u2019d been curious while Green was teaching him marksmanship, and asked how he dealt with an enemy that made good feints or an enemy who moved faster than his eyes could follow. Green had said only one thing:\u2018Watch the substance, not the shell.\u2019His advice had helped immensely. It still did.If you look at their stats, Gong Juha\u2019s are probably higher than the dealer\u2019s. But there\u2019s a reason she can\u2019t win despite that.She only watched the shell, or in this case, the cup. On the other hand, Seo Jun-ho was able to tell which cup the ball was under right away.The dealer\u2019s ability has nothing to do with speed.\u00a0The afterimages from his movements weren\u2019t from how fast he was moving. The answer was \u2018illusions\u2019. They were illusions that the dealer was creating.If you watch his shoulders, wrists, and the cups at the same time, it\u2019s obvious that something\u2019s off.\u00a0The dealer would use the illusory skill after he started shuffling and change the cup the ball was under. It really was something of a scam. But if you could see through the trick, it wasn\u2019t hard to guess the answer.You just have to watch his shoulders. The way his muscles move are telling.\u00a0It was easy. You just needed to watch his shoulder muscles and count how many times his arms moved, how they moved, and in which direction. If he just told Gong Juha the basics, she wouldn\u2019t lose a single time.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when we\u2019re done.\u201d Seo Jun-ho organized his chips and looked at the skinny man next to him.Did he guess it by chance?\u00a0To check that, he played the game three more times. The delinquent woman didn\u2019t win a single time, but the skinny man and Seo Jun-ho won all of them.He\u2019s not just copying my answer.\u00a0In two of the games, the man had answered before him. That meant he\u2019d figured out the trick.That man\u2026 he\u2019ll be harder to deal with than the woman.\u00a0If possible, he wanted to take one of them out tonight. It was important to evaluate their skills before the battle.As he finished his thought, the dealer got up and spoke sadly.\u201cPlease wait a moment. There will be a dealer change.\u201dSeo Jun-ho had won all four of his bets. On top of that, they were all all-in. His 1 million won had quickly become 16 million.(TN: ~10k USD -> ~160k USD)The loss was too great, so the casino had decided to change the dealer.\u201cA-amazing. You made 16 million in five minutes\u2026\u201d Gong Juha looked at him in envy. It wasn\u2019t the money she was jealous of, but purely his game skill.Perfect timing.\u201cThe dealer\u2019s gone, so let me show you something interesting,\u201d he said loudly. He reached into his jacket and fumbled around the inner pocket. Of course, there was nothing in it. But when he pulled his hand out, he was holding an ice compass. He\u2019d used his Frost skill in that short amount of time.\u201cWow, that\u2019s pretty.\u201d Gong Juha\u2019s eyes sparkled as she studied it. The two fiends next to them were also secretly interested. Seo Jun-ho smiled faintly.\u201cPresident Shim Deok-gu lent me this. It\u2019s quite an interesting artifact.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an artifact? Now that you say that, I feel like I sense magic from it\u2026\u201d Of course she did. It was made of magic.\u201cIf you use magic on this compass, it helps you find certain people.\u201d\u201cCertain people?\u201d\u201cHaha, well, there\u2019s no reason that they would be here, but\u2026\u201d As he spoke, he poured magic into the compass, and the needle started to spin violently. When it finally stopped, Seo Jun-ho looked up to where it was pointing.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d Gong Juha had been staring at the needle, and she blinked. It was pointing at the two people next to Seo Jun-ho.\u201cUhm,\u00a0Mr. Snake head. The needle\u2019s pointing at them.\u201d Seo Jun-ho feigned a shocked expression and pretended to hide it.\u201cOh, why\u2026 why is it doing that?\u201d He swallowed, his face unreadable. \u201cTeam Leader, my stomach hurts, so I\u2019m gonna go to the bathroom\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, go ahead.\u201d As Seo Jun-ho got up and waved to Gong Juha, so did the skinny man.\u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom too.\u201d\u201cWill it take long?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be back in five minutes,\u201d he replied with a firm voice.Seo Jun-ho did not go to the bathroom. He ran out of the hotel as if he was being chased, and hid inside a back alley.Blink, blink.\u00a0It was a dark alleyway, with the only light coming from a streetlamp that would blink occasionally.\u201cHuff, huff\u2026\u201d\u00a0To anyone else, it would seem like Seo Jun-ho was hyperventilating. The skinny man who had been following him stepped casually into the alleyway.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is the bathroom.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho stared at him wordlessly. The man smiled as he spoke.\u201cYour luck is really bad. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d At least, that\u2019s what he thought.\u00a0An ice compass. It\u2019s probably a tool to find fiends.\u00a0He\u2019d never imagined that such an artifact would exist. If the needle hadn\u2019t pointed exactly at him and the delinquent woman, he wouldn\u2019t have known what it was.No one can know who we are for tomorrow\u2019s attack.\u00a0That\u2019s why he\u2019d come.His bones were visible in his hands as he gripped a sword.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you painlessly.\u201dBefore he could attack, Seo Jun-ho looked down at the ice compass in his hand. It had started to melt, and he tossed it aside without a second thought. As the skinny man watched it shatter on the ground, his forehead wrinkled.It broke? An artifact broke so easily?\u00a0Artifacts had magic in them and were highly durable. Even if it was weak, it wouldn\u2019t break from simply falling to the ground. The look in his eyes changed.\u201cIt\u2019s fake\u2026 In other words, this is a trap.\u201d\u201cI already thought so while playing, but you catch on quick.\u201dAs Seo Jun-ho unsheathed his sword with a\u00a0shing,\u00a0the fear on his face disappeared. He now looked like a hunter contemplating his prey.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cNo comment.\u201d\u201cIs there anyone else who knows who we are?\u201d\u201cNo comment.\u201d\u201c\u2026How much do you know?\u201d That was a question worth answering. It would keep him from running away. Seo Jun-ho gave a lopsided smile.\u201cHm,\u00a0well, I know your schedule for tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Someone who knew that wouldn\u2019t be able to live. The skinny man swung his sword without warning.Woooosh!\u00a0The sword pierced through the air, aimed at Seo Jun-ho\u2019s neck.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d Seo Jun-ho barely managed to dodge. His face fell as he touched his neck.\u201cYou dodged? Not bad.\u201dHe did his best to dodge, but the skinny man was relentless. They were thinking the same thing.\u2026He\u2019s fast.Seo Jun-ho\u2019s Speed stat was over 60, but it was hard for him to keep up.But it\u2019s not just a difference in stats.\u00a0Even if the skinny man\u2019s Speed stat was over 80, he wouldn\u2019t be so fast. That left one option.Skill.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho stared at his opponent with a hard look in his eyes, and the man tilted his sword.\u201cSo you\u2019ve figured it out. I\u2019m an acceleration skill user, and I have three levels. That was the first one\u2026\u201d He readied his stance again. \u201cAnd this one will be the third level.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why are you telling me that?\u201d\u201cI evaluated you with the first attack. You won\u2019t be able to block this one even if you know it\u2019s coming.\u201dHe realized.\u00a0He was correct. It would be impossible for Seo Jun-ho as he was now to keep up with the man\u2019s speed. Not only that, his opponent\u2019s eyes were starting to turn red.\u00a0He\u2019s going to use Demonic energy on top of his acceleration.\u00a0The skinny man was planning to kill him with the next attack.\u201cDammit.\u201d Seo Jun-ho clicked his tongue.He catches on quickly, and he\u2019s cautious. But once he decides to do something, he doesn\u2019t back out.\u00a0He\u2019d figured that out after watching the skinny man at the casino and in the alley.There\u2019s no use in dragging this out. Everything will end in the next strike.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes were cold. Each member of the Watchdogs was stronger than he was. If his concentration faltered at all, his head would go flying.\u201c\u2026Phew.\u201d Seo Jun-ho changed his mind. He took his stance and slowly closed his eyes. He no longer needed his sight for this battle.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to follow me with your eyes, so you\u2019ll just close them\u2026 Not a bad choice.\u201d The skinny man stared at his opponent and lowered his stance. He planned to cut through Seo Jun-ho\u2019s windpipe with this attack.\u00a0Let\u2019s see, the best place to aim\u2026Out of all the pressure points on a human body, the best places to kill with a sword were the head and heart. He checked Seo Jun-ho\u2019s stance, and the skinny man\u2019s eyes flashed.There are a lot of openings around his head. I can slice through his neck with a single stroke.\u00a0He made his decision.\u00a0I\u2019ll go with the heart.It was a cautious decision out of the one-in-a-thousand chance that Seo Jun-ho had intentionally made the opening. On the off chance that was true, he wouldn\u2019t put himself in danger.\u201cGoodbye.\u201d With that, the man leapt off the ground.Tap. Wooooshh!At the sound of his footsteps, darkness seemed to explode from the void and covered the alleyway. It blocked the man\u2019s vision, filling his sight with darkness.\u201cGuh?!\u201d He was surprised by the unexpected situation, but he didn\u2019t stop.\u00a0A smokescreen won\u2019t change anything.\u00a0He knew where the heart was. Even if his opponent tried to dodge, he wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with his speed.I just need to stab the target with my sword.\u00a0He didn\u2019t hesitate, and his sword didn\u2019t waver. The skinny man accelerated and swung.A terrifying sound was heard as his sword buried itself into Seo Jun-ho\u2019s chest.As expected.\u00a0A corner of his lip curled up. As expected, his sword had been faster.But there was something he\u2019d overlooked.Crackle!Seo Jun-ho never intended to dodge. He knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to.\u201cI said this before, but you\u2019re too careful.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe skinny man\u2019s caution had been his downfall. Especially because his opponent had been someone like Seo Jun-ho who knew how to engage in psychological warfare.Crackle? That\u2019s not the sound a sword makes when it hits flesh\u2026?Realizing that something was wrong, the skinny man quickly dropped his sword and drew back. But Seo Jun-ho wasn\u2019t so careless.\u201cKuh?!\u201dThe man finally realized that his hand and sword were frozen in ice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All he felt at his fingertips was a cold sensation.Where did it go wrong?\u00a0It was a fight he shouldn\u2019t have been able to lose. His opponent was a rookie who couldn\u2019t even keep up with his speed, and the skinny man was a seasoned veteran.The unlucky one\u2026 It wasn\u2019t him, but me.\u00a0He thought that he was dying simply because his opponent\u2019s luck was good.\u201cBut that luck\u2026\u00a0cough,\u00a0in front of the boss\u2026\u201d The skinny man used the last of his strength to grip his opponent\u2019s throat. His face looked like an evil spirit as he spat out a final curse. \u201cThe boss\u2026 will send you to hell.\u201d\u201cWhy would I go there? That\u2019s a place reserved for bastards like you.\u201d Seo Jun-ho felt offended and twisted the sword once.\u201cGuh\u2026 ack\u2026!\u201dThe life faded from the man\u2019s eyes as he vomited blood and went limp. Even then, his red eyes didn\u2019t fade.\u201cAnyways, you dirty fiend bastard.\u201d Seo Jun-ho placed his hand on the skinny man\u2019s forehead and muttered to himself. \u201cJust hand over the information.\u201d* * *A skyscraper hotel looked down at the night in Las Vegas. The man and woman sitting on the couch looking down at the city hadn\u2019t said anything for hours.Tick!\u00a0The clock on the wall pointed to four.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t want to admit it, but that bag of bones is better than me at strategy.\u201d The first one to speak was the delinquent woman from the Watchdogs. Her boss, Arma, was sitting next to her with his eyes closed.\u201cHe said he\u2019d come back in five minutes, but it\u2019s been eight hours now.\u201dThe skinny man always thought of his team first. He\u2019d never gone this long without contact before. They\u2019d gradually realized what this meant.\u201c\u2026He was taken out.\u201d He was probably not a person of this world anymore. The woman\u2019s voice broke as hot tears spilled over. They were always bickering, but they\u2019d been teammates for years now. \u201cFucking idiot. He said he\u2019d be right back.\u201d\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d\u201cHe was an Asian male. He spoke in Korean and was with Gong Juha, so it\u2019s likely that he\u2019s a member of the Dokkaebi Guild.\u201dArma didn\u2019t say anything as he tapped on his Vita. Thousands of holographic profiles appeared before him.\u201cThis is the list of all the Korean players in the Las Vegas area right now. See if he\u2019s here.\u201d\u201cJust a moment.\u201d The delinquent woman quickly scrolled through the profiles. Her eyes moved without a second to rest, but she wasn\u2019t just skimming them. After she looked through the thousands of profiles, the girl was about to say that he wasn\u2019t on the list.\u201cHuh?\u201dBut she found the face she was looking for on the last page.\u201cTh-this fucker!\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you sure?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure! I only saw him a few hours ago. There\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t recognize him.\u201d Arma tilted his head after hearing her confidence. The profile she\u2019d pointed at was none other than Seo Jun-ho\u2019s.He\u2019d been added to the Fiend Association\u2019s most recent database.But he\u2019s a new player that debuted barely two months ago.\u00a0Arma didn\u2019t think it made logical sense for one of his subordinates to be killed by Seo Jun-ho. But as he looked through the details of his profile, Arma slowly started to suspect him.\u201cThere\u2019s something strange about this man. He was involved with the Shadow Brothers.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re right! He\u2019s the guy that went into an Uncleared Gate with them.\u201dThe Shadow Brothers hadn\u2019t returned, but this man had gone in with them. And now, this.\u201cFrom this moment on, I\u2019m designating Seo Jun-ho as a threat.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The delinquent woman ground her teeth as she received the order. \u201cTry and get me. I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dThe MGM Grand Garden Arena was usually full of excitement for the greatest matches, but today, it was silent.It\u2019s not even a movie theater or anything.A long red carpet was spread at the entrance, where actors, directors, celebrities, and players all over the world were gathering.Bees gathered where there were flowers. Reporters from every country were absorbed in their cameras, clicking the shutter buttons.Beep\u2014 Beep\u2014Before they stepped onto the red carpet, each person had to go through a thorough inspection that was reminiscent of airport security checkpoints. Seo Jun-ho was no different.\u201cExcuse me.\u201d A member of the Dokkaebi Guild stopped him and held out his hand. \u201cCan I see your invitation?\u201dSeo Jun-ho reached into his jacket and pulled out his invitation. The security guard\u2019s eyes went wide as he opened the envelope and checked its contents. He immediately moved aside and bowed deeply.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for wasting your time.\u201d\u201cHuh? I don\u2019t have to go through security?\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked around at the other people, and the guard nodded.\u201cYes. You can go in right away.\u201dDid Gong Juha say something?\u00a0Seo Jun-ho tilted his head at the guard\u2019s polite manner and stepped onto the red carpet. The luxury suit, watch, and shoes that Shim Deok-gu had sent him garnered the attention of the reporters.\u201cHuh? Who\u2019s that man?\u201d\u201cIs he a celebrity? He\u2019s handsome.\u201d\u201cHis proportions are good and he\u2019s slim. He kind of looks like a model.\u201dThe male reporters couldn\u2019t hide their envy at his suit and shoes, and the female reporters couldn\u2019t hide their interest in his handsome face and proportionate body. Seo Jun-ho entered the arena with the eyes of the audience following him. The first thing that caught his eye was a bar.I do need a drink.\u00a0The auction would start tonight and go until dawn. Seo Jun-ho walked over to buy a bottle of water.\u201cIced tea with lots of ice. Twenty, please.\u201dSeo Jun-ho blinked as he recognized the girl in front of him. It was Gong Juha, and today, she was wearing a black suit with her hair in a ponytail.\u201cSo, we meet again.\u201d\u201cUghh, it\u2019s so hot\u2026 Huh?\u201d Gong Juha looked over at him as she flapped her shirt. As she realized who it was, she crossed her arms. \u201cWow, who\u2019s this? Isn\u2019t this the guy who went to the bathroom and never came back?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201d Now that he thought about it, he\u00a0had\u00a0done that. \u201cDid you wait for me?\u201d\u201cAre you really asking that right now? I mean, if you start saying something, you have to finish it. I was so curious about the ice compass that I waited for two hours! And if I get curious about something, I can\u2019t sleep. Do you see these dark circles under my eyes?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He really did have nothing to say for himself. Seo Jun-ho quickly bowed his head. Gong Juha read the apology written on his face and sighed as she uncrossed her arms.\u201cWhat\u2019s with that? You apologized right away, so I can\u2019t even be mad.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll buy you something good next time.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll choose something expensive, then.\u201d Gong Juha\u2019s face softened as she checked the time. She picked up the icebox on the ground. \u201cHup.\u201d\u201cTeam Leader Gong, what\u2019s\u2026?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s just a normal icebox. I keep ice cream and drinks in here.\u201d She looked toward the entrance of the hall as if it were a strong boss monster. \u201cMr. Snake head, you should also prepare yourself. It\u2019s going to be a long battle.\u201d\u201cYou really do get hot easily.\u201d\u201cVery. I think it\u2019s worse because Las Vegas is in the desert.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t you have some sort of heat resistance because you\u2019re a flame-user?\u201d\u201cExactly! Frustratingly enough, my body generates a lot of heat, so I\u2019m hot all the time.\u201d Gong Juha finished and picked up the icebox. She nodded instead of waving with her hand. \u201cHave fun at the auction. It would be nice if we could sit close to each other, but I\u2019m at the front for security reasons.\u201d\u201cYes. Then, Team Leader Gong\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho spoke sincerely. \u201cI hope you also have a good time.\u201d* * *\u201cMmmmm.\u00a0The icebox~ is my treasure box~\u201d Gong Juha hummed to herself as she sat in her seat. She placed the icebox in front of her. It would help her weather the heat for the next few hours; it really was her treasure box.\u201cWow, it\u2019s so close,\u201d Gong Juha said in admiration. Since her seat was at the very front row, the stage was right below her nose. It was reserved for VIPs, but she was the captain of the security team.If I\u2019m this close, I can help right away if something happens.\u00a0As she glanced around, she recognized all of the people near her.\u00a0The Vice President of America\u2026 The President of the French Player Association\u2026 Even the Queen of England is here?They were all people that had influence over the globe. No matter how the world changed, the powers at the top remained the same.\u201cIs this my seat?\u201d Gong Juha turned to greet the person next to her.\u201cHuh?\u201d Her eyes went wide. \u201cMr. Snake head?\u201dThe person sitting next to her was none other than Seo Jun-ho. Gong Juha quickly looked around and looked at him nervously.\u201cUhm\u2026\u00a0you know, these seats are all preassigned, so you can\u2019t just sit anywhere.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this seat A-13? It was written on my invitation.\u201d\u201cHuh? Can I see your invitation?\u201d Seo Jun-ho casually handed it over, and Gong Juha\u2019s jaw dropped.Wh-what? A VIP ticket? Even I didn\u2019t get one\u2026?\u00a0Even though she was a famous ranker, she was simply a Team Leader, not a Guildmaster or a Vice-Guildmaster. She\u2019d only been able to receive a premium ticket, a rank below his.Wait. Now that I look at him\u2026\u00a0Gong Juha quickly scanned Seo Jun-ho. His childish, messy haircut had been styled by the hands of a professional. And with just a glance, she could tell that his clothes and shoes cost at least tens of millions of won. She\u2019d thought he\u2019d looked strangely good today and realized it was thanks to the clothes.(TN: Hundreds of thousands of USD.)He only debuted two months ago, but he\u2019s wearing all that\u2026\u00a0A thought quickly came to her.\u201cDid you\u2026 spend all the money you earned at the casino yesterday?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cUhm, well, your outfit looks really expensive.\u201d\u201cOh, this?\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked down at his clothes and grinned. \u201cNo. The clothes and watch are from the Association President. He gave me the invitation too.\u201d\u201cAhh~\u00a0I see.\u201d The misunderstanding was cleared up, but she was even more impressed. \u201cYou must have his full confidence. I didn\u2019t know that President Shim Deok-gu had appointed you as his new heir.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh? Heir?\u201d Seo Jun-ho blinked, but Gong Juha grinned.\u201cYou really didn\u2019t know? This isn\u2019t just a normal auction seat. Only powerful people like big-name Guildmasters can receive a VIP invitation. Other people can\u2019t even come up here\u2026 The fact that President Shim Deok-gu easily gave you that invitation means that you\u2019re his proxy. Therefore, he thinks of you as an heir of sorts.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh my god.\u201d He finally realized what Deok-gu had been telling him. Seo Jun-ho had wondered why Deok-gu said he needed to protect his image at the auction, but he didn\u2019t know that this was the meaning behind it.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe Korean Player Association hasn\u2019t had a leading player in a long time.\u201d The smile reached Gong Juha\u2019s eyes as she looked at him. \u201cIt seems that the Association President wants to leave his role to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s a big responsibility.\u201d He turned to argue with her when the lights turned off.\u201cOh, it\u2019s starting.\u201dThe Auction. The biggest auction in the world was starting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The emcee of the global auction was the famous Donny Lochifield. He was famous for being a pleasant, cheerful host, but today, his face was serious.\u201cEven a person as famous as him is nervous.\u201d\u201cWell, think about where he stands.\u201dToday\u2019s auction wasn\u2019t some talk show. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that all the most powerful people in the world were gathered here. People on the internet were even calling it a global summit.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I am your host for tonight, Donny Lochifield.\u201d He looked a bit nervous, but he was a professional. \u201cFirst, I\u2019ll explain how the auction will work. If you look at your seats, there will be a small remote.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s this.\u201d Gong Juha picked up a remote from her large, comfortable seat.\u201cBidding is simple. Simply press the green button and enter your desired bid.\u201d It was an easy system even for those who\u2019d never been to an auction. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re all excited, so I won\u2019t keep you waiting. We will now begin the auction. The first item is the sword of the Lion King, Richard\u2026\u201dAs the item was brought onto the stage, it was projected onto a large hologram screen.\u201cMr. Snake head, is there anything you want to get today?\u201d\u201cNot really. How about you?\u201d\u201cWell, me too\u2026 I\u2019m not here as a bidder.\u201d Gong Juha looked down at her security armband. She sat up straighter. \u201cI\u2019m a professional, so I have to do my job properly.\u201dI don\u2019t think you can say that when you were gambling during working hours\u2026\u00a0Seo Jun-ho replied half-heartedly, getting lost in his thoughts. Last night, he\u2019d seen the memories of a Watchdog in a dark alley and realized.I can\u2019t defeat Arma alone.\u00a0He was impossibly powerful. Seo Jun-ho had thought he would be able to handle him alone, but that was a big miscalculation.Arma was the third disciple of the King of Corpses, Nazad Hallow of the Nine Heavens.He wouldn\u2019t have any problems if he went to the 2nd floor right now. That\u2019s how strong he is.It was because he was a summoner. Summoners\u2019 own levels didn\u2019t matter as much as those of what they summoned.Thankfully, I know what he summons because of the memories I saw last night\u2026\u00a0But it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to take him alone. Seo Jun-ho realized he needed backup.\u00a0And the only one who could help me\u2026Seo Jun-ho turned to look at Gong Juha, who was sipping on her iced tea and watching the auction.\u2026is Gong Juha.\u00a0She was strong enough to defeat Arma. On top of that, she was part of the official security of the auction and could understand Seo Jun-ho. He looked down at the catalogue he was holding.Five hours until Heaven\u2019s Breath comes onto the stage.\u00a0The Watchdogs\u2019 operation would begin then.The auction proceeded for five hours without any problems. Seo Jun-ho was starting to get nervous.\u201cNumber 203, congratulations. You have won the Ice Crown.\u201d\u201cWho the hell is number 203?\u201d\u201cThey keep sweeping away all the Cold attribute items.\u201d As the other bidders complained, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face was stoic. Obviously, he wasn\u2019t number 203. He didn\u2019t have any reason to spend tens of millions of won to buy ice-affiliated artifacts.(TN: Because he already got them for cheaper.)\u201cWow, this is fun, this is fun~\u201d Number 203 was the innocent lady sitting next to him. She smiled brightly as she pressed on her remote. Including the item she\u2019d just won, she\u2019d successfully bid on eight artifacts. They were all items that helped with cooling the heat.\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you say that you were a professional?\u201d He struck at a sore spot.\u201cW-well, a real professional\u2026 Yeah! A real professional has to know how to multitask.\u201dIt seemed that the requirements for being a professional kept increasing. She cleared her throat, as if embarrassed, and turned to look at Seo Jun-ho.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to buy anything?\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s something I like, then sure.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t care much about gear?\u201d\u201c\u2026I do.\u201d He cared a lot, but he also had unreasonably high standards.\u00a0There\u2019s nothing that I like.\u00a0He\u2019d used the best equipment in the past, so most artifacts wouldn\u2019t catch his eye. The only thing he\u2019d obtained so far was a necklace that prevented one from getting sick frequently. When he\u2019d won it, Gong Juha had gotten curious.\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Is it for your girlfriend?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t you ask if I have a girlfriend first?\u201d\u201cOh, sorry\u2026 For your mother, then?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a mother either.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll shut up.\u201d Gong Juha\u2019s face went white as she turned away.\u201cThis next item has a long story attached to it. Number 84 on the catalogue, the Unknown Ball.\u201d\u201cUnknown Ball\u2026?\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s attention turned back to the auction. It was a small ball the size of two fists, occasionally emanating light. Donny continued his story.\u201cTwenty years ago, this ball was given as a reward for clearing the 2nd floor. But to this day, no one has figured out what it is. No item window pops up either. Thinking that it has some incredible hidden power, many people have bought it, but no one has ever been able to figure it out. Its current owner is Count Charlie of England, who intends to sell it. Bidding will start at 50,000 dollars.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s that ball again.\u201d\u201cThe auction has been here for twenty years, but no item comes in as frequently as that ball.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s resold so often.\u201d\u201cWill someone even buy it? People who know about it wouldn\u2019t.\u201dSeo Jun-ho listened to the murmurs of the audience with one ear, but his eyes were concentrated on the ball.\u2026I have to buy it.\u00a0He didn\u2019t have a solid basis. It wasn\u2019t rare for him to get this feeling. But whenever he felt a hunch like this, he left his decisions to his intuition\u2014it was always right.\u00a0It\u2019s Keen Intuition.As Seo Jun-ho raised his remote, Gong Juha blinked.\u201cAre you\u2026 planning to buy the ball?\u201d\u201cYes. I felt a pull.\u201d He ignored the confusion on Gong Juha\u2019s face and pressed the button on his remote.\u201cNumber 173, going for 52,000 dollars.\u201d\u201cNumber 89, going for 55,000 dollars.\u201d\u201cNumber 114, going for 57,000\u2026\u201dThere were inevitably a few people that were curious among the hundreds of participants. As the race ended, Seo Jun-ho won the mysterious ball for 150,000 dollars.I\u2019m excited.\u00a0Just what about the ball set off the hunch?The next item was brought onto the stage.\u201c\u2026A lot of you came to Las Vegas to see this very item.\u201d Donny gave a knowing smile, and the audience sat up straighter.\u201cIt\u2019s finally coming out.\u201d\u201cNumber 85. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t even sleep because I wanted to see it.\u201d All around the auction hall, people were swallowing in anticipation. Donny gave an elegant wave of his hand and introduced the item.\u201cDiscovered in an ancient dungeon on the 2nd floor; this is the top-grade magic core, Heaven\u2019s Breath.\u201dDozens of spotlights turned on, shining down on the gem. The audience erupted.\u201cOhh,\u00a0that\u2026\u201d\u201cHeaven\u2019s Breath!\u201d\u201cThey say it\u2019s as beautiful as if it were crafted by God himself.\u201dMost magic cores were spherical gems. Even the Frost Queen\u2019s core looked like a round sapphire. Heaven\u2019s Breath was in the same shape, sparkling white and gold.\u201cWow, it\u2019s really pretty.\u201d It was aesthetically pleasing, but also reminded one of the sky. Sure, it was pretty, but there were other parts to admire.\u2026It has an overwhelming amount of magic.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho now understood why there were rumors that it could single-handedly power a city. That huge amount of magic was packed into a small core.\u201cTeam Leader Gong, who discovered the core?\u201d\u201cOne of the Big 6 Guilds, Labyrinth, got it from an ancient dungeon in the Frontier called \u2018Tomb of Mercy\u2019. They put their lives on the line to clear the dungeon\u2026 It was a high-risk-high-reward raid, but they succeeded. They said they\u2019re selling the core to make up for the losses.\u201d\u201cHow much do you think it\u2019ll go for?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u00a0Well, that will depend on what\u2019s called, but in my opinion\u2026\u201d Gong Juha looked around and leaned in close. \u201cIt\u2019ll go up to the trillions. These days, people prefer to use magic instead of gas or electricity. The people in the VIP seats are probably bidding with their country\u2019s budgets,\u201d she whispered.\u201c\u2026Jesus Christ.\u201d Seo Jun-ho glanced around, noticing something that the world leaders didn\u2019t. He quickly pulled himself together.Heaven\u2019s Breath has come out, so it\u2019ll begin soon.\u00a0The Watchdogs would begin moving.\u201cThe magic core crafted by God! Bidding for Heaven\u2019s Breath starts at 1 million dollars!\u201dBeep\u2014 Beep\u2014The hologram screen displayed the bids in real time. Perhaps to shake off normal bidders, the bid quickly reached 50 million. The audience held their breath in anticipation of who would win.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d Gong Juha sensed something and wrinkled her forehead as she looked up. Seo Jun-ho noticed a beat later and stared up at the ceiling.They\u2019re here.Craaaash!The ceiling broke in with a loud roar, but no one in the audience was harmed.There\u2019s a reason why he\u2019s called the Guardian Knight.Ranker Ha Inho. In an instant, he\u2019d created a magic shield that covered the entire audience.\u201cWho the hell\u2026! Wait, what\u2019s that?\u201d Gong Juha stood up abruptly and squinted at the things on top of the shield. \u201cSkeletons?\u201d Dozens of skeletons had broken through the ceiling.\u201cSkeletons\u2026 Is it the Skeleton Mage from the massacre in Turkey?\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered gravely.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSkeleton Mage? That\u2019s possible!\u201d Gong Juha\u2019s eyes shined as she hissed into her Vita.\u201cEvacuating the VIPs and the audience is our top priority! Recover the auction items after that. I\u2019m leaving the skeletons to Inho. Move!\u201dShe really was a pro. In an instant, she\u2019d become a charismatic commander on the battlefield. She turned to Seo Jun-ho.\u201cMr. Snake head. If possible, can you lend us your\u2026 Huh?\u201d Gong Juha tilted her head.Seo Jun-ho had been sitting next to her up until a moment ago, but he\u2019d disappeared like a ghost.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Stay in\u2014I said stay in line!\u201d The members of the Dokkaebi Guild tried to calm the panicking crowd, but it was useless.Clang! Clang!\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cW-won\u2019t it break?\u201d\u201cLet me get out! Get out of the way!\u201d\u201cHuh? Stop pushing! Do you know who I am?\u201dIf you looked up just a little bit, you could see the skeleton soldiers fiercely attacking the shield. Consumed by terror, everyone ignored the orders to stay in line and continued to push those in front of them.\u201cGeez, Vice Team Leader. The people won\u2019t listen to us, what should we do?\u201d\u201cShould we bend their ears instead?\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201dThe Vice Team Leader Ha Inho clicked his tongue at his teammates\u2019 words as he upheld the magic shield. He looked at the hundreds of people that were pushing each other at the entrance. They were holders of vice and honorary titles, or otherwise, extremely powerful.They say that those who have power fear death the most\u2026In the past, the first Qin emperor had sought an elixir for eternal life and filled his tomb with terracotta warriors. Ha Inho couldn\u2019t think of a solution and sighed.Fwoooosh!As an intense heat spread out, a loud sound was heard from one side of the auction hall as a wall collapsed. The people regained their senses for a moment, turning toward the noise.\u201cIt\u2019s gonna take forever to get everyone through those small doors! Come through here!\u201d Gong Juha shouted. She hadn\u2019t hesitated as she broke through the wall of a building that costed tens of millions.\u201cGongju-nim, you can\u2019t just break it like that\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy not? It was a good decision. Nice, Gongju-nim!\u201d\u201cAlright everyone, see that over there? The exit is much wider and you can evacuate faster. Follow me!\u201dUnlike Ha Inho, who was embarrassed, the other team members gave the girl a thumbs-up. The audience started to flow out of the auction hall through the hole like an outgoing tide.\u201cThey\u2019re not even that strong\u2026\u201dClang! Clang, clang!In a short span of time, the number of skeletons banging on Ha Inho\u2019s shield had increased. More kept jumping down from the ceiling. As Ha Inho looked up at them, his eyes widened.There\u2019s at least 120 of them just by looking.\u00a0Just who was their enemy that they could carry out an attack of this scale?His eyes were still fixed above him, when he heard something suddenly pierced through the air toward him.\u201c\u2026What?!\u201d He twisted quickly, creating a shield around his body.Ping!A bullet from a sniper rifle pierced right through his shield with a splash of blood. And a second later, there was a sharp pain that overtook all his thoughts.\u201cGuh\u2014Ack!\u201d His concentration was broken, and the magic shield dissipated.Clack, clack!The skeleton soldiers fell to the floor of the auction hall.\u201cInho!\u201d As she heard her precious subordinate cry out in pain, Gong Juha bit the corner of her lip. It was a habit of hers when she got really mad.\u201cI was gonna stall for time until I could trace the Skeleton Mage\u2019s magic\u2026\u201dIt was too late. Dokkaebi\u2019s Gongju valued her subordinates fiercely, and she was furious.Fwoooosh!As if to represent her fury, flames bloomed around her. With her black suit and ponytail, the flames suited her perfectly.\u201cAlright.\u201d Gong Juha made a decision and waved her hand gently; the attack that it brought was anything but.The soft lighting inside the building suddenly became as bright as day. The fire pierced through the ceilings and shot toward the sky.Sizzle.That was all. In an instant that didn\u2019t seem to last even a second, the skeleton soldiers disintegrated into ashes.The unconscious Ha Inho and the stage that held Heaven\u2019s Breath didn\u2019t have a scratch on them. Gong Juha wiped the beads of sweat on her forehead.\u201c\u2026Man, it\u2019s hot,\u201d she muttered.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/sb2jqkv* * *The roof of the Mirage Hotel, 4 kilometers away from the Grand Garden Arena. The delinquent woman looked up as the pillar of fire dyed the sky red. She spoke to herself in awe.\u201c\u2026Insanity. Is that really the skill of a human? Is it CG? It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d She was far, far away, but cold sweat formed on her back.I heard that Gong Juha\u2019s skill was the strongest special attribute skill, Ruler of Flames (S), but\u2026\u00a0She\u2019d never imagined that it was on that level. What would happen if she fought with a monster at a close distance?The woman trembled. She didn\u2019t want to think about it.\u201cPhew,\u00a0it\u2019s a good thing that I\u2019m a sniper.\u201d She let out a sigh of relief and adjusted her goggles. Her vision expanded like a telescope.So that\u2019s Heaven\u2019s Breath.\u00a0Next to it was Ha Inho, who she\u2019d taken out. The one who\u2019d been protecting it was gone, so there was no more reason to hesitate.\u201cCome here, cutie.\u201d As she looked down at Heaven\u2019s Breath, she activated her skill.\u00a0Teleport.\u00a0She felt something heavy in her hand.\u201cWow, this is totally my style,\u201d she remarked, admiring the beautiful core. A call came from her boss.\u2013 \u201cThe item?\u201d\u201cWho do you think I am? I have it.\u201d\u2013 \u201cGood job. Come to Point B right away.\u201d\u201cOkay~\u201d She hung up and got ready to leave. She patted her rifle and made a wistful face. \u201c\u2026Tsk, I missed the Seo Jun-ho bastard.\u201d She\u2019d promised to shoot a bullet through his head if she saw him, but that guy was really lucky.\u201cBut if he ever comes to the 2nd floor, someday I\u2019ll\u2026 Huh?\u201dThe delinquent woman saw something and adjusted her goggles again.Whirrr.Her vision expanded, and she found the face she was looking for.\u201cSeo Jun-ho!\u201d Her exclamation was mixed with anger and excitement as she raised her sniper rifle again. \u201cI thought you were a lucky guy, but I take that back.\u201dHe was running down the street. She didn\u2019t know where he was headed, but he was running really fast.Tsk, rude bastard. If you\u2019re gonna run, you should run toward here.\u00a0She looked through her scope and aimed at Seo Jun-ho\u2019s forehead.\u201cI\u2019ll make your head explode painlessly with one hit.\u201d Her voice seethed with killing intent, and she pulled the trigger without a moment\u2019s hesitation.Boom!An explosive sound rang out on the hotel\u2019s roof. The bullet disappeared then reappeared in front of Seo Jun-ho\u2019s nose.\u201cUfufu, this isn\u2019t a bullet that should be used for a rookie who only debuted two months ago.\u201dThe reason why she acted as a sniper for the best corps, the Watchdogs. Her attacks were vicious, piercing through the victim\u2019s body before they could even hear the bullet ripping through the air.\u201cGo to hell\u2026 Huh?\u201d She checked for his corpse through the scope, and her eyes narrowed. She\u2019d been expecting Seo Jun-ho\u2019s corpse, but he was still running down the street. \u201cWhat? Did I mess up?!\u201dShe tilted her head, confused, and loaded her rifle one more time.\u00a0That\u2019s weird. I\u2019ve never messed up in the past three years\u2026\u00a0Her sniping success rate was 100%. She\u2019d never failed to defeat an opponent, and she wrote off her first mistake as a coincidence. That was her real mistake.If she was a seasoned sniper, she would\u2019ve left her spot the moment her bullet missed.\u201cI won\u2019t miss this time.\u201d She aimed carefully at Seo Jun-ho again. At some point, their distance had shrunk to a single kilometer.Die!\u00a0As she pulled the trigger, she used her Teleport skill once more. The bullet disappeared and once again reappeared right in front of Seo Jun-ho.\u00a0I did it properly this time. He can\u2019t dodge that.\u00a0She watched him, reassuring herself.Woosh!\u00a0He lowered his head and dodged the bullet.\u201cFuck! How is he doing that?!\u201d She\u2019d seen it with her own eyes. She yelled out. \u201cHe dodged?\u00a0My\u00a0bullet? Right in front of him? That easily?\u201d(TN: Right in front of my salad?)It was impossible. Even Ha Inho, who was called the Guardian Knight on the 2nd floor, had fallen to her attack.This is one of those attacks you can\u2019t block\u2026 You\u2019re telling me that newbie is better than Ha Inho?\u00a0It made no logical sense. But she\u2019d seen it with her own eyes, and it was hard to deny.As she comprehended this, the delinquent woman realized that she\u2019d been focused on the wrong thing.\u00a0Wait, now that I think about it\u2026?From the very beginning, Seo Jun-ho had been running toward the building she was on.\u201c\u2026Is he? Dammit!\u201d She cursed and quickly put her rifle into her inventory and reached for the Heaven\u2019s Breath on the ground.Crack!A sneakered foot pressed hard into her hand, crushing the bones.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d She couldn\u2019t even think to scream. From her crushed hand, her veins started to freeze throughout her body.\u201cHuff, huff\u2026 Phew.\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s shoulders heaved. He\u2019d run so quickly that his body was radiating heat. \u201c\u2026I thought I\u2019d miss you.\u201dHe\u2019d known about her Teleport skill from the skinny man\u2019s memories, so he\u2019d had no other choice but to chase her down before she could run away.Mm, covering this much distance is hard.Shadow Step. It used magic to transport the body through darkness and shade, similar to a magician\u2019s Blink skill. The only problem was that it consumed a ton of magic.\u201cIt was a little hard, but the results were good.\u201dShing.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho unsheathed his sword. Tonight, he would erase the Watchdogs from this world.* * *\u201cIt\u2019s hot\u2026 I said, it\u2019s hot!\u201dFwooooosh!Gong Juha shouted hysterically as she melted another crowd of skeletons. It wasn\u2019t hard to melt the endless amount of skeletons, but the sticky heat bothered her.\u201cUghh, Ant\u2026 Antarctica will be cool, won\u2019t it? Alright, when this is over, I\u2019m going on vacation to the King Sejong Station*.\u201d She looked like she was about to cry as more skeletons appeared. As she was thinking about how nice it would be to quickly go back to her room and take a cold shower, one of her subordinates dashed over.(TN: Korean research base in Antarctica.)\u201cGongju-nim!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency!\u201d The subordinate swallowed hard and looked toward the stage as they spoke. \u201cW-we can\u2019t find the Heaven\u2019s Breath!\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d Gong Juha\u2019s face fell as she confirmed this.\u201cDidn\u2019t the people in charge take it?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m sure of it. It disappeared amidst the chaos.\u201d\u201cBut I haven\u2019t let a single skeleton get to the stage\u2026?\u201d They stared at each other blankly. Then another subordinate screamed.\u201cGah!\u201d\u201cWh-what\u2019s with these guys! They\u2019re strong!\u201d Gong Juha\u2019s forehead wrinkled as she turned her head.\u201cHey! Stop exaggerating about the skele\u2026\u201d She trailed off. The Skeleton Mage had kept sending the same type of skeleton, but now he\u2019d sent a new one.\u201cBlack skeletons?\u201d There were six skeletons whose bones were completely black. On top of that, they all had different individual weapons.\u201cHuh? That\u2026\u201d The subordinate seemed to recognize them.\u201cWhat? Do you know the skeleton?\u201d\u201cNo, not that\u2026 but I know some of the gear they\u2019re wearing.\u201d\u201cAre they famous?\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you remember the incident three years ago that sent the 2nd floor into a frenzy?\u201d Gong Juha wracked her brain and responded without hesitation.\u201cThe Player Disappearance Case?\u201d\u201cYes. Players that were over level 110 disappeared without a trace. It was really shocking.\u201d\u201cGet to the point.\u201d At her urgency, her subordinate quickly summed it up.\u201cTheir gear matches the ones of the people who disappeared.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d Her eyes went wide and she looked again at the black skeletons. Her teammates averaged at level 75, but they weren\u2019t making a dent.\u2026No, the skeletons are actually winning.\u00a0A chill went down her spine.\u201cYou, do you know the missing players\u2019 skills or fighting styles?\u201d She asked her teammate.\u201cYes. I know them very well since I was in charge of the investigation back then.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Her subordinate understood what she meant and swallowed hard. They bowed their head.\u201cTheir skills and fighting styles are exactly the same as the ones who disappeared.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201dThat meant only one thing:The players had become undead.Webtoon: Chapters 32 \u2013 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was trying to organize his thoughts after seeing the delinquent woman\u2019s memories.She\u2019s no different from the bony guy.\u00a0Their knowledge was limited; they knew nothing about the Fiend Association.\u00a0They talked big about the Watchdogs, but in the end, these guys were expendable too.But it was too early to be disappointed. Their boss, Skeleton Mage Arma, was still left.If it\u2019s that bastard, he\u2019ll have some good info.\u00a0There was a simple reason why he thought so.\u00a0He\u2019s the disciple of the King of Corpses, Nazad Hallow of the Nine Heavens.Even the black skeletons attacking the auction hall were gifts from Nazad.\u201cWhat should I do now?\u201d Thanks to the memories, he knew where Arma was at the moment. \u2018Point B\u2019 was their room at the hotel they were staying at. \u201cIf I went there directly\u2026 I would be crazy.\u201dArma had set up layers and layers of magic traps. Seo Jun-ho\u2019s magic resistance wasn\u2019t strong enough; he would die the moment he stepped in.\u00a0Magicians.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho clicked his tongue, annoyed.Of course, he wasn\u2019t about to let Arma go like this.\u201cIf I can\u2019t go in, I should lure him out.\u201d He unlocked the Vita from the delinquent woman\u2019s wrist and sent a message to Arma.\u2013 Some weirdo\u2019s chasing me right now. It doesn\u2019t seem like Seo Jun-ho or someone from Dokkaebi.\u2013 The item?\u2013 I still have it. This bastard\u2019s persistent\u2026 I\u2019ll leave it in an alley next to the hotel. Find our symbol.Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t send a message asking Arma to help.\u00a0This girl\u2019s not the type to do that.\u00a0The skinny man was the same as her; they cared more about the team than their own safety. If he\u2019d sent such a message, Arma would immediately be suspicious.\u2013 Okay.As soon as he received the unsuspecting message, Seo Jun-ho tossed the Vita to the ground.\u201cClean it up.\u201dCrunch, crunch!The sound of canine chewing resonated across the roof.* * *\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The hotel room was dark. Not a single light was on. Arma waved his hand and the hologram messaging app shut off. He looked down at the city, lost in thought.Just who is chasing her?\u00a0The only people he could think of were the Dokkaebi Guild and Seo Jun-ho. But when she\u2019d said it was neither of them, things only got more complicated.There\u2019s a third party that we didn\u2019t expect.He wasn\u2019t happy. Like most magicians, Arma preferred that all things fall within his expectations. He let out a light sigh and waved his hand again. The magic circles hidden around the room disappeared like smoke. He also erased his own traces of magic before leaving the hotel. He looked around the nearby building until he found a familiar symbol. It was a tiny mark that wouldn\u2019t be visible to most.That way.\u00a0It was the unique symbol that the Watchdogs used. There weren\u2019t more than five people on both the 1st and 2nd floors who knew the symbol. Knowing this, Arma relaxed a bit.I can sense it.\u00a0The feeling got stronger as he entered the alley. A strong magic energy came from a trash can. A simple lid couldn\u2019t mask the strength of the top-grade magic core. Arma raised the lid and lifted the glistening gem.\u201cIt\u2019s like ice.\u201d It was his first time seeing Heaven\u2019s Breath in person. He tilted his head.\u00a0Were the rumors exaggerating? It\u2019s not as beautiful as I expected.\u00a0In fact, he felt that it was rough and unrefined. He narrowed his eyes.\u201cBut\u2026 why is a magic core so cold?\u201d Doubt was starting to form in his mind.Crackle!\u00a0Heaven\u2019s Breath\u2014no, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s \u2018ice bomb\u2019 exploded in his hand.\u201cKeuk?!\u201dEven a ranker\u2014no, even one of the Nine Heavens would have been startled by the surprise attack. Of course, Arma couldn\u2019t dodge it. He let out a painful groan and tried to make sense of the situation.My entire upper body is frozen all the way down my right arm.\u00a0That was all he could analyze. Arma quickly looked around the alleyway. He wasn\u2019t so stupid as to let his guard down since there was already an attack.They\u2019ll want to land a finishing blow since their ambush succeeded.\u00a0He didn\u2019t linger much on how his opponent might know the Watchdogs\u2019 symbol. Either his subordinate had betrayed him, or his opponent had a special skill.What\u2019s important is that the enemy is nearby.\u00a0And soon, he\u2019d have to fight for his life.\u00a0Where?Arma\u2019s eyes started to fade into red, and a wicked energy started to swell around him. His Demonic energy was overwhelming compared to the skinny man\u2019s and the delinquent girl\u2019s.They\u2019re not nearby. Are they watching from a distance?\u00a0He let out a sigh of relief. His opponent was cautious. Thankfully, that had saved Arma\u2019s life.Even I would have died if I was attacked immediately after the ambush\u2026\u00a0But it was a different story if he was given more time.\u201cArise,\u201d he ordered. Arma bit his lower lip. He\u2019d already used six of his best black skeletons to keep the monster Gong Juha busy.I don\u2019t want to waste any more fighting power if I can help it\u2026\u00a0But he had no other choice. He would have to go up to the 2nd floor in a shabbier state, but it was better than dying.Arma swung his left hand, and his summons quickly arose\u2014the air around them packed with Demonic energy. Even a sage from the Magic Tower in the Frontier would be impressed by his casting.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Seo Jun-ho also approved as he watched from the sidelines.\u201c\u2026\u2026?!\u201d Arma\u2019s eyes widened. Even a moment ago, he hadn\u2019t sensed a single trace of magic or presence.\u201cBut how\u2026 When\u2026?\u201d He was trying to ask how long the man had been standing behind him. A chill went through his blood, and goosebumps crawled down his back.The right side of his body was paralyzed. His left hand was casting a summon for his skeletons. In other words, he was completely defenseless.\u201cI just like to be sure.\u201d The Skeleton Mage was twice as strong as him and even had a sobriquet. Seo Jun-ho stabbed him from behind.\u201cGah!\u201d Blood spilled from Arma\u2019s mouth.Magicians were weakest when they were casting. Seo Jun-ho had been waiting for this moment from the beginning.\u201cKuh\u2026 urk.\u201d Arma\u2019s head slowly drooped. He could see the point of the sword that had pierced through his chest.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He wouldn\u2019t survive this without his personal healer or an elixir. And unfortunately for Arma, he had neither.A perfect\u2026 defeat.He was sorrowful. He was supposed to go up to the 2nd floor to meet his master and learn about his vision properly so they could take over the world. He hadn\u2019t even stepped on the black ground of the 2nd floor yet. But this is how it would end.A sorrowful tear slid down his face.\u201cYour\u2026 name\u2026?\u201d He at least wanted to know the name of the one who had killed him.Just who was it? Who had toppled his plans and destroyed the Watchdogs?Seo Jun-ho answered his question with a question.\u201cHave you ever carried out the final wishes of those you killed?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Arma thought for a second and sneered at himself.\u201c\u2026Do you think I have?\u201d\u201cSo why so persistent? I won\u2019t tell you, you bastard.\u201dSeo Jun-ho roughly drew his sword again.Splash!\u00a0Blood burst like a fountain, drenching the wall of the alleyway.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Skeleton Mage was an international terrorist who\u2019d massacred tens of thousands of citizens in Turkey to create his skeleton army. He\u2019d inspired fear in those around him, and now, he died in a cold alleyway.\u201cPhew.\u201d Seo Jun-ho let out a deep sigh. He was relieved that it had ended safely, but he also felt dirty. \u201cIt\u2019s not even my first time killing fiends\u2026\u201dNo matter how many times he saw the messages that popped up after killing them, he never got used to it.[You have leveled up.][You have leveled up.][All stats have increased by 2.]Defeating the three Watchdogs had raised his level by 2.

Still, they made for a good harvest. No country\u2019s government or Player Association knew anything about the fiends.\u201cGeez, they really are scum.\u201d The most shocking thing Seo Jun-ho had found in Arma\u2019s memories was the orphanage.They use orphans and train them into fiends\u2026\u00a0The Fiend Association was running an orphanage for that very sake. It went without saying that those who couldn\u2019t follow the harsh training were tossed aside. They weren\u2019t even considered humans.

But as Seo Jun-ho looked at it, he seemed amused.\u201cHow interesting.\u201d It was from a dungeon in the Frontier Area, the 2nd floor. \u201cNazad Hallow really seems to value his fiend disciples.\u201dThe ring\u2019s grade was Unique.Webtoon: Chapters 33 \u2013 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Simply wearing the ring would permanently raise all of his stats. Not only that, the effects were insanely good for summoners.It has an area limitation, but it buffs both the user and their summons.\u00a0It was a dream item for summoners.The only thing was that its stat requirements were high relative to the level requirement. But that wasn\u2019t a problem for him. All of his stats were already over 60. If he just raised his level by 3, he\u2019d be able to use this ring whenever he wanted.\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d Seo Jun-ho carefully placed the silver ring into his inventory. On the day he reaches level 25, this ring would sit on one of his ten fingers.\u201cThe rest of the items are whatever.\u201d Arma\u2019s items were mostly Rare or higher, but they were all specifically for magicians or summoners. Even though he could sell them on the Black Market, Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t really want to.I\u2019ll make a pretty penny, but it\u2019s not worth raising suspicions.\u00a0He looked down at Arma the way he\u2019d left him and started to erase his traces\u2014his fingerprints and footprints\u2014until he was satisfied.\u201cPerfect.\u201dI learned this from watching Skaya, but I didn\u2019t expect it to help in this way.\u00a0He\u2019d used magic to erase all traces of himself. Even someone with a psychometric skill wouldn\u2019t be able to trace him. It was invented by the Great Mage, after all.* * *The next morning, Gong Juha was staring at her subordinates with sunken eyes. The dark circles made her look like a panda.\u201cYou still\u2026 still haven\u2019t found it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We haven\u2019t.\u201d\u201cUghhhh.\u201d She sounded like she was about to cry. \u201cWhere in the world is the Skeleton Mage guy?\u201dAs her shoulders drooped, she remembered something from the night before. When she\u2019d been fighting the black skeletons with her teammates, they\u2019d suddenly crumbled to ashes.\u2018Wh-what? Are they dead?\u2019\u2018What happened?\u2019\u2018Get it together. They wouldn\u2019t die all of a sudden,\u2019\u00a0Gong Juha inferred over her teammates\u2019 confusion with a charismatic voice.\u2018So you\u2019re saying the Skeleton Mage recalled them on purpose.\u2019\u2018Exactly. His original goal was probably to take Heaven\u2019s Breath to a safe place.\u2019Gong Juha\u2019s face darkened. \u201cIf we\u2019d just fought a little longer, I could\u2019ve found his location\u2026\u201dEven during the fight, she\u2019d been analyzing the magic patterns on the skeletons\u2019 bodies. If she\u2019d had a little longer, she could\u2019ve found his location.The Skeleton Mage is an enemy, but he\u2019s really smart.\u00a0He\u2019d probably taken into account the time it would have taken her to trace him and cancelled his summons before then.He really was terrifying.\u201c\u2026What time is it?\u201d\u201c7 AM.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201d Gong Juha had sat on the sofa in the hotel lobby and waited, just in case the Skeleton Mage was discovered. She hadn\u2019t slept a wink as she\u2019d been on standby. For someone who loved to sleep in, it was the worst form of torture.\u201cGongju-nim.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u00a0What.\u201d She rubbed her eyes as Ha Inho called her. He stepped close and carefully took out a box.\u201cThey said someone left this for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026What, a fan?\u201d Gong Juha perked up despite her fatigue. She was a cute, globally-acclaimed ranker, which was rare. There were tons of people that liked her; her fan club already had thirty million members.\u201cWhy do they keep sending me things\u2026 I made an announcement on my cafe to not send me gifts unless it\u2019s a fan signing event or something.\u201d Even though she said that, she looked very happy. Ha Inho, on the other hand, looked serious.\u201cBut the contents\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026What? Is it something weird?\u201d She suddenly looked scared. One time, she\u2019d received the skin of a thousand-year-old snake, saying it was good for her skin. She occasionally received weird things from obsessive fans. She was unexpectedly squeamish whenever she received those things.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not anything gross. It\u2019s just surprising.\u201d\u201c\u2026What in the world is it?\u201d She tilted her head and opened the box. Inside was a large gem. \u201cHuh? This\u2026\u201dShe held up the gem and muttered to herself. \u201cWow, this is really well-made. It looks exactly the same as the Heaven\u2019s Breath we saw at the auction hall.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the real one. It was just appraised by an auction manager.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Gong Juha\u2019s eyes went wide in shock. \u201cIt\u2019s the real deal? Didn\u2019t the Skeleton Mage take it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s surprising about it.\u201d Ha Inho shrugged and held out a Post-it. \u201cThis was inside the box. Would you like a look?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Gong Juha read over the elegant English script that was written.\u2013 Dealt with the Skeleton Mage and two fiends. Retrieved Heaven\u2019s Breath. Skeleton Mage in the back alley of XX Hotel. From a fan that was passing by.\u201cOh my god,\u201d Her mouth twitched in surprise. \u201cM-my fan took care of everything?\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even do anything\u2026\u201d\u201cDoes it matter? It was taken care of. We won\u2019t have to pay for the damages either.\u201d Ha Inho let out a sigh of relief. \u201cIf we lost it, we would\u2019ve had to pay an enormous amount.\u201d\u201cMan, I\u2019m really grateful\u2026 Can you find out who sent this? I want to thank them in person.\u201d\u201cYou think I haven\u2019t tried? I checked all over the Skeleton Mage\u2019s corpse.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYour fan is quite amazing. They didn\u2019t leave a single trace. It\u2019s the work of a pro. They\u2019re at least a ranker, but I haven\u2019t the slightest idea who it is.\u201d\u201cAh, who could it be? I really want to know\u2026\u201d They put their heads together and started to name rankers, when a familiar person appeared before them.\u201cHuh? Hey!\u201d Gong Juha recognized him, blinking once as she called to him. \u201cHeyyy!\u201dGong Juha stomped across the floor just as Seo Jun-ho turned around. She looked up at him, and he had a refreshing smile.\u201cGood morning,\u201d he greeted cheerfully.\u201cGood morning?\u00a0Good morning~?\u201d\u00a0Gong Juha crossed her arms and narrowed her eyes. \u201cHow could you do that?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWow, so you\u2019re pretending you don\u2019t know now? You ran away yesterday!\u201d\u201cRan away? I\u2026?\u201d Seo Jun-ho tilted his head as he recalled the events of the night before.\u00a0Oh, she\u2026\u00a0He seemed to realize. He\u2019d moved as fast as he could so he wouldn\u2019t miss the Watchdogs, but to her, it seemed like he ran away.\u201cHey, didn\u2019t you run away last time too? When you said you were going to the bathroom? You\u2019re a habitual offender!\u201dWith the steam coming out of her ears, it was obvious how angry she was. She started nagging him as his sunbae.\u201cDidn\u2019t you watch\u00a0Spider-Man? \u2018With great power comes great responsibility\u2019! And Sir Specter said that too! Players\u2019 powers exist to protect the citizens.\u201d(TN: The suffix she uses is different and more respectful than \u2018-nim\u2019.)\u201c\u2026I did?\u201d\u201cWhat? Not you. Sir Specter said that.\u201d\u201cOh, Sir\u2026 Specter.\u201d He tried not to cringe and laughed awkwardly.\u00a0I said that?\u00a0He didn\u2019t even remember. Aside from what he said at intermissions, most of his interviews had been scripted.\u201cFrom now on, if something happens, help people get to safety instead of running away. Okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201d Gong Juha was satisfied after she finished her lecture. She seemed like the type to air things out quickly.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you adapt quickly. Oh, and have I told you?\u201d She was waving her Post-it, clearly wanting to brag.\u201cNo, you have not.\u201d\u201cWell, it just so happened that a fan of mine defeated the Skeleton Mage and the fiends and sent Heaven\u2019s Breath to me. Oh, I wonder who has such a talented fan\u2026 Wait, it\u2019s me!\u201d She looked very pleased. If she had a tail, it would be wagging around.\u201cInho said they\u2019re at least a ranker. I wonder who it is.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is it possible that they\u2019re not?\u201d\u201cNope, no way.\u201d Gong Juha shook her forefinger and smiled knowingly, as if Seo Jun-ho still had a lot left to learn. \u201cInho inspected the Skeleton Mage\u2019s corpse, but there wasn\u2019t the smallest trace left behind.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. Isn\u2019t it amazing? Inho\u2019s also a ranker, but he couldn\u2019t find a single clue\u2026 How amazing of a player must they be?\u201dNow it was Seo Jun-ho\u2019s turn to look pleased. He\u2019d cleaned up so well that even a ranker couldn\u2019t find him.\u201cHm,\u00a0and seeing how natural their English handwriting is\u2026 They\u2019re probably an American, right? Let me think of some.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is it necessary to seek them out? They\u2019ll reveal themself when they want to.\u201d\u201cR-right? It would be rude of me, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Gong Juha seemed embarrassed as she carefully put the Post-it into her inventory. \u201cSo what will you do now, Mr. Snake head? My work is done, so I\u2019m planning to go back to the 2nd floor as soon as I receive my items.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to linger now that the auction is over. I\u2019ll be going back to Korea.\u201d\u201cYou won the weird ball and the necklace yesterday, right?\u201d\u201cYes. I came here because they said I could receive my items here.\u201d\u201cYou can go to that desk over there.\u201d Gong Juha looked to the wall, looking a little disappointed. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that we have to part like this. I\u2019ll ask one more time: won\u2019t you respectfully join our guild?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll respectfully decline.\u201d\u201cTch,\u00a0that stings,\u201d Gong Juha sulked as she held out her right hand for a handshake. \u201cStay healthy until we meet again. Next time, it\u2019ll be on the 2nd floor.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be long.\u201d\u201cFufu,\u00a0that\u2019s what they all say. But the pressure starts to build as you level up.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\u201cWow, look at that confidence! Okay, if you come up to the 2nd floor within half a year, I\u2019ll give you a present.\u201d\u201cAnd if I can\u2019t?\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019ll grant my wish. Deal?\u201dHer wish was pretty obvious: she\u2019d tell him to join her guild.\u201cNo complaining later, alright?\u201d Of course, he\u2019d never grant her wish.

It opened with a clack, revealing a ball sitting on a soft cloth.Just what is it?\u00a0He still didn\u2019t know why he wanted this. But whenever Keen Intuition (B) reacted that strongly, there was always a good reason behind it.\u201cThere\u2019s no item window either.\u201d Seo Jun-ho studied it carefully before trying to use magic on it.Vrrrr.\u00a0It vibrated for a moment, similar to the smartphones they used to use.But nothing has really changed\u2026\u00a0Seo Jun-ho shrugged and put the ball into his inventory.

Deliveries across floors, especially teleport deliveries, were expensive enough to make the average person nervous.\u201cI don\u2019t remember ordering anything\u2026\u201d He picked up the mysterious package and wrinkled his nose.\u00a0Is it a trap from those fiend bastards?It was likely enough. He was currently tracking fiends in secret. He slowly prepared his magic for an explosion and started to open the package. But contrary to his expectations, there was a luxurious box beneath the packaging.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d His eyes widened as he recognized the seal carved onto the box.There was no way he wouldn\u2019t know. News of the biggest auction had reached even the 2nd floor.It was the mark of The Auction.He carefully opened the box, only to find a refined necklace sitting inside.\u201cItem info.\u201d He only got more confused when he saw it was a Rare-grade necklace.\u00a0Stamina Regeneration Necklace\u2026 Just who sent it to me?He pondered for a while, but he couldn\u2019t find the answer. No one from his family, team, or even guild would send him this sort of present.\u201cHuh? It\u2019s a note.\u201d He picked up a note in the corner of the box and quickly read over it.\u2013 I hope you\u2019re healthy. I\u2019ll come up within half a year. Your uncle.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He read over it several times and looked up silently at the starry night sky. His eyes were starting to sparkle like the stars.Half a year\u2026 So he\u2019s starting to move.\u00a0He was filled with both anticipation and worry. The 2nd floor was a completely \u2018different world\u2019 than the one his uncle knew.But he simply shrugged his shoulders and let out a chuckle.\u201cGeez, just who am I worrying about.\u201dHis name was Arthur Green. He was Gilbert Green\u2019s son and regarded as the Five Heroes\u2019 son.* * *Seo Jun-ho blinked as he emerged from the Incheon Airport gate. Someone he didn\u2019t expect was waiting for him.\u201cWh-why are you staring at me like that\u2026?\u201d Cha Si-eun muttered as she avoided his gaze. She was wearing a clean suit as always.\u201cOh, sorry. I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019d come all the way to the airport.\u201d\u201c\u2026Escorting you when you come back to your home country is also the duty of a secretary.\u201d She casually led him to a car.\u201cDo you have anywhere else you\u2019d like to stop by? Or shall we head straight to the Association?\u201d She asked as he took a seat.\u201cGo to the Association. And,\u201d Seo Jun-ho rummaged around his bag, pulling out a well-wrapped book. \u201cThis is a gift. I didn\u2019t know what to buy, so I just got a book\u2026 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll like it though.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019d be grateful for any gift at all\u2026\u201d Cha Si-eun smiled softly, but her expression quickly changed as she turned around. Once she saw the book that Seo Jun-ho was holding, a ripple formed in her eyes.\u201cW-wait. Did you buy me the fantasy novel that\u2019s getting adapted into a movie in Hollywood, \u2018The Youngest Son of the Gates\u2019? The hardcover edition\u2026?!\u201d\u201cOh, you know this book? It was the last copy in the bestseller section.\u201d\u201cOf course I know it!\u201d Cha Si-eun\u2019s mouth was wide as she held out her hands politely, as if she was receiving New Year\u2019s money. She stared at it for a second and cradled it in her arms like it was treasure, bowing her head. \u201cI tried so hard to get a copy, but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cReally? I\u2019m glad, then.\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked at Cha Si-eun and her bright face. \u201cYou can read it right now, if you want.\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m working right now.\u201d Her words were admirable, but her eyes betrayed her.\u201cDo you have any documents to finish up?\u201d\u201cI finished them all on the way to the airport\u2026\u201d\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Seo Jun-ho smiled and buried himself into the seat. \u201cHave fun reading, and wake me up when we arrive.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Cha Si-eun hesitated before responding in a soft voice. \u201cG-good night\u2026\u201dA few minutes passed.

Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face soured.\u201cSherlock? What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cWherever he goes, things happen and terror arises. Much like you.\u201d\u201cThe hell are you saying\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho grinned as he sat down and pulled out the liquor he bought from the Duty Free store.\u201cHere, Balvenie 1975. It\u2019s a present.\u201d\u201cYou got me something expensive? What to do; I\u2019m abstaining right now.\u201d\u201cJust drink it later, then.\u201d Deok-gu looked happy as he held the bottle worth millions of won.(TN: Thousands of dollars.)\u201cI contacted Arthur on the way here. I told him I\u2019m going up within half a year.\u201d\u201cGood. That kid must\u2019ve had it really hard, but he grew up nicely.\u201d\u201cHas it been a while since you saw him?\u201d\u201cHe hasn\u2019t come down since going up to the 2nd floor. He said the 1st floor keeps reminding him of his dad\u2026\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s mouth tasted bitter. He changed the topic. \u201cOh, and I heard from Gong Juha\u2026 She said the invitation you gave me wasn\u2019t a normal one.\u201d\u201cSo you heard?\u201d Shim Deok-gu nodded, seemingly unaffected. \u201cIt was a warning to show the world how much I care for you.\u201d\u201cEw, gross.\u201d\u201cHehe, that grossness will save you at some point.\u201d Seo Jun-ho was a little embarrassed by the love his friend was showing him. He was all grown up.\u201cAnyways, I have a favor to ask you.\u201d\u201cWhat favor?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking for an orphanage.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why an orphanage?\u201d Shim Deok-gu tilted his head. He didn\u2019t understand.\u201cListen carefully to what I\u2019m about to say. It\u2019s pretty heavy.\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face was serious as he started to tell the story.How he\u2019d come to get the ability to see the memories of the dead. How he\u2019d been the one to take care of the Watchdogs at the Las Vegas auction. And lastly, about the place where the fiends trained orphans into one of them.When he finished, Shim Deok-gu\u2019s face crumbled like plaster.\u201c\u2026What you said, is that all true?\u201d\u201cYeah. But I don\u2019t know the specific location of the orphanage. The only thing I\u2019m sure of is that it\u2019s not in Korea.\u201d\u201cDammit, those bastards don\u2019t know where to draw the line!\u201d Shim Deok-gu\u2019s breath was rough as he banged his fist on the handle of his chair. That was how shocking the news of the orphanage was. \u201c\u2026Hoo, I promise. I\u2019ll find out everything I can.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m counting on you.\u201dAfter trying to catch his breath, Deok-gu uncorked the Balvenie 1975. Seo Jun-ho looked at him blankly.\u201cI thought you were abstaining?\u201d\u201cShit, whatever! How could I just sit still after hearing all that?\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d Seo Jun-ho quickly activated his Frost skill, and several ice cubes formed in his glass. The two downed their glasses.\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201d Deok-gu\u2019s face wrinkled at the taste of the strong whiskey. He wiped his lips.\u201cKwon Noya wants to see you.\u201d\u201cNoya?\u201d(TN: \u2018Noya\u2019 also means old man, but they use it like a name/nickname.)\u201cYeah. You know the sword you asked for before you went to the States? He said it\u2019ll be finished tomorrow and that he wants to give it to you in person. It won\u2019t be suspicious anymore if you guys meet.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d Seo Jun-ho placed his glass down and nodded. There was a simple reason he hadn\u2019t been able to meet with Kwon Noya immediately after he awakened from the ice.I didn\u2019t have anything to my name back then.\u00a0On the other hand, Kwon Noya was far above him like a city wall. But now, things were different.\u201cWhat do you think? Do you think I\u2019m big enough to meet him?\u201d\u201cWell, you have a lot to go compared to 2nd floor rankers\u2026 But when we look at the 1st floor, you\u2019re doing amazing. Your progress is shocking.\u201dThe other countries knew that he was over level 15, but there was another reason why he was so famous.\u201cSo the Uncleared Gates are a big factor.\u201d\u201cYour plan worked.\u201d He was a rookie player that only went into Uncleared Gates and made Korea into a special safe zone. He\u2019d accomplished things that others never dreamed of.\u201cYou said it\u2019s tomorrow, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, go in the morning.\u201d\u201cAlright. I\u2019m going to rest, then.\u201d Shim Deok-gu grinned as he watched his friend leave.\u201cBastard, he\u2019s all excited to meet Noya since it\u2019s been a while.\u201dHe rolled his shoulders and drank another glass. He stopped smiling as he called his secretary.\u201cGet me a list of every Player Orphanage in the world.\u201dThere was no way he\u2019d do a sloppy job on this.* * *As soon as it was light out, Seo Jun-ho headed toward the Insa-dong Player Market. Deep within the street of workshops was Kwon Noya\u2019s forge. Seo Jun-ho looked at the workshop with fondness. It hadn\u2019t changed in the last 25 years.Now that I think about it, Kwon Noya\u2019s grandson must\u2019ve grown a lot.\u00a0He smiled as he thought of him. He was always being scolded by old man Kwon, so Seo Jun-ho always bought him ice cream. He was so cute, following him around like a puppy and calling him \u2018Hero-nim\u2019.He was so timid. I\u2019m curious to see how he\u2019s grown up.\u00a0From what he\u2019d heard from Deok-gu, the crybaby had inherited the workshop from Kwon Noya and was now the owner.As he got closer to the workshop, he heard a rhythmic sound.Clang! Clang! Clang!The ringing sounds of the hammer were very sharp and clean.That kid learned properly from the old man.\u00a0As he knocked on the door, full of anticipation, the sounds stopped.\u201cWho is it?\u201d As the front door opened, hot air billowed out. A 191cm muscular giant answered the door. He was dressed in work clothes and holding a hammer as if to prove that he was indeed a blacksmith.Wait. So this is\u2026\u00a0Seo Jun-ho blinked as he looked up at him.\u00a0This is Kwon Noya\u2019s grandson?He\u2019d been cute like a puppy in the past, but in 25 years, he\u2019d transformed into a hellhound.He recognized Seo Jun-ho and quickly welcomed him inside. \u201cOh, you\u2019re player Seo Jun-ho. The Association told me. Come on in.\u201dThe workshop was neat and tidy as he went inside. The family had been smiths for generations, and their skill was obvious.Noya\u2019s probably upstairs.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho looked at the stairs.\u201cYou rascal, it\u2019s so hard to see your face.\u201d A strong, familiar voice came from behind him. As Seo Jun-ho slowly turned around, he smiled as he saw the old man with an overgrown beard and white hair.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Noya.\u201d It was the first time he\u2019d seen him in 25 years.Webtoon: Chapters 34 \u2013 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His grandson Kwon Palmo didn\u2019t know Specter\u2019s face, but Kwon Noya did. He\u2019d been the one to make Specter\u2019s mask.(TN: \u2018Palmo\u2019 can be read as \u2018Mr. Arm\u2019.)The two didn\u2019t care about appearances and acted like friends despite their age difference. Kwon Noya looked at Seo Jun-ho with one eye squinted.\u201cExcuse me\u2026 Have you two met before?\u201d Kwon Palmo tilted his head as he asked, but his grandfather shook his head.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Palmo, fetch a glass of Agarit tea for our guest.\u201d\u201cHuh? That precious tea\u2026?\u201d Kwon Noya nodded, and the giant headed to the kitchen, still stealing glances from Seo Jun-ho. Seo Jun-ho grinned as he watched Kwon Palmo\u2019s back get smaller.\u201cHe still listens well to his grandfather.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t act like you don\u2019t know. When he doesn\u2019t listen, he gets stupidly stubborn.\u201dSeo Jun-ho picked up the sword on the anvil. \u201cBut still, he learned well despite crying during all your scoldings. It\u2019s a great sword. The balance of the weight is perfect.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmph, I still have a lot to teach him.\u201d\u201cAnd you still don\u2019t know how to react to compliments,\u201d Seo Jun-ho chuckled as he walked to Kwon Noya. \u201cAnd why aren\u2019t you welcoming me back? Aren\u2019t you happy that I returned?\u201d\u201cHappy?!\u201d His haughty expression quickly became disgusted. But it was only for a moment, and he patted Seo Jun-ho on the shoulder.\u201c\u2026You\u2019ve gone through a lot.\u201d\u201cThanks. You\u2019re still healthy. And your personality is still soft.\u201d\u201cFlattery will get you nowhere. Sit for now.\u201d But before Seo Jun-ho could, Kwon Noya asked a question, his voice grave. \u201cWhat was the reason?\u201d\u201cHow am I supposed to answer when you ask me like that?\u201d\u201cI heard the summary from Deok-gu, but I didn\u2019t hear the reason why you decided to come back.\u201d\u201cUm, well, seeing is believing.\u201dSeo Jun-ho flicked his finger and frost crystallized in the air. After staring at it with a piercing look, Kwon Noya finally spoke.\u201cIs that the Frost Queen\u2019s skill?\u201d\u201cYeah. I got her skill, and now I have a chance to save my teammates.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Kwon Noya understood everything. If it was like that, the kindhearted idiot in front of him would return as a player without a second thought.\u201cSo let\u2019s do our best from now on, since we have a lifelong contract anyways.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Kwon Noya let out a long sigh. \u201cThe lifelong contract I signed was with Specter, not some newbie named Seo Jun-ho.\u201d\u201cHey, that\u2019s not fair\u2026 You\u2019re joking, right?\u201d Seo Jun-ho swallowed nervously.Kwon Noya burst into laughter. \u201cAhahaha! It\u2019s a joke. I wanted to see that stupid face of yours.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m handsome and you know it.\u201d\u201cHandsome? You look like a parasite. Our Palmo is the manly, handsome one.\u201d\u201c\u2026Um, anyways,\u201d Before he could start bragging about his grandson, Seo Jun-ho needed to finish his business, \u201cI came because you said the sword is done.\u201d\u201cThe one you told me to make with dragon bones? It\u2019s finished.\u201d\u201cHasn\u2019t it only been five days since I commissioned you?\u201d\u201cHah, have you forgotten?\u201d Kwon Noya went over to a shelf in the back and brought back a black sheathed sword. \u201cI wield the hammer for you, and you wield the sword for me. That\u2019s the promise we made.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not the one who said that, right? It\u2019s cringey.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ahem, check out the weapon.\u201dSeo Jun-ho took the sheathed sword into his hands, and his eyes started to sparkle. It was made of dragon bones, and the red symbol of Kwon Noya\u2019s workshop was carved into the middle.\u201cThe red and black combo\u2026 It\u2019s so cool.\u201d\u201cThe guy inside is even better,\u201d Kwon Noya said, full of confidence. Seo Jun-ho swallowed and looked at the handle. It was the same black as the sheath and shaped like a dragon\u2019s head. Filled with anticipation and excitement, Seo Jun-ho wrapped his hand around it.\u2026It fits my hand perfectly.\u00a0Twenty-five years had passed, but Kwon Noya still thought of him. His chest was starting to tingle, and Seo Jun-ho unsheathed the sword.Shing!It let out a sharp sound, as if the air around it was being cut. The blade that extended from the dragon\u2019s mouth captivated him. It was like a work of art, his jaw dropping as he studied it. A voice came from behind him.\u201cYou rascal, who throws someone a bunch of dragon bones and tells them to make a sword? I mixed in some new material.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s why it\u2019s so shiny. It wouldn\u2019t be like this if it was just made of bone.\u201d\u201cIts durability and magic conductivity is a lot better than if it was pure bone.\u201d\u201cLet me check. Item info.\u201dThe information window popped up in front of him.\u300cBlack Dragon Fang\u300dGrade: Unique\u2217Durable weapon: This sword is extremely durable.\u2217Critical injury: Wounds caused by this sword are not easily healed.\u2217Persistent Hunter: If there is blood on the blade, the location of the blood\u2019s owner can be roughly estimated.Equipment Requirements: Level 23, 60 Strength, 60 Speed.\u201c\u2026Yes, this is what a sword should be,\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered, entranced. He\u2019d been using throwaway swords from the Association\u2019s warehouse.Most items made by smiths were usually Normal-grade\u2014or Magic-grade if it was well-made. But Kwon Noya was one of the most skilled, most famous blacksmiths in the world. Perhaps that was why Black Dragon Fang was Unique.\u201cYour skill is as sharp as ever. It\u2019s an amazing sword. A dragon\u2019s fang; I like that.\u201d\u201cAs sharp as ever? I got even better, you rascal.\u201d Seo Jun-ho was grinning at the sword like a child, and Kwon Noya smiled too. \u201cYou evil bastard. You told me to retire to my room and play Go, but you\u2019re making work for me again.\u201d\u201cYou, playing Go? Don\u2019t make me laugh. You\u2019re not even that good.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m the same as before? Just you wait!\u201dTheir bickering eventually led to a Go board being taken out. At that moment, Kwon Palmo came in with an apron, carrying a tea table.\u201cIt\u2019s hot, so please be careful.\u201d He placed down the teacups and caught Kwon Noya\u2019s look before going upstairs.\u201cIt\u2019s a rare tea. Don\u2019t spill any.\u201d\u201cGeez, Noya, you know I\u2019ve had all sorts of expensive teas.\u201d But as Seo Jun-ho blew on the tea and took a sip, his eyes bulged.\u201cWh-what is this\u2026?\u201d\u201cKukuku, doesn\u2019t your head feel clear? And your eyes too? You want to drink more, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of tea is this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you if you win.\u201d Kwon Noya cackled, and Seo Jun-ho grabbed a stone.Thirty minutes later, Kwon Noya picked up the heartless stones and threw them on the ground.\u201cThis is a shitty game.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to put them there\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Kwon Noya drained the last of his now-cold tea. \u201cKid, have you heard of the Second Race?\u201d\u201cMonsters with intelligence that are similar to humans? Orcs, elves, banshees\u2026 Those guys?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what we called them before, but their standards of intelligence have changed on the 2nd floor.\u201d Kwon Noya placed stones on the Go board to explain. He pushed the black stones to one corner of the board. \u201cSo, these black stones are members of the Second Race that players have hunted in Gates thus far. We still call them monsters.\u201d\u201cHow about the white ones?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re the ones we now call the Second Race.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between them?\u201d\u201cIntelligence.\u201d Kwon Noya tapped on his temple. \u201cThe ones we now call the Second Race are all responsive to communication.\u201d\u201cWait. We can communicate with orcs?\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes were filled with shock. All the orcs he\u2019d encountered only screeched gibberish.\u201cOrcs have always been lacking in a lot of ways. It\u2019s hard to find ones we can communicate with.\u201d\u201cBut there are still some out there. Why are you suddenly bringing this up though\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou asked me about the tea.\u201d Kwon Noya stroked the teacup. \u201cIt\u2019s called Agarit tea. The elves cultivated the leaves themselves, and you can\u2019t buy it with money.\u201d\u201c\u2026Not even on the 2nd floor?\u201d\u201cWho knows. If you make a connection with the elves, you might be able to.\u201d Seo Jun-ho was a little disappointed since he liked the tea.\u201cNoya, can I ask you one more question?\u201d\u201cSpit it out.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easier to just show you.\u201d Seo Jun-ho finished his sentence and pulled out the \u2018Unknown Ball\u2019 he\u2019d won at the auction. Kwon Noya stared at the ball on the Go board and tilted his head.\u201cHm?\u00a0It\u2019s an interesting-looking ball.\u201d\u201c\u2026So you don\u2019t know what it is either?\u201d\u201cYou bastard, I\u2019m not some sage from Chamseongdae*. Do you think I know everything? But\u2026\u201d(TN: Oldest surviving astronomical observatory in the world that\u2019s in Korea.)Noya picked up the Unknown Ball and studied it. He nodded.\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I know. This ball is Elven.\u201d\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\u201cHm, it\u2019ll take too long to explain everything so I\u2019ll summarize. I\u2019ve met an Elven elder.\u201d\u201cWait, so you\u2019ve gone to the 2nd floor before?\u201d\u201cNot me. He was the one that came down.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dHe\u2019d never imagined that creatures from the upper floors could ride the dimensional elevator. Seo Jun-ho was filled with a new shock.\u201cDon\u2019t go around talking about this. It\u2019s top-secret,\u201d Noya said.\u201cYou know I\u2019m tight-lipped. Tell me more.\u201d\u201cThe elf\u2026 gave off an energy that was both mystical and strange. The being in front of me was definitely humanoid, but it was like I was standing in front of water or a plant.\u201d Kwon Noya stared at the ball as he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s the same feeling I get with this ball.\u201d\u201c\u2026An Elven item.\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked at the ball with new eyes.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to find elves on the 1st floor, so go to a dark elves\u2019 forest instead.\u201d\u201cDark elves? Is that necessary?\u201d\u201cYou tell me. But Elven items that give off the energy of the World Tree can be activated.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho took a moment to sort his thoughts before he tapped on his Vita, looking for an article. He\u2019d seen it on the flight to Korea.[New Gate in Grantham, England, featured monsters are dark elves. Recruitment open.]\u201cPerfect.\u201dHe\u2019d decided on the next Gate he\u2019d conquer.Webtoon: Chapters 35 \u2013 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s not good at expressing his feelings.\u201dHe knew that better than anyone. Seo Jun-ho smiled back, and Kwon Palmo took out a small pouch.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cAgarit tea leaves. He told me to give it to you. He\u2019s never treated a new person this well before\u2026 He must really like you.\u201d Part of Kwon Noya\u2019s charm was the way he took care of you despite his grumpy demeanor.\u201cTell Noya I said thank you.\u201d\u201cAlright.

What?\u00a0He hadn\u2019t said anything else, so there was nothing to go off of. The only feeling he got was that it wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing.* * *\u201cDark elves?\u201d Cha Si-eun repeated, shocked. She\u2019d been working on some documents.\u201cYes. Why are you so surprised?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re famous monsters. For multiple reasons.\u201d She quickly tapped on her Vita and started to read an article. \u201cDark elves refer to elves who betrayed the World Tree and got drunk on dark power.

Do you have any information?\u201d\u201cMm, it\u2019s a little too shady to be called information, but there\u2019s a domestic article about it.\u201d She projected the article in front of Seo Jun-ho.[Cheong-hae Guild to participate in the Grantham Gate raid.]\u201cCheong-hae Guild.\u201d They were a prestigious guild that was famous even outside the country. It was also the guild of Cha Min-woo, who he\u2019d met while fighting the Cinder Fox.\u201cAnything else?\u201d\u201cUm, I think Cheong-hae is the entirety of the Korean team, but I think there are players from all over the world that are gathering.\u201d\u201cAll over the world\u2026? Wait. What about the Gate information?\u201d All he knew was that you needed to be at least level 20.\u201cThe Gate is called \u2018Wild Forest\u2019, and your level has to be below 35.

The Gate\u2019s conditions weren\u2019t advantageous for either the players nor the monsters.The bastard of a system is fair, after all.\u00a0But there was a simple reason why the Party Cap was at 200.\u00a0That\u2019s how hard it is to defeat the monsters\u2026Or the Gate was insanely big, and that many monsters would appear. It was definitely one of those two.\u201cThe Wild Forest, was it called?\u201d He would prefer it if all he had to do was defeat one strong boss monster.

He\u2019d received news this morning that the Watchdogs had been completely annihilated and that he\u2019d failed. The Fiend Association was obviously angry, and he\u2019d now received an order to return.This is the worst.\u00a0He hadn\u2019t expected the Watchdogs to fail. Neither did he imagine that the Skeleton Mage would be killed.Nazad Hallow is famous for treasuring his disciples, and I made Arma die\u2026\u00a0He swallowed.How had things gotten this bad?He looked for someone to direct his anger toward and settled on one man.\u201c\u2026Seo Jun-ho.\u201d He was the cause of it all, and continued to wreck Kal Signer\u2019s plans. Whenever something went wrong, Seo Jun-ho had been the one to mess it up.Seo Jun-ho also participated in the Las Vegas auction.\u00a0He\u2019d been there when the Shadow Brothers were killed and when the Watchdogs were annihilated. It was a rational conclusion.But the Association won\u2019t think so.\u00a0Kal Signer had already talked to them, but they didn\u2019t buy it. From a logical point of view, it made no sense that a player that had debuted only two months ago could defeat all of them. If Kal Signer were in their shoes, he\u2019d also snort at the notion.They probably think I\u2019m trying to pin the blame on someone else.Creak.\u00a0Someone opened the door of the hut and stepped in.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dNeither of them had been able to sense the visitor\u2019s presence. Kal Signer and his subordinate nervously grabbed their weapons.Rumble! Crash!Thunder flashed ominously, and the stranger wearing a magician\u2019s hat stood silently at the door. As soon as they saw who it was, the two dropped their weapons. Sweat started to bead on their foreheads as they got on one knee.Demonic energy\u2026!Their power is like one of the executives\u2019 Supreme Masters!The Fiend Association was a group of scum. The only reason why there was a hierarchy was because of the Supreme Masters. They adapted special traits of the demonic clan and looked exactly like them.Being scared of a fiend who was stronger than them was a common occurrence.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe stranger was silent for a second longer before turning to Kal Signer.\u201cAre you Kal Signer?\u201d\u201c\u2026Y-yes.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t dare lie. The violent energy filled the hut and covered the entire area. The stranger stared at Kal Signer for a moment before taking off his hat, revealing the ice-cold face of an elderly man. He spoke,\u201cI am Nazad Hallow. Even if I don\u2019t say it, you know the reason why I\u2019ve come to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cN-Nazad Hallow-nim?\u201d Kal Signer\u2019s mind went blank. Had this old man come to repay him for his disciple\u2019s death?But Nazad said something else. \u201cI saw your report. I\u2019m intrigued.\u201d\u201c\u2026My report?\u201d\u201cThe one about Seo Jun-ho.\u201dSeo Jun-ho!Realizing what he was saying, Kal Signer nodded eagerly. \u201cY-yes. I posted a report about him.\u201d\u201cIf I follow, the rookie named Seo Jun-ho defeated the Shadow Brothers and the Watchdogs\u2026 He\u2019s deeply connected to my disciple\u2019s death. Is that what you meant?\u201d\u201cYes. Seo Jun-ho is no doubt related to their deaths.\u201d Kal Signer wasn\u2019t actually sure. But if he wanted to survive, he had to insist that Seo Jun-ho was related.\u201cHm. But how is that possible? It\u2019s barely been two months since that rookie debuted.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dKal Signer\u2019s eyes quickly shifted. He was both powerless and powerful, and had wits befitting of an executive of the Fiend Association.Nazad Hallow didn\u2019t come here to ask me such trivial questions.\u00a0Someone as powerful as Nazad didn\u2019t move without a clear goal in mind. Kal Signer realized what it was and slowly raised his head.\u201cIf I\u2019m honest, I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s possible either.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re not sure?\u201d Nazad Hallow\u2019s eyes were as cold as frost. Magic and Demonic energy merged into one, gripping Kal Signer by the throat and raising him up.\u201cK-kuh!\u201d\u201cDo you think I came all the way to hear that?\u201d\u201cI-I really don\u2019t know. But\u2026!\u201d Kal Signer was desperate to save himself. \u201cI will\u2026 capture him\u2026 and bring him to you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNazad held him for a moment longer and tapped his cane lightly on the ground.Crash!\u00a0Kal Signer fell and coughed violently. Nazad leaned in.\u201cI will give you half a year. Find him and bring him to me within that time,\u201d he said coldly.\u201cCough\u2026\u00a0B-but, Nazad-nim, he has to reach level 30 before he can come to the 2nd floor. I can\u2019t do anything about that\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. You gambled your life to make the impossible possible.\u201dNazad scattered into dust and disappeared.Shwaaaaa!The hut was once again filled with the sound of rain. Kal Signer\u2019s subordinate quickly scrambled to him.\u201cSigner-nim, are you alright?\u201d\u201c\u2026Dammit.\u201d Kal Signer banged his fist on the floor and bit his lip. \u201cWe\u2019ll ditch Kim Woo-joong and go down to the 1st floor. Find a Pathfinder,\u201d he ordered gravely.The Pathfinder would help him go down the dimensional elevator while avoiding the eyes of the Player Association.* * *Drip, drip.An AI carrier followed Seo Jun-ho as he walked. He entered the room that Cha Si-eun had booked for him and looked up at the gloomy Grantham sky.\u201cThis country\u2019s weather is as bad as ever.\u201d England could go through four seasons in one day. When he\u2019d arrived at the airport, the sky was bright and the weather was summery, but it had become autumnal in the afternoon.Seo Jun-ho finished organizing his luggage and checked his schedule.The raid is in four days.\u00a0He\u2019d only come early to adjust to the time difference so he could be at peak condition. The more experienced a player was, the more they had to pay attention to their condition before they went into a Gate.\u201cI\u2019ll have to get warmed up in these four days.\u201dMost players spent the days before a raid adjusting their diet and doing light exercise. But in order to bring out the best in his fighting, Seo Jun-ho made a different choice.\u201cLet\u2019s go for a long walk.\u201dBefore he entered the Wild Forest, he was planning to clear another Gate in the area.Webtoon: Chapters 36 \u2013 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cha Min-woo was among the crowd of people that were gathering in front of the Gate, wearing an armband. He scanned the players and quietly nodded his head.\u201cAs expected\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh? What did you say?\u201d His team member asked. Cha Min-woo jutted his chin toward the other players.\u201cLook at the players around you. There\u2019s not a single one.\u201dMost players were no longer considered beginners when they reached around level 25. If you didn\u2019t go around clearing Uncleared Gates like Seo Jun-ho, you needed to clear at least twenty Gates to reach that level.That also meant you had to have at least ten near-death experiences. None of the people today looked inexperienced\u201cWell\u2026 this Gate only lets in players between levels 20 and 35.\u201d\u201cThe energy is different from the players we\u2019ve seen in our country. Their equipment is good too.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re on the stage of the world.\u201dCha Min-woo was strangely restless as he looked around, as if looking for something. His team members noticed and smiled.\u201cYou\u2019re looking for player Seo Jun-ho, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll hurt your neck.\u201d\u201c\u2026Leave him alone, he\u2019s excited.\u201dWatching Seo Jun-ho fight the Cinder Fox had given him a new perspective.It\u2019s embarrassing to think about how I\u2019ve always taken the easy, comfortable paths.After that day, Cha Min-woo had started to train himself. He wanted to show Seo Jun-ho a better version of himself if they met again.\u201c\u2026He\u2019s over there.\u201d Cha Min-woo whispered as he stared to one side. Seo Jun-ho looked much better than last time. \u201cBut who is\u2026?\u201dCha Min-woo tilted his head and walked over to Seo Jun-ho. As he got close, Seo Jun-ho blinked as he recognized him.\u201cHuh? Are you the one from the Cinder Fox\u2026\u201d\u201cYou remember me. Let me introduce myself again. I\u2019m Cha Min-woo of the Cheong-hae Guild.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again. I heard that you helped me after the fight, but I never got to thank you.\u201d\u201cI should be the one thanking you. You saved my life.\u201d The team members standing behind him also bowed. \u201cDid you have a problem? Your armor\u2026 I mean.\u201d\u201cOh, this\u2026?\u201d Seo Jun-ho laughed bitterly and looked down. The leather armor that Kwon Noya had made him was ripped and messy.\u00a0I got too greedy.Seo Jun-ho let out a small sigh. The idea of going into a Gate to condition himself was good in theory. But he\u2019d gotten too excited.\u2026I should\u2019ve only done one. Two Gates was a little too much.During those four days, he\u2019d cleared two Gates in the area. Thanks to that, he\u2019d been able to reach level 23 to equip Black Dragon Fang, but his armor had been reduced to rags in the process.\u201cI warmed up before I came.\u201d\u2026What kind of warm-up did he do to ruin his armor?\u00a0Cha Min-woo doubted him, but he swallowed the question.\u201cAre you really going in with that armor? It looks really dangerous.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only five minutes left until we go in, so it\u2019s not like I can do anything. It\u2019s fine.\u201dThat was true. Cha Min-woo looked disappointed. He didn\u2019t really have any way to help him.Vroom!A motorcycle parked in front of them.\u201cMr. Seo Jun-ho, correct?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cPlease sign here. It\u2019s an express delivery.\u201d After he signed, the driver got off and put down a large carrier and disappeared. Cha Min-woo watched from the side.\u201cDid you order new armor by any chance?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t order anything\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho tilted his head and picked up the carrier.\u00a0It\u2019s super heavy.\u00a0He put it down again and pressed a button on the handle. There was the sound of creaking cogs, and it opened. Inside it was beautiful black armor.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d Seo Jun-ho stroked the surface, and his suspicion turned into certainty.I\u2019m sure of it. The armor\u2019s made of dragon bones.\u00a0He picked up the note inside.\u2013 This is a commission for Association President Shim Deok-gu. The name of the armor is simply \u2018Black Armor\u2019. I hope you like it. -Kwon Palmo.\u2026There\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t like it.\u00a0The armor fit Kwon Noya\u2019s \u2018Black Dragon Fang\u2019 perfectly.Who would have thought that grandfather and grandson would make such a great set of gear together.Seo Jun-ho suddenly realized what Kwon Palmo had said at the workshop.\u00a0He said I\u2019d know soon, and it was this\u2026 Deok-gu, that rascal.He grinned, far from disappointed. Deok-gu had used the dragon bones Seo Jun-ho had given him to gift him armor. It was an unexpected gift, but the timing was perfect. He needed armor now more than ever.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Cha Min-woo whispered. He was staring at the armor like the soul had left his body. He swallowed.The quality of this armor is much better than the ones we get from the workshop we have an exclusive contract with.Armor made of bones were usually coarse and uncomfortable when you wore them, but the armor in front of him didn\u2019t give him that impression at all.Even the joints are delicate. They\u2019re made up of smaller bones.The technique would be hard to imitate, even for a skilled craftsman. Cha Min-woo started to get curious.\u00a0Which master made this?\u00a0He looked around the carrier, but there wasn\u2019t a single brand logo he recognized.However, the word \u2018Kwuan*\u2019 was written lightly, as if it was added as an afterthought.(TN: This is written in English. I\u2019m keeping the romanization as is.)\u201cKwon\u2026?\u201d He read the name without a second thought, but his eyes went wide as he said it out loud. There were countless blacksmiths in the world. But among the Kwon smiths, there were only two people who could make armor with this level of skill.\u201cOh, the Kwon workshop in Andong\u2026!\u201d The clan had been blacksmiths for generations and was world-renowned. That was because it was the family of one of the best blacksmiths in the world: Kwon Noya. As soon as he said that, the faces of the nearby players changed.\u201cWhat? That armor is from the Kwon workshop?\u201d\u201cNo way. I never heard that they made armor for rookies.\u201d\u201cThere must be a mistake.\u201dAs the people watched, Seo Jun-ho carefully raised the Black Armor. He looked down at the carrier to double-check, but there was only one piece of armor.Armor sets usually have one set for the upper body and another set for the lower body\u2026 Did he leave out the latter because there wasn\u2019t enough time?\u00a0Seo Jun-ho was slightly disappointed, but he put it on.The armor expanded like a machine, covering him from head to toe.\u201cO-oh my god! It\u2019s Spread Armor?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s insane\u2026 Only ancient artifacts can do that!\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t many people who can make Spread Armor\u2026\u201d\u201cWait, it says \u2018Kwon\u2019 inside the carrier!\u201d\u201cWhat? Then\u2026 it really\u00a0was\u00a0made at the Kwon workshop?\u201dAll around him, people gulped. They were looking at Spread Armor from the Kwon workshop, giving it an instant market value. The players who realized this looked at Seo Jun-ho with envy.\u201cHup.\u201d Seo Jun-ho moved his body to test out the armor and smiled.I like it.\u00a0Even if hard, heavy armor had magic attached to make it light, it was still hard to move in. But the armor that Kwon Palmo made didn\u2019t bother his movement in the slightest.The options are great too.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes were bright as he finished reading the item info.\u300cBlack Armor\u300dGrade: UniqueStamina +15\u2217Lightweight: Magic is attached to make this armor lightweight.\u2217Disruption: This armor can block tracking skills (C-rank and lower) aimed at the user.Equipment Requirements: Level 23, 60 Stamina, 60 Strength.It was a bit lacking compared to Kwon Noya\u2019s sword, but the armor was also Unique-grade. It was the best armor he could get at his level.And since they\u2019re a set, they\u2019ll be extra efficient.Equipment with too little prerequisites usually had limited functions. If it had too many, players wouldn\u2019t be able to use it. But that didn\u2019t apply to these two items.This is the perfect synergy that\u2019s created when a player and a talented blacksmith meet.The required level of the Black Dragon Fang and Black Armor was low, but the required stats were high. They were made to push Seo Jun-ho to his limits. That\u2019s what happened when he received items from an outstanding blacksmith.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that the Kwon workshop made deals\u2026 I guess that\u2019s the Association for you.\u201dCha Min-woo thought that the Kwon workshop had made the armor because of the Association. Seo Jun-ho was an outstanding player, but the Kwon workshop had never done dealings with newbies.\u201cThe President used his power,\u201d Seo Jun-ho smiled brightly at him and checked the time.It was exactly eleven o\u2019clock. It was time to go into the Gate.\u201cExcuse me, Mr. Seo Jun-ho,\u201d Cha Min-woo said reluctantly.\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 is there a party you belong to?\u201d\u201cParty?\u201dIn Gates like the Wild Forest, no one went off on their own. The smallest units they went around in were parties. Seo Jun-ho was no different.The Party Cap is 200\u2026 so there will probably be about a thousand monsters.In a Gate like this, he also needed some people to watch his back. It wasn\u2019t impossible for him to go around alone, but it would be inefficient.\u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201cTh-then, would you like to join our party for this Gate?\u201d Cha Min-woo nervously looked back at his teammates.The Cheong-hae Guild isn\u2019t a bad option\u2026 Actually, it\u2019s good.\u00a0They were a noble guild with elite members. Seo Jun-ho couldn\u2019t find any reason to refuse and accepted happily.\u201cThank you for asking. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d11:02 AM.Two hundred players filled the Cap and entered the Wild Forest Gate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A male team member crouched down and touched the dirt before he replied.(TN: For clarification, CMW is a team leader at Cheong-hae, but SJH has joined his party, a smaller unit of his team.)\u201cNothing we can do about it. Looking at the climate, plants, and animals, this is a tropical rainforest.\u201d As Seo Jun-ho watched the players around him disperse, he tilted his head. Some of them were carrying identical metal stakes.\u201cJun-ho-nim, we should start moving.\u201d As he turned around, he saw that Cha Min-woo was holding the same device. Seo Jun-ho stared.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201d Cha Min-woo seemed momentarily confused. The female team member burst out into laughter.\u201cWow, is it your first time seeing a Terminal? So you have a cute side too.\u201d\u201cSeo Mirae. Don\u2019t be rude.\u201d Cha Min-woo held up the metal stake and started to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s probably your first time seeing one in person, but this is a Terminal. When there\u2019s a large-scale raid with lots of players, all party leaders bring one. Putting it in the ground creates a magical communication network that you use.\u201d\u201cHoo.\u201d This was something new. \u201cSo that\u2019s why people started to go off in different directions right away.\u201d He\u2019d wondered why they\u2019d done that. In the past, it had been customary to have a strategy meeting when they went in.\u201cYes. A long time ago, they didn\u2019t have this sort of technology, so players had to move as one body. But now, that\u2019s actually less efficient.\u201d Cha Min-woo shrugged as Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes sparkled, impressed. \u201cI thought this at the last Gate too, but it seems that Jun-ho-nim doesn\u2019t really have interest in the latest equipment.\u201d\u201cHehe, you\u2019re like an old person.\u201d\u201c\u2026N-no way.\u201d Seo Jun-ho cleared his throat and changed the subject. \u201cAnyways, we haven\u2019t introduced ourselves yet. I\u2019m Seo Jun-ho.\u201d\u201cSeo Mirae.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Choi Jin-pyo.\u201dShe was a cute girl with freckles sprayed across her nose, and he was a small man with horn-rimmed glasses. Cha Min-woo\u2019s face said he\u2019d forgotten something.\u201cOh, I forgot to do this since it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been in a party with an outsider. I\u2019ll explain the basics of my skills.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that alright?\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes went wide. Keeping your skills under wraps was the norm.\u201cThere\u2019s no point in working together if we don\u2019t know anything about each other,\u201d Cha Min-woo said, looking at his team members. \u201cJin-pyo is a healer. He\u2019s also in charge of videotaping the team.\u201d\u201cVideotaping?\u201d\u201cYes. Normally, parties record everything they do inside a Gate so they can get feedback and improve.\u201d\u201cYup~ Is it because you always went around alone? You really don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. He\u2019s never cleared a normal Gate.\u201d Most players built experience by going to Gates regardless of their size. Most of them also knew about the Terminals and the videotaping. But Seo Jun-ho had only learned about hunting through the internet after his return, and everything felt unfamiliar. He was in a lot more danger than in the past, but other things had changed as well.\u201cAnd we call this energetic kid the Spoiler.\u201d Cha Min-woo looked at Seo Mirae and let out a low sigh.\u201cSpoiler?\u201d\u201cYes. You know how there are people who spoil movies or books for no reason?\u201d\u201cAh, yeah.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean.\u201d Seo Jun-ho still looked confused, and Cha Min-woo laughed.\u201cIt\u2019ll be faster to show you. Seo Mirae.\u201d\u201cMhm, is it this body\u2019s turn? Let me read your fortune~\u201d(TN: Mirae is a name that means future.)Seo Mirae stepped forward and stared deeply at Seo Jun-ho.\u2026No, she\u2019s not looking at\u00a0me. Her eyes were fixed on him, but he got the feeling that she was looking at something else.\u201cHah!\u201d A moment later, Seo Mirae let out a sharp breath. Sweat had started beading on her forehead. \u201cWow, they say there\u2019s nothing to eat at a famous banquet*\u2026 but this person is the complete opposite.\u201d(TN: Korean idiom basically meaning that something loses its value if it becomes famous/popular.)\u201cHow was it?\u201d Cha Min-woo asked. She shrugged.\u201cHe\u2019s insane at fighting. He killed ten dark elves by himself! I don\u2019t know when, though.\u201d\u201cHa.\u00a0What did I tell you? He\u2019s an amazing person.\u201d Cha Min-woo spoke as if he\u2019d been the one to do that. He turned to Seo Jun-ho, who still didn\u2019t understand.\u201cShe can peek into the future of any target, but she has to tell them what she sees.\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll get badly hurt.\u201d\u201c\u2026You can see the future!\u201d It was an extremely rare skill. When he\u2019d gone around as Specter, there had been less than ten people in the world who could see the future.Then maybe\u2026\u00a0She could see when he\u2019d achieve his goal. When he\u2019d be able to save his friends. When he was about to ask, she held out her hand.\u201cDon\u2019t try to ask me about your future. I can\u2019t see far, and my foresight is only for reference.\u201d\u201cFor reference? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll put it simply. If things go as expected, you\u2019ll kill ten dark elves, right?\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded. That was the future she had seen. \u201cBut if you make up your mind and refuse to fight, what would happen?\u201d\u201c\u2026I wouldn\u2019t hunt the dark elves.\u201d\u201cBingo. That\u2019s why it\u2019s only for reference. I have to tell the target about their future, so the chances of it changing are higher.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d The future she had seen could change at any time. If the target didn\u2019t like what she saw, they could change it.\u201cThat\u2019s why I brought her here today. We\u2019ll be in a pinch if we get trapped or surrounded.\u201d\u201cSo she\u2019s insurance, in other words. You\u2019ll use information about the future as a foundation for clearing the Gate.\u201d\u201cPrecisely.\u201dThe girl had chalked up her skill as simply being a point of reference, but Seo Jun-ho thought otherwise.\u00a0Any skill that lets you look into the future is a cheat.He also felt glad that he was in this party. With that skill, they could avoid the worst decisions.\u201cAll I have are some physical reinforcement skills\u2026 Jun-ho-nim, you said your skill is being good with weapons, right?\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201d\u201cThe party\u2019s balance is excellent. I have a good feeling.\u201d Cha Min-woo grinned and raised his Terminal. \u201cLet\u2019s start moving too. We\u2019ll make a small camp and set up the communication network.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/sb2jqkv* * *Beep\u2014 Beep\u2014The Terminal beeped twice as it was buried into the ground. Cha Min-woo\u2019s face brightened.\u201cPhew, it\u2019s installed. Now, let\u2019s test it out\u2026\u201dHe tapped on his Vita and contacted someone. A moment later, a hologram display popped up, showing a foreigner\u2019s face.\u2013 \u201cYo, wassup. You still good?\u201d\u201cDuh. How are things on your end?\u201d\u2013 \u201cWe haven\u2019t run into a single dark elf. We\u2019re in the east.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re on the opposite side, the west.\u201d\u2013 \u201cReally? Nice. Have you reached the edge yet? Our map is still an open area.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, we haven\u2019t run into any walls either.\u201d\u2013 \u201cHm, really? That means the map is bigger than I thought\u2026 Anyways, contact me if there\u2019s an emergency.\u201d\u201cAlright. Good work.\u201d Cha Min-woo hung up and turned to his party. \u201cThe situation isn\u2019t bad. I think the players are setting up camp after spreading out.\u201cThere\u2019s not much difference from the future I\u2019ve seen so far. Not bad at all.\u201d\u201cI looked around the different communities, but not one of them look like they belong to dark elves. It seems that the enemies\u2019 numbers are lower than we expected.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d As Cha Min-woo spoke with his team members, Seo Jun-ho was locked deep in thought.\u2026The map is too big.\u00a0The Party Cap was 200, so it was expected that the area would be large. The problem was that it was bigger than he\u2019d ever imagined.\u00a0We\u2019ve been progressing for five hours. Same for the party that went east.Players moved far faster than normal humans, but even with their advantage, they still hadn\u2019t found the edge of the map.There are two hundred players in this vast area, but we haven\u2019t run into a single dark elf?As he opened the community channel with his Vita, he saw that it was overflowing with speculation that the dark elves were scared or in hiding.But Seo Jun-ho thought differently.Orcs will die if their leader orders it, but dark elves are different.\u00a0They were a species that had a lot of pride, so they wouldn\u2019t blindly follow their chief\u2019s words. Even if they were ordered to stay inside because suspicious humans were snooping around, they\u2019d ignore it without a second thought.So the fact that these prideful elves are following orders\u2026 means that their leader is that strong.Seo Jun-ho finished sorting his thoughts and turned to Seo Mirae. \u201cExcuse me. Can you check the future again?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t use my skill too often yet. I\u2019ll have to wait eight hours until I can use it again.\u201d\u201cMm\u2026\u00a0When you saw my future before, you said I killed ten dark elves by myself, right?\u201d\u201cYes. Exactly ten.\u201d\u201cThen, can you tell me around what time that was?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m not sure about the exact time, but it was dark, so it was probably night. We\u2019ll be busy setting up the Terminal, so I think it\u2019s tomorrow.\u201dNight. Seo Jun-ho had expected that answer. He nodded slowly, the corner of his lip curling up, as if he\u2019d heard a funny joke.\u201c\u2026How fun.\u201d\u201cHuh? What is?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Seo Jun-ho shook his head and pulled out a sleeping bag from his inventory. He patted it down on the ground, wriggled inside, and zipped it up. The sunlight was still strong, but it was obvious that he was planning to sleep.\u201cUm\u2026\u00a0Are you going to sleep?\u201d The healer looked confused, but Seo Jun-ho simply nodded and set an alarm.\u201cYes. Seeing how things are going, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to sleep tonight.\u201d\u201c\u2026Wait. Are you saying that the dark elves might make a surprise attack at night?\u201d\u201cIf you ask me, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d Cha Min-woo\u2019s face fell at his answer. He immediately tapped on his Vita and contacted everyone in the community channel. But he didn\u2019t receive positive answers, and he looked uneasy.\u201cAhem, I don\u2019t think they really care. They don\u2019t think that dark elves would listen to orders because they\u2019re prideful.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s a logical reaction. Ignore them and rest up.\u201d Seo Jun-ho put on a sleep mask and muttered to himself. \u201cHunting, saving people\u2026 It\u2019s gonna be a busy night.\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long for his words to come true.Barely five hours later, the \u2018Human Hunt\u2019 began in the darkened forest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In a clearing, two men sat in front of a bonfire. They were from the Bravo party, who were exploring the southern area of the forest.\u201cYawn.\u00a0Sunbae, aren\u2019t you tired?\u201d\u201cI sure am. But we\u2019re on guard duty.\u201d\u201c\u2026True.\u201d The hubae looked around his other sunbaes. They were all fast asleep. \u201cLooks like the other sunbaes aren\u2019t worried. But if the dark elves happen to make a surprise attack\u2026\u201d\u201cSurprise attack? Hey, these are dark elves we\u2019re talking about,\u201d the sunbae replied while grilling cheese on a tree branch. \u201cDark elves gave into the temptation of power and became corrupted because they nibbled on the branches of the World Tree. They did become powerful, but they were cursed by the Tree and their intellect was taken away. Forget following orders, they can barely communicate amongst themselves. There\u2019s no way they would be able to act as an army.\u201d\u201c\u2026But isn\u2019t it likely that we\u2019ll encounter them at night because we didn\u2019t see them at all during the day?\u201d\u201cEven if that\u2019s true, they act on their own, so we\u2019ll probably only see one or two at most.\u201d\u201cHm, well, we can handle that much on our own.\u201d\u201cExactly. Don\u2019t get your panties in a twist.\u201dAt that moment, there was a sound of movement in the thicket.\u201c\u2026Shh.\u201d The sunbae held his finger to his lips and turned toward the sound.\u2013\u00a0\u201cGrrr.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cKrrr.\u201dIt sounded like the growl of a dog. Red eyes started to appear in the darkness, staring at them. One, two, three\u2026\u201dS-sunbae-nim.\u201d The frightened hubae reached for his weapon, but the sunbae smiled.\u201cGeez, that scared me\u2026 Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re Woldogs.\u201d\u201c\u2026Woldogs?\u201d\u201cYeah, Wolfdogs. We call them Woldogs for short.\u201d He relaxed and spoke casually. \u201cThey get scared easily, so they\u2019re not very dangerous.\u201d(TN: In Korean, \u2018Wolfdog\u2019 would be three syllables instead of two.)\u201cStill\u2026 I\u2019m a little scared because there are so many of them.\u201d\u201cHow\u2019re you gonna be a player if you get scared of those tiny things? They\u2019re scared of fire too.\u201dHe placed the cheese down and made a torch, throwing it into the bushes.\u201cShoo, shoo.\u00a0The maknae\u2019s about to cry.\u201d(TN: \u2018Maknae\u2019 refers to the youngest person in a group.)\u201cWh-who said I\u2019m gonna cry?\u201d The sunbae laughed at his cute reaction, and the hubae tilted his head.\u201cAre you sure they\u2019re scared of fire?\u201d\u201cWhy, can\u2019t trust me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2026\u201d The hubae\u2019s eyes were wide as he watched the Wolfdogs\u2019 red eyes get bigger and bigger. They were coming closer. A Wolfdog emerged from the bush and stepped on the torch.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The sunbae seemed to have discovered something, his face paling.\u201c\u2026Wake the others.\u201d\u201cWh-what?\u201d\u201cWake the others! Now!\u201dThe Wolfdogs were ridden by dark elves.* * *Beep\u2014\u00a0Beep\u2014Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes opened at the sound of the alarm. He ripped off his sleeping mask and crawled out of his sleeping bag, surveying the area.\u201cOh, you\u2019re awake?\u201d Seo Mirae said in a friendly voice. She had made a fire while she was on guard duty.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s the situation like?\u201d\u201cNothing special has happened so far.\u201d\u201cHow about the other parties?\u201d\u201cPeople on nightwatch have been posting updates to the community every thirty minutes. It\u2019s 1:58 right now, so they\u2019ll be popping up again in two minutes.\u201dSeo Jun-ho walked over to the campfire and looked over her hologram screen.Seems like no one\u2019s been attacked yet.\u00a0Had he been wrong? As he wrinkled his forehead, the clock struck 2.\u201cNow, let\u2019s see.\u201d Seo Mirae finished making her report and blinked at the screen. \u201cHuh?\u201dNo matter how many times she refreshed the page, no new posts appeared. She tilted her head.\u201cThat\u2019s strange. Is there a problem with the magic network\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Seo Jun-ho said flatly.Shing.\u00a0He unsheathed his sword and stared into the dark forest.\u201cThey were probably caught by those bastards.\u201d\u201cThose bastards\u2026?\u201d Seo Mirae looked up, but she only saw the forest. Seo Jun-ho was looking at something she couldn\u2019t see.It was night. Thanks to Hunter\u2019s Night (A), all his stats were up by 10%, and his senses were sharpened.Four legs and red eyes\u2026 They\u2019re Woldogs.Wolfdogs had high endurance and speed, but most players underestimate them because they were easily frightened and had low combat skill.And it was true; even if they were gathered together, Wolfdogs weren\u2019t dangerous if you just waved a torch around.But that only applies to wild Woldogs.If they were \u2018raised\u2019 by someone else, they became a whole different monster.They\u2019re like horses.Horses were tame and easily frightened by nature, but if they were trained, they could become valiant warhorses.\u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d\u201cComing? What are you\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish her sentence, the trees started to shake under a powerful wind. Seo Jun-ho gripped Black Dragon Fang and glanced at her.This will be Black Dragon Fang\u2019s first meal. I should feed it something better.He took a step forward.\u201cWake Team Leader Cha.\u201d\u201cAre you being serious? But I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d \u2018See anything\u2019, she was about to say.Woosh!\u00a0A Wolfdog leapt out of the forest like a ray of light, swiping its paw toward her face.\u2026Ah?\u00a0She couldn\u2019t move and stared at the claws that were coming toward her.Seo Mirae played more of a support role than a combat one. Her physique wasn\u2019t enough to dodge unforeseen attacks.Slash!\u00a0A flash of white cut the Wolfdog in half, the dark elf riding it falling into the fire.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKyaaaaa!\u201d\u00a0The dark elf let out an ugly screech as it burned.It was hard to believe that they were descended from elves, who were called the race of beauty. Its flesh was rotting and decayed from the curse of the World Tree.\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 There\u2019s ten dark elves left, and nine Woldogs.\u201d Seo Jun-ho scanned the surrounding monsters. \u201cCome and get it. Unless you want me to go to you.\u201d\u2013 \u201cGrrrrr!\u201d\u2013 \u201cKyak!\u201dDid they understand him? The dark elves gripped their weapons and charged at him.Let\u2019s test out Black Armor.Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes flashed as he took out the three dark elves of the vanguard with one slice. He prepared his second strike even before their hot blood touched the ground.But the dark elf behind them hit him first.Clang! Clang!He felt an itch at his side and his back.\u201c\u2026This is amazing.\u201d His lip curled upward. He twisted his body and swung his sword like a bat.Slash!Four dark elf heads flew into the air. They were around level 30 to 35, but they couldn\u2019t take a single hit.Ah, this takes me back.After his stats had gotten high enough, he hadn\u2019t had any trouble dealing with small fry like these. He simply slaughtered them. Like right now.\u2013 \u201cKya, kayak!\u201d\u2013 \u201cKrr!\u201dEight of their comrades had been killed in an instant. The other dark elves looked at each other in panic.Obviously, there was no camaraderie between them.\u201cI can hear the gears in your heads turning from here, you bastards.\u201d They had instinctively started calculating how they could use the others to survive on their own.One brave dark elf thrust its spear, its eyes full of wickedness.Clang!Seo Jun-ho easily disarmed it. His sword grazed across the spear handle and stabbed its heart.Two left. Who should I go for?He was planning on letting one go. That way, he could use Confession of the Dead without Cha Min-woo\u2019s party watching.Thankfully, one dark elf recklessly swung its sword and made the decision for him.\u201cOkay, saucy boy. It\u2019ll be you.\u201d He cut off its head and started shouting angrily, \u201cDammit, the other one ran away. I\u2019ll go finish it off!\u201dBehind him, he heard the sound of dogs crying out. At some point, Cha Min-woo and Choi Jin-pyo had woken up and started dealing with the Wolfdogs.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Seo Jun-ho turned around and ran after the dark elf that had gotten away.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/sb2jqkv* * *\u201cMm, yeah,\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered as he crouched over the dead dark elf. \u201cThe tribal chief is definitely strong.\u201d The fact that he was acknowledged by others meant that he had more than enough strength to dominate the entire forest\u2014and it wasn\u2019t just strength that he had.He knows how to use his head. He launched simultaneous surprise attacks so we wouldn\u2019t be able to respond properly.\u00a0And more interestingly, the bastard could talk.\u201cAs soon as the dark elves bit into the World Tree\u2019s branches, their intellect fell\u2026\u201d But the chief still maintained his full mental capacity.The bastard\u2019s super smart. He wasn\u2019t some small fry even before he got corrupted.That was all the information he got from Confession of the Dead. When Seo Jun-ho returned to the camp, the fighting was already over.\u201cHoo, Jun-ho-nim was right. A surprise attack at night\u2026\u201d Cha Min-woo had killed nine Wolfdogs. He steadied his breath as he explained the situation. \u201cI woke up because I heard shrieking, and you were already fighting. After I got my bearings, I took care of the Woldogs with Jin-pyo\u2026 but I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry too.\u201dThey seemed to be embarrassed because they\u2019d been sleeping when the battle started.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be sorry. You guys took care of nine Woldogs.\u201dIf they hadn\u2019t, Seo Jun-ho wouldn\u2019t have been able to use Confession of the Dead. He\u2019d approved of them earlier for that very reason.At the very least, they won\u2019t hold me down.\u00a0They were actually a little helpful, and that was more than enough.\u201cAnyways, how are the other camps?\u201d Seo Mirae\u2019s face fell and her shoulders drooped.\u201c\u2026Really bad. Some parties dealt with it well, but most didn\u2019t. I think some parties dispersed completely to run away.\u201d\u201cThen we should hurry.\u201d\u201cHurry to do what?\u201dSeo Jun-ho wiped the blood off his blade with a towel before he responded.\u201cTo hunt.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of the Frozen PlayerCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Wild Forest (5)Four people were running through the dark forest. Considering that they were running through uneven ground, they were moving very fast.\u2026He\u2019s truly amazing,\u00a0Cha Min-woo thought as he watched Seo Jun-ho\u2019s back; the latter was in the lead.\u00a0It\u2019s a dark forest, and the ground isn\u2019t even flat. Yet his form is stable.That wasn\u2019t all. Seo Jun-ho was choosing easier paths so that the three others could follow. Assessing the environment was an important virtue for a player, and he proved to be exceptional.Cha Min-woo thought that he was like an onion.\u00a0Every time I think I understand him, he shows me a new side\u2026Suddenly, his Vita lit up with a notification. Seo Jun-ho stopped.\u201cIs it an SOS?\u201d\u201cLet me check.\u201d Cha Min-woo\u2019s eyes flickered as he checked the message. He looked up at Seo Jun-ho and nodded firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s an SOS. It came from 2km to the east.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t far. Let\u2019s go there first.\u201dSeo Jun-ho thought to himself as he looked for a path.\u00a0We have to save as many players as possible.Of course, this wasn\u2019t because he saw himself as some hero. Saving as many players as possible meant that clearing the Gate would be easier; it was the conclusion he had come to after objectively weighing the factors.There are one thousand dark elves in the Black Moss tribe.\u00a0Their numbers were too large for him to handle on his own.I\u2019m still human after all.\u00a0He needed to sleep, rest, and eat like any other person. He would need at least ten days to kill a thousand dark elves on his own.And that\u2019s only if I can use my full power.\u00a0It only applied if he could use Watchguard of Darkness and Frost. Of course, he couldn\u2019t use those skills when he was with Cha Min-woo\u2019s party, like right now.So the best way to clear the Gate with that handicap\u2026\u00a0Was using the other players. That\u2019s why Seo Jun-ho was running so fast through the forest at dawn.Tonight will be the turning point.\u00a0He thought that the dark elves\u2019 night attack was a double-edged sword. At least ten elves were sent to attack each of the 52 parties.\u00a0So if we kill them all\u2026They\u2019d be able to halve the enemy\u2019s manpower in one night. If they could do that, the dark elves would no longer be able to use guerilla tactics like they had tonight. And if they could halve the remaining number even further, the forest would no longer be safe for the elves.Clang, clang!The sound of weapons clashing came from in front of them. Perhaps it was because it was the early morning, but it was especially loud.\u201cJun-ho-nim!\u201d\u201cI heard it. I\u2019ll go ahead!\u201d As Seo Jun-ho accelerated, he seemed to stretch like taffy. Leaving the three people behind him, he took out a javelin from his inventory.\u201cAh,\u00a0s-save me!\u201dThe first thing he saw as he entered the clearing was a player pinned beneath a Wolfdog. The dark elf on top of it raised its sword high.Good timing.\u00a0He used his running speed to propel his javelin and threw it. It whistled through the air with a rough sound like a cannonball.Stab!\u00a0It pierced through the dark elf\u2019s head, causing it to fall. The Wolfdog turned around in confusion as it lost its owner, only to see the javelin hurling toward it. There was a flash of moonlight\u2014that was the last thing it saw.Seo Jun-ho pulled the javelin out of the Wolfdog\u2019s neck and took in his surroundings.\u201cThere are five dark elves and three Woldogs left.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 uhh?\u201d The player was covered in the dark elf and Wolfdog\u2019s blood, unable to process the situation. Seo Jun-ho glanced down at them and wordlessly ran toward where the other players were fighting.\u201cHuh? A-a player!\u201d\u201cBackup! They must\u2019ve come after seeing the SOS signal from another party!\u201dThe players were on the defensive, but their faces brightened.\u2013 \u201cKyaaaak!\u201dOn the other hand, the dark elves\u2019 expressions grew more sinister as their hunt was interrupted. They all turned to Seo Jun-ho, ignoring the other players. They wanted to take care of the most bothersome one first.\u2013 \u201cKreek!\u201d\u00a0Gripping its weapon, the leader threw the spear at Seo Jun-ho\u2019s heart with all its strength. It was much faster than most players could throw.\u201cThe spear\u2019s speed, aim, and power are all good\u2026 The only problem is the target.\u201dSeo Jun-ho didn\u2019t move and slowly raised one hand. Right before the spear hit him, he brought his hand down like lightning, breaking the weapon.Clatter!The dark elf\u2019s eyes widened as it watched its weapon break. Seo Jun-ho snatched one half of the spear from the air and stabbed it through his opponent\u2019s torso.\u201cYour spear is nice.\u201d\u2013 \u201cKak\u2026 kaak\u2026!\u201d\u00a0It couldn\u2019t even breathe.Seo Jun-ho\u2019s sword hung at his side as he walked forward. The dark elves instinctively took a step back, intimidated by his strength and confidence.\u201cDon\u2019t forget about us!\u201d\u201cThis is revenge for our comrades, fuckers!\u201d The surviving players attacked the dark elves\u2019 open backs. The battle ended anticlimactically, and Seo Jun-ho sheathed his sword.\u201cParty Leader Son?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s me.\u201d The man standing in front of the others raised his hand politely.\u201cWhat do your casualties look like?\u201d\u201c\u2026Our members that were on watch died. We woke up because of their screams\u2026\u00a0Guh,\u00a0we just ran away because we were still half-asleep. We lost three more teammates.\u201d A tear spilled over and he bit his lower lip hard enough to draw blood. He looked angry.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho understood those feelings all too well. The guilt of being unable to save his teammates would now become shackles.Seo Jun-ho wordlessly patted him on the shoulder. After letting it out, the man wiped away his tears with his sleeve.\u201cI didn\u2019t say this earlier, but thank you for helping us.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dAt that moment, Cha Min-woo and the others arrived at the clearing. They saw that it was over, and their faces became grim.\u201cWe were too late.\u201d\u201cHuff, huff\u2026\u00a0I ran as hard as I could\u2026\u201d Seo Mirae muttered, disappointed.\u201cWe\u2019re going east,\u201d Seo Jun-ho replied.\u201cEast\u2026?\u201d The party leader asked.\u201cYes. We\u2019re gonna head east, save other players, and hunt the dark elves.\u201d The reason was simple. The Black Moss tribe\u2019s stronghold was there. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing, we can take down the enemy together. What will you do?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThey couldn\u2019t even dream of avenging their teammates with only half the party left, but Seo Jun-ho was offering to avenge them together. The party leader made his choice.He didn\u2019t need to say anything. He thumped his fist against his chest twice, eyes full of venom.\u201cGood.\u201d That was enough for Seo Jun-ho. \u201cThen you guys should go north.\u201d\u201cNorth? We\u2019re splitting up?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d No matter how fast Seo Jun-ho could move, it would be impossible for him to cover the whole forest. That\u2019s how big the Wild Forest was.I need parties that will become my hands and feet.\u00a0He needed people to cover the north and west while he went east. Seo Jun-ho planned to give that role to his newly acquired players.The party leader finally spoke. \u201c\u2026We\u2019ve received great assistance from the new star of Korea.\u201d He picked up his fallen helm from the dirt, put it back on, and nodded. \u201cSo we will follow you. The Blue Whale party will head north.\u201dThey became Seo Jun-ho\u2019s first hand.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u201cHuff\u2026 huff\u2026\u201dA man collapsed down onto the forest floor. The hot sun beat down through the trees. There was a burning smell coming from his mouth.I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t keep going, even if I die\u2026He\u2019d been running for two days. Hunger and thirst were getting to him, and his trembling legs refused to move any longer; he was poisoned.Those fucking dark elves. They put poison on their arrowheads.\u00a0He lifted his shirt, checking the flesh at his side that had gone black. Death was right before him. In his poisoned state, it was impossible to outrun the Wolfdogs, which were quick and had sharp noses.\u201cDammit\u2026\u201d Tears started to spill over. He was scared.His team had been composed of players that averaged around level 28. If the dark elves had made a frontal attack in broad daylight, he wouldn\u2019t have been injured.\u201cThose dirty, cursed monsters!\u201dBut the enemy was crafty. They\u2019d used the cover of darkness to attack their camp at night. If it weren\u2019t for his sunbae\u2019s quick reaction, their entire party would\u2019ve been annihilated.At that moment, he heard the cries of Wolfdogs.I don\u2019t want to die! I\u2019m too young to die\u2026\u00a0But he didn\u2019t have the strength to run away. Tears streamed down his face as death approached. With shaky hands, he loaded a bullet into a handgun.\u201cIf I have to die now\u2026\u201d As the proud maknae of the Bravo party, he would take a few mutts down with him.As he finished loading the bullet, a Wolfdog came bounding out of the thicket and bit into his left arm. He raised the gun in his right hand and pulled the trigger.Bang!\u00a0The sound of a gunshot rang through the forest.\u201cYes!\u00a0Guh\u2026\u201d The Wolfdog fell. But as he was about to celebrate, the sound of dozens of Wolfdogs made him go pale. The bite he received was also deep.So this is how I die.\u00a0The hope drained from him, as if he were the last survivor in the last act of a play.But the Wolfdogs had started to sound more frantic.\u201cWh-what?\u201d He craned his neck, trying to see what was going on. He could hear people nearby.\u201cThe gunshot came from here\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Wolfdogs were chasing\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s the one we were looking\u2026\u201d\u201cShould be around here\u2026\u201dPeople\u2026!\u00a0His eyes went wide, but he couldn\u2019t make a sound. He opted to shoot another bullet into the air.Bang!\u00a0A moment later, the dense bushes were cut down, and a familiar face appeared.\u201cI found him! It\u2019s him! He\u2019s our party\u2019s maknae!\u201d\u201cS-sunbae\u2026\u201d As the man saw the face of his supposedly dead sunbae, he started to sob. \u201cSniff\u2026\u00a0How did you\u2026 I thought you were dead\u2026\u00a0Kuh\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy the hell would I die? And\u2026\u201d The sunbae turned, looking at the people who were approaching. It was the sound of dozens of players\u2019 footsteps. His eyes were fixed on the leader. \u201cThe person you should thank is him, not me.\u201d\u201cThat person\u2026 Who\u2026?\u201d It was the first time the hubae had seen one person lead so many people inside a Gate.\u201cPlayer Seo Jun-ho. But soon enough, people will be calling him by a sobriquet.\u201d\u201cA sobriquet\u2026? Players on the 1st floor can have one?\u201d\u201cMost don\u2019t, but outstanding players like him have superb titles.\u201d\u201cWhat do they call him?\u201dIn only two days, 152 players had been saved and 436 dark elves had been killed under Seo Jun-ho\u2019s command. The players that directly witnessed his achievements had started calling him by another name.\u201cHe saves allies and beheads his enemies in his black armor.\u201dThe Black Knight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The two entrances were shabby, but there were wooden fences and four guards on each side. There was a large blaze that was reminiscent of a campfire, and over eighty players were milling about, eating a late dinner.\u201cSlurp.\u201d\u00a0Seo Jun-ho was eating cup ramen for dinner. He ate a hearty meal with the kimchi he\u2019d brought in his inventory and looked around when he finished.There are 80 people here, and there are 72 players that are gathering in the north.A total of 152. It was the same number of players that were currently inside the Gate. Surprisingly, they had all decided to join him.But the situation doesn\u2019t look too good.\u00a0On the first night, 48 people had died. They\u2019d lost a fourth of their manpower, and it was starting to weigh on the survivors.\u2026It\u2019s good that they\u2019re as angry as they are nervous though.They\u2019d lost friends, sunbaes, hubaes, and lovers. The players who\u2019d lost their loved ones were sharpening the knife of vengeance. Even if he told them to launch a full-scale offensive when morning came, they would probably listen without hesitation.Seo Jun-ho calmed himself and organized his thoughts.\u00a0Right now, I\u2019m level 24.\u00a0He\u2019d killed 78 dark elves and Wolfdogs up \u2018til now, which was less than he\u2019d expected because he dispatched other players to clean them up. On top of that, he hadn\u2019t had the time to fight much because he prioritized rescuing other players.The remaining number of enemies is around 560.\u00a0With the number of players they had, all they had to do was kill four dark elves each. But that was only if they went \u2018hunting\u2019.\u00a0Tomorrow will be like a war.After he\u2019d saved the last survivor, the Bravo party\u2019s maknae, Seo Jun-ho had set up the outpost. He hadn\u2019t encountered a dark elf since then.They\u2019re starting to feel the losses.\u00a0The tribe chief was smart, so he wouldn\u2019t act rashly. He would probably lock down their stronghold and focus on naval forces. The players had to make the first move.The problem is\u2026\u00a0Seo Jun-ho looked at each player who was eating. They came from all different races, nationalities, guilds, and parties; some of them were also non-combatants like Seo Mirae.\u00a0Compared to the dark elves who move under their leader\u2019s orders, we just seem like a mob.They were obedient for now because they were thirsty for vengeance, but he didn\u2019t know how long that would last. And that wasn\u2019t the only problem.\u201cWe have to hurry up and clear it!\u201d\u201cI get what you\u2019re saying, but we can\u2019t all sacrifice ourselves for one person.\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s attention turned to the two groups that were arguing.\u201cDammit\u2026 We can\u2019t treat this without a medical specialist.\u201dThe Bravo party\u2019s maknae was on the brink of death. Choi Jin-pyo and other healers had tried to help him, but they were useless against the poison.\u201cWhat are you so scared of? If we combine with the other players, there\u2019ll be 150 of us! 150!\u201d\u201cWatch what you\u2019re saying. Who said I was scared?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ugh.\u201dSeo Jun-ho facepalmed. They were already disorganized, and now, there was infighting.It\u2019ll be impossible to clear the Gate by normal means\u2026One of the players noticed him staring. \u201cJun-ho-nim, what do you think?\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s pros and cons to either option. But\u2026\u201d As he spoke, dozens of players looked at him, \u201cIf possible, it would be best to clear it quickly.\u201d\u201cI knew it!\u201d The Bravo party\u2019s faces brightened, and the other group looked disappointed. Seo Jun-ho quickly continued.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s not simply for the sake of one person.\u201d It was the conclusion he had come to after pondering for a long time. He knew how large their forces were, but the others didn\u2019t.\u201cFirst of all, the number of dark elves left is around the number that attacked us the first night.\u201d\u201c\u2026May I ask why you think that?\u201d\u201cWe thought there would be around two hundred at most.\u201d\u201cOf course. You probably came to that conclusion after thinking about how dark elves act.\u201d They were extremely selfish and individualistic by nature. These players weren\u2019t beginners, so that had been the first thing they considered.But we\u2019re not dealing with normal dark elves.\u00a0The leader of the Black Moss tribe was extremely intelligent. His overwhelming power had united the self-centered dark elves; it was obvious from the unexpected attack on the first night. As Seo Jun-ho explained this, the other players slowly started to nod.\u201cThat makes sense\u2026 The dark elves in this forest were very different from what I knew about them.\u201d\u201cTheir coordinated attack means they\u2019re an organized group. As you\u2019ve said, this is likely thanks to their leader.\u201d\u201cIt reminds me of what Specter said in the past, \u2018You can study for college exams with a textbook, but you shouldn\u2019t do that for hunting.\u2019\u201d\u201cHe said that with these kinds of situations in mind.\u201d\u201cGates are always unpredictable.\u201d The players started to understand. Even though Seo Jun-ho had the lowest level, he\u2019d shown them the most.\u00a0That\u2019s why they say players only care about performance.One of the players spoke with a proud smile. \u201cSo you think that there are about five hundred dark elves left\u2026 How about the Woldogs?\u201d\u201cThere are no more left.\u201d\u201cHuh?!\u201d The players blinked, confused by his confidence. He wasn\u2019t some fortune teller, after all.\u201cThink about the last player we saved.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about our maknae?\u201d A member of the Bravo party quietly raised their hand. Seo Jun-ho nodded.\u201cWhat was chasing him?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 There were dozens of Woldogs. The dark elves had released them.\u201d\u201cCorrect. And those Woldogs were just pups.\u201d They hadn\u2019t been large enough for the dark elves to ride.\u201cThe fact that they were using young Woldogs in a pursuit means that they lost all their fully grown ones during the first attack.\u201d\u201cOhh\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d The players finally understood. They were also impressed: while they got distracted by the battle, Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t miss a single detail.\u201cRight now, the dark elves are probably locking down their stronghold and focusing on naval forces. But the longer this drags on, the worse it\u2019ll be for us.\u201d He was talking about the chronic problems for players. \u201cWe have limited rations, we can\u2019t fully rest, and our numbers will dwindle.\u201dThe enemy numbered over five hundred. The tribe chief wouldn\u2019t move for now, but that would change once he understood the situation.\u201cThey\u2019re going to keep ambushing us. There probably won\u2019t be any more large-scale surprise attacks\u2026\u201d\u201cBut they\u2019ll probably attack us every night with those poisoned arrows and run away.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll be exhausted because we can\u2019t rest\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd once they think they can win, they\u2019ll come streaming out.\u201dIt was good that these people caught on quickly. They started to understand the situation and what Seo Jun-ho meant.\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d\u201cNow that you say that, I think clearing the Gate as quickly as possible would be the best option.\u201dAs their opinions started to change, the hostility between the players dissipated.\u201cI\u2019m sorry about earlier. Our lives are also at risk here\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I apologize. We were thinking too much about ourselves.\u201dSeo Jun-ho changed the subject as the mood became somber. \u201cI\u2019ve sent scouts to do reconnaissance. It\u2019ll be nice once we have information about their village.\u201d Seo Jun-ho wasn\u2019t worried.\u00a0They\u2019ll find it tomorrow morning at the latest.He\u2019d purposely set up an outpost in the east because it was near the dark elves\u2019 village.\u201cRest up, everyone.\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded for Seo Mirae to follow. He led her to a quiet area.\u201cWhy did you call me?\u201d Seo Mirae tilted her head.\u201cCan you use your foresight skill now?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Yes. Would you like me to look?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded. Understanding, Seo Mirae stared at him with her piercing eyes. A moment later, she shook her head in amazement.\u201cWow, they found the village! We\u2019re going to fight them tomorrow around lunchtime.\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of them. Like you said, I didn\u2019t see any Woldogs, but there are around six hundred dark elves?\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u201dShe shivered and made an exaggerated expression as she hugged her arms.\u201cThere\u2019s a dark elf with a gloomy air around him\u2026 There are five other elves around him that are bigger than the others.\u201dHe knew about them.\u00a0The Dark Elven Knights that attend him.But this wasn\u2019t what Seo Jun-ho wanted to know. He already knew this all from seeing the dead\u2019s memories. He wanted to know about his own story.\u201cAnd lastly\u2026\u201d She looked at Seo Jun-ho with suspicion. \u201cYou\u2019re using something that looks like it\u2019s made of ice\u2026 Is it an artifact?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho kept a straight face, but he was unsettled.\u00a0\u2026Is the leader that strong? Strong enough that I have to use Frost?The reason he\u2019d asked her to look was because he wanted to avoid revealing his Frost skill to the public.\u201cThank you for your help. Please don\u2019t tell other players what you saw.\u201d\u201cYeah, sure.\u201dSeo Jun-ho was locked deep in thought as Seo Mirae left.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *As the sun rose, the reconnaissance team returned.

It\u2019s about two hours to the east if we walk.\u201d\u201cOoh, the Spoiler was right.\u201dThat was the good news.\u201c\u2026But their numbers are much bigger than we thought.\u201d\u201cWe only watched from afar, but there\u2019s at least five hundred of them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a hard battle.\u201dThat was the bad news.But Seo Jun-ho had expected this and told the other players, so they weren\u2019t surprised.

There were many people who wouldn\u2019t be standing here without him.Ignoring their stares, Seo Jun-ho twisted his hip as he stretched.\u201cAre the preparations complete?\u201d The question was directed at none other than a smiling Cha Min-woo. He\u2019d been the party leader when they first entered, but at some point, he\u2019d started acting as a sort of deputy; he even seemed to enjoy it.\u201cThere are three people that are out of commission and two non-combatants were assigned to protect them.

But they were naturally curious creatures. They wanted to know about the things they couldn\u2019t see, couldn\u2019t hear, and couldn\u2019t feel. That\u2019s why they made records.In the past, Seo Jun-ho had read the journal of someone who\u2019d entered an elves\u2019 village.The elves\u2019 village is a vertical structure with the World Tree at its center.But dark elf villages were completely different: there were no trees, flowers, or plants at all because they were abandoned by the World Tree. Their villages didn\u2019t even have a single weed.Where dark elves reside, all the plants around them wither up, the trees twist, and the fruit rots.\u00a0Those were the words of an elf who\u2019d received the curse of the World Tree. Coming into direct contact with light also gave them a terrible skin disease.So they run away to a place where they can avoid sunlight.\u00a0Underground. Seo Jun-ho had cleared some underground dark elf villages as Specter before.\u201cBut\u2026 this is my first time seeing something like this.\u201dDark elf villages usually had several entrances that led underground. The players sounded nervous.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn. There were a thousand elves living there, so I thought there\u2019d be at least twenty entrances\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy is there only one entrance?\u201dBecause the leader was smart. There was only one entrance leading down to the Black Moss tribe.\u201cThere\u2019s only one entrance, so we won\u2019t be caught from behind\u2026\u201d But to meet the chief, they would have to defeat all the dark elves underground. Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face wrinkled as he turned to the stone wall blocking the entrance. There, dark elf archers in thick cloaks were standing guard.\u201cFifty? It won\u2019t be too hard to get in, then.\u201d Fifty dark elves were nothing compared to the number of players they had. They were starting to bristle in anticipation.\u201cShall we kill them?\u201d\u201cAt this distance, I can kill them all without a sound.\u201d\u201cJust give us the sign.\u201dSeo Jun-ho had no reason to refuse, so he nodded. The players activated their skills all at once. A vine sprouted from the top of the entrance and stabbed the dark elves from behind, and the archers shot at the elves\u2019 heads and hearts.It took fifteen seconds to kill fifty enemies.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Seo Jun-ho stepped out of the forest and entered the clearing. The players looked around, on guard.\u201cIt\u2019s really quiet.\u201d\u201cOne might think it\u2019s abandoned.\u201d There wasn\u2019t even a single ant.\u201cSo\u2026 there are five hundred dark elves beneath our feet?\u201d Someone whispered. The other players shivered.\u201cLet\u2019s head in. Two scouts should guard the entrance.\u201d Seo Jun-ho appointed two players and went inside without hesitation. As he stepped down the stairs and looked around with his torch, he let out a sigh of relief.\u201c\u2026So that\u2019s why they don\u2019t need a lot of entrances.\u201dMost dark elves\u2019 underground villages were built like an anthole, but the Black Moss tribe had built theirs like the Mausoleum of the first Qin Emperor. Far away, around one kilometer in front of him, sat a giant dark elf on a throne made of a rotting tree.\u201cThat\u2019s the leader.\u201d\u00a0He\u2019s about a kilometer away. It\u2019s not that far, but\u2026\u00a0Five hundred dark elves stood between them like terracotta warriors; they were under the command of five Dark Elven Knights, who were much stronger.\u201cOh\u2026!\u201d\u201cI expected the fight to be messy because it would be like an ant cave\u2026 but seems like this will be a full-frontal battle.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never even heard of dark elves making a structure like this.\u201dThe players were starting to panic at the unexpected situation, but Seo Jun-ho spoke calmly,\u201cThis is a good thing.\u201d They looked at him with confused expressions.\u201cI was worried that the dark elves would use their manpower to surround us, but this is an open space without any obstacles.\u201d The hall was as straight and clear as a highway. \u201cWe\u2019ll take them head-on. We just need to take out four dark elves per person.\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked at the players as he finished with a challenging look in his eyes, as if asking if they were sure they could do that.A strange feeling started to bloom in the players as they saw his arrogant expression.What\u2019s this? I feel somehow disgusted.What level do you think I am? You really think I can\u2019t take four elves?Only four? I\u2019ll kill ten.They were eager and determined to prove their strength to their savior.\u201cPiece of cake! Let\u2019s do this!\u201d\u201cHey, all of you in my party will catch five elves. I\u2019ll go over the videos with each of you.\u201d\u201cFive?\u00a0Pfft,\u00a0lame. Those noobs are going for five, so we\u2019ll catch ten each!\u201d\u201cUwooohh!\u201dEven though they were all allies, they were from different parties and guilds. It was natural that there would be competition. Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t interrupt them.Was I the crazy one for thinking they couldn\u2019t do it?They started to cheer even louder.\u201cDo you guys think there will be elixirs?\u201dAn elixir was the dark elves\u2019 cure-all that could save a person who\u2019s on the brink of death. It was the biggest reason why the players had come to this Gate.The mention of the elixirs made the players light up; they were still hungry for revenge.\u2026Yes, elixirs. I completely forgot about that.When elixirs are discovered, they\u2019re usually distributed based on contribution level\u2026Wait, how many dark elves has my party killed?The players realized that the only thing that mattered was this battle. The parties that contributed the most right now would receive the most elixirs.Now they\u2019re starting to look useful.Seo Jun-ho smiled in satisfaction as he looked at each of the players\u2019 faces. They\u2019d looked nervous just a few minutes ago, but now their eyes were full of venom and bloodlust.There was no need to wait any longer.Shing!Seo Jun-ho pulled out his sword from the Association and raised it into the air. He didn\u2019t give a battle cry\u2014he was the first one to sprint to the enemy\u2019s front lines.Slice!\u00a0He cut off the heads of five dark elves. With his intrepid attack, the battle started.\u201cThat\u2019s unfair!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go guys!\u201d\u201cUwooooh!\u201dA switch flipped, and the players rushed into the battlefield, weapons raised.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *A hundred players and hundreds more monsters were locked in battle. It was a fierce contest where you couldn\u2019t even spare a glance for your comrades.In the middle of it all, Seo Jun-ho was enjoying it the most.Wow, just look at all the EXP I\u2019m getting.\u00a0He had the lowest level in the Gate, but he had the highest stats. So while others had to swing their weapon two or three times to kill an elf, he only needed one.I have the best sword skills too.\u00a0He was aiming precisely for pressure points. His sword was bloodthirsty. If he aimed it at people, he would become a powerful villain, but the blade only pointed at monsters.Slice! Slice!Perhaps that was why Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t slow. If a dark elf came at him with a sword, he cut down their weapon. If they came at him with a shield, he cut down their shield. His weapon\u2019s sword ki enabled him to do what was seemingly impossible.A sword ki? And it looks more perfected than mine does.I heard that it hasn\u2019t even been three months since he debuted\u2026Is that the result of natural talent?It was a near-perfect sword ki that even made others jealous.Slice! Slice!There wasn\u2019t a single elf that could block Seo Jun-ho and his deep black sword aura. Even as the dark elves swarmed him like bugs, he didn\u2019t slow down. Riding the high of the battle, he actually started to get faster. The players that followed him in the hopes of slaying more dark elves started to tire.When in the world will he start to slow down?He\u2019s not gonna go directly to the tribe chief like this, is he?Dammit, I\u2019m starting to reach my limit\u2026Fuck, slow down.As their fatigue started to catch up to them, players started to fall behind Seo Jun-ho one by one.\u201cGuh!\u201d But Cha Min-woo continued to follow him with a fierce determination; he fought off dark elves coming from all directions while sweating profusely.Seo Jun-ho stabbed an elf that was coming at him from the left as he spoke. \u201cYou\u2019re at your limit. Fall back.\u201d\u201cB-but\u2026\u201d Cha Min-woo swallowed and looked shakily at the direction where the tribe chief was. \u201cAre you planning to get to him by yourself? That\u2019s crazy.\u201dSeo Jun-ho smirked, unconcerned.\u201cYou don\u2019t know me well enough yet. I do crazy things quite often.\u201d And he often got scolded by Deok-gu and the others because of it.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Cha Min-woo lost his train of thought and shook his head, defeated.I knew it was selfish of me to fight by his side or even follow him from behind\u2026\u00a0But it was hard for him to even watch from afar.\u00a0I still have a long way to go.He realized he was at his limit, and instead made a promise.\u201cI won\u2019t fall behind next time.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll have to work hard to keep that.\u201d\u201cJust wait and see. I\u2019ll train as hard as I can.\u201d Cha Min-woo gave a determined expression and turned around. Seo Jun-ho watched him disappear with a pleased smile.I like the look in his eyes. A person with a firm goal will quickly become strong.\u00a0He was already looking forward to the next time they would meet.Seo Jun-ho turned around and checked his own status. He was at level 24, and his EXP bar was around 94% full. Every dark elf gave him 0.25%, so he only had to kill 24 more to reach level 25.\u201cBut there\u2019s a faster way.\u201dSeo Jun-ho turned to the ones that were walking toward him. They were about one head taller than the average dark elf.\u201cSince they\u2019re Dark Elven Knights, shouldn\u2019t they give me more EXP?\u201dThere were only five of them in the Black Moss tribe. They surrounded him.\u201cWow, all five at once? Your leader must think highly of me.\u201d Buzzing with excitement, Seo Jun-ho muttered to himself as he stabbed his sword into the ground. \u201cI should thank him properly.\u201dHe pulled out a black sheathed sword from his inventory. The item that the one-and-only Kwon Noya had hammered himself.He pulled out Black Dragon Fang to feed on its enemies for the first time. It let out a cry, as if impatient for blood.\u201cDamn, this guy\u2019s impatient.\u201dThat didn\u2019t mean he hated it though. He was impressed by how compatible they were.\u201cHow do you understand your owner so well?\u201d He was desperate and impatient to wield it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of the Frozen PlayerCH 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Black Moss Chief (1)If you asked most people what Dark Elven Knights were, they would just say that they\u2019re a little taller than normal dark elves. It was true that that was their only physical difference, but Seo Jun-ho knew all too well that there was more than that.Before they became corrupted, they were the protectors of the kingdom: the Elven Knights.In elven tradition, a strong tribal sword technique meant more spiritual power. But when the elves became corrupted, their spiritual contracts were terminated.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for me.\u201d At his current state, he wasn\u2019t sure he could handle spiritual attacks. But the \u2018knights\u2019 were only good at swordplay.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone who was better with the sword than me.\u201dShing.On top of that, he had the outstanding Black Dragon Fang and Black Armor. He didn\u2019t even dream about losing.\u201cSeems like the stage is set,\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered. The area around him had emptied out at some point. An arena had been created for him and the five Dark Elven Knights, who wore skulls of beasts on their heads.Well, even if dark elves lack intellect, they still have their instincts.\u00a0In fact, their primal instincts were sharper. They realized that they would die if they interfered with the fight, and that\u2019s why they\u2019d backed away.Seo Jun-ho gestured at the Dark Elven Knights with his finger. It was a childish gesture, like the neighborhood hyung was calling over the kids from the taekwondo school.\u201cHey, come at me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEven though they\u2019d thrown their honor away, they had once been knights of a kingdom. They growled as they unsheathed their swords from their waists.* * *It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been up against elven swordplay,\u00a0Seo Jun-ho thought as he watched the Dark Elven Knights approach. Whether they be orcs, elves, or dwarves, each race had different beliefs, values, and desires; they also had their own principles when it came to combat.And elves value moderation and elegance.\u00a0But that only pertained to normal elves. Dark elven swordplay was quite different.\u00a0Naturally, if you gain power, you\u2019ll want to use it.Perhaps it was because of the power they had received after betraying the World Tree, but they thought elegant movements to be restricting. Thus, their sword style deteriorated.Seo Jun-ho narrowly dodged the swords that came at him, making them hit the ground, ceiling, and wall instead.While elves move as one with their sword, the Dark Elven Knights just swing them around with as much strength they can muster.It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that one hit could break all your bones. If Seo Jun-ho allowed one to land on him, the battle would end.\u201c\u2026Mm.\u201d His body shook, but not from fear or anxiety.\u00a0When\u2019s the last time I\u2019ve felt this much adrenaline?Some might call him crazy, but he enjoyed the thrill of danger.\u201cI\u2019m excited! Five times more than usual!\u201d He licked his lips as he watched the knights.They\u2019ll be a good first meal for him.Seo Jun-ho glanced down at Black Dragon Fang and prepared to attack. He wasn\u2019t the type to run away.Woooosh!Even though he held a sword, the sound it made was like a bat. Seo Jun-ho stepped forward and lowered his head, a sword narrowly missing the back of it.Slice!\u00a0The arm of a knight flew into the air. It let out a sharp cry and started to back away.\u201cNo, no. Can\u2019t do that.\u201d Seo Jun-ho stepped hard on its foot.\u201cWe were playing by your rules earlier. Now it\u2019s my turn.\u201dBlack Dragon Fang\u2019s burning sword ki stabbed through its stomach. Seo Jun-ho swung his arm upward, a rip resounding from the knight\u2019s body as blood flooded from it.\u201cHm, it\u2019s a little disappointing if this is all they have.\u201d Black Dragon Fang vibrated in his hand, as if agreeing with its owner.But other than that, I really like this sword.\u00a0He looked down at it affectionately. It cut through the Dark Elven Knights\u2019 flesh like tofu and sliced them like paper.\u201cYes, this is the sword.\u201d He hadn\u2019t been dissatisfied with his sword from the Association, but once he wielded Black Dragon Fang, he realized what he\u2019d been missing. It made his old sword seem like a shabby club in comparison.\u2013 \u201cGrrrr\u2026\u201d\u00a0The knights started to growl.\u201cHuh?\u201d Suddenly, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face fell. The players\u2019 situation didn\u2019t look too great.Well, they\u2019re all around level 30\u2026 Even if they\u2019ve gone on raids before, it\u2019s probably their first time in an all-out war.It was impressive that they\u2019d lasted this long. They\u2019d been fending off the dark elves so he could fight the knights. As Seo Jun-ho understood the situation, he realized what he had to do.\u201cGah!\u201d\u201cAre there any healers available?! We need support!\u201d\u201cAvailable? We don\u2019t have enough!\u201dThe continuous stream of enemies was starting to make the players slow.\u201cDammit, they\u2019re not even that strong\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s just too many of them.\u201d\u201cFucking roaches.\u201dThere was a big difference between one person killing four monsters and one hundred people killing four hundred monsters. The players who\u2019d gone all-out in the beginning had started to realize this too late.\u201cThose bastards are fighting in rotations and taking time to recover.\u201d\u201cDammit! If we could just take them in a more open area, we could take them all out in an instant!\u201dThe dark elves were moving around like soldiers. They would change formations to fight the players. They\u2019d taken out over a hundred dark elves up until now and hadn\u2019t been in much danger, but they were starting to feel the pressure.If it keeps going like this, we\u2019ll run out of energy first.One round. We have to push through one round before they can switch.\u00a0The players exchanged glances.Claaaang!There was a loud roar from dozens of meters in front of them, and the dark elves\u2019 movements started to become strange.\u201cHuh? What? What are they doing? Why are they acting like this all of a sudden?\u201dThe dark elves had suddenly started pushing at each other, and their attacks became weaker. The players didn\u2019t know why, but they cheered.If there\u2019s an opening, we\u2019ll take it.But I\u2019m a little nervous because we don\u2019t know the reason why they\u2019re acting like this.What\u2019s going on? They were fighting frustratingly well\u2026It didn\u2019t take long for their questions to be answered; the loud noises started to get closer.\u201cWh-what\u2019s that sound?\u201d\u201cIt was coming from far away before\u2026\u201dIt was getting closer. A few minutes later, they spotted the source of the sound.Crash!\u201cHup!\u201dFour tall dark elves were carrying large swords and chasing Seo Jun-ho like they were trying to kill him. He nimbly wove his way through, narrowly avoiding them. Every time they missed, they hit their surroundings instead.Boom!A roar exploded from them.But that wasn\u2019t all.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKyaak!\u201d\u00a0The dark elves were starting to act irrationally, not caring if their own allies died or not. Seo Jun-ho would briefly clash swords, and then slip into the ranks of the dark elves, as if to mock them.Slice! Slice!While he dodged the Dark Elven Knights\u2019 brutal attacks, the dark elves\u2019 formations fell apart. In front of them were the players, and behind them were the monster Seo Jun-ho and the knights that didn\u2019t care about their lives. The dark elves had decided that the players were the best option and had started to blindly rush forward.A middle-aged veteran watched him, eyes sparkling. He realized why Seo Jun-ho was fighting so recklessly. \u201cHe\u2019s doing that because of us.\u201dHe was helping them with the dark elves before there could be casualties. The other players looked at him in disbelief.\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201cNo matter how amazing the Black Knight is, do you think he\u2019d be able to think that through with those monsters behind him?\u201d\u201cThen why do you think he\u2019s fighting so inefficiently? Because he\u2019s not skilled enough?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe players were silent. They\u2019d seen with their own eyes how outstanding Seo Jun-ho was.He was born with it.He might be one of those players that only come every hundred years\u2014like Kim Woo-joong or Shin Sung-hyun.If his skill were B-grade instead of D-grade\u2026 things would be vastly different.No one doubted his skill. They started to see his movements in a new light.He\u2019s intentionally going to places where the dark elves are concentrated.He\u2019s messing up their formation\u2026 Wait, he\u2019s killing dark elves too?If that were me, I would\u2019ve died in an instant.It didn\u2019t take long for them to realize that the veteran was right. Their faces became red.The monsters following him are probably Dark Elven Knights. I\u2019ve never seen them in publications before.They\u2019re much stronger than normal dark elves.He\u2019s been paying attention to the backlines while fighting them\u2026How pathetic must we have seemed for him to come help us.Damn, this is embarrassing.They were all certified as pro players by their respective Associations and had pride in their skills.\u201cWe can\u2019t just stand idly by. We\u2019re not that pathetic.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not just setting the table, he\u2019s spoon-feeding us.\u201d\u201cWe weren\u2019t strong enough, but we still have our pride.\u201dA fierce fighting spirit was ignited in the players once more. The dark elves were in disarray.He\u2019s doing everything for us\u2026 But this much should be enough.Seeing the players\u2019 determined expressions, Seo Jun-ho fell back, luring the knights away. There were roughly four hundred dark elves left, whose battle formations were completely destroyed.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIf you guys can\u2019t win even after I did all that, you\u2019ll all have to kneel in the hall and do some self-reflection,\u201d he muttered as he aimed his weapon at his opponent\u2019s temple. He swung his sword with a vigor.He pulled it out without even needing to look down.\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I know you worked hard to chase me around.\u201dHe was going to give them a small reward for their efforts.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you painlessly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - The Black Moss Chief (2)[Translator \u2013 Castor][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Return of the Frozen Player 052The Black Moss Chief (2)\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA dark elf sat on a throne made of a rotting foxglove tree. He rested his chin in his left hand as he watched the battlefield calmly. Hundreds of humans were locked in combat with his forces, but he was only focused on one man.\u2013 Human\u2026The human was incredible. Even when confronted with five Dark Elven Knights, he did not hesitate. He used them to shatter their own allies\u2019 formations, playing around with them as an adult would entertain children.\u2013 \u2026I can\u2019t watch.\u00a0He closed his eyes. It was painful to see how ugly and beastly the dark elves had become. At some point, they had been extremely beautiful and intelligent.\u2013 But that is a memory of a foregone time.He had been a High Elf that led the Azure Moss tribe in a valley on a small branch of the World Tree.High Elf Rodomir. That had been his name during his golden years. He couldn\u2019t bear to think of it any longer.At some point, the human had reached him, having taken care of the Dark Elven Knights.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time seeing a tribe with so many dark elves. You\u2019re like cockroaches.\u201dRodomir pulled himself up from the throne. His face was unpleasant as he gripped his sheathed sword and approached the human.\u2013\u00a0This time too. He speaks a language I don\u2019t know but understand.\u2013\u00a0\u201cDo not speak of those cursed beings in front of me,\u201d\u00a0he said.\u201cYou hate cockroaches even though you\u2019re the guardians of nature? Oh, is it because you\u2019re a dark elf?\u201d Seo Jun-ho shrugged.His opponent was speaking in Elvish, but language barriers didn\u2019t exist in the Gates. He could communicate with intelligent beings like the Frost Queen.Shing.Rodomir unsheathed his sword.\u2013\u00a0\u201cI won\u2019t speak any longer. Raise your sword, human.\u201dRodomir was willowy. Based on his physique, he looked weaker than the Dark Elven Knights.But he\u2019s strong.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho had seen how he fought through Confession of the Dead. He\u2019d walked a depraved path after betraying the World Tree, but he wasn\u2019t consumed by his power. The tribe chief Rodomir did not forget his elven sword skills.I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll be good or bad\u2026 But dark elves are physically much\u00a0 stronger than humans.And his current opponent was the one who led them. It was hard to tell how much power was packed into his small body.Seo Jun-ho waved the tip of his sword.\u201cCome at me.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026Tsk, arrogant human.\u201dRodomir\u2019s blade cut through the air like hot wind.Clang!Seo Jun-ho barely blocked it with his sword, and took three steps back. He felt a burning pain in the hand that held Black Dragon Fang.He\u2019s not just fast, he\u2019s strong. And\u2026 he knows how to breathe well.He\u2019d taken down countless enemies by interrupting their breath, but it wouldn\u2019t work on his current opponent. Seo Jun-ho had to rely on his physical strength and other skills to defeat him.I\u2019m starting to get curious. Who is this guy?He scanned Rodomir\u2019s stance: his back was straight and his shoulders open. He recognized it.I\u2019ve seen it in a book. It\u2019s the basic stance in the Elven Sword Technique, Genia Manus.The Elven Sword Technique was called the Sword of Nature because it drew power from the environment. But that was only when the user was an elf that was loved by nature. For a dark elf that had the strength of neither spirits nor nature, it was a huge detriment.His suspicions were confirmed when they crossed swords.\u201c\u2026So that\u2019s why you changed it.\u201d The sword technique his opponent was using originated from Genia Manus, but there were subtle differences. It was an original style that played off the strengths of a dark elf.\u201cHow interesting.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cSpeak with your sword, human.\u201dRodomir\u2019s attack made a long cut in the ground. He was much more destructive than the Dark Elven Knights.Rumble!The crack on the ground was like a cliff.\u201cIsn\u2019t this your house?\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cIt does not matter,\u201d\u00a0Rodomir said calmly. He rushed Seo Jun-ho with his sword.Clang-clang-clang!Sixteen clashes in the blink of an eye.Strange.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho tilted his head.The tribe chief was obviously strong and fast, but he didn\u2019t feel the overwhelming strength that he\u2019d seen in the memories.Is it because it was from the perspective of a dark elf?Seo Jun-ho had taken the lead in all sixteen clashes.If it keeps going like this, I can end this in five minutes\u2026Something felt off. Seo Jun-ho raised his sword, but Rodomir\u2019s eyes were focused on the scene behind him.\u2013 \u201cKyaaak!\u201d\u2013 \u201cKrr! Krrrk!\u201dThe dark elves were dying under the rush of players.They were his tribesmen. Rodomir remembered each of their names and faces.\u2013 Those fools followed their cruel leader until the very end\u2026He squeezed the sword in his hand. All he wanted to do was return to those peaceful days and make things right again.But no mortal can undo what they have done.\u2013 There\u2019s only one thing I can do.To meet one thousand enemies and defeat them all. That was the \u2018deal\u2019 that he and the creature from the gates of hell had made.\u2013 I will not let myself be defeated. Victory is the only option.Rodomir knew what Seo Jun-ho was thinking: that he would soon fall.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026To restore the glory of the past!\u201dPitch-black energy poured from Rodomir\u2019s sword. The cave rumbled from the tremendous power.A sword aura\u2026? No, that\u2019s not it.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho had been watching closely. He shook his head.He could sense magic from the sword, but the flow wasn\u2019t consistent. A sword aura could only be completed if you understood and controlled your magic perfectly, but the flow of magic from the tribe chief\u2019s sword was jagged.\u2013 \u201cGuh\u2026!\u201d\u00a0Rodomir gripped his right wrist with his other hand. Deep red veins crawled up his arms, looking as if they would burst at any second. Seo Jun-ho realized what was happening to him.\u201cIs it a second phase?\u201d He muttered.At that moment, his intuition screamed danger.\u2013\u00a0\u201cGuaaaahhh!\u201d\u00a0Rodomir let out a roar and ran toward him. The pressure and energy he emanated was incomparable to before.So that\u2019s what it was.Seo Jun-ho realized instinctively that this was what he\u2019d seen in the dark elves\u2019 memories.\u201cHup!\u201cBlack Dragon Fang swiftly blocked his opponent\u2019s attack, but he was thrown into the air.Crash!\u00a0In an instant, he was embedded into the wall of the underground cave.\u201cGah\u2026\u00a0bleh!\u201d\u00a0Seo Jun-ho, who fell to the ground, shook his head to awaken his mind and spat out the stones in his mouth. There was no time to think.Claaang!Because Rodomir didn\u2019t give him time to do so.He flung his body to avoid a hit to his chest and stood up, a pistol in his left hand.Bang! Bang-bang!\u00a0He fired three bullets.\u2013\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s cheap!\u201d\u00a0Though he said that, Rodomir had cut the three bullets cleanly out of the air and hit the ground once more.I can\u2019t even stall for time\u2026!Seo Jun-ho scowled and reflexively swung Black Dragon Fang in time to block Rodomir\u2019s sword.Clang!Seo Jun-ho\u2019s black sword ki and Rodomir\u2019s mysterious black energy. They were both shrouded in a black aura, but it was clear which one was superior.He\u2019s pushing me back!Seo Jun-ho heard a grinding sound from his blade. The energy of his opponent\u2019s sword was much stronger and sharper.Black Dragon Fang is a good sword, so I can hold out for now\u2026\u00a0But no matter how good it was, it wouldn\u2019t be able to last long.I can\u2019t hide my other skills any longer.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t use a sword aura with the amount of magic he currently had. Now was the time to use either Frost or Watchguard of Darkness.But so many people are watching\u2026While Seo Jun-ho was trying to make up his mind, Rodomir suddenly kicked him. It landed on his side, making him fly 10 meters back.\u201cKuh\u2026 Cough! Cough!\u201dBlood poured from his mouth.Dammit\u2026\u00a0It was the worst case scenario: two of his ribs had been broken with a single kick.When was the last time this happened?He\u2019d faced a lot of crucial moments after being awoken from the ice, but this was the first time he\u2019d been directly injured.Was it the Frost Queen\u2026\u00a0No, his ribs had been fine then. He internally pondered to himself as he got back up.\u201c\u2026Dammit.\u201d His face fell. The damage was so bad, he saw two Rodomirs.But he couldn\u2019t run away.The players were still fighting\u2026\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dBacks started to fill his sight. There was leather armor, heavy armor, light armor, and even plate armor.It was a rare sight of unity between players. They stood in front of Seo Jun-ho like a wall.\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard to fight the monster alone.\u201d\u201cRest for now.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll get a stomach ache if you eat everything alone. Leave some for us.\u201dThe party leaders and Cha Min-woo faced Rodomir and the ominous energy that surrounded him.\u201cDon\u2019t, he\u2019s danger\u2014ugh!\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face scrunched from the pain at his side. Suddenly, there was a cool feeling over his wound, and the pain started to fade.\u201cYour ribs are broken. At this level, it\u2019ll take at least thirty minutes for it to heal.\u201dHe looked to his side to see Choi Jin-pyo, the healer from Cha Min-woo\u2019s party. His hands were at his side, awash in light.\u201cI\u2019ll help too. Then it\u2019ll be twenty.\u201d\u201cMy healing skill is low, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201dTwo more healers crouched by Seo Jun-ho\u2019s side. The pain started to fade faster.At this rate, it\u2019ll take ten\u2026 no, it\u2019ll only take five minutes for my bones to stitch back together.Seo Jun-ho weakly tried to express his gratitude, but Choi Jin-pyo waved him off.\u201cEven though we were all the way in the back, we saw everything we needed to.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cYou, fighting alone. Jun-ho-nim took care of those five monstrous dark elves and pushed back the tribe chief in no time.\u201d\u201cIt inspired us.\u201d\u201cYou fought so hard despite only having debuted three months ago. We couldn\u2019t just stand by. It would be humiliating.\u201d\u201cIn the end, well\u2026 We can help you after reducing the dark elves to around a hundred.\u201dHe liked the look in their eyes.Seo Jun-ho blushed and scratched his cheek.\u201cOuch.\u201d\u201cHey, stay still. Stop moving, you\u2019re injured.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sorry.\u201dSeeing Seo Jun-ho pout at Choi Jin-pyo, the players around him laughed. It was such a human expression.\u201cThen, once we kill that guy\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, the battle will be over.\u201dThey all looked exhausted, but their eyes shone brightly.But Rodomir wasn\u2019t planning on letting them win.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRodomir quietly took in the eighteen players that formed a wall around him. If they all had the same level of skill as the human from before, it would be difficult.But once he assessed each person, he felt relieved.\u2013\u00a0\u201cGood.\u201dThe humans in front of him posed no threat to him at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It might\u2019ve been different if the others weren\u2019t busy fighting off the leftover dark elves, but they didn\u2019t have any other choice.\u201cSo let\u2019s just survive the next ten minutes.\u201d\u201cIs there any reason why it\u2019s ten minutes?\u201d Cha Min-woo asked.\u201cI heard from the back lines that Seo Jun-ho will recover in around ten minutes.\u201dThe players looked determined. Defeating Rodomir on their own would be impossible, but holding out for ten minutes was much more doable.Ten minutes\u2026\u00a0Cha Min-woo clenched his fist. He didn\u2019t make the mistake of looking back: if he did, Seo Jun-ho would see the fear in his eyes.\u00a0We can do it. If it\u2019s just ten minutes, we can hold out\u2026\u00a0Cha Min-woo chanted the sentence under his breath.\u201cDodge, you idiot!\u201d A player next to him pulled him by his shoulder. As he spun, he felt the vibrations of the cave in his bones.An attack!Rodomir had made the first move. With a single strike of his sword, the wall formed by eighteen people was broken.\u201cUgh.\u201dSomehow, no one was hurt. Cha Min-woo gripped his sword.\u201cThank you for saving me! And I\u2019m sorry!\u201d He yelled.\u201cGet it together!\u201d\u201cRoger!\u201dThe eighteen players all moved in different directions, but they all had the same goal.That ahjussi said we just need to hold out for ten minutes, but\u2026They were putting their lives on the line. It would be unfair if all their opponent lost was time.He should gamble his life too.They had their pride as players. Nineteen figures twisted and fought, aiming for each others\u2019 lives.* * *Rodomir was starting to feel uneasy.\u2013 They were like ants before\u2026When he\u2019d assessed them before the battle, he hadn\u2019t been worried. He\u2019d been confident that he\u2019d be able to kill them all in five minutes, if it even took that long.But as soon as the battle started, things went in an unexpected direction.\u2013\u00a0\u201cYou insects!\u201dHis enemies were relentless. If he got rid of one, three would go and help; in that time, the rest of them would attack him.\u2013\u00a0\u201cWhy\u2026\u201d\u00a0Why are they fighting so hard?Rodomir scowled and paused his attack, staring at the humans. When he saw the fierce look in their eyes, he realized that these disgraceful pests were trying to\u00a0hunt\u00a0him.\u2013\u00a0\u201cHa\u2026 haha\u2026?\u201d Their level of effort makes a big difference.If they were smart, they\u2019d run with their tail between their legs, but they were actually trying to kill him.He felt disappointed in himself when he couldn\u2019t kill them all immediately.\u2013\u00a0Why do I feel so uneasy?\u00a0He clenched and unclenched his fist. He hadn\u2019t realized it, but he wasn\u2019t using his full power. Rodomir looked past the players.\u2013\u00a0\u2026That human.\u00a0The human that he\u2019d first crossed swords with was still glaring at him from afar as he sat on the ground. It was because his injuries were starting to heal.\u2013\u00a0\u201cFufu,\u201d\u00a0Rodomir laughed. It was funny.\u00a0I am a fallen being and burned my own soul away\u2026 and I\u2019m wary of that human?\u00a0How could it not be funny?His laughter didn\u2019t last long. The amusement left his face, his eyes as cold as ice. He swung his sword at the players\u2019 heads again. It was the same trajectory as before, so they reacted the same way, but the results were different.\u201cAhhhh!\u201d A player screamed as the attack cut through his shield and chest. Other players quickly sent him to the back as he gasped for breath, the healers attending to him.\u201cIt was the same attack as before though?\u201d\u201c\u2026Is he finally starting to get serious?\u201dAn alarm went off in the players\u2019 heads. The battle had been going on for seven minutes.There\u2019s still three minutes left.We\u2019ve survived thus far. We\u2019ll survive for three minutes more, somehow\u2026That\u2019s what they thought, but it took three seconds for them to realize they were wrong.No one could block Rodomir\u2019s strike when he attacked for real. He was the ruler of the battlefield, controlling it as he pleased. If he wanted to kill something, he killed. If he wanted to destroy something, he destroyed.\u201cKeep going\u2026 Keep going\u2026\u201d The veteran player whispered hoarsely as he stood back up. His arm was bent the wrong way and hung pitifully.\u201cHoo, hoo.\u201dHe was also a human who felt fear. He wasn\u2019t some noble, self-sacrificing hero either. But he still wouldn\u2019t lower his sword.No one can defeat him except player Seo Jun-ho.\u00a0He hadn\u2019t thought that before the battle. Telling his teammates that they only had to survive for ten minutes was meant to be a morale boost. He\u2019d thought that they\u2019d be able to take on one guy if they joined with the rest of their forces.\u00a0But that\u2019s not true.He wasn\u2019t just \u2018one guy\u2019. The real hunt would start when the other dark elves were annihilated and he was the only one left. He was strong enough to be a one-man army.If the Gate was a little older, he thought, Rodomir would be the boss monster of a 1-star Gate.The Association grants a star to the Gate of a monster who has killed ten thousand players.\u00a0The only reason this Gate hadn\u2019t received one was because they were the first group to attempt to clear it. The veteran thought that Rodomir was more than strong enough to kill ten thousand players.\u201cHuff\u2026 huff.\u201dThe only sounds were the players\u2019 harsh breathing. They could sense the despair in the others\u2019 breaths.\u2013\u00a0\u201cIs that all?\u201dRodomir narrowed his eyes. He looked at them in disgust, as if they were insects. The look in his eyes only angered the players, making them use their weapons to prop themselves up.\u2013\u00a0\u201cSo you still have some strength left.\u201dIt didn\u2019t really matter. Whether it took a hundred or a thousand times to force them to kneel, they would eventually stop getting up. But that time didn\u2019t come.\u2013 \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRodomir\u2019s pupils dilated, eyes fixed on a certain human walking toward him.\u201cYou know what they say in movies at times like this?\u201d Seo Jun-ho asked. He finished stretching, as if to show that his ribs were fine.\u201cA challenger approaches!\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t the 2010s.\u201d\u201cCringe.\u201d\u201cJun-ho-nim, that\u2019s a little\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho\u2019s face fell. \u201cWh-what are you saying? All the movies I\u2019ve seen have lines like that.\u201dWas he behind the times? Did it sound like a dad joke?Seo Jun-ho cleared his throat as his face started to turn red. \u201cForget it. Leave this guy to me and go support the main forces.\u201d\u201cCan you really take him on alone?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s really strong\u2026\u201dThey seemed reluctant. Seo Jun-ho had basically told them to run away, but they wanted to protect their pride and honor.\u201cLet\u2019s fight together.\u201d\u201cThat would be better. After crossing swords with him, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a monster one person can fight alone.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be your fault if you die while fighting alone.\u201dWhy are they like this?\u00a0Seo Jun-ho\u2019s frustration was starting to show on his face. While he was getting treated, he\u2019d thought about how he could use his skills without arousing suspicion. The solution was obvious, but the others wouldn\u2019t play long.\u2013\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s no need to ponder.\u201d\u00a0Rodomir gave him his answer. He raised his sword high over his head.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll just kill you all at once.\u201d\u00a0He swung with all his strength. The force of his strike was like a small explosion.Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes glinted.\u201cHey!\u201d\u201cPlayer Seo Jun-ho!\u201dRight before Rodomir\u2019s sword swung, Seo Jun-ho had stabbed him. A tremendous dark energy exploded between them.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKuh!\u201d\u201cWh-what?\u201dThe players had been thrown back and started to realize what happened. A black dome had formed in front of them; it spread across the area. Cha Min-woo banged on its surface.\u201cJun-ho-nim! Are you alright?!\u201dA faint voice came from inside.\u201cThis\u2026 The bastard used\u2026 not the one I did\u2026 trapped\u2026 quite\u2026\u201d\u201cDid he fall for the enemy\u2019s trap?\u201d Unable to hold back his frustration, Cha Min-woo attacked the dome several times to no avail.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d The veteran player had approached Cha Min-woo and sat cross-legged on the ground. He stared at the dome bitterly. \u201cI don\u2019t know who will step out once it\u2019s over\u2026 but all we can do now is believe and wait.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re right.\u201dThe players sat in front of the large dome and waited.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u2013\u00a0\u201cWhat is\u2026 this?\u201d\u00a0Rodomir was uncharacteristically disoriented. He looked around the pitch-black darkness that surrounded him.\u201cThis is Curtain of Darkness.\u201d Seo Jun-ho stroked the wall affectionately. \u201cI usually make it cover a small area to have private conversations, but sometimes I have fights in here. Just like now.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026So it\u2019s your skill.\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cWere you hiding your true strength?\u201d\u00a0Rodomir growled. Seo Jun-ho shrugged.The darkness around him had started to waver, and ice had started to form.\u201cYour anger makes me feel like I\u2019m the boss monster,\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered as he unsheathed Black Dragon Fang. He tried to imagine it the other way around; if he\u2019d landed a near-fatal wound on a boss monster and it retreated to recover, only to come back with two new skills\u2026\u201cMan, that second phase would be a pain in the ass.\u201dOf course, that wasn\u2019t the case for Seo Jun-ho because it wasn\u2019t his situation.\u201cSo this is how bosses feel? It\u2019s fun,\u201d he laughed gleefully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of the Frozen PlayerCH 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Price of a Gamble (2)Ever since Seo Jun-ho acquired his Frost skill, he\u2019d pondered how to use it. At first, he\u2019d used it to reinforce his equipment. He\u2019d had fun using Watchguard of Darkness in a similar manner. But it felt like a waste to only use it like that. He kept thinking that there would be a better way to use it. Eventually, he\u2019d returned to the roots of his fighting style.My fighting style is already complete from when I was Specter.Players around the world had flattered him by calling him a \u2018Completed Player\u2019 because of how flawless his combat skills were. Even Seo Jun-ho thought that the only thing he lacked was magic.\u2026But I realized that was wrong while fighting the Frost Queen.Even though he\u2019d been the victor, there were many parts he regretted.Watchguard of Darkness is the strongest spear.\u00a0No matter how strong the opponent\u2019s armor was, it didn\u2019t matter as long as he could land a clean hit. Because of that, he enjoyed fights where he could corner his opponents in one direction. As long as he made a proper hit, the tides of the fight would turn in an instant.But that didn\u2019t work on opponents at a similar level as me.\u00a0A strong enemy like the Frost Queen didn\u2019t just take his hits. She used her powerful Frost skill to block his attacks and even counterattacked.Watchguard of Darkness is the best for offense, but it lacks a lot of defensive capabilities,\u00a0Seo Jun-ho thought.\u00a0So when I got the Frost skill, the first thing that came to mind was defensive reinforcement.His goal had been to increase his overall defense by strengthening his equipment, but the results weren\u2019t great.If I cover armor in ice\u2026 naturally, it\u2019ll be heavy.\u00a0It did help, but he lost mobility, and the increase in defense wasn\u2019t significant.Eventually, Seo Jun-ho had to make a choice.Should I give up speed for a resilient body?Or\u2026\u2026Should I raise both my attack and defense but be in more danger?When he recognized the two options, he was inclined to choose one of them. He preferred to fight one-dimensionally, like a tug-of-war.Since I\u2019ve already received the skill, I should use it to the best of my abilities.After a lot of pondering and research, he decided on how he would use the Frost skill. It came down to three categories.\u201cThe first is utility.\u201dCrackle.\u00a0The ground beneath them started to freeze over. Rodomir\u2019s eyes went wide when he saw that his ankles were starting to freeze.Crash!\u00a0The ice broke immediately.\u2013\u00a0\u201cYou cannot trap me with such petty tricks.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dHe didn\u2019t plan to bind him.I just need to distract you.The floor had become like an ice rink. Rodomir would have to use more strength than usual to simply walk.That\u2019s good enough.The icy ground would serve to distract his enemy and slowly eat away at his stamina.This is the first way I can use the Frost skill: to create an advantageous battlefield.The second use was more intuitive. Since it would be too heavy to constantly cover his armor in ice, he just needed to do it when he was attacked.Of course, that means I have to pay extra attention to everything that\u2019s going on\u2026But he was Specter. This level of fine control was nothing.The final use of the Frost skill was his favorite.Crackle.The air around him froze, creating sharp icicles.\u201cUsing the Frost skill to supplement attacks.\u201dWatchguard of Darkness can\u2019t do this.\u00a0Well, it was possible, but it was highly inefficient. The darkness was intangible, and though it was possible to make weapons out of it, it took up too much magic.Technically, Cold energy is intangible too\u2026\u00a0But it would become solid as soon as moisture froze. It was a combat skill, something he\u2019d dreamt of having since he was Specter.\u201cIt\u2019s like a magician wielding a sword or a swordsman wielding magic.\u201dIt was the best possible skill for a magic swordsman. From now on, his opponents would have to avoid both his sword and the icicles that would come flying in all directions.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u00a0Rodomir quietly watched it all unfold.\u00a0\u201cDarkness and ice\u2026 Why did you hide such power?\u201d\u201cIt was something I couldn\u2019t avoid. Besides, didn\u2019t you hide your power too?\u201d Seo Jun-ho jutted his chin toward the Dark energy shrouding Rodomir\u2019s sword.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026My circumstances were different.\u201dRodomir\u2019s ability wasn\u2019t something he could use whenever he wanted. He burned away at his soul to call upon the strength of a corrupt spirit.\u2013\u00a0\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u00a0The black energy surrounding Rodomir\u2019s sword wavered like it was about to explode. It was a violent energy that seemed like it would destroy everything it touched.Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t back down.Ten minutes\u2026 No, maybe five.\u00a0The amount of time he\u2019d be able to maintain his full power.\u00a0He did the calculations in his head, considering his opponent\u2019s abilities.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d A moment later, he made a decision. \u201cYeah, it\u2019ll work. Five minutes should be enough.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026Five minutes? Are you saying that you only need five minutes to kill me?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dRodomir snorted at Seo Jun-ho\u2019s unwavering response.He knew very well that Seo Jun-ho had been hiding his true power. He\u2019d brought him to this strange space, drawing darkness and ice out of thin air.\u2013 But he says five minutes\u2026He composed himself. He thought that Seo Jun-ho was still gravely underestimating him, but Seo Jun-ho thought the opposite.He\u2019s extraordinary. I think he\u2019ll actually last five minutes.\u00a0He was amazed to think that his opponent would be able to hold out for so long.Even if Seo Jun-ho wasn\u2019t as strong as he was in the past, he considered it high praise.\u201cThis will be fun.\u201d His heart started to pound in excitement.Black Dragon Fang started to cry out, black sword ki surrounding it.It\u2019s impossible for me to use a sword aura with my current level of magic.\u00a0But this was close enough.The sword suddenly started to tremble. The vibrating energy started to burn like fire.\u2013\u00a0\u201cHmph! A sword aura\u2026?\u201d\u00a0Rodomir looked slightly surprised for a moment, but then he snorted.\u00a0\u201cI saw wrong.\u201dIt couldn\u2019t be called a sword aura; perfected auras burned much more fiercely.\u2013\u00a0\u201cDo you think you can defeat me in five minuets simply because of that sword?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Seo Jun-ho shook his head and smiled. \u201cA long time ago\u2014that is, around 27 or 28 years ago\u2014I was fighting a boss monster called an Ironshell Turtle. Its hide and shell were so thick that I couldn\u2019t even scratch it with sword ki.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u00a0Rodomir frowned. The human looked like he was in his mid-twenties, so why was he talking about something from 27 years ago? Nevertheless, his voice was too pure to be a lie, and he had a faint air of nostalgia about him.\u201cAt that time, I thought to myself: \u2018this is how I die\u2019. But as death approached, I didn\u2019t want to die, you know? So I thought to myself that I\u2019d have to use sword aura. But it\u2019s not that easy. It\u2019s not like you can pull it out whenever you want to. Naturally, I failed. In front of me was the Ironshell Turtle and behind me was the sea. Thinking about it still makes me shiver\u2026\u201dWoosh!\u00a0Black Dragon Fang seemed to laugh, as if anticipating its transformation.\u201cSo I made this.\u201dThe darkness around him covered the blade, reinforcing the sword over the magic.Magic and darkness. The two energies collided.Cla-ang! Clang!It wasn\u2019t just one clash. They fought like children fighting over a toy.Kuh\u2026\u00a0Because of that, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s magic was quickly depleting, but it wasn\u2019t just for nothing. The magic that had been burning like a candle started to grow.\u201cOne day, Rahmadat saw this.\u201dRahmadat Khali, the King of Destruction. The so-called second coming of Shiva, India\u2019s hero, and his comrade.\u201cHe said that out of all the unpredictable techniques he\u2019d seen in his life\u2026\u201dClaaang!\u00a0After one more fierce clash, the two prideful energies had reached a truce.\u201cThis one was the best.\u201dA black fire burned off of Black Dragon Fang, resembling sword aura.I can maintain this state for ten minutes at most.You couldn\u2019t compare it to sword aura, but it was much stronger and sharper than sword ki. It was a miracle born out of Seo Jun-ho\u2019s desperation to live and ingenious creativity.\u201cLaw of Life (\u5fc5\u6b7b\u5247\u751f).\u201dIf you were prepared to die, you would find a way to live*. He got the name of his technique from Admiral Yi Sun-shin\u2019s War Diary.(TN: The name of the technique is literally this entire phrase but in hanja, so I shortened it. Yi Sun-shin is a famous Korean war general.)\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Rodomir saw the sword, he realized that his opponent hadn\u2019t underestimated him after all.\u2013\u00a0\u201cFive minutes,\u201d he smiled bitterly. \u201cNot bad.\u201dHe\u2019d thought of him highly.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u2013 \u201cCough.\u201d\u00a0Dead blood poured from Rodomir\u2019s mouth. He slowly looked down at the pitch-black sword that had pierced his heart. It had taken five minutes and two seconds for Seo Jun-ho to do that.\u2013\u00a0\u201cReally\u2026 not bad\u2026\u201dThe power of the corrupt spirit wasn\u2019t so easily overpowered by the makeshift sword aura. It had been his opponent\u2019s own skills that had decided the outcome of the battle.Clatter.\u00a0Rodomir placed his sword down and fell on his knees.He\u2019d inevitably betrayed the World Tree, but he wished to die as the knight of an Elven clan.\u2013 \u201c\u2026Human.\u201dHe was starting to see light, as bright as the sun in the sky.For someone who was about to die, his eyes were clear, and his expression was peaceful.\u201cAny last words?\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026Here.\u201dHe tapped his neck with two fingers. Rodomir was asking him to end it.Seo Jun-ho nodded, then rummaged through his inventory.\u201cI\u2019ll do as you ask, just answer my question.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d Rodomir looked carefully at the item the human was holding. His eyes widened.\u2013\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Spirit Egg!\u201d\u201cHo?\u201cRodomir reached out his hand and stroked the precious egg, entranced.\u201cNo-no, you\u2019re corrupted. Don\u2019t infect my child.\u201d Seo Jun-ho quickly pulled it back, putting it in his jacket. Rodomir looked shaken.\u201cSo it\u2019s a Spirit Egg?\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cThen will a spirit be born from it?\u201dInstead of responding, Rodomir ripped off his necklace made of rotten wood.\u2013\u00a0\u201cYes, if you go to a place with even a trace of the World Tree.\u201d\u00a0He tossed the necklace to Seo Jun-ho.\u2013\u00a0\u201cTake it if you want. It\u2019s weak, but it contains some power from the World Tree.\u201d\u201cWell, I won\u2019t say no. Do you have anything else? Elixirs?\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u00a0Rodomir looked at him with disgust.\u00a0\u201cTo think that I fell to such a human\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t, just say no.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019re done here.\u201dBefore he pulled out his sword, he asked one more question.\u201cOh, how do I hatch it?\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026Infuse it with your magic.

He\u2019d hunted violent spirits inside Gates and met spirits that were contracted to other players. Whether he met them as an ally or an enemy, he always thought the same thing:They\u2019re so OP.Spirits didn\u2019t need magic because they were independent beings; they could create powerful attacks or shields without it. It was no risk with an insanely high return, and Seo Jun-ho always looked at players with contracted spirits with envy.But now I can contract a spirit of my own?\u00a0His heart pounded. He recalled what he knew about spirits.Like humans, spirits are attracted to those they are similar to.\u00a0Spirits didn\u2019t make contracts with those who didn\u2019t have the right synergy. So when Seo Jun-ho found out that the ball was an Egg, he only had one thought.It\u2019s a Darkness spirit.He\u2019d been using Watchguard of Darkness longer than anything else, and was also his most proficient skill.\u201cThis will be useful.\u201d Seo Jun-ho sensed a faint trace of nature in the wood necklace.This is\u2026 the energy of the World Tree.\u00a0It was but a small trace, but it was pure and refreshing. He crushed it in his hand. The necklace cracked, releasing the energy inside. Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t miss the chance and poured his magic into the glowing ball.Crackle.There was the sound of an egg cracking. The ball shined so brightly, it temporarily blinded him.Just what kind of spirit is it? How strong will it be?Heart thrumming, Seo Jun-ho slowly opened his eyes.\u201c\u2026What?\u201dHis face fell.* * *\u201cHm, the fight\u2019s taking longer than I thought.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m getting nervous. We can\u2019t even see what\u2019s going on in there.\u201dThe players muttered to themselves impatiently. They\u2019d already taken care of the other dark elves. If the tribe chief Rodomir was defeated, they would succeed in clearing the Gate.Suddenly, an announcement appeared before them with a ring.[You have cleared \u27eaWild Forest\u27eb.]They succeeded! The players started to cheer and pump their fists in the air.\u201cWhat about Jun-ho-nim?\u201dAs if responding to Cha Min-woo\u2019s question, the black dome dissipated like smoke, revealing a gloomy-looking Seo Jun-ho.\u201cJun-ho-nim!\u201d\u201cYou did it!\u201d\u201cAre you hurt anywhere? We should get you treated first!\u201dHe shook his head at the crowd of people that started to surround him. \u201cI\u2019m uninjured.\u201d\u201cBut why do you look so sullen?\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d Seo Jun-ho briefly pondered on how he would explain this. \u201cImagine the disappointment of a child who wanted a cool new toy for Christmas but got school supplies instead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe people looked confused.\u201cHoo, nevermind,\u201d he sighed. They wouldn\u2019t be able to understand his feelings.Messages started to appear in front of him too.[You have cleared \u27eaWild Forest\u27eb.][You have received \u300cBlue Fairy Bracelet\u300d as a clear reward.][You have leveled up.][You have leveled up.][You have leveled up.][All stats have increased by 3.][You have regained 3 Magic stats.][You have regained 3 Strength stats.][The Gate will automatically disappear in 1 hour.]Level 27\u2026\u00a0He\u2019d been level 23 when he entered the Gate, which meant it increased by 4. It was only possible because of his crucial role in the conquest and because he\u2019d taken all the EXP from Rodomir for himself.Three more.\u00a0He was three steps away from being able to go to the 2nd floor.He usually exited the Gates with a triumphant expression, but his footsteps were heavy.Why did I get that spirit\u2026\u00a0Seo Jun-ho let out one final sigh and stepped out of the Gate. The lazy night sky of England greeted him.Click!

He is making history.][The weakest player showed the greatest strength. Videos from inside the Gate.]\u2026\u2026The day after the Wild Forest Gate was cleared, Seo Jun-ho was on the front page of newspapers all over the world. There had been concerns about his participation because he had the lowest level, but after he succeeded, his reputation started to soar. But Seo Jun-ho himself was glum as he sat on a plane heading back to Korea.\u201c\u2026What does it matter.\u201dYou shouldn\u2019t count your chickens before they hatch. He\u2019d made the mistake of doing that to his spirit. \u201cWhy\u2026\u201dHe let out a sigh as he wiped his face with a washcloth, glaring at the tiny creature looking out the plane window.\u201cThe humans here are quite intriguing. They can fly without magic.\u201dThe cute little spirit looked like a human and was about the size of his palm.\u201c\u2026Hey, I said not to talk to me until I finish sorting my thoughts.\u201d\u201cHow strict. I was simply talking to myself.*\u201d(TN: She uses a form of \u2018I\u2019 that means that she\u2019s the strongest in a group.)She looked shockingly similar to someone he knew; more specifically, the boss monster that had threatened the world 25 years ago.The Frost Queen.If she simply resembled her in appearance, he wouldn\u2019t have reacted this badly. But it was because of what she\u2019d said as soon as she emerged from the Egg.\u2018Oya? You\u2019re a familiar face.\u2019\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho pounded the seat with his fist. \u201cWhy me\u2026\u201dHe\u2019d wanted a cool, strong, Darkness spirit, but he\u2019d gotten a Frost spirit instead\u2014one he\u2019d killed himself.\u201cI think I\u2019ve given you enough time to cool off.\u201d\u201cI said, don\u2019t talk to me.\u201d\u201cOh, but I\u2019m still talking to myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing the Frost Queen smirk as she floated in the air made his anger swell. She wore a dress of white and blue with a peculiar helmet, but he could tell by her smile that she was mocking him.\u201cOkay, fine.\u201dFinally making a decision, Seo Jun-ho closed the door to his first class seat so that no one could hear. He folded his arms and looked down at the Frost Queen.\u201cWhy are you doing this to me? Why were you the one to come out of the Spirit Egg?\u201d\u201cWhat use is there to ask me? The Spirit Egg births a spirit that is most compatible with your magic.\u201d\u201cSo why you? The spirit most compatible with me would be a Darkness spirit.\u201d\u201cFufu.\u201d The Frost Queen covered her mouth as she laughed. She folded her legs in the air. \u201cIs it not obvious? Your most compatible element is Frost.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t joke around. I\u2019ve used Watchguard of Darkness for over five years. Frost, on the other hand\u2026\u201d It had only been a little over three months. Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t believe that his most compatible element was Frost, not Darkness.\u201cRegardless, the fact stands that I was the one to emerge from the Spirit Egg after you infused it with your magic.\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s fucking annoying, but that\u2019s the truth.\u201d\u201cThen, let me ask you: will you make a contract with me?\u201d\u201cA contract?\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2026 When I think about what you did to my comrades and to other people\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat have I done for you to say that?\u201d The Frost Queen shook her head, seemingly confused.\u201cHa!\u00a0Don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know. You\u2026\u201d As he was about to scoff about her deeds, Seo Jun-ho suddenly paused.\u00a0\u2026What did she do again?All he knew was that she froze the South Pacific Ocean and froze his friends. The Frost Queen spoke first.\u201cI already said this, but I have not done anything in this world worthy of condemnation.\u201d\u201c\u2026You froze the South Pacific.\u201d\u201cWell, I suppose I\u2019m sorry to the fish.\u201d\u201cAnd because of that, there was all that abnormal weather\u2026\u201d But it hadn\u2019t been that serious because her Gate had been in Antarctica.\u201c\u2026More importantly, you froze me and my comrades.\u201dThe Frost Queen raised her hands and shook her little head. She looked like a doll.\u201cAre you pretending not to know? I was not the one who froze you, nor does the power to melt them belong to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOn the contrary, I feel most sorry for myself, whom you killed\u2026\u201dHe had nothing to say at the face of the facts.Seo Jun-ho started to tremble in frustration.\u201cA-anyways\u2026 I don\u2019t like you.\u201d\u201cHoo,\u00a0you\u2019re like a child throwing a tantrum.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dSeo Jun-ho\u2019s thoughts became complicated as he sat back into his seat.Did she really do nothing wrong?\u00a0As far as he knew, she hadn\u2019t. But just to be sure, he opened his Vita\u2019s messaging app.\u2013 What.Deok-gu\u2019s cool reply came.\u2013 Deok-gu, what do you think the Frost Queen did wrong?\u2013 What? What are you asking all of a sudden?\u2013 I\u2019m in a hurry.\u2013 Geez\u2026 Obviously, she turned the Five Heroes into popsicles.\u2013 Anything else?\u2013 I don\u2019t know. Should there be something else?\u2013 \u2026Nevermind. Thanks.\u2013 Why do you ask?\u2013 Later.Seo Jun-ho closed the app and felt the eyes of the spirit on him. The Frost Queen was smirking, as if to say \u2018See, I was right\u2019.\u201c\u2026Fine. Say that you didn\u2019t do anything in the past. Why should I make a contract with you?\u201d\u201cI shall be your teacher,\u201d she whispered in her sweet voice. \u201cI can teach you how to use my skill, and I can use spiritual energy to help you.\u201d\u201cYou, teach me?\u00a0Ha!\u201d Seo Jun-ho scoffed. \u201cYou lost to me.\u201dHe was stronger than her. How could someone weaker than him teach him?But the Frost Queen was unfazed.\u201cYes, you did win against my weakened form.\u201d\u201c\u2026Weakened? Who said you\u2019re selling medicine?*\u201d(TN: It\u2019s a pun. The word for \u2018weakened\u2019 sounds similar to \u2018pharmacy\u2019.)\u201cMedicine? I\u2019m not some peddler. I\u2019ve never sold medicine.\u201d She shook her head, her voice clear and sonorous. \u201cI am the Queen of the Ice Kingdom Niflheim, the one who controls all the cold in the world. I swear on my own existence that I do not lie.\u201dShe\u2019d made an Oath of Existence. It had originated from the mana oaths of magicians.If they breach a mana oath, magicians lose all their magic.The powerful Frost Queen had made the oath by her own choice, so it wasn\u2019t a lie.\u201c\u2026How weakened were you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Perhaps by a hundred times?\u201d\u201cA hundred? No way! Swear on yourself again.\u201d\u201c\u2026No. If I do it too often, it will lower my dignity as a Queen.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cSo, will you or will you not make a contract with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt made no sense that she\u2019d only used a hundredth of her true power. But it was true that she\u2019d been nerfed.If she\u2019s thrice\u2026 No, if she\u2019s only twice as strong as she was then\u2026\u00a0He didn\u2019t want to imagine her full strength.But being taught by such a being was a good enough reason to make a contract. She\u2019d also become a Frost spirit, so she wouldn\u2019t use up magic and make for a powerful ally. No matter how he thought about it, it would be a huge mistake to pass up a contract.\u201c\u2026Fine. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d He\u2019d decided. Seo Jun-ho looked at the Frost Queen coldly. \u201cBut I have a condition.\u201d\u201cA condition? Speak.\u201d\u201cIf you put me or the people around me in danger because of your lies or blunders, the contract will be nullified.\u201d\u201cYou speak the obvious. A contract with a spirit is a contract of the souls. I would never do that,\u201d she laughed. Seo Jun-ho scowled at her sickly sweet smile.I don\u2019t know if this is the right choice\u2026\u00a0But for now, he had contracted the Frost Queen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He let out a long, annoyed sigh.\u201cStill, it\u2019s being held for a good reason. Go Korea! Super Rookie!\u00a0Kyaa~\u00a0cheers!\u201d She pretended to take a shot, and Seo Jun-ho grinned.He glanced at the Frost Queen.\u00a0I don\u2019t think other people can see her.\u00a0First, Cha Min-woo, and now, Cha Si-eun. No one ever seemed to have noticed her.\u201cI can make myself visible if I wish to,\u201d she said, as if reading his mind.\u201c\u2026Nah, not now.\u201d\u201cHuh?

Things looked much smaller.\u201dSeo Jun-ho scrolled through the list of Gates throughout the world.Cha Min-woo had told him that he and some other players had spoken after they cleared the Gate. They\u2019d said that if they\u2019d failed, the Gate would have become a future 1-star Gate.Gates are given one star if ten thousand players fail to clear it\u2026Seo Jun-ho rested his chin on his hand. This conquest had taught him that he couldn\u2019t clear a 1-star Gate alone.But what about now?\u00a0He looked at the naive little Frost Queen, who was marveling at the sights. He didn\u2019t trust her, but she was still a spirit.Spirits are strong. Insanely strong.\u00a0The spirit users he\u2019d met before had been uniquely powerful because of the spirits they\u2019d contracted.\u00a0I have to check how strong she is as soon as we get back.Whenever he got a new power, he had to verify its strength before he used it. He\u2019d also have to assess his own abilities while he checked hers.It seems I\u2019ll be busy for a while.He was a player, after all. It was natural that he\u2019d be thinking about training as soon as he got back.* * *Deok-gu was out on business today, so he wasn\u2019t there to greet Seo Jun-ho. He headed straight to the training room. Cha Si-eun wouldn\u2019t stop nagging him about it, but she couldn\u2019t win against his stubbornness. The Frost Queen scanned the room.\u201cHow boring.

The Frost Queen approached him.\u201cContractor.\u201d\u201cWhat.\u201dShe pulled at his sleeve, leading him to a pet store. The puppies and kittens were visible from the window.\u201cWhat are the names of these adorable creatures?\u201d\u201cDog, cat. You don\u2019t know that?\u201d\u201cThe climate of my kingdom was not one that such frail children could survive in. Can I touch them?\u201d\u201cNo. Unless you\u2019re gonna buy one.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe Frost Queen pressed against the window, studying a baby kitten. She looked a bit pitiful with her drooping ears.\u201cWell, you might be able to touch one of the cats on the streets.\u201d\u201cA cat on the streets, you say?\u201d\u201cYeah, they\u2019re called stray cats. They don\u2019t have owners.\u201d\u201cStray cat\u2026 Stray cat\u2026 I will not forget their names.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Seo Jun-ho checked his watch and started back toward the Association. He took a different route from the one they came from, cutting through a residential area.\u201cHm?\u201d Unfortunately, there was a cat laying on the street. \u201cIt\u2019s a stray cat.\u201dThe Frost Queen happily flew over.Well, it\u2019s not like it can see her\u2026\u00a0But he was wrong.\u201cNya?\u201d As the cat noticed the Frost Queen, its eyes started to sparkle like it had found a toy.\u201cNyaa!\u201dThus began their intense chase.\u201cWh-why is this child acting as such!\u201d It was probably the first time she had run for her life from a cat. She quickly escaped to Seo Jun-ho.\u201cNyaong.\u201dThe cat didn\u2019t want to provoke Seo Jun-ho and quietly returned to its spot.\u201cWhat a fierce monster! To think that it hid its savage nature under an attractive mask. I was fooled.\u201d She pulled at Seo Jun-ho\u2019s hair, upset. \u201cHow do you humans keep such fearsome monsters as pets?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d \u2018Because they don\u2019t bite humans. You probably seemed like a butterfly because you were flying around.\u2019 Before he could say that, a plan popped in his head.\u201cHuhu. Well, cats cower under the presence of someone strong.\u201d He walked over to the cat and gently stroked its head and stomach. It didn\u2019t refuse him and actually purred. The Frost Queen looked shocked.\u201cIt\u2019s not attacking\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m strong.\u201d\u201cI-I am also strong.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about that\u2026 I can\u2019t really judge because I haven\u2019t seen anything\u2026\u201dShe fell into his trap. She pouted and crossed her arms.\u201cLead me.\u201d\u201cTo where?\u201d\u201cI shall show you my power in the training room.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Seo Jun-ho suppressed his smile and nodded. \u201cSure.\u201dHe\u2019d figured out how to deal with the powerful Queen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Frost Queen was staring down at him.\u201cCarve the sight of my power into your mind.\u201d\u201cGladly.\u201dAs she summoned her power, the temperature of the room dropped. She spread her small hands.Crackle!\u00a0Dozens of ice spears shot up from the ground.Seo Jun-ho couldn\u2019t even dream of doing that with his current level of magic. But he only watched more attentively.This won\u2019t be all.He was right. Dozens of ice arrows formed in the air, and a shield formed near the ceiling. As it fell to the ground, walls were raised.\u201cYou could wage a war all by yourself.\u201d With this, she could have easily killed a hundred dark elves. But his judgement was anticlimactic.\u201cNot bad.\u201d\u201cWh-what? Are you suggesting that this is merely \u2018not bad\u2019?\u201d She started to throw a fit, complaining that she was greatly weakened because she was a spirit.\u201cThat\u2019s none of my concern. It\u2019s a little sloppy, and even I can make all this.\u201d\u201cNonsense! Watch carefully.\u201d As she raised her hand, the weapons appeared in front of him. Seo Jun-ho inspected them carefully.The quality is a lot better than what I can make.The ice spears and arrows he made were rough imitations, but the Frost Queen\u2019s were masterfully crafted to be as dangerous as possible.Each arrow and speartip have three edges.\u00a0If you were hit with one of them, it would be dangerous to pull it out because doing so would give another injury.The same was true for the shields; they were designed to disperse impacts as much as possible.\u201cThe quality of your weapons is much better than mine, but mine are lethal too.\u201d It would be nice to create weapons of her designs, but he was fine even without them. \u201cAnd if I focus on improving my designs, I\u2019ll get better eventually.\u201dHe went straight to the point. \u201cWhat I want from you is something that I can\u2019t do.\u201d\u201c\u2026Something you can\u2019t do, you say.\u201d The Frost Queen stroked her chin for a moment drawing out her power again. \u201cPerhaps something like this will do.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? Show me.\u201dSeo Jun-ho didn\u2019t expect much, but the spectacle made him knock his chair over. He started to clap.\u201cTh-this is it! Yes, this is what I wanted!\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Shim Deok-gu finished his business and went to his office. He greeted the man who was using his office like it was his own room.\u201cI\u2019m so busy these days.\u201d\u201cWhat did you think a President did?\u201d Shim Deok-gu raised an eyebrow at Seo Jun-ho\u2019s unenthusiastic answer.\u201cAnd whose fault is it that I\u2019m busy?\u201d\u201cThe heck. You\u2019re not gonna say it\u2019s because of me, are you?\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re aware! It\u00a0is\u00a0because of you!\u201dIf an Association Player was doing well, it was only natural that the rest of the Association got busy. Commissioners from all over the world would send emails, call in, or come in person. And when something as important as this happened, Deok-gu sometimes had to go on business trips. These days, he often thought that it would be nice if he had ten bodies.\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll try my best not to stand out from now on.\u201d\u201cBastard\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll stop joking.\u201d Seo Jun-ho quickly changed the subject. \u201cLet me ask you something. Do you know what the Frost Queen looks like?\u201d\u201cWhat? Why would I?\u201d Shim Deok-gu placed his briefcase down on his desk and hung up his coat. He looked at Seo Jun-ho with a strange look in his eyes. \u201cOnly the Five Heroes saw her. Actually, you were the only one that went up to the 2nd floor of the Nest.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really? I see.\u201d Seo Jun-ho stroked his chin and looked to the side. \u201cThen I suppose it won\u2019t be a huge problem.\u201d\u201cProblem? What problem?\u201dSeo Jun-ho looked at the air at his side. \u201cYou can show yourself now.\u201d\u201cWho are you talking\u2014Ahhhhhh!\u201d Shim Deok-gu let out a sudden scream. He had always been scared of ghosts as a child. He shrank away to his wall, pointing a trembling finger.\u201cHey! N-next to you\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s next to me?\u201d\u201cA-a girl. A tiny girl\u2026\u201dThe little ghost girl spoke with pity. \u201cIs that shaking human your friend?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that\u2026 a ghost?\u201d\u201cGhost, my ass. You look a lot scarier than her, you know?\u201d To be honest, the Frost Queen was beautiful and elegant.Deok-gu carefully took a seat, still wary. He belatedly realized his predicament and blushed.\u201cHey, anyone would be scared if something like that appeared all of a sudden.\u201d\u201c\u2018Something like that\u2019? Contractor. Did that human just call me a \u2018something\u2019?\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201d\u201cHow bold.\u201d She spoke with a chilling voice as she forced the temperature to drop.\u201cStop.\u201d Seo Jun-ho cut her off. \u201cDon\u2019t bother my friend. You remember the conditions of our contract, right?\u201d He warned.\u201c\u2026Hmph, if he addresses me like that again, I will not forgive him even if he\u2019s your friend.\u201d\u201cHear that? This is the Queen, and everything is beneath her. Be careful when you speak.\u201d\u201cQueen? What kind of queen\u2026\u201d Deok-gu trailed off, his eyes widening. He remembered what Seo Jun-ho had just asked him. \u201cThe\u2026 Frost Queen?\u201d\u201cBingo. I knew you\u2019d catch on.\u201d As Seo Jun-ho replied casually, Shim Deok-gu stood up from his seat again. He loosened his necktie and pushed his hair back, pacing around the room while rubbing his forehead. The Frost Queen watched quietly.\u201cContractor, what is that human doing? He looks unstable.\u201d\u201cI dunno, he\u2019s probably trying to process your existence.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 You did not talk to me for the first two days either.\u201d She seemed to understand and crossed her legs haughtily. Seo Jun-ho glanced at her.\u201cBut why do you keep sitting on my shoulder?\u201d\u201cI like the view from here. The chair is firm, yet soft and comfortable.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a chair, it\u2019s my shoulder.\u201d\u201cIf I see it as a chair, then it is a chair.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201d Seo Jun-ho knew better than to argue with her and shut his mouth.\u201cFine. Fine. Fine.\u201d Deok-gu took a seat. He looked at the tiny Frost Queen. \u201cSo let me get this straight. That\u2019s\u2026 the Frost Queen.\u201d\u201cYes. All the cold in this world\u2014\u201d\u201cSimply put, she\u2019s the queen of some well-to-do ice kingdom. That\u2019s what she\u2019s saying.\u201d He cut her off.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The Frost Queen looked at her contractor with distaste.\u201cThen, can you explain how this happened?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s simple.\u201dHe\u2019d won the Egg at the Las Vegas auction. Then Rodomir had helped him hatch it after he had been defeated. Then,\u00a0ta-dah!\u00a0The Frost Queen had emerged from the Egg.\u201cHm\u2026\u00a0Well, alright.\u201d After listening to the story, Deok-gu was taking it surprisingly well. \u201cYou have the biggest grudge toward her, and you\u2019re fine with it. I\u2019m in no place to say anything.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019ll be a big help in battle. She\u2019s really strong.\u201d\u201cStrong? What\u2019s her spirit class?\u201d\u201c\u2026Class?\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes went wide. Deok-gu looked at him like he should\u2019ve known this.\u201cLesser, Low, Common, High, Arch. That\u2019s how spirits are classified based on strength.\u201d\u201cHow do I figure out her class then?\u201d\u201cOnly she herself knows\u2026\u201d They both looked at the Frost Queen. She slowly looked up. Seo Jun-ho jostled his shoulder.\u201cHey, what\u2019s your class?\u201d\u201cAh\u2014Do not move the chair around!\u201dSeo Jun-ho ignored her and she eventually flew into the air, pouting. She crossed her arms and looked down on the two men.\u201cListen closely! I was a high and noble being from the moment I was born.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re an Arch spirit?\u201d\u201cY-yes\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Her voice trembled under the lie. As Seo Jun-ho sent a knowing look to Deok-gu, she created a snowball and threw it at them.\u201cIt\u2019s extremely rude to ask about my class!\u201dIt was the first time they\u2019d heard of such a rule. The two exchanged glances and nodded.She\u2019s a Lesser spirit, isn\u2019t she?Yeah, I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s the lowest one.\u201cI know you\u2019re thinking disrespectful things!\u201dShe was smart. Seo Jun-ho waved her off and changed the subject.\u201cAnyways, she\u2019s strong, so I want my next Gate to be super hard.\u201d\u201cSuper hard? You\u2019ve only ever done Uncleared Gates and Gates with powerful boss monsters\u2026\u201d Deok-gu\u2019s face fell. \u201cWait, are you talking about a 1-star Gate?\u201d\u201cYou know I never insist on doing something that I can\u2019t do.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s true.\u201dSeo Jun-ho wasn\u2019t greedy when it came to Gates. He only ever attempted those that he knew he could clear. The only exception had been the Frost Queen\u2019s Nest.\u201cI did see the report. They said that the Wild Forest was at the level of a 1-star.\u201d\u201cI got a lot stronger after fighting that guy. I can clear a 1-star Gate on my own.\u201d\u201cWell, if you say so. There are only three 1-star Gates in the world right now though.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already decided where I\u2019m going.\u201d Seo Jun-ho tapped on his Vita, and a world map popped up in front of them. \u201cThere\u2019s one in South America, one in China\u2026\u201dDeok-gu pointed at the bottom of the map and Seo Jun-ho zoomed in. Deok-gu glanced at him.\u201cWill you\u2026 be alright?\u201d\u201cIs there a reason I wouldn\u2019t be?\u201d\u201cWell, you know. Trauma exists\u2026\u201d\u201cNah. Even if I were traumatized, the one who caused it will be right next to me.\u201d He tapped on the map. \u201cI already failed once, so this time I\u2019ll succeed,\u201d he said confidently.It was an Uncleared Gate near the King Sejong Station.(TN: A Korean research base in Antarctica.)The Winter Castle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He grabbed a can of beer from the fridge and a snack before lying down on his sofa.\u201cDo you not need to eat?\u201d He asked the Frost Queen, glancing at her.\u201cI am a spirit. Unlike humans, we are higher beings that do not require sustenance,\u201d she boasted.\u201cReally? Then I guess you don\u2019t have to spend money on those things.\u201d He took a long swig of beer and started to ask about the things he\u2019d been wondering about.\u201cTell me everything you know about the Dimensional Elevator.\u201d Seo Jun-ho intended to find out all he could about the cause of this horrible game from his former enemy.\u201cI do not know anything,\u201d she said curtly, shaking her head.\u201cHey, don\u2019t be difficult\u2026\u201d\u201cI really do not. I swear on my own being.\u201dAn Oath of Existence\u2026Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. \u201cAre you kidding me? You were a Floor Master. How do you not know anything?\u201d\u201cOnce I forfeited the role, I lost all memories regarding it.\u201d\u201cYour memories were erased?\u201d\u201cI remember knowing certain things, but my mind goes blank when I try to call upon those memories.\u201d\u201cMm. That\u2019s a waste.\u201d It would\u2019ve been nice if she knew why the world changed or had information on the other floors.The System is more thorough than I thought.\u00a0Who knew that it would go so far as to erase her memories. Of course, it had already done the impossible by connecting Earth to other dimensions. It could probably erase memories with the flick of a wrist.Seo Jun-ho drained the last of his beer and tried to ease his frustration.\u201cDo not be so disappointed. Though the memories you desire have disappeared, my intelligence is so great that it is known in other lands. It will be helpful in the days to come.\u201d\u201cI sure hope so. Oh, and I heard that spirits don\u2019t use the magic of their contractors. Is that true?\u201d\u201cYou speak the obvious.\u201d\u201cThen how the heck do you use your powers? I don\u2019t even sense any magic from you.\u201d\u201cDo you really not know?\u201d The Frost Queen looked at him like he was being absurd. \u201cContractor, do you really not feel anything when I use my powers?\u201d\u201cNot really?\u201d\u201cHaa, you really are quite insensitive\u2026\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWhen a spirit draws power from their contractor, it is from their mental strength.\u201d\u201cWhat if I\u2019m mentally drained?\u201d\u201cThen I am unable to use the same amount of power as usual. If your mental state is extremely weakened, the contract may be dissolved.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 There\u2019s a penalty after all.\u201d It turned out that spirits weren\u2019t as all-powerful as he\u2019d thought.Well, if they were able to use that much power without a cost, they would practically be gods.Most of his questions had been answered, but Seo Jun-ho felt like his homework had increased in number.\u201cThen the things you showed me before used up my mental strength?\u201d\u201cOf course. You will have to practice a lot before using it in a real battle.\u201d\u201cPractice\u2026 Sounds fun.\u201d He\u2019d been looking forward to doing some special training with his new skills. \u201cLook forward to it. You\u2019ll see why people call me a tough cookie.\u201d\u201cDo not be so hasty. No matter how extraordinary of a human you are, it will take at least a month.\u201dA month? The Frost Queen was underestimating him. He grinned.Two weeks.He\u2019ll change her mind within that time.* * *The click of heels echoed across the hall on the 77th floor of the Player Association headquarters. Cha Si-eun walked past the art on display and knocked on the door.\u2013 \u201cThe door\u2019s open.\u201dCha Si-eun entered and looked around the room.Whenever I come here, I feel like it would be embarrassing for me to live here.\u00a0Not only would it be hard to clean, it was hard to get to and had an unnecessary number of rooms. She suppressed her thoughts and walked over to Seo Jun-ho\u2019s bedroom.\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201dThe door was open, and Seo Jun-ho was standing in front of a full-length mirror. Cha Si-eun was shocked when she saw him. \u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dHe wore his pajamas last time.\u00a0She\u2019d brought a suit for this very reason, but she saw that it didn\u2019t matter.\u201cYou\u2019re not wearing pajamas today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only fun when you do it once.\u201dSeo Jun-ho looked like a model or actor in his light-blue suit. His hair was slicked to the side, and it made him look much more alive.When did his body get so good?\u00a0She blinked. When she\u2019d first met him, he was concerningly skinny, but now, his muscles were visible and well-defined.\u201cI\u2019m done getting ready. What do you think?\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d She spun him around, then gave two thumbs up. \u201cPerfect.\u201dThis was the second time Seo Jun-ho was having a press conference in Korea. The last one had been a small event and they\u2019d barely been able to accept one hundred people, but it was different this time; it was a large-scale conference with five hundred people.The doors finally opened.\u201cWow, look at all these people.\u201d\u201cThere are some big leagues here too.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s Seo Jun-ho after all. You can\u2019t exactly compare him to other rookies. He\u2019s too big.\u201d\u201cDamn. The editor-in-chief for the Players magazine is here.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s the BBC\u2026 They already got the scoop from him two days ago, but they\u2019re here again.\u201dThe press conference hadn\u2019t even started yet, but the room was filled with flashing cameras and the sound of typing. An entire article could be written just about the different people and groups that were attending.\u201cHa, he really is something else. The conference three months ago wasn\u2019t like this.\u201d\u201cWhat?! You went to Seo Jun-ho\u2019s first press conference?\u201d\u201cMy department head sent me to write something up\u2026 But when I saw Seo Jun-ho, I felt it instantly.\u201d\u201cFelt what?\u201dAt some point, other reporters had started to gather around them. The reporter noticed this and cleared their throat before speaking.\u201cHe was wearing pajamas, slippers, and his hair was a rat\u2019s nest. At first, I thought he was just some lunatic, but I was wrong.\u201d They pointed two fingers at their eyes. \u201cThe look in his eyes. He was yawning and all, but the piercing look he had was unforgettable.\u201d\u201cReally? He just looked tired in the pictures.\u201d\u201cNo. It was a vigor that you could only feel in person. Like with Kim Woo-joong or Shin Sung-hyun.\u201d\u201cAhh.\u201d They understood. Even when Shin Sung-hyun or Kim Woo-joong were just sitting around, they had a powerful presence.\u201cSo I\u2019ve personally been looking forward to this a lot.\u201d The reporter adjusted their glasses. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if Seo Jun-ho announces that he\u2019s going to a 1-star Gate.\u201d\u201cWhat? Nah, that\u2019s too much.\u201d Someone waved him off. \u201cEven if he\u2019s a super rookie, he\u2019s still a rookie\u2014a newbie.\u201d\u201cHe only debuted three months ago. If he goes in alone, that\u2019s suicide.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d the reporter laughed, embarrassed.\u201cI know what you\u2019re saying, but there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll say that if he\u2019s sane.\u201d* * *\u201cHey, it\u2019s almost time,\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered. He was sitting in the waiting room, snacking on crackers. Deok-gu looked at him in amazement.\u201cYou really\u2026 Aren\u2019t you nervous?\u201d\u201cNot really? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s my first time,\u201d Seo Jun-ho said, still eating. \u201cWe\u2019re announcing two things today, right?\u201d\u201cYes. We\u2019ll do as we discussed last night.\u201d Shim Deok-gu gulped and adjusted his tie. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dCha Si-eun escorted the two of them out. As they entered the conference room, they were covered in flashing lights. Seo Jun-ho casually took a seat.\u201cThe press conference will now begin and last for forty minutes.\u201dUnlike last time, he wasn\u2019t taking questions from reporters who raised their hands. Reporters had signed up beforehand on a first-come, first-served basis. Most of them were ones the Association had expected. A question he\u2019d been waiting for came up.\u201cWill you be going to the Cave of Trials?\u201d Seo Jun-ho quickly grabbed the mic.\u201cOf course. I\u2019m trying to set a date.\u201d\u201cOoh\u2026!\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a rite of passage for all new players.\u201d\u201cYou can only go there once in your life. It\u2019s a waste if you miss it.\u201dThe reporters nodded in understanding and typed on their keyboards. They\u2019d found something good.The Cave of Trials was a Gate in the alpine regions of Tibet. Its rules were different from other Gates.It\u2019s a Gate that can\u2019t be cleared, and you can leave it even if it isn\u2019t.It had first appeared when the world became like a game and had been around for close to thirty years.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how much player Seo Jun-ho will grow after going to the Cave of Trials.\u201d\u201cAre you thinking that you\u2019ll at least reach the 5th level?\u201d\u201cI dunno. We\u2019ll have to see when I get there.\u201dThe Cave of Trials gave the player a choice to \u2018go\u2019 or \u2018stop\u2019 whenever they cleared a level. They could leave the Gate if they were satisfied with their rewards, or they could proceed to the next level for a chance at a better reward with the risk of losing everything.I got to the 9th level last time.\u00a0He\u2019d been level 30 at the time and barely survived. Still, the things he won had been a huge help to his journey as a player.\u201cThen, have you thought about what Gate you\u2019ll be going to after the Cave of Trials?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded without hesitation.All eyes were on him. The reporters positioned their hands on their hologram keyboards to type down what he was about to say.\u201cI will be going to the Winter Castle,\u201d he said shortly.With those two words, the bustling conference room fell silent.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe reporters couldn\u2019t even type. They weren\u2019t sure if they\u2019d heard him right, even though there was only one Gate in the world called the Winter Castle. It was one of three Uncleared Gates in the world whose Difficulty was labeled as \u2018Brutal\u2019.\u201c\u2026The Gate in Antarctica.\u201dTwenty-five years after the Frost Queen had been defeated, the people had experienced the horrors of Antarctica once more through the 1-star Gate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Will he be able to beat Kim Woo-joong\u2019s record of nine levels?]Seo Jun-ho started his morning with a refreshing cup of Agarit tea.\u201cMm, it\u2019s good.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The Frost Queen took a peek at his tea. She seemed to have decided something and spoke hesitantly. \u201c\u2026That tea has a fine aroma. If you so wish, I can take a sip\u2026\u201d\u201cNo can do. If you\u2019re thirsty, drink some water over there.\u201d He swatted her away as if she were a fly.\u201c\u2026I will not forget this transgression,\u201d she said coldly. She disappeared into the study. Seo Jun-ho ignored her and looked at the comments under the article.\u2013 Isn\u2019t it too early for him to go to the Cave of Trials? What level is Seo Jun-ho right now?\u2515 Isn\u2019t he around level 25? His stats aren\u2019t public.\u2013 Then it\u2019s kinda vague. Isn\u2019t it best to go to the Cave of Trials at level 30?\u2515 Who knows. The stuff that happens inside isn\u2019t known to outsiders.\u201cSo people still think that.\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded.There were two requirements in the Cave of Trials. First, you had to be between levels 25 and 30. The second was that you couldn\u2019t reveal anything that happened inside once you were out of it.\u201cThe second rule is really strict.\u201dOf course, the System couldn\u2019t control players completely. Instead, it didn\u2019t let you record or share any information about the Cave\u2014whether it be through speaking, writing or telepathy. It was a high-level feature that even Skaya couldn\u2019t crack. It was impossible for humans to break through it.Even if the world ends, I\u2019ll be the only one who knows the secret of the Cave of Trials.Seo Jun-ho had already gone to the Cave of Trials before. When he was Specter, he\u2019d entered at level 30, like most others did.It was pointless. It\u2019s better to go in as soon as possible.The Cave of Trials gave better rewards based on how much the player struggled. Its difficulty was fixed.\u00a0So if you go in when your level is lower, you\u2019ll experience the same things but get better rewards.The only person in the world who knew this was him. Seo Jun-ho took a sip of tea.The only problem right now is that I don\u2019t know if I can go in there again\u2026\u00a0He couldn\u2019t be sure. No one had ever gone into the Cave of Trials twice.There are certain conditions.\u00a0Those who possessed rewards from the Cave of Trials couldn\u2019t go in again.\u00a0But because of the Frost Queen\u2019s nucleus, I lost all the stats I gained at the Cave of Trials.If it worked in the way he thought it did, it would let him go in. Still, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal if he couldn\u2019t.I\u2019ll regain my stats as I keep leveling up anyways.But if he could go into the Cave once more, he would get all the rewards he could.\u201cHuh? Where did she go?\u201d Seo Jun-ho put his glass down and stood up to look for the Frost Queen. She appeared from behind the door, peeking out from the side.\u201c\u2026Why did you call for me?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go out to train.\u201d\u201cTo train?\u201d When she saw that he was being serious, she smirked.\u201cHmph, so the Contractor is requesting my teachings?\u201d\u201cYou know how to use Frost better than I do. There\u2019s nothing to lose.\u201d\u201cTo teach you\u2026 That means that I will become your master.\u201d She gave a smug smile and sat down on his shoulder. She nodded. \u201cLead me. Under my duty as a sovereign, I shall teach you thoroughly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not your vassal or anything\u2026 But I\u2019d be grateful if you taught me.\u201dSeo Jun-ho stepped out of the door wearing clothes suited for exercise. Before he went to the training room, he stopped by the secretary\u2019s office and called for Cha Si-eun. She put down the documents she\u2019d been organizing.\u201cYou called for me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to the training room for a special session. Please take care of everything while I\u2019m there.\u201d\u201cExcuse me? How long are you thinking of staying there?\u201d\u201cAbout two weeks.\u201d\u201c\u2026Wait. You\u2019re not gonna come out of the training room for two weeks?\u201d\u201cIt has a shower and a sleeping bag, so I can sleep there.\u201d\u201cHow about food? Shall I send meals?\u201d\u201cNo. This is good enough.\u201d Seo Jun-ho shook a small wooden case. They were pills made of grain, pine needles, prunes, chestnuts, sweet potatoes, and other similar ingredients based on the diet of Shaolin monks. They were ground and turned into bead-shaped pills and were the most convenient way to get all the nutrients he needed.They were expensive because I got them from the Black Market, but there\u2019s a small amount of magic in them too.\u00a0It was the best way to keep his body running.Cha Si-eun let out a light sigh and nodded. \u201cUnderstood. For now, I\u2019ll reject all personal commission requests and put commercial offers, advertisement offers, and sponsorships on hold.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI hope you have good results.\u201dCha Si-eun saw him off, and Seo Jun-ho headed to the training room.\u201cContractor, you can currently use two different elements.\u201d The Frost Queen paced back and forth in front of him with her hands clasped behind her back. \u201cThe first is Darkness, and the second is Frost, which is the same as mine. Am I wrong?\u201d(TN: \u2018Frost\u2019 skill is separate from the element. Also, from now on attributes \u2192 elements.)\u201cNo, that\u2019s right. But why do you bring it up?\u201d\u201cIn order to use elements, you must first understand precisely what that energy is. Let me test you. What do you think Darkness is like?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s violent and prideful, disregards others, and has a scornful nature.\u201d\u201cHoo, a decent answer. Then what do you think Frost is like?\u201d\u201c\u2026Cold?\u201d\u201cHaa.\u201d She let out a disdainful sigh. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no helping it. It\u2019s only been three months since you\u2019ve started using Frost\u2026\u201d She muttered to herself.\u201cYou could say that the Frost element is a jack of all trades. It is more aloof, haughty, and elegant than all other energies.\u201d\u201cMakes sense.\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded in understanding. \u201cI think I know what you\u2019re saying. I have to balance out the battlefield.\u201d\u201cAh!\u00a0Good, your head isn\u2019t just for decoration.\u201d She clapped and spoke cheerfully. \u201cYou are correct. Darkness, Fire, and Wind are all suited for the offensive and don\u2019t work too well in defense. Conversely, elements like Water and Earth are best used for the defensive and are wasted on attacks.\u201dAs she said, players who could only use one element were either offensive or defensive in battle. On the other hand, players who could use two or more were all-rounders.\u201cI will teach you how to use the Frost element. But before that\u2026\u201d The Frost Queen pointed her finger. At her command, a number of weapons, armor, and shields appeared in the air.\u201cMake duplicates of each one. I shall teach you thereafter.\u201d\u201cHuh? Wait. I don\u2019t want to focus on making equipment.\u201d He tried to refuse, but the Frost Queen was stubborn.\u201cThose who use the Frost element are respected by others and called one-man armies. Do you know why?\u201d\u201c\u2026Because they can create all the weapons needed, for one.\u201d Seo Jun-ho knew that all too well. \u201cI\u2019ve fought them before. It\u2019s annoying to fight enemies who keep changing and replacing their weapons.\u201dThe Frost Queen had done that as well. She smiled and nodded.\u201cI still recall that battle fondly.\u201d\u201cNot me.\u201dHe\u2019d just wanted to quickly defeat her and save his friends. But her shield was stubbornly strong, and her swords and spears were as sharp as they were cold.\u201cIf you understand, then get to it.\u201d She crossed her legs and jutted her chin. \u201cMake them.\u201d* * *Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes were closed and his face was damp with sweat. Considering that the room was chilly because of his continuous use of the Frost skill, it meant that he was sweating profusely.This is the handle\u2026\u00a0Eyes still closed, he slowly moved his hand. He pictured the Frost Queen\u2019s sword and created a similar one.Crackle.\u00a0Every time he moved his hand a bit, the moisture in the air would freeze into the shape of a sword.\u201cPhew!\u201d He finished the sword and looked nervously up at the Frost Queen. She grinned and held out her hand.\u201cShow me.\u201dThe sword floated in the air toward her. Whenever she moved her finger, the sword would turn and spin so she could inspect the details. It only took ten seconds for her to make her decision.\u201cRejected,\u201d she said firmly. She shattered his sword.\u201cUgh, why?\u201d Seo Jun-ho cried out. He\u2019d already made dozens of other attempts. He needed to make a hundred swords, but not a single one had succeeded yet. Half a day had already passed.\u201cThe blade isn\u2019t sharp enough and needs to be angled about five degrees higher. The center of weight is also a mess.\u201d\u201cDammit.\u201d He felt like she was being too strict. It wasn\u2019t like he was gonna be a blacksmith or something. Still, he was too prideful to ask her to be lax.I feel like she\u2019s getting back at me for not letting her drink the tea this morning.Either way, she had good reasons to reject him. Like she said, his sword wasn\u2019t good enough.I\u2019ll wipe that grin off her face.With a new fire burning inside of him, Seo Jun-ho started to think about how he could fix this attempt\u2019s mistakes.Meanwhile, the Frost Queen looked at him, deep in thought.He is\u2026 quite a formidable human.The weapons she made were national-level weapons that were kept in Niflheim\u2019s royal armory. They came up in fairytales and legends. It wasn\u2019t something a human could make just by looking at it a few times.But he can replicate Fragarach\u2019s appearance at 62% with only 34 attempts\u2026(TN: In Irish mythology, Fragarach was the sword of Nuada, the first high king.)Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt first, she\u2019d been planning to tease him a bit and then start teaching him properly, but now she wasn\u2019t sure. She was curious to see what would happen first: him creating the sword, or him giving up.Watching the human grow is also enjoyable.\u00a0Twenty-five years ago, Seo Jun-ho was so strong that she didn\u2019t believe it was the strength of a human from Earth.Being weakened had almost broken her. But what if someone could inherit her essence?I\u2026 I may be raising a monster.She smiled. If that was true, things would become even more fun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had dark circles, but his eyes were bright.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The Frost Queen inspected his sword carefully before nodding. Then she broke it.\u201cWh-what?! Why?! It was perfect!\u201d He looked at her in disbelief.\u201cOh, the sword itself was good. I broke it because I was frustrated.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Why was she like this?He sank to the floor, still shocked. The Frost Queen covered her mouth and giggled.\u201cYou did it, somehow. It simply took\u2026\u00a0Pfft, it took 152 tries.\u201d\u201cI did my best.\u201d\u201cI am aware. But it took you 152 attempts to create a single sword. The world isn\u2019t fair.\u201d She laughed as she completed her vengeance and checked the clock on the wall. \u201cI will give you five hours to sleep.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hoo, do I have to make spears later?\u201d\u201cNo, there will be no more weapon-making training.\u201dSeo Jun-ho looked surprised. \u201cThen what?\u201d\u201cAs you so wish, I shall teach you how to best manage Frost.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not complaining, but why all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cI am fickle. Bear that in mind.\u201d\u201cIs that something to brag about\u2026\u201d Exhaustion overtook him as he spoke, and Seo Jun-ho fell over and started to snore. He\u2019d been making swords nonstop for two days, and the fatigue had caught up to him. The Frost Queen watched over him and muttered to herself.\u201cHe has innate talent and a terrifying work ethic\u2026 The world really is unfair.\u201d She gestured with her finger, carefully covering his body with the sleeping bag.\u201c\u2026Become even stronger. So that you can protect those that are precious to you.\u201d She said it from the heart, as someone who hadn\u2019t been able to do so. Unfitting for her usually-dignified appearance, there was a sad smile on her face.* * *Knock, knock.Seo Jun-ho twitched under the drops of water that fell on his face.\u2026It\u2019s cold. Is the ceiling leaking?\u00a0He wiped his face and slowly opened his eyes.\u201cOh, you\u2019re awake?\u201d The Frost Queen was hovering over him, melting a snowball.Seo Jun-ho sensed her presence. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m a player, so my senses are heightened. You could have just told me to wake up,\u201d he muttered in annoyance.\u201cI am well aware. I simply wished to sprinkle water on your face.\u201d\u201cReally, why are you like this?\u201d Seo Jun-ho said disdainfully.His back ached as he sat up. He turned, only to find the sleeping bag next to the wall.\u201cIf you saw that I was sleeping, you should\u2019ve brought me the sleeping bag.\u201d\u201cOh my. I didn\u2019t know that we were so close.\u201d\u201cNevermind.\u201d Seo Jun-ho stood up and headed to the shower room to clean himself off. He changed into a fresh outfit, drank a bottle of water, and ate three pills for breakfast.\u201cSo what\u2019re you gonna teach me today?\u201d\u201cSpeed.\u201d\u201cSpeed?\u201d She nodded.With a flick of her wrist, a sword was created in the blink of an eye.\u201c0.28 seconds\u2026 I really have been weakened. Now, you make one.\u201d He was much slower. \u201c3.85 seconds. Do you know why there is such a difference between you and I?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a matter of practice? I started barely three months ago, but you\u2019ve had your whole life.\u201dThe Frost Queen shook her head. \u201cThat is one factor, but the difference between our methods is a fundamental issue.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d\u201cSimple.\u201d As she pointed her finger, an icicle slowly started to form. \u201cThis is how you are using your ability. And this\u2026\u201dCrackle.\u00a0A new icicle was created instantly. Unlike the other one, it had started to form from both ends.\u201cIf you freeze it from different directions, it will naturally be faster.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d Seo Jun-ho clapped his hands together. He didn\u2019t want to admit it, but she was a good teacher. The demonstration made it much easier to understand.I see. When I freeze things, it goes in one direction.When he made a sword, he started with the handle and finished on the blade. If he made an arrow, he started with the shaft and finished on the arrowhead. But if he made them at the same time, he would be much faster.\u201cNow that you understand, try it once.\u201d\u201cLike this?\u201dCrackle!\u00a0A sword was created in an instant.\u201c1.29 seconds\u2026\u201d Compared to his 3.85 seconds from before, it was much faster.\u201cNot bad. Do not forget what I just taught you.\u201d\u201cI should do some extra practice with this. I\u2019ll be concerned with a lot of other things during battle.\u201d He needed to train his muscle memory so that his body would react before his head. \u201cSo, what else are you gonna teach me?\u201d\u201c\u2026I will show this only once, so pay attention.\u201dThe Frost Queen let out a soft breath. The human was absorbing her techniques like a sponge. She wondered how long it would be until she had nothing left to teach him.It worried her a bit.* * *The secretaries were chatting after their lunch break.\u201cHaa, I\u2019m jealous of Ms. Si-eun these days.\u201d\u201cMe? Why?\u201d She asked, surprised. The other secretaries immediately answered.\u201cYour boss is player Seo Jun-ho.\u201d\u201cHasn\u2019t he been doing really well recently?\u201d\u201cYeah. He\u2019s also good-looking and well-mannered. I\u2019m so jealous.\u201d\u201cI bet Jun-ho-nim doesn\u2019t call you after hours and make you run errands in the middle of the night.\u201dCha Si-eun was flustered by the sudden slew of questions.\u201d There are players who make you go out in the middle of the night?\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying? Of course there are.\u201d\u201cMost of them, in fact.\u201d\u201cThey order you around for the smallest things.\u201dCha Si-eun sipped on her iced coffee as she listened to their complaints.\u00a0I see. I have it easy.\u00a0She looked at them in a new light.Of course, that wasn\u2019t exactly the case. They didn\u2019t know that Cha Si-eun answered over 1200 emails and 500 phone calls a day.\u201cI heard a rumor that he\u2019s in the training room right now. How long is he going to stay in there?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s about time that he comes out.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s so tenacious.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because he works that hard that he is where he is right now.\u201dIt had already been two weeks since Seo Jun-ho had entered the training room. He\u2019d told her that it would take that long, so she was expecting to see him today. And she was correct.Ping.Her Vita rang. Cha Si-eun checked the message and stood up abruptly.\u201cOh my god, he\u2019s out.\u201d\u201cWho? Player Seo Jun-ho?\u201d\u201cYou should go.\u201dCha Si-eun waved goodbye to the other secretaries and headed to the floor with restaurants. There was no need to look for Seo Jun-ho; she simply looked to where the people were staring.\u201cJun-ho-nim!\u201d\u201cSlurp.\u201d\u00a0He\u2019d finished a bowl of ramen in the short amount of time it took her to get there. He waved. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Secretary Cha.\u201d\u201cYes, it really has. But\u2026\u201d As she saw him, she felt something that she couldn\u2019t describe.\u00a0Something\u2019s changed.But she couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on what it was. There wasn\u2019t much of a physical difference, except for the fact that his hair had grown out a bit.\u2026Ah!\u00a0She realized that the piercing look in his eyes had softened to become like any other person\u2019s. Cha Si-eun immediately understood what it meant.\u201cCongratulations on your mastery.\u201d\u201cThank you. You have keen eyes.\u201d He mixed his bibimbap, looking embarrassed. \u201cIt\u2019s not all that amazing,\u201d he muttered.\u201cThey say that master fighters check their opponents\u2019 eyes first.\u201d That was because most of them had a sharp look in their eyes. When Gong Juha had first met Seo Jun-ho, she\u2019d tried to scout him because of that. Even though other forces and energies were more easily masked, the eyes were hard to conceal.It\u2019s a good thing that I learned.\u00a0When he had been Specter, he\u2019d perfected the concealment of his powers. But the reason his eyes were so bright now was because of the Frost skill. It was so powerful that it made it hard to conceal.The Frost Queen was super helpful.\u00a0That was old news by now. After he\u2019d learned to properly handle the Frost element, he had reached another level of mastery. Even though his stats were the same as they were two weeks ago, he was at least 1.5 times stronger now. This was why players had to continue to train and fine-tune their skills.\u201cYou came at a good time. I was planning to book a plane ticket.\u201d\u201cWhere to\u2026 Oh.\u201d She realized in the middle of her sentence that it was pointless to ask. \u201cTo the Tibetan region in China. I\u2019ll book a flight for tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Seo Jun-ho smiled brightly. His secretary was quite skilled.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho suddenly stopped in his tracks and turned around. Mountaintops and plateaus filled his vision as far as the eye could see.\u201cThis is a beautiful place. I never thought the human world would be filled with this many peculiar castles.\u201d Even the Frost Queen was impressed.The Tibetan Plateaus, also called \u201cthe Roof of the World\u201d, was a peculiar place that boasted an average elevation of 4,500 meters. It was a place where prophets had come to seek asceticism, as well as a popular tourist spot with millions of visitors every year.And thirty years ago, it had become a sacred place for players.\u201cIs the Cave of Trials here?\u201dSeo Jun-ho nodded. \u201cYeah, we just have to go a little bit further.\u201d\u201cMake haste. I want to see it as soon as possible.\u201d Seo Jun-ho let the Frost Queen pull at his hair and started to walk again. He arrived at the Cave of Trials three hours later.The Cave\u2019s entrance was inside a Tibetan tribe\u2019s large tent, which measured thousands of square meters.\u201cWelcome, traveler. My name is Jampa, and I am the caretaker here.\u201d(TN: He refers to SJH as \u2018ascetic\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t translate well.)He was wearing clothes typical of the Tibetan tribes and had his tongue stuck out in greeting. It was an unfamiliar and curious gesture, but it was a greeting unique to the Tibetans.I was confused when I first saw it.The same was true for the Frost Queen. She pulled at Seo Jun-ho\u2019s hair, sounding confused.\u201cC-Contractor, that man stuck his tongue out at you. Why did he do that?\u201d\u201cThank you for welcoming me. I see that\u2019s the traditional Tibetan greeting.\u201d\u201cAh, so you know. The Association contacted me ahead of time. Let me show you to your room.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Seo Jun-ho held out his bag and shook his head. \u201cPlease just put my luggage away.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be going to the Cave right away.\u201dHe\u2019d rested up on the plane and had warmed up his body on the hike up the mountain. His body was at its best condition right now.\u201cHo, I understand. I will escort you.\u201dSeo Jun-ho gave his bag to someone else and headed deeper into the tent. Unlike most tents, the walls were thick and didn\u2019t let in any wind, and it was large enough to hold hundreds of rooms.\u201cIt\u2019s slippery, so please watch your feet.\u201dThey started down a staircase that led below. As they got deeper and deeper, the walls around them started to change into the walls of a cave. After descending for a long time, they reached a cool, empty cavern. The Gate stood in front of them.\u201cThis is the Cave of Trials.\u201dIt looked exactly the same as the last time he had come. In fact, he felt nostalgic.\u201cGate information.\u201d\u27eaCave of Trials\u27ebEntry Requirements: Levels 25\u201330Party Cap: \u221eClear Requirements: \u221eDifficulty: \u221eThe Cave of Trials was known as the most peculiar Gate that had shown up in the last thirty years. There were plenty of Uncleared Gates, but the Cave of Trials was unclearable by design. It also evaluated each player on its own terms.[Cave of Trials Rankings]1. Specter \u2013 9th level1.

If you survived the horrors of the 9th level, it wasn\u2019t easy to move on to the 10th.\u201cWe don\u2019t know much about the Gate, so I don\u2019t have much to offer.

Seo Jun-ho left him behind and entered the Cave. As soon as he entered, a message popped up.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[Error.][Second entry.

It was a bleak expanse.\u201cContractor, I believe that the Cave of Trials is a place that disciplines your spirit.\u201d\u201c\u2026No, it\u2019s not usually like this,\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered, knitting his eyebrows. The last time he had entered, it had been a normal-looking cave.If I look at the message\u2026 Is it a problem because this is my second time entering?Then what would happen to him? He tilted his head.Riiip! The space ripped open, and a gentleman stepped out. He wore chestnut-brown dress shoes and a gray frock coat. He wore a top hat reminiscent of an old English gentleman. The brim was wide, so Seo Jun-ho couldn\u2019t see his face clearly.Tak, tak. He tapped his cane on the ground.\u298a \u201cHello. I am the 1st Floor Administrator, Gray,\u201d he said politely.\u201c\u20261st Floor Administrator? Does that mean you\u2019re Earth\u2019s god?\u201dGray laughed lightly at his question and shook his head.\u298a \u201cOf course not. I was simply ordered by them to manage the 1st floor\u2026 You can think of me as a civil servant of sorts.\u201d\u201cBut if you manage Earth, doesn\u2019t that make you something of a god?\u201d\u298a \u201cIt\u2019s different. I didn\u2019t even know this planet existed until about thirty years ago. Additionally, I only manage Gates, monsters, and floors.\u201d He cut himself off and smiled brightly. \u201cAnyhow, seeing a familiar face is a small joy.\u201d\u201cYou know me?\u201d\u298a \u201cOf course. Player Specter. I\u2019ve been watching you for thirty years. It\u2019s late, but congratulations on your return.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dSeo Jun-ho didn\u2019t even know such a being existed, but the Administrator seemed to know him. It was a strange feeling.\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\u298a \u201cThere\u2019s no reason I wouldn\u2019t. You are Niflheim\u2019s Queen, the sovereign who controls all the cold in the world.\u201d\u201cC-contractor\u2026\u201d Her voice shook as she pulled on Seo Jun-ho\u2019s hair. \u201cDid you hear that? You heard that, right? The Floor Administrator knows who I am!\u201d\u201c\u2026He knows me too.\u201d He ignored her haughtiness and got straight to the point. \u201cSo, where is this place?\u201d\u298a \u201cIt\u2019s a virtual space that I created to meet you. There\u2019s a problem, you see.\u201d Gray held out his hand, and a thick book appeared. The book fluttered open on its own, stopping on a certain page.\u298a \u201cMhm, I was right. It says in the record that Specter-nim entered the Cave of Trials 28 years, 7 months, 16 days, 13 hours and 32 minutes ago.\u201d Tap. He closed the book. \u201cAnd those who have received the rewards from the Cave cannot enter a second time. You are aware, correct?\u201d\u201cYes. But I\u2019m not Specter anymore. I\u2019m Seo Jun-ho.\u201d\u298a \u201cThe nature of your existence does not change simply because you change your name.\u201d\u201cBut what if I don\u2019t have the rewards?\u201d\u298a \u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cI mean exactly what I said. I don\u2019t have the rewards I received from the Cave of Trials. Not a single one.\u201d He spread his arms as if to prove his point.\u298a \u201cHm?\u201d Gray sounded curious. He took off his hat, revealing his narrow, closed eyes. \u201cLet me see\u2026\u201d He smiled with his eyes and opened them slightly. At the same time, Seo Jun-ho felt like a bug was crawling across his body.He\u2019s examining me. He felt like a rat being observed by a viper.\u298a \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Gray was silent for a moment before he closed his eyes again. \u201cSo it\u2019s true.\u201dHe put on his hat again and slowly started to tap on the floor with his cane.Tak, tak, tak.\u298a \u201cThis is quite the predicament. You have entered the Cave of Trials\u2026 Yet you do not currently possess its rewards.\u201d\u201cAccording to the rules, there\u2019s no reason why I shouldn\u2019t be able to enter.\u201d\u298a \u201cThat\u2019s not untrue. But I will be the one to make that decision as the Administrator.\u201d He said this politely, but he was warning Seo Jun-ho to wait until he made his decision. About a minute passed, and Gray finally stopped tapping.\u298a \u201cHmm. The problem lies in fairness. You\u2019ve already entered the Cave of Trials, so you know what kind of challenges will appear. I think that it\u2019s unfair to other players.\u201d\u201cThen how about you raise the difficulty to balance it out?\u201d Seo Jun-ho asked.\u298a \u201c\u2026You wish to raise the difficulty? Are you sure you will be able to handle that?\u201d\u201cI have to, if that\u2019s the only way I can enter.\u201d Gray chuckled at his dry response.\u298a \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re honest or just childish\u2026\u201d He laughed for a while and nodded happily. \u201cUnderstood. You\u2019ve entertained me plenty in the past, so you deserve this level of service.\u201dTak. Gray tapped his cane once more.\u298a \u201cWith the authority of the 1st Floor Administrator, I will allow Seo Jun-ho-nim to enter once more. However, I will change the difficulty and the subject of the Trials a bit,\u201d he declared.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u298a \u201cI hope you have fun, then.\u201d With his elegant goodbye, Gray turned to leave, but the Frost Queen interrupted him.\u201cWait. Can you tell me why I lost my memories?\u201d\u298a \u201c\u2026Memories, you say.\u201d He turned his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. But everything happens for a reason. I think it will be alright even if you don\u2019t find them again.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking because it\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\u298a \u201cI cannot say anything about that. I\u2019m busy, so goodbye.\u201d Gray turned around again, and he stepped through a rip in space. The Frost Queen watched him disappear.\u201c\u2026I cannot tell what he is thinking.\u201d\u201cHe seemed to know you. Do you have no memory of him?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s even more frustrating. I recall nothing about the floors.\u201d She let out a soft sigh and looked up at him. \u201cAnyways, it turned out well for you. We didn\u2019t ride the floaty-float here for nothing.\u201dBy \u201cfloaty-float\u201d, she meant the airplane.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that we were able to resolve this.\u201dSeo Jun-ho closed his eyes. When he opened them again, the area around him had changed; they were inside of a cool, humid cave. It looked just as he remembered.\u201cI heard that there are ten levels. What kind of Trials appear?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I can\u2019t really tell you in detail.\u201d Seo Jun-ho paused, then sighed. \u201cBut this Gate has everything you can imagine,\u201d he muttered.* * *The Cave of Trials was divided into ten levels, and the mechanics were simple.[Level 1: The Magic Trial will now begin.]As the system message rang, numerous balls formed inside the cavern. They were blue spheres of different sizes.[Please pop the balls using magic.]\u201cThis seems too easy.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s level 1. It\u2019s like a tutorial,\u201d Seo Jun-ho replied lazily, arms crossed. He pushed his magic outward.Pop! Pop! Pop!The cave was filled with the loud popping noises. It sounded like dozens of balloons were being popped. It took him twelve seconds to pop all the balls in the large cavern.\u201cNot bad. Of course, I would have been able to do it in less than a second.\u201d\u201cStop bluffing. You lie every time you open your mouth,\u201d Seo Jun-ho snorted.[You have cleared the Magic Trial.][If you wish to continue, please say \u2018Go\u2019. If you wish to stop, please say \u2018Stop\u2019.][The next level is the Gravity Trial.]His answer was obvious. \u201cGo.\u201d[You have selected to challenge the 2nd level. A rest room will be created.]One of the walls shone brightly, and a door appeared. Inside were food, drinks, a bed, and a bathroom.\u201cContractor, you are not planning to rest already, are you?\u201d\u201c\u2018Course not.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t even warmed up yet. \u201cContinue to level 2.\u201d[Level 2: The Gravity Trial will now begin.]\u201cKeuk\u2026!\u201dIn this Trial, the force of gravity on the body changed every minute.Right now\u2026 It\u2019s a little heavy. It was about five times the force he usually felt.Just like this, the force would change as many as sixty times in an hour. Last time, it lasted for five hours\u2026 Who knew what would happen this time.After one minute passed, his body started to float in the air.\u201cGeez, why does this always happen to me?\u201dHe floated in the air with a nauseous expression until the gravity changed again.\u201cContractor, you should not pass up this valuable opportunity.\u201d\u201cOpportunity?\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure what she meant.\u201cThere won\u2019t be many times in your life where you will be under such strenuous circumstances.\u201d She sounded excited. \u201cYou should train.\u201d\u201c\u2026In this state? It might look easy, but\u2014Gah!\u201dThe gravity changed again, and Seo Jun-ho\u2019s body fell to the ground with a loud slam.Eight times stronger!It was hard to even look up, but the Frost Queen was relentless.\u201cA strong body comes from a strong mind.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me to\u2026 Huff, huff.\u201d It took much more effort than usual to simply talk. His lungs strained to help him breathe. \u201cDo push-ups or something?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea either.\u201d The Frost Queen looked around the cavern. \u201cAnd once you become accustomed to the weight, you should start running.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d He thought that she was being unreasonable.\u201cIf you\u2019re able to move freely no matter how light or heavy your body is, it will be extremely helpful in the future.\u201d\u201cEasier said than done.\u201d\u201cI will not force you to do it. I\u2019m simply suggesting a path you can take to become stronger.\u201dUltimately, it was up to Seo Jun-ho himself.\u201c\u2026Dammit,\u201d he grumbled. If she put it like that, he had no choice but to do it. He didn\u2019t want to give up a chance to get stronger simply because he was scared of tiring out.\u201cHnnnn!\u201d He put all his strength into his arms and slowly pushed off the ground. His whole body trembled. He couldn\u2019t even go up all the way. He wanted to let go and lay back down.But\u2026Even though Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t trust the Frost Queen yet, he\u2019d learned in the past two weeks that her methods were effective.I have no choice but to follow.Eyes full of spite, Seo Jun-ho slowly lowered his body.The level 2 Trial lasted for 24 hours.* * *[You have cleared the Gravity Trial.][If you wish to continue, please say \u2018Go\u2019. If you wish to stop, please say \u2018Stop\u2019.][The next level is the Phantom Trial.]Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t have the strength to speak. He laid on the ground, staring up at the cavern ceiling.\u201cContractor, you look exhausted.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He tried to say with his eyes that he was really fucking tired, but he also tried to relay his thanks.The Cave of Trials rewards the player based on their effort. The Trial had lasted much longer than last time, and he had also trained during it.The force of gravity returned to normal, and Seo Jun-ho felt three times lighter than usual. Once he leaves the Cave, the rewards would make him even stronger.\u201c\u2026Phew.\u201d After a long while, he finally stood up.\u201cContractor, what is the next Trial?\u201d\u201c\u2026The Phantom Trial.\u201d His face was grim. The Phantom Trial showed players hallucinations. In the past, he\u2019d seen his parents.I fought like crazy to save them from monsters. He\u2019d suffered for half a day until it was finally over.At his current state, he wasn\u2019t worried about fighting for half a day. He was worried about something else.\u201cWhy are you looking at me? I feel as if you are boring a hole through my head.\u201d\u2026I feel like it\u2019s either going to be her or the others this time. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to handle it.He had a strong feeling that he would have to fight either the Frost Queen or his four friends.It would be a lot easier if it were the Frost Queen\u2026 But I feel like it\u2019s gonna be my friends.And because of Keen Intuition (B), he\u2019d never been wrong about these things.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He scratched his head and looked around. \u201cAh\u2026\u201dHis voice was hoarse from how long he\u2019d slept. He started to remember last night.I came to the rest room after finishing the Gravity Trial.It had a refrigerator full of food and a bathroom with a shower booth, but he\u2019d been so tired that he had simply gone to sleep.\u201cWell, at least I made it to the bed somehow.\u201d He vaguely remembered collapsing at the entrance, but seeing as how he woke up on a bed, it was probably a dream. As he looked around, his eyes landed on the Frost Queen, who had wrapped herself in tissue and was fast asleep. She let out even breaths as she slept, and for some reason, she reminded him of a hamster.Shower first.\u00a0He cleaned himself off in the bathroom. It was well-equipped with shampoo, conditioner, and even a toothbrush and toothpaste. When he came out, he found the Frost Queen sitting up with her head hunched. She still wasn\u2019t fully awake.\u201cAre you up?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to ask\u2026 If I slept well\u2026\u201d(TN: She uses a very formal/old-fashioned phrase, implying that she\u2019s above SJH in status.)\u201cDo you think I would?\u201dSeo Jun-ho smirked and took out cereal, a banana, and an apple from the refrigerator for breakfast.\u201cHmmm.\u00a0Is your body alright?\u201d She seemed to be more awake now, stretching as she spoke.\u201cSomehow. I think I slept for twelve hours.\u201d\u201cYou are at a healthy age, so I suppose it wasn\u2019t too much of a problem,\u201d she muttered, sounding like an old woman. She sat down in her seat on Seo Jun-ho\u2019s shoulder.\u201cToday will be harder than yesterday.\u201d\u201cAs it should be. It would be quite boring if the difficulty decreased as the level increased.\u201dSeo Jun-ho stepped out of the rest room and spoke.\u201cI wish to continue to the Phantom Trial.\u201d[Level 3: The Phantom Trial will now begin.]Woosh!\u00a0The torches in the cave fizzled out along with the message. When they flickered on again, there were four figures standing in the middle of the cavern.\u201cOh my. Are those not your comrades?\u201d\u201cI knew it\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho bit his lower lip and looked around. His former comrades, the four heroes, surrounded him.\u201cSeo Jun-ho, why did you throw us away?\u201d\u201cDid you want to live on by yourself?\u201d\u201cYou promised to come back\u2026 You said we\u2019d meet again\u2026\u201d\u201cTraitor. Liar.\u201dTheir faces were contorted in a way he\u2019d never seen before as insults poured out of their mouths.\u201cContractor, pay them no mind. They are all\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, they\u2019re hallucinations. I know\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho unsheathed his sword, his eyes as cold as ice.\u201cIt feels a lot worse than I expected.\u201dThe hallucinations cursed him with the same voices, faces, and bodies as his friends.\u201cThose idiots. They sent me up knowing that they would die.\u201d The part that made Seo Jun-ho the most upset was the way that the hallucinations were denying his friends\u2019 resolve. \u201cI won\u2019t let you insult them like this.\u201d\u201cJun-ho. If you still think of us as your friends, you should just die.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so cold here. The Frost Queen\u2019s power is still keeping us frozen.\u201dJun-ho. Jun-ho.He\u2019d wanted more than anything to hear those familiar voices again. But he ignored them all.\u201cContractor, can you defeat them?\u201d\u201cYes. The Cave of Trials does not send you enemies you can\u2019t defeat.\u201d They were likely weakened to a state that he could fight them in.There\u2019s no problem, then.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho gathered his magic. He leapt off the ground and swung Black Dragon Fang. It left a jet-black afterimage as it felled the hallucinations.\u201cHow could you?!\u201d\u201cGilbert!\u201d\u201cI got it!\u201dAt Skaya\u2019s command, Gilbert fell to the rear and took out an enormous sniper rifle. At the same time, Rahmadat Khali blocked him with his large body.They\u2019ve even got all the details down.\u00a0Their tactics had been based off of his memories.\u00a0Then that means\u2026Seo Jun-ho turned around. Tenmei Mio would take advantage of the confusion and assassinate him from behind. Her position was always the same.Slash!\u00a0A katana cut across Seo Jun-ho\u2019s forehead. If he\u2019d been a little slower, his head would have gone flying.Dammit, the hallucination is fucking fast.\u00a0Not only that, she was using her family\u2019s sword technique, \u2018Tenmei-ryu\u2019, perfectly. Seo Jun-ho scowled and kicked her in the stomach, sending her flying into the cavern wall. Behind him, he heard a gunshot.I\u2019ll die if I get hit.\u00a0If he got hit by one of Gilbert\u2019s bullets, it was game over. They would be filled with magic that would make them spin and tear up his insides.Crackle!\u00a0Three ice shields formed around him at the speed of light. However, they weren\u2019t as good as the Frost Queen\u2019s. He layered them together.And if that\u2019s the Gilbert I know\u2026\u00a0Three ice shields wouldn\u2019t be enough to block his shot. He fully expected the bullet, and it came a moment later, ripping through his shields. But it had lost most of its momentum by the time it reached him.Slash!\u00a0Seo Jun-ho swung Black Dragon Fang, cutting the bullet in half.And right about now\u2026Seo Jun-ho leapt off the ground, sprinting across the cavern wall and toward the ceiling. Ivy shot out where he\u2019d been standing.\u201cThe bastard dodged it!\u201d\u201cI got him!\u201d Rahmadat leapt off the ground. His enormous body flew toward him in a straight line, and Seo Jun-ho frowned.The hallucination and the real thing are the same\u2026 He was as unsophisticated as always and left his back open.\u201cJun-ho, you\u2019ve gotten a lot scrawnier!\u201d Rahmadat bellowed and swung a punch at Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face.Woosh!\u00a0The air screamed as his fist came forward. If Seo Jun-ho was hit, he would be knocked out.We can\u2019t have that.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho made the darkness explode, blocking Rahmadat\u2019s sight.\u201cHa!\u00a0This is nothing!\u201d His fist ripped through the air where Seo Jun-ho had been.\u201cI always told you, didn\u2019t I? You only ever look forward and leave your back open.\u201dSeo Jun-ho had used Shadow Step to travel across the shadows made by the flickering torchlight and appeared behind Rahmadat. There was no way he\u2019d let him get away. Black Dragon Fang stabbed through his back.\u201cKeuh!\u201d\u201cRahmadat!\u201d\u201cDammit, support him!\u201dDozens of bullets and fireballs flew below him, and Seo Jun-ho swung Rahmadat\u2019s body around to use it as a shield. The gruesome sound of tearing flesh filled the air, but Rahmadat only laughed.\u201cWhy are you using others as you please, you bastard?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t leave your back open.\u201d\u201cSince you\u2019re done using me, pay up!\u201d Rahmadat\u2019s broken flesh mended at an unfathomable speed. He ignored the sword in his chest and reached behind him, planning to crush Seo Jun-ho\u2019s skull in his hand.Slash!\u00a0But Seo Jun-ho pulled out Black Dragon Fang and stepped out of his reach.\u201cNight Walking.\u201dHe became one with the darkness and melted down to the ground to check the battlefield.\u201cIt\u2019s Night Walking.\u201d\u201c\u2026Skaya, please track him.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mio. I\u2019m already on my way.\u201dRahmadat had recovered from all his injuries at some point and tossed aside his blood-drenched shirt.\u201cHe\u2019s watching and waiting for an opportunity like a rat. Get it together, everyone. Our opponent is Specter.\u201dSeo Jun-ho was annoyed by the way they were talking \u2018realistically\u2019. At that moment, the Frost Queen spoke. She\u2019d been watching quietly the whole time.\u201cThat muscle giant seems to have an ability that lets him heal his wounds as well as an overabundance of power.\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s why he\u2019s annoying to fight.\u201d In order to defeat him, Seo Jun-ho either had to land multiple hits to make him unable to regenerate, or make him use up all his magic. But that was impossible when the others would be watching so closely.\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019ll be better to take care of the others first.\u201d\u201cAn excellent choice. Then, who will you kill first?\u201d\u201cGilbert and Mio don\u2019t have good defense. If I attack them while I\u2019m using Shadow Walking, I can start by taking one of them down.\u201dThe problem was Skaya. Most people thought that mages had low defense\u2014and they were generally right. But when you got within a certain distance, no one was able to compare to their shields.\u201cSkaya protects her body with eight mana shields 24/7.\u201d\u201cWhat a nuisance. Then in what order will you take them down?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll kill Gilbert and freeze Rahmadat\u2019s body at the same time.\u201d Of course, with his strength, the ice would be broken instantly. But Seo Jun-ho thought that he could take down the other two during that short amount of time.\u201cIt would be nice if I could use Night Walking again\u2026 But they won\u2019t give me the opportunity.\u201d They weren\u2019t the kind of people who would let him use the same trick twice. \u201cNext time, Skaya will use her magic detection to find me. Even now, she\u2019s tracing me.\u201d\u201cThen that skill will be useless.\u201d\u201cYeah, so I\u2019ll have to face them head-on.\u201d It would take Rahmadat around five seconds to break out of the ice and catch him. He would have to take out both Gilbert and Mio in order to win. Seo Jun-ho looked at the Frost Queen.\u201cThe thing you showed me last time can distract Skaya and Rahmadat, right?\u201d\u201cYes, but it will consume a sizable amount of your mental power.\u201dIf his mental energy fell in the middle of battle, he would get dizzy and his movements would become sluggish. But Seo Jun-ho thought that it was worth the risk.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Besides, it\u2019ll be more advantageous for me if this drags out.\u201dRahmadat had regeneration, stamina, and destructive power.Skaya had a seemingly endless amount of magic and wisdom.Meanwhile, Gilbert had his focus, and Mio had her composure.For them, a dragged-out battle was suicide.\u201cHow many seconds do you think you can buy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The Frost Queen pouted and muttered her answer, clearly displeased. \u201cThirty seconds\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you sure? Even if they\u2019re weakened, they shouldn\u2019t be underestimated.\u201d\u201cSometimes I feel as if you forget who I am.\u201d She muttered something about her desolate circumstance and slowly raised her hand. She looked up at Seo Jun-ho. \u201cDo not worry about me and concentrate on your own role.\u201d\u201cUse as much as you want, so just hold out for thirty seconds.\u201d\u201cGladly.\u201d The Frost Queen looked forward and held out her hand. \u201cMy soldiers! Arise from the cold earth and fell your enemies!\u201d\u201cKeuk\u2026!\u201d As she cried out, he felt a stinging in his head. It was similar to a brain freeze after eating ice cream too quickly.But\u2026 That\u2019s not bad.Frost energy filled the cavern, and ice golems were created. They looked big enough to overpower Rahmadat.\u201cWhat are those?\u201d\u201cBe careful! Specter is using a new ability!\u201d The hallucinations\u2019 attention turned to the golems, and Seo Jun-ho took the opportunity to launch his attack.I can\u2019t do this again.\u00a0Even if they were hallucinations, he was killing the figures of his friends. He didn\u2019t want to go through this again.\u201cGuh\u2026?\u201d Seo Jun-ho used Night Walking to quietly appear behind Gilbert and stab his heart. The cold feeling seeped into his chest, and Gilbert realized that he was dying. He knew that he didn\u2019t have much time left and reached over his waist.Tch\u2026 They got all the unnecessary details down.Gilbert grabbed the revolver from his belt, blood dripping from his mouth. With the last of his strength, he pushed his body back.\u201cGah!\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s back slammed into the cavern wall.\u00a0Click!\u00a0Gilbert loaded the bullet and pressed the muzzle to Seo Jun-ho\u2019s chin.\u201cYou won\u2019t\u2026 be able to dodge this.\u201dGilbert had always been tenacious. If he was gonna go down, he would take his enemy with him. He pulled the trigger.Click! Click!No bullet came.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d Shocked, Gilbert quickly checked his revolver. The barrel had frozen over, blocking the bullet from exiting.Slash!\u00a0Seo Jun-ho took the opportunity to twist his sword inside Gilbert\u2019s chest.\u201cKeuk!\u201d\u00a0Blood poured from his mouth, and his body started to crumble.I can\u2019t stop.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t give the crumbling hallucination a second glance and held out his hand.Crackle!\u00a0Frost energy shot out toward Rahmadat, freezing his enormous body.\u201cLet me go, you bastard!!!\u201d His bellow resonated and shook the cave, shattering the ice that covered his body.\u201cThat crazy\u2026 He broke the ice with his roar?\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face fell. He crouched his stance, preparing to face Rahmadat.\u201cContractor! Don\u2019t mind him and do what you have to!\u201d Four golems attacked Rahmadat and Skaya, slowing them down.\u201cNice! Just a bit more!\u201d Seo Jun-ho shouted. He quickly turned around, sensing something ominous.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMio stood behind him, gripping her katana. There should not have been any wind in the cave, but her ponytail swayed.She\u2019s angry.\u00a0She was quiet and composed most of the time, but her anger was terrifying. A wild storm of magic surrounded her. His hair stood on end as he faced her.\u201cThe fucking Cave of Trials\u2026 Are you sure I can defeat them?\u201dReaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Castor][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Return of the Frozen Player 062The Cave of Trials (2)\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d It took Seo Jun-ho great effort to open his eyes. He scratched his head and looked around. \u201cAh\u2026\u201dHis voice was hoarse from how long he\u2019d slept. He started to remember last night.I came to the rest room after finishing the Gravity Trial.It had a refrigerator full of food and a bathroom with a shower booth, but he\u2019d been so tired that he had simply gone to sleep.\u201cWell, at least I made it to the bed somehow.\u201d He vaguely remembered collapsing at the entrance, but seeing as how he woke up on a bed, it was probably a dream. As he looked around, his eyes landed on the Frost Queen, who had wrapped herself in tissue and was fast asleep. She let out even breaths as she slept, and for some reason, she reminded him of a hamster.Shower first.\u00a0He cleaned himself off in the bathroom. It was well-equipped with shampoo, conditioner, and even a toothbrush and toothpaste. When he came out, he found the Frost Queen sitting up with her head hunched. She still wasn\u2019t fully awake.\u201cAre you up?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to ask\u2026 If I slept well\u2026\u201d(TN: She uses a very formal/old-fashioned phrase, implying that she\u2019s above SJH in status.)\u201cDo you think I would?\u201dSeo Jun-ho smirked and took out cereal, a banana, and an apple from the refrigerator for breakfast.\u201cHmmm.\u00a0Is your body alright?\u201d She seemed to be more awake now, stretching as she spoke.\u201cSomehow. I think I slept for twelve hours.\u201d\u201cYou are at a healthy age, so I suppose it wasn\u2019t too much of a problem,\u201d she muttered, sounding like an old woman. She sat down in her seat on Seo Jun-ho\u2019s shoulder.\u201cToday will be harder than yesterday.\u201d\u201cAs it should be. It would be quite boring if the difficulty decreased as the level increased.\u201dSeo Jun-ho stepped out of the rest room and spoke.\u201cI wish to continue to the Phantom Trial.\u201d[Level 3: The Phantom Trial will now begin.]Woosh!\u00a0The torches in the cave fizzled out along with the message. When they flickered on again, there were four figures standing in the middle of the cavern.\u201cOh my. Are those not your comrades?\u201d\u201cI knew it\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho bit his lower lip and looked around. His former comrades, the four heroes, surrounded him.\u201cSeo Jun-ho, why did you throw us away?\u201d\u201cDid you want to live on by yourself?\u201d\u201cYou promised to come back\u2026 You said we\u2019d meet again\u2026\u201d\u201cTraitor. Liar.\u201dTheir faces were contorted in a way he\u2019d never seen before as insults poured out of their mouths.\u201cContractor, pay them no mind. They are all\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, they\u2019re hallucinations. I know\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho unsheathed his sword, his eyes as cold as ice.\u201cIt feels a lot worse than I expected.\u201dThe hallucinations cursed him with the same voices, faces, and bodies as his friends.\u201cThose idiots. They sent me up knowing that they would die.\u201d The part that made Seo Jun-ho the most upset was the way that the hallucinations were denying his friends\u2019 resolve. \u201cI won\u2019t let you insult them like this.\u201d\u201cJun-ho. If you still think of us as your friends, you should just die.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so cold here. The Frost Queen\u2019s power is still keeping us frozen.\u201dJun-ho. Jun-ho.He\u2019d wanted more than anything to hear those familiar voices again. But he ignored them all.\u201cContractor, can you defeat them?\u201d\u201cYes. The Cave of Trials does not send you enemies you can\u2019t defeat.\u201d They were likely weakened to a state that he could fight them in.There\u2019s no problem, then.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho gathered his magic. He leapt off the ground and swung Black Dragon Fang. It left a jet-black afterimage as it felled the hallucinations.\u201cHow could you?!\u201d\u201cGilbert!\u201d\u201cI got it!\u201dAt Skaya\u2019s command, Gilbert fell to the rear and took out an enormous sniper rifle. At the same time, Rahmadat Khali blocked him with his large body.They\u2019ve even got all the details down.\u00a0Their tactics had been based off of his memories.\u00a0Then that means\u2026Seo Jun-ho turned around. Tenmei Mio would take advantage of the confusion and assassinate him from behind. Her position was always the same.Slash!\u00a0A katana cut across Seo Jun-ho\u2019s forehead. If he\u2019d been a little slower, his head would have gone flying.Dammit, the hallucination is fucking fast.\u00a0Not only that, she was using her family\u2019s sword technique, \u2018Tenmei-ryu\u2019, perfectly. Seo Jun-ho scowled and kicked her in the stomach, sending her flying into the cavern wall. Behind him, he heard a gunshot.I\u2019ll die if I get hit.\u00a0If he got hit by one of Gilbert\u2019s bullets, it was game over. They would be filled with magic that would make them spin and tear up his insides.Crackle!\u00a0Three ice shields formed around him at the speed of light. However, they weren\u2019t as good as the Frost Queen\u2019s. He layered them together.And if that\u2019s the Gilbert I know\u2026\u00a0Three ice shields wouldn\u2019t be enough to block his shot. He fully expected the bullet, and it came a moment later, ripping through his shields. But it had lost most of its momentum by the time it reached him.Slash!\u00a0Seo Jun-ho swung Black Dragon Fang, cutting the bullet in half.And right about now\u2026Seo Jun-ho leapt off the ground, sprinting across the cavern wall and toward the ceiling. Ivy shot out where he\u2019d been standing.\u201cThe bastard dodged it!\u201d\u201cI got him!\u201d Rahmadat leapt off the ground. His enormous body flew toward him in a straight line, and Seo Jun-ho frowned.The hallucination and the real thing are the same\u2026 He was as unsophisticated as always and left his back open.\u201cJun-ho, you\u2019ve gotten a lot scrawnier!\u201d Rahmadat bellowed and swung a punch at Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face.Woosh!\u00a0The air screamed as his fist came forward. If Seo Jun-ho was hit, he would be knocked out.We can\u2019t have that.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho made the darkness explode, blocking Rahmadat\u2019s sight.\u201cHa!\u00a0This is nothing!\u201d His fist ripped through the air where Seo Jun-ho had been.\u201cI always told you, didn\u2019t I? You only ever look forward and leave your back open.\u201dSeo Jun-ho had used Shadow Step to travel across the shadows made by the flickering torchlight and appeared behind Rahmadat. There was no way he\u2019d let him get away. Black Dragon Fang stabbed through his back.\u201cKeuh!\u201d\u201cRahmadat!\u201d\u201cDammit, support him!\u201dDozens of bullets and fireballs flew below him, and Seo Jun-ho swung Rahmadat\u2019s body around to use it as a shield. The gruesome sound of tearing flesh filled the air, but Rahmadat only laughed.\u201cWhy are you using others as you please, you bastard?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t leave your back open.\u201d\u201cSince you\u2019re done using me, pay up!\u201d Rahmadat\u2019s broken flesh mended at an unfathomable speed. He ignored the sword in his chest and reached behind him, planning to crush Seo Jun-ho\u2019s skull in his hand.Slash!\u00a0But Seo Jun-ho pulled out Black Dragon Fang and stepped out of his reach.\u201cNight Walking.\u201dHe became one with the darkness and melted down to the ground to check the battlefield.\u201cIt\u2019s Night Walking.\u201d\u201c\u2026Skaya, please track him.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mio. I\u2019m already on my way.\u201dRahmadat had recovered from all his injuries at some point and tossed aside his blood-drenched shirt.\u201cHe\u2019s watching and waiting for an opportunity like a rat. Get it together, everyone. Our opponent is Specter.\u201dSeo Jun-ho was annoyed by the way they were talking \u2018realistically\u2019. At that moment, the Frost Queen spoke.

    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of the Frozen PlayerCH 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Tenmei Clan was a family of sword-users embedded deep into Japan\u2019s history. As the eldest daughter, Mio had mastered their secret technique. She had a natural talent for swordplay, and people had called her the High Blade.If you challenge her to a swordfight, you\u2019re just asking to be crushed.Seo Jun-ho used to spar with her often. His current record was 151 losses and 1 win. She\u2019d defeated him nearly every time.Of course, that only applies to when we only use sword skills. If they were allowed to use their other abilities, even Mio herself acknowledged that Seo Jun-ho would win. But her current state wasn\u2019t something to take lightly.It\u2019s my first time seeing Mio so angry.Even though she didn\u2019t show it, she treasured her friends\u2014and she\u2019d just witnessed Gilbert die before her. If the elaborate fake had copied the real one perfectly, she would be seething from head to toe.I\u2019ll have to use that. Even if it was dirty and underhanded, there was nothing else he could do. He only had 27 seconds left.Seo Jun-ho kicked Gilbert\u2019s corpse. \u201cWhat a weakling. He fell for such an obvious trap. He was cowardly until his death.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMio\u2019s whole body started to tremble.\u201cTake that back!\u201d\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201dShe sprinted across the ground, her body crouching low like a bird.Actually, one of her ancestors came up with this technique after watching a low-flying swallow.It wasn\u2019t a technique that just anyone could learn. There was a big risk of injuring the lower back, so you needed to be relaxed yet firm. It was a technique that required an inborn trait rather than effort.It\u2019s a good technique, but\u2026 Seo Jun-ho would be the one to receive it, and he knew her all too well. Mio\u2019s mentally weak.That\u2019s why he had kicked Gilbert\u2019s corpse to shake her up.The Swallow Sword is the technique she\u2019s most confident in. But if she wasn\u2019t an illusion and hadn\u2019t gotten distracted, she would never have used it against me.The Swallow Sword was dangerous for one reason: it drew the opponent\u2019s eyes downward, and the swallow would cut through them from the top.But it won\u2019t matter if the opponent already knows how it works. Seo Jun-ho dodged her sword with a single sidestep.\u201cAck\u2026!\u201d She hadn\u2019t expected him to dodge, and lost her center of balance for a split second. However, she was able to readjust her stance in the blink of an eye.But in a match between two experienced fighters, a moment\u2019s mistake can decide the outcome. Seo Jun-ho swung his sword downward. Like right now.He cut through Mio\u2019s body.\u201cYou\u2026 How could you\u2026?\u201dHe didn\u2019t have time to talk with Mio as she collapsed to the ground. Seo Jun-ho ignored her and dashed over to the Frost Queen.\u201cHurry, hurry! Hurry-hurry-hurry! Hurry up!\u201dShe was still elegant as she struggled in defense. She waved her hand, asking for help.\u201cGood job!\u201d As he reached her, the Golems shattered.Even though they were weakened versions, the two golems had survived for thirty seconds against Rahmadat and Skaya. It would have been impossible without a spirit at the Frost Queen\u2019s level. The Aura Buff ring had also helped immensely.\u201cI am ashamed. I had to use some powerful techniques to hold the woman at bay.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s why I felt dizzy.\u201d It seemed that the Frost Queen had handled Skaya herself.Seo Jun-ho raised his sword toward his two friends. Their eyes were murderous.\u201cI don\u2019t like that those glares are directed at me. Let\u2019s finish this up.\u201d\u201cGladly!\u201d\u201cW-Wait a second! You idiot!\u201dRahmadat charged at him like a boar, and Skaya let out a frustrated shout as she supported him.Even their illusions fight.Skaya, who always seemed to be deep in thought. Rahmadat, who made you wonder if he ever thought at all. They were always fighting about something stupid.But in battle, they make the best combination. A natural warrior and a natural magician\u2014they created a powerful synergy. There was only one way Seo Jun-ho could defeat them in their current state.I will also become a monster.Seo Jun-ho\u2019s magic circuits started to burn. He circulated his magic throughout his body as fast as he could, not slowing down. The Frost Queen sensed the powerful flow of magic.\u201cContractor! Will you not slow down?\u201d She cried.\u201cI can\u2019t think about that right now!\u201dAdjusting your speed and saving your stamina were all fine and good, but that meant you couldn\u2019t use your full power.I can\u2019t hold back if I\u2019m gonna take them down.He\u2019d been lucky when he was able to take down Gilbert and Mio. But once they fell, the remaining two had left no room for error.This was the most pivotal moment.He\u2019s coming.Reading Rahmadat\u2019s movements, Seo Jun-ho swung his sword.Slash! Black Dragon Fang made a long cut through Rahmadat\u2019s chest. Bright red blood spurted from his wound. It would have killed most people instantly, but he only seemed amused.\u201cThat feels refreshing!\u201dCrack! Seo Jun-ho crushed Rahmadat\u2019s fist in with his elbow. His hand sounded like it broke, but Rahmadat ignored it.\u201cAhahahaha! Dieee!\u201d\u201cYou bastard\u2026!\u201d Seo Jun-ho couldn\u2019t hold out against his strength and went flying back.Skaya\u2019s magic activated at that moment. Three magic circles appeared in the air, chain lightning crackling between them.Tsk. Even though she\u2019s an illusion, she can do triple casting.It would be hard for him to continue if he got hit. Seo Jun-ho quickly made a decision and used Shadow Step.\u201cThat won\u2019t work anymore!\u201dSeo Jun-ho reappeared a wide distance away, but new spells attacked him. He let out a shout as two fireballs hit him directly. He\u2019d barely managed to make ice armor in time; it alleviated some of the injury, but his skin sizzled from burns.\u2026Dammit, their reaction times are too fast. They were faster than any enemy he\u2019d faced in recent memory.Rahmadat chased him relentlessly as Skaya used her magic to distract him.Slice! He\u2019d already cut Rahmadat\u2019s chest fourteen times alone.But it\u2019s always shallow. That meant Rahmadat thought that it was too dangerous to let Seo Jun-ho attack a weak spot.\u201cHey, are you done already? I could go all day.\u201d He was as energetic as always.Seo Jun-ho sensed that it was time for him to make a choice. It was pointless to keep fighting like this, and it would only be disadvantageous for him if it dragged on.What shall I give him?He would offer his flesh so he could break his opponent\u2019s bones.(TN: A Korean idiom.)There were many options to choose from, but Seo Jun-ho chose the most efficient one.\u2026I\u2019ll give you my left arm.He didn\u2019t dodge Rahmadat\u2019s next punch and raised his left arm to block the strike.\u201cHuh? You\u2019re gonna block it with your flimsy arm?\u201dHe seemed surprised, but his fist didn\u2019t stop.Slam! His fist smashed through Seo Jun-ho\u2019s left arm.\u201cUrp\u2026\u201d Blood poured from his mouth. With no time to rest, Rahmadat landed another direct hit on his chest. He\u2019d layered a few sheets of ice on Black Armor, but the force of the punch made his insides churn.He\u2019s like a monster\u2026 But\u2026 Seo Jun-ho forced himself together and gripped Black Dragon Fang. I just need one hit. That\u2019s all.He used about half of his remaining magic, explosive darkness pouring from him. The shadows covered Black Dragon Fang.Law of Life\u2026!Even Rodomir hadn\u2019t been able to take it. The deadly technique started to aim for Rahmadat.\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten slower.\u201d But Rahmadat\u2019s fist was faster. It landed a hit on Seo Jun-ho\u2019s chin.\u201c\u2026!\u201d His vision started to spin, and his legs gave out.\u201cContractor!\u201d\u201cKuh\u2026!\u201dBut he did not fall. He looked like he would tip over any second, but his feet were planted firmly on the ground. The only thing keeping him up was his willpower.\u201c\u2026What the\u2014you can take it?\u201d Rahmadat looked genuinely surprised; he didn\u2019t think that Seo Jun-ho could withstand it. \u201cAs expected of Specter\u2026\u201dStab! Black Dragon Fang stabbed through his chest, interrupting him.\u201c\u2026Too bad. You missed my heart.\u201d His voice was apathetic. He\u2019d shifted his body in that instant to protect his heart. Rahmadat looked down at the sword piercing through his chest and grabbed Seo Jun-ho\u2019s head. \u201cGoodbye. I\u2019ll send you off painlessly.\u201d His fingers started to dig into his skull.\u201cKeuk, that\u2019s too bad\u2026 It\u2019ll be painful for you.\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you\u2026\u201d Rahmadat\u2019s face fell as he understood his words.The energy from Law of Life started to tear him apart from the inside.I used half of my magic for this one hit. If Rahmadat survived this, Seo Jun-ho would acknowledge his defeat.But of course, he wouldn\u2019t. No human could. The real Rahmadat had even praised the technique. His illusion wouldn\u2019t survive it.The darkness ripped through his body like a wild animal.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d He fell to one knee.\u201cRahmadat!\u201d Skaya yelled in shock.She waved her arms, and Seo Jun-ho was thrust upward as if he were being carried by a storm. He promptly fell back down.\u201cAck!\u201d Out of all the places, his rib had broken. Dammit, that\u2019s the same one from the Wild Forest\u2026Still, he stood up. His breath was shallow and cold sweat dripped down his face. He knew that he didn\u2019t have much time left. His stamina was draining quickly, and the Frost Queen had used a good amount of his mental power.He was at his limit after receiving a critical hit. It wouldn\u2019t be strange if he collapsed any second now.\u201cRahmadat! Wake up!\u201d No matter how Skaya tried to help him, Rahmadat was dead. The dark energy in his body was reaching its peak.It exploded out of his body, and blood rained down on the two people.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013Reaper ScansPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What\u2026 huh?\u201d Skaya\u2019s illusion stuttered. She was unable to process what had just happened. It was a good thing for Seo Jun-ho that she\u2019d suffered a mental blow.This is really the end. He let out a sharp breath and mustered the last of his strength. His legs were shaky, but they stood firm in supporting him. As he limped toward her, Skaya slowly raised her head.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Her eyes were red as blood poured from her eyes. \u201cI swear, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dAn immense amount of magic gathered into her hands. Even if he were at his peak condition, he wouldn\u2019t be able to block it easily. Seo Jun-ho knew perfectly well what it was.So the illusion can also use Destruction Ray.The magic compressed and condensed, forming something within her hands. It sparkled brilliantly, like the universe was in her hands. It looked beautiful, but it would completely destroy anything it touched.\u201cContractor. That energy\u2026 It seems considerably dangerous.\u201d The Frost Queen sounded worried. Seo Jun-ho nodded weakly.I came this far, but I still have to use this. He didn\u2019t want to, if possible. If he used it now, he\u2019d be bedridden for at least two days.\u201cHup!\u201d The magic in his body started to pour out. Unlike before, he didn\u2019t leave a single drop. His body started to ache.Fucking burnout. The exhaustion from using up all his magic started to set in. But he couldn\u2019t stop there. He continued to pull out his magic, creating a dark energy and condensing it. A weapon made of Darkness slowly formed in his hands.\u201c\u2026Deathside.\u201dIt was called the Death God\u2019s Scythe and was made by compressing Dark energy together. In other words, it was highly inefficient. But if he wanted to break through Skaya\u2019s eight mana shields and her Destruction Ray, he needed an energy that would \u2018ignore\u2019 and \u2018disdain\u2019. And Darkness was the only one that could do that.This is the best weapon I have right now. One hit was much stronger than Law of Life. Seo Jun-ho slowly raised the scythe.\u201cDie!\u201d Skaya released Destruction Ray, and Seo Jun-ho swung the scythe. A violent noise tore through the air as the two energies clashed.\u201c\u2026Haa, haa.\u201dThe last of his strength left him. Seo Jun-ho let go of Deathside, and it dissipated into black smoke. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re just an illusion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Skaya silently looked down at her chest. A large cut ran from her shoulder to her side. Blood started to pour out.If it were the real Skaya, I wouldn\u2019t be the one left standing.Deathside was the peak embodiment of the Darkness element and was a weapon that destroyed everything equally. The illusion\u2019s Destruction Ray had been extinguished because it had been weaker than Seo Jun-ho\u2019s technique. If the real Skaya had been the one to attack him, things would be vastly different.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Skaya slowly raised her head, sensing her own impending death. She smiled softly as blood poured from her eyes and mouth. \u201c\u2026Jun-ho, we\u2019ll be waiting.\u201dWith those words, all the illusions in the cavern disappeared. The blood and broken walls dissipated, returning to their original appearance.\u201cThose illusions were dirty to the end. To think that they\u2019d say that.\u201d\u201c\u2026They\u2019re smart, like their originals. They know what to say to make me feel like shit,\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered flatly. He knew that Skaya\u2019s words were the illusion\u2019s last attempt to make him despair, but it didn\u2019t stop his insides from churning. \u201cHaa\u2026 This is really fucking hard.\u201dThe Trial was over, but his current state wasn\u2019t good. His broken arm and rib had been part of the illusions, so they\u2019d returned to normal; the magic and stamina he\u2019d used, however, had been real.Seo Jun-ho stumbled and leaned against a wall to prevent himself from passing out.\u201cAre you okay? Go to the rest room right now\u2026!\u201d\u201cNot yet\u2026 The clear message hasn\u2019t appeared yet\u2026\u201dThankfully, it appeared right after he said that.[You have cleared the Phantom Trial.][If you wish to continue, please say \u2018Go\u2019. If you wish to stop, please say \u2018Stop\u2019.][The next level is the Insomnia Trial.]Of course, he chose \u2018Go\u2019. Seo Jun-ho quickly spoke.\u201cHey, Frost\u2026\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2026 sleep. So\u2026\u201d He waved his hand, as if asking for something, then collapsed where he stood. The Frost Queen huffed as she looked down at him.\u201cDoes he consider me to be his servant?\u201d He was such a shameless human. \u201cBut I suppose taking care of vassals is the duty of a monarch.\u201d She sighed.The Frost Queen rolled up her sleeves and pulled him to the bed, complaining the whole time.* * *\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho slowly opened his eyes like a patient waking from a deep sleep. His stomach rumbled loudly. Just how long was I asleep?He was so hungry that his stomach hurt. He immediately went to the refrigerator and started eating.\u201cPhew, I finally feel alive.\u201d He finished his meal and checked on the sleeping Frost Queen, then inspected himself.I really don\u2019t have any injuries. The violent battle had all happened in the space of an illusion, but his body was still stiff. His magic, stamina, and mental energy had all been drained.\u201cI\u2019m going to rest for today.\u201d The good thing about the Cave of Trials was that you didn\u2019t have to rush to finish it. If you were injured, you could stay comfortably in the rest room until you were healed. As he rolled back onto the bed, the Frost Queen slowly sat up from her pile of tissues and yawned quietly.\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d\u201cYeah. How long was I out?\u201d\u201cAround twenty hours.\u201d\u201c\u2026Damn.\u201d He\u2019d slept a lot. \u201cBut considering I used Deathside, that\u2019s not bad.\u201d\u201cThe scythe, you mean? It was as fierce as ever.\u201dHe\u2019d used Deathside against the Frost Queen too, but of course, she hadn\u2019t fallen as easily as Skaya\u2019s illusion.\u201cI thought I\u2019d be out for two whole days, so twenty hours is pretty good. My body doesn\u2019t feel that bad either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The Frost Queen silently floated over to him and poked his arms and chest with her finger.\u201cHey! Ow! Why are you doing that?\u201d He shouted. She sighed.\u201cWhy are you pretending to be okay when your body is in this state?\u201d\u201c\u2026If I rest for today, I\u2019ll be all better.\u201d He was confident because his stamina and magic recovered quickly.\u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn. Anyways, this Cave of Trials is quite fun in its own way.\u201d The Frost Queen took a seat at the edge of the bed. \u201cHow many Trials are left?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly. But most people think that it stops at level 10.\u201d\u201cLevel 10\u2026 So there are still seven Trials left that are as perverse as yesterday\u2019s?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded.Gray, the Administrator, said he\u2019d raise the difficulty of the Trials and change their contents a bit\u2026 But except for a few trivial things, the Trials weren\u2019t very different so far. It\u2019s driving me crazy. I\u2019d rather that the ball drop earlier than later. He was starting to worry because the Cave of Trials was progressing more easily than he expected.\u201cHow do you feel? You have not seen your comrades in a long time.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. They were just illusions.\u201d He suddenly remembered something. \u201c\u2026Well, I\u2019m a bit sad that I didn\u2019t get to meet my parents in the Trial,\u201d he muttered. They\u2019d shown up the first time he\u2019d done the Phantom Trial. It had been so long since he\u2019d seen them that he\u2019d cried.\u201cYour parents? Why would they appear in the Phantom Trial?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean why? They\u2019re both dead.\u201d The Frost Queen felt ashamed at his blunt response.\u201cHuh\u2026? Ah, I\u2026 I seemed to have made a mistake\u2026\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It was a long time ago.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s a good thing, I suppose.\u201d She pat Seo Jun-ho\u2019s shoulder with her small hand. \u201cI, too, lost my parents at a young age, so I can sympathize.\u201d\u201cReally? How old were you?\u201d\u201cSix.\u201d\u201c\u2026What? That\u2019s worse than me though.\u201d He was surprised. He looked at her with pity.\u201cThere is no need to look at me so. It has been a long time for me as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah. We\u2019re in the same boat.\u201d He seemed to find common ground with the Frost Queen in unexpected places. It made him frustrated at times, but sometimes it was also comforting.\u201cWhat is the next Trial?\u201d\u201c\u2026Insomnia.\u201d He got giddy just from thinking about it. \u201cYou have to stay awake for ten days without sleeping.\u201d\u201cWhat? Ten?! What a difficult Trial.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Trial that makes people go back.\u201d Staying up for a day or two was pretty easy. Even non-players could do that. But ten days\u2026 That\u2019s on a different level.You would have to stay awake for 240 hours, giving up the most important of the three basic human necessities.\u201cThe Guiness World Record for staying awake is eleven days straight.\u201d\u201cAh, they must have been a player with amazing willpower.\u201d\u201cActually, it was a normal person.\u201d Of course, the results of the reckless challenge hadn\u2019t been good. In an interview the next day, the challenger had a noticeably decreased memory retention and attention span and had confessed to hearing auditory hallucinations.(TN: This may be referring to Randy Gardner.)Since I\u2019m a player, I didn\u2019t have those kinds of setbacks last time. But that didn\u2019t mean that the Insomnia Trial was easy. It was the Trial that sent the most number of people back.\u201cI\u2019m going back to sleep.\u201d\u201cWait. Has it not been less than an hour since you awoke?\u201d\u201cI have to sleep a lot when I can.\u201d He had to be as sharp as he could before he stays up for ten days.* * *Seo Jun-ho slept for another thirteen hours. His eyes opened a few times, but he forced himself back asleep.\u201cWow, I feel great.\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes sparkled. How long had it been since he\u2019d taken a break and slept this well? He suddenly stopped, a peculiar look on his face. \u201cWait\u2026 Really, I think it\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve rested like this.\u201dHe\u2019d technically slept in the ice for 25 years, but his body had been so worn out that it didn\u2019t feel refreshing.\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve rested this well since the last time I challenged the Cave of Trials.\u201d In Gray\u2019s words, it had been 28 years and 7 months. Since then, he hadn\u2019t taken a single day off from hunting and slept a maximum of six hours a day.\u201cAre you ready?\u201d\u201cYes. Everything\u2019s perfect.\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded confidently. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHe stepped out of the door.\u201cI wish to continue to the 4th level.\u201d[Warning: Once the 4th Trial begins, you cannot sleep for 10 days.][Are you sure you wish to proceed?]Seo Jun-ho once again felt that the Gate was too kind to the players. \u201cBut if you\u2019re gonna be this nice, at least lower the difficulty a bit,\u201d he grumbled. He nodded.\u201cProceed.\u201d[Level 4: The Insomnia Trial will now begin.]A large hologram timer appeared on the cavern wall.[239:59:59]It counted the remaining time that Seo Jun-ho had to stay awake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he was bored, he\u2019d talk to the Frost Queen. Other than that, he spent time researching his ability.Of course, he didn\u2019t allow himself to move much. Burning calories would make him tired, and sleep would start to threaten him.\u201cLooks good.\u201d Seo Jun-ho suddenly stood up, and the Frost Queen looked up at him. He had created a pillar of ice in the middle of the cavern.\u201cWhat is that for?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gonna sit on it.\u201d He rolled his ankles and ran up to its side, hoisting himself onto the pillar. \u201cHup.\u201dThere was some space left over after he took a seat, but the surface was too small to lean or lay down.And it was around 22 meters high.Humans start to get scared of heights more than around 11 meters because any higher provokes their imagination.At 11 meters high or less, most people could see what was below them in detail. They could estimate how much it would hurt and where it would hurt most to land.But my sight is better than most people\u2019s. Even without enhancement, he could see clearly from 50 meters away. But if I fall while dozing off\u2026 Any higher than 22 meters is dangerous. He could survive a fall from that height.\u201cThis place is quite high, though the view from here is dreary.\u201d The Frost Queen had followed him up to the pillar, but she started to feel dizzy as she looked down to the ground. \u201cYes, this is quite effective in keeping you awake,\u201d she muttered. If he fell, he would be gravely injured. The idea whipped him awake.\u201cAre you not hungry?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine for now.\u201d His stomach growled as he said this, but he refused to eat. Hunger is a good way to keep yourself awake.When twenty hours passed, his stomach started to grumble louder, begging for food, but the pain only helped Seo Jun-ho concentrate better. The Frost Queen couldn\u2019t take it any longer.\u201cWould it not be better if you ate?\u201d She asked carefully.\u201c\u2026Just a bit, then.\u201d Seo Jun-ho reached into his inventory and ate one Shaolin pill, along with a single sip of water.\u201cIs that enough to fill your stomach?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t fill my stomach.\u201d Being full would make him sluggish. Seo Jun-ho would stick to all the strict rules he\u2019d set for himself.For now.* * *\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt had been 72 hours since he\u2019d slept, and Seo Jun-ho barely talked now. He\u2019d occasionally chatted with the Frost Queen before, but even that had stopped on the fourth day. She didn\u2019t try to talk to him much either because she understood the uphill battle he was fighting.\u201c\u2026If you\u2019re tired, you can sleep,\u201d Seo Jun-ho rasped quietly. The Frost Queen shook her head.\u201cI am a spirit. I do not have the same desires or needs as humans.\u201d\u201cMust be nice.\u201d He smiled as he said this, but his voice was envious.Tick, tick, tick. The hologram clock on the wall counted down by the second. Seo Jun-ho shut his eyes tightly when he saw that 188 hours remained.This is harder than last time. After all, the human body slowly deteriorated as it aged. Even players, who maintained their bodies in other ways, could not stop it. Things were different when he was 22.Seo Jun-ho yawned. \u201cWake me up.\u201d\u201cLook over here.\u201d The Frost Queen pointed her finger.Woosh! A soft, cold snowball hit Seo Jun-ho square in the face, and the sting woke him right up. He gave her a thumbs up.* * *Seo Jun-ho\u2019s shoulders hunched as he sat on the pillar. His stomach kept grumbling, and his complexion was sickly. His eyes were sunken, dark circles painted underneath them. He almost looked like a corpse.Dizzy. Seo Jun-ho rubbed his eyes hard. If he got distracted even a little bit, he would collapse. 125 hours had passed and 115 were left, but this was the most crucial part.\u2026Heavy. He felt like a boulder was occupying his head. I just want to sleep for ten minutes. No more, no less. He felt like he\u2019d fall asleep if he closed his eyes for three seconds.\u201cWe can\u2019t have that.\u201d He stood up from his seat with great effort and jumped off the pillar. He landed on the ground and stumbled over to the rest room.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe plush bed and full refrigerator tempted him greatly, but he gulped and headed to the bathroom instead. He took care of his business and looked up at the shower booth.If I take a hot shower and lay down on the bed\u2026 He would dream the sweetest dreams ever. As he raised his hand toward the shower faucet, the Frost Queen banged on the door.\u201cContractor! You\u2019re not sleeping in there, are you?\u201d\u201c\u2026Of course not.\u201d He suddenly realized what he was doing, then washed his hands and splashed his face with cold water. It was just a little bit, but he felt more awake now.* * *[215:59:59](PR: It\u2019s like this in raws, but idk why it says that much time when it\u2019s supposed to count the amount of time left and not the amount of time that\u2019s passed. Author???)Seo Jun-ho stared at the clock, his eyes unfocused.\u201cHold on for a little longer. There are only 24 hours left.\u201dHe nodded because he didn\u2019t have the energy to reply, but as time passed, he was starting to become more awake.I experienced it last time.It was often called \u2018a state of nirvana\u2019. Besides his heavy body and dim vision, he didn\u2019t feel very tired. His stomach had also quieted down at some point, and it felt like the whole world had fallen asleep. Within the heavy silence, Seo Jun-ho continued his battle.\u2026It\u2019s actually motivating. He smiled. While Korean men pledged to live a different life after coming back from their military service, players pledged to live a different life after they came back from the Cave of Trials. Those who cleared the Cave, especially those who cleared the Insomnia Trial, returned with a different mindset.Nothing is impossible\u2026 is what we say. The same had happened to Seo Jun-ho. He thought about the first time he\u2019d cleared the Cave of Trials up to the 9th level. I had nothing to be afraid of after that.He\u2019d felt unstoppable\u2014not just because of arrogance. He\u2019d been diligent even before he entered the Cave of Trials, but he became even more tenacious after he returned from it.It\u2019s the same this time as well. The Cave of Trials pressured the players to quit every step of the way, but it rewarded those who persevered.What were the rewards I got for clearing the 9th level\u2026? Because he hadn\u2019t slept, his mind had slowed. He kept forgetting what he wanted to remember.Oh, right. I got the \u2018Hero\u2019s Mind\u2019 skill\u2026It was an A-grade skill, but that wasn\u2019t all; his stats had all increased by 10.I\u2019ll reach at least the 9th level again. The rewards would be invaluable if he wanted to save his friends as fast as possible.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely\u2026 save you\u2026 It won\u2019t be long\u2026\u201d He sounded like he was possessed. A faint voice kept echoing in his ears.\u201c\u2026tor, Contra\u2026 Contractor!\u201dHis eyes shot open as if he was struck by lightning. Seo Jun-ho quickly looked around, worried. \u201cD-did I fall asleep?\u201d The Frost Queen let out a heavy sigh.\u201cNo. Look over there.\u201d He looked to where she was pointing.[00:00:00]He hadn\u2019t slept in ten days, but he\u2019d dreamed about those numbers countless times. Only then did he realize he\u2019d cleared the Trial.\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201d His husky voice sounded unfamiliar, but he laughed. \u201cI won.\u201d\u201cYes, you did.\u201d\u201cStaying up like that was no big deal.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, you are right.\u201d The Frost Queen spoke to him like she was humoring a child. \u201cCome down now.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Seo Jun-ho leapt down from the ice pillar. Normally, he\u2019d be able to do it easily, but he was too fatigued and huffed as he landed. \u201cPhew.\u201dA System message appeared.[You have cleared the Insomnia Trial.][If you wish to continue, please say \u2018Go\u2019. If you wish to stop, please say \u2018Stop\u2019.][The next level is the Taste Trial.]Seo Jun-ho squeezed his eyes shut when he read it. Things would only get harder from here on out.\u201cI didn\u2019t even get to eat yet.\u201d* * *After the Insomnia Trial, Seo Jun-ho slept for four days like a hibernating bear, but he finally recovered.\u201cI\u2019ve decided. Even if I regress or reincarnate, I\u2019m never coming to the Cave of Trials again.\u201d\u201c\u2026It must have been considerably difficult.\u201d\u201cIt drives people crazy. You try staying up for\u2026 Well, I guess you wouldn\u2019t understand since you\u2019re a spirit.\u201d He shrugged as he spread strawberry jam and butter onto warm bread.\u201cSo, what is the next Trial?\u201d\u201c\u2026Dammit, why did you bring that up while I\u2019m eating?\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face darkened as he chewed on his bread. He grabbed a memopad on the table and wrote something down. The Frost Queen hovered over it and tilted her head.\u201c\u2026Taste, scent, sound, silence, darkness, void?\u201d\u201cThe Sense Trials are waiting for me. That\u2019s what I call them.\u201dThe five human senses were sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. But the Cave of Trials doesn\u2019t have a Trial for the sense of touch.That was because it wouldn\u2019t be a Trial. The rest of them were akin to torture.\u201cThe Sense Trials stack too. That\u2019s the hardest part.\u201d\u201cThey stack? Then, will you have to experience all these Trials together in the final one?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll be deaf, blind, and unable to smell or taste\u2026 It\u2019s enough to ruin a person.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d She held her chin in her hands. \u201cCan you tell me about these things?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You can talk about the Trials inside the Cave, but not outside of it.\u201d They were still in the middle of the Trials. However, there would be no one to talk to if you didn\u2019t have a contracted spirit.\u201cIt must be hard. But what is the Taste Trial? Does it simply prevent you from tasting?\u201d\u201c\u2026If it were that simple, I wouldn\u2019t be this worried.\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked teary-eyed as he took a final bite of his toast as if it were his last meal. \u201cPhew, that was good.\u201dSeo Jun-ho finished his meal and pressed his hands together over his empty plate. He prayed that the fullness in his stomach would last for a long time.\u201cOnce the Taste Trial begins, you can\u2019t eat anything. If you do, it tastes like shit.\u201d \u2018Shit\u2019 was putting it lightly. You would taste all the disgusting things in the universe at once\u2014things that would hurt your dignity as a human.\u201cThen can you not simply starve?\u201d\u201c\u2026I told you. All the Trials from now on will stack.\u201d He wrinkled his nose and suddenly looked up as if he\u2019d realized something. \u201cOh, I looked disgusted just now, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cAnd what of it?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll see the real thing soon.\u201dThe Frost Queen felt a new pity for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You should go eat in the rest room now.\u201dHe shook his head. \u201cNo. I have to go right onto the next one.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026? Why must you go so far?\u201d\u201cThe food in the rest room will also taste like shit.\u201d He laughed weakly, looking pitiful with his tearful eyes. He turned away from the Frost Queen and started the Stench Trial.\u201cUrp! Bleegh!\u201d As it began, Seo Jun-ho covered his mouth. He\u2019d only breathed, but the cavern was filled with the stench reminiscent of rotting corpses. No matter how filthy something was, one should get used to the stench after some time, but the Cave of Trials did not adhere to such common sense. It continued to penetrate his nose.\u201cHaa, Haa\u2026\u201dHis complexion paled. Seo Jun-ho had already been starving for one day, and he couldn\u2019t even breathe properly. His body was quickly starting to deteriorate.But\u2026 I have to do this\u2026 He bit hard on his lip.He\u2019d already survived the Insomnia Trial, and he\u2019d already cleared this Trial once in the past. There was no reason he couldn\u2019t do it twice.\u2026But why is it so hard?Growwwlll. Seo Jun-ho passed the Stench Trial as he rolled on the ground in pain, but his body couldn\u2019t handle it. It was a different kind of pain from the Insomnia Trial; he\u2019d been able to eat and drink if he got too hungry then.\u201c\u2026Shouldn\u2019t you eat something?\u201d The Frost Queen asked carefully. She looked at him with pity.She was right. He had more muscles than the average person, and he absorbed more calories to maintain them. I haven\u2019t had a single drop of water in two days\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m going crazy.His nose was still filled with the rotten stench, but his survival came first.\u201cJust a bit, then\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho walked into the rest room and tore a tiny piece of bread. He pondered for a long time, then carefully put it into his mouth and swallowed without chewing.\u201cBleeghhh!\u201dAnd he threw it all up. Since he didn\u2019t eat anything, it was mostly gastric fluids. He felt like his own insides were coming up. When he finally stopped vomiting, his eyes were stained with tears.\u201cHuff, huff\u2026 This\u2026 This is worse than shit.\u201d He didn\u2019t even know how to describe it\u2014didn\u2019t even believe that such a revolting taste existed.But if I don\u2019t eat\u2026 He would die. No matter how strong of a player he was, if he didn\u2019t eat and drink, he would die.\u201cHey, Frost\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, what do you need?\u201d She asked carefully. She was scared to piss him off in his current state.\u201cIf you had to eat shit-flavored curry or curry-flavored shit, which would you rather eat?\u201d\u201cI would rather starve.\u201d\u201cStarving isn\u2019t an option. You have to choose one.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Frost Queen fell into a dilemma. She didn\u2019t know if she should prioritize her dignity or her nutrition.\u201cThen\u2026 What would you choose?\u201d\u201cThe curry-flavored shit. Every time.\u201d He spoke with tears in his eyes. He swallowed the bread, trying to swallow his pain and disgust.The tear-soaked bread tasted sickening.* * *Seo Jun-ho gulped down a bottle of water. The Frost Queen watched and wrote something down on the memopad.\u2013 Contractor\u2026 A-are you alright\u2026?\u2013 Yes. I\u2019m great. How was your day?There was no energy in his response. One might say that he was too far gone.\u2013 The stench is as bad as always\u2026 But I\u2019m starting to get used to the food.His eyes lit up like a wise old sage.\u2013 As long as I can swallow it down, it\u2019s still food. The taste isn\u2019t really important.\u2013 Contractor\u2026 You seem like you have given up your dignity.\u2013 It\u2019s alright. Things will return to normal once the Trials are over. I\u2019ve done this before.Seo Jun-ho held the pen weakly and let out a sigh. He was in the middle of the Stillness Trial.The Trials changed. In the past, the Sound and Silence Trials had come after the Stench Trial. You become deaf and mute.But this time, they had combined to become the Stillness Trial. Because he couldn\u2019t hear or speak, he was communicating with the Frost Queen on the memopad.Two Trials combined into one\u2026 His eyes darkened. Which means that one more Trial will be added at the end. It seemed that it was the \u2018change\u2019 that Gray had referred to. Every time Seo Jun-ho started a new Trial, he felt himself withering bit by bit. Ironically, he would then become more determined after he cleared the Cave of Trials.I\u2019ve come this far. I\u2019m gonna clear it no matter what. He grit his teeth. If he gave up, he didn\u2019t deserve to call himself hardworking.[You have cleared the Stillness Trial.][If you wish to continue, please say \u2018Go\u2019. If you wish to stop, please say \u2018Stop\u2019.][The next level is the Darkness Trial.]The Darkness Trial took away your vision. Seo Jun-ho quickly scribbled on the memopad.\u2013 Do you know what Morse code is?* * *\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t see.He couldn\u2019t hear.He couldn\u2019t speak.And all the while, a repulsive stench filled his nose.Tap tap, ta-ta-tap, taptap?It was smart of him to teach the Frost Queen Morse code. She picked it up quickly. She asked something along the lines of \u201cWill you eat?\u201dTaptaptap. Seo Jun-ho replied. This Trial would end in a few hours. I\u2019ve already slept a lot, so I\u2019m going right into the next one.If he remembered correctly, the next one was the \u2018Void\u2019 Trial. He swallowed.There\u2019s a reason why all the players have left the Cave of Trials after the 9th level.It was fear. The players lost their sense of sight, sound, smell, taste, as well as their speech. Their bodies and minds were weary at that point.Void. A state of empty nothingness. If you thought about it, the word didn\u2019t mean much, but his past self was shaken by the idea.I felt like my entire existence would be erased. And he still felt that way. Seo Jun-ho suddenly felt his hand start to tremble.Void\u2026 Humans were already powerless without their senses. But if one continued on to the Void Trial in that state\u2026 Players with a weak mind will probably be erased from existence.He wasn\u2019t just being paranoid. The System itself warned of this.It preys on the primal fear that we humans cannot escape. But\u2026 that\u2019s only the 9th Trial?Seo Jun-ho felt the cavern darken\u2014even though he couldn\u2019t see. The Administrator, Gray, had combined the Sound and Silence Trials into one, which meant that the Void Trial would be 9th; a new one would appear as the 10th. Seo Jun-ho started to wonder what the final one would be.[You have cleared the Darkness Trial.][If you wish to continue, please say \u2018Go\u2019. If you wish to stop, please say \u2018Stop\u2019.][The 9th Level: Void Trial and the 10th Level: Time Trial will happen concurrently.]\u2026What? Seo Jun-ho was shocked. He\u2019d expected the Void Trial, but he hadn\u2019t expected the 10th to happen at the same time.This is the first time this has happened. A Time Trial? A shiver went down his spine. The Void Trial was already dangerous, but another Trial on top of that?If\u2026 If I mess this up, it\u2019ll be a trouble.The System lit up again.[Warning! The Void Trial is not recommended for those with a weak mind and body, those who are elderly, and those who are pregnant.][Please cancel if you do not think you can handle the Trial. Your existence may disappear.]It was a brutal message. Most players who entered the Cave of Trials were below level 30, which meant that they had a lot to lose. The thing that they most feared was death. But the Trial did not simply end with death; it could erase your entire existence.My younger self would have run away at this point. Seo Jun-ho grinned. He thought that his past self, and all the others who gave up after the 9th Trial, were adorably naive.The Cave of Trials rewards you for how much you struggle. The Sense Trials were hard, but they didn\u2019t put your life at risk. But that\u2019s not the case for the Void Trial.High risk, high return. Seo Jun-ho sensed that there was something that could only be gained if he risked his life.And if it\u2019s concurrent with the Time Trial\u2026 He had an idea of what would happen. I\u2019ll probably be alone, unable to feel anything at all.He didn\u2019t know how long it would take. All he knew was that he would have to see it through to the end.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He pondered for a long while before tapping his finger on the ground. He sent a message to the Frost Queen.\u2013 I\u2019ll be back.She tapped on his shoulder.\u2013 Do not worry. I will keep waiting here.For some reason, that encouraged him. Seo Jun-ho smiled weakly and made his decision.I will continue.[Level 9: The Void Trial and Level 10: The Time Trial will now begin.]As it began, Seo Jun-ho started to feel like his consciousness was drifting away.\u2026Huh?He couldn\u2019t feel the Frost Queen\u2019s fingers on his shoulder. He tried to reach out his arm to find her, but he started to forget how to do that.Wait.It wasn\u2019t just his arms. As he realized that he could think, he was sure that his head was attached to his body but forgot how to move it. No, actually, he wasn\u2019t sure if his limbs were all attached to his body.\u2026I can\u2019t feel anything.If he could describe it with one phrase, it would be \u2018wandering mind\u2019. He could not see, hear, or feel his magic. In some ways, he was happy because the stench had finally disappeared.I have to get it together.He now understood why the System had given such a warning. He could not feel anything, and his fears started to creep in.\u2026I\u2019m alive, right? He pushed away those thoughts. His mind started to drift, floating without any sense or purpose.I am Seo Jun-ho.Seo Jun-ho repeated this firmly.He was Seo Jun-ho.He was Specter.He always won.He would win this Trial too.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere had been a time when he\u2019d thought that way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Addition! I was reviewing the basic arithmetic functions.Hahaha. He felt happy for the first time in a while and laughed. He had long forgotten how much time had passed in this space. After he stopped counting the time at a hundred days, he\u2019d started to have a meltdown.Had it been five months? Six? No\u2026 Had it been years?There was no way to measure time. He could only guess with such ridiculous methods.Perhaps he was dead already and was floating around in some sort of afterlife.I thought I\u2019d go to heaven when I died\u2026 I\u2019ve done a lot of good things.He laughed on the inside. He was sure he was laughing, but there were tears in his eyes. Of course, he couldn\u2019t actually cry, but he imagined himself sobbing.How did things get so bad?He\u2019d simply entered the Cave because he wanted to get stronger. Had he been too selfish?Was I not strong enough to handle this?He suddenly started to doubt himself. If he were able to go back in time, should he have run away?He thought for a long time.\u2026I don\u2019t want that, he decided. He would pursue power and clear this Trial, even if he had to risk his life.Where had that persistent mindset gone?I am Seo Jun-ho.He controlled the darkness and was the strongest man that stood over the 75 million people in his country.I am Specter.There was nothing he couldn\u2019t win against.If he wanted to give up, he would kill himself before he could think to do it.If you can\u2019t even do that, don\u2019t complain.Seo Jun-ho swore to himself that he would find a way out of this shitty place.Magic, gravity, the past, insomnia, starvation, scent, sound, sight.He had overcome all those Trials. And yet, the Cave of Trials was demanding more. The Void and Time Trials had even been combined into one.What do you want me to do? Am I supposed to become a god or something?He was only human, after all. He had been born as one.But\u2026With his effort, he could become something \u2018beyond human\u2019. Someone who could cut the sea with one hand couldn\u2019t be called a human, after all.Something beyond human. Seo Jun-ho thought that that was what the Cave of Trials wanted of its players. He would restore everything he\u2019d suffered and lost and surpass the limits.I feel like I\u2019ve become a cicada. Some species spent close to twenty years underground until they died. They had one chance in their twenty years to shed their skin\u2014for a breakaway. They could become a new creature and fly through the skies. Cicadas who missed their chance died thinking that the ground was the whole world.I won\u2019t die here.Seo Jun-ho strengthened his will. His reason started to return to him\u2014so did the feeling of emptiness. Even in this state of suspended eternity, his determination could not be destroyed.I am Seo Jun-ho. He would not fold.As he thought this, a layer of himself was shed.\u2026Ah.And his senses started to return to him.Magic.Magic that overflowed his body, air that filled his lungs. His ear twitched as a drop of water dripped from a stalactite on the ceiling.\u201c\u2026Phew.\u201d Seo Jun-ho let out a breath and slowly opened his eyes to see the familiar sight of the cavern. He felt a warm hand on his shoulder.\u201cWelcome back.\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded at the Frost Queen\u2019s voice.\u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cI stayed right here, as I promised.\u201d\u201cHow much time has passed?\u201d\u201cTen days.\u201d\u201cThis fucking Cave of Trials. It\u2019s messing with me.\u201dHe\u2019d counted several months, but it had only been ten days? Seo Jun-ho scoffed and stood up. The Frost Queen looked up at him.\u201cSomething has changed within you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not all that amazing. I\u2019ve only shed a single layer.\u201d Seo Jun-ho unsheathed Black Dragon Fang. The blade was silent, not making a single sound.I haven\u2019t eaten for ten days\u2026 But his body was in great condition, and he felt that all the magic within it was under his control.\u201cMy magic loss rate\u2026\u201d He muttered, grinning. After he\u2019d awoken from the ice, he\u2019d managed to lower his magic loss rate by 5%, but that had been the limit. He thought it would take some time to lower it to 3% from when he was Specter\u2026I didn\u2019t think that I\u2019d be able to master magic control like this.His magic loss rate was 0%. He wouldn\u2019t waste a single drop while using it. He was now equal to the Great Mage Skaya, who was blessed by magic.\u201cWait, that means\u2026\u201dHe injected his magic into Black Dragon Fang, creating a pitch-black energy; it burned as bright as a beacon. This was the final stage of swordplay that everyone aimed for\u2014a state that could only be reached if you had perfect control of magic.\u201c\u2026A sword aura.\u201d Seo Jun-ho swung the burning, black blade. The thick cave wall was cut through like tofu.\u201cI suppose there\u2019s no one left on the 1st floor who can beat me in swordplay.\u201dEven on the 2nd floor, there were tons of sword users who couldn\u2019t create a sword aura, let alone sword ki.\u201cThis looks stronger than the sword aura you used in the past,\u201d the Frost Queen said eagerly.\u201cIt probably is. I thought it was perfected back then, but it seems like it wasn\u2019t.\u201dSeo Jun-ho sheathed his sword and messages popped up before him.[You have cleared the Void Trial and the Time Trial.][Calculating Cave of Trials clear rewards.]\u2026\u2026Last time, the rewards had been calculated immediately, but it took much longer this time.\u201cIs it lagging?\u201d Seo Jun-ho hit the message box without thinking, and a new message appeared.[Do not fret. The rewards are still being calculated. -Administrator Gray.]\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes widened. The rewards are so good that the Administrator has to calculate them himself?He stood there silently, and System messages poured out.[Hero\u2019s Mind (A) has evolved to Hero\u2019s Mind (S).][You are now completely immune to all telepathic abilities below S-rank.][Keen Intuition (B) has evolved to Keen Intuition (A).][You have received the title \u27ecLimit Breaker\u27ed.][All stats have increased by 20.][Congratulations, genuinely. -Administrator Gray.]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho couldn\u2019t believe his eyes.My skill ranks increased? Two of them, at that?This was the first time this had happened to him\u2026 No, actually, he\u2019d never even heard of this happening to anyone else.It\u2019s a good thing Hero\u2019s Mind evolved. My mental power gets drained whenever the Frost Queen uses her powers. Now, she could use more powerful abilities more often. In short, she was the one that had gotten stronger.I didn\u2019t expect Keen Intuition to evolve either. Even at B-rank, the skill was incredibly useful. But now that it was A-rank, it was practically an intelligence skill.Not only that, I got 20 stat points. That\u2019s twice as much as last time.\u201cAh!\u201d He suddenly exclaimed.\u298a \u2018I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re honest or just childish\u2026\u2019He realized why Administrator Gray had said those words.\u201cThe Cave of Trials rewards its players based on how much they struggle.\u201d It was a given that he would receive more rewards than other players.So Gray has been watching me since then. Of course, Seo Jun-ho had simply spoken his honest thoughts at the time, but it had turned out for the better.\u201cAnd a title\u2026\u201d It was his third one now.\u27ecLimit Breaker\u27edRank: ADescription: A title given to those who broke through their limits in the Cave of Trials.Effect: Every time you level up, a random stat increases by 1.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d He was so shocked that his brain short-circuited. Seo Jun-ho read the effect over and over. \u201cI\u2019m not misreading this, right\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d The Frost Queen peeked over his shoulder and nodded as she read the description. \u201cI believe it simply means what it states.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201d He pinched his cheek just to make sure he wasn\u2019t dreaming. \u201c\u2026Ow.\u201d\u201cDo not worry. You are awake.\u201dOnly after the Frost Queen confirmed this did he start to feel excited.A random stat increases by 1 every time I level up? If others received 5 stat points when they leveled up, he would receive 6. And if it keeps accumulating\u2026 What if I reach level 130?He would have over 100 bonus stat points. If he reached level 230, it would be more than 200; if he reached level 330, it would be more than 300.\u201cAmazing\u2026\u201dThe luck he never had for the past 25 years was starting to come all at once.I was born in the wrong generation. Seo Jun-ho nodded quietly and turned around. At some point, a Gate had been created in the middle of the cavern.\u201cLet us go. I am weary of these cavern walls.\u201d\u201cSame here. I think I\u2019m gonna go crazy if I stay here any longer,\u201d he muttered, turning to her.* * *\u201cMm.\u201d Jampa was watching the Gate today as well. It has already been a month, but it seems that he has no thoughts of coming out.It was the first time this had happened. Even if someone reached the 9th level, it only took them around two weeks.Perhaps\u2026 Jampa shook his head, trying to get rid of his darker thoughts. He wasn\u2019t stupid, so he knew that it would be a big scandal if Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t emerge. It would be the first time that such a world-famous rookie would disappear in the Cave.\u201cPhew\u2026 My mind is unsteady.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s cold underground. Please go back up, Jampa-nim,\u201d his subordinate said. He sighed and started up the stairs.Beep\u2014 Beep\u2014 Beep\u2014A sound started to go off behind him.\u201cWhat is that sound?\u201d\u201cThe ranking list! The ranking list is being updated!\u201dJampa hurried back to see it. \u201cDid he finally clear the 9th level?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. I didn\u2019t know that he was on the same level as the Nine Heavens\u2026\u201d\u201cHaa, I disagree. He\u2019s not quite up to their standards.\u201d Jampa thought about the situation from an objective standpoint. \u201cKim Woo-joong and the others only took two weeks to reach the 9th level.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026! I didn\u2019t think about that.\u201dSeo Jun-ho had taken longer than them, which meant that he was inferior in some way. Still, Jampa clapped. \u201cEven with that, he has achieved something amazing. Korea has produced yet another outstanding player.\u201d\u201cYes, indeed\u2026 Huh?\u201d A strange look filled their eyes. And as if it were contagious, Jampa\u2019s eyes also widened.The ranking list had changed, but Seo Jun-ho\u2019s name wasn\u2019t simply added.[Cave of Trials Rankings]2. Specter \u2013 9th level2. Rahmadat Khali \u2013 9th level2. Tenmei Mio \u2013 9th level\u2026\u20262. Wi Cheon-hak \u2013 9th level2. Shin Sung-hyun \u2013 9th level2. Kim Woo-joong \u2013 9th level\u2026\u2026After thirty years, the Cave of Trials rankings finally shifted. All the names went down by one.\u201cIs it possible\u2026?\u201d\u201cN-no way\u2026 It can\u2019t be.\u201dThey couldn\u2019t fathom what was happening before them and shook their heads.A new name appeared above Specter.[Cave of Trials Rankings]1.

He tilted his head. The caretaker, Jampa, was looking at him as if he were a ghost.\u201cHave you been well?\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah, y-yes.\u201d He responded belatedly and nodded eagerly. \u201cI have been as well as always\u2026\u201d He shut his mouth, swallowing his question. He wanted to ask if Seo Jun-ho had really cleared the 10th floor\u2014if it wasn\u2019t some sort of mistake\u2014but he didn\u2019t think it appropriate to ask the traveler who\u2019d suffered inside the Cave for an entire month.Instead, he brought his hands together and congratulated him. \u201cI hope you found what you sought in the Cave of Trials.\u201d\u201cIt was very generous.\u201d He grinned and turned to the ranking list.Seo Jun-ho \u2013 10th level Specter \u2013 9th levelTo others, it was an incredible feat, but to him, it was more than that. He\u2019d broken his own personal record.\u201cI will escort you to your room if you wish to rest.\u201d\u201cAlright. But before that.\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked at the subordinate standing behind Jampa. \u201cCan I buy those sunglasses on your shirt?\u201d\u201cHuh? This? If you need it, you can just have it. It\u2019s really cheap\u2026\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Seo Jun-ho received the sunglasses and gave a satisfied look. \u201cI\u2019ll need them soon, you see.\u201d* * *A massive amount of reporters and cameramen were waiting in front of Incheon Airport\u2019s gate.\u201cIs this the correct gate?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201dThey were all crowded behind the gate to catch a glimpse of Seo Jun-ho.\u201cPeople really are unpredictable.\u201d\u201cYeah. A month ago, he was only a world-famous rookie\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s incredible in itself, but he\u2019s on a completely different level now.\u201d\u2018Only\u2019 a world-famous rookie. He was one of many who seemed to have a bright future ahead of him. But after this incident, the whole world was watching him.\u201cThis is the first time Specter\u2019s record has been broken, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. Not only that, but the record stood for thirty years before Seo Jun-ho broke it.\u201d\u201cNone of Specter\u2019s other records have been broken yet?\u201dThis was the first time the legendary player\u2019s official record was broken.\u201cMost of the players on the 2nd floor have higher levels and higher stats than Specter\u2026 But that doesn\u2019t mean they can break his records.\u201dAnyone could reach a high level as long as they had time and some amount of talent, so the Cave of Trials\u2019 ranking list served as a symbol of Specter\u2019s power. It had been his first official record; no one had broken it in the 25 years after he \u2018died\u2019.\u201cDamn, who knew that it would be another Korean.\u201d\u201cI swear, it\u2019s a conspiracy or something.\u201d\u201cWhen Specter returns, I want to ask him what he thinks about this.\u201d\u201cOoh, that would be fun.\u201dA legend of the past vs a new star. This kind of topic was always popular with the masses.\u201cHey, he\u2019s coming!\u201d\u201cTake a picture!\u201dThe reporters started to scramble. Seo Jun-ho emerged from the gate, escorted by Association employees.Click! Click!With his shabby sunglasses, Seo Jun-ho scanned the gate and smiled.Man, this reminds me of the old days. Wherever he went, he\u2019d be greeted by fans, cameras, and reporters. Most players got tired of all the attention, but that wasn\u2019t the case for him.\u201cHm, there\u2019s less than I expected\u2026\u201d\u201cStop trying to act cool! We have to go!\u201d Cha Si-eun said wearily, trying to guide him. The Association had sent a fair number of employees, but they weren\u2019t nearly enough to handle the crowd.I didn\u2019t think that there would be so many people\u2026 What if something happens\u2026? She felt dizzy thinking about all the things that could go wrong. Meanwhile, Seo Jun-ho himself looked relaxed. He didn\u2019t look the least bit scared of the mob\u2014he even waved to them from time to time.\u201cThis way, please!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s slow down a bit. You\u2019re gonna hurt yourself if you trip.\u201dHe was too relaxed.Seo Jun-ho nodded to himself, feeling satisfied. Yes, this is the treatment I should be receiving.He\u2019d been too comfortable until now. Earning the title of a \u2018Super Rookie\u2019 was no easy feat, but it wasn\u2019t enough to rile up the people like this. But once they heard that he\u2019d beat Specter, everything had changed. Close to a thousand people were following him around in the airport. That means my name still holds that much weight.I\u2019m gonna live more freely this time. He didn\u2019t need to become a symbol of hope and strength again. Thinking of that made him happy.\u201cSecretary Cha, they\u2019ve waited so long to meet me. Can\u2019t I just have a short autograph session?\u201d\u201cNow\u2019s not the time to be saying that!\u201d She cried.* * *\u201cAww, my little lucky charm~\u201dAs soon as he entered the office, Shim Deok-gu ran over to him with a creepy expression on his face.\u201cFuck off before I hit you.\u201d\u201cC-contractor. That human\u2019s eyes are so disturbing.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201dShim Deok-gu\u2019s eyes were filled with affection, but he stopped in his tracks. \u201cGeez, is it so weird that I want to hug my friend?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re acting super creepy. What happened?\u201d Seo Jun-ho asked, taking a seat on the sofa.\u201cHehe, you\u2019ll understand why I\u2019m acting like this when you see this.\u201d Deok-gu tapped on his Vita. A list appeared before them, and Seo Jun-ho blinked.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cA list of donations.\u201d There were hundreds of pages of huge donations. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trickling in for a few months, but they started flooding in two days ago.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhy do you think?\u201dSeo Jun-ho met his eyes and pointed at himself. \u201cBecause of me?\u201d\u201cOf course. You\u2019re the only reason they\u2019ve been making these donations. They want to make a connection.\u201d\u201c\u2026But why? There are tons of good players on the 2nd floor.\u201d He looked confused. Even if he broke Specter\u2019s record, he was still a level 30 newbie.\u201cFrom their perspective, you\u2019re a completely different commodity. The players on the 2nd floor have already gotten all their certificates and awards, and they can\u2019t just wriggle in. You, on the other hand, are brand-new and unlisted.\u201d\u201c\u2026Am I a stock or something?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a metaphor. Anyways, if they make a connection to you now, they\u2019ll be able to ask you for favors when you go even higher.\u201d\u201cAhh, so they\u2019re trying to buy my favor,\u201d he said flatly. Basically, they were saying something like, \u2018I\u2019ll give you a lot of money, so please remember me! Hehe.\u2019\u201cYes, exactly.\u201d\u201cHow much have you received in total?\u201dShim Deok-gu shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t even know the exact amount.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why not?\u201d\u201cHow would I? I get new donations every time I refresh the page.\u201d He smiled happily and refreshed the window. \u201cLet\u2019s see, two seconds ago, it was 454,070,473 USD\u2026 Oh, the smaller numbers keep changing so I can\u2019t count it.\u201d(TN: For easier reading, I\u2019ll be converting currency directly.)\u201cWow, a lot of people want to be my friend.\u201d\u201cOf course. If you start using social media, you\u2019ll probably get 5 million followers in a day. Do you want to try YouTube? \u2018Seo Jun-ho\u2019s Survival Guide\u2019 or something.\u201d\u201cNah, it\u2019s too much work.\u201d Seo Jun-ho shrugged and laid down on the sofa. He looked at the Frost Queen.\u201c\u2026Why do you have such a pathetic expression?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you see? I\u2019m too important.\u201d\u201cHah? Listen closely. I am the monarch\u2026\u201d\u201cSo what\u2019re you gonna do with the money?\u201d Seo Jun-ho asked, ignoring the Frost Queen\u2019s ramblings.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Do you remember the stipulations of the contract?\u201d\u201cYeah. All donations are gonna be split 7 to 3.\u201d\u201cYeah, 70% of all this is yours. Of course, the taxes will be high.\u201d\u201cWhat a waste\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho sighed. \u201cI used to be exempt from taxes.\u201dIn the past, the government had exempted him from taxes, begging him not to go to another country. Of course, that wasn\u2019t the case anymore.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho thought for a second, then pointed his finger. \u201cI got it. I\u2019ll invest the money into the Association.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you saying?\u201d Shim Deok-gu tilted his head.\u201cI said I\u2019ll invest it into the Association. Recruit some people with the money.\u201d\u201cWhat people? Employees?\u201d\u201cNo, players. Players who can work on the 2nd floor. Make them your agents.\u201d\u201cHey, do you know how expensive they are? It would be better to train players on the 1st floor\u2026\u201d\u201cUntil when? If you keep this up, the Big 6 and the other guilds are gonna control the 2nd floor forever.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Shim Deok-gu had nothing to say. He scratched his head. \u201cBut do you think that can really change with just one Association\u2026?\u201d\u201cOf course. You\u2019d be stupid not to try, at least.\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s voice was full of confidence. \u201cAfter all, the Korean Player Association has two things no other country has.\u201d\u201cTwo\u2026? I know one of them is you, but what\u2019s the other one?\u201dSeo Jun-ho grinned. \u201cWhat do you think? It\u2019s Specter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d Shim Deok-gu\u2019s eyes widened. His face became serious. \u201cYou want Specter to enter the Association?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019ll just be a simple working relationship. But that in itself will be enough.\u201d\u201cOf course\u2026 It\u2019s more than just \u2018enough\u2019.\u201d Specter was practically a religious figure. The reason that the people were still living was because of him and the rest of the Five Heroes.\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten hundreds of millions in donations with just your name.\u201dThen how much would they earn with Specter? And what if they could use the money to expand the Association to the 2nd floor?\u201cFor now, keep \u2018em coming.\u201d Seo Jun-ho crossed his legs and laughed. \u201cThe donations, I mean.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seo Jun-ho sensed what he was about to say.\u201cThe orphanage?\u201dDeok-gu nodded gravely. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the exact location, but we found a lead.\u201d\u201cThat was faster than I thought.\u201d\u201cWe were just lucky. We happened to find something while investigating a bunch of different places.\u201d\u201cAn orphanage? Is that a code word?\u201d The Frost Queen asked. She was playing with a large column.\u201cNo, we\u2019re talking about a literal orphanage.\u201d Seo Jun-ho explained to her how the Fiend Association was using orphanages to train fiends. She banged on the column in anger.\u201cThose wicked, impudent humans!\u201d\u201cHey, that column\u2019s expensive\u2026\u201d Deok-gu looked like he was about to cry, but she was already on a roll.\u201cLead the way. I will punish those filth.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hear about that lead first.\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked at Deok-gu expectantly, who then tapped on his Vita. A photograph of a man showed up. He was a foreigner with a kind face who looked like he was in his 30s.\u201cTorres Milo. A level 72 player who was active on the 2nd floor. Abilities unknown. He announced his sudden retirement while his career was peaking.\u201d\u201cNothing suspicious so far.\u201d It wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary for players to retire even when they were doing well. Sometimes, players had a sudden change of heart or became scared for their future.\u201cLook at the next picture.\u201dBeep\u2014It was an image of Torres walking in front of the Colosseum with two children walking behind him.\u201cAn agent who was investigating Rome just so happened to take this picture.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, Torres never married. But there were kids with him, so I did some digging\u2026\u201d His face darkened. \u201cAnd it turns out that his activities since his retirement are completely unknown. Even if he tried to erase his records, there\u2019s no way it would be so clean.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a little suspicious.\u201d\u201cRight? Something felt off, so I went even deeper.\u201d He pulled out a few documents; they were a compilation of reports from Rome. \u201cI think he\u2019s been living around Rome for a few years now, but no one knows where he lives or what he does. It seems that he sometimes goes out in public with children, but the important thing is that they\u2019re never the same.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHe\u2019s getting more suspicious the more you tell me about him. But if he\u2019s really the fiend who runs the orphanage, why is he acting so openly?\u201d\u201cI wondered the same thing, so I went through crime records from the past few years.\u201dBeep\u2014 The two men and the spirit stared up at the hologram report.\u201cAlmost every time he went out in public, there was a missing persons report within a week.\u201d\u201c\u2026Of course.\u201d Seo Jun-ho instantly realized what that meant. \u201cSo he goes out to check for himself if the children are worth using?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I think. Of course, it could be something else.\u201d Deok-gu didn\u2019t sound confident, but Seo Jun-ho was sure of it. Keen Intuition was now A-rank, and it was screaming at him right now.\u201cHow often does he go out?\u201d\u201cOnce every two months. He should be going out again next week.\u201d\u201cGood. I\u2019ll go.\u201dDeok-gu looked at him, worried. He wanted to tell him off, but he couldn\u2019t quite do it.\u201cI know you\u2019re strong. Hell, you know better than anyone how strong you are. But it\u2019s really dangerous this time.\u201d They didn\u2019t know how many fiends worked at the orphanage. Besides, the place was overflowing with fiends in training.\u201cI don\u2019t expect it to be easy,\u201d Seo Jun-ho said calmly. \u201cBut you know how hard I\u2019ve worked to get rid of them. So when they were wiped out, I didn\u2019t think they would appear again.\u201dBut things didn\u2019t always work out the way you wanted them to. After the Five Heroes had \u2018died\u2019, the fiends had started to crawl out of the shadows.\u201cI can\u2019t forgive the fiends. I don\u2019t want to forgive them. You know why, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Shim Deok-gu pursed his lips. He had nothing to say.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for them, my parents wouldn\u2019t have been killed by monsters.\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes were cold. Deok-gu raised his hands in surrender.\u201c\u2026Tsk. It\u2019s unfair of you to bring up your parents.\u201d\u201cEither way, I won\u2019t let them slip away.\u201d\u201cWhat, so you don\u2019t need any extra manpower? You\u2019re gonna take care of everything alone with the Frost Queen?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Frost Queen-nim.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re gonna take care of everything alone with Frost Queen-nim?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just an investigation. If he\u2019s not a fiend, I\u2019ll come back quietly.\u201d\u201cAnd if he is?\u201d\u201cWell, things will get noisy, then,\u201d he said coolly. He seemed to consider something. \u201cAlso, do you know if some sort of technology has been developed that can turn fiends back to normal?\u201d\u201c\u2026There isn\u2019t.\u201d Deok-gu knew why he was asking. He laughed bitterly and patted Seo Jun-ho on the shoulder, as if to brush away some of the heavy burdens his friend was carrying.* * *Rome was divided up into 15 administrative districts called municipios. Most people gathered in municipio 1, where the Colosseum was. On the other hand, municipio 15 was mostly empty because of one large private property.\u201cIt really has been a long time.\u201d A man with a dusty hood looked up at the gates. It was the middle of the day, so he could see clearly into the property. Dozens of children were laughing and playing.Creak. The gate opened, and a priest stepped out. He smiled at the man.\u201cWelcome, brother. What brings you\u2014Keuk!\u201dThe man took off his hood and grabbed his throat. \u201cCall the director.\u201d The Demonic energy that emanated from his body made the priest tremble in fear.\u201cA-a fiend\u2026 I-I apologize, I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d a new voice said. A kind-looking man walked toward them, his hands clasped behind his back. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the Demon Bow to come to such a humble place. If you had informed me ahead of time, we could\u2019ve avoided making such a mistake.\u201dDemon Bow Kal Signer.\u201cAm I not allowed to come here?\u201d\u201cOf course not. You are welcome at any time.\u201dKal Signer glanced at the children. \u201cLife must be pretty boring here.\u201d\u201cHaha. We\u2019re not here to have fun, after all. I am working day and night for the sake of the Demon King\u2019s return.\u201d\u201cThe Demon King\u2026 Are you sure you can talk about him in front of the children?\u201d He was conscious of their vicinity.\u201cOf course. If you don\u2019t believe me\u2026\u201dTorres clapped his hands. Suddenly, the children all stopped. The child on the slide, the child in the sandbox, the children playing tag; their smiles fell from their faces, and they stared at Kal Signer, expressionless.\u201c\u2026Disgusting little things.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re all training hard so they can become like you.\u201d Torres clapped again, and the children went back to \u2018playing\u2019. \u201cCome on in.\u201dThe large building was reminiscent of a college dormitory. Torres led him to his office and started to make coffee.\u201cSo\u2026 what brings you here? I haven\u2019t received any other orders.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not here on Association business. I came here to carry out Nazad Hallow\u2019s orders.\u201dThe director\u2019s eyes widened when he heard the name. He seemed nervous. \u201cH-have I done something wrong\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou must feel guilty about something,\u201d Kal Signer snorted and put his legs up on the coffee table. \u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with you. He ordered me to bring up some no-name to the 2nd floor.\u201d It would take some time for him to succeed because Seo Jun-ho had to reach level 30 first.\u201cJust who\u2026\u201d\u201cNo one important. Do you know someone called Seo Jun-ho?\u201d Signer expected him to say no, but Torres nodded immediately.\u201cOf course I do. He\u2019s the hottest topic on the 1st floor right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026What? You know him?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you talking about the Korean player? He reached 1st place in the Cave of Trials.\u201d\u201cWait, 1st place?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d Signer frowned. It had been hard coming down to the 1st floor while avoiding the Associations; he\u2019d barely made it with the Pathfinder. He hadn\u2019t had any time to check the news.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like the only one who\u2019s 1st place.\u201dKal Signer had never been to the Cave of Trials before. Most fiends couldn\u2019t even get close to it because it was maintained by the Player Association, but he thought he\u2019d be able to reach the 9th level if he tried.\u201cHuh? He\u2019s the only one.\u201d\u201cWhat? How is that possible?\u201d He pulled his feet off the table. He didn\u2019t understand.\u201cHe cleared the 10th level and set the record for 1st place.\u201d\u201c\u2026He beat Specter, Rahmadat Khali, and Kim Woo-joong?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 hahaha!\u201d He let out an amused laugh. \u201cHasn\u2019t it only been four months since he debuted?\u201d\u201cThat would be correct.\u201d\u201cTsk, he got lucky again.\u201d Signer was greatly underestimating him. He\u2019d been watching Seo Jun-ho for a while, and he thought that his luck had extended to the Cave of Trials.It was exactly what Seo Jun-ho wanted.He\u2019s a weakling. The Shadow Brothers could\u2019ve easily taken care of him. Signer just thought that he was extremely lucky\u2014that it was how Seo Jun-ho had avoided the Shadow Brothers and the Las Vegas incident.I wrote in my report that Seo Jun-ho was deeply connected to the Watchdogs\u2019 deaths\u2026 but I don\u2019t believe it myself. It was the Dokkaebi Guild\u2019s Gong Juha. Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t do anything.He hadn\u2019t even been level 20 back then. How could he have taken down the whole team?\u201cSigner-nim, are you expecting to stay here for a while?\u201d\u201cDo you have any complaints?\u201d\u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d\u201cI am indebted to you. That monster is wearing me down.\u201d The orphanage was the only place on the 1st floor where he could hide. \u201cThis place will be safe.\u201d\u201cWell, make yourself comfortable. However\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to say it. You\u2019re the director here. I won\u2019t impede on your authority.\u201d\u201cThank you for understanding.\u201d Torres was relieved that the Demon Bow wasn\u2019t here for him.To think that Nazad Hallow wants Seo Jun-ho\u2026 How unexpected.Of course, his thoughts on the matter ended there; it didn\u2019t have anything to do with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A moment later, the energy shaped into a man.\u201cWe\u2019re here. This is Rome.\u201d The speaker was a teleporter from the Korean Player Association. He glanced over his shoulder, tilting his head. President Shim Deok-gu had given him a personal order, so he\u2019d been nervous, but his task was too easy.Who is he? It was hard to discern the identity of the man he\u2019d escorted because he was wearing a baseball cap, a mask, and sunglasses. But if he was on a secret mission, that meant the player had a high level.\u201cI\u2019ve fulfilled my task. I hope things go well for you.\u201dThe man nodded.\u201cI have other assignments, so, goodbye\u2026\u201d The teleporter checked the time and disappeared in the alleyway. The player looked around.\u201cSo this is Rome,\u201d muttered Seo Jun-ho.\u201cThis city is home to the spirits of many valiant warriors,\u201d the Frost Queen said.\u201cYou can tell?\u201d\u201cTo some extent, yes.\u201dThe two of them emerged from the alley. They stepped out into a simple sidewalk, but they were surrounded by tourists.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the place Torres goes to.\u201dSeo Jun-ho waited for a few hours at the square with a fountain, sitting on a bench. Of course, Torres never came.\u201cDo not be disheartened. You cannot expect to be full after your first bite.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not disappointed. He\u2019s supposed to come next week, so there\u2019s no reason I\u2019d see him today.\u201d For now, he had familiarized himself with the area. \u201cLet\u2019s look for a place to stay.\u201dSeo Jun-ho stood up. At that moment, he felt something brush against his left wrist.A pickpocket? He grabbed the pickpocket\u2019s arm.\u201cHey! Let me go!\u201d The boy looked around 15; his shirt and jeans were worn and ripped. He glared at Seo Jun-ho. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you?\u201d\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Tourists started to stare at them.\u201cIf you don\u2019t let me go right this instant, I\u2019m gonna say you\u2019re kidnapping me.\u201d\u201cDo you think they\u2019d believe you? Hand it over.\u201d Seo Jun-ho snatched his Vita from the boy\u2019s hand.\u201cGeez, it was a pickpocket?\u201d\u201cTsk, tsk\u2026 Look at that. It\u2019s not very safe here.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s got slippery fingers. How did he steal a Vita?\u201d\u201cYou be careful too. They\u2019ll steal your nose if you\u2019re not careful.\u201dIt was a common sight, so the people quickly lost interest. The boy spat on the ground in frustration.\u201cYou\u2019re rude. You seemed like a pushover\u2026\u201d\u201cOh my. He has quite the eye for people.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho glanced at the Frost Queen and then back at the boy.\u201cWhat\u2019re you looking at? Why, do you want an apology or something?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m wondering if I should report you to the police.\u201dThe boy glared at him, biting his lower lip.Is he scared? Seo Jun-ho tilted his head. He shouldn\u2019t be reacting like that. He\u2019d probably just get a slap on the wrist and a scolding from his parents.Seo Jun-ho examined him again and nodded slowly. He\u2019s part of a family.(TN: Not a literal family, obviously. It just uses the English word.)It was common for runaways in Italy and other parts of Europe to pickpocket as a group. They knew their cities inside out.Not a bad start. Seo Jun-ho smiled at his guide.* * *Seo Jun-ho sipped on his coffee. In front of him, the boy was chomping down food like a starved animal.\u201cSlow down. Your stomach\u2019s gonna hurt.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He was still looking at Seo Jun-ho warily, but he slowed down. He finished his fifth plate and started to examine him.\u201cWhat? Do you want more?\u201d\u201cAh, no. I\u2019m full.\u201d As he spoke, he pocketed the bread one by one. \u201cI have siblings at home\u2026 I suddenly remembered them \u2018cause I\u2019m full.\u201dSeo Jun-ho shrugged. \u201cYou know I have no obligation to them, right?\u201d\u201cO-of course. I have some shame.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d He raised his hand for a waiter.\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Seo Jun-ho turned back to the boy.\u201cHow many of them?\u201d\u201cF-fifteen. Sixteen, including my older brother.\u201d\u201cSixteen spaghettis and butter garlic breads. To-go, please.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAs the waiter walked away, the pickpocket boy bowed his head.\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201d\u201cLook at this. Aren\u2019t you quite the pushover?\u201d Seo Jun-ho pushed the Frost Queen with his finger.\u201cDo you have a house or parents?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re part of a family, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d Perhaps it was because it was the first time in a while since anyone had shown him kindness, but the boy answered all his questions. \u201cWe\u2019re called the Marco family. The hyungs take care of the others, and we live in a barn.\u201d\u201cAre you and your younger siblings blood-related?\u201d\u201cNo, we all met as runaways, but we\u2019re like a real family.\u201dNot bad. They would know a lot about Rome.\u201cWhat do you think about being my local guide? I\u2019ll pay you in food.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019ll do it! I\u2019ve memorized every street and alley in Rome. I promise.\u201d The boy nodded vigorously at the thought of warm, delicious food.\u201cGreat. But first, I need to see if you\u2019re good enough.\u201d\u201cAsk whatever you want,\u201d he said confidently.\u201cI have a younger brother who I lost a long time ago. I heard that he was in an orphanage in Rome.\u201d\u201cOh, an orphanage\u2026\u201d He listed off several orphanages, smiling brightly. But it wasn\u2019t what Seo Jun-ho was looking for.If I simply wanted to know what orphanages are in Rome, I could just search it up online. Deok-gu had already looked there.\u201cI\u2019ve been to all of them. Isn\u2019t there anywhere else?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Those are all the orphanages around here\u2026\u201d The boy wracked his brain, trying to think of something else. \u201cOh! Maybe he\u2019s in Paradise.\u201d\u201c\u2026Paradise?\u201d Seo Jun-ho tilted his head at the strange word.\u201cYes. I\u2019ve never been there myself. I\u2019ve only heard the hyungs talk about it, but I know it exists.\u201d\u201cWhat do they do there?\u201d\u201cUm, well, there are a lot of pickpockets like us in Rome. I think there are about six families.\u201d The boy launched into his story, using his hands. \u201cEvery month, priests go to every family. They tell us they\u2019ll make us clean of sin and take one person to Paradise.\u201d\u201cPriests?\u201d\u201cYeah. I think they\u2019re from the Vatican.\u201dVatican City was in Rome, so it was a common sight to see people in priest robes. So they wouldn\u2019t seem suspicious.Things were getting interesting. Seo Jun-ho asked another question, \u201cWhat\u2019s good about Paradise?\u201d\u201cI heard that you can go to school there; wear clean clothes and eat three meals a day.\u201d\u201cHow do they pick the kids that go to Paradise?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. They just choose on the spot.\u201d He paused, then muttered quietly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go to Paradise.\u201d\u201cWhy not? It sounds like a great place.\u201d\u201c\u2026The priests are a little scary.\u201d The boy shivered. \u201cThey look very kind, but\u2026 something about them makes me uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cFor no reason?\u201dSeo Jun-ho remembered something. Demonic energy brings out all the fear in people. If those priests were fiends with Demonic energy, it made sense that the boy felt that way\u2014especially because he had sharp instincts. He couldn\u2019t lose him.Seo Jun-ho called the waiter again. \u201cI would like some pizza to-go. Eight of them.\u201d* * *\u201cIs that where your family lives?\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked at a shabby barn. It smelled of horse dung, as if there were a farm nearby.\u201cIt smells a little bad, but it\u2019s a nice place.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, whatever. Lead the way.\u201dThe boy skipped over to the barn and opened the door, carrying the food.\u201cIt\u2019s Max!\u201d\u201cHyung!\u201d\u201cHey, what\u2019s that? Something smells good!\u201d\u201cYou guys didn\u2019t get to eat anything today, did you? Eat up!\u201dSo his name is Max. The younger ones surrounded Max, who grinned as he distributed the food. A boy who was lying in the corner stood up.\u201cMax, what is this?\u201d\u201cOh, Marco. This\u2026\u201d Max looked up at Seo Jun-ho. He didn\u2019t seem to know where to start.\u201cI bought it, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cSo, who are you?\u201d Marco growled as he approached him. He seemed about 19. He looked like an adult among all the children, but to Seo Jun-ho, he was still a child.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time in Rome, so he\u2019s gonna be my local guide. This is the payment.\u201d\u201c\u2026Max, is that true?\u201d\u201cYeah. Sorry I didn\u2019t discuss it with you, hyung.\u201d Marco looked from Max to Seo Jun-ho and nodded slowly.\u201cDo what you want. But you, if you do anything to my kids\u2026\u201d He trailed off, watching the children eat.\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna eat? I bought enough for everyone.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll eat what they leave over.\u201dSeo Jun-ho had expected him to be some sort of gangster because he led a group of pickpockets, but Marco was surprisingly pragmatic.\u201cWhat\u2019re you really looking for? You could\u2019ve hired a professional guide with the money you spent on all that food.\u201dHe was clever. Seo Jun-ho shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m looking for my little brother. Max said he might be in Paradise, so I want to meet the priests.\u201d\u201c\u2026Paradise?\u201d Marco nodded. \u201cI see. I understand now.\u201d\u201cBy any chance, have you ever met any of the kids since they went to Paradise?\u201d\u201cNo. Sometimes I wonder how they\u2019re doing and ask the priests, and they\u2019d give me letters from them. They seem to be doing well.\u201d\u201cReally? I want to meet them. Do you know when the priests are coming again?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lucky. They\u2019re coming in two days.\u201d\u201cTwo days\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s Sunday,\u201d he muttered.He was looking forward to his first Roman holiday.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Marco checked the clock and clanged on a pot with a spoon.\u201cEveryone gather! Start counting.\u201d\u201cHyung, can\u2019t we just skip it for tonight? We have a guest\u2026\u201d Max looked at Seo Jun-ho and grumbled.\u201cNo. It\u2019s part of the rules,\u201d Marco said firmly. The children started to gather in front of him. They sat down and shouted their numbers.\u201cOne!\u201d\u201cTwo!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cSixteen!\u201dMarco nodded approvingly, looking at the children that sat patiently like baby ducks. \u201cAlright, everyone\u2019s here. You know what to do, right?\u201d\u201cTake out the blankets!\u201d\u201cWash your face and brush your teeth!\u201d\u201cMove quickly.\u201d They dispersed in all different directions as he gave the order.

Come here!\u201dSeo Jun-ho chuckled as he watched Deva run away. The kids didn\u2019t have much, but they weren\u2019t unhappy.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d He put on his jacket and prepared to leave.\u201cWhere are you going this late?\u201d Marco asked. He\u2019d been watching him. Seo Jun-ho smiled and ruffled his hair.\u201cThe kids don\u2019t need to know.\u201d\u201c\u2026Take your hand off. I know you\u2019re going to try to pick up girls.\u201d Marco shooed him away. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna be late, be quiet when you come in. Some of them are light sleepers.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cAnd why are you wearing a mask and sunglasses at night?\u201d\u201cWhy, do you want to see my face that badly? I\u2019ll show you if you ask nicely.\u201d\u201cBastard\u2026 fuck off.\u201d He made a face and stuck up his middle finger. Seo Jun-ho laughed and left for real.The moon was bright and round, the clouds thin in the cool night air. Not to mention the horse dung.\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect night to cross a wall.\u201dSeo Jun-ho kicked off the ground to the heart of Rome. He leapt over roofs, headed to a certain city.The Vatican.* * *Vatican City was an independent country that existed to uphold the Roman Curia. Even after the Gates appeared and the 2nd floor opened, many religions prevailed; the Catholic Church was still the largest doctrine.\u201cHm. It\u2019s already this late\u2026\u201d A gray-haired man slowly stood up from his seat. He was Pope Francio XII, once called the \u2018Bell of Heaven\u2019. He was retired and spent his time as the librarian of the Vatican\u2019s secret archives. His work was simple; all he had to do was make sure that the documents didn\u2019t get damaged.As the night got darker, he made sure that there was no one left. I should turn off the lights now.Francio flipped the switch, and two shadows appeared against the moonlight coming through the window.\u201cI see that we have an uninvited guest,\u201d he muttered, walking over. The stranger kept his hand in his pocket and didn\u2019t move. \u201cWho are you?\u201dFrancio adjusted his glasses and looked at the intruder again. His eyes widened, and he started to tremble.\u201cY-you are\u2026?\u201d He could never forget the characteristic black coat and mask. \u201cOh, Lord\u2026\u201dHe gripped his cane and hobbled over.\u201cI heard you were under treatment.\u201d\u201cMy body ached because I was lying down all the time, so I decided to go out more.\u201dThe man spoke to the former Pope as if he were a friend. More interestingly, Francio seemed happy to see him.\u201cIt seems that this old Bell\u2019s prayer has reached heaven. I didn\u2019t think I would see you again.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again. I feel sorry too.\u201d\u201cHaha, have I gotten that old?\u201d Francio touched the wrinkles on his face.\u201cA long time has passed.\u201d\u201c25 years, I think.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s an honor to see you again.\u201d Francio bowed respectfully. He wasn\u2019t reserved about his humility; he was only sorry that he couldn\u2019t get on his knees because that was reserved for his God. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed that we are the ones living in the peace that you and the others brought.\u201d\u201cNo need. That\u2019s what we wanted.\u201d Specter shrugged and pulled up two chairs. \u201cTake a seat. I came here to ask you something.\u201d\u201cHa, I am an old man of no importance. I don\u2019t know as much as I used to.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019ll still listen, won\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Francio sat down.\u201cDo you know about Paradise?\u201d\u201c\u2026Paradise, you say?\u201d Francio tilted his head. \u201cAre you perhaps asking about the Paradise in the Bible?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s the name of a place. An orphanage of sorts where they raise kids\u2026 Have you heard of it?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, no.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see,\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered under his mask. As soon as Max had told him about Paradise, he\u2019d thought of Francio. If it really is related to the Vatican, there\u2019s no way he wouldn\u2019t know.But he didn\u2019t. Seo Jun-ho smiled beneath his mask. \u201cThings are getting interesting.\u201dWho would be crazy enough to pretend to be priests and kidnap children right under the Vatican\u2019s nose? The only answer was the fiends. After all, they had given up their humanity.\u201cThank you for your help.\u201d As Seo Jun-ho stood up, so did Francio.\u201cI am sorry I could not be of more help.\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019ve done more than enough.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 Is there anything else that this old man should know?\u201d\u201cMm\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho thought for a second, then nodded. \u201cThere might be a big fire in Rome in a few days, so keep the fire trucks on standby.\u201d* * *Marco woke up to the sound of raindrops. He checked to see if his dongsaengs were still asleep.\u201cHuh?\u201d He looked around. The man who\u2019d gone out to get girls had somehow fallen asleep in between the children.When did he come in? I\u2019m a pretty light sleeper.The man was still wearing his sunglasses and mask. Marco clicked his tongue.\u201cGeez. Even if I go crazy, I\u2019m not gonna be that crazy\u2026\u201dHe looked out the window. Seeing the pouring rain, they probably wouldn\u2019t be able to work today. There wouldn\u2019t be many tourists milling about.The man next to him yawned as he awoke, scratching his head as he sat up. \u201cYou wake up early.\u201d\u201cWhatever.\u201d\u201cWhat do you usually do on rainy days?\u201d\u201cWe just stay at home.\u201d\u201cWhat about food?\u201d\u201cWe have leftover pizza. We have some leftover oats too, so we can boil it into porridge.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOat porridge didn\u2019t sound very appealing. And at the moment, since it hadn\u2019t been long since he\u2019d gone to the Cave of Trials, Seo Jun-ho was pretty picky about his food.\u201cCome out with me.\u201d\u201cWhere to?\u201d\u201cThe kids will have to eat something when they wake up. Real food, not oat porridge.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re going to buy us food again?\u201d\u201cNot for nothing, of course. You\u2019ll have to be my guide for tomorrow.\u201d Marco blinked, then quickly pulled on his coat.\u201cShould we go now? Or do you need time to get ready?\u201d Seo Jun-ho muffled a laugh at his enthusiasm. No matter how he tried to act like an adult, he was still just a kid.* * *\u201cI\u2019ve never eaten at a restaurant, but I know the good places,\u201d Marco boasted.\u201cIt\u2019s wherever the locals line up. Right?\u201d\u201cYup, you got it.\u201dThey entered the city, holding their own umbrellas. The streets were quieter because of the rain.\u201cMakgeoli and pajeon are perfect for rainy days\u2026\u201d(TN: Korean rice wine and scallion pancake, respectively. It\u2019s a popular pairing.)\u201cMakgeoli? Pajeon? What are those?\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s like an Asian wine and pizza,\u201d he replied. \u201cLead the way. I\u2019ll follow you.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me,\u201d Marco said confidently. Seo Jun-ho followed him from behind and studied him.\u201cHey, your walking stance is really stable.\u201d\u201c\u2026You can see that?\u201d Marco seemed a little surprised. \u201cAre you a player?\u201d\u201cOh, did I not mention it?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t! Ack, now I get it. Max wouldn\u2019t get caught that easily.\u201d Marco nodded. \u201cI\u2019m training to become a player.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a hard job, you know.\u201d\u201cI have to do it.\u201d He paused and looked back at the barn where his siblings were sleeping. \u201cWe can\u2019t live on pickpocketing forever.\u201d\u201cDo you want to become a player because they make a lot of money?\u201d\u201cRather than that, it\u2019s the only option available to us,\u201d he muttered darkly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an orphanage address or guardians. Who would hire us? We can\u2019t even get part-time jobs.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like being called a thief either. But what can I do when my siblings are starving?\u201dIt was a world that Seo Jun-ho couldn\u2019t understand. His life wasn\u2019t easy either, but he\u2019d grown up in a good home and lived peacefully until he was in college.\u201cIf I become a player and make a lot of money, I can take care of them all.\u201d Marco clenched his hands into fists.\u201cI heard from the priests that Paradise has classes for becoming a player.\u201d He looked around, and his face became grave. \u201cI\u2019ve only told Max so far, but when the priests come this time, I\u2019m going to Paradise.\u201d\u201cYou are? What about your siblings?\u201d\u201cThe priests said that I would only need to train about a month or so at Paradise before I can get my license. Once I get it, I\u2019m going to a Gate right away to make money.\u201dThe Frost Queen, who had been listening carefully, applauded. \u201cGoodness! What a commendable child!\u201d She patted Marco\u2019s head, moved by his words.\u201cWhat the heck. My head feels itchy all of a sudden.\u201d Of course, he didn\u2019t know what was happening. \u201cAnd\u2026 well, this is just my own greed. If I become a player, I can become famous.\u201d\u201cYou want to be famous?\u201d\u201cPeople look down on me and call me a thief, but if I become a strong player\u2026\u201d Marco looked up at the sky, his fists tightening. \u201cOne day, I might be respected like Specter-nim.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hey, he isn\u2019t dead. Why are you looking up at the sky like he\u2019s dead?\u201d\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s oceans away.\u201dAt some point, they\u2019d approached a restaurant. \u201cIf you go down that alleyway, there\u2019s a restaurant that a lot of locals\u2026 huh?\u201d Marco\u2019s voice became light. \u201cIs that Anna?\u201d\u201cAnna?\u201d\u201cYeah! She was in our family, but she went to Paradise two months ago!\u201d He ran toward the girl, grinning. \u201cHey! Anna!\u201dSeo Jun-ho raised his umbrella a bit to look. There was a boy and a girl, and a middle-aged foreigner who was standing with them. Seo Jun-ho curled his lip as he saw his face.\u201c\u2026I found you.\u201dIt was Torres Milo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Anna!\u201d Torres turned to Anna as he watched Marco run toward them.\u201cDo you know him?\u201d\u201c\u2026He\u2019s the leader of the family I was part of.\u201d Anna stared at the ground, her voice devoid of life.\u201cTsk, it\u2019s an important day.\u201d He looked around, and they slipped into an alley.\u201cAnna! Anna!\u201d Marco smiled brightly as he approached them. Torres blinked.\u201cWho are you and why are you bothering our Anna?\u201d\u201cH-hello! I\u2019m Marco. I\u2019m Anna\u2019s older brother\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, so you\u2019re Marco? I\u2019ve heard a lot about you. Isn\u2019t that right, Anna?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Anna didn\u2019t look up from the ground.\u201c\u2026She seems a little strange. Is she sick?\u201d Marco asked, worried. Torres patted Anna\u2019s shoulder.\u201cOf course not. Anna\u2019s just tired because she just woke up. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHaha. Anna, it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve seen your family, so you should greet him with a smile.\u201d\u201cA smile\u2026\u201d Her empty eyes suddenly filled with life. She grabbed Marco\u2019s hands and jumped up and down as if nothing had happened. \u201cKyaa! Marco-oppa! How long has it been? Two months?\u201d\u201cYeah, how\u2019ve you been?\u201d Marco smiled as he saw the Anna that he knew return.\u201cYup! Paradise is great. The teachers are really nice and the food is really yummy! Look at my clothes!\u201d\u201cI have eyes, you know! It looks really new. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing well.\u201d His doubt started to fade away.\u201cAre Max and the others doing okay? Does Pierre still cry a lot?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same as always. Pierre cries a lot because he misses you.\u201d\u201cGeez, that crybaby\u2026 If only I could come out more often, I could see them.\u201dMarco shook his head. \u201cNo. We\u2019re happy as long as you\u2019re happy. I\u2019ll tell the kids that you\u2019re doing well.\u201d\u201cYes, please.\u201dTorres cut off their conversation. \u201cMarco, did you tell your siblings that you\u2019re coming here?\u201d\u201cHuh? No. They\u2019re still sleeping.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d Torres\u2019s lip curled upward. He held out his hand to Marco. \u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, you were here!\u201dTorres quickly pulled his hand away. He wrinkled his nose as he saw the man.Sunglasses with a mask and cap? The strange man walked over to them, holding an umbrella.\u201cAt least tell me where you\u2019re going. Why\u2019d you run off alone?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 sorry. I was just excited to see Anna.\u201dTorres cut in, \u201cAnd you are\u2026?\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m a tourist. My name\u2019s Sonny. I hired this guy to be my local guide.\u201d\u201cSonny\u2026 I see. My name is Torres.\u201dSeo Jun-ho blinked. He has guts. He\u2019s telling me his real name. That probably meant that he was confident he wouldn\u2019t get caught.Seo Jun-ho held out his hand. \u201cNice to meet you, Torres.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s nice to meet you, Mr. Sonny.\u201d As Torres shook his hand, he looked down and back up at Seo Jun-ho. \u201cAre you a player? You\u2019ve got quite a grip.\u201d\u201cWow, how did you know? That\u2019s right. I\u2019m actually level 27.\u201d Seo Jun-ho puffed out his chest as if he were boasting.\u201cI see. You must be an excellent player.\u201d\u201cYeah, people call me a genius all the time\u2026 I probably am.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I see.\u201d Torres smiled, but he was snorting on the inside. He\u2019d already made his evaluation.So he\u2019s level 27\u2026 I can tell. He could kill him with one finger.\u201cOh, Marco. Is this the person from Paradise?\u201d Seo Jun-ho asked, baiting his attention.\u201cYeah. Anna\u2019s doing really well there. It\u2019s a great place.\u201d\u201c\u2026Wait, didn\u2019t you say you\u2019re a tourist? How do you know about Paradise?\u201d Torres was smiling, but there was suspicion in his eyes.\u201cI heard from this guy. It\u2019s a long story, is that alright?\u201d\u201cPlease, go ahead.\u201dSeo Jun-ho grinned. \u201cWas it fifteen years ago? My one and only little brother\u2026 Oh, he\u2019s two years younger than me, but he was a little taller. I was stronger, though, so I would always win when we wrestled\u2026\u201d\u201cExcuse me, can you summarize it?\u201d Torres was getting annoyed at his rambling.\u201cTsk. I was just getting to the good part\u2026 Anyways, I believe that my brother is at Paradise.\u201d\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be. We don\u2019t have any adult men at the moment.\u201d\u201cProbably, but he would\u2019ve been there in the past. You have records, right? I want to take a look.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d They didn\u2019t. All the children that went to the orphanage either died or became fiends. Torres did the calculations in his head.This isn\u2019t good. If he sent the man back like this, Paradise\u2019s existence might be revealed to the world. People wouldn\u2019t believe orphaned pickpockets, but they might listen to a player.\u201c\u2026Alright. Let\u2019s go to Paradise together. But may I ask you something first?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t told anyone else about Paradise, have you?\u201d\u201cOf course not. No one even knows I\u2019m in Rome.\u201d Seo Jun-ho said what Torres wanted to hear, and he relaxed.\u201cGood. I will take you there.\u201d\u201cGoodness, weren\u2019t you going somewhere?\u201d\u201c\u2026I can cancel my appointment.\u201d He looked at Marco. \u201cYou should come as well.\u201d\u201cHuh? I have to feed the kids, though.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want to see your other little siblings? It will only take about two hours.\u201d\u201cOh, if it\u2019s only two hours\u2026\u201d Marco nodded slowly. He wanted to see their faces. \u201cI\u2019ll go. It\u2019s raining, so they\u2019ll just sleep anyway.\u201d\u201cLet us be on our way.\u201d Torres started to lead them away, and the Frost Queen clicked her tongue.\u201cContractor, what is your plan? I believe that man wishes to kill both you and the child.\u201d Just as she said, Torres\u2019s intentions were obvious. He was planning to bring them to Paradise and get rid of them there; it was the simplest solution.Seo Jun-ho waited for Torres to go ahead. \u201cAnyone would do that,\u201d he whispered.That is, until they were hit first.* * *\u201c\u2026Wow.\u201d Marco marveled at the estate beyond the gate. \u201cIs that Paradise?\u201d\u201cHaha, yes. Isn\u2019t it quite big?\u201dThe playground was full of all sorts of equipment; slides, seesaws, swings, a soccer field, a basketball court.\u201cWhen it\u2019s not raining, it\u2019s full of kids.\u201d\u201cThey must love it here.\u201d\u201cBut of course. This is Paradise, after all.\u201d Torres smiled and opened the gate. They passed by the playground and approached a large building.\u201cWow. Is this where they live?\u201d\u201cLiving quarters, classrooms, the cafeteria, and even the baths are here.\u201d\u201cWhere are my other siblings?\u201d\u201cThey are in the lecture hall.\u201d He turned to Seo Jun-ho. \u201cI will show you the records after I show him around.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cRight this way.\u201d Torres escorted them down the hall as he explained Paradise\u2019s history. \u201cThis year is the 20th anniversary of Paradise\u2019s founding.\u201d\u201cIt must have a deep history.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Paradise has produced many outstanding individuals.\u201d\u201cReally? Who?\u201dTorres paused, and the Frost Queen cackled.\u201cHe looks like a deer caught in the headlights. Of course he cannot tell you. They are all evil fiends.\u201dTorres laughed awkwardly and continued. \u201cWell, most of them don\u2019t like others to know that they are orphans. I don\u2019t have their permission.\u201d\u201cNo need to tell me, then.\u201d\u201cThank you for understanding.\u201d Torres bowed to him. As he took the lead again, he looked disgusted. Dammit, I can\u2019t believe I had to bow to this insect.But his humiliation wouldn\u2019t last for long. He\u2019d already ordered his subordinates to check that no one was tailing him. If the two weren\u2019t being followed, he would kill them immediately.\u201cHow many children are here?\u201d\u201c217.\u201d\u201cYou remember the exact number?\u201d\u201cThey are all like my own children.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d That\u2019s bullshit, Seo Jun-ho thought. He stopped and looked into the window of the lecture hall. \u201cWhat are they doing?\u201dThe children stood in two lines, facing each other with sharp weapons. They emanated a strong sense of bloodlust.\u201cHaha, they\u2019re training hard to become players.\u201d\u201cDirector!\u201d A teacher came running toward them and whispered something into Torres\u2019s ear.\u201cIt\u2019s all clear. We even searched the rooftops, but he\u2019s alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201d Torres smiled like he\u2019d remembered something funny and opened the door to the hall. \u201cWon\u2019t you impart some of your wisdom on the children as a sunbae?\u201d\u201cMe? I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure it will help them a lot.\u201d\u201cWell, if you say so\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho scratched his head and nodded. Torres led him inside and clapped his hands.\u201cAttention, everyone! Please welcome\u2026 What was your name?\u201d\u201cSonny.\u201d\u201cPlease welcome Mr. Sonny. He is an active player, and he\u2019s come to teach you some things as a sunbae.\u201d He gave a look to the teacher, who quickly escorted the children to the benches. Dozens of men and women started to approach them, carrying sharp weapons.\u201c\u2026Hey, doesn\u2019t something seem weird?\u201d Marco asked from behind him, gulping. Seo Jun-ho glanced back at him.\u201cAs I thought, you\u2019re quick. You\u2019d make a good player,\u201d he muttered.\u201cWhat?\u201dOne of the teachers slowly walked up to Seo Jun-ho. His eyes were red, seeming like they would start dripping blood at any second.\u201cF-fuck! H-his eyes are red?!\u201d Marco cursed, quickly looking around. The two hundred children and thirty teachers all had red eyes. \u201cI-if their eyes are red\u2026\u201d\u201cIt means they\u2019re fiends.\u201dTorres smiled from his seat in the audience. \u201cYou\u2019re unlucky. This wouldn\u2019t have happened if you hadn\u2019t mentioned Paradise in front of me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did you feed the children the blood of the demon clan?\u201dTorres shrugged, spreading his arms. \u201cWhat do you think? How else would they become fiends?\u201dSeo Jun-ho let out a shaky breath. All these young children were fiends, and none of them had become one willingly.\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to become fiends.\u201d\u201cOf course not. But they were practically begging for it when some of them were killed as examples.\u201d His shoulders shook as he cackled. \u201cOh, you should\u2019ve been there. It was hilarious! They were licking the blood off the ground\u2026 Hahahaha! They were so desperate to live.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d Marco pushed aside Seo Jun-ho, his face unreadable. He looked toward the benches, looking for familiar faces.Anna, Finn, Leo, Shu\u2026\u201cNo\u2026 no\u2026 This can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d Their faces were lifeless, eyes burning red like the others. Marco fell to his knees, crying. \u201cI-I sent them off\u2026 I pushed them forward with my own hands\u2026\u201dAnna, who had cried because she didn\u2019t want to leave her sisters and brothers.Finn, who had complained that Max would become the vice-leader if he left.Leo and Shu, who had been the youngest ones.He had sent them off with his own hands. Marco had simply wanted them to be happy.\u201cBut\u2026 how\u2026?\u201d How had they become fiends? Why were they staring at him with those red eyes?\u201cUrp\u2026 Bleeeghh!\u201d He felt sick. He saw stars.Finally, Marco slowly picked himself up.\u201cYou bastard\u2026!\u201d He ran toward Torres, but his body lifted into the air. One of the teachers took the chance to punch him in the stomach, and he bent over, vomiting again.\u201cHahaha! Look at him squirming like an insect!\u201d Torres gestured toward Anna. \u201cThat\u2019s your brother. What do you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d She stared down at Marco, who was groaning in pain. \u201cI\u2026 do not think anything.\u201dTorres laughed until he cried.Marco hit the ground with his fists. His skin was starting to peel and bleed, but he did not stop. He felt pathetic; he couldn\u2019t even get revenge for his siblings. He\u2019d forced them to come to such a place, despite promising that he would take care of his family.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d He glared up at Torres, eyes full of venom. \u201cSpecter-nim will kill you all.\u201d\u201cSpecter? That\u2019s a name I haven\u2019t heard in a while.\u201dOnce upon a time, Torres had looked up to Specter. He shone like a star, and normal players like Torres could never even hope to reach him.\u201cBut it\u2019s been too long.\u201d25 years had passed. That was more than enough time for his shine to fade.\u201cEven if Specter came back, there is no fiend that is afraid of him.\u201d It was true. Not even Torres himself was scared. He was level 75 and had gotten stronger as a fiend. He was confident that he could defeat Specter.\u201cYou\u2026 Once Specter-nim comes for you\u2026\u201d Rather than fear, Marco trembled in frustration.Seo Jun-ho approached him. \u201cIt hurts a lot, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cNow\u2019s not the time\u2026\u201d\u201cOnce you become a player, you\u2019ll experience things even more painful than this.\u201d Seo Jun-ho took off his coat and placed it on top of Marco. \u201cIf you want to become a player, you have to keep fighting. Even if your loved ones die right before your eyes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d Marco wiped away his tears with his sleeve. But once he started, the tears wouldn\u2019t stop.\u201cIf you really want to become a player, you must be able to raise your sword before an enemy you cannot defeat.\u201dMarco looked at him like he was speaking nonsense. Even without the children, the fiends numbered over thirty. Trying to fight them would be suicide.Ads\u201cYou\u2019re telling me to fight right now?\u201d\u201cOnly if you\u2019re a player. But you haven\u2019t quite become one yet\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho took off his sunglasses, mask and his cap. \u201cI\u2019ll help you out this time.\u201dThere was a simple black mask in his hand. There were no symbols or words written on it. But the simple mask was the most famous mask in the world.\u201cCut off the heads of all the fiends,\u201d Seo Jun-ho whispered as he fastened his mask. The darkness around him started to undulate. He looked up at the fiends in a final warning. \u201cThat way, their corpses will remain.\u201dSpecter\u2019s voice rang in the lecture hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His thoughts jumbled as if there were a system error.Why is he wearing Specter-nim\u2019s mask? Is he cosplaying?The man was acting like he was Specter himself. The wavering darkness prowled around him as if in search of prey.But I thought Specter-nim was recuperating in Korea.There was no way he was as laid-back as this man. Specter was a lofty being who was a role model and guide for all players.You\u2019re telling me I made him sleep on a haystack in a shabby barn with a bunch of orphans?Marco slowly shook his head. No matter how much he\u2019d underestimated him, he was not like Specter at all.\u201c\u2026It makes no sense.\u201dIt didn\u2019t. Of course it didn\u2019t. But why did he feel hope blooming in his chest as he stared up at his back?The coat suddenly felt heavy on his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not very smart, so I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on\u2026\u201dBut if he really was Specter\u2026\u201cPlease\u2026 Please save my siblings!\u201d Marco cried, wiping away his tears.Seo Jun-ho held out his right hand in an \u2018OK\u2019 sign.* * *\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d One of Torres\u2019s eyes was twitching. It had started when the insect in front of him had pulled out Specter\u2019s mask.\u201cHa\u2026 ahahaha!\u201d His face twisted, unable to hold back the laughter any longer. It spread infectiously, and the thirty-some fiends started laughing and clapping.\u201cHahaha! Specter? You? Ahahahaha!\u201d\u201cWell, it makes sense. His name is Sonny.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dThey grabbed their stomachs. Torres started to fan his face, which had gone red in amusement.\u201cPhew, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve met someone as funny as you.\u201d He tapped his chin as he studied Seo Jun-ho. He was trying to figure out what the most entertaining way to take care of him would be.\u201cWell, he does have the Darkness element.\u201d\u201cI believe that he used it to try to sell himself as Specter.\u201d\u201cRight. But what to do?\u201d Such tricks wouldn\u2019t work here. Torres crunched on an almond as he sat with his legs crossed.\u201cFor now, break his arms and legs. I\u2019m curious as to what he will say after that.\u201d\u201cAs tasteful as always, Director.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201dIt was a good chance to score points with Torres. The fiend who raised his hand swaggered over to Seo Jun-ho. He didn\u2019t move a muscle even as their noses touched.\u201cLook at this bastard. He\u2019s scared out of his mind.\u201d He looked back at Torres, snickering. He looked over Seo Jun-ho. \u201cSo you\u2019re Specter? The world-famous Specter?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho did not reply. He stared at him silently.\u201cWow~ Isn\u2019t this like a movie? If you\u2019re really Specter, my head will go flying in, like, five seconds. Right?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t take that long.\u201d\u201cWhat? You bastard, what are you\u2014\u201dBeeeep. The fiend thought he heard a strange noise behind him.What is that? Where is it coming from?Before he could finish his thought, he realized that he was flying through the air.Huh?But he wasn\u2019t. He watched his own body buckle to the floor.What? How\u2026How could he see his body? And why was his neck empty?He died before he realized what had happened.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA heavy silence fell over the lecture hall. Torres scrambled up from the bench, suspicion in his eyes.\u201c\u2026Watchguard of Darkness?\u201dThe swift, violent movement had made the fiend\u2019s head go flying in an instant. It reminded Torres of when he\u2019d watched Specter from a distance long ago.He gulped and lowered his head.That\u2019s not possible. What were the chances that a random player he\u2019d met on the street was Specter?Impossible. How could this happen\u2026?Still, Torres made a choice. Whether or not the man was Specter, he had to finish this.He\u2019s a powerful player. He\u2019d even managed to fool Torres. When he\u2019d first assessed him, he\u2019d thought he was a foolish weakling. But now, even he was nervous.He might be stronger than me.Torres gathered his bearings and tapped on his Vita. Luckily, there was a certain guest staying at Paradise.Just a few hours ago, I considered him an unwelcome nuisance\u2026But things were different now. He was grateful that he was here.The Demon Bow can defeat him.Of course, the best-case scenario would be defeating his opponent before Signer came. If he couldn\u2019t even take care of a single intruder, what would the Association think?\u2013 Please come to the lecture hall for a moment. I have something to show you.It was too early to tell the outcome, so he kept the message vague. He kicked his lackeys into action.\u201cWhat are you guys staring at? Kill him!\u201d\u201cY-yes!\u201d The fiends pulled themselves together and ran toward Seo Jun-ho.This is why fighting fiends is easy. They were dirty, brutal, and violent. If no one orders them to, most of them won\u2019t help or support their allies. They preferred to rely on their Demonic energy to fight head-on.\u201cFrost, stay out of this one.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me.\u201d She smiled and nodded. \u201cIf you take this seriously, my turn will not come.\u201dThey came from twelve different directions and aimed at different vital points, bloodlust propelling their movements.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho didn\u2019t try to dodge or reach for his weapon. Instead, he moved his index finger once.\u201cBe gentle.\u201dThe darkness lingering around him exploded, taking the form of wolves. They bore their fangs before ripping into the fiends.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBlood rained around him. The twelve fiends disappeared, not even a single corpse left behind. The only proof that they ever existed was the sprays of blood staining the ground.The remaining fiends started to tremble.H-he only moved his finger once\u2026 That was enough to kill them all?He doesn\u2019t even have a single drop of blood on him.They started to feel the difference in power. Even though they wanted to run away, they were frozen in place as if they were facing a Boss Monster.\u201cYou idiots! Show me what you\u2019re worth! Hunt him like he\u2019s a monster!\u201d Torres yelled.In front of them was Specter, and behind them was their violent boss. Trapped in between, they licked their lips.Dammit, you don\u2019t need to tell us what to do.If we attack all at once, we can land at least one.He\u2019s still a human, after all\u2026But whoever striked first would die. They knew it in their bones. Their feet stuck firmly to the ground.The fiends are the same as always.Seo Jun-ho hadn\u2019t taken a single step since the battle had begun. He crossed his arms and inspected them with a haughty air about him.If I kill a few of them first, the rest will make their decision.But what they didn\u2019t know was that it wouldn\u2019t matter.Either way, whether they die first or last, I\u2019ll kill them all.He was gonna hunt them.Seo Jun-ho stomped on the ground. The dark energy blanketed it, covering the entire lecture hall.\u201cD-dodge it!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let that black energy touch you!\u201d\u201cThe Darkness element ignores defensive skills! Don\u2019t try to block it!\u201dTheir theory was on point, and they had the skill to apply it.\u201cScatter!\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to survive like that.\u201d\u201cHis magic isn\u2019t infinite. Go up!\u201dThe fiends launched into the air. Some of them dashed across the wall, while others used their skills to float into the air. It seemed like Seo Jun-ho\u2019s attack had failed.\u201cHmm.\u201d Seo Jun-ho rolled his shoulders as he watched them struggle. After he\u2019d overcome his limits in the Cave of Trials, his magic circuits had been renewed.Even if I optimized the flow, I would lose about 5% of my magic. And even as Specter, he could barely reach 2\u20133%.But now, he lost 0% of his magic. The amount of magic he could use had increased, and he could use it more efficiently. Not a single drop was wasted.With his arms still crossed, Seo Jun-ho tapped on his forearm. The dark energy covering the ground started to shoot into the air.\u201cAhh!\u201d\u201cTh-thorns?!\u201dThe darkness pierced through the fiends like the sharp thorns of a rose. They tried to escape, but it was no use.\u201cRun.\u201dEven though his level was lower, his skill was preserved. With even more magic at his disposal, he had no problem using his old techniques.The thorns shot out at irregular intervals, and no fiend could escape. They started to come faster and faster, making bodies fall like dolls.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dExcept for Torres, all the fiends were lying on the ground, bleeding and groaning.Shing. Seo Jun-ho finally unsheathed Black Dragon Fang and approached them.\u201cD-don\u2019t come near me!\u201d A fiend held out his hands and used his Demonic energy. Seo Jun-ho felt something tighten around his neck.Telekinesis, probably.That was where his interest ended. He silently swung his sword, cutting off the fiend\u2019s hand.\u201cAhhhh\u2026!\u201dThe fiend gripped his wrist, trying to staunch the bleeding as he attempted to crawl away. Seo Jun-ho approached him slowly and stabbed his sword through his chest.\u201cG-gah\u2026!\u201dSeo Jun-ho didn\u2019t show him mercy. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to die like that.\u201dBlack Dragon Fang slowly dug into his heart. His face paled and contorted from the pain.\u201cGuh\u2026 huff\u2026 K-kill me\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201dThe fiend couldn\u2019t endure the pain any longer; he bent forward, ending his own life. Shaken by his violent death, some of the other fiends finished the job themselves.\u201c\u2026Fiend Hunter,\u201d Torres muttered vacantly.He remembered the story about Specter killing a hundred fiends without raising a finger. Ever since then, it had become one of his nicknames.\u201cG-get him! Buy time until the Demon Bow gets here!\u201d He shouted to the children. He was starting to get impatient. All 217 children who were under his perfect control stood up.\u201cSit down while I\u2019m being nice!\u201d Seo Jun-ho hissed.Watchguard of Darkness was much more powerful and vicious than Torres\u2019s Demonic energy. The children had to obey either his order or their instincts.The consideration between both was too much for the children, causing their eyes to roll back. They started to collapse one by one.\u201cUgh\u2026 ah\u2026\u201dTorres was the only one left in the large lecture room. His face became white. He threw aside his almonds and ran toward the door.Click. As he opened the door, his body was suddenly pulled back.\u201cGah!\u201d He fell to the ground and hurriedly tried to stand up, but his body wouldn\u2019t move. He looked down at his legs in disbelief.\u201cAh\u2026 huh\u2026?\u201dThey weren\u2019t there. In the span of less than a few seconds, his legs had been cut off. He stared down at the stumps of his knees.And an indescribable pain filled him, one beat late.\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201dHis fists hit the ground, and his body rolled. Tears flowed from his scarlet eyes.\u201cFuck! Why\u2026 You son of a bitch!\u201d He didn\u2019t understand why he had to go through such pain.\u201cIsn\u2019t it unfair? You didn\u2019t even do much, but you think I\u2019m being too harsh, don\u2019t you?\u201d Seo Jun-ho whispered.\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201dTorres bit his lip and looked down. He was so drunk with pain that he couldn\u2019t even look up at Seo Jun-ho.\u201cBut let me ask you. Have you ever once thought about the children whom you forced into becoming fiends?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, yes!\u201d Torres nodded his head eagerly. He was lying of course, but he thought that he would die if he told the truth. Thankfully, it seemed that he made the right choice.\u201cOh, really?\u201d Specter\u2019s voice suddenly became brighter. He spoke sweetly. \u201cThat\u2019s good. You won\u2019t feel bad when you die, then.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026? You fuck\u2014!\u201dTorres cursed as he held out his two hands to block the sword. But human flesh is soft, and the sword is sharp.The blade cut through his palms and pierced through his neck.\u201cGah\u2026 ugh\u2026 Save\u2026 keuk\u2026\u201dBlood poured from his mouth. Seo Jun-ho leaned down and whispered to the dying man.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be lonely. I\u2019ll send over all of your friends soon.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He stopped breathing.\u2026The fuck? Did he go crazy?Seo Jun-ho stared at him. His eyes were still open, as if he refused to go.\u201cThat\u2019s a good look for you. Keep it that way.\u201d Seo Jun-ho wiped the blood off Black Dragon Fang using Torres\u2019s clothes, then held out his hand to the corpse\u2019s forehead.\u201cConfession of the dead.\u201d[The Confession of the Dead has begun.]Seo Jun-ho sat down on the floor as the Memory Projection appeared before him. The Frost Queen tilted her head.\u201cIs this one of the \u2018dramas\u2019 you were referring to?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 This is your first time seeing this, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He briefly explained the skill, and she quickly became interested.\u201cOh my! So this mystical skill allows you to look at the life of the target?\u201dAdvertisements\u201cYeah. I can get a lot of info on the fiends with this. He\u2019s not the end of the trail.\u201d Torres was likely one of the smallest fish.I\u2019ll comb through all the memories and find something useful.He started the playback from the very beginning\u2014from Torres\u2019s adolescence.So he didn\u2019t have a good childhood. As an adult, he worked as a player, but his skill had its limits. That was when his inferiority complex had begun.\u201cHe became a fiend ten years ago and acted as a spy.\u201d\u201cTo think that he sold out his own comrades\u2026 He is a heartless human.\u201dAfter that, he became involved in big scandals on the 2nd floor.\u201cThis bastard was involved in the Player Disappearance Case and the Phantom Village incident?\u201dThey were some of the biggest scandals to have occurred. Torres used his skill to manipulate people\u2019s minds and caused confusion in the investigations.\u201cAnd then he received his position in Paradise as a reward.\u201d After building the trust of the Fiend Association for ten years, he had become the director of the orphanage a few months ago.Something useful\u2026Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes shifted, taking in every little detail from the playback.\u201cThere are eight high executives in the Fiend Association.\u201d But there\u2019s nothing about the President, and Torres didn\u2019t know anything about the members even though he was the director of Paradise. How? Just how big are they?He started to realize just how cautious the Fiend Association was. After Specter had burned their roots, they had decided to go completely undercover. All he knew about their hierarchy was that the members received orders from the eight executives.This isn\u2019t good. There\u2019s less info than I thought.The useless man didn\u2019t even know where the Association was located. The only executive that he knew was \u2018Chef\u2019.\u201cContractor, is a \u2018chef\u2019 not a person who cooks?\u201d\u201cYeah, it means the same thing here\u2026 It\u2019s just a weird nickname.\u201d He changed the timestamp to the day Torres had become the director.* * *Knock, knock.Torres knocked on the director\u2019s office, his face tense.\u2013 \u201cCome in.\u201dTorres entered the room and bowed deeply.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you, Roxanne-nim!\u201d\u201cJust call me Chef. Are you Torres?\u201d She was looking out the window.\u201cYes, Chef! I am the new director of Paradise!\u201dHis energetic responses were like that of a new recruit.\u201cWhat are your skills?\u201d\u201cI can manipulate the mind. It\u2019s A-rank.\u201d\u201cReally? It sounds delicious.\u201d She turned around, but her face wasn\u2019t visible due to the harsh backlighting.\u201cMmph\u2026!\u201d As he met Chef\u2019s eyes, Torres kneeled while dripping with cold sweat. It was something fiends did when they met another who was much stronger than them.\u201cNo need to be so nervous. I just want a taste.\u201d She laughed, a small orb floating in front of her. She opened her mouth wide and swallowed it in one gulp. \u201cMm\u2026 What a peculiar taste.\u201dShe gave a satisfied nod and took out a notebook from the drawer, writing something down. \u201cI wonder what ingredients I need to create such a taste\u2026 It may be possible with what I have now\u2026\u201dShe was deep in thought for a while, but she finally closed it. \u201cI think I\u2019ve found a useful recipe. Thank you for giving me such a good ingredient.\u201d\u201cO-of course.\u201d\u201cAs for your compensation\u2026 Yes. Let me tell you something interesting.\u201d She leaned perched on the windowsill. \u201cTorres. When do you think Paradise was founded?\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, it was created around 24 years ago.\u201d\u201cPrecisely. And do you know why it was made?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Wasn\u2019t it to cultivate powerful fiends?\u201dChef smiled and shook her head. \u201cTo make good food, you need good ingredients. It\u2019s the same for fiends.\u201d She tapped on the window with her fingernail. \u201cLook at the children running around. They are talented rubbish that we found on the streets. Do you think such substandard ingredients can become strong even if we feed them the best demon blood?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cExactly. They aren\u2019t players. Even if we feed them the blood, they\u2019ll only become half-rate fiends.\u201dShe opened a thick book sitting on the desk. \u201cIn the last 24 years, Paradise has successfully created 2,985 fiends. 1,898 were 3rd-grade items that couldn\u2019t even awaken their abilities. 1,082 2nd-grade items could do so. And only five 1st-grade items became notably powerful.\u201d\u201cAh, and one of them was Nazad-nim\u2019s disciple, the Skeleton Mage.\u201d\u201cYes. In the four years that I\u2019ve been overseeing Paradise, he is the only 1st-grade item that has been created.\u201d There was a sense of pride in her voice. She closed the book. \u201cIt seems that we\u2019ve strayed from our original topic.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still listening.\u201d Torres swallowed. His heart pounded at the thought of learning secrets that no other fiends would know.\u201c24 years ago, the fiends that were in hiding went up to the Frontier and created the Association. But they were still cautious. Even though the Five Heroes were dead, they were afraid that they could come and kill them all. That\u2019s how great Specter\u2019s effect was. Their fear could not be erased in just a year.\u201d\u201cAs the President watched the fiends live in fear, they decided that we needed power. Undefeatable, devastating power that could fight against the Five Heroes even if they returned! They all recalled the ability of a certain enemy they had faced, someone who had such overwhelming power. The strongest elemental skill\u2014Watchguard of Darkness.\u201d\u201c\u2026W-wait. So Paradise was founded to create the second Specter?\u201d Torres was shocked. He never even imagined that it was for such a reason.\u201cPfft, is it that hard to believe? Think about it. If we managed to obtain even half\u2026 No, even a fourth of that power, what would happen?\u201d\u201c\u2026If we combined it with Demonic energy, that person would become the strongest fiend in history.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Chef clapped. \u201cSo the fiends worked around the clock, but all their experiments failed. The chance of talentless orphans awakening such a powerful skill is close to 0%. That\u2019s why I came down to the 1st floor. I can\u2019t leave everything to chance. I came to create a Darkness skill myself.\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d Torres exclaimed. \u201cSo you plan to use Perfect Taste (S).\u201d\u201cBingo.\u201dChef could materialize others\u2019 skills and try them. If they were F-rank or lower, she could even use them herself. Not only that, she could combine the skills she combined to \u2018cook\u2019 a new skill that was higher in rank. In theory, she could even create her own S-rank skill.\u201cBut all food has an expiration date.\u201d She sighed. \u201cF-rank skills only last two months.\u201d Even if she copied them, they would disappear after that time. She kidnapped children every two months because she always needed fresh ingredients.\u201cThis place was truly paradise for me,\u201d she said, stroking the desk with her delicate fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a place with as many fresh ingredients as we have here.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 since you\u2019re returning to the 2nd floor, does that mean you\u2019ve succeeded?\u201d Torres asked carefully. She\u2019d already been on the 1st floor for four years despite being an executive. It was impossible to guess how many skills she had cooked up during that time.Chef shook her head. \u201cI failed to recreate Watchguard of Darkness. The most similar one was the Shadow element.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026! I did hear that you granted the abilities of the Shadow Brothers.\u201d\u201cIt was still a failure. Compared to Specter\u2019s skill, they\u2019re no better than trash.\u201dShe suddenly started to laugh. \u201cFufu, it\u2019s simple. I no longer need to waste my time here.\u201d\u201cIs that because Specter has returned?\u201d\u201cOf course. Rather than trying to create a skill on the 1st floor, it\u2019s much easier to wait on the 2nd floor until he comes up.\u201d She expected it to be easy to recreate Watchguard of Darkness once she had a taste.\u201cAhh, I wonder how it\u2019ll taste\u2026 I\u2019m already excited.\u201dShe trembled as she licked her lips.* * *\u201c\u2026Stop skill use,\u201d Seo Jun-ho whispered. He wiped his face with his hands. His thoughts were all jumbled after hearing the truth.This fucking place\u2026 was made because of me?He felt like a boulder had dropped on his chest. Paradise was founded to create a copycat of him?\u201cThey made thousands of children into fiends\u2026\u201dBecause of him.\u201cDammit all!\u201d He punched the wall, gritting his teeth. It didn\u2019t relieve any of his anger.\u201cContractor\u2026 it is not your fault,\u201d she said gently.Advertisements\u201cI still feel like shit.\u201dReality wasn\u2019t always so sweet. And this time, it made his entire mouth go dry.\u201cOnce you become a fiend\u2026\u201d You couldn\u2019t go back. He\u2019d discovered this while hunting countless fiends in the past, and Deok-gu had confirmed that it still wasn\u2019t possible.Then, all those children who suffered because of me\u2026 The children\u2026He had to end it with his own hands, even if he didn\u2019t want to.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sea of blood made the ground slippery, and the stench of iron pricked his nose.\u201cWake up! Anna! Leo!\u201dHe tried to shake them awake, but they remained unconscious.

They\u2019ll go back to normal then\u2026\u201d He blubbered. Seo Jun-ho looked down at him.He knew why Marco was acting like this.\u2026Poor kid.Marco already knew that it was too late. Seo Jun-ho understood, and he felt sorry.\u201cHuh?\u201d Specter started to stroke his head. He\u2019d always been his favorite player. Marco should\u2019ve felt happy, but tears formed instead; once they started, they wouldn\u2019t stop. He choked.\u201cPlease\u2026 Please save my siblings,\u201d he begged. But he wasn\u2019t stupid. He knew that no fiend had ever turned back to normal. \u201cThey\u2019ve already been thrown away once. They didn\u2019t have much clothes or even food. Ever since they were old enough to think, they started stealing food and ran away just so that they wouldn\u2019t die.\u201dHow could they be fiends? They were children who cried because they didn\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t have parents. He couldn\u2019t just let them die when they\u2019d never experienced happiness. Marco felt like his chest was ripping apart from the unfairness of it all.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho felt bad as he watched Marco sob. He hated fiends, but these children weren\u2019t like the fiends he had always encountered.They did nothing wrong.True, some of them had killed before, but that was because they\u2019d been under Torres\u2019s control. They wouldn\u2019t even remember their victims.And it\u2019s all my fault that this happened.He truly wanted to help Marco. But he couldn\u2019t.They were fiends.\u201cI understand how you feel.\u201d Marco raised his head. There was hope in his red, swollen eyes.\u201cBut I still can\u2019t,\u201d he said, resolute. It would be cruel to give him hope.\u201cWhy not? Why can\u2019t you? You heard what he said. They didn\u2019t want to become fiends in the first place!\u201d\u201cMarco. Do you know why society treats fiends so badly?\u201dMarco couldn\u2019t answer. He just thought that they were like any other criminals and terrorists based on what he saw on the news, and most people thought the same.\u201cWhen a person drinks demon blood, one of two things happen. They either die because they can\u2019t adjust to it, or they become a fiend.\u201d Seo Jun-ho pointed. The children were starting to stir.\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201d\u201cOw, my head. Where is this place?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that smell? Blood?\u201dThe first thing they saw as they awoke was a hall covered in blood. They started to vomit like Marco had.\u201cUrp\u2026!\u201d\u201cBleegh!\u201dMarco watched them. \u201cLook, they\u2019re just like me. They\u2019re humans.\u201d\u201cYes, humans and fiends aren\u2019t so different. But\u2026\u201dThe children\u2019s eyes turned red at the sight of blood. They started to walk toward the two, as if attracted by a magnet.\u201c\u2026Oppa?\u201d(TN: Korean word for older brother, used by girls to boys.)\u201cHyung\u2026\u201dAmong them were Marco\u2019s siblings. Marco started to run toward them, but Seo Jun-ho grabbed him.\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying? They\u2019re my siblings! Let me go!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho silently held onto him. A moment later, Anna approached them. She shook her head, confused.\u201cOppa\u2026 I think something\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you hurt? Did you get injured?\u201d\u201cOppa\u2026 I really like you, but\u2026\u201d She raised her hands. They were shaking violently. \u201cWhy\u2026 Why do I want to kill you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d Marco couldn\u2019t say anything in shock. He looked up at Seo Jun-ho, trembling.\u201c\u2026Do you get it now? That\u2019s what a fiend is.\u201d Violent and savage. Once they drank the blood, they all became the same way. They would be able to use the power of the demon clans, but they would have the constant, uncontrollable urge to kill.I\u2019m sorry,\u00a0Anna\u2019s eyes seemed to say as she met Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes.She was still a young child. She was at an age when she needed the warmth and support of a parent.It was unfair that she had to die before she could learn to read.\u201c\u2026You understand now, don\u2019t you? Why society rejects and hates fiends so much.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMarco squeezed his eyes shut. He didn\u2019t respond. He did understand.\u2026Because they kill the people they\u2019re precious to.Fiends weren\u2019t humans. They were monsters that always wanted to kill\u2014even those that they loved.\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer,\u201d Seo Jun-ho warned, an edge to his voice. But the children couldn\u2019t control themselves and continued forward.He let out a long sigh and grabbed Anna\u2019s wrist to break it.A series of messages appeared before his eyes.[You sense Arch-level Demonic energy from the target.][You can absorb Demonic energy with the \u2018Watchguard of Darkness\u2019 skill.][Your Magic stat will increase upon absorption.]\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes flashed. He read over the message several times.Arch Demonic energy? And I can absorb it? This is\u2026It was the same message that had appeared when he treated Choi Sun-hee\u2019s Nine Yin Severance Syndrome.His head started to spin.\u00a0Impossible. I\u2019ve killed hundreds of fiends, but this has never happened before.Had Watchguard of Darkness developed a new ability after 25 years? He shook his head.If there\u2019s a reason why this is happening, it\u2019s because of them, not me. Maybe\u2026?Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes widened.That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the only difference between them.Most of the fiends that Seo Jun-ho encountered had been players who were tempted by a stronger power. That was it\u2014they were players.\u201c\u2026Specter-nim.\u201dMarco bit his lip and raised his head. He looked like he had made a decision. \u201cPlease\u2026 Please let me be the one to end it.\u201dHe was talking about his siblings. Someone had to take care of them, and Marco thought that he should be the one.\u201c\u2026Are you sure? This will follow you for the rest of your life. You won\u2019t ever forget it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll carry the burden and push through. That\u2019s what you told me.\u201dSpecter had told him that a player kept going even if the people they loved died in front of them.Both Seo Jun-ho and the Frost Queen patted him on the head.\u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\u201cYou should be proud.\u201dAs he looked down at Marco\u2019s confused face, Seo Jun-ho felt sure that he would become a great player.There aren\u2019t many players who cry for others.\u201cToo bad. I don\u2019t think you need to carry all that just yet.\u201dSeo Jun-ho poured his magic into Anna, pushing it into her circuits.Consume it.Seo Jun-ho expelled the small amount of Demonic energy stuck in her circuits with a single push. Watchguard of Darkness lapped up the crumbs. It only took three seconds for his magic to travel all throughout Anna\u2019s small body.[Your Magic stat has increased by 0.05.]The amount of magic he gained was also small. But beneath his mask, Seo Jun-ho was grinning wide. Anna\u2019s eyes faded back to normal.\u201cHuh?! Anna, your eyes!\u201d\u201cYou can touch her now. She\u2019s your sister again.\u201d\u201cHow\u2026 Anna! Are you okay?!\u201d Anna fell to the ground, and he rushed to help her.\u201cOppa\u2026? M-my brain feels foggy. My memory\u2019s vague\u2026 and I\u2019m tired.\u201d\u201cYou idiot. Thank God\u2026 Thank God\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Ew, why are you crying on me? Give me some space.\u201dSeo Jun-ho watched them fondly. The Frost Queen saw him and cackled.\u201cMy goodness, is my Contractor weak to children?\u201d\u201c\u2026Shut up. I\u2019m not.\u201d\u201cYou are a man with many weaknesses.\u201d\u201cI said I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t have any weaknesses.\u201d\u201cFufu. So you say.\u201d The Frost Queen stuck out her tongue and took her seat on his shoulder.They were both smiling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As an unfamiliar ceiling came into view, he slipped his hand under his pillow. The dagger he always put underneath was there.\u201cAh.\u201dHe gripped it in his fist as he took in his surroundings. Finally, he sat up. He remembered that he was back on the 1st floor and checked the clock on the table.\u201c\u2026I slept for seventeen hours?\u201d He muttered in surprise. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d been able to rest like this. For the past few months, his body had been constantly exhausted because of Kim Woo-joong\u2019s pursuit. It sapped his energy, and his health wasn\u2019t great either.Fucking Kim Woo-joong. I\u2019ll make you pay for humiliating me.\u00a0He gulped down the glass of water he had put on the table and went to go shower.He was currently in a bunker in the basement of Paradise that had been built long ago for a war. He was perfectly isolated from the rest of the world.\u201cIt\u2019s nice and sturdy.\u201d No one would be able to find him\u2014not even a member of the Nine Heavens.Signer took a long shower and came out wearing comfortable workout clothes. He checked his Vita.A message?\u00a0It was from Torres and had been sent six hours ago. Signer\u2019s face twisted as he read the text.\u2013 Please come to the lecture hall for a moment. I have something to show you.\u201c\u2026Is that weakling trying to give me an order?\u201d He let out a frustrated sigh. It had only been two days since they\u2019d agreed to stay quiet and mind each other\u2019s business. Yet here he was, trying to summon him. He couldn\u2019t even be bothered to come to Signer himself and had sent a text message instead.Did he go crazy?Fiends lived under the creed of \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019. It was a world that was ruled by the strong. Torres may have been the director of Paradise, but he was barely level 75. To Signer, who was level 100, he was like a child.\u201cTsk, it\u2019s annoying\u2026 but I\u2019ll see what\u2019s going on.\u201dAs fiends did, Signer was planning to give him a good beating. He emerged from the bunker with a sour face.The entrance was in the back of the property, and Signer stopped as he approached the building.\u201cHm?\u201d Being the experienced player that he was, he noticed that something was wrong. His eyes narrowed.It\u2019s too loud.Just the day before, Paradise had been a quiet place. Since the two hundred children were under Torres\u2019s control, they did not scream or run around. But now, he could hear dozens of people all around the building, milling around and talking. Two men started to walk out of the building.\u201cI\u2019m supposed to start on the 1st floor, correct?\u201d\u201cYeah, all the offices are here, so go through all of them before\u2026 Huh?\u201dThey froze as they saw Kal Signer.\u201cYou bastard, do your job right! How did a civilian get here?\u201d The supervisor hit the other man on the back of the head.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. But I definitely did it right\u2026\u201d The subordinate frowned and waved his hands in a shooing motion. \u201cHey, ahjussi*. You look like you got in here by accident, but you can\u2019t just waltz in here.\u201d(TN: Korean for \u2018mister\u2019, typically used to refer to middle-aged men.)\u201c\u2026Ahjussi?\u201d Kal Signer\u2019s eyes were full of fury.He looked around.\u00a0What?He didn\u2019t understand what was going on. From what he saw, the two men in front of him definitely weren\u2019t fiends.\u00a0They\u2019re not even players. They\u2019re just insects.That\u2019s where he started to get confused.\u00a0How did normal people get into Paradise? Where are the rest of the fiends?It wasn\u2019t just these two. There were dozens of people running around, carrying boxes and files; they were all normal people.\u201cWhat the hell is going on here\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhy do you need to know? Hurry up and go. Leave!\u201d\u2026Should I just kill them all?\u00a0Bloodlust leaked into his eyes, but he quickly suppressed his anger.\u00a0Dammit, if only it weren\u2019t for Seo Jun-ho.He was carrying out Nazad Hallow\u2019s orders. It would be bad for him if he did something that caught the other\u2019s attention.\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201dThe air was cool on his face as he left with only the clothes on his back. He turned around and muttered to himself.\u201c\u2026What the hell happened while I was asleep?\u201dThere was no one there to answer his question.* * *Seo Jun-ho sat in the vast sanctuary of the Vatican Palace. The guard players kept glancing at him.\u201c\u2026They\u2019re all staring at you,\u201d Marco whispered. He squirmed in his seat, uncomfortable.Seo Jun-ho turned the page in his newspaper. \u201cDon\u2019t pay them any mind. They\u2019re rightfully expressing their respect,\u201d he said nonchalantly.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOr so he said, but Seo Jun-ho glanced around his surroundings. Just as Marco had said, they were all staring at him in admiration.It\u2019s worse than before.Of course, tons of people had admired him 25 years ago. But now, they practically treated him like a god. Everyone would bow their heads as he passed them in the streets.Well, it\u2019s not a bad thing.\u00a0He hummed to himself.They were currently waiting for the examinations to finish. They would soon find out if the children had truly turned back to normal.\u201cIs it really gonna be alright? My siblings\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you. They\u2019re not fiends anymore.\u201d Unlike Marco, Seo Jun-ho was sure of it.I sucked up all the Demonic energy from the roots. If they\u2019re still fiends, they might\u2019ve been born with it.He\u2019d absorbed the energy from all 217 children, raising his Magic stat by 21. His level had also increased by 2 after killing all the fiends.\u201cWe\u2019ve finished examining them,\u201d a priest said as he approached. He made the sign of the cross, seeming overjoyed. \u201cSpecter-nim has once again given hope to the land! The children are safe!\u201d\u201cWow\u2026!\u201d\u201cSpecter-nim!\u201dPriests, players, and civilians alike made the sign of the cross and raised their hands in prayer.Pope Aberson V approached him and bowed his head. \u201cSpecter-nim\u2026 I sincerely thank you for saving the lives of these little lambs.\u201d\u201cWell, someone had to do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026And I am ashamed that that \u2018someone\u2019 was not us. If it\u2019s alright, may I release this incident to the public to warn others about the fiends?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d He had already been planning to make an announcement about Specter when he went back to Korea.It\u2019s not a bad idea to sprinkle some crumbs in the Vatican first.He shook the pope\u2019s wrinkly hand.\u201cBuf if you\u2019re really thankful, can I ask you a favor?\u201d(TN: Specter actually speaks to the pope casually.)\u201cPlease, speak.\u201d\u201cAll the children I brought are orphans. They became scapegoats of crime because they didn\u2019t have guardians.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The pope was silent. He couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine how much pain and fear the children had suffered through.\u201cYour enemies are also closer than you think. The Vatican is the holiest place on Earth, and this happened right under your noses. You know the Church isn\u2019t entirely blameless, right?\u201d\u201cI have nothing to say. We\u2019ve come to realize how blind we were.\u201d\u201cThen, take responsibility. The Vatican has the capacity to take care of all the orphans in Rome, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dSeo Jun-ho couldn\u2019t do all that himself. He needed to leave it to them. Thankfully, the pope nodded eagerly.\u201cWe won\u2019t spare any hands. We\u2019ll make sure the children are properly educated and happy.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all I need to hear.\u201d He felt like a huge weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He patted Marco\u2019s head. \u201cSince you\u2019re now under the care of the Vatican, you won\u2019t have any problems getting a part-time job.\u201d\u201cSpecter-nim\u2026\u201d Marco started to tear up, but Seo Jun-ho only smiled.\u201cYou say you\u2019re a man, but all you do is cry.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m not crying. There\u2019s dust\u2026 My eyes sting, that\u2019s all.\u201dThere must\u2019ve been a lot of it, because he cried for a long time.Both Seo Jun-ho and the pope laughed.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *The Association teleporter approached Seo Jun-ho, all ready to leave.

He seemed somewhat dissatisfied.\u201c\u2026Is it really okay if you leave like this?\u201d\u201cIt would be a hassle if there\u2019s a lot of people. That\u2019s why you were the only one I called for.\u201dThe only people in the room were the three of them. The Vatican had respected his wishes to leave quietly.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re really weird, Specter-nim. You\u2019re the complete opposite of what I\u2019ve read in the books.\u201d\u201cReally? What do the books say?\u201d\u201cThey say you\u2019re a lot nobler, colder\u2026 and they also say you\u2019re boring.\u201dSeo Jun-ho bent down to meet his height. \u201cThis is your second lesson. As a player, don\u2019t believe everything you read.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d His eyes sparkled. Marco scratched his neck and bowed deeply. \u201cI saw that this is how people in Korea show their thanks.\u201d\u201cWhere did you see that\u2026?\u201d\u201cYouTube.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho was silent.\u201cOnce I become a good player, you\u2019ll be the first person I run to. I\u2019m gonna repay you by becoming your apprentice,\u201d he promised.\u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t take apprentices or anything like that.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Marco\u2019s face turned red. Seo Jun-ho ruffled his hair.\u201cI only take teammates. But the standards are a bit high. If you wanna get there, you\u2019ll have to train your ass off.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Marco\u2019s face brightened as he looked up. His heart leaped. He was as happy as the first time his hero had encouraged him.\u201cI hope you\u2019re happy. Send my regards to your siblings.\u201d\u201cYes, please stay healthy!\u201dSeo Jun-ho and the teleporter disappeared.* * *Kal Signer pulled at his hair as he flipped through articles. He finally understood why he\u2019d been chased out of Paradise.[Breaking news! The Specter\u2019s big revival!][The Specter destroys fiend hideout!][What exactly did Paradise do? Pope Aberson V makes a shocking reveal.][\u2018Fiend Hunter\u2019 Specter is still going strong 25 years later.]The articles popping up in real-time were all about Specter.He ground his teeth.Dammit, if I weren\u2019t sleeping back then\u2026The regret hit him like a wave. If he\u2019d been able to kill Specter or capture him alive, he might\u2019ve been promoted to the Eighth Apostle.\u201cTsk. Why are there so many lucky guys these days?\u201dHe was referring to Seo Jun-ho and Specter. Signer was more confident in his abilities than others.He sighed.\u00a0Seems like this wasn\u2019t the right time, Specter.As he looked down at his plane ticket to Korea, his frustration subsided a bit.\u201cJust you wait. After I kill Seo Jun-ho\u2026 you\u2019ll be next.\u201dSigner planned to catch two rabbits before he went back up to the 2nd floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were people at the entrance, sidewalk, the street, even people looking on from the rooftops. They were all here for one reason.\u201cI-It\u2019s Specter-nim!\u201d\u201cOh my god\u2026 It really is him\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you for coming back!\u201dTo see Specter.By police estimates, there had been over fifty thousand people gathered in front of the Association.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs he looked over the mob, Seo Jun-ho felt touched. He\u2019d never even dreamed that so many people would gather here for him.\u2026Thank you.It was that much more touching because he hadn\u2019t expected it. There was a big difference between hearing that people hadn\u2019t forgotten him and his comrades\u2019 sacrifice and seeing it for himself.\u201cSpecter! Specter!\u201d\u201cSpecter! Specter!\u201dTheir chants were so loud that they couldn\u2019t be replicated over speakers; it gave him goosebumps. They were all trying to send one message.We\u2019re glad you\u2019re back. And thank you.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEven the large billboards connected to the buildings were playing videos from his past. Seo Jun-ho started to feel a little sheepish and lowered his head. When he did, they started to cheer again.\u201c\u2026You really are quite famous.\u201d Even the Frost Queen was in awe.\u201cSpecter-nim, we will escort you inside.\u201d The Association Players flanked him.

Nah.\u201d Deok-gu laughed. \u201cThe police estimated that there are about 52,000 people and counting. Do you think I\u2019m the president or something?\u201d Even if he were, it would be impossible to gather so many people in such a short time.\u201cHow about the billboards?\u201d\u201cAhem. Well, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d He squared his shoulders proudly, but a moment later, he sighed and looked at his friend. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve known you for so long, you\u2019re always unpredictable.\u201dA few hours ago, Seo Jun-ho had sent him a message, telling him to start preparations for the conference.\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna be announcing your cooperation with the Association this time, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded.\u201cYou told me before you went to Rome that Specter will only have a working relationship with the Association so that we can build connections, rather than working under us.\u201d\u201cI did. But I changed my mind.\u201d He closed his eyes as if remembering something. \u201cDeok-gu, do you remember when you came to my hospital room? You said something to me that day.\u201dIt had already been four months, but it still felt like yesterday.\u201cYou told me that the world is peaceful now. That I don\u2019t need to return because our sacrifice saved the world. That I should live for myself now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut after four months of seeing it myself, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. The fiends weren\u2019t this bold 25 years ago\u2014they couldn\u2019t be.\u201d\u201cJun-ho. That\u2019s because of the Five Heroes, and their effect is irreplaceable. But now\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. The fiends I encountered at Paradise treated me like a has-been.\u201dThey were no longer scared of him. They hunted him like a trophy to be won.\u201cJun-ho.\u201d Deok-gu\u2019s face was solemn. \u201cThere is nothing more dangerous than the courage of someone who is weak.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d He agreed. He knew all too well how things ended up. \u201cBut I can\u2019t just stand by any longer.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so\u2026\u201d\u201cParadise,\u201d Seo Jun-ho said darkly. \u201cDo you know why it was made? Haha\u2014It was made to create the second Specter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d Deok-gu was speechless.\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny? They hated me so much\u2026 but they sacrificed thousands of children to create a similar being.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\u201cI know that. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it started because of me.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019re gonna take responsibility?\u201d\u201cYeah. To be honest, I thought that all I needed to do was get a little stronger and save my friends.\u201d But Paradise had completely changed his mind. \u201cBut after I thought about it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough when the fiends are working around the clock.\u201dThe fiends from the past had been different. Before they did something bad, they would always remember Specter\u2019s face.\u201cSpecter always shows up at the sinner\u2019s door. All fiends who meet him die.\u201dThat simple phrase had dissuaded crime, and Specter\u2019s simple existence kept people safe.\u201c\u2026But as you said, you can\u2019t take on the same role as before.\u201d\u201cI know. I don\u2019t want to do this either.\u201d If there was someone else to carry the burden, he wouldn\u2019t need to do anything. But no one could. \u201cThe Nine Heavens and the rankers\u2026 Their levels and stats are higher than mine were, but they don\u2019t want to step forward.\u201dRather, no one\u00a0could\u00a0step forward. There was no one as powerful or influential as Specter.\u201cThey know that it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d After thinking about it for a long time, he realized that he was the only person who could do this. \u201cMy skills may not be enough, but my influence is.\u201dThe moment he opened his mouth, players listened. And he would make it so that fiends would think twice again before they committed a crime.\u201cOnly Specter can destroy the fiends like this, as he did in the past.\u201dSeo Jun-ho was a person. A selfish person.Specter is a complete entity. It would be a neat little ending if I retired and all that was left of me remained in history books.But he refused to take such an easy path. He would use his name and influence to make people vigilant of the fiends again.\u201c\u2026You have made a difficult decision. I will remember your courage.\u201d The Frost Queen applauded his bravery.It was easy to be a hero if you had nothing to lose. It was much harder when you could lose everything.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter a long while, Shim Deok-gu spoke again. \u201c\u2026Once you make an announcement, you won\u2019t be able to take it back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already made my decision.\u201d\u201cEvery time the fiends incite terror, people will be looking for you. And if you don\u2019t appear the moment they want you to, they\u2019ll curse you.\u201dAs admired and loved as he was, Specter could lose all that in an instant. But Seo Jun-ho had already made up his mind.\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cThere will be a dozen\u2014a hundred times more fiends that will be hunting for Specter.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped.\u201dShim Deok-gu let out a long sigh and scratched his hair that his stylist had spent so long on. No matter what he said, he couldn\u2019t change his friend\u2019s mind.\u201cYou\u2019re as stubborn as a mule\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always been like this.\u201d Whenever Seo Jun-ho caused a stir, Shim Deok-gu had always cleaned up after him. He clapped his hands together.\u201cDo whatever you want, you bastard. What can I do for you?\u201d\u201cRaise the volume. As high as you can.\u201d\u201cEven louder than they are now? Things will get pretty noisy.\u201dSeo Jun-ho smiled. \u201cTurn it up so that my voice will reach the 2nd floor.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *The conference room was packed. They\u2019d reduced the amount of seats to save as much room as possible, but there was still barely any room to breathe.\u201cIs this the power of Specter?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just reporters today. Look over there.\u201dThe reporters gasped as they saw who were sitting near the front.\u201cA-are those Big 6 Vice-Guildmasters and Team Leaders?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the hero that saved their generation. But to them, he\u2019s just a thing of the past.\u201d\u201cEven the rankers are here.\u201dThe reporters were practically drooling. The conference today was like a buffet. No matter who they wrote about, they\u2019d be able to make up scoops.\u201cWhat do you think they\u2019re talking about?\u201d\u201cI dunno\u2026 Don\u2019t you think they\u2019ll be talking about something important though? Like global politics.\u201dUnlike the reporters, the players were cool; especially the Big 6 Team Leaders.\u201cParadise\u2026 I came to see Seo Jun-ho, but I found something even better,\u201d muttered Kiora. She was part of the mercenary Guild, Hallem.The Team Leader of the Dokkaebi Guild replied, \u201cWhy are you looking for Mr. Snake head?\u201d\u201cMr. Snake head? What are you saying, shorty?\u201dGong Juha wrinkled her nose at the insult. What made her more frustrated was that Kiora\u2019s body was much more mature than hers. She let out a long sigh, trying to contain her anger, then gave a big smile.\u201cAh, I\u2019m so~ close to Mr. Seo Jun-ho that I accidentally called him by his nickname. Unlike you, old woman, we\u2019re really close.\u201d\u201cPfft, seeing how he hasn\u2019t joined Dokkaebi yet, I can tell exactly what your relationship is like.\u201d\u201cWh-what are you saying? Personal relationships aren\u2019t related to affiliations.\u201d\u201cWanna bet? I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll be able to convince Seo Jun-ho to join Hallem today.\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s low!\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dThe four others watched the two fight as they always did. Even though they were from each of the Big 6 Guilds, they were known to meet quite frequently. Of course, this didn\u2019t mean that they went easy on each other when it came to competition and guild affairs.\u201cPfft, you\u2019re the one that set the bar that low.\u201d\u201cOh, really? I don\u2019t want to hear that from someone who\u2019s always making the news for getting into bar fights.\u201d\u201cPlease be mindful of your position and shut your mouths.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dUnlike what the reporters expected, they were childish and bickered a lot, but they knew when to be quiet.\u201cS-Specter-nim and President Shim Deok-gu will soon be entering. Please settle down now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe look in their eyes changed into anticipation. They were about to meet the living legend, Specter.Though, they\u2019d actually all come down to the 1st floor to meet Seo Jun-ho, not Specter.The Super Rookie broke the Cave of Trials record.And he did it with only a single D-rank skill\u2026If he can get another one, he\u2019ll grow exponentially.He was a perfect, S-grade gemstone. But when they came down, Specter had announced his own press conference, and they were no longer ordered to recruit Seo Jun-ho.Specter is admired all over the world.If he joins a guild\u2026Our influence will shoot up.They all had the same goal.I-I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ll be seeing Specter-nim in person!\u00a0Except, of course, Gong Juha.The door clicked open as the live broadcast started.

But considering how many people there were, the sound was relatively quiet.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe people were too busy watching Specter with their own eyes\u2014some were even moved to tears. He was a living legend, a myth, a hero.\u2026He looks exactly the same as he did in the past.So he\u2019s truly returned.Has he made a full recovery after a few months?I heard that he slayed dozens of fiends in Rome, and it seems that was true.Every step he took exuded confidence, and his powerful charisma was enough to fill the room. His presence alone was enough to completely capture the attention of the thousands of onlookers.\u201cWe will now begin the press conference.\u201d Shim Deok-gu took a seat next to Specter and spoke into the mic. Even in the past, he had acted as a proxy for press conferences.He used to just be a low-ranking employee in the Association\u2026But he\u2019s still acting as a proxy even though he\u2019s the President?I heard that they\u2019ve been friends since they were younger, but they must be closer than I thought.One might expect him to feel some level of envy or discomfort because of his own position, but Deok-gu didn\u2019t feel that way at all.\u201cWe will be taking a few questions.\u201d\u201cOnly a few? Isn\u2019t that unfair?\u201d\u201cThere are so many people\u2026\u201dThere were grumbles throughout the room, but ultimately, Shim Deok-gu and Specter were the ones in charge. Even as they complained, they started to raise their hands. Shim Deok-gu chose the first person he saw.\u201cHello. I am Lee Shinwoo, the editor-in-chief of Players magazine. I\u2019ve always admired you, and it\u2019s such an honor to\u2014\u201d\u201cYour question, if you please.\u201d Deok-gu cut in. The editor quickly shifted, afraid of losing the opportunity.\u201cMany people are curious about Specter-nim\u2019s health. Would I be right to assume that he\u2019s recovered to a certain extent, seeing how he\u2019s appeared in public?\u201dThe editor wanted Specter to answer, but it was Shim Deok-gu who did. \u201cI have yet to recover fully, but I\u2019m well enough to start warming up again.\u201dThe reporters started muttering to each other.\u201cOne of the fiends that Specter took care of a few hours ago was Torres Milo.\u201d\u201c\u2026What? Torres Milo? Is he the same person that I\u2019m thinking of?\u201d\u201cYeah, the one who used to be a player. His last recorded level was 75.\u201d\u201cWait, so Specter took out a level 75 player along with dozens of others?\u201d\u201cAnd he says that\u2019s just \u2018warming up\u2019\u2026\u201dEveryone here knew how amazing Specter was, but none of them had seen him in action with their own eyes. They only knew of his power from records and recordings from the past.\u201cNext question.\u201d\u201c\u2026Specter-nim had been in a frozen state for 25 years. Because of this, many conspiracy theories have been circulating. Can you prove that you are truly Specter?\u201d\u201cWow.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re crazy.\u201dEven though others criticized the question, they were curious about how Specter would respond. It was true that conspiracy theories about his return had become popular.\u201cAh, I\u2019m not sure what kind of evidence will suffice\u2026 Can you do it?\u201dAs Deok-gu turned to him, Specter unsheathed his sword, causing the reporter to flinch. It was a simple, standard Association sword, and he ignited it with jet-black magic. The look in the players\u2019 eyes changed.It\u2019s a sword aura. A perfect one, at that.You\u2019re telling me that\u2019s the magic of a person who hasn\u2019t fully recovered? At most, he should be around level 80\u2026Are the books incorrect? That\u2019s\u2026 That could stand a chance against Kim Woo-joong.Fuck! His magic loss rate seems lower than mine. What were his circuits like 25 years ago?The sword aura looked like it would kill without hesitation; strong as a fire but as tranquil as a lake. The jet-black energy flowed slowly and consistently, which meant that his magic was perfectly and completely under his control.The audience thought that his skills were rustier than they were 25 years ago. What would his sword aura have been like back then?The Big 6 team leaders swallowed hard. He was, without a doubt, the real Specter.\u201c\u2026Thank you for your response.\u201d The reporter bowed deeply and sat back down.Specter casually sheathed his sword, and the conference continued.\u201cSince Specter-nim has awoken from the ice, does that mean the four others might be able to awake as well?\u201d\u201c\u2026No one knows. I don\u2019t even know how I broke free from the ice.\u201d Shim Deok-gu gave the answer that Seo Jun-ho had told him to give. The fiends might try something if it became known that he could save his friends.They took a few more questions. Deok-gu answered the ones they had been expecting, and most of the issues were settled with them.\u201cNow, we will be receiving questions from the players,\u201d Shim Deok-gu announced. The players\u2019 hands shot up in the air. The first one that was chosen was Hallem Guild\u2019s Kiora.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you. My question is something of personal interest\u2026 Did you know that the Cave of Trials record was broken a while ago?\u201dShim Deok-gu turned to Seo Jun-ho and whispered in his ear, \u201cIt was a player named Seo Jun-ho.\u201d\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201dDeok-gu nodded. \u201cI am aware.\u201d\u201cThis is my question. Can you tell us your thoughts on the matter and your opinion on Seo Jun-ho?\u201d\u201cUm, I don\u2019t have much to say on that\u2026\u201d Shim Deok-gu looked at Seo Jun-ho. He couldn\u2019t see his expression because of the mask, but he calmly held out his hand. He was asking for the mic.Finally\u2026!This is the first time we\u2019re hearing Specter\u2019s voice in 25 years.Where\u2019s the volume button?The reporters quickly adjusted the EQ on their mics to get a clear recording.\u201c\u2026First of all.\u201dHis soothing voice resonated through the speakers. The audience had only ever heard his voice in old, broken-up recordings, and they were impressed.So this is what Specter\u2019s voice sounds like.He has a nice voice. He could be a voice actor.I bet he\u2019s handsome too.Seo Jun-ho paused, and the audience nodded in understanding.His feelings must be complicated.He\u2019s probably frustrated. He just woke up after a 25-year slumber, but his record\u2019s just been broken\u2026But Seo Jun-ho was thinking about something else. Mm, how to portray myself.It wouldn\u2019t be good to look down on himself, but too much praise would garner the attention of the fiends. He decided to keep it simple.\u201cI ran into him a few days ago at the Association.\u201d\u201cOohh\u2026\u201d\u201cThe top player of the past and the top player of the present\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is he gonna say?\u201d\u201cM-Mr. Snake head never mentioned that to me\u2026 Oh, right, we didn\u2019t exchange contacts.\u201dKiora pressed him, \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d\u201cIt made me think of a crouching stance.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cAs I thought, he thinks the same way.\u201d The players nodded. He was referring to a crouching start that track athletes went into before they started a race.So it\u2019s the beginning of a race\u2026Considering Seo Jun-ho\u2019s potential, he\u2019s going to grow exponentially if he ever gets his hands on a skill book.The reporters observed closely.He\u2019s complimenting his hubae so casually even though he broke his record\u2026Specter truly is as dignified as they say.If I were him, I wouldn\u2019t be able to praise him so easily.\u201cI am Benjamin of Labyrinth. Is there a guild that you are interested in joining?\u201d\u201cNo. However, I will be maintaining a close relationship with the Association from here on out.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThe reporters in the back were in an uproar, but the Big 6 players nodded coolly. If he wouldn\u2019t join their own guild, it was good enough that he didn\u2019t join anyone else\u2019s.\u201cI am Gong Juha of the Dokkaebi Guild. Hehe, I\u2019m a big fan\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026I see,\u201d Seo Jun-ho said begrudgingly. He knew all too well. Every time they met, she tried to preach to him with his own words.\u201cI\u2019ve been deeply interested in the Rome incident. Many people expected you to retire\u2026 Hehe, I was wondering if this meant that you\u2019re returning to the field. That is what I wanted to ask.\u201dIt was the question he\u2019d been waiting for.\u201cI wanted to retire,\u201d he said in a low voice. People listened closely, hearing the change in tone. Seo Jun-ho looked at Deok-gu as he spoke. \u201cWhen I awoke, my friend here told me something. He told me that the sacrifice my comrades and I made made the world a peaceful place. He told me that it was much better than before.\u201dThe audience nodded in agreement. The death rates in each country were reaching an all-time low, and the economy was booming.\u201cBut after witnessing the tragedy in Paradise, I no longer think that I can retire.\u201d He stood up from his seat. \u201cIn 24 years, close to six thousand children were kidnapped by fiends. Most of them died.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cThat many\u2026?\u201d\u201cSo no one knew about it?\u201d\u201cOf course not. No one cares about the 1st floor anymore.\u201d Seo Jun-ho couldn\u2019t mask the rage in his voice. \u201cMy comrades and I trusted the world. We were sure that the fiends would never return again. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe players were silent. They couldn\u2019t deny his accusations. It was true that once a player reached the 2nd floor, they stopped caring about the 1st floor.\u201cThis could\u2019ve been prevented. If players, guilds, and associations had joined hands, this would not have happened.\u201dBut they hadn\u2019t. They were all too focused on the new resources, land, and monsters on the 2nd floor.\u201cThe present is a result of the past and the cause of the future.\u201d\u2018This happened because of your complacency and greed.\u2019 This is what Specter was telling them.\u201cTherefore, I cannot retire.\u201dHow could he, when they had caused such a mess?The players\u2019 reactions were divided; they either bowed their heads in shame or narrowed their eyes in displeasure. But Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t care how they reacted. He would walk the path that he had chosen for himself.\u201cI have one more thing to say about this.\u201d He turned to the hundreds of cameras that were pointed at him. It was being live-streamed all around the world. The staff were worried that he\u2019d cause a scene, but Shim Deok-gu signalled them to stand by.This bastard\u2026 He\u2019d always been like that. Once he got started, he would say what he wanted to the end.\u201cThis is for the fiends.\u201dSpecter did not emanate any magic, but his presence alone was overwhelming. The people in the conference room swallowed nervously.\u201cI have returned.\u201dHe didn\u2019t shout or scream in anger, but his cold, quiet warning made people shiver.What? He should only be around level 80. I should definitely be higher\u2026I got chills\u2026 I almost unsheathed my sword without noticing.The poor fiends. They\u2019ve provoked Specter.The strongest player had returned after 25 years. At that moment, the reporters decided what tomorrow\u2019s front page would be.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Turn on season 2.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was his fault for introducing her to dramas yesterday. She had stayed up all night.Seo Jun-ho sighed as he spoke. \u201cHey, I\u2019ll show you how to use the remote, so do it yourself. Stop waking me up to change it.\u201d\u201cI do not know such things.\u201d She turned her head coyly and held out the remote. \u201cAnd prepare some tea. My throat is dry.\u201d\u201cAm I your servant?\u201d\u201cContractor, please~!\u201dThe only thing she learned from watching dramas was how to act all innocent.Seo Jun-ho turned on season 2 and headed to the kitchen. He poured soda into a large cup. \u201cHere, this is tea that modern humans drink.\u201d\u201cHmph, it does not have a refreshing aroma.\u201d She sipped her straw unknowingly, and Seo Jun-ho waited.\u201cEek!\u201d She stood up from the sofa and pointed at the cup. \u201cC-Contractor! The beverage has attacked me!\u201dSeo Jun-ho doubled over in laughter, and she sputtered. \u201cDo not laugh! It\u2019s the truth! My mouth is still stinging!\u201dHe grabbed the cup and gulped down the soda. \u201cThis is called a carbonated drink.\u201d\u201c\u2026Carbon?\u201d\u201cAigo, I meant to pour this for myself. I\u2019ll make you a new cup.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe Frost Queen finally realized she\u2019d been tricked and stomped across the sofa. She was still mad when he brought her favorite flower tea. \u201cI will not forget this humiliation\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to watch season 3?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hm.\u00a0Forgiveness is a virtue of a monarch. I shall forget this transgression.\u201d She turned away sheepishly and focused on her drama.Frost Queen. You can no longer order me around.\u00a0The weapons he could use against her increased every day. Feeling victorious, Seo Jun-ho stepped out of the house.\u201cLet\u2019s warm up a bit.\u201dThere were rumors going around the Association that said he was addicted to training, but he still headed to the hall.Thanks to the fiends at Paradise, I reached level 29, and my Magic stat has also increased quite a bit\u2026\u00a0He thought that he\u2019d be able to start using his old techniques again. He planned to test them out today. But as he entered the elevator, his Vita rang.\u201cHm?\u201d It was a message from Deok-gu.\u2013 Hey, Jun-ho, there are people who want to recruit you.\u2013 Can\u2019t you send them back?\u2013 They\u2019re bigwigs from the Big 6. If you refuse them outright, things will get noisy.Big 6\u2026\u00a0He understood why Deok-gu had gone through the trouble of sending a text message this time. If they were guests from the Big 6, he couldn\u2019t turn them back like he usually did.\u00a0And he said they were bigwigs.\u00a0That meant that it wasn\u2019t just one person.Seo Jun-ho recalled the faces he\u2019d seen at the press conference.\u00a0Gong Juha was definitely there.\u00a0There had been five others sitting next to her: the team leaders of each Big 6 Guild. Seo Jun-ho sensed that they had come to see him yesterday as well.Ah, so that\u2019s how they came here so quickly\u2026\u00a0He had told Deok-gu to announce the press conference only a few hours before it started. No matter how quickly the Big 6 moved, they wouldn\u2019t be able to send down someone from the 2nd floor within that time; it would take at least a day. That\u2019s why he\u2019d been surprised to see them at the press conference.He became even more sure of it after seeing the text.Their goal was never to see Specter.It was to see Seo Jun-ho. There was no doubt that they had come to recruit him after his stock price had soared.\u2013 This is an awkward situation.\u2013 Can\u2019t you just reject them all? What\u2019re they gonna do if I just say I like the Association?\u2013 Some of them are the type of people who\u2019ll break something if they can\u2019t have it.\u2013 Ah.He nodded. Those kinds of people had always existed. He thought for a second and sent a reply.\u2013 I have a good idea, so leave it to me. Get an empty meeting room and lead them there.\u2013 What? You\u2019re gonna meet them all at once? What the hell are you doing?\u2013 Doing what I\u2019m best at.Seo Jun-ho pressed \u2018send\u2019 and turned around, a smile on his face.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe silence was even heavier than the day before. Kiora had a venomous smile on her face.\u201cThat\u2019s weird. I requested a private meeting with Seo Jun-ho\u2026 Why are you guys here?\u201d She said, scanning the others. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have anything to worry about.\u201d\u201cWhat are you so confident about?\u201d Gong Juha cut in. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single member of Hallem that\u2019s received a noble title on the 2nd floor.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t care about titles or territory. That\u2019s why we have more members, connections, and information.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d Heo Junsu, the third team leader of Silent Moon, spoke as he adjusted his glasses. \u201cWe have a Count and two Barons. Do you really think a mere mercenary guild can defeat us in terms of connections and information? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201c\u2026What did you just say? \u2018A mere mercenary guild\u2019?\u201d Kiora stood up from her seat, charging her magic. Heo Junsu did the same. The clashing energy between them was about to explode.Clack.\u201cAigo~ Sorry I made you wait.\u201d Seo Jun-ho chuckled as he entered the room. He sat at the head of the table. \u201cGee, why are you two standing? Have a seat.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThey couldn\u2019t create a bad image in front of the person they were trying to recruit. Kiora and Heo Junsu cut off their magic and sat down. Seo Jun-ho looked over the six people and placed a voice recorder on the table.\u201cFirst of all, I want to record the contents of today\u2019s meeting. Is anyone against it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThey exchanged glances. Rankers disliked being recorded, and none of them would have allowed it had it been a private meeting. However, none of them wanted to be the first to speak up. If they\u2019d been given more time, they would have all collectively refused.\u201cAh, thank you for giving me permission.\u201dSilence meant compliance. Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t miss his chance. He was playing a dangerous game, but he turned on the voice recorder and started to speak.\u201cNow, then\u2026 Why have the honorable team leaders come to find me?\u201dKiora was the first to speak. She smiled seductively as she spoke.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s to recruit the man that broke the record in the Cave of Trials.\u201d\u201c\u2026Anyone else?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re all here for the same reason.\u201dThe team leaders nodded. Seo Jun-ho seemed embarrassed.\u201cUm, I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t do that. I have my own circumstances\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. It\u2019s because of the contract fee, right? The Hallem Guild is willing to pay for it.\u201d\u201cStop acting all big. Everyone here plans to do that.\u201d Heo Junsu snorted. Kiora smiled tightly.\u201cYou keep insulting me\u2026 I dare you to keep going.\u201d\u201cYou think I won\u2019t?\u201dThe air in the room soured again, but Seo Jun-ho banged on the table.\u201cExcuse me. If you two are gonna fight, please fight outside.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe other team leaders held back their laughter, but Kiora and Heo Junsu narrowed their eyes. Even if they were trying to recruit him, they were high rankers and team leaders of the Big 6. Seo Jun-ho was a mere newbie, and his arrogance hurt their pride.\u201cHaa, this is why I didn\u2019t want to negotiate with a newbie. They think they\u2019re all that.\u201d\u201c\u2026You should show me respect, as I have.\u201dSeo Jun-ho smirked in amusement. \u201cRespect? Do people consider dogfights respectful?\u201d\u201c\u2026Dogfights?\u00a0Ha. Are you saying that to me?\u201d\u201cMr. Seo Jun-ho. Do not keep crossing the line.\u201dKiora and Heo Junsu seemed ready to fight him, and the entire room was tense. Gong Juha kept fidgeting and signaling at him to stop. But Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t avoid their gaze and pointed firmly to the door.(TN: In Korea, it\u2019s considered rude to make eye contact with someone in a higher position than you.)\u201cYes. If you don\u2019t like it, please leave. I don\u2019t want to give this opportunity to rude people.\u201d\u201c\u2026Opportunity?\u201d Kiora\u2019s face darkened. They were the ones that were giving him the chance to join the Big 6. It was the biggest opportunity that a 1st floor player could get. \u201cI think you\u2019re misunderstanding something here. The one giving the opportunity isn\u2019t you\u2026\u201dThunk.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho silently placed a sheathed sword on the table. They looked at it, wondering what it was. But as they came to the realization, the team leaders\u2019 eyes widened.\u201cWait. That sword\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that the Demon-Beheading Sword?\u201dIt was the sword that Specter had brought to the Gate in Antarctica. Kwon Noya had spent a month hammering it out, and it was one of his most famous weapons.\u201cYou all participated in the press conference, so you should know what\u2019s going on\u2026 Specter-nim declared war on the fiends. He is gathering forces to join him when he goes up to the 2nd floor once he recovers completely. He has appointed me as a scout to find such people.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dTheir eyes popped. Fighting with Specter was the greatest honor one could receive. Not only that, his targets were fiends, a universal representation of evil. They would be fighting \u201cfor the sake of justice\u201d. The team leaders quickly did the calculations in their heads.I did get the feeling that Specter thought highly of Seo Jun-ho.I see\u2026 They have a close enough relationship that Specter felt comfortable appointing him as a scout.When Specter defeats the fiends, perhaps he\u2019ll mention that our guild helped him\u2026?The effect will be incomparable. The amount of exposure won\u2019t even compare to the promotions and advertisements we spend astronomical amounts on.In this day and age, Specter was the best guaranteed ticket to success. The six team leaders knew that they couldn\u2019t miss the opportunity. Kiora and Heo Junsu immediately sat down.\u201cAhaha, I\u2019m sorry for showing you something unseemly.\u201d\u201cMy apologies. This will not happen again.\u201dThey trembled in their seats. If they had missed the opportunity to work with Specter because of the heat of the moment, they\u2019d never hear the end of it from their guilds. They swallowed hard.It wasn\u2019t just the two of them, though. All six team leaders sat on edge. They were no longer the ones in control of the board.\u201cNow, then\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho put on airs as he spoke. \u201cI will tell you Specter-nim\u2019s four terms.\u201dThis was the thing he was best at: power tripping.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of the Frozen PlayerCH 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayProposal (2)\u201cThere are only three conditions.\u201dThe six team leaders listened closely.\u201cFirst. The representative will be affiliated with the Association so as not to be biased toward any particular Guild.\u201cSecond, the participating guilds will be dispatched to areas on the 2nd floor where they have a high amount of influence and are able to gather an adequate amount of information.\u201cThird, the participating guilds will hand over the full extent of information that Specter requests without concealing anything.\u201dThose were the conditions for the guilds. The last term was the reward for being compliant.\u201cOnce Specter receives the information that he requests, he will publicly acknowledge the affiliated guilds\u2019 contribution.\u201dThe team leaders fell deep into thought as they listened.The contract isn\u2019t complicated.Specter is saying that he will give us legitimacy\u2026\u2026In exchange for information.He\u2019s too good at this. He\u2019s experienced.They were silent. They had finally realized what Specter was doing. In last night\u2019s press conference, he\u2019d heavily criticized the players and guilds. It had only been a day, but most people already agreed with him.People are mad at the guilds for keeping their bellies full instead of keeping the fiends in check.Once a controversy like this begins, it goes on for a while.And the Big 6 will be affected the most as a symbol of the guild.He planted the poison and is now offering us the antidote\u2026 In the end, he\u2019s the one that profits the most.His perfect plan gave them goosebumps. If one guild refused his offer, they would be the only one with a negative image. But with their constant state of competition, they wouldn\u2019t let that happen.Damn. I thought Specter was naive like Kim Woo-joong\u2026He\u2019s good at this. Considering his level of skill and influence\u2026 He\u2019s dangerous.The team leaders all made the same decision.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t think that this is something that we can decide on our own.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll need to discuss this with the Guildmaster.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded. This wasn\u2019t something that a mere team leader could sign on. \u201cI look forward to your responses. I have an appointment, so I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201dThe team leaders could do nothing but watch as he casually strutted out of the conference room. When he left, Heo Junsu let out a long sigh.\u201cWe\u2019ve walked right into the dragon\u2019s den.\u201d\u201cAs long as Specter keeps Seo Jun-ho has his representative, no one can recruit him.\u201d\u201c\u2026Does that mean Seo Jun-ho has as much potential as one of the Five Heroes?\u201d\u201cWith the way things are unfolding, it\u2019s possible.\u201d\u201cWe already know that Specter-nim has a good eye for people.\u201d\u201cThe gunslinger, you mean?\u201dIt was a famous story. Gilbert Green had only D-rank skills*. While others brushed him aside, Specter was the only one who had seen his potential. This is why Seo Jun-ho had piqued their interest even more.(TN: It may be a single skill. It\u2019s not clarified.)\u201cI want him even more now, knowing that Specter has acknowledged him\u2026\u201d Kiora muttered, her eyes sparkling. Gong Juha snorted.\u201cThere\u2019s no use talking like that. He\u2019s rejected all of us.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNo one could deny that.* * *\u201cMr. Snake head!\u201d\u201cMr. Snake heeaad!\u201dSeo Jun-ho stopped and turned around.

Didn\u2019t we agree to meet on the 2nd floor?\u201d\u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d accomplish something so amazing. I bet you\u2019ve been getting a lot of love calls from guilds.\u201d\u201cWell, yes.\u201d As soon as the news of him breaking the Cave of Trials\u2019 records spread, he\u2019d started receiving tons of calls.I didn\u2019t even know there were that many guilds.\u00a0Thanks to that, Cha Si-eun had gotten a lot busier. He\u2019d instructed her to reject all the offers from guilds that weren\u2019t part of the Big 6.\u201cI\u2019ve been quite busy lately because of it.\u201d\u201cWow, I see.\u201d Gong Juha stared at him expectantly.\u201cIf you\u2019re expecting special treatment because of our personal relationship\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, no! It\u2019s not like that! I wouldn\u2019t want it even if you offered!\u201d She quickly shook her head and cleared her throat loudly. \u201c\u2026I was just wondering if you were close to Specter-nim.\u201d\u201cClose? It\u2019s just a business relationship.\u201d\u201cHave you met him in person?\u201d\u201cYou saw him yesterday, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cNot like that. I\u2019m asking if you\u2019ve met him privately.\u201dSeo Jun-ho thought for a moment. He saw him every day in the mirror when he brushed his teeth and washed his face, so he supposed he did see him a lot.\u201cYes, I have.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d She reached into her pocket and pulled out a book. \u201cBy any chance, can you get his autograph for me the next time you see him?\u201d She looked like an excited puppy waving its tail. He couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll ask him\u2026\u201d\u201cReally?! Okay!\u201d Her face brightened. \u201cPlease tell him to write \u2018To my precious fan Juha\u2019. With a heart, if possible.\u201d\u201cDo you think he\u2019d do something so cringey?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re the one that\u2019s writing it! But if Specter-nim doesn\u2019t want to, it can\u2019t be helped\u2026\u201d She wilted a bit.Seo Jun-ho scratched his head. \u201cI\u2019ll ask. He\u2026 Well, I suppose it will depend on how he feels that day.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m counting on you.\u201d With her mission accomplished, she started to study Seo Jun-ho. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown a scary amount in the last two months, Mr. Snake head.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m mortified that I tried to recruit you that early.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s a little too early to say that\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a compliment. You haven\u2019t forgotten our bet, have you?\u201d\u201cI still have four months left. I\u2019ll go up to the 2nd floor within that time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you a present in exchange for the autograph then.\u201d She waved and started down the opposite direction of the hallway. \u201cI\u2019m counting on you for the autograph! Tell him I\u2019ll make it my family heirloom!\u201d\u201c\u2026You like him that much?\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked down at the book that she\u2019d given him and chuckled.[Great Figures of Korea \u2013 Specter]\u201cShe really is obsessed.\u201dThe book had been published 26 years ago when he\u2019d been active as Specter.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Seo Jun-ho arrived at the training room and changed into light workout clothes. Before he began, he checked his status window as he stretched.[Seo Jun-ho]Level: 29Title: The One Who Opens Spring, (2 more)Strength: 96 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Stamina: 112Agility: 100\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Magic: 143Including Helper of Ascension and Limit Breaker, he had a total of three titles. The status window had shortened it to make it easy to read.And if I equip Black Armor on top of all this\u2026\u00a0His stats would be insanely high. He even wondered if he\u2019d match the stats from when he was level 60.But even if it gets that high\u2026\u00a0He wouldn\u2019t be the unstoppable force he was in the past.This was just the beginning.Once he reached the 2nd floor, Seo Jun-ho would truly become a rookie. That was why he was using his fame to use the Big 6\u2019s resources to gather information.I\u2019m an investment for the Association, but we\u2019ll need time to increase their influence and ability to gather information.It was already publicly known that humanity had dominated up to the 2nd floor. But that didn\u2019t mean that every nook and cranny had been explored.I heard that there are a lot of uncovered areas.And the players who\u2019d been to the 3rd floor were a small minority. Just as the 2nd floor required you to reach level 30, the 3rd floor had its own requirements.Until the Association creates a better information network, I\u2019ll use the Big 6 to help them grow.\u00a0He didn\u2019t feel guilty for using them. It\u2019s not like he was using them for free, and he hadn\u2019t been the one to give them a bad image.\u201cNow, then\u2026\u201d He pulled on a glove that was in the training room. It was the same item he\u2019d used while taking the player license test, and it let him touch holograms. \u201cIs this how you use it?\u201dHe connected to the training room\u2019s system and pressed a few buttons. A human-shaped sandbag hologram appeared in the center of the room.\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho landed a straight punch without magic. He heard the sound of the impact, and the sandbag turned red. Words appeared to its left.[Congratulations! 9,523 points!][An outstanding destructive force!!]\u201cThis reminds me of the punch machines they used to have in old arcades.\u201dHe slowly unraveled his magic, his arms overflowing with power.\u201cHup!\u201dHis fist struck the head again with a violent force.\u00a0Boom!\u00a0The sound was much louder than before, and the numbers rose.[Congratulations! 101,518 points!][A score that\u2019s unattainable without magic! You\u2019re a player, aren\u2019t you?]\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho let his magic disperse as he saw the score. The punch was over ten times more destructive than before. This was the technique he\u2019d been using this whole time. He would charge his strikes with magic at certain moments. It allocated magic to a very fine degree, so it was a magic-efficient technique. He\u2019d used it when he hadn\u2019t had a lot of magic as Specter.But there\u2019s a downside to it.There was a slight delay when he summoned his magic, and it wasn\u2019t as powerful.It\u2019s a given. I made the technique to optimize the use of my limited magic.\u00a0So he\u2019d created another technique to make up for its weaknesses.\u00a0Skaya helped me a lot with it.They\u2019d put their heads together. If you lacked control, focus, or mental willpower, it was a useless skill.Booster.His circuits started to burn like wildfire, circulating his body at high speed.One lap, two, three\u2026His magic didn\u2019t know how to stop. It kept going.\u201cKeuk\u2026\u201d\u00a0Seo Jun-ho groaned. His body temperature rose, and he started to drip cold sweat. His magic was circulating thirteen times faster than usual. This was why he needed fine control, focus, and mental willpower.The only downside to this skill is that it consumes a lot of magic\u2026\u00a0And it made you hot. If it weren\u2019t for those two things, it would\u2019ve been a flawless support skill. It served a single purpose: to strengthen the entire body.When Seo Jun-ho used this technique, he became a superhuman. No enemy had ever defeated him in this state.\u201cWell, it\u2019s been 25 years since then, so there are probably a lot of people now who use a similar technique.\u201dHis body overflowed with power. Seo Jun-ho tapped on the settings and summoned a full-body mirror. Vigor spilled from his body, and his eyes sparkled like stars.I\u2019ll have to be careful when using this.\u00a0The person in the mirror was no longer the simpleminded Seo Jun-ho he\u2019d been masquerading as. He was a dangerous, powerful man.Seo Jun-ho turned to the hologram sandbag. \u201cI wonder how high the score will be this time.\u201dHis body flew forward like a ray of light, and his fist made the head explode. The entire quality of the sound was different. It was like the roar of a bomb.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho\u2019s lip curled as he read the words that appeared.[Congratulations! 215,748 points!][Are you a ranker in the Frontier?]In his Booster state, the output of magic shot up. So even if he used the same amount of magic, the destructive force would be twice as powerful.Of course, the aftermath was also strong.\u201cAck, I won\u2019t be able to use this for long.\u201d Seo Jun-ho quickly released his magic before his body became even hotter. In a moment\u2019s notice, his body had become as hot as a computer that had been on for a long time.I think it\u2019ll take about\u2026 one week to tame this technique.\u201cIf I can pull in the reins on Booster, I\u2019ll go to the Winter Castle.\u201dAnd if things went as expected, it would be the last Gate he would clear on the 1st floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was watching the timer. It counted down from ten until it read \u2018Start\u2019. An overwhelming force started to radiate from his body.It had been a week since he started, and he could now activate Booster in the blink of an eye.Smash!\u00a0His foot connected with the abdomen of a sandbag on the opposite side of the room.Let\u2019s begin with this\u2026They started to fire back. Seo Jun-ho spun around and crouched down. Dozens of lasers grazed past his head, shot by the hologram sandbags.If I stay still for too long, my circuits will get clogged.He quickly kicked off the wall, dodging the volley of lasers as he tore off the heads of two sandbags with each hand.AI technology has gotten a lot more advanced.\u00a0Every time he repeated the drill, the sandbags got smarter.\u201cPlayers these days don\u2019t know how lucky they are. It\u2019s so much easier to train. Back in my day\u2014\u201d\u201cContractor! Stop talking like an old man and concentrate!\u201d\u201c\u2026I know,\u201d he grumbled. His body started to get hotter. He shot across the training room like a ray of light.The sandbags were set to level 100. They were designed for 2nd floor players, but they couldn\u2019t land a scratch on Seo Jun-ho. The sound of exploding sandbags filled the room.\u201cKeuk\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face was more serious than usual as he directed his body.When I use Booster, I really have to focus.\u00a0It was a support spell that strengthened his entire body at the same time. If he got distracted for even a moment, his body would become a bullet in the wall. Booster\u2019s special trait was its extreme strength and speed that not even the user could quite control.Just because your body gets faster doesn\u2019t mean your brain does.\u00a0Those who used Booster had to be smart. If you thought about what you were going to do after you flung your body forward, it would be too late.Let\u2019s see\u2026\u00a0Dozens of sandbags were shooting lasers at him, firing in a straight line.\u00a0It would be best to start over there.He made the decision in a split second. Seo Jun-ho\u2019s body radiated heat like a steam engine. As he leapt off the ground, the world around him stretched like taffy. It was like he was looking out the window of a fast-driving car.It\u2019s become a familiar sight.\u00a0After all, he\u2019d trained in this room for a week. He also had all the memories and experience of using this technique when he was Specter.Boom!It was useless to simply be fast. Seo Jun-ho used the speed to destroy the sandbags. Just as the burning heat started to permeate through the room, it was over.\u201cPhew.\u201d He looked down at the hundredth sandbag, which he had split in half. \u201cThat took around 28 seconds\u2026 Frost, what\u2019s my temperature?\u201d\u201cWait a moment.\u201d She turned the device to face Seo Jun-ho. It was a little smaller than her body.Beep\u2014\u201c38.9 degrees\u2026 That is dangerous.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201d Seo Jun-ho clicked his tongue. He let the magic running around his circuits disperse and collapsed to the ground.Sizzle.\u00a0As he covered his body with ice, his body temperature started to fall.\u201cI have enough magic, but my body can\u2019t handle it.\u201d His current Magic stat was 143. It was at the same level as a 2nd floor player\u2019s. The only problem was the way Booster overheated his body.The human body is designed to function best at 37.5 degrees or less.\u00a0It couldn\u2019t fall below 36 or go above 37.5. If it went even slightly above or below, it would break.\u201cUgh.\u00a0Even players can\u2019t do anything about the way they are built.\u201dThe longer he used Booster, the hotter his body got. And once it reached 39.5 degrees, his brain would start to overload.\u201cIf I can just figure this out, I could use Booster for five minutes, not thirty seconds\u2026\u201d\u201cThat is why I gave you a hint. I told you to use the Frost skill to lower the temperature of your body.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already tried it a few times,\u201d Seo Jun-ho complained. Booster was already a hard enough skill when he tried to balance its three components. \u201cIf I add the Frost skill to the mix, I\u2019ll consume more magic, and the technique will become more complicated. It\u2019s not very efficient either.\u201dHe\u2019d already experimented a few times, but they were all failures. He\u2019d tried using the Frost skill to cover his body in ice, but it didn\u2019t help with the heat.\u201cThe heat it generates is no joke. Even if I cover myself in ice, it all melts quickly.\u201d It would also lower his focus and fine magic control, so he\u2019d run himself into walls. \u201cI\u2019ll need a few months at the very least if I want to incorporate it into real combat.\u201d\u201cHm.\u00a0Is that what you believe?\u201d she said cheekily. Seo Jun-ho frowned.\u201c\u2026You know something, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cOf course, but I will not tell you.\u201d She was always stubborn about these things. \u201cIndeed, I expect you to be able to master this yourself as my Contractor.\u201d\u201c\u2026I won\u2019t ask. You\u2019re too much.\u201d Seo Jun-ho sighed.\u00a0There\u2019s nothing I can do. Even when I was Specter, I couldn\u2019t use it for longer than ten minutes\u2026He\u2019d used artifacts and the like to keep his body temperature low, but they had strict restrictions, so he couldn\u2019t use them at the moment.\u201cDid you finish your drama?\u201d\u201cI watched everything up to season 8. I will find a new drama to watch.\u201d\u201cFirst, we need to get to work.\u201dThe week of training ended after he achieved his goal. He\u2019d honed Booster to a point where he could use it in real battle. If he trained any longer, it would only dull his instincts. Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t linger and sent a text to Cha Si-eun.\u2013 Secretary Cha, please find a teleporter who\u2019s on duty.\u2013 A teleporter? Are you going somewhere?\u2013 Yes.\u2013 Where are you going, and when? I\u2019ll look into it.\u2013 I\u2019m going to Antarctica tomorrow.Only two months after he cleared the Wild Forest, he was about to enter another Gate.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u201cBrrr\u2026\u00a0I-it\u2019s cold.\u201d The teleporter had foolishly decided to wear only a single coat. His entire body trembled, and white vapor came out of his mouth as he spoke.\u201cWhat did I say? I told you you\u2019d need a winter jacket.\u201d\u201cI-I-I\u2019m only here to transport you, so I\u2019ll be leaving\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t even breathe properly because his lungs would sting from the cold. \u201cTh-Then, Player Seo Jun-ho\u2026 I wish you luck in y-your conquest\u2026\u201d\u201cI get it, so go back already. You\u2019ll get sick.\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked at him pitifully and waved at him to leave. The teleporter didn\u2019t look back as he activated his magic and disappeared.\u201cHe is a weak man. This is the perfect weather to have a picnic.\u201d\u201cSorry, but there\u2019s no one in their right mind on Earth who\u2019d go for a picnic in this weather.\u201d Seo Jun-ho tightly zipped up his bulky down jacket. He had even put on a mask and goggles. He\u2019d developed a little resistance to the cold thanks to his Frost skill, but Antarctica\u2019s climate couldn\u2019t be handled with just a small amount. On the other hand, the Frost Queen was looking around like she\u2019d returned to her homeland.\u201cOver there! That is where the Gate is.\u201d Just as she said, there was a blue portal on a snowy hill in the vast whiteness. Seo Jun-ho started to walk over.\u201cAt least there\u2019s one good thing that comes out of the cold,\u201d he muttered. He liked that there weren\u2019t any annoying reporters in front of the Gate.\u201cGate information.\u201d\u27eaWinter Castle\u27ebEntry Requirements: Level 80 and belowParty Cap: 30 peopleClear Conditions: Defeat the Lord of the Winter CastleDifficulty: Brutal\u201cSo this is one of those three Uncleared Gates.\u201dEvery 1st and 2nd floor player had failed to clear the Gate, and it had been granted a single star.\u201cContractor. Do you need time to prepare yourself?\u201d\u201cNah. I did that when I washed my face this morning.\u201d Seo Jun-ho stepped into the Gate without hesitation. No one was there to watch the world-famous rookie step into the snowy Gate.Wooooshhh!\u00a0As soon as he entered, his face stung from the bitter cold.\u201c\u2026It is a pleasant northern wind.\u201d\u201cWhat? It blows from the north?\u201d Seo Jun-ho squinted and tightened his collar. The powerful wind blew through the gaps in his jacket. \u201cUgh, it\u2019s cold. Still, I chose well.\u201dThe reason why this was the best choice as his final Gate on the 1st floor was because of Booster. In the bitter cold, he\u2019d be able to use the skill for at least a few seconds longer.\u201cThe Clear Condition is to defeat the Lord of the Castle\u2026 but where\u2019s the castle?\u201dThe blizzard made the entire world white, limiting his vision, with the snow coming up to his knees.\u201c\u2026Go northwest,\u201d the Frost Queen muttered, sitting on his shoulder. Seo Jun-ho glanced at her.What\u2019s with her?\u00a0Her voice was softer than usual. Even before they\u2019d entered the Gate, she had suddenly gotten quiet. She didn\u2019t talk much, so Seo Jun-ho reached the castle in no time. It only took him thirty minutes to walk where she was pointing. As he got close, the blizzard weakened, and he saw something big and hazy behind it.\u201cI think I see something.\u201d As he took one more step forward, the blizzard disappeared without a trace.\u201cHuh?\u201d He turned around, surprised, but the blizzard was still blowing a single step behind him. \u201cWow, is this a trap? That\u2019s really cool.\u201dHowever, he still couldn\u2019t see the fortress before him very well. It blended in with the white of the snowdrifts. The Frost Queen looked up at the castle and muttered something to herself.\u201c\u2026It really is the Winter Castle,\u201d she said faintly. Seo Jun-ho finally decided to ask.\u201cHey\u2026 Do you know where we are?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d She didn\u2019t deny it. In fact, she looked proud as she straightened her shoulders. \u201cBecause this is the country that I used to rule, the Ice Kingdom Niflheim.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t know, so I cannot answer!\u201d She crossed her arms, seeming like she didn\u2019t want to talk.\u201cWell, fine. Say you don\u2019t know why this is here.

She didn\u2019t come back until she made him promise not to say such cheesy things. She seemed to be considering something before she spoke again.\u201c\u202627,000.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAs far as I remember, the population of the Winter Castle is 27,000.\u201d\u201cWhat?! That much?\u201d\u201cWhy are you so surprised? I think it\u2019s quite obvious that a castle of that size would have that many people.\u201d\u201cI mean, you\u2019re not wrong, but\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho\u2019s expression changed as he looked up at the gigantic Winter Castle. He had never been to a Gate where the enemies numbered over ten thousand.\u201cThat\u2019s insane. How am I supposed to defeat so many enemies by myself\u2026\u201d\u201cContractor, listen to the end. Do you remember the Gate I created?\u201d she asked.\u201cThe Queen\u2019s Nest? I won\u2019t forget it for the rest of my life.\u201d It had been the most difficult Gate he\u2019d ever conquered.\u201cI originally intended to bring all the knights under my command.\u201d But she had failed to do so.\u201c\u2026All your knights? Then, the ones we fought weren\u2019t all of your forces?\u201d\u201cThey were but a small fraction. Considering what happened in the past, I wonder if this place is of a similar circumstance.\u201d\u201cSo, the Winter Castle might have less forces than we expect?\u201d\u201cYes. Look, the gates are already open.\u201dCastle gates were essential to protect the people inside. If there were supposed to be as many people as she claimed, they wouldn\u2019t have left it open.\u201c\u2026So there will only be the lord and his guards?\u201d\u201cIt is impossible to tell. Lord Kis may be the only one inside.\u201d\u201cLord Kis? Who\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cKis Bremen. A loyal knight of mine, and the lord of the Winter Castle.\u201d\u201cWhat are his abilities?\u201d\u201cSwordplay. The people called him the Sword of the Empire. He is the most outstanding knight that I have ever known.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026 He\u2019s that strong?\u201d Seo Jun-ho was surprised. She\u2019d never praised anyone so highly before. \u201cHow do I compare to him?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d The Frost Queen looked him up and down, which made him feel uncomfortable. She then held up a finger.\u201cWhat\u2019s with that? You\u2019re not saying that I can only last for an hour, are you?\u201dShe shook her head.\u201c\u2026What, ten minutes, then? One minute?\u201dShe shook her head again. \u201cHe will be able to rip you apart with a single finger. My knight is powerful.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hey, that means he\u2019s stronger than you.\u201d\u201cHow many times must I tell you? I was in an extremely weakened state.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah. I guess I don\u2019t need to worry much, then. Kis will be weakened too, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The Frost Queen nodded slowly. She couldn\u2019t deny it. \u201cWe can only hope that you are right.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201dSeo Jun-ho started to trudge through the knee-deep snow toward the open gates.* * *The first thing they saw when they entered the castle was the knights\u2019 quarters.\u201cKnights tend to reside near the castle walls.\u201d\u201cSo that means the civilians live on the inside.\u201dHe didn\u2019t let his guard down, but there was no one around. As they walked for a long while, large estates and buildings filled their sight. They were reminiscent of Medieval French and English architecture.But there was not a single person in sight. Everywhere they turned, they were only met with a cold wind.\u201c\u2026It feels like a tomb,\u201d the Frost Queen muttered. The village, no, the Winter Castle was completely desolate.\u201cIt\u2019s different from what you remember, right?\u201d\u201cOf course. Though I\u2019ve only come here twice\u2026\u201d She smiled bitterly as she looked around. \u201cChildren used to play around that frozen fountain. The wives would sit by them and watch their children with satisfaction.\u201cThat restaurant was always filled with people, day and night. The chef was so skilled that even I have tried it. He was very talented.\u201cOver there! Let\u2019s go over there. The large square was a theater. Wandering minstrels would flock here like it was the northern city and tell stories all day and night.\u201dSeo Jun-ho glanced down at the Frost Queen. She seemed excited as she explained each area.It\u2019s my first time seeing her like this. She\u2019s like a kid.Come to think of it, how old was she?As soon as the question popped into mind, she suddenly stopped, her hand dropping to her side.\u201c\u2026Well, they are all but memories now.\u201d She seemed to be pulled back into reality as she looked around the dead city.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d As soon as he expressed his concern, her voice perked up as if she\u2019d never been sad.\u201cContractor, you worry too much. I am the queen of the cold who rules over everything. Do you think I would be sullen because of a few old memories?\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s exactly how it looks.\u201d\u201cIt is not!\u201d She poked at Seo Jun-ho\u2019s cheeks.\u201cShould we go inside that restaurant? We might be able to find some information about the castle.\u201d\u201cOh? That\u2019s a good proposition.\u201dAs any good player would, Seo Jun-ho set out to gather information first. But when they entered the restaurant, their faces fell.\u201c\u2026What is this?\u201dIt was like an unfinished game; it looked like a quaint building from the outside, but there was nothing inside. When they checked the other buildings, they were all the same way.\u201cGeez, we couldn\u2019t find a single thing.\u201d\u201cIt seems that it will be hard to find information.\u201dHe expected her to be disappointed, but she was actually smiling when she turned to him.\u201cStill, thank you. After you went through all that for me, I feel a little better.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s all useful for clearing the Gate. Can I ask you something in return?\u201d\u201cAsk me anything you wish.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering since before; how old are you?\u201dShe answered with a fist to his face.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Seo Jun-ho looked around the inside of the Winter Castle. The ceilings were high, and statues of knights were lined up down the grand hall. A red carpet was rolled out from the entrance to the end.\u201cIt looks like a throne room. Isn\u2019t red supposed to be the color for a king?\u201d\u201cIt differs with each country. In our land, white is the color of a monarch.\u201dSeo Jun-ho stepped onto the red carpet. There was a thin layer of ice on top of it.\u201cThis is called the Knight\u2019s Road.\u201d\u201cKnight\u2019s Road?\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cThe Winter Castle was managed by the strongest knight of the empire, Kis. It was somewhat of a shrine for the knights. Those who dreamed of becoming a knight\u2014man or woman\u2014would dream of coming to this place. They believed that if you walked until the end of this path, you would become a great knight.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s not like anyone can walk in here anyways.\u201d\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just a simple rumor.\u201d She looked at the door at the end as she spoke. \u201cThose who became a knight would enter the Winter Castle for a test.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of test?\u201d\u201cThey say it\u2019s proof of knighthood. The large door at the end opens to a large tourney hall where a hundred other knights are waiting. They proved themselves by dueling all of them.\u201d\u201cWhy are you telling me that\u00a0now?\u201d He realized that this was how the Gate would progress.\u201cDon\u2019t be mad! Is it not enough that I told you before you entered?\u201d\u201c\u2026Shut up.\u201d Seo Jun-ho had nothing to say. He stepped up to the large door and stared at it long and hard. \u201cA hundred knights\u2026 They should be nerfed too, right?\u201d\u201cI do not know. However, the rule dictates that the duels are done one at a time. No one can disturb the holy battle.\u201d\u201cOne by one\u2026\u201dThere was no Gate that he couldn\u2019t conquer; that had been Seo Jun-ho\u2019s motto when he was Specter.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do before I enter, I suppose. I just need to defeat a hundred knights, right?\u201d\u201cThe knights of the Winter Castle and their captain. After you defeat them all, there will be one person left.\u201d\u201cOkay, so counting Sir Kissyface, that\u2019s a hundred and one.\u201dIt was the first time he was challenging a Gate with this kind of format, but he felt a little calmer after learning the rules. He didn\u2019t hesitate as he opened the door.Creak.\u00a0The heavy doors opened slowly.It\u2019s big.Even though the door was within the castle, it opened to the outside. The cold wind howled across the large hall, where a hundred knights stood like statues. Frozen weapons and corpses surrounded them in piles.Seo Jun-ho noticed the ice that covered them. \u201cAre they alive?\u201d\u201cI do not know. I don\u2019t sense any life force from them.\u201dAt that moment, there was a loud thud as the door closed behind him. The knights started to move in a dignified fashion, dusting the ice off their shoulders. Their eyes shone blue underneath their helmets.Shing! Clang!\u00a0As they unsheathed their weapons, the sound of metal against metal filled the hall. Seo Jun-ho sensed danger from their sharp bloodlust.\u201c\u2026But why aren\u2019t they attacking?\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered as he looked at them. He\u2019d unsheathed Black Dragon Fang as well. As if to answer, a fully armed knight spoke from the stage.\u2013\u00a0\u201cSir Horun Simus orders you. Stranger, state your business in this place.\u201d\u201cI came here to\u2014\u201d He was about to say he was here to kill Kis Bremen, but the Frost Queen yelped, \u201cContractor! Proof of knighthood! Say that you came here to prove your knighthood!\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d he asked, confused.She tugged at his collar. \u201cYou have nothing to lose. Just do as I say.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cI will ask you once more. State your business. If you do not answer, I will take you for an intruder.\u201dSeo Jun-ho\u2019s face was doubtful, but he answered anyway. \u201c\u2026I came here to prove my knighthood.\u201dAs she\u2019d said, he had nothing to lose.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Horun addressed him again.\u2013\u00a0\u201cWandering Knight, step up to the ring and draw your sword.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe knights parted like the Red Sea, creating a path for him. Seo Jun-ho slowly walked down, keeping his guard up.\u2013\u00a0\u201cOne hundred knights will test the honor of your sword. The match will continue until one side lowers their sword and admits defeat.\u201dHorun finished his explanation and called for another knight, who then stepped up to the stage.\u2013\u00a0\u201cI am Sir Phil.\u201d\u00a0He stated his name calmly and raised his sword. Seo Jun-ho watched this unfold and whispered to the Frost Queen.\u201c\u2026Hey, is the proof of knighthood always this intense from the start?\u201d\u201cIt is not exactly an elegant endeavor. It is not fitting to my tastes\u2026\u201d She smiled. \u201cBut is this not the way of the knights?\u201dKnights were passionate people who preferred to speak with their sword. Seo Jun-ho started to feel his heart pound and gripped his sword, his lip curling up.\u201c\u2026Sounds fun. So this is how the knights do it.\u201d He didn\u2019t hate the way they did things.\u2013\u00a0\u201cOra!\u201d\u00a0As Phil exclaimed, Seo Jun-ho dashed forward. He closed the wide distance in the blink of an eye and swung his jet-black sword.Claaang!\u00a0Phil blocked his strike.He\u2019s strong.\u00a0He was a sturdy knight\u2014like the walls of the Winter Castle\u2014but defense wasn\u2019t his only strong suit.\u2013\u00a0\u201cHup!\u201d\u00a0He swung against him with great force, and Seo Jun-ho was pushed eight steps back. Phil closed in much faster than Seo Jun-ho could retreat.He\u2019s as big as a boulder, but he\u2019s as fast as I am?\u00a0He grinned and activated his magic.\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me there are a hundred other guys as fun as this one?\u201dIt was the perfect Gate to end his journey on the 1st floor. The Frost Queen watched excitedly and smiled.\u201cYou knights\u2026\u201d She couldn\u2019t understand them.* * *The seventh knight, Rabona, let out a sharp breath as she lowered her sword. There was a large, jagged cut through her helmet and armor; Black Dragon Fang had ripped them apart.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026I admit defeat.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cRabona has been defeated! The Wandering Knight has won once again!\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cWho will defeat that arrogant knight?\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cI will challenge him once again!\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cNo, I will\u2026!\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve already been defeated. Step aside!\u201dEvery time Seo Jun-ho defeated a knight, the frozen tourney hall burned hotter. Their sense of competition grew fiercer, and they would quarrel over who got to go next; they wanted to scratch the itch as soon as possible.\u201c\u2026Phew.\u201d Seo Jun-ho took out a water bottle from his inventory and gulped it down. Every knight he had faced so far was strong.If they were players, they\u2019d all be at least level 100.\u00a0They didn\u2019t have the superpowers that players did, but Seo Jun-ho felt that they were more dangerous every time they crossed swords.\u00a0Their bodies are trained, and they have magic supports\u2026 When it comes to basic weaponry skills, they\u2019re several paces ahead of me.The only reason he\u2019d been able to win so far was because of Watchguard of Darkness. If he didn\u2019t have it, he would never have been able to cut through their sword auras.I never knew that sword auras had such diverse forms.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho and every other player could only use a single kind of sword aura; it came in the form of a powerful magic force that covered the blade. When people thought of a sword aura, they usually pictured something akin to a wildfire, but the knights\u2019 sword auras were completely different.How can there be a sword aura like that?\u00a0The essence of the technique was similar, but their manifestations were free and unrestricted. One knight had a sword aura that was sharp like a thorn, while another had created one that was long like a spear.The essence is similar\u2026 but they\u2019re stronger than mine.\u00a0Even after seven duels, he still hadn\u2019t found the reason why.So, he\u2019d turned to the Frost Queen and asked if there was a Player System in Niflheim.\u201cWhat? Why would we have such a thing?\u201d\u201cSo you don\u2019t have stats or anything like that?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201dUnlike players, they couldn\u2019t raise their levels or stats, which meant that there was only one way for them to get stronger.\u201cThen that means that they spend their whole life practicing magic and training their bodies\u2026 They must be extremely hardened.\u201d\u201cIn my land, that is the standard. You are the one with strange circumstances.\u201d\u201c\u2026So is the difference between our sword auras because of the different ways we trained?\u201dThe Frost Queen nodded. \u201cContractor, did you receive some sort of enlightenment when you used a sword aura?\u201d\u201cEnlightenment? Why would I need that?\u201d He looked confused. For him and all the other players, there were only the few things required to make a sword ki or sword aura; they just needed to be good at handling magic and have a decent amount and understanding of it.Seo Jun-ho had already gathered enough magic some time ago to create a sword aura, and his understanding of magic stemmed from the days when he was Specter.\u201cDo I need enlightenment about swordplay when I use a sword aura?\u201d\u201cWell, it is not a requirement to use the technique itself. But if you want to be more efficient, the answer is yes.\u201d She turned and looked at the hundred knights. \u201cThere is something that we say in my land. \u2018If there are a hundred different knights, they will have a hundred shapes of magic.\u2019\u201d\u201c\u2026Shapes of magic? Put it in simple terms.\u201d\u201cHave you already noticed that all their weapons are different?\u201d\u201cOf course. I always thought knights only used swords and shields\u2026 but I guess not.\u201d\u201cThat is because knights are not defined by the weapon they carry. What defines them is the pride in their hearts.\u201d She looked pleased as she looked back at Seo Jun-ho. \u201cThey all found a weapon that they were suited for and created a sword aura that fits its style.\u201d\u201cA weapon that they\u2019re suited for\u2026\u201d he muttered. He didn\u2019t know what weapon suited him best.\u00a0I\u2019m good at using all of them.It would have originally been impossible, but Weapon Mastery (A) made that possible for him. Seo Jun-ho had never considered which weapon would make him the strongest.The reason that I use a sword is because I\u2019ve used it the longest\u2026 I just prefer it because I\u2019m most used to it.\u00a0He thought for a moment before speaking again.\u201cSince I already have a sword aura, will it be hard to become like them?\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201d The Frost Queen shook her head. \u201cYou are like a water bottle. You are filled with transparent water. What would happen if you added something to it?\u201d\u201c\u2026The color would change.\u201d And he could fill it with whatever he wanted. He could make his sword aura into whatever shape he wanted. He\u2019d seen it himself with the knights. Seo Jun-ho slowly nodded his head.\u201cLet\u2019s make that my goal for this Gate.\u201d\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d\u201cMaking a new sword aura.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *The fourteenth knight, Sergio. Seo Jun-ho defeated him, but he no longer had the strength to stand.Why does it feel like the knights are getting stronger every time\u2026As he lay on the ground of the ring, gasping for breath, Horun stepped up to him.\u2013\u00a0\u201cWandering Knight. Will you acknowledge defeat and step aside?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho looked up at him. Even though the knights were kind and polite, they were still inside a Gate.\u00a0Will they kill me if I acknowledge defeat?He laughed at the thought. It was useless to think like that.\u00a0Whether I admit defeat or not, if they all come at me at once\u2026\u00a0He would be fighting for his life.Seo Jun-ho nodded. \u201cIf I\u2019m allowed to rest, I want to. I\u2019m tired.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026Then fall back for today.\u201dAs Horun raised his hand, the door Seo Jun-ho had come through opened again.\u2013\u00a0\u201cWandering Knight, the knights of the Winter Castle will always be waiting here.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m touched.\u201d He really was. He never thought he\u2019d receive such grace within a Gate. As he left, the door slammed shut behind him.\u201cI\u2019m still alive\u2026\u201d he muttered as he looked down at his hands. His stamina was completely spent. All he wanted to do was lay down and rest.It would be a different story if I were fighting for my life\u2026\u00a0But they were simply sparring. He was worried that the knights would turn on him if he killed one of them, so he\u2019d fought with as little killing intent as possible.\u00a0It\u2019s harder to overwhelm them instead of just killing them.\u00a0It was especially so because all the knights were around his level.\u201cSince it\u2019s a castle, there should be a bedroom somewhere, right?\u201d\u201cWhat if all the rooms are empty, as before?\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s no helping it. We\u2019ll make a fire or something.\u201dHe searched through dozens of bedrooms, but none of them had furniture.\u201cIf they\u2019re gonna manifest all of this, they should do it properly. This is all a waste of space.\u201d\u201cJust say that you are angry because there\u2019s no bed.\u201dSeo Jun-ho complained as he started a fire in the fireplace. As soon as he slipped into the sleeping bag from his inventory, his fatigue overwhelmed him.\u201cLet\u2019s eat when I get up. I\u2019m too tired.\u201d\u201cContractor.\u201dRight as he was about to fall asleep, the Frost Queen pulled his hair.\u201cWhere will I sleep?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a spirit. You don\u2019t require human necessities anymore, remember?\u201d\u201cEven when I was human, sleeping was a pastime that I enjoyed.\u201d\u201c\u2026Tissue\u2019s fine, right?\u201d Annoyed, he pulled out a roll of toilet paper and tossed it to her. She deftly pulled out the tissue and rolled up next to the fireplace.She stared up at the high ceiling and laughed faintly. \u201cI feel happy. This is not the castle that I lived in, but I feel like I\u2019ve come home.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Seo Jun-ho muttered, his eyes closing. The Frost Queen glanced at him to check that he was asleep. She pulled herself out of the tissue and sighed as she sat up.\u201cHaa, he sleeps so peacefully even within a Gate\u2026 He is quite the well-groomed Contractor.\u201dShe kept watch the whole night in the cold of the Winter Castle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he opened it, a cold breeze billowed his clothing.\u201cIt\u2019s as cold as always.\u201dHe smacked his lips and gathered the snow that had piled on the window sill to wash his face; the cold woke him up instantly. For breakfast, he had some canned food and wine from his inventory before putting out the fire.\u201cShall we go?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes,\u201d the Frost Queen muttered, her head nodding as she sat on his shoulder.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go to sleep?\u201d\u201c\u2026Night watch.\u201d\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d he asked, surprised. He looked sorry.\u201cHa\u2026\u00a0You look like you\u2019re sorry. I suppose you\u2019re thankful, then.\u201d She seemed satisfied with that and smiled. But Seo Jun-ho scratched his neck and shook his head.\u201cThat\u2019s not it\u2026 I set traps on the door and windows, so there was no need for you to do that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cThanks anyway.\u201dThe Frost Queen\u2019s mouth opened and closed in shock, unable to say anything. Finally, she spoke again.\u201cThen there was no need for me to stand watch\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cWh-why didn\u2019t you tell me?!\u201d She pulled his hair angrily. \u201cI was tired! I wanted to sleep! I like to sleep!\u201d\u201cI mean\u2026 Think about it logically. I\u2019ve been going to Gates for a long time. Do you think I would go to sleep without taking precautions?\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d She huffed and turned away, pouting.Now I feel sorry. I should make her a cup of Agarit tea when we get home.Like yesterday, he walked down the red carpet of the Knight\u2019s Road and opened the doors.Clang!\u00a0Again, the knights drew their weapons and gave off a strong killing intent. But once they saw that it was Seo Jun-ho, they sheathed them again.\u2013\u00a0\u201cHey, it\u2019s the Wandering Knight.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cWe were waiting.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cCome up to the ring! I\u2019ll show you that I\u2019m stronger than yesterday.\u201dThey were enthusiastic. A familiar figure then stepped up to the stage.\u2013\u00a0\u201cHave you come again to prove your knighthood?\u201d Horun asked.\u201cYeah, I guess. Are there any additional conditions, by any chance?\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cThe knights of the Winter Castle are not cruel to one who is proving their honor.\u201dSo there weren\u2019t any.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll be counting on you again.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cHowever, we are always growing. We are stronger than yesterday, and tomorrow, we will be stronger than today.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, whatever.\u201d It was a given. Seo Jun-ho also thought that he could fight better than yesterday.\u00a0With repeated fights, I can pick up on my opponents\u2019 patterns.He stepped up to the stage, and his first opponent followed.\u2013\u00a0\u201cI am Sir Phil.\u201d\u00a0It was the same knight who used a greatsword yesterday.Is the order the same every time?\u00a0In order to check that, he\u2019d have to defeat at least eight knights.Seo Jun-ho pulled out his own greatsword from his inventory. It was an Association-issued greatsword that was provided to its players.\u2013\u00a0\u201cHm? The Wandering Knight has changed his weapon.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cHe used a different sword yesterday.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cAh! Perhaps he hadn\u2019t used his full power?\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cOf course\u2026 I thought it was strange that such a skilled knight could only use a basic sword aura shape.\u201dThe Frost Queen yawned as she listened to the knights chatter. \u201cHaa, what\u2019s this? I thought your main weapon was the sword.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t let such a precious opportunity pass me by.\u201d Thanks to his skill, Seo Jun-ho was able to use all weapons better than the average person, but that didn\u2019t mean he was an expert. On the other hand, the knights of the Winter Castle were masters of their weapons.\u201cYou should always be ready to learn. One of the key traits of a player is having an open mind.\u201dNothing in the world lasted forever. Even when he was Specter, Seo Jun-ho kept learning in order to remain in the number one spot. His habit hadn\u2019t disappeared.\u201cSo you plan to steal the techniques of my knights. How insolent.\u201d\u201cSharing is caring. They won\u2019t even break a sweat.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do as you wish. However\u2026\u201d She smiled mysteriously. \u201cMy knights are not so weak. If you wish to steal their techniques, you will have to put in a great effort.\u201d\u201cGood. I\u2019m pretty persistent.\u201dSeo Jun-ho took his starting stance, and Phil gave a small nod. That marked the beginning of the match.Phil\u2019s greatsword really took me by surprise yesterday,\u00a0he thought, recalling the previous day\u2019s duel. Seo Jun-ho had thought that the greatsword wasn\u2019t so different from a normal sword. He\u2019d thought that it had simply exchanged speed for greater power and reach, but Phil had used it completely differently. The face of the greatsword was two or three times wider than a normal sword, so he\u2019d used it for defense as well.So, Phil uses the greatsword in three different ways.First, he used it like a normal sword to attack.Second, he used the face of its blade as a sturdy shield.And lastly\u2026Woooosh!Phil swung at the air with the blade\u2019s face, blasting a strong gust against Seo Jun-ho.He uses the greatsword like a fan.The powerful swordwind hit Seo Jun-ho\u2019s entire body. He was momentarily blinded, and his hair billowed back. Phil used the distraction to hone in on Seo Jun-ho. As he dashed forward, he spun twice in the air, putting all the extra force into his weapon.The scariest part about a greatsword is its destructive force.\u00a0It was slow, but a greatsword\u2019s unblockable force made up for its lack of speed.\u2013\u00a0\u201cHup!\u201d\u00a0Phil swung his weapon down as if he were trying to cleave through a mountain.Clang!\u00a0Seo Jun-ho blocked it with the face of his own sword. He held it at an angle, absorbing most of the force, but he felt the impact send vibrations down to his feet.This is the best part about a greatsword.\u00a0Even if you blocked an attack, you couldn\u2019t block it completely, and the fatigue would build up.I beat him yesterday with a single attack from Watchguard of Darkness, but I can\u2019t do that starting today.\u00a0If he did, he wouldn\u2019t be able to improve. He wouldn\u2019t take the easy way out until he was able to steal the technique in its entirety.Seo Jun-ho retreated, creating distance between them. He swung his greatsword.Wooosh!It created a swordwind similar to the one Phil had just created.\u2013\u00a0\u201cHo, is he trying to imitate Phil\u2019s technique?\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a poor attempt.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not something you can imitate after seeing it once.\u201dThe knights were harsh in their criticism. He could copy Phil\u2019s technique all he wanted, but the results were different.\u201cIt looks easy\u2026 but it\u2019s harder than I thought.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t hard to create wind, but an unconcentrated swordwind was weak. He couldn\u2019t direct it properly, and Phil\u2019s hair only swayed slightly in the breeze.\u201cWhat did I say? My knights are not weak.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I didn\u2019t expect to be able to do it in one try.\u201dSeo Jun-ho decided to himself.\u00a0It\u2019s okay if the only knight I defeat today is Phil.\u00a0But if he did, it would be after he\u2019d perfectly absorbed the knight\u2019s skills.Seo Jun-ho lifted his greatsword again as Phil charged at him like a boar.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Claaang!The swordwind roared across the ring.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s much too quick at learning techniques.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cIt only took him half a day to perfectly emulate Phil\u2019s technique\u2026\u201dThe knights were buzzing with wonder, but Seo Jun-ho didn\u2019t think that he was all that amazing.I start at a different place than they do.\u00a0Because he had Weapon Mastery (A). Once he got a grasp on the fundamentals of a weapon skill, it wasn\u2019t very hard to execute it.\u201cContractor, you look like you\u2019re enjoying yourself.\u201d\u201cI am. Using a greatsword is fun.\u201dHe didn\u2019t usually enjoy using it. The tempo of a fight was swift, so he preferred not to use a slow weapon.But I might start using it from now on if the situation allows it.\u00a0If he layered the already-destructive greatsword with a sword aura, it would be even stronger; like now.\u201cHup!\u201d He swung the greatsword, which was covered in a powerful, jet-black aura. Phil quickly blocked his attack, but he couldn\u2019t avoid the force of the strike.\u2013\u00a0\u201cKeuk?!\u201d\u00a0Phil\u2019s body flew 5 meters into the air and rolled across the ground as he fell.If this were a real battle, it\u2019d be over.\u00a0If their lives were on the line, Kis would have been dead the moment he was open on the ground.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u00a0Phil stared at his right arm; it was broken, bent like a doll\u2019s. He stood up and praised Seo Jun-ho enthusiastically.\u2013\u00a0\u201cWhat great force. I layered my sword aura twice as thick as usual\u2026\u201d\u201cI was surprised too.\u201d It was true. He\u2019d been able to rip through it because of Watchguard of Darkness, but Phil had flown back solely due to the greatsword\u2019s power.I suppose the force of the greatsword increases with the strength stat.\u00a0No matter how strong it was as a shield, it could be penetrated with a powerful hit. Seo Jun-ho admired his greatsword.\u2013\u00a0\u201cNext is I, Lance! Wandering Knight, do you need some time to rest?\u201dSeo Jun-ho watched him step up to the stage as he put away his greatsword in his inventory.\u201cThe second one is the same too,\u201d he muttered, pulling out a long spear. Lance was surprised when he saw this.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026You\u2019ll steal my techniques too?\u201d\u201cHehe, sharing is caring.\u201d He grinned.* * *Seo Jun-ho had defeated seven knights on his first day, but that number had decreased to two on his second. However, as he lay in front of the warm fireplace, Seo Jun-ho felt satisfied.\u201cThis is great. What kind of Gate is so useful?\u201d\u201cI do not know. I don\u2019t think the Gate was created for this purpose\u2026\u201d The Frost Queen sighed. In order to not make the same mistake as the night before, she\u2019d made a sleeping cap out of tissue.\u201cThose spear skills were amazing. The weapon was one thing, but his aura was fun.\u201d Most spear users only used an aura to lengthen their reach a bit, but Lance was different.The way he used an aura to make the spearhead similar to a drill was really interesting, but I was more impressed by the way he used the handle like a whip.\u00a0After all, the appeal of the spear was its chaotic, unpredictable attacks. But when a weapon aura came into play, it made it impossible to read.\u201cYou know, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cWh-What are you saying\u2026\u201d The Frost Queen\u2019s cheeks reddened at the sudden confession.\u201cThink about it. If you hadn\u2019t told me about the knighthood test, I would\u2019ve had to fight a hundred of those knights at once.\u201d It would\u2019ve been like trying to take on thirty level-80 players at once. \u201cOf course, if I used Watchguard of Darkness and Booster, I would\u2019ve been able to defeat them, even if I got injured\u2026\u201d But he wouldn\u2019t have been able to improve his weapon skills that way.\u201cI feel a little bad saying this, but this is the first time I\u2019ve felt happy about making a contract with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026You always add an unnecessary statement!\u201d She summoned a snowball and threw it at his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seo Jun-ho strode up to the door of the training ground and was asked the same question once more:\u2013\u00a0\u201cHave you come again to prove your knighthood?\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cOf course.\u201dThe only things that had changed were Phil and Lance\u2019s attitudes; they shook their heads and refused to fight.\u2013\u00a0\u201cWandering Knight, you have already far surpassed our abilities.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cThe only reason we have left to fight you is our own greed.\u201dYesterday, they\u2019d clearly surrendered early in their matches. Perhaps that was why they looked at him with an air of respect. Today, they were only here to watch.\u2013\u00a0\u201cHoh, how interesting. If it continues as such, you will not even need to unsheathe your sword on the final day. You would be able to fight Sir Kis at your best.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, I didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d Seo Jun-ho scratched his head.The third opponent, Ticino, stepped up.\u201cAh, Ticino. He was famous for having a fiery character.\u201d\u201cI know. I fought him on the first day.\u201d He used a spear like Lance did, but Seo Jun-ho still had a lot left to learn.Lance\u2019s spear and Ticino\u2019s spears are completely different.\u00a0After fighting them both, it was hard to believe that they used the same weapon. Unlike Lance, whose spear was constantly moving, Ticino landed hard and heavy hits.\u00a0If Lance\u2019s spear is like a machine gun, Ticino\u2019s is like a cannon.Ticino gripped his spear with both hands, holding it between his armpits as he charged.\u2013\u00a0\u201cFor the Queen!\u201d\u201cYes, yes, thank you.\u201d* * *It had been two months since he had entered the Gate. It had taken much longer than he had expected, but Seo Jun-ho wasn\u2019t scared or nervous. On the contrary, his eyes grew brighter as time passed. The only thing that had changed was that he was no longer receiving a knight\u2019s acknowledgment every four days.\u201cDo you plan to train again today?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s nice to learn new techniques, but it\u2019s also important to brush up on things I\u2019ve already learned.\u201dHis daily life was very simple. He would wake up, eat, fight the knights, train the techniques, train some more, and sleep. The cycle was never-ending.Both his hair and beard had grown out quite a bit. The Frost Queen covered her mouth and giggled as she saw him.\u201cFufu, you look like a castaway.\u201d\u201cWould that make you Wilson?\u201d\u201cI am not a volleyball.\u201d\u201cDamn, when did you watch that movie?\u201d(TN: This is a reference to the movie Cast Away, starring Tom Hanks.)If it weren\u2019t for the Frost Queen\u2019s constant chatter, he would have quickly grown tired of his current life, no matter how much he would learn. But thanks to her, he was able to continue to learn and train.Exactly three months and two weeks after he had entered the Gate, he\u2019d completely absorbed all the knights\u2019 weapon techniques.\u201cNo wonder he\u2019s the captain. It took me four days to learn Horun\u2019s technique because it was so complicated.\u201d\u201cThey say that a single sword can cause ten thousand changes.\u201dSeo Jun-ho finally received his proof of knighthood, and the hundred others treated him as a full-fledged knight.\u201cMy stats also increased a lot after training like crazy for all that time.\u201dHis Stamina had increased by 2, and his Strength, Agility, and Magic had all increased by 1. And that wasn\u2019t everything he\u2019d received.[Cold Tolerance]Rank: CEffect: You can tolerate the cold.After he\u2019d spent three months in the harsh cold of the Winter Castle, he\u2019d adapted to the climate and received the skill out of nowhere.\u201cI\u2019m not cold at all anymore.\u201d When he\u2019d first come here, he\u2019d had to create a large fire and wear his thick jacket constantly. But now, he felt fine simply wearing a long-sleeved shirt.I\u2019ve also learned a lot of little tricks.\u00a0He\u2019d learned how to flex his muscles ever so slightly to fake a strike, how to read his opponent\u2019s next move, and so on. He\u2019d also refined many of his other, smaller techniques that wouldn\u2019t appear in textbooks.\u201cI\u2019ve worked really hard\u2026 I wonder what the reward will be.\u201d\u201cContractor, do not be so eager. The strongest enemy is still left.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Sir Kissyface.\u201d Seo Jun-ho nodded gravely. \u201cLet\u2019s get him today.\u201dHe had nothing left to gain from the Gate. It was time to fulfill his mission and return to Earth. This was his final task.Creak!\u00a0After being used so many times in the past three months, the door now opened smoothly, as if it were oiled.\u2013\u00a0\u201cThe Wandering Knight is here!\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone who understands weaponry better than him.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cYup. He\u2019s one of the few men that I acknowledge.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cI was called a genius in my hometown, but the world sure is big.\u201dThe knights approached him, full of admiration. Seo Jun-ho felt a pang in his chest.Ah, how nice it would be if I could take them back to Earth\u2026\u00a0They would have been a huge help in the future, but it was impossible to do that. There was a bitter taste in Seo Jun-ho\u2019s mouth as he gave his final goodbyes.\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard, Phil. Ticino, tone it down a bit. Oh, that technique you taught me was great, Bogus\u2026\u201d He bid farewell to each and every knight in the Winter Castle.\u2013\u00a0\u201cWandering Knight, your pride was unshakeable.\u201d\u00a0Captain Horun held out his hand. As Seo Jun-ho shook it, he smiled for the first time.\u00a0\u201cMay I ask your name?\u201dThey\u2019d never asked for his name before, only calling him \u2018Wandering Knight\u2019. Seo Jun-ho smiled happily.\u201cSeo Jun-ho. That\u2019s my name.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cWhat an interesting name.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cSeo Jun-ho, Seo Jun-ho\u2026 I won\u2019t forget it.\u2013\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve left the deepest impression on me out of any knight.\u201d\u00a0The knights of the Winter Castle smiled as they approached him one by one.\u00a0Thump. Thump. Thump.\u00a0Each one patted him on the shoulder. It wasn\u2019t much, but it somehow gave him strength.Horun was the last one. He patted him on the shoulder and held out a metallic emblem in the shape of mist.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cIt is a token of sorts. It shows that you have proven your knighthood.\u201dSeo Jun-ho clenched his fist around it. He smiled. \u201cNice. I\u2019m gonna brag about it to my friends later,\u201d he muttered.\u2013\u00a0\u201cHahaha! I\u2019m sure they will be proud of you.\u201d\u00a0Horun thumped his shoulder once more and stood to the side. The one hundred knights followed, cutting a path for him to walk through.\u2013\u00a0\u201cThe one who has proven his knighthood may meet with the Lord of the Castle.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cI bet he\u2019ll like you too.\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s spar again when I get stronger.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-ho slowly started to walk down the path. He felt strange.\u201cHa, you must feel something peculiar. Did you not know that such things could happen within a Gate?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d\u201cPay attention to your surroundings. There may be other ways to reach your goal.\u201d The Frost Queen seemed happy as she lectured him. Not a single one of her knights had been injured.Seo Jun-ho arrived at the door and glanced behind himself. The knights of the Winter Castle waved as they smiled brightly.\u201c\u2026Thank you,\u201d he whispered. He pushed the frozen doors open.Creaaak!\u00a0As he entered the room, Seo Jun-ho drew in a harsh breath.It\u2019s different.\u00a0The air was so heavy, it felt as if his entire body were being weighed down.And the source of this energy was one man sitting on a large throne.\u201c\u2026Frost.\u201d At his call, the Frost Queen flew from his shoulder to study the man.\u201cHe is Kis Bremen. My and Niflheim\u2019s most powerful knight.\u201d\u201cHe looks strong, just like you told me.\u201dShing.\u00a0Kis slowly stood up from his seat and silently unsheathed his sword.I can feel his hostility.\u00a0The powerful bloodlust he emanated was enough to make Seo Jun-ho\u2019s skin tingle.\u201cIt seems that Sir Kis is aware that you are a player.\u201d\u201cI agree. He planned to kill me as soon as he saw me.\u201dSeo Jun-ho pushed his magic into Black Armor, causing it to unfold and cover him from head to toe. He pulled out a spear from his inventory, spinning it around a few times.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u00a0Kis glanced at Seo Jun-ho\u2019s weapon, looking away from his figure.\u201cHup!\u201d In a split second, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s spear divided into eight, aiming at vital points across Kis\u2019s body. They weren\u2019t just mere illusions; they were real spearpoints.Clang!\u00a0Kis blocked the attack easily.He\u2019s too relaxed.\u00a0Determined, Seo Jun-ho\u2019s eyes narrowed as he called upon his magic. The darkness wavered and bloomed, covering his spear like a snake.\u201cContractor! You shouldn\u2019t use such a powerful technique already\u2026\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. I can\u2019t afford to go easy on him.\u201dThe aura wrapped over the spearhead and started to whirl.\u00a0It consumes a lot of magic, but this can pierce through anything.Kis eyed the spear and wordlessly ignited a gray aura over his sword, compressing it several times. He\u2019d instinctively sensed that Seo Jun-ho\u2019s attack would be dangerous. Seo Jun-ho watched as he pulled his spear back in preparation.He\u2019s strong.\u00a0He was the Lord of the Winter Castle, the Sword of the Niflheim Empire. A weapon aura wouldn\u2019t be enough to hunt a monster like him.\u201cFrost, what\u2019s the time for Booster?\u201d\u201cWith this temperature, it should last for a minute and two seconds.\u201d\u201cOne minute and two seconds\u2026\u201d He took a mental note of the number. \u201cStart counting!\u201d he shouted.Seo Jun-ho started to give off an explosive magic energy, and his body temperature started to rise.\u00a0It\u2019s hot. But I feel full of energy.\u00a0He thrust his spear sharply at Kis. The spearhead burst into sixteen different pieces, flying into the air. He felt sure that Kis wouldn\u2019t be able to block it.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBut that was an arrogant mistake. Kis coolly blocked each projectile. Seo Jun-ho\u2019s body locked up at the sight.\u201cContractor! Get it together!\u201d\u201cShit\u2014!\u201dHe ducked back a beat too late and felt his head sting. Seo Jun-ho wiped the blood from his forehead and bit his lip. The alarm bells were going off in his head.He looked down at his spear. The tip had been broken off with a single hit.\u00a0I can\u2019t use this.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t estimate how the battle would go anymore. It wasn\u2019t a matter of technique, but rather, there was too much of a difference in the quality of their weapons. He tossed the spear aside and unsheathed Black Dragon Fang.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u00a0Kis swung his sword slowly as he stepped forward. Gray mist started to surround his body. It covered the field in an instant, blocking Seo Jun-ho\u2019s vision.\u201c\u2026Ashen Mist. This is Sir Kis\u2019s ability.\u201d\u201cWhat does it do?\u201d\u201cAll it does is block one\u2019s vision by covering the entire battlefield. However\u2026\u201dHe was the Sword of the Empire, the Knight of the Mist. And the reason he was feared was because of the way he slayed his enemies in battle with this very technique.\u201cTake heed, Contractor. You don\u2019t know when or where he will attack you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already watching myself, but\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face fell. He couldn\u2019t see a single step in front of him. It felt like a tight, solitary cell. Even if he walked forward, all he saw was gray.My skin feels tingly.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t tell where Kis was, but he felt him watching from somewhere through the mist. However, he was pondering over something more important.Should I turn off Booster? Or should I keep going?Time wasn\u2019t on his side. With every second, his body heated up even more.\u201cFrost, time.\u201d\u201c42 seconds, 41 seconds, 40\u2026\u201dHe was running out of time. If Kis waited for 40 more seconds, Seo Jun-ho would lose all chances of winning.Dammit.\u00a0He grit his teeth as he made his decision. The magic that ran through his circuits dispersed back into a normal speed.\u00a0Phew, time to cool off.\u00a0He quickly covered Black Armor with ice. He felt his body temperature start to fall bit by bit, but he couldn\u2019t let his guard down.Where is he? I can\u2019t sense anything at all.\u00a0He was completely blind, and he couldn\u2019t even sense a trace of magic. As the Frost Queen said, he didn\u2019t know from where or when Kis would attack.Nervous sweat beaded on his face. A single drop rolled down to his chin and plopped to the ground.\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dSeo Jun-ho felt a chill go up his spine.Shing!\u00a0A sharp sword swung down on his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was no other way to describe it; he couldn\u2019t spare a second to scream or even think. Seo Jun-ho\u2019s body hit the ground.Slash!\u00a0Kis\u2019s sword hit the ground as Seo Jun-ho stood up. He activated Booster again.\u201cI won\u2019t miss this time!\u201d He kicked off the ground, Black Dragon Fang aimed at Kis\u2019s face.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBut Kis was an experienced knight. He dodged the attack, tilting his body ever so slightly before digging his knee into Seo Jun-ho\u2019s stomach.\u201cGuh!\u201d His body raised into the air from the force of the strike, and Kis grabbed him by the neck and smashed his head into the ground.\u201c\u2026Keok!\u201d Blood spewed out from Seo Jun-ho\u2019s mouth as he coughed. But he couldn\u2019t afford to lose focus.\u00a0He\u2019s coming again!As his eyes flew open, Kis\u2019s steel boots looked like mountains before him. Seo Jun-ho quickly rolled his body and narrowly dodged.\u00a0Crunch!\u00a0The ground shattered into pieces.If he had been even a moment late, that would have been his head.\u201cDammit\u2026\u201dKis didn\u2019t give him a moment to rest. He prepared his next strike.I can\u2019t be the only one who keeps getting attacked!Seo Jun-ho rolled off the ground and placed his hand down.\u00a0Crackle!\u00a0A giant ice fang sprouted toward Kis.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201d\u00a0He quickly drew his sword to block, but he couldn\u2019t handle the force. He flew into the air and disappeared into the mist once again.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cPhew, somehow\u2026\u201d When he finally thought he\u2019d have a moment to breathe, a sword pierced through the mist.\u201cGive me a break!\u201d he complained, quickly blocking.Claaang!\u00a0Their blades clashed, but Seo Jun-ho was the one who pushed the other forward.\u201cFrom this distance\u2026\u201d\u00a0It would be impossible to dodge.\u00a0Seo Jun-ho stepped closer and elbowed Kis in the chin.Crunch!\u00a0The strike was so powerful that it dented his helmet. For the first time in the entire battle, he staggered.Seo Jun-ho wouldn\u2019t let this chance slip by. He grabbed Kis\u2019s helmet and kneed him in the face. He heard his nose break as blood pooled to the ground.\u201cContractor! Be careful!\u201dHe didn\u2019t hear her warning until it was too late. The world spun.\u00a0Huh\u2026?He only realized what had happened when he felt the pain in his legs. Even as he was being beaten, Kis had kicked him. As his back hit the ground, Kis\u2019s sword came down like lightning.Crackle!\u00a0He quickly created a shield out of ice to block, but the sword cut through it like butter. Kis had aimed for his heart, but Seo Jun-ho\u2019s shield had redirected his sword to his shoulder. He screamed.\u201cContractor!\u201dPanicked, the Frost Queen quickly created twenty ice arrows and flung them at Kis.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u00a0He dashed back and calmly cut through each one.The Frost Queen fluttered over to Seo Jun-ho. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cKeuk\u2026\u00a0Thanks to you.\u201d He safely managed to stand and looked down at his left shoulder. He was bleeding a lot, but he didn\u2019t freeze the wound.\u00a0Freezing it would be suicide.\u00a0He needed to use both of his arms\u2014even if he bled to death. Even if he died and came back to life with one arm, he\u2019d never be able to defeat Kis.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe distance between them was barely one meter; they could almost feel the other breathe. They stared each other down, trying to catch their breaths.Just once\u2026 If I can just land one good attack, I think I can do it.\u00a0He considered intentionally creating an opening, but he quickly shook his head.\u00a0At his level, it\u2019s too dangerous.\u00a0There was a 100% chance that Kis\u2019s strike would be lethal.Kis took two steps back and disappeared into the mist. As Seo Jun-ho watched, he cloaked his own body in darkness.\u201cNight Walking.\u201dThe two of them concealed their traces and silenced their breaths. Silence fell over the long hall. The only sound was the whoosh of the blizzard outside, heard through the crevice of a window.\u201cContractor, can you not ambush him in this state? Like the way you did in the Cave of Trials.\u201dHe shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s hard to hide my traces from someone as strong as him.\u201d If his comrades in the Cave of Trials hadn\u2019t been mere illusions, they would\u2019ve sensed him too. Night Walking was most effective against less experienced opponents.\u201cAh, that is unfortunate. You only have 24 seconds left for Booster as well.\u201dAt her warning, Seo Jun-ho grit his teeth and released Booster. Heat rippled off his body, and his head pounded like a migraine. He leaned against the wall and dug through his inventory for a potion, pouring it over his wound before drinking the rest of it down.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Of course, potions weren\u2019t all-powerful. He didn\u2019t feel any instant changes either. He quickly inspected his body.\u2026It\u2019s the worst possible situation.\u00a0After using Booster consecutively, his body was extremely worn out. The burning sensation in his head wasn\u2019t a good sign either; it meant that his judgment would falter.\u00a0Let\u2019s calm down. If I can\u2019t think straight, I won\u2019t be able to do anything at all.He caught his breath and calmed himself before he started to analyze the situation.\u00a0The problem is the fucking mist. I can\u2019t ever make the first move.Kis was superior in terms of skill, strength, speed, and everything else. But the battle only ever started when Kis ambushed him.\u201cThis is bad\u2026 I\u2019ve been playing right into the palm of his hand.\u201d There was only one way to win.\u201cI\u2019ll turn the tables right back at him.\u201dSeo Jun-ho removed Black Armor and wrapped his shoulder.

Kis raised his sword and prepared himself to ambush the player again.\u2013\u00a0I caught you.\u00a0He swung his sword at the large mass of magic in front of him, cutting straight through his opponent\u2019s neck.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u00a0Kis\u2019s face fell. He felt something off.\u00a0It was too easy.\u00a0His opponent hadn\u2019t even reacted. Kis grabbed him and checked his face.\u2013\u00a0I was tricked.\u00a0The shadow dummy dissipated with a hissing noise, as if it were laughing. At that moment, he felt a powerful wave of magic behind him.\u2013\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u00a0Kis whipped around.\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201dSeo Jun-ho unleashed the Frost energy.

The black mist fell to the ground in hailstones.He took a deep breath. Seo Jun-ho raised his sword and walked over to Kis, who was trapped in the ice. The sword pierced through the thick ice and through his heart.It\u2019s finally over\u2026\u00a0He finally relaxed.Crash!\u00a0Kiss broke through the ice and kneed him in the stomach.\u201cGuh!\u201d\u00a0Seo Jun-ho flew back, rolling on the red carpet that was covered in hailstones. Kis followed him like a flash of lightning, drawing his sword.Clang!\u00a0Sparks flew as their blades met. Seo Jun-ho had managed to take out a greatsword and block him, but Kis was too strong. Seo Jun-ho\u2019s arm started to give out, and Kis\u2019s sword got closer and closer, pressing onto him like a mountain.How\u2026 How is this possible\u2026?!\u00a0He couldn\u2019t believe it. Black Dragon Fang was stuck through his heart. He shouldn\u2019t be able to move, let alone attack with superhuman strength.Just what\u2026 is he fighting so hard for?\u00a0As his head started to fill with questions, Kis\u2019s strength finally started to fade.\u2013\u00a0\u201cCough! Cough!\u201d\u00a0His sword clattered to the ground as he vomited black blood. He fell to his knees and fell over to his side.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho unconsciously touched his temple. It stung every time he touched it. If he had been a tenth, no, a hundredth of a second late, Kis\u2019s sword would have cut through his head.\u201cI really almost kicked the bucket this time\u2026\u201d Just as he let out a sigh of relief, his vision darkened. Hot blood had started to drip down from the crown of his head.\u201cContractor, are you alright?\u201d\u201cYeah, well\u2026 Once I get seen by a healer, it won\u2019t even leave a scar,\u201d he said as he took out a fresh potion and poured it over his head.\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d Relieved, the Frost Queen now looked over to her knight. Kis Bremen was leaned up against the ice dummy, staring at the ceiling. His consciousness was fading.\u2013\u00a0\u2026I failed.\u00a0Warm tears spilled down from his eyes, but it wasn\u2019t because he was afraid of death.\u00a0I\u2019m sorry.It was because he had failed to protect the monarch he\u2019d sworn his loyalty to, because he had lost the last chance to make right of his regrets.\u2013\u00a0\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d\u00a0He looked up at the ceiling, hand outstretched.\u201cHe\u2019s looking for you. Wouldn\u2019t it be good to show yourself, at least?\u201d\u201cI do not deserve to do that.\u201d She smiled bitterly as she shook her head. \u201cA monarch must protect their people. The knights of the Winter Castle are citizens of Niflheim before they are my knights. And\u2026 I failed to protect them.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with that\u2026\u201d Seo Jun-ho couldn\u2019t understand her. She saw his expression and laughed weakly.\u201cRemember this: the righteousness of the weak is nothing but a shout in the silence.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe\u2019d learned this painful lesson in the war. That was all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was another one below it.[You have cleared \u27eaWinter Castle\u27eb\u2019s Hidden Quest, \u2018Proof of Knighthood\u2019.][Weapon Mastery (A) has evolved to Weapon Mastery (S).][You will be able to understand the principles and use of any weapon when you hold any weapon.][You have leveled up.][You have leveled up.][You have received 2 Strength stats from \u27ecLimit Breaker\u27ed\u2019s effect.]The rank increased!\u00a0He clenched his fists. Not long ago, at the Cave of Trials, Hero\u2019s Mind had become S-rank and Keen Intuition had become A-rank, and now, Weapon Mastery was S-rank.\u201cMan\u2026 That was so worth it.\u201d The reward made up for the three months he\u2019d spent in the Gate. Those hard, tedious times were now only memories.Limit Breaker\u2019s effect is useful too.\u00a0He received it for overcoming the limits of a player, and it increased a random stat by 1 every time he leveled up.\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d Seo Junho chuckled like an old man as he looked at his status window. The Frost Queen read over his shoulder and gave him a look of disgust when he started to laugh.\u201cYour laugh is disturbing.\u201d She flew back.\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t control it. Any player would react the same way.\u201d That was how great his status window was.[Seo Junho]Level: 34Title: The One Who Opens Spring (+2)Strength: 108 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Stamina: 119Speed: 111\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Magic: 150He was barely level 34, but all of his stats were over 100. He could compete with low rankers.\u201cThe numbers are so beautiful.\u201d It reminded him of the times he\u2019d play games at PC cafes when he was a student. It had been so satisfying to see his game character\u2019s stats increase one by one.\u201cHonestly, I would\u2019ve been proud even if these were just my character\u2019s stats\u2026\u201d But they were his own. How could he\u00a0not\u00a0be happy?\u201c\u2026I understand, so go check the Gate\u2019s rewards.\u201d\u201cOh, it was a key or something, right?\u201d He reached into his inventory and pulled it out. \u201cAn Armory Key\u2026\u201d\u201cThe armory is in the basement of the castle.\u201d She quickly checked the time. There were only 58 minutes left until the Gate would close.\u201cI should hurry.\u201d Seo Junho stood up and followed the Frost Queen to the basement. They arrived before a large door. It creaked as he opened it with his key. Hundreds of weapons then filled his vision.\u201c\u2026Frost, there\u2019s no limit to how many I can take, right?\u201d\u201cIf memory serves, there is not.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026!\u201d His mouth spread into a wide grin.[You have entered the Winter Castle\u2019s Armory.][When a weapon is selected, you will automatically be teleported outside the Armory.]\u201cAh.\u201d His face fell. The Frost Queen cackled at the sight.\u201cGray, was it? That Administrator must be watching over you still.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not into men,\u201d he grumbled. Seo Junho slowly turned back toward the armory. The Winter Castle truly was a sacred ground for knights. The armory was full of high-quality weapons.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single one that isn\u2019t up to par.\u201dHe walked around the armory for 40 minutes, lost in thought.\u00a0The best weapon grade is Unique. As long as I choose one of those, it doesn\u2019t actually matter which one it is.First, he ruled out a sword. Black Dragon Fang was already a Unique weapon, and there wouldn\u2019t be a sword better than it.\u201cThe one I prefer\u2026\u201d Before him were a spear and an axe. They were both Unique-grade, so it all came down to a matter of preference. \u201cThe spear is nice because it lets me maintain a distance from the opponent, but the axe can be used unrestricted\u2026\u201d He\u2019d also enjoyed using the spear when he was Specter. As he pondered, the Frost Queen looked around the armory on her own.\u201cWhy are you thinking so hard? You can simply choose a weapon that combines their merits.\u201d\u201cA weapon that combines\u2026\u00a0Ah!\u201d Realizing something, Seo Junho whipped around to the corner of the armory. A long halberd was hung on the wall. \u201cI want both, so that\u2019s not bad either.\u201dThe halberd was also called a barb spear or an axe-spear. The spear tip was combined with an axe blade, so it contained the best parts of each weapon. It was hard for beginners to use, but he was no beginner.\u201cThanks for the tip.\u201d The Frost Queen nodded. Seo Junho spun the halberd in his hands a few times. It shone with an inky light. The shaft was thick, and a sharp spearhead was attached at the tip, with a heavy axe blade on the side.\u201cThe length and weight are pretty good.\u201dThe cool metal felt good in his hands. He made up his mind when he saw the item info.\u300cCruel Executioner\u300dGrade: Unique\u2217 Bleeding: Those who are injured by the weapon will bleed more than usual.\u2217 Lightweight: Magic is attached to make this weapon lighter.\u2217 Blood Pact: Every time an opponent\u2019s blood stains the weapon, the user\u2019s stamina is recovered.Use Requirements: Level 30, 100 Strength, 100 Speed\u201cWow! Blood Pact!\u201d He hadn\u2019t even expected it. Players usually called Blood Pact the final boss of weapon effects.[Select \u300cCruel Executioner\u300d?]Seo Junho nodded vigorously.\u201cOf course.\u201d The magic wavered as it teleported him outside of the armory. He was grinning like a child.\u201cIs the weapon that great?\u201d the Frost Queen asked.\u201cWhat do you think? The Blood Pact effect is super OP.\u201d It would be extremely useful against the majority of his opponents. He\u2019d be able to keep fighting them without losing any stamina.\u201cWell, as long as you like it. We should hurry and be on our way.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Seo Junho checked the time and started to sprint down the hall. There were only ten minutes left until the Gate would collapse. Considering the time it would take to go back, he was cutting it short.\u201cAt least we were not too late.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 huh?\u201dHe made it to the front of the Gate just in time, but something caught his eye. A big portrait was hung on the wall of the hall.\u201cWas that always there? I didn\u2019t even notice when I was fighting Kis.\u201d He reached out and touched the painting. The portrait contained a beautiful woman who sat on a chair with her legs crossed.\u201cWow\u2026 She\u2019s really pretty\u2026\u201d She was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen. She wore a blue dress, and her silky, silver hair reached the floor. She held a white scepter in her pale hand, indicating that she was a queen. Her eyes looked down in a prideful stare. Even though it was just a painting, she let out an aloof, charismatic air that made her feel unapproachable.\u201cLooking at her clothes, she\u2019s probably a queen\u2026 Huh? Wait a second.\u201d He belatedly realized who it was. Seo Junho slowly shook his head as he looked between the queen in the portrait and the little Frost Queen. \u201cN-no way\u2026 That\u2019s not you, is it?\u201d\u201cHmph, it is.\u201d She turned around. Seeing how her long ears were red, she felt shy.\u201cCan you take off that weird visor thing just once?\u201d\u201cNo! Stop saying useless things and just get out!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t win against her pestering, so he stepped out of the Gate.* * *Cha Si-eun tapped her fingers nervously against her desk. It was the latest habit she\u2019d developed.It had already been three months since her boss, Seo Junho, had left for one of the Three Uncleared Gates in the world. Even with the Gates\u2019 time differences accounted for, no one had ever stayed inside one for three months.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d\u00a0She let out another sigh as she read over the news articles.[Player Seo Junho breaks the Guinness World Record for longest time spent in a Gate.][Will the Three Uncleared Gates remain untouched forever?!][Korea\u2019s Player Association President Shim Deokgu: \u201cThe Gate conquest isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d]The Association\u2019s atmosphere wasn\u2019t great these days. They were being harassed by netizens that accused them of lying about sending Seo Junho to the Winter Castle to boost his reputation.Why aren\u2019t you coming out\u2026?\u00a0She gloomily closed the articles. Funnily enough, she had a lot of time on her hands now.People are so funny.\u00a0As Seo Junho\u2019s conquest dragged on, the sponsorship proposals and personal commission requests had stopped coming in. She hated how they were all assuming that he\u2019d failed.\u201cWhy do players climb the Floors for people like this\u2026?\u201d She couldn\u2019t understand. They worked hard to clear Gates and climb Floors for these selfish people, but no one ever recognized their efforts.At that moment, her Vita rang with a message notification.\u201cAh.\u201d She opened it as quick as lightning.[Sender: Pegasus]\u2617\u2617Enter the best\u2729game\u2617to a world of imagination$$Register now\u261c\u261cfor a free 1-month coupon#Come into the [email\u00a0protected] @of swords and magic\u261c\u261c\u201cUgh!\u201d Cha Si-eun angrily shut off the message. She laid down on her desk, sulking.\u00a0I never get a message from him, and all I ever get is spam\u2026\u00a0She wondered if she should change her phone number.Her Vita rang with another message.\u201cGeez\u2026\u201d She wrinkled her nose and unenthusiastically tapped on her Vita, still lying down.Crash!\u00a0The other people in the secretary office stared at her as her chair fell over. But she wasn\u2019t paying attention. With wide eyes, she reread the message.[Sender: Seo Junho]\u2013 hai secretary cha~ please send me a teleporter.The contents were a bit strange, but he\u2019d finally messaged her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The thought of meeting her boss after three months made her nervous.\u201cIn, out. In, out. Deep breaths.\u201d After calming herself down, she waited for the teleporter. She chewed her lips as her head filled with all kinds of negative thoughts.What should I do if that was a message from a hacker?\u00a0The teleporter would probably return alone and yell at her to not pull another prank like this.All her worries disappeared the moment the teleporter returned. A familiar man was with him.\u201cJ-Junho-nim!\u201d\u201cOh? Long time no see, Secretary Cha.\u201d It had been three months since she saw him, but she couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? You look like a castaway who was just rescued.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 Really? That\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve heard that.\u201d The teleporter had said the same thing.The first thing Cha Si-eun did was hand him a mug of tea.\u201cLavender tea, right?\u201d\u201cI brewed it just now, so it\u2019s still hot.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d He looked happy as he blew on the steam. \u201cMm~ I feel like I\u2019m melting. This is really nice.\u201d\u201cHow are you feeling? Are you hungry? Are you hurt anywhere? I wasn\u2019t sure, so I have a healer on standby\u2026\u201d\u201cSlow down. Let\u2019s take things one at a time.\u201d Seo Junho grinned as he took a seat, taking a big gulp of his tea. \u201cFirst of all, I do need some treatment. The injury isn\u2019t very big, though.\u201d He was talking about the injuries on his shoulder and the crown of his head that he received from Kis.The healer on standby stepped forward. \u201cI-I will assist you. Please show me where you were injured.\u201d\u201cThis shoulder and the top of my head.\u201d The healer finished quickly and poured their magic into him to release his fatigue.\u201cMan, that feels good\u2026 Thank you.\u201d\u201cNot at all. You\u2019ve worked hard!\u201d The healer bowed. They looked at him in admiration, and so did all the other people who had awaited his return.\u201cWow\u2026 He really cleared one of the Three Uncleared Gates?\u201d\u201cAmazing. I don\u2019t think any player has pulled off such an achievement since the Nine Heavens.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s on a similar level with Kim Woojoong and Shin Sunghyun, but he\u2019s faster. That\u2019s insane.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re both in the Association.\u201dSeo Junho just quietly sipped his tea, but he didn\u2019t feel all that great. His body and mind were exhausted from fighting with Kis, but they were treating him like a monkey in a zoo.Cha Si-eun suddenly grabbed his wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re tired, aren\u2019t you? I will escort you home.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAh, I wanted an autograph\u2026\u201dShe didn\u2019t bother telling them off as she rushed to the elevator. When it was just the two of them, she looked at him apologetically.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have been more discreet about your return\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s my fault for being away for so long.\u201d Seo Jun-ho had spent three months and seventeen days within the Gate, but that translated to three months and two days on Earth. \u201cAnyways, I didn\u2019t expect you to be so energetic,\u201d he said, looking down. She was still gripping tightly on his wrist.\u201cOh, I-I\u2019m sorry\u2026!\u201d She quickly pulled away, realizing her mistake. It started to feel a little awkward, so Seo Junho changed the subject.\u201cHow are things in the Association? I expected this to some extent, but I want to hear it directly from you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Things aren\u2019t great.\u201d She looked displeased as she chewed the inside of her cheek. \u201cMultiple conspiracy theories have started to circulate after you didn\u2019t come out in three months.\u201d\u201cPeople always love rumors.\u201d\u201cSponsorships and personal commission requests have stopped completely, and\u2026\u00a0Haa,\u00a0it makes me angry just thinking about it. Can you believe it? I got asked if I could refund a sponsorship fee that was already paid. I fought those people tooth and nail.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too much.\u201d Seo Jun-ho\u2019s face went dark for a moment as he considered something. He nodded. \u201cAlright. Give them what they want.\u201d\u201c\u2026Excuse me?\u201d\u201cRefund all the sponsorship fees for all the people who asked. And we\u2019ll release an article saying that they asked for a refund while I was in the Gate, so we refunded them. We\u2019ll thank them for their sponsorship\u2026 and then list all their names at the bottom.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d Cha Si-eun shivered. She\u2019d never even considered such a method of revenge. \u201cSo they\u2019ll be publicly screwed\u2026 I mean, scorned.\u201d\u201cThey brought it upon themselves.\u201d\u201cBut they\u2019ll make complaints, saying that you\u2019re hurting their reputation\u2026\u201d\u201cReputation?\u201d He was smiling, but his eyes were sharp. \u201cThey had the nerve to do that in the first place. Weren\u2019t they the ones who hurt my reputation first?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIf anyone ever insults me, bring them to me. If they can still lodge their complaints after seeing me face to face, I\u2019ll be impressed.\u201d\u201cBring in people who complain\u2026 I\u2019ll make sure to do that.\u201d She wrote down a note in her Vita. The thought of getting revenge made her feel giddy.\u201cHow is everything else?\u201d\u201cThe guilds have started moving. You know what they say: strike while the iron\u2019s still hot.\u201dThe guilds that were jealous of his skills had put out statements that he was too weak to clear the Winter Castle\u2014that he was too greedy and arrogant.\u201cYou\u2019ve noted down all the guilds that did this, correct?\u201d\u201cYes. I also investigated the Guildmaster and guild members, just in case.\u201d\u201cVery nice.\u201d Seo Junho gave her a thumbs-up. \u201cPlease send all those documents to me. I\u2019ll accuse them of defamation.\u201d\u201cWill it be okay? Your reputation may fall if they say you\u2019re abusing your power\u2026\u201d\u201cMy reputation? Nothing good comes out of maintaining it.\u201d He\u2019d already experienced it all before.\u00a0When I was Specter, I was the most admired person in the world, but it didn\u2019t help one lick.\u00a0His good reputation had actually weighed him down.\u201cI can\u2019t live like that again\u2026\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he replied with his usual expression, and Cha Si-eun stared at him.\u201cJunho-nim\u2026 does it not bother you at all?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThose people tried to use you. They lifted you up when you were doing well and clamored for your attention, but they threw you away like nothing simply because you didn\u2019t come out of the Gate for three months. Doesn\u2019t that make you angry?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d He was already used to such people.\u00a0Things are good right now. It was worse when I was Specter.\u00a0If it weren\u2019t for his Hero\u2019s Mind skill, he was sure he would have some sort of panic disorder at this point. Even with the skill, he was already largely distrustful of others.\u201cPeople will swallow if something is sweet and spit it out if it\u2019s bitter. Most people care more about themselves than others and will want more gains than losses. In some ways, they\u2019re the smart ones.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Cha Si-eun looked down at the elevator floor, taken aback. \u201cIf it were me, I think I\u2019d start to ask myself why I climb the Floors for people like this\u2026\u201d she muttered.\u201cWhat?\u00a0Ahahaha!\u201d Seo Junho burst into laughter, as if she\u2019d just told a funny joke.\u201cWhy\u2026 Why are you laughing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I think there\u2019s been a misunderstanding, Secretary Cha.\u201d\u201cMisunderstanding?\u201d\u201cYes. A very big one, at that.\u201dThe elevator opened. Seo Junho got off first and gestured for her to come forward. They looked out the floor-length window. The view of Seoul\u2019s sunset from the 77th floor was breathtaking.\u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, very much so.\u201d Cha Si-eun\u2019s eyes sparkled as she approached the window. She\u2019d already come here a few times before, but she had never been able to look at the view because she was so busy.\u201c\u2018Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot.\u2019 Have you heard that quote before?\u201d\u201cYes. I believe it\u2019s from the comedian, Charlie Chaplin.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d She watched as he started to speak.\u201cWhen I first heard that, I thought of the streets.\u201d\u201cThe streets?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Seo Junho tapped on the glass. \u201cWhen you see it from afar, the world is beautiful. But if you venture into the sea of buildings\u2026 there are many problems within. But if you don\u2019t look closely, you would never know.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same for me.\u201dCha Si-eun listened carefully. She had a feeling that he was about to answer all her questions.\u201cYou probably think I\u2019m a very good and moral person, Secretary Cha.\u201d\u201c\u2026A lot of people think that. You\u2019ve helped out others so many times.\u201d He\u2019d saved dozens of people from the Cinder Fox and had minimized casualties in the Wild Forest by rallying the players together. Many people thought that he was becoming a role model for the next generation. It was rare for players to take care of others, not just themselves.\u201cSee? You don\u2019t know because you\u2019re not looking closely.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m also human. I care most about myself. Other people are secondary. I only pay attention to the people around me when I know that I can safely clear a Gate. It was probably the same for Specter and the Five Heroes that you respect so much.\u201dSociety saw the Five Heroes\u2019 deaths as divine sacrifices, but Seo Junho knew better than anyone else that it was far from the truth.We never intended to sacrifice ourselves or anything like that.Mio wielded her sword to honor her family name. Skaya hunted to reach greater heights. Rahmadat faced the Frost Queen because he wanted to fight stronger enemies. Gilbert pulled the trigger because he wanted his son to live in a peaceful world.The same was true for Seo Junho.\u2026I entered the Queen\u2019s Nest for the sake of revenge.They\u2019d all had their own reasons for fighting. But the world now considered their lives as mere sacrifices simply because \u2018they\u2019d died\u2019.It amused him. \u201cI don\u2019t climb the Floors for other people.\u201d He looked her in the eye. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite. I\u2019m climbing because I have my own goals I want to achieve. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re disappointed, because that\u2019s simply not true.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d She bit her lip and looked down at the floor for a long time. \u201cEverything you\u2019ve said is right. I should have lived like you\u2026\u201dShe\u2019d lived while placing so much importance on what other people thought of her. She\u2019d anticipated, disappointed, and doubted herself because of them. She felt so stupid that she laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t realize something so obvious. I\u2019ve been living like an idiot.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you\u2019d have a clueless side of you too.\u201d\u201cWhat was that?\u201dThe sound of laughter rang from the 77th floor hallway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It looked as if she had made a decision\u2026\u201d the Frost Queen muttered, peeking through the crack of the door as it closed.\u201cWell, I\u2019m an inspirational quote machine. She probably felt touched.\u201d\u201cYou talk as much as always.\u201d She shook her head and took her regular seat on the sofa. She hugged the remote and looked up at Seo Junho.\u201cHaa, give that to me.\u201d He was going to turn on the channel she liked, but she shook her head.\u201cNo. I can do this myself, so make some tea.\u201d She worked the remote skillfully and switched it on to the drama channel. Seo Junho stared in awe. She did it so naturally.\u201c\u2026You know how to use the remote?\u201d\u201cI am not stupid. Did you think that I would not be able to work a device of this level?\u201d\u201cThen why have you made me do it for you this whole time?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s fun.\u201d He didn\u2019t know what to say. She held up her finger to her lips. \u201cBe quiet now. It is time for me to watch my dramas.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dForget the Agarit tea. He dropped bitter ginseng into the boiling water and went back to his room. A moment later, the Frost Queen called out.\u201cContractor! This tea\u2026 tastes strange. It makes my tongue pucker.\u201d\u201cReally? It\u2019s the tea that nobles on Earth drink. Do you want something else?\u201d\u201c\u2026No. I think the taste is beginning to grow on me.\u201dShe scrunched her face as she drank the ginseng tea. Now that she was taken care of, the Frost Queen was no longer his opponent. Seo Junho checked his inbox on his Vita. There, the six messages he was waiting for appeared.[This is Silent Moon. We wish to propose\u2026][This is the mercenary guild Hallem.][The Dokkaebi Guild wishes to inquire with Seo Junho-nim\u2026][Silver Constellation\u2026][Labyrinth\u2026][Sky Soul* wishes\u2026](TN: This is likely a reference to the idiom \u201cAll human lives are in the sky\u201d, which means that fate is predetermined.)The Big 6 had responded to his proposal with Specter\u2019s name on the line.\u201cWell, I already know what they\u2019re gonna say.\u201d Still, he read them out of courtesy. They were full of long-winded rambling, but they all came to the same conclusion.[We will follow Specter-nim.]\u201cNot that they ever had a choice.\u201dWhen he got caught up in political conflicts as Specter, he\u2019d learned something important.\u201cWhen I offer a choice, I make it so that they\u2019re forced to choose what I want.\u201d It was simple but effective. Seo Junho smiled, satisfied. Even though it was temporary, he now had the six best information networks in the palm of his hand. He flopped down onto his bed and stared up at the ceiling.\u201cIt sure took a while\u2026\u201dIt had been seven months since he had broken out of the ice. The memories of the time flashed through his head.Zombies, Leufs, Cinder Fox, Nameless Dragon, Watchdogs, Dark Elves, Rome, and now, the Winter Castle\u2026\u00a0He never noticed when he was running about, but they all seemed so long ago. His seven months was probably the equivalent of several years of activities for the average player.\u201cStill, I reached level 34 after seven months\u2026 That means I\u2019m going several times faster than the past.\u201d Of course, there was no use in comparing those two eras. His previous experience as a player was immeasurably valuable.If I want to, I could go to the 2nd Floor Frontier as soon as tomorrow\u2026\u00a0Of course, he had no plans to go up\u2014whether he could or not. Now that he had access to the Big 6\u2019s information, he needed to organize the data.\u201cFirst\u2026\u201d Seo Junho skimmed their emails again. They all spoke proudly of their information networks. \u201cJust as I thought. Even though they\u2019re all part of the Big 6, they all collect different kinds of information.\u201dHe divided them into three types. \u201cHm, I suppose they\u2019re either affiliated with the royal, noble, or religious factions.\u201dThere was a large empire in the Frontier called Ruben. Most of the explored areas on the 2nd Floor were controlled by it. Guilds on the scale of the Big 6 were already deeply familiar with the empire. After all, they\u2019d worked their way up for 25 years.\u201cSilent Moon and Dokkaebi are affiliated with royalty.\u201d They\u2019d focused a lot on fostering their relationship with the royal family in order to give a positive impression and receive noble titles. As a result, these two guilds had the most nobles.And the second is the nobility.\u00a0The empire was ruled by the Emperor, but the power of the nobility couldn\u2019t be disregarded. After all, the ocean was made up of countless drops.\u00a0Labyrinth and Sky Soul are in the talks with the nobility.\u00a0They were establishing themselves by absorbing provinces. They had enough authority to compete with Dokkaebi and Silent Moon, who were affiliated with the imperial family.\u201cThe third is the religious faction. The only guild affiliated with them is Silver Constellation.\u201d There were many religions in the Frontier. Each god communicated directly with their believers and gave them divine power.Silver Constellation is building a place for themselves in the Ruben Empire\u2019s official religion: the [Church of the Sun].The Church of the Sun was just as powerful as the royalty and nobility. \u201cThe three main powers of the Empire keep each other in check\u2026\u201dThe last guild was Hallem. They were irrelevant to the others. \u201cThey\u2019re a mercenary guild. They\u2019ve already claimed a territory and started cultivating it.\u201d They didn\u2019t even need to worry about vested rights. 25 years after their founding, the mercenary guild was quickly gaining newfound power. They used to be easily overlooked, but they were quite famous now and carried out their activities all over the Empire.It might not be the best quality, but they\u2019ll be able to get me a variety of information the fastest.\u00a0Seo Junho finished organizing his thoughts and closed his eyes.\u201cHm, then\u2026 let\u2019s give them a test.\u201d Which guild would get him information the fastest? Seo Junho smiled and wrote up an email.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Knock, knock.Dokkaebi\u2019s Guildmaster, Shin Sunghyun, spoke without looking up. \u201cCome in. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked, his eyes still fixed on the documents he was working on.\u201cSpecter responded.\u201dHis hand stopped.\u00a0It\u2019s been around three months since we received his proposal.\u00a0Specter had finally replied.He finally looked up at the messenger. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\u201cHe requested that we gather information about the fiends and send them to him. The time limit was thirty minutes.\u201d\u201cAn easy request. Send him all the information that\u2019s mid-rank and below.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. But\u2026\u201d The messenger hesitated before speaking. \u201cI believe that the other guilds have received the same request.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d\u201cThe other guild messengers rode in the elevator with me to the 2nd Floor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe 2nd Floor didn\u2019t have internet, so they couldn\u2019t communicate directly with the 1st Floor. To take care of the issue, each guild always had members on standby in the Dimensional Elevator. Messengers delivered information between the Floors.\u201cHm. So that means Specter has requested information from the other guilds as well.\u201d Shin Sunghyun gave an amused smile and spun the pen in his hand.\u00a0So he wants us to compete.It was easy to see why. Specter was probably primarily concerned that the guilds would communicate and restrict the information they would give him\u2014and he was right to be worried. He had given them three months, which was plenty of time for the Guildmasters to meet and discuss. They had decided to give him mid-rank information and below.But Specter had sent the request to the Big 6 at the same time. Shin Sunghyun could only see one reason as to why he would do that.\u2026He already expected that we would be cooperating. So he\u2019s going to compare our information.\u00a0Since they\u2019d already come to an agreement, there wouldn\u2019t be much difference between the information they gave him. Ironically, giving him the same amount and level of information would still reveal what he wanted.If that happens and he compares the information we give him, he\u2019ll be able to see which guild has the best information network.But there was another interesting factor that came into play. If one guild\u2019s information was far worse than the others, they would likely be kicked out. In other words, he would only work with the useful ones. Considering Specter\u2019s previous display, it wouldn\u2019t be unlike him to do that.\u201cHaa, really\u2026 His arrogance knows no limits.\u201d But even if they didn\u2019t want to, they had no other choice but to follow him.As guilds grew in size, they started to prioritize quality over quantity. The standards for each player kept growing.\u00a0And talented people won\u2019t join guilds with bad reputations.\u00a0No matter how many benefits they offered, that wouldn\u2019t change.But Specter\u2019s second condition was greatly beneficial for the guilds. They would easily be able to shake off the smaller guilds that were always chasing after them. Their guild\u2019s reputation would improve without them having to spend a single penny.\u201cSo\u2026 I suppose it turned out for the better.\u201dLike the other Big 6 Guildmasters, Shin Sunghyun was proud of his information network.\u00a0Our guild\u2019s is one of the best\u2014even among the Big 6.If he broke the promise with the other guilds and gave Specter higher-level information, the others would pale in comparison. He wasn\u2019t stupid.Six guilds is too many for him to work with.Shin Sunghyun made his decision. If things proceeded as planned, Dokkaebi would be the only guild that would end up working with Specter.\u201cGive him everything except classified and top-secret information.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 does that mean I should give him everything from the lowest to high-rank information?\u201d\u201cYes, everything.\u201d\u201cY-yes, sir!\u201d As the startled messenger left the room, he went back to his documents. A satisfied smile curled at his lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He smiled, satisfied.The Big 6 were the strongest out of the tens of thousands of guilds that existed. Their leaders weren\u2019t stupid; even Seo Junho knew that much.So he put himself in their shoes. It had taken him much longer to clear the Winter Castle than he\u2019d expected. Three months was a long time, which gave the Big 6 plenty of time to meet up and come to an agreement. He was 100% sure that they\u2019d decided on the level of information they would send him and took full advantage of that.If he made it look like he was testing their competence, the greedy executives would catch on and send higher-grade information than they promised in order to stand out from the other guilds.And thus, these were the results.\u201cHeh, the Guildmasters must be rolling in their graves.\u201dIt had never been a test in the first place. He\u2019d simply decided that this was the best way to get as much information as possible. Thanks to that, he now had information that couldn\u2019t even be bought. He\u2019d also compared them to the Association\u2019s data that Deokgu had given him, but the Big 6 was clearly superior.\u201cYou guys still have a long way to go.\u201d He laughed as he thought about the Big 6 Guildmasters with all the information before him.* * *Starting the next day, Seo Junho and the Frost Queen went straight to work. Seo Junho started to memorize the information while the Frost Queen binged dramas and movies.\u201c\u2026Why does it feel like I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s working?\u201d Seo Junho muttered.The Frost Queen looked up from her kernel of caramel popcorn, which was a little smaller than her fist. \u201cWhat nonsense.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re just playing around while I\u2019m studying.\u201d\u201cI am studying as well.\u201dPew!

Even though he\u2019d spent the entire afternoon studying, the pages didn\u2019t seem to decrease.The amount of documents he had were enough to make an encyclopedia. \u201cIt\u2019ll take me at least four days to get through all this\u2026\u201dHis mind and body were exhausted, but his heart was strong.\u00a0The Big 6\u2019s information network is super impressive.\u00a0He felt sorry for Deokgu, but the Association\u2019s network wasn\u2019t even comparable.He was currently reading about Duke Yulin in <Power Dynamics in the Ruben Empire>. Even though a Duke was an important figure, the Association only knew his name, status, and duties. On the other hand, Silent Moon\u2019s report included his personality, relationships, family members, political weaknesses, and even his personal tastes.\u201cWe can\u2019t compete with this\u2026\u201d Seo Junho laughed bitterly. It was like watching a child trying to compete with an adult. He let out a frustrated sigh and kept reading.I don\u2019t know about the rest, but I have to memorize everything about the nobility.The Frontier was different from Earth. Specter was a hero that saved Earth and Seo Junho was a rising star, but they would be newbies in the Frontier.\u201cI wonder what kind of place it\u2019ll be\u2026\u201d Just thinking about it made him smile.He\u2019d decided.

Shim Deokgu looked up. \u201cCome in.\u201dHis eyes widened as he saw who it was. \u201cMiss Cha Si-eun? What brings you here?\u201dHe was confused by her sudden visit. The only time she\u2019d ever come to the President\u2019s office was the day she was hired.\u201cI had something to tell you.\u201d She bowed politely, and Shim Deokgu hurriedly led her to a seat. He took out two cans of orange juice and sat down on the sofa.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYes, of course. What do you wish to tell me? Did Seo Junho send you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. She reached into her jacket and pulled out an envelope. Shim Deokgu laughed nervously.\u201cI don\u2019t see why you\u2019d want to bribe me\u2026 Is this what I think it is?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s a letter of resignation.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d He cleared his throat and began again. \u201cPlease tell me if I or anyone else in the Association has made you uncomfortable. I\u2019ll try to fix it.\u201d\u201cNo! It\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d\u201cThen, is Seo Junho bothering you\u2026?\u201d If that were the case, he\u2019d go and strangle him.Cha Si-eun smiled faintly and shook her head. \u201cNo. On the contrary, I always feel indebted because he treats me so well.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s the reason?\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you happen to remember the first time I came here?\u201d\u201cOf course I do.\u201d It had been one of the most memorable days ever since he became President.\u201cI felt like something was broken inside of me.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cI had no goals or aims when I came here.\u201d\u201cIt was raining a lot that day, wasn\u2019t it? You were completely drenched. To be frank, I was a little scared of you.\u201dThey chuckled as they reminisced.\u201cPresident, you know how much I respect Specter-nim.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never told you this, but I respect you as much as I do him.\u201d\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m honored.\u201d Shim Deokgu was genuinely surprised by her words.\u201cYou were the only person who helped me when I was struggling. The only reason I came here was because I wanted to work under you. I always admired how you tried to improve how players were treated.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 I feel embarrassed by all your compliments.\u201d He scratched his neck. Cha Si-eun smiled as she continued.\u201cI had a short conversation with Seo Junho-nim yesterday. He gave me a lot of good advice, and I feel like someone had hit my head with a hammer.\u201d\u201cWhat in the world did he say?\u201d\u201cHe spoke with the same confidence and determination that he always does. But\u2026 it helped me realize a lot of things. I realized how childish my thinking had been.\u201d\u201cOf course not. You\u2019re one of the most mature people I know.\u201d\u201cThank you. Anyways, after I spoke to him, I went home and thought for a long time about what had motivated me before.\u201dShim Deokgu nodded quietly. The sparkle in her eyes was similar to Seo Junho\u2019s.\u00a0Those are the eyes of someone who knows what they want and where to get it.\u201cCongratulations. You\u2019ve finally found your path.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201d\u201cMay I ask what you plan to do?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing big,\u201d she said shyly, staring at her orange juice. \u201cI want to try again\u2014with a different mindset from before.\u201d\u201cFor yourself, rather than others?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite selfish, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cOf course not. Actually, I wish you\u2019d be more selfish.\u201dCha Si-eun looked grateful as she fiddled with the ring on her hand. \u201cI wish to work under Junho-nim until he advances to the 2nd Floor. Please keep our conversation a secret.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026 can I return this artifact when I resign?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\u201cNo. I was always worried because you looked like you were trapped. I\u2019m glad that you want to spread your wings again.\u201d His words were sincere. Shim Deokgu looked at the Magic Sealing Ring on Cha Si-eun\u2019s finger. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll be hearing about the Schumern Saintess again soon enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026P-please don\u2019t tease me.\u201dSeveral years ago, there had been a famous healer in the Schumern region in the 2nd Floor. She had lived her whole life helping others. But when she truly needed aid, no player or guild had answered her call.They even manipulated her so that they could make money.\u00a0The only one that had helped her in earnest had been Shim Deokgu. He hadn\u2019t even been able to do that properly because the Korean Player Association had no influence on the 2nd Floor.\u00a0She retired after that, full of betrayal and regret.That day, it had rained as if a hole had pierced through the sky.He gave her a big smile and took her letter of resignation. \u201cCongratulations on your return, Player Cha Si-eun.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She likes to watch TV?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all she ever does. All day.\u201d He spoke like a parent and sighed as he tapped his Vita. \u201cI came to say hi and give you these.\u201d\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Deokgu studied the six hologram files before him. \u201c\u2018History of Religions\u2019\u2026 \u2018Frontier Monsters\u2019\u2026 \u2018Important Families and Nobles\u2019\u2026?\u201d He suddenly realized what he was looking at. He scrolled through the documents and checked the name of each file. \u201cWhat the hell are these?\u201d\u201cCopies of reports from six amazing, greatest, legendary guilds.\u201d\u201cThe Big 6?! Why did they give you all this?\u201d\u201cOh, did I not tell you?\u201d Seo Junho explained the contract he\u2019d made.\u201c\u2026Wow, you\u2019re one sneaky bastard. I bet you\u2019d be able to sell handwarmers in the desert.\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019d sell ice cream in Antarctica too.\u201d He jutted his chin toward the hologram.Deokgu sighed as he finished skimming them. \u201cI thought we\u2019d caught up by a lot, but we still have a long way to go.\u201d\u201cWell, at least you have a concrete goal. That\u2019ll keep you motivated. How\u2019s the Association doing?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been recruiting players on the 2nd Floor, and we\u2019ve reorganized our information structure.\u201d\u201cGood. A different approach could be better. How is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s whatever. Most guilds train in remote areas. Well\u2026 all the main cities have been taken over, so it\u2019s a bit of a hindrance.\u201d He sounded frustrated.\u201cWell, they\u2019ve been at it for 25 years. We can\u2019t catch up in one day.\u201d If they wanted to, they\u2019d have to achieve something great enough to make up for the lost time. \u201cWe could make a big contribution to a war\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy. The empire controls most of the Frontier. It doesn\u2019t have any enemies.\u201d\u201cYou never know.\u201d Seo Junho shrugged.He leaned in\u2014face strangely serious. \u201cDeokgu. I\u2019m going to the 2nd Floor in a week.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d Deokgu swallowed. He\u2019d expected this since the day his friend woke up and decided to become a player again. And yet, he still couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit sad.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. If I\u2019d just expanded our influence a bit\u2026 we would\u2019ve been able to support you on the 2nd Floor.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough for me already.\u201d He meant it. If Deokgu hadn\u2019t pushed him physically and mentally and hadn\u2019t helped as much as he had, it would\u2019ve been much harder for Seo Junho to return. \u201cThanks to you, I have a new reputation and player license. You gave me all that equipment and a house. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to grow this fast if it weren\u2019t for you. It was more than I could ask for.\u201d\u201cBastard\u2026\u201d Deokgu\u2019s chest tightened. His friend was going to fight in a place he couldn\u2019t reach. It would be a lonely journey. He didn\u2019t even have his former comrades.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. And if I meet Arthur, I\u2019ll tell him the news.\u201d\u201cOh, I almost forgot. Take this.\u201d He pulled out a piece of paper. On it was an unfamiliar town and address. \u201cThis is where he lives. Go find him and help him out, won\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cOoh, thanks.\u201d Seo Junho took it into his hands.\u201cBut\u2026 are you gonna go to him as Seo Junho\u2026 or as Specter?\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d It was a good question. The Five Heroes and Shim Deokgu had all cared for Arthur, but he\u2019d only been three years old back then.\u201d\u201c\u2026He probably won\u2019t remember my face, right?\u201d\u201cIf he did, he would\u2019ve contacted you already. You\u2019re always on the news.\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201d Seo Junho looked down at the memo. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\u201cDo what you think is best.\u201dTheir conversation ended there, and Seo Junho stood. \u201cI\u2019m off. I have to memorize all the information the Big 6 gave me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go too far.\u201dHe left the office and went down to the first floor to buy some energy drinks and onigiri. He would need something to help him get through the night.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *A man sat on the roof of a building as he downed his bread and milk. He wore a thick hoodie as he looked out into the Seoul nightscape.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTo be exact, he was looking at the entrance of the Player Association building, 5 kilometers away. The man with keen eyesight was none other than Kal Signer.\u201cDammit, I already made sure he left the Gate.\u201dLast night, the internet had exploded with the news that Seo Junho had cleared the Gate and gone back to the Association. Of course, Signer had been suspicious at first. But once he saw photographic proof, he was sure.Ever since then, he\u2019d been waiting on the roof.\u00a0I looked all over while he was gone for three months. This is the best location.\u00a0If Seo Junho left the building, he\u2019d see immediately.\u201cDammit\u2026\u201d Signer scowled. He hadn\u2019t been living like a proper human for the last few months, so he was filthy all over.It couldn\u2019t be helped. Unlike the Frontier, he couldn\u2019t go about as he pleased\u2014especially in a country with so many CCTVs.\u201cSeo Junho\u2026 If I can just catch him\u2026\u201dHe\u2019d be able to live luxuriously as a fiend again.The temperature had started to drop, prickling his skin. \u201c\u2026Finally.\u201dHis eyes filled with joy. He\u2019d watched this scene play out in his dreams countless times.Seo Junho.His target stepped out of the building with a mask on.\u201cYou can\u2019t fool my eyes with such a weak disguise.\u201d He cackled as he leapt off the roof and started running toward Seo Junho.* * *\u201cThat\u2019ll be 19,400 won.\u201d\u201cHow much are the Sweet \u2018n Sours?\u201d(TN: Korean candy similar to Hi-Chew.)\u201c1,000 won.\u201d\u201cGeez, the inflation\u2019s gone up a lot.\u201d He bought the candy and walked out of the convenience store.A stray cat near the entrance looked up at him with big eyes, purring.\u201cI didn\u2019t get anything for you.\u201d As soon as he said that, it walked away into an alley with an unsteady gait.\u201cEven cats are smart nowadays.\u201d He smiled and turned back toward the Association.Suddenly, he heard a cat yowl.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d He turned around and tapped his Vita as he walked toward the alley. He used the flashlight app to scan the area.Blood!\u00a0The cat was trembling on the ground as it bled out. As he ran toward it, he sensed someone\u2019s presence behind him.Shing!\u00a0He pulled out Black Dragon Fang in an instant and pointed it at the stranger.\u201cWhoa, whoa, calm down.\u201d The man was wearing a thick hoodie, and his voice was even. There was a stench about him, but his feet were light.He\u2019s a player. A strong one, at that.\u00a0Seo Junho\u2019s eyes narrowed. A dark alleyway with a bleeding cat, and a suspicious person that blocked the way. This could only mean one thing.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cWow, you catch on quick. You\u2019re not like the other newbies.\u201d He chuckled as a large bow appeared in his hands, blood-red and maroon. \u201cShall we go somewhere more suitable? I don\u2019t think you want to fight here either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Seo Junho pulled out a potion from his inventory and poured it on the cat. It didn\u2019t heal it completely, but the cat purred as it ran away in the opposite direction.He turned back to the stranger. \u201cFinal Horizon. It was originally meant for sniping.\u201d\u201cImpressive.\u201d The man seemed amused. He didn\u2019t think that any 1st Floor player, let alone Seo Junho, would recognize his weapon.\u201cAs the name implies, it\u2019s a Unique-grade bow that can hit a target at the end of the horizon\u2026 You must have made a mistake. You can\u2019t create enough distance, and you appeared right in front of your opponent.\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019d normally be correct.\u201d It would be stupid to do that if the enemy was as strong as he was. But Signer thought that he\u2019d be able to beat the likes of Seo Junho even in close combat.He jutted his chin. \u201cYou should move while I\u2019m being nice. If you don\u2019t want other people to die, that is.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be good for himself either. It wouldn\u2019t matter if his mission was to kill Seo Junho, but he was supposed to capture him.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d It was strange that the notorious Kal Signer was making such a proposal. There was a reason why he couldn\u2019t attack carelessly.Well, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0His inventory hummed as if one of the weapons were laughing.\u00a0I think I\u2019ll be able to fulfill my promise faster than I thought, Tushar Vishi.He lowered his sword. \u201cLead the way. I\u2019ll let you choose your grave.\u201d\u201cHah. Follow me.\u201d Kal Signer snorted as he started to dash forward. Seo Junho followed close behind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The moon shined down on the rooftops, where two men were running.Kal Signer kept looking behind him to make sure Seo Junho wasn\u2019t trying to run away.\u2026This is unexpected.\u00a0His face soured as he turned back around. Seo Junho was following him much better than he\u2019d expected.\u00a0I thought I\u2019d need to slow down for him, but I suppose I don\u2019t need to.Either he had underestimated him, or Seo Junho was wearing himself out while trying to keep up.Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the latter.\u00a0Seo Junho\u2019s posture, steps, and even breaths were enough to tell him as much.\u00a0Well, he broke Specter\u2019s record after all. And he has a star*, which is a prerequisite for joining the Nine Heavens. I should be more careful.\u00a0After clearing the Winter Castle, he had become the only player on the 1st Floor to get a star.But Signer thought Seo Junho was foolish for trying to make him nervous. No matter how talented he might be, Seo Junho would be the one fighting for his life.The hardware\u2019s good, but his software\u2019s lacking.\u00a0People like him were easy to deal with.After all, he was the infamous Demon Bow who had killed countless players.\u201cThis is good enough.\u201d They\u2019d left the city behind for a secluded area about halfway up a mountain.(TN: In case you don\u2019t know, Korea is very mountainous.)He turned around. \u201cYou\u2019re impressive.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, you didn\u2019t try to run away and followed me until the end. Second, you didn\u2019t try anything stupid.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI was watching you the whole time to make sure you wouldn\u2019t contact other players through your Vita.\u201d\u201cWere you scared I\u2019d call up some friends?\u201d\u201cOf course not. Things would just get more troublesome.\u201d Signer reached into his inventory and pulled out a pair of handcuffs. \u201cI\u2019ll give you two choices. You can either come quietly and let me put these magic-blocking cuffs on you, or\u2026\u201dHe released a tiny amount of magic coiled inside his body. A powerful gust blew through, kicking up dirt and bending the trees.The simple act of releasing magic twisted the area around him. This was the power of a level 100 ranker.\u201c\u2026You\u2019ll come with me with your legs cut off, crawling like a dog.\u201d\u201cWhere are you planning to take me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need to answer. Choose.\u201d He stared sharply at Seo Junho, leaving no room for compromise.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Seo Junho thought for a second and held up three fingers. \u201cI like the third option the best.\u201d\u201cThere are only two choices. There is no third.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because your brain\u2019s too small to see it.\u201dSigner raised an eyebrow, annoyed. He let out a resigned sigh and put the handcuffs away. \u201cHumans are so pitiful. They always need sense beaten into them. So, what would the third option be?\u201d\u201cWell, we\u2019re in a remote mountain. I\u2019ll just bury you here.\u201d\u201cHa, you have a good imagination.\u201d He snorted before moving.In the blink of an eye, six arrows had been fired at Seo Junho. Signer lowered his bow.\u00a0There\u2019s no way he could\u2019ve dodged or blocked that.He opened his inventory again, getting ready to leave. No matter how remote this area was, he had to be careful about letting him scream.But he was wrong. Seo Junho had cut every single arrow with Black Dragon Fang. Cut perfectly in half, twelve fragments laid on the ground.\u201c\u2026!\u201d Signer was frozen in shock. He looked down at the broken arrows. \u201c\u2026Well, he\u00a0does\u00a0have a star.\u201dBefore, Signer had thought that Seo Junho was just a lucky newbie. But that had changed once he met him in person. He was lucky\u00a0and\u00a0skilled. That was how Signer had judged him about half an hour ago, but he revised his opinion once more.Okay, let\u2019s say that it was possible for him to follow me.\u00a0Signer hadn\u2019t been using his full power, so it was possible. But cutting down his arrows was a completely different story.\u2026Is this possible with luck alone?No. No matter how much he thought about it, it was impossible.He shook his head. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Yet it had happened right before his eyes. \u201cHaha\u2026\u201dHe was so dumbfounded that he started to cackle. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d To his knowledge, no such person could exist.It hasn\u2019t even been a year since he debuted\u2026 And yet, he was able to cut down six of my arrows?\u201cWell, I get why you\u2019re confused,\u201d Seo Junho said, unconcerned.\u201cHumans all have the same fundamental limits. It\u2019s common sense. They can\u2019t fly like birds. They eat when they\u2019re hungry. If they don\u2019t breathe, they die.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019ve surpassed that.\u201dKal Signer\u2019s understanding was starting to fall apart. Everyone knew that a level 30 player couldn\u2019t defeat a level 100 player.\u201cWhat can you do? There are things in this world that surpass common sense.\u201d Seo Junho patted his chest. \u201cLike me.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d Signer let out a short breath and nodded. \u201cI acknowledge my mistake. You\u2019re talented. You broke Specter\u2019s record and even cleared a 1-star Gate on your own. Your skill is great and undeniable.\u201dThere was probably no one stronger than him on the 1st Floor. And if he went up to the 2nd Floor, he\u2019d grow even faster. He had the potential to even become a high-ranker. And if, by chance, he was still stronger than what Signer now thought\u2026He\u2019ll join the ranks of the Nine Heavens.He didn\u2019t want to admit it, but that was Seo Junho\u2019s \u2018potential\u2019 and \u2018possibility\u2019.What a waste.\u00a0In the end, none of that would happen. If only he hadn\u2019t come to Las Vegas, his bright future would still be in front of him.\u201cThis will hurt, but I won\u2019t kill you,\u201d he warned.Signer released his magic, bringing a powerful gust that blew his hood back and whipped his hair.Is he gonna infuse the arrows with magic?\u00a0Seo Junho raised his sword, grip tightening. No matter what attack came, he was ready to receive it.Signer whispered as he drew his bowstring. \u201cRip him to shreds, darters*.\u201d(TN: A type of freshwater fish. The hanja literally reads as \u2018arrow fish\u2019.)In the blink of an eye, twelve arrows flew toward him, and Seo Junho swung his sword to cut them.\u201c\u2026?!\u201d However, the arrows dodged his strikes, changing direction as if they were alive. They \u2018swam\u2019 through the air like fish.I see. Darters\u2026 They\u2019re fish arrows?\u00a0He had to admit that it was an impressive technique. Of course, the arrows weren\u2019t actually alive.\u00a0Signer must be controlling them carefully with his magic.But Signer drew his bowstring once more. \u201cWelcome to my ocean.\u201dHe fired 12 more arrows. There were now a total of 24.Signer\u2019s magic started to scream inside him, pressing against his body.\u00a0\u2026It\u2019s heavy.Seo Junho\u2019s head started to spin.\u00a0Dammit, they\u2019re all over the place.\u00a0When fighting an archer, you usually only needed to focus on the direction the arrow was coming from and the straight line it followed. But the Demon Bow\u2019s arrows were different. The arrows attack from all directions imaginable. And that wasn\u2019t all. Aura started to spin around each arrowhead. If he was hit in the arm by one arrow, it would rip right through his shoulder.They\u2019re fast too.\u00a0The air screamed every time they zipped through the air.\u201cNo matter how beautiful a flower is, it doesn\u2019t matter if it never blooms.\u201d No matter how talented Seo Junho was, he was still a mere sprout. \u201cSince I\u2019ve taught you a lesson, I\u2019ll take those legs in exchange.\u201dThe darters all shot at him at once.Booster!\u00a0The heat from his body made the cool mountain air sweltering, but Seo Junho began his sword dance nonetheless. He moved slower than usual because of the disturbance in his magic, and the arrows pushed him and his sword back. But he didn\u2019t let his concentration break and continued to slash at every darter that came at him.Faster.\u00a0Seo Junho quickly adjusted to the speed of Signer\u2019s attack. The darters were fast, but so was his sword.Not enough. Faster.\u00a0The darters chased him relentlessly, coming at him from ten different directions.\u201cHup!\u201dHe threw his body, rolled on the ground, and hid behind trees as he took them out, but he grew faster still.Faster. Faster. Faster.His eyes started to glow. And with his sword, he deflected an arrow.The darter ripped through the mountain as it hit the bottom, creating a small crater. It was as if a dragon had run through.\u201c\u2026He hit it?\u201d Signer scowled. He looked down at his hand.\u00a0Am I unconsciously going too easy on him?No, that wasn\u2019t it. He was using his full power to try and cut off Seo Junho\u2019s legs.Then how?\u00a0Seo Junho was talented, but so was he. Not only that, Signer\u2019s skills had already bloomed.\u00a0But\u2026 I can\u2019t hit him.\u00a0Usually, the darters would tear through their target like piranhas, but they were being cut apart.If his arrows were fish, then Seo Junho was a shark. He\u2019d already started to get the hang of it. Every time he swung his sword, the darters would fall to the ground in pieces, and Signer couldn\u2019t infuse his magic into broken arrows.They\u2019re decreasing.\u00a0The fish in the sky were starting to fall, one by one. He couldn\u2019t do anything but stare until only one was left.That, too, was killed.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe felt hazy, as if he had just woken up from a dream, or as if he were drunk and dizzy.\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d He nodded at Seo Junho, who was breathing heavily. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky, but you\u2019re no novice.\u201dHe was a player. A player that Signer would have to risk his life to kill. \u201c\u2026It\u2019s been too long. My senses have dulled.\u201dKal Signer closed his eyes. It had been over half a year since he\u2019d had a proper battle because Kim Woojoong was chasing him, and as a result, he had gotten rusty.It was a good thing he realized it before it was too late. Signer let go of all the arrogance and preconception.\u201c\u2026\u201d When he opened his eyes, they were burning crimson.Seo Junho had never seen eyes that were so blood-red.\u00a0Is this\u2026 the power of the Demon Bow, the symbol of fear on the 2nd Floor?He swallowed. All the magic within Signer had morphed into Demonic energy. The feeling made him shiver.Was I too arrogant?\u00a0The magic storm that had kicked up had all but disappeared, but that only made him more nervous.The wind only\u00a0sounded\u00a0dangerous. The truly powerful storms were silent.\u201cYou should feel honored.\u201dSigner drew Final Horizon.\u201cStorm Dragon\u2019s Arrow.\u201dWhen he let go, a ferocious dragon swallowed the earth around them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kal Signer might not know, but the fact that Seo Junho even considered it was impressive.\u2026No, I can\u2019t.\u00a0He quickly realized that he couldn\u2019t. The Storm Dragon flew closer and closer.\u00a0It\u2019s too fast. Even if I move now, one of my arms or legs will get hit.That meant he had to block the powerful attack. Seo Junho\u2019s eyebrows furrowed, but he already knew the answer.I\u2019m an idiot.\u00a0He\u2019d been too careless. His stats were equal to a level 100 player\u2019s, and after he cleared the Cave of Trials and the Proof of Knighthood, he\u2019d gotten too cocky.Get it together, Seo Junho.\u00a0He was no longer the strongest person in the world, and he wasn\u2019t the only one who thought that. But deep down, he must have been clinging onto the glory of the past.How could I defeat a high ranker without even using my full strength?\u00a0He already had two skills that no one else had: Watchguard of Darkness and Frost. But how could he defeat the Demon Bow without them?I really have to get it together. I was way too reckless.\u00a0He acknowledged his arrogance. He felt ashamed for showing such a weak side to a formidable opponent.\u201c\u2026Phew.\u201d He looked past the Storm Dragon and at the fiend with a dark expression and burning eyes.He\u2019s trying his best to kill me\u2026\u00a0And yet the weaker of the two had underestimated him. Seo Junho couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at himself.His current Magic stat was 150 and had been 183 when he was Specter. It was overwhelmingly powerful. As he raised his hand, his magic burst out.\u201cExplode.\u201dAll the magic within him released at once, creating hundreds of icicles. Enough to shred Kal Signer\u2019s dragon into pieces.\u201c\u2026?!\u201d Kal Signer\u2019s face fell as he felt the heavy surge of magic. Something was wrong.Then, hundreds of icicles dug into the dragon\u2019s body before Signer could even shout.\u201c\u2026Ice?\u201d he whispered, staring up at the spikes floating in the air. He finally processed what had happened.\u00a0The Storm Dragon\u2019s Arrow\u2026 exploded? Why is there ice?\u00a0His questions only brought on more questions before he arrived at an answer.\u201c\u2026Seo Junho was hiding his abilities?\u201d There was no other explanation. What was more shocking was that he\u2019d been able to break through his most powerful technique. \u201cImpossible\u2026\u201dIn the span of an hour, he\u2019d seen too many things that shouldn\u2019t have been possible. But first, he had to complete his mission.\u00a0I have to take back control and create distance between us.He felt pathetic, but it would be dangerous to continue like this. Signer turned around and started to run. It would be a funny scene to anyone else\u2014the Demon Bow running away from a level 34 newbie.Is he trying to create distance?\u00a0Seo Junho\u2019s eyes narrowed as he watched him flee. He wouldn\u2019t let him go like this.\u00a0Archers are harder to deal with when they\u2019re further away.\u00a0Even more so with the Demon Bow. If he couldn\u2019t reach him in time, he\u2019d be sniped.\u201cCurtain of Darkness.\u201d Seo Junho clenched his fist as darkness covered them both. Signer was caught by surprise and whipped around. There was nowhere left to run.\u201cI can just cut through it!\u201d He pulled out a sword from his inventory and infused it with Demonic energy as he slashed at the curtain. It made a loud ripping sound, but it didn\u2019t leave a single scratch.\u201cIt\u2019s no use. I didn\u2019t make it easy to escape.\u201dKal Signer turned around at the sound of Seo Junho\u2019s voice, glaring. \u201cWho are you?\u201dHe could understand the ice skill. In fact, it was better that he\u2019d been hiding a skill rather than some unexplainable power. He\u2019d even let out a sigh of relief when Seo Junho used the ice skill because it meant that he\u2019d been pushed into a corner. Signer grew confident knowing that he\u2019d be able to kill him if he could just create distance between them.But Seo Junho had two elements\u2014and one of them was Specter\u2019s. The Ice element was rare enough, but the Darkness almost made him yelp in surprise.\u00a0The Fiend Association has been trying to create it for decades\u2026\u00a0They\u2019d even founded Paradise to try to reproduce it, albeit unsuccessfully.\u201cWho are you? What are you planning?\u201d Signer judged that Seo Junho wasn\u2019t working alone because it was impossible for one person to have two elemental skills\u2014let alone one of Ice and Darkness.\u201cI already told you. I break the rules of the world.\u201dBut Seo Junho\u2019s face was grim. He hadn\u2019t wanted to use Watchguard of Darkness. If he left Specter\u2019s traces behind, it was possible that some skill could discover his identity.It was too late now that he\u2019d used his skill. There was only one thing left to do.\u201cI can\u2019t let a witness live.\u201d He had to kill Kal Signer here. His eyes were cold enough to make even the fiend shiver.\u201cSo you won\u2019t tell me who you are.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only fair. You wouldn\u2019t tell me where you were going to take me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Fine. I\u2019ll\u00a0make\u00a0you talk.\u201dKal Signer pulled out a new bow from his inventory. As he drew back the string, dozens of arrows formed, all of them filled with Demonic energy.\u201cRain Arrows!\u201dAs they shot into the air, the arrows came in a downpour, multiplying into the thousands.\u201cNo matter how fast you are, you can\u2019t dodge the rain.\u201d The arrows he used weren\u2019t tedious like the darters, nor were they fierce like the Storm Dragon\u2019s Arrow. They were normal arrows infused with Demonic energy, but there were thousands of them.\u00a0He\u2019ll be able to block it if he focuses on defense, but he won\u2019t be able to reach me if he does.In other words, he was buying time to prepare for a big attack. Storm Dragon\u2019s Arrow hadn\u2019t worked, and he didn\u2019t have a technique stronger than that. His next attack would have to be a primitive onslaught.\u201cOpen inventory.\u201dKal Signer\u2019s second nickname was \u2018The Collector\u2019. Bows, crossbows, ballistas, and even automatic cannons filled the air. Every type of arrow-wielding weapon surrounded him, numbering 142 in total.\u201cIf I can\u2019t kill you with a technique, I\u2019ll overwhelm you with numbers.\u201d Signer steeled himself as his face scrunched in pain\u2014142 bowstrings slowly being pulled back. \u201cI\u2019ll finish this with one strike.\u201d* * *How many damn arrows is that?\u00a0Seo Junho\u2019s eyebrows furrowed as he looked up at the sky. The sound of the multiplying arrows was reminiscent of rain.\u00a0He\u2019s trying to corner me.\u00a0It was obviously a distraction. Signer\u2019s weapons caught his eye.\u201cSo, is this how a collector fights?\u201d He sighed, but his neck was covered in cold sweat. The bow that Signer just used had the ability to multiply its arrows, which meant that there were over a hundred weapons with similar skills he didn\u2019t know of. The best way to deal with this would be to kill Signer before the weapons fired.\u201cBooster,\u201d he whispered. His body was already as hot as burning coals. If this took too long, his brain would fry before he could reach his enemy.But I don\u2019t have enough time to block all the arrows first.\u00a0Signer had the advantage of time. Seo Junho had to reach him no matter what. But if he dashed forward without a plan, thousands of arrows would pierce through him until he resembled a porcupine. He had to run forward while blocking them at the same time.As soon as he kicked off the ground, the world around him blurred. Immediately after, arrows soared toward his head.Please, hold\u2026!\u00a0Thousands of arrows fell on his ice shield like rain, but it started to crack after a few dozen hits. Seo Junho gritted his teeth, but he didn\u2019t let his concentration slip. Right before it shattered, he created another shield with his free hand and covered his head so that not a single arrow could get through.\u201cYou fucking monster!\u201d Signer cursed. His usually smug face became uneasy as Seo Junho came closer and closer.\u00a0Dammit, I\u2019m not ready yet\u2026\u00a0If he had ten\u2014no, seven seconds, he\u2019d be able to strike, but Seo Junho looked like he would reach him in five.\u201cTsk.\u201d He would have to use the 62 weapons that were ready. He felt like his head was about to explode from controlling so much Demonic energy, but he closed his eyes and raised his hand.\u201cDie!\u201dIt seemed like ages ago that he\u2019d been ordered by Nazad Hallow to kill Seo Junho. If he went easy on him now, he would die.When the arrows released, it sounded like an entire army had fired. They rained down like petals.Flower Rain.\u00a0It was a technique that covered the entire field with arrows. It looked beautiful from afar, but to its victims, it looked like hell.(TN: Lit. name is \u2018Full Sky Flower Rain\u2019.)\u201cYou can\u2019t block this.\u201d All the bows in his collection were Rare and Unique, and they had the effects to match. Fire arrows, illusory arrows, exploding arrows\u2026 Even a single ability was tedious. There were 72 of them and hundreds of arrows along with the ones already falling. There was no escape.\u201cYou won\u2019t even leave a corpse behind.\u201d Signer smiled wickedly. He looked at Seo Junho, expecting his face to be dark with despair.\u201c\u2026What?\u201d His face fell. \u201cWhy\u2026 Why are you smiling?\u201dSeo Junho was smiling just like Signer had. He stood straight and set his shoulders as he looked up at the arrows. His magic wavered and wrapped around him like yarn.I was waiting for this.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t use the skill carelessly because it consumed so much magic, and he hadn\u2019t used it yet in the battle. He waited for the moment that Signer thought he was inevitably dead and let down his guard.\u201cShadow step.\u201dSeo Junho\u2019s body melted into darkness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And, as with other surprise attacks, it couldn\u2019t be used twice. But on the other hand, that meant that it was extremely effective the first time.This is my stage.\u00a0The darkness around him gave him plenty of places to go. As Curtain of Darkness started to unravel, Seo Junho moved, appearing right behind Kal Signer. He thrusted Black Dragon Fang toward his heart.But Signer sensed his presence and turned, blocking it with his hand.\u201c\u2026!\u201d It cut through his wrist, but he did not scream. In fact, he held out his injured arm toward Seo Junho.\u00a0Does he not know that he was hit?He didn\u2019t expect there to be any danger because he\u2019d already cut off his hand. But he noticed a second too late that a red hand had emerged from the stump.\u201cThe fucking demon clan techniques!\u201dA large, sharp fingertip shredded through the space where Seo Junho had just been standing. He barely managed to dodge as he rolled on the ground.\u201cI\u2019m surprised. I didn\u2019t expect you to be able to make this kind of ambush.\u201d Kal Signer stepped away from Curtain of Darkness. He studied his hand and made a face. \u201cTsk.\u00a0It\u2019ll take at least a month for my hand to fully restore.\u201dMost fiends drank the demon clans\u2019 blood by diluting it with water. There was less chance of dying, but the amount of power they could acquire was also limited.But occasionally, there were those who had nothing to lose\u2014who would do anything for power. They drank down the pure, undiluted blood, but only about two in ten survived. An even smaller number was compatible with the blood. But those who were chosen could use special skills and techniques from the demon whose blood they drank.\u201cDid you drink the blood of a High Vampire or something?\u201d\u201cNope. I like sunlight, you see,\u201d he replied lightly. His weapons aimed at Seo Junho once more. \u201cSeeing as you didn\u2019t use that teleporting skill from the beginning, I assume that it comes with a heavy price.\u201dClever bastard.\u201cAh, ah, ah. I can\u2019t let you get closer to that wall of darkness either.\u201d Kal Signer took another step back and prepared his Demonic energy. \u201cThis time, you\u2019ll die for real.\u201d\u201cI thought you were just going to kidnap me.\u201d\u201cOf course. If you\u2019ll let me put you in these handcuffs, I\u2019ll spare you.\u201dSeo Junho gave him the middle finger.Signer laughed as he loaded his weapons. \u201cThat\u2019s why you should\u2019ve hit here, not my wrist,\u201d he said, tapping on his chest.\u201cHup!\u201d Seo Junho sprinted toward him. Now that his ambush had failed, there was no other option but to face him directly.\u201cHaa\u2026\u00a0It seems that you don\u2019t value your life.\u201dProjectiles rained down on Seo Junho, whistling as they flew. He had to focus, but it was getting harder to do so as Booster\u2019s time limit approached. His head felt like it was on fire.Focus\u2026!\u201cDie!\u201d\u00a0Signer\u2019s scream pierced through his ears.Seo Junho sliced through an arrow with his sword, but he\u2019d already been hit on his left shoulder and twice on his right thigh. He sliced through three more arrows and two ballistas, but he slowed as an arrow pierced through his right shoulder.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201d He gritted his teeth and ran harder as the distance between them started to close.\u201cDie, die, die! I said, die!\u201d Signer\u2019s voice grew louder as Seo Junho approached.Why isn\u2019t he dying? Even if he\u2019s wearing armor, how can he keep moving after getting hit so much? He\u2019s\u2026 He\u2019s not going to reach me, is he?Signer trembled. He sensed the danger and created a powerful arrow.Seo Junho couldn\u2019t get any closer. His breath was cold against the roof of his mouth as pain shot through his body, but he didn\u2019t let go of his sword. The attacks were still coming.He swung his weapon like a bat to hit a ballista, and it exploded in the air. He cut through an arrow, and its electricity shocked his body.An arrow pierced through his stomach. It had penetrated Black Armor like butter.\u201cHa\u2026 Hahaha, that\u2019s right.\u201d Signer\u2019s lips twitched into a smile. Seo Junho fell to his knees, only three meters away. \u201c\u2026Is it finally over?\u201dSeo Junho\u2019s breath was shallow as he replied, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a death flag\u2026 bitch.\u201dSeo Junho sprung forward, sword raised.Signer grunted as he held out his left hand, but he used the other to grab Seo Junho\u2019s throat. There was a loud crack as he broke his neck.Finally\u2026!\u00a0Seo Junho was dead. And he had killed him. He grinned, full of relief.\u201cThat was your wrist, you dumbass.\u201dSeo Junho\u2019s cold voice echoed in his ear.\u201cWha\u2014\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, a sharp ice sword pierced through his heart.\u201cGah!\u201d\u00a0Black blood spilled from his lips. His hand trembled as he brought his hand to his chest. The blood was warm in his hand, hot enough to steam, but all he felt in his body was cold. He staggered as he grabbed Seo Junho\u2019s collar, vomiting blood all over him. His eyes were bloodshot with resentment.An automatic ballista fired at Seo Junho, but he didn\u2019t look away. \u201cClean it up, Watchguard.\u201dThe darkness seemed to burn as it formed the shape of wolves. They growled as they bared their teeth and crunched through the weapons.Signer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWatchguard\u2026 of Darkness?\u201dHow hadn\u2019t he realized?He started to laugh uncontrollably. \u201cHahaha! Ha!\u00a0Cough!\u201d\u00a0Even as blood spurted from his lips, he didn\u2019t stop. \u201cAhahaha! You have the whole world fooled!\u201d He\u2019d finally discovered his identity.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 satisfied\u2026\u201d The life quickly started to fade from his eyes, but he needed to know. \u201cYou\u2026 What are you planning?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Seo Junho crouched down and whispered in his ear. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know. You\u2019re already dead.\u201dHe raised his hand, and the ice sword shattered inside Signer, filling him with unfathomable pain. His body convulsed as it broke like his arrows.My dream\u2026\u00a0He looked up. He\u2019d wanted to become one of the Heavens, no matter what it took, but he quickly realized that he didn\u2019t have the potential.\u00a0I just want to see the stars one last time\u2026But all he saw was the jet-black of Curtain of Darkness, as if it were taunting him.There\u2019s\u2026 nothing\u2026He closed his eyes. Once upon a time, he\u2019d wanted to become the Tenth Heaven, but it had all been for naught. This was how he met his end.Kal Signer\u2019s arms went limp, and his head drooped. Seo Junho let go and let him drop to the ground. The Demon Bow rolled on the ground of the nameless mountain.Seo Junho finally released Curtain of Darkness and looked around. \u201cWhat a mess.\u201dThe area around them had been completely devastated\u2014enough to change the terrain. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be able to erase their traces completely.\u201cHis memories first.\u201d He didn\u2019t even have the strength to lift his finger, but Seo Junho sat down and activated Confession of the Dead. \u201cShit, it\u2019s doing it again.\u201dMost of the memories were locked because the skill\u2019s rank was too low. He swallowed down his frustration and quickly looked for something useful.\u2014 You\u2019re the Demon Bow? Your skills are commendable.\u2014 From now on, you\u2019ll be in charge of a unit. Kill the hypocrites.\u2014 Mission? I have none. I steal if I want to steal, I kill if I want to kill.\u2014 I will follow you to the depths of hell.\u2014 Bring Seo Junho to me.After using it a few times, the highlights feature started to slow, and the projection quickly ended.\u201cI got it,\u201d Seo Junho muttered. He\u2019d found two useful things in his memories. First, he\u2019d verified the extent and validity of Dokkaebi\u2019s information. There weren\u2019t a lot of major fiends in Kal Signer\u2019s memories, but there were many that had been in Dokkaebi\u2019s files. They\u2019d better stay quiet. If he ever met one of them, he\u2019d kill them instantly.The second was the location of the Fiend Association. Kal Signer had been there multiple times. Information about the exact location was locked, but he\u2019d been able to deduce the region.Schumern\u2026 It\u2019s not a big city.It was a small, cheerful city where many people lived, and Kal Signer had gone there whenever he had business with the Fiend Association. He\u2019d be able to verify this once he went up to the 2nd Floor.Other than that, there wasn\u2019t much else. The only thing that caught Seo Junho\u2019s eyes was the fact that he\u2019d been chased by Kim Woojoong for months.That guy\u2019s really stubborn. Even though he\u2019s one of the Nine Heavens, he spent months chasing one person. It would be unwise to make him an enemy.\u00a0As he smiled, a message appeared in front of him.[Skill rank has increased from repeated use.][Confession of the Dead (C) has evolved to Confession of the Dead (B).]\u201cHuh?!\u201d He grinned. That meant he\u2019d be able to get more information in the future. He tried to use it on Kal Signer again.[You have already read the target\u2019s memories.]\u201cCan I not use it twice on the same target?\u201d He sighed, but more messages popped up. He\u2019d leveled up because of the skill rank increase.[You have leveled up.][You have leveled up.][All stats have increased by 2.][You have regained 4 Speed stats.][You have received 2 Stamina stats from \u27ecLimit Breaker\u27ed\u2019s effect.]Seo Junho looked up at the sky, tired. His body was heavy, but he felt exhilarated.\u201c\u2026I avenged you, Tushar Vishi.\u201d Now, he could finally rest. \u201cAs for cleanup\u2026\u201dIt was impossible to do it alone, so he would probably have to ask Deokgu for help. He moved his finger.\u201cClean up the corpse.\u201d Fang of Darkness consumed Kal Signer\u2019s body. Not a single drop of blood was left behind.Seo Junho picked up a large bow off the ground. It was the only thing that had remained. The other weapons had been broken and destroyed when Fang of Darkness had consumed the automatic weapons.\u201cIf I knew this would happen, I would\u2019ve controlled it a little better. Oh well.\u201dHe studied the blood-red bow.\u300cFinal Horizon\u300dGrade: UniqueForce of arrow increased by 500%Arrow speed increased by 1000%When the bowstring is pulled all the way, the arrow can be shot to the end of the horizon.Use Requirements: Level 40, 130 Strength, 130 Speed\u201cIt\u2019s sturdy. So that\u2019s why it didn\u2019t break.\u201d He gave a dim smile and slowly stood up. He had run here, but he definitely needed to take a taxi back.As he started to stand, he heard footsteps.\u201c\u2026!\u201d His body moved on its own, crouching down. Alarms went off in his head, sensing something dangerous. He was jittery from the aftermath of the battle, but a powerful force froze him in place.\u201cCertain scents can\u2019t be concealed no matter how hard you try.\u201d A voice came from beneath the trees. He knew that it was that man that was holding him in place. \u201cLike the stench of fiends, or the Trace Incense.\u201d It was a Unique-grade item that lets you find the target it was attached to no matter how far they went.\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come down to Earth. I was wandering for a while because the scent disappeared.\u201d As the man placed his hand on the sheath of his sword, the magic pressed harder on Seo Junho. It felt like there was a knife held to his neck.A figure stepped out from the shadow of the trees. \u201cIs that a disguise? Or an artifact? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d His eyes were emotionless. \u201cYou can\u2019t run away this time, Kal Signer.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d His eyes widened.\u00a0Am I dreaming?The man before him had many names. He was a swordmaster, the Vicemaster of Silent Moon, and one of three players who were Counts in the Ruben Empire.\u201c\u2026The Eighth Heaven.\u201dHe was the Sword Saint, Kim Woojoong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wow! It\u2019s Kim Woojoong!2. What brings you to this humble place?3. Um, I think there\u2019s been a misunderstanding.He chose the third one. \u201cUm, I\u2014\u201dBut before he could finish his sentence, he felt a sharp pain on his forehead.\u00a0Dammit, he cut me.\u00a0He furrowed his eyebrows as he tried to look at the wound, but there was no blood. The cut was so clean, a normal person wouldn\u2019t have even known it was there.\u201cYou tricked me last time with that cunning tongue of yours. I won\u2019t make the same mistake twice.\u201d\u201cThis is insane.\u201d Seo Junho looked dumbfounded. He\u2019d almost died while trying to kill Kal Signer, and now he was up against the Sword Saint. Not only that\u2014he also thought Seo Junho was a fiend.So this is how he felt.\u00a0He started to sympathize with Kal Signer\u2019s fear. He couldn\u2019t imagine what it would be like being chased by such a person for months.\u201cI surrender.\u201d He put his hands in the air. Kim Woojoong\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u2026How did he move?\u00a0The last time they\u2019d met, he hadn\u2019t sensed so much magic from Kal Signer. But now he was moving like it was nothing. Had he gotten stronger since they last met? That was the only explanation.It doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0He stared down at his opponent coldly and pressed harder with his magic.\u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d Kim Woojoong was taken by surprise. He\u2019d interrupted before he could speak. The man continued, noticing his shock. \u201cI killed Kal Signer.\u201d\u201cLies.\u201d Kim Woojoong\u2019s face darkened. Kal Signer was much weaker than the Sword Saint, but he wasn\u2019t weak enough to be taken out on the 1st Floor.\u201cDo you not know who I am?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you not look at the news?\u201d Seo Junho muttered. He\u2019d heard that his face was all over the 2nd Floor. He sighed and tapped on his Vita to make a call.\u2013 \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cMr. President. I\u2019m in a bit of a bind.\u201d\u2013 \u201cWhat? What are you\u2026\u201d Deokgu paused, realizing that Seo Junho had used formal speech. He started again with a more dignified voice.\u2013 \u201cWhat is it, Player Seo Junho?\u201d\u201cI ran into the Sword Saint, but he\u2019s trying to kill me.\u201d\u2013 \u201cWhat kind of nonsense\u2026\u201dIf they hadn\u2019t been such close friends, Deokgu wouldn\u2019t have believed him.\u2013 \u201cIf this is a joke, end it here.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not. Please save me.\u201d\u2013 \u201c\u2026I understand. Please wait a minute.\u201dA silence settled between them as the call ended. And then, Kim Woojoong\u2019s own Vita rang.\u201c\u2026\u201d His eyebrows furrowed. There weren\u2019t many people who had his number, but one of them was the President of the Korean Player Association. He didn\u2019t break eye contact as he received the call.\u201cThis is Kim Woojoong.\u201cHello. Is Player Seo Junho telling the truth?\u201cNo. It seems that I\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201cUnderstood. Please come find me whenever you have time.\u201dAs the call ended, he immediately removed his hand from his sheath and released the magic. He walked up to Seo Junho and bowed at his waist.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I made a mistake.\u201d He didn\u2019t try to make any excuses. It was a simple, honest apology.Seo Junho was taken by surprise.\u00a0He\u2019s very respectable, like me.It should\u2019ve been difficult for one of the Nine Heavens to bow like this.1\u00a0After all, this was a world where even the weaker ones strutted around confidently.He\u2019s giving a genuine apology\u2026 He\u2019s a good person.\u00a0His apprehension quickly dissolved. There was no point in holding a grudge after receiving an honest apology. \u201cWell, it was a misunderstanding after all. Your apology is enough.\u201dKim Woojoong pulled out a bottle from his inventory. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this would count as compensation, but\u2026 can you tilt your head up a bit?\u201dA refreshing aroma spilled out of the bottle as he opened it. The smell of the potion alone relieved his physical and mental fatigue. Kim Woojoong tilted the bottle until a single drop fell on Seo Junho\u2019s forehead. \u201cOne drop is enough. It\u2019s an elixir.\u201d\u201cAn elixir?!\u201d Seo Junho\u2019s eyes went wide. A single drop could cure any disease in the world as long as one had the money for it. He was thankful, but it felt like a bit of a waste to use it on a small cut. \u201cWasn\u2019t that too much? I could have just put some ointment on it.\u201d\u201cNo. I have to take responsibility for my mistake.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re a good person.\u201d Anyone who took responsibility like that was admirable.\u201cJust a moment\u2026\u201d Kim Woojoong tapped on his Vita. When Seo Junho peeked at his screen, he saw that he had searched up his name. There was a lot of information about him on the internet, especially on the wikis. He skimmed it over before turning off his Vita. When he looked up, he no longer had the cold look in his eyes. He was impressed.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you were such an amazing person.\u201d\u201cI still have a long way to go.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too modest. Not only did you clear all the Uncleared Gates in the country, you beat mine and Specter\u2019s record in the Cave of Trials. You also have a star, just like me, and\u2026\u201d He looked around sharply. \u201cYou killed the Demon Bow all alone. And yet you\u2019re barely over level 30. If I\u2019m being honest\u2026 It\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d He stared him in the eyes, waiting for an explanation.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Seo Junho tapped his chin. It made sense. The last achievement was unheard of.\u00a0But I can\u2019t let him know for free\u2026Seo Junho smiled. Kim Woojoong was extremely skilled, but he wasn\u2019t perfect. With his straightforward personality, his thoughts could be read all over his face. He was extremely curious.It\u2019s a good thing for me, though.\u00a0\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t done anything bad, so there\u2019s no need for me to hide it from you.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, I have three conditions.\u201d He held up his fingers.\u201cConditions?\u201d\u201cI have no reason to hide it from you, but I have no reason to tell you either.\u201d\u201c\u2026I agree.\u201d Kim Woojoong nodded. No matter how curious he was, he couldn\u2019t force Seo Junho to tell him if he didn\u2019t want to.\u201cFirst, please claim responsibility for killing Kal Signer.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Considering how notorious the fiend was, it would launch his career forward. And yet, he was refusing the opportunity.\u201cI don\u2019t want to reveal my abilities. That\u2019s the second condition. Please keep this a secret.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cThe last one is simple. Please help me one time when I ask for it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKim Woojoong\u2019s help was like a cheat key. He\u2019d be able to get out of almost any situation.\u201cHm.\u201d He pondered this for a second, weighing the price of the knowledge.His answer was obvious from his expression.\u00a0He really wants to know.Kim Woojoong was silent for a long time before speaking again. \u201cI have two conditions of my own.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make my decision after hearing them.\u201d\u201cFirst, I won\u2019t let you go if you killed Kal Signer with an immoral power.\u201d\u201cOf course. I can promise you that I didn\u2019t use the power of the demon clans.\u201d\u201cThe second is similar. When you ask for my help, I will not do anything unethical.\u201dThe conditions were so cute, he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cThat won\u2019t happen.\u201d He smiled. \u201cDoes that mean that you\u2019ll accept my three conditions?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Kim Woojoong considered it one more time before nodding. \u201cI accept. To be honest, I\u2019m dying to know how you did this.\u201d\u201cAlright. I take it that our deal is in place.\u201dHe pushed out his magic. The Frost skill covered the ground, radiating power. Now, there were two people that knew of it.This is a cheap price to pay for a favor from Kim Woojoong.\u00a0It was more important to hide Watchguard of Darkness. He couldn\u2019t hide Frost for the rest of his life, nor did he want to. It was going to be revealed eventually, so he\u2019d make use of the secret while he could.Kim Woojoong admired the ice crystals. \u201c\u2026It\u2019s a surprisingly straightforward power. It wasn\u2019t on your profile.\u201d Players with elemental skills were the hardest to deal with, especially if you didn\u2019t know about them beforehand.\u201cI now understand how you killed the Demon Bow. This skill would be able to compete even against other S-rank elemental\u2026 Wait.\u201d He seemed to realize something and turned around to look at Seo Junho. The pieces of the puzzle fell into place. He realized why the Korean Player Association was investing so much on him and why the President treated him like his heir. \u201cIt\u2019s you. You\u2019re the Association\u2019s secret weapon, the one who\u2019ll seal the heat on the 3rd Floor.\u201d\u201cMan, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d think that far.\u201d Seo Junho sighed. He was smart.\u201cSo I\u2019m right.\u201d His lingering suspicion of Seo Junho quickly dissipated, and he smiled.\u201cPlease keep your promises.\u201d\u201cOf course I will. I now understand why you gave me those conditions. If the fiends discover your skill, it\u2019ll be troublesome.\u201d His eyes shimmered, as if he were looking into the future. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d make it past the 3rd Floor\u2026 But there was a solution after all.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still not sure if my skill will be able to withstand the heat.\u201d\u201cIt will.\u201d Seo Junho tilted his head at the Sword Saint\u2019s words. \u201cI\u2019ve been to the 3rd Floor. It\u2019ll be able to freeze the altar, and then some.\u201d\u201cReally? I\u2019m glad to hear that. But like you said, the fiends must not find out.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dKim Woojoong looked around, and pulled part of his sword out of its sheath. Magic surged across the mountain, causing trees to fall and the ground to crack open. The entire terrain was transformed.Kim Woojoong sheathed his sword again, as if nothing had happened. \u201cI\u2019ve been chasing Kal Signer for several months. I killed him here about an hour ago.\u201dSeo Junho grinned and tapped on his Vita.\u201cCan you give me your number? I\u2019ll need a way to contact you when I need your help.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was imagining how good his bed would feel after taking a hot shower. As he dragged his body to the entrance, the light turned on automatically.\u201cAck!\u201d A small figure surprised him. It was none other than the Frost Queen, who was carrying a container of onion-flavored popcorn. She spoke as she chewed on a kernel as big as her fist.\u201cContractor, do you know what time it is?\u201d\u201cHuh? I-it\u2019s one in the morning,\u201d he said, confused. He had come home later than expected after talking more with Kim Woojoong and later with Deokgu.\u201cDid you not say that you were simply meeting with a friend?\u201d\u201cWell, I was going to, but things happened.\u201d He scratched his head. He felt like he was a kid getting scolded by a parent after coming home late. It felt weird, considering that he owned the apartment.\u201cHmph, come home earlier next time,\u201d she ordered, inspecting the sweat and dirt on his body. \u201cYou\u2019re a mess. Did something happen?\u201d\u201cYeah. Something big.\u201d After taking off his shoes and jacket, he pulled out a cold can of beer. The Frost Queen followed him like a little chick.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI killed Kal Signer.\u201d\u201cKal\u2026 Signer? I do not know him. Tell me.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a fiend. He was a lot stronger than the ones we ran into last time.\u201d\u201cHow troublesome. All while you were simply trying to meet a friend.\u201d\u201cWe crossed paths while I was trying to get some food from the convenience store.\u201d He sighed and sat down on the sofa, taking a swig of beer. \u201cAh, that hits the spot\u2026\u201dHe felt his body relax as he sunk into the plush cushions. He stared up at the ceiling.\u201cHey, Frost.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThe world is vast. There are people that are stronger than we can imagine.\u201d He was still in shock from meeting Kim Woojoong.\u00a0I knew he was strong, but still\u2026After awakening from the ice, he\u2019d met and fought many players. He\u2019d cleared multiple Gates and had won the respect of the people as a Super Rookie.But despite it all, he hadn\u2019t realized just how strong the players had gotten after 25 years. The truly powerful ones were on the 2nd Floor, but he hadn\u2019t imagined that the difference between them would be so big. After being the strongest player for so long, it was an unfamiliar feeling.That said, Kim Woojoong had been a player for twice as long as he had. The Sword Saint was 27\u2014only a year older than him\u2014but he\u2019d started when he was 17.He\u2019s such a well-rounded person\u2026\u00a0Seo Junho closed his eyes. He now understood why they were called the Nine Heavens. Once you saw them in person, it all made sense.He has a good character too.\u00a0At first, he\u2019d seemed cold and distant, but he was surprisingly friendly. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising for one of the Nine Heavens to be uptight, but he had been kind. He knew how to take responsibility, which wasn\u2019t easy. Most people didn\u2019t care about much else once they acquired power and status.\u201cWhat are you thinking so deeply about? Tell me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just think I need to try harder.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause things will get harder if I don\u2019t.\u201dThere were eight people who were as strong as Kim Woojoong. It would be nice if they were all good people, but there was a fiend among them who also happened to be his enemy.\u201cUgh, fucking Nazad Hallow\u2026\u201d He was the one that had sent Kal Signer to capture him. \u201cI have to try harder because a monster has its eyes on me.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what was waiting for him in Frontier, and after meeting Kim Woojoong today, both his interest and anxiety had increased. He felt uneasy.\u201cI have plenty of experience on the 1st Floor, but I\u2019ve never been to the 2nd\u2026\u201dWould he be able to do it? His shoulders felt heavy.\u201cContractor.\u201d The Frost Queen patted his head like she was comforting a child. \u201cThings will go well. You\u2019ve already come this far.\u201d\u201cWhat the heck? Why are you comforting me?\u201d\u201cBecause you look like a sad little puppy sitting in the rain,\u201d she said frankly. Seo Junho stared at her and laughed.\u201cStop trying to act all cool. You haven\u2019t even washed your hands after eating popcorn.\u201d He felt his confidence rushing back. \u201cOf course I can do it. Who do you think I am? I\u2019m a living legend.\u201d\u201cHa, I shouldn\u2019t have said that. You\u2019re more arrogant than usual.\u201d Despite what she said, she smiled, satisfied. \u201cAnyways, about that Kal\u2026That man. Was he that powerful?\u201d\u201cNo. The one who surprised me was the Sword Saint, Kim Woojoong. He was insanely strong.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that I wasn\u2019t there. I would have been able to judge his worth.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s several times stronger than you, just so you know. He\u2019s the Sword Saint, after all.\u201dShe smirked. \u201cYou know, I have the power to freeze the entire world\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get started again.\u201d He shook his head and finished his beer before standing up.She scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s true! Why won\u2019t you believe me?\u201d\u201cI do believe you. You\u2019re\u00a0so\u00a0much stronger than the Nine Heavens.\u201d He chuckled as he walked to his bedroom. He felt like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.* * *The two of them had a lot to do in the next two days. Seo Junho had to hurry if he wanted to win the bet he\u2019d made with Gong Juha; there were only ten days left. So from the moment he woke up, he sat down at his desk and started memorizing all the information about the 2nd Floor. When lunchtime rolled around, the Frost Queen appeared before him. She looked extremely exhausted with her hand on her forehead.\u201cPhew, it\u2019s hard work to watch dramas and movies all day.\u201d\u201c\u2026Get out.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t neglect his training either. He spent an hour in the morning and evening sweating in the training room.After a week, Seo Junho finally stood up from this desk.\u201cAre you finished?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d He tapped his head with a finger. \u201cIt\u2019s all in here.\u201d\u201cHm, it seems that you are smarter than you appear.\u201dSeo Junho grinned. He put on a coat and stepped out of the house.\u201cAre you not going up?\u201d The Frost Queen asked as he pressed \u20181\u2019 on the elevator. She\u2019d assumed that he was going to meet Shim Deokgu.\u201cNo. I need to say goodbye to some people before I go to the 2nd Floor.\u201dKwon Noya, Kwon Palmo, Cha Si-eun, Shim Deokgu, and his friends.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u201cWoojoong. Hey, Woojoong.\u201dHe let out a long sigh. There was only one person in the world who would call him so casually: the Guildmaster of Silent Moon and his childhood friend, Son Chaewon. She also happened to be his boss.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHey, do you remember what your mission was? Did you forget after chasing him around for so long?\u201d She was sitting on the mahogany desk of the Guildmaster\u2019s room, smiling cheerfully.It made him nervous whenever she made that face.\u201c\u2026Of course not.\u201d\u201cRight? There\u2019s no way our super elite Sword Saint Kim Woojoong would forget, right?\u201d She nodded and held out her hand. \u201cWhere\u2019s Final Horizon?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe only reason he\u2019d chased Kal Signer for so long was because one of the nobles wanted the bow.\u201cSay something. You killed him, didn\u2019t you? I\u2019ve seen it all over the news.\u201d\u201cYes, I did. I killed him.\u201d\u201c\u2026You don\u2019t have to be so serious. Who else would kill him besides you?\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you bring back the bow? Was Kal Signer way stronger than you expected?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d If he\u2019d wanted to, he would have been able to kill him with a wave of his hand, or torture him until he spat out everything he knew. But he hadn\u2019t been able to do either of those things because Seo Junho had killed him before he could.Kim Woojoong knew that he had Final Horizon, but he hadn\u2019t asked him to hand it over. It belonged to Seo Junho. After all, he hadn\u2019t lifted a finger in killing Kal Signer.Seo Junho had fought and killed him alone. So it was his spoil, and his alone.\u201cI killed him by accident.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d She didn\u2019t believe him for a second. How could the perfect Kim Woojoong make any kind of mistake? \u201cHey\u2026 Are you okay?\u201d She looked worried. No matter how important the quest was, he was her friend first and foremost.\u201cI am.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all that matters. As for the quest\u2026 It\u2019s a shame, but there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201d The quest had come from one of Ruben\u2019s dukes, so if they succeeded, Silent Moon would have become the strongest guild in the empire.But she didn\u2019t linger on what had already happened. \u201cI\u2019ll report to the duke myself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI said it\u2019s fine. No more apologies, okay?\u201d She chuckled as she shook her head. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the real reason? Don\u2019t give me a lame excuse like that.\u201dShe didn\u2019t believe me.\u00a0He sighed. He had never been able to lie to Son Chaewon. She knew him better than his own mother.He thought for a second. He had no intention of breaking his promise with Seo Junho, but for some reason, the thought of him made him laugh.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s with that? I haven\u2019t seen you laugh like that in a long time.\u201d She sounded bitter. It was the first time in four years since she\u2019d seen him make such a bright expression.He looks happier than when he became the Sword Saint.\u00a0Her curiosity made her impatient.\u201cI couldn\u2019t retrieve Final Horizon, but I got something much more valuable.\u201d\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201dKim Woojoong looked out the window, into the never-ending sky. He smiled.\u201cThe future.\u201dHe could see that man\u2019s face etched in the clouds. It was as if he were looking at his past self.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He enjoyed the crowd of bustling people, and the energy was infectious. When he saw people milling about, he felt like he had to try harder.\u201cMy, this is an interesting place.\u201d It was the first time the Frost Queen had come here. She twirled around, taking in her surroundings. Suddenly, she pulled on his shirt.\u201cContractor! Contractor! Let\u2019s go over there. There are so many peculiar items.\u201cMagic tea? I wonder how it tastes. Let us retrieve a glass.\u201cEek!\u00a0A stray cat! Those beasts are everywhere\u2026\u201d\u201cHey. You always brag about Niflheim, so why are you so excited about a market?\u201d\u201c\u2026It can\u2019t be helped.\u201d She was worn out from long periods of flying around, so she sat down on his shoulder. \u201cI spent most of my life inside the castle.\u201d\u201cHuh? Wasn\u2019t it suffocating?\u201d\u201cOf course it was. If I had to describe it\u2026 A monarch\u2019s life is \u20183D\u2019.\u201d As a queen, she should have been able to do whatever she wanted, but the bitter smile on her face said otherwise. \u201cLeading the kingdom is difficult, dangerous, and dauntless. This is the weight that a leader must carry.\u201d\u201c\u2026So that\u2019s why it\u2019s \u20183D\u2019.\u201d\u201cYou should understand. The more responsibilities you have, the more you must lower yourself.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Of course, he\u2019d never been a king, nor had he led a country. But he\u2019d once carried the expectations of an entire world on his shoulders. \u201cI think I get it. There were a lot of times I felt that back then.\u201dSometimes, he\u2019d felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe, as if all his freedom had been snatched away. He\u2019d had no privacy at all and couldn\u2019t go out in public like he could now, which is why he\u2019d spent all his time at home. It had been the one place where he could take off his mask and relax.\u201cThough, I\u2019d assume that a monarch would have it much worse than I did.\u201d\u201cI have never experienced freedom from the moment I was born. However, I have never once hated my life because it was dedicated to my kingdom and people.\u201dHe supposed that this was the difference between them. Seo Junho never wanted to live his life as Specter ever again. \u201cSo you were literally born to be a queen.\u201d\u201cFufu, I\u2019ve heard that many times.\u201d She laughed lightly. \u201cBut no matter how much you enjoy your life, there are times when you long for things that you cannot have.\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve felt that way many times.\u201d\u201cI wanted to know what it was like to be carefree. I couldn\u2019t experience it before I died, but I am enjoying my life here on Earth. Living like this is also nice.\u201dAt some point, they arrived at the workshop. Seo Junho knocked on the door, and Kwon Palmo greeted him.\u201cWhy, if it isn\u2019t Player Seo Junho!\u201d His bulky muscles were drenched in sweat, as if he\u2019d just put down his hammer. \u201cWelcome. You should have called ahead!\u201dHe grinned, but it was almost scary, enough to make the Frost Queen tremble. \u201cC-contractor. What is that monster\u2026?\u201d\u201cChill, he\u2019s a human.\u201d\u201cDid you come to meet grandfather?\u201d\u201cYes. I came here to say goodbye.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d When a player came to say their farewells, it either meant that they were retiring, or that they were going to the 2nd Floor. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to Frontier.\u201d\u201cYes. There was no need to push it off.\u201cNow that I think about it, I never got to thank you properly for Black Armor. I\u2019m truly grateful. Its defense capabilities are amazing.\u201d\u201cHehe, is that so?\u201d He blushed. \u201cGrandfather is upstairs, so you can head right up. Oh, do you want me to take a look at the armor? If there are a lot of defects, I\u2019ll fix it while you two chat.\u201d\u201cReally? I won\u2019t refuse.\u201d Seo Junho grinned. Black Armor had worn out a lot after the fight with Kis Bremen and Kal Signer. If Palmo hadn\u2019t offered, he would\u2019ve asked anyway. He placed it on the table.\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201d Palmo\u2019s face went pale. \u201c\u2026Who in the world did you fight?\u201d\u201cEhe.\u201d There were too many to list them all, but if it weren\u2019t for Black Armor, he would\u2019ve died a long time ago.\u201cHm.\u00a0This will take some time. About six hours, give or take.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m counting on you. I\u2019ll be with Noya until then.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s a good thing that you came so early. I\u2019ll finish by lunchtime.\u201dAs Kwon Palmo began his work, Seo Junho went up the stairs and down a familiar hallway. He knocked on the door.\u201cWhat?!\u201d a voice barked.\u201cGeez, you should be nicer to your only grandson.\u201d Seo Junho clicked his tongue and opened the door. Kwon Noya stared at him.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up? I came to play.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201d Noya snorted, but he stepped aside to let him in. \u201cWhat do you want me to make this time?\u201d he asked, taking a seat.\u201cI didn\u2019t come here for equipment. Though, I did ask Palmo to repair Black Armor.\u201d\u201cHm, if you didn\u2019t come here for that\u2026 Are you going up?\u201d he asked.\u201cBingo.\u201d\u201cYou sure are fast,\u201d he said, amazed. He had only opened his eyes a few months ago, but he\u2019d already reached level 30. \u201cI\u2019ve been keeping up with the news. I saw that you\u2019ve been busy.\u201d\u201cI have to work hard to save my friends.\u201dKwon Noya\u2019s eyes darkened. He didn\u2019t say another word as he brewed the tea and handed him a cup.\u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible?\u201d\u201cDefinitely.\u201d If he kept going like this, he\u2019d be able to save his friends eventually.\u201cThat\u2019s all that matters.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything else as he sipped his tea. He trusted him. \u201cIf you get any good materials, come down from time to time. I\u2019ll make you something good.\u201d\u201cOf course. Who else would make my weapons?\u201d There was no one as skilled as Kwon Noya. \u201cAlso, Palmo\u2019s a lot more talented than I thought. Black Armor impressed me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, it\u2019s good that you liked it,\u201d he mumbled. Kwon Noya was weak to compliments for his grandson. \u201cIs there anything you need? I have a lot of leftover items. They\u2019re only Rare-grade, but they might be useful.\u201d\u201c\u2018Only Rare\u2019, you say\u2026 You better not go around saying things like that.\u201d The items were from the Kwon workshop, after all. There had been an uproar when Black Armor had been revealed as well. \u201cThanks, though. I\u2019ll make good use of this.\u201d\u201cI believe in you.\u201d Noya stood up and patted him on his shoulder before hugging him. Even though the old man was much shorter than him, he hugged him so hard that he almost choked.\u201cI\u2019ll be back. Stay healthy.\u201d\u201cI will. Whether you come back alone or with the others, I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d He finally let go and smiled. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just study Go while you\u2019re gone.\u201dSeo Junho returned the smile. \u201cReally, you should give up. You suck at Go.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dThat day, they played Go for seven hours straight. Of course, Seo Junho won every single game.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 CastorProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Seo Junho returned to the Association with his newly fixed Black Armor and headed straight for Cha Si-eun\u2019s cubicle at the secretary office. She was typing on her keyboard while talking on the phone.\u201cYes, hello? Oh\u2026 You believed that you\u2019re being defamed? Just a second. What was the name of the guild again? Tiger Moth? That\u2019s a really nice name. Please call again if you have any other complaints.\u201d She hung up and quickly wrote something down on a post-it.<Guilds to bring to Junho-nim>The Brave OnesFigmore Clan\u2026\u2026Tiger MothThey were all guilds that had sponsored him, received refunds, and then had been publicly humiliated. She\u2019d written down all the ones that had called to complain that they\u2019d hurt their reputation.\u201cJunho-nim told me to bring him all the people that accused him of defamation\u2026\u201d She finished writing and smiled as she read it over. Seo Junho looked over her shoulder.\u201cYou\u2019re doing very well. So those are all the people who complained?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s so ridiculous how\u2014Eek!\u201d she yelped in surprise and leapt out of her seat. She covered her reddening face as people started to stare. \u201cWh-when did you arrive?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u00a0\u2018Hello? You believe that you\u2019re being defamed?\u2019 From there.\u201d\u201cAck,\u00a0so you were here from the very beginning\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re good at talking.\u201d He smiled and plucked the post-it from her cubicle and put it in his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of these guys before I go, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cReally? Thank you!\u201d She brightened. They\u2019d been calling her nonstop. \u201cBy that, you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to the 2nd Floor.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t seem very surprised.\u201dIt was to be expected. She\u2019d expected this to happen and had already turned in her resignation letter.\u201cI hope you find a better boss once I go up,\u201d he said softly.She chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll find a better boss than you.\u201d In the last few years that she\u2019d been a secretary, none of her former bosses had made her quite as comfortable.\u201cI\u2019m honored. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to find a secretary like you either.\u201d\u201cThank you. Did you come to say goodbye?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I think this is the last time we\u2019ll see each other.\u201d He scratched his head as he pulled a small frame out of his pocket. \u201cThis is a gift.\u201d\u201cOh, I don\u2019t remember us taking a picture\u2026 Huh? This is\u2026?\u201d Her eyes widened as she saw its contents, and her hands started to tremble. \u201cJ-Junho-nim, is this\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s real. It was made fresh this morning.\u201d He smiled and nodded for her to take it.The frame contained a plain piece of paper with a single sentence on it.\u2013 May you find success in all that you do. From Specter.It was plain and detached, but she squeezed it to her chest and bowed several times. \u201cThank you so much! Really!\u201dIt was a bit embarrassing to give his own autograph as a gift, but he\u2019d wanted to give it to her nonetheless. How could he not when he knew how much she admired Specter?\u201cThank you for your hard work.\u201d Thanks to her help, he\u2019d been able to focus wholly on training and hunting. He chuckled and held out his hand.I probably won\u2019t ever see her again.\u00a0She would remain on Earth while he went up to the 2nd Floor. It would be nice if she could continue to be his secretary, but it was impossible.\u201cSecretary Cha\u2014no, Miss Cha Si-eun. You\u2019ll do well no matter where you go.\u201d\u201cYou too. I\u2019ll be cheering you on.\u201dShe watched him leave.\u00a0If I get the chance, I want to be by your side as a teammate, not a secretary.After all, Seo Junho was the second player that she respected most.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98. Those Who Meet Must Part (3)Seo Jun-Ho knocked on the door of the president\u2019s office before he entered. As usual, Shim Deok-Gu was sitting on the sofa instead of at his desk.\u2018He looks\u2026 different.\u2019Shim Deok-Gu didn\u2019t have anyone to take care of him, so he always looked frazzled with his wrinkled suit and crooked tie. But today, there wasn\u2019t a single wrinkle on his suit, and his tie was tied properly. It was as if knew that this would be their last goodbye.\u201cYou\u2019re leaving right after?\u201d\u201cYeah. There\u2019s no need to drag it out.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just like you. I knew you\u2019d do something like this.\u201d As Seo Jun-Ho sat down, Shim Deok-Gu smiled as if he remembered something.\u201cIt\u2019s been about 7 months since you broke out of the ice, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYeah. A little more than that, actually.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you this before, but I was really shocked. I thought it was some sick joke.\u201dHis friend had been frozen in ice for 25 years, so how could he believe it when he was told that his friend had woken up? He had watched the video of Seo Jun-Ho waking up from the ice over and over all day.\u201cBut when I saw you at the hospital, I finally believed that you came back.\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s when I realized that I returned as well.\u201d\u201c...And because of you, the last 7 months have felt like 10 years, you rascal.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I gave you a lot of work to do.\u201dShim Deok-Gu chuckled and shook his head. \u201cIt made me nostalgic. You know what they say: people get younger the longer they live.\u201d\u201cEw,\u00a0you sound so old!\u201d\u201cJust wait until you\u2019re my age.\u201dPhysically, the two of them seemed to have a big difference in age. However, they snickered as they started to chat about old memories. From the first time they met in kindergarten, to their elementary school years, to the time when he helped Shim Deok-Gu confess to the girl he liked, to the times when they would sneak out during exam prep sessions to go to PC cafes, to the time they screamed and jumped when they found out that they got into the same university, and finally, to the days when the Gates first appeared and they fought for their lives. They had spent almost their entire lives together.\u201cWe talked for too long.\u201d\u201cThis always happens when I talk to you!\u201dIt had been three hours since they started talking, and they had become a little worn out. They paused to take a drink of water. At some point, the Frost Queen had gotten bored of their chatter and had fallen asleep on the sofa.\u201cI don\u2019t have much else to say to you. Just keep living like yourself Jun-Ho.\u201d\u201cLive like myself? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s up to you to decide. I\u2019m not you. If I told you, then it\u2019d be a Seo Jun-Ho defined by Shim Deok-Gu.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Seo Jun-Ho snickered. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t regret saying that. I\u2019ll live doing whatever I want and causing all the trouble I want.\u201d\u201cAs long as it makes you happy\u2026\u201dThey embraced and patted each other\u2019s backs.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t help you much on the 2nd floor. The Association\u2019s stronghold is in a remote desert.\u201dHe quietly took note of the information. \u201cDon\u2019t be. Since you helped me so much on the 1st floor, it\u2019s my turn to help you. And sorry for giving you so much work even till the day I leave. I\u2019m counting on you.\u201d\u201cThe former sponsors? Don\u2019t worry about them.\u201d\u201cAnd take care of Secretary Cha too. Get her a good boss, if possible.\u201d\u201c...You don\u2019t have to worry. And if you can\u2019t find any drinking buddies, come down from time to time. It doesn\u2019t take long to come down.\u201d As he spoke, he pulled out a large pouch and placed it on the table.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cThe currency of the Ruben Empire. I don\u2019t know about the capital, but you should be able to live in nice estates in most territories with this. It\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d\u201cMan, you didn\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat, and make you sleep on the streets? People are gonna say that we\u2019re treating you badly.\u201d He felt like a father giving his son an allowance to go study abroad. But of course, Seo Jun-Ho wasn\u2019t his son, and the amount was too much to be called an allowance. \u201cIf you see Arthur, send my regards.\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll contact you from time to time.\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d At that moment, the Frost Queen rubbed her eyes as she woke up. She flitted over to Jun-Ho\u2019s shoulder and yawned as she waved. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of my Contractor, so do not worry.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u00a0I\u2019ll be counting on you, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s taking care of who now?\u201d Seo Jun-Ho grinned.***After saying goodbye to Shim Deok-Gu, Seo Jun-Ho headed straight for the Seoul History Museum, entering through the back door like last time to get to the morgue.\u201cYou guys are still the same...\u201d Seo Jun-Ho stared at the four ice statues and tried to use his skill.[Effect of the skill \u2018Frost (EX)\u2019 has been checked.][Seal of Frost (EX) can be removed.][Your base magic stat is too low. Removal failed.]\u201cI knew it\u2026 It\u2019s still too low.\u201d Thankfully, there was one good news\u2014the contents of the message box had changed.\u2018Last time, it said that my base magic stat is \u201cabsurdly low\u201d but this time it\u2019s telling me that it\u2019s \u201ctoo low.\u201d\u2019It wasn\u2019t much of a difference, but it was still slightly comforting because it meant that the last 7 months hadn\u2019t been a waste. He glanced down at the Frost Queen, but she looked away.\u201cHm?\u201d He moved around to look at her from the other side, but this time, she completely turned around to avoid his gaze. He squinted. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Do you feel guilty or something?\u201d\u201cO-of course not\u2026\u201d Despite her words, her eyes clearly showed how guilty and sorry she felt.Seo Jun-Ho looked back to the statues. \u201cThey\u2019re still alive, right?\u201d\u201c...Yes. I\u2019m sure of it. But if either of us wishes to remove the seal, we must become much, much stronger.\u201dHe was relieved when she confirmed that they were still alive. Her words were good enough. As long as they were still alive, he could save them eventually.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cSo fast? Do you have nothing else to say?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll say it later.\u201d He could say it after he broke them out of the ice while eating and drinking together in a warm room. \u201cWait a little longer. It won\u2019t be long.\u201dHe left the morgue with the Frost Queen***Dimensional Elevator. It was a massive facility that had first appeared after Seo Jun-Ho defeated the Frost Queen 25 years ago in the Pacific. It took them seven hours to get there by plane.\u201cWoah\u2026\u201d He stepped onto the large, artificial island. The Dimensional Elevator was in the middle of the ocean, and waves splashed on the shore.The Frost Queen was full of admiration. \u201cTo think that they made an island in the sea\u2026 Earth\u2019s technology is greatly admirable.\u201d\u201cYou can do it too. You froze the entire ocean, after all.\u201d\u201cThat was more akin to a glacier. This looks like a real island.\u201dShe was right. The only thing that distinguished it from other islands was the sheer number of Players on it.\u201c...There are so many. Though, they\u2019re all weaker than you are.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen something like this.\u201d Recently, the most number of Players he had seen in one place was at the Wild Forest. At that time, there had been 200 Players but it was incomparable to the number of Players on this island.\u2018There are at least a thousand people here. It reminds me of the old days when a Gate would open in the middle of a city and everyone would have to go out and fight. \u2018The Players milling around were waiting to use the Dimensional Elevator, and everyone who seemed wary of others was most likely affiliated with a Guild or an Association.\u201cI can feel their eyes on you.\u201d\u201cWell, I expected as much.\u201dJust like the Frost Queen said, he could feel their eyes on him.\u201cHey, look, that\u2019s Seo Jun-Ho.\u201d\u201cSo he\u2019s going to Frontier...\u201d\u201c...Doesn\u2019t that mean that he\u2019s gonna break the record?\u201d\u201cYeah, I think. The fastest before him were Shin Sung-Hyun and Kim Woo-Joong.\u201d\u201cNormal people take at least a few years, but he only took 7 months\u2026\u201dThe people were looking at him with a mix of apprehension, envy, and respect, but he didn\u2019t pay them that much attention as he strode forward.\u201cIt looks simpler than I expected...\u201d Based on the name, he had expected something grand, but it was nothing more and nothing less than the size of a normal elevator. A Player Association employee was standing in front of it.\u201cPlease show me your Player license.\u201d The employee checked it and handed it back. \u201cPlease make sure to be careful of three things in Frontier.\u201d He tapped on the sign in front of the elevator.1. Nobles2. Fiends3. Unfamiliar Players\u201cIn Frontier, you must adhere to the customs of the Ruben Empire. The nobles are very powerful, and some of them are quite fickle, so you must not meddle in their affairs. Second, although there are fiends on Earth, they are more dangerous in Frontier. Please be careful. Lastly, the Player Association, unfortunately, does not have much influence on the 2nd floor, so there are Players who\u2019ll take advantage of this to extort, assault, and kill. Please be cautious of other Players.\u201dIt felt like he was receiving a tutorial for a game. Seo Jun-Ho nodded, and the employee pressed the button to open the elevator.\u201cPlayer Seo Jun-Ho, I wish you luck.\u201d\u201cThank you...\u201dWhen he stepped in, he heard a pleasant voice saying the familiar\u00a0\u201cthe door is now closing\u201d\u00a0from the speaker. The inside of the elevator was a little bigger than what it looked like from the outside. It looked like it could hold about 12 people, and the outside world could even be seen from the inside.\u201cWow\u2026\u201d The Frost Queen pressed her hands to the wall and watched. \u201cContractor, there is something I would like to know.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cHow do fiends go to the 2nd floor when the island is so closely guarded?\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t the only place with a Dimensional Elevator.\u201dJust like she said, famous fiends wouldn\u2019t be able to come here. Seo Jun-Ho heard that they used the Dimensional Elevators that would appear randomly in the Pacific.\u201cI see...I guess it would be difficult to guard every single Elevator.\u201d\u201cThe Pacific is so large. How could they keep an eye out on everything in there?\u201dThis man-made island was simply the biggest platform. Looking around, there had to be about thirty Dimensional Elevators, and people kept coming in and out of those Elevators.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dSeo Jun-Ho\u2019s heart pounded as he was filled with anticipation. He was on an Elevator, about to step into a different dimension, a whole new world.\u201cC-Contractor, what shall we do if it goes too fast? I dislike having too much movement\u2026\u201d\u201cReally? I\u2019m excited. The internet says it has things you can\u2019t imagine.\u201d\u201cI prefer sights that are familiar.\u201d\u201cStop whining. Let\u2019s go.\u201dHe held out his hand. The buttons were numbered from 1 to 10, but they were only lit up to 3. He pressed \u20183\u2019 out of curiosity, but the voice rang once again.[Your level is too low to enter the 3rd floor.]\u201cSo you can\u2019t cheat...\u201d He expected as much.He pressed the 2nd floor, and the Elevator trembled and shone. Their hearts pounded in anticipation as they waited for it to move.\u201cHold on tight!\u201d\u201cYes, I am!\u201d She gripped his hair hard.[2nd floor. Doors are opening.][The effect of Bringer of Spring has been activated. All stats increased by 30.]\u201c...?\u201dThe announcement was repeated. The Frost Queen spoke with uncertainty. \u201cContractor\u2026 Have we arrived?\u201d\u201cSeeing how the title effect has activated\u2026 But no way.\u201dDepending on the user, teleporting even a short distance could cause motion sickness, and this was an Elevator that crossed dimensions, so it should have been no different, but they had felt nothing. How was this possible?\u201cThat was\u2026 anticlimactic,\u201d he muttered, looking around as he stepped out of the Elevator.\u201cDaybreak is looking for new Guild members\u2026\u00a0Achoo!\u00a0Join the family!\u201d\u201cThe adventurer Guild Blackfoot is looking for ambitious Players!\u201d\u201cCome here for a short tutorial if this is your first time in Frontier!\u201dAmong the recruiters, there were guards to make sure that no one would stir up trouble. The buildings resembled architecture from the Middle Ages. Most notably, the magic in the air was much more abundant than on Earth.\u201c...I see. This truly is something I have never experienced before.\u201d The Frost Queen nodded.Seo Jun-Ho had to agree. He had never seen something like this before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99. Frontier (1)\u201cFirebird is recruiting Players with C-rank elemental skills or higher!\u201d\u201cIs the 2nd floor intimidating and confusing? Then join Winner!\u201d\u201cIf you join Twilight right now, we\u2019ll give you a Rare-grade item when you reach level 50!\u201dWhen you took a Dimensional Elevator to Frontier, you would arrive in Starting Square where there were dozens of Guild scouts trying to bait the newcomers into joining them. Of course, there were no scouts from famous Guilds or the Big 6 here. Most of the Guilds here were small, or Guilds that had just been formed.One such Guild was Big Family, which had been founded 7 years ago. Every day, they sent scouts to Starting Square.\u201cWow\u2026\u00a0It looks like more people came up than usual.\u201d\u201cSunbae, isn\u2019t it amazing? So many newbies come up every day.\u201d\u201cNah.\u00a0Tens of thousands of people register as Players every year.\u201dAmong them, less than 0.01% would blow up on the news and become famous. Most Players ended up going around to lesser-known Gates to raise their levels. Just as the many people headed to uncharted territories chasing the American Dream in the past, they were now chasing after the Frontier Dream.\u201cYou can only succeed if you have the skills\u2026 Players these days aren\u2019t as good as in the past.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cI suppose they don\u2019t have enough role models nowadays. Think about it. When Players like Kim Woo-Joong and Shin Sung-Hyun were on the rise, they inspired others. For a few years, the Players\u2019 skills increased a lot.\u201d\u201cAh.\u00a0Do you think someone like them will appear again?\u201d\u201cOf course. It\u2019s a continuous cycle. Even now\u2026\u201d He suddenly stopped as he looked across the crowd of people.\u201cSunbae, is something wrong?\u201dHe pointed a trembling finger in reply. \u201cLook, that person\u2026Isn\u2019t that Seo Jun-Ho?\u201d\u201cSeo Jun-Ho?\u201d The hubae turned to follow his finger. Standing there was a plain-looking man who was looking around in awe.\u201cWho is he? He looks pretty shabby.\u201d\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t know Seo Jun-Ho?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t. Should I?\u201d His sunbae slapped the back of his head.\u201cYou bastard, I told you to read the news from the 1st floor when you have time!\u201d\u201cW-why are you so mad? Who in the world is he?\u201dThe sunbae looked as if he thought that the way his hubae was rubbing his aching head was pathetic. \u201cHe\u2019s the person that made Korea into a Special Safe Zone. He conquered four Uncleared Gates, killed the Cinder Fox by himself, and ranked number 1 in the Cave of Trials. He had just cleared the Winter Castle on his own too, which had been one of the three remaining Uncleared Gates in the world.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026Is he even human?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a monster. They call him the Super Rookie on Earth.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201d They looked at him with new eyes, as if he was a celebrity only seen on TV.\u201cIt would be awesome if we could recruit him to our Guild.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u00a0He still hasn\u2019t joined a Guild with all those achievements?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s part of the Korean Player Association. But since they don\u2019t have much influence on the 2nd floor, he\u2019s probably looking for a Guild to join. Now, what do you think would happen if we politely approached him first?\u201d\u201c...He would be touched. You\u2019re a genius!\u201d\u201cHehe, I\u2019m your sunbae, after all. But the problem is\u2026\u201d He scanned the area, seeing the other Guilds\u2019 scouts. As expected, they had also noticed Seo Jun-Ho and were salivating at the thought of having him in their Guild. \u201cThere\u2019s too much competition. Well, there\u2019s no way he wouldn\u2019t stand out.\u201dHe clicked his tongue and looked at Seo Jun-Ho like he was a toy that he couldn\u2019t have. \u201cThe rumors say that his charisma makes him untouchable\u2026\u201d\u201cWho, that guy?\u201d The hubae looked unconvinced.Currently, Seo Jun-Ho had his arms spread as he took deep breaths. \u201cHmmm, ahhhh\u2026 Wow!\u00a0Frontier\u2019s great! The air is filled with magic.\u201d He took in big breaths while grinning like an idiot.\u201cIs he really that amazing? He looks kind of scruffy,\u201d the hubae asked again.\u201cErm,\u00a0well, what matters is what\u2019s inside. You can\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s just go up to him...\u201dHe swallowed and nodded at his hubae\u2019s bold suggestion. \u201cA-alright. We should get to him before the others\u2026\u201d\u201cCould you move, please?\u201d They turned around at the voice.\u201cHey, the street\u2019s big so just\u2026\u201d The sunbae frowned, but then he froze when he saw the woman\u2019s red hair. It danced fiercely in the wind as if it had caught fire.\u201cWhy are two big guys like you blocking the way? Do you want to get in trouble?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry! I promise to go on a diet!\u201d The two Big Family scouts quickly moved aside. The girl walked by, not paying them any more attention.\u201cOh,\u00a0right.\u201d She stopped and turned to glare at them. \u201cMr. Snake Head is mine. I was the first one to call dibs.\u201d\u201cExcuse\u2026me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be the one taking him.\u201d\u201cO-oh...\u201dThey weren\u2019t sure what she meant, but the two men nodded eagerly. They wanted to live, after all.***\u201cOh, Captain Gong!\u201d Seo Jun-Ho waved. Her red hair made her stick out like a sore thumb.She grinned as she skipped over. \u00a0\u201cMan, what a waste. If you were two days late, I would\u2019ve won.\u201d\u201cSorry, but I hate losing.\u201d\u201cWill you look at that? Looks like they didn\u2019t teach you properly back on Earth.\u201d She cleared her throat with a cute sound, but her eyes narrowed as she started to glare at him. \u201cYou have already broken two rules\u2014be careful around nobles, be careful around Players.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d He looked surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re a noble?\u201d\u201cWell~\u00a0It\u2019s nothing much. I\u2019m just a baronet. I don\u2019t even have a territory yet.\u201d Despite what she said, she crossed her arms with a smug expression. Seo Jun-Ho suddenly felt pressured to compliment her.\u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d\u201cNah, as I said, it\u2019s nothing big,\u201d she said, waving her hand as she smiled. \u201cFollow me. I\u2019ll show you around.\u201dShe walked to a nearby cafe, but it was empty. \u201cOnly nobles and their companions can come in here. It\u2019s a good place to talk.\u201d\u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t be able to come in here without you?\u201d Seo Jun-Ho took a sip of the coffee that was placed before him. \u201c...Isn\u2019t this just an Americano?\u201d\u201cIt has been 25 years. Earth food isn\u2019t uncommon in the Empire.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u00a0So, what do you think?\u201dHe looked out beyond the terrace. \u201cIt\u2019s so new. It feels completely different from Earth.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t it feel like you\u2019ve fallen into a fantasy world? It\u2019ll probably take you some time to get used to this place.\u201d She poured four spoonfuls of syrup into her ice coffee and stirred it. \u201cMr. Snake Head, have you ever thought about what would\u2019ve happened if we couldn\u2019t close the Gates 30 years ago? If we couldn\u2019t defeat all the monsters?\u201d\u201c...I dunno. I don\u2019t think that it would have been very pleasant.\u201dHe had already lived in such a world before. Dozens of Gates opened, and hundreds of monsters had come pouring out. Cities had burned, buildings had crumbled, and the sounds of screams had filled the air. If the whole world had continued to endure such a calamity for a long time, then the human race might have been driven into extinction by now.\u201cIt\u2019s terrible just to think about, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes. But why did you ask me that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening here in Frontier.\u201d\u201c...!\u201dShe took a large swig of her iced coffee as Seo Jun-Ho waited for her explanation.\u201cThousands of years ago, this place was filled with Gates. But they couldn\u2019t fight off the monsters, and human civilization was destroyed.\u201d\u201cIt seems quite peaceful now, though.\u201d\u201cBecause it had been a long time. Frontier doesn\u2019t have a single Gate anymore, but the monsters from the past had survived and bred; their descendants are still alive and in hiding.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s unexpected\u2026\u201d He looked out into the city once more. It was strange to think that this peaceful place had once been a place of ruin.\u201cSo you know how Players on Earth get rewards by clearing Gates?\u201d\u201cOf course...\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not much different here. You hunt monsters in the field and explore dungeons\u2026But we have something called Quests.\u201d\u201cQuests? Like, game quests?\u201d\u201cExactly. If you take requests from people and fulfill them, you\u2019ll receive EXP and rewards.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing, really. You just need to hunt monsters and clear Quests to level up.\u201d\u201cI assume that Quests from people of higher status give better rewards?\u201d\u201cPrecisely. That\u2019s why everyone\u2019s trying to build relations with the aristocracy.\u201d After that, she started to list off miscellaneous advice.\u201cFuwaa\u2026\u201d Gong Ju-Ha finished her coffee. Afterward, she seemed a little nervous as she spoke softly. \u201cSo, Mr. Snake Head\u2026About the favor that I asked you\u2026\u201dSeo Jun-Ho nodded and reached into his inventory, pulling out the book that he had signed. Gong Ju-Ha\u2019s eyes sparkled as she took it into her hands.\u201cAhh!\u00a0Thank you! He even drew hearts?! I love him so much! I\u2019ll treasure this for the rest of my life. Seriously, I\u2019m gonna make this my family heirloom.\u201d\u201c...I\u2019m glad that you like it so much.\u201d He had been so embarrassed while signing it, but it became clear that his embarrassment had been worth it when he saw her reaction.\u201cOh,\u00a0right.\u201d Gong Ju-Ha quickly reached into her inventory, pulling out something that looked like a letter. \u201cThis is your letter. It\u2019s your prize for winning the bet.\u201d\u201c...This isn\u2019t a card or something, is it?\u201d\u201cHey, what do you take me for?\u201d\u201cThen is it a coupon or\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s not!\u201d Her face turned red.The envelope was fancy, and when he flipped it over, there was a firework pattern.\u201cSo, what is this?\u201d\u201cA letter of introduction.\u201d\u201c...A letter of introduction?\u201d\u201cYup. It\u2019ll let you dine with Viscount Hosen in Maliva.\u201d\u201cA meal with the Viscount?\u201d The letter suddenly felt heavy in his hand. If what she said was true, then this was something that most Players couldn\u2019t buy with money.\u201cIt\u2019s not something huge. As I said, it\u2019s just one meal with him.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWell\u2026If Viscount Hosen ends up liking you, you might get a Quest from him.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re just setting the stage for me\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll have to prove yourself on your own. You\u2019re not even a member of our Guild.\u201d\u201cThis is more than enough. It\u2019s a much better present than I had expected.\u201d He previously thought that he would receive a Rare item or something. He knew from the Las Vegas auction that her pockets were deep, but he didn\u2019t know that they were\u00a0this\u00a0deep.\u2018There are many Players who will never get a chance like this.\u2019He was lucky to receive such a huge opportunity as soon as he arrived in Frontier.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have an expiration date or anything, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a letter, not a carton of milk. You can go there whenever you want.\u201d She chewed on a piece of ice as she continued. \u201cSo, what will you do now? I\u2019m planning to go and finish a Quest.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be raising my level. I\u2019m thinking about going to a place called Dustang if I have time. I know someone there.\u201dGong Ju-Ha crunched hard on a piece of ice in surprise. She stared at him. \u201cDustang? Did I hear that right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100. Frontier (2)Seo Jun-Ho tilted his head. Even for the dramatic Gong Ju-Ha, her reaction was unexpected.\u201cYou did,\u201d he responded.\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s where they are? That\u2019s weird, it\u2019s not really a place where people live\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dGong Ju-Ha crossed her arms as she crunched on the ice. \u201cBecause Dustang is a place for criminals\u2026\u201d\u201c...A place for criminals?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s like Paradise, but for criminals. If they hide there, the empire won\u2019t pursue them.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cYou can think of it as a dumpster of sorts. If they stay in Dustang, there\u2019s nowhere else for them to go.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026So they leave the criminals in a single area so they\u2019re easier to take care of.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a notoriously evil place. There are even rumors that fiends frequently go there.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d he muttered. He didn\u2019t know what Arthur was doing there, but he wasn\u2019t really concerned.\u2018Deok-Gu said that he\u2019s strong enough to fend for himself.\u2019Since Shim Deok-Gu said it himself, it meant that Arthur should be pretty skilled. It didn\u2019t seem like he would be the type to be intimidated by a few criminals.\u201c...You don\u2019t seem very worried?\u201d\u201cWell, he\u2019s not a kid. He wouldn\u2019t have gone there if he didn\u2019t think that he could handle it.\u201dGong Ju-Ha nodded slowly. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d\u201cSo, is that all I should know?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 I can\u2019t think of anything else, so I should\u2019ve told you all the important things.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll repay you someday.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, and just focus on getting stronger. Go hunt monsters, join dungeon raids, and make sure to get Quests from the Adventurer Guild while you\u2019re in Gilleon.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do if I want to go to another city?\u201d\u201cYou can walk, hire a coachman, or use a Teleport Gate.\u201dSeo Jun-Ho\u2019s eyes sparkled. He had heard about how convenient the Teleport Gates were in Frontier. They were set up in every city of the Ruben Empire.\u201cI\u2019ve heard of those. Are they nice?\u201d\u201cBesides the price, they\u2019re amazing. Once you try it, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d\u201cCan I use them too?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d She made an \u2018X\u2019 with her arms over her head. \u201cTeleport Gates are strictly regulated by the empire. If you want to use them, you need Rubenian citizenship.\u201c...Am I not a citizen?\u201d\u201cOf course not. Check your status window.\u201d\u201cStatus window.\u201d[Seo Jun-Ho]Level: 36Title: Bringer of Spring (+2)Status: TouristStrength: 140\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stamina: 153Speed: 147\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Magic: 182The first thing he noticed was his stats.\u2018Seems like the Title \u2018Bringer of Spring\u2019 effect is working properly\u2026\u2019The 30 points of stat increase in all stats made him feel giddy.\u201cHm?\u201d He stared at his status window before blinking. He saw a new section. \u201cStatus?\u201d\u201cIt says you\u2019re a tourist, right?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cThe moment a Player enters Frontier, they are given tourist status for 90 days. If you do enough Quests during that time, the Adventurer Guild will give you a new identification card.\u00a0Mm\u2026\u00a0you can think of it as a work visa.\u201d\u201cHow meticulous.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not as hard as it sounds. If you just stay out of trouble and stay active, you\u2019ll easily be able to get it.\u201d\u201cWhat happens after 90 days?\u201d\u201cYour status will change to \u2018illegal alien\u2019 and you\u2019ll be hunted down.\u201d\u201c...You\u2019re joking, right?\u201d\u201cDo you think I am?\u201d She was smiling, but she seemed serious. \u201cAnd lastly\u2026 You really have to be careful of other Players.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m not a pushover myself.\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re strong, but I just wanted to warn you just in case.\u201d\u201cThank you for your concern.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d She dug around in her inventory and pulled out two books and a map. \u201cHere. This is a gift.\u201d\u201cThe reward for the bet is already more than enough.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just giving this to you because I want to. You can think of this as a sunbae\u2019s affection for a praiseworthy hubae.\u201d She grinned. \u201cThis is a Skill Book. You\u2019ll be able to read the Rubenian language if you use it. You\u2019ll need it from now on.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this expensive?\u201d\u201cI can afford it, so just take it.\u201dThe timing of this was perfect. He had been planning to buy a map of the empire. He thanked her and immediately activated the skill book before he turned to the next book.\u201cIs this also a skill book?\u201d\u201cNo, this is a guidebook of sorts. It\u2019s only supposed to be used by Guild members, but I\u2019m making a special exception just for you, Mr. Snake Head.\u201d\u201c...Is it really okay to give this to an outsider?\u201d Seo Jun-Ho doubted.\u201cHey, I told you not to worry. When a sunbae gives you a present, you\u2019re just supposed to say \u2018thank you\u2019 and accept it.\u201d She smiled as she gave him presents that would be very helpful to him. \u201cI hope you grow a lot.\u201d\u201cAm I a tree or something?\u201d He looked at her strangely, but he bowed his head. \u201cAnyway, thank you. You\u2019ve helped me out a lot.\u201d\u201cFufu.\u201d She stood up. \u201cOh,\u00a0right. This should be obvious, but Frontier doesn\u2019t have communication satellites,\u201d she said, tapping her bare left wrist.\u201cSo I can\u2019t text and call using my Vita?\u201d\u201cBingo~\u00a0But still, you should carry it around. The interpreter feature works perfectly fine.\u201d\u201cDoes it work with the people here?\u201d\u201cOf course. It can translate Rubenian. So if you see someone with a Vita, they\u2019re likely a Player.\u201dTechnology was amazing. \u201cI see. But if I can\u2019t text or call, how do I contact people?\u201d\u201cYour Community feature should\u2019ve been updated.\u201d\u201cCommunity?\u201d As he said that, a hologram screen similar to his status window appeared before him. \u201cSo it\u2019s like an open forum?\u201d\u201cCorrect. There are different kinds of boards too. Generally, you can only use it in a city. But if you\u2019re in the same field as others, a regional channel will be created, so you should use that too. This is my username, so please contact me if something ever happens.\u201dGong Ju-Ha put a small memo on the table. It read, \u201ciluvac.\u201d[1]Seo Jun-Ho tucked it away and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll contact you in the future.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have time today, but I hope you didn\u2019t forget that you promised to treat me to something good.\u201d\u201cOf course, I haven\u2019t. It\u2019s the promise I made in Las Vegas.\u201d\u201cYou better buy me something expensive.\u201dThey walked out of the cafe together, and she waved at him as she stepped into the crowd.\u201cWork hard!\u201d\u201cYes! Thank you so much!\u201dThe Frost Queen spoke as they watched her disappear. \u201cHow fun. She is like a fox.\u201d\u201cA fox? If she were an animal, she\u2019d be a dog or a cat or something.\u201d\u201cHaaa,\u00a0you are ignorant in the ways of women\u2026\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt will only be tiresome for me if I attempt to explain even further. So, what will you do now?\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ll be in Gilleon for a while, so I need to find a place to stay.\u201dHe began walking forward.***\u201cWelcome to Hotel Shangri-La.\u201d The doorman greeted him politely and bowed from the waist.Seo Jun-Ho stepped into the extravagant lobby, looked around for a bit, and immediately left.\u201cHm?\u00a0Contractor, did you not say that you were looking for lodgings?\u201d\u201cYeah, but that place isn\u2019t it.\u201dThe Frost Queen sighed. She liked the elegance and luxuriousness of the hotel. \u201cWell, I suppose you need to be wise with your spending.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u00a0It\u2019s not about the price.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m new to this city. I barely know anything. So the best place for me to stay would be somewhere where lots of different people come and go.\u201d\u201cAh,\u00a0but did you not learn anything from the fox girl?\u201d\u201cI want up-to-date information that\u2019s not in a book written by a Guild.\u201dThey soon arrived in front of an inn. It was much less flamboyant than the hotel, but it was similar in size.Dewdrop Inn.The skill book he had used earlier allowed him to read the sign.The first floor was a restaurant, and it was noisy with people.\u201cHahaha! I\u2019m telling you, I\u00a0massacred\u00a0those Kobolds with this mace!\u201d\u201cDid you hear? The Red Sand Bandits have been causing a ruckus near Gilleon.\u201d\u201cI feel bad for the lord. It\u2019s a pity that the heir caught such a terrible plague\u2026\u201d\u201cThose fucking Players. They\u2019re stealing all the Quests from the Adventurer Guild.\u201d\u201cHave you heard about the disappearance of the adventurers and Players?\u201dAs Seo Jun-Ho lingered near the entrance, a waiter approached him. \u201cHow many?\u201d\u201cJust me.\u201dHe was led to a table in the corner, and the waiter brought him a glass of water and a menu. Seo Jun-Ho didn\u2019t bother reading it.\u201cPlease get me the best dish and alcohol here, along with a cup of tea.\u201d\u201cThat would be mushroom soup with lamb steak and Hainal Mountain beer. Is black tea okay?\u201d\u201cYes, please.\u201d\u201cThat will be 51 copper.\u201dAt the waiter\u2019s soft response, Seo Jun-Ho dug through his inventory.\u2018The Ruben Empire\u2019s currency is made up of copper, silver, and gold.\u2019100 copper was equal to 1 silver, and 100 silver was equal to 1 gold.\u2018Gong Ju-Ha told me that 1 copper was about 1 won.\u2019So 1 silver was about 100,000 won, and 1 gold was 10,000,000 won.He had received 1,000 gold from Shim Deok-Gu, which meant that he had around 10 billion won.\u201c51, correct?\u201dClatter.He dropped 51 gold onto the table. The waiter\u2019s jaw dropped, and the entire restaurant went silent. The waiter quickly pulled himself together and covered the gold with his apron.\u201cS-Sir, it\u2019s 51 copper, not gold. You shouldn\u2019t show off gold like this in public spaces.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d he said, nodding casually. He put away the gold into his inventory in a way that was not deliberately slow or fast.\u201cI-I\u2019ll bring you the change.\u201d As the waiter walked away with a single gold coin, Seo Jun-Ho closed his eyes. He could almost hear the people\u2019s heads and eyes turning toward him.\u201cContractor, were you trying to show off your wealth?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d He smirked and shook his head. \u201cMoney attracts flies.
