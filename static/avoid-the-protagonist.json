Every night, she did her best to build a good professional relationship with this business partner. However, one time during a toast, she was pushed aside while being ridiculed that her body was no use. Since she can\u2019t get drunk, the man said he preferred a beautiful woman to drink beside him.At that point, Xin Siyue, who seldom drank wine since childhood, gritted her teeth and forced herself to smile at those disgusting faces. She reluctantly swallowed one cup of wine after the other until she ended up feeling nauseous.Her eyes turned red as she vomited at the hotel room\u2019s bathroom. Recalling how those filthy beasts took advantage of the dim restaurant and touched her thighs, she wanted to curse at their family\u2019s 18-generations for thousands of times over!Hmph! When this Miss recovers, she\u2019ll make sure they\u2019ll wish they were dead!When Xin Siyue thought of those despicable faces and her own helplessness, her face scowled even deeper, but soon, a glint flashed through her eyes. Even though her days have been difficult, hasn\u2019t she survived? What was she afraid of?She smiled once again and slid the hair on her cheeks behind her ears. If the project becomes a success, she might have a brighter future in the company. Now that her task was over, the number of unpleasant meals will be reduced. Well, most importantly, she can go home and surprise Lin Hui,In the past, the Xin family fell apart; her parents died, her brother had completely disappeared to who knows where, and a series of bad luck had befallen her since then. Thankfully, Lin Hui never abandoned her. He didn\u2019t even mind that she had nothing! The two of them applied for a marriage license and soon became husband and wife. Everything happened so fast while maintaining a low-key reputation.Although their marriage life wasn\u2019t wealthy, they had great joy in each other\u2019s company. Even in poverty, their times together were very beautiful.Xin Siyue tried to display her brightest smile as she opened the door lightly, but her smile suddenly froze the moment she saw clothes scattered across the hallway leading towards the bedroom.Suit, coat, tie, a long sleeve shirt, a woman\u2019s white bra, denim shorts, black underwear\u2026Xin Siyue\u2019s face, which had been slightly pale, became even paler in an instant.Her eyes were fixed on the closed door to the bedroom. There was poor sound insulation through the walls. She stood stiff in her place as she heard a woman\u2019s groans and whispers: \u201cUh-uh\u2026slow down\u2026. Pain, hey, slow down, slow down, hurry up\u2026\u201d\u201cYou little devil\u2026\u201d The growling man\u2019s voice was full of joy.Whose voice could that be other than Lin Hui?!\u201cMr. Lin, it seems that your wife has no ability to satisfy you\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy mention that b*tch?! If she wasn\u2019t the precious young Miss of the Xin family, do you think I would\u2019ve married her? I just thought that Chen Sinan would let me off if I married into the Xin family, but who would\u2019ve thought his grudge would go so deep that he wouldn\u2019t even consider his old relationship with the Xin family. To think he would directly uproot their foundations which had been prosperous for the past 100 years. Now they\u2019ve fallen into misfortune.\u201dXin Siyue could only feel herself go cold. She gritted her teeth, clenched her fist, and stepped forward, when she suddenly heard Lin Hui sarcastically say: \u201cHow can her bed technique be as good as yours? Every time I move, she cries out in pain, saying it hurts while calling me a bastard. Woman, I haven\u2019t even made my move\u2026\u201d\u201cLin Hui, you bastard!\u201dUnable to bear it any longer, Xin Siyue pushed the door open while cursing his name. She went straight in and without a word, grabbed a glass bottle not far from the door, then smashed it towards the back of Lin Hui\u2019s head while he laid on top of some unknown woman.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

The man quickly raised his hand and blocked the glass bottle.Xin Siyue huffed and once again advanced, but the bottle was soon snatched from her hand directly.\u201cXin Siyue, you\u2019re insane!\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m definitely insane! I was crazy for treating you like a human being!\u201d She always thought that she had found hope in the low valley, but in the end, all her hope was placed on a scum worse than a beast!\u201cWell, if I\u2019m not human, then you\u2019re certainly no different! Who in Shengjin city doesn\u2019t know how shameless and cheap you were when you chased Chen Sinan? In the end, you\u2019ve been thrown away like trash\u2026\u201d\u201cYes! Just as you want to smash my head, I also want to throw you away!\u201dXin Siyue glanced at the despicable woman who was wrapping herself in a bathrobe by the bedside, obviously enjoying their drama on the sidelines. At such a sight, her temper rose again and she lifted her hand to slap Lin Hui on the face.The man gritted his teeth and cursed at the \u2018mad woman\u2019 who wanted to retaliate. He raised the glass bottle and smashed it against her head without any remorse.As the crisp sound of shattering reverberated, Xin Siyue could only hear a buzz in her head.As she slowly fell, she saw many scenes in her mind, frame by frame. She recalled her college days when she relentlessly chased after Chen Sinan despite his cold rejection. She thought of her parents and brother who died tragically. Those days, she was once that bright, carefree and arrogant girl who had all the delicacies and clothing\u2026However, none of these will ever return.Before dying, she heard that disgusting woman speak with a concerned voice: \u201cOh no, you killed your wife\u2013\u201d\u201cWhat are you afraid of, help me tidy up the scene! Remember, she slipped and fell on her own and her head hit the bottle. Then she bled so much that she died! You better not talk too much, or else you won\u2019t get away with it\u2026\u201dBefore the last of Xin Siyue\u2019s consciousness disappeared, she simply felt that her retribution this lifetime was truly deserved, and thus, had no regrets dying. After all, what\u2019s the use of regret? Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t have Chen Sinan for herself. She wanted to tear apart that Sheng Wenyang, but as a result, that woman ended up in a wedding dress while she herself was forced to walk the road to hell.\u2018This is the end of my life. Maybe not long after, no one will remember my existence.\u201d \u2013End of story.After reading the ending, Xin Siyue sighed heavily and closed the book solemnly. For some reason, she only felt as if her heart weighed down.After work that afternoon, she visited the bookstore to find a romance novel to read. Upon discovering a novel whose villainess shared the same name as hers, she immediately opened its pages and began reading in excitement.She just never expected the ending to be so tragic.Most of the plot consisted of intense, dog-blooded drama. Sheng Wenyang, the novel\u2019s female protagonist, started out as an ordinary girl. Because of her excellent academic performance, exceptional temperament, and her many chance encounters with the male protagonist, they gradually began to develop feelings towards each other. However, the woman prioritized her career ambition; Sheng Wenyang had always hoped to break free of the world\u2019s traditions and become equally matched with her man by gaining the strength to withstand the wind and storm of the business world. Thus, she leaves Chen Sinan and goes abroad without saying a word.After Xin Siyue meets the male protagonist and falls in love with him at first sight, she tries every means to win his heart. Whenever the opportunity presented itself, she would deliberately approach him. However, for these few years up until the female protagonist\u2019s return, Xin Siyue never managed to catch the man\u2019s sight.Unable to stand for this, the villainess pointed all her spears at the female protagonist, setting up traps everywhere while abusing her. Naturally, Sheng Wenyang, with her main character halo, always managed to escape danger with the help of the male protagonist. The couple\u2019s feelings would grow deeper with time, while Chen Sinan would come to abhor the villainess even more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - Same Name (3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.3 Same Name (3)Near the end of the novel, Chen Sinan was completely enraged when the villainess\u2019 husband, Lin Hui, caused Sheng Wenyang to miscarry her one-month old baby. Within half a month, the Xin family and their company went bankrupt, and both Xin parents committed suicide in tears. Xin Siyue lived for less than a year before dying miserably.For some reason, the reader Xin Siyue was in a sour mood after reading the novel, perhaps because she shared the same name as that woman.Her name was obviously very special. How could a villainess be given the same name as her?Although the woman\u2019s fate was miserable and the male and female protagonists won a happy ending as expected, Xin Siyue wasn\u2019t happy at all.The more she read this book, the more her heart felt choked.Suddenly, she stood up, picked up the book, and put on her slippers before walking out of the room. \u2018Better take this out of my sight so I can forget about it!\u2019She had this thought as she hurried down the stairs. Without paying attention to her feet, Xin Siyue felt her slippers accidentally slip off a step and her whole body soon rolled down the stairs.Her efforts to save herself were futile.It took a while before her body stopped falling down the steps and excruciating pain enveloped her. Her eyelashes trembled and she could barely see the book spread open in front of her. The text \u2018bled so much that she died\u2019 was stained with red blood.The wet sensation seemed to spread from the back of her head.Before Xin Siyue could think of her life this past month, her vision blacked out and she fainted.***\u201cSiyue, Siyue, are you awake?\u201dXin Siyue woke up in a daze. Hearing someone call out her name, she struggled to open her eyes when an intense pain throbbed at the back of her head.She recalled that just before, she was so angry that she decided to throw away her novel. Instead, she rolled straight down the stairs, probably knocking her head against the sharp edges of the stair\u2019s corners.\u2018D*mn it, it hurts.\u2019She subconsciously frowned from the pain.A woman\u2019s happy voice rang out: \u201cShe\u2019s awake! Hurry and call a doctor!\u201dXing Siyue slowly tried to open her eyes, but all she could see was the vague image of a middle-aged woman with delicate makeup. She seemed to be looking at her with worry\u2026\u201cSiyue, are you finally awake? You scared mother to death!\u201dXin Siyue\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u2018No, no, how can she be my mother? My mom was obviously a country woman. She would never wear makeup with elegant clothes!\u2019\u2018I must be hallucinating.\u2019Xin Siyue closed her eyes and went back to sleep.It seemed to be late at night by the time she woke up once again. As she looked up, the brilliant crystal chandelier up ahead was just too dazzling. Xin Siyue unconsciously reached out her hand to shield her eyes from the bright light, but someone suddenly caught her wrist. Then, she heard a steady male voice say: \u201cDon\u2019t move, your arm is attached to the IV drip.\u201dSomewhat puzzled, Xin Siyue woke up properly and looked at the stranger beside her. \u201cYou are?\u201dAt her question, the handsome young man, stiffly stared at her before scolding: \u201cWho am I? I\u2019m your brother!\u201d\u2018Brother\u2026.\u2019No, she should be an only child! Of course, illegitimate children outside her father\u2019s marriage can\u2019t be counted!Xin Siyue was very confused at this moment. The more she tried to think, the more painful her head felt.Noticing her pale face, Xin Qiancheng composed himself and solemnly asked: \u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cDo you know what your name is?\u201dShe replied without even thinking: \u201cXin Siyue.\u201dThe man touched her forehead and happily said: \u201cWell, it seems that you haven\u2019t completely gone stupid. I\u2019m Xin Qiancheng, your brother.\u201d\u2018Xin Qiancheng? Why does that name sound familiar?\u2019Xin Siyue suddenly recalled\u2013 this was a name that appeared several times in the novel\u2013the villainess\u2019 brother!No way! What just happened?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - DoubtsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.4 DoubtsXin Siyue painstakingly tried to recall, \u2018What city did the female and male protagonists live in again? Sheng\u2013 what?\u2019 She remembered how the author liked the female protagonist so much that the first word for the city\u2019s name was also the same as the protagonist\u2019s last name\u2026\u2018That\u2019s right!\u2019Xin Siyue asked in a hurry: \u201cIs this Shengjin City?\u201dXin Qiancheng carefully observed her, but after a while, her eyes were still inquisitive and clear. Seems like this wasn\u2019t a prank, so he could only nod.Xin Siyue suddenly felt helpless out of fear. She closed her eyes in defeat. Yes, yes! She actually transmigrated over into a novel as the villainess who was headed straight for a tragic ending!Xin Siyue wondered where the plot was at during this timeline.She asked her brother: \u201cHow old am I now?\u201dXin Qiancheng raised a brow and asked seriously this time: \u201cYou really don\u2019t remember?\u201dXin Siyue nodded, but immediately shook her head once again.Her brother asked impatiently: \u201cWhat do you mean by nodding and shaking your head?\u201d\u201cI only recall my name and some other vague details. For example, I\u2019m the eldest daughter of the Xin family. I know this is Shengjin City, and also\u2026\u201d Xin Siyue wanted to share a few other information regarding the villainess in the book, but she wasn\u2019t sure of her present circumstances and could only do her best to avoid arousing suspicion. So she changed the topic and said, \u201cI only remember these details, but I can\u2019t recall the rest.\u201dXin Qiangcheng\u2019s brows knitted deeply as he considered her words. After pondering about it for a while, he said, \u201cGo to bed first. I\u2019ll call the doctor to see you.\u201d\u201cOkay, thanks brother.\u201dXin Qiancheng, who was about to turn and leave, suddenly stopped on his tracks and stared back at her doubtfully for two seconds. Finally, he walked out of the room with a disconcerted look.\u2018Weird, how can falling down the stairs make her act so strange? Since when did my sister treat others so politely? Did her brain really break down this time? She already wasn\u2019t very smart in the beginning\u2013if we don\u2019t prevent it from degrading any further, who knows what disaster will come!\u2019At this thought, Xin Qiancheng\u2019s pace quickened.Upon seeing the man slip away so quickly, Xin Siyue laid back in bed and sighed in her heart. The former Xin Siyue of the novel had such a temper that not even her brother was willing to be close to her.Although there weren\u2019t many descriptions of Xin Qiancheng in the book, it\u2019s not difficult to see that he was a smart and capable person. He was able to run most of the Xin family\u2019s businesses at such a young age, but he was later implicated due to the villainess\u2019 deeds.She recalled a scene in the novel, right after the villainess had succeeded in plotting Sheng Wenyang\u2019s miscarriage. Outside the operating room, Chen Sinan, who had always maintained a calm and composed demeanor, now wrapped his fingers around the villainess\u2019 neck with one had and viciously warned, \u201cIf something happens to her, I\u2019ll definitely bury your corpse with her!\u201dShe also recalled the author\u2019s description: \u201cFor the first time, Xin Siyue felt a deep fear from the murderous aura that emanated from Chen Sinan\u2019s body. It was as if his cold hands could tighten its grasp mercilessly around her throat at any moment, easily taking away her life. She wanted to struggle against him, but did not have even half the strength to resist\u2026\u201dFinally, Xin Qiancheng rushed into the hall in a hurry, giving his sister a chance to live.Xin Qiancheng walked behind Chen Sinan and ordered in a chilling voice: \u201cChen Sinan, you\u2019d better let her go this instant!\u201dChen Sinan simply replied: \u201cAnd if I say no?\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t let you rest, even if I have to use all of our Xin family resources!\u201dChen Sinan sneered and replied without shame: \u201cI\u2019d like to see who it is between us who will have no time of peace!\u201d After that, he pushed the villainess away, causing Xin Siyue to hit the wall behind her. Her eyes burst into tears as she heard Chen Sinan\u2019s parting words with a cold warning: \u201cXin Siyue, just wait, I\u2019ll have you pay off your debts!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Avoid EntanglementPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.5 Avoid EntanglementChen Sinan threatened her to stay out of his sight. As she sobbed on the floor, Xin Qiancheng squatted down next to her and lifted her up. He advised: \u201cI told you before that he\u2019s not the man for you. Chen Sinan is not the kind of person you can force or keep by your side. Now you finally know right?\u201dHis sister cried so hard that her tears fell like rain. She retorted fiercely: \u201cBut what can I do? I just love him!\u201dXin Qiancheng\u2019s face darkened and he looked at her silently.The man isn\u2019t interested in you at all even after all you\u2019ve done to pursue him. He was quite clear in expressing his rejection. In that case, why not let go and just live freely?The current Xin Siyue also felt some sympathy for Xin Qiancheng at that time. In fact, there was nothing he could do to convince such a stubborn person.With these thoughts, Xin Xiue drifted off to sleep.By the time she woke up again, it was early in the morning.This time, the person sitting in front of the bed was the villainess\u2019 beautiful mother.Xinyue considered that since she had transmigrated into the world, she had yet to find a way to return back to her own. There is the saying \u2018only those who recognize the trends of the times can become outstanding figures.\u2019 Perhaps the way for her to return was by letting nature take its course and simply wait for the male and female protagonists to write their happy ending. Whatever happens after that is none of her business. But before the ending, she must reduce her already small sense of existence and not get entangled with them. That way, everything should turn out fine, right?As for the villainess\u2019 tragic end at the male protagonist\u2019s hands, she believed that this was no longer a problem! Why? Because she wasn\u2019t the real Xin Siyue, and the current her had no feelings for Chen Sinan whatsoever!While she was deep in thought, her mother gave a long sigh. \u201cSiyue, there are so many good men in the world. Although that Chen kid is exceptional, you are the eldest daughter of our Xin family, meaning there is a long line of excellent men waiting for you in the future. And who knows if your tastes change someday? Let\u2019s not pursue this any longer.\u201dUpon hearing this remark, she silently thought to herself: \u2018Wow, with this kind of mother, the villainess really wasn\u2019t worthy of her own parents! But maybe it\u2019s not so good that she\u2019s boasting about her daughter too much?\u2019Then the next second, Xin Siyue\u2019s thoughts were thrown in turmoil! \u2018Wait, does that mean the villainess already knows of Chen Sinan at this point? So she\u2019s already in college?\u2019\u201cMom?\u201d Xin Siyue asked weakly: \u201cHow old am I right now?\u201dMother Xin gazed at her with incredulity and asked, \u201cDid you really forget everything?\u201d\u201cI forgot,\u201d Xin Siyue nodded.Well, if her daughter has forgotten everything, then that must include Chen Sinan. Since they will simply meet as strangers in the future, it\u2019s all for the best!With a complicated look on her face, Mother Xin immediately called for the doctor.After the doctor examined her, his lines were no different from those in a drama series: \u201cBased on her circumstances, it is presumed that her concussion led to a partial loss of memory.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Mother Xin asked anxiously.\u201cTo put it simply, it\u2019s amnesia.\u201dIt was Xin Siyue who said this before the doctor could open his mouth.Left speechless, the physician couldn\u2019t help but glance at her.Meanwhile, faced with the man\u2019s unspeakable look, Xin Siyue laughed and said, \u201cDoctor, I\u2019m very much aware of my health.\u201dMother Xin, who didn\u2019t know what words to say for a while, finally said, \u201cYou mean, amnesia?\u201dThe doctor looked at Xin Siyue helplessly and nodded.Mother Xin\u2019s eyes reddened as she looked at her daughter\u2019s tearless face. Her heart ached for her child.Xin Siyue mentally rolled her eyes. What was she worried about? It\u2019s not like this condition was a terminal disease, plus she didn\u2019t actually have amnesia. Actually, she knew way too much when it comes to the plot, but right now, she couldn\u2019t name people based on their faces. That\u2019s why she still needed to use amnesia as an excuse.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m still in good health, aren\u2019t I? What\u2019s better than living in peace and security right now? You can tell me more about the past, and who knows, maybe I\u2019ll recall everything after you give me some time. Even if I can\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big issue. So mom, don\u2019t be sad, I\u2019m alright.\u201dMother Xin\u2019s eyes gradually showed a hint of incredulity and horror at her daughter\u2019s words of comfort. Since when did her daughter comfort her so obediently rather than lash out?The only way she can calm her mind was by reasoning that perhaps her daughter has now become sensible after falling down those stairs. Well, it\u2019s good that she\u2019s safe and healthy, so nothing else should matter.The confusion on Mother Xin\u2019s face cleared up at once, which caused Xin Siyue to sigh in relief.\u2018Yes, good. I successfully made it through!\u2019 At any rate, even if some unfortunate event was waiting for her in the future, everyone will know now that she lost her memory. That way, they won\u2019t pursue her misdeeds to the end.Xin Siyue spend the next half of the month taking good care of herself. She listened as her \u2018family\u2019 members took turns trying to tell her of her experiences, along with all kinds of important and minor details, day after day.But out of all the information, there were only two details that Xin Siyue considered useful. One is that her father was Xin Jin and the other is that her mother was Bai Ning. These things were never mentioned in the novel. When the original author mentioned their suicide, she simply called them \u201cFather Xin and Mother Xin.\u201dOut of the past several days she has stayed with them, she truly felt like a daughter who was doted on by her elders. They sincerely wanted to give her everything she asked for. And although Xin Qiancheng occasionally showed a bad attitude towards her, his tone layered with impatience, she could still feel the man\u2019s love for his only sister. He simply wasn\u2019t good at expressing it.In times when Xin Siyue was alone, she always felt that if she lived this way in the real world, it would surely be the kind of life that everyone envies. Her present family\u2019s economic standing was superior, and there was family love and harmony. Xin Siyue\u2019s current physical health gave her many advantages that she never had in her past life!Back in her world, she was born in the countryside to a poor family. Her mother wasn\u2019t in good health while her father was an undisciplined and profligrate man. They quarreled with each other all year round, sometimes so fiercely that no one else could stop them. After Xin Siyue graduated from high school, her parents soon divorced.She then went on to college and attended part time, and soon after her graduation, she went on to poor primary schools among the mountains to teach. However, Xin Siyue never expected that before she could complete two years of teaching, she suddenly transmigrated into a novel.In fact, she was still quite confused right now; in the end, was her previous life real, or was her present life the actual real thing? How can such a strange event be possible?Over time, she convinced herself to accept it. Rather than waking up every morning with a panic-stricken face, checking her surroundings to see whether she has left the novel world and returned back to her own world, it was better to get used to her situation.In addition, she also learned from her family that she was now at her sophomore year on her second semester.Xin Siyue knew that the villainess originally aimed for a Dance major, but later changed it to the Art Department to chase after Chen Sinan. That\u2019s because right next to the Art Department was the Construction and Engineering Department which Chen Sinan attended.Two days before going to school, Xin Siyue considered the fact that she personally had no talent for drawing. Was it too late for her to switch departments now? Will she be able to do it?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - Crossing PathsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.7 Crossing PathsXin Siyue\u2019s questions were answered the day she returned to school.After Xin Qiancheng drove her to her college, he paid the Dean\u2019s office a visit for ten minutes before walking out the door and handing over a piece of paper to her directly. It was a written consent on transferring her department. Below was the Dean\u2019s signature along with the school\u2019s bright red seal.Xin Siyue was shocked silly. Was it so easy to change departments in this era? And wasn\u2019t she in the second semester of her sophomore year?Seeing his own sister wide-eyed with surprise, such a straightforward expression left Xin Qiancheng feeling helpless. Although it was a little unpleasant back then to see her unrestrained arrogance, her current expression was also annoying to look at. Yes he was smart, but what should he do about his own sister\u2019s lack of brain cells!Xin Qiancheng had to lower his pride as he finally explained things to her in a dignified manner: \u201cHalf of the investments in this school comes from our Xin family. If you want to change departments, it\u2019s simply a matter of saying one sentence.\u201d After saying so, he privately thought to himself: \u2018The fact that I came here personally was more than enough to show the Dean some respect.\u2019Xin Siyue clicked her tongue and said half-jokingly: \u201cSure enough, with money, even ghosts will be willing to do the grinding for you.\u201d**(T/N: Chinese idiom, as long as you have the money, someone will always be willing to do the job for you.)\u201cThen you\u2019re the one bribing the ghosts,\u201d said Xin Qiancheng good naturedly. He knew that she intentionally made fun of him so he replied in a good mood. Just before he could finish his sentence, he looked up slightly and noticed a young man approaching, not far away.Chen Sinan wore a white short-sleeved shirt with one hand lazily resting in his pockets. He walked onwards without a care, and with each step, the aura of a young master could not be denied.Xin Siyue was curious as to why her brother suddenly looked so defensive. When she turned around to follow his line of sight, she immediately noticed an attractive, beautiful man.\u2018What the hell! He\u2019s as handsome as a devil!\u2019Although she cried out in her heart, she couldn\u2019t look away. At this time, Xin Qiancheng pulled her hand and dragged her forward. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dIt was a simple and concise command.Xin Siyue hurriedly looked back at her brother with some wonder: \u2018It\u2019s not like they encountered a monster, what was he in such a hurry for? Do the both of them have some kind of grudge?\u2019As she thought of this Xin Siyue happened to brush past the man, but then immediately noticed those thick brows, beautiful Phoenix eyes, and his high bridged nose. Complemented with his perfectly smooth and white skin, this was truly a stunning man!Xin Siyue nodded unconsciously as she assessed this person\u2019s appearance in her mind.Strangely enough, after she nodded her head, the handsome passerby released a sullen aura, as if wanting to keep her far out of his way.Xin Siyue was confused. It\u2019s not like she was trying to get close to him, ah! She simply nodded at him! It was subconscious! Did that stranger misunderstand something?\u201cBrother, is he your enemy?\u201d Xin Siyue changed the topic to indirectly express her innocence. She really didn\u2019t do anything wrong!Upon hearing this, Xin Qiancheng ceased to pull her forward and immediately stopped on his tracks. He turned around to stare at Siyue, then glanced back up at the other guy, but this time with a smile. This was the first time Xin Siyue saw him smile so openly after coming to this world.Suddenly, she felt a little frightened. Why did she have a bad feeling?Unexpectedly, Xin Qiancheng pointed at the handsome man who continued to walk away, then deliberately said in a loud voice, \u201cWhat, you don\u2019t know him?\u201dXin Siyue shook her head, \u201cIs he someone I know?\u201dSatisfied with her answer, Xin Qiancheng grinned once again and said meaningfully, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t know him. That\u2019s just an insignificant person.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Once again, she glanced at the man who stood four or five steps away from her. Is it coincidence, or does it seem like after her overhearing her conversation with her brother, the man resumed his earlier demeanor of business as usual? Was he someone she was supposed to know?Sure enough, after walking ahead a couple of steps with Xin Qiancheng, she heard her brother triumphantly say, \u201cGood, I finally got to a good slap on that Chen Sinan today! Why would anyone from our Xin family get along with him! He\u2019s hateful! He doesn\u2019t deserve to enter our sights!\u201dRather than pay attention to all his words, a single key word caught Xin Siyue\u2019s attention: \u2018Surnamed Chen? Does that person happen to be Chen Sinan?!\u2019 Based on his temperament, her guess can\u2019t be wrong.Xin Siyue secretly frowned. It seems like the first day of coming to this school won\u2019t go smoothly\u2026Meanwhile, Chen Sinan entered the Dean\u2019s office and saw a white haired elder greet him with a smile. \u201cA\u2019nan, have you met with the Xin family earlier? They left just now.\u201d After that, he pointed to the door\u2019s direction.\u201cI don\u2019t know them well.\u201d Chen Sinan wasn\u2019t surprised at all.The Dean failed to realize that this young man\u2019s flat tone was an indirect indication of his displeasure. The elder continued to happily say, \u201cI heard that the young daughter of the Xin family had deliberately transferred over to the Art Department to chase after you, but now, she has once again changed her major to learn broadcasting and hosting. I recall that both majors are east and west of your department?\u201d\u201cThat has nothing to do with me. Uncle Zhao, I came here today to talk to you about the project. If you want to continue talking about unimportant things, then I won\u2019t be staying.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m simply talking about your family life, why be so serious about it? Alright, whatever you say.\u201dJust when this uncle thought the topic was over, Chen Sinan specifically explained, \u201cShe\u2019s not part of my family and isn\u2019t going to be. Uncle Zhao shouldn\u2019t bring up this topic later.\u201dPresident Zhao\u2019s face blackened\u2026does this teenager have to take it so seriously?The news that Xin Siyue changed her major once again immediately spread like wildfire throughout the Department of Fine Arts. After all, back then, she had stirred up the entire college when she officially announced her pursuit towards Chen Sinan.Xin Siyue packed up her things to transfer to her new dormitory. During this time, she became deeply aware that one reason why the villainess died was due to her failure to communicate with those around her. At least while Xin Siyue packed her bags, not one of her three roommates went up to talk to her or lend her a hand.Seeing their attitude towards the villainess, she was simply left speechless.Xin Siyue closed her suitcase, stood up, and noticed the three roommates still standing in place while staring quietly at her. Upon making eye contact, they quickly looked away, pretending to stare off elsewhere or busying themselves with other things.After some thought, Xin Siyue spoke: \u201cI want to move to the student dormitory at the West Wing. If there is a chance, then I\u2019ll\u2013\u201d halfway through her sentence, she wanted to say that she\u2019ll make time to visit them or hang out, but then it might be inappropriate promise such a thing if she likely won\u2019t contact them in the future.Indeed, she never imagined that the villainess and her roommates would have such a stiff relationship. Thus, she could only leave with these parting words: \u201cThank you. Goodbye.\u201dAfter Xin Siyue rolled her suitcase out of the dormitory door, she heard a clear voice behind her say: \u201cWhat just happened? Did Xin Siyue actually apologize earlier?\u201d\u201cYeah! Why do I feel as if she\u2019s broken her head and her whole temperament has changed?\u201d\u201cHa ha, if her accident changed her character completely, then she should be grateful to Sister Shi Shi. If it weren\u2019t for them encircling her, she wouldn\u2019t have fallen so badly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If it weren\u2019t for them encircling her, she wouldn\u2019t have fallen so badly.\u201dAt this time, Xin Siyue had not yet left, and was currently standing outside the room\u2019s entrance. Upon overhearing their conversation, she raised an eyebrow and pondered: \u2018Shi Shi? Could it be that someone deliberately pushed the villainess down the stairs before she transmigrated over to this world?\u2019Ha ha, when she read this novel back then, nothing like this was mentioned at all. Aside from trying to avoid Chen Sinan, why does it seem like plenty of other troubles are waiting for her?But it\u2019s better to take one\u2019s time. It will never be too late to get back at her enemies, since right now, Xin Siyue had better things to do.In her previous life, she had always dreamed of becoming a TV host after her graduation. Why study teaching and education when she now had the opportunity to start all over again? In addition to her rare advantages this life, Xin Siyue thought: \u2018No matter what, since I\u2019m given a second chance at life, I should make my dreams come true this time. That way, I\u2019ll feel joy and satisfaction in my heart.\u2019After moving into her new dormitory, Xin Siyue introduced herself to her new roommates. The beautiful girl with short, yellow hair didn\u2019t look at her at all while the other two roommates stared closely at her without a word. Hearing no response, Xin Siyue ended her introductions there.Anyways, she did what she could do, even if other couldn\u2019t accept her. This was a consequence left behind by the villainess, and had little to do with herself.So Xin Siyue resumed her routine of studying all day long. Class, another class, then the library. Fortunately, the subjects studied during her sophomore year of class weren\u2019t too profound in regards to the profession. It wasn\u2019t difficult to digest the topics to learn them considering her learning ability.But the numerous people who knew of Xin Siyue were gradually amazed. Why did this sister, who used to hate studying all day while chasing after Chen Sinan, suddenly change her temperament?Xin Siyue was more or less aware that people were scheming things behind her back, but she didn\u2019t care. They weren\u2019t people she knew anyways.That day, when she was on her way back to her dorm after borrowing a book from the library, a college billboard caught her eye. To her horror, she discovered her name up on the announcement\u2013how did her name appear on the list of finalists for the college song and dance competition?Xin Siyue preferred to believe that her eyes were playing tricks on her after being worn out from reading too many books. However, when she approached the board to confirm, she couldn\u2019t help but think: \u2018Oh no, this piece of news came too fast, ah! That student number, whose else can it be but mine?\u2019Xin Siyue\u2019s face lost all of its life. She didn\u2019t know how to dance at all, meaning\u2013she\u2019s done for!Upon noticing Xin Siyue stop on her tracks, Mao Shiyue suddenly turned vigilant. He immediately began to consider whether it was better to look ahead as if he didn\u2019t notice her, or if he should take out something to cover his face. After all, he was still horrified by her fierce appearance back then when she chased him down six times a day to get Chen Sinan\u2019s number.But unexpectedly, the girl glanced at the announcement posted on the billboard with a frown, then turned back with a heavy heart.Mao Shiyuan was shocked. Yes he was thinking about escaping at first, but what stunned him on the spot was how the girl walked passed him without even a glance.Her footsteps were light and steady while her brow didn\u2019t even wrinkle into a scowl. It\u2019s as if the both of them had become complete strangers to each other. Although they were indeed unfamiliar, Mao Shiyuan immediately thought of another question: \u2018Did this woman dare to change her routine to grab attention?\u2019Dream on! Chen Sinan won\u2019t be fooled, even if she did such a wise move!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - Playing Hard to Get?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.10 Playing Hard to Get?Oh his way back to his dormitory, Mao Shiyuan felt more and more indignant. Upon entering his room, he suddenly found Chen Sinan, that culprit, who rarely stayed in the dorms. Finally, he opened his mouth and said, \u201cYou were right to turn down Xin Siyue.\u201dChen Sinan, who was in search of something, suddenly stopped, half bent over, then looked up at him faintly.Mao Shiyuan didn\u2019t have to wait for him to reply; he was already satisfied with Chen Sinan\u2019s expression. \u2018That\u2019s right, why should he be interested about that girl?\u2019 In fact, this was simply Mao Shiyuan\u2019s self righteous thoughts. Chen Sinan\u2019s first reaction when hearing the surname \u2018Xin\u2019 was trying to recall which person this roommate was talking about, up until he heard the full name, Xin Siyue.\u201cThat Xin Siyue\u2019s schemes are very clever. First of all, she tried to chase me and block my path every day just so she can ask for your specific cell number and address. She would talk to me and smile, then try to flatter me as if I\u2019m her savior, but after you showed that you weren\u2019t interested in her, she simply walked past me like I was air\u2026\u201dChen Sinan retracted his gaze and continued to search for a document. \u201cWhat about her? I\u2019m not interested at all.\u201dBut Mao Shiyuan was curious. He leaned over the corner of the table and asked: \u201cDo you think Xin Siyue wants to go after me this time?\u201dAfter hearing this assumption, another roommate poured a glass of water on his shorts while scolding: \u201cDa Mao**, aren\u2019t you jumping to conclusions? If Xin Siyue were to chase again after someone, that someone would still be Chen Sinan. So even if she was rejected by him, in conclusion, there\u2019s still no place for you at all!\u201d(T/N: Da Mao\u2013derogatory nickname for Mao Shiyuan, i can\u2019t figure out the meaning)\u201cGo! Get out of here!\u201d Mao Shiyuan snapped back. What upsets him most is when someone calls him \u2018Da Mao.\u2019 What was so wrong with having \u2018Mao\u2019 as his surname?The more Mao Shiyuan thought of it, the more he couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhen she left, I looked at the billboard she was staring out and discovered she was staring at the contestant list for the college\u2019s Song and Dance competition. Did she join because she found out that you would be one of the judges that day?\u201dUpon hearing this, Chen Sinan straightened up and considered it. If Mao Shiyuan hadn\u2019t mentioned this matter, he would\u2019ve completely forgotten his promise to Ji Yin that he would be one of the judges.However, when he thought of Xin Siyue, Chen Sinan suddenly recalled a memory two weeks ago in front of the Dean\u2019s office, when the girl said that she didn\u2019t recognize him at all. Was that true or was she simply acting? Or was this simply her scheme of playing hard to get?Just as he was about to think further in this direction, Chen Sinan decisively cut off this train of thought.Why go through the trouble of thinking of this unimportant person?On one corner, Mao Shiyuan continued to gossip: \u201cI heard that Xin Siyue changed her major to broadcast and hosting, which is really far from our department. And since the beginning of this month, she no longer squats in front of our dormitory to bring you breakfast and midnight snacks. If these are signs that she has abandoned you, then you can also assume that\u2026\u201dChen Sinan looked at him and slowly said: \u201cIs your Chinese at an elementary school level?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dChen Sinan gave him that look that seems to say \u2018It\u2019s a waste of my energy to explain it to you, idiot.\u2019Mao Shiyuan asked in confusion, \u201cDo you have something you wanted to say?\u201dThe other roommate could no longer stand seeing this so he explained, \u201cYou fool, he says your language skills are poor because you\u2019re misusing the word \u2018abandoned.\u2019 Who is Ah Nan to be abandoned, or is it your turned to be abandoned?\u201d(reminder: Ah Nan is Chen Sinan\u2019s nickname)Based on this roommate\u2019s perspective, even if Shen Wenyang left him in the past, the two of them never had a definite relationship. One can only say that Shen Wenyang was loved too deeply by Chen Sinan that she had to leave to a faraway country.But how can a man like Chen Sinan be someone abandoned by a woman? As long as he used his inherited handsome looks to stand out, just a finger\u2019s movement was needed to attract bees and butterflies. Naturally, someone would end up sticking to him like glue, chasing him everywhere.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - Dropping OutPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.11 Dropping OutChen Sinan was too lazy to deal with these two bored roommates. After finding the documents he was searching for, he turned around and asked: \u201cAfter a while, the subsidiary company will be very busy. Before that, what do you think about going to dinner together?\u201dChen Sinan had his own apartment aside from this dorm, so he seldom comes back here for the past year unless something happens at school. Mao Shiyuan also knows that when Chen Sinan gets busy, his whereabouts become elusive, appearing at one moment then disappearing the next. So as soon as he invited them to eat, Mao Shiyuan immediately waved his hand and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go! We\u2019ll eat at the most expensive restaurant in the neighborhood!\u201dWhen Xin Siyue returned to her dormitory there was only one person present. Zhong Qin applied a face mask after coming out of the bath.After being here for the past month and a half, most of her roommates still held distant attitudes, but since they\u2019ve been together for some time now, they would chat from time to time. In her opinion, it was quite harmonious.Within this room, the most gentle and easy-going person was Zhong Qin, so it was easier to talk to her in private.Upon seeing Xin Siyue\u2019s sad face when entering, Zhong Qin couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dXin Siyue looked at her roommate who wore a face mask and asked: \u201cIs it possible to waiver my participation in the college song and dance competition?\u201d It should be common for contestants to pull out halfway through a competition.Zhong Qin sat up in surprise, \u201cYou won\u2019t be participating?\u201dSince another person from the dorm, Sun Miaomiao, joined the competition, many students paid close attention to the list of contestants.Xin Siyue nodded, \u201cI really don\u2019t want to participate.\u201dZhong Qin asked in curiosity, \u201cDidn\u2019t you intentionally join the competition to become famous and grab Chen Sinan\u2019s attention? When the auditions were held, you even vowed to win the championship!\u201d\u201cHehe\u2026.is that what happened?\u201d Xin Siyue recalled that in the novel, as soon as the female protagonist left abroad, the next two years of the plot were focused mainly on the male lead and the villainess. And what was written were the villainess\u2019 earth-shaking pursuits after the male lead. In other words, the author is constantly tearing down the villainess\u2019 IQ while speeding up her impending death.Xin Siyue subconsciously believed that she could avoid a lot of things by claiming amnesia, but she never expected that there was still so much to clean after.Zhong Qin nodded very seriously and affirmed: \u201cYou really said that.\u201dXin Siyue wearily put her hand over her forehead. She recalled that when the second part of the competition was held, Chen Sinan was also among the judges. That time, the villainess performed a dance while wearing sexy, revealing clothes, and afterwards confessed to the male protagonist on the microphone. What did she say that time?Anyways, what she recalled was that Chen Sinan\u2019s face darkened on the spot, not daring to even spare a glance on the villainess. He treated it as if she were a monkey playing cheap tricks.Xin Siyue thought to herself: \u2018Before the female protagonist returns, I\u2019ll just avoid meeting with Chen Sinan. Anyways, by the time the female lead comes back, Chen Sinan will be devoted to his princess while I\u2019ll just graduate peacefully. No one will recall any embarrassing moments related to me.\u2019So she feigned a helpless expression and replied to Zhong Qin: \u201cActually, I\u2019ve lost all of my memories ever since falling down the stairs last time.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhong Qin was stunned. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost your memory?\u201dJust when Xin Siyue nodded, the dormitor door opened and Sun Miaomiao walked in wearing an open shouldered dress while exposing her brilliantly white legs. Upon seeing the pair in the room, she didn\u2019t mention overhearing their conversation, and instead said: \u201cI\u2019m in a good mood today, so I\u2019ll treat you. Let\u2019s go out and have a good time together.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

During her first day at her new dorm, Sun Miaomiao\u2019s disdainful gaze left a bad impression on her, which is why she seldom spoke to this roommate. What\u2019s more, Xin Siyue wouldn\u2019t speak ill of this girl openly, especially since Sun Miaomiao is the one offering to treat them. It\u2019s very likely that she\u2019ll be coming back again and again to invite them. So troublesome!But she couldn\u2019t just refuse.The three young ladies packed up and left their dorms. On their way, Zhong Qin continued to ask: \u201cDo you really want to quit the competition?\u201dXin Siyue nodded.She won\u2019t go, definitely not!\u2019Seeing how firm she was in her decision, Zhong Qin lamented: \u201cWhat a pity, you dance so well!\u201dXin Xiyue felt a tinge of guilt. That\u2019s not her, she can\u2019t dance at all!When Sun Miaomiao learned that she was going to withdraw from the competition out of her own initiative, she pretended to be surprised as she said: \u201cSiyue, you\u2019re going to withdraw?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cOh, what a pity.\u201d Sun Miaomiao added: \u201cAre you afraid of embarrassing yourself in front of Chen Sinan? After all, you were rejected so badly after you\u2019ve chased him for so long. Are you using amnesia as an excuse as a reason to step down this time?\u201dFor some reason, Xin Siyue felt that Sun Miaomiao\u2019s last words were spoken quite harshly. As soon as she turned to ask her what she meant by that, Xin Siyue immediately noticed a young man at three o\u2019clock from her direction, with his head bowed down slightly. Who could it be other than Chen Sinan?Xin Siyue\u2019s eyes stopped for a moment on Sun Miaomiao, who was staring at Chen Sinan, and then back on that devil again for another second. Finally she reacted\u2013 \u2018I\u2019m outta here! Sh*t! Is it too late for me to leave now?\u2019Xin Siyue\u2019s scalp went numb. She really didn\u2019t want to see Chen Sinan now of all times!Although he had all the virtues that an excellent male protagonist would have in a romance novel, Chen Sinan had one of the most undesirable faults\u2013all his good qualities were only in favor of the female protagonist!No matter how rich, good-looking, capable, or attractive and dedicated he was, just that one fault of his can become a fatal wound. She will only get hurt if she falls in love with him, so she mustn\u2019t fall for him at all costs!Moreover, she knew of Chen Sinan\u2019s ruthlessness. When the villainess knelt on the ground and cried for mercy, asking him to let her family go, he arrogantly stared back at her without a word.Xin Siyue valued life much more than money. Now that the Xin family was on the right track, she had no desire to head towards the villainess\u2019 tragic ending all because of a love that would never be real.She didn\u2019t want the surname \u2018Chen\u2019 at all.As she pondered, she couldn\u2019t help but look meaningfully at Sun Miaomiao. There were so many characters who ended up in accidents for liking the male protagonist. Since the villainess in the novel never switched to a broadcast and hosting major, naturally, Sun Miaomiao was never mentioned. But who would\u2019ve guessed she\u2019d appear at this time, trying to vie for people\u2019s attention.Xin Siyue inwardly rolled her eyes. \u2018Hey, can\u2019t we just have a good time hanging out?\u2019Upon noticing Xin Siyue\u2019s complicated expression, Sun Miaomiao smiled brightly and said: \u201cXin Siyue, what a coincidence, Chen Sinan is also there. Don\u2019t you want to go and talk to him?\u201dXin Siyue raised an eyebrow and quietly stared back at her. Instead of rushing to answer, she asked the waiter who happened to come to their side: \u201cMay I know if there\u2019s a vacancy upstairs?\u201dThe waiter answered: \u201cI\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s full upstairs. Would the three of you like to come this way instead?\u201dXin Siyue found that the direction he pointed to was just behind where Chen Sinan and his group were seated.She remained on the spot, frowning.Sun Miaomiao had already stepped forward and walked past, her waist and legs swaying seductively.Xin Siyue knew this woman wouldn\u2019t stop! While she was dragged to the table by Zhong Qin, she bitterly scolded in her heart: \u2018Surname Sun, if you invite me to eat out again, I\u2019d rather write my name \u2018Xin Siyue\u2019 upside down!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What a coincidence.\u201dChen Sinan didn\u2019t reply at all.Sun Miaomiao felt a little embarrassed. She seldom summoned up the courage to talk to Chen Sinan, which is why she borrowed Xin Siyue\u2019s presence. This man\u2019s attitude towards Xin Siyue was obvious to everyone here. Her plan was that, even if Chen Sinan ignores her, Xin Siyue definitely wouldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to get his attention. As long as this scene continues, Sun Miaomiao won\u2019t appear so bad when standing next to someone like Xin Siyue.But after standing here for several seconds, Xin Siyue still remained unresponsive!Sun Miaomiao began to lose her composure, so she hurriedly looked towards Xin Siyue.Mao Shiyuan and his roommates were in a good mood while waiting to see this drama develop. They also noticed where Sun Miaomiao was looking and found that Xin Siyue, who wore a light beige dress, particularly stood out among the two other girls who were approaching.The color of her plain dress complimented her next and her arms, while her hair, which had been dyed black some time ago, was simply tied up in a ponytail, making her appear more refreshing and comfortable.She had no makeup on her face, but she appeared more beautiful than before when she used to apply heavy makeup. Especially those big eyes filled with spirit, and those long black lashes that fluttered.When Mao Shiyuan spotted her last time, he was so anxious to hide that he didn\u2019t pay attention to her appearance. After not seeing her for a month, he only realized now that she seemed to have changed as a person.After two more glances, he immediately turned to Chen Sinan, who, to his disappointment, simply acted like an outsider who had nothing to do with any of this. Mao Shiyuan really felt like beating this guy up.Noticing the gawking stares from the two other boys who shared Chen Sinan\u2019s table, Xin Siyue examined them openly as well, trying to figure out who they were. After pondering about it for a while, Xin Siyue still couldn\u2019t recall their names or background.Well, since these were guys who hung out with Chen Sinan, it\u2019s better to avoid them.When Zhong Qin saw the Sun Miaomiao had no intentions to withdraw, she kindly went up beside her and asked: \u201cAre we sitting over there?\u201dSun Miaomiao replied: \u201cYes, sister, I\u2019ll go first.\u201dChen Sinan didn\u2019t even raise his eyelids. Instead, Mao Shiyuan politely said: \u201cGo head.\u201dSun Miaomiao\u2019s face blushed with unspeakable embarrassment.Xin Siyue unintentionally lifted the corners of her lips and laughed silently to herself: \u2018Haha, serves you right!\u2019Chen Sinan was someone she knew best\u2013he won\u2019t look upon any woman except the female protagonist, not to mention those young girls at school who would spend all day in shopping malls, strong women who flaunted their fashion, or those wealthy and gentle sisters. Not one of them can afford this man.Chen Sinan can be described as someone who valued cleanliness. He hates it when girls pester him, touch his belongings, or have physical contact with him. Of course, the female protagonist is naturally excluded from this list.Knowing that Sun Miaomiao was trying to get a response from Chen Sinan\u2019s attractive eyes, Xin Siyue inwardly rolled her eyes. Hoping for that is simply an idiot\u2019s dream!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As she passed the protagonist\u2019s dinner table, she unconsciously quickened her pace, looking forward to leaving them.But contrary to her wishes, there are just some people who won\u2019t let her off the hook. In this case, it was a side character who didn\u2019t like being looked down on.When Mao Shiyuan saw that the other party was about to leave, he deliberately shouted to Xin Siyue, \u201cSister Xin, why are you going so fast? Aren\u2019t you going to say hello to your savior?\u201d\u2018Sister Xin?\u2019Xin Siyue turned around and doubtfully stared at the boy who just spoke. Although he looked fit and had a handsome face, somehow, the smile on his face seemed a little unkind.After at him several times, the boy\u2019s identity still didn\u2019t come to mind, so she pretended to ask innocently: \u201cWere you calling for me?\u201d\u201cWho else has the surname Xin here except you?\u201dXin Siyue secretly gritted her teeth. \u2018Who wants to talk with you?\u2019\u201cOh.\u201d After a faint reply, she was about to turn away.Mao Shiyuan stopped her again: \u201cYour male god is here, but you\u2019re not even going to greet him?\u201dSubconsciously, Xin Siyue felt like looking back at the male protagonist, but reason prevented her from doing so. Although she was only three steps away from Chen Sinan, she could still feel the fierce aura that emanated from him.Xin Siyue tried to smile in a relaxed manner and said, \u201cSorry classmate, but I don\u2019t know who you are.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know me?\u201d Mao Shiyuan was surprised.Xin Siyue nodded calmly.He asked in disbelief: \u201cWhat game are you playing now?\u201d\u201cSorry, I really don\u2019t know you.\u201d\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Mao Shiyuan pointed to Chen Sinan who had been quiet all this time while staring at her strangely.Xin Siyue glanced at Chen Sinan then immediately looked away as she replied: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t recognize him.\u201dBefore the other party could reply, she continued to say: \u201cExcuse me, classmate, but we\u2019re going to order dinner now.\u201d Afterwards, she dragged Zhong Qin and hurriedly walked away while completely ignoring Zhong Qin.Just two steps later, she felt a chilly gaze piercing at her direction, causing her to look back subconsciously. Just then, she caught Chen Sinan\u2019s gaze.Those handsome eyes narrowed as the man stared at her indifferently. Caught off guard, Xin Siyue was stunned as she saw her figure reflected in those deep, dark eyes.\u2018What the hell! It\u2019s a foul to have such beautiful eyes!\u2019As her pace slowed down, she noticed that his lips curved slightly upwards with a hint of ridicule. She immediately retracted her gaze and turned away. \u2018Damn it! Sh*t! I\u2019ve been cheated, that Chen Sinan did it on purpose!\u2019 It was if he was making fun of her for having bad acting skillsThat day, she wasn\u2019t lying at all that day when she told Xin Qiancheng that she didn\u2019t recognize the passerby. Who would\u2019ve guessed that the passerby was Chen Sinan himself!Fortunately, no one seemed to notice the momentary eye contact they just had. Xin Siyue felt slightly relieved.Zhong Qin took her arm and asked again: \u201cSiyue, did you really lose your memory after hurting your head last time?\u201dShe nodded and replied: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t recall anything before that event.\u201dZhong Qin looked at her sadly before secretly glancing at that expressionless Chen Sinan. She sighed: \u201cWhat a pity.\u201dOverhearing their conversation, Sun Miaomiao walked past them and whispered disdainfully: \u201cOnly ghosts will believe that.\u201dMao Shiyuan was also surprised. He leaned towards Chen Sinan and asked: \u201cHas Xin Siyue really lost her memory? If she has, then that would explain her weird behavior today!\u201dChen Sinan snorted with disdain and was too lazy to answer his room mate\u2019s question. He didn\u2019t believe that she had lost her memories at all! That look of hers was clearly a dodging one, but he wasn\u2019t interested in it at all. Amnesia as an excuse was just right; it would save him the trouble of entangling with her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That girl changes easily. Hah, looks like we won\u2019t be having anymore free breakfasts or lunches in the future. Oh yeah, that soup! The more I think about it, the worse I feel\u2026\u201dChen Sinan slowly replied, \u201cIf you like her, then man up and chase her.\u201dMao Shiyuan repeatedly waved his hand and replied, \u201cNo, never mind! Forget it!\u201d Who in town doesn\u2019t know how troublesome the eldest daughter of the Xin family is. It\u2019s difficult to talk to her, even if you talk with reason.Everyone around the table ate heartily except for Chen Sinan. Of course, they were deeply curious about the relationship between Xin Siyue and Chen Sinan, and why Sun Miaomiao seemed to hate Xin Siyue.From time to time, Xin Siyue would glance fiercely at Chen Sinan\u2019s back in irritation as she ate one bite after another.Since she really wanted to throw him down, perhaps she should go ahead and do it.Xin Siyue sighed. After some thought, she concluded that Chen Sinan was truly a source of disaster, since this whole time, everyone\u2019s only been talking about this femme fatale!It wasn\u2019t easy to pass through Chen Sinan\u2019s group to reach the cashier counter. Once she got the chance, Sun Miaomiao immediately stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to pay first.\u201dMeanwhile, Xin Siyue, who had just returned from the restroom, paused as she wiped her hands dry. The corner of her mouth twitched\u2013 \u2018Have I made a mistake? I\u2019m sure I just paid the bill before I went to the restroom!\u2019Just when Xin Siyue was about to tell Sun Miaomiao this unfortunate news, she froze on the spot. If she stopped Sun Miaomiao, who was approaching Chen Sinan\u2019s group, wouldn\u2019t this cause this girl\u2019s grudge towards her to swell up?Xin Siyue stood on the spot as she watched Sun Miaomiao approach the cashier counter. On the way, the girl stopped by Chen Sinan\u2019s table, and with a shy blush, asked him if he had paid his bill yet. However, the young man didn\u2019t reply.When Sun Miaomiao finally got to the cashier, she found out that their bill was already paid. The girl turned around and stared at Xin Siyue in surprise. Of course, Xin Siyue didn\u2019t fail to notice the spark of fire in the girl\u2019s eyes.\u2018Yeah, it looks like my kind deed turned into something bad.\u2019Xin Siyue hurried back to her seat then bent over to check her phone.When Mao Shiyuan overheard that the other groups\u2019 bill was already paid, he raised his head to peek at Xin Siyue. Then, he heard Sun Miaomiao explain weakly, \u201cHaha, that\u2019s just the kind of person Siyue is, someone who likes to brag about her wealthy family. Before coming here, I definitely said that I was the one treating this time.\u201dAs if none of this had anything to do with him, Chen Sinan glanced up at Sun Miaomiao, his eyes containing unhidden displeasure.Sun Miaomiao realized that she would annoy the young man if she lingered, so she hurriedly excused herself and returned to her seat. However, from that time onwards, she didn\u2019t glance once at Xin Siyue or talk to her.Xin Si Yue shrugged. She didn\u2019t care anyway.As Mao Shiyuan walked out of the dining room, he couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cIs it me or has Xin Siyue changed a lot?\u201dHis roommate agreed. \u201cI think so too.\u201dMao Shi Yuan nodded. \u201cI can feel she\u2019s changed. She\u2019s less annoying now though.\u201dHis roommate commented: \u201cActually, even before, I didn\u2019t think she was hateful at all. Although she was very straightforward when chasing after a guy, I like a girl who\u2019s as frank as her. When it comes to people, it\u2019s better to be with someone frank rather than with a person who has a hidden agenda, unlike that roommate of hers who obviously wanted to lay a trap for others when she was actually just acting like an innocent white lotus.\u201dMao Shiyuan, who shared the same opinion, was about to reply when Chen Sinan suddenly interrupted: \u201cAre you all so bored that you have to gossip behind someone\u2019s back?\u201d Although it was a question, it put an end to Mao Shiyuan\u2019s and the group\u2019s discussion.Right, they all knew that Chen Sinan hated it most when they talked about Xin Siyue. The person who had crazily chased after him from childhood til now, and the girl who brought him endless trouble and complications was none other than Xin Siyue.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She needed to forfeit as soon as possible.Apparently, the Student Council was in charge of holding this contest. President Ji Yi was a third-year university student who coincidentally studied in the same field as Chen Sinan.Upon hearing her desire to forfeit, President Ji Yi\u2019s face wrinkled in confusion. \u201cSister Xin, everything\u2019s been going well up to now. Why do you want to forfeit?\u201dXin Siyue looked back at his perplexed eyes and gave a vague answer: \u201cI\u2019ve been busy these days so there\u2019s no time for me to participate.\u201dJi Yi didn\u2019t plan to let her off just yet. \u201cI still remember when you boldly stated that you were going to claim first prize.\u201d\u201cHaha,\u201d Xin Siyue smiled, not wanting to explain any further. \u201cAnyways, I don\u2019t want to join this contest anymore. I\u2019m here to talk to the one in charge of this competition. Even if you don\u2019t agree, I have no choice.\u201dThen, just as she was about to walk away, she heard Ji Yi comment: \u201cTurns out Sister Xin\u2019s isn\u2019t the kind of person who keeps her promises.\u201dXin Siyue kept silent as she thought to herself privately: \u2018No matter, it\u2019s not like I was the one who promised.\u2019When Ji Yi saw no reaction from her, he had to use Chen Sinan\u2019s name. \u201cAre you afraid that you would embarrass yourself in front of Senior Chen if you encounter him during the competition?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201dJi Yi was even more interested in the topic. \u201cIsn\u2019t it true that you love Senior Chen so much that you would hover between life and death for him? Why would you give up after just one year of chasing him?\u201dXIn Siyue couldn\u2019t help but roll her eyes as she thought to herself: \u2018In more than a year, even a cold stone should\u2019ve warmed up under the sun.\u2019(T/N: Chen Sinan\u2019s heart is still stone cold even after a year of pursuit\u2026nothing\u2019s changed)She replied lazily, \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve already stopped by the edge of the abyss, and now I\u2019ve turned around and made my way back to the shore. Didn\u2019t you say that I loved him so much that I even hovered between life and death? I\u2019ve already died once. If I still don\u2019t change my mind, wouldn\u2019t it be no different from seeking death one more time?\u201dJi Yi was choked by her words. He didn\u2019t know how to retort. Although he had many chances to speak to Xin Siyue, he had never heard that she was a person with a sharp tongue!Ji Yi squinted and observed her for a while before continuing, \u201cEven if you change yourself for Senior Chen\u2019s sake, he still won\u2019t pay attention to you. Senior Sister Shen was such a perfect school girl, but she only received bits of Senior Chen\u2019s appreciation. She never even got to earn the official title as his girlfriend. But looking at your sincere face that shows no desire, it shows that you know when to withdraw when facing difficulty. If you happen to win Senior Chen\u2019s heart, I\u2019ll admire you sincerely.\u201dXin Siyue\u2019s lips twitched in annoyance as she replied, \u201cThanks for the reminder.\u2018The heck! It\u2019s the first time that we\u2019ve met and yet you\u2019re acting as if you know my mind! We obviously had no interaction before!\u2019Ji Yi appeared several times in the novel, but after the supporting female character left the campus, this man won\u2019t have any roles left, right?Xin Siyue looked down on shameless people like him.She clearly said she wanted to forfeit, and yet this man was so bored that he went after her at the library and at her dorm, just so he could convince her again and again to join the competition.After Xin Siyue left the library, she headed straight for the cafeteria, while Ji Yi chased after her. Just when she got in line to get her meal, Ji Yi stuck beside her like a minion, trying to brainwash her to join. \u201cJust take part in the contest. You\u2019ll have a chance to see Senior Chen! You know, I even spent a lot of time to persuade him to be a judge at the competition.\u201d\u201cThat has nothing to do with me.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be any fun if you don\u2019t join.\u201dUpon hearing this, Xin Siyue gave him a sarcastic smile. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting time persuading me to join just so you can add oil to the flames and catch more attention?\u201dIn this university, she was infamous for persistently chasing after Chen Sinan. Moreover, Senior Chen will be at the competition, so more people will be coming to watch the fun. And those girls who had crushes on this male god, but were too shy to voice out their feelings, will be using Xin Siyue to probe Chen Sinan\u2019s mind.No matter what, watching the contest will only bring them more benefits than harm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019ll at least put in a good word for you in front of Senior Chen.\u201dXin Siyue let out a quiet chuckle. \u201cThank you, but no need.\u201d She thought to herself: \u2018You think you can speak such words in front of Chen Sinan? You think too highly of yourself!\u2019Afterwards, she no longer paid him any attention. Although Ji Yi still wanted to bother her, he was summoned by a phone call.No longer having that annoying voice by her ears, Xin Siyue was quite satisfied. Yes, she could finally have her meal in peace.Not far from her, Mao Shiyuan\u2019s chopsticks paused in midair as he pensively observed Xin Siyue from afar. He took out his phone and texted Chen Sinan: \u201cI heard that kid Ji Yi has been close to Xin Siyue lately. Is it true that she shifted her attention to Ji Yi since she knows that it won\u2019t work out with you?\u201dSeveral minutes passed, and he still didn\u2019t receive any reply.Mao Shiyuan sent another text message: \u201cI heard many people say that these two have been hanging out together recently. Is it true?\u201dSince Chen Sinan was at a meeting, he wasn\u2019t able to see this text.It wasn\u2019t until he finished work and left the dinner party that he received a phone call from Ji Yi on his way back. The student council President wanted to confirm the time of the contest for next week.Chen Sinan had already agreed to join as a judge, so he simply answered with a curt \u2018yes\u2019 before asking his assistant to cancel his schedule that night.Since the other party still hadn\u2019t hung up, Chen Sinan asked: \u201cWhat else?\u201dJi Yi gave a dry laugh and responded, \u201cSenior Chen, how are you and Xin Siyue doing these days?\u201dChen Sinan\u2019s brow twitched slightly. \u201cWhy ask? Just tell me what it is you want.\u201dJi Yi answered directly: \u201cXin Siyue said that since you\u2019ll be participating that night, she won\u2019t join the semi-finals, no matter how hard I\u2019ve tried to persuade her. I really want her to dance, but since she refuses to, there\u2019s nothing I can do. It\u2019s good that she\u2019s happy. She told me that she doesn\u2019t want to be involved in anything related to you. Senior Chen, what happened between the two of you?\u201dChen Sinan grinned as he leaned against his seat. He replied indifferently, \u201cIt\u2019s good that she knows herself well.\u201d He hung up immediately afterwards, no longer wanting to continue this conversation with Ji Yi.Meanwhile, a classmate who overheard their phone conversation, asked in surprise: \u201cWhat\u2019s your purpose in telling Senior Chen these things?\u201dJi Yi waved his hand and explained, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand! If Chen Sinan isn\u2019t interested in Xin Siyue, it would be for the better, right? Moreover, if what Xin Siyue says is true, then I\u2019m helping her indirectly, right? This is the most suitable method to get the two of them to hate each other.\u201dJi Yi pondered the issue more seriously. Senior Chen was like a son of heaven. How can an aloof school girl like Xin Siyue possibly get her finger in this peace of pie?If Xin Siyue knew of his thoughts right know, she would\u2019ve scoffed and said: \u201cAre all people in this novel crazy?!\u201dAfter Chen Sinan hung up, he read over Mao Shiyuan\u2019s texts before dragging his number into his blacklist.A week passed quickly. Soon, the night of the semi-finals had arrived.Xin Siyue wasn\u2019t planning on going to the venue, even though Zhong Qin told her that the semi-finals would be as big an event as the Lunar New Year\u2019s evening party.Since two of the \u201cFour MC Queens\u201d of the university would be the MC\u2019s for this round. Tonight will be their last time working together before they will graduate.(T/N: the term MC refers to the host of the program, a.k.a master of ceremonies or mic controller)Xin Siyue once heard about the Four MC Queens of the school. However, one was studying abroad, another has joined a TV station ahead of schedule, while the remaining two wanted to participate in this competition before graduating.However, Xin Siyue was really curious: \u201cWhy did the two sisters agree to be MC\u2019s for this semi-final round?\u201dIn theory, it was amazing luck that these well known MC\u2019s were both successfully invited for the final round.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Many people have guessed that this will be the last school activity he\u2019ll be attending here. Which means this is the last time they\u2019ll see him here!\u201dXin Siyue blinked in surprise. She muttered to herself: \u201cHow can that be? When the female protagonist returns, he\u2019ll return to school and give lectures so he can help her fulfil her dream.\u201d\u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d\u201cNothing, I was just wondering whether I should go or not.\u201d\u201cStop thinking, just go! It\u2019s a rare chance to see those two seniors on the same stage! Such a good opportunity, we wouldn\u2019t have a second chance to see this again!\u201dAfter being convinced, Xin Siyue followed Zhong Qin to the hall.The contest would start in ten minutes and the venue was already packed full of people.Zhong Qin had to push and squeeze to get two seats in the back. It wasn\u2019t even two minutes of being seated that Ji Yi suddenly appeared out of nowhere and waved to Xin Siyue while screaming, \u201cSee, you\u2019re here!\u201dXin Siyue threw him a quiet glance, indicating that she didn\u2019t want to talk to him.\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll take you to the front seats.\u201dWhile Xin Siyue still thought of it, Zong Qin jolted up and replied, \u201cThank you, President! Siyue, let\u2019s go.\u201dXin Siyue: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe moment Xin Siyue was seated on the second row, she couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous. So it turns out that they moved several rows ahead their previous ones?She wanted to run away.The first two rows were actually the places where the teachers and judges were seated.However, Zhong Qin was so excited that she pulled her head and said, \u201cSiyue, I\u2019ve never been treated so well when watching any competition! So it\u2019s true that there\u2019s a lot of good perks when going with you!\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201d Just when Xin Siyue was about to retort, a phone call interrupted her.The music in the hall was getting so loud that she had to walk out to receive the call.It was her mother, Bai Ning, calling to ask her why she didn\u2019t come home that night.\u201cHome?\u201d Xin Siyue was perplexed.\u201cYou come home every Friday night, don\u2019t you?\u201d Then, Bai Ning said in realization, \u201cOh, I forgot that you\u2019ve lost your memory.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d Xin Siyue didn\u2019t know what to say.Bai Ning went on to say: \u201cThen you should come home early tonight. I cooked you some soup. If it cools down by the time you\u2019re home, remember to heat it up before eating.\u201dAfter hanging up, Xin Siyue searched her memories and recalled that the villainess had her own apartment, one that was right next to Chen Sinan\u2019s.Previously, the villainess spent plenty of effort and even did the despicable deed of stalking the male protagonist to find out his address, which wasn\u2019t far from school.Afterwards, she bribed Chen Sinan\u2019s neighbors with a large sum of money so they could leave the apartment. She used this opportunity to move in next door and try win the male god\u2019s favor.Sigh, Xin Siyue wanted to die! It\u2019s quite pitiful that the villainess still didn\u2019t win his heart even after putting in so much effort.This was the fate of a villainess that would never change!While Xin Siyue was deep in thought of how to solve the housing issue, she failed to pay attention to the direction she walked in. Right when she turned around, she bumped into a broad chest.A refreshing, tender masculine scent entered her nose. Xin Siyue still had her cellphone in one hand. Baffled, she stared straight at a shirt that was unbuttoned at the collar, unable to pull her eyes away from that refined, faintly discernible collarbone\u2026\u2019dang! That white shirt looks so tempting!\u2019A thought popped up in Xin Siyue\u2019s head\u2013 \u2018I really want to trace my hands from that chest to those broad shoulders! Is that too perverted? If I act like a hooligan, will there be serious consequences?\u2019The two maintained a close but ambiguous position for several seconds until the other party couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. He opened his mouth and spoke coldly: \u201cHow long do you plan on sticking to me like this?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He said coldly: \u201cHow long do you plan on sticking to me like this?\u201d\u2018Such a cold voice?\u2019Xin Siyue had a bad hunch. She was hesitant at first, but when she finally raised her head to look up at the man\u2019s face, there was a loud \u2018thump\u2019 sound and a sharp pain pierced her forehead. Then she heard a clear voice exclaim: \u201cHey!\u201dXin Siyue was in such pain at their collision. She reached out and rubbed her aching forehead, feeling a little dizzy. The next second, she noticed Chen Sinan\u2019s handsome face looking down at her with a dark expression. She pushed him aside in fright and backed away several steps.However, she forgot that behind her was the top of a staircase, the very place where she made her phone call earlier while leaning against the railings. Now that she had backed away several steps, her right foot suddenly found no floor to step on and she inevitably lost her balance. Xin Siyue instinctively reached out and grabbed the last saving straw, which regretfully, was the sleeve of Chen Sinan\u2019s black suit.As she tightly held on to the sleeve for dear life, Chen Sinan\u2019s expression was as cold as ice.Just as Xin Siyue thought that she was going to fall on her back, the embarrassing event she imagined didn\u2019t happen, because Chen Sinan unexpectedly went forward several steps to hold her waist, saving her before she falls further.The frightened Xin Siyue was now in his arms. She grasped his right arm tightly while the other hand pulled at his clothes. She breathed heavily in his embrace, and her legs seemed to have lost its strength.Once again, she experienced a near death experience, and the feeling of helplessness and terror of falling down the stairs was horrifying.Earlier, Chen Sinan was attending a dinner party, but he ended up coming here. Although he had rolled up his sleeves, the more than 30 degrees weather here made him feel hot and irritable. But at this moment, the slight fruity fragrance from the woman in his arms, along with the cold touch of her fingertips gave him a rare and pleasant sensation.Chen Sinan frowned. He loosened his arms around her slender waist and legs, straightened up, and said in a cold voice, \u201cIsn\u2019t that enough?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Xin Siyue looked up at him. Chen Sinan stepped back this time, as if trying to avoid something poisonous. His jaw still ached from their collision earlier.But when he glanced down at her after losing patience, he suddenly noticed her pair of moist eyes. Her lashes were long and her eyes teary, and underneath the light, those pair of eyes seemed amazingly bright.It was rare for Chen Sinan to feel surprised.Xin Siyue blinked while feeling mad that she teared up! If it wasn\u2019t for him, she never would\u2019ve gotten so frightened that she almost fell down the stairs!But what she didn\u2019t know was that her unconscious act of blinking made the onlooker feel as if she looked pitiful.Chen Sinan frowned slightly at the idea.Xin Siyue immediately came to her senses. Knowing that the man hated her, she quickly pulled back her hand that rested on his arm, and without saying a word, left straight towards the auditorium.She wanted to explain, but reason tells her not to try to explain things to him, lest Chen Sinan misunderstand.Chen Sinan, who had been standing in place for a time, finally moved and made his way to the auditorium while thinking to himself: \u2018After I said so many things to her, all she replied was a simple \u201cum\u201d? Well then, is it really her new goal to avoid me as if I\u2019m a snake?\u2019While thinking of this, Chen Sinan\u2019s gaze deepened as he stared at her slim figure in the distance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since she took good care of herself, her figure was curvaceous.As the girl sat down, Chen Sinan noticed her unintentionally glance up at him before immediately turning her head away in disgust.Chen Sinan\u2019s appearance in the auditorium had already caused quite a sensation in the crowds. When Ji Yi invited other people to sit at the judge\u2019s seats, unfortunately, there was only one remaining seat in the middle.Chen Sinan looked at the seat, then glanced sideways at Ji Yi.Ji Yi smiled and explained: \u201cI reserved the seat for Senior Chen! If not, I\u2019m afraid you wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201dChen Sinan whispered \u2018ah,\u2019 making it unclear whether he was satisfied or not.After he was seated, Xin Siyue, who had been playing with her cellphone with her head down, suddenly looked up at Ji Yi with a fierce glare. Ji Yi happily responded with a \u2018You\u2019ll have to thank me\u2019 expression on his face.Xin Siyue gritted her teeth as she thought: \u2018Sure enough, there\u2019s no free lunch in this world! This Ji Yi did it all on purpose! Otherwise, why would he have Chen Sinan sit right in front of her!Even several bored people in the room began to notice the subtle situation. Zhong Qin tugged Xin Siyue\u2019s sleeves and whispered in her ear: \u201cWhy is Senior Chen\u2019s seat right in front of you?\u201dXin Siyue was unhappy with her question, but she still controlled her tone as she replied: \u201cHow do I know?\u201d That bastard definitely set this up.When Zhong noticed her dissatisfied look, she hurriedly said, \u201cBut President Ji probably just wants to help you get closer to Senior Chen. He\u2019s given you a rare opportunity!\u201dUpon hearing their conversation, Chen Sinan, who sat upfront, lifted the corner of his lips and smirked. \u2018Hmph, who cares!\u2019Chen Sinan had little interest in these competitions. Since the program hasn\u2019t started yet, he looked through his mailbox to check the documents sent over by his assistant. Occasionally however, he would look up when hearing that slightly dissatisfied female voice that resounded clearly from behind him.\u2018Haha, women are very fickle.\u2019 They would spout all kinds of flattery and admiration while pursuing someone, but once they have new goal, the former is easily abandoned.Chen Sinan silently labeled her as someone who liked to \u2018play with people\u2019s feelings.\u2019Xin Siyue automatically blocked out the contents of the audience\u2019s whispers behind her, including their worship and love for Chen Sinan, their gossip of her crazy pursuits, and the strange coincidence that both their seats were this close to each other.At the start of the program, Xin Siyue tried to focus her attention on the two MC\u2019s. \u2018Um, their clothes were well chosen. The two of them also seem very generous and the occasion is handled in a very coherent and responsive manner. Also, they skillfully delivered their lines and properly grasped the emotions with their words.\u2019\u2018The two sisters also cooperated very well with each other.\u2019 After watching most of the program, Xin Siyue felt that she had gained a lot of knowledge. But the person in front of her had to go out and answer his phone from time to time, which made her feel irritated.Every time Chen Sinan stood up, a little disturbance would happen all around them, and the name \u2018Chen Sinan\u2019 would be mentioned by people hundreds of times.After who knows how many times the man had returned to his seat, Xin Siyue\u2019s mood finally flared up. She impulsively complained as he sat down: \u201cClassmate, can you please keep a low profile?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She impulsively complained as he sat down: \u201cClassmate, can you please keep a low profile?Xin Siyue felt as if her brain had malfunctioned! But she was glad that she didn\u2019t say it loudly, which means the other guy shouldn\u2019t have heard it. Even if he did hear, based on the script, he would surely continue to ignore her.But to her surprise, Chen Sinan turned around and looked at her.With that meaningful, cold glare of his\u2026Xin Siyue felt herself tremble unconsciously\u2013 \u2018I\u2019m finished!\u2019Sure enough, Chen Sinan, who seemed to have taken the wrong medicine tonight, retorted back at her lightly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you set an example yourself on keeping a low profile?\u201d\u2018WTF!\u2019Xin Siyue\u2019s mind was in a frenzy: \u2018Why is he talking to me? Does Chen Sinan have the wrong soul in him too? What do I do, what do I do?\u2019While her mind was stuck on this issue, Chen Sinan glanced at her lightly, seemingly indifferent to her response. He turned around and stared straight at the show ahead.And Xin Siyue, who remained seated, silently looked at the male protagonist\u2019s back and thought: \u2018Ah seriously! Even the guy\u2019s back looks so tempting, there\u2019s definitely something wrong with me!\u2019Likewise, all of the gossipers present were losing their minds at that same moment! Chen Sinan had walked in together with Xin Siyue earlier, and even their seats were right in front of the other. Not only that, the male god turned around and talked to her! What\u2019s going on between the two of them! Was Chen Sinan really seduced by that Xin Siyue? That\u2019s terrible!This time, neither the audience nor contestants were feeling calm.It wasn\u2019t easy to wait until the end of the program. After the MC\u2019s announced the results of the competition, the event wrapped up without a hitch and Chen Sinan stood up and shook hands with several of the school leaders. Xin Siyue didn\u2019t get up to see him, and of course, the main reason was to avoid suspicion.However, Xin Siyue clearly heard the principal respectfully call him: \u201cCEO Chen.\u201dUpon hearing such a respectful address, she couldn\u2019t help but think, do they really have to be so businesslike?Chen Sinan soon left the auditorium. Naturally, Zhong Qin didn\u2019t want to linger here any longer so she planned to go back to the dormitory. Meanwhile, Xin Siyue recalled that her mother, Bai Ning, left soup back at her apartment. She still had to go back, so she said her goodbyes to Zhong Qin before leaving.Zhong Qin looked at her and said teasingly, \u201cSiyue, we\u2019ve known each other for so long and we\u2019ve also shared the same dorm for a while now. Then tell me, how far have you and Mr. Shen progressed?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Xin Siyue didn\u2019t understand.Zhong Qin smiled and explained: \u201cDon\u2019t think that we have no clue. Just now, I saw Senior Chen turn around and talk to you deliberately!\u201dXin Siyue calmed down. \u201cHe\u2019s just\u2013\u201d\u201cJust what?\u201dBefore thinking more about what to reply, Xin Siyue simply threw a sentence: \u201cHe just forgot to take the right medicine today.\u201dAfter catching Zhong Qin off guard, Xin Siyue took this opportunity to slip away.\u2018Students who love gossip are really hard to deal with!\u2019As the crowd of students went to the front of the school gate, Xin Siyue also followed along while feeling confused. Where was her apartment located again?As she stood by the school gate, she carefully tried to recall where the male protagonist resided, but with someone as rich as him, there were several places to choose from to live alone. Xin Siyue didn\u2019t have the habit of memorizing a person\u2019s exact address. Since she simply glanced at it while reading the novel, nothing came to mind, even as she racked her brains.With no other choice, she sent a message to Xin Qiancheng, asking him to send a specific address.Xin Qiancheng was speechless. If his sister was this silly, how can he possibly save her in the future?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - Apartment (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.22 Apartment (1)Xin Siyue took a taxi to go to her so-called apartment. When she arrived at her destination, she looked up at the grand gate of her apartment complex and had a moment\u2019s hesitation. Did they have to design it so luxuriously?She stiffly went up the stairs step by step, thoroughly feeling like a country bumpkin ever since arriving in this world.Only then did she realize that she needed more time to adapt to the fact that she was now a local wealthy heiress.For half-an-hour, Xin Siyue strolled around the compound while enjoying the magnificent view. A serious question suddenly came to mind\u2013she had asked Xin Qiancheng what the address for her apartment was, but she forgot to inquire as well about her specific apartment unit and room number.Just as she took out her cell phone to trouble her brother once more, a slender and handsome figure caught her attention. The sleeves of the young man\u2019s long-sleeve shirt was pulled up and his suit coat was folded up and slung on his arms.Haha, it\u2019s Chen Sinan once again.Xin Siyue was about to turn around and hide, but just when she turned, another question came to mind: if she secretly followed after the male protagonist, wouldn\u2019t she be able to find her apartment?She clearly recalled that Xin Siyue\u2019s apartment was next door to Chen Sinan\u2019s.Following him would save her time trying to look around, because she had discovered that this apartment complex was quite large!After some consideration, she stealthily followed after Chen Sinan. Although she tried to make her footsteps very light and did her best not to get close to him, she was suddenly caught while only being less than 200 meters away from him.Chen Sinan\u2019s gaze was cold and fierce, the warning message in his eyes obvious.Xin Siyue was frightened by the terrible look in his eyes. She unconsciously shook off the feeling and comforted herself, thinking, \u2018What are you afraid of? It\u2019s not like I wronged him!\u2019With that in mind, she dared to reply: \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Chen Sinan sounded as if he heard a ridiculous joke. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you should ask yourself that question?\u201d\u2018It\u2019s that tone again!\u2019 It was that exact same tone he used in the auditorium, one filled with undisguised sarcasm.Xin Siyue looked straight at him and said in a small voice: \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking at you.\u201dHe laughed at her words.Xin Siyue muttered under her breath: \u201cCrazy!\u201dShe went forward two steps, but then recalling that she had no idea where her apartment was, she stopped in her tracks once again.Noticing her hesitation, Chen Sinan folded his arms across his chest and glanced at her lazily, his eyes filled with pride and ridicule.Xin Siyue glared at him, then decisively walked past him. She took out her cell phone and called Xin Qiancheng. \u201cBrother, what apartment number do I live in?\u201dWhen Chen Sinan heard her voice gradually fading into the distance, he unconsciously raised a brow. \u2018She doesn\u2019t even know where she lives, so does that mean she really lost her memory?\u2019He considered this even more when he saw how Xin Siyue kept trying to unlock her apartment door with several different keys. Unexpectedly, he felt like laughing: \u2018Rather than amnesia, hasn\u2019t this girl gone stupid?\u2019Chen Sinan picked up an important phone call halfway through, so he stopped in place and wasted a lot of time answering the call. Afterwards, he took the elevator and made his way back to his apartment.When he got there, he saw that tiny figure half bent over while foolishly trying to open the door with one key after the other. The girl cursed under her breath: \u201cHow can there be so many keys! Ugh, this isn\u2019t the one either!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Apartment (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.23 Apartment (2)Chen Sinan stood not too far behind, listening to the crisp sound of keys colliding. After a while, the door still showed no sign of opening.Suddenly, he couldn\u2019t stand witnessing her lack of IQ.After Xin Siyue tried several keys without success, she muttered in frustration, \u201cNo way, I obviously collected all of Xin Siyue\u2019s keys. How come none of these are right? Was there something I missed?\u201dShe was unable to find any solutions. As soon as she turned around, she saw Chen Sinan quietly standing behind her for who knows how long. She thought that he would\u2019ve reached his own apartment earlier than she did, since it took her a long time of circling before finding this spot after all.Without glancing at her, he went straight to the front door of his own apartment, took out his key, then unlocked it.When he opened his lock, Xin Siyue stared straight at the man\u2019s hand, waiting for him to pull out his key so that she could see what it looked like. She needed a reference so she can have an idea of the apartment\u2019s key design.What\u2019s annoying is that Chen Sinan seemed aware of her thoughts. He opened his door and pushed it straight in, then pulled his key out quickly before closing the door.Xin Siyue glared at that spot with bitter resentment, but half a second later, she recalled that a high-end looking key with a red string tied to it was hidden under her pillow in her dorm.Now that she remembered, she hurriedly traveled back to her dormitory to grab the keys. Sure enough, when she tried this on her apartment door, just a slight turn caused the knob to \u2018click.\u2019Xin Siyue excitedly pulled out the key. \u201cThat annoying guy dares to confuse me! Hmph!\u201d After muttering to herself, she glanced down at the red string and shook her head. In fact, the villainess was too infatuated with that man. Wrapping the key with a red string and hiding it under her pillow was evidence that she considered the handsome male protagonist as her only sustenance and source of hope.(T/N: red string\u2013symbol of fated lovers)However, the villainess never would\u2019ve expected that a miserable ending awaited her.Under the dim corridor light, Xin Siyue finally managed to open the door with her key.She retracted her key and smiled with pride. Just when she was about to enter, she heard her neighbor\u2019s door \u2018click\u2019 open and the sound of a woman\u2019s voice echoed: \u201cThink again, if you dare play tricks with me, I\u2019ll have your old man deal with you!\u201dFor a moment, Xin Siyue wondered who the woman was until she heard a familiar man\u2019s reply: \u201cEvery time, you keep trying to threaten me with my old man. Why would I trick you?\u201dNow that she knows this was related to Chen Sinan, she wanted to quickly enter into her apartment, but then the woman\u2019s voice behind her spoke: \u201cHuh? How can your neighbor be such a young girl?\u201dChen Sinan\u2019s mother, Weng Yinlin, wore a light gray dress with her skirt reaching to her knees. Even in her middle-age, her waist was still slender, and her face accentuated with makeup was full of charm.Xin Siyue observed this new face face and soon realized where Chen Sinan got his good genes; his mother was quite attractive.Xin Siyue\u2019s impression of Weng Yinlin was the same as any mother of a rich male protagonist in whichever novel\u2013she hated this type of lady very much. Even in the original novel for this world, this mother threatened the female protagonist to leave her son while promising \u2018any amount of money, even if it\u2019s thousands of dollars.\u2019 However, during that time, the female protagonist\u2019s career was flourishing, so she naturally humiliated Weng Yinlin\u2019s reputation in a merciless fashion. Weng Yinlin had to retreat in the end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Later on, she started her own entertainment company and even won the title of Film Empress numerous times. Who wouldn\u2019t treat her like a queen? Aside from the female protagonist who clashed with her, no one else had a chance of going against Weng Yinlin except for her son. That was why she got into trouble when trying to subdue the female protagonist.Anyways, in Xin Siyue\u2019s opinion, there would always be disagreements between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Since ancient times, there didn\u2019t have to be a good reason for someone to hate another.Xin Siyue\u2019s thoughts began to wander. \u2018When did Weng Yinlin gradually begin to accept the female protagonist?\u2019 It seems to be that year after her son\u2019s marriage, when Sheng Wenyang gave birth to a son. Since then, their friendship gradually began to develop.While in a daze, Xin Siyue had no idea that Chen Sinan glanced at her after hearing his mother\u2019s question. Naturally, he noticed that her door was still half-open.When he entered his apartment earlier, he heard her leave the apartment. How could she be back now? Perhaps she left to retrieve her keys before returning.Chen Sinan was surprised that this girl would still trouble herself and run back and forth diligently in the middle of the night.But thinking about it, the fact that she chases him diligently was one thing she was good at doing.Fearing that his mom might get the wrong idea, he unexpectedly spoke up and explained: \u201cMom, I don\u2019t know her.\u201d The implication behind his words was to avoid gossip and prying any further.Weng Yinlin stared at him in disbelief.Just now, he was clearly sneaking a glance at that girl, don\u2019t think that she didn\u2019t miss it! Getting this boy\u2019s attention was no easy feat!When Wen Yinlin looked at Xin Siyue once again, the girl nodded timidly in affirmation of Chen Sinan\u2019s claim. Afterwards, Xin Siyue said that she had to go, then smiled at the mom before quickly retreating into her room.Weng Yinlin noticed that the young girl had a clean face without any thick makeup, but was still quite a beauty. She wanted to ask a question or two, but never expected the girl to run away as if she was being chased by frightening beasts.Weng Yinlin was familiar with her son\u2019s way of speaking and mannerism since he was a child. She turned to her son and asked, \u201cDo you know her?\u201dChen Sinan impatiently replied, \u201cI just told you earlier.\u201dWeng Yinlin laughed and commented jokingly, \u201cIt\u2019s rare for a girl to not be swayed by your appearance when she sees you. She didn\u2019t seem to put you in her sights at all, does she?\u201d How can two people claim to not know each other when the truth is already so obvious?After saying so, she was amused to see that her son\u2019s face seemed somewhat gloomy.\u2018Hmph, instead of faking, why don\u2019t you just admit it!\u2019After seeing Weng Yinlin off, Chen Sinan stood by his door while thoughtfully looking at his neighbor\u2019s closed door. He was considering when to carry out his plan to move out of this apartment.To his surprise, however, before he could make his move, his neighbor already made plans to move out quickly.That weekend, while Chen Sinan had a break, he suddenly heard loud \u2018ping ping pang pang\u2019 noises next door along with loud voices. Although he couldn\u2019t hear the specifics of what was said, it was obvious that there were several people next door.Feeling very angry, Chen Sinan changed into his casual clothes and opened the door, his expression dark and cloudy.Xin Siyue, who wore black jeans, shirt and a red jacket, was shaking her head while directing a group of large men in work clothes to move her furniture. Upon seeing this, Chen Sinan couldn\u2019t help but furrow his brow.Xin Siyue heard a door behind her open, but just as she was about to turn around in curiosity, something caught her attention and she continued to direct her men, \u201cBe careful, careful. Go left, go left again, okay\u2026.\u201dChen Sinan, who was completely ignored, deepened his gaze. \u201cXin Siyue, what\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The man\u2019s entire body seemed to be emitting an aura, as if to say \u2018I\u2019m not in a good mood, so it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t provoke me.\u2019As a result, Xin Siyue\u2019s clear dark eyes swept at her surroundings before she said apologetically, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for waking you up. We will be done moving everything out in twenty minutes, so once we\u2019re finished, we will leave immediately.\u201dChen Sinan only felt an unhappy mood well up in his heart. Did he look stupid to her? How can he not see that she was moving? He only wanted to ask why it seemed as if she couldn\u2019t wait to move far away from him. Back when she liked him, she chased after him and stuck to his side like a sticky piece of gum that he couldn\u2019t wait to throw away. Now that she didn\u2019t want him anymore, she was trying to avoid him much more vehemently than he did to her.At this thought, Chen Sinan grunted at her with disdain and turned around.Xin Siyue was confused by his reaction. She stood on the spot, trying to figure what he meant by that grunt, but even after thinking about it for a few minutes, she still couldn\u2019t tell what it was that made him unhappy.She was obviously fulfilling his wish by moving far away! Since she\u2019s being so considerate towards him, why does he still have to act so enigmatic? Why is this guy so hard to understand?Xin Siyue already knew that even if she didn\u2019t move away, Chen Sinan would eventually move away on his own. In the end, it didn\u2019t make a difference whether it was him or her who moved out.Moreover, this wasn\u2019t a place that she had bought for herself. It would be better if she sold the place and used that money to buy a place she liked.When Xin Siyue had returned home the other day, she had told Xin Qiancheng that she wanted to sell her place. Xin Qiancheng naturally knew that she had originally stirred up trouble in order to buy that place and get closer to Chen Sinan. He had tried convincing her before, but Xin Siyue was persistent on buying that place. Back then, he wasn\u2019t in the mood to handle her affairs. Now that she wanted to sell it, Xin Qiancheng couldn\u2019t agree more with the idea.In less than a week, he was able to find her a buyer. Even the people from the moving company were prepared by him. Xin Siyue was idle since everything had already been taken care of by her brother. She had only come over to grab some things and help with the moving, but she never expected that Chen Sinan was such a difficult person to please.In the end, she didn\u2019t care about whether he was angry or happy. In high spirits, she happily finished all of her work, lifted her small backpack, and rolled her suitcase towards the train to head back home.Chen Sinan followed his normal routine of exercising in the gym for half an hour. He then took a shower and sat down in preparation to eat breakfast. As he sat down, he strained his ears to listen to the sounds outside, but it was completely quiet.He coolly took a sip of milk. In the end, he couldn\u2019t restrain himself and stood up, opening his door. As he glanced at the tightly shut entrance next door, his expression turned dark.After moving out, Xin Siyue was filled with excitement for a long time. Her spirits were incomparably high.Since it was now early May, she recalled that according to the plot following the competition scene, Chen Sinan would head back directly to his company and work. If they were to cross paths again, it would be during their graduation ceremony this early June.Haha, she would no longer encounter Chen Sinan at school, neither would she ever go where he lived. Xin Siyue was very certain that their paths would not cross in the future, so she relaxed mentally and single-mindedly focused on studying.However, the saying of \u201cThe brother has left the Jiang Hu, but the Jiang Hu still has stories of that brother!\u201d was on point.(T/N: Jiang Hu(\u6c5f\u6e56) literally means rivers and lakes, but usually represents the wandering community of martial artists and people of special skills. It\u2019s mentioned often in Chinese martial arts movies and other c-novels as well)Although Chen Sinan was no longer physically on campus, the impact of the \u201caftermath\u201d was still quite serious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, her roommate still pushed her to skim through several pages of the post. The first comment included a photo that the dorm leader secretly took, which showed Chen Sinan turning around and speaking to Xin Siyue.Xin Siyue thought that it must\u2019ve been the lighting that had created a false impression. If not, why else would she see a slight touch of tenderness in Chen Sinan\u2019s eyes? Of course, she was the only one who assumed that it was the lighting playing tricks on the photo. Thousands of others thought that the look in Chen Sinan\u2019s eyes were exceptionally tender as he glanced back at Xin Siyue.As a result, after the photo was posted, some mourned, some cried, and some directly scolded Xin Siyue as shameless! Then, the main event broke out; after seeing several comments that scolded Xin Siyue for being shameless, everyone started joining in, crying out the same thing. They also very considerately dug out her old history of chasing after the male god. In fact, they reviewed all of her old awkward and embarrassing moments. Compiled together, it should be called \u201cXin Siyue\u2019s Growth Record of Shamelessness\u201d!After hundreds of pages of scolding, someone finally changed up the tune: \u201cAh, this girl is actually quite praiseworthy and courageous! If there was someone who chased after me like this, I might reciprocate as well!\u201dHence, everyone\u2019s focus shifted again; they studied the secret of \u201chow to win over the aloof school prince\u201d!Xin Siyue wanted to prostrate before their brainlessness.It truly was impressive!Chen Sinan\u2019s fame, coupled with this popular forum, caused the name \u2018Xin Siyue\u2019 to become recognizable to more and more people.When Xin Siyue went to the school cafeteria to eat, people around her were no longer focused on their meals. Instead, they purely put their efforts into staring at her. As a result, she no longer visited the cafeteria as often.Of course, there were still some small troublesome matters, but Xin Siyue sincerely and earnestly warded them away.Xin Siyue stared at the group of girls blocking her way. \u201cClassmates, I\u2019m really not in a relationship with Chen Sinan.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d\u201cWho is Chen Sinan? He is the school prince of our college, the male god! Who do you think I am to be able to match up to him?\u201d Xin Siyue enthusiastically exaggerated Chen Sinan\u2019s status.\u201cOh, that\u2019s true!\u201d The person suddenly understood. \u201cSo you are speaking the truth?\u201d\u201cI swear to God!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 doesn\u2019t that post say\u2026\u201d\u201cThe post was just blindly stating things. Chen Sinan and I have no relationship with each other whatsoever!\u201dXin Siyue had bitterly tried to persuade them, and they had miraculously believed her. As they walked away, one of the girls even vowed \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will help you clear up this matter.\u201dEn, the kind students immediately replied to the post once she got home: \u201cJust now, I asked Xin Xin herself. She swore to God that she and Chen Sinan aren\u2019t in a relationship with each other. She doesn\u2019t even think about him, everything is clear and innocent. Everyone, you can rest assured and go wash up and sleep.\u201d After the post was sent, quite a few people inquired about the truth of the statement by posting comments underneath the claim.The kindhearted student earnestly replied to each of the posts.Mao Shiyuan excitedly looked at the posts and comments and had even taken a few screenshots of them. He showed the screenshots to Chen Sinan and asked, \u201cSinan, what did you do to make Miss Xin wholeheartedly deny the relationship between you two? What\u2019s more, it seems like she\u2019s trying to avoid you as one might with snakes and scorpions!\u201dWhen Chen Sinan finished looking through the forum and its information, he frowned and glanced at the picture. Chen Sinan smiled an ice-cold smile as he just thought of something, then replied Mao Shiyuan one word: \u201cOh.\u201dMao Shiyuan didn\u2019t think that Chen Sinan would respond, but he actually responded this time!He was excited as he replied, \u201cDamn, I think I smell adultery in the air!\u201dChen Sinan sneered, his slender fingers quickly typed a sentence on his phone before he sent, \u201cYou should ask her how she felt that night when she met my mother.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He immediately replied, \u201cWhat is this situation? You guys actually got together while hiding it from other people? Quickly tell me, how long has this been going on?\u201dShen Sinan indifferently replied, \u201cYou can ask her.\u201d Continuing on, he acted as though he remembered something else: \u201cI\u2019m very curious how the people in the forum will react when they hear that she had seen my mother.\u201dMao Shiyuan was stunned\u2026\u2026did he want to publicize their relationship?Crap! He wished he could get closer to Xin Siyue now. But the way he was going about things right now didn\u2019t seem to be his usual style. After all, the way he spoke made it seem like there was a conspiracy behind it all.Even though he didn\u2019t fully understand the situation, Mao Shiyuan still fulfilled what he thought was Xin Siyue\u2019s wish. Underneath the forum, he added oil to the fire by stating, \u201cAccording to the male party involved, the female party has already met his parents. The involved party had said, and I quote, \u2018you should ask her how she felt that night when she met my mother.\u2019\u201dThe forum was just calming down, but Mao Shiyuan\u2019s comment had sent them into a frenzy once again.\u201cWhat\u2019s with this situation?\u201d\u201cI know this I.D., it\u2019s senior Mao Shiyuan!\u201d\u201cYour mother! Isn\u2019t senior Mao Shiyuan living with senior Chen Sinan?\u201d\u201cThat scared me! This means that the source of the information is definitely reliable!\u201d\u201cShe actually had already seen his parents! It seems like we can\u2019t keep school hunk Chen anymore!\u201d\u201cWu, wu, wu.

My male god\u2026\u2026\u201dXin Siyue was at the library; she had just finished reading half of her book when she was beckoned back by an urgent message on her phone.She pushed open the door to her dorm and found that all the girls in her class were gathered there.Xin Siyue was surprised, \u201cAre you guys having a party?\u201d\u201cSiyue, stop acting dumb! We all know!\u201dXin Siyue was still unaware, so she asked, \u201cKnow what?\u201d\u201cWe know the matter between you and the school prince!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve already met the school prince\u2019s mother, isn\u2019t that right?\u201dXin Siyue thought about it, but still didn\u2019t understand the true meaning behind those words, and truthfully replied, \u201cYeah, I met her.\u201d\u201cOh my god! Siyue, you are amazing!\u201d After Xin Siyue finished speaking, they surrounded her and started their inquisition: \u201cWhat kind of method did you use to capture him? Quickly tell us!\u201d\u201cOh right, how far have you guys gone? Have you guys kissed or hugged?\u201d\u201cIs the school prince considerate? Did it feel good to kiss him?\u201dXin Siyue was still oblivious to the situation. In order to answer their quick succession of questions, she had to increase her voice by a few decibels. She was still baffled when she asked, \u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201dZhong Qin explained, \u201cSenior Mao said that you and the school hunk are in a relationship!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Xin Siyue was speechless until she saw what Mao Shiyuan had posted. Her expression became gloomy, \u201cIs this person ill? Why is he making up rumors?\u201dSun Miaomiao was the first to refute her, \u201cRumor? Are you saying that senior Mao isn\u2019t telling the truth?\u201dThis\u2026\u2026it was the truth.\u201cI saw his parents, but I had only greeted them by nodding my head. Does that even count as meeting his parents?\u201d said Xin Siyue unhappily. \u201cDoes that mean that of all the parents I\u2019ve met, if they have a son whose age is similar to mine, that would mean we\u2019re dating?\u201dAfter Xin Siyue had finished venting, she was still annoyed, \u201cI don\u2019t need to explain the situation to you guys. I don\u2019t have any relationship with Chen Sinan. I\u2019ll be hostile with anyone who dares mention Chen Sinan to my face in the future!\u201dDid Chen Sinan have illness? She had tried so hard to minimize her presence, hiding and avoiding him. But it seemed that he didn\u2019t like to see other people living well!No one had ever seen the polite and amiable Xin Siyue become angry. The girls glanced at each other, but no one spoke up besides Sun Miaomiao, who mockingly smiled at Xin Siyue.Xin Siyue had used the computer\u2019s ID to reply to the post:\u201cI am Xin Siyue. I\u2019m here to declare that Chen Sinan and I have no relationship with each other. If anyone tries to start making rumors about us again, I will really capture Chen Sinan for myself!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - Lashing OutPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28 Lashing OutXin Siyue was so angry with Chen Sinan for deliberately causing trouble, that she couldn\u2019t help but think over and over of the harsh punishments he would suffer hundreds of times in her mind.She went through a lot of trouble pretending to act tough to calm down the women\u2019s gossiping, but who knew that once men started to gossip, it was even worse?Ji Yi was an honest-to-goodness freak; he had already been bothering her for the past few days about it.When Xin Siyue walked out of the library, she couldn\u2019t help but sigh upon noticing Ji Yi approach from behind her. She looked back at him expressionlessly.\u201cWhy are you still following me? I don\u2019t need to attend any other competitions.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t I talk to you now that you\u2019re not going to competitions?\u201dXin Siyue chuckled and answered impolitely, \u201cHmm\u2026 you really can\u2019t.\u201dJi Yi was flustered at her ruthless remarks.Seeing that his face was fairly ugly, she stared at him and smiled smugly while continuing to speak, \u201cI don\u2019t want any relationship with your department or the student union. You should be conscientious enough not to put me in a tight spot. I just might lash out unkind words if I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201dXin Siyue\u2019s threat prompted Ji Yi to ask, \u201cJust like when you lashed out on the forum about winning Chen Sinan for yourself? Well, I hope you would do the same for me.\u201dXin Siyue was shocked. She posted rumors about winning Chen Sinan over, but it was only to make the girls stop. Under no circumstances would they would wish for the one they admired or liked to have his own angel. Even if these girls didn\u2019t date the school prince, simply knowing that the male god was single was enough to bring them joy.She knew that they didn\u2019t want her and Chen Sinan to be together since they heard of how shameless she was. With Chen Sinan\u2019s strange attitude, she might have really ended up winning him over if she maintained this shamelessness.Xin Siyue knew that they wouldn\u2019t risk it.Therefore, the truth proved that no one would \u2018YY\u2019 her and Chen Sinan anymore. She was satisfied.But Ji Yi really misunderstood.Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t help but sigh, responding, \u201cIf you had half of Chen Sinan\u2019s looks and power, maybe I could accept you\u2026 reluctantly.\u201dJi Yi was speechless.Seeing that he stopped talking, Xin Siyue was very pleased. Good! She could slip off!Who would have thought that Ji Yi\u30fcin his freakish behaviour\u30fcwould grab her wrist?\u201cYou\u2019re rejecting me because Chen Sinan and I are in the same department? Or is it because he was the former president of the student union and I\u2019m the current one? Is that why you don\u2019t want relations with anyone that had to do with him?\u201dXin Siyue couldn\u2019t help but knit her eyebrows annoyedly when she saw him grab hold of her slender wrist.Before she crossed over, she had always been single. At most, she had feelings towards one or two guys at school and chatted with them. But she never got together with them, they didn\u2019t even hold hands. But now, Ji Yi the freak was having his way with her wrist.Xin Siyue calmly looked at her wrist and raised her chin, \u201cLet go.\u201dXin Siyue looked at him and said gloomily, \u201cYou guessed right! I\u2019m not willing to have any relationship with anyone or anything related to Chen Sinan. Even if he left the school, I wouldn\u2019t be willing to mention the architecture department or even the student unions. All you did was borrow the light Chen Sinan left behind.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not being fair to me,\u201d Ji Yi replied.\u201cWe\u2019re not related in any way, and I\u2019m not planning to be friends with you. Why should I be fair?\u201dXin Siyue couldn\u2019t help but add, \u201cJi Yi, your department is on the east side while mine is on the west. Stop letting me see you so often, okay?\u201d What she really meant was that she didn\u2019t want to see him at all!Ji Yi\u2019s expression darkened.Xin Siyue didn\u2019t care much about it. There weren\u2019t many people in her department who were similar to Chen Sinan. The only problem left was Ji Yi; she couldn\u2019t help but feel like she didn\u2019t know what he wanted. Instead of staying by her side and wasting brain cells, why not bug off earlier on? That way, she could peacefully do what she wanted to.Xin Siyue felt extremely accomplished after leaving Ji Yi, to the point where she even hummed a song while going out to look for food. What she wasn\u2019t aware of was that besides Ji Yi in the architecture department, Mao Shiyuan was also looking for her.He asked many people before finding out that Xin Siyue was in the library. Upon arriving he saw Xin Siyue and Ji Yi having a conversation.When he heard Ji Yi questioning Xin Siyue\u30fcasking if she wasn\u2019t willing to have any relations with people related to Chen Sinan\u30fche eagerly took out his phone and recorded them. He even laughed at Chen Sinan\u2019s misfortune when Xin Siyue admitted to it.\u201cHaha! I wonder if A\u2019nan will turn green with anger after seeing this video!\u201dOriginally, he thought that Xin Siyue became smarter and learnt that there was no sweetness behind forced words. Today, he learned that was not the case; rather, she was ruthless and heartless!Mao Shiyuan thought that Xin Siyue was much more interesting than before. Because of this, he wanted to get closer to her and find out even more about her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The person in front of her was the one who sat by Chen Sinan\u2019s side whenever she went to eat with Sun Miaomiao.If he ate with Chen Sinan, then she wouldn\u2019t interact with him.Mao Shiyuan quietly acknowledged Xin Siyue\u2019s lack of enthusiasm. He smiled and asked, \u201cDo you really not remember me?\u201dWith closer observation, he figured Xin Siyue was probably only pretending not to remember!But Xin Siyue really didn\u2019t know him.\u201cYou are?\u201dMao Shiyuan exclaimed confusedly, \u201cAh?\u201d He was shocked, was she going to continue to act?\u201cWe don\u2019t really know each other, so there\u2019s no need to sit together. There are plenty of seats over there,\u201d Xin Siyue responded sincerely while she pointed to her right, unaware of the abundance of thoughts flowing through Mao Shiyuan\u2019s mind.Mao Shiyuan froze while pouring water for himself, and roared, \u201cI\u2019m Mao Shiyuan!\u201dHis loud voice practically demanded attention.Mao Shiyuan was about to explode from anger!He calmed down and continued, \u201cDid you really forget?\u201d\u201cHeh,\u201d replied Xin Siyue, not knowing what to say. But she knew it was the male lead\u2019s best friend, Mao Shiyuan!Mao Shiyuan. She knew the name\u30fche was pretty close to the male lead. After the male lead opened his own company, Mao Shiyuan was the one in charge of management. Plus, before she crossed over, Mao Shiyuan was considered a matchmaker between the second female lead and the male lead.Even if Xin Siyue wasn\u2019t unfamiliar with him, it\u2019s not like she could pretend to know him very well either!Somewhat apologetically, she replied, \u201cSorry, I really have no memory of you.\u201d\u2018Pretend! Keep pretending!\u2019 Mao Shiyuan thought in his heart.\u201cDid you really lose your memory?\u201dXin Siyue hurriedly nodded her head and confirmed, \u201cYeah, really.\u201dMao Shiyuan couldn\u2019t accept her response.\u201cI don\u2019t believe this. If you really lost your memory then how come you act differently when you\u2019re around Chen Sinan?\u201dXin Siyue rolled her eyes.\u2018Dear, through which one of those eyes did you see me and Chen Sinan getting along in a friendly manner with each other?\u2019 she thought to herself.Seeing that she didn\u2019t respond, Mao Shiyuan didn\u2019t have to either. The message behind the expression on his face was clear. \u2018Now that you\u2019ve shown me what you really are, how are you going to clean this mess up now?\u2019Xin Siyue knitted her eyebrows.Mao Shiyuan struck while the iron was hot, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Have you run out of excuses?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need an excuse, but you can try. Chen Sinan is a name that you hear every day. How could you not remember his name? Many people seemed scared that I might forget all the embarrassment I\u2019d caused before\u30fcand even helped me look back at each event one by one. Tell me. If I really lost my memory, do you think I\u2019m so stupid that I wouldn\u2019t be able to find out exactly what happened?\u201d Xi Siyuan replied.Seeing him still dazed, she concluded, \u201cYou know, if you were as influential and powerful as Chen Sinan, I\u2019d know your name too.\u201dMao Shiyuan, was partly deceived, but he didn\u2019t fully take in what she just said. He just thought that the way she talked sounded familiar.Xin Siyue looked at his frozen expression, one which seemed to be unsure of the validity of her claim. She interrupted him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dMao Shiyuan forgot about why he wanted to look for her in the first place. Instead, he began laughing and took out his phone. He moved closer and said smugly, in a quiet voice, \u201cWatch this.\u201dXin Siyue was confused. Did he come all the way here just to show her a video? Was Mao Shiyuan really that casual?She looked surprised, but Mao Shiyuan already placed the phone in her view on the table in front of them.\u201cLook.\u201dFirst, she saw the green tree near the library. Just as she thought it was familiar, she suddenly saw herself in the video with Ji Yi. She was shocked to hear her voice, easily recognizable despite the distance.\u201cYou guessed right! I\u2019m not willing to have any relationship with anyone or anything related to Chen Sinan. Even if he left the school, I wouldn\u2019t be willing to mention the architecture department or even the student unions. All you did was borrow the light Chen Sinan left behind.\u201dWhile Xin Siyue exclaimed this, she didn\u2019t know that she had spoken with such passion\u30fcor rather, such a decisive tone.Hearing it made her dazed. When she finally reacted, she hurriedly tried to grab the phone on in order to destroy the video.What was Mao Shiyuan thinking when he recorded this video? Xin Siyue felt an unbelievable awkwardness, seeing herself on video in someone else\u2019s phone\u30fcespecially without her permission. She was angry but even angrier that Mao Shiyuan was quicker than her.Sh*t!Xin Siyue wanted to curse. Badly.Mao Shiyuan was satisfied seeing her reaction, and teased, \u201cDon\u2019t think about deleting it. I already sent it to A\u2019nan, anyways, so there\u2019s no use deleting it!\u201d\u201c\u2026Mao Shiyuan, you\u2019ve got a serious problem!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, I do know that you\u2019re just enjoying this show and treating me as amusement for yourself.\u201dMao Shiyuan laughed, \u201cIndeed, I like to watch the show, especially when it involves both Chen Sinan and you. Not only did you successfully attract Chen Sinan\u2019s attention with your words, what was most important was that he would know your truthful thoughts.

You should know that nothing will happen between Sinan and I.

Although Chen Sinan was unreasonable from childhood, the old man was even more unreasonable and harsh, using feather dusters and sticks to beat him up.Gradually, he would only yield to the old man.Whenever the old man said something, Chen Sinan could only half-heartedly respond and eat with the so-called Lai Family and their daughter who had just returned to the country.Of course, he had a cold expression on the whole time. Besides greeting the adults of the Lai Family when he came in, he never looked at them.The daughter of the Lai Family bit her lip and looked like she was extremely wronged when he didn\u2019t say anything to her after she glanced up at him for a few hundred times.Weng Yinlin was on the sidelines, trying to mediate between their relationship. She had scolded him as being \u2018unfilial\u2019 at least ten times.After Chen Sinan ate a bit, he elegantly picked up the paper napkin and wiped the corner of his mouth. He got up and said, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m going to the bathroom.\u201d Without waiting for the other party to reply, he immediately left.Finally, Lai Family\u2019s parents\u2019 faces looked ugly.Weng Yinlin smiled and apologized, \u201cSinan is a bit proud. It will be better once you get to know him.\u201d Heh. However, she was thinking the opposite of what she had said.The Lai Family\u2019s parents could only smile apologetically. In reality, claiming connections with Chen Family was something that the people in the city could only dream about!After Chen Sinan got out of the private room and turned a few corners, he stopped by a narrow end of the stairs and looked out the window where the bright lights outside. Chen Sinan pulled out a cigarette box from his pocket and starting to smoke.He had smoked a few times before but he wasn\u2019t really addicted. However, there was a lot going on in the company and it was difficult to sleep after handling everything since it was in the middle of the night. It was very lonely and boring this late, so he had slowly began to smoke in order to pass time. Of course, he only casually smoked.Chen Sinan smoked a bit before gradually spitting out smoke rings. He squinted his eyes and looked through the smoke, unclear as to what he was looking at.He stood for a while, took out his phone, and casually scrolled through it to see the video Mao Shiyuan sent.Mao Shiyuan wouldn\u2019t dare to send him a boring video so he opened it to check it out.In this quiet space, even the woman\u2019s voice became especially clear.Chen Sinan slightly squinted his eyes and the red light in his right hand\u2019s fingertips slightly flashed. He watched her serious expression and her determined words.After Chen Sinan saw this, he had actually played it again. Then, he deleted it and sent Mao Shiyuan a text: Come out and drink with me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He attentively watched her serious expression as she as she resolutely said those words.When he finished watching it once, he had actually replayed it again. After he finished watching it the second time, he deleted the video and texted a message to Mao Shiyuan: Come and drink with me.After sending the text message, he put out the cigarette. Without turning back, Chen Sinan walked straight towards the entrance of the dinning hall.However, he never anticipated that he would accidentally meet Xin Qiancheng on the first floor lounge.Xin Qiangcheng was dressed in formal attire with an assistant following behind him. In addition to the assistant were three big bellied middle age man. From their appearance, it seemed that they had just finished attending a dinner party and were preparing to leave.When Xin Qiancheng spotted Chen Sinan from afar, the expression on his face turned cold. Ever since his little sister stopped pestering Chen Sinan, Xin Qiangcheng felt that he could finally lift his face again.When Chen Sinan saw that Xin Qiancheng was looking at him with hostility, he stopped walking and looked up at this man with interest.Xin Qiancheng instructed his assistant, \u201cHelp me send off the bosses.\u201dThe bosses naturally got the hint that Xin Qiangcheng wanted to discuss something with Chen Sinan. So, they complimented, \u201cSince President Xin has something to do, we will leave first. We will talk about the specific details regarding the arrangements for our collaboration tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Xin Qiancheng nodded his head. Soon after they left him, he saw that they had respectfully stopped walking and chatted a little with Chen Sinan when they walked passed him.Chen Sinan impatiently and perfuncterly nodded his head at them and responded a few words.Xin Qiancheng waited for everyone to leave before he said, \u201cI\u2019m less than impressed by President Chen\u2019s attitude.\u201d\u201cPresident Xin is not to be outdone either.\u201dXin Qiancheng naturally knew whether Chen Sinan was either joking or telling the truth.For the Xin Family to develop to what it is today was thanks to the hard work of the many generations. In Shengjin city, their company can be considered to be rich, outstanding, and elite. However, Xin Qiansheng knew the situation of the company better than anyone else. When their company was compared to the influential Chen corporation, there was a huge distance between them.Xin Qiancheng had vision and ambition, so he had always considered Chen Sinan as rival. But deep down, he knew that Chen Sinan had never taken him seriously. Because of that, every time he saw Chen Sinan, he would lose his reasoning and exchange a hostile few words with him. If he doesn\u2019t do so, Xin Qiancheng would feel restless.\u201cIs President Chen here for work too?\u201dChen Sinan wasn\u2019t interested in answering his question. He just smiled and said, \u201cMy mother said that the Xin Family is good and that the young lady from the Xin Family is very likable too.\u201dHis words were light as a feather without any sincere feelings behind it. This caused Xin Qiancheng\u2019s expression to immediately darken.Chen Sinan smiled with satisfaction as he nodded his head. He gestured that he was going to leave, then he turned around and confidently left.Before Chen Sinan had seen Xin Qiancheng in person, he had heard a little about him from other people. This man was only older than him by four to five years and was also considered one of the young and promising successors of a powerful business in Shenjing city.After meeting him two to three times, Chen Sinan found out what Xin Qiancheng\u2019s fatal weak point was; this man wasn\u2019t willing to have his little sister to have any relationship with him at all.Because of Xin Siyue\u2019s recent change of behavior, it gave Xin Qiancheng the confidence to face him again.However, Chen Sinan can easily break his confidence with just a simple sentence.Chen Sinan suddenly found out that Xin Siyue was pretty useful.Author\u2019s Comment:Chen Sinan\u2019s mother: I have never said those words before ~Chen Sinan: He turned his face away because he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.

He was stunned by the man\u2019s action and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dChen Sinan glanced at him.Mao Shiyuan felt like he got goosebumps all over his body. He immediately stood up, waved his hand, and said, \u201cIf you have something you want to say, just say it. Male god, please don\u2019t look at me like that!\u201dThere\u2019s no point in using the male beauty trap here. If it was a female that was sitting here, Mao Shiyuan knew that the female would\u2019ve thrown herself at Chen Sinan in less than three seconds.Chen Sinan slowly sat down and he poured himself a glass of wine in the empty wine glass. He took a sip of the wine and suddenly said, \u201cPhone.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Mao Shiyuan was confused by his sudden response.Chen Sinan repeated himself and said, \u201cYour cellphone.\u201dMao Shiyuan didn\u2019t think much of his request as he took out his cellphone and handed it to him. He asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring your phone?\u201dChen Sinan didn\u2019t reply, he simply gestured for Mao Shiyuan to unlock his phone.Mao Shiyuan obediently followed his order and unlocked his phone. Feeling surprised when he saw Chen Sinan grab it from his hands, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cYou really didn\u2019t bring your phone with you?\u201dAfter Chen Sinan quickly pressed a few buttons on his phone, he returned it to Mao Shiyuan. Only after giving back the phone did Chen Sinan replied, \u201cI did.\u201dMao Shiyuan accepted it back, but he was still a little puzzled after hearing his friend\u2019s reply. He asked, \u201cSince you\u2019ve brought your phone, why did you need mine?\u201dChen Sinan meaningfully glanced at him.Mao Shiyuan stared blankly at him at him but then, it seemed as if he finally recalled something as he hurriedly unlocked his phone. He searched his phone for the recording he had of Xin Siyue and Ji Yi and found that it was gone.Mao Shiyuan exploded, \u201cChen Sinan, are you retaliating against me?\u201dChen Sinan rejected this idea as he replied, \u201cHow does deleting a video count as retaliating against you?\u201dMao Shiyuan felt that this man was very difficult to understand, \u201cI\u2019m trying to help you out of kindness! What are you trying to do by deleting it?\u201d\u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to delete it, what are you keeping it for? Are you keeping it as a souvenir?\u201dMao Shiyuan choked on his words and was unable to respond.After some time passed, he finally reacted and said, \u201cA-Nan, could it be that Xin Siyue asked you to delete the video? No wonder I feel like there is something fishy going on when you invited me out to drink tonight. It seems that you had dug a pit and waited for me to jump in!\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Chen Sinan slightly looked at Mao Shiyuan from the corners of his eyes.Mao Shiyuan said, \u201cToday, I had a meal with her. She was determined to steal my phone and delete the video. But of course, she wasn\u2019t able to!\u201dHowever, in the end, he had never expected that Chen Sinan would be the one who deleted it.Chen Sinan thoughtfully looked at the sparkling and translucent liquid inside the wine glass.Mao Shiyuan paid extra attention to the expression on Chen Sinan\u2019s face. He had an intuition.\u201cA-Nan, could it be that you\u2019re interested in Xin Siyue?\u201dChen Sinan glanced at him with a smile yet not a smile.Mao Shiyuan deciphered his expression as\u2014\u2014no.He waved his hand, \u201cI also believe that it is impossible! In the past, Xin Siyue had tried so hard to chase after you, but you weren\u2019t interested at all. Now, she can\u2019t wait to get as far away from you as possible, so you should have even less of an interest in her.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After Mao Shiyuan finished speaking, Chen Sinan said, \u201cRecently, I\u2019ve been taking care of matters in my new company. You should join me.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Mao Shiyuan was so startled by his news that he had almost choked on his wine, \u201cSince when did you start a new company?\u201d\u201cI began the preparations for the new company two months ago.\u201d Chen Sinan continued, \u201cI can\u2019t pull myself away from the Chen company, so you can help me take care of some matters regarding my new company.\u201dMao Shiyuan glanced up at him. It didn\u2019t seem like Chen Sinan was playing a joke, so he slapped the table with his hand and replied, \u201cOkay!\u201dChen Sinan nodded his head.After having two more sips of wine, Mao Shiyuan can\u2019t help but ask, \u201cI heard that Xin Siyue moved out of the apartment complex you are currently living at?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Chen Sinan slightly narrowed his eyes.Mao Shiyuan continued, \u201cI heard this from her today.\u201dChen Sinan squinted at him and said, \u201cYou seem quite familiar with her.\u201dMao Shiyuan dryly laughed, \u201cI\u2019m only trying to help you change her mind. But who would\u2019ve thought, she had cut off all her escape routes?\u201dChen Sinan glanced at him, he knew that Mao Shiyuan was purely enjoying the show and didn\u2019t feel like this was a big matter.Mao Shiyuan didn\u2019t pay any attention to Chen Sinan\u2019s expression. While continuing to butt into others\u2019 business, he said, \u201cShe\u2019s very strange. In order to avoid you, she had even used Sheng Wenyang who was abroad as a reason to give up.\u201dChen Sinan\u2019s expression slightly changed as he continued to listen to Mao Shiyuan gossip, \u201cWhat did you do to make her so discouraged to this point? She wasn\u2019t willing to turn back no matter what. It seems like she views you as someone extremely dangerous.\u201dChen Sinan took a deep breath. He was somewhat agitated as he said, \u201cDon\u2019t mention her to me anymore.\u201dMao Shiyuan detected that something was off, so he obediently shut up.In fact, Mao Shiyuan had misunderstood Chen Sinan when he had said, \u2018don\u2019t mention her to me anymore\u2019. The \u2018her\u2019 he mentioned wasn\u2019t Xin Siyue but Sheng Wenyang.What outsiders didn\u2019t know was that while the way Chen Sinan treated Sheng Wenyang was different, it was only because of her distinctive charm. His feelings for her wasn\u2019t to the point where he loved her to death and back.In the beginning, Sheng Wenyang was like a bright and dazzling sun that broke into his world. She was beautiful and capable, mature and steady, and strong. Step by step, she had purposely approached him, confessed, and had followed through the standard routine to get closer to him. Even though Chen Sinan had seen every stage put into action, he didn\u2019t feel disgusted by her. Instead, he had just let her do what she wanted.Perhaps Sheng Wenyang believed that she was infallible. She believed that his occasional response to her advances was due to his growing affections, so she ran to him and cried about how her ordinary family could not match up to the strong and impressive the Chen Family was. Sheng Wenyang said that she wanted to go abroad to train herself to be more outstanding so that she could proudly stand side-by-side with him.Chen Sinan looked at her and did not say a single word.While Sheng Wenyang played a weeping beauty, she did not forget to pull down on his neckline and tiptoe, kissing Chen Sinan on the cheek. She then buried her head in his arms and continued to sob, \u201cChen Sinan, I love you!\u201dSheng Wenyang\u2019s display of love did not elicit a response. However, there was no better answer than his allowance of her to stay within his arms and kiss him.Chen Sinan had allowed all of her affectionate actions. This was enough to make Sheng Wenyang intensely proud of herself and confident.He had mysophobia, and always disliked being touched by others. However, Sheng Wenyang was an exception to the case.This point was known by many people.That was why rumors of Chen Sinan and Sheng Wenyang being in love with each gradually emerged. Those who saw the two together were even more convinced of the matter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She had waited there for him for 10 minutes already. He rubbed his faintly throbbing temples and put up a smile, \u201cMom, how come you\u2019re here?\u201dWeng Yinlin was angered by him to the point that she already had one foot in her coffin. In a bad mood, she replied: \u201cIf I didn\u2019t come here, then I wouldn\u2019t be able to see my son again for most of the month!Chen Sinan lazily turned his head and looked away. He didn\u2019t know what these elders were doing\u2013 were they bothered about how there was nothing to do, so they just started randomly worried about him?Weng Yinlin saw that he didn\u2019t speak and that he even held a contemplative expression on his face. She followed his line of sight and saw that his gaze was fixed on the neighbor\u2019s door. After staring at it for a few seconds, she suddenly understood and stated, \u201cIt turns out the reason you kept refusing our matchmaking was because you liked the girl living next door!\u201dChen Sinan didn\u2019t even think and immediately replied: \u201cShe moved away!\u201dWhat he wanted to express was that she no longer lived here and that they no longer had any relations with each other.Also, to prevent her from falling again one day and becoming abnormal, he had already bought the apartment from the owner at a high price, so that she can no longer move back.However, in Weng Yinlin\u2019s ears, it came across differently. The thoughts that arose in her heart were: \u2018Ah, his tone was filled with hidden bitterness. It sounded just like he was abandoned!\u2019Then she thought about it some more. That day, the girl\u2019s attitude did not reveal any interest. It must be that she had no thoughts for him, otherwise, she would not have moved away so suddenly!Weng Yinlin became elated when she realized that there was someone who actually didn\u2019t like her son. It should be known that Chen Sinan had been receiving love letters since preschool. Whenever he spoke about girls, he always had this proud and overbearing aura around him, making her very angry!Rarely were there people that can cause him to be humiliated!Weng Yinlin immediately smiled and inquired, \u201cWhat is the name of that girl? Where does she come from?\u201dChen Sinan looked at his mother strangely, \u201cMom, what do you want to do?\u201dWeng Yinlin replied: \u201cIf you like someone, you should just say it outright. Just look at your qualifications, are you still afraid that the girl won\u2019t be moved?\u201dChen Sinan quickly realized what his mother had misunderstood.\u201cMom, there isn\u2019t anything between me and that girl.\u201d\u201cMom knows, but you\u2019re a male after all. Being a little more proactive won\u2019t hurt. Maybe if you are a little more proactive, the girl will be moved! You should listen and do as I say. Don\u2019t always go around with that stiff expression on your face. Smile more, girls prefer men who are gentler and more considerate\u2026\u201dChen Sinan shook his head helplessly. He was too lazy to even explain and allowed her to continue and misunderstand. Anyways, it\u2019s better than having her always shove females toward him.Since Weng Yinlin thought that his heart was already set on that girl, she didn\u2019t bother him for a good half month. Mao Shiyuan also truly kept Chen Sinan\u2019s words, \u201cdon\u2019t bring her up again\u201d in his heart. Even after several meetings, he only brought up matters regarding the new company, no longer mentioning Xin Siyue\u2019s name.Chen Sinan continued to busy himself with work every day. However, he inexplicably felt that something was missing in his life. After he thought carefully about it, he felt that this kind of normal lifestyle was correct; there wasn\u2019t anything wrong, so he no longer thought about it deeply.It wasn\u2019t until he was on a business trip and attending a birthday celebration that he realized what was missing. When he saw Xin Siyue in a white off-the-shoulder dress at the same venue as him, Chen Sinan finally discovered what his monotonous life was missing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Enjoy the read! and check out Kitty Jiu\u2019s Patreon for more raffles and eventsOriginally, Xin Siyue wasn\u2019t planning on showing her face to the birthday banquet, since she didn\u2019t know anyone attending.Xin Siyue grabbed Xin Qiancheng\u2019s arm and held onto her dress, making small, careful steps on her seven-centimeter high-heels. Perhaps because it was the first time, she had paid attention to her attire, but she still felt extremely uncomfortable.Xin Siyue lowered her head to focus on her footsteps, but didn\u2019t forget to complain to Xin Qiancheng, \u201cI already said that I didn\u2019t want to come. You forced me to attend! Plus, I already made an appointment tonight to continue to learn how to dance with the teacher.\u201dEver since Xin Siyue forfeited the competition, she understood: If she wanted to mingle, she needed a special ability she could demonstrate. The host normally wanted someone who had a lot of talent and abilities. They should be able to recite, dance, sing, or play an instrument\u2026 As long as you have an extra ability, others will think more highly of you.When the time came, Xin Siyue did not want to do something last minute, so she immediately found a dance teacher and a piano teacher. Every night, she alternated what she learned.In Xin Siyue\u2019s view, spending time on self-improvement was a much better choice in comparison to attending a banquet filled with people that she did not know.However, Xin Qiangcheng didn\u2019t think so. Although he later asked what happened with her and Chen Sinan\u2019s mother, she had only carelessly replied that on the day she returned to the apartment, they had accidentally encountered one another. They hadn\u2019t spoken much before she had realized the strange situation and smartly left.After she had finished speaking, Xin Qiancheng was silent for a moment. On the surface, the encounter sounded perfectly normal; yet, listening to Xin Siyue\u2019s tone, it seemed like it wasn\u2019t that simple.Xin Qiancheng, in order to remove the possibility of future trouble, thought that it was still better to let Xin Siyue come out and interact with people, thereby getting to know better-quality men. That way, she can more easily break off her foolish thoughts about Chen Sinan.Xin Siyue did not know that Xin Qiancheng still entertained such thoughts, she really would\u2019ve wanted to stab his head and say: \u201cDo I look like that kind of leisurely person?!\u201dXin Qiancheng was very diligent in his duties, taking Xin Siyue to congratulate the 70-year-old birthday host. He brought her away from the crowd and introduced her to each person\u30fcmaking a point of giving Xin Siyue space whenever he introduced her to handsome young men, whom he had selected very carefully, of course.No matter how stupid Xin Siyue was, she understood that this was basically a blind date banquet that Xin Qiancheng had arranged.\u201cShoot!\u201dThe young man with Xin Siyue at the moment, who just would not stop rambling about his career history, couldn\u2019t help but ask after suddenly hearing her say something under her breath, \u201cMiss Xin, what did you just say?\u201dXin Siyue forced a rigid smile on her face.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m a bit tired and would like to rest over there.\u201d\u201cThen let me accompany you.\u201d\u201cThank you, but there\u2019s no need,\u201d Xin Siyue smiled as she politely rejected him.When Chen Sinan arrived in the front hall, he was witness to this scene.Xin Siyue wore a revealing long dress, which opened just below her shoulders and teased the passersby to imagine the rest of her delicate frame. She was smiling\u30fctalking to a man who was barely a step away from her. Chen Sinan couldn\u2019t hear the man\u2019s response, but Xin Siyue smiled even brighter, waving her hands at him. She carried her dress and walked over to the corner, where the resting area was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her hair had been done by a hairstylist under Xin Qiancheng\u2019s command for about two hours\u30fcher long hair softly pulled up, leaving a few soft strands to lay on her shoulder.Chen Sinan\u2019s gaze stopped at her snow-white skin for a moment before he was greeted by the view of her slender back. The sight made him impatient.What was she planning to do, dressing like this?Gloom settled on his face as he received red wine delivered to him by a waiter. He pursed his lips, feeling the constant irritation that the surrounding environment was causing him.He raised his head to scan the banquet\u2019s front hall but was surrounded by people who wanted to win his favor before his gaze even landed on the resting area. As he finally made his way out, he was nagged by the owner of the banquet and stopped to speak for a bit.Of course, the conversation was always one-way. Enthusiastic conversation would be met with Chen Sinan\u2019s curt responses and occasional glances.Chen Sinan took the chance to move elsewhere when changing wine glass. He passed through the crowd and finally saw her.Xin Siyue had her head down, fixing her dress, but she wanted to take the time to look at her miserable feet.What Xin Siyue really wanted to do was to take her shoes off and walk comfortably on the floor.Considering her image, she suppressed her urges, but this didn\u2019t hinder her from scolding Xin Qiancheng. Why did he choose such a long evening dress? It was all because of him that she wore such high heels. Anything but high heels! It was all Xin Qiancheng\u2019s fault that she was so miserable!She felt indignant. What if she sent a message to Xin Qiancheng, telling him that she wasn\u2019t feeling well? After all, she had accompanied him and even helped him talk with so many men. Wasn\u2019t she loyal enough already?Xin Siyue thought it was an okay plan, so she lowered her head again to flip through her bag for her phone.It took a while, but she noticed, quite tragically, that her stylists had found her a matching handbag. She never placed her phone in it.Was she stupid? Did she actually forget to bring her phone?!Xin Siyue felt so unprepared; she may as well have forgotten to look at the calendar before going out. Everything about that day was warning her that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to go out.She anxiously looked at the attendees passing by, attempting to find Xin Qiancheng, but her earnest gaze never fell upon him. Instead, she attracted the attention of Chen Sinan.When Xin Siyue noticed a dark silhouette hovering over her, she looked over without a thought to suddenly find herself captivated by his handsome face. She almost threw her bag in surprise!Shoot! Why is Chen Sinan here too? Why would he attend a boring banquet like this? But more importantly\u2026 why is he standing here?Xin Siyue quickly snapped out of her trance as quickly as it came. She immediately dismissed the look on her face, and expressionlessly asked, \u201cWhy are you standing here?\u201d\u2018Quickly! Leave! Get out of there!\u2019She could feel herself pierced by the gazes of the young women around her. She didn\u2019t want to stand out.Chen Sinan was about 180 centimeters. While Xin Siyue sat, he only needed to lower his head slightly to see her exquisite makeup as he stood. Her cheeks were flush with a warm blush, and her fair complexion was delicate even without the makeup.

He couldn\u2019t see those eyes anymore, as all he saw in Xin Siyue\u2019s eyes was unhappiness.Chen Sinan looked at her eye lines and commented, \u201cYou didn\u2019t do your eyes very well.\u201dXin Siyue didn\u2019t know if he was talking about her eyes or saying that her makeup didn\u2019t look good. She retorted, \u201cI don\u2019t care if it looks good. I wasn\u2019t planning on letting you see it anyways.\u201dHmph! It\u2019s good enough! Did he come here just to criticize my looks?When Xin Qiancheng first saw her, he complimented her, saying she was beautiful. But this man was quite picky\u30fcshe could feel it in his gaze.After Xin Siyue comforted herself, she didn\u2019t mind anymore. After all, it didn\u2019t matter whether or not Chen Sinan thought she was beautiful. As long as he thought Sheng Wenyang was pretty, then it was fine.Chen Sinan\u2019s gaze naturally lowered, descending from her face to her snow-white shoulders and her beautiful collarbone. Even lower, he could see a faint hint of cleavage.The sight was stunning, and even Chen Sinan found himself under its effects before he reluctantly averted his eyes.Xin Siyue retorted as he awkwardly shifted his gaze. She thought that he finally realized that he said the wrong thing, wanting to continue to scold him when he coldly said, \u201cStand up.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dXin Siyue didn\u2019t understand. Chen Sinan shifted his gaze once again to look at her\u30fcto looking at her chest intently. Xin Siyue\u2019s reaction was slow. When she lowered her head to meet the subject of his gaze, it finally hit her, and she stood up.\u201cYou pervert!\u201d she angrily exclaimed.Chen Sinan curled his lips, \u201cYou\u2019re the one not paying attention. Why are you blaming me?\u201d\u201cOnly you would look there.\u201d\u201cIf you didn\u2019t wear that, who would look at it?\u201d\u201cChen Sinan, you\u2019re twisting my words.\u201d\u201cYou\u30fc\u201d\u201cDo you guys know each other?\u201d a pleasant female voice interjected as the two were arguing.Xin Siyue was too tired to pay any attention to Chen Sinan. She turned in the direction of the voice to see a beautiful woman with wavy hair. The woman wore a dainty short skirt and was looking eagerly at Chen Sinan.Xin Siyue had met her earlier. She seemed to be the granddaughter of the host. She seemed to be older than her by only a few years; she was beautiful, gentle, and had a pleasant voice.Xin Siyue took a few more glances at her before smiling at Chen Sinan. Her eyes seemed to be saying, \u201cLook! Look! Your peach blossom is here.\u201dChen Sinan understood the look of pleasure she adopted whenever she saw another\u2019s misfortune. He didn\u2019t even turn to look at the unexpected guest. He suddenly smiled charmingly, and before she could react, he reached over to take Xin Siyue in his arms.When Xin Siyue felt his warm palm on her waist, she was shocked!As this happened, she tripped and threw herself on his chest.Xin Siyue was confused.Crap! Chen Sinan, what\u2019s wrong with you! I stepped on my dress because of you!She buried her head in his embrace, and Chen Sinan used the opportunity to place his other hand on her head\u30fcpreventing her from escaping. He smiled and coaxed, \u201cBe good, now. When we get home, I can sleep in the study if you want to punish me.\u201d\u201cHu, hu, hu\u2026\u201dYou bastard! You\u2019ve got a problem!Xin Siyue desperately wanted to scream her thoughts.While the other woman was stunned by the scene, Chen Sinan brought Xin Siyue out as she found herself half-carried and half-embraced by him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - ShieldPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39 ShieldXin Siyue could finally breathe, but she was angry. She was also feeling unwell so she didn\u2019t have it in her to scold Chen Sinan. The moment he let her go, she immediately waved her hand over in an exaggerated motion, clearly feeling flustered.In response, Chen Sinan grabbed onto her flailing wrist. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked as his face clouded with gloom.After suffering this man\u2019s torment, Xin Siyue\u2019s hair was messy and ruined. Even without looking in a mirror, she knew that she had lost her elegance and grace.Her chest heaved visibly from anger. Xin Siyue suddenly pulled out the small hairpin that kept her hairstyle together and let her soft, long black hair fall. She fiercely scolded, \u201cShouldn\u2019t I be the one asking you? Did you forget to take your meds when you left the house?\u201dXin Siyue had regretted what she said the instant it came out of her mouth. If Chen Sinan forgot to take his medicine, then she had definitely left her brain at home! How dare she scold Chen Sinan without a second thought?!Her body trembled as she felt his dangerous gaze. As Chen Sinan spitefully narrowed his eyes, she thought of how her story would meet its tragic end.She calmed herself, but still felt her heart beating wildly. If she truly upset Chen Sinan, he could bring her to her death in minutes.How could she have done something so rash?!Xin Siyue\u2019s legs went soft. If she decided to grovel and apologize to Chen Sinan, she\u2019d be going against how she had portrayed herself thus far. If she did, would she lose her pride? Didn\u2019t the saying go, \u201cone can lose anything but dignity and imposing manner\u201d? What would happen if she continued to play her stubborn act \u2018til the end? Or would it be better if she admitted that she was wrong?But during her indecisiveness, Chen Sinan did something that made her blood run cold. He took off his jacket and draped it considerately over her shoulders. He even helped her pull the jacket closed, while she stood stunned. \u201cYou made a fuss and beat me up already. Don\u2019t anger yourself. Look at how little you\u2019re wearing, are you sure you\u2019d want to go out like that?\u201d he said in a gentle voice.Shoot! You\u2019re the one who forced me out, okay?!After criticizing him in her thoughts, she realized she was paying attention to the wrong thing!What was Chen Sinan planning now that he suddenly started acting gentle? As if on cue, the moment Xin Siyue turned around, a handful of beautiful women stared directly at the two of them.Xin Siyue understood it all. Chen Sinan was using her as a shield, and she needed to play along in order to escape.Xin Siyue was in no mood to put on a monkey show with him, so she turned around, acting depressed. \u201cTake me back home. If you have any problems, tell me on the way,\u201d she said helplessly.Xin Siyue knew that he was going to use her, but she also knew her request wasn\u2019t one he could reject. She forced him to bring her home in order to close off their act perfectly because, in the long run, he couldn\u2019t risk people knowing it was all a ruse.Chen Sinan looked at the lonely view of her behind, knitting his eyebrows pensively. He then followed after her.On the way back, Xin Siyue leaned her head against the back of the car seat. Her hazy eyes glazed over the bright lights passing by. She was bored.After Chen Sinan took a few minutes to get accustomed to the dark, he couldn\u2019t help but look at her.She already took off the suit jacket as soon as she got in the car, folding it and placing it in the back seat. The urgent sensation that he sensed from her was really as Mao Shiyuan described\u30fcshe was avoiding him like he was a scorpion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - Let Me GoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.40 Let Me GoThe urgent sensation that he sensed from her was really as Mao Shiyuan described\u30fcshe was avoiding him like he was a scorpion.Thinking of the conversation Xin Siyue and Ji Yi had, Chen Sinan\u2019s face filled with sadness.Xin Siyue felt his gaze and thought about it before sitting up straight. Her eyes fixed on the unceasing red numbers in front of the crossroads, she said, \u201cI know why you acted so oddly tonight,\u201d with a serious tone in her voice.Chen Sinan still kept his bitter demeanor and didn\u2019t respond. She continued, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m very unhappy that you used me to protect your peach blossom, know that I\u2019m not your enemy. Even if I\u2019m unwilling, you can still mess with me to get me to do what you want.\u201dXin Siyue felt as small as an ant while talking to him. Her voice steadily lost its will and energy. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. I\u2019ll take responsibility for the gossip and PR. But I hope that we\u2019re done after this. Although I don\u2019t remember anything, I get the feeling that I was often irrational and caused you a lot of trouble in the past. I\u2019m going to apologize to you seriously for everything. If we ever meet again, let\u2019s just act as if we don\u2019t know each other.\u201dEver since she got in the car, Xin Siyue had been mulling over it, and finally mustered enough courage to tell him.She didn\u2019t want to be hopelessly muddled with Chen Sinan and experience the same ending as in the book, especially after all her hard work to avoid its setup.She was insignificant, and if Chen Sinan wanted to play her, he needn\u2019t sacrifice anything to do so. She couldn\u2019t endure that risk.She was scared that her family would actually become bankrupt\u30fcthat they would die out violently.Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t help but sigh. \u201cChen Sinan, I let you down in the past, but please have mercy. Please let me go.\u201dAs she made her final request, she felt as if the heat welling up beneath her eyes would finally make her cry. She was innocent. She felt wronged. She had crossed over, not knowing why, and ended up worrying each and every day, knowing that she might really lose everything like in the book\u2019s ending. Why was he still making things hard for her even though she tried her best to avoid him?Chen Sinan\u2019s slender fingers softly tapped the steering wheel. When he saw that she was about to cry, he shifted his attention and looked away in irritation. He looked out in front of him, thinking about what he felt deep in his heart after hearing her beg, and how he couldn\u2019t explain what he was feeling. His face darkened, becoming more and more terrifying.Xin Siyue detected the slight change of atmosphere as well. She thought that she had annoyed him because he didn\u2019t like seeing women cry, so she tried her best to hold in all the sadness. However, before she could fully hide her feelings, she suddenly heard Chen Sinan say emotionlessly, \u201cGet out.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xin Siyue was stunned.\u201cGet out! Don\u2019t make me repeat myself again.\u201dXin Siyue was frightened by his icy expression, obediently opening the car door and leaving. The moment her feet touched the ground, she heard the sound of the car\u2019s ignition, and when she snapped out of her trance, it had already left her sight.Xin Siyue stood in the wind by the cold crossroad. The fact that she was forced out of the car by Chen Sinan, suddenly hit her. She also realized that she didn\u2019t bring a phone. What was most tragic was that she had left her handbag in the car!A breeze blew by, and Xin Siyue felt the unrelenting cold assault her shoulders.\u201cChen Sinan! You call yourself a man?!\u201dXin Siyue scolded Chen Sinan\u2019s eighteen generations while she walked.After Chen Sinan drove the car for a distance, all the while seeing how blurry her weak body was becoming in the rearview mirror, he eventually stopped driving.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - Turned DownPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.41 Turned DownChen Sinan gazed deeply into the rearview mirror and couldn\u2019t help but curse. He took out his phone, about to call Mao Shiyuan to pick her up, when he saw her slowly walking in her heels. He couldn\u2019t help but put his phone down.Someone had quite the attitude!He parked the car on the side of the road and rolled down the window. The wind blew in and lifted his irritation away. He placed one hand by the edge of the window, his gaze still fixated on the stubborn figure that occasionally switched from walking to stopping.Xin Siyue thought of asking Xin Qiancheng for help after borrowing a passerby\u2019s phone, but when she thought of the lecherous male gazes she had received, she stopped thinking about it immediately. She realized that she didn\u2019t know anyone\u2019s phone number in this world to begin with. She had saved them in her phone and never paid them any more attention.She also discovered that she didn\u2019t even know her own number.Xin Siyue raised her hand to her face, massaging her forehead. \u201cHeaven really wants to ruin me!\u201dAfter walking for almost twenty minutes, Xin Siyue suddenly noticed that the black car up ahead was no longer moving.Xin Siyue abruptly had a thought\u30fc \u201cHm, Chen Sinan isn\u2019t the type to show compassion\u201d \u30fcbefore she wisely stopped herself from thinking any further in that regard.But the closer the car was, Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t help but feel that he was in there.He didn\u2019t abandon her, but that wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. Did he want to torture her because he had nothing else to do? What was his problem?When Xin Siyue moved closer to the car, she wanted to walk directly past the window.She didn\u2019t want to talk to him at all! If she did, she was afraid that she might just throw her heels at his face!Seeing that she was still in a fit, Chen Sinan had no choice but to get out of the car and stop her.Xin Siyue proudly raised her chin and coldly said, \u201cGet lost!\u201dThere wasn\u2019t a person in the world besides Xin Siyue who dared tell him to \u201cget lost\u201d. Chen Sinan took a deep breath before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal\u30fc\u201dHe couldn\u2019t even finish his proposal before Xin Siyue rejected without a hint of hesitation. \u201cNo!\u201dChen Sinan couldn\u2019t help but smile at her angry expression. \u201cI didn\u2019t say what it was yet.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested no matter what it is.\u201d She stubbornly looked in another direction, unwilling to look at his face.Chen Sinan stopped smiling and looked at her. \u201cAs long as it has to do with me, you\u2019re not interested, right?\u201d\u201cYou saw the video?\u201d Xin Siyue asked, suddenly remembering what Mao Shiyuan had done.Seeing that he hadn\u2019t deny it, Xin Siyue smiled slightly. \u201cThis will save me breath, then. I\u2019m entirely uninterested and don\u2019t want anything to do with you. I always thought that you wanted the same, too.\u201dChen Sinan wanted to retort with, \u201cHow do you know what I\u2019m thinking?\u201dBut before he opened her mouth, she continued, \u201cI think it isn\u2019t your style to try building a relationship with me. I understand you, Chen Sinan, so let\u2019s stop tormenting each other. Why don\u2019t we just stay on opposite sides of the world? If you really don\u2019t want to see me, I won\u2019t attend these banquets in the future and focus on learning, alright? And if you\u2019re still worried about me staying in Sheng Jin City, then I\u2019ll just leave, alright?\u201dSeeing how far she stooped to tell him all that, Chen Sinan could feel what she was really trying to tell him: \u201cShe didn\u2019t care about him at all! She wanted to be far away from him!\u201dChen Sinan was displeased with how things had ended up, suddenly remembering how that night alone, he\u2019d already been rejected by the same woman standing in front of him multiple times.Xin Siyue was really something.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was nearly unable to hold in his anger as he said, \u201cXin Qiancheng\u2019s phone number.\u201dXin Siyue blinked a few times. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dChen Sinan was speechless.He tossed his phone back in the car and opened the door. \u201cGet in,\u201d he ordered.Xin Siyue was determined not to yield to him. \u201cNo!\u201d\u201cXin Siyue!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t get in your car!\u201d Xin Siyue continued.Hmph! You already drove me out once. If I go back in, wouldn\u2019t I basically be saying I have no pride?Chen Sinan had never encountered anyone who disliked him that much. People needed to know that even if someone begged to hitch a ride with him, he wouldn\u2019t even bat an eye!Chen Sinan was seething. \u201cWhatever!\u201dDespite her refusal, Xin Siyue urgently pulled on him. \u201cDon\u2019t. Why not call Mao Shiyuan or Ji Yi to pick me up and bring me back to school?\u201dThey were the only people who she was familiar with, and Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t think of anyone else who would come pick her up in the middle of the night.Chen Sinan looked coldly at her and asked, \u201cYou want them to know what happened between us? You\u2019re not afraid of being made a laughing stock?\u201dXin Siyue didn\u2019t think of that, but still replied, \u201cEither way, they think it\u2019s impossible for us to be together, so no worries! Plus, you\u2019ve told me that I\u2019m already a laughingstock to everyone. Why would I be afraid if more people did?\u201dChen Sinan maintained his icy stare. \u201cHmph, well you\u2019re positive.\u201d\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t positive, who knows how many times I would\u2019ve died by now,\u201d Xin Siyue replied carelessly.In the past, when her parents fought over her father\u2019s affair\u30fcher mother had to stay in the hospital for a few months due to the beatings she suffered, and her father didn\u2019t even visit once. He abandoned the family for another woman without an ounce of shame, and she had to get several jobs to survive and pay her tuition. She thought of committing suicide, so she could be free from all her problems, all the hardship.But she knew life was still infinitely beautiful, and she could endure it no matter how terrible it was to her. Nothing seemed that bad.Xin Siyue decided that she\u2019d never hold those bad memories close to her heart.Even if she occasionally became upset or sullen, her emotions would shortly float away like smoke.The most important thing was to have hope; nothing else mattered.As she seemed to straddle the line between joking and serious, Chen Sinan had no choice but to guess the validity of her statement.Xin Siyue smiled, no longer wanting to think about it. It would probably be too difficult for her to return to her world anyways. The past wasn\u2019t important anymore.\u201cHow about this? Let me borrow $200 now, and I\u2019ll have my brother return ten times the amount.\u201dChen Sinan could feel his pulse pounding in his temples.After Xin Siyue finished, she discovered his expression turned gloomy.Did she say something wrong?Chen Sinan\u2019s demeanor showed his irritation as he said, \u201cGet on.\u201dXin Siyue shook her head.\u201cGet. On.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dChen Sinan was too tired to argue anymore, so he proceeded to bend over and carry her over his shoulder.Damn! Could you make me any angrier?! This is how you carry a sack, not a woman!She felt the blood rushing to her head. Xin Siyue slapped Chen Sinan\u2019s long legs, screaming, \u201cHey! What are you doing? Put me down! I\u2019m gonna be sick! I\u2019m going to be really, really sick! Chen Sinan, you better put me down!\u201dChen Sinan shoved her in the car. \u201cIt\u2019d be so much easier if you were unconscious,\u201d he said through clenched teeth.\u201cYou\u2026!\u201dXin Siyue sat in the passenger seat\u30fcher face was almost abnormally flushed. She panted while leaning against the window, with only enough energy left to give Chen Sinan a murderous stare.Conversely, Chen Sinan didn\u2019t even have the energy to pay attention to her. If he treated her nicely, she\u2019d quickly get out of hand again.\u201cQuickly! Don\u2019t you dare come out.\u201dChen Sinan was once again speechless. Why was she treating him like he was ugly?Chen Sinan\u30fcwho had never been disliked by others\u30fcgave Xin Siyue one final sharp gaze before he turned around and sped off.Seeing his car finally drive off, Xin Siyue let out a well-deserved sigh. She turned around with a smile to greet Xin Qiancheng. \u201cWhy are you back so early, brother?\u201dXin Qiancheng looked at the car disappearing into the night, before shifting his attention to her. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find you back then, and when I tried calling, I also realized that you didn\u2019t bring your phone.\u201d\u201cMhm, I forgot it\u2026\u201dXin Qiancheng pointed in the direction of the car. \u201cWho was that?\u2019\u201cAh, no one in particular,\u201d Xin Siyue said, planning to change the topic. \u201cBrother, I want your help with something.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d The two talked as they strolled in.Xin Siyue asked sincerely, \u201cAre there any ways to bring me somewhere\u2026 non-local?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - TransferPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.43 Transfer\u201cSomewhere non-local?\u201d Xin Qiancheng didn\u2019t quite understand what she was saying.Xin Siyue nodded before continuing, \u201cI want to leave Sheng Jin City, but I don\u2019t want to leave the country, either. Life outside the country would be tiresome, and especially lonely if I was left by myself. As long as it isn\u2019t Sheng Jin City, I\u2019d be fine with somewhere in the country as well.\u201d\u201cWait. Tell me the reason first.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to be here because I don\u2019t want to see Chen Sinan,\u201d Xin Siyue answered truthfully.She knew from the book that Xin Qiancheng was against the two of them being together.She thought that if she told him she wanted to leave Chen Sinan; Xin Qiancheng would help her no matter what.Xin Qiancheng thought deeply before asking, \u201cYou still like him?\u201d\u201cNo, no!\u201d Xin Siyue frantically waved her hands. \u201cIt might have to do with what I did in the past. I don\u2019t remember anything, but I\u2019m sure that what I did brought a lot of problems for me. I just want a peaceful life\u2026 a calm one. I\u2019m not saying I want to drop out of school, but I want to learn in a different environment\u30fcin a place where no one knows me or Chen Sinan.\u201dWhen Xin Siyue finished, still aware of Xin Qiancheng\u2019s hesitation, she promised, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, brother. I will come back in two years at the longest; that\u2019s when I graduate. Mom and dad won\u2019t be against it either, that way.\u201dThe only fear Xin Qiancheng had, was that his parents wouldn\u2019t agree to this. They treated her like their treasure. She was only leaving for two years to gain experience and forget about Chen Sinan.Xin Qiancheng nodded in response. \u201cWhich city would you want to go to?\u201d\u201cWhich cities are there?\u201d Xin Siyue thought, as if she was asking about different types of food.Xin Qiancheng raised his eyebrows. Was her memory the only thing his sister lost?Xin Siyue seemed to understand his concern and laughed sheepishly.She had no choice. She wasn\u2019t even sure if this world had the cities she knew in her previous one.In order to disguise how dumb and uninformed she was, she said, \u201cYou can make the decision, brother.\u201d\u201cHmm, then you should go over as an exchange student. That would be the best way.\u201dXin Siyue nodded again. \u201cRight! Not bad. When can you confirm the date?\u201dXin Qiancheng seemed pensive as he stared at her. \u201cWhen would you like to leave?\u201d\u201cThe quicker the better\u201d \u30fcXin Siyue thought about it\u30fc\u201cTomorrow is best. Wait, that feels a bit rushed. How about the day after?\u201d\u201cThree days from now.\u201d Xin Qiancheng decided to fix a time for his indecisive sister.\u201cOkay!\u201d As expected, Xin Siyue agreed.The next day, she went to explain her plans to their parents. Though they couldn\u2019t bear to see her go, they eventually agreed, persuaded by the reasons Xin Siyue had made up on the spot.Xin Qiancheng was made to prepare everything.When Xin Siyue returned to school, she heard from Zhong Qin that there were two spots for exchange students to A College. No one knew who was going to arrive.But Xin Siyue paid little attention to that. She, instead, started to admire Xin Qiancheng. He was handsome and acted professionally swift!By the evening, the department notified that besides Xin Siyue\u30fcwho was an exchange student\u30fca senior sister in her third year was able to take the remaining spot.That senior sister had exceptional grades and was very strong in all aspects. It was understandable that she was admitted.But what about Xin Siyue? Why was she able to?When Xin Siyue returned to the dorms, she heard some girls by the staircase who weren\u2019t happy about the decision. She softly laughed giving no more than a slight glance in their direction and declaring, \u201cBecause I\u2019m Xin Siyue!\u201dEach and every girl\u2019s face turned sinister and ugly.Xin Siyue shook her head. She couldn\u2019t be bothered to care about what they thought, but she did admit that she often bullied people based on their status.She had experienced two lives. Since ancient times, no one could choose their background. No one could choose the power they were born into. You were simply destined to work harder and endure more if you weren\u2019t lucky at birth.Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t help but laugh. As expected, power and wealth were the good things in life. No wonder people relentlessly chased after them until death.Xin Siyue packed her luggage when she returned, and when it was time to go, she was seen off by her entire family.Xin Siyue listened to her parent\u2019s ramblings\u30fcmaking sure that she ate her meals on time, that she slept early, and similar rabble. She agreed to everything.\u201cIf you have any problems, call me, or find A College\u2019s principal. I\u2019ve already talked to him,\u201d Xin Qiancheng assured.\u201cOkay. Thank you, brother.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dAs Xin Siyue said her final goodbyes, she felt all manner of feelings swell up in her heart. Other than a slight distaste for the situation, all-in-all, she was looking forward to what awaited her.A new day would shine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - A\u00a0CityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.44 A\u00a0CityXin Siyue had only lived in A College for a week, but she was already beginning to think that the quality of life and education here was much better than college life in Sheng Jing City.In Sheng Jin City, all the students\u2019 attention would be on her because of Chen Sinan. Even if they\u2019d never forget her, it was only because of everything \u2018she\u2019 had done in the past.When she was reading the book, she felt like the second female lead always had disaster by her side. But now that she had become the lead\u2026oh, how irritating it was for others to constantly remind you of your tumultuous past!So, the change in environment made her feel amazing\u30fcbeautiful, even.Xin Qiancheng already talked to her departments\u2019 teachers and A College\u2019s principal, so they all took care of her. The students also occasionally helped her out, most likely in order to show her the best of the school\u2019s hospitality.Xin Siyue sighed, thinking that this was how a normal school life should be like.During the first few days following her arrival, her popularity grew quickly. Not only was she beautiful, but it was rare that someone like her openly enjoyed learning. Most importantly, she was easy to get along with. She would greet every teacher and peer she came across\u30fcsweetly, and without ever failing to. Over time, she had left a favorable impression on everyone.Xin Siyue was incomparably happy. It was a good decision to come to A City! Her days were bright and fulfilling.When Zhong Qin called her and heard about how well things were going at A College, he had the urge to fly over and seek shelter there as well.Xin Siyue felt that she learned a lot from A College, as she surrounded herself with good, diligent people. She had improved in all manner of ways.When she moved to A City, she immediately contacted her new dance and piano teacher on her second day there.Her plan was to take two to three hours every night to learn both.In the past, Xin Siyue never learned how to dance. Her movements felt rigid, but since her body was originally the second female lead\u2019s, it had already become accustomed to dancing at a young age. Much to her surprise, it wasn\u2019t hard to do pirouettes, or even splits and the like.As she learned, she could feel her senses sharpening when she heard music. She often didn\u2019t know what move to do, but it was as if her body made the decision for her.The frequent praise Xin Siyue received from her teacher made her truly happy.Meanwhile, Chen Sinan and Mao Shiyuan were getting ready for their new company and were extremely busy.Chen Sinan stood at the forefront of the huge Shen Company, bogged with work nearly 100% of the time.He made a habit of drinking coffee at night, when returning from business trips. One night, Mao Shiyuan couldn\u2019t help but warn him, \u201cWork is important, but you shouldn\u2019t treat your body like it isn\u2019t.\u201dChen Sinan placed his mug down, not once breaking his attention from his files as he absently replied, \u201cI know.\u201dMao Shiyuan knew it wasn\u2019t a sincere response. He leaned by the corner of Chen Sinan\u2019s desk and stared at the workaholic. \u201cI really should find a woman to take care of you.\u201dChen Sinan naturally didn\u2019t bother with him.Mao Shiyuan thought carefully before saying, \u201cSheng Wenyang is in America, and who knows when she\u2019ll come back. Meanwhile, Xin Siyue is in A City. She said she\u2019d be back in two years, but who knows? It\u2019s still closer than America, though. If I want to call her\u30fc\u201dChen Sinan raised his head and looked sharply at him, stopping his train of thought. \u201cShe went to A City?\u201d he asked.\u201cShe?\u201d The sudden question had stunned Mao Shiyuan, and it took a moment for him to realize that Chen Sinan was asking about Xin Siyue. He could only nod stiffly under such an intense gaze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - Coincidence or Not?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45 Coincidence or Not?Mao Shiyuan felt it was odd how Chen Sinan expression changed so suddenly.He pondered more before asking, \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that she went to A College as an exchange student?\u201dChen Sinan quickly lost the energy he previously demonstrated. \u201cHow come I never heard that our school and A College\u2019s school had this type of friendship?\u201d he asked, with his gaze still set on Mao Shiyuan.After hearing Chen Sinan\u2019s question, Mao Shiyuan was suddenly reminded of what he was going to say before being interrupted. \u201cI really don\u2019t think I\u2019d be saying this if you didn\u2019t remind me, but our school has never cooperated with A College. This is the first time, and what a coincidence that Xin Siyue took the opportunity to move.\u201dThat was one hell of a \u201ccoincidence\u201d!\u201cWhat coincidence?! Someone definitely made it happen, and it was either Xin Siyue or Xin Qiancheng,\u201d Chen Sinan thought to himself, as his demeanor turned icy.She probably couldn\u2019t have done it, given how unintelligent she acted. Xin Qiancheng must\u2019ve been the one.What was the point? Was it to avoid him?The more Chen Sinan thought, the more he thought it was true.Lately, Xin Siyue wanted to convey only one thing, and it was that she wanted nothing to do with him.Why did she suddenly change her major? Why did she suddenly move out of her apartment? Wasn\u2019t it obvious enough when she decided to escape Sheng Jin City to A City while he was on a business trip?The thoughts spun in his head, giving him the kind of pensive gaze, he would never have otherwise.What she said by the road was true, and she was quick to do what she said.\u201cHmph. Xin Siyue, I\u2019ll admit you have some tact.\u201dMao Shiyuan was close enough to feel the strong, imposing emotions that Chen Sinan was practically exuding.He quietly retreated back by a few steps, and mustered the courage to ask, \u201cAre you angry?\u201dNormally, Chen Sinan wouldn\u2019t be angry. Those who made him angry would suffer from his wrath, and he would use everything at his disposal to make sure they did.\u201cHmph, why would I be angry? Xin Siyue\u2026that woman\u2026isn\u2019t worth the time I\u2019d spend being angry. If she wants to run away, then let her run away. I\u2019d like to see where she runs off to,\u201d Chen Sinan replied.Hearing the dark, unfiltered spite in Chen Sinan\u2019s voice nearly turned Mao Shiyuan to stone.Xin Siyue, in A City, sneezed at the same time.Everything was good in A City but was just a bit too hot in the summer. Her class had many cases of heatstroke.Xin Siyue tried avoiding it as best she could, even to the point of spending half an hour in the evening to go for a run, but she had heatstroke as well.Being sick in the summer was no laughing matter. Her body alternated between burning hot and cripplingly cold, and she constantly felt dizzy and robbed of energy.Xin Siyue stayed in the dorms for half a day, took some medicine, and went to sleep. A fever even appeared, but she didn\u2019t feel any better.Xin Siyue figured she needed to go to the hospital, but she didn\u2019t even have the energy to flag a taxi. Instead, she called 120 and when the rescue workers arrived, she made herself proud by opening the door in her weakly state.After that last display of willpower, she was completely passed out well before arriving at the hospital.She had no idea how long she slept; she was at the hospital when she woke. It was the middle of the night, and the place was empty.She noticed that her IV was almost done and pressed a service bell to signal her nurse to pull the needle out.When the nurse saw her finally awake, she smiled and said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re calm. You were gravely ill, but you didn\u2019t come to the hospital until it got this bad.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She couldn\u2019t respond and only thought about rolling her eyes\u30fcshe didn\u2019t have the energy to do that either, of course. If she knew that sickness could be so harsh, she would\u2019ve gone to the hospital immediately.To think that her new body would disappoint her in such a way\u2026 When she was sick in the past, she had gotten halfway better just from sleeping.Xin Siyue concluded that wealthy children had naturally fragile bodies.The nurse saw that she hadn\u2019t fully recovered yet, and reminded her again, \u201cIt\u2019s really not good for you to be alone right now. Call your parents and have them come over.\u201dXin Siyue didn\u2019t want to call. They were at Sheng Jin City, anyway, and there was no point in making them worried.When the nurse saw the reluctant look in her young patient\u2019s eyes, she decided to ask, \u201cAre your parents not here?\u201dXin Siyue thought that the nurse really understood her, so she nodded her head.\u201cDo you have a boyfriend? If you do, call him over. If not, call your classmates,\u201d the nurse continued.\u201cThank you.\u201d Xin Siyue said, stopping the nurse from saying any more.She had no boyfriend, and she just met her classmates for a week. She felt embarrassed having someone take care of her in the middle of the night.Xin Siyue had nothing to do, so she went back to sleep, only waking up the second day from hunger. The rumbling of her stomach was becoming unbearable, but she couldn\u2019t go out herself, so she thought about getting her nurse to bring some light food for her instead.She had just pressed the service bell when her door suddenly opened. Xin Siyue was taken aback by how fast it swung open when she suddenly was suddenly greeted by the sight of a particular noblewoman standing by the door. It Chen Sinan\u2019s mother, Weng Yinlin.Xin Siyue was shocked. Why did Weng Yinlin appear in her room?Unable to react, she stared wide-eyed at the woman wearing a light purple dress.Behind her were her secretary and driver. As she entered, the exquisite handbag she held came into view and left Xin Siyue silently awed. Her grandiose fashion paired perfectly with such an elegant figure. But no matter what she wore, she was pleasing to the eyes.Seeing as the bed-ridden woman before her was awestruck, Weng Yinlin smiled and said, \u201cHello, Miss Xin. Do you still remember me? We met before.\u201dXin Siyue nodded stiffly. She didn\u2019t understand why Weng Yinlin wanted to see her.Weng Yinlin laughed, \u201cYesterday, I was at the hospital for some business and saw the doctors push you into the emergency room. I thought it was you but didn\u2019t dare to be certain. After finding the doctor and making sure, I came to visit. Have I disturbed you, Miss Xin?\u201dXin Siyue\u2019s heart trembled at how polite and respectful Weng Yinlin was.Wasn\u2019t Weng Yinlin swift and decisive, commanding her speech with an overbearing tone? Why was she speaking like that?Xin Siyue didn\u2019t know how things could have turned so wrong. Even the setup was wrong. Completely wrong. Every time Weng Yinlin talked with the female lead, sparks flew and blood spilled by the gallon.But now that she was acting so amicable, Xin Siyue was terrified.Should she call Xin Qiancheng and ask for help?She wondered where her phone even was.She looked all around and discovered that she didn\u2019t bring it! Again!Shoot!Weng Yinlin observed how Xin Xiyue\u2019s eyes sparkled occasionally, even though her face was sickly pale. \u201cHow did you become like this?\u201d she asked concerningly. She then proceeded to give orders to her secretary\u30fcall of them pertaining to Xin Siyue. The demands included everything from preparing her meals to nursing her body.Xin Siyue grew increasingly frightened as she saw it all unfold, wondering if there was a trap waiting for her behind Weng Yinlin\u2019s kindness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She chased after him only to see him and Xin Qiancheng bickering with one another as soon as they met.At that time she heard Chen Sinan say, \u201cMy mother said that Xin Family is pretty good and that the young miss of Xin Family is very lovable.\u201d Weng Yinlin swore that she had never said those words before.She clearly understood her son whom she had carried in her womb for ten months. He definitely wasn\u2019t one to lie, unless he used it as a means to torment someone.She had heard of the Xin Family; they were considered to be a wealthy family in Shengjin City. Compared to many famous families who were arduously working their way up the financial ladder, they were quite a normal family.Was her son interested in the young miss of Xin Family?The fact that she heard a female name from Chen Sinan\u2019s mouth was already unbelievable enough.Weng Yinlin quietly ordered for her subordinates to investigate the young miss from the Xin Family.However, she was surprised when she found out that this family\u2019s young miss was her son\u2019s neighbor! Her instincts told her that the two knew each other from way back then and as expected, she was right.Weng Yinlin was surprised that Xin Siyue was originally very interested in her son. But lately, she had been rejecting his contact after having an accident.This mother thought that this was quite amusing, so she ordered someone to pay attention to Xin Siyue\u2019s actions.Xin Siyue had unexpectedly become an exchange student in A City.Coincidentally, Weng Yinlin made a huge investment in a movie and wanted to pick out a female lead from a school in A City. Besides, there was also a director in A City who had picked out some people as a potential female lead in the movie, so she had come to A City to take a look.Of course, there were staff members who could\u2019ve helped her pick out the female lead, so she didn\u2019t have to personally come to A City. However, the main reason she had traveled personally to this city wasn\u2019t to help pick out a female lead, but to meet Xin Siyue. She wanted to know more about her background, and more importantly, she wanted to see if Xin Siyue could be a potential candidate as her daughter-in-law.When she saw Xin Siyue\u2019s pitiful and tragic appearance, she thought that she wasn\u2019t a bad candidate. She looked delicate and fragile. Her son was someone who didn\u2019t know how to be considerate and these types of girls made it easier to arouse his feeling of protection.She was a powerful and independent woman, so she wished that her daughter-in-law was someone with the complete opposite personality. It\u2019s best if she had a gentler personality so it would be easier to get along with her.\u2018Hm, not bad, not bad.\u2019 At least, Weng Yinlin didn\u2019t detect anything bad from this meeting.When she came out of the hospital room, she called Chen Sinan.Weng Yinlin didn\u2019t go straight to the point either. She just smiled and said, \u201cI am at A City right now.\u201dBecause of all sorts of award ceremonies, Weng Yinlin had flown all around the world countless times. She could appear in one city in the morning and another city in the afternoon. But she never called him to tell him about her journey.Chen Sinan had an important meeting in a few minutes, so he asked expressionlessly, \u201cMother, what are you up to again?\u201dWeng Yinlin already knew that he would be sensitive to her teasing, but she still tried to tease him, \u201cGuess who I saw in A City\u2019s hospital. When I saw her, she looked rather pitiful. She was sick to the point that she almost fainted. The girl rode the ambulance to the hospital alone, and without even someone to take care of her by her side. Seeing her pale face really made my heart ache for her\u2026\u201dChen Sinan frowned, \u201cWhat do you really intend to say?\u201dWeng Yinlin said, \u201cI almost forgot that Feng Dao wanted to discuss the casting process with me. Bye.\u201d After she finished talking, she hung up on him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He felt like she had an ulterior motive when she had called him.\u2018A City? Hospital? Someone both he and Weng Yinlin knew?\u2019After he thought about it for a while, he finally realized who she was talking about.He leaned against the back of the black chair and swiveled the chair. After glancing at his phone thoughtfully, he can\u2019t help but yell, \u201cServes you right!\u201dAfter the phone call, Weng Yinlin was looking forward to seeing what Chen Sinan would do. Would he immediately call her back or would he personally come to her and demand to know what happened?However, what disappointed her was that even after quite a while, Chen Sinan didn\u2019t take any actions.Weng Yinlin hurriedly made another call to him, \u201cThis is bad! The doctor said that Xin Siyue\u2019s illness has relapsed! I\u2019m afraid her illness has become even more serious\u2026\u201dChen Sinan lazily replied, \u201cAren\u2019t you there with her? Since you pity her so much, would you actually leave her alone?\u201dAfter he finished attending a meeting, Chen Sinan was finally able to calm himself down. The phone call from Weng Yinlin this morning might\u2019ve been a trick she was playing on him.Xin Qiancheng had sent Xin Siyue to A City, how would he leave her to die?Weng Yinlin wondered whether she had given birth to a cold-blooded child. She said, \u201cSince you don\u2019t want to come here and see her for the last time, then forget about it!\u201d After she finished talking, she hung up the phone with a depressed expression on her face.Could it be that her guess was wrong?When Weng Yinlin went to visit Xin Siyue in the evening, Xin Siyue noticed that the girl looked even more upset than she was that morning.Weng Yinlin sat down and chatted with her. Xin Siyue was frightened, but she sincerely asked, \u201cAuntie, why did you come here?\u201dThey weren\u2019t familiar with each other!Weng Yinlin smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been away in a foreign country for so long, it\u2019s always nice to meet up with an old friend.\u201dXin Siyue forced herself to smile. They\u2019ve only met once and they had never said anything to each other before, yet they\u2019re considered to be \u2018old friends\u2019?In spite of the awkwardness, Weng Yinlin continued to smile. She asked, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that you\u2019ve chased after A-Nan before?\u201dWhen Xin Siyue heard the question, she immediately waved her hand. She tried to clear her name and said, \u201cNo, no, no! After I had fallen and hit my head, I\u2019ve forgotten everything. It\u2019s probably because I was still young and didn\u2019t know any better, so I did some embarrassing things. Auntie, towards Chen Sinan, no, I meant I have no inappropriate ideas regarding Senior Chen!\u201d\u201cYou have no inappropriate ideas regarding A-Nan?\u201d Weng Yinlin asked strangely.\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t have any!\u201d Xin Siyue quickly explained, \u201cHe is too outstanding. How can someone like me chase after him? It\u2019s best if I don\u2019t force it. What\u2019s more, isn\u2019t there still Sheng\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d When Weng Yinlin saw that the girl had intentionally stopped talking mid-sentence, so she thoughtlessly gestured for her to continue talking.Xin Siyue had a close call; she almost revealed the existence of Sheng Wenyang. Chen Sinan and his family should resolve this and talk about this among themselves.As a result, Xin Siyue tried to conceal her earlier slip up by saying, \u201cNothing! Auntie, thank you for taking care of me! When I am discharged from the hospital, I will tell my parents and let them thank you!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. We are brought together by fate, otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have met.\u201dWhen Xin Siyue saw that Weng Yinlin had put her hand on her right hand, she was frightened to the point that she got goosebumps all over her body.Oh my god! Can you stop acting so kind and gentle? The difference between your attitude was too drastic, it\u2019s making me afraid!Xin Siyue tried her best to deal with Weng Yinlin. When she saw that Weng Yinlin had finally left her hospital room, she let out a sigh of relief the moment the door closed. She was exhausted as she laid down on her bed.That was too tiring!Xin Siyue can\u2019t figure out what Wen Yinlin wanted to do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She dreamt that she was working as a slave in the Chen Family while Weng Yinlin ordered her around\u2026The scene changed and she was kneeling in front of the Chen Family\u2019s gate. While she faced the tightly closed golden gate, she kowtowed again and again as she tearfully shouted Chen Sinan\u2019s name, begging him to let the Xin Family off\u2026In the dark room, there was no light source besides the occasional ray of light from the moonlight when the curtains swayed to the side. In the small and quiet room, the smell of disinfectant water was clear and distinct.Chen Sinan was still in formal attire when he arrived in her hospital room; he was still dusty from rushing here. Chen Sinan expressionlessly looked down at the unconscious person on the bed.Chen Sinan saw that Xin Siyue looked very uncomfortable, so he leaned towards her and reached out one of his hands to feel the temperature of her forehead. However, before his hand touched her, he heard her say, \u201cNo! No! Chen Sinan, I beg you, please let me go\u2026\u201dChen Sinan was stunned, and his hand froze in midair.He had heard her say those words before. When she had moved out of the apartment complex, she had said those words to him. After she said those words to him, she left Shengjin City. She looked happier and more at ease after she left and went to A City.The expression on Chen Sinan\u2019s face turned cold as he stared at her. He saw her expression turn more and more uneasy and fearful, to the point where he could almost hear her cry.Chen Sinan narrowed his eyes and slightly leaned down again. He reached out one of his hands and stroked her forehead, which was drenched in sweat and burning hot.He immediately pressed the service bell and tried to wake her up, \u201cXin Siyue, wake up! Wake up!\u201d\u201cChen Sinan, I beg of you. Please\u2026\u201dIt seemed like she still hadn\u2019t awakened from her nightmare as she tightly clung onto his sleeve and stained his clothes with her tears.When Chen Sinan turned on the light, he saw that her face was very pale. She was biting her lips as tears drops continuously flowed out from the corners of her eyes. He quickly helped her into his embrace and tried to coax her, \u201cOkay, okay! I will agree to whatever you say!\u201dXin Siyue couldn\u2019t hear a thing as she was still immersed in her nightmare.Chen Sinan wanted to wake her up, but his efforts were in vain. When the doctor finally came, Xin Siyue finally calmed down and quietly fell asleep after he gave her a shot.Chen Sinan saw that she had stopped crying but the tear marks on her face had not dried up yet. Without saying another word, he directly said, \u201cGive her the paperwork to transfer to another hospital!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The doctor still didn\u2019t understand what was going on.Chen Sinan ignored the doctor and directly called his assistant to contact the best doctor in A City.Xin Siyue, who remained asleep, didn\u2019t know that she had changed hospitals because of Chen Sinan. When she finally awakened, she was struck with a terrible headache. There was a buzzing sound in her head, while a sticky and uncomfortable feeling spread all over her body.In a daze, Xin Siyue opened her eyes. She wanted to push away her blanket because it was too hot.When she raised her arm to push away her blanket, she was restrained by the person beside her. \u201cStop!\u201dThis voice\u2026Xin Siyue\u2019s body stiffened when she heard the voice. She slowly raised her head and just as she had expected, she came face to face with the person from her dream.Xin Siyue immediately remembered the terrifying nightmare she had last night. It seemed so real that it looked as if it was about to happen to her.Afraid, she hurriedly pushed Chen Sinan away from her, but she didn\u2019t know that there was an IV drip attached to her other arm. Just as she pushed him away, she had accidentally pulled out the needle from her other arm. The pain from forcefully pulling the needle out made her wrinkle her eyebrows in pain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now, right after she woke up, the first person she saw was him! She released a sigh and asked in a dissatisfied manner, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dChen Sinan\u2019s fingers were pressed against the back of her hands. He could clearly feel that the temperature of her hand was different from what it would normally be.However, once he heard her interrogative tone, he became upset. Isn\u2019t this what he should be asking her? Why did she decided to leave Shengjin City, and come to this godforsaken place?Chen Sinan was very unhappy, so despite the fact that Xin Siyue waited for a long time, she still received no reply. She gave up on his answer and thought: Hmph! You don\u2019t want to say it? I don\u2019t want to know the reason anyways!The two people remained silent for a moment, and the atmosphere gradually turned strange.In a short while, Xin Siyue broke the stalemate: \u201cChen Sinan, help me call Xin Qiancheng.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Chen Sinan stared at her and noticed that she leaned against the bed with a pale face. She looked as if she had nothing to live for.Xin Siyue slowly opened her eyes and said, \u201cHave my brother come over and take care of me.\u201d She knew that if she called her brother, he would come over and arrange someone else to take care of his matters, even if he was extremely busy.Xin Siyue didn\u2019t want to contact him before because she didn\u2019t want to trouble him. However, that would still be better than having Chen Sinan by her side.Chen Sinan had deliberately changed his plans, pushed back his meetings, and rushed over. Around midnight, when he had arrived, he hadn\u2019t even bothered to book lodging. He had gone directly to the hospital to find her. He then transferred her to another hospital, found the best doctor for her, and accompanied her for the rest of the night. However, when she woke up, she didn\u2019t even recognize his efforts; this was such an eye-opener.Chen Sinan didn\u2019t care about whether or not the back of her hand was still bleeding. He stood up, folded his arms across his chest, and coldly gazed down at her: \u201cXin Siyue, the word heartless really does suit you.\u201dXin Siyu was stupefied: \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cThe literal meaning.\u201d Chen Sinan walked to the side and picked up his suit jacket. He exited the hospital room without looking back, \u201cI\u2019m not kind enough to help you call Xin Qiancheng. Whether you\u2019re dead or alive has nothing to do with me!\u201dThis irritating attitude and tone\u2026Xin Siyue leaned against the bed and felt that she was angered to the point where her all her internal organs were steaming. She didn\u2019t think before firing back, \u201cYou really think too highly of yourself! Whether I\u2019m alive or dead, did it ever had anything to do with you? Chen Sinan, don\u2019t try to fool around with me anymore. I will live much better that way.\u201d\u201cHa.\u201d Chen Sinan snorted and left without looking back.When had he ever fooled around with her? The one who was always trying to entangle with him was her! Her words seriously caused people to be angry!At that time, his brain must\u2019ve really been confused, causing him to run all the way to City A to listen to her biting sarcasm!After Chen Sinan left the hospital room, he closed the door with a loud bang, leaving Xin Siyue shocked inside. She didn\u2019t understand, why was Chen Sinan so angry?There\u2019s no need to bother about him! Anyways, he was indisputably the male lead! It was fine if he doesn\u2019t appear before her!After Xin Siyue finished thinking, she pressed the service bell. When the nurse came in, she asked in bewilderment, \u201cHow come the nurse from yesterday did not come?\u201dThe nurse displayed a professional smile. After hearing Xin Siyue\u2019s words, she turned to her and replied, \u201cAfter you came in last night, I was the one who took care of you.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Xin Siyue finally reacted and looked at her surroundings. It was different from the one she was in before. She hesitated a bit before asking, \u201cSo I had transferred rooms?\u201d\u201cNo. You came here in the middle of the night yesterday.\u201dXin Siyue was shocked, \u201cWho helped me transfer hospitals?\u201d She was quite comfortable there. How come she was suddenly transferred?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She replied in an even tone: \u201cYour boyfriend.\u201d\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d Xin Siyue felt like she was struck by lightning.Who was the boyfriend? Chen Sinan? What sort of conspiracy was Chen Sinan trying to plan?Xin Siyue felt that it had something to do with his mother; otherwise, how can two busy adults appear at the same time in City A?Xin Siyue did not have the energy to think about it. She was incredibly hungry and couldn\u2019t wait to have breakfast. Surprisingly, a man wearing a suit was the one who delivered it to her.Xin Siyu saw that the man looked to be around 27 years old. Although he had an honest air about him, she would not eat anything of an unknown origin.The man knew that and was prepared: \u201cI am Mrs. Chen\u2019s assistant, and I\u2019m here to deliver food to Miss Xin.\u201d\u201cWeng Yinlin told you to send it?\u201dThe assistant was stunned to hear her directly call out the name of the boss\u2019s mother. He lightly nodded.Xin Siyue bit her lip and hesitated on whether or not to eat, \u201cWeng\u2026no Auntie. Why did she ask you to bring breakfast for me? In the past, wasn\u2019t it the nurse auntie who\u2019ve always sent it?\u201dThis\u2026the assistant blushed in shame. He hurriedly made up a lie, \u201cIt\u2019s just that she wasn\u2019t feeling well today.\u201dXing Siyue had some doubts; however, when she tasted the porridge, she found that it was very delicious. She couldn\u2019t help but eat a few extra bites.After the assistant left the hospital, he went to the parking lot. Just as he entered the car, he hurriedly turned his head and saw the face of his boss sitting in the backseat. His expression was very gloomy. It seems like he shouldn\u2019t be provoked.In the small enclosed space of the car, the atmosphere was tense and scary. While the assistant was trying to be smart by keeping silent, he heard his boss asked without raising his head, \u201cHave you eaten?\u201dThe assistant subconsciously wanted to say no! He had gone more than halfway across a city to buy breakfast and he had to wait in line for a long time before he was able to order breakfast. Yet, he wasn\u2019t even able to eat a bite of it! However, the \u2018no\u2019 in his mouth was quickly changed to, \u201cI have eaten!\u201dHe would only think that his boss was truly concerned about him if there was a hole in his brain! His Boss was clearly trying to ask about the young lady in the VIP ward!After Chen Sinan heard his reply, his gaze turned unclear. No longer wanting to continue the conversation, he switched the topic and said, \u201cCall Xin Qiancheng and explain to him about the current situation.\u201dA 'say what\u201d almost flew from the assistant out of impulse. He knew that if he really did say that, he would have to pack up and go home afterwards.So, he pretended to calmly nod his head.After Xin Qiancheng received the call, he was left speechless. He immediately called Xin Siyue, but her phone was turned off.At dusk, Xin Siyue leaned against the window in boredom and stared out at the sunset. Suddenly, the door to her room was pushed open by someone rushing in.She turned in surprise and was met with a black-faced Xin Qiancheng who had a scary look in his eyes.She disappointingly shrank back her shoulders, then used a fawning tone: \u201cBrother, why did you come?\u201dAfter Xin Qiancheng learned that she had been sick for so long without contacting anyone, he was extremely angry. He wanted to crack open her head to see what was stuffed in there!\u201cXin Siyue! You are preposterous! If you dare to hide such a big matter again, you should roll back to Shengjin City! What does one Chen Sinan count as? If you want to avoid him there are thousands of other methods you can use to do so! You don\u2019t need to go through this much pain!\u201dXin Qincheng thought about how their parents had protected her, cradled her in the palm of their hands since she was young, and how pained they felt about her going off abroad to study by herself. That was still fine but falling sick for so many days and not contacting anyone was not!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How come Chen Sinan and Xin Qiancheng were acting so abnormal?Xin Siyue quickly put on a smile and followed up, \u201cBrother, there\u2019s nothing wrong about me. Look, don\u2019t I look just fine?\u201dXing Qiancheng glared at her and said, \u201cYou shut up!\u201dXin Siyue wanted to spit but had no choice other than to obediently shut up.Even though she felt that she can be discharged tomorrow with no problems, Xin Qiancheng still made her go through a full-body exam. She was only discharged after Xin Qiancheng received the report saying that everything was normal.Unfortunately, on the day of her discharge, Weng Yinlin purposefully came in to visit her.Xin Siyue was panic-stricken! Chen Mama, what situation is this?Weng Yinlin was disappointed at her useless son. She knew that he was on the plane to A City and verified that he went to the hospital afterward. She thought excitedly that she should leave some privacy for the couples to interact with each other for a few days.Weng Yinlin was busy with casting, so when she remembered to ask about the progress between the two, she found out that several people discovered Chen Sinan\u2019s trip to A City on the first day he arrived. Due to that, he was so busy that he didn\u2019t go to the hospital at all on the second day in A City.Even though he\u2019s still in A City, it looked like he came here for work by making himself as busy as the president of a country.Weng Yinlin called him and asked him what happened.With his stubborn temper he replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to care about this affair, and even if you do, there\u2019s not going to be any result.\u201dHumph, she doesn\u2019t care about him, he would not rush to coax her.However, Chen Sinan\u2019s assistant felt that his boss was very hard to endure this time! His personality was already cold, and now under this intense pressure, he doesn\u2019t want anyone to survive!Weng Yinlin\u2019s tone towards him was puzzled. After pondering about it for a while, the only way to explain this strange situation was that\u2013the couple was fighting.Since she can\u2019t get any information from Chen Sinan, she can only find Xing Siyue.But when she arrived at the hospital, Xing Siyue was leaving the building.Xing Qiancheng helped his sister carry a little luggage and some of the prescription drugs.When he saw Weng Yinlin approaching them, he just glanced at Xin Siyue with a questioning expression.The only thing Xing Siyue could do was smile and reply, \u201cIt\u2019s Auntie Chen.\u201dWeng Yinlin glimpsed at Xing Qiancheng and turned to asked Xing Siyue \u201cHave you fully recovered?\u201d\u201cThank you, Auntie Chen, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Xing Siyue was apprehensive on the inside.Weng Yinlin continued to smile and said, \u201cI rarely come here, maybe we should eat dinner together.\u201dXin Siyue was thinking about rejecting the offer tactfully, but Xin Qiancheng was very direct, \u201cMrs. Chen, thank you for the thought, but my sister just recovered. There are some foods she can\u2019t eat.\u201dWeng Yinlin replied immediately, \u201cOf course, I asked someone to prepare you some healthy recipes, they\u2019re just waiting for you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAuntie Chen, thank you. You don\u2019t have to be this kind, it\u2019s too much trouble for you.\u201d\u201cNot at all, my son happens to be at A City. Tonight, we can\u2026\u2026\u201d Weng Yinlin just realized that this was the first time she had mentioned her son\u2019s name; both the Xing siblings restrained their negative expression at the same time.Not waiting for her to finish, she heard Xin Siyue said in a weak yet firm voice \u201cAuntie Chen, I think you\u2019ve mistaken something.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dXin Siyue smiled faintly, \u201cChen\u2026\u2026there\u2019s nothing going on between Senior Chen and me. We don\u2019t have any relationship; we are not even considered friends. Auntie is being too nice to me and I feel a little anxious.Weng Yinlin doesn\u2019t believe it, \u201cI remember him\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAuntie Chen, Senior Chen already like someone else. You can ask him directly if you want to know.\u201d\u201cNo need to ask.\u201dA deep voice took over right after Xin Siyue finished her sentence.Xin Siyue was startled and turned her head guiltily. She discovered that Chen Sinan had suddenly come out of nowhere.Oh my god! I\u2019m in huge trouble!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - To Protect HerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.53 To Protect HerIt was 10 a.m. on a hot summer day. Under the sun\u2019s harsh heat, Xin Siyue was already sweating even though she only stood by the car for a few minutes. Although she should\u2019ve sensed the burning heat from the sun, for some reason, she felt the air around her turn cold and her hands felt frozen.Xin Siyue\u2019s sharp eyes followed Chen Sinan closely. She was afraid that he was going to lose his mind and do something harmful to her.She clearly saw him gnash his teeth when he had said, \u201cNo need to ask.\u201d Aside from that, she also sensed his anger.Xin Siyue was unaware as to why he was angry. As she tried to figure out why he was so mad, she finally came to the conclusion that it must be due to her accidental mention of the female lead\u2019s existence.In the novel, Chen Sinan had concealed the existence of the female lead from the Chen Family\u2019s elders for so many years just to protect her.As Xin Siyue continued to ponder about this, she became more certain that she had crossed his bottom line.She stared at him without moving her eyes. Xin Shiyue saw him walk next to Weng Yinlin with a gloomy face. He asked his mother if she was leaving and even offered to drive her.Weng Yinlin was also good at observing others. Although the two of them had only exchanged a sentence with each other, after she examined their expressions, she can already guess that they were bickering. At least, she hadn\u2019t seen her son this angry for many years.Weng Yinlin thought for a while before she nodded her head told them that she was leaving now. Then, she turned to Xin Siyue and said, \u201cTake care of yourself, I will come again once I get a chance.\u201dXin Siyue nodded her head, but she was already overwhelmed on the inside. She thought: Auntie, can you stop tormenting me and just let me survive on my own? I just want to live peacefully!Weng Yinlin had no idea what she was thinking; she only saw sadness reflected in Xin Siyue\u2019s bright eyes. The young girl looked more and more pitiful the more she stared at her.As Weng Yinlin prepared to leave, she gave Chen Sinan a deadly look. \u2018It\u2019s all your fault!\u2019Xin Siyue wanted Chen Sinan to go as quickly as possible. When she saw that Weng Yinlin was ready to leave, she was about to tell Xin Qiancheng to quickly leave as well. However, before she had the chance to even talk, she heard a threat from behind, \u201cXin Siyue, you better not see me again, or else I would never\u2013\u201dChen Sinan stopped his sentence midway for a long time and he still didn\u2019t finish the sentence.Xin Siyue turned around to look at him fearfully and saw him staring at her with his sharp eyes. That sharp expression, it looked as if he wanted to kill her as soon as possible!\u201cUgh\u2026\u2026\u201d Xin Siyue clearly felt her heartbeat accelerated. That was scary!After being scared by him, fear was reflected on her small face. Her originally thin face caused by the sickness was now pale white after his threat.Chen Sinan looked at her pale face and grind his teeth secretly; he left without looking back.Humph! Out of sight, out of mind!Xin Siyue was utterly confused. What did he mean by only saying half of a threat?After seeing the two people finally wrap up their business, Xin Qiancheng walked over to Xin Siyue\u2019s side. That was when he noticed that her complexion was worse than before. His expression turned ghastly and he scolded, \u201cHe has already left, are you still going to stay day-dreaming?\u201dXin Siyue\u2019s flickering look was not out of nostalgia, but out of confusion! If she appeared in front of him again, what would he do to her?Xin Siyue thought over the ending of the book and her dreams. She realized that no matter which ending, neither of them was a desirable ending for her.She sighed and turned to follow Xin Qiancheng back to the car, then asked hesitantly \u201cBrother, should I go abroad?\u201dIf she goes abroad and not come back, at the very least, she wouldn\u2019t see Chen Sinan again.Xin Qiancheng rolled his eyes at her, \u201cYou\u2019ve already tortured yourself to this point by just going out of the city. Don\u2019t even think about going abroad.\u201dXin Siyue laid on the seat at the back of the car and sighed leisurely.It turns out that even if you have wealth and a happy family, trouble will still find you. She needed to prevent Chen Sinan from destroying all her happiness every second.Xin Siyue\u2019s sorrowful look made Xin Qiancheng a bit annoyed, \u201cYou still can\u2019t forget about him?\u201dXin Siyue was still immersed in her own thoughts, so she replied without thinking, \u201cHim? Who?\u201dXin Qiancheng glanced at her and the expression on his face was basically saying: \u2018Pretend! Continue pretending!\u2019Xin Siyue sighed stressfully, \u201cYou mean Chen Sinan? Why can\u2019t I forget about him? Oh, actually, if you have to say I can\u2019t forget about him, then it must be that I\u2019m afraid he would kill me someday as if he\u2019s crushing an ant.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Also, did you forget that you have support from the Xin Family?\u201dXin Siyue didn\u2019t forget, but she also remembered how Xin\u2019s Family was like an unstable building; it fell so easily when Chen Sinan moved his fingers.She didn\u2019t know how to explain everything to Xin Qiancheng, so she said, \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s just better to have a backup plan.\u201dXin Qiancheng looked at her intensely and said after a while, \u201cI think you got sick this time because of grieving. You never thought so much before, how come after you fell, you changed entirely.\u201dXin Qiancheng often doubted if she was his biological sister. But her look and appearance, if it\u2019s not her then who is it?Xin Siyue can\u2019t help but replied, \u201cI also hope that I\u2019m just overthinking.\u201dXin Qiancheng saw that she was still lifeless, he thought of something and asked, \u201cWas what you told Weng Yinlin true?\u201d\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d Xin Siyue didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.Xin Qiancheng stared at her and lazily asked, \u201cChen Sinan likes someone?\u201dXin Siyue nodded, \u201cYeah! The whole school knows.\u201dXin Qiancheng looked at her suspiciously. He had asked someone to go to the school to find some information, but all the gossip in the academy was all about Xin Siyue.Xin Siyue said, \u201cChen Sinan and Sheng Wenyang are a perfect couple!\u201d\u201cSheng Wenyang?\u201d\u201cYeah, she went abroad, but she will be back in two years.\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201dAfter she was questioned by Xin Qiancheng, Xin Siyue realized that she accidentally slipped up, so she explained laughingly, \u201cMao Shiyuan said that! Oh, he\u2019s Chen Sinan\u2019s friend.\u201d\u201cIs his last name Mao?\u201d Xin Qiancheng asked with a frown face.Xin Siyue didn\u2019t think too much of it and only nodded, \u201cYeah. Why? Do you know him?\u201dXin Qiancheng only looked at her meaningfully, of course he knew who Mao Shiyuan was. In order for Xin Siyue to get closer to Chen Sinan, she had bothered Mao Shiyuan the most before. However, being close friends with Chen Sinan wasn\u2019t a good thing.\u201cDon\u2019t get too close to him.\u201d Xin Qiancheng said while driving.Xin Siyue didn\u2019t think it matters since they wouldn\u2019t often meet each other, so she replied readily, \u201cOkay!\u201dAfter Xin Siyue left the hospital, Xin Qiancheng stayed in A City two more days. But due to his continuously accumulating work, he had to rush back to Shengjin City.\u201cIf the same thing happens again next time, you are going back to Shengjin City and don\u2019t ever think about going anywhere again.\u201d Xin Qiancheng said as he was about to leave.Xin Siyue wisely nodded her head and pretended to be obedient, \u201cOkay, I will promise to eat and exercise every day. I will take care of my body!\u201dXin Qiancheng glanced at her; he was clearly not convinced by her words.But he found her a reliable housemaid before he left. Xin Qiancheng told the housemaid to cook for Xin Siyue 3 times a day and help her clean the house.Xin Siyue became speechless. It wasn\u2019t like she didn\u2019t know how to do those chores!But when she argued with Xin Qiancheng, he replied coldly, \u201cThe only thing in your refrigerator are noodles, do you think I can trust you?\u201dXin Siyue forced herself to smile. She really knew how to cook, but she thought that it was just too much work and a waste of time, so she usually ate meals that were easy to cook. Who would\u2019ve thought that her brother would actually underestimate her cooking skills! Xin Siyue believed it was about time for her to show off her skills and scare him to death!After Xin Qiancheng left, Xin Siyue\u2019s life went back to normal. She went to school in the morning and learned to dance and to play the piano at night. To sum it up, she was pretty busy.The same happened to Chen Sinan. After he returned to Shengjin City, he was extremely busy. He often worked overtime and constantly engaged in social activities related to his business.In the middle of June, the new company was finally established. Chen Sinan didn\u2019t go to the official establishment event of his company. He simply left all the work to the person in charge\u2013 Mao Shiyuan.Feeling perplexed, Mao Shiyuan asked, \u201cYou founded the company, so why aren\u2019t you attending such an important event?\u201dChen Sinan simply replied, \u201cI just want to see how far the company can go without Chen Family\u2019s protection.\u201dMao Shiyuan understood part of his intention, but he didn\u2019t fully understand everything. Why was he trying to prove his own capabilities when the continuously growing Chen Company was the best proof of his abilities?Chen Sinan didn\u2019t want to utilize the Chen Family\u2019s resources for this company, it was such a pity. Mao Shiyuan thought that if the two companies merged together, it would be possible for the newly merged company to become the world\u2019s most powerful company!However, Mao Shiyuan kept the thought to himself and followed Chen Sinan\u2019s will to the end.Nobody can prevent Chen Sinan from doing what he wanted to do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Coincidentally, the news leaked two days before Chen Sinan\u2019s graduation ceremony, and the whole school was seething.\u201cChen Sinan paid for this entire massive project?! He\u2019s so wealthy!\u201dAs for those who looked up to Chen Sinan, the news only served to demonstrate the disparity between them.The girls, eager to confess to him, prepared as much as possible in the little time before the graduation ceremony. But, after searching the whole day unsuccessfully, they learned that he wasn\u2019t coming!Without an important figure like Chen Sinan attending, the girls soon lost interest in the ceremony. With the whole school already enraged, the atmosphere turned even darker in his absence.Zhong Qing and her roommates also woke up early and dressed elaborately. One reason was to congratulate the seniors with flowers, and the other was to experience Chen Sinan\u2019s charm one last time.What they didn\u2019t expect was they would never get to see Chen Sinan, even after staying in the sun all afternoon, and taking photos with seniors until their faces were sore.\u201cYou were right telling me not to go!\u201d Zhong Qing exclaimed. She was texting Xin Siyue on WeChat after returning from the ceremony.Xin Siyue was at the library when she received the text. Unaware Zhong Qing was talking about the Chen Sinan\u2019s graduation; she replied: \u201cNot to go where?\u201d\u201cI was trying to take pictures with Chen Sinan! Oh my god, we stood under the sun for an eternity before we found out that he wasn\u2019t even coming!\u201dXin Siyue couldn\u2019t help but laugh, replying \u201cYeah.\u201dIn the book, Chen Sinan also didn\u2019t attend the graduation ceremony. The villainess also had the same expectations as Zhong Qing and went to wait for him, only to never see him.Then she went to his apartment, but Chen Sinan also wasn\u2019t there. Feeling it was unusual of him not to appear, the villainess went straight to his company to visit him. However, the personnel at the front desk refused to let her in, saying she can\u2019t meet with the CEO without an appointment.The villainess started to cry and make a scene, forcing Chen Sinan\u2019s assistant to come down and instruct security to take her home.Xin Siyue thought it was fine being alone in A City since she wasn\u2019t constantly forced to find excuses to avoid those kinds of situations.Xin Siyue was still trying to calm a forever complaining Zhong Qing while picking out her books.Zhong Qing typed for a while and sent a voice message. Xin Siyue, having left her wallet at her seat, went back for her earbuds. She bumped into someone as she walked out of the aisle.Xin Siyue didn\u2019t have time to look, but from the person\u2019s height, posture, and body language, she could tell it was a boy. She quickly apologized and bent down to help pick up his books.As she picked up the first book, she heard, \u201cNo need to apologize,\u201d in a deep voice.That voice\u2026Without a second thought, Xin Siyue looked up and blurted \u201cXia Qiao?\u201dXin Siyue was lucky enough to be a guest at one of his events. The academy invited two famous online writers to A College to talk to students about their dreams and experiences; the event\u2019s sole host was Xia Qiao.Xin Siyue witnessed his wit and unrivaled eloquence that day. His skill received much praise and admiration.At the end of the event, Xin Siyue was complimenting the host with her classmate Gu Tong.\u201cWhat did you expect? It\u2019s Xia Qiao,\u201d Gu Tong told her while smiling.Xin Siyue was confused. \u201cWho is he?\u201d\u201cThe number one academy host!\u201d Gu Tong said in high spirits. \u201cHave you heard of Senior Li?\u201dXin Siyue shook her head.\u201cShe\u2019s the senior who was hired by the City TV show,\u201d Gu Tong explained.Xin Siyue vaguely remembered one of the professors mentioning the girl when she just joined A College. She heard that Senior Li was not only versatile but highly skilled in all facets. The academy recommended her as an intern at the show right after she graduated and, after her probationary period, she was officially hired. She was present on many TV shows even today.\u201cSenior Li is already superb, right? But when she came back to the academy last year and saw Xia Qiao\u2019s talent, even she praised him! She said that it\u2019d be a piece of cake for him to get in with his talent. As long as he was willing, his success in the industry was inevitable,\u201d Gu Tong continued.And now, Xin Siyue unexpectedly met the man himself.Xin Siyue blinked a few times, to be certain that she identified him correctly. Everything about him was nice. His voice was already pleasant, but it sounded even more attractive when lowered.\u2018If Gu Tong heard what Xia Qiao said earlier, she\u2019d be so excited that she\u2019d never be able to fall asleep,\u2019 Xin Siyue thought.After that event, she also confirmed that Gu Tong was a total Xia Qiao fangirl.Xia Qiao saw Xin Siyue looking around nervously, and couldn\u2019t hide his smile anymore. The sunlight shining through the window made her smile look even more attractive in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - Xia Qiao (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.56 Xia Qiao (2)Xia Qiao stretched out his arm to organize his books.Xin Siyue looked a bit embarrassed as she stood up. She had stopped picking up his books because she was lost in thought. With only one book in her hands, she awkwardly placed it on top of his stack and said, \u201cSorry, I got distracted.\u201dXia Qiao stared at her, raising his eyebrows and smiling. \u201cCould I ask if you were thinking about me?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d The corner of Xin Siyue\u2019s mouth twitched, as she found herself at a loss.\u201cYou\u2019re an exchange student from Shenjing City, right? Do we share the same major?\u201d Xia Qiao asked further.Xin Siyue nodded, but she didn\u2019t expect Xia Qiao to continue. \u201cIf you were hosting a show right now, I think that reaction would have been a little too slow.\u201dXin Siyue was completely out of her element, and after that final comment, it showed. He was right.\u201cWhen we interview guests, we ask questions. But a lot of times, the answers will include rhetorical questions of their own, which are the hardest to answer. So, when you\u2019re conducting an interview, and you meet a guest who unexpectedly asks you questions, your reaction would only make the situation awkward,\u201d he said, breaking the silence of her long pause.Xin Siyue admitted that he was correct, but to have someone so talented advising someone like her was a bit unexpected.Without waiting for Xin Siyue to finish her sentence, Xia Qiao\u2019s smile grew bigger. He looked into her eyes and said, \u201cI know you.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re Xin Siyue.\u201d\u201cOh my god!\u201d Xin Siyue thought. He knew everything! Even though she had never interacted with him before; even though this was his first time seeing he. \u2026how did he know?Before she could even ask, Xia Qiao kept his smile and continued, \u201cI still have things to do, so I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\u201dXin Siyue could only watch as he left, unable to figure out how he knew her.Distracted by the run-in, Xin Siyue forgot that she needed to listen to Zhong Qing\u2019s voice message.Meanwhile, Chen Sinan had finished work and was dropping by the school to discuss his upcoming project with the principal, when someone bumped into him from behind. He had a sturdy frame, so he wasn\u2019t hurt, but the smell of perfume made him frown.Not bothering to even to turn around; all he heard was laughter coming from behind him. Then, he heard a clear female voice calling his name, \u201cChen Sinan!\u201dStill unconcerned, Chen Sinan kept walking until the person rushed in front to block his path.He looked at the girl in front of him, with long hair, wearing a long dress that resembled a woman\u2019s sailor uniform from the torso up. \u201cThis person doesn\u2019t look as good as her.\u201d It was the first thought that crossed his mind.After realizing who 'she\u201d was, he suddenly frowned.After seeing his demeanor change, the freshman girl who blocked him simply stood and said nothing.Chen Sinan decided not to bother with her and kept walking. But the girl was persistent enough to block him again.Chen Sinan finally spoke. \u201cI hate women who don\u2019t know how to tell good from the bad. Just like that woman.\u201d\u201cIf you say it a third time, I\u2019ll personally make you pack your belongings and leave,\u201d Chen Sinan growled without even looking in her direction.The girl was stupefied and started crying.Chen Sinan left as if nothing had happened.Upon arriving at the principal\u2019s office, Chen Sinan didn\u2019t say a word. He simply seated himself with a particularly nasty expression from his earlier encounter.Principal Zhao, who wore glasses, finally lifted his head to examine him. He was curious about where Chen Sinan\u2019s anger originated. \u201cWhat happened? Your anger is so intense, it\u2019s spreading to my side of the table,\u201d He asked earnestly.Chen Sinan never knew why he couldn\u2019t control his emotions when he was at school. He massaged his temples, and finally calmed down a little. \u201cNothing,\u201d he answered coldly.Without giving his opinion on the matter, Principal Zhao decided to change topics and asked, \u201cWe\u2019ll be cutting the ribbon for A College\u2019s new building in the next couple of days. Do you think I should go?\u201dAs soon as Chen Sinan heard \u201cA College,\u201d he turned to look at Professor Zhao with an intense gaze. \u201cNow that you mention it, when did we become so well acquainted with A College?\u201dFor obvious reasons, Chen Sinan grew even moodier.But Principal Zhao became more excited.Being a youth was so much fun.\u201cCEO Chen, would you do me the favor of joining me in A City?\u201d Principal Zhao asked with a smile.Chen Sinan thought of how ungrateful the principal was, noting the man\u2019s attitude and disregard for his feelings in the principal\u2019s comments. He rejected almost immediately. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to waste.\u201dPrincipal Zhao didn\u2019t bother trying to change Chen Sinan\u2019s mind, instead, he continued to smile and said, \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate.\u201dAfter leaving school, Chen Sinan received a call from his childhood friend when entering his car. There were only a few people in Shengjin City who were both close to him and in the same age group.Other people called his friend \u2018Zhuan Zi,\u2019 but Chen Sinan never wanted to use that name. Zhuan Zhu was curious as to why, and even asked him once.Chen Sinan glanced at him lazily and chuckled. \u201cAre you philosophical like Zhuan Zi?\u201dZhuan Zhu nearly choked. \u2018Was he being sarcastic?\u2019 But when he thought of his barely passing grades, he relented.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - Matchmaking (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.57 Matchmaking (1)After Chen Sinan picked up shainhe phone, he heard Zhuan Zhu speaking in a spirited voice. \u201cBei Zi is returning today, and we\u2019re planning a welcome home feast. Are you coming later?\u201dChen Sinan thought it over and asked, \u201cWhat time?\u201d\u201cTonight at 8.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201dChen Sinan thought there was still time until dinner, so he returned to his old house. He hadn\u2019t gone back to see his grandfather for months because of his busy schedule.Of course, the real reason was that his grandfather was trying to force him to meet with the Lai Family. He wasn\u2019t planning on forgiving him just yet. That\u2019s why even after Weng Yinlin called Chen Sinan so many times, telling him to go back to the old house to eat dinner, he refused.She thought that if she ignored him, he\u2019d only act more reckless in the future.As Chen Sinan\u2019s car pulled in front of the old house, he saw another white car. The model was clearly one that a woman would drive.Chen Sinan, his father, and his grandfather were all the only children of their respective generations. He also didn\u2019t have many female relatives. But despite all that, the car\u2019s owner was most likely a young woman.While entering the house, his mind filled with guesses of who the visitor was. Before he arrived at the lobby, he saw his Aunt Song walking towards him from the garden. \u201cAunt Song, who\u2019s visiting grandpa?\u201d he asked.Aunt Song had been working in the Chen family for more than ten years, and she saw Chen Sinan as her own child. When she saw him, she was overjoyed that he finally came back after so long, and what a coincidence! Miss Lai was also over. \u201cMiss Lai is here to accompany your grandfather. We didn\u2019t think you would also come back today, but perfect timing! I\u2019m preparing dinner now, so you should stay,\u201d she said cheerfully.The Lai family?Chen Sinan thought for a while and remembered the existence of this \u201cMiss Lai\u201d, but he couldn\u2019t remember her face.Chen Sinan could hear her gently complaining to his grandfather as he walked in. \u201cGrandpa, you\u2019re being too hard on me! How can I win like this?!\u201d\u201cHmph. Only that fellow can beat me a couple of times in this world. Other people? Don\u2019t even think about winning.\u201dChen Sinan\u2019s first impression of the uninvited guest was far from good, especially when he heard her acting shy. \u201cGrandpa, are you talking about Sinan?\u201d she asked coyly.\u201cWho else?!\u201dAfter he finished, his grandfather saw Chen Sinan standing out of the corner of his eye. Speak of the devil.He took a single glance at his grandson. \u201cYou still know the way back?\u201d he asked mockingly.\u201cI intended to come back, but now that I\u2019ve seen someone so insignificant here, I guess there wasn\u2019t any need to,\u201d Chen Sinan coldly stated.Grandpa Chen decided to ignore Chen Sinan.Miss Lai saw that Chen Sinan finally came back, and became so happy that joy was practically oozing from her face. After all her persistence, after every day she came to his old house to make his grandfather happy\u2026it finally happened!Chen Sinan wasn\u2019t moved by her advances. He didn\u2019t even look at her, choosing not to reply either. \u201cI see that you\u2019re living a pretty good life, don\u2019t let me disturb you,\u201d he replied to his grandfather, instead.Grandfather Chen badly wanted to beat him with his cane but held back. He didn\u2019t want to embarrass Chen Sinan in front of a guest. \u201cYou unfilial thing!\u201d he bellowed.\u201cSame to you,\u201d Chen Sinan replied softly. With that final comment, he gave his grandfather a murderous look and walked out.Aunt Song caught him leaving early, and urgently asked, \u201cWhy are you leaving so early? Why don\u2019t you leave after dinner?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t feel like eating with an outsider.\u201d The sentence was basically a slap in the face to Miss Lai.Aunt Song carefully examined Miss Lai\u2019s expression; the entire situation could only be described as awkward.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Aunt Song knew that she couldn\u2019t make Chen Sinan stay, and decided to let it go.She saw Miss Lai leave right after Chen Sinan. It was obvious she was chasing after him.Aunt Song was worried that Miss Lai would make things worse after she caught up with him. \u201cMaster, should I stop her?\u201d she asked Grandpa Chen.Grandpa was resting on his wicker chair, and aggressively shook it as he proudly replied, \u201cWhy would you do that? He doesn\u2019t like her, so let her bother him all she likes!\u201d After he finished speaking, he nonchalantly asked what the family was going to have for dinner.Aunt Song saw that she couldn\u2019t help either of them, so she listed dish names without another thought for Miss Lai.Whatever happened, Miss Lai was the one who brought the trouble to herself.The author has something to say: [Little Theater 1]Host Xin: Let\u2019s interview the most popular character in the novel, Mr. Chen.

Wait!\u201dWhen Chen Sinan heard his name called so intimately, he retracted his hand from the car door, turned, and said, \u201cWe\u2019re not that close, Miss Lai. You don\u2019t need to call out to me like we are.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t like it when I do that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201dAfter seeing his total disregard for her feelings, Miss Lai could feel the rim of her eyes reddening as she stood in front of him.Chen Sinan could only say that he was entirely uninterested when he realized she was about to cry. Her eyes watered up, and the sight made him want to get in his car and drive off.However, to his surprise, Miss Lai leaped towards his torso. She was scared that he\u2019d push her away, so she used all her might to lock her arms around his waist.Chen Sinan didn\u2019t expect that the daughter of a respectable family would act so repulsively.\u201cLet go.\u201d He scowled, hesitant to break her grip. The thought of touching her skin, with his very own hands, made him shudder. He didn\u2019t want his hands to suffer.Miss Lai held on as if her life depended on it. If she let go, she\u2019d probably never have the chance to see him again. She could forget about ever getting close to him.She sobbed desperately. \u201cDo you hate me that much? Do I look that ugly to you? Why do you have to avoid me! If you hate me, then why did you agree to meet me back then? Sinan, you stole my heart but treat me like this\u2026 What do you want me to do? I live in an endless world of suffering\u30fcI think of you every day, and I always wonder how you\u2019re doing. Have you ever thought of me? Even just a little bit is fine\u2026\u201dChen Sinan steeled himself and quickly grabbed both of her arms while forcing her backward.Miss Lai didn\u2019t expect him to push her away so rudely. She didn\u2019t pay attention for a split second, and suddenly she was sitting on the ground after landing right on her tailbone. She was stupefied.Chen Sinan turned to glare at her as she sat on the ground. She was crying so violently that her eyeliner was everywhere. \u201cDon\u2019t pull something like this again. It\u2019s obvious you could never be with me, and I\u2019m not someone you can just get close to,\u201d he said.Miss Lai watched in fear as he threatened her without a single indication of emotion. She turned pale as she recalled everyone\u2019s warnings. What they say about him is true. He\u2019s immune to anything a woman would use on a man, she thought to herself.Chen Sinan drove off and left Miss Lai with a face full of dust. She sat on the ground, coughing loudly and feeling hopeless. Her status had held her high above the masses, so she was always well received. She was praised by her elders since she was a child, and countless men wanted her, yet somehow she was utterly humiliated!After standing up\u30fctears still in her eyes\u30fcshe rushed into her own car and fixed her makeup. She sorted her torrent of thoughts and made a call. \u201cShi Shi, your idea was completely idiotic! Chen Sinan didn\u2019t even fall for it!\u201dThe voice on the other side of the phone responded calmly. \u201cYou saw him?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cHave you made him hate you because of your usual haphazard behavior?\u201dMiss Lai suddenly fell silent.\u201cI told you to get his grandpa to like you first, but you decided to throw yourself at him the moment you saw him. How is any of that my fault?\u201dMs. Lai was aggravated by the indifferent tone she received, and the first thing she would have done was to snap back at her cousin; if not for the fact that she was at a loss for words. Maybe she was a bit impulsive.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. But how was it that easy for that Xin family bitch to get Chen Sinan? All she did was act\u2026 weird, and drew everyone\u2019s attention in the process. Just look at Chen Sinan\u30fche didn\u2019t show a hint of emotion. If you want to make him like you, then prepare for a long war. If you decide to give up after failing once or twice, you may as well quit like that bitch did.\u201dShi Shi was proud of herself whenever she remembered about Xin Siyue. Who told Xin Siyue to act so arrogant and full of herself? Xin Siyue became much more obedient after I taught her a lesson. I heard that she doesn\u2019t nag Chen Sinan anymore, and went back to A City instead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - RuthlessPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.59 RuthlessShi Shi thought about how she had traveled for so long, and how it was time for her to return. \u201cWell, I still have things to do, so let\u2019s end the call like this,\u201d she chimed happily.Miss Lai had so much more to say but was robbed of the chance. Was it because she rushed? But with Chen Sinan\u2019s attitude, how could she not? If she didn\u2019t hook him soon, there\u2019d be even more obstacles. She would have to plan more carefully for the future.When Chen Sinan arrived at his apartment, he took off his clothes immediately. He went into the bathroom to wash thoroughly and threw everything he had worn straight into the garbage.It made his skin crawl.As Chen Sinan kept thinking back, he felt more and more like he was being toyed with. And, if he didn\u2019t get his revenge, he wouldn\u2019t be able to live with himself.Chen Sinan thought about it for another moment and decided to call Zhuang Zhu. \u201cHas the Lai family been working on a business project with you?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m about to sign the contract.\u201d Zhuang Zhu was curious about why Chen Sinan would call him to ask directly about the Lai family, given how little he normally called. A certain suspicion came to mind, and he asked, \u201cAre you close with the Lai family?\u201d\u201cNo, but the Chen company will take the project we discussed previously,\u201d Chen Sinan replied.\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Zhuang Zhu was obviously mad. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?! Last time I asked you to sign a contract, you rejected the offer as if your life depended on it. But now, you\u2019re saying you want it? I\u30fc\u201d\u201cYes or no, one word,\u201d Chen Sinan interjected.Zhuang Zhu hesitated for only a second, before firmly replying. \u201cYes!\u201d His smile stretching from ear to ear, he said, \u201cAnyone who wouldn\u2019t accept a deal like this is a fool!\u201d Everyone knew that the Chen company was wealthy.A new thought popped into Zhuang Zu\u2019s mind, so he decided to prod further. \u201cAre you cutting off the Lai family\u2019s livelihood because they offended you?\u201d The Lai family had asked literally everyone they knew for help, and Zhuang Zhu only agreed because he couldn\u2019t turn away a friend. The Lai family would\u2019ve never foreseen such an unfortunate turn of events.Chen Sinan replied bluntly. \u201cThey did.\u201dWhen Zhuang Zhu heard Chen Sinan\u2019s icy tone, he suddenly felt a great deal of pity for the Lai family. Why would they offend Chen Sinan? He was inhumanly ruthless when he wanted to be.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll tell everyone to stay away from the Lai family. Also, remember to come by later.\u201d Zhuang Zhu made sure to stress the time and location, fearing that his friend wouldn\u2019t show up.\u201cI know.\u201d Chen Sinan hung up after a curt reply.While Zhuang Zhu was out womanizing with two of his wealthy friends, Chen Sinan had already arrived 30 minutes early.Zhuang Zhu held onto the small and slender waist of a beautiful woman while his other hand was rubbing her chest. He was nearly about to yell at the waiter when he saw the waiter entering the room without his permission when he noticed Chen Sinan behind him.Chen Sinan wore a white t-shirt and slim black pants, his hands in his pockets. With his chin up, he only used the corners of his eyes to examine the smoke-filled room. He gave off the impression that he was important and noble. His demeanor demanded the attention of the room\u2019s women and filled their eyes with desire.Upon seeing Chen Sinan, Zhuang Zu bellowed at the scantily clad women. \u201cLeave! Hurry! Don\u2019t you see Master Chen has arrived?\u201dBut the women didn\u2019t want to leave. A few of them even blushed as they decided to put their feminine charm on display. They looked intimately at Zhuang Zhu and the others, making it very clear what their intentions were. They were suddenly told to leave, so they were the victims.Not to mention, after seeing their boss frantically trying to please the handsome guy, they couldn\u2019t help but want to keep Chen Sinan in their sights for just a little longer.\u201cWhat are you looking at?! Get out of my sight now!\u201d screamed Zhuang Zhu. He carefully prepared a smile for Chen Sinan and was about to speak. He never had the chance because he was interrupted by Chen Sinan. \u201cEither you change rooms, or I leave,\u201d Chen Sinan said, completely expressionless.The room reeked of cigarettes and perfume, and Zhuang Zhu knew that it would never please a clean-freak like Chen Sinan. \u201cYes! A new room! Let\u2019s change rooms!\u201d he replied immediately, before commanding a nearby waiter to prepare one for him.When the new room was ready, Zhuang Zhu welcomed his guest inside. \u201cI hope this is to your liking, Master Chen.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he stayed for the whole night, then their party would be about as eventful as a gathering for depressed monks, especially since none of the women were allowed to say. It was a pity because each and every one of them was an absolute stunner.Chen Sinan glanced at Zhuang Zhu and flashed a smug little smile. \u201cYou guys can\u2019t survive without women?\u201dThe two rich guys laughed awkwardly, and Zhuang Zhu came out nearly sneering. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that, but it\u2019s not good for my body when I\u2019m all pent up.\u201d As he finished his cheeky reply, he turned over to Chen Sinan with a smirk. He had only intended to tease but decided to stop when he saw the man in front of him shooting daggers through his eyes. Instead, he did his best to change the topic. \u201cBut man, how rare is it for you to come early? What\u2019s your reason?\u201d\u201cYeah! Just look at how honored Mo Bei is,\u201d one of his friends chimed in.\u201cI just happened to have time tonight,\u201d Chen Sinan said.\u201cNo wonder. What did the Lai family do to you to turn you so ruthless?\u201d Zhuang Zhu asked.\u201cDon\u2019t mention them right now.\u201d Chen Sinan replied. The thought of that Lai family woman hugging him was still fresh in his mind, and it made him furious.He lifted his head to address Zhuang Zhu but stopped himself. There was no point in asking.Zhuang Zhu was confused. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dChen Sinan ignored him. He was certain that, with Zhuang Zhu\u2019s IQ, it was a waste of time to ask.The handful of men sat around twiddling their thumbs until the main lead, Mo Bei, arrived.\u201cSorry. I was stuck with my family, so I only just arrived.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you\u2019re here!\u201d Zhuang Zhu looked at Mo Bei, who seemed to have grown even more handsome during his time abroad. He went up to the guest of honor, and playfully tried to punch his shoulder while saying, \u201cYou\u2019re becoming almost as handsome as I am!\u201dMo Bei laughed and dodged the pretend strike. \u201cDon\u2019t compare me to someone like you.\u201d\u201cF***. Surname Mo, are you looking for a fight?\u201d\u201cWell I\u2019m civilized, so I don\u2019t resort to violence.\u201dZhuang Zhu got even more riled up by his reply, he nearly pounced on him.Mo Bei ignored him and rushed to get rid of him by heading towards Chen Sinan. \u201cLong time no see.\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been a while.\u201dMo Bei smiled and continued the small talk. \u201cI heard you took over the family enterprises.\u201d\u201cI did. How was your time outside of the country?\u201d Chen Sinan asked.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll probably stay here for a while. I\u2019ll move back to China and see how the market is doing in the meantime.\u201d\u201cWelcome home, then.\u201dThe group of men ate a very lackluster dinner and shared a few bottles of wine. Other than the odd dirty joke, nothing special happened.After dinner, Zhuang Zhu suggested playing mahjong.All five people joined in to play, but after each game, one person waiting for a turn would end up in the loser\u2019s seat. After only a few rounds, it was clear that the game was only really between two of the men.Chen Sinan won many rounds, and so did Zhuang Zhu. As he placed a tile, Zhuan Zhu looked at his winning hand and bit into his cigarette. \u201cThe god of wealth is watching our game, and he\u2019s definitely looking over me. My hands have been amazing, Master Shen!\u201dChen Sinan was too lazy to respond.Mo Bei had also won a few rounds. He looked at Chen Sinan and casually mentioned, \u201cThere\u2019s this one woman from one of the countries I visited. I thought she was only good at cards, but it turns out she\u2019s good at everything.\u201dZhuang Zhu noticed how strange Mo Bei was acting when he talked about the woman, so he couldn\u2019t help but gossip. \u201cThere\u2019s more to her, isn\u2019t there? C\u2019mon, tell us! She blonde? She hot?\u201dMo Bei smiled, \u201cShe\u2019s not blonde. She\u2019s a Chinese woman, and A\u2019Nan happens to know her too.\u201dChen Sinan could tell what Mo Bei was trying to get at as he continued. \u201cHer name is Sheng Wenyang. She\u2019s in the same grade as you and attends the same college.\u201dChen Sinan stopped halfway through dropping a tile. \u201cSheng Wenyang?\u201dMo Bei smiled, \u201cWhen I was coming back, she promised me that you\u2019d remember. Turns out she wasn\u2019t kidding. She\u2019ll be quite happy when I tell her the news.\u201dChen Sinan laughed and decided not to speak his mind.What a coincidence; Sheng Wenyang knew Mo Bei.Zhuang Zhu examined how the two had been acting and snuck his way into the conversation. \u201cWho\u2019s Sheng Wenyang to you, A Nan?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When did Chen Sinan get a woman?Mo Bei waited patiently for Chen Sinan to clarify\u30fcChen Sinan could tell from the glint in his eyes. Without even lifting his head, Chen Sinan leisurely placed another tile and said, \u201cIf you know her so well, why don\u2019t you find out for yourself?\u201dMo Bei held back his initial reaction and only glared at Chen Sinan.He had felt an attraction to Sheng Wenyang at first sight. He spent all his time trying to get closer to her. He helped and provided everything that he could for her. But when he confessed, she was merciless. \u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d she said.\u201cBut my heart lies with someone else.\u201dAt the time, Mo Bei thought she was only using it as an excuse. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d he exclaimed.\u201cHow is it not possible?!\u201d Sheng Wenyang had firmly replied.\u201cIf you already like someone else, how come I\u2019ve never seen you talking with someone like that at all? You\u2019ve never even mentioned him.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mention him because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll turn weak just thinking of him\u30fcafraid that my heart will soften and I\u2019ll go back to China to find him. And I\u2019ve never contacted him for the same reason. If I don\u2019t hear his voice, I won\u2019t think about him as much,\u201d said Sheng Wenyang.Mo Bei was thoroughly hurt by her confession.He wasn\u2019t expecting her to continue. \u201cYou know him too.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cChen Sinan.\u201dMo Bei gave a bittersweet smile. \u201cWhy are you so sure that I know him?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re from Shengjin City, and everyone there knows of him. Mo Bei, the man I love can control the forces of nature\u30fcyou can\u2019t possibly compare. I never thought about giving him up, and in fact, I even went abroad for him.\u201dNothing is worse than an attack right after a rejection, but Mo Bei still kept his smile. \u201cAre you sure that Chen Sinan loves you? According to what I know, he was never into women.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m his girlfriend. What do you have to say to that?\u201dMo Bei\u2019s heart shattered into thousands of pieces. He wanted to call Chen Sinan for proof but was too scared to hear the truth.He wanted to forget about Sheng Wenyang, but she still acted like everything was business as usual. He remembered her saying, \u201cMo Bei, even though we can\u2019t be lovers, I still hope that we can be best friends.\u201dHe was screaming inside, frustrated at how useless he felt! Why couldn\u2019t he give up on a woman that would never return his love? Why couldn\u2019t he just let go? Her every movement, her every expression\u30fceach minute detail about her was intoxicating.Sheng Wenyang, I\u2019ll always love you.Author\u2019s words: Theater 2-Woke up on the wrong side of the bedThe two have just been married, and Xin Siyue doesn\u2019t know Chen Sinan has a problem with waking up on the wrong side of the bed.One morning, due to certain happenings the night before, the two of them only got a bit of sleep before a call on Xin Siyue\u2019s phone woke them up.The host of the station originally had a show that morning, but ran into a small emergency and called Xin Siyue for assistance. After they talked on the phone for a while, she turned and realized that Chen Sinan was also awake and staring at her, annoyed.Xin Siyue ignored him, and even after showering, he was still sitting in bed. He was entirely displeased and entirely silent.She looked at the time and saw that it only 6:30. It was kind of early\u2026Xing Siyue felt guilty for his morning grumpiness, so she walked over to him and said, \u201cSorry for waking you up. I\u2019ll make sure to put my phone on silent next time!\u201dChen Sinan was not swayed.Then, Xin Siyue shifted her gaze. She didn\u2019t care that all she had on was a towel. She lifted her leg, straddling his thigh as she leaned in for a kiss.Chen Sinan flinched but continued to stay silent.Xin Siyue kissed him again. And just as she was about to leave, she was forced back onto the bed\u2026 Somehow, she showed up to work entirely late, despite waking up so early.Later on, she found out that these morning activities were actually a habit of his, and she didn\u2019t bother to care for him even if she woke him up. He\u2019d surely get over it.After failing to get what he wanted, Chen Sinan was confused. \u201cHow come she isn\u2019t falling for my honey trap anymore? I\u2019m depressed! What should I do?

Mo Bei tried to refuse, but he wasn\u2019t as shameless as Zhuang Zhu.When Mo Bei heard Zhuang Zhu\u2019s teasing, he ignored him.Zhuang Zhu folded his hands behind his head and raised his two long legs. He lazily said, \u201cI\u2019m not criticizing you but, stealing a brother\u2019s woman really shows that you have no taste. Although whoever is more capable, the woman should be his; but there are so many women in this world. Women are like clothes, so why would you break off a decade of brotherhood for a woman?\u201dMo Bei said, \u201cI\u2019m not like you. You play with women like you\u2019re changing clothes. But the woman I like is different from all the women you know.\u201dZhuang Zhu was amused by his serious tone, \u201cIt seems that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.\u201dMo Bei glared at him, hinting that he should restrain himself before he becomes impolite.Zhuang Zhu raised his hands in surrender. \u201cD*mn, I can\u2019t even say anything.\u201dMo Bei heavily sighed; it seemed like he was still frustrated.Zhuang Zhu understood that Mo Bei was someone who would easily fall in love. However, when he actually falls in love, he would lose control. In the past, Mo Bei was madly enamored with his first love. But no one expected that his first love would make him wear a green hat**. Because of that, the Mo elders didn\u2019t even need to stop the relationship from progressing anymore. Mo Bei immediately broke up with her. Since then, he has lived an innocent life.(T/N: green hat\u2013cause the lover to be jealous, or cheat on him)Now he finally found someone he loved, and it turned out that the woman belongs to Chen Sinan, it\u2019s not surprising that it was hard for him to accept that.\u201cBrother, since that woman had said that she is Chen Sinan\u2019s woman, why are you torturing yourself about it? There are plenty of fish in the sea, don\u2019t hurt yourself over one woman.\u201dMo Bei said, \u201cAre you Chen Sinan\u2019s agent? Why are you helping him?\u201d\u201cHey! I\u2019m saying this for your sake. How can you bite the hand thats helping you?\u201d\u201cThen it seems that I have eyes but have failed to recognize Mt. Tai.\u201dZhuang Zhu felt like it was hard to talk with Mo Bei. \u201cSince we\u2019re brothers, I\u2019ve already tried to convince you. If something happens in the future, don\u2019t blame me for not stopping you from jumping into the fire pit!\u201dMo Bei didn\u2019t appreciate his kindness. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you go convince Chen Sinan?\u201d He laughed lightly, \u201cWhat? I bet you don\u2019t dare to!\u201dZhuang Zhu cried out in grievance, \u201cOf course I want to persuade him. But he is really hard to read. He either deliberately avoids my questions or answers in an ambiguous way. Who would know whether he is acknowledging something or not? Do you think you can read him?\u201dMo Bei\u2019s expression darkened. It was precisely because he couldn\u2019t read Chen Sinan that he was suspicious.When Zhuang Zhu saw his expression, he heartily laughed. \u201cHaha, do you see now? It seems like I\u2019m not the only one. Who could know what Chen Sinan is thinking about?\u201dIn fact, Chen Sinan was currently thinking about Xin Siyue.He and Xin Siyue had a great cold war in A City. The reason for the cold war was precisely Sheng Wenyang. When he heard Mo Bei mention Sheng Wenyang, he suddenly had a thought. If Xin Siyue had really lost her memory, then her previous memory regarding him and Sheng Wenyang\u2019s love affair should\u2019ve been forgotten.Now that she always have Sheng Wenyang\u2019s name on the tip of her tongue, it should be because of Ji Yi and Mao Shiyuan telling tales and making mischiefs.The more he thought about it, the more his chest tightened in pain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - To Go or Not?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.63 To Go or Not?The more he thought about it, the more his chest tightened in pain.Since Chen Sinan wasn\u2019t happy, the main culprit shouldn\u2019t have it easy either. He should give Mao Shiyuan a heavier workload, then he can vent his anger. As for Ji Yi, he sent a text message to Dean Zhao. Chen Sinan suggested that Dean Zhao should teach more lectures and set up more activities to train his juniors.Dean Zhao thought that his suggestion was pretty good, so he asked what kind of lectures and activities he should arrange.Chen Sinan moved his fingers and sent a series of questions Dean Zhao should focus on during his lectures. He even helped him draft a guest list.After Dean Zhao looked through it, he felt that everything was perfect. He contacted Ji Yi and asked the students to begin preparing.Ji Yi was busy preparing for the final exams. He was dumbstruck when he received the notification from Dean Zhao. Does Dean Zhao want to delay their holiday?In fact, Ji Yi was really naive and pure. After attending one activity after another, Ji Yi was as busy as a spinning top. When the Dean finally stopped setting up activities, the holiday was already over. The entire student union was exhausted from all the events. However, no one was more exhausted as Ji Yi.After receiving so many suggestions from Chen Sinan for no reason, Dean Zhao thought that Chen Sinan was helping him so that Chen Sinan can benefit from it. As a result, he generously sent the only invitation he had received to Chen Sinan early the next morning. Dean Zhao had also told the person delivering the invitation to leave Chen Sinan this message: \u201cThis is the only invitation I have. The Dean has already promised the principal of A College that he will send someone to attend. Because of the current relationship between the two schools, Chen Sinan, you have to attend.\u201dWhen Chen Sinan finished attending a meeting, he returned to his office. Upon entering, he saw a golden invitation with the words \u201cA College\u201d printed on it. A light flashed in his eye, and he asked, \u201cWhere did this come from?\u201dAssistant Wang Dongwen had been following Chen Sinan around the meeting, so he was naturally unaware of the answer. As a result, he immediately turned around and said, \u201cI will go investigate this.\u201dBecause he is Chen Sinan\u2019s only assistant, his workload was quite heavy. Fortunately, there are many secretaries working under Assistant Wang. Even though the secretaries also assist Chen Sinan, because Chen Sinan doesn\u2019t like having too many people around him, they were considered Assistant Wang\u2019s subordinate.When Assistant Wang went downstairs to ask the secretaries, a secretary immediately reported everything to him, saying that it was Dean Zhao who had sent the invitation. He also relayed the message, saying, \u201cThe person who had sent the invitation told me that Dean Zhao had already discussed this matter with President Chen yesterday. He also told me that President Chen agreed to it, so I acted on my own initiative and accepted the invitation.\u201dAssistant Wang should\u2019ve known about the origin of the invitation. In the past, he had never seen his boss having such a big reaction to just an invitation. This must be because Miss Xin is still in A City!Although Assistant Wang didn\u2019t know what had happened between the two in A City, he knew that this woman wasn\u2019t ordinary. This woman actually caused his boss to help her find the best doctor in the middle of the night, carry her to his car, and transfer hospitals.His biggest impression of Miss Xin was from waiting in line forever to buy her porridge. What\u2019s more, he had to deliver the porridge under Mrs. Chen\u2019s name! No matter how he thought about it, the relationship between Miss Xin and his boss was very complicated.Assistant Wang thought about before, and began praying his boss wouldn\u2019t go to A City. He still remembered how his expression was gloomy nonstop for over two days. When he finally came back to his office, the pressure around him was too frightening.Assistant Wang felt that whenever his boss gets close to Miss Xin, the aura he gave off would be frightening. In the end, Assistant Wang himself will be the one to suffer.However, no matter how unwilling he was to suffer again, Assistant Wang relayed the message word by word to Chen Sinan.Chen Sinan sat on the swivel chair. He was holding his phone in one hand while flipping through the invitation with his other hand. Chen Sinan silently listened to Assistant Wang\u2019s report.Assistant Wang looked at Chen Sinan. He tried to guess his boss\u2019s feelings. Would he go or not? If his boss wants to go, then he will have to work hard to rearrange the important workload for his boss.Chen Sinan continued to stare at the invitation in his hand. He waved to tell his assistant to leave.Chen Sinan didn\u2019t confirm whether or not he would be attending.When Chen Sinan entered his office the next morning, he took off his suit jacket and said, \u201cBook me a ticket to A City.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Boss, please don\u2019t play like this! What\u2019s more, he didn\u2019t know when and where in A City the ceremony, for the completed construction of a school building, would be scheduled.Assistant Wang tried his best to appear like he wasn\u2019t about to fall apart. He calmed himself and asked, \u201cPresident Chen, when will the ceremony start for A College?\u201d\u201cIt will start at two o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u201dAssistant Wang said, \u201c\u2026I will book the flights immediately!\u201dIt will take two hours by plane to travel from Shengjin to A City. He also had to schedule some time for Chen Sinan to have lunch after getting off the plane. Therefore, Assistant Wang rushed to prepare everything and arrived at the airport at 9:30 in the morning with Chen Sinan.He will have to reschedule Chen Sinan\u2019s meeting with various executives and the collaborations with other companies.After Assistant Wang got on the plane, he looked at the boundless blue sky and felt his heart was a little tired.In the past, when his boss attended these opening ceremonies\u2026wait no, his boss had never attended this type of boring ceremony. He would never attend an opening ceremony in A City when the school didn\u2019t even have a strong relationship with him. The event will officially end after the dinner party concluded. Under normal circumstances, his boss would most likely leave after the opening ceremony.But because Miss Xin was here, it was hard for Assistant Wang to make the decision. Therefore, he forced himself to work up the courage to ask Chen Sinan. But right after he asked the question, he secretly scolded himself for being stupid. It doesn\u2019t matter whether or not Chen Sinan wanted to stay in a hotel. He could\u2019ve just booked a room, and if Chen Sinan didn\u2019t want to stay, he could just cancel it on President Chen\u2019s behalf. It was better than asking his boss such a worthless question.Chen Sinan didn\u2019t directly respond and just glanced at Assistant Wang. Assistant Wang felt that something was wrong, so he said, \u201cPresident Chen, I apologize.\u201dChen Sinan waved his hand. When he started walking, he said, \u201cBook a room.\u201dAssistant Wang was shocked; he wiped the sweat off his forehead. He took out his phone and called the secretary to book a room at a hotel.During lunch, Assistant Wang could see that Chen Sinan was absent-minded. Although he had seen through his boss, it didn\u2019t mean that he could say it out loud. It was getting late after eating. After the meal, Assistant Wang sent Chen Sinan to the hotel so he could wash up. Then, they went to A College.When they arrived at A College, Assistant Wang reported their names. He looked up and saw that the schoolgirls in charge of welcoming guests looked astonished. Their gaze enthusiastic as they stared at Chen Sinan.Chen Sinan had combed back the loose strands of his hair that were usually on his forehead. This exposed his full forehead, making his facial features appear to look even more refined. When it was coupled with his handsome face and soul-sucking eyes, even if he was dressed in simple black pants and a white shirt, it couldn\u2019t conceal his noble aura.His boss had always been very charming. It was very obvious as the ladies had all turned their heads to have a better look at him.When Assistant Wang saw that the girl still hadn\u2019t returned to her senses and that his boss was getting more impatient, he said, \u201cMay I ask which way is the opening ceremony is at?\u201d\u201cOh, please wait for a moment. I will ask another classmate to take you there.\u201d When she said that, she apologetically nodded at Chen Sinan.Assistant Wang didn\u2019t even need to look to know his boss didn\u2019t respond to her at all. However, in the next second, the classmate shouted, \u201cSiyue, you\u2019re heading to the new lab building, right? Why don\u2019t you help President Chen lead the way? After all, he came here to represent your school.\u201dWhen Xin Siyue was suddenly stopped by Gu Tong to lead the way for Chen Sinan, she inexplicably became frozen. She looked in the direction that Gu Tong was pointing at and a handsome white figure. The handsome white figure could be no one else but Chen Sinan!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why does she still see him even after she came to A City?Xin Siyue was trying to ignore Chen Sinan\u2019s scorching look as she pulled Gu Tong to the side. With her back to Chen Sinan, she said quietly, \u201cHey, why did you bother me for this?\u201dGu Tong didn\u2019t understand. Even though she had heard of the big shot Chen Sinan, why did Siyue appear to be avoiding him like the plague?Gu Tong examined her and asked in confusion, \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys go to the same school? I thought it would be best for you to show him around.\u201dXin Siyue shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m not acquainted with him. You take him.\u201d\u201cWhat about my job here?\u201d Gu Tong said bewildered.Xin Siyue said without thinking, \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cBut aren\u2019t you going over there to help too?\u201d\u201cThere should be enough time, come back right after you show him the way and I\u2019ll rush over.\u201dGu Tong didn\u2019t understand why Xin Siyue would rather go through such a complicated process, adding more work to both of them instead of bringing Chen Sinan over. But she thought she had already troubled Xin Siyue by making her help greet the guests, so she didn\u2019t want to reject her feelings. Then she turned and grinned sweetly, with an apologetic tone she said: \u201cMr. Chen, I\u2019m sorry, let me escort you.\u201dChen Sinan didn\u2019t look at her; his gaze was on Xin Siyue\u2019s graceful back. She was wearing the same outfit as the girl in front of him; a red knee-length cheongsam, a Chinese-style dress. It fit her body tightly, showing off her beautiful curves and graceful figure. The side-slit was quite high, but far from his view, her long and snowy thighs were intermittently visible.Chen Sinan\u2019s gaze deepened; as he lifted his chin, he said, \u201cI only want her to show me the way.\u201d Gu Tong was stupefied. What?Xing Siyue was also stupefied when she heard that.That f***! Nit picking!Gu Tong really didn\u2019t know what to do. She looked at Chen Sinan, who was only staring at Xin Siyue. Then she glanced at Xin Siyue, who was being stubborn and refusing to turn around. In the end, she could only look towards Assistant Wang for help.Assistant Wang was good at handling these situations, so he said to Xin Siyue politely \u201cSorry to bother Miss Xin to lead the way. Thank you.\u201dXin Siyue gritted her teeth. Anyone who wants to go can go; she\u2019s not going! Chen Sinan could stay here if he wanted to!Xin Siyue turned and was going to tell Gu Tong off, but after seeing Assistant Wang\u2019s appearance more clearly, she pointed at him and stuttered, \u201cYou\u2026\u2026Weren\u2019t you the person who brought me the porridge?\u201dXin Siyue looked at Assistant Wang. Assistant Wang looked at Chen Sinian and was a little speechless\u2026Yes, boss, we have been exposed.Following Assistant Wang\u2019s line of sight, Xin Siyue also looked at Chen Sinan. She can\u2019t help but ask, \u201cIsn\u2019t this your mom\u2019s assistant? Why is he with you?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s my assistant.\u201d Chen Sinan continued, \u201cWhy? Do you have any issues with that?\u201dXin Siyue gritted her teeth and glared at him!Yes!If Assistant Wang was his assistant, then why did he bring her breakfast? Also, why did he claim he was Weng Yinlin\u2019s assistant? What the hell was he doing?Seeing Xin Siyue getting angry, Chen Sinan finally felt more comfortable. He said kindly, \u201cWhat are you dissatisfied with, say it.\u201dXin Siyue said bluntly, \u201cI am very dissatisfied. Chen Sinan, what do you mean by this? He\u2019s your assistant, so why did you lie to me that he was your mom\u2019s assistant?\u201d\u201cIf I didn\u2019t lie, would you have eaten it?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d Xin Siyue swallowed her words. She could guess, without really thinking, that she most likely wouldn\u2019t have eaten the porridge if she knew it was him that had sent it. She just doesn\u2019t want any kind of unexplainable relationship with Chen Sinan. They have no relationship with each other, so why would he have other people deliver food to her? This makes it easier for others to misunderstand!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But Xin Siyue proudly and calmly gave herself an internal thumbs up. Luckily, she knew how the story would progress. She would be eliminated if she had any intentions towards Chen Sinan since she wasn\u2019t the female lead.Chen Sinan\u2019s deep gaze never left Xin Siyue for a moment. After seeing her reaction, he said confidently, \u201cI knew it.\u201dXin Siyue gritted her teeth, \u201cThen thank you for your previous kindness.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t feel your gratitude at all.\u201d He continued lazily, \u201cIs this the way that Miss Xin expresses her gratitude to others? It doesn\u2019t sound sincere in the least.\u201dXin Siyue immediately looked at him defensively, \u201cThen what do you want?\u201d\u201cLead the way,\u201d Chen Sinan said briefly.\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same if someone else guides you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone else, I only know you.\u201dXin Siyue thought that he was unreasonable. \u201cIt\u2019s only being a guide, does it matter who takes you there?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m not used to having a female stranger by my side.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d Xin Siyue looked at him, contemptuously, \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you bothered when there were so many women around you in the mall?\u201dChen Sinan smiled, \u201cI was just there to join in on the fun. How can you take that seriously?\u201dXin Siyue was pissed off by his frivolous attitude. She was sure that he did it on purpose. She tolerated him and asked, \u201cIf I guide you, does it offset the favor from last time?\u201dChen Sinan gave her a look saying, \u201cYou\u2019re so innocent.\u201d Then, responded passively, \u201cYou can ask Assistant Wang how troublesome it was for him to get you that porridge. If you think his hard work is only worth this much, then I think he\u2019s quite pitiful.\u201dStanding on the side, Assistant Wang beamed at his boss! In his eyes, Chen Sinan looked so manly at this time. He had never known his boss was this sweet. Not once has Assistant Wang complained to his boss about any matter, so how was Chen Sinan able to understand him so well? Even recognizing his hard work!Assistant Wang admired his boss and was thankful. The CEO was actually a person who was cold on the outside but warm on the inside!When Xin Siyue saw the expression in Assistant Wang\u2019s eyes, she was left speechless. She can\u2019t really say that he doesn\u2019t work hard enough\u2026Feeling reluctant, Xin Siyue gave up and said, \u201cI can bring you over. But once you are there, you cannot ask me for anything anymore. You can\u2019t pretend to be close to me.\u201dChen Sinan had some issues with her words, \u201cWe are close.\u201dXin Siyue was about to turn and tell Gu Tong, but after hearing that, she refuted him directly and without hesitation \u201cClose your *ss!\u201dOn the other side, Chen Sinan\u2019s face became like Bao Qingtian after he saw that she didn\u2019t take him seriously.(T/N: Bao Qingtian \u2013 Northern Song official renowned for his honesty)This was the first time that Assistant Wang had witnessed his boss being contradicted and not yelling back. He tried his best to hold back his laughter.Gu Tong heard their conversation from the start; the back-and-forth between Xing Siyue and Chen Sinan\u2019s conversation was shocking! How was Siyue not close with Chen Sinan! With this pace, they are clearly too close!\u201cGu Tong, I\u2019ll bring them over first, and I\u2019ll see you there.\u201dGu Tong still hadn\u2019t recovered from the shock. She grabbed Xin Siyue\u2019s hand quickly as she was about to leave, \u201cThink about how you\u2019re going to confess everything to us tonight, after this has finished.\u201d\u201cConfess what?\u201d Xin Siyue was confused.\u201cThe relationship between you and Chen Sinan!\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d Xin Siyue didn\u2019t think it was necessary to wait until tonight; she can clarify this with just one sentence \u2013 they have no relationship.Gu Tong seemed to know what she was about to say so she cut her off, \u201cDon\u2019t respond now, and don\u2019t think about fooling me.

She really wasn\u2019t trying to fool anyone, so what do they want her to say?While leading the way, Xin Siyue was deep in thought, so she didn\u2019t say a word. Of course, the most important reason for her silence was that she didn\u2019t want to talk to Chen Sinan.But Chen Sinan wanted to talk with her! Although he could see her walk quickly ahead without looking back, he couldn\u2019t help but glance at her back a couple of times. When he couldn\u2019t take it anymore, Chen Sinan finally lengthened his stride to walk up to her side.Assistant Wang saw the whole thing from the back, his eyes widening from shock; then he purposely put a little distance between the couple and himself. He had to pretend that he didn\u2019t see the boss\u2019s embarrassing moment.Xin Siyue noticed something unusual after walking a few steps, she looked at Chen Sinan out of the side of her eye and frowned, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dChen Sinan countered, \u201cHow are you going to answer your classmate\u2019s question?\u201d\u201cWhat question?\u201d Xing Siyue said without a care.Chen Sinan gaze deepened as he looked at her.Xin Siyue vaguely thought it might be that question concerning him. But that question doesn\u2019t even need any brain cells. She answered without thinking, \u201cI will tell the truth. You don\u2019t have to worry, this is not Shengjin City. I\u2019m not dumb enough to tie myself to you. Oh yeah, you also don\u2019t have to worry, I won\u2019t destroy your innocence.\u201dUpon hearing her words, Chen Sinan stopped and sneered, \u201cXin Siyue, do you know how you will meet your end?\u201dHearing him, Xin Siyue stopped and turned back to look at him in terror.Chen Sinan felt his emotions finally settle down, so he continued walking. While walking, he said, \u201cBecause of your obliviousness!\u201dXin Siyue rolled her eyes, she really wants to grab a brick and throw it on his head! Humph! Why are you so proud of yourself?I must tolerate him! Xin Siyue told herself to bear with it! She just needed to bring him to the lab building and then make a quick getaway.When they arrived at their destination, the principal came out to welcome Chen Sinan.When Xin Siyue saw Chen Sinan being surrounded by everyone, she withdrew quickly, while they were all clustered around him. She looked back at Chen Sinan cautiously during her escape, and thought, \u2018He\u2019s indeed the male lead. He always has the halo effect surrounding him. The author had to be his biological mother!\u2019While Xin Siyue was looking back, she wasn\u2019t paying attention to the path and almost hit the person in front of her. Good thing that this time she didn\u2019t throw herself on to someone\u2019s chest. Xia Qiao reacted quickly, holding on to her shoulder and moved her gently a little distance away.Xin Siyue realizing that she almost hit him again, apologized immediately, \u201cI forgot to pay attention to the path.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Xia Qiao said, smiling, \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the first time.\u201dXing Siyue felt awkward. The corners of her mouth curved into an apologetic smile, then she changed the topic and asked, \u201cIs it starting?\u201d\u201cWait for about 10 more minutes.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe two of them had already met in the library. After that encounter, they saw each other a few more times afterward. Xiao Qiao was easy to get along and fun to talk to. With all of that, the two of them gradually became closer.Xia Qiao examined her red Chinese-styled dress and praised, \u201cNot bad, very pretty.\u201dXin Siyue responded with a smile, \u201cThank you, I\u2019m still not used to it yet.\u201d\u201cIs it your first time wearing it?\u201d\u201cKind of.\u201d\u201cIf you have a chance, you should wear it more often. It looks very nice.\u201dXin Siyue smiled.Because the two of them had to do things afterward, they separated after talking for a bit.While searching for Xin Siyue\u2019s figure in the crowd, Chen Sinan saw Xin Siyue talking sweetly to Xia Qiao. He immediately narrowed his eyes. She had never shown him such a pure and sweet smile!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was so moved that he turned around to the leaders and said, \u201cYour esteemed school is home to quite the talent,\u201d though he was mainly commending Xia Qiao.Xin Siyue was that close with such a polite and attractive young man?Each guest attending the event was distinguished in one way or another, so Xia Qiao specifically had been asked to host. He didn\u2019t disappoint.The leaders were proud but dared not show it. \u201cWhy, president Chen, your school fosters much more talent than ours.\u201dChen Sinan decided not to exchange any more pleasantries. Instead, his gaze landed on Xin Siyue, who was bustling about on the right side of the hall. He couldn\u2019t understand why she was willing to do such menial tasks. It seemed like she was quite happy doing her work, her face flushed as she smiled.While Chen Sinan knitted his eyebrows, the ceremony came to a satisfactory close; moving on to a tour of the new building. Chen Sinan was initially not interested, but reluctantly joined when he saw Xin Siyue in the back of the line.Opposed to Xia Qiao\u2019s systematic and detailed presentation of the complex, Chen Sinan surveyed the building with a glance. He noted how ordinary it was before seeing even half of the structure.Chen Sinan didn\u2019t have the patience to waste time with people he found boring, so he began to slow down and settle to the back of the line.Assistant Wang knew very well that Chen Sinan had slowed on purpose and followed suit, despite his doubts. When he noticed that Xin Siyue was also in the back, he suddenly understood what his boss was playing at.Xin Siyue noticed Chen Sinan, and could only stare in alarm. As the tour reached a turn in the corridor, he quickly grabbed her wrist, pulling her away from everyone else.Xin Siyue wanted to scream, but Chen Sinan covered her mouth before she could. \u201cIf you want everyone to know about us, yell as much as you like!\u201d he hissed.Xin Siyue was angry. Who\u2019d want to be seen with him?\u201cMmph\u2026 MMMPHHH\u2026\u201dLet go!\u201cI can let go, but you have to do as I say and come with me.\u201d\u201cMmmph\u2026\u201dGo where?\u201cYou\u2019ll know when we get there.\u201dXin Siyue was reluctant.Chen Sinan suddenly laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to go with me. I\u2019ll ask your principal for permission instead. At least he will give me some respect\u2026\u201dIf she really let him do that, Xin Siyue believed it would be pointless to stay in A College anymore. She quickly nodded her head.Seeing that, Chen Sinan loosened his grip in satisfaction and led her by the hand all the way to the parking lot.Assistant Wang was now certain that Miss Xin would be the boss\u2019 wife. He respectfully opened the back door for them and, out of respect for their privacy, raised the partition between the front and back of the car.Xin Siyue urged Chen Sinan to loosen his grip. \u201cHey. You\u2019ve been grabbing my hand the entire time. Why aren\u2019t you letting go?\u201d Didn\u2019t he see how red her hand was?Chen Sinan let go, unwillingly. He didn\u2019t know what to say when he saw her wrist was so uncomfortably red. Why, when he didn\u2019t use much strength, was it like that?Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t care less about him. She decided to focus on the ride; but when she raised her head, only saw the partition instead of scenery. She couldn\u2019t help but worry. \u201cWhy is there a partition?\u201dChen Sinan took one last passing glance at her and decided not to comment. He closed his eyes to rest.\u201cWhat type of act is this?!\u201d Xin Siyue whispered to herself as Chen Sinan decided to doze off in front of her.The back of the car was cramped, and Chen Sinan had good ears. When he heard her comment, he reached over to pull her towards him.Xin Siyue had been shifting away at the moment, and she wasn\u2019t expecting him to suddenly move too. Somehow, she ended up stiffly throwing herself into him.As Xin Siyue landed on his solid chest, all she could think about was hitting him. But Chen Sinan was quicker and held her wrist in one hand, laying the other firmly on the back of her head. She was trapped in his embrace.Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t see his expression, so she wasn\u2019t sure what would be the best attitude or tone to take. She was in his arms, struggling to get out.Chen Sinan tightened his grip, ensuring she could only move her long slender legs. After floundering for one too many moments, she heard Chen Sinan say in a hoarse voice, \u201cIf you keep resisting, I won\u2019t be as forgiving to any trouble you cause this time.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In a relaxed tone, he replied, \u201cWhether I do or don\u2019t see \u2026\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of what will happen to your image when you say stuff like that?\u201d Xin Siyue threatened, wanting to slap his stupid face even more.Chen Sinan grabbed her hand and smiled. \u201cYou can\u2019t even control hands. It\u2019d be better if I tied them up.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201dXin Siyue increasingly felt like prey as her instinct to flee rose. She was a sheep waiting to be slaughtered. He caught both of her hands and even went so far as to seize control of her legs too. She couldn\u2019t escape even if she wanted to.\u201cChen Sinan, I\u2019m warning you! Let go of me!\u201d\u201cI can let go\u2026 but you need to answer a question first.\u201d\u201cWhy do you have so many questions?\u201dChen Sinan did, in fact, have a lot of questions. He looked intensely at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with that young man?\u201d\u201cWhat young man?\u201d The moment Xin Siyue asked, the color drained from Chen Sinan\u2019s face.\u201cIf you don\u2019t say his name, how will I know who it is?\u201d Xin Siyue asked bravely.\u201cSo you\u2019re saying there are lots of attractive young men that you talk to?\u201dXin Siyue was utterly speechless. \u201cHow do you always know?!\u201dChen Sinan pouted and quickly thought up a plan. He would eventually teach all of them a lesson, but Xia Qiao was first on the hit-list.\u201cSo you\u2019re pretty close with Xia Qiao?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019d say so.\u201d Xin Siyue responded nearly automatically. By the time she realized what she had said, she could see the roaring fires had been lit in Chen Sinan\u2019s eyes. He looked ready to slaughter someone.Xin Siyue was frightened and urgently tried to explain. \u201cNo, no, no! I\u2019m not that familiar with him. I\u2019ve only spoken to him a couple of times.\u201dChen Sinan observed her, trying to weigh the truth in her plea.Xin Siyue smiled sheepishly. \u201cI\u2019m honestly not close to him. Seriously!\u201dSeeing her state, she had no relations with the young man, he was satisfied. \u201cStay away from him.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Xin Siyue gave a half-hearted reply and wondered what the man in front of her was trying to pull. But it wasn\u2019t like she had agreed, either. After all, it was her right to talk to whomever she damn well pleased.As Chen Sinan observed her bright eyes hinting at the whirlwind of her thoughts, he knew that Xin Siyue was thinking of a way to go against him. He said, \u201cIf you\u2019re brave enough, keep on giving him mixed signals then.\u201dXin Siyue laughed. \u201cWho\u2019s the one sending mixed signals here? Forget Xia Qiao and me. Don\u2019t you see how strange the two of us are with each other? You know what they say, \u2018men and women should keep their distance.\u2019 Now let me go!\u201d\u201cMen and women should keep their distance? Didn\u2019t seem like you cared before when you were chasing after me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think of fooling me! Even if I did so in the past, I still never touched you,\u201d Xin Siyue quickly replied.\u201cYou seriously believe that?\u201d\u201cI just\u2026\u201d Xin Siyue could barely finish her sentence. She could feel how serious he was. \u201cSo, now what? You didn\u2019t lose your memory?\u201d Chen Sinan asked after a moment of earnest thought.Xin Siyue suddenly realized that she had divulged the wrong information. She racked her brain, trying to find a justification when her train of thought was interrupted. \u201cYou better explain properly.\u201dXin Siyue was enraged by his sharp gaze and struggled fiercely, gaining her freedom at last. She slipped to the leftmost side of the car, right by the window, gaining as much distance as she could from him.Chen Sinan\u2019s breathing became heavy, nearly furious with the way she avoided him like the plague. \u201cYou never lost your memory, did you? You were probably saying it all this time to save face.\u201dXin Siyue lowered her head and arranged the hem of her skirt. She smiled and said, \u201cYou can think whatever you\u2019d like. I mean, it doesn\u2019t affect me in any way. But Chen Sinan, I honestly hope that we won\u2019t have many chances to sit down and talk.\u201dChen Sinan stared at her, only to see that she met his gaze. \u201cYou have someone you like, and business to attend; why are you wasting both of our time? My wish has always been a simple one. I just want to live a quiet life. Even if it\u2019s impossible, couldn\u2019t you at least give me two years? Chen Sinan, I don\u2019t think we need to talk about why I came to A City again.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t come to A City anymore, Chen Sinan.\u201d Xin Siyue said her body full of determination.Chen Sinan looked deeply at her. \u201cAnd what if I still do?\u201dXin Siyue turned to look at him. She helplessly smiled. \u201cThen I can only bother my brother to send me to a school further from here.\u201dChen Sinan sighed deeply and let his incomparably heavy expression sink further.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - Nothing to MePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.70 Nothing to MeWhen the car once again stopped at the entrance of A College, Xin Siyue started to become confused.After making herself clear and saying what she wanted, Chen Sinan\u2019s demeanor had a hint of gloom. But what really surprised Xin Siyue was that he immediately told his assistant to turn the car around and send her back.Xin Siyue was puzzled. After causing all this trouble, what was he planning? She couldn\u2019t imagine what he was thinking at all.As the car came to a stop by the entrance, Chen Sinan simply observed Xin Siyue for a while. She was sitting near the window and staring into space as if nothing had happened. He didn\u2019t even know what she was thinking. As he watched her out of the corner of his eye, he couldn\u2019t help but feel restless. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Now you don\u2019t want to get out?\u201d he chided.\u201cHmm?\u201d Xin Siyue replied passively.Chen Sinan did his best to control his temper, allowing only a spark in his eyes as he said sarcastically, \u201cYou asked for all of this, so I hope you won\u2019t regret it later.\u201d\u201cWhat is there for me to regret?\u201d Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t resist the urge to smile.\u201cYou\u2019d better not.\u201c Chen Sinan spoke coldly. \u201cWhether or not I stay in A City, and how long I do stay is my choice. You have no right to interfere. You\u2019re nothing to me, Xin Siyue.\u201dXin Siyue looked at him without even blinking; then flashed another faint smile. Opening the door, she replied calmly, \u201cI never wanted to be anything to you.\u201dShe said it softly, but Chen Sinan still heard everything.Xin Siyue didn\u2019t turn back to see his expression. \u2018This man has issues!\u2019 she complained to herself as the car drove away.When she read the novel, her first impressions of each character was that they were all\u2026 unique, in their own way. But now that she was randomly involved in their world, she had come to realize that they were all much more eccentric than she ever would have expected!At first, she simply thought that the male lead was an imposing person. If she were to name her biggest problem with his character, it was probably that he was too heartless and too cruel in his approach to everything\u2026But at that moment, Xin Siyue thought he was extraordinary in a different sense. If she kept her distance, he\u2019d be unhappy, so he occasionally felt the need to appear in front of her simply to annoy her.What a pain!As she walked into her college, Xin Siyue prayed silently. \u201cPlease let him behave in a way that keeps everyone happy.\u201dHe was smart, and she had made herself very clear, so he would understand. Since he was young, a seemingly infinite stream of girls had fawned over him at every step. Though he sought her out nearly a dozen times, it was likely because he was only bored\u30fche wanted to find someone to entertain him. But Xin Siyue never thought she was special in any way, especially not in a way that would make him attracted to her.She earnestly prayed that they would never interact again.And on the way back, she prayed for Assistant Wang too.After she left, he was the one that would have to live with the storm brewing in his boss\u2019s expressionMeanwhile, Assistant Wang sarcastically thanked Ms. Xin in secret. His boss was a glacier, but she somehow managed to make him even colder. How could he survive until they arrived at Chen Sinan\u2019s abode?After some consideration, he asked, \u201cMr. Chen, shall we return to the hotel or\u30fc\u201dChen Sinan held his temper in, and coldly said, \u201cGo back to Shengjin City.\u201dAssistant Wang was so shocked that he talked aloud without a second thought. \u201cWeren\u2019t you planning to stay in City A for a few more days? And\u2026\u201dJust as Assistant Wang was about to begin his next sentence, his mouth sealed itself at the sight of Chen Sinan\u2019s eyes. He was being given a very clear warning.\u201cMy apologies, Mr. Chen. I spoke out of line,\u201d Assistant Wang hastily apologized.Chen Sinan didn\u2019t say anything, only pressing his lips together in response.Assistant Wang didn\u2019t dare speak anymore, but he was still curious. How could Mr. Chen simply leave? Was he going to forget Ms. Xin? Did he come all the way to A City just to briefly talk with her?Assistant Want had gone through the trouble of fixing his travel schedule, but it was all for naught. Assistant Wang held a moment of silence for himself, grieving at the thought of having to revise the schedule again.In her happiness, she decided to accompany Gu Tong back, and the two unexpectedly ran into Xia Qiao on the road.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just call me Xia Qiao.\u201dGu Tong smiled back. \u201cHow could I? Even though I couldn\u2019t experience your hosting talent today, I overheard many classmates and seniors who attended, and they were all complimenting you. \u2018Host Xia was on fire today! His talent never fails to shine\u30fcnot once! I don\u2019t even need to say how good he is!\u2019\u201dXia Qiao continued to smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d His eyes naturally shifted to Xin Siyue after he finished talking.Before Xin Siyue could even greet him, he said, \u201cWhen we were on the new building tour, I couldn\u2019t find you. I needed to ask you for a favor.\u201d\u201cWhat did you need help with?\u201d Xin Siyue recalled how she was practically dragged out by Chen Sinan, and because of that, she didn\u2019t know anything that happened.Xia Qiao shook his head and explained, \u201c It was nothing serious. Oh, one of the guests today was an alumnus from your school. Have you met yet?\u201dXin Siyue\u2019s hesitation showed in her eyes. She replied as she gave him an uncertain gaze. \u201cAre you talking about Chen Sinan?\u201dXia Qiao nodded. Though he hadn\u2019t seen clearly when he turned around, he was certain the figure dressed in red and white that flashed before him was Xin Siyue.When surveying the people who were still participating in the tour, he found that only Xin Siyue, Chen Sinan, and Chen Sinan\u2019s assistant were missing.Such suspicious activity made Xiao Qiao worry for Xin Siyue\u2019s safety, but he couldn\u2019t just leave midway. He was greatly relieved when he finally saw her again.At the same time, he was curious about Xin Siyue\u2019s relationship with Chen Sinan. But no matter how curious he was, he continuously reminded himself, it was Xin Siyue\u2019s right to associate with whomever she wanted in her private life. He had absolutely no right to ask her about anything.Upon mention of Chen Sinan, Xin Siyue quickly brightened her smile and replied, \u201cOh, he was just telling me he had to leave. Something urgent has come up, and he didn\u2019t want to bother everyone; instead, he asked me to show him the way out without attracting any attention.\u201d\u201cThat was all? Hmm, then you\u2019ve had a hard day.\u201d Xia Qiao smiled and spoke with a gentle tone. \u201cYou\u2019re probably tired from all the hard work today, you should go back and rest early.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Gu Tong replied, \u201cThank you for your thoughtfulness, Host Xia! You also had a busy day, so sleep early too!\u201dAfter saying their goodbyes to Xia Xiao, Gu Tong pulled Xin Siyue\u2019s arm and excitedly asked, \u201cWow Siyue! When did you become so close to Xia Qiao?\u201d\u201cWhat? We\u2019ve only run into each other at the library a few times. We talk for a bit whenever it happens,\u201d Xin Siyue replied.\u201cWow, that actually works? Looks like I need to go to the library with you more often!\u201d Gu Tong exclaimed.Xin Siyue was speechless. \u201cI called you every time I went, but you\u2019ve never responded like that. Now you\u2019re all gung-ho because you found out that your prince charming goes there too?\u201d\u201cWell, of course! The treasure is within our grasp! We need to march forward courageously!\u201d Gu Tong declared energetically. \u201cOh, the one and only Xia Qiao\u2026 he\u2019s so cute in that white shirt!\u201dXin Siyue didn\u2019t really pay attention to him. She replied, half-heartedly at best. \u201cHe\u2019s alright.\u201d\u201cThat reaction was so\u2026 underwhelming!\u201dXin Siyue laughed and said, \u201cWhat else do you want me to say?

It\u2019ll only be more painful the more you resist!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to confess\u201d\u30fcXin Siyue turned to look straight at her\u30fc\u201cbecause nothing is going on between us.

Alongside dance and piano, she signed up for English and French classes.The English classes were easy since she was quite good, to begin with, unlike French, where she had next to no experience.Xin Siyue made absolutely no plans to return home during the break, and she made a series of study plans that she kept a secret from the rest of her family. As expected, once they found out, each family member rejected them completely. It was only because they didn\u2019t want her to endure such hardship.Xin Siyue finally understood why the novel\u2019s supporting female failed so badly. The most fundamental reason was, most likely, because her family spoiled her rotten.Xin Siyue actually wanted to live the relaxed life of a daughter born into a wealthy family\u30fcthe kind that never did any chores, and only waited to be fed.However, whenever she remembered the unforgettable ending to her story, she was deterred from relaxing. She had to accomplish something that would be considered remarkable after graduation! It would be to her advantage that her family didn\u2019t collapse since it would only serve to pile onto her own troubles. Even if it were inevitable for her family would fall apart, if she had a job, she could at least take care of herself.Xin Siyue mulled over her predicament. \u201cIf you lean against a mountain, it will eventually fall. So if you rely on other people, they\u2019ll do the same to you. I need to work hard and rely on myself,\u201d she thought. She was still young, so enduring a bit more stress and working a bit harder wouldn\u2019t kill her.On the other hand, her parents relentlessly tried to dissuade her; even Xin Qiancheng disagreed. \u201cIf you want to learn those things, I can find you the best teachers in each field as long as you come home. It\u2019s simply improper for you to refuse to return for such a long break!\u201d\u201cTch! You know I don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d\u201cSo are you planning to stay there for the rest of your life?\u201d\u201cNot necessarily, but I\u2019ll see how it goes. Just let me do this! I\u2019ve already made up my mind, and I\u2019m accustomed to my new teacher\u2019s approach. Help me just one more time, and I promise I will visit them when I have the time!\u201d\u201cEnough nonsense. You\u2019re coming back!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not. If you keep trying to talk me out of it, I won\u2019t talk to you for a month after I arrive at home.\u201d\u201cDo you honestly think you can threaten me with that?\u201d Xin Qiancheng didn\u2019t fall for her trap.Xin Siyue decided to act even more shamelessly. \u201cThen I\u2019ll cry in front of mom every single day.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Xin Qiancheng couldn\u2019t find the words to express his disbelief. \u201cAre you still a kid?\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s why I want to make my own decisions and do things that I like. Just leave me be!\u201dAfter Xin Siyue\u2019s impressive persistence, her family eventually agreed. But they did remind her to take care of her health during her studies, to which Xin Siyue happily agreed.Time spent studying had always flown by quickly, especially now Xin Siyue no longer had time to care about anything else after a long day of school.Everything was going according to plan, until the end of August when a single phone call forced Xin Siyue to rush back to Shengjin City. Something critical had occurred; she had no choice, but to return immediately.As Xin Siyue listened to the message, she knew it was grave from the tone. She rushed home only to see Bai Ning and immediately knew what the emergency was. There was a birthday celebration for Chen Sinan\u2019s grandpa taking place soon, and the Chen family had sent an invitation to the Xin family. The grandpa\u2019s daughter-in-law\u30fcWeng Yinlin\u30fceven went so far as to make an individualized invitation for Xin Siyue, insistently asking her to attend.The moment Xin Siyue saw Weng Yinlin\u2019s name positioned right by hers on the golden invitation, a panicked torrent of thoughts rushed through her mind. \u201cOh my god! I\u2019m going to die, and it\u2019s because of my mom! Why didn\u2019t I just tell her the truth over the phone?! If I had, there\u2019d be absolutely no chance that I\u2019d be forced to come back!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(1)As night approached, the city lights shone brilliantly in the darkness.In particular, the Chens\u2019 villa was as bright as day due to Grandpa Chen\u2019s birthday celebration. In the bright, spacious banquet room, Weng Yinlin and Aunt Song were busy greeting the guests, while on the floor above, Grandpa Chen and Chen An\u30fcChen Sinan\u2019s father\u30fcmet with old friends whom they hadn\u2019t seen in ages.The spectacular lobby was filled with mingling guests. It was a truly magnificent display.After spending a few moments entertaining their guests, Weng Yinlin looked around for Chen Sinan without any luck. Just as she was about to call out for him, Chen Sinan suddenly appeared behind her.He had returned immediately after completing work for the day. After greeting a handful of the elderly guests, who were well-acquainted with the family, he made his way to Weng Yinlin. \u201cMom, where are dad and grandpa?\u201d he asked.Weng Yinlin nodded her head towards the floor above. \u201cOn the second floor, talking to your uncle.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Just as Chen Sinan was about to leave, Weng Yinlin pulled him back and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been at work for the whole day, go change into a new set of clothes first. Then go see your grandpa, because I have something important to announce.\u201d She smiled meaningfully, cluing her son in on the big news.Chen Sinan examined her expression, trying to guess what she would reveal during the banquet.After changing into fresh clothing, Chen Sinan arrived on the second floor only to find that all the guests had cleared the room. All that remained was Grandpa Chen, Chen An, and Weng Yinlin.\u201cHappy birthday, grandpa.\u201d Chen Sinan did his best to show his grandfather respect, which was considerably rare. He realized that he left his gift in his car, and was about to leave the room when Weng Yinlin stopped him. \u201cWait, Sinan. I\u2019d like to tell you something.\u201dChen Sinan turned to look at her.Weng Yinlin gave Grandpa Chen and Chen An a huge smile,, and said, \u201cDad, I\u2019m planning to use the party to introduce you to a girl.\u201d\u201cWhich family\u2019s child?\u201d Grandpa Chen asked.Chen Sinan watched Weng Yinlin silently. His gut already warning him that something was terribly wrong.And just after Chen Sinan had a slight premonition, he heard it come true. \u201cShe is the daughter of the Xin family\u30fcXin Siyue,\u201d she stated.Chen Sinan furrowed his brow as he heard that accursed name.Weng Yinlin didn\u2019t seem to notice the change in his expression and continued obliviously. \u201cI saw her right outside Sinan\u2019s apartment once, and she gave such a good first impression.\u201dAs she talked, Grandpa Chen and Chen An shifted their attention to Chen Sinan in near unison. \u201cThis could be the one,\u201d they thought after seeing his intense demeanor.\u201cI also traveled to A City two months ago and ran into her at a hospital. We kept each other company for the next few days, and\u2026 I really felt a connection to her. Dad, I\u2019d like to take her in as a goddaughter, as long as I have your blessing.\u201d After finishing, she turned straight over to Chen Sinan and said, \u201cYou know, I always wished for a daughter. Who would\u2019ve thought that I\u2019d have a troublesome son instead? She\u2019s quite easy to get along with, so I imagine you\u2019ll come to like her too when you meet.\u201d\u201cWhat do you guys think? Dad?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Chen Sinan answered. He did so before the two that were asked even had a chance to respond.Both Grandpa Chen and Chen An\u2019s eyes flashed with anger at Chen Sinan\u2019s outright refusal and blatant display of disrespect. \u201cWhat\u2019s the reason for such an answer?\u201d Grandpa Chen asked with a grave tone and a deep voice.Chen Sinan had no expression and kept quiet, despite Grandpa Chen\u2019s question still hanging in the air.Weng Yinlin pretended to be shocked. \u201cBut last time you returned from A City, you said that there wasn\u2019t anything special going on between you two! You\u2019re not a couple, and I want to take her as a goddaughter\u30fcyou don\u2019t have anything to lose. And you even get a sister out of this!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not fit to be my sister.\u201d\u201cThen what is she fit to be? Your girlfriend?\u201d Weng Yinlin teased, not once forgetting to smile.It was only then that Chen Sinan realized\u30fchis mother was digging another hole for him to jump into.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(2)\u201cI don\u2019t agree with this. That\u2019s all. Mom, if you want it so badly, then do what you like, but I\u2019m not suddenly going to say that I have a sister. It doesn\u2019t matter who she is.\u201d Chen Sinan went straight down to get his gift to silence Weng Yinlin.It wasn\u2019t as though the two were bound by blood, so there was absolutely no point having them act as siblings in some stupid game of house.Chen Sinan couldn\u2019t entirely hide his agitation as he went downstairs, and when Mao Shiyuan saw him, he was confused. \u201cWhat made your face like that? Did someone rub you the wrong way?\u201d he asked.Chen Sinan calmed himself and replied. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m just going to the garage to get something. Are you coming?\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d The casual reply made Mao Shiyuan instantly feel at ease.The two of them conversed over a few job-related topics on the way, when Mao Shiyuan suddenly declared, \u201cI just saw Xin Qiancheng.\u201dChen Sinan and Xin Qiancheng\u2019s companies had been engaged in a tense bidding war the month before, which Chen Sinan ultimately won with a slight advantage. Since then, Mao Shiyuan had come to know Xin Qiancheng quite well.Upon mention of the name, Chen Sinan responded nonchalantly with a simple \u201cokay.\u201dMao Shiyuan was still curious, though. \u201cDid Grandpa Chen invite him to his previous birthday celebrations as well? How come I\u2019ve never seen him?\u201dChen Sinan knew the reason for his question all too well. The Xin family was deliberately invited by his mother.After returning to the lobby, he saw, as if on cue, a tall figure next to Chen An. Who else could it be other than Xin Qiancheng?Mao Shiyuan saw him too, noting how the members from both families appeared to be conversing quite intimately. He elbowed Chen Sinan and discreetly asked, \u201cWhen did Aunt and Uncle become so acquainted with the Xin family?\u201dChen Sinan shot a glance at Mao Shiyuan from just the corner of his eyes. \u201cHow would I know?\u201d There was no way he could know what his mother was planning anymore.Despite the presence of the Xin family, Chen Sinan couldn\u2019t spot Xin Siyue anywhere.She didn\u2019t come?Chen Sinan approached and heard Xin Qiancheng saying in an apologetic tone, \u201cSiyue is also very sorry. She wanted nothing more but to come to congratulate Grandpa Chen, but she was feeling unwell in every sense of the word. We insisted that she get enough rest, so she, unfortunately, won\u2019t be attending today. But when she recovers in a few days, we\u2019ll be sure to bring her for a visit.\u201dAs the Chen family members listened to the apology, they also began to notice Chen Sinan\u2019s demeanor.Chen Sinan showed no emotion, but he could still feel Xin Qiancheng and his parents\u2019 gazes trying to look through him and see what he was thinking. What he was feeling. All he was thinking was a single question. \u201cHas she still not come back? Or is she avoiding me?\u201dHe stopped this train of thought quickly and reprimanded himself for even starting it. There was no point defending her actions with contrived excuses. Whether or not she wanted to come, or if she came at all, had nothing much to do with him. As for the severity of her illness, if her family knew, then they wouldn\u2019t sit around doing nothing.There was absolutely no need for him to worry.Weng Yinlin was the first to become uncomfortable with the silence, which had stolen into the conversation for a few seconds. \u201cThat\u2019s so unfortunate, but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. Siyue did return, right?\u201d she replied regretfully.In turn, Bai Ning replied with a smile. \u201cYes, she just arrived this afternoon.\u201d\u201cPerfect! Tell her that whenever she has the time, she should come by. Our entire family will welcome her with open arms. Right, Sinan?\u201d After the mention of her son, Weng Yinlin realized that she had never formally introduced him, and hastily motioned towards him. \u201cMr. Xin, Mrs. Xin, this is my unremarkable rascal of a son, Chen Sinan.\u201dXin Jin obviously knew about Chen Sinan but played along with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re much too modest, Mrs. Chen. You say your son is unremarkable, but I\u2019d wager our Qiancheng is even more useless.\u201dXin Qiancheng and Chen Sinan shared a quick sympathetic glance as the conversation took an irritating but inevitable turn, before calmly ignoring their families.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He walked to Chen Sinan\u2019s side, which for once was unaccompanied, as he was finally free of the banquet\u2019s guests. He confidently balanced a glass of red wine between his fingers and spoke casually. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201dChen Sinan had his back turned right until the moment he heard Xin Qiancheng\u2019s question. He turned to face Xin Qiancheng, and\u30fcwith an equally relaxed tone\u30fcasked, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cUsing every trick up your sleeve to make my sister return from A City\u2026 After all that, you\u2019d have me believe the Chen family isn\u2019t planning something?\u201d If Xin Qiancheng had been on guard sooner, he never would have let Xin Siyue rush back.\u201cHeh,\u201d Chen Sinan scoffed. But he didn\u2019t deny a thing. \u201cYou are implying the Chen family has some ulterior motive but, in the time you have spent here have you found any confirmation?\u201dXin Qiancheng had on the edge the whole night but couldn\u2019t find any proof. This was why he wanted to test Chen Sinan personally.But how could Chen Sinan go easy for him?\u201cDon\u2019t be so suspicious of people,\u201d Chen Sinan suggested.\u201cYou can never be too careful; particularly where you can get hurt being careless. This goes doubly for you and your family,\u201d Xin Qiancheng replied bluntly.\u201cI won\u2019t try to convince you.\u201d Chen Sinan chose not to express his opinions.Xin Qiancheng examined him carefully but gave up after realizing that Chen Sinan would never give anything away. He began to fear if he was overly sensitive; but if there truly was no other meaning behind the invitation, why would the Xin family have received one so suddenly in the first place? The two families never maintained any sort of contact, but Weng Yinlin had acted so amicably, it was as if she was talking to old friends. She also wouldn\u2019t stop talking to his mother about Xin Siyue.Xin Qiancheng\u2019s ponderings over the special invitation eventually resulted in worry for his sister. Was it because Weng Yinlin, for an assortment of reasons, had her eye on Siyue? The party appeared normal, but was that because Siyue never came?The more he thought, the more convinced he was. Reaching a satisfying conclusion, he rejoiced. It was incredibly fortunate that Siyue couldn\u2019t attend due to her sickness. Otherwise, he would have had to guard against all of the Chen family\u2019s tricks!Meanwhile, Xin Siyue was lying on her bed with her hands clenched on her stomach. She had been tossing and turning all night but hadn\u2019t managed to find a comfortable position.She lay silently in bed, with nothing but her period to keep her company.She was fine when she had arrived in A City; but perhaps due to learning about the invitation and the sudden wave of anxiety that washed over her, her normally tame period woke like a beast anew. Her face unnaturally pale, reflected her pain. She had also lost the strength to walk, so there was no way to attend a party.Xin Siyue stayed in bed since she didn\u2019t have the strength for much else, and informed Bai Ning that she couldn\u2019t go.Bai Ning cooked brown sugar water for her, but to no avail. She saw that Xin Siyue was hopelessly ill, and her complexion stayed deathly white despite Bai Ning\u2019s efforts. \u201cRest well. I\u2019ll tell the Chen family,\u201d she assured Xin Siyue.\u201cOkay.\u201d That was exactly what Xin Siyue wanted. Though her period was essentially torture, it came at just the right time. She didn\u2019t even have to find an excuse to avoid attending.After Xin Siyue leisurely recuperated at home for a couple of days, she received another invitation. It wasn\u2019t as frightening as the first one\u30fcZhong Qin was asking her out for a coffee since they hadn\u2019t seen each other for such a long time.If they didn\u2019t meet now, once school started, they\u2019d most likely have to wait much longer.Xin Siyue planned not to return until winter break, so she agreed readily. \u201cOkay, send me the place and time.\u201dWhen Xin Siyue finally left the house, she not only heard a load of gossip by accident but met a certain someone as well\u2026Oh, how fate works in mysterious ways.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For the whole trip, she basically assumed the role of a personal assistant. She helped Zhong Qin carry bags, pick out clothes, and gave advice where she saw fit.Zhong Qin bought a heaping pile of clothes, and as the two of them leisurely strolled around with their arms locked together, she enthusiastically offered to treat Xin Siyue to a meal for her help. \u201cSure,\u201d Xin Siyue replied. She agreed without hesitation.Zhong Qin brought her to a Western steakhouse and made small talk as they waited for their orders to arrive. Zhong Qin smiled and commented, \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were coming back for the summer.\u201dXin Siyue took a sip of water before replying, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to come back, but I was deceived.\u201d\u201cBy who?\u201dXin Siyue thought of Weng Yinlin and Bai Ning. She shook her head helplessly and sighed. \u201cNever mind, the story would take way too long to tell.\u201dZhong Qin raised her head and saw two women entering. One of them was wearing jean shorts and a white tank top and had just taken off her sunglasses. Zhong Quin was planning to ask Xin Siyue what she had been up to recently, but she stopped to examine the woman whose sunglasses were taken off. She leaned over the table towards Xin Siyue, and said in a hushed tone, \u201cLook over there. Isn\u2019t that girl in the jean shorts next to Ms. Lai from our school? She looks so familiar\u2026 I feel like I\u2019ve seen her at school before.\u201dXin Siyue followed Zhong Qin\u2019s gaze, and also saw the two young women. She thought the one that Zhong Qin had alerted her to was only trying to show off with those shorts. The other woman, however, had long hair and wore a light purple dress. It was obvious that she was from a respectable family.Ms. Lai?Xin Siyue took a moment to recall if she knew either of the two, but couldn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t even know them. Who\u2019s Ms. Lai?\u201d she asked in reply.Zhong Qin saw the two women, who didn\u2019t pay any attention to them, walk to the left side of the table. \u201cYou don\u2019t know about Ms. Lai and Chen Sinan?\u201d she asked.\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cThe incident and its fallout were both so bad that I thought for sure you\u2019d have heard! I tried not to mention it since I was afraid you\u2019d get all depressed if I brought it up!\u201d Zhong Qin said with disbelief.Realizing this gossip was about Chen Sinan, Xin Siyue immediately lost interest. \u201cSince you\u2019re so concerned for me, then don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d she said. It would be better if she didn\u2019t know.\u201cNo no no, don\u2019t be like that! I\u2019ll tell you. Know both yourself and your opponent, so that you may taste victory in every battle!\u201d Zhong Qin declared confidently. \u201cNear the end of June, an entertainment company exposed a bunch of tabloid-worthy pictures of Chen Sinan. In them, there was one of him and yours truly over there\u30fcMs. Lai\u30fc embracing intimately! The media went totally nuts over it, especially since it was Chen Sinan\u2019s first time ever exposing that kind of relationship with a woman to the public.That picture was evidence, but in less than three hours, he managed to silence all the news about it. The head of the company responsible for the leak even released a public apology to Chen Sinan at the event, saying that he shouldn\u2019t have stirred up such trouble over nonsense. Soon after, Chen\u2019s PR department clarified on a post that Chen Sinan had absolutely no relationship with Ms. Lai and that they would be pursuing legal action.Xin Siyue listened to Zhong Qin intently, and remarked, \u201cThat neat freak germaphobe probably took it pretty badly.\u201d Just thinking of Chen Sinan\u2019s disgusted face was satisfying. Not bad at all.\u201cAre you not curious about them?\u201d Zhong Qin was stupefied.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be curious about?\u201d\u201cIf they\u2019re really in a relationship or not.\u201d Zhong Qin was getting impatient.\u201cDidn\u2019t Chen Sinan himself say that they\u2019re not?\u201d Xin Siyue replied.\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to believe him, just like that?\u201dXin Siyue was speechless. The reason she believed him was because she knew that Chen Sinan only had a relationship with Sheng Wenyang! Every other female character slipped away like morning dew into the earth. When all was said and done, they were worthless to him and powerless against their fate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

While Zhong Qin cut into her steak, she suddenly exclaimed, \u201cI finally remembered her! Do you know the girl that was with Ms. Lai? That was Shi Shi! The Shi Shi\u30fc from the art department!\u201d\u201cShi Shi?\u201d Xin Siyue said the name, and her eyes gradually widened with shock.\u201cYeah, Shi Shi. The young miss from the Shi family. I\u2019ve heard her reputation at school wasn\u2019t very good.\u201d\u201cSo her last name is Shi.\u201d Xin Siyue suddenly remembered that the girl had also appeared in the novel once or twice. Shi Shi was a supporting female character, and Chen Sinan had disliked her so much he often made trouble for her.She clearly remembered when she teleported, she heard a girl blurt out that Shi Shi was the one who pushed her down the stairs.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be her.\u201dXin Siyue was always an eye for an eye kind of person, but she hadn\u2019t put much thought into how she\u2019d get her revenge. To start, she wasn\u2019t terribly experienced.Zhong Qin observed how deep in thought Xin Siyue was, and asked, \u201cYou guys know each other?\u201d\u201cWe have a bit of a\u2026 complex relationship,\u201d Xin Siyue explained as she stood up. \u201cEat first. I need to go to the washroom.\u201dXin Siyue wasn\u2019t even planning on dealing with Shi Shi, yet she had already run into her. Just after leaving the washroom, she spotted Shi Shi leaning against the wall by the entrance. Shi Shi was waiting for her. \u201cI never would\u2019ve thought I\u2019d see the Xin family\u2019s bitch ever again in Shengjin City, but now I\u2019ve had the misfortune of actually seeing you again.\u201d Shi Shi said the minute she saw Xin Siyue emerge from the bathroom.After a long stretch of silence, the lack of reply from Xin Siyue made the interaction deeply unsettling. Shi Shi looked over at her and met her gaze directly. \u201cLooks like you really did lose your memory. Don\u2019t remember who I am? I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m Shi Shi\u30fcthe one that made you fall down the stairs.\u201dSlap!Just as Shi Shi finished, she was struck cleanly across the face by Xin Siyue.Xin Siyue felt the residual sting in her palm when she retracted her hand.It was her first time ever slapping someone, but it was a pleasure unlike any other.Xin Siyue smiled, looking at Shi Shi\u2019s reddened face and smirked at how ridiculous she looked. \u201cYeah, I did lose my memory, but thanks for reminding me. Your last name is Shi, right? I\u2019ll make sure to return the pain twice over,\u201d she said smugly.\u201cDon\u2019t get too full of yourself, Xin Siyue!\u201c Shi Shi screamed. She threw herself towards Xin Siyue like a wild creature but never reached her target. Xin Siyue nimbly dodged, while also managing to take hold of Shi Shi\u2019s wrist. She twisted her body sideways and moved behind Shi Shi, locking Shi Shi\u2019s arm behind her back, and slamming her against the wall.Shi Shi squirmed with a newfound terror as she was pinned. \u201cYou\u2019re not Xin Siyue! She doesn\u2019t know these kinds of moves! Who are you?! Let go of me!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be concerned over who I am. All you need to care about is that you\u2019re in my debt for as long as you live. And if you want me to let you go, it\u2019ll be easy enough to convince me to. Watch that mouth of yours next time, or if I\u2019m not in a good mood, I just might decide to throw you off the side of a building. Have you ever seen the fluids that trickle out of a crushed skull?\u201d\u30fcXin Siyue leaned in so close that her warm breath teased Shi Shi\u2019s ear\u30fc\u201cThe sight is absolutely beautiful.\u201d She relished every single syllable of her threat.\u201cXin Siyue, you fucking bitch!\u201dXin Siyue twisted Shi Shi\u2019s wrist further, making her screech in pain. \u201cLet go! Now!\u201d\u201dIf I hear you say another word, I\u2019ll make sure you pay up everything you owe me. Everything. From then, till now.\u201d Xin Siyue threw her away with disgust and shot a final abhorrent glare before leaving.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You probably know the person who was with me. Even though Chen Sinan made her deny the rumors, my cousin is still dating him. She\u2019s shared meals with him before and can enter the Chen residence freely. Grandpa Chen likes her so much, she\u2019ll be the one to marry Chen Sinan sooner or later.\u201dXin Siyue didn\u2019t want to listen to Shi Shi anymore, but could still hear her eagerly chirping. \u201cEven if Chen Sinan doesn\u2019t marry my cousin, there\u2019s still Senior Sheng, so you\u2019ll never get the chance!\u201dXin Siyue laughed at the comment, continuing to turn away from her.Who Chen Sinan would be with had nothing to do with her.Xin Siyue returned and saw that Zhong Qin had finished eating, so she asked, \u201cShall we go?\u201d\u201cHmm, sure.\u201d Zhong Qin didn\u2019t really have any objections. On the way, she asked, \u201cDid you run into any more trouble with Shi Shi? I saw her also go to the bathroom right after you left, and she was shooting serious daggers at you.\u201d\u201cWell, we do have some issues with each other.\u201d Xin Siyue replied.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t really explain since I don\u2019t even understand it myself.\u201dWhat Xin Siyue could figure out, was that the two of them had started fighting over Chen Sinan. In the past, Shi Shi wasn\u2019t happy about her being with Chen Sinan all day, and there was probably a point where she just couldn\u2019t take Shi Shi\u2019s provocations anymore. She still never remembered the moment when Shi Shi pushed her down the stairs in the novel. Her character was always bouncing around so energetically, so there were barely any scenes that described her injuries. What went wrong in the storyline?Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t wrap her head around it, but she had the feeling that she couldn\u2019t just let Shi Shi do as she pleased. Shi Shi would probably act out even more in the future, and if Xin Siyue had someone who thought of her as an enemy, how would she ever live a regular life with someone always causing trouble for her?The new development only reinforced the thought that constantly haunted her: Shengjin City wasn\u2019t right for her. Xin Siyue went back to A City the following day.Xin Qiancheng drove her to the airport and reminded her to take care of herself, but kept the goodbyes short as he had to rush back for a business meeting. While waiting in the airport lounge, Xin Siyue looked around only to see Assistant Wang in a black shirt. She froze for a beat before looking away, trying to minimize her presence.Nearly 99% of the time, wherever Assistant Wang went, Chen Sinan would be. She couldn\u2019t afford to be careless.Assistant Wang, unfortunately, saw her too, and nearly stumbled before maintaining his stride. He looked worriedly at his boss on his left.This felt like it, almost, wasn\u2019t a mere coincidence. Had the two planned to board the same flight beforehand?Assistant Wang was so obvious that something was wrong, Chen Sinan could tell almost straight away. \u201cWhat\u2019s with that look?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u30fcAssistant Wang pointed to Xin Siyue\u2019s direction\u30fc, \u201cMs. Xin is also here.\u201dChen Sinan\u2019s turned to where Assistant Wang pointed; sunlight shone through the window and brightened the surroundings. In the rambunctious airport lounge, Xin Siyue was sitting alone in a chair near the aisle, wearing headphones and quietly staring at her phone. She was completely unaware of her surroundings.Chen Sinan\u2019s sight lingered a bit longer. Noticing Xin Siyue seemed to have never looked away from her screen, he allowed a faint smile to curl his lips.Xin Siyue held her breath for the longest time, and finally, let out a sigh of relief after she felt Chen Sinan\u2019s gaze on her disappear.What kind of coincidence was this, meeting again?Xin Siyue heard the boarding announcement, and caught them mentioning Country M. Wasn\u2019t Sheng Wenyang there too? So it was sort of like \u201ctraveling a thousand miles to attend a date\u201d!Xin Siyue didn\u2019t spend much time thinking about it. After returning to A City, she was busy with life as usual and became even busier after school started.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the competition, one must show off their talent. There were two options for the competition; piano and dance. After consideration, she chose dance. When her dance teacher found out that she was participating in her school\u2019s host competition, her dance teacher had personally adapted a piece of ancient dance music for her.At the end of September, Xin Siyue\u2019s performance can be described as exemplary during the host competition. A lot of people praised her performance as catching their attention: whether it be her facial expressions, body language, or tone, all of these things made the audience feel at ease. Her language expressions and improvisational performance especially made her stand out from all the other participants.Xin Siyue was gratified. Before she had transmigrated, she had already been practicing for this profession in secret because she loved it. Now that the environment she was in allowed her to learn it without restrictions, she became even more motivated to improve and was satisfied with the results.But for the amateurs, what caught their attention was Xin Siyue\u2019s dance and her light pink long flowing silk inner sleeves. Her dance moves flowed smoothly, showing both strength and gracefulness in her motions. The onlookers can sense not only the profoundness of her dance, but also the sentiments of the song by her body language and facial expressions.In other words, it was amazing.Even Gu Tong, who was quite close to her commented in shock, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know that your dancing skill was this good!\u201dGu Tong inquired after her backstage after Xin Siyue finished her performance.She also felt that she had performed well. This was the first time she was so deeply immersed into this song since she first learned it, so she answered breathlessly with a smile, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about!\u201dAfter seeing her smile, Xia Qiao, the host of the show, can\u2019t help but freeze for a few seconds. He didn\u2019t want to admit that Xin Siyue was the only person who was able to surprise him out of all the events he hosted. He can feel her confidence, as well as her effort and beauty while she was dancing. He had to admit that he wanted to pay more attention to her and uncover the other secrets she was hiding.Xin Siyue\u2019s classmates in Shengjin City were also amazed by her. Some students from A College posted some clips of the highlights of the competition onto the school\u2019s official website, but many other students demanded that they only wanted to see Xin Siyue\u2019s dance videos.As a result, after the videos were posted, there were considerable views, and the news of it had spread back to Xin Siyue\u2019s school.Zhong Qin complimented her right after he saw it on the web forum, \u201cThat was amazing! You were extremely beautiful!\u201dXin Siyue was just about to accept his compliment when Zhong Qin continued, \u201cIf Senior Chen saw it, will he regret that he didn\u2019t accept your pursuit? The more I look at you, the more beautiful you look!\u201dThe original bright smile on Xin Siyue\u2019s face froze on her after she heard him mentioned that Chen person, \u201cZhong Qin, did you do that on purpose?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Xin Siyue didn\u2019t want to bring Chen Sinan up.Naturally, she became busier as she joined the school\u2019s hosting team for the new semester; she was as busy as a spinning top during the first month of host training.At the end of November, she started to officially host events. As expected, she received considerable praise.During the New Year evening party, out of the four hosts, she and Xia Qiao had shown great chemistry together while hosting. Some students even gossiped about it; they would be a golden couple and a good match.Xin Siyue didn\u2019t bother to care for those comments, but after reading the comments she realized that she had more contact with Xia Qiao because of this job. As finals week was approaching, she was too busy studying for the tests, so she didn\u2019t think more about it.During the winter break, Xin Siyue stayed in City A for half a month using the excuse of studying. However, she was urged by the Xin Family to return home for the Spring Festival.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You just arrived yesterday, and tomorrow will be New Year\u2019s Eve already.\u201dXin Siyue coaxed her, \u201cMom, don\u2019t get mad. I\u2019ll stay a few days extra after the New Year ends.\u201dBai Ning agreed reluctantly, \u201cYou can\u2019t go back so early after New Year.\u201d\u201cFine, fine, fine.\u201d Xin Siyue agreed orally, but she was already planning the best day to leave. She really thought that A City was good in every way, at least there was no one from the book in A City. Since there was no one there, she didn\u2019t have to worry too much. It also gave her the chance to be herself without any restrictions.She was worried about staying in Shengjin City for too long. Xin Siyue was one of the important characters that would carry the plot forward, so she was scared that the longer she stayed, the greater the chance that the plot will follow the storyline. She didn\u2019t want all her efforts to be in vain if the ending will be the same as it was in the original book, or else, it would be more than just \u201ctragic\u201d.While she was lost in her train of thought, she was pulled back to the present when she heard someone call out, \u201cSiyue!\u201dXin Siyue turned to look back and saw Ji Yi, who was wearing a black sweater, staring at her excitedly, \u201cXin Siyue, you\u2019re back? I thought I wouldn\u2019t see you again until your graduation ceremony!\u201dXin Siyue never considered him to be an acquaintance, so she found the way he spoke so familiar to her to be inappropriate. As a result, she replied expressionlessly, \u201cThat\u2019s also possible.\u201dJi Yi didn\u2019t care about her coldness, and continued, \u201cI saw your dance video at A College, you were great! I told you that your dance would amaze everyone last time, but no matter what, you refused to join the competition. Now, doesn\u2019t the result of host competition prove my words?\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d\u201cXin Siyue, I just happened to invite a lot of my classmates to a party. Do you want to go together? They all know about you too\u2026\u201dXin Siyue laughed sarcastically on the inside, thinking that her brain must have problems if she accepted the invitation. \u201cThey know about me, but I don\u2019t know about them, so what\u2019s the point of me going?\u201d\u201cTo meet each other, and even if you don\u2019t know them, you\u2019ll be acquainted afterwards.\u201d Ji Yi said candidly.Xin Siyue rolled her eyes at him.Coincidentally, Bai Ning yelled her name while she was picking fruits. Xin Siyue responded to her mother that she was coming before she said to Ji Yi hastily, \u201cThank you for your kindness, but I\u2019m not going. Bye.\u201d\u201cHey, Xin Siyue!\u201dAfter Xin Siyue ran a few steps, she turned around immediately and said, \u201cDon\u2019t follow me!\u201dJi Yi was stupefied, why did she become so hostile after coming back from City A?The more he thought about it, the more he thought that Xin Siyue was heartless. He even called Mao Shiyuan to complain, \u201cI told you she\u2019s not suitable for Senior Chen, I\u2019m smart enough to tell!\u201dAfter Mao Shiyuan finished listening to Ji Yi\u2019s long complaint, he waited for him to take a break before Mao Shiyuan replied, \u201cEh, who told you to provoke her? Why would she go to your class reunion when she\u2019s not even familiar with you? She doesn\u2019t even know your classmates; it\u2019s going to be awkward if she went.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all because Senior Chen isn\u2019t going. If Senior Chen went, she would immediately agree to go! Senior Mao, you don\u2019t understand Xin Siyue.\u201dMao Shiyuan scoffed at him and said, \u201cLike you know a lot about her.\u201d After he finished speaking, he hung up the phone because he didn\u2019t want to talk to him anymore.Chen Sinan heard the last sentence when he walked into Mao Shiyuan\u2019s office, but he didn\u2019t ask. The two of them discussed work as usual. After they finished discussing, Mao Shiyuan finally asked, \u201cAre you still not planning to let me take a break for the New Year?\u201d\u201cYou want to have a break?\u201d Chen Sinan lifted his eyes to look at him.Mao Shiyuan nodded.\u201cSure,\u201d Chen Sinan said generously.Mao Shiyuan felt his spirits finally return to him after he heard Chen Sinan\u2019s reply. He had been forced to work overtime while other employees left for break, so he had to take care of all the leftover tasks. Mao Shiyuan hadn\u2019t slept well in such a long time.After he thought of Chen Sinan\u2019s inconsiderate orders, he said suddenly, \u201cJi Yi said there\u2019s a class reunion today. It\u2019s still pretty early, do you want to go have some fun?\u201d\u201cYou can go, I\u2019m not going. I have to go back to my grandpa\u2019s place later.\u201dMao Shiyuan already predicted his lack of interest in these kinds of events. He thought of Ji Yi\u2019s words and examined Chen Sinan\u2019s expression as he meaningfully said, \u201cJi Yi said he saw Xin Siyue in the mall.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you are going, would Xin Siyue agree to go too?\u201dChen Sinan slowly lifted his eyes and glanced at him, \u201cI think you are too idle. How about spending a little time and finish the project proposal?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no! I won\u2019t mention it anymore. CEO Chen, please let me go\u201d\u201cHumph.\u201d Chen Sinan contemplated about it while he was on the way home, but he still drove back to his old house.Since she didn\u2019t want to see him, why should he go meet her?After the encounter with Ji Yi, Xin Siyue became even more defensive. Now, she couldn\u2019t even go out of her house on New Year\u2019s. She also realized on the night of New Year\u2019s Eve, that there was no Chinese New Year special*! How sinful!(T/N: Chinese New Year special: It\u2019s a beautiful annual TV show that celebrates Chinese New Year where participants would sing and dance)She asked Xin Qiancheng, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to watch the Chinese New Year special?\u201d\u201cWhat Chinese New Year special?\u201d Xin Qiancheng asked in confusion.The next second, she became the stupid one.Xin Siyue was speechless. How can the author of this book not write about the Chinese New Year special? She was bored of staying at home! Her parents asked her to visit their relatives and friend\u2019s house with them to wish them a happy new year, but she refused.She didn\u2019t want to go out at all. Bai Ning even suggested that she should visit the Chen Family since Weng Yinlin invited Xin Siyue last time, but she brushed off the advice. Bai Ning was still reluctant about it; she was afraid that the Chen family will think that Xin Siyue had no manners.Compared to Chen Sinan, Xin Siyue thought that everything else was less important. \u2018Manners? Not important!\u2019 No matter what, she won\u2019t go, she couldn\u2019t go, and definitely would not go!So, when Chen Sinan was welcoming the Xin parents, he was extremely angry\u2013 \u2018Xin Siyue, you are ruthless.\u2019Xin Siyue rushed back to City A after staying home for a few days. Even until the end of summer vacation, she didn\u2019t go back to Shengjin City again.Xia Qiao was recommended by the school to the TV station in College A during his internship period. He told Xin Siyue that the station was planning to start an outdoor challenge program, so they were currently recruiting new hosts to get involved. This will significantly enhance her hosting skills and such an opportunity was hard to come by. Xia Qiao told her that if she was interested in it, she should start preparing for the audition and take part in it.Xin Siyue was surprised, \u201cI can go too?\u201dXia Qiao explained smilingly, \u201cEh, the station puts emphasis on talent, and you fit the requirements.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Xin Siyue looked at his long eyelashes and asked, \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201dXia Qiao grinned, \u201cMaybe because I have faith in you. And isn\u2019t everybody else saying that we have good teamwork? I also think that our teamwork is pretty good. So? Are you going to sign up?\u201dXin Siyue puffed her cheeks and thought over it; the answer was obviously\u2014\u2014yes!While preparing for her busy finals, she also had to prepare for the station\u2019s tests, interviews, and other processes. Then, after she was done with her finals, the TV station also contacted her saying that she was accepted.While Zhong Qin called her to ask about her summer plans, she was shocked upon hearing that Xin Siyue was going to stay in City A to improve her skills, \u201cAre you planning to stay in City A from now on?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d Xin Siyue can\u2019t guarantee that she will be successful as Xia Qiao, who was able to stay in the TV station right after graduation.Zhong Qin analyzed, \u201cI think you have a pretty good chance. After all, you already got in and this is a great opportunity for you.\u201dHowever, Xin Siyue was more realistic. She will be hosting a brand-new show; the outcome of the show was still an unknown factor. But she also understood that this program was very important for her future.She must put in all her efforts and start off successfully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Xin Siyue was in a trance as the familiar scenery outside the window gradually blurred\u2026 Time flew by pretty fast in the novel.Two young and beautiful figures got off the plan and passed through the crowd towards the airport exit.Shengjin City\u2019s September sky was blue and cloudless as the sunlight shone softly upon the crowds. As the gentle breeze blew past them, it gave people a sense of comfort and happiness.While enjoying the warm sun and the soft breeze, Xia Qiao, who wore a black long sleeved shirt and long pants, curved the corners of his lips and exclaimed, \u201cI finally understand why you\u2019re always so calm when dealing with different situations.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Xin Siyue tilted her head to look at him while taking off her sunglasses.\u201cThe unique features of a local environment always give special characteristics to its residents!\u201d Xia Qiao smiled brightly at her.Xin Siyue understood the underlying meaning in his phrase; he was complimenting the climate of Shengjin City! It was true, since even in the novel, the author described Shengjin City as \u201cwarm in winter and cool in the summer.\u201d It was a good place to live; all four seasons felt like spring.Xin Siyue sighed in regret. Xia Qiao was wrong. No matter how great Shengjin City was, it wasn\u2019t the place where she was born, so this place had nothing to do with her growth.She didn\u2019t want to reminisce about her past, so she changed the subject and asked, \u201cYou only have two days of vacation, why did you want to come to Shengjin City with me?\u201dXia Qiao smiled and replied, \u201cI want to talk to people and gain more experience. I also want to take a look at Shengjin City\u2019s scenery and visit your school.\u201dXin Siyue was about to ask, \u2018what\u2019s there to see in Shenjing college\u2019, when she was disrupted by her phone ringing in her purse. She took her cellphone and saw that it was a call from Zhong Qin.Three months ago, during the graduation ceremony, Zhong Qin called her to remind her that no matter how late her program would end, she must rush back to Shenjin City.However, Xin Siyue still couldn\u2019t go back in time for the graduation ceremony due to her job. Because of this, Zhong Qin had complained about it for a long time until Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. She wore her graduation gown once again and took some photos, before sending it to her friend. Only after that did Zhong Qin stop mentioning that incident.This time, it was the celebration for Shengjin College\u2019s 100 year anniversary. After knowing that Xin Siyue had agreed to Principal Zhao\u2019s invitation of being the host of their anniversary celebration, Zhong Qin would call Siyue to remind her everyday because she was worried that the same thing would happen.Even today, Zhong Qin called her before she got on the plane and called once again when she landed.Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t help but tease her after picking up the phone, \u201cDarling, strangers would think that we are a couple because of how frequently you check on me.\u201d\u201cWe were not far from that point anyways. I even think that I worry more about you than myself, I\u2019m about to become your mother.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough, if I have such a young mother, I would be scared to death!\u201dZhong Qin laughed and scolded her, then she asked, \u201cHave you landed yet? When are you free? I\u2019ll treat you!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll probably be free in the evening. I\u2019m going to check out the college first to understand how the celebration will proceed.\u201d\u201cOkay, sure! Give me a call when you\u2019re finished!\u201dAfter Xin Siyue hung up, she asked Xia Qiao if he wanted to unpack at the hotel first, or go to school with her and then accompany her back to the hotel later.Xia Qiao looked at her smilingly and replied, \u201cOf course I\u2019m going to school with you first.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Xin Siyue fixed her hair that was messed up by the wind, and then stretched out her arm to call for a taxi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The three hosts of the program, a senior with 5-6 years of experience, newcomer Xin Siyue and Xia Qiao all received high praises for the audience for their performance.Xin Siyue\u2019s hosting style was dignified, magnanimous, and natural, which got her a lot people\u2019s praise. Her Weibo fans reached 100,000 people within only half a month of opening her Weibo account.The TV station of City A also favored her hosting talent, so they signed a contract to keep her in their TV station.While Xin Siyue was a senior in college, she joined a few other reality shows in the station and all her performances was remarkable.Within a year, she transformed from a newbie in the industry to a host with moderate popularity.As her workloads continued to increase, she became busier, and so she only returned to Shengjin City a handful of times. The only reason she came back this time was solely because Principal Zhao asked her again and again, hoping that she would come back to her alma mater to help out. Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t refuse it, so she accepted the invitation.Upon arriving at her alma mater, she went straight to the Principal\u2019s office. Upon pushing the door open, the faint smile on her face froze when she saw a certain person in a dark suit, sitting across from Principal Zhao.\u2018Chen Sinan?\u2019Xin Siyue\u2019s fair hands were still on the handle when she was frozen in place. Why would Chen Sinan be here at this time? Who can tell her? Was it too late for her to withdraw?Obviously, there wasn\u2019t enough time for her to leave unnoticed.Principal Zhao looked up in her direction the moment the door opened. When he saw Xin Siyue, he nodded delightfully and then secretly examined the expression on the person across from him. He was about to speak when another voice came from outside the door.\u201cSiyue, what happened? Why don\u2019t you go in?\u201d\u2018A man\u2019s voice?\u2019Principal Zhao was very surprised. \u201cLittle Xin, who\u2019s outside?\u201d\u2018Who is it?\u2019 Shen Sinan already had an answer in his thoughts\u2013it was the male host, Xia Qiao.Upon hearing the question, Xin Siyue suddenly realized that she was acting inappropriately. She pushed open the door immediately and walked a few steps forward to introduce Xia Qiao, \u201cPrincipal, this is my colleague, Xia Qiao.\u201dAs Xia Qiao and Principal Zhao greeted each other, the man who had his back facing them suddenly stood up.Chen Sinan turned around; his eyes skimmed over Xin Siyue and then landed on Xia Qiao.Xia Qiao felt the change in the atmosphere around him when Chen Sinan stood up. An oppressive aura surrounded him and it made him displeased.Chen Sinan curved the corners of his lips slightly and said with a lukewarm attitude, \u201cHost Xia, we haven\u2019t seen each other in a long time.\u201dXia Qiao replied with courtesy, \u201cCEO Chen, long time no see. It had been more than two years since we last met at College A.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d Chen Sinan\u2019s sight shifted to Xin Siyue, \u201cIndeed, it had been more than two years.\u201dXin Siyue felt that there was an underlying meaning behind his words, but she ignored his gaze. She asked Principal Zhao for the schedule of the anniversary celebration and asked, \u201cIs the order of the programs confirmed?\u201d\u201cThey will rehearse in the afternoon so you can adjust the order for tonight\u2019s celebration.\u201dXin Siyue knew that Principal Zhao had given her the authority to control the program, so she replied, \u201cOkay, thank you Principal Zhao. Where are the other hosts?\u201d\u201cThere are three other hosts, their names are on the list. You guys can work on building good relationships with each other during the rehearsal.\u201dXin Siyue looked down at the papers in her hand and flipped through them while answering without hesitation, \u201cSure!\u201dSeeing her accepting the request without any hesitation, Principal Zhao said delightfully, \u201cIf the students and the media knew that you are hosting the show tomorrow, they would be very excited.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I watched your shows and they were great. I believe that I have judged you correctly.\u201d Principal Zhao continued, \u201cRight, A\u2019Nan?\u201dChen Sinan curved the corner of his lips slightly to show his approval.Seeing that her list of things to do was completed, Xin Siyue wrapped up the conversation and said, \u201cPrincipal Zhao, I\u2019m going back now. I\u2019ll return in the afternoon for rehearsal.\u201dShe had to eat lunch, bring Xia Qiao to the hotel, and then write the script for tomorrow\u2019s anniversary celebration party.Principal Zhao thought that this opportunity was rare, so he didn\u2019t want to let her go so easily. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for Host Xia and Sinan to be here, how about I\u2019ll treat you guys to a meal? You have to give me face, so let\u2019s have lunch together.\u201d\u201cPrincipal Zhao\u2026\u201d Can you not be this polite?Chen Sinan seemed to have seen her unwillingness, so he commented coldly, \u201cIs Host Xin looking down on Principal Zhao?\u201dXin Siyue looked towards him with a forced smile. \u2018Chen Sinan, this person is sick!\u2019\u201cCEO Chen, you are joking. How am I looking down at Principal Zhao? I just thought that we are being impolite by having Principal Zhao treat us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s easy to solve, just make Host Xin treat us then.\u201d Chen Sinan along followed her words, his appearance was natural as it could possibly be.Xin Siyue gritted her teeth secretly, and then smiled to Principal Zhao\u2019s smiling face, \u201cDeal! Let Principal Zhao choose the place. I\u2019m not familiar around here.\u201d\u201cNo problem,\u201d Principal Zhao was happy to see this result without doing anything himself.Chen Sinan made a \u201chumph\u201d sound, then walked out of the office first.Xia Qiao stood to the side. His confusion from a few years ago dissipated as he watched the exchanges between the three of them.Xin Siyue and Chen Sinan must have had a past that he didn\u2019t know about. Should he think about how to confess directly to Xin Siyue even though it was obvious to him that Xin Siyue only saw him as a friend the entire time?Should he confess? If it fails, will they still be able to maintain their current friendship?Xia Qiao was hesitant.Principal Zhao and Xin Siyue already decided which restaurant they were going to go, and Principal Zhao suggested that the four of them take Chen Sinan\u2019s car to get there.Xin Siyue didn\u2019t have her car with her, so it would be convenient to ride Chen Sinan\u2019s car. But she was also unwilling at the same time, so she wanted to know Xia Qiao\u2019s opinion.Xia Qiao froze for a while, then replied smilingly, \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever is convenient for my hostess.\u201dThus, when Principal Zhao got on the back seat, Xia Qiao and Xin Siyue were stupefied.Xin Siyue became overwhelmed. Principal, what are you planning to do?Principal Zhao laughed when he noticed the awkward situation between the two, \u201cI\u2019m old, so it\u2019s uncomfortable for me to wear the seat belt. I\u2019ll leave front row seats for you young people.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Xin Siyue thought inside her head: Yeah, you are old. we all respect the elders and cherish the young.While she was hesitating between the front passenger seat and the back passenger seat, Xia Qiao quickly occupied the front passenger. As he put on his safety belt, he asked Chen Sinan smilingly, \u201cCEO Chen, you don\u2019t mind I sit here, right?\u201dChen Sinan tilted his eyes and glanced at him for a second without any expression on his face.\u2018Yes, I do mind.\u2019Author\u2019s Afterword: I was stuck on this chapter for a day and night; it was so bad that I wanted to knock my head against the wall\u2026Thanks to my besties who conversed with me and gave me inspiration, and I was finally able to get out of writer\u2019s block!*Tears streaming down*I have a little wish: I hope that I can exceed 4 digits in this year\u2019s special column.

However, as they exited the restaurant, Chen Sinan unexpectedly said, \u201cGet on the car.\u201dXin Siyue, \u201cEh?\u201dChen Sinan glanced at Xia Qiao and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this Host Xia\u2019s first time in Shengjin City? Then, we should act as a host to show you around.\u201dWhen Chen Sinan said \u201cwe\u201d, his eyes were staring straight at Xin Siyue.Xin Siyue felt her scalp turned numb by his stare. There should be no \u2018we\u2019 in that sentence!She doesn\u2019t need his kindness! She was about to reject it politely when Principal Zhao said, \u201cThat would be great! I had been wondering where we should let our Xiao Xia reside. Since it\u2019s like this, I\u2019ll leave this to you, A\u2019Nan.\u201dXia Qiao smiled faintly, \u201cI don\u2019t want to bother Principal Zhao and CEO Xing, I\u2019ll go to the hotel myself.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so polite, Xiao Xia. Just let him bring you along.\u201d Principal Zhao smiled sincerely.Xin Siyue held back the urge to scratch her scalp in frustration. What are they planning?After Chen Sinan escorted Principal Zhao back to the school and Xia Qiao to the hotel, he coldly spoke to Xin Siyue without glancing at her: \u201cGet on the car.\u201dXin Siyue stood next to the car and looked up at him, thinking stubbornly: I won\u2019t enter your car a second time!Now that everyone else had left, he began to use his oppressive aura. Xin Siyue can\u2019t imagine how dumb she would be if she get on his car.She ignored him and turned around to walk away. Just as she stretched out her arm to hail a taxi, Chen Sinan grabbed her slender wrist and dragged her in the direction of his car.Xin Siyue tried to struggle out of his grip, but Chen Sinan glared at her with his sharp eyes, \u201cIf you dare to cause more trouble, I promise tomorrow\u2019s headline will be about me and you.\u201dXin Siyue gritted her teeth and glared at him aggressively! Do you think that you\u2019re amazing just because you have money?Chen Sinan lowered his eyes and sneaked a glance at her. He was content when he saw her baring her fangs and brandishing her claws. After placing her into the passenger seat, he closed the car door upon seeing that she sat there quietly.Chen Sinan got in the car and put on his seatbelt. He looked at her and saw that she seemed angered to the point that her face was expressionless.\u201cDoes Host Xin want me to put the seat belt on for you?\u201dXin Siyue snorted and didn\u2019t spare him a glance as she fastened her seatbelt on in frustration. She replied with a rude tone, \u201cCEO Chen, forgive me for being slow, but what do you mean by this?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I meant by this? If Host Xin thought about it carefully, how would you not know?\u201dXin Siyue took a deep breath, she was unwilling to play around with him.\u201cI want to go home,\u201d Xin Siyue said directly.Since he seems addicted to acting as a driver, she\u2019ll return the favor to him.Chen Sinan glanced at her coldly, only to see that she had already turned her head the other way; he felt a little suffocated by this.The car ride was very quiet, besides the few times when Chen Sinan had briefly picked up a few phone calls.Xin Siyue continued to look at the scenery flashing by the window. She tried her best to ignore his presence when she suddenly said, \u201cThat\u2019s not the direction to my house.\u201dChen Sinan glanced at her and humphed inaudibly.\u201cCEO Chen, I apologize for troubling you by sending me home.\u201d Xin Siyue tried her best to keep calm; she was afraid that she couldn\u2019t resist the urge to go up and bite him.

What was this person planning to do?The car drove into a familiar residential area, and after a long time of contemplation, she finally remembered why this place was so familiar. This was the area where Chen Sinan lived!While Chen Sinan was unbuckling his seatbelt, Xin Siyue deliberately smiled at him and asked, \u201cCEO Chen, are you going to invite me in for a cup of tea?\u201d\u201cYes, is Host Xin going to do me this favor?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dChen Sinan tilted his head and looked at her for a long period of time. He looked at her for so long that Xin Siyue felt chills run down her spine. Finally, in a serious tone, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s Xia Qiao\u2019s relationship with you?\u201d\u201cWhat relationship?\u201d\u201cAre you guys going out?\u201dXin Siyue was stupefied by this sudden question. Why did this person suddenly became interested in Xia Qiao?Chen Sinan watched her blinked her beautiful pair of eyes. It seemed like she was pondering about how to answer his question, but Chen Sinan lost his patience, so he said impatiently, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to him.\u201dXin Siyue was speechless, \u201cCEO Chen, I think your request is over the top. First of all, Xia Qiao is my alumnus. Second, he\u2019s also my coworker, why do I have to talk less with him?\u201dWhen Chen Sinan heard that, he faintly smiled. He turned around and reached out his hand and lifted her chin by taking advantage of how close they were.Xin Siyue was suddenly forced to face his handsome face and deep black eyes. She had never been so intimate with the opposite sex before, so her cheeks began to burn up.She wanted to keep her calm, so she lifted one of her arms to push away his hand. But he quickly grabbed her arm and pressed it against the back of the car seat.\u2018This position!\u2019Xin Siyue clenched her teeth and tried to scratch him with her other hand, but he caught her other wrist as expected.Although her hands were restricted, she was able to make him let go of her chin. But there was a burning sensation in the place where he touched her, making her feel very uncomfortable.Why did Chen Sinan touch her?Xin Siyue was angry at how he was getting fresh with her without saying anything. \u201cChen Sinan, I think you\u2019re the person whom I need to talk less to! Also, you better stop touching me!!\u201dChen Sinan chuckled again, \u201cAre you going to say how it\u2019s improper for me and women to touch each other? If you really think so, why didn\u2019t you say anything when Xia Qiao touched your elbow when we were eating?\u201dWhen we were eating?Xin Siyue thought for a long time before she finally recalled how Xia Qiao had touched her elbow because he was reminding her not to drink cold water. He told the waiter to change her cold water to warm water. She didn\u2019t take his action to heart.She didn\u2019t realize that Chen Sinan was sitting across from her during dinner, so he was able to see everything.Xin Siyue strengthened her nerve and confidently asked, \u201cDo you think you guys are comparable?Chen Sinan replied immediately without any hesitation, \u201cI don\u2019t compare myself with people like him.\u201dXin Siyue was disgusted with how Chen Sinan thought of himself as \u201cthe best\u201d. She refuted him, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with people like him? Oh right, he\u2019s not as conceited CEO Chen is. He also doesn\u2019t get fresh with me like what CEO Chen is doing right now, right?\u201dChen Sinan listened to every word she said, and it seemed to him that in her opinion, Xia Qiao was good no matter what while he was considered unendurable in every way.He frowned and asked, \u201cIs that how you see me?\u201d\u201cChen Sinan, does it matter how I see you? Stop talking nonsense with me and let go of me!\u201d\u201cHumph, it seemed like you can\u2019t wait for me to let you go.\u201d\u201cNo kidding! You should try this position.

Xin Siyue, I will grant you your wish, so from now on, you better behave.\u201d\u201cWhat wish did you grant me?\u201d Xin Siyue was confused.Chen Sinan\u2019s expression suddenly changed subtly, \u201cServes you right that you only got this far during those years!\u201dThis was a direct verbal abuse! She worked so hard to get here. Did he know how many small steps she had to take? Did he know much hard work and effort she had put forth all this time? Although she still hasn\u2019t become the top host, how did she become an eyesore in his eyes? What right did he have to belittle the hard work she had put into her work?Xin Siyue\u2019s tone turned cold, \u201cCEO Chen, I\u2019m just a regular civilian, so I\u2019m different from you. You were born with a halo. But what I have right now is not something you can belittle, even though they might not seem as glorious, but at least they are things that I obtained through my own hard work.\u201dIt was rare for her to have such a serious expression. Chen Sinan remained calm and collected as he loosen his grip on her hands and said, \u201cGo upstairs and change into clean clothes. When the time comes, I\u2019ll send you back to school.\u201d\u201cThank you, but I don\u2019t need it.\u201d Xin Siyue opened the car door, got off, and then took out her phone to call someone.She will just tell Xin Qiancheng to pick her up. She doesn\u2019t believe that Chen Sinan would dare to get fresh with her in front of Xin Qiancheng.Xin Siyue found Xin Qiancheng\u2019s phone number, but her phone was taken away by Chen Sinan before she was able to dial the number. Chen Sinan had taken large strides to walk around the car to grab it.Xin Siyue was mad, \u201cChen Sinan! You bastard! Give me back my phone right now.\u201dChen Sinan ignored her protest, once she got the phone, he used one arm to block her and used his other hand to type a set of numbers into her phone. As soon as he finished dialing the number in her phone, Xin Siyue heard his phone ring in the car.Xin Siyue stopped her futile actions and could only foolishly watch him return to his car to get his phone.When he returned her phone, he added, \u201cThis is my private phone number.\u201dXin Siyue\u2019s eyes were filled with rage, \u201cWhy do I need your private number for? Chen Sinan, can you not be so self-righteous and self-assertive?\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m self-righteous and self-assertive, do you think you would have leisure time during these past two years?\u201d Chen Sinan glanced at her after he finished speaking and clenched his teeth. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re heartless!\u201dXin Siyue wanted to turn her head and just walk away, and she did. But Chen Sinan grabbed her wrist again and pulled her back when she had only walked a couple of steps.Xin Siyue had a headache and supported her head with her hand, \u201cChen Sinan, don\u2019t do this. Let\u2019s have a talk and figure everything out.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something I can explain.\u201d He refused to have a serious conversation with her. After all, he already knew that whatever she will say, won\u2019t be anything he wanted to hear.\u201cYou!\u201d\u201cYou can continue to walk out on me, but I won\u2019t be a gentleman where I only grabbed your wrist the next time you walk out on me.\u201dXin Siyue felt like there was fire burning in her eyes!

Let\u2019s stop seeing each other from now on.\u201d They simply didn\u2019t have anything to say.Upon hearing her blunt words, Chen Sinan\u2019s face immediately turned gloomy.Xin Siyue smiled. \u201cPresident Chen, I\u2019m just saying the truth. If you really can\u2019t take this, just leave me alone. We can just stop seeing each other.\u201d\u201cAre you just going to repeat these words?\u201d\u201cThen why do you keep on torturing me?

I won\u2019t let you use the same reasons twice. I will give you time to get used to this.\u201dXin Siyue was flabbergasted. \u2018Was she not speaking the human language?\u2019She had no idea how to continue to communicate with him! This person was simply unfathomable. Why must he pester her endlessly?!She waved her hands. \u201cMy head hurts. I don\u2019t want to talk to you about this. You should bring me back to school. If not, I\u2019ll call a taxi.\u201d She said this and was about to leave.Seeing her unwell expression, Chen Sinan knitted his eyebrows. He took a step back and said, \u201cI\u2019ll bring you back to rest.\u201dXin Siyue waved her hand. Her house was quite far from school and she wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up with the rehearsal time had she taken a round trip back home. How would she even have time to rest?\u201cBring me back to school.\u201dChen Sinan allowed her to have it her way, seeing how persistent she was.When they arrived at school, Xin Siyue found the three other hosts who were discussing the dress rehearsal that they will be having.With Xin Siyue, there were two men and women. That way, the pairs made the division of work convenient.The three hosts chosen from the school were quite remarkable. They looked at Xin Siyue in admiration and shock. One of the rather small and delicate female hosts even asked Xin Siyue for her signature and requested a photo with her.They discussed for a while before Xin Siyue concluded their draft. She asked for a laptop and printed out the script she thought of on the way here. In the end, she made a few changes.The initial draft was set and it was about time for the dress rehearsal.They followed the original workflow. Everyone was shocked by her aura as Xin Siyue greeted everyone at the beginning of the event.The three hosts secretly admired her inside their hearts. As expected, she was truly a host from the TV station! Her model and ability was different from others!Because of this, the three of them gave their best, trying to keep up with Xin Siyue.The entire workflow of the dress rehearsal was quite successful. They fixed some parts that weren\u2019t satisfactory and Xin Siyue slightly adjusted the order of the programs appearing on stage so that the entire evening party\u2019s programs will flow smoothly.Upon completing her work, Xin Siyue glanced at the clock and saw it was 4:40pm. She was about to call Zhong Qin when unexpectedly, Chen Sinan passed through the school corridors and headed for the assembly hall.At this moment, Xin Siyue, who stood by the assembly hall\u2019s door, finally detected something wrong.She looked to the left and to the right, trying to find an escape route when Chen Sinan arrived in front of her. He said in an extremely natural tone, \u201cIt\u2019s over? I\u2019ll drive you back.\u201dXin Siyue\u2019s heart thumped quickly. \u2018Not right, not right. There seems to be something wrong!\u2019How can Chen Sinan\u2019s character setting digress completely from the novel\u2019s?Why was he acting nervously and wanting to bring her home?Even if he wanted to be a protector, he should be doing that for Sheng Wenyang!Sheng Wenyang!Xin Siyue who forgot about Sheng Wenyang\u2019s existence due to how busy she was, suddenly remembered her. \u2018It\u2019s not right.\u2019 It was now September. According to the original novel\u2019s development, Sheng Wenyang should\u2019ve already returned to the country in brilliance in June!Xin Siyue suddenly realized that this world was no longer following the path of the original novel.The timeline was in disorder and the character settings had collapsed as well. \u2018What will happen next? The ending? Will it change as well?\u2019Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t help but blink her eyes at these thoughts. Could it be because she had barged into this world and broke the original path of this world?Xin Siyue believed in this possibility the more she thought about it.She thought of another question. Now that the world wasn\u2019t developing based on the original book\u2019s plot, wouldn\u2019t her ability to predict the future no longer be useful?Xin Siyue couldn\u2019t help but facepalm herself.

Senior Chen came to school!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s so handsome!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think I can see him in person!\u201d \u2026Xin Siyue listened to the group of girls\u2019 discussion and thought in disdain: He is quite handsome but appearance isn\u2019t everything, right?She pursed her lips and watched him standing there motionlessly. She thought: She wasn\u2019t interested in standing here and watching the girls fawn over him.Xin Siyue turned around and left. Who knew that ChenSinan had followed her and caught up with his long legs.She sped up her pace, but he still leisurely followed her.Xin Siyue was indignant. \u201cChen Sinan, what do you want? Why are you following me?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m beginning to doubt your IQ if you still don\u2019t understand it, despite how obvious it is.\u201dXin Siyue was speechless. It doesn\u2019t make sense. She can\u2019t communicate properly with him!She calmed down and called Zhong Qin, inviting her out for food. She hung up after telling her the time and place. Xin Siyue said, \u201cI\u2019m going out to eat with my best friend. Are you going to follow me still?\u201dChen Sinan pondered deeply about it before he said, \u201cCall me once you\u2019re done. I\u2019ll come and pick you up.\u201dXin Siyue was speechless.Did his soul travel through time as well?He wasn\u2019t the Chen Sinan from the book at all!\u201cWho are you?!\u201d Xin Siyue asked sternly.Chen Sinan thought this question was strange but he asked in reply, \u201cHow about you? Then who are you?\u201dXin Siyue stared at his eyes and felt the brilliant eyes flickering, full of playfulness.She suddenly shivered and felt like he had noticed something.She pondered about it before she replied vaguely, \u201cWho do you think I am?\u201dChen Sinan directly responded, \u201cYou should ask yourself that question.\u201d\u201cAm I not Xin Siyue?\u201d\u201cNames can just be code names sometimes. There have been many people with the same name and surname since the ancient times. Some looked even identical with each other. Though, it\u2019s rare for someone to have the same voice as another.\u201d Chen Sinan observed her sudden pale face and continued to say, \u201c \u2014 but just because it is rare doesn\u2019t mean the possibility doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dXin Siyue was stunned. Her whole mind was thinking: He found out? He found out! When did he find out?!\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d She avoided his eyes and rushed off.Chen Sinan calmly walked behind her and continued to say to himself, \u201cPlastic surgery? It doesn\u2019t look like it.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019d you say had plastic surgery?!\u201d Xin Siyue retorted without hesitation.\u201cNot plastic surgery? Do you have a twin then?\u201d\u201cHah, President Chen. You have a creative imagination.\u201d\u201cThen what about your voice? Why is it exactly the same? No, it\u2019s not exactly the same. The person talking before had a very unpleasant voice. Your tone and expressions are different from hers as well.\u201dXin Siyue secretly thought: \u2018If the original host knew that Chen Sinan had actually paid attention to her in the past unlike her belief that he hadn\u2019t, would she feel slightly comforted?\u2026\u2019Xin Siyue believed that she was overthinking this.She was unwilling to answer but Chen Sinan continued to close in on her. \u201cWhat? Is there an unspeakable secret?\u201dXin Siyue didn\u2019t even look at him. She said, \u201cYou can think whatever you want.\u201d\u201cThen you just need to answer one question. You\u2019re not her, right?\u201d\u201cIs it important to know whether I\u2019m her or not?\u201d Xin Siyue reminded, \u201cChen Sinan, don\u2019t waste your time on me and don\u2019t waste my time either.\u201d\u201cLife is so boring. If I don\u2019t waste time, how will time pass by?\u201dXin Siyue glared harshly at him. She felt like there wasn\u2019t enough time to use everyday. Yet, he was managing two big companies and he dared to say that he wanted to kill time because he was bored.Xin Siyue sighed. He was indeed the male lead. He was probably the son of the author which is why the villainess is looked upon worthlessly.She finally got rid of Chen Sinan and went to meet up with Zhong Qin.Zhong Qin\u2019s first sentence was, \u201cI saw you coming out from the black car for a second. If I remember correctly, the car was a bit familiar.\u201dXin Siyue pulled out a seat and sat down. She said weakly and without strength, \u201cWhat do you want to say? Cut straight to the chase.\u201dZhong Qin stretched her body halfway over the table and smiled flatteringly. \u201cDid Senior Chen bring you over?\u201dXin Siyue stared at her, not blinking at all.Zhong Qin automatically received the answer. She excitedly said, \u201cOh! You\u2019ve grown up! Xin Siyue, explain honestly. What\u2019s your relationship with Chen Sinan? When did this happen?\u201dXin Siyue felt helpless. \u201cOn the contrary, I want to know if Chen Sinan had been provoked in the past two years in any way. He\u2019s acting so abnormal, completely unlike himself!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When she returned to Xin Family, she couldn\u2019t help but be touched by how Bai Ning prepared the table of gourmet food in high spirits for her.Aunt Chen helped carry the cooked dishes over to the table as she smiled splendidly at Xin Siyue. She said, \u201cMadam knows that you will be home tonight and had been pondering over what dishes she should prepare for you since earlier this afternoon. She had been trying out different things in the kitchen since a long time ago. Young miss, all these dishes are personally cooked by Madam.\u201dWhen Bai Ning heard that her daughter was back, she wiped her hands and walked out from the kitchen. She smiled then said, \u201cAre you tired? If you are, you can go up and rest for a while.\u201dXin Siyue couldn\u2019t help but hug Bai Ning after seeing her. She grinned then responded, \u201cMom, how can we finish all the food you cooked later on?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s ok, it\u2019s ok. It\u2019s because you seldom come home!\u201dXin Siyue felt even more ashamed after hearing this. Because of her studies and work, she rarely came home. Xin Siyue smiled sweetly and grabbed onto Bai Ning\u2019s arms. She said, \u201cMom, how about I find time to come home frequently in the future?\u201d\u201cSilly child! That would be great!\u201dXin Siyue looked at her smiling face and believed she definitely needed to return home more often.At night, when the whole family was happily eating, Xin Siyue\u2019s phone rang. She hurriedly ran over to the sofa where she had left her phone, and answered it after a couple rings. \u201cHello.\u201d\u201cWhere are you?\u201d\u201cAt home.\u201d Xin Siyue answered subconsciously. Then, she realized that who else would the deep voice belong to if it wasn\u2019t Chen Sinan? She hurriedly moved the phone away from her ears to look at the screen. It was a bunch of unfamiliar digits.Xin Siyue recalled him taking her own phone to call himself. She looked serious and asked, \u201cIs there a matter?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good that you arrived home safely.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Xin Siyue didn\u2019t even get to continue her words when Chen Sinan said, \u201cRest well.\u201d He hung up right after.Xin Siyue glanced at her phone which displayed \u2018call ended\u2019. She was unable to comprehend what happened. What was he doing? Did he call just to confirm her safety?Xin Siyue felt that this was becoming more and more unrealistic.Xin Qiancheng watched as she stared blankly at her phone and asked, \u201cWho called? Is there an urgent matter? The food is getting cold.\u201dXin Siyue hurriedly answered, \u201cNothing. I\u2019ll be coming.\u201d She decided to just stop thinking about Chen Sinan.It was rare for Xin Siyue was on vacation. After her nap, she woke up to shop a bit with Bai Ning. When that ended, she went straight to school.The school was bustling with people during the anniversary of the founding of the school. Besides the students who passed by and forth, there were numerous senior brothers and sisters returning back to the alma mater.The atmosphere around school was pretty good. After Xin Siyue strolled for a bit, she was nagged by a few junior sisters. They said that they recognized her as A City\u2019s TV Station\u2019s host. They had a lively discussion talking about how much they liked and admired her. After that, they wanted to take pictures and get her signatures.Xin Siyue was amiable and approachable so she satisfied each one of them. When she signed her name for the last person, she got ready to leave. A girl with round glasses asked shyly, \u201cSenior Sister Xin, I am from the Reporter\u2019s Department in school. I really enjoyed your hosting in various programs so I want to interview and write a report on you. Senior Sister Xin, is it ok?\u201dXin Siyue pondered over it and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can\u2019t.\u201dThe group of girls were slightly excited and the girl wearing round glasses was in high spirits. \u201cSo Senior Sister Xin agrees?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not really a problem. The main point is that I\u2019m short on time. I have something else later on and after I\u2019m done, I will be flying straight back to A City tonight. How about this? Give me your number and when I have time, I will set an appointment with you.\u201d\u201cSure, sure, sure! Thanks Senior Sister!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She confirmed the entire program\u2019s workflow with the hosts again before she began to change clothes and applied makeup.The evening gown was prepared by the school in advance.When Xin Siyue saw the sapphire blue evening gown, she was a bit shocked. When did the school\u2019s gowns become so high quality?The sapphire blue dress smoothly fell on the ground. The high-waisted design made her seem even more slimmer and tall. When Xin Siyue saw the embedded dazzling diamonds on the V neck, she couldn\u2019t help but think: the school is really spending quite a bit.However, as expected, the dress looked really good on her.Xin Siyue tried on the white taper high heels which were embedded with diamonds as well. It made the dress look good with the heels.Not bad.Xin Siyue\u2019s outfit took many people\u2019s breaths away. When the evening party began, the audience was in complete silence when the four hosts just appeared. After a few minutes, shrieks and cheers rang from everywhere.The different media that Principal Zhao had invited aimed their cameras at Xin Siyue from time to time and took some close up photos. The whole time, Xin Siyue maintained a sweet slight smile. She automatically ignored Chen Sinan who sat under the stage by the first row to the left utmost seat. He wore a black suit and held a quiet but deep gaze at her.When the programs successful hit its half-way point, the hosts were requested to add two more programs.Xin Siyue looked at the names of the programs that the person in charge handed her. Special guest: Xia Qiao. Performance: singing. There was also another grand finale mysterious guest.The person in charge of announcing the programs was conveniently Xin Siyue as well. When she introduced Xia Qiao\u2019s program, she said, \u201cThe next guest appearing is someone who means a lot to me. He used to be my Senior Brother and the person who guided me into hosting, this career. You could even say that we have been fighting bravely through obstacles side by side up until now. I am thankful for him and thankful that he had blessed my alma mater, Sheng Jin College. Now, let\u2019s welcome Xia Qiao!\u201dXia Qiao wore simple black pants with a white t-shirt. He wasn\u2019t lacking in handsomeness either. He smiled and waved towards the audience under stage. He said, \u201cI\u2019m very happy that I am able to make it on time to Sheng Jin College\u2019s grand annual anniversary. Sheng Jin College is a place that brings people warmth and positive energy. I wish for a better and more beautiful tomorrow for Sheng Jin College! Now, I will share my favorite song with you guys. Hopefully, everyone who is sitting here right now will have a brighter and splendid future.\u201dXia Qiao\u2019s voice was pleasant to the ears. When he wholeheartedly devoted himself to singing the song, he was unable to stop himself.Xin Siyue stood by the corner of a side on stage. She concentrated on him and listened to him sing the entire song.From time to time, she could feel that Xia Qiao shifted his body to look at her on stage. When Xin Siyue made eye contact with him, she would slightly smile.Xia Qiao would respond with a slight smile as well.In the course of time, Chen Sinan seemed to have noticed this. He emitted cold aura in his surroundings.When the music was about to end, Xia Qiao seamlessly looked at Chen Sinan\u2019s darkened face. Right after, the moment the last note of the song landed, he said, \u201cThank you everyone! Also, thank you Principal Zhao and Siyue.\u201dThe way he said her name made them feel so intimate and close with each other!Everyone who was immersed in the song didn\u2019t really care for the address. Yet, a certain someone took this to heart.The evening party was approaching its end. The second to last program was about to end in almost two minutes. Xin Siyue was about to head back on stage when she heard her partner, a slim and female host ask the two other male hosts, \u201cDo you guys have any clue who the mysterious guest is? I didn\u2019t hear of any influential figures in the student union arriving!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I didn\u2019t hear of any influential figures in the student union arriving!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t either. Won\u2019t we find out later on?\u201dXin Siyue lifted her dress and walked gracefully and gently to the center of the stage. After she announced the next program and was about to head down from a corner of the stage, she noticed the lights around the stage all dimmed down. Right after, the graceful figure walking out from the other side of the stage became clearer and clearer.She wore a white strapless slit dress and the length of her hair reached her shoulder. The woman naturally and gracefully walked to the center of the stage as the lights brightened.Xin Siyue who stood by a corner was blinded by the diamond bracelet and the woman\u2019s necklace in the shape of a water drop.She slightly squinted her eyes to hear the woman introducing herself after slightly smiling at everyone. \u201cHello everyone, I am Sheng Wenyang!\u201dThe audience was shocked! She was the famous Sheng Wenyang from the jewelry industry?! She actually appeared during Sheng Jin College\u2019s anniversary!The lights flashed non stop.Yet, Xin Siyue was stunned and remained unmoved. Sheng Wenyang? She is the Sheng Wenyang, the original female lead from the book? She\u2019s back? She actually returned at this time!Xin Siyue watched as she smiled brightly and acted generously, properly introducing the set of jewelry she had designed specially for the alma mater. She even donated a total fund of ten million as an investment for the school. When she slightly bowed to express her gratitude of the alma mater for educating her, everyone clapped thunderously.It was time for the hosts to head on stage and thank Sheng Wenyang. When the entire evening party ended, the three hosts just noticed Xin Siyue miraculously still standing in her original spot.\u201cSister Xin, are you ok?\u201d The other female host reached over to hold on her wrist.Xin Siyue then snapped out of her trance. She shook her head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s our turn to head back out. Are you guys ready?\u201dThat woman looked worriedly at her before she said, \u201cSister Xin, your face is a bit pale. Is something wrong?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dXin Siyue rapidly adjusted her state of mind and walked under the spotlight.Why did she have such an intense reaction to Sheng Wenyang when she saw her? Hadn\u2019t she been looking forward to Sheng Wenyang returning? As long as she returned, no one will continue to pay attention to her and Chen Sinan\u2019s past. Chen Sinan won\u2019t go find her from time to time anymore.But why did she feel so uneasy now that her wish is granted?When the evening party ended, Xin Siyue immediately headed down the stage and subconsciously looked over at Chen Sinan\u2019s seat. What was his expression when he saw Sheng Wenyang? What a pity that the seat was empty.Xin Siyue suddenly laughed. Why is she thinking so much because of Sheng Wenyang? So what if she returned? After all, her flight was at midnight and she will be returning back to A City. What could happen?Xin Siyue went backstage and took pictures with everyone for memory. Then, she went to the changing room to change out of her evening gown. When she came out, Zhong Qin had been waiting for her outside the door. \u201cYour flight is at midnight, right? I\u2019ll take you over.\u201dXin Siyue said, \u201cIt\u2019s too late. It\u2019s dangerous for you to come back alone. My brother will bring me over.\u201dZhong Qin glanced at her face and asked, \u201cAre you not feeling well? Why is your face so pale?\u201dXin Siyue waved her hands, gesturing that she was ok.Zhong Qin stared at her, not believing her. She guessed, \u201cIs it because Senior Sister Sheng came back?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not because of that.\u201d Xin Siyue said. Her phone rang and she hurriedly took out her phone to see. \u201cIt\u2019s Xia Qiao\u2019s call. Let me answer him.\u201dZhong Qin hummed in agreement. When she got off the call, the two went to meet up with Xia Qiao.There were two more hours before midnight. The three found a place and ordered some drinks. After Xin Siyue and Zhong Qin bid each other farewell, they went back to their respective homes, while Xia Qiao went back to his hotel to grab his luggage. The two decided to meet up at the airport.After Xin Siyue and Xia Qiao separated, she felt her head ringing and buzzing since the end of the evening party. She didn\u2019t want to immediately take a car back home so she walked along the road for a bit, when she suddenly felt someone grab onto her wrist.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But her slender long legs were immediately blocked by Chen Sinan\u2019s hands.Chen Sinan didn\u2019t expect her to make this move. He said with a gloomy face, \u201cYou are actually capable of doing this?\u201dWhen Xin Siyue saw that it was him, she hurriedly broke free from his grasp. Chen Sinan who was still shocked by her skills didn\u2019t pay attention, so she was able to successfully escape.Xin Siyue moved back a step and asked him in alarm, \u201cWhy is it you?!\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s not me, then who else can it be? Xia Qiao?\u201d Chen Sinan had been restraining himself the entire night. She had been hosting the programs the whole night while he wasted his time sitting there, watching the boring programs because of her. In the end, she didn\u2019t even spare him a glance.He didn\u2019t believe that she had no idea he was present when he sat in the first row! Plus, when the hosts were introducing the guests, they mentioned his name as well!Forget about this! The most despicable part was her and Xia Qiao!He wanted to hurry over to the backstage when the programs were almost over to confront Xin Siyue when he ended up getting nagged by a classmate in the business field. When he rushed over, he watched as Sin Xiyue left with Zhong Qin and Xia Qiao.He grinded his teeth in anger and originally wanted to drive straight home, but he made an U-turn halfway and followed her.He knew that if he let her return to A City and there weren\u2019t any major events since, she would definitely not come back until the end of the year.Xin Siyue listened to his overbearing tone and laughed right then. \u201cChen Sinan, can you not be so boring?\u201d\u201cI am boring to you, but I think you and Xia Qiao had a good time talking to each other.\u201d\u201cHow about you? You came to pester me just to prove that you\u2019re more interesting than Xia Qiao?\u201d\u201cI\u2013!\u201d Chen Sinan calmed down and said seriously, \u201cI won\u2019t fight with you.\u201d\u201cHumph, who wants to fight with you?\u201d Xin Siyue said this and nimbly turned around, leaving.Chen Sinan stared at her persistent rear view and he was angry. He reached over to pull her towards the road.\u201cLet go of me! Chen Sinan! Why are you pulling me?! Let go! Chen Sinan! Do you hear me?! Let go of me\u2026\u201dSeeing that he was pulling her further and further away, Xin Siyue was about to tiptoe and kick him, when he held onto her two shoulders and pressed her harshly against the wall. She was unable to move at all. Xin Siyue was infuriated and scolded, \u201cChen Sinan, you bastard!\u201dChen Sinan who was called a bastard lowered his head and looked at her pink and delicate lips which she was biting right now. He slightly lowered his body and said in her ears, \u201cBastard? I can be even more of a bastard. Do you want to see?\u201dHe just finished his words when Xin Siyue felt something soft on her lips. She widened her eyes in shock to see his tightly shut eyes and his long and curly pitch-black eyelashes which were slightly trembling.She was lost in her thoughts when she felt pain on her lips. Bastard! He dared to bite her.She was about to curse him out when he had his way. The moment his nimble tongue made his way in her mouth, Xin Siyue felt herself trembling.She looked at the dim yellow street lights not far from here. She wanted to weep but there were no tears. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen! When did Chen Sinan kiss her?! The person he should be kissing is Sheng Weyang! The plot is completely wrong!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The person he liked should be Sheng Wenyang!Wrong. When did he start to place all of his attention on herself?Xin Siyue recalled his words, \u201cIf you want to return to A City, you can go back and wait for me to finish handling the matters here. I will go find you once I\u2019m done.\u201dAt that time, Xin Siyue was dazed at his words, unable to comprehend his meaning. But now that she recovered from the shock, her ability to reason returned too. She then realized what was wrong with his words.Why is Chen Sinan coming to A City?The more she thought about it, the more she felt the need to talk to Chen Sinan and make it clear between them. She didn\u2019t like him at all. Plus, who gave him the permission to forcibly kiss her? That was her first kiss! She was angrier by the moment.Seeing that Xin Siyue furrowed her eyebrows the entire time, Xia Qiao couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? I feel like ever since you came back from Shengjin City, you have been distracted.\u201dWhen Xia Qiao had waited for her at the airport, he saw her getting off a black car. The driver seat\u2019s window was down; although he just glanced from afar, he noticed the composed side profile of the driver and had an idea who it was. If that person wasn\u2019t Chen Sinan, who else would it be?Xia Qiao had asked Xin Siyue a question earlier, but she had not replied. He inquired again, \u201cSiyue, are you not feeling well?\u201dXin Siyue was pondering ways to get rid of Chen Sinan, so she was lost in her thoughts. She responded, \u201cNothing. I was just thinking about something.\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking that made you so lost in your own world?\u201d Xia Qiao slightly smiled.Xin Siyue shook her head and answered, \u201cNothing really.\u201dWhen she went to work the next day, everything was normal. Recently, Xin Siyue had been recording a new singing competition. The majority of the contestants were college students from all parts of the country. The program decided to record while editing it at the same time before it would be broadcasted. The results were pretty good.Today, Xin Siyue had just finished the recording and didn\u2019t even have time to change clothes when one of her colleagues said, \u201cSiyue, there\u2019s a very handsome man looking for you downstairs! Very handsome!\u201d When the colleague finished her words, she looked mischievously at her.Xin Siyue never guessed it would be Chen Sinan. She laughed and then said, \u201cHow handsome?\u201d\u201cSuper handsome!\u201d The colleague said playfully.Xin Siyue casually said, \u201cHow could be there such a handsome guy? You\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true. If you don\u2019t believe me, why don\u2019t you go downstairs and take a look yourself?\u201dXin Siyue walked downstairs, half-believing those words. When she saw the familiar slender figure by the black car, she was dumbstruck. \u201cHow are you\u2013\u201d Halfway through her words, she forcibly gulped down what she was about to say. It seemed like every time they met, she always had to question why he was there. After a while, she even became suspicious of her ability to express her feelings.Chen Sinan raised his head to look at her. He slightly curved his lips up, \u201cWhen do you get off work?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking this?\u201dHearing her tone filled with alarm, he laughed, \u201cI just want to eat with you after you\u2019re off work.\u201d\u201cThank you but there is no need.\u201dAfter he was rejected, Chen Sinan looked faintly at her and said, \u201cDo you want me to do what I did last night to you again?

I\u2019m going back to work now.\u201dShe had worked approximately another two hours until Chen Sinan called her. Xin Siyue hung up on him without a doubt.In the next second, he sent her a blunt text. \u201cIf you don\u2019t come down. I don\u2019t mind coming up and bringing you down.\u201dXin Siyue looked at the message and felt like hardships were ahead. She grinded her teeth and picked up her bag as she stood up. When she walked downstairs, she was expressionless. Seeing his car was still parked there, she immediately got in the car. Without looking, she said, \u201cChen Sinan, we should make it clear between us. I can act like nothing happened last night so stop coming to see me in the future\u2026\u201d\u201cCough, cough\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThis voice?Xin Siyue looked shockingly at Chen Sinan. That man looked expressionlessly back at her.He wasn\u2019t the one making the noise before.Xin Siyue was confused but Chen Sinan shifted his gaze to the seat in the back. Xin Siyue followed his gaze to see a middle-aged man wearing a black suit in the car, besides Chen Sinan.She looked carefully at him and it wasn\u2019t hard to tell that he and Chen Sinan had the same thick eyebrows and red phoenix eyes. Even the bridges of their noses were similar.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Xin Siyue felt her heart thumping violently. Did he hear everything that she had just said?Chen An seemingly understood how awkward she felt so he slightly smiled, before returning to his serious face. \u201cHello, I am that boy\u2019s father, Chen An.\u201d\u201cFather?\u201d Xin Siyue was shocked. Why did she see Chen An?!She remembered the book mentioning how Chen An was still a high government official early in his years and resigned later on due to health reasons. After many years of treatment, his body had recovered. Then, he muddled himself in the business world.Her impression of Chen An wasn\u2019t fully developed. He seemed to be the typical male lead\u2019s father who was successful in business and had little to say. He also barely intervened with the male lead\u2019s matters and the matters at home were handled by his wife. He only made decisions regarding major matters.Xin Siyue was feeling sluggish, up until Chen Sinan reached over to pat her head. He laughed at her and said, \u201cYou really are self-conscious. Although you have to change the way you address him eventually, I\u2019m scared that my father might be frightened by you calling him \u2018father\u2019 during the first meeting.\u201dSeeing the two\u2019s interactions, Chen An pondered deeply over Xin Siyue\u2019s words. He immediately had a hunch that his son, who had been pursued in the past by numerous people since he was a child, was currently being mocked by the other party. This son was now having a hard time on the path to pursuing his future wife.Chen An was in a pretty good mood after thinking of this. Someone could finally abuse this boy now.Chen An laughed and agreed, \u201cI did get frightened.\u201dXin Siyue watched as the father and son echoed one another and she felt embarrassed. She avoided Chen Sinan\u2019s hand seamlessly and explained, \u201cThat\u2019s not it. I was just a bit shocked so I repeated the phrase. Uncle, please forgive me. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Enjoy the read!Chen An glanced at Chen Sinan who had a faint look on. Therefore, he said, \u201cNo worries.\u201d Ge urged Chen Sinan and said, \u201cQuickly drive. After lunch, I\u2019m going to visit your Uncle Feng.\u201dWhen Chen Sinan turned the steering wheel, he said in despise, \u201cSince you have so much to do in A City, why did you come find me?\u201d\u201cI came to discuss matters with you! Otherwise, you think I want to see you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you either.\u201d Chen Sinan answered.\u201cStupid boy!\u201dXin Siyue who sat there was speechless.Right, she mustn\u2019t open her mouth.At Shengjin City, Zhuang Zhu and a few others gathered together with Mo Be who just arrived today.Within a private room, Zhuang Zhu lifted his glass of wine and asked, \u201cAre you planning to stay for good in Shengjin City now that you\u2019re back?\u201dMo Bei lifted his wine glass and bumped it against his. \u201cYes, I\u2019m planning to develop in the country. You know that my grandmother and the others have been urging me to come back.\u201dZhuang Zhu chuckled and said, \u201cAren\u2019t you stupid? They want you to come back and you actually obediently listened to them? Aren\u2019t you just coming back for the same old matters? All the young misses from wealthy families in the upper society are all forming a line to see who you will pick from amongst them!\u201dMo Bei wasn\u2019t as excited, on the other hand. He said, \u201cIf I can avoid them, I will do so. If I need to act, I will do so. This isn\u2019t a problem for me.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t thought about so much when he came back. It was because Sheng Wenyang had suddenly returned. He knew that she was bound to come back, but he didn\u2019t think it would be so soon.Zhuang Zhe smiled and said, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know that you became a Film Emperor after going abroad. Does that mean there\u2019s a chance for you to get the Oscar in the future?\u201dMo Bei rolled his eyes then asked, \u201cWhere is Chen Sinan?\u201d\u201cOh, him! I heard that he went somewhere else in the country.\u201d\u201cFor a business trip?\u201d\u201cProbably, or probably not.\u201d When Zhuang Zhu said this, he laughed. \u201cI heard that he had been frequently going to school recently. I hadn\u2019t heard that he enjoyed school that much in the past.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201dZhuang Zhu moved closer to him and winked. \u201cI went to ask around and found out that the day before Shengjin College\u2019s anniversary, he had been very close to a female host. She\u2019s from the Xin Family. Have you heard of her?\u201dMo Bei pondered deeply. She\u2019s from the Xin Family? Well, he had heard of Xin Qiancheng.He was about to continue asking when his phone rang. It was Sheng Wenyang. She heard that he also returned back in the country, so she specially called to ask about him.Mo Bei answered yes and conveniently explained how he was at a gathering with his close childhood friends. Who knew that Sheng Wenyang had asked, \u201cIs it convenient? Can I come over?\u201dIt was rare that she wanted to see him so Mo Bei immediately answered, \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll come pick you up. Where are you now?\u201d\u201cNo need, I\u2019m very close to where you are. I can just drive over.\u201dAfter Mo Bei hung up, he urged Zhuang Zhu in dismissing the beautiful women in the private room. He continued to say, \u201cMy friend will be coming later on. Pay attention to your words and don\u2019t say any inappropriate things.\u201dZhuang Zhu was happy. \u201cYour friend is that precious? Is it a beautiful woman?\u201d\u201cShe is a beautiful woman, but we aren\u2019t in that kind of relationship yet.\u201dZhuang Zhu didn\u2019t believe him. When Sheng Wenyang arrived, Mo Bei introduced her, \u201cThis is Sheng Wenyang.\u201d Zhuang Zhu recalled right then. Her surname was Sheng? She is Chen Sinan\u2019s rumored girlfriend?\u201cYou\u2013\u201d Zhuang Zhu was stunned and directly asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with A-Nan?\u201dSheng Wenyang came over for Chen Sinan. Yet, when she browsed the entire private room, she didn\u2019t see him. She slightly smiled and answered, \u201cAn unclear relationship.\u201dZhuang Zhu was speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Their second impressions would be \u201cthis was a very confident beauty.\u201dYet, Zhuang Zhu\u2019s first impression of Sheng Wenyang was \u201cthis was a woman that he mustn\u2019t provoke\u201d!Because of this, he even called Chen Sinan.At that time, Chen Sinan was bringing Xin Siyue back to her apartment. He picked up the call and before he could say anything, Zhuang Zhu said in exaggeration, \u201cDamn, Chen Sinan! I\u2019m not trying to scold you or anything but when did you come into contact with Sheng Wenyang? She\u2019s so scary!\u201d\u201cSheng Wenyang?\u201d Chen Sinan subconsciously said the name out loud as he heard it. He could feel Xin Siyue turning her head over to look at him after she heard the name.Chen Sinan was about to get out of the car to answer the call when he remembered how Xin Siyue had been misunderstanding his relationship with Sheng Wenyang. If he continued to avoid her while on call, she would definitely begin thinking nonsense. Therefore, he gave her a look of comfort.Xin Siyue realized that she was overly sensitive so she turned her head around. She unbuckled her seatbelt and wanted to get off the car when she heard \u2018snap\u2019. The door was locked.Xin Siyue tried a couple times before coming to the conclusion that she really couldn\u2019t open it.She sighed heavily before turning around to glare harshly at Chen Sinan. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dChen Sinan motioned for her to wait a while before he said, \u201cIf you have something to say, say it now or else I will hang up.\u201dAlthough Xin Siyue\u2019s voice was low, Zhuang Zhu seemed to have heard a woman\u2019s voice. Chen Sinan actually has a woman!Oh my god. This was a miracle.Zhuang Zhu noticed something new and odd. He asked excitedly, \u201cA-Nan, you\u2019re with a beauty right now!\u201d\u201cHurry and hang up since you already know.\u201d\u201cSigh, I called you to inform you about something, yet you are telling me to hang up. You really aren\u2019t grateful for the things I do for you.\u201d\u201cStop talking nonsense.\u201dZhuang Zhu obviously knew that Chen Sinan was about to get angry. He was scared that he might hang up on him later on so he hurriedly say, \u201cToday, I was eating with Bei and saw Sheng Wenyang there. She didn\u2019t seem like someone easily to be provoked. When I asked her about your relationship with her, guess what she said? She said that you guys have an ambiguous relationship. Hey, A-Nan, you couldn\u2019t possibly have done something to her, right? She has been thinking about you constantly.\u201dChen Sinan acted like this had nothing to do with him and he said, \u201cSince you and her are familiar to the point you guys could eat together, tell her that I, Chen Sinan, don\u2019t have any ambiguous relationship with her, the next time you see her.\u201d He didn\u2019t want for Zhuang Zhu to continue to take joy in his misfortune so he hung up on him.Chen Sinan placed his phone away and looked at Xin Siyue. She was staring deeply at him. He thought about it before he said, \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing going on between me and Sheng Wenyang.\u201dXin Siyue first knitted her eyebrows before she continued to say, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on with someone you\u2019ve kissed? Then, Mr. Chen, there\u2019s nothing going on between the two of us either.\u201dChen Sinan\u2019s face instantly turned heavy when she finished her words. She ignored him and twisted the door handle. She said toughly, \u201cOpen the door. I want to leave.\u201d\u201cExplain yourself.\u201d Chen Sinan grabbed her hand and pulled her closer to himself. He looked at her and said, \u201cHow do you know I kissed her?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want anyone to know, then don\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cXin Siyue, you didn\u2019t lose your memory at all.

At that time, there was no one in his office. When she kissed him, he was facing the window and the door. If someone was to pass by or on the opposite side, he clearly would\u2019ve seen them.The reality was that no one was there, so how could Xin Siyue know all of this?!Xin Siyue thought that he was angry because she had exposed his lies. She sneered and said, \u201cChen Sinan, your ability to change the topic is quite good. We were clearly talking about you and Sheng Wenyang and me.\u201d\u201cThere is simply nothing between me and Sheng Wenyang.\u201d\u201cYou dare to swear that she has no feelings for you?\u201dAs expected, Chen Sinan was silent.Xin Siyue laughed again. \u201cSo, Chen Sinan, you can place your feelings about me away now. It\u2019s not real at all. You don\u2019t truly like me and I don\u2019t like you. We simply won\u2019t have any results from being together.\u201d\u201cDo you mind Sheng Wenyang that much?\u201d\u201cI do mind.\u201d Xin Siyue admitted directly.\u201cYou mind her because you like me.\u201d\u201cHeh.\u201d Xin Siyue chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re really narcissistic. I won\u2019t be that irrational and like you. Even if all the women in this world like you, I won\u2019t let myself like you.\u201d\u201cGive me a reason\u201dXin Siyue glanced the bright street lights in the darkness. She leisurely said, \u201cBecause this world doesn\u2019t belong to me. And you, won\u2019t belong to me either.\u201dChen Sinan wanted to retort but his words changed to, \u201cYou don\u2019t like me because you like Xia Qiao?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like anyone.\u201d When Xin Siyue finished, she continued, \u201cI like no one.\u201dChen Sinan humphed and said, \u201cThis is the most bizarre reason I\u2019ve heard since I was a child to reject me. You think that you can cut off love and be ruthless? Are you confident that you won\u2019t like anyone?\u201dXin Siyue looked far in the distance and said after a while, \u201cMaybe I will find someone that I don\u2019t really dislike and marry them.\u201d\u201cIf you can find a person you don\u2019t dislike and live with them, why won\u2019t you consider me?\u201d Chen Sinan thought this was endless mockery.Xin Siyue reacted faintly to this. She smiled and said, \u201cBecause you\u2019re Chen Sinan.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Chen Sinan looked at her and felt his whole body bursting with anger. \u201cYou said that you wanted two peaceful years of life and I gave you it. You wanted to develop in A City and was unwilling to return to Sheng Jin City, so I gradually moved the main part of my work here. This is the first time that I, Chen Sinan, wanted to be nice to someone. Yet, this is what happens when I try.\u201d\u201cWell, I am quite curious about what you like about me. Is it because I had been pursuing you non stop in the past and when I suddenly stopped being interested in you, you are interested now?\u201dChen Sinan was at a lack of words when she questioned him.Xin Siyue smiled a fake smile, \u201cSo why must you put me in a difficult situation? From what I know, Sheng Wenyang really likes you.\u201d\u201cStop meddling in my business.\u201d Chen Sinan shifted his gaze and looked straight ahead. He didn\u2019t want to look at her anymore. He was scared that he might want to choke her to death out of impulse.Xin Siyue shrugged her shoulders, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me, as long as you stop pestering me.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Chen Sinan was speechless due to how angry he was. \u201cXin Siyue, do you even have a heart?!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of heart do you want? A heart that likes you? I don\u2019t dare to have one like that. Open the door.\u201dChen Sinan looked coldly at her and she stared back unyieldingly. Right after, she heard the sound of the doors unlocking. She secretly relaxed in her heart and hurriedly opened the door and got out of the car. She walked to her apartment without looking back once.On the other hand, Chen Sinan sat in his car and stayed there for a while.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When she finally fell asleep, she had a few nightmares.In the dream, she was unsure where the car was headed to. In the end, she got lost and even the GPS didn\u2019t know where she was.She passed by the crossroad and continued to drive straight, but an unfamiliar man came up and told her she was driving in the wrong direction. In her heart back then, she was thinking how there were quite a few nice people in the world.Who knew that she had driven about a few hundred meters after she made an U-turn, and she was surrounded by people. Six or seven sturdy men surrounded her car and the leader was the \u2018nice person\u2019 who pointed out the direction for her.He had a sinister expression and he easily smashed the glass window on her car. He pulled her out and without another word, he started to slash her with the knife.In the beginning, Xin Siyue was terrified but it transformed into a sense of hopelessness. When she laid in her pool of blood, these people were laughing and saying, 'she can\u2019t endure the cuts. It\u2019s not satisfying enough.\u201dThe surrounding puddle of blood was fresh red and she was startled, her face full of sweat when she woke up. She hurriedly opened the lamp by the bedside and looked around. After she saw that she was in her bedroom and there weren\u2019t any crazy and inhuman people, she couldn\u2019t help but to breath heavily.It took her a long time to calm down and become peaceful. She went to the living room to pour a glass of water but didn\u2019t dare to return to the bedroom. She sat there with the lights on and she wasn\u2019t in the mood to listen to what the TV was broadcasting. She stared at a certain spot lifelessly.Why would she suddenly have such a horrific nightmare?Xin Siyue could only comfort herself, saying that she was probably under a lot of pressure recently.She wanted to start a new program and her boss said yes. But, she was in charge from writing and directing it to hosting the program. If she got good feedback, it was naturally good. But if the feedback were normal, the program will be immediately stopped.Due to this, Xin Siyue had wasted a lot of braincells on this. But no matter how she planned it out, she wasn\u2019t pleased. This program had therefore, made no progress.Xin Siyue was deep in her thoughts when the doorbell rang time after time.She subconsciously shivered and her eyes were filled with terror and fright. Her heart thumped rapidly at the ear-piercing noise.She tried her best to let herself calm down. At this time, her phone rang coincidentally too. It was Chen Sinan.Xin Siyue considered whether or not she should answer the call.Before she made a decision, the doorbell stopped ringing.The ringing of the phone stopped too.Xin Siyue watched as the screen of her phone dimmed down. Right after, Chen Sinan changed to sending a text to her. \u201cIt\u2019s me, open the door.\u201d\u201cAre you ok?\u201d\u201cXin Siyue, what happened to you?\u201dXin Siyue was surprised. He actually didn\u2019t leave yet still?When Chen Sinan saw that she wasn\u2019t answering the messages, he continued to call her.The moment the door opened, Chen Sinan slowly placed the hand used to hold his phone down.\u201cAre you ok?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. Mr. Chen, why are you here in the middle of the night?\u201dChen Sinan looked at her pale face and asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you asleep at such a late time?\u201d\u201cThank you for your concern.\u201dChen Sinan pondered deeply and asked, \u201cYou got a nightmare?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLast time in the hospital, you had a nightmare the whole night.\u201d Chen Sinan suddenly walked up and held her in his arms. He said softly and comforted, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m here.\u201dXin Siyue blinked her eyes and felt her eyes turning bitter and sour.

After lunch, she was clearly on the verge of falling asleep. She went to the bathroom to rinse her face and to apply some more makeup. When she returned to her office, the beautiful Miss Lu gracefully walked over with her ten centimeters high high heels. She said to Xin Siyue, \u201cThe Chief Editor wants you to go over.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xin Siyue was confused why the Chief Editor would ask for the beautiful Miss Lu to come call her. People should know that the beautiful Miss Lu was the famous golden host in interview programs. All the celebrities and famous people\u2019s interviews in the TV station were done by her.When Xin Siyue hadn\u2019t moved, the beautiful Miss Lu urged her, \u201cHurry up. I don\u2019t have time to waste on something like this!\u201dAlthough Xin Siyue rarely talked to her, she had heard about her from her other colleagues. She knew that she was a rude and unreasonable person so she didn\u2019t bother to argue with her.On the way to the Chief Editor\u2019s office, Xin Siyue saw the beautiful Miss Lu heading for the same place. She became more and more curious. What was the matter?When Xin Siyue received the project plan for this week\u2019s interview episode, she looked shockingly at the Chief Editor. \u201cChief Editor, what is this?\u201d\u201cTime-wise, we might be hurrying it but I believe in your ability, Siyue.\u201d\u201cChief Editor, what are you trying to say?\u201d Xin Siyue was faintly worried.\u201cIt\u2019s what you think. Sheng Wenyang is a famous designer from the jewelry industry. From what I know, she returned two days ago. It was very surprising that we were able to set an appointment for the interview easily. However, Designer Sheng said that she agreed to the interview but wanted someone familiar as her partner. She even mentioned your name, hoping you can host this episode. We already proofread the initial draft for the questions to be asked during the interview. When you record this tonight, you just need to talk according to the script.\u201dXin Siyue hesitated, \u201cNo, Chief Editor, I\u2019m not really familiar with Sheng Wenyang.\u201d Plus, don\u2019t mention that they weren\u2019t familiar. They hadn\u2019t spoken a sentence with one another in private before. At most, she introduced her appearance on stage during the anniversary of the college. In addition, it\u2019s not that she was unfamiliar with her. In the original book, even before the female lead returned, she hadn\u2019t seen her.Where did Sheng Wenyang get the illusion that they were familiar with each other?Her intuition told her it was the main culprit, Chen Sinan.Sheng Wenyang must\u2019ve detected something! That is definitely what happened!She concentrated on analyzing this when she heard Miss Lu say, \u201cHost Xin, are you trying to make excuses? Ever since I entered the TV Station and took over this program, I had no intentions of letting other hosts host this. If it wasn\u2019t for your friend who wanted you to host this episode, you think that I would look upon you based on your qualifications, and feel comfortable in giving you control over the program?\u201dEver since Xin Siyue debuted and entered the hosting career, she never hosted interviewing programs. But just because she never tried it before doesn\u2019t mean she was willing to be looked down upon by other people!\u201cHost Lu, why must you speak like this?\u201d When Xin Siyue finished, she turned her head around to reply to the Chief Editor without looking at her expression. \u201cI will do my best on this episode\u2019s program!\u201dThe Chief Editor smiled and nodded his head. \u201cOk, I believe in your abilities. Quickly prepare for this. Remember to change your clothes and dress yourself up after dinner, which is around six pm.\u201d\u201cOk, thank you Chief Editor.\u201dWhen Xin Siyue was about to turn and leave, she heard Miss Lu humph. She was infuriated and wanted to walk around her. When she detected Miss Lu\u2019s high heels kicking forward, wanting to trip her, Xin Siyue agily dodged this.Xin Siyue turned around and glared coldly at her. Then, she left without looking back.When she returned to her office, she felt her scalp going numb from looking at the rough draft.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
