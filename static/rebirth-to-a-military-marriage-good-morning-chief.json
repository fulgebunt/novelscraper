Even the traffic flow was low. Everyone was in cooler places to avoid the heat.Wearing a washed-out white shirt and pair of a dull suit pants, a woman dashed towards the Second People\u2019s Hospital.Her hair was plastered to her sweaty face and her cheeks had an unusual flush. Obviously, she was badly scorched by the heat.Her white shirt was wet due to sweating and she felt uncomfortable. But Qiao Nan had no time to worry about all that. She held tightly to her bag, where 100,000 yuan could be found.She had sold all her valuables and painstakingly raised this sum of money. Her elder sister\u2019s surgery cost 200,000 yuan. She would have to find a way to raise the remaining 100,000 yuan.Headed straight to the ward, as Qiao Nan\u2019s hands touched the doorknob, she overheard the conversation between the mother-daughter pair in the room.\u201cMom, it was all Qiao Nan\u2019s fault. If not for her, Da Jun would not have divorced me.\u201d This was the voice of Qiao Zijin, Qiao Nan\u2019s sister.\u201cStop crying, I\u2019ve already disciplined Qiao Nan,\u201d said Ding Jiayi, Qiao Nan\u2019s mother, as she held her elder daughter\u2019s head, as her heart ached.Qiao Nan, who was standing outside the room, was shocked. Hadn\u2019t her sister had an affair which resulted in Chen Jun divorcing her? But what did this have to do with her?At the thought of Chen Jun, Qiao Nan felt a tinge of sadness.Chen Jun was Qiao Nan\u2019s boyfriend. However, Qiao Zijin became pregnant with his child. Ding Jiayi chastised Qiao Nan for this. She said that Qiao Nan had malicious intent and was a small brute with no conscience as she not only snatched her own sister\u2019s boyfriend, but also forced her to abort the foetus.Eventually, Qiao Nan had to give up the relationship with Chen Jun and allowed them to be together.\u201cMom, Da Jun divorced me. My child is also not by my side and I have contracted this kind of illness. What should I do? Mom, I do not wish to die. I have not fulfilled my filial piety as a daughter to you. I really do not wish to die.\u201dIn the ward, Qiao Zijin hugged Ding Jiayi and cried. She was still so young and had a bright future ahead of her. Qiao Zijin really did not wish to die.Ding Jiayi was extremely touched when she heard her elder daughter\u2019s intent to be filial to her despite being seriously ill.Ding Jiayi patted Qiao Zijin\u2019s back and said, \u201cNo. Mom will not let anything happen to you. Owing to Qiao Nan, that wretched girl, Mom has already raised the expenses for you. When we have 200,000 yuan, you will recover soon.\u201dShortly after Qiao Zijin divorced Chen Jun, she had kidney failure and needed an immediate kidney transplant.However, Qiao Zijin was in the wrong in this marriage as she had an extra-marital affair. Hence, she left the marriage without any maintenance or marital compensation. Now that she had contracted this illness, she had no means to pay for her medical bills.Although Qiao Nan had been used to her mother\u2019s favoritism, she could not help but feel hurt by this conversation.She was already 40 years old. After she broke up with Chen Jun, she never had another relationship. It was not that she was not willing to, it was because her mother would not let her.Over the years, she had given most of her income to her mother. Her mother used the money that she had earned and bought a 150 square-meter suite for her elder sister. She had to stay in a 90 square-meter rented apartment.She paid all her parents\u2019 household bills. Everytime her sister visited her parent\u2019s home, her sister brought something but also took away more when she left.At this age, she was still not married and had been teased by others as being left on the shelves. Qiao Nan knew that her mother would not let her get married as she wanted her to continue giving her household allowances.But this was her own mother. Every time she planned to attend a match-making session, her mother would make a fuss and threaten to commit suicide. Qiao Nan had no choice.All these efforts seemed to be in vain when she heard her mother calling her a wretched girl. Especially after she heard that Qiao Zijin was pushing the entire blame of her extra-marital affair and divorce to her, she held on tightly to the money in her hand. Suddenly, she did not feel like giving the money to Qiao Zijin.Before Qiao Nan left, she heard the last conversation which left her in utter despair.\u201cMom, it\u2019s not so easy. What if I cannot find a compatible kidney even after Qiao Nan has raised the money? The doctor said that as long my next-of-kin could donate a kidney to me, the match would be better and my body would not face rejection so easily.\u201dIn the arms of Ding Jiayi, Qiao Zijin said pitifully, \u201cIf I could have a loved one\u2019s kidney, most likely I would be able to reduce my medical treatment expenses.\u201d\u201cIt would not be so easy to find, some people died before the opportunity came!\u201dQiao Zijin knew very well that money alone was not enough to solve her problem and allow her to continue to live on. She had to find other alternatives.\u201cWould you like me to go for the blood test?\u201d Ding Jiayi asked with some hesitation.Qiao Zijin shook her head again and again. Her mother was already old and her kidney was definitely not as good and healthy. Since she would be having a transplant, she might as well get a good one. \u201cMom, you gave birth to and raised me, I can\u2019t bear to let you go under the knives. Same for Dad as well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Ding Jiayi thought for a moment, and her eyes lit up. \u201cWhen the wretched girl comes, I\u2019ll get her to do the blood test. She is your biological sister. I am sure it will be suitable!\u201d\u201cSounds good. But Qiao Nan may not agree. After all, this is a kidney.\u201d Qiao Zijin had a scheming look in her eyes.For the sake of survival and as a precautionary measure, she would never let Qiao Nan reject this.\u201cMiss Qiao, you came to see your sister. Why won\u2019t you go in?\u201d Qiao Zijin and Ding Jiayi heard the nurse\u2019s voice at the door during the conversation.Qiao Zijin\u2019s face changed greatly. \u201cMom\u2026 was our earlier conversation overhead by Qiao Nan, that wretched girl?\u201dWithout a word, Ding Jiayi got up and ran out. She saw Qiao Nan\u2019s back and shouted her name loudly.Qiao Nan heard Ding Jiayi\u2019s shouts. She refused to turn back or stop. Tears were rolling down uncontrollably. She was heartbroken.For the sake of her mother and sister, she did not even have a home of her own. However, they not only schemed for her money, but also wanted her kidney.Ding Jiayi might not have fully understood Qiao Zijin\u2019s words, but Qiao Nan did. The more she did, the more she hated. She felt that even if she had owed the Qiao family, she had sacrificed enough!Perhaps maternal love was indeed \u201cnoble\u201d. Seeing that the younger daughter had run away, Ding Jiayi was afraid that the elder daughter\u2019s illness would not be cured. Ding Jiayi\u2019s steps quickened, caught up with Qiao Nan and fiercely grabbed Qiao Nan\u2019s hair.\u201cYou wretched girl! You obviously don\u2019t have a conscience. You know that your sister is having such a serious illness, and you still want to leave her in the lurch. Come here\u2026\u201dQiao Nan\u2019s head hurt and just as she tried to tell her mom that this was dangerous on the street, a car came towards her.There was a deafening crash. Qiao Nan was in so much pain that she could not speak. She forced herself to open her eyes as she wanted to see how her mother was.Having released her hand when she saw the incoming car, Ding Jiayi was really scared. Seeing her younger daughter lying in a pool of blood, she ran over and said, \u201cQiao Nan, you\u2026 if you were dead, it might be a good thing too. At least you can help your sister. Zijin would have both kidney and money!\u201dIf her younger daughter was killed, the person who hit her must compensate them.When she heard Ding Jiayi\u2019s words, Qiao Nan gave Ding Jiayi a deadly stare. Before the ambulance arrived, she would have been driven to the grave by her!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qiao Nan felt like she was on fire, as if her entire body was burning to ashes.After a long struggle, Qiao Nan finally opened her eyes. She did not see a white ward, but an old and familiar room.\u201cMom, Nan Nan is sick, is it alright that we leave her alone?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Your sister is very tough and used to a hard life. Such a minor illness will not take her life. Moreover, she will be starting school the day after. It is a good thing that she is sick, so that she can\u2019t enroll for school.\u201dConcerned about matters related to her elder daughter, Ding Jiayi figured that if her younger daughter missed the opportunity to enrol for school due to the illness, she could then cajole the wretched girl to give up her studies and find a job to earn income.\u201cMom, this watermelon is so sweet. Take a bite too.\u201d Satisfied with what she had heard, Qiao Zijin smiled and fed Ding Jiayi a mouthful of watermelon.When she heard the dialogue between the mother-daughter pair, Qiao Nan, who had a high fever, finally knew where she was.Time had turned back to 25 years ago and she was back at the house of the Qiao family. The then 15-year-old Qiao Nan had a high fever and missed the school\u2019s enrolment deadline. It was the year that she was cajoled by her mother to quit school and find a job to support Qiao Zijin.That year, the night before Qiao Nan\u2019s fever, it was raining cats and dogs. Because it was autumn, the weather was particularly cold.Qiao Nan remembered that she had covered herself with a blanket before she went to sleep that night. However, when she was awake and already feeling sick, the entire blanket was found at the end of the bed.While Qiao Nan vaguely recalled that, when the rain was at its heaviest in the middle of the night, someone seemed to have entered her room.Eventually, Qiao Nan was not covered by the blanket. Even the window by the bedside was wide open.If this was not the case, Qiao Nan would not have gotten a cold and fever.In her previous life, Qiao Nan always believed that someone had come to her room. As for the window that was closed before she slept and opened subsequently, she assumed that it was an illusion \u2013 that she was too sick and confused.But this time, Qiao Nan did not think that was the case.\u201cLast night\u201d, someone must have been to her room. Not only had the person removed her blanket, but they had also intentionally opened the window. The motive was to cause her to fall sick so that she would miss the school enrolment deadline!Just when Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin were spending happy time together, there was a loud bang that stunned both of them.\u201cNan, Nan Nan?\u201d Qiao Zijin\u2019s face, who was happily holding and eating half the watermelon, turned stiff. She felt extremely awkward as she held the spoon, and was undecided on whether to continue to hold or put it down.Seeing the half of the watermelon in Qiao Zijin\u2019s hand, Qiao Nan laughed to herself.Qiao Zijin was spoilt by their mother. Since a young age, she was overbearing and selfish. Qiao Zijin had a habit when eating watermelon. She like to hold half the watermelon and eat it with a spoon all by herself.But it was in the 1980s now. Their financial situation was not as good. So every time Ding Jiayi bought watermelons, she would tell Qiao Nan and Qiao Zijin that she had only bought half the fruit.But Qiao Nan saw it with her own eyes that Qiao Zijin was holding half the watermelon and eating it.Qiao Zijin was allowed to eat half a watermelon. When it came to Qiao Nan, she would be lucky if she could have a \u201cstrand\u201d of watermelon to eat!\u201cYou wretched girl, why did you kick the door. Who do you want to scare?\u201d Ding Jiayi\u2019s face, that displayed no sign of guilt, turned black. She pointed at Qiao Nan\u2019s nose and started scolding.Qiao Nan was hanging on despite her sickness, \u201cI have a fever. Where is the fever medicine?\u201d\u201cWhat fever medicine? You\u2019ve already finished it. There isn\u2019t any left.\u201d Ding Jiayi\u2019s eyes had a tinge of guilt as she said that.Ignoring Ding Jiayi, Qiao Nan went to look for the medicine. In her previous life, she did not take any medicine and her fever worsened. She was not sent to the hospital in time and almost had meningitis.Because of this, her family incurred extra medical expenses. This made her believed her mother\u2019s words that she had depleted the family funds to cure her illness. That was the reason that she quit school and worked to support Qiao Zijin.\u201cYou wretched girl, what are you looking for?!\u201d Qiao Nan\u2019s action had angered Ding Jiayi. Ding Jiayi grabbed and pulled back Qiao Nan\u2019s hair with her left hand, while she slapped Qiao Nan\u2019s face with her right hand.The sound of the slap was cold and deafening.With the slap in her face, Qiao Nan\u2019s ears were buzzing. Her face did not hurt but her nose was sore and painful. Her nose started bleeding uncontrollably, like an open faucet, staining the collar of her shirt.\u201cIf you are sick, go and lie down. Stop being a devil!\u201d Ding Jiayi gathered that Qiao Nan would not be physically strong enough. She wanted to drag Qiao Nan back into the room and let Qiao Nan continue to sleep. No matter what, she would not let Qiao Nan have her medicine.If the wretched girl recovered, she would definitely enrol in school and waste their money.Ding Jiayi intended to let Qiao Nan continue to be sick until a month after school commenced.Want to have your medicine? Wishful thinking!At this time, Qiao Nan saw through Ding Jiayi\u2019s plan. She would not be willing to concede. She banged her head against Ding Jiayi\u2019s body.This move did not hurt but was too unexpected. Ding Jiayi was stunned and withdrew the hand that she used to pull Qiao Nan\u2019s hair. Qiao Nan took the opportunity to run out of the house.\u201cThe wretched girl!\u201d Ding Jiayi, who was a few steps behind, stomped her feet and shouted, \u201cIf you have the guts, don\u2019t ever come back!\u201dThis was the first time that Qiao Zijin saw Qiao Nan rebelling. She was stunned. \u201cMom, what happened to Nan Nan? Didn\u2019t she used to obey you on everything?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother about her.\u201d Ding Jiayi patted her elder daughter\u2019s hand and did not seem affected. \u201cDespite having a fever, she ran out and refused to rest at home. She is intentionally looking for death.\u201dQiao Nan, whose head was burning, only wanted to run, but she had no idea what to do after that.Qiao Nan bumped into someone. The nose that had not stopped bleeding felt more sore and her tears started to roll.\u201cBe careful.\u201d It was a man with a deep and low voice. Compared to the hot June season, the voice that came to Qiao Nan\u2019s ears was cool. Qiao Nan\u2019s waist seemed to have fallen onto an arm that was as sturdy as steel.As Qiao Nan regained her footing, she came to her senses only after shaking her head three times. When she looked up, he saw a pair of cool eyes that looked as sharp as a blade.\u201cYou have a fever?\u201d the man frowned when he came into contact with Qiao Nan\u2019s body. When he saw the blood on the Qiao Nan\u2019s collar, his sharp lips turned straight. \u201cFollow me,\u201d he said.Qiao Nan followed the man, feeling confused. It was only after she was seated on a soft sofa that she regained her senses.\u201cFever medicine.\u201d The man\u2019s cold voice came, as he handed her the medicine in one hand and held a cup in the other.Given her situation, Qiao Nan had no time to be shy about this. She took the medicine from the man\u2019s hand and swallowed it. She then looked up at the man carefully.The man was very handsome \u2013 a chiseled face, thick eyebrows that exuded a sense of justice, straight and upright nose, charming but forbidding eyes. His lips were pursed, like he was unhappy. Qiao Nan could not help feeling a little nervous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Same as Qiao Nan, Zhai Sheng belonged to the group of children who stayed in the same quad. He was different to everyone else.He had done well since he was a child. Not only had he studied well, he also had a good physique and joined the army early. Unlike others who simply gave up their studies to join the army, Zhai Sheng continued to study and juggled both. He had not only participated in various fitness regimes in the camp, but he had also attained a Higher Diploma.Because Zhai Sheng had both qualifications and experience, he progressed very quickly in his career based on his own ability without relying on his family, until he had attained the highest position. Even Qiao Nan\u2019s mother was often proud to have lived in the same quad as Zhai Sheng.\u201cThank you, Brother Zhai.\u201d After recognizing the prominent man in front of her, Qiao Nan realized that her nose had stopped bleeding and her hands were clean. However, her clothes were still red with stains in the chest area.The person who had helped Qiao Nan to stop the nosebleed was, of course, Zhai Sheng.\u201cNo worries. You just took the medicine and you need to rest. Sleep for a while.\u201d Zhai Sheng nodded coldly and started reading the document, written fully in English, that was in his hand.When Zhai Sheng said that, Qiao Nan felt drowsy. Upon closing her eyes, her body collapsed and she fell asleep in seconds.Zhai Sheng looked up while reading and saw that Qiao Nan had fallen asleep. He took the thin blanket and covered her. While one was sleeping, the other was reading a book. There was a harmonious atmosphere as they were together.This sleep took up the entire afternoon for Qiao Nan. When she woke up, the drug had taken its effect and also caused her to break out in a sweat. When she opened her eyes, Qiao Nan obviously felt more comfortable.\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d Upon hearing Qiao Nan\u2019s movement, Zhai Sheng\u2019s eyes lifted and looked at Qiao Nan\u2019s face.\u201cThank\u2026 thank you, brother Zhai.\u201d Gazing at Zhai Sheng\u2019s eyes, which exuded an aura of power, Qiao Nan felt stressed and stuttered as she spoke.\u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d Zhai Sheng asked. From memory, Uncle Qiao\u2019s younger daughter did not stutter.\u201cNo, no,\u201d Qiao Nan said with some guilt. She was thinking that there were few children in the quad who were not afraid of this face of Zhai Sheng.She clearly recalled that when Zhai Sheng was about 10 years old, his face was small, fair and tender. In other words he should turn into a fair and handsome boy 20 to 30 years later.However, since Zhai Sheng had joined the army, his fair face had tanned significantly with exposure to the sun, and it looked more scary than when he was a child.\u201cIt\u2019s late now.\u201d Zhai Sheng did not expose Qiao Nan\u2019s lie.Qiao Nan\u2019s face was white. Her two small hands were nervously clenched into fists on both sides. \u201cWell, then I am going home,\u201d she said.Seeing the pitiful expression on that small face of Qiao Nan, he was reminded of the kitten that he saw when he was out on a field mission during a rainy day in autumn. His heart softened and said \u201cIf you face any troubles, you can come to me.\u201dQiao Nan looked at Zhai Sheng with surprise. \u201cSure. Thank you, Brother Zhai.\u201dThereafter, Qiao Nan was embarrassed to stay in Zhai Sheng\u2019s house any longer. She had to return to her home.Not long after Qiao Nan left, Zhai Sheng\u2019s elder sister Zhai Hua returned home. Zhai Hua sat on the sofa and was about to ask Zhai Sheng why he had come back, when she saw blood on the sofa and was shocked. \u201cZhai Sheng, are you hurt? What happened?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Zhai Sheng frowned. \u201cThe blood was left by the younger daughter of the Qiao family.\u201d\u201cWait, no, why do you have blood on your clothes too?!\u201d Seeing the blood on both Zhai Sheng\u2019s chest and sofa, Zhai Hua eyes flashed sharply. \u201cZhai Sheng, tell me honestly, did you bring a girl home? Were you so eager that you couldn\u2019t wait until you were in the bedroom?\u201dZhai Sheng\u2019s wooden expression changed.As he looked at the excited Zhai Hua, he sneered and said, \u201cIf mom and dad knew that you were reading this type of book, what do you think would happen?\u201d\u201cOh, today\u2019s weather is really hot. I did not see and don\u2019t know anything, my brother. I am going to take a shower.\u201d Zhai Hua\u2019s face turned pale. She dared to be rude in front of her brother. But in front of her parents, she was as obedient as a rabbit.As Zhai Hua was going to take a shower and Zhai Sheng softened his raised eyebrows to continue with his book, Zhai Hua\u2019s face blocked his view. \u201cNo matter what, we are siblings. Are you really not going to tell me which girl you ruined? Our family does not tolerate a rogue like this. If the girl comes knocking at our door, your reputation will be ruined. It would be hard for you to continue working in the army. Since you slept with her, why don\u2019t you marry her?\u201dIn the face of Zhai Hua\u2019s untrue accusation, Zhai Sheng said only one word. \u201cScram.\u201dThereafter, he went back to his room without a care about Zhai Hua\u2019s reaction. He changed the clothes that had been stained with Qiao Nan\u2019s blood to avoid causing further misunderstanding.Qiao Nan was heading towards her house with a heavy heart.After the fever subsided, Qiao Nan\u2019s head was more sober. She recollected the memories of that entire year.Qiao Nan was born into a respected family.It was just that her grandparents did not survive through the 1970s. After their death, her father joined the army with the help of her grandfather\u2019s good friend, and married Ding Jiayi.The older generation were usually patriarchal, especially Ding Jiayi. When she gave birth to her first child \u2013 Qiao Zijin, Ding Jiayi consoled herself that she would bear a son next.When Ding Jiayi was preparing to have a second child, a national planning policy was launched.In order to have a son, Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi were expelled from the party and lost their cradle-to-grave jobs. They were pregnant with a second child but it was their younger daughter \u2013 Qiao Nan.This year would be Qiao Nan\u2019s third year at the high school. Qiao Zijin had taken the middle school examination and would be enrolled in high school soon.Qiao Nan attended school earlier in the morning. Nevertheless, Qiao Nan had always performed well and was consistently ranked top in school. On the contrary, Qiao Zijin\u2019s results in school were not good. Qiao Zijin was dissatisfied about this.In the previous life, Ding Jiayi lied to Qiao Nan. She said the family\u2019s money was depleted because she was sick. Even the money for Qiao Zijin\u2019s school enrolment was borrowed.But a few years later, Qiao Nan found out that their savings had not been used for her medical expenses. It was her mother who had taken it to use for bribery for Qiao Zijin\u2019s sake.Since her fever had subsided a lot, Qiao Nan breathed a sigh of relief. At least in this life, her mother could no longer hold her to ransom with her illness.In this life, regardless of the situation, she would not quit her studies and work to support Qiao Zijin. She would lead a life of her own!When Qiao Nan reached home, Qiao Dongliang was pushing his bicycle home as he was off-duty during this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he looked back, he saw his younger daughter. Due to her cold and fever, her younger daughter looked downhearted and lifeless. The blood on her collar made Qiao Dongliang jump. \u201cHow did you get this?\u201dBefore Qiao Nan could reply, Qiao Dongliang said.\u201dLet\u2019s go home first and wash up. We will talk later.\u201dHaving said that, Qiao Dongliang carried Qiao Nan on his bicycle and rode home.\u201cDongliang, you are back. Oh, Nan Nan, what happened?\u201d In the small quad of Qiao\u2019s home, a 40 to 50-year-old woman was holding a basket of eggs in her hand. Her eyes widened when she saw Qiao Nan. \u201cHave you been bullied? Why are you covered in blood?\u201d\u201cAunt Li.\u201d Qiao Nan\u2019s hands and feet were wobbly as she jumped and alighted from the bicycle. Fortunately, her father held on to her and she did not fall.Ding Jiayi, who was taking out the money for the eggs, saw this scene and her expression turned black. \u201cAunt Li, this is the money for the eggs, please take it.\u201dAunt Li took the money, counted it, and said, \u201cGood, your family\u2019s Nan Nan is pretty but unfortunately a little skinny. You have to give her some supplements.\u201dQiao Dongliang touched Qiao Nan\u2019s forehead and found that the fever condition was better than in the morning (before he left for work), but the forehead was still a little hot. He was not pleased when he looked at Ding Jiayi. \u201cNan Nan is still sick, why did you let her go out?!\u201dAunt Li had not left. Faced with the accusation by Qiao Dongliang, Ding Jiayi was embarrassed. \u201cWhat do you mean by this? It\u2019s the wretched girl. She was mischievous and insisted on going out. How could I control this \u201clord\u201d?!\u201dWhen Qiao Nan heard this, she cried, \u201cDad, I had a high fever and was in a daze. But Mom and Sister did not care, they were sitting outside and eating watermelon. I got up myself and wanted to take some fever medicine but Mom said there was none left. I wanted to look for it but Mom refused to let me. She pulled my hair and gave me a slap. All the blood from my nose-bleeding was caused by the slap.\u201dAunt Li\u2019s expression was shocked as she looked at Ding Jiayi in disbelief. She was not sure whether to stay or leave.Qiao Dongliang\u2019s expression changed. \u201cNan Nan, have you taken any medicine?\u201d\u201cOf course she has!\u201d Ding Jiayi raised her voice.Qiao Nan, without looking at Ding Jiayi, shook her head with certainty. \u201cNo, I have been lying in bed, nobody cares about me. I haven\u2019t taken any medicine or drunk any water.\u201dQiao Dongliang was anxious that his younger daughter had not even taken medicine. He wanted to quickly take her to the hospital. \u201cNan Nan, do you have any strength to take the bicycle? I will take you to the hospital.\u201dIn the morning, when Qiao Dongliang saw that his usually diligent younger daughter had not gotten up, he went to her room and found that she had a fever.But his wife said that she would take care of her, so Qiao Dongliang was not too worried. He did not expect to hear this from his daughter when he was back.Ding Jiayi reached out and grabbed the front of the bicycle. \u201cWhich hospital are you going to? Don\u2019t spend money!\u201dQiao Dongliang sneered. \u201cI don\u2019t make much money, but I still have money for my daughter to see a doctor.\u201dDing Jiayi\u2019s face was stunned.\u201dOld Qiao, I don\u2019t mean that.\u201dShe did not look down on Qiao Dongliang or resent that he did not earn much money. It was because she was not willing to spend money on the wretched girl. Furthermore, Qiao Zijin would need a big sum of money for her studies.Soon, Ding Jiayi\u2019s attitude softened, but she still refused to let Qiao Dongliang send Qiao Nan to the hospital.\u201cI mean, I really gave her the medicine. She was in such a daze that she couldn\u2019t remember it. It may be that the medicine has not taken effect. She will be fine after a while. You don\u2019t need to go to the hospital to spend money unnecessarily.\u201d\u201cDongliang, I am leaving,\u201d Aunt Li finally said. She quickly said goodbye. But before she left, she said, \u201cDongliang, both are your daughters and there should not be favoritism. Nan Nan is a grown up. You do not hit a person\u2019s face. Furthermore, Nan Nan was sick; how could Jiayi do this to Nan Nan?\u201dAt the thought of the blood from the nosebleed on Qiao Nan\u2019s collar, Aunt Li looked at Ding Jiayi with disapproval. Ding Jiayi was mad and wanted to tell Aunt Li to scram.\u201cAunt Li, you can rest assured. This will not happen.\u201d Qiao Dongliang shot a look of blame to Ding Jiayi before sending Aunt Li away courteously.Qiao Dongliang took his daughter back to the room and sat down, gave her a basin of hot water for her to wash up and change her dirty clothes.When Qiao Zijin, who was hiding in the house, heard and saw the situation, she gave Qiao Dongliang a sensible smile. She then helped Qiao Dongliang to take care of Qiao Nan.Seeing that the elder daughter was so sensible, the anger of Qiao Dongliang was lessened greatly.When Qiao Nan was changing her clothes, Qiao Dongliang looked at Ding Jiayi and said, \u201cNan Nan\u2019s fever has not completely subsided. Where is the medicine? Give her another round.\u201dQiao Nan had just finished changing her clothes. Without a word, she stared straight at Ding Jiayi and wanted to find out what she would say.Ding Jiayi was so angry that she looked at Qiao Nan and felt that he had given birth to a white-eyed wolf. When she saw her parents quarreling, not only did she not help, but she also wished that Qiao Dongliang would give her a scolding. \u201cWe have finished it. There is no more medicine left.\u201dDing Jiayi had not forgotten what she had said to Qiao Nan at noon. The words must tally with that in the afternoon.\u201cHas all of it been consumed?\u201d Qiao Dongliang raised his eyebrows and said in a disbelieving tone,\u201dI clearly remember that there was still half of the medicine left. You said it was gone?\u201dWhen she heard Ding Jiayi say this, Qiao Nan was very sure that she had not had any. Where had the other half gone? The reason why her fever was better was due to the goodwill of Zhai Sheng.However, she looked for the medicine and could not find it.Qiao Nan pursed her beautiful little mouth, blinked her bright eyes, and suddenly thought of a possibility. She headed towards the kitchen of the house.\u201cNan Nan, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Qiao Zijin felt that Qiao Nan was behaving oddly and wanted to stop her.When Qiao Zijin saw Qiao Nan going to the kitchen, she was at a loss. She felt that something was amiss and quickly pulled Qiao Nan\u2019s hand. \u201cNan Nan, you are sick now, you need to rest in bed and take medicine. No, there is no medicine left. Let\u2019s wait for dad to buy you some. After you take it, you will be fine tomorrow.\u201dQiao Nan firmly halted her steps and stared at Qiao Zijin with her deep and dark eyes. Her look made Qiao Zijin felt guilty, to the extent that Qiao Zijin\u2019s hairs stood up.Seeing Qiao Nan\u2019s attitude towards Qiao Zijin, her parents could not help but frown.Without waiting for Ding Jiayi to open her mouth to discipline her, Qiao Nan pushed away Qiao Zijin\u2019s hand and ran into the kitchen. She then dumped all the trash in the dustbin on the floor.Qiao Zijin screamed. Impossible. Qiao Nan could not have known.At the thought of something, Ding Jiayi\u2019s expression changed. She wanted to hold Qiao Nan back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHowever, before Ding Jiayi could reach Qiao Nan and order her to go away, Qiao Nan had found what she was looking for.When Qiao Nan saw the fever medicine that was retrieved from the dustbin, she could not help it and her tears started rolling again.Her mother was too heartless. There was apparently fever medicine in the house but she would rather throw it away than to let her have it. She would rather her be sick than enroll in school.Qiao Dongliang, who has been following behind, also saw the medicine in the dustbin. He recognized it as the fever medicine that he had seen in the morning. \u201cYou told me that was none left? What is this?!\u201dDing Jiayi, whose lie was exposed, blushed with embarrassment and then simply shouted, \u201cThe medicine has expired. I can\u2019t possibly give my own daughter expired medicine. What if she gets ill because of this!\u201dQiao Nan firmly wiped away the tears on her face. \u201cMom, you just said you had already given me medicine? So, did I take the medicine or has it expired?\u201dQiao Nan then realized that her illness and quitting of school was a ploy right from the start!\u201dDing Jiayi held her neck straight. \u201cExpired. If it has not expired, why do you still have a fever after taking the medicine? I am your biological mother. Would I harm you by giving you expired medicine?\u201dQiao Dongliang was exasperated but also wanted to laugh at his wife\u2019s ridiculous words. \u201cI know that this medicine has expired and there is no use taking it. But you just told me not to send Nan Nan to the hospital. You said Nan Nan would get well soon and we don\u2019t need to spend the money unnecessarily.\u201dHaving said something that contradicted herself, did his wife\u2019s pride hurt?\u201cDad, the medicine did not expire.\u201d Qiao Nan took the medicine and ran to Qiao Dongliang. \u201cYou see, it did not expire!\u201dThe expiration date of the medicine was printed on the back of its plastic packaging. The date clearly stated that there were a few more months to expiry.This time, Qiao Dongliang was furious. \u201cDing Jiayi, what were you thinking!\u201dObviously, there was medicine for their daughter, and she claimed that it had expired!\u201cYou also said that you are Nan Nan\u2019s own mother. Does a mother behave in this manner? You would rather throw the medicine away than to give it to our daughter. And you said it has expired? Let me ask you again. Have you given the medicine to Nan Nan today!\u201dQiao Dongliang was in the army. He thus exuded a sense of influence. He looked extremely scary when his face was as fierce as a tiger.Ding Jiayi trembled. Her face was stunned and she could not answer for a long time.Qiao Zijin quickly stepped before Qiao Dongliang. \u201cDad, it was my fault, it was all my fault. I must have seen it wrongly. I told mom that the medicine had expired. Mom had given Nan Nan the medicine. It was only thereafter that she realized that it had expired. She then threw it away. I\u2019m the one to be blamed, not mom. \u201dWith the elder daughter\u2019s support and cover for Ding Jiayi, she seemed to regather her strength. \u201cShe is my daughter. How could I not feel concerned? It\u2019s just a fever. She will recover after a good sweat. I don\u2019t know why you have to kick up such a big fuss and shout at me so furiously. Both old and young ones have no conscience.\u201d\u201cYou.\u201d Qiao Dongliang was not good at words. Although he felt that something was amiss, he could not refute Ding Jiayi. \u201cNan Nan, let\u2019s go. I will take you to the hospital.\u201dQiao Nan ran to Qiao Dongliang and said. \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cMom?\u201d said Qiao Zijin, clutching and shaking Ding Jiayi\u2019s arm.\u201cDad is going to the hospital with Qiao Nan. I don\u2019t know how much it will cost. The money is needed for other things and can\u2019t be wasted.\u201dDing Jiayi, who had come back to her senses, rushed forward to the front of Qiao Dongliang\u2019s bicycle and held the handle to prevent him from leaving.Qiao Dongliang\u2019s bicycle swayed. Fortunately, he managed to stabilize himself by placing his foot on the ground. If not, he would had fallen down. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked.\u201cIsn\u2019t it just a fever? I said, she will be well after a good sweat. Take a look at the situation now. Don\u2019t go to the hospital!\u201d Ding Jiayi insisted. \u201cA trip to the hospital. Don\u2019t you need money?\u201dQiao Nan leaned gently on the back of Qiao Dongliang and said softly,\u201dDad.\u201dQiao Dongliang\u2019s face was red with fury. \u201cDing Jiayi, did you do it deliberately? You said that you are concerned for your daughter. Nan Nan has a fever and you said she will be well after a good sweat. I can\u2019t believe you said that. The last time\u2026 I won\u2019t talk to you now. Hurry, leave me alone, or don\u2019t blame me for being rude!\u201dQiao Dongliang remembered the last time his elder daughter had a cold. She only had a couple of coughs and his wife had been so anxious.If not for the fear of upsetting Qiao Nan, Qiao Dongliang would have mentioned this matter to chastise his wife.Qiao Dongliang was so angry that he grabbed his wife\u2019s hand, flung it away, then pedaled his bicycle towards the hospital.\u201cEnemy, every one of them is an enemy.\u201d Ding Jiayi almost slipped and fell. At the thought of her husband who was angry with her due to her younger daughter, Ding Jiayi was furious. \u201cI knew that this day would come. I really shouldn\u2019t have given birth to her!\u201dIf she didn\u2019t have this daughter, she and her husband would still have their cradle-to-grave jobs.When Qiao Nan was born, the couple lost their stable jobs, and as a result, they had to live in this quad with no dignity. This daughter was out to ruin their lives!\u201cMom, go home.\u201d People had made jokes upon seeing Ding Jiayi\u2019s scolding at the door. Qiao Zijin quickly held Ding Jiayi and brought her back to the house. \u201d Nan Nan\u2019s fever will definitely subside. What is going to happen?\u201dIf Qiao Nan was to continue her studies, what about her tuition fees?\u201cRest assured. Your dad\u2019s words are not final. As long as I can convince the wretched girl to decide not to study, your dad will have no way to stop this.\u201d Ding Jiayi signed heavily, patted the elder daughter\u2019s hand as she consoled her.Having lived with the man for many years, Ding Jiayi understood her husband well.Therefore, the most important thing for her now was to find a way to deal with the wretched girl and make her quit school voluntarily.\u201cMom, you are so good to me, I will count on you. When I am successful, I will definitely be filial and treat you well.\u201d Qiao Zijin hugged Ding Jiayi\u2019s arms and smiled.Ding Jiayi laughed too. \u201cOf course, you are my daughter, if you are not successful, who will be. It does not matter that I do not have a son. I still have a good daughter!\u201d\u201dWhen she heard the word \u201cson\u201d, Qiao Zijin was very unhappy and pouted. Her mother would still have preferred a son.At that time, in order to give birth to Qiao Nan, her parents were willing to give up their cradle-to-grave jobs.She clearly remembered that, during that time, her pregnant mother was always holding her tummy and talking to her \u201cson\u201d. All the delicious food at home was not given to Qiao Zijin. It went to her mother\u2019s tummy for the sake of her younger \u201cbrother\u201d.In the end, she gave birth to a girl!If this had not happened, she would be the offspring of government officials. Their situation would not be the same.\u201cDoctor, how is my younger daughter?\u201d Elsewhere, after Qiao Dongliang took Qiao Nan to the hospital, he was very concerned about her condition.The doctor put away his stethoscope. He saw that Qiao Dongliang appeared strong and in the peak of health. He then looked at the young lady. With a strange look in his eyes, he said, \u201cThere is still fever. The effect of the medicine is slower. It is faster if we put her on a drip.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThen we will use the drip!\u201d Qiao Dongliang said without hesitation. He noticed that the doctor was looking strange. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, does my daughter have other problems?\u201dThe doctor thought for a while and asked, \u201cHow\u2019s your family doing?\u201d\u201cStill alright.\u201d Qiao Dongliang was stunned and his face was full of anxiety. \u201cHas my daughter contracted a serious illness that will incur high medical costs? It does not matter. If my daughter is sick, I must cure her regardless of how much money it takes. Doctor, please don\u2019t give up!\u201dQiao Nan, who was seated to one side, was also stunned. During her previous life, she suffered a lot and had many minor ailments but not major ones.The doctor\u2019s frown softened. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your daughter is not sick, it\u2019s just that\u2026 \u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d This doctor\u2019s speech was accompanied with heavy breathing. It made people anxious.\u201cYour daughter does not have any major illness. She is just a little malnourished, and had been in hunger. If this continues, her heath will eventually suffer.\u201dThe doctor\u2019s words made Qiao Dongliang\u2019s face blush red. It was not as if they were in the 1960s and 1970s, when they were dealing with famine.His younger daughter was actually malnourished.As it was not convenient for the male doctor to pose certain questions, they shouted for a female doctor to come in.After the female doctor came, she was direct in asking the questions. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201c15.\u201d\u201cHave you started menstruating yet? Have you taken a biology class, and know that the young ladies menstruate once a month?\u201dQiao Nan did not respond, Qiao Dongliang\u2019s face was red with embarrassment. \u201cNan Nan?\u201dQiao Nan looked dazed and she shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dIn fact, Qiao Nan was clearly aware that, to date, she had not had her first period.As per the doctor\u2019s account, she was malnourished. She often went hungry as she was growing up, and frequently had cramps when she was sleeping at night. Because of this, her menstruation only started when she was 18 years old.Qiao Zijin was two years older than her but had already had her first period three years ago. Qiao Nan had helped her wash the stained pants. In other words, Qiao Zijin started menstruating when she was 14 years old.Qiao Dongliang did not know his younger daughter\u2019s condition, although he knew about his elder daughter\u2019s condition due to his wife as she often mentioned matters regarding Qiao Zijin.Each time Qiao Zijin was having her period, his wife would wait on Qiao Zijin with hot water bottles and brown sugar soup.Qiao Dongliang calculated that when the eldest daughter \u201cgrew up,\u201d she was one year younger than the younger daughter now.Upon comparing, Qiao Dongliang was a little nervous. \u201cIs this too late for my daughter?\u201dThe female doctor said in an orderly manner, \u201cNot really, typically a young girl\u2019s first period will occur between the ages of 12 and 16. But your daughter is too skinny, she hasn\u2019t been getting enough to eat!\u201dIf this continued, her period may not come even when she has reached 16 years old.Qiao Dongliang was dumbfounded by the questions. Food, of course food was given. He could not possibly have given his younger daughter one less mouthful of food.However, both doctors said that the younger daughter was malnourished which delayed her puberty. Qiao Dongliang\u2019s face was full of shame.Although his family did not often feast on delicacies, there were always protein dishes on the table from time to time. Qiao Dongliang was puzzled as to how his younger daughter had become malnourished.Qiao Dongliang did not know how she had become malnourished, but Qiao Nan knew in her heart how it had came about.Since she was a child, her mother did not allow her to have her fill \u2013 she was only 50 to 70 percent full for each meal.She also had to attend school, which unfortunately was during the same time as her puberty.Qiao Nan clearly remembered that her tummy often started to rumble like thunder when the second lesson began in class.In the previous life, one of the reasons that she was cajoled by her mother to quit school and work is that she figured with money, she would at least be able to feed herself with proper meals.Oblivious to the awkward situation of the father and daughter, the female doctor said responsibly, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to supplement too much, however, you must at least prepare some protein dishes. The child is at the stage of puberty, no proteins, does your family favor boys more?\u201d\u201cNo, I have two daughters!\u201d Qiao Dongliang shook his head. There were no grounds for such favoritism. Both daughters should be equally well.At this moment, a very loud rumble came from Qiao Nan\u2019s tummy.As soon as she heard this, the female doctor knew that the child had been hungry for a long time. \u201cDid you eat today?\u201dQiao Nan\u2019s little face drooped, she looked listless.The female doctor was angry. \u201cWhat kind of parents are you? The child is sick and you did not give her food?\u201dQiao Nan was weak, her voice was as soft as that of a mosquito. \u201cDoctor, don\u2019t blame my dad, my dad goes to work and he doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cYour dad doesn\u2019t know. How about your mom? Or your mum doesn\u2019t care?\u201dWhen asked about her mother, Qiao Nan started to act dumb.At this juncture, Qiao Dongliang understood all that was happening. Qiao Dongliang had never felt this ashamed in his entire life, he wished that he could dig a hole in the ground and disappear into it.Putting aside the matter of the medicine, the younger daughter was not even given a meal?This\u2026Qiao Dongliang rubbed his face. \u201cDoctor, my child still has a fever, could you administer the drip while I get some food for her?\u201d\u201cSomething light. She has been hungry for a long time and should not eat too much at once.\u201d The doctor gave the prescription and stopped talking.Qiao Nan, whose head was still dizzy, was held and brought for the drip. Not long after, she smelt the aroma of porridge.Qiao Dongliang was full of sweat. \u201cThis bowl was borrowed from the hotel next door. Eat, I will return the bowl later.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d After Qiao Nan responded, she started eating the porridge in small mouthfuls.Seeing the younger daughter eating the porridge quietly, and thinking of what the doctor said, Qiao Dongliang did not feel good at all. \u201cNan Nan, is it because of your poor appetite?\u201dQiao Nan, who was drinking porridge, was stunned for a while. \u201cMy appetite is very good, but mom won\u2019t let me have more, saying that there isn\u2019t much rice in the house, and that it\u2019s better for girls to be thinner.\u201dHer father could not seem to believe that her mother would starve her to the extent of causing malnourishment, and therefore tried to find an excuse for the mother.\u201cI love to eat.\u201d Qiao Nan continued with a similar answer. \u201cBut Mom said you have to eat more as you work every day, it\u2019s hard, and my sister also has to eat more as she needs to study and work her brains out. Mom too as she worked hard for the family.\u201dAs for her, she made no contribution to the family and was considered an unimportant person leeching on the family, and was thus not fit to touch the better dishes.Qiao Dongliang took a deep breath and could not believe that his wife had said that to the younger daughter. \u201cWhen I\u2019m at home, each time there were protein dishes, I saw your mom giving you some.\u201dQiao Nan did not say a word. She finished drinking the bowl of porridge, then said. \u201cMom has said, even if she gave me the food I should be too ashamed to eat it. So she each time she passed me the food with her chopsticks, she would hint at me to go to the kitchen to put back the meat.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTherefore, every time, the meat that her dad saw in her bowl just went through her bowl once and returned to where it came from.After that, Qiao Nan and Qiao Dongliang did the same thing, that is, they rubbed their eyes to wipe away the wetness at the corner of their eyes.\u201cDad, am I yours and mom\u2019s biological daughter?\u201d After wiping the corner of her eyes, Qiao Nan could not help but ask. If she was adopted, she would feel better; after all, it was natural that the adopted child may be treated differently from the biological one.Just as she said this, Qiao Nan did not really need an answer.She still recalled that before she traveled back in time, Qiao Zijin told her mother clearly that her compatibility level of her internal organs would be better.Therefore, she must be the biological child of her parents, and she and Qiao Zijin were real sisters. Qiao Zijin would not make such a joke.Since she was their biological child, why was her mother so heartless to her?\u201cDon\u2019t think otherwise, your mom was just confused.\u201d Qiao Dongliang was forcing a smile that looked uglier than a cry.If Nan Nan had been three years old, she might have believed him. But she was already in junior high school. Even Qiao Dongliang did not believe his own words!For the first time, he knew that the kind of life his younger daughter had been living this at home. Even now, whenever he thought of the conversation with the doctors and the look in their eyes, Qiao Dongliang felt so ashamed that he could not lift his head.Qiao Dongliang looked up at Qiao Nan. \u201cNan Nan, in future, when at home, just eat whatever you want. I will tell Mom when we are back.Qiao Nan nodded. \u201cDad, what if Mom doesn\u2019t let me study anymore?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Qiao Dongliang shook his head. \u201cYour mother will not\u2026 in this age, education is important and your grades are so good, why would your mom not let you study?\u201dSeeing that Qiao Dongliang did not have any idea of what was happening at home, or of the motives of Mom and Qiao Zijin, Qiao Nan sighed. No wonder she had been so miserable in her previous life.Her dad only took care of matters outside the household. All the other matters at home were left to her mother to manage. Of course, her mother would have a say in this.\u201cDad, I want to study, I want to go to college!\u201d\u201cWell, study, as long as your results are fine. I am still young, I will ensure that you go to college.\u201d Qiao Dongliang\u2019s eyes lit up, he looked very pleased.To him, it was a good thing that his own daughter had ambition.Qiao Dongliang always knew that no matter how many good words his wife put in, and the younger daughter obviously had less years of education than the elder one, Qiao Nan\u2019s exam results were always better no matter which way he compared.The elder daughter\u2019s exam results were inconsistent and average. The younger daughter was different. She was always top in her class, and even in the entire school.After they were done with the drip, Qiao Dongliang had spent almost 20 yuan. He then took the medicine and rode the bicycle home with his younger daughter.As soon as Qiao Dongliang and Qiao Nan alighted from the bicycle, Ding Jiayi, who knew that they were back, immediately rushed out, tugged at Qiao Dongliang\u2019s hand and asked, \u201cHow much did it cost?\u201dQiao Dongliang\u2019s face was long, and the tone was not too good. \u201cDoes it matter how much was spent? The important thing is that Nan Nan\u2019s sickness can be cured! It doesn\u2019t matter that the fever medicine had expired, the hospital has plenty of them. Look, with just a bottle of drip, Nan Nan\u2019s fever subsided.\u201dAlthough Qiao Dongliang did not care much about the domestic affairs, he was not a fool.His wife was all about the money. It was clear that she was reluctant to spend money on their younger daughter.The more the wife behaved this way, the more Qiao Dongliang wanted to spend money for the younger daughter. How could they save the money needed for seeking medical treatment?!Qiao Dongliang thoughts were stirred as he recalled the questions that Qiao Nan asked while they were at the hospital. His wife had even wanted to scrimp on expenses for the daughter\u2019s treatment. It would be worse when it came to her college fees.True enough, when she heard Qiao Dongliang words, Ding Jiayi\u2019s face turned pale and she deeply regretted her actions.A trip to the hospital and the drip, Ding Jiayi pinched her fingers and counted. It would have cost at least 10 yuan. These two wastrels.If she knew this would happen, she would not have thrown away the fever medicine. She might as well have saved money by letting the wretched girl take it. That girl did not know how to earn money, yet she had a talent for spending!\u201cI already said that there is no need to visit the hospital. The fever medicine did not expire right, you can just let her continue to take it.\u201dHaving said that, Ding Jiayi could not bear to hit the man. She directly lifted her hand towards Qiao Nan, who was standing by the side, and gave her a few hard slaps on the back, causing a harsh sound.Qiao Dongliang\u2019s eyes were furious. He threw the bicycle away and pulled the younger daughter behind him. \u201cWhat are you doing!\u201dQiao Zijin was shocked. She quickly stood up and said, \u201cMom, Nan Nan is still sick. Nan Nan, I will help you back to the room to rest.\u201dMoney was already spent. There was no recourse even if her mother continued to make a fuss. Her dad could not possibly ask the hospital for the money back.Furthermore, the amount that Qiao Nan spent today, she would be able to pay them back 10 or 100 times when she went to work. Her mother\u2019s anxiousness was uncalled for.Qiao Nan gave Ding Jiayi a glance, and allowed Qiao Zijin to help her back to the room to rest. She knew that, in her whole life, it was scarce for her to receive Qiao Zijin\u2019s help. She was always the one who assisted Qiao Zijin.The heat had subsided. After the turmoil today, Qiao Nan was really exhausted. Furthermore, she had only had half a meal. She fell straight into a slumber.Qiao Nan did not care about the things that followed. She went back to her room and fell asleep shortly after she covered herself with a blanket. In her blurry state, she seemed to have heard the sound of her parents quarreling.In the moment of deep sleep, Qiao Nan secretly recited in her heart. Go ahead, fight. Go ahead, fight.In her previous life, in order to let her parents get along with each other, she helped to persuade them each time her parents quarreled . As a result, she had to sacrifice herself all the time in exchange for peace in the family.In this life, she would never make the same mistake again!The next day, Qiao Nan got up and was in good spirits. After the fever subsided, she did not even have a cough or runny nose. Her whole body was alive and kicking.\u201cNan Nan, are you awake?\u201d\u201cAwake.\u201d\u201cMay I come in?\u201d\u201cCome in if you wish to.\u201dQiao Nan did not say whether she would allow or not allow Qiao Zijin come in. She let Qiao Zijin make her own decision.Qiao Zijin, who was standing at the door, was stunned. Qiao Nan was acting strange since yesterday and was not her usual self.Qiao Zijin pushed the door, and of course, she came in. \u201cNan Nan, I have been tolerating this in my heart. Can I talk to you?\u201dThere was no expression on Qiao Nan\u2019s face. \u201cSpeak if you feel like it, or don\u2019t if you feel otherwise.\u201dQiao Zijin was stopped by this attitude of Qiao Nan. \u201cNan Nan, what\u2019s wrong with you, are you angry with me?\u201dIn the past, Qiao Nan had not talked to her in this manner. Usually, Qiao Nan would be concerned about her troubles and then helped her to resolve them.Although she was older than Qiao Nan, the fact is, Qiao Nan took care of Qiao Zijin more in their daily lives.Qiao Zijin disliked her sister but she was used to Qiao Nan being nice to her. When faced with Qiao Nan\u2019s indifferent attitude towards her, she was not able to adapt immediately.Qiao Nan laughed and looked at Qiao Zi. \u201cWhy do you think I am angry with you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She could not respond to Qiao Nan.Seeing Qiao Zijin\u2019s reaction, Qiao Nan sneered. It seemed that Qiao Zijin was aware that she had done Qiao Nan much wrong, and this made Qiao Nan angry!At a loss for what to say, Qiao Zijin steered away from this topic. Her face was down and her eyes tearful. \u201cYesterday, Dad quarreled with Mom. It was fierce, and Mom cried. My heart aches. If there is a way to make them stop fighting, I am willing to do it regardless of what it takes.\u201dQiao Nan looked down and she pursed her mouth. She did not say a word.Qiao Zijin stole a glance at Qiao Nan and tried again. \u201cActually, I know a little about what happened. Since our parents lost their cradle-to-grave jobs, Mom takes care of the family funds while dad brings in the money. But dad\u2019s income is so miserly and barely enough for the whole family\u2019s expenses. Moreover, both of us are studying. Sigh, our family do not have enough money, and our parents are definitely troubled by this.\u201dQiao Nan remained silent and did not speak.Qiao Zijin pursed her lips unhappily. \u201cNan Nan, how about this. I will quit school and find a job? If one of us is working, the burden on our parents will be lessened, then they won\u2019t quarrel. As long as our parents are fine, no matter what sacrifice I make, it will be worth it. Nan Nan, I believe that you think so too, right?Qiao Nan smirked, her smile full of sarcasm. \u201cSister, it\u2019s great that you think that way. Since a young age, I have never objected to what you say. This time, I will definitely support you too. Your latest school results are average and not so good, it would be difficult for you to pick a school. My results are better than yours, and I will definitely continue to do better than you in the future. You can rest assured that I will study hard and find a good job in future to repay your sacrifice today. Sister, these years, Mom really didn\u2019t pamper you for nothing. You are willing to sacrifice so much for her. \u201dQiao Nan did not take the bait, Qiao Zijin was mad and almost driven to her grave. After she heard these words from Qiao Nan, she rolled her eyes with fury.Qiao Zijin has been narrow-minded since she was a child and liked to compete in everything. In particular, she was not willing to lose to her sister, Qiao Nan.Unfortunately, besides gaining the favor of Ding Jiayi, she was not comparable to Qiao Nan in any other way. Particularly, after they attended school, the results of the two were often compared.For many years, Qiao Zijin had not once performed better than Qiao Nan in her studies.Qiao Nan\u2019s earlier words about their academic performance were like a needle pierced straight into Qiao Zijin\u2019s heart.Ding Jiayi, who had been eavesdropping behind the door, could not help but rush in. She pointed at Qiao Nan\u2019s nose and started scolding her.\u201cYou are a brat with no conscience. For the sake of me and this family, your sister would rather quit school than to see your dad arguing with me. And you? Aren\u2019t you ashamed to let your sister quit school and sacrifice so much for this family? I have given birth to you for nothing, all these years spent raising you were in vain.\u201dFor a moment, Qiao Nan was stunned. She then looked at Qiao Zijin.She had long known that Qiao Zijin was playing her tactics. What she did not expect was that her mother actually hiding behind the door and eavesdropping!Ignoring Qiao Nan\u2019s astonishment, Ding Jiayi continued and said, \u201cLet me tell you. If you still regard me as your mom, tell your dad tonight that you are stupid, that you have no ability, and you don\u2019t wish to attend school. You want to go out to work. Did you hear me?\u201dQiao Zijin had already stood up and walked to Ding Jiayi\u2019s side, without saying a word.\u201cWretched girl! I have said so much. Whether you heard it or not, make some noise. You are a jinx, you have neither heart or ears!\u201d.Ding Jiayi rushed forward in a step and gripped Qiao Nan\u2019s hair, shouting in Qiao Nan\u2019s ears.In the previous life, Ding Jiayi scolded Qiao Nan a lot but did not hit her much.In this life, yesterday\u2019s event was like the activation of a switch in Ding Jiayi\u2019s body. As long as she was not satisfied with Qiao Nan\u2019s reaction, she would hit Qiao Nan with her hands.Qiao Nan\u2019s ears hurt badly and her eyes were red. She grabbed Ding Jiayi\u2019s other hand and bit her hard.Ding Jiayi screamed and let go of Qiao Nan\u2019s hair. Without a word, Qiao Nan rushed out of the house.Her father was not there. Qiao Nan dared not stay in this home. In this life, Qiao Nan refused to quit school and her mother hated her till death.\u201cYou are a wretched girl!\u201d Qiao Nan, who ran outside the house, faintly heard her mother\u2019s curse. She had the wind at her back and she ran as fast as she could \u2013 like a rabbit.Qiao Zijin, whom she bumped into while leaving, frowned. She seemed to have seen blood on Qiao Nan\u2019s clothes again. Was she wrong?Today, her mother had not slapped Qiao Nan. Qiao Nan could not possibly have a nosebleed again.Qiao Nan, who was running with her head down, was halted by someone\u2019s shoulders. Her whole body almost fell backwards.She fell in a posterior position and just as she thought that her bum would hit the floor, her waist felt an arm that was tough, familiar yet strange, that exuded irresistible warmth, help her up.\u201cYou\u2019re hurt again?\u201dZhai Sheng saw that Qiao Nan\u2019s neck, which was as fair and slender as a white swan, was covered in patches of blood again. There seemed to be wrath in his tone.Qiao Nan reached out and wanted to touch her ears. A while ago, when she was gripped by her mother, she felt pain but the pain had worsened now.Zhai Sheng grabbed Qiao Nan\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d.Zhai Sheng took a look and asked Qiao Nan to turn sideways. True enough, he saw a gash on Qiao Nan\u2019s ear.\u201cWho did this? Is there a child abuser in the quad?\u201dQiao Nan\u2019s face dimmed. \u201cMy mom.\u201dZhai Sheng\u2019s eyebrows moved. He heard that Aunt Ding favoured the elder daughter and did not treat the younger daughter well. But this was worse. This was abuse. \u201cWhy did she do that?\u201d\u201cMy mother asked me to quit school and find a job, but I refused to.\u201d As Qiao Nan opened her mouth, her tears started to roll.When she was at home, she could still hold her tears. Somehow, before Zhai Sheng, Qiao Nan could not help but cry. Perhaps Zhai Sheng\u2019s voice was too calm. As her sense of security increased, the more wronged she felt.\u201cAlright, wipe your tears away. I will take you to your dad.\u201d Zhai Sheng reached out and wanted to wipe away the tears on Qiao Nan\u2019s face, but stopped before he could do so.Zhai Sheng took Qiao Nan to the entrance of the factory where Qiao Dongliang worked. \u201cThe tears that you were holding back just now, please let it all out later. You don\u2019t have to say anything. Just cry hard. Whatever is the matter, your dad will ask your mom when he goes back. Understand?\u201dQiao Nan nodded obediently.Seeing that Qiao Nan had understood his words, Zhai Sheng told the factory\u2019s security guard that he was looking for Qiao Dongliang. After a while, Qiao Dongliang came out.Following what Zhai Sheng had taught her, Qiao Nan began to cry as soon as she saw Qiao Dongliang.Having accumulated the grievances for two lifetimes, how bad could Qiao Nan\u2019s crying get?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Today, the sight of the neck full of blood was stinging to Qiao Dongliang\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat happened to you, Nan Nan? Don\u2019t cry, tell Dad, what is this blood?\u201dQiao Nan did not speak. She cried so hard. Her crying made Qiao Dongliang felt extremely bad.The security guards at the door were already staring at them. The blood on the neck of Qiao Nan had not only gained the attention of Qiao Dongliang but also the others.\u201cUncle Qiao, it\u2019s better that you take Qiao Nan to the hospital to treat the wound.\u201d Zhai Sheng reminded him that even though the wound was not bleeding now, it had to be treated.Qiao Dongliang nodded many times. \u201cYes, Nan Nan, don\u2019t cry. Dad will take you to the hospital. You\u2026\u201dAt this time, Qiao Dongliang remembered the young man that came. When he saw his daughter\u2019s misery earlier, he simply forgot about the man.There was no doubt that the young man must have brought Nan Nan here.Qiao Dongliang wanted to thank him but he was stunned when he saw his face.Zhai Sheng, of course. Qiao Dongliang knew who he was.What made Qiao Dongliang particularly stunned was the reputation of the Zhai family. Even if everyone lived in the same quad, Qiao Dongliang never once thought that his family would have anything to do with the Zhai\u2019s. \u201cZhai, Zhai Sheng, thank you for bringing Nan Nan here.\u201dObviously, Zhai Sheng was his junior but Qiao Dongliang was not used to calling him by his name.\u201cNo worries.\u201d Zhai Sheng did not have much reaction. \u201cUncle Qiao, I\u2019ll leave now.\u201dUncle Qiao would deal with everything else properly.As soon as he left, Qiao Dongliang went straight to apply for half a day leave from the factory and took Qiao Nan to the hospital.News about the blood on Qiao Nan\u2019s neck quickly spread in the factory, so Qiao Dongliang\u2019s team leader also knew that his daughter had been bullied and was bleeding. He graciously agreed to let Qiao Dongliang take the time off.However, no-one would expect that the person who hurt Qiao Nan was none other than Qiao Dongliang\u2019s wife \u2013 Ding Jiayi.\u201cWhy are you here again?\u201d The doctor could still recognize the patient who came yesterday.Most importantly, the case of malnutrition despite having the means to visit the hospital was very rare, so the father and daughter pair left a deep impression with the doctor. \u201cWhat is this?!\u201dAs soon as he saw the blood of Qiao Nan\u2019s neck, the doctor frowned and held Qiao Nan\u2019s shoulder to let Qiao Nan turn to her side.When he touched her ear, Qiao Nan shouted in pain.\u201cIt takes a great deal of strength to be able to slit open the ears. You guys are really\u2026\u201dHaving taken a clearer look at the wound in the ear, the doctor\u2019s eyes were full of blame and disapproval. Yesterday was fever and malnutrition. Today was a bleeding wound.The doctor\u2019s suspicion now was not whether the family favors male over female, but whether this daughter was their biological one.Qiao Nan rubbed her eyes. \u201cDoctor, don\u2019t blame my dad, my dad doesn\u2019t know anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Young lady, don\u2019t practise filial piety foolishly, your dad doesn\u2019t know, what about your mother? To allow the child to be bullied to this extent, don\u2019t tell me the mother is already dead?\u201dThe doctor noticed that, since yesterday, each time he mentioned her mother, this lady would not speak. What was happening?Qiao Dongliang was so furious that both his hands were clenched into fists. If the younger daughter was not bullied by the children in the quad, then there was only one person who could have done this to her \u2013 his wife!The nurse was quick to attend to her. First, she helped Qiao Nan clean the blood on her neck, then dealt with the wound by applying a red colored medicine and bandaging the wound.Nevertheless, when the nurse was bandaging, Qiao Dongliang specifically asked the nurse to cover Qiao Nan\u2019s entire ear so that it would look more serious.The nurse looked at Qiao Dongliang strangely but acted according to his wish. In her heart, she felt bad about wasting the bandages.After leaving the hospital, Qiao Nan awkwardly touched her ear which had become so heavy. She tilted her head and looked at Qiao Dongliang.Qiao Dongliang peered at his younger daughter who looked so clean, her black and bright eyes prettier than shining black pearls. His heart softened. \u201cNan Nan, don\u2019t be afraid. Dad will protect you.\u201dRubbed on the head by Qiao Dongliang, Qiao Nan felt a little awkward.In her life, her relationship with her father was not good at all. Her dad didn\u2019t even want to look at her.In the previous life, she did not have a good relationship with her father. Her father was not even willing to take one more glance at her.Qiao Nan knew every well that her father\u2019s attitude towards her was not his fault. She only had herself to blame.Every time her mother made her suffer because of Qiao Zijin, her father always disapproved and dissuaded.But at that time, she was totally brainwashed and she thought that as long as she cared for the family, and her parents did not quarrel, it would be worth her sacrifice.Every time her dad helped her, she stood on her mother\u2019s side and beg for mercy. This resulted in him losing face and feeling heartbroken. Over time, her dad was not willing to bother about her anymore.Saddened by the misfortune but angered by the lack of resistance. This quote portrayed her father\u2019s feelings exactly.Qiao Nan stood over and leaned close to Qiao Dongliang. In this life, she would not let her dad be disappointed and sad anymore. She must first stand on her own two feet!When Qiao Nan ran out of the house and disappeared for half a day, Ding Jiayi was initially indifferent. She expected Qiao Nan to have nowhere to go, and would then obediently return home.She would then ask Qiao Nan to accede to her wants again. She did not believe that Qiao Nan would still refuse to agree, unless Qiao Nan did not want to come back to this home forever.But an hour and two have passed and the sun was setting. It was almost time for Qiao Dongliang to be off-work, Ding Jiayi still did not see any signs of Qiao Nan. She began to feel uneasy.\u201cThis wretched girl, she was too spoilt. This wild girl, half the day is gone and she is still not back. I\u2019ll see how to deal with her when she is back!\u201d\u201cMom, don\u2019t you think something will happen?\u201d Qiao Zijin\u2019s face was one of doubt. Since yesterday, Qiao Nan had been acting strangely.She kept having this feeling that Qiao Nan was not the same as before. Though it was just a fever, her feverish head seemed to have been enlightened. It was not so easy to lie to and cajole her anymore.\u201cWhat could happen? After she comes back, I will give her a good discipline!\u201d When the elder daughter softened, Ding Jiayi sat up straight, displaying her protective behavior towards Qiao Zijin.Soon, came the voice of Qiao Dongliang. Both mother and daughter\u2019s face could not help but change, and they rushed outside.But when the two of them saw that Qiao Nan actually came back by riding on Qiao Dongliang\u2019s bicycle, their faces, in particular Ding Jiayi\u2019s, turned black instantly.Ding Jiayi rushed forward a few steps and tried to pull Qiao Nan down from the bicycle. At this time, when Qiao Nan turned sideways and revealed her fully bandaged ears \u2013 now white, fat and without a single sight of flesh, she felt guilty all of a sudden.Ding Jiayi remembered that before Qiao Nan ran out, she had grabbed Qiao Nan\u2019s ears. At that point, Qiao Nan looked like she was in a lot of pain and had even retorted by biting her. Could it be that, with that grip, she had broken Qian Nan\u2019s ears in her anger?\u201dShe, she did not think she had used that much strength.Qiao Zijin was also shocked. She grabbed Ding Jiayi, \u201cMom, when Nan Nan ran out, I saw blood on her clothes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Dad must be angry.If Mom quarreled with Dad again because of Qiao Nan, would Dad still forgive Mom?At the sight of Qiao Nan\u2019s injury, Ding Jiayi quietened instantly.On the contrary, when Qiao Dongliang glared, the murderous look in his eyes simply scared Ding Jiayi and her face became as white as a sheet.Qiao Dongliang was considered an old good guy. He does not lose his temper easily. But when the person who does not lose his temper had a slightest tinge of anger, it was even more frightening.Therefore, when Qiao Dongliang displayed the first sign of anger, Ding Jiayi hid her arrogance and forced herself to go along.Qiao Dongliang parked the bicycle and did not argue with Ding Jiayi in the quad \u201cYou come with me to the room, I have something to tell you.\u201dHaving said that, he headed towards Ding Jiayi and his bedroom. Ding Jiayi held her breath and followed behind him.Qiao Zijin was so scared that she ran to Qiao Nan, pulling Qiao Nan\u2019s hand. \u201cNan Nan, Dad\u2019s expression is not quite right, what\u2019s wrong with him? Do you think he will quarrel with Mom? Should we go and mitigate?\u201dQiao Nan pulled away Qiao Zijin\u2019s hand. \u201cYou may go and mitigate if you wish to. I can\u2019t help to do so. I\u2019m afraid of getting bashed.\u201dThe moment before she died, Qiao Nan\u2019s heart had already been broken by Ding Jiayi \u2013 her own mother. She was driven to her grave by Ding Jiayi\u2019s words.The time of rebirth in this life was also too coincidental; it was when she found out that her fever was deliberately engineered. The worse thing was that her mother would rather discard the fever medicine than to let her have it. Was she really Ding Jiayi\u2019s daughter?!\u201cNan Nan, don\u2019t you want to see Dad and Mom get along well?\u201d Qiao Zijin started talking and tried to cajole Nan Nan like she had in the past. \u201cIf a few blows and a little suffering could let Dad and Mom mend their differences, I am definitely willing to do it.\u201dWhen she heard these words from Qiao Zijin, Qiao Nan was on fire.In the previous life, under Qiao Zijin\u2019s constant use of this type of heart stirring tactics and brainwashing, Qiao Nan had become obedient and withdrawn.Qiao Zijin was all beautiful talk and no action. Qiao Nan was always the one left alone to carry out the silly tasks!Qiao Nan sneered. \u201cSister, since you said so, then quickly go to the room and persuade them. Mom loves you so much, even if you are beaten, it\u2019s for the sake of Mom. Hurry, after you are beaten, Dad and Mom will mend their differences.\u201dAnyway, the one who got physical would not be Dad; only Mom would use physical ways to vent her emotions.In the face of her most precious elder daughter, Mom would definitely not do it.Seeing that Qiao Zijin was in a daze and there was no movement, Qiao Nan even nudged Qiao Zijin. \u201cSister, hurry up and go. If it\u2019s too late, Dad and Mom will start quarreling.Before Qiao Zijin could say word, her body gave a honest reaction. She twisted. How could she be willing to enter the couple\u2019s room?Qiao Zijin smiled embarrassedly. \u201cDad and Mom are in the heat of an argument now. If I go in at this juncture, it will be definitely be awkward for them. I, I will wait until they have finished quarreling before persuading them.\u201d With that, she ran straight back to her own room.Qiao Nan sneered, she had long known about Qiao Zijin\u2019s self-centered personality. Only her mother would treat Qiao Zijin like a treasure.She did not know what Qiao Dongliang told Ding Jiayi. Since that faithful day, Ding Jiayi never lifted a finger to Qiao Nan. But whenever she cast her eyes on Qiao Nan, it was very unfriendly, as if she was looking at her enemy.Moreover, from this day onwards, Ding Jiayi began to ignore Qiao Nan. It was as if Qiao Nan did not belong to the family.Qiao Nan smiled. She understood this tactic \u2013 it is called psychological abuse.In her previous life, whenever she did not satisfy her mother\u2019s desires, her mother would either make a huge fuss or use this tactic.At that time, she also deserved it. She was unhappy as she often felt that her mother was ignoring her. So she would keep all the suffering to herself and think of ways to please her mother.In this life, with her mother ignoring her, she would also have one less person to scold her. Even better!Sitting in her own room, Qiao Nan was thinking about how she could live this lifetime to the fullest. She must definitely continue her studies but she could not recollect much of the knowledge gained during the days in junior high school.Although at this time, those who went to vocational secondary school were more promising than those in the high school, Qiao Nan knew best that, in future, the college students would be in demand as they valued the diploma in higher education.Qiao Nan rummaged through her entire room. She did not find a single piece of homework, not to mention the junior high school textbooks. In this way, how was she going to revise the studies for junior high school to advance to high school?Qiao Nan thought about it and went straight to look for Qiao Zijin. \u201cSister, why have my secondary one and two textbooks gone missing?\u201dQiao Zijin, who was eating a milk popsicle, said coldly. \u201cThey\u2019re your books. How would I know where they are?\u201dQiao Nan stared at Qiao Zijin\u2019s milk popsicle a few times. \u201cThen are your books still around? Can you lend me your secondary three textbook?\u201dQiao Zijin still thought that Qiao Nan was greedy and eying her popsicle. Pettily, she bit her popsicle and finished it in two or three mouthfuls. Her teeth were so frozen in pain that her words became incoherent. \u201cI have completed my exams so Mom sold my books. It\u2019s good to get some money back too.\u201dOf course, during that time, Mom had also conveniently sold Qiao Nan\u2019s secondary one and two textbooks.Mom was not prepared to let Qiao Nan continue her studies, so there was no point in keeping the secondary one and two textbooks.Even if Qiao Zijin was not explicit about it. Qiao Nan, who had crossed paths with Ding Jiayi for the second time in her life, knew her mother\u2019s character best. \u201cDid Mom sell my textbooks too?\u201dQiao Zijin\u2019s face turned stiff. She did not know if she was frozen by the ice or stunned by Qiao Nan\u2019s reaction. \u201cHow would I know? Anyway, my textbooks are gone.\u201dQiao Nan pursed her lips and sneered. She did not believe that Qiao Zijin did not know anything about this matter.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Seeing that Qiao Nan was leaving, Qiao Zijin quickly stopped her. \u201cBecause of you, our parents have already quarreled twice in three days. Can you stop ruining their relationship?\u201d\u201cMove away!\u201d Qiao Nan rudely pushed Qiao Zijin away and returned to her room.There was still a half a week before school starts. Not only must she learn the knowledge of secondary three, she must also pick up secondary one and two.Without the textbooks, it would certainly not work. If she could not rely on others, she would have to rely on herself.Qiao Nan\u2019s room was very small. It was so tiny that it could only fit one bed. But Qiao Nan dug a hole in her room.The houses in the 1980s and 1990s were not like the 21st century. All of them were built on cemented land. Qiao Nan\u2019s house was paved with neither cement nor bricks; it was paved with mud.Usually, Ding Jiayi would never give Qiao Nan any money. The red packet that was given to her during Lunar New Year, she would always retrieve it behind Qiao Dongliang\u2019s back.For the sake of putting up an act in front of Qiao Dongliang, a person like Ding Jiayi could even pretend to give Qiao Nan some meat with her chopsticks and asked Qiao Nan to put it back. How would she be willing to give Qiao Nan any money?Ding Jiayi would not, but Dongliang would occasionally gave a little. Qiao Nan would save up everything as she could not bear to use it. It came in handy at this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe times now were unlike the times before Qiao Nan\u2019s rebirth where people usually paid with hundred yuan big bills. Looking at the stash of money in her hands, the smallest denomination was only one cent, and even the largest denomination was only one yuan.Qiao Nan counted the bills, it actually added up to a little more than ten yuan.In the late 80s to early 90s, the value of money was much higher, this ten yuan was worth so much more than one hundred yuan in the 21st century.In her previous life, she had used this ten yuan to buy a pair of black leather western style shoes for Qiao Zijin, matched with a dress.Qiao Zijin wore this outfit that she spent ten yuan on to the new high school.In this life, she would not spend a single cent on Qiao Zijin anymore!Qiao Nan went out with that \u201clarge amount of money\u201d; Qiao Zijin could not stop her no matter what she did.By the time Ding Jiayi reached home, Qiao Nan had already been away for more than an hour. Ding Jiayi wiped her hands and asked, \u201cWhere is Qiao Nan?\u201dQiao Zijin had a look of worry on her face. \u201cMom, Nan Nan was looking for her secondary one and two textbooks today.\u201dDing Jiayi was lost for words.\u201cNan Nan seemed to have guessed that you sold her textbooks. When she left just now, I wanted to stop her but I couldn\u2019t. Mom, do you think Nan Nan would go to look for Dad?\u201dThis was very nerve racking for Qiao Zijin. Qiao Nan used to hate it when Dad and Mom quarreled because of her. But now why would she go to Dad for the most trivial things and cause them to get into an argument?\u201cI must have owed her in my previous life, and I had to pay the debts in this life!\u201d Ding Jiayi took off the apron that she just put on and threw it on the floor out of spite. \u201cIn order to have her, your Dad and I lost our cradle-to-grave jobs. Your Dad used to be a company commander in the army and was about to be promoted to battalion commander, But all because of her, your Dad has nothing now! She ruined your Dad\u2019s career, and now she still wants to ruin your life?!\u201dDing Jiayi really regretted having a second child.If she had not had a second child, Old Qiao would definitely be a battalion commander by now, and she would be the wife of a battalion commander. As for her government job, although it was just simple chores, it was leisurely work.Though without the second child, their family would not be the eye of envy of others, at least she would be able to hold her head up high in the quad.The Qiao couple\u2019s future was completely ruined because of the second child. It was not wrong of her to say that she owed her younger daughter in her previous life!She spent all those years bringing up the younger daughter, yet she was of no help at all. All she could do was to splurge and create troubles, causing a strain to her relationship with Old Qiao.What sins had she committed to give birth to such a daughter?!Qiao Zijin listened while Ding Jiayi raked up the old stories. It was a surprise that she kept quiet all along.Actually deep down inside, Qiao Zijin hated Qiao Nan as much as Ding Jiayi. However, unlike Ding Jiayi, while she hated Qiao Nan for taking away her chance to be the daughter of a battalion commander, she also hated her parents Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi.Why did they need a second child? Why did they need a boy? Weren\u2019t they happy with her?If Qiao Nan had been a boy, her mother would definitely do everything for him, including spending all the money, not to mention losing her cradle-to-grave job.When the time came, instead of Qiao Nan, the elder daughter would be the one to bear the wrath of her mother\u2019s anger.Qiao Zijin knew that there was nothing wrong with the birth of Qiao Nan; the problem lay with the fact that Qiao Nan was a daughter. She was not the son that her parents were willing to sacrifice their cradle-to-grave jobs for.Lost in thought, Qiao Zijin dug at a scar on her palm.She was two years old then and her mother was pregnant. All she wanted was to hug her mother\u2019s leg. But her mother pushed her off to a side, for fear that she would knock into her protruding stomach. She fell and hurt her hand then.More than ten years had passed, the wound had healed but it left a scar forever.Qiao Nan was totally unaware of what happened while she was away from home. She knew little of the complicated feelings that Qiao Zijin had.She took the money and went to a thrift shop.\u201cYoung lady, do you have scrap to sell?\u201d The uncle at the thrift shop wore an old blue cotton hat. His face and hands looked clean and his clothes did not seem to be dirty.Qiao Nan shook her head, \u201cUncle, I am not here to sell things, instead I would like to buy some stuff.\u201dThe uncle found it weird, \u201cWhy would you come to my place to buy stuff? What do you intend to buy?\u201dQiao Nan took a glance and said, \u201cUncle, do you have textbooks here, I would like to take a look at secondary three books.\u201dThe uncle blinked a few times but did not probe, \u201cIf you don\u2019t find it dirty, just go ahead and look for the books you want. We can decide on the price based on whatever you find.\u201d\u201cAlright, thank you, uncle.\u201dThe slight smell and messiness of the thrift shop did not bother Qiao Nan at all, she started to search conscientiously.Every year there would be a batch of junior high school graduates. And just like Ding Jiayi, there were quite a lot of people who would sell the textbooks.So it only took Qiao Nan a while to find the junior high school textbooks.Qiao Nan must have been lucky. Not only did she find the textbooks she wanted, the notes were neat and tidy, with detailed solutions to the problems.At one glance, Qiao Nan could tell which books belonged to the same owner of the textbooks she found. She took out all the books with the similar handwritings, including some exercise books.After some picking and choosing, aside from the main subjects, Qiao Nan also managed to find a few workbooks from the same owner.Judging from the paper quality, Qiao Nan surmised that the workbooks were not cheap and seemed to be foreign goods.\u201cOh, you have managed to pick a pile of books?\u201d The uncle walked over and saw the big pile of books stacked nicely besides Qiao Nan. He knew that these must be the books Qiao Nan wanted.\u201cYes.\u201d Qiao Nan\u2019s face was wet with sweat, she casually wiped it off with the back of her hand, leaving a few streaks of dirt on her fair and pretty small face.At the sight of the delicate pretty young lady with a dirty looking face, the uncle laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s quite a few books, will you be able to carry them back?\u201dThe uncle\u2019s question made Qiao Nan stumped for words. The books she picked were pretty heavy. She could made a few trips to bring them back, but where could she keep them at home?If her mother saw the books, she would definitely throw the books away as soon as she bought the books home.Furthermore there was no point telling her father. He had to work and could not stay at home everyday. Once he leave for work, her mother would not let her keep the books.Qiao Nan had painstakingly found the books she wanted, this was a chance she did not want to miss. What she could do now was to ask the uncle for help.\u201cUncle, I am buying these books. Could you put them aside for me, I will just be away for a short while? If you are worried, I can pay first?\u201dThe uncle waved his hands, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I\u2019ll keep the books for you.\u201dAside from this young lady who came to the thrift shop to buy books, everyone came with the intention to sell things.\u201cThank you, uncle.\u201d Qiao Nan smiled gratefully at the uncle and took off at a run.Over at Zhai\u2019s house, Zhai Hua who just woke up was brushing her teeth with a cup in her hands. She saw a young lady pacing outside the doorway, contemplating to go inside the house or not.Zhai Hua spitted out the toothpaste foam and rinsed her mouth. She did not know who exactly this young lady was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To think that last time, she thought that something rare had happened, that her brother had finally been enlightened.Zhai Sheng closed the book and walked towards the door.Zhai Hua was stunned \u2013 the young lady was really here for her brother?Zhai Hua would not miss out on the fun; she craned her neck and peered outside through the window.Zhai Sheng who knew Zhai Hua very well, closed the door sharply right after he went out. Zhai Hua could not even catch a glimpse of what was happening outside, stomping her foot in frustration.The young lady that Zhai Hua mentioned was really Qiao Nan. Zhai Sheng looked her up and down; thankfully, except for the dirty-looking face, the young lady did not have any injuries or bloodstains. \u201cIs anything the matter?\u201dQiao Nan gave him a silly smile. Besides Zhai Sheng, there was no-one that she could ask a favor of. \u201cBrother Zhai, do you have some space that I could put some stuff, but I would need to come over occasionally to use them?\u201d\u201cWhat stuff do you want to keep?\u201d\u201cBooks.\u201dZhai Sheng puckered his thin lips, \u201cIs your Mom giving you trouble again?\u201dHe remembered that Qiao Nan mentioned yesterday that her mother did not intend to let her continue her studies. \u201cShe wanted to sell your books?\u201dQiao Nan smiled bitterly. \u201cI have forgotten some of the knowledge learned from secondary one and two. Middle school examinations will be coming in one year\u2019s time. I would like to sit for college entrance examinations and get into a college.\u201d\u201cSure, come with me.\u201d Zhai Sheng nodded. After all, he had given his word to Qiao Nan a few days ago that she could come to him for help if she faced any problems.Staring at Zhai Sheng\u2019s broad, dependable back, Qiao Nan felt slightly at ease. Luckily Brother Zhai was willing to offer his help.Brother Zhai appeared indifferent and aloof, but in fact he was a very kind-hearted person.Zhai Sheng brought Qiao Nan to the backyard. There was a small hut by itself which was used to store groceries. But the hut had been emptied of groceries the past year and had been vacant since then.Zhai Sheng handed two keys to Qiao Nan. \u201cThis is the key to the hut, while the other one is the key to the back door of my house. Don\u2019t lose them.\u201dQiao Nan blinked her eyes at Zhai Sheng, dumbfounded by his words. She knew that Brother Zhai was a good person, but this was too kind of him. How could he just give away the keys to the back door of his house so easily?Was\u2026 Was this appropriate?\u201cHave you committed it to memory?\u201d Zhai Sheng asked coldly.\u201cYes!\u201d Qiao Nan nodded her head quickly. \u201cBut is this appropriate?\u201d\u201cGood, just bring the books over.\u201d Zhai Sheng did not answer Qiao Nan\u2019s question, but wanted her to bring the books as soon as possible.\u201cOh, alright.\u201d At the thought of the books, Qiao Nan dashed out in full speed as if she had the legs of a rabbit.Once Qiao Nan left, Zhai Sheng went back inside the house and took a new light bulb for the storeroom. The light bulb in the storeroom has not been working since half a year ago, but since it was no longer used to store grocery, no-one had bothered to change it.After changing the light bulb, Zhai Sheng took his desk and chair from the study room and put it in the storeroom.\u201cOh, why did you shift them here?\u201d Zhai Hua was bursting with curiosity when she saw Zhai Sheng moved the desk and chair to the storeroom. \u201cWhat exactly is happening here? Why are the desk and chair here? Hey, you even changed the light bulb?\u201dZhai Hua pulled the string. The storeroom which used to be dim and dark lit up brilliantly in an instant.\u201cThis place is not for me. I lent it to Uncle Qiao\u2019s younger daughter.\u201d Zhai Sheng notified Zhai Hua in advance for fear that it might cause a misunderstanding when Qiao Nan returned with her books.\u201cUncle Qiao\u2019s younger daughter, do you mean Xiao Qiao?!\u201d Zhai Hua said, \u201cThe young lady just now is Xiao Qiao? She looked quite pretty.\u201d\u201cXiao Qiao?\u201d Zhai Sheng appeared clueless.\u201cIn \u2018Romance of the Three Kingdoms\u2019 there were the Two Qiaos of Jiangdong, for us, it is the Two Qiaos of the quad.\u201d Zhai Hua might not have know the people from Qiao family, but she definitely knew about the jokes going around the quad. \u201cMy brother, among the Two Qiaos of the quad, who is prettier, Da Qiao or Xiao Qiao?\u201dZhai Sheng shot a cold stare at Zhai Hua. She froze over and gave an awkward smile. \u201cI was just joking, just joking!\u201dLittle brat, he really could not take a joke.\u201cBrother Zhai.\u201d Qiao Nan puffed hard from the run, bringing some books from the thrift shop. She saw a charming big sister, though she seemed unctuous. \u201cZhai\u2026 is this your big sister?\u201dQiao Nan never thought that she would run into another member from the Zhai family so quickly. She became tongue tied all of a sudden and addressed her in a funny way.Zhai Hua had to bite her tongue. This was not the first time someone called her elder sister. But it was definitely the first time she had been called big sister. \u201cYou could address me as Sister Zhai Hua.\u201d\u201cSister Zhai Hua.\u201d\u201cThere were only this many books?\u201d Zhai Sheng took the books from Qiao Nan and put them aside.\u201cThere are still more to go, I have to go for a few more rounds.\u201d\u201cYou go, I will be here.\u201d\u201cYes, alright.\u201d Qiao Nan was still elated about resolving her two big problems. So when Zhai Sheng asked her to go ahead to bring the books, she ran out happily and did not bother to stay to chat with Zhai Hua.Zhai Hua blinked and was dumbfounded that she was treated as if she was non-existent. She had never imagined that there would be a day where she would be disregarded to such extent.Compared to her ice-cold brother, most people would be more than willing to be with her.Zhai Hua touched her nose oddly and looked through Qiao Nan\u2019s books. She saw the handwriting on the books and her face hardened. She now looked somewhat similar to Zhai Sheng\u2019s usual expression, particularly her eyes, which seemed sharp as razors. \u201cZhai Sheng, what\u2019s all this about? Xiao Qiao was acquaintances with Peng Yu?\u201dPeng family did not get along well with Zhai family. Was there something suspicious about Qiao Nan?Peng Yu was two years younger than Zhai Sheng, but he was as prominent as Zhai Sheng. Zhai Sheng was an all rounder, while Peng Yu has been hailed as genius military counselor in the army, known for his foresight and vicious nature.If Xiao Qiao was sent by Peng family to get close to Zhai Sheng, she would stop at nothing to deal with her!\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Qiao Nan had nothing to do with the Peng family.\u201d Zhai Sheng said calmly and matter-of-factly.\u201cOh.\u201d Gone was the Zhai Hua who was all smiles everyday. She now appeared very stern and serious. \u201cZhai Sheng, although it was a rare occurrence that you have finally grown up and I am glad that you have taken a fancy to ladies, you do not put the Zhai family reputation at stake. I would not allow you to put our family at risk. Given Peng Yu\u2019s character, if Xiao Qiao has nothing to do with Peng family, he would rather throw them away than give it to Xiao Qiao!\u201dZhai Sheng curled his lips, \u201cThese books were thrown away by Peng Yu.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhai Hua arched her eyebrows, a look of disbelief on her face.\u201cDidn\u2019t you notice the smell coming from Qiao Nan?\u201d Even though the smell was faint, he could still tell.\u201cSmell?\u201d Zhai Hua asked uncertainly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I just praised you for finally understanding the way of things and now you\u2019re all muddle-headed again. How could you tell a young lady that she smelled right to her face?\u201dZhai Sheng curled one side of his lips in a sarcastic manner. \u201cHow did you even manage to get into the army back then? Just because you were all brawn and no brains and could serve as cannon fodder?\u201dZhai Hua almost vomited blood. This blood brother of hers really had a sharp tongue!\u201cQiao Nan must have bought these books from the thrift shop.\u201dZhai Sheng had really sharp eyes. Just from the smell of her and her dirty little face, he could tell where Qiao Nan had been before coming to Zhai\u2019s house.Zhai Hua arched her eyebrows.When Qiao Nan returned with another stack of books, Zhai Hua paid more attention to her instead of her gender.What she saw was exactly what Zhai Sheng said. With that Zhai Hua finally relaxed and asked, \u201cWhy did you go to the thrift shop to get old books?\u201dAnd among all the books, you picked Peng Yu\u2019s books.Qiao Nan smiled awkwardly. She could tell Brother Zhai of her family situation, but for no reasons, she just could not bring it herself to reveal it to Brother Zhai\u2019s elder sister.\u201cThis is the study desk?\u201d This time round Qiao Nan noticed that the storeroom\u2019s light bulb was working, and it was refurbished with a sturdy-looking study desk.The study desk was sparkling clean and smooth. One could tell that it had been used regularly.\u201cThat belonged to my sister. She seldom stays at home, leaving it with her would only gather more dust.\u201d Zhai Sheng mentioned.\u201cThank you very much, Sister Zhai.\u201d Qiao Nan thanked Zhai Hua from the bottom of her heart. Not only did she has a place to keep her books, but she also had a study desk.This storeroom was much better compared to Qiao Nan\u2019s learning environment at her house.Qiao Nan rubbed at her eyes quietly. Heavens seemed to be quite nice to her. She was given a chance to have a new lease of life and was lucky enough to run into two kind hearted souls.Zhai Hua arched her eyebrows and puckered her lips into an \u201cO\u201d shape. She threw a meaningful glance at Zhai Sheng. What was wrong with Xiao Qiao, was she touched to tears?\u201cHave you brought all the books back?\u201d Zhai Sheng did not respond to Zhai Hua\u2019s look. Instead he flipped through the books that Qiao Nan brought back and realized that they were in series, from secondary one to secondary three.\u201cYes, I have brought everything back.\u201d Qiao Nan said as she felt the pinch. She had painstakingly saved up the money for fifteen years and now she had to spend more than three yuan on these books.Qiao Nan wondered how much her mother had sold her books for? Did it even amount to three yuan?\u201cAlright, I will leave this place to you.\u201d Zhai Sheng dragged Zhai Hua who did not seem to be leaving alongside with him, leaving no room for argument.\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d Zhai Hua beat Zhai Sheng on the back of his hand and said sullenly, \u201cYou are so nice to that young lady, offering her your study desk, and let me take the credit for it. I am your blood sister, why aren\u2019t you so nice to me?\u201cBy the way, what happened to Xiao Qiao, why did she need to buy books from the thrift shop?\u201d\u201cWhat did you think was the reason?\u201d Zhai Sheng looked askance at her; why would she ask when she already knew the answer?Zhai Hua pulled at the corners of her mouth, \u201cYoung brat, is that how you treat your sister?\u201dZhai Sheng rolled his eyes at Zhai Hua, not responding to her.With such an unreliable sister who enjoyed setting him up, if not for his careful nature, he might have been totally screwed up long ago.Zhai Hua glanced at Qiao Nan who was already studying in the storeroom. She then caught up to Zhai Sheng and stopped making comments regarding Qiao Nan\u2019s matter.With no-one around to bother her, Qiao Nan pored over the books.Qiao Nan had forgotten a lot of the Mathematics knowledge points. But she had studied them before, so with some reading up of the lessons, she still managed to grasp the concepts fairly fast.As for Chinese, comprehension was pretty easy, but for those that required memorizing, she would have to do it from scratch.In the blink of an eye, a day had passed. Qiao Dongliang had came back home from work. The first person that he called out for was his younger daughter.Ding Jiayi breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed like Qiao Nan had not run off to look for Old Qiao. That wretched girl still had some conscience.\u201cThere is no need to shout anymore, Qiao Nan went out to play, she is not at home.\u201d Ding Jiayi told Qiao Dongliang head on as he came in. \u201cShe is undoubtedly a young lady, but she craved fun and excitement more so than a young man, spending her time outside every single day. With such behavior, I reckoned that she would not survive secondary three. Did she really think that she could ace her three years of school with her petty tricks?\u201dQiao Dongliang had a sip of water, wiped his sweaty face with a wet cloth and looked at Ding Jiayi, \u201cI have made my stand, if Nan Nan would like to continue her studies, I will provide for her no matter what.\u201d\u201cAll you say is you will provide, doesn\u2019t that require money?\u201d Ding Jiayi was furious.\u201cSpend money? Can I not afford the money? My salary is not sufficient to pay for Nan Nan\u2019s education fees? Qiao Dongliang was boiling with anger. He would provide for the daughter that he had.Ding Jiayi flushed with anger, \u201cDo you even understand our situation here? Qiao Zijin is in high school now, the expenses are much higher than before, and there\u2019s our household expenses as well, everything needs money! If Qiao Nan were to work, the household would have an extra income and incur less expenses, wouldn\u2019t that be good?\u201dQiao Dongliang pondered and said, \u201cEven if Zijin wanted to enroll in high school and our expenses become higher, at most I could use my monthly pay to cover for all these and not set aside any money for savings. If there\u2019s any unforeseen circumstances, we still have some savings, what\u2019s there to worry about?\u201dQiao Dongliang remembered that they have roughly more than five thousand yuan of savings, not much, but it should be enough for emergency use.Ding Jiayi turned green with guilt upon hearing Qiao Dongliang mention the savings.Qiao Dongliang did not notice Ding Jiayi\u2019s expression; he was lost in thought, pondering whether he should come up with ways to earn more. He would never know that the five thousand plus yuan of hard earned savings that he spent years sloughing his guts out for, had in fact been used by Ding Jiayi as bribery to get their elder daughter to enroll in high school.The reason why Ding Jiayi wanted desperately for Qiao Nan to work, was not only because she did not want to provide for Qiao Nan; another reason was that they did not have any savings at all.A wrinkled purse, a flustered Ding Jiayi.Ding Jiayi stomped her feet in nervousness. Once riled up, there was nothing one could do to hold Old Qiao back.Good thing was that Old Qiao said that as long as that wretched girl agreed to quit school, he would not force her. So she would have to work on that wretched girl.Ding Jiayi thought for a moment, it was an easy feat to stop Qiao Nan from going to school. But what was most difficult would be getting Qiao Nan to quit school of her own accord.She had no idea what the wretched girl had been into these two days. Though useless she used to be obedient, nowadays she even refused to listen to her and Zijin.\u201cHow about Zijin?\u201d The younger daughter was not at home, the elder daughter was nowhere to be seen as well.Ding Jiayi raised her chin happily, \u201cZijin said that she wanted to enter into the college. She did not do well for the middle school examination and wants to revise the knowledge points. Hopefully after she has enrolled in high school, she can catch up on her studies.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Qiao Dongliang was pleased that his daughter was studious and would like to strive for excellence. \u201cMake lots of good food for her, and don\u2019t think of bullying Qiao Nan behind my back!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qiao Dongliang just could not understand why would his wife do such a thing.Ding Jiayi gritted her teeth, not rebutting what Qiao Dongliang said.Ding Jiayi still remembered that day when they had a quarrel; Qiao Dongliang had closed the door and stared at her as if he wanted to swallow her up.Qiao Dongliang\u2019s anger remained. Ding Jiayi did not dare do anything to upset him.\u201cDad.\u201d Qiao Nan knew that Qiao Dongliang must have returned when she reached home.Qiao Dongliang smiled, \u201cNan Nan is back, where did you go to play? It\u2019s still hot now. You have just recovered from an illness, you must be careful not to go in the sun, do you understand?\u201dQiao Nan turned and looked towards Ding Jiayi. It was no doubt her mother who spoke ill of her in front of her father, saying that she has been out for fun.Ding Jiayi caught Qiao Nan\u2019s eye and glared at her, warning her to behave herself.Ding Jiayi stood behind Qiao Dongliang, so he did not see the warning look that she gave their younger daughter.Qiao Dongliang patted Qiao Nan\u2019s head, her fever has subsided by now and said, \u201cNan Nan, though your results and foundation are better than your sister, school reopens the day after tomorrow. If you have time, it would be good for you to stay at home to revise just like your sister.\u201dQiao Nan smiled, \u201cDad, Mum sold off all our junior high school textbooks. I would like to do some revision, but there\u2019s nothing for me to revise from. Middle school examinations will cover secondary one and secondary two content, now I am worried and don\u2019t know what to do. Besides, elder sister also does not have her textbooks. I wonder what is she reading in her room?\u201d\u201cSold?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was stunned. He could not believe it and turned to look at his wife. \u201cWhere have you put Nan Nan\u2019s secondary one and secondary two textbooks? Nan Nan takes proper care of her books. Nan Nan mistakenly thinks you have sold them. Hurry up, take out the books now!\u201dQiao Dongliang refused to believe that his wife would be so ruthless. He did not want to see the relationship between his wife and younger daughter turn sour.The elder daughter had just had middle school examinations. His wife kept the textbooks, and insisted that the younger daughter who just started secondary two to revise secondary one and secondary two knowledge points with the elder daughter.But when it was the younger daughter\u2019s turn to sit for the exams, his wife had sold the books. What was this?!Ding Jiayi turned red. If not for Old Qiao, she would have beaten that younger daughter of hers who was bent on going against her.\u201cWhat are you waiting for, return Nan Nan\u2019s books to her now!\u201d\u201cReturn her books, what\u2019s there to return? I was the one who paid her school fees! Is there any mortar and brick in the house that belong to Qiao Nan?\u201dQiao Dongliang drew a deep breath, \u201cYou paid her school fees, but did you earn that money? Stop all this nonsense, where are the books?\u201d\u201cVery well, I stayed at home and worked my guts out for you, keeping busy all day long. Now you are telling me all this money is yours and I have no say at all! Old Qiao, how could you say this, where\u2019s your conscience? What about all the efforts I put into this family, aren\u2019t they considered contributions at all?\u201dDing Jiayi burst into tears.\u201cDon\u2019t try to change the topic. Where are Nan Nan\u2019s books?\u201dStartled by Qiao Dongliang\u2019s bellow, Ding Jiayi stopped crying. She could not help but snarl, \u201cEverything is gone, there is nothing left. Since Zijin has graduated, there was no point in keeping the books. So I sold them off. But I sold her books by mistake as well.\u201d\u201cBy mistake?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was amused by how Ding Jiayi was lying through her teeth. \u201cDid it really slip your mind, or was it all part of your plan to stop Nan Nan from continuing her studies?\u201dAnyone could tell from these incidents whether his wife had done so intentionally or not. If Qiao Dongliang could not make out the truth, those years in the army were all for nothing.No wonder his wife had refused to give Nan Nan medicine for her fever, and had even thrown the medicine away.Old Ding must have planned for Nan Nan to be so sick that she could not enroll for school!Old Ding must have harbored this thought of not letting Nan Nan enrol in school for ages. She definitely had not thought of it on the spur of the moment.To think that when Nan Nan first told him that Old Ding wanted her to quit school, he thought that Nan Nan had misunderstood Old Ding. So after all, it was his daughter who had seen through Old Ding\u2019s mind.Now that everything was out in the open, Ding Jiayi no longer bothered to explain. But she refused to admit that she was in the wrong, \u201cDidn\u2019t she always score well? Don\u2019t tell me she could not do well in her middle school examination just because she did not have secondary one and secondary two textbooks?\u201d\u201cNan Nan, did you hear that, your Mom has agreed to let you continue with secondary three.\u201d Qiao Dongliang smiled coldly. He stroked Qiao Nan on the head and picked on Ding Jiayi\u2019s words, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Nan Nan, even if your Mom does not allow, I am the breadwinner of the family. I will earn the money to let you continue with your studies.\u201d\u201cThank you, Dad. Thank you, Mom!\u201d Qiao Nan said at the top of her voice.No matter what, she had finally gotten the opportunity to continue her studies. She would not need to quit school anymore.Seeing that Ding Jiayi had turned green, Qiao Nan just couldn\u2019t help but shout out in joy with a wicked thought in mind, \u201cDad, Mom has sold all the books, so what is sister reading in her room?\u201dWhat was Qiao Zijin so fascinated with? Her father and mother just had a big quarrel, yet she as a good daughter did not turn up at all?Qiao Dongliang looked towards Ding Jiayi, who stiffened and said, \u201cZijin told me she wanted to read some books, how would I know what is she reading?\u201dDing Jiayi never doubted her beloved elder daughter\u2019s words.\u201cMom, you have always been ranting about money, complaining that there was not enough to spend. You bought high school books for sister in advance, wasn\u2019t that a waste of money?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Ding Jiayi shook her head.She had spent all the savings in order to get Zijin into a good high school. How would she have money to buy high school books?They were stunned by Ding Jiayi\u2019s denial.Flustered, Ding Jiayi walked to Qiao Zijin\u2019s room. She knocked at the door lightly and said, \u201cZijin, Mom is coming in.\u201dUpon knocking the door, Ding Jiayi opened the door without waiting for Qiao Zijin\u2019s reply.Ding Jiayi stepped into Qiao Zijin\u2019s room and saw that her elder daughter\u2019s face was covered in tears, her eyes clouded with sadness.Ding Jiayi\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Her elder daughter must have felt sorry for her Mom who was caught up in a quarrel with Old Qiao.Ding Jiayi\u2019s heart melted. Her elder daughter was such a dear, she had to give extra love to her. She must think of ways to pave the path for her daughter\u2019s future.\u201cHa\u2026\u201d Qiao Nan who followed right behind snorted and laughed when she saw the book that Qiao Zijin was holding in her hands. \u201cSister, so you are reading a novel. Seems like you are so engrossed in your novel, it must have been tiring for you.\u201dThe novel that Qiao Zijin was reading was none other than Mou Nainai\u2019s novels. Mou Nainai has been known to write novels regarding affairs in a marriage for quite a long period of time.Qiao Dongliang overheard them and knitted his eyebrows, \u201cYou are reading novels, not revising? What is this novel about?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qiao Dongliang took a few glances and was exasperated. \u201cDid you coop yourself up in your room to read this kind of novel?\u201dGiving Qiao Zijin no time to react, Qiao Dongliang spread his two hands and tore up the novel. \u201cYou refuse to let Nan Nan study, and yet you have spare money to buy this for Zijin. Old Ding, let me ask you, do we have money or not?\u201dQiao Dongliang saw that the novel was not cheap, and there was the elder daughter\u2019s name on the book. It was undoubtedly hers.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Ding Jiayi was dumbfounded. Old Qiao wanted his daughters to be well-educated and to have a promising future, so as to make up for his regret of being discharged from the army. This was the first time that she had seen Old Qiao tear up their daughter\u2019s books.\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Ding Jiayi hurried to explain. \u201cI didn\u2019t give Zijin money and I never knew that she bought books recently.\u201dDing Jiayi felt that she had been treated unjustly. She had saved and scrimped at home and kept tight control on the meat and fish dishes at home in order to save some money to pull strings for Zijin.She would never give Zijin extra money to buy these kind of novels.Ding Jiayi had no idea what the novel was about. But judging from Qiao Dongliang\u2019s reaction, when he only took a glance and tore it into pieces, intuition told her that there was nothing great about the book.Out of curiosity, Qiao Nan picked up the book on the floor, and flipped to the last page.She has been sisters with Qiao Zijin for two lives. She knew all the small habits that Qiao Zijin had.As expected, when Qiao Nan flipped to the last page, she saw some dates written on it. It dated back to more than half a year ago, around New Year last year.Looking at the pages, there weren\u2019t brand new. It meant that Qiao Zijin bought it more than half a year ago, and she had finished reading some time ago.Qiao Nan calculated the dates, and realized that it had been during the most crucial part of the year where Qiao Zijin was sitting for her middle school examination. Qiao Zijin had spare money, yet she did not spend it on revision books, but wasted it on this kind of novel. No wonder Qiao Zijin had not been doing well in her exams, and that she only barely managed to make it to high school.Qiao Dongliang used to serve in the army, he was more insightful than others.Just one glance at Qiao Nan\u2019s flipping actions and he knew what was going on. There was no need for Qiao Nan to say a word.Qiao Zijin was sitting for her crucial middle school examination at that time, and yet she had the time to read novels. Thinking back on her results, Qiao Dongliang felt extremely disappointed.Ever since he had been discharged from the army, he had pinned his hopes on his two daughters, hoping that they would have good prospects, and that was why he let them enrol in school.He thought she was not as gifted but had tried her best, thus with the adequate results that she had, he had not scolded her at all for two whole months.But now Qiao Dongliang knew the truth. Qiao Zijin did not put any effort into her studies at all.\u201cNo wonder your results are less than satisfactory; this is where you have channeled your attention to.\u201d Qiao Dongliang was puzzled, at such a young age, how did Qiao Zijin know about these romance novels?Thinking back on the near seventeen years that he had spent bringing up his elder daughter, she had never shed a tear for her Dad. Yet she had cried her guts out for that book. Qiao Dongliang felt awful.But he could not take it out on his daughter, so he ranted at Ding Jiayi. \u201cShe was preparing for her middle school examination and yet she was reading this sort of immoral book. How could she possibly get good results?! Zijin\u2019s heart was not set on studying and you forced her to study. On the other hand, Nan Nan had been performing well all along, yet you wanted her to quit school. What do you mean by that?!\u201dQiao Dongliang grabbed the book from Qiao Nan and threw it into Ding Jiayi\u2019s face.Her face was not hurt, but her pride did. However Ding Jiayi could not rebut a word now. \u201cZijin, why did you\u2026\u201dWhy did she have to fumble the ball at such a juncture?Ding Jiayi never imagined that her elder daughter would be reading novels instead of revising in such a crucial half-year period.On the other hand, even though Qiao Nan wanted to study at home, Ding Jiayi would always order her around, asking her to run errands and to clean up the house.Qiao Zijin still had a buzzing sound in her ears. She was totally baffled, scared out of her wits.Whenever Qiao Zijin was reading, no-one in the house would disturb her.In particular today, she made it a point to tell Ding Jiayi that she was going to study. As always, Ding Jiayi would not let anyone disturb her or go into her room.Because there was Ding Jiayi around, Qiao Zijin read her novel without a care.The story had reached a climax, Qiao Zijin was totally absorbed in the plot, sobbing terribly for the couple who were forced to stay apart by the wife of the male lead. Yet all of a sudden there were three people in her room.As for the revision that Qiao Zijin was saying, the content of this book had no relation whatsoever to her junior high studies.\u201cNo, no, Dad, you\u2026 you are mistaken, this book\u2026 I, I only read it after exams were over, not, not before that\u2026\u201dQiao Zijin stuttered and could not utter a proper sentence. But everyone could tell that she was trying to make excuses for herself.Ding Jiayi came to her senses and went to Qiao Zijin\u2019s rescue. \u201cOld Qiao, you heard it, though Zijin bought the book way before exams, she only read it recently. How she fared in middle school examination had nothing to do with this book. Zijin was so sensible, she would not do things like that.\u201d\u201cNever read before, does this look like a new book?\u201d\u201cDad, I never read it, but I lent it to my classmate!\u201d\u201cWho did you lend it to?\u201d\u201cI have lent it to Wang Hua from the next class.\u201d But Wang Hua has moved house four months ago. She did not even sit the middle school examination. Her Dad would not be able to find her.\u201cThe one who moved, sister, since when are you on such close terms with the classmates from the next class?\u201d Qiao Nan laughed. Qiao Zijin might be able to convince their mother, but definitely not Dad.This was obviously Qiao Zijin\u2019s intention. Wang Hua had moved house and Dad had no way of verifying with her.\u201cYou shut up!\u201d Ding Jiayi shouted at Qiao Nan. \u201cAt this juncture,you are still adding fuel to the fire, Qiao Nan, what ill intentions are you harboring, if you do not know how to speak, just keep your mouth shut!\u201dDing Jiayi was startled by Qiao Dongliang\u2019s darkened face.\u201cDad, I have to enroll for school the day after tomorrow. Where are my school fees?\u201d Qiao Nan tried changing the topic, the date for enrollment was just a few days away, would she be able to get her school fees? \u201cDad, I have used up all my pens and exercise books.\u201dQiao Dongliang let out a deep breath, \u201cGive twenty yuan to Nan Nan.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We don\u2019t have so much.\u201d Ding Jiayi felt the pinch, 20 yuan \u2013 that was a month of the family expenses. \u201cAnyway, Zijin has a lot of pens and notebooks, can\u2019t she use them?\u201dQiao Dongliang was both amused and angered by Ding Jiayi\u2019s words. \u201cWhile Zijin has a poor learning attitude, she can have everything new. Nan Nan\u2019s results are so good and she can only use the leftovers from Zijin? Let me repeat. Give Nan Nan 20 yuan!\u201d\u201cIf we give her 20 yuan, what are we going to eat and drink for this month?!\u201d Ding Jiayi was not happy to provide the money.\u201cMom.\u201d Qiao Zijin whispered to Ding Jiayi, trying to dissuade her.She finally felt it. Recently, Qiao Nan\u2019s behavior was so bizarre that it was causing her bad luck.With her father\u2019s current attitude, her mother would never be able to override him no matter how determined she was. Qiao Nan would undoubtedly continue with her studies.Since this was the case, Qiao Zijin thought that her mother might as well agree to this immediately. This might even improve her father\u2019s impression of Ding Jiayi.Ding Jiayi pushed away Qiao Zijin\u2019s hands. \u201cZijin, I know you don\u2019t want me to argue with your dad, but please leave this matter alone.\u201dThough he heard from Ding Jiayi that she did not have money on hand, Qiao Dongliang did not feel like questioning her on where his salary for the month went to. \u201cIf it\u2019s not enough, you can go to the bank to withdraw 100 yuan. That should do.\u201dNan Nan started school, so did Zijin.As Zijin continued her studies, she certainly needed money. Old Ding could not possibly let her suffer. She would not give even one cent, not to mention 100 yuan.At the mention of savings, all three women of the Qiao family became exceptionally quiet.Qiao Nan need not say anything. The huge mess that her mother made would be found out sooner or later.Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin had a look of guilt all over them. They dared not speak.\u201cWhy are you standing there. Give me the chequebook. I will go to the bank with you tomorrow to withdraw 100 yuan.\u201d Qiao Dongliang stretched out his hands to Ding Jiayi.Ding Jiayi was scared stiff. Her face turned slightly pale and she stuttered when she spoke. \u201cNo. Didn\u2019t you want 20 yuan? I will give it to you. We don\u2019t have to go to the bank.\u201dTo ensure that Qiao Dongliang dismissed the thought of the passbook, Ding Jiayi immediately took out 20 yuan from her pocket and threw it on the ground.Qiao Nan\u2019s face was stiff. She took deep breaths. She remained silent.She must continue with her studies. At this time, it was not easy to get her mother to give any money out. She must cherish this opportunity.Qiao Nan continued to comfort herself with such thoughts, but as an adult with dignity, her eyes were all red, and her hands reluctantly moved to pick up the money.Qiao Dongliang pursed his lips. \u201cOld Ding, although it is not the time to to fight now, I don\u2019t think you want me to lift my hand against you!\u201dDing Jiayi was at the top of her anger, she not only had to give the money, but also had to wait on the wretched girl, Qiao Nan, as if she was their ancestor. Why should she?!Before Qiao Dongliang could flare up again, Qiao Zijin stood up without a word, bent down and picked up the money. She blew and patted it dry before handing it to Qiao Nan personally. \u201cNan Nan, please don\u2019t misunderstand. Mom definitely loves you, but she hasn\u2019t been resting well recently, and has a poor temper.\u201dUnlike the past, Qiao Nan was not so easy to sweet-talk. If Mom continued with this attitude, whatever she said to Qiao Nan would not no longer have any effect.Qiao Nan held on tightly to the money but did not speak.\u201cNan Nan, let\u2019s go, Dad will get some egg noodles for you.\u201d Qiao Dongliang shot a look of disdain at Ding Jiayi. Despite being years older, she was not as sensible as her daughter.Qiao Zijin was sloppy in her studies, Qiao Dongliang was of course angry and disappointed but he still loved his own daughter. Seeing that Qiao Zijin was more gracious and sensible than Ding Jiayi, his gaze quickly softened.Standing by the side and watching, Qiao Nan sighed. They belonged to one family. The mistakes that Mom made were mostly \u201cpetty\u201d ones; regardless of how angry Dad was, he would at most argue a little. It would definitely not be that serious.To put it bluntly, her father was easy to appease.As she was fully aware of this, after the rebirth, Qiao Nan only focused on protecting her own interests. She did not kick up a big fuss or sow discord between the couple.\u201cDad, can you give me two eggs?\u201d Qiao Nan perked herself up and smiled at Qiao Dongliang.\u201cWell, as long as Nan Nan likes it, not to mention two, three is also not a problem.\u201d Qiao Dongliang pulled Qiao Nan to the kitchen and rolled up his sleeves to prepare noodles for her.Hand-made noodles are delicious, chewy and not sticky, topped with some shallots and two golden eggs, they were especially fragrant.Having the freshly-made noodles, Qiao Nan smiled bitterly. The reason why her father personally went to the kitchen to prepare noodles were two-fold. First, to make up it to her and second, he hoped that she would forget what happened today and not take this matter to heart with her mother.She did not expect her mother to become fair, nor did she expect her father to become firm in taking her mother in hand.The only thing she hoped and strived for in this life was that she would study well, find a good job to support herself, have her own home and quietly live through her days.As for her mother and Qiao Zijin, they could try to torture her as much as they would like to, but she would not participate with their ploys. She would earn her own keep and guard it jealously.This dinner, the Qiao family had a particularly quiet meal.Qiao Dongliang had only prepared the portions of Qiao Nan and himself, and Ding Jiayi had to prepare for Qiao Zijin and herself.This was the first time that the Qiao family was divided into two tables. Except for Qiao Nan, the rest of the three parties felt strange and confused.After eating the noodles, Qiao Nan washed her own cutlery, turned and returned to her bedroom and started reading.When Ding Jiayi saw that Qiao Nan had only cleaned up after herself, she was so furious that she shouted at her.Qiao Zijin quickly stopped Ding Jiayi and hinted at her by shaking her head. She silently mouthed two words \u2013 \u201cThe passbook\u201d.These two words were Ding Jiayi\u2019s Achilles heel. Before this, Ding Jiayi was like a balloon that was ready to blow up anytime. Now, she seemed to be one that was out of gas and withering badly.\u201cMom, let me wash up.\u201d Qiao Zijin endured the greasiness and discomfort while she immersed her hands into the water.Ding Jiayi took the dishes out of Qiao Zijin\u2019s hands. \u201cNo, Mom will wash. My daughter does not need to do these rough chores. You just have to go back to your bedroom to rest\u2026 Zijin, the situation at home, Mom did not hide from you. Don\u2019t make your dad angry again and create trouble for Mom. Okay?\u201d\u201cMom, you can rest assured, it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Qiao Zijin also began to regret letting her mother sell all of the textbooks. With none left, she could not even put up a pretence.What Qiao Nan did not know was that Ding Jiayi had only intended to sell her books, and not those of Qiao Zijin.Qiao Zijin finally graduated from junior high school. She hated the sight of those textbooks and was eager to get rid of them.She even told Ding Jiayi \u2013 if she did not sell her textbooks, and Qiao Nan\u2019s books were gone, what if she asked to borrow from her?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She never expected that the outcome was that she would dig her own grave.After Qiao Zijin came out from the kitchen, for a moment, she did not know what she could do.After some thoughts, Qiao Zijin prepared a cup of tea for Qiao Dongliang and then apologized to him in an honest and sincere manner. As for when the book was purchased, whether she read it before or after the middle school exams, she did not say a word.Qiao Zijin was quite street smart, especially when it came to appeasing her parents.Knowing the temperament of Qiao Dongliang, it was better to admit to the mistakes immediately than to argue and lie.True enough, with this, Qiao Dongliang was forgiving and softly persuaded Qiao Zijin not to make the same mistake again in future, to do well in her studies. The behavior was unlike that of Ding Jiayi, who kept shouting at Qiao Nan to quit school.After appeasing Qiao Dongliang, Qiao Zijin was certain that her younger sister Qiao Zijin had changed in these few days.Qiao Zijin constantly reflected on herself \u2013 could she have accidentally let slip her intentions before Qiao Nan and resulted in Qiao Nan\u2019s current attitude towards her?Having successfully maintained the father-daughter relationship, Qiao Zijin decided to try again to mend the sister-to-sister relationship. \u201cNan Nan, can I come in?\u201dQiao Zijin waited for a while but did not hear the voice of Qiao Nan. After some thought, Qiao Zijin simply pushed open the door and entered.In fact, before today, Qiao Zijin would enter Qiao Nan\u2019s room as and when she wanted to. There was never a need to knock on the door.In the entire Qiao family, the family members only had the habit of knocking on Qiao Zijin\u2019s door before entering. \u201cNan Nan, what are you reading?\u201dAs Qiao Nan\u2019s back was facing Qiao Zijin, Qiao Zijin could see that Qiao Nan was flipping the pages of a book but she could not see what book it was.Qiao Zijin\u2019s eyes lit up, revealing her excitement. All the textbooks had been sold by Mom. How could Qiao Nan have any decent books left to read?Qiao Zijin shouted straight at the top of her lungs.Her voice alerted Ding Jiayi who was behind the stove and Qiao Dongliang who was resting in the room.When she heard Qiao Zijin\u2019s hoarse voice, Qiao Nan\u2019s face turned black and hid her books immediately. \u201cWhat are you doing in my room?!\u201d\u201cNan Nan, what did you hide? Is there a secret between the two of us? Can I see? Nan Nan, I am the living example. Don\u2019t pick up the wrong things from others and read those indecent books. If Dad knew, he would be so sad and angry. It is enough that I have made this mistake. I just promised Dad that it will not happen again. Nan Nan, be obedient, hand over the book, I will help you to ask for Dad and Mom\u2019s forgiveness. You must also promise them that you will never make such a mistake in the future. If you are too afraid, I can help you to cover it up, but you must not keep this book.\u201dAs Qiao Zijin spoke, she pounced towards Qiao Nan and wanted to grab the book was hidden in Qiao Nan\u2019s arms, so that she would have the complete set of evidence.\u201cAh.\u201d Qiao Nan could not stop sneering.With the voice of Qiao Zijin as loud as an opera singer, Dad and Mom could not have missed it unless they were deaf. And Qiao Zijin was still trying to sweet-talk her by offering to cover up the matter!It was a once-in-a lifetime opportunity for Qiao Zijin, who had just done something wrong, to catch her red-handed. Qiao Zijin could not wait to let the whole world know.\u201cWhat is happening?!\u201d Ding Jiayi rushed over with the spatula still in her hand.After she heard Qiao Zijin\u2019s words and also saw Qiao Dongliang who rushed over at the same time, Ding Jiayi began to bombard the father without any reservation. \u201cSee for yourself, this girl is so wild at heart, not to mention that she is always outside. I don\u2019t even see her studying hard at home. Hiding to read novels? Zijin had completed her middle school exams, but her, this is the critical year that she will be advancing to secondary three. With her attitude, aren\u2019t you pouring money down the drain if you allow her to study?!\u201dNo, she must have a good talk with Old Qiao. To let such a person continue her studies would be a waste of the family\u2019s money.\u201cShut up!\u201d Qiao Dongliang was in a fix. \u201cYou dare to scold Nan Nan, you have sold her secondary one and two textbooks, what can Nan Nan be reading?\u201dQiao Dongliang had not forgotten this. \u201cI was still wracking my brain, Nan Nan also needed to take the mid-term school exams. How is she going to revise her studies for this year?\u201dJust when Qiao Dongliang was thinking hard of ways to help the younger daughter borrow a set of the secondary one and two textbooks, she had also picked up the bad habit of reading novels. Qiao Dongliang felt so exhausted at heart.\u201cNan Nan, you see, both Dad and Mom are angry, why don\u2019t you take the novel out?\u201d Qiao Zijin was quite happy and smug.At this moment, she was unable to hide her emotions from Qiao Nan.With more than a lifetime of experience, Qiao Nan\u2019s eyes were venomously sharper than before. She saw straight through Qiao Zijin at one glance. Qiao Zijin was gloating. \u201cI\u2019m not giving it to you, or Mom either!\u201dQiao Dongliang took a deep breath and said with his greatest patience to Qiao Nan, \u201cNan Nan, if you really wish to study hard, please give the book to me.\u201dSince he had forgiven one, he would have to forgive the other.He could not possibly be generous to his elder daughter and petty to the younger one. Qiao Dongliang was could not bring himself to do that.Qiao Nan breathed a sigh of relief. She handed the book to Qiao Dongliang.If her book was with Qiao Zijin or her mother, she would not be able to keep it, even if it was a decent book.\u201cThis is\u2026 \u201d When Qiao Dongliang saw that the younger daughter had handed to him a secondary one math textbook, he was stunned. \u201cIsn\u2019t your book \u2013 ?\u201dWas it sold by Lao Ding?Qiao Nan\u2019s face was red. \u201cA summer vacation had passed. Maybe I really was a little crazy. I seemed to have forgotten what was taught in secondary one and two, so I wanted read more and pick up the knowledge again before the school starts.\u201dAfter all, she had not been studying for years. If she suddenly had to pick up her previous knowledge, Qiao Nan definitely needed some time.Qiao Nan was not afraid of other things. She was only afraid that if she flunked the mid-term exams, she would have let down Qiao Dongliang. Her wish to study would also be dashed.After all, her mother would constantly try to influence her father. Her academic results were the only reason and source of motivation for her dad to continue supporting her.\u201cOh, good, good!\u201d Qiao Dongliang felt at ease instantly. \u201cBut your book?\u201d\u201cYes, where did the book come from?!\u201d Ding Jiayi\u2019s face was as fierce as a tiger. She still wished that the wretched girl would fail her exams since she did not have the secondary one and two textbooks for revision.Old Qiao now insisted that the wretched girl should continue to study. But if she graduated from junior high school, and did not do well, should she find a job instead?The country currently only advocated a nine-year compulsory education, it was not necessary to go to high school. The tuition fees were expensive!For her elder daughter, Ding Jiayi was willing to pay. However, at the thought of spending so much money on the younger daughter, Ding Jiayi felt the pinch.\u201cI bought it from the waste recycling station.\u201d Qiao Nan answered with dignity.\u201cBought, where did your money come from?!\u201d Why didn\u2019t she know that the wretched girl had hidden some money?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not only the money was not wasted, but it was also worth it!\u201cLet me ask you, where did your money come from?\u201d Ding Jiayi tugged at Qiao Nan. \u201cHow much did you spend on buying the book? How much do you have left? Take it out.\u201dWretched girl, she even dared to hide money.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Qiao Dongliang pulled Qiao Nan behind him. Ding Jiayi did not dare to come forward to touch Qiao Nan. \u201cThe money was from me.\u201dHowever, he had not given much. It seemed that Nan Nan had never spent that money. After so many years of savings, they were finally put to a good use at this crucial moment!\u201cNan Nan, is the money enough, did you buy just one book? If that\u2019s not enough, don\u2019t be afraid, tell me. I will buy for you!\u201dIt was obvious to Qiao Dongliang that the younger daughter would never be able to receive a single cent from his wife. No matter how small the amount was, any money that the younger daughter had would be confiscated by his wife.Fortunately, his wife did not know about this stash. Otherwise, the younger daughter would not have conceived the idea of buying books from the waste recycling station.Moreover, the elder daughter had spent all the money that he had given her and even bought those novels.With this, Qiao Dongliang began to pay more attention to the younger daughter who had been quiet all this time.Both daughters should be loved, but five fingers were not of the same length. In Qiao Dongliang\u2019s impression, besides performing better in her studies, Qiao Nan did not have any other positive qualities.But today or recently, Qiao Dongliang found out that, besides not as being as affectionate as the elder daughter, the younger daughter actually had many merits. Not only did she have the tendency to do the right thing, but she was also very intelligent.If Old Ding was not the mother of the younger daughter, she might not be able to bully her.True enough, having heard what Qiao Nan said next, Qiao Dongliang became very certain of this.\u201cNo, I found the secondary one and two textbooks.\u201d\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Ding Jiayi asked loudly.When she found all those books, she would not leave any for Qiao Nan. At the very least, she would ask the school to extend an additional year for Qiao Nan to complete her compulsory education. Not more than that!\u201cThey are not at home anyway.\u201d Qiao Nan snorted. \u201cWhich book would you like to see? I will bring it back.\u201dWhen she brought the book home, Dad was already home. If Dad was around, Mom would not dare to grab her book, nor would she dare to tear it.When she heard Qiao Nan\u2019s answer, Ding Jiayi was furious. On the contrary, Qiao Dongliang laughed. He touched the younger daughter\u2019s head. \u201cThis is quite good.\u201dThe younger daughter had also learnt guerrilla warfare with the old Ding. She had inherited the qualities of the old Qiao family.If Qiao Nan had been a son, the old Qiao family would have a successor. This was a living soldier with great potential!Qiao Dongliang took a glance at Ding Jiayi who had the cheek to be angry. \u201cOld Ding, remember what I said? Nan Nan is good, we have to nurture her.\u201dQiao Dongliang\u2019s words made Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin\u2019s faces change simultaneously. Not only were they unable make Qiao Nan quit school and work, but now they had to nurture her. How were they going to do that?!If they nurtured Qiao Nan, what about Qiao Zijin?Qiao Dongliang was the sole breadwinner, and all the savings in the family had been wiped out by Ding Jiayi.One earns and four spent, Out of the four, two were big spenders, Ding Jiayi thought. She was at the top of her anger and ulcers formed all around her mouth that night.Ding Jiayi, who was bitter in her heart, could not bring herself to tell Qiao Dongliang about this. She could only worry about this herself.The next morning when Qiao Dongliang saw Ding Jiayi had a mouth of ulcers, he only thought that his wife was heaty, but the two daughters knew in their hearts why Ding Jiayi were like this.Qiao Nan could not even protect herself, not to mention that she had always been the one being sacrificed. No matter how anxious Ding Jiayi was, at this time, Qiao Nan was not willing or able to help.So, one day before the start of school, Qiao Nan continued to go to the Zhai family to revise. In order to avoid Ding Jiayi, Qiao Nan did not even go home for lunch at noon, she spent five cents and bought a loaf of bread to tide over her hunger.She waited until the evening when Qiao Dongliang got off work before she went home again.After revising for two days, Qiao Nan became more aware of her current standard. After some consideration, Qiao Nan felt that it was necessary to talk to Qiao Dongliang. \u201cDad.\u201d\u201cIs there something? Come in.\u201dQiao Dongliang pointed to the stool in the room, Qiao Nan sat on it. \u201cDad, this is the situation, I have to let you know. Mom\u2019s attitude, as you know, during this summer vacation\u2026 Dad, this time after school starts, my results may not be as good as before, or may even be a little worse. Dad, can you not take into account the mid-term exam results, and wait for my performance at end of the term?\u201dQiao Nan was really worried that with only half a semester of time, she might not be able to catch up, and then if her mother kicked up a fuss, her dad would relent and make her quit school.Qiao Dongliang thought about it:\u00a0\u2018Yes, but Nan Nan, you have to remember that since you have made a promise, I can disregard the mid-term exam, but you have to give me a satisfactory answer in the final term. Otherwise, I won\u2019t be able to explain it to your mother either.\u2019In teaching a child, having flexibility is important.You can\u2019t pull the reigns too tightly, neither can you let it loose too much.The fiasco of Qiao Zijin\u2019s middle school examination made Qiao Dongliang reflected for a long time. He felt that the couple had been too assured with their elder daughter and too lax in monitoring her studies. As a result, Qiao Zijin became who she was.He did want to make a second mistake twice, this time, on his younger daughter.\u201cOkay.\u201d Qiao Nan did not know Qiao Dongliang\u2019s thoughts, but she placed these words of Qiao Dongliang in her heart with great importance.In any case, she won more than half a year\u2019s time for herself.\u201cDad, then I shall go and revise.\u201d Having given the opportunity that she fought hard for, Qiao Nan cherished it immensely and immediately went back to the room to read.\u201cMom.\u201d Qiao Zijin stayed with Ding Jiayi at the stove, her eyes full of worries.\u201cPhew\u2026 \u201d Ding Jiayi breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom will find a way. The wretched girl will start school tomorrow, so don\u2019t bother about it this year. But after you go to high school, you have to save more money. Also, that savings of Qiao Nan, you didn\u2019t know?\u201dWhen she heard that she had to tighten her belt, Qiao Zijin was unhappy. \u201cDaddy only gave me and Nan Nan a few cents. I thought that Qiao Nan also spent it all. I didn\u2019t know that she saved them up.\u201d\u201cIn future, keep a tight watch for me and don\u2019t let her have any money on hand. Look at this matter. If she doesn\u2019t have money, she can\u2019t buy books and when she fails her middle school exams, she will have to work. It will at most be delayed for a year.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNow\u2026Ding Jiayi had to admit that, in comparison to the elder daughter, the younger daughter\u2019s academic performance was better.The elder daughter could continue with her studies even though she flunked the middle school exams. If the younger daughter performed better in the exams, she would not able to convince Old Qiao on this. However, if the younger daughter performed worse, she would have the opportunity to convince Old Qiao to change his mind.\u201cMom, don\u2019t mention this anymore.\u201dTalking about money, Qiao Zijin was more dismayed than Ding Jiayi.Qiao Zijin had long been aware of Qiao Nan\u2019s money, before Ding Jiayi\u2019s knowledge.Qiao Zijin was a spendthrift who spent all that her parents gave. She also knew that Qiao Nan did not spend a single cent and gradually saved up.The reason that Qiao Zijin did not tell Ding Jiayi about the money was that if her mother knew, her mother would simply confiscate Qiao Nan\u2019s money and not let Qiao Zijin spend it. Qiao Zijin was reluctant to part with that money.Qiao Zijin thought that it was easy to sweet-talk Qiao Nan.As long as she wasted some breath and sweet-talked Qiao Nan, the savings would eventually have been spent on her.Qiao Zijin treated Qiao Nan as a living bank.Now, the money was not being spent on her and was giving Qiao Nan the opportunity to continue her studies.If she had known that this would be the case, she would not have allowed Qiao Nan to keep the money until this day. A few days ago, she would have cajoled Qiao Nan into buying new clothes for her.At this time, Qiao Zijin had a feeling that if it had been a few days ago, she was certain that she could get the money out of Qiao Nan\u2019s hands. But now, it was difficult.\u201cWell, don\u2019t mention the money, how about your learning attitude? Zijin, whatever happened in the past, Mom will not talk about it anymore. But after you go to high school, you need to buck up.\u201d Ding Jiayi thought of Qiao Zijin\u2019s academic results and could not help but start to frown.\u201cI understand.\u201d Qiao Zijin said, her heart on fire. She also wanted to study hard and be like Qiao Nan, who was always in the top three in the cohort, so that her parents would be proud of her wherever they went. She would also be proud of herself.But\u2026\u201cQiao Nan is revising. You did not do well for your junior high school, you can ask her to teach you.\u201d Ding Jiayi\u2019s eyes lit up as she hatched this idea. In fact, she had used the same method before.Qiao Nan was in secondary one and Qiao Zijin secondary two. When Qiao Zijin could not remember what was taught in secondary one when she was solving secondary two mathematical problems, Ding Jiayi would ask Qiao Zijin to check with Qiao Nan.However, to outsiders, Ding Jiayi would always tell them that the elder daughter guided the younger one, and thus the younger one\u2019s academic performance was good, that it was the sacrifice of the elder daughter to fulfill the younger daughter\u2019s wishes.Qiao Zijin\u2019s eyes lit up. Yes, why had she not thought of this? If she kept pestering Qiao Nan, wouldn\u2019t Qiao Nan have less time for revision?\u201cNan Nan.\u201d This time, Qiao Zijin did not knock on the door and went straight into Qiao Nan\u2019s room.\u201cAre you thinking of grabbing my book again?\u201d Qiao Nan did not even raise her head, as she was tackling a mathematical question.For Qiao Nan, to revise mathematics, you must master all the example questions in the book. The notes in the book that she had picked were more comprehensive, and the solutions to the problem were clearer, which allowed Qiao Nan to do more with less.\u201cNo, I am here to ask you questions.\u201d When she peeked and saw that Qiao Nan was reading the subject that she had the most problem with \u2013 maths, Qiao Zijin spoke with more confidence.Qiao Nan moved and closed the book. The corners of her mouth curled and she looked at Qiao Zijin. \u201cDid you come of your own accord, or did Mom ask you to?\u201dIn two lifetimes, since when did Qiao Zijin like to study?\u201cOf course I came of my own accord.\u201d Qiao Zijin helped herself to a place in the room and sat down. \u201cNan Nan, teach me how to do this question.\u201dQiao Zijin arbitrarily turned to a page and pointed to a question.Qiao Nan grabbed the book back, and then took out a workbook and copied the question that Qiao Zijin pointed to.When she saw Qiao Nan doing this, Qiao Zijin laughed.Just shortly after Qiao Zijin laughed, she heard the sound of Qiao Nan tearing the blank piece of paper which noted the question. \u201cDad!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d When Qiao Dongliang heard the younger daughter\u2019s voice, he immediately came over.When Qiao Nan called, Qiao Dongliang came over without any hesitation. Qiao Zijin snorted unhappily.\u201cDad, Sister said that she did not know how to do this secondary one question. I need to revise. Dad, can you teach Sister.\u201d Then, Qiao Nan simply handed that paper with the problem to Qiao Dongliang.She was now unwilling to waste any feeling or money on Qiao Zijin, not to mention time and energy, which were more more precious than money.\u201cI\u2019ll look at it.\u201d Qiao Dongliang took the math problem over. At a look, he did know how to solve this.Qiao Dongliang was not highly educated. As both daughters went to school, Qiao Dongliang would occasionally pick up and read his daughter\u2019s books, thinking that they could make improvements together.It was rare that the daughter did not know something that he did. Qiao Dongliang was feeling motivated. \u201cZijin, you bring your book and pen to the study room, I will teach you.\u201dWithout waiting for Qiao Zijin to decline, Qiao Dongliang pulled Qiao Zijin and left.Seeing the unwilling Qiao Zijin being taken away, Qiao Nan laughed and opened the book to continue with her revision.Rested well for a night, the next day, with the 20 yuan from Ding Jiayi in her pocket, Qiao Nan reported to school.After paying the tuition fees she was left with three yuan. With this three yuan, Qiao Nan simply spent it all on school supplies.She was used to using things that were leftover by Qiao Zijin. All of a sudden, she had new things that belonged solely to her. Qiao Nan was in disbelief.With a handful of new books, Qiao Nan thought about it, and she did not take all the new books home. Instead, she placed everything at the Zhai family\u2019s house.She would rather trouble herself a bit more by waking up earlier to go to the Zhai\u2019s house to retrieve her books than to leave it at home. If she did not pay attention, her mother would scrap all her books.\u201cWhere are the books?\u201d Seeing that Qiao Nan had only brought one book home, Ding Jiayi\u2019s pulled a long face. \u201cWho are you guarding them from?\u201dQiao Nan\u2019s clear eyes stared straight at Ding Jiayi and said in a semi-loud voice, \u201cThe books are too heavy, I can\u2019t bring them back, I\u2019ve left them in the school.\u201d\u201cHow about the money?\u201d Sick of mentioning the books, Ding Jiayi thought of the money. \u201cI remembered that your tuition fees are 17 yuan. Give me the three yuan left over.\u201dThree yuan could provide a few meals of meat.Qiao Nan shook her head. \u201cI have spent all the money, Dad promised to let me buy me a pen and notebook.\u201d\u201cYou are a wastrel!\u201d Ding Jiayi was furious. \u201cIt is impossible to spend all three yuan! How much did you spend? Hurry, take your things and return them to the store to get a refund. Your sister has a lot of leftovers, aren\u2019t they all good to use?\u201dNot waiting for Qiao Nan to answer, Ding Jiayi simply started searching Qiao Nan\u2019s body and vowed to take all the money from her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as she received her pay, the first thing her mother would do was to search through all her pockets, making sure that she did not have any money left on her.Not waiting for Qiao Nan to suffer from humiliation, Qiao Dongliang who had just returned from work witnessed the entire scene.Qiao Dongliang put away his bicycle and shouted, \u201cWhat are you doing!\u201dQiao Dongliang pulled Qiao Nan to his side. Seeing that her arm has been pinched to a bright red, he was all the more angry. \u201cWhat are you up to this time?\u201dDing Jiayi was scared stiff, she pursed her mouth and did not say a word.\u201cWhat, have you lost your tongue?!\u201d Qiao Dongliang bellowed. He used to think that his wife showed favoritism and favored the elder daughter. But now from the looks of it, it was not just simple favoritism. Old Ding seemed to dislike Nan Nan!Nan Nan was already a fifteen-year-old young lady, yet she was treated like a thief, being forced to go through a body check. Wouldn\u2019t Nan Nan be hurting inside?\u201cDad, Mom wanted me to hand over the extra three yuan left from today\u2019s school fees. I said I have used them to buy exercise books. But she insisted that I returned the books and get the money back. Mom said I could use the hand-me-downs from sister.\u201d Since Ding Jiayi kept quiet, Qiao Nan went on to explain to her father.Ding Jiayi did not feel that she had gone overboard. But when she faced Qiao Dongliang, she felt ashamed and could not bring herself to say what she had done.Qiao Dongliang was enraged. \u201cSince Zijin\u2019s leftover stationery is still in good condition, she could continue to use it in high school. Why must you insist that she leave it for Nan Nan?All along the younger daughter had been using her sister\u2019s hand-me-downs, her pencil was only a palm size long.On the other hand, for every new school year, the elder daughter would have an array of new stationery, from pencil and eraser to exercise books. Qiao Dongliang was beginning to feel very upset about this.If Old Ding wanted Nan Nan to be thrifty and frugal, increasing income while decreasing expenditure, Qiao Dongliang would definitely agree and be supportive of her.But Qiao Dongliang realized that Ding Jiayi did not manage to increase income and she only requested her younger daughter to be frugal. What was more, she spent whatever was saved on the elder daughter. How would one say that this was being thrifty and frugal?!\u201cNan Nan, don\u2019t pay attention to your Mom, let\u2019s go inside.\u201d Qiao Dongliang pulled Qiao Nan along with him into the house, not paying attention to the unreasonable wife who showed favoritism.On one hand he persuaded Nan Nan not to harbor grudges, but on the other hand, his wife did not rein in her unreasonable nature. No matter how forgiving Nan Nan was, his wife should know her limits.This would not do. He must have a good talk with Old Ding tonight.Back in the house, Qiao Nan had a drink and said, \u201cDad, you must be tired after a day\u2019s work. I am alright, I am off to do some studying.\u201dQiao Dongliang looked closely at Qiao Nan\u2019s eyes, she really did not seem to mind whatever had happened just now. He felt really bad for her. \u201cNan Nan, your\u2026 your Mom, that\u2019s her nature, she gets muddle-headed as she grows older, don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201dQiao Dongliang hoped that Nan Nan would not blame her mother, however when he saw how unaffected she was, he felt really gloomy and depressed.\u201cOkay.\u201d Qiao Nan responded and carried her books into the house, all her thoughts on her studies.Seeing the younger daughter left quietly, returning to her room to study, Qiao Dongliang did not feel good at all.During dinnertime, Ding Jiayi fried a total of two eggs. Qiao Dongliang gave half of the eggs to Qiao Nan, making Ding Jiayi turn green with anger.As soon as Qiao Dongliang put down his chopsticks, without a word, Ding Jiayi put half of the remaining fried eggs into the elder daughter\u2019s bowl and divided the leftover fried eggs with Qiao Dongliang.At night, Qiao Dongliang tossed and turned on the bed, finding it difficult to fall asleep. He could not forget the overly calm expression that he saw in Nan Nan\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ding Jiayi could not fall asleep either with his tossing and turning.\u201cOld Ding, what do you think of Nan Nan? Zijin is your daughter, and Nan Nan isn\u2019t? Aren\u2019t you worried that your behavior will hurt Nan Nan?\u201cIt would be good if she wasn\u2019t my daughter. You would be a battalion commander by now, and I would still have a job!\u201d Ding Jiayi, who was worried about finances, lost her temper on hearing what he said.If she and Old Qiao still had a job, the savings at home would not be depleted after they were used to pull strings for Zijin, and she would not be so worried now.A depressed Qiao Dongliang said, \u201cWe can\u2019t blame this on Nan Nan. It was our decision to have a second child. We gave up everything willingly, and yet you have shifted the blame onto Nan Nan?\u201dAt the thought of his comrades from the same batch, every one of them valiant and heroic; and looking back on himself\u2014an ordinary salary man\u2014Qiao Dongliang felt suffocated as well.But Old Ding wanted to have a second child, and he really wanted a son. They discussed and came to an agreement.What they never thought was that after quitting their jobs and having a second child, what awaited them was not the son that they had dearly hoped for, but yet another daughter.But after all, it was their own child. Yes, they gave up everything for this child and Qiao Dongliang could not deny that he felt disappointed, heartbroken and even dejected.But life had to go on, and they had another child to bring up. Qiao Dongliang recovered quickly from his disappointment.Nowadays men and women were equal in society. Women could hold up half the sky. If he put effort into bringing up his daughters, who would say that they were not as good as sons?Qiao Dongliang had come to terms with it, but not Ding Jiayi.She still dreamed of being the wife of the battalion commander, with a chauffeur to fetch her around. She also wanted a government job, a simple job with ample pay.And all her dreams had come to an end when the younger daughter was born!Ding Jiayi felt as if she had fallen from heaven to hell. Whenever she looked at Qiao Nan, she could feel bitterness and resentment in her heart.\u201cWho else to blame but her? This family was totally ruined by her. She has dragged down everyone with her. Shouldn\u2019t she sacrifice and make atonements?\u201dSeeing the agitated Ding Jiayi sat up in bed, Qiao Dongliang lowered his voice and pulled at Ding Jiayi. \u201cQuiet down, do you want to wake the kids up? Just look at what you said just now, is that something one would say, why can\u2019t you tell right from wrong? I never knew that you bear such thoughts ever since Nan Nan was born. No wonder you treat Nan Nan in such a manner.\u201dQiao Dongliang finally found out that his wife harbored such thoughts towards their younger daughter.\u201cOld Ding, let me tell you, you can\u2019t blame Nan Nan for what has happened. Your way of thinking is dangerous. If you don\u2019t reflect on yourself and do some serious soul-searching, one day you will lose your daughter, Nan Nan.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. I gave birth to her and brought her up. No matter how good or bad I treated her, she is my daughter in this life. She owes me and has to repay her debts!\u201d She had married well and was the envy of everyone, but the birth of Qiao Nan had destroyed her whole life!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though it was against national planning policy, Old Ding said that having a second child was more important than work or career prospects.Qiao Dongliang admitted that he was undoubtedly a traditional Chinese man who felt the need for a son to carry on his family name. But he also knew that such things could not be forced.Upon listening to his wife\u2019s suggestion, he was tempted or rather muddle-headed enough to give up his work and future, all to try for a son.Qiao Dongliang did not have any regrets having this daughter, Qiao Nan. What he regretted was giving up everything for having a son.If not, his wife would not put all the blame of quitting their jobs and not giving birth to a son on Nan Nan.\u201cOld Ding, I kept quiet but that doesn\u2019t mean I was unaware. You should know what it was like at Ding family and how you grew up at that family. So now you want Nan Nan to go through all the hardships you faced? Is it Nan Nan who owes you or you who owes Nan Nan?\u201dDing Jiayi grew up in a family that was extremely patriarchal. Back then it was the old friend of Qiao Dongliang\u2019s father, a veteran cadre who introduced Ding Jiayi to Qiao Dongliang. The veteran cadre was hoping that they would lead a better life.Qiao Dongliang\u2019s parents had passed away and he did not have any relatives.For people like him, it was very difficult to get married.It just so happened that Qiao Dongliang was only a platoon leader then, slightly better than an average soldier, but did not have good prospects. So it was difficult to find someone of matching status. People from lower rank would not do, while people from higher rank would not take a fancy to him.And so it was difficult to find a wife.As for Ding Jiayi, she came from an average family, but she had three younger brothers.Her parents wanted to hold a grand wedding for their three sons and they would each have their own house; and so there was not enough money to get by.So her parents decided to set their sights on their daughter, Ding Jiayi.Ding Jiayi brought up her three brothers single handedly. In spite of this she was like the servant in the Ding family. She had to do all the chores but there was never enough for her to eat and she still got frequent scoldings from her parents.But Ding Jiayi was not stupid, she made use of the chance to read her brother\u2019s books while looking after him.At times, she could even coach her brother in his studies.And so with the on and off studying, Ding Jiayi finally managed to grasp the elementary school syllabus through self study. She managed to learn most of the Chinese characters.In Ding Jiayi\u2019s time, her standard was considered very high.When Ding Jiayi grew up, her parents had no intention of keeping her at home. They wanted her to work and earn money to support the family.Their idea was to find a \u201cgood family\u201d for her, get a good bride price and marry her off.At that time, Ding\u2019s parents had already sourced a family and even decided on a bride price. Even though they were marrying off their daughter, everyone could tell that they were in fact selling off their daughter.Ding Jiayi\u2019s future husband was not only short, he was already in his forties, even older than her father.But the problem was, after the cultural revolution, he was considered a good catch. He knew how to have fun, served as a vanguard, and was a man of certain authority.Ding\u2019s father had in fact found a son-in-law who served the government.He was old and ugly-looking, but what was worse was his foul temper. No-one had any idea what had happened to his previous wife who had passed away.Knowing that she was to be married to a man like him, Ding Jiayi almost wanted to die.News spread and the veteran cadre knew about this. His old friend was framed by others. As a result, his son who served in the army had no good prospects. Furthermore he did not have any relatives and had difficulties in finding a wife.He surmised that this lady was decent looking and well-educated, except for the fact that her family was not really dependable. The two of them would make a good match.The veteran cadre did not want to throw two unknown people together. He informed Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi of the other\u2019s situation and let them decide for themselves.Ding Jiayi said yes immediately when she learned of Qiao Dongliang\u2019s situation.At that time, being a soldier was the best occupation.No elders at home? That was fine. When she married into the family, she would be the mistress of the house, with no parents-in-law to order her around and she would not need to take care of them.It was fine that he did not have any siblings. As long as he worked hard, it would be better.While Ding Jiayi agreed in an instant, Qiao Dongliang had some doubts. However he accepted in the end and so they ended up getting married.Because of Qiao Dongliang, the veteran cadre helped Ding Jiayi to secure a pretty decent job. She not only got married but also led a much better life.At that time, Ding Jiayi felt that marrying Qiao Dongliang was the wisest decision she had made in her life.Ding Jiayi came from a very patriarchal family. Since a young age she had to bring up her three brothers and handle everything by herself.Ever since having her elder daughter, Ding Jiayi came out of her disappointment quickly and doted on her daughter. She wanted her to have everything that she had missed out on when she was young.When Qiao Nan was born, though she was also a daughter, things were totally different.\u201cBack then you said that we should sacrifice our jobs to have a second child. You begged me to have a second child. For that, I left my favorite army. Old Ding, I made a lot more sacrifices than you to have this child. Nan Nan wasn\u2019t a boy but a girl. But can we blame her for that? You couldn\u2019t bear me a son, and you still dare to blame our daughter?!\u201dQiao Dongliang got all riled up as he spoke and raised his voice.After having their elder daughter, Qiao Dongliang sorted out his thoughts and consoled himself that daughters and sons were all the same. Furthermore, he really loved the army life. He enjoyed being a soldier. His father always said that he was born to be a soldier.For the sake of continuing working in the army, Qiao Dongliang decided to concentrate on nurturing his elder daughter.But when he finally stopped thinking of having a son, Ding Jiayi became bent on having one.\u201cNow you are blaming me?!\u201d Ding Jiayi seemed like a porcupine who stuck out all its spines. \u201cWho was the one who said that sons and daughters are the same, and that he would not blame me for not carrying on the family line, having no offspring. Old Qiao, you are so bizarre in your thinking!\u201dDing Jiayi hated it the most when someone said she could not bear a son. She gave birth to two daughters consecutively and ended up losing both of their jobs.For this, her mother once came from faraway with her grandson, mocking Ding Jiayi for being so heartless, saying that Heaven had punished her and now she could not bear a son.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why did you not set an example for me? In short, if you uses the Ding\u2019s family old rules and thinking on Nan Nan, I will not let you off!\u201dWith that, Qiao Dongliang got up from bed, took his pillow and blanket and went to sleep in the study room. He did not wish to share a bed with Ding Jiayi any more.He did not care how the Ding family treated people, but he would not allow his daughter to be treated like that!\u201cYou\u2026 you, where are you going?\u201d Ding Jiayi was dumbfounded. Old Qiao refused to share a bed with her just because of that wretched girl?On the next day, Qiao Dongliang was just his usual self; but Ding Jiayi\u2019s eyes were puffy red and swollen. She had obviously been crying.Qiao Nan started school at an earlier time than Qiao Zijin. She went out early in the morning, taking the deep-fried dough sticks that Qiao Dongliang bought along with her. She carried her bag and drank her soybean milk, making a stop at Zhai\u2019s house to get her books before heading off to school.Looking at the unfamiliar faces of her classmates whom she could not recall, Qiao Nan started to feel anxious. She could not even remember where she sat in the classroom.She finally found her classroom by checking the class plates outside. She stood dumbfounded at the doorway.\u201cQiao Nan, why are you standing by the door, go in now.\u201d Her class teacher, Teacher Chen saw Qiao Nan and smiled brightly.Qiao Nan always ranked top three in her level and ranked first in her class. Every teacher loved a good student like her.With Teacher Chen\u2019s prompting, Qiao Nan braced herself and went into the classroom.Qiao Nan could no longer remember her classmates, but she still remembered Teacher Chen.In this country, everyone had to go through nine years of compulsory education. In her previous life, Teacher Chen paid a lot of visits to her house when she stopped going to secondary three.Every time Teacher Chen visited their house, her father would urge her to go back to school, but her mother would kick up a fuss. She was frustrated by all this and ended up doing a lot of stupid stuff, breaking Teacher Chen\u2019s heart.Looking at her junior high class teacher, Teacher Chen, she felt a twinge of guilt.Upon entering the classroom, Qiao Nan had no idea where she used to sit. At this moment, Teacher Chen said, \u201cQiao Nan, you had better sit in your usual place.\u201dTeacher Chen pointed towards the second row of the second group, at the seat to the right.That seat was the nearest to the blackboard and the teacher.This was undoubtedly the seat that teachers reserved for good students.Qiao Nan let out a breath and with her bag behind her, walked towards the seat that Teacher Chen said. She put away her bag at the desk.When she was finally settled down, the rest of the classmates also streamed in gradually. Teacher Chen assigned seats to everyone but the good seat besides Qiao Nan still remained vacant.\u201cThe summer break was over. Let\u2019s have a test. Everyone put away your books, do not leave anything unnecessary on the table. Hurry up.\u201dAt Teacher Chen\u2019s words, everyone started to complain.There was a saying that goes: Examinations were a teacher\u2019s weapon while grades were a student\u2019s lifeline.Qiao Nan turned as white as a sheet upon hearing Teacher Chen\u2019s words.Nobody knew the worry, dread and guilt a top student like her was feeling at this moment.She had only spent a few days revising the junior high syllabus and she had to sit a test now. There was no way that she could get a good result and match up to her usual standard.Qiao Nan started to break out in a cold sweat.Teacher Chen was a Mathematics teacher, so he must be testing them on their Maths.She took a few deep breaths, gripped her pen and started writing.Qiao Nan had a systematic way of tackling the test. In order not to run out of time, she started answering the questions one by one. If she was stuck for five minutes, she would skip and move on.When she finished answering the questions she knew and had checked through once, she then went back to the questions that she skipped.It was a good thing that she could answer most of the questions. But in the past, she could start solving the problems as soon as she gets the papers without stopping for a moment to think.Now, she had to think through the solutions and she was not as good as before in her mental and manual calculations.After finishing the paper, Qiao Nan was drenched in sweat, with her clothes plastered to her back.Qiao Nan only had time to check through once before the alarm went off. Teacher Chen then started to collect the papers.When class was over, Qiao Nan headed for the washroom to wash her face.The Maths test was finally over, but there must be other tests for the rest of the main subjects.On the first day of school, Qiao Nan was kept busy taking tests for the three main subjects Mathematics, Chinese and English. Her head was spinning from the tests.Qiao Nan did not feel well after the tests; she barely made it back home.\u201cOh, you are back so early today?\u201d Ding Jiayi saw Qiao Nan and pulled a long face, her eyes full of mockery. \u201cYour Dad is not back yet!\u201dDidn\u2019t the wretched girl always come back at the same time as Old Qiao?Pierced by Ding Jiayi\u2019s mocking voice, Qiao Nan came back to her senses. She felt the heavy weight of her books on her back. Without a word, she ran inside the house like a rabbit, sped past Ding Jiayi and went into her room, sliding the bolt in place.\u201cMom.\u201d Qiao Zijin saw that Ding Jiayi was about to follow after and stopped her. \u201cDad is still furious. We can\u2019t help that Nan Nan is not sensible. But you definitely do not want to keep on quarreling with Dad.\u201dFather was the sole breadwinner in the house. If mother fell out with father and he refused to give his pay to her, what was going to happen to her?\u201cSince Nan Nan is not going to work to lighten Dad and your load this year, Mom, you should stop quarreling with Dad and making yourself unhappy.\u201d\u201cYou are right. Your Dad and I have been together for so many years, we have never had such a fierce quarrel before. It\u2019s not worth it to fall out with your Dad for this wretched girl.\u201d Ding Jiayi calmed down and said, \u201cYou mentioned that secondary three syllabus is much more difficult, and not as easy as before, right? Let\u2019s wait and see her results this year. She had made a promise with your Dad. If she fails to score well, she would have to work no matter what!\u201dShe finally managed to calm Ding Jiayi down. Actually Qiao Zijin did not tell Ding Jiayi that secondary three syllabus might be difficult for her; but she had no idea if it was easy or difficult for Qiao Nan.Qiao Zijin could not help but pray that just like her and the other female classmates in class, Qiao Nan would find the secondary three syllabus difficult, and in particularly would fail terribly at Maths and Chemistry.\u201cNan Nan, it\u2019s Dad.\u201d Qiao Dongliang reached home one hour later and went to look for Qiao Nan.\u201cDad.\u201d Qiao Nan opened the door to let Qiao Dongliang in.Qiao Dongliang knitted his eyebrows, \u201cNan Nan, your room is this small?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had never stepped inside his daughters\u2019 room before.Last time round was the first time he had stepped into his elder daughter\u2019s room; and today was the first time he went into the younger daughter\u2019s room.Because of this, Qiao Dongliang was shocked when he saw that Nan Nan\u2019s room was only a third the size of Zijin\u2019s room. In fact, his study room was twice as big as hers.\u201cDad.\u201d Qiao Nan did not answer but stared at Qiao Dongliang, wondering what was the matter.\u201cNan Nan, wait a minute.\u201d The younger daughter might be used to it and have no grievances but Qiao Dongliang could not bear it.Without a word, Qiao Dongliang went into the study room, packed everything and put it in the living room.He then dismantled Qiao Nan\u2019s bed and brought it piece by piece to the study room.\u201cOld Qiao, what are you doing now?\u201d Ding Jiayi heard noises and came out from the kitchen. She saw Qiao Dongliang bringing in Qiao Nan\u2019s bed into the study room.Qiao Dongliang did not bother to look at Ding Jiayi, he said curtly, \u201cNan Nan\u2019s room is way too small, I am going to switch the study room with her bedroom.\u201d\u201cThat will not do. That room is not big enough for a big man like you. You would be so cramped there. She is so petite, she doesn\u2019t need such a big room.\u201dDing Jiayi wanted to stop Qiao Dongliang. Though she disliked the younger daughter, she treated her husband fairly well. She couldn\u2019t bear to see a 1.8 meter tall man like him, cramped up to read in the room that was as small as a sparrow\u2019s nest.\u201cSince a big man like me might be uncomfortable, then let\u2019s have Zijin switched rooms with Nan Nan?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was amused and angered.Old Ding was not showing favoritism, she was treating Nan Nan like an outsider.\u201cThat won\u2019t do. Qiao Nan is the youngest in the house. Why can\u2019t she stay in a small room?\u201d\u201cA day has 24 hours, I only use the room for a few hours. But Nan Nan has to sleep in the room. She has stayed there for so many years, so why can\u2019t I?\u201dQiao Dongliang just could not get through to Ding Jiayi. He harbored no hopes of Ding Jiayi coming to her senses and offering to help him. He moved the bed into the study room and assembled it.Qiao Dongliang took out all his books. But the desk and chair had no place to go. \u201cNan Nan, I will leave them for you, I will think of ways to get some wood and make another set for myself.\u201dCompared to the elder daughter\u2019s room that was well-furnished, the younger daughter\u2019s room was not only small, it was also without a desk and chair.All these years the two daughters had been doing their studying in their rooms, Qiao Dongliang could not imagine how the younger daughter had made it through those times.All along Ding Jiayi had kept it from him and Qiao Nan was too quiet, never uttering a word of complaint.The squeaky wheel gets the grease, the saying was very true.Qiao Dongliang was an inattentive father and furthermore Qiao Nan never once complained. So he had no idea that the elder daughter and younger daughter were treated so differently. If any, he thought it was only a slight difference in the treatment.\u201cThank you, Dad.\u201d Qiao Nan nodded and accepted her father\u2019s suggestions.\u201cNan Nan, I will get you a lock later. You are a young lady now, this room will be under your care.\u201d Qiao Dongliang thought for a moment, and decided to get the lock and install it for her the next day.Qiao Nan\u2019s eyes turned red and she felt warm inside. Her voice was choked up with tears, \u201dOkay.\u201dShe was such a letdown in her previous life, her mother disliked her, and her father gave up on her.In fact, her father was a good father. She did not know how to cherish him; she had let down the few people who really cared for her once and again.\u201cDad, I had tests today.\u201d Qiao Nan once gave up in despair, but now she realized that she had family love. Qiao Dongliang was a good father to Qiao Nan. She could not help but start crying. \u201cI\u2026 I fear that I did not do well for my tests, Dad, will you be disappointed in me?\u201d And give up on me just as in the previous life?Qiao Dongliang was completely at a loss seeing the younger daughter in tears. He wanted to wipe away the tears. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, I have given you my promise that you have half a year\u2019s time. Even if you did not do well this time, you can strive for better results next time. I believe that you will definitely be able to catch up.\u201dQiao Dongliang spoke with confidence. He truly believed that the younger daughter would be able to catch up on her studies.When the elder daughter flunked her middle school exams, she never even cried once for her results.\u201cNan Nan, no hurry. There\u2019s still half a year to go. Don\u2019t stress yourself out.\u201d Qiao Dongliang thought for a moment and added. He knew that some of the kids at the quad have always been doing well, but because they were too stressed, when it was time for the final exams, they failed to perform and fumbled the ball.\u201cOkay.\u201d Embarrassed, Qiao Nan wiped the tears off her face. She was no longer a fifteen-year-old kid; mentally, she was already thirty now, yet she was still crying her guts out in front of her father.\u201cMom.\u201d Qiao Zijin went to the kitchen looking for Ding Jiayi. She heard Ding Jiayi ranting to herself. \u201cMom, don\u2019t be angry. Nan Nan is already in tears.\u201dDing Jiayi was startled. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to cry about? I should be the one crying. Now Old Qiao treats me just like the step mother of that wretched girl. The whole world now revolves around her, what\u2019s there for her to cry about?\u201d\u201cI seemed to hear Nan Nan said that she did not do well in her tests today.\u201d Qiao Zijin smirked. If Qiao Nan did not do well, did it mean that it would not take one year\u2019s time; that within half a year, she would quit school and work?\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Ding Jiayi did not believe her. \u201cShe was burning with fever when she had her exams in the final year of elementary school, yet she came in fifth place in the school. She couldn\u2019t possibly have screwed it up.\u201dWhen the subject was about the younger daughter\u2019s results, Ding Jiayi had no doubts at all. She trusted that she would do well for her exams.It was another story if those were syllabi that Qiao Nan had never learned. If not, she would never flunk her exams.Qiao Zijin was upset. Whenever she sat for exams, her mother would asked about her results anxiously. \u201cIt was definitely true. Nan Nan said it herself. She was shocked to tears. Mom, maybe she was down with fever a few days ago and it burnt her brain.\u201dShe clearly remembered that right before Qiao Nan kicked up a fuss, she went into Qiao Nan\u2019s room that morning and felt her forehead, it was burning hot.\u201cBurnt her brains? Yes, but she burnt her conscience not her brains. But, did she really said that she flunked it?\u201cFlunked it.\u201dDing Jiayi thought for a moment. \u201cDon\u2019t be too happy. Your Dad promised to give her half a year\u2019s time. We would have to see if she is able to catch up on her studies by then. Maybe she has been using gimmicks all along. She might have memorized all the content in the textbooks. That\u2019s why now that I sold all the textbooks, she could not study for one whole summer break, and has finally shown her true colors.Ding Jiayi has been through this before, so she could tell at once.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You are as intelligent as me, if you put in more effort and time, you would definitely be better than Qiao Nan. I would do anything for you. You must strive and work hard so that I can stand up straight in front of your Dad!\u201dShe has devoted everything into nurturing the elder daughter. She must be successful to prove that she was right all along.\u201cI understand, Mom. Don\u2019t worry, I will study hard. When I enter high school I will catch up on my my studies and I will definitely make you proud.\u201d Qiao Zijin felt a twinge of guilt at using up all the savings at home.\u201cAlright, school starts tomorrow. Remember to do more reading. Worst comes to worst, just memorize all the textbooks. If Qiao Nan can do it, so can you.\u201dDing Jiayi was brimming with confidence. It seemed that she could already see the day whereby the elder daughter enrolled into college.\u201cOkay.\u201d Qiao Zijin smiled happily. But she became depressed when she was back in her room.It did not matter whether Ding Jiayi was unhappy or not, the study room ended up being Qiao Nan\u2019s new room, and Qiao Nan\u2019s old room now became Qiao Dongliang\u2019s study room.Though Ding Jiayi bickered with Qiao Dongliang about this, seeing that he had made up his mind, that night she straightened and tidied up the new study room.The next day Qiao Dongliang was home earlier than usual. As soon as he reached home, he headed for Qiao Nan\u2019s room, took a look inside and installed a lock outside her room. Ding Jiayi was boiling with anger.What was this lock for? To guard against who?It was definitely not to keep out thieves, it must be to guard against her!Qiao Nan, who was at school, had no idea of this at all. Back in the classroom, people were discussing her unusual performance in the recent exams.Teacher Chen had intended to have a talk with Qiao Nan. But when he saw how dejected she looked, he could not bear to say another word. \u201cQiao Nan, though you did not do well this time, you have a strong foundation, and your performance was still pretty good in the class. It\u2019s just that you did not maintain your usual standard. If you meet with any problems in your studies, feel free to come to me, understand?\u201dQiao Nan had never scored below 90 points for her Maths exams, a full score was the usual case.This time she scored 85 points; to others it was a pretty good result, but to Qiao Nan it was an unprecedented low score.In this round of pre-testing, there were more than 240 students from secondary three. Qiao Nan used to be among the top ten, but now she was ranked at around 70th to 80th place.If it had not been for Teacher Chen who noticed Qiao Nan\u2019s results and insisted on finding out the ranking for individual subjects, Qiao Nan would know her exact ranking among the cohort.Teacher Chen pondered for a while and walked up to Qiao Nan. \u201cQiao Nan, how did you spend your summer break? Did you do some revision?\u201dIn the past, Teacher Chen never had to worry about Qiao Nan\u2019s studies, but this time he was shocked by Qiao Nan\u2019s results.Qiao Nan did not know if she should be sad or relieved. The best result in her class was a score of 92 points and her result of 85 points was actually considered above average.Picking up what she used to study in school was really not an easy task. Qiao Nan could feel despair sinking in.\u201cAll my textbooks are gone.\u201d\u201cGone?\u201d Teacher Chen looked at Qiao Nan in surprise. \u201cWhere have they gone?\u201d\u201cMy Mom sold them.\u201dAfter the rebirth, Qiao Nan had sorted out her thoughts. She would no longer hide the deeds her mother has done. No, she did not wanted to gain sympathy, it was just that she felt it necessary for people concerned to understand her situation and to give her a helping hand when needed.She really needed her teacher\u2019s help to give her some coaching in order for her to work on her results and to catch up to her usual standard.Teacher Chen was rendered speechless. They would be doing revision in the second half of secondary three. There wouldn\u2019t be any new knowledge points. The middle school exams would cover a large portion of secondary one and two syllabus.What kind of parents would sell all the textbooks when they knew that their child would be taking the exams soon? Was it intentional?Thinking of what he overheard recently Teacher Chen asked, \u201cQiao Nan, I heard that your sister enrolled in the The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China?\u201dThe High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China was a good high school in the area, but it was not easy to enroll in.\u201cYes, today is the enrollment, she will be starting school officially.\u201d Qiao Nan was stunned for a moment. The saying was right, good news went unnoticed while bad news travels fast.The act of using money to buy results might not be news ten years later, but it was very rare now. Furthermore, her mother used that money to pull strings instead of buying results.If father knew that mother went to look for that grandpa all because of Qiao Zijin, he would surely explode in anger.Teacher Chen\u2019s countenance fell.If one would say that Qiao Nan could enroll in the The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, he would have no doubt about it; but Qiao Zijin? He did not believe it. Besides, it was hard fact that Qiao Zijin has always been an average student, there was no way that she could make it to that high school.Teacher Chen did not wish to speculate about how Qiao Zijin manage to enroll in that high school, let alone make wild conjectures about Qiao Nan\u2019s mother purpose in selling her textbooks.Teacher Chen was puzzled when Qiao Nan had only scored 85 points in the exams. But now he understood and felt sorry for her instead. \u201cIt\u2019s alright if your textbooks are gone. I will come up with a solution. Your foundation is good, there\u2019s still a year to go, you can definitely catch up. You know the way to my house. Whenever you have any questions, feel free to come looking for me. Understand?\u201d\u201cThank you, teacher.\u201d Qiao Nan no longer felt dispirited. She plucked up her courage and said, \u201cRegarding my textbooks, I have already settled the problem.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cI went to the thrift shop to buy a set of textbooks. I have been reading up. I will definitely trouble you for areas that I am unclear of.\u201dTeacher Chen smiled. \u201cNo troubles at all. Qiao Nan, don\u2019t give yourself too much stress. You must learn to strike a balance between work and rest, understand?\u201d\u201cAlright, I will.\u201dMaths results were out, next would be Chinese and English.Qiao Nan\u2019s grade for Chinese was about the same as her Maths. She scored a few marks above eighty. It was an average grade. For those questions that required memorizing, she scored zero marks for them.Those students who did not know the inside story were all shocked when they found out that Qiao Nan had not fared well for two subjects in a row. Some were gloating while some were speculating that something must have gone wrong with her, either she had become stupid or she had gone astray.The top student that they all looked up to had fallen from grace in just one summer break\u2019s time?Top student to slacker in two months\u2019 time?The Chinese subject was taught by a pretty and gentle female teacher. Teacher Lee was exasperated when she saw Qiao Nan\u2019s results. She did not get a good sleep last night, her mind was preoccupied with how she was going to knock some sense into Qiao Nan. She did not want her to feel that since her results has always been good, there was no need to put in hard work. She had thoroughly disappointed her with her results.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It pained her to see her scores. But Qiao Nan answered brilliantly for every subjective question. In particularly for her essay, she scored flying colors.As a Chinese teacher, it had been a long time since Teacher Lee saw such a well-written essay.Aside from her neat handwriting, her essay was fair and reasonable; the language used though simple had deep meaning; it was logical and well structured. All in all, she could not find any fault with it.Such a brilliant essay deserved full marks. However the teachers from the Chinese team had multiple discussions and decided that Qiao Nan\u2019s use of words was too simple and deducted one mark for that.What did one mean by back to basics?This was back to basics!Actually Teacher Lee did not agree to the deduction and wanted to have a discussion with the Chinese team.But she was infuriated when she saw Qiao Nan\u2019s answers for the components in front.Memorization component accounted for a total of 10 marks. Qiao Nan did not get a single mark!As for the other four marks, it was all pure memory work.In other words, if Qiao Nan had studied what was taught in class while Teacher Lee tried to fight for that extra one mark, this average Chinese test paper would then score full marks!It was common to have a full score for elementary Chinese paper. But for junior high level, in particularly secondary three, it was rare to see full marks for Chinese papers.This could actually be the highest results among the cohort, a once in a blue moon full marks. But Qiao Nan wasted it all and ended up with 85 points, placed somewhere in the middle. How could Teacher Lee not be angry?Teacher Lee felt that it was a pity for Qiao Nan to score this kind of result.Because of this Teacher Lee did not sleep at all last night. She pondered over what she should say to Qiao Nan, in order for her to understand and reflect on her mistakes.Teacher Lee was even angrier when she realized that Qiao Nan also had not done well in Maths, the subject that she was always good at.But now Teacher Lee no longer thought that way.Teacher Chen knew that Teacher Lee would be upset by Qiao Nan\u2019s results. When he learned of Qiao Nan\u2019s situation at home, he went back to the office and informed Teacher Lee about Qiao Nan\u2019s complicated situation.After learning of Qiao Nan\u2019s situation, Teacher Lee could only sigh in exasperation. No matter how hardworking the child was, if their parents were unreasonable, what could a child do?For those areas that require memorizing, no matter how hard Qiao Nan tried to commit the knowledge to her memory, if her parents had sold her textbooks, there was no way that she could revise.Teacher Lee looked at Qiao Nan with mixed emotions. The other students in the class were bewildered. Qiao Nan had not done well in her exams. Why didn\u2019t Teacher Lee reprimand her? Why did she stare at Qiao Nan but with no words of displeasure?Come on, Qiao Nan deserved a serious scolding!After the long summer break of fun, most of the students did not do well in the exams, they were bound to be spanked by their parents.But they would at least be comforted by seeing Qiao Nan being reprimanded by the teachers.A lot of the students were looking forward to seeing Teacher Lee rant at Qiao Nan. However after a while Teacher Lee said, \u201cAll of you should learn from\u2026 Qiao Nan, look at how well written her essay is. Then take a look at your own essay, is that even an essay? After a long break, all of your essays are rubbish.\u201dTeacher Lee bombarded the students for not doing well. \u201cQiao Nan, write a copy of your essay and paste it on the blackboard at the back of the classroom. Of course, everyone should just learn from the way she wrote her essay. Qiao Nan, do you know that your results were a real pity? It should have been\u2026 forget it, it was painfully agonizing to talk about it. Study hard in the future, you shouldn\u2019t lose these 10 points.\u201dQiao Nan flushed red with shame at Teacher Lee\u2019s criticism and praise.In particularly when Teacher Lee gazed at her, she felt a twinge of guilt, as if she had done something wrong to Teacher Lee.At this, Qiao Nan thought what a cruel mockery this exam was.After the lesson was over, Qiao Nan felt a shadow behind her, she turned and saw a girl glaring at her. She seemed to be unhappy. \u201cQiao Nan, hurry up and make a copy of your essay. I wanted to see just how brilliant it is.\u201dQiao Nan had not much impression on this classmate. Qiao Nan was also not interested in making copies of her essay.Without a word, Qiao Nan took out her essay from her exam paper, and pasted it on the blackboard at the back of the classroom, \u201cLook at it yourself.\u201dAfter which she went on to study her Maths exams paper, paying attention to the problems.\u201cYou.\u201d Zhao Yu was enraged at Qiao Nan\u2019s attitude. \u201cWell there\u2019s nothing to be proud of. You only did well for your essay and scored an average score of 85 points. That\u2019s not the highest!\u201dThere was no way to hide the fact that Qiao Nan did not do as well for this exam and was told off by Teacher Lee.She heard Zhao Yu grunting to herself and turned back to look at her. What exactly was wrong with this young lady?But she turned her attention back to the Maths exam paper after one glance.Zhao Yu grew angrier by the moment, seeing how Qiao Nan appeared to be unaffected, and could not be bothered to bicker with her.With a look of disbelief, Zhao Yu snorted and went to look at Qiao Nan\u2019s essay. She had intended to pick on every small error that she could find. But after a long time reading the essay, Zhao Yu had to admit, the essay was very well written.So what, she might have lose out to her this time, but there was always the next time and the time after that!Zhao Yu clenched her fists and returned to her seat to read her essay book.Soon after, the class had an English lesson. Unlike Teacher Chen and Teacher Lee, Teacher Yu was the only teacher who was all smiles on the way into the classroom. \u201cAfter a summer break, a lot of students have lagged behind in their studies. Of course, there are some who have improved. Do you all know what\u2019s the highest English score for the secondary three cohort and who is that student?\u201d\u201cHow many points?\u201d\u201c98?\u201d\u201cBet it was not more than 99.\u201dThere was an essay component for junior high English. Just like a Chinese essay, it would be difficult to score full marks.\u201cIt is definitely not Qiao Nan.\u201d Zhao Yu snickered and whispered softly.Zhao Yu also sat in the second row, very close to Qiao Nan. So Qiao Nan overheard what she said.Qiao Nan arched her eyebrows. She must have messed with this young lady in the past. Today was the second time she had picked on her.\u201cNobody has the answer? Well, I also didn\u2019t think that there would be a full marks this time! And the most commendable part is that this full marks score came from our class, Secondary Three Class One. Qiao Nan, come and get your paper.\u201dEvery teacher usually went by one of the three styles to hand out the exam papers \u2013 firstly, from highest to lowest; secondly, from lowest to highest; and lastly, randomly.As for today, Teacher Yu did not seem to be handing out according to the second or third scenario. If so, Qiao Nan was the one who scored full marks?A lot of the students who were hoping that Qiao Nan would flunk her third subject, so as to have an excuse to rebut their parents back at home, were distraught when the teacher called out Qiao Nan\u2019s name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So should it not be acceptable that they did not do well?But Qiao Nan deprived them the chance of using this excuse with her full marks English test paper.\u201cLiar, she must have copied the answers!\u201d Zhao Yu shouted, with a look of disbelief, \u201cThere has never been a student who gets full marks in secondary three!\u201dTeacher Yu knitted the eyebrows, what was this?!\u201cWho does she copy from, you? The student besides Zhao Yu blinked her eyes at her and asked curiously.The classroom resounded with laughter.Teacher Yu had said that among the two hundred students, Qiao Nan was the only who had full marks.If she had copied her answers, who could she have copied from?Zhao Yu flushed red in an instant. She knew that she was too agitated and had blurted out something silly.Qiao Nan was the only student in the level who had the highest English results. There was no way she could copy from other classes let alone her class. Qiao Nan had the highest score; it was other students who would copy from her; if she was to copy from others, then she would not be able to get her full marks.Qiao Nan walked calmly to the platform to get her test papers. Among all the subjects, she was most confident in her English.In order to earn more money to satisfy her mother and to let Qiao Zijin lead a good life, she would always take up part time jobs.But after all she was a human not a machine. As time goes by her body could not take it anymore.Then she found out that there was this job of English-Chinese translation where she could work from home. It paid well and the work was not tough. Qiao Nan worked hard to learn English and attained a level six certificate. She then started to take on translating jobs.Up till the point where Qiao Nan was knocked down by a car and driven to her grave by Ding Jiayi, there were still a few translation documents at her rented apartment.\u201cQiao Nan, I could tell that you did not waste your time in this summer break at all. The grammar was fabulous and way beyond your level!\u201d Teacher Yu looked at Qiao Nan smilingly, and commented on a line in her essay.Teacher Yu had never taught them this grammar. It was not in the syllabus of junior high school either. It would be only be covered in high school.A junior high student could use the grammar taught only at high school in her English essay. If this did not warrant full marks, what would?Qiao Nan\u2019s face stiffened, she paused for a moment before saying, \u201cThis\u2026 This summer break I met a foreign friend. He taught me all these.\u201d\u201cWell done.\u201d Teacher Yu was extremely pleased. \u201cAs I have said, if you want to muster English, you have to work up your courage. Do not be afraid to speak. This would be a good training to help you to speak the language well. Qiao Nan is a very good example. If you all have the chance, you can do so as well. Foreigners are usually more enthusiastic and friendly. This is an excellent learning opportunity.\u201dBecause of an exam, Teacher Tan and in particularly Teacher Lee were dismayed. Teacher Yu was the only one who was all smiles to the extent that Teacher Yu seemed to be walking on air.Qiao Nan used to come in the the top five places if not top three places among the whole level. But this time round, she did not even ranked among the first ten places.Thanks to her English results, Qiao Nan\u2019s overall ranking for the three subjects did not fall very far behind. She was placed 49th in the level and around 10th place in her class.Qiao Nan let out a sigh of relief after knowing her results.There was no doubt that her results would suffer, but it was not as bad as she imagined.Qiao Nan knew that she was lucky this time. Asides from Chinese, she had picked up Mathematics not long ago.She happened to have just finished revising on the knowledge points tested during the exams.Otherwise, not to mention 80 points, she might have failed her exams or scored only 40 points.It was the same for all the six classes, they were all discussing the exam results on the first day.After Qiao Nan\u2019s essay was pasted on the blackboard at the back of the classroom, most of her classmates took a look and had to say that it was truly well written.But what was weird was that the students from the remaining five classes all crowded around to look at Qiao Nan\u2019s essay.Her classmates was proud yet unhappy. \u201cYou aren\u2019t from the same class, why do you all keep coming to our class? Get out, get out.\u201dQiao Nan\u2019s essay was considered a study resource for Class One. Students from other classes should not be allowed to share the information.Students at this age were mostly sensitive and thin-skinned. They followed their Chinese teachers\u2019 words and plucked up their courage to go to the other class to look at the essay. But they all went back red with embarrassment when they were told off by Qiao Nan\u2019s classmates.This soon reached the ears of the six Chinese teachers.The teachers from the other classes went to speak with Teacher Chen and Teacher Lee, remarking that it was too overbearing of the students. After all they were schoolmates, and everyone should learn from each other.Teacher Lee was still grouchy over the deduction of that one mark. She refused to give in, with a slight lift of her chin she said, \u201cOh, what\u2019s there to look at, after all it\u2019s one mark short of full marks. Qiao Nan\u2019s standard is good enough for our class. For other classes, they should learn from the better students.At her words, all the teachers from the Chinese team knew that Teacher Lee has not gotten over that one mark, so they gave an awkward smile and left.But for the Chinese teachers who read Qiao Nan\u2019s essay, they all knew that the results this time did not mean everything.Judging from her exam papers, if Qiao Nan was to memorize all the classroom knowledge, she would definitely emerge as the dark horse of the Chinese subject, and her results would no doubt be astounding.In that case, no matter how mischievous or lazy Qiao Nan was, Teacher Lee knew that she only had to get her to copy the knowledge points that had to be memorized for one whole semester, if not one whole year, and there was surely no way that she would score zero for the memory component in her middle school exams.Besides, Qiao Nan had always been a good student. It\u2019s just that she did not perform up to standard this time.Teacher Lee finally sent off her colleagues. Wearing an excited expression on he face, she said proudly, \u201cQiao Nan the little girl, she kept on fumbling the ball. Next time I must make sure to supervise her so that she do not commit the same mistakes again. No, I shall make her report to the office everyday and to memorize a lesson a day.\u201dAs a colleague, Teacher Chen could not tell if Teacher Lee said it out of anger or was in fact proud of her student.Teacher Lee had found a way to help Qiao Nan, but Teacher Chen was still very troubled.Teacher Lee only had to get Qiao Nan to memorize by hard and she could catch up sooner or later. But what about her Mathematics?Qiao Nan did not mention and he was unclear as well. Which part of the lessons was Qiao Nan unfamiliar with?While Teacher Chen and Teacher Lee were trying to think of ways to help Qiao Nan, the English teacher, Teacher Yu was the only one who was sipping tea leisurely, saying that it tasted especially good today!A day passed by quickly. After getting her results for the three subjects, Qiao Nan went home and realized that everyone had reached home, including Qiao Zijin.As soon as she stepped into the house, Qiao Zijin wasted no time to ask her, \u201cNan Nan, I heard your results were out, how did you fare?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQiao Nan was stunned momentarily, she curled her lips and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do very well.\u201dAs expected!Qiao Zijin and Ding Jiayi heard this and their eyes sparkled. Ding Jiayi jumped in to bombard Qiao Nan. \u201cLook at this, Old Qiao, you insisted on letting her continue with her studies. Alright, we let her study, but look at what kind of results she got. She has let you down and wasted all your hard earned money. Never mind about the school fees that has been paid. After this half year, why not let her quit school and work. She is not good in studying and does not have any good prospects, she might as well start work early and earn more money. For all you know, we might be able to lead a better life.\u201dDing Jiayi seemed like she was planning for Qiao Nan, but among their family of four, aside from Qiao Dongliang, the three of them all knew that if Qiao Nan were to quit school and work, all her pay would be taken away by Ding Jiayi.Qiao Dongliang let out a deep breath, \u201cWhat are you shouting for? Nan Nan did not do well this time, and whose fault is this?\u201dFortunately Qiao Nan had given Qiao Dongliang a heads up, so aside from a slight disappointment at the start, he was able to accept it readily.\u201cWho is to blame, definitely not me!\u201d Ding Jiayi flared up, she was not the one who went to school.Qiao Dongliang said bluntly, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault! Who sold off Nan Nan\u2019s books? You sold her books, even if she wanted to study, there was nothing for her to read! Nan Nan won\u2019t even keep her books at home and you still refuse to repent. If news gets out, won\u2019t you find it a disgrace?\u201dQiao Dongliang never once asked Qiao Nan about the books, he was doing it for Ding Jiayi, to preserve her dignity.A daughter had to guard against her mother. If people knew of this, Ding Jiayi would be so disgraced.He tried to maintain her pride time and again, but Ding Jiayi did not know her limits. She looked so high and mighty as if she was about to take flight!\u201cNan Nan, ignore your Mom. It\u2019s alright, don\u2019t you still have a semester to go?\u201d After lecturing Ding Jiayi, Qiao Dongliang went on to encourage Qiao Nan, \u201cLet me have a look at the three test papers. Is there anything that you do not know, we can pick it up bit by bit, You can also ask your teacher, take it easy.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Qiao Nan nodded and took out her test papers.The Maths papers was on the top of the stack. Qiao Dongliang let out a breath of relief when he saw that Qiao Nan had scored 85 points for it.When he heard from Nan Nan that she had lagged behind, he was worried that she might have fared badly. But 85 points was not considered a low grade.Qiao Nan had 85 points for both Maths and Chinese.Qiao Dongliang\u2019s eyes brightened when he saw that Qiao Nan had scored 100 points for her English test. The sparkle in his eyes was so much brighter than that of Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin when they learned that Qiao Nan had scored badly for her exams. \u201cOne\u2026 one hundred? Nan Nan, is the English exam difficult, how many students scored one hundred points?\u201d\u201cI am the only one in school who scored full marks. The student in the second place had 93 points.\u201dQiao Dongliang moved his mouth, faced flushed with pride, after a while he only managed to say a word \u2013 good. He patted Qiao Nan and consoled her, \u201cActually, actually this is already pretty good.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s good about it, how did you rank this time?\u201d Ding Jiayi did not notice that the elder daughter had turned pale. She carried on to rebut Qiao Dongliang\u2019s words.\u201c49th.\u201dWhen Ding Jiayi heard that Qiao Nan ranked 49th place, she jumped in elation. \u201cOld Qiao, did you hear that? You spent all that money on her school fees, and this is how she repays you? 49th? In the past, she never even ranked below ninth place\u2014which was already a bad grade \u2013 let alone 49th place. Look at her wild nature, and yet you still let her continue with her studies, isn\u2019t that a waste of money?\u201dQiao Nan arched her eyebrows and smiled.\u201cLaugh, you still have the nerve to laugh.\u201d Ding Jiayi was enraged. To think that she could still laugh after the scoldings, she must be a dimwit.\u201cMom, can you preserve some dignity for sister. Can\u2019t you see that she is on the verge of tears?\u201d Qiao Nan said coldly.She ranked 49th place; but her worst results were in fact Qiao Zijin\u2019s best results in secondary three.\u201cDid you hear what Nan Nan said? Zijin, don\u2019t worry, I will treat everyone equally. I supported Nan Nan to continue her studies, and that is the same for you. You just have to work harder in high school and buck up.\u201d Qiao Dongliang\u2019s expression turned cold.The younger daughter\u2019s worst results was the best results of the elder daughter. When the elder daughter made improvements last time, he even thought of having a celebration.If one were to judge the right to schooling based on results, the elder daughter would be the first to be disqualified.\u201cOld Ding, I suddenly find that what you said is very true. If one has the aptitude, then she should study, if not there is no point in forcing them. After all, not everyone has the talent for studying. Zijin, don\u2019t be stressed out, if you feel it\u2019s alright, you can continue with your studies; if you feel that you are not cut out for studying, it\u2019s okay, you can start work earlier. Your Mom is right, one won\u2019t make it big by studying. In that case, it might be good to pick up a skill and start earning money, you can also lead a good life in future.\u201dDing Jiayi placed importance on results purely to go out against Qiao Nan; but Qiao Dongliang meant it with all his heart.\u201cOld Ding, there\u2019s no taking back of your words. Let\u2019s set some ground rules to prevent future arguments. You have always been supportive of Zijin in her studies and you also enrolled her in high school. Let\u2019s do this, if Nan Nan fails to do well in her exams, and the results are worse than the lowest results of Zijin\u2019s, then we will consider whether she should continue or not. Otherwise, if you bring up this topic again, my attitude towards you would not be this pleasant.\u201dQiao Zijin paled at Qiao Dongliang\u2019s words, while Ding Jiayi\u2019s expression turned sullen.No matter how angry and unwilling Ding Jiayi was at Qiao Dongliang\u2019s words, and for comparing her beloved elder daughter with the younger daughter, she could not come up with words to rebut him.Because they had to be fair!In fact, Qiao Dongliang\u2019s suggestion was not fair from the start.Why must Qiao Zijin\u2019s worst results be used as a benchmark to decide if Qiao Nan had the right to study?That was because Ding Jiayi favored Qiao Zijin, and Qiao Dongliang had to at least maintain her dignity.Qiao Dongliang was being considerate, but Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin did not give him any credit for it.The two of them had waited for ages before Qiao Nan finally flunked her exams this time. There might not be a next time.Besides, Qiao Dongliang said that the condition was that Qiao Nan must perform even worse than the lowest grade of Qiao Zijin. At the thought of this, Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin felt hopeless.They both knew, no matter how badly Qiao Nan did for her exams, there was no way that she could have performed even worse than the lowest grade of Qiao Zijin.Ding Jiayi paused for a moment. Since the younger daughter did much better than the elder daughter, why was she so sure that the elder daughter had better prospects than the younger daughter, and insisted that the younger daughter quit school?\u201cOld Ding, did you hear what I said just now?\u201d Qiao Dongliang repeated when there was no response from Ding Jiayi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qiao Nan made a funny face at her father, \u201cDad, you talked about sister\u2019s results just now, she must be upset.\u201dSo her mother was on her way to console her.\u201cYour sister\u2026\u201d Qiao Dongliang sighed and shook his head in frustration. \u201cI finally realized that your sister might be sensible but that temper of hers\u2026 she has been spoiled by your Mom.\u201dNan Nan was just back from school, yet the elder daughter rushed up to ask her about her exams.Qiao Dongliang thought of what happened just now and felt dismayed. When the younger daughter said that she flunked her exams, the elder daughter curled her lip and sneered.Why would the elder daughter find joy in Nan Nan flunking her exams? Did she have the same perception as Old Ding? Did she hope that Nan Nan would quit school?\u201cNan Nan, how is your relationship with Zijin recently?\u201dQiao Nan pursed her lips. Could she say that they had never been close? It was only a one-sided relationship where Qiao Zijin cajoled and lied to her? She was the only one who was nice to her sister?\u201cAs usual.\u201d Qiao Nan gave an objective answer of their relationship. But Qiao Dongliang failed to read between the lines.\u201cNan Nan, your sister\u2026 you are much more sensible than your sister. I am not telling you to give in to her, but if she gets stubborn, don\u2019t be mad at her or take it to heart.\u201dUnlike Ding Jiayi, Qiao Dongliang was fair and just. It is usually the elder siblings who give in to the younger siblings. He could not bring it to himself to tell Qiao Nan to give in to Qiao Zijin.The two sisters were not too far apart in age, so it was normal to have small arguments.But they were one family, Qiao Dongliang\u2019s only hope was that despite all the quarrels, they would not take it to heart. After the quarrels, they should make up and not bear grudges.\u201cOkay.\u201d Qiao Nan nodded in agreement. Qiao Dongliang did not make excessive demands of her.\u201cAlright, you should go back to revise. You have lagged behind this time, you must work hard.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dQiao Nan barely made it past the exams on her first day of school. For the rest of the school year, she diligently went to school everyday, and set more reading targets for herself.Teacher Chen and Teacher Lee also gave her additional assignments to work on.Luckily Qiao Nan was not in actual fact a fifteen-year-old kid, if not she would not be able to handle the increasing workload.Even though they might understand that what the teachers did was all for the good of the student, but they might not be able to accept it after all.The two teachers were also worried that the huge workload would result in a backlash.But Qiao Nan had a very positive attitude and was serious in her work. She always did a great job on the additional assignments. The two teachers were pleased and always gave her special treatment.It was the second week after school reopened. This Monday it was Qiao Nan\u2019s turn to be on duty. She had to stay back after lessons and could only go back at a later time.Qiao Nan let the other students go after they cleaned up the classroom.She checked the classroom, making sure that the windows were locked. With that she closed the door, took her bag and left.She had finished reading a volume of books within a week\u2019s time. She decided to stop over at Zhai\u2019s house in exchange for more books to revise. And so she did not take the main road home, instead she took the side road to the back door of Zhai\u2019s house.\u201cBeat him to death!\u201d\u201cIn future he won\u2019t dare to mess with us again.\u201d\u201cYou disgusting piece of filth, try getting up and shouting at us again.\u201dAs soon as she turn into the side road, Qiao Nan heard quarreling sounds. It sounded like someone was in a fight.Qiao Nan was scared stiff. She did not want to meddle in others\u2019 affairs and was about to turn and walk away.Zhu Baoguo took blows from all directions. While he was in a daze, he heard footsteps coming towards him, though light and almost inaudible, he could hear them clearly.His body was numb with pain, at the brink of losing consciousness. Zhu Baoguo desperately hoped that someone would save him. But the light footsteps drifted further and further away.Holding his breath, a disappointed Zhu Baoguo closed his eyes, and was about to give in to his pain, letting out his breath. There was no-one in this world who cared for him.\u201cHurry up, right here.\u201d Soon after the fading footsteps appeared again. It seemed like there were two other people.The footsteps were fast and hurried.\u201cWhat are you all doing? Stop now.\u201d\u201cCrap, someone is here.\u201d\u201cF**k, they have guns!\u201d\u201cRun!\u201dThe group of people who were punching Zhu Baoguo looked up, and saw a young lady running towards them with two police officers. They paled and ran off hurriedly without Zhu Baoguo.They only knew how to throw fists. But the two people who ran towards them had guns. A bullet could take a life.\u201cIsn\u2019t he the son of Zhu family? It\u2019s not good, his injuries are very serious, we have to take him to the hospital as quickly as possible.\u201d\u201cOkay, you take him to the hospital, I will go back to inform them. We need to have someone around.\u201dThis was the last conversation Zhu Baoguo heard before losing consciousness.After making sure that Zhu Baoguo was safe, Qiao Nan patted herself on the chest and finally relaxed, letting out a sigh of relief.The kids nowadays were so vicious. Every blow was so ruthless. She could not even tell what the injured person looked like as his face was all covered in blood.Zhu Baoguo, the name seemed familiar.Qiao Nan wasted a lot of time here and there. She quickly exchanged a new set of books and sped home.\u201cNan Nan, you are slightly late today.\u201d Qiao Dongliang saw the younger daughter and asked her out of concern.\u201cOh, I am on duty today. I am the last to leave. From now on, I guess I will be slightly late every Monday.\u201dQiao Zijin had started school. Unlike Qiao Nan who walked to school, Qiao Zijin who studied in high school had to live on campus. She came back home at most once a week.Now Qiao Nan was the only child at home.\u201cIt\u2019s already secondary three. Your class should have selected their class committee. What did you get assigned to this time? Ding Jiayi asked coldly, with a mocking tone in her voice.The younger daughter has always been quiet. She did not know how to please people. At home, she would not even speak up to 24 sentences in 24 hours. Unlike the elder daughter who was a smooth talker and well-liked by everyone, she was guarded and reserved. People like her might be unpopular and found it difficult to adapt when they entered society.\u201cI heard Zijin was the literary committee member at school.\u201dQiao Nan laughed, \u201cMom, the high school curriculum is even more demanding than junior high school. Sister has been selected as a committee member? Does she not intend to study?\u201dQiao Dongliang paused for a moment. At first he thought that it would be good to be selected as the committee member, but at the mention of results, he has some hesitation. \u201cNan Nan, if given the opportunity it would be a wonderful training, but it\u2019s okay if you aren\u2019t selected, studies are more important.\u201dQiao Dongliang was more sincere, hoping to give the younger daughter some encouragement.\u201cWhat\u2019s so good about her, it\u2019s obvious that she was not selected.\u201d\u201cWho said that I am not the class committee member?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Literature and Art had the most arduous but thankless jobs, unless Qiao Zijin was interested in a career path in this field.Otherwise, whenever there were school activities, the Literature and Art Committee members worked the hardest, could she still study?Qiao Zijin did not have good grades, by putting Literature and Art under her charge, was she being valued or mocked? It did not cross her mother\u2019s mind.\u201cNan Nan, what role did you take on?\u201d Qiao Dongliang smiled, to him, being a school committee member was a good matter.\u201cVice Class Monitor in class. Dad, I\u2019ve always been the Vice Class Monitor. Every semester, I bring home the certificate of award to me for being one of the top three model students and outstanding class committee member.\u201d\u201cVice Class Monitor?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was surprised. He did not know that his younger daughter had been the Vice Class Monitor for years. \u201cWhere\u2019s the certificate of award? I don\u2019t think I have seen it at home before.\u201dTop three model students and outstanding class committee member, these awards were worth being proud of!Each year, when Qiao Dongliang saw other children instead of his own receiving an award, he would console himself that it did not matter. As long the elder daughter was obedient and sensible and the younger daughter was good in her studies \u2013 these mattered the most.It only occurred to Qiao Dongliang today that his child had actually received awards before, and these were the best awards. Top three model student, that was not an award that could be given to any Tom, Dick or Harry.\u201cIt\u2019s just Vice Class Monitor, not Class Monitor. What is so great about this.\u201d Ding Jiayi\u2019s face was awkward.\u201cAren\u2019t you quite pleased that Zijin became a Literature and Art committee member? Don\u2019t tell me that Vice Class Monitor is worse than Literature and Art committee member.\u201d Qiao Dongliang was speechless. What was Old Ding\u2019s logic?If this continued, even if the elder daughter\u2019s feet stank, Old Ding would think that it was fragrant.\u201cNan Nan, four semesters have passed. Two certificate of awards for each semester, you should have received at least eight, take them out and show me!\u201dHis child was an award-winner!In future, when his colleagues from the same department asked, he finally had something else that he was proud of to talk about besides his younger daughter\u2019s academic results.\u201cAren\u2019t they just a few pieces of lousy paper, there\u2019s nothing to see. It\u2019s already so late, are we still eating?\u201d Ding Jiayi interrupted Qiao Dongliang and quickly served the food.As Qiao Zijin was not at home, Ding Jiayi initially did not want to buy any meat. After all, the family funds were low.But Qiao Dongliang requested, so Ding Jiayi had no choice but to prepare meat for today\u2019s dinner.To shut Qiao Nan up, Ding Jiayi filled Qiao Nan\u2019s bowl with meat using her chopsticks: \u201cHurry up and eat, then go back to your room to revise your homework. Don\u2019t waste the money that was used to let you go to school.\u201dQiao Nan\u2019s eyes flashed with sarcasm, she did not argue with her mother and proceeded to eat her meat.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The then Qiao Dongliang frowned. \u201cOld Ding, Nan Nan\u2019s awards, where have they gone?\u201dDing Jiayi slapped the chopsticks on the table. \u201cAren\u2019t they just a few pieces of paper? How should I know where they are? They do not belong to me. It\u2019s paper, not gold. Isn\u2019t it normal for them to become rotten?\u201d\u201cRotten?\u201d Qiao Dongliang\u2019s face changed. \u201cEven if it\u2019s paper, there is no reason that it would be rotten after two years. Tell me honestly, where did Nan Nan\u2019s awards go?\u201dNan Nan had clearly received many awards but he did not get to see or hear about them once. Of course, this was all his wife\u2019s doing.Qiao Dongliang pressed on and refused to stop, Ding Jiayi wanted very much to throw a fit but could not lose her temper when she saw Qiao Dongliang pulling a long face. She reluctantly said: \u201cI used it to start the fire while I was cooking.\u201dYes, Qiao Nan\u2019s awards were always burnt and used to start the fire by Ding Jiayi shortly after she brought them home.Therefore, it was impossible for Qiao Dongliang, who was always the last to reach home after his work, to see the awards that Qiao Nan had won.\u201cStart the fire?\u201d Qiao Dongliang raised his voice. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you burn yourself? Aren\u2019t there any ignition straws at home? You have to use Nan Nan\u2019s awards to start the fire? Do you want to go out and ask others, which parent will use the awards received by his child to start a fire, you\u2019re really proud.\u201d\u201cWhat is there to be proud of? Isn\u2019t it just a piece of paper, can keeping it make it produce gold or lay eggs?!\u201d Ding Jia was angry. She even used all the money at home, not to mention that few pieces of paper.Those few pieces of paper, keeping them would only take up space, burning them would at least put them to some use.\u201cFine, you\u2019re good, you can. Satisfied?\u201d Qiao Dongliang would not bother to talk to Ding Jiayi anymore. His wife could not hide the younger daughter\u2019s academic results as he would ask about them.As for these awards, they were all burnt by his wife. Nan Nan said that she had won the awards but that now they were just all words and no evidence.Fine, it seemed that for many years, his wife had hidden a lot of matters from him.\u201cZijin became a Literature and Art Committee Member and you were so pleased. You insisted to wait till the weekend to prepare food for her. Nan Nan is Vice Class Monitor and that is not good enough, even her certificate of awards are just waste paper. Okay, you dote on Zijin, I dote on Nan Nan. Each of us will take care of one, no-one is being left out.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d Ding Jiayi\u2019s face was red with fury. \u201cZijin is not your daughter, are you so biased?\u201d\u201cThen Nan Nan is not your daughter? You only have Zijin in your heart. Both are my daughters, I will not treat one worse than the other. With you, I am not worried that Zijin will suffer and be wronged. With me around, I will not let Nan Nan continue to live like she did before.\u201dThis time, Qiao Dongliang was determined to stand on the side of his younger daughter.He really had not known that the younger daughter was so outstanding.At the thought of the younger daughter\u2019s words earlier, and her results, Qiao Dongliang immediately figured out why the younger daughter was the Vice Class Monitor instead of the Class Monitor.It was not that the younger daughter was not qualified to be the Class Monitor. It was because the teacher was afraid of tiring out the younger daughter with too many matters. Hence, she arranged for her to take on the deputy role.The teacher in the school had spared such a thought for his younger daughter. This went to show how highly they valued her. This also proved that the younger daughter was a person with a bright future and had gained the favor of her teachers.The child who was well-liked by the teacher in the school was neglected to this extent by her own mother. Qiao Dongliang did not know what to say except to sneer.To think that half a month ago, his wife was still clamoring for the younger daughter to quit school and find a job. Qiao Dongliang broke out in a cold sweat.Fortunately Nan Nan insisted on studying and he also supported it. Otherwise, they would have held back Nan Nan\u2019s future with their own hands.\u201cNan Nan, from today onwards, you don\u2019t need to tell your mother what happens in school, your mother is busy and doesn\u2019t have the time. You tell Dad, Dad will help you think over the matters.\u201dA man should take care of external matters while his wife take care of domestic affairs \u2013 this did not work for his family.Fortunately he found out about the situation, otherwise he really could not imagined how much longer his younger daughter\u2019s future would be held back by his wife.\u201cOkay.\u201d Qiao Nan chewed the meat in her mouth hard. Today, the meat seemed to be extraordinary fragrant, extraordinarily delicious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She would not only lose the argument, but also cause an ugly sight, and her father would not be pleased about it.Having to go through another lifetime, Qiao Nan found the way of life that would make it work.The reason why Qiao Zijin could please her mother, and let her father think of her as a good daughter, was because she knew how to put up a \u201csensible\u201d front before her father.Being sensible was not difficult. She, too, knew how.The more her mother did, the more wrong her father knew Qiao Nan endured. There was no need to defend herself, she just needed to walk away silently and, certainly, her dad\u2019s heart would ache for her.After being taken advantage of by Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin for a lifetime, Qiao Nan knew that, even if they were one family and the closest-of-kin, she needed to play some mind games. Well, they were the ones who had started it.An eye for an eye.She did not wish to live like the way she did in her previous life \u2013 no dignity and pride. No sense of self-worth.Upon reflection, Qiao Nan knew that the greatest mistake that she made in her previous life was to have done and said too much in the family.On the contrary, when she did and said nothing, she sensed that silence was better than words.Seeing that the daughter was already used to Ding Jiayi\u2019s bias and picking, and Qiao Nan\u2019s eyes did not have any warmth in them though she was smiling, Qiao Dongliang\u2019s heart ached and his tone became more serious. \u201cWho are you throwing the chopsticks at? Pick up the chopsticks.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not picking them up. Why is Qiao Nan doing her homework now? She saw the chopsticks drop to the floor and she did not even pick them up?\u201d If Ding Jiayi bent down and picked up the chopsticks, she would feel humiliated, so of course she was unwilling to and thus ordered Qiao Nan to do it.\u201cNot picking them up?\u201d Qiao Dongliang laughed and simply walked over to pick them up himself.When Ding Jiayi saw Qiao Dongliang doing that, she thought he had relented and today\u2019s matter would come to a close. Just when she wanted to heave a sigh of relief, she was shocked and frightened by Qiao Dongliang\u2019s next move.It was just a pair of chopsticks, but Qiao Dongliang broke them into half with his hands and threw them on the table. \u201cSince you don\u2019t want this pair of chopsticks, there is no point in keeping them. Wash the dishes up, I am sleeping in the study room tonight.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 \u201d Ding Jiayi was shaking, and finally said regretfully, \u201cIt\u2019s just anger, why take it out on the chopsticks. Now, we need to spend money on chopsticks again.\u201dAs the family savings were low, Ding Jiayi was trying to cut the expenses by half, racking her brains on ways to gradually save money.Not to mention the recent expenses, the 5000 yuan savings that was accumulated by the couple for over a decade, it was an impossible target by saving just one or two cents per day, even for 20 years.However, if any major event occured at home, such as when illness struck, she definitely had to cough up this sum of money.Regarding the 5000 yuan, Ding Jiayi was still terrified at the sight of the passbook. She often had nightmares, fearful that Qiao Dongliang would find out about this.Unless Qiao Nan quit school and worked. If not, she would not be able to make up for the lost savings by herself.\u201cEach of them are fiercer and tougher than me, all are my lord!\u201d The furious yet helpless Ding Jiayi slapped her thigh, she was full of humiliation, and wiped her tears.But after she calmed down and finally regained her strength, a table full of stuff was awaiting her to clean up.In the past, she was always the one who prepared the meals, and Qiao Nan washed the dishes.However, since Qiao Nan\u2019s fever that holiday, she no longer took on any housework of her own accord.Both daughters were at home. In front of Qiao Dongliang, Ding Jiayi could not just request for one of the daughters, Qiao Nan, to help out.While washing the dishes, Ding Jiayi sighed, life in the past was good, she had the final say in everything at home. Qiao Nan was also obedient, she took up almost half the load of the housework.Whenever she argued with Old Qiao, whatever the matter was, Qiao Nan would always take the blame on her own accord.It was bizarre. It was just a fever, and Qiao Nan became a changed person.If she had not given birth to Qiao Nan, Ding Jiayi almost suspected that Qiao Nan was swapped by someone, and this was the fake one.Qiao Nan, who was doing her homework, could not care less about what happened at home, and she totally forgot about what she had done tonight.She had forgotten. But it did not mean that others had also done so.The next day, Qiao Nan attended school as usual, but upon reaching the school, she noticed that many schoolmates, some of whom she did not know, were looking at her strangely.Qiao Nan frowned but did not take this to heart.When she arrived at the classroom, Qiao Nan saw that the seat beside her was empty, she did not think much of it. She put down her school bag and started revising.At this time, Zhao Yu, who was seated nearby, casted her a look of disdain and snorted. \u201cWhat is there to pretend, who are you trying to fool, shameless.\u201dAfter hearing this, Qiao Nan pulled a long face, she was as fierce as a tiger when she glared at Zhao Yu. She told herself that this was just a spoilt brat, and one that was rebellious and going through puberty. She would not take matters to heart with her.It had been half a month since school re-opened, of course, Qiao Nan knew why Zhao Yu did not see eye to eye with her and why her words always sounded like sour grapes.It was because Zhao Yu was the class\u2019s Chinese Representative.In the past, Zhao Yu\u2019s grades in Chinese were not the best in class, but her essay writing certainly was.However, this trend was broken by Qiao Nan in the first model exam after school started. Zhao Yu thus started to dislike Qiao Nan.Recently, Zhao Yu was extremely motivated to read essay writing books, and sweared that she would score better than Qiao Nan in the next Chinese test.Qiao Nan was silent. Zhao Yu, who thought that she was feeling guilty because she did something wrong, was complacent, \u201cWhy are you still coming to school? Don\u2019t tell me you think that we don\u2019t know the shameless thing that you\u2019ve done. Though you are thick-skinned enough to do it, I am embarrassed to say it. Such a person is not fit to sit with us in the same classroom and be our school mate.\u201dZhao Yu\u2019s words were neither too loud nor soft, but it was audible to the rest of the classroom.At the thought of the news that they heard this morning, everyone was silent. They way they looked at Qiao Nam was really awkward.\u201cI already thought it was strange, it was already secondary three and she could get full marks for the exam. No wonder, she had sent someone to steal the English paper and checked the answers. This way, who in the class can\u2019t get 100 marks?\u201dQiao Nan slammed her books down, hard on the table.She did not even wish to tolerate her mother and Qiao Zijin, why would she tolerate an outsider?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let me warn you, please stop your behavior of infringing on my personal rights. If not, I can sue you for slander. You are not of legal age, but you are already 16 this year. The country\u2019s law is that anyone 16 years or above can be legally charged. Are you prepared to be sued by me?\u201cMe, what crime have I committed?\u201dZhao Yu was stupefied, she had merely stated a few facts, at most they were just gossip about Qiao Nan. What did that have to do with committing a crime?\u201cDon\u2019t you feel ashamed that you don\u2019t even know that you\u2019ve committed a crime? Don\u2019t tell me that you think you don\u2019t need to be responsible for what you said?\u201d Qiao Nan rolled her eyes. \u201cIf you have nothing better to do, please read more books on politics. We are already in secondary three, there\u2019s a lot of law information in those books. Moreover, you are a high school student, don\u2019t act like a moron about law.\u201dThreatened by Qiao Nan, Zhao Yu was really scared, she started to flip the pages of this year\u2019s newly issued politics textbook.True enough, there was a lot of law-related knowledge in the textbook.Although there was no mention of slander in the book, she thought about the look of of conviction on Qiao Nan\u2019s face when she had said those words, and did not dare to gossip about Qiao Nan anymore.The rest of the classmates had ears for themselves. They clearly heard Qiao Nan and Zhao Yu\u2019s argument.Initially, when everyone heard that Qiao Nan scored full marks because she cheated, they felt that it was unfair. Why should someone who cheated on the exam receive the best grade for an individual subject?But everyone did not have that deep an enmity with Qiao Nan.Besides, this was ultimately a rumour which had just started today, not everyone believed this.Not long after, a girl came over and sat beside Qiao Nan. \u201cQiao Nan, do you know why Zhao Yu said that about you just now?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Previously, Zhao Yu just sounded like sour grapes.\u201cSomeone has been spreading that you are close to a group of hooligans, those hooligans were bad and did not have clean hands and feet, they climbed into the school to steal things before. So someone said that your english grades were so good because the hooligans helped you to steal the test papers prior to the exam, that is why you scored full marks.\u201dSince when was she close to hooligans?\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that people believe in such baseless rumors.\u201d Qiao Nan was shaking her head. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about the rest, if I had the means to get the test papers, why did i score 85 marks for Chinese and Maths? Put aside maths, the marks deducted for my Chinese test were those that required memorizing.\u201dUpon hearing what Qiao Nan said, her classmates felt that she had a point.True, since she was stealing, why would they steal for one subject and not all?That Chinese paper of Qiao Nan, which Teacher Li was so angry about, all of the 14 marks were content that required memorizing.In the whole class, except for Qiao Nan who scored zero out of 14 marks, even the slower ones could get around seven or eight marks.The first thing that needed to be done after receiving the test paper was to find the answer and memorized them.Based on her results, it was illogical that she had cheated.\u201cTrue, I did not believe.\u201d That girl\u2019s face turned slightly red after hearing Qiao Nan.Qiao Nan replied with only laughter. Was the girl being nice by clearing her doubts or trying to gather more information? As an adult, she was not oblivious.If she really did not believe the rumor, why was she embarrassed?Qiao Nan laughed. The other party seemed to know that she did not get what she expected and felt self-conscious, so she quickly returned to her own seat.When peace resumed, Qiao Nan could not help thinking, who was the one who could not see eye to eye with her, who went around spreading such ridiculous rumors?Hooligans.Thinking about what happened throughout her aggregated two lifetimes, Qiao Nan recalled one matter. This happened recently \u2013 it was yesterday.Yesterday, she saw a group of people surrounding, beating up and scolding a person. She directly found the policeman and saved the person. Was it because of this?While reading her book, Zhao Yu, whose mind was floating elsewhere, stole a glance at Qiao Nan. Actually the mastermind of the rumors about Qiao Nan was not anyone else \u2013 it was none other than Zhao Yu.However, Zhao Yu\u2019s initial version of the rumor was not the same.Yesterday, Zhao Yu looked for Teacher Li to request Teacher Li\u2019s guidance on her essay. Hence, Zhao Yu left school late, slightly later than Qiao Nan.The two of them headed home in the same direction \u2013 they had to pass the same main road.As she felt awkward, Zhao Yu would rather slowly follow behind Qiao Nan\u2019s back than to catch up with Qiao Nan to go home together.Upon reaching the quad, Qiao Nan changed her direction as she wanted to go to the residence of the Zhai family.Zhao Yu, who followed behind, saw that something was amiss. Qiao Nan should not be heading home in that direction. Where was she going?Out of curiosity, Zhao Yu decided to tail her after much consideration.When Zhao Yu caught up with Qiao Nan, it was at the time when Qiao Nan brought the police to save the person.Zhao Yu did not see anything else, she only saw Qiao Nan running towards that group of hooligans.The hooligans had sticks in their hands and blood on their bodies. At the sight, Zhao Yu was scared out of her wits. Carrying her schoolbag, she ran all the way home. When Zhao Yu reached home, her heart was still pounding loudly.When the neighbors\u2019 children came to look for her to study together, Zhao Yu could not help but mention this matter, and told them she wondered when Qiao Nan had gone astray \u2013 she was even in such a good relationship with the punks?When the neighbors\u2019 children confirmed the identity of the few hooligans, they unintentionally revealed one matter. \u201cIt was those people who came to our school during the summer vacation to steal things. If Qiao Nan is close to them, she will certainly be able to top the class every year.\u201dRumors are always spread the wrong way. The most recent version that was spread to the school was that Qiao Nan had always scored well in her exams because she relied on this group of hooligans to help her steal the test papers.Qiao Nan was a good student, that eye-catching name made it impossible for people in the school to not know her.When there suddenly a scandal related to a model student, the speed of the news spreading was faster than that of the light.\u201cQiao Nan, Teacher Chen requested that you go to his office.\u201d The class\u2019s Maths Representative said after he returned from Teacher\u2019s Chen\u2019s office, where he sent the homework to.Zhao Yu laughed. \u201cStill not admitting, even Teacher Chen summoned her for a talk, perhaps her parents will be called next.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been Qiao Nan\u2019s classmate for several years, I don\u2019t believe she is such a person.\u201d The student who was seated at the same desk as Zhao Yu started to be argue with her again.\u201cZhou Lei, what is your problem, why are you always putting in good words for Qiao Nan, what benefit did you receive from Qiao Nan?\u201dZhou Lei was the class\u2019s Sports Representative. Lean and energetic, he was certainly good at sports, especially basketball. His three-point shots were amazing.10 years later, this was a full-grown little basketball prince who would make the young ladies\u2019 hearts throb.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhou Lei was good looking, good in sports and above-average in studies. Zhao Yu was proud to be deskmates with such an outstanding boy.But when Zhou Lei went against her to speak up for Qiao Nan, Zhao Yu\u2019s mood was not good.Zhou Lei looked at Zhou Yu with some disdain. \u201cI should be asking you this question. Qiao Nan did not offend you, why do you dislike her? Are you happy to gossip about Qiao Nan? Will you gain anything because of this? I really don\u2019t know what you girls are thinking. If you think Qiao Nan\u2019s Language grades are better than yours, then score better than her next time. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s ugly to gossip?\u201d\u201cZhou Lei, you, you side with Qiao Nan so much, do you like Qiao Nan?\u201d Zhao Yu\u2019s face turned red with anger.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Zhou Lei rolled his eyes at Zhao Yu, and was not willing to talk to Zhao Yu anymore.Qiao Nan did not know that, after she left, Zhao Yu and Zhou Lei, the pair of desk mates, had argued with each other because of her. She gained all the teacher\u2019s attention once she stepped into the office.\u201cTeacher Chen.\u201d\u201cQiao Nan, you\u2019re here, stand slightly nearer.\u201d There was a stool next to Teacher Chen. It was for Qiao Nan to sit on.Qiao Nan sat down. After thinking, she had the feeling that, most likely, Teach Chen had called her in because of the matter that was mentioned by Zhao Yu minutes ago.\u201cQiao Nan, have any delinquent teenagers been pestering you lately, asking you for money?\u201dAfter hearing Teacher Chen\u2019s words, Qiao Nan breathed a sigh of relief and felt much better. This was because she knew that Teacher Chen question implied that he trusted her.Qiao Nan shook her head. Thereafter, she told Teacher Chen what happened yesterday. \u201cI don\u2019t know those people.\u201d\u201cIt was so serious?\u201d Teacher Chen was shocked. \u201cThen the man who was beaten up. Do you know him?\u201d\u201cNo, the man who was beaten, his face was swollen and covered in blood. I don\u2019t know who he is either.\u201dAt the thought of the pitiful look of the beaten man, Qiao Nan shivered.\u201cGee\u2026\u201d When the other teachers in the office heard this, they were shocked too. These hooligans were too merciless.If not for Qiao Nan who had sought the help of adults, the man could have lost his life.Teacher Chen was slightly undecided. He was not sure whether to commend Qiao Nan for her bravery in helping others in need, or reprimand her for her boldness and disregard for her own safety.A group of punks were fighting and a young lady, who had no means of defending herself, dared to run there to interfere in the commotion. She had too much bravery.\u201cTeacher Chen, Qiao Nan did the right thing for this matter. She was smart and not impulsive \u2013 didn\u2019t she look for someone to help?\u201d On the other hand, the rest of the teachers in the office was impressed by the way Qiao Nan handled the situation. She not only protected herself, but also saved someone. There was nothing wrong with it.If Qiao Nan had ran up on her own to to shout at them, then she deserved to be criticized.Teacher Chen snorted, she would dote on her own students. \u201cWhat happened to the man?\u201d\u201cThe policeman brought him to the hospital.\u201d\u201cTrue, you can go, you don\u2019t need to worry about the rumors in the school, I will help you to find a way out.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d With Teacher Chen\u2019s absolute trust in her, now, Qiao Nan did not care about the rumors at all. It did not matter what others said.When the secondary three students saw Qiao Nan coming back from Teacher Chen\u2019s office, she did not hide. Instead, she looked bright and cheery, and had a gentle smile on her face.Judging by this, Qiao Nan did not seem to have received a scolding from Teacher Chen.For today\u2019s maths lesson, Teacher Chen solemnly and carefully used the first minute of the lesson to address the matter regarding Qiao Nan. \u201cAll of you are junior high school students, you have the ability to differentiate right from wrong. I hope that you will not be fooled by a few rumors. We are a team. We should be united. I trust my students and you should trust your classmates too. As to the rumors spread by other classes, I will think of a way to resolve this later. But I do not wish to see our class having problems and having an internal conflict. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dAlthough Teacher did not specify Qiao Nan\u2019s name, everyone knew what matter she was referring to.Teacher Chen had made her stand. The whole class had dispelled their suspicions of Qiao Nan.In the school, it was a very serious offense to steal the exam papers. The rumors about Qiao Nan were passed on for a day and the school did not take any action. On the contrary, it was a quiet week.Within a short five and a half day\u2019s time, the rumors about Qiao Nan had almost died down in the school.It was quiet at school, but not at home.Somehow, Qiao Zijin, who was in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, got to know about this rumor. Qiao Zijin reached home later than Qiao Nan. Upon reaching home, she started to scold Qiao Nan from the bottom of her heart as soon as she put down her school bag. \u201cNan Nan, even if you wish to study that much, you shouldn\u2019t do this sort of thing. If you explain nicely to Dad and Mom, can they disallow? Dad and Mom do not expect us to be very successful, but we need to be down-to-earth, and do the right things. The cunning tricks you played, in exchange for the grades, are only short-lived. Can they last forever? You can do that for now, but when you reached the middle school exam, do you think you can still use this scrupulous way. For middle school exams, can you still do this?!\u201dWhen she was scolded by Qiao Zijin, Qiao Nan took a step back. Her face was cold. With disdain, she lifted her hands towards her face and wiped it once.Qiao Zijin had sprayed her saliva all over Qiao Nan\u2019s face!Wasn\u2019t that dirty?!\u201cZijin, what happened?\u201d At the sight of the elder daughter being furious, Ding Jiayi quickly asked.\u201cDad and Mom, you don\u2019t know the matter about Qiao Nan, she made all of us lose face. My grades are not excellent but they are not that bad either. I think a person should be honest and know their own ability. A man must be true to himself! But Qiao Nan? In order to produce good grades, she actually befriended those people of dodgy background in the society, and let them steal the exam papers for her. My heart sinks at the thought of this!\u201dThinking that Qiao Nan had relied on this method to score better than her over the years, Qiao Zijin was in a rage.She really thought that Qiao Nan was smarter than her but actually, she had resorted to such tricks.\u201cNan Nan, explain yourself. Because of you, Mom and Dad argued many times. You hardly anger Mom, but because of you, Mom was angered a few times this month. You are the child of Mom and Dad, they raised you, do you still have a conscience?\u201d\u201cWhat, is there such a matter?\u201d Ding Jiayi immediately believed the words of the elder daughter. \u201cYou little brute!\u201dHaving said that, Ding Jiayi raised her hand towards Qiao Nan\u2019s face.Qiao Nan bent her head down, as agile as a monkey, she ran towards Qiao Dongliang and hid behind his back. \u201cThe two of you are good, one is my real mother, and the other my real sister, you believe whatever the others said. You didn\u2019t even ask me, or allow me to explain? Dad, are they really my next-of-kin?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was also shocked to hear Qiao Zijin\u2019s words, but Nan Nan\u2019s performance had always been consistent. He had never heard Zijin mentioned such matters, hence, those must be false rumors spread by others. \u201cNan Nan, have you heard of it?\u201dEven the elder daughter heard it, it could not possibly be quiet at the younger daughter\u2019s school.\u201cYes, because of this, Teacher Chen specifically asked to see me in the office on Tuesday. But unlike Mom and Sister, when Teacher Chen heard about this, he asked me if any delinquent teenagers have been pestering and blackmailing me.In other words, outsiders did not even believe that Qiao Nan would do such a dishonest thing. But Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin heard merely the slightest ruffle in the wind and said it as though it was real.Was that the expected behavior of your next-of-kin?\u201cTeacher Chen did not suspect you at all?\u201d Qiao Dongliang blinked. After all, when he first heard this, even he, the real dad, had a second of doubt.\u201cNo.\u201d Qiao Nan shook her head. \u201cTeacher Chen even told the class straight, told my classmates to stop spreading such untrue rumors.\u201d\u201cSo what exactly is going on here?\u201d\u201cDad, I\u2019ve been wronged till death regarding this matter. Except for this summer vacation where I could not revise at home, in the past, there wasn\u2019t once that I have not obediently stayed home and finished all the housework chores. Don\u2019t talk about being in contact with those hooligans, I don\u2019t even have time to read books, how I wish that there are 48 hours in a day!\u201dQiao Nan\u2019s words startled the others. Whether Qiao Nan was busy in the past, Ding Jiayi knew best.When summer vacation came, Qiao Nan had little opportunity to go out.As Qiao Nan said, Ding Jiayi simply pushed all the household chores to Qiao Nan whenever Qiao Nan had the time. At most, Ding Jiayi prepared the meals.Every time Qiao Nan had some spare time and wanted to read books, Ding Jiayi would definitely find an excuse to make Qiao Nan work.So, 24 hours, besides sleeping for eight to nine hours in the bedroom, Qiao Nan was within Ding Jiayi\u2019s sight for the rest of the time. Qiao Nan simply did not have any chance to get to know those delinquent teens.Once again, Qiao Dongliang shocked by another truth. So, during summer vacation, when the younger daughter had spare time, she did all the household chores?Though it was not easy for Qiao Zijin to find fault with Qiao Nan, she would not give up. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that this matter sprang out of nowhere?\u201dShe did not believe it. If Qiao Nan had not done such a thing, then why would people spread the news with every detail vividly described?\u201cNan Nan, what do you say?\u201d Qiao Dongliang looked at Qiao Nan. It made sense that no-one would be so free to make up a story without any facts, but he too believed that the younger daughter would not do such a thing.\u201cThat\u2019s right, you have to explain this matter properly to us. If not, you don\u2019t need to study anymore, in case you go astray,\u201d Ding Jiayi added as she regained her senses.Regardless of the truth of the matter, this was a good chance.\u201cOld Qiao, I think you better listen to me, don\u2019t let Qiao Nan study anymore. Her character has gone astray with studies. We might as well let her work and let others watch over her, then she will not be able to mix with those bad guys anymore. The children of our Qiao family may not be the best in their studies but they cannot have a bad moral character.\u201d\u201cMom, do you mean that, regardless of the truth of this matter, you won\u2019t let me go to school to prevent me from going astray, and let me go to work. Mom, I am puzzled, Dad\u2019s income is not considered little, it\u2019s enough to pay for both Sister\u2019s and my education. Why do you have to insist that I work, as if our family does not have enough to meet our needs?!\u201dQiao Nan initially did not want to expose that Ding Jiayi had spent all the family savings because of Qiao Zijin.But Ding Jiayi kept using her education as a threat, Qiao Nan could not help it and had to reveal Ding Jiayi\u2019s secret.It was time to let her father know the special situation at home, rather than foolishly allowing her mother to cover up the whole matter.\u201cDad, how much savings do we have? Mom can\u2019t wait for me to sacrifice my future, quit school and work. Dad, if there is really difficulty at home and you can\u2019t afford our tuition fees, even if Sister\u2019s grades are not as good as mine, I will abide by Mom\u2019s wishes. It is also a form of repayment to her for bringing me up. I will go to work.\u201dAt last, Qiao Nan was forced to agree to quit school and work. But when she heard Qiao Nan\u2019s words, Qiao Zijin was furious.What did she mean by even if her grades were not better than Qiao Nan, Qiao Nan was also willing to sacrifice herself?This meant that it was a waste of money to let her study!\u201cDo you not understand my words?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was also angry now. The younger daughter\u2019s grades were obviously much better than the elder daughter, on what basis must she discontinue her studies? \u201cYou really think that joining the workforce early is a good thing? Fine, since Nan Nan is not studying despite her good grades, then there is no need for Zijin to study either. Both will go to work and earn money for you. Since taking up a job now is so promising, how can you forget Zijin? If you want to favor Nan Nan, you have to see if i agree to it.\u201dQiao Dongliang was really furious. Ding had not figured out the bottom of the matter, yet she had come back to talk nonsense and create a scene. The neighbors could almost hear them now.If not for Zijin\u2019s nonsense, why would Old Ding dig up the old matters?!\u201cMom.\u201d Qiao Zijin was frightened.\u201cWhy are you shouting? Character comes before studies. If Qiao Nan was as obedient as Zijin, would I need to be so concerned? Zijin does not mix with bad company and go astray, so I don\u2019t need to worry about her, so she doesn\u2019t need to go to work. Don\u2019t you know it varies from person to person?\u201d Ding Jiayi sided much with Qiao Zijin.Clearly it was unreasonable, yet she said it as though she had some point.\u201cDad, actually when school started, Teacher Chen asked me about something.\u201d Qiao Nan clenched her fists.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cTeacher Chen asked me. Sister\u2019s grades were obviously poor, so how did she get into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China?\u201d\u201cThe High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, isn\u2019t it the Ping Cheng High School?Both daughters\u2019 matters were taken care of by Ding Jiayi, Qiao Dongliang had only begun to interfere recently.He vaguely remembered that the elder daughter\u2019s grades were not good, it did not meet the admission score for The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, but could get into Ping Cheng High School.\u201cWhen did Zijin switch school, how come I did not know, and why?\u201d Qiao Dongliang\u2019s face was as fierce as a tiger as he sensed something amiss. Was The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China a place that you could get in as you wished?\u201cOld Ding, hand me the passbook, I want to see.\u201d As he recalled that Ding Jiayi flashed a strange look when they argued because of the passbook the last time, he suddenly understood.\u201cSee, See\u2026 What is there to see the passbook for?\u201d Ding Jiayi was so scared that she stuttered, and her tone was faint.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He always handed all the money to Ding Jiayi. She was not the type to squander the family fortune. And so their savings had grown bit by bit.Qiao Dongliang entrusted everything under Ding Jiayi\u2019s charge, but that did not mean he was unaware of what was happening.He searched for the key, and went to the room to open the drawer. He took out the entire drawer and saw the passbook lying deep inside.\u201cOld Qiao, what are you doing?\u201d Ding Jiayi had a guilty look on her face. She feared that Qiao Dongliang would find out that there was nothing left in the passbook. At that thought she lunged at him, in a bid to take the passbook from him.Standing at 1.8 meters tall, if Qiao Dongliang did not give in, there was no way Ding Jiayi could have snatched it from him.Qiao Dongliang opened the passbook and had a look at the contents. Boiling with anger he bellowed, \u201cWhere\u2019s all the money?!\u201dQiao Dongliang\u2019s roar could be heard from outside. Qiao Zijin turned a shade whiter, she was scared stiff.She was done for this time, there was no way to keep it under wraps anymore.\u201cQiao Nan, what do you mean by this? That\u2019s our Mom, how could you do this to her!\u201d Qiao Zijin pointed at Qiao Nan and started scolding her.If it had not been for Qiao Nan, father and mother would never quarrel. Father had always listened to mother.If father was to know that the money was spent on her, how would he think of her?\u201cThat\u2019s right, she is my Mom. She spent all the savings on you so as to enroll you in a good high school, but she wanted me to quit school and start working. That\u2019s really what a Mom would do!\u201d Qiao Nan laughed sarcastically.\u201cHow did you know\u2026 you did it on purpose!\u201d Qiao Nan had set this up to bring her mother and her down.\u201cThe best way to hide a misdeed is not to commit it. The teachers at our school all knew your standard. Besides, they are all in the education sector. What do you think went through their mind when they heard that you went to The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China?\u201dQiao Zijin stomped her foot, the teachers at junior high school were such blabbermouths.This was their family matter, it had nothing to do with others, why did they have to mention it in front of Qiao Nan?No wonder no amount of cajoling could get Qiao Nan to quit school and start working. Qiao Nan had known all along that her mother had spent such a huge sum of money on her.\u201cDong Liang, are you at home? Just then, an elder\u2019s voice could be heard coming from outside Qiao\u2019s house.Qiao Nan paused, \u201d Grandpa Lee?\u201dQiao Zijin\u2019s countenance fell. This prominent elder rarely accepted their invitation to visit, why would he come at such an inopportune time today?Qiao Zijin was not worried that Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi would disregard the situation and quarrel in front of Grandpa Lee. It was that her mother had sought Grandpa Lee\u2019s help to pull strings for Qiao Zijin to enroll in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.Her mother was lost for words when her father found out that she had spent all the savings.If her father was to know that mother asked Grandpa Lee for help, he would be mad with anger!Qiao Dongliang\u2019s father passed away at an early age. It was Elder Lee who brought him up. If not for Elder Lee who supported and guided Qiao Dongliang because of his friendship with Qiao Dongliang\u2019s father, it would have been even more difficult for him.In order to have a second child, Qiao Dongliang gave up on the path that Elder Lee paved for him. He could have had a bright future. He had also let his late father down.Ever since then, Qiao Dongliang had felt too ashamed to face Elder Lee.Given his situation now, he could only lead a simple life. There was no way that he could repay the debt of gratitude that he owed Elder Lee.Whenever Qiao Dongliang thought of Elder Lee, he felt ashamed of himself. Yet Ding Jiayi asked Elder Lee to help her to pull strings on the account that her late father-in-law once entrusted to his son under his care.Once Qiao Dongliang knew of this, Ding Jiayi would be in deep trouble. She would not be able to hold her head up high in front of him.Qiao Nan decided to set aside her quarrel with Ding Jiayi for now. Since her father had known about the passbook, he would definitely not allow Qiao Nan to quit school.Qiao Nan ran into their room and said, \u201cDad, let\u2019s stop quarreling, Grandpa Lee is here.\u201d\u201cUncle Lee?\u201d Qiao Dongliang tensed demeanor slightly relaxed. In front of Qiao Nan, Ding Jiayi always looked as if someone had ruffled her feathers. But right now, she seemed to be like a quail who was scared stiff, cowering in fear.It was Ding Jiayi\u2019s who had squandered their savings.Just like Qiao Zijin, when Ding Jiayi heard that Elder Lee was here, she was so frightened that she could not wait to find a hiding place.\u201cI will settle scores with you later on!\u201d Qiao Dongliang was so mad that he did not bother minding his words in front of their younger daughter.To think that Ding Jiayi had kept quiet about it after spending such a huge sum of money. He only found out about it after about a month.How daring was this woman?!Qiao Dongliang patted the younger daughter on her head and without another look at Ding Jiayi, he led her out to welcome Elder Lee.After seeing the passbook, Qiao Dongliang finally realized why his wife insisted that the younger daughter quit school and start working. Poor results? Led astray by the bad guys? All these were lies!She had spent all the savings on the elder daughter, yet she wanted the younger daughter to work in order to cover the loss. His wife was too biased towards his elder daughter.Qiao Zijin saw Qiao Dongliang walked out of the room, but she did not dare to walk up to him. She quickly went into the room to take a look at Ding Jiayi. \u201cMom, it\u2019s really Grandpa Lee who is here. What shall we do? If Dad knows about that matter, he would surely beat me, and made me quit The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.\u201d\u201cNo, he won\u2019t.\u201d Ding Jiayi was just as scared but she was reluctant to admit. \u201cI know Elder Lee\u2019s character. Elder Lee knows how Old Qiao\u2019s temper is, and that I hide the fact that I have been to see him from Old Qiao. He won\u2019t speak of a word about this to your Dad and affect our relationship.\u201dWhen Qiao Dongliang discharged from the army in order to have a second child, though Elder Lee was disappointed, he had never scolded Qiao Dongliang.Ding Jiayi was fearless as she was confident that Elder Lee would not want to affect the couple\u2019s relationship because of such a small matter.And judging from Elder Lee\u2019s temper, if he has no inclination to help, he would reject her up front. But he would not mention this to Qiao Dongliang, regardless of whether it was a success or failure, lest the couple ended up in a quarrel.\u201cUncle Lee, what brings you here? Qiao Dongliang was very agitated when he saw Elder Lee.He was ashamed to face Elder Lee, but he also missed him dearly.\u201cGrandpa Lee.\u201d Qiao Nan who was right besides Qiao Dongliang addressed Elder Lee as well.\u201cGrandpa Lee, have some tea.\u201d Qiao Zijin was more assured by her mother\u2019s words. Without another word, she came out with a cup of tea in her hand, hoping to perform well in front of Elder Lee.Elder Lee knew that Qiao Dongliang had two daughters, and they were not too far apart in age. Elder Lee paused for a moment when he saw the two pretty young ladies. \u201cXiao Qiao, you are really fortunate to have two daughters.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Qiao Dongliang gave a vague smile. He used to think that way as well, but now he was not too sure.\u201cGrandpa Lee, please have some tea. Dad has always wanted to visit you, but felt sorry towards you. We never thought that Grandpa Lee would visit us. Dad, you are the junior, you should take the first step.\u201d Qiao Zijin knew of the situation between the two of them, and was clever with her words, painting a nice picture.Elder Lee looked at Qiao Zijin with satisfaction. \u201cYou are Nan Nan?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was so proud that she was well liked by everyone. She was about to say \u201cYes\u201d but her words were choked up in her throat.Why would Elder Lee mention Qiao Nan as soon as he started to speak?Qiao Nan was always bad with her words, she was not likable like her. Why would Elder Lee have mistaken her as Qiao Nan?Qiao Zijin\u2019s words were stifled in her throat and she ended up letting out a faint sound. Elder Lee took it that she had acknowledged his questions.When he saw that this was the child that he was looking for, he became all the more amiable. \u201cXiao Qiao, you have raised a good daughter. She really looked like the daughter of a soldier, full of righteousness.\u201d\u201cBut Xiao Qiao, you should pay more attention to your children\u2019 health. Nan Nan, are you still in shock from the incident last time? Have you fall ill, and hence your voice sounds weird?\u201dQiao\u2019s family were speechless.Qiao Zijin\u2019s \u201coh\u201d was a slip of tongue. She tried to hold it in, but ended up going out of pitch. She was not admitting to having fallen sick.\u201cUncle Lee, you have the wrong person. This is my elder daughter Qiao Zijin, this is my younger daughter Qiao Nan. Nan Nan, you must have not met Uncle Lee before, come and meet your Grandpa Lee.\u201dQiao Dongliang might not know why Elder Lee was here today, but he had the utmost respect for him.\u201cGrandpa Lee.\u201d Qiao Nan addressed him politely.Qiao Nan was also puzzled as to why Elder Lee would come to visit and to call her name upfront.Of course, Qiao Nan was not angry at him for calling the wrong person. In fact she was happy. Qiao Zijin had made a fool of herself this time.\u201cOh, you are Nan Nan, you are really pretty. Xiao Qiao, you have brought up a good daughter. Nan Nan might be quiet, but she is hardworking. Like us, she has the same down-to-earth attribute and mannerism of a soldier.\u201dElder Lee knew that he had got the wrong person. He gave a smile, not paying much attention to it.Ever since Qiao Dongliang was discharged from the army, he had never been to Elder Lee\u2019s house. Elder Lee knew that this matter had been weighing on Qiao Dongliang\u2019s mind. As for Elder Lee, he was also disappointed in Qiao Dongliang. As a result, they had gradually lost touch.Elder Lee had once carried Qiao Zijin when she was young. But he had never seen Qiao Nan since she was born.The two sisters looked alike, it was no wonder that Elder Lee could not tell them apart.Qiao Nan could not help but smile at Elder Lee\u2019s compliments. She found them familiar. Had he not said similar words when he mistook Qiao Zijin for Qiao Nan?This was the first time that Qiao Nan had seen Elder Lee. He seemed to be a funny person to her.Qiao Dongliang was used to Elder Lee\u2019s style. He smiled and said, \u201cUncle Lee, this younger daughter of mine is really a good daughter. She has always been good in her studies. Not only is she the Vice Class Monitor in class, every year she is awarded the top three model students and outstanding class committee member. It\u2019s just that my wife is too careless to have burnt her certificates by mistake.\u201dAt the mention of Qiao Nan, Qiao Dongliang turned into a boastful parent, pride was evident in his voice.Ever since he discharged from the army, Qiao Dongliang dared not face Elder Lee. His biggest wish was that Elder Lee was still healthy, that his two daughters would be successful and have good prospects.In that way, he could bring his daughters to Elder Lee and tell him proudly, \u201cElder Lee, I did not make the wrong choice back then, I did not let your efforts down.\u201dHe was not successful, but he had nurtured daughters who were even more successful than him!\u201cElder Lee, I am sure you don\u2019t know. Nan Nan is in the third year of junior high school. She did not do well for her Chinese and Mathematics exams at the first day of school. Her Chinese teacher was very angry as she scored close to full marks for her essay but lost some marks in the component that required memorizing. She could have scored 99 points, but had 85 points instead. But luckily Nan Nan scored full marks for her English. She was the only one who scored full marks in her school.\u201dAfter finding out that Qiao Nan was not only the Vice Class Monitor, but she also received awards for her good performance every year, Qiao Dongliang reflected on himself and began to pay more attention to her studies.This Wednesday Qiao Dongliang applied for an hour off from his workplace. He went to Qiao Nan\u2019s school and spoke with the teachers who taught the main subjects, asking about her studies.If he did not ask, he would not have known. After the session, he could not help but feel proud of his daughter.Every teacher who taught the younger daughter were full of praise for her.Even though it angered and pained Teacher Lee to talk about the younger daughter\u2019s Chinese results, he could tell that it was because Teacher Lee wanted Qiao Nan to do well.Qiao Dongliang could tell from the criticisms and praises that Teacher Lee meant that if only Qiao Nan had done her revision, she would have scored at least 99 points for her Chinese exam this time.99 points, and that was for Chinese. Qiao Dongliang never imagined that this result would be attainable.At least for the elder daughter, it was considered a good result to score 89 points for her junior high Chinese exams.Qiao Dongliang was burning with embarrassment at the teacher\u2019s underlying meaning. But he could not blame the younger daughter for telling the teacher that her mother sold the textbooks.After all, what his wife did had really affected the younger daughter\u2019s results. But one should not wash dirty linen in public. It was a total mess!Qiao Nan has the worst results this time. But it was the best that she could do. It made Qiao Dongliang hold his head up high in front of Elder Lee.\u201cOh, really?\u201d Elder Lee was somewhat surprised. He knew Qiao Dongliang well. He would not lie.Elder Lee already had grandchildren and they were still in school. So he was aware that in junior high school, it was difficult to get 99 points or even 100 points for exams. 95 points would already be seen as an excellent score.As expected she was the industrious type. Elder Lee looked at Qiao Nan with affection, as if she was his granddaughter.Elder Lee was getting on in years. His only wish was that his grandchildren would study hard and be successful.So naturally, he had an affection for hardworking children like Qiao Nan. Besides, it was due to Qiao Nan\u2019s good upbringing and character that he had visited Qiao\u2019s house today.\u201cXiao Qiao, do you know why I visited your house today?\u201dQiao Dongliang paused for a moment and said, \u201cIs anything the matter, Uncle Lee?\u201d\u201cI came on behalf of Zhu family to thank you and your family.\u201d\u201cZhu family, Uncle Zhu\u2019s family?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was not close to Zhu family. Zhu family were in-laws with Uncle Lee. The son of Zhu family married Uncle Lee\u2019s daughter.Zhu family and Lee family all stayed at the quad. They were well-matched in terms of social status. Zhu family was fairly well-to-do.\u201cYes, it\u2019s your Uncle Zhu\u2019s family.\u201d Uncle Lee became agitated. He took a few moments to calm down before he continued, \u201cYou must have heard about what happened to my daughter.\u201d\u201cElder Lee, it has been years. You must take care of yourself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He doted very much on the only daughter.Uncle Lee wanted his daughter to find someone she loved and lead a happy life. He had no thoughts of establishing connections through her marriage.But Lee Shu was lucky. It was by coincidence that she fell in love with the son of the Zhu family. Their relationship was going smoothly and they tied the knot in around a year\u2019s time and she was pregnant in less than three months\u2019 time.But what was heartbreaking was that Lee Shu did not live to see the child. When she went into the labor, everything went smoothly. She had the baby through natural delivery.But no-one would have expected that after giving birth, she would have a hemorrhage.Lee Shu\u2019s blood type was quite common, but it just so happened that the blood bank ran out of that particular blood type on that day.Her mother stayed behind to take care of the daughter. But her blood type did not match and so she could not donate her blood to her.When Elder Lee and his three sons arrived, they were not in time to donate their blood to Lee Shu.And so, only a few hours after she brought the baby into this world, Lee Shu did not even get to take a glimpse of her child and she had passed away.Lee Shu\u2019s death came as a blow to Lee family and Zhu family. Elder Lee even forbade everyone to speak of his pitiful daughter in front of him.\u201cOh.\u201d Elder Lee let out a long sigh. \u201cI am old, I am no longer as clear minded as before. Now I always make mistakes and do silly things.\u201dQiao Dongliang could not help but blush in embarrassment when he heard Elder Lee\u2019s words. He was not as old as Elder Lee. Yet he had done quite a lot of stupid things, in particular, matters regarding his younger daughter. Forget it, he did not want to talk about them, he would only be more frustrated about it.\u201cXiao Shu was gone. No matter how heartbroken we are, Xiao Shu will never come back. Xiao Shu left us with the only son Bao Guo. She risked her life to have him. If he is gone, I\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be able to face Xiao Shu when I died.\u201dElder Lee\u2019s eyes turned red.\u201cHas anything happened to Baoguo?\u201d Qiao Dongliang realized something was wrong. \u201cI remembered Baoguo is a year older than Nan Nan. He should be in secondary three now?\u201d\u201cYes, he is in secondary three now. He is in the same school as Nan Nan.\u201d\u201cHe is classmates with Nan Nan. They are all in the same class.\u201d Qiao Dongliang was surprised. He never thought that the maternal grandchild of Uncle Lee would be in the same class as his younger daughter. \u201cNan Nan, has something happened to your classmate?\u201d\u201cZhu Baoguo, my classmate?\u201d Qiao Nan was confused. Half a month had passed since school reopened. But she had no idea she had a classmate by the name of Zhu Baoguo.Qiao Nan twitched her lips and did not know what to say. \u201cAmong all my classmates, there isn\u2019t someone by the name of Zhu Baoguo. But I haven\u2019t seen my desk mate since school reopened.\u201dShe connected the dots and realized that her desk mate was the maternal grandchild of Elder Lee.But what did this have to do with her. Before coming to their house, Elder Lee had no idea how she had fared in her exams. There was no way that he was here to ask that she coached his grandson in his studies.\u201cIt\u2019s fate. It\u2019s all fate.\u201dElder Lee was shocked as well. He never thought that his grandson would be \u201crelated\u201d to Qiao Nan in so many ways. \u201cNan Nan, on behalf of Lee family and Zhu family, I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving our Baoguo.\u201dThe situation was different for Lee family, Elder Lee had three sons and two grandchildren.But Zhu family only had one son, Zhu Chengqi. After Lee Shu passed away, Zhu Chengqi never remarried. He left his family and stayed in the army all day long.Zhu Baoguo was the only grandson of the Zhu family.If anything happened to Zhu Baoguo, unless Zhu Chengqi was willing to remarry, there would be no-one to continue Zhu\u2019s family line.If something happened to Zhu Baoguo, Zhu family would be devastated!\u201cSave his life?\u201d Ding Jiayi was confused.It was rare that Elder Lee visited them, and Zhu family was involved as well. Ding Jiayi was dying to have connections with these two prominent families, but she had never had the chance.Why would these two families have connections to their family? Why would Elder Lee come all the way to Qiao\u2019s house to thank them?\u201cNan Nan, do you want to tell them what happened or should I tell them? But I guess it\u2019s better that you tell them, I might not have all the details.\u201d\u201cElder Lee, I will do it.\u201d Qiao Nan was still confused. After pausing to think for a few moments, she asked, \u201cIs Zhu Baoguo the person who was beaten up this Monday?\u201dAfter all, in her two lifetimes he was the only person that she had saved.\u201cYou are really a good child.\u201d Elder Lee beamed and nodded.Elder Lee was not surprised that Qiao Nan did not know Zhu Baoguo. His only grandson had been dwindling his days away. He knew that his grandson never went to school.Whenever he was reminded of how outstanding his daughter was, and yet her son was such a good-for-nothing, he would feel sorry for his daughter and did not wish to see his grandson.\u201cNan Nan, you mean you have saved someone\u2019s life before?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was shocked.\u201cDad, do you remember what happened just now?\u201d Qiao Nan shot a glance at Qiao Zijin, hinting at the incident minutes ago where Qiao Zijin tried to smear her reputation.\u201cIt has something to do with this?\u201d Qiao Dongliang understood at once.\u201cI usually stick to my daily routine, there\u2019s no way to be in touch with those people. It was on this Monday after I was done with my class duty, I saw a person surrounded by a bunch of gangsters and they were throwing punches at him. He fell flat on the ground from the beating. I went looking for the police. The police arrived and the gangsters ran off. The police then took the injured person to the hospital.\u201dSince then, she never meddled with these fights anymore.But she never thought that she had unwittingly saved someone so close to her.\u201cWhy, is there something else?\u201d Elder Lee noticed that something was amiss from Qiao Nan\u2019s tone and asked her to explain further.\u201cNothing much, it\u2019s just a small misunderstanding.\u201d With that, Qiao Dongliang glared at Qiao Zijin secretly.The truth was finally out. Nan Nan had no contact with those gangsters and was not led astray by them. In fact, Nan Nan had saved Zhu family\u2019s son \u2013 Elder Lee\u2019s biological maternal grandson!\u201cMisunderstanding?\u201d Elder Lee did not probe further at Qiao Dongliang\u2019s words. Since if there was anything wrong, he would be able to to find out himself. \u201cXiao Qiao, all thanks to your Nan Nan, if not, I have no idea what would happened to my grandson.\u201d\u201cElder Lee, please do not stand on ceremony with us.\u201d Qiao Dongliang who was unaware of the real situation thought that Elder Lee was being too polite. His younger daughter merely asked for help from others.They were all a bunch of teenagers. It was common to be engaged in small fights.\u201cNo, they were my heartfelt words. Do you know why I only waited till today to visit when it was on Monday that Nan Nan saved Baoguo?\u201d Elder Lee\u2019s eyes turned teary at the mention of the danger his grandson faced. \u201cThose people were really ruthless. Two of Baoguo\u2019s rib bones were broken. One rib bone almost pierced his lung. If not for Nan Nan, Baoguo might be beaten to death by them. Fortunately he was sent to the hospital in time, otherwise he might die or become invalid.\u201dEveryone was stunned when they heard of Zhu Baoguo\u2019s condition. Those people were too ruthless!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Two of the rib bones were broken, one rib bone almost pierced the lung.So in her previous lifetime, that person who was from the same quad, who became invalid from all those beatings, and died from the extreme pain as no-one went to his help, was actually Zhu Baoguo?In her previous lifetime, Qiao Nan had already quit school and started working at this time. it was only when she came back then that she heard from others that someone from the quad was beaten to death.Even though the injured person was still alive, knowing that they had gotten themselves into trouble, those gangsters just ran off without him.A day has gone by the time he was discovered. His corpse had turned cold, and there was no chance of saving him.Because of this, Ding Jiayi started sending Qiao Zijin to school from then onwards.Qiao Nan had just reached home for barely a day before Ding Jiayi took all her pay and sent her off to work again. She did not even have time to ask about this matter in detail.So after her rebirth, in this lifetime Qiao Nan had no memory of this incident. She did not know that the person who had died in her previous lifetime was actually Elder Lee\u2019s maternal grandson.\u201cBaoguo sustained serious injuries and had just passed the critical stage. He had woken up but is still in recovery. He is still young, he should be able to regain his health by taking more tonics and healthy food.\u201dIn the beginning, Zhu family and Lee family were devastated and worried when they knew of Zhu Baoguo\u2019s injuries.They did not have the time and the mood to find out who saved Zhu Baoguo\u2019s life.It was only yesterday that Zhu Baoguo woke up and was able to speak. The two families felt slightly at ease. It was then did they remembered that they should thank the person who saved his life.Zhu family and Lee family found the two police officers who sent Zhu Baoguo to the hospital. They had wanted to thank them for saving Zhu Baoguo\u2019s life.But like the soldiers, the police officers were honest and upright. They told the two families that it was a young lady from the quad who found Zhu Baoguo and asked them for their help to save Zhu Baoguo.So the person that the two families had to be grateful for was in fact this young lady.Zhu family and Lee family asked around and finally found out that the person who saved Zhu Baoguo was none other than Qiao Nan, Qiao Dongliang\u2019s daughter.Elder Lee felt most comforted at this news.Elder Lee had always felt sorry regarding Qiao Dongliang\u2019s discharge from the army. Nobody would have known that it was Qiao Dongliang\u2019s younger daughter who ended up saving his only grandson.\u201cXiao Qiao, don\u2019t blame Uncle Lee for taking such a long time to visit. Your daughter Nan Nan has saved Baoguo, Lee family and Zhu family owed your family a big favor,\u201d Elder Lee said earnestly.Back then he helped and guided Qiao Dongliang purely on account of his friendship with his father. But it was different now. Qiao Nan saved Zhu Baoguo\u2019s life. He owed Qiao\u2019s family a huge debt of gratitude.From now on, Qiao Dongliang no longer owed Lee family anything. Rather, as Elder Lee said, it was Lee family and Zhu family who owed Qiao family.\u201cUncle Lee, we are one big family. If it wasn\u2019t for you I wouldn\u2019t be what I am today. Nan Nan just did what she had to do. Regardless of whether its Baoguo or not, when faced with such situation, Nan Nan would not turn a blind eye to it. Uncle Lee, you do not have to worry about it.\u201dQiao Dongliang stood straight and looked at Qiao Nan with pride and joy.\u201cOkay.\u201d Elder Lee smiled. Xiao Qiao was never a person to request that someone return the favors. \u201cXiao Qiao, you have taught your daughter well. It was all worth it!\u201dQiao Dongliang discharged from the army due to Qiao Nan. Elder Lee could not get over it for a long time. But he understood now and was fully supportive of his decisions.If Qiao Dongliang did not have a second child and had still served in the army, no matter how successful he was, there would have been no-one to save his grandson.Elder Lee was just like everyone, hoping for the best for his family. He would naturally prefer the current situation now.\u201cUncle Lee, I find it all worthwhile as well.\u201d Qiao Dongliang said firmly.Qiao Zijin was all flustered. Elder Lee was all praises for Qiao Nan, and from the way he looked at Qiao Nan, it was as if she was his real granddaughter.Qiao Nan merely asked for help. It was not her who took Zhu Baoguo to the hospital. She did not deserve such credit.Qiao Zijin kept her thoughts to herself. She dared not speak of it in front of everyone else. With a look of worry on her face, Qiao Zijin asked, \u201cGrandpa Lee, how is Brother Baoguo now?\u201d\u201cWe think it would be better for him to rest in the hospital for another half a month. He needs at least three months for the injuries to the bones and tendons to recover. Right now my biggest worry is Baoguo\u2019s studies.\u201d Elder Lee was worried but at the same time angry at his grandson.After the near death experience, Elder Lee knew that he had to face up to his pain inside and to take the matter of Zhu Baoguo seriously.But Zhu Baoguo did not put his effort into studying. He did not do well in the first two years of junior high school.If he had not played truant and messed with those gangsters, he would not have suffered such injuries.By the time he was discharged from the hospital, a quarter of the four-month long semester would have passed. He could not just watch on helplessly while his grandson wasted his time away in junior high school, be content with a junior high certificate and joined society, uneducated and without a proper degree.When his daughter was still around, she was very intelligent and quick to pick up new knowledge. She always did very well in her studies.Why would such an outstanding daughter give birth to a grandson who was such a good for nothing?At the thought of that, Elder Lee gathered that it must be due to Zhu family. After all, Lee family had good genes.Qiao Zijin had a bright idea and said, \u201cGrandpa Lee, I just graduated from junior high school. Why don\u2019t I coach Baoguo in his studies during my free time?\u201dLee family and Zhu family were prominent and established families. If she was on friendly terms with Zhu Baoguo, Lee family and Zhu family would help her along, there was no need for her to worry about her future.It would only take them a mere lift of the finger to arrange a good job for her. She did not need to have good results in order to have a bright future. This was only meant for people who came from poor background and who had no connections with the prominent people.If she had the connections, even if she was illiterate, she would still have a good job.\u201cI am of similar age to Baoguo, we would definitely get along.\u201dQiao Nan stared at Qiao Zijin incredulously. Where did her confidence come from? Wasn\u2019t she worried that she might be doing Baoguo more harm than good?Ding Jiayi found nothing wrong with Qiao Zijin\u2019s words. She thought it was a good idea. \u201cUncle Lee, our daughter Zijin is very patient and good with children. Baoguo would love it to have an elder sister to take care of him. After all Zijin is in high school now, she would find it easy to teach junior high syllabus.\u201dElder Lee looked at Ding Jiayi and smiled at Qiao Dongliang, Xiao Qiao, this is a good idea, but it\u2019s just that I thought Nan Nan is in the same class as Baoguo. Furthermore they are deskmates. Can we ask Nan Nan to help Baoguo instead?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayElder Lee might not be able to tell Qiao Zijin and Qiao Nan apart, after all, he had not watched them grow up.But he still could tell the difference from the names.He remembered two months ago Ding Jiayi asked him for a favor. It seemed to concern Qiao Zijin. Elder Lee shook his head while smiling. It was not difficult for Lee family and Zhu family to find someone to coach Baoguo in his studies. They had no problem at all hiring an accomplished teacher for him.But it was just that Baoguo was very stubborn. Even if there were good teachers to teach him, he might not be willing to learn.Since Qiao Nan was desk mates with Baoguo, she could check on him and look after him while they were in school. Besides, how could Qiao Zijin\u2019s results be comparable to Qiao Nan\u2019s results?No matter what, Qiao Nan was the best candidate.\u201cOf course, that\u2019s not a problem at all.\u201d Qiao Dongliang patted his thigh and agreed readily. \u201cIt just so happens that Nan Nan has been revising her secondary one and two knowledge. She would have no trouble coaching Baoguo. The two of them can even supervise each other and help each other along the way.\u201dIt was such a rare opportunity for Qiao Dongliang. Not only could he mend his relationship with Elder Lee, he could also repay his debt of gratitude.\u201cThen it\u2019s settled. Xiao Qiao, if any problem arises in the future, you can still come to me for help. If it is beyond my limits, Zhu family will also try to come up with a way to help.\u201d Elder Lee patted Qiao Dongliang on his shoulders.Actually, the Zhu family should be the ones to visit Qiao family.There were two reasons why Elder Lee came instead. Firstly, Elder Lee was acquaintances with Qiao family. Besides, Elder Lee was the one who guided Qiao Dongliang.Secondly, the Zhu family was still in shock. They had been keeping vigil by Zhu Baoguo\u2019s side. Hence they would have to trouble Elder Lee to make the trip.Qiao Dongliang had a puzzled look on his face. What did Uncle Lee mean when he said that he could still go to Elder Lee if he ran into troubles? He had never asked for his help in the past.Qiao Dongliang was not the ungrateful sort. He was thankful for Elder Lee\u2019s guidance and mentoring. He did not dream of asking favors from him. He always obeyed Elder Lee\u2019s words. He could not possibly have asked him for help.\u201cAlright, it\u2019s late, I better head back.\u201d Looking at Qiao Dongliang\u2019s puzzled look, Elder had an \u201cas expected\u201d look on his face.Just as he expected, Xiao Qiao was so honest, there was no way that he could have asked him to do such a thing.Qiao Dongliang did not understand. But Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin knew it instantly.Ding Jiayi remembered that Qiao Dongliang had just blown his top over the passbook. If he was to know that not only had she spent all the savings on the elder daughter, she had also sought Elder Lee\u2019s help to get Qiao Zijin into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, he would be furious. Ding Jiayi shivered in fright at the thought of that.Fortunately Elder Lee did not mention anything about helping Qiao Zijin to enrol in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. Ding Jiayi finally breathed a sigh of relief when he indicated that he was leaving.\u201cUncle Lee, let me take you out.\u201d Qiao Dongliang stood up and walked Elder Lee to the door before returning to the house. \u201cDing, what did Uncle Lee mean when he said that we could still ask him for help in future?\u201dDing Jiayi raised her voice. \u201cWhat\u2026 What other meaning other than the literal meaning? Uncle\u2026 Uncle Lee has forgiven us. He wants both of our families to keep in touch. We can also seek his help in the future. Nan Nan has saved his only grandson, he would definitely be thankful towards us.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Qiao Dongliang arched his eyebrows in suspicion. He still found it weird.\u201cIf not, what could be the case?\u201d Not wanting Qiao Dongliang to probe further, Ding Jiayi quickly changed the topic. \u201cOld Qiao, is Qiao Nan really going to coach Zhu Baoguo? She is still in junior high school. You saw her results this time round. All her teachers said that she needs to work on her basic knowledge. If she was to tutor Zhu Baoguo, will she still have time for revision? Even if it was to repay Uncle Lee, you shouldn\u2019t ask her to give up on her revision just to help Uncle Lee\u2019s grandson.\u201dQiao Zijin\u2019s eyes brightened at her mother\u2019s words.\u201cWhat do you want then?\u201d Qiao Dongliang dropped his voice, anger in his eyes.Ding Jiayi was way too happy to notice that. \u201cI think the suggestion just now was pretty good. Zijin can do the coaching!\u201dIt was such a good opportunity. How could she wasted such a chance on Qiao Nan? Zijin would naturally be the best choice!If Zijin was on close terms with Zhu Baoguo and he acknowledged her as his sister, Zijin did not need to worry about her future anymore!As expected, her beloved daughter had lady luck smiling on her!\u201cNan Nan scored full marks for her English and she was not capable of teaching Zhu Baoguo. Yet Zijin who paid money to get into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China could teach Zhu Baoguo?\u201d Qiao Dongliang snorted. He did not mean to look down on his elder daughter. Ding Jiayi had let her imagination run wild. \u201cYou heard Uncle Lee\u2019s words just now, even if Zijin is willing to teach, Uncle Lee would not allow it. That\u2019s it, stop messing around. You should consider Zijin\u2019s feelings as well.\u201dQiao Dongliang was reminded of Elder Lee\u2019s immediate rejection of Qiao Zijin\u2019s suggestion just now. He shook his head and said, \u201cZijin, don\u2019t follow after your Mom.\u201dQiao Dongliang thought to himself, if he was his elder daughter, upon hearing what Uncle Lee said, he would be so ashamed of himself.He had to admit, Qiao Zijin truly followed after him.When Uncle Lee said that he would like Qiao Nan to coach his grandson instead, he saw Qiao Zijin\u2019s face turn red with embarrassment.But the benefits that came with tutoring Zhu Baoguo were too good to be missed. Even if she had been rejected once by Uncle Lee, Qiao Zijin still hoped that she would be able to take on this tutoring work, and Qiao Nan would not stand to gain at all.On account of the fact that she saved Zhu Baoguo\u2019s life, the Lee family and Zhu family would definitely help Qiao Nan if she needed help in future.They were siblings, this time she should give up the chance for her. Qiao Nan should not be the one to have the upper hand at all times.\u201cNan Nan, it was such a serious matter. You should have told us earlier and we would not have had the misunderstanding. If you had told us earlier, I would not have believed the rumors.\u201d Qiao Zijin said cynically.Qiao Nan laughed.Let Qiao Zijin know everything beforehand?If she told her beforehand, Qiao Zijin might have pretended to be her and taken all the credit.Besides, as she had said, she did not know the identity of the person she saved.\u201cDad, now that we no longer have any savings, why not?\u201d Qiao Nan walked up to Qiao Dongliang\u2019s side and asked worriedly.Qiao Nan did not want to create trouble. But Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin kept on messing with her. In this lifetime Qiao Nan was no longer the good-tempered girl that she used to be.\u201cNo need!\u201d Qiao Dongliang grew mad at the mention of that. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t enough money at home, it would not be your turn to earn money. Old Ding, our two daughters are in school now. They rarely spend time at home. From tomorrow onwards, you should look for a job. Regardless of how much you earn, you should make a monthly contribution as well.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 You are asking me to work at such an age?\u201d Ding Jiayi was stunned.\u201cSuch an age? How old are you? I am much older than you and I am still working. Unless you are able to cover the loss, you have to find a job.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re a jinx, there\u2019s no peace at home everyday because of you, did I somehow earn this in my previous life?\u201dQiao Dongliang had insisted to see the passbook and found out about the matter because of Qiao Nan\u2019s words. At the thought of this, Ding Jiayi vented all her frustration on Qiao Nan.\u201cNan Nan, this time you are really too much, this is our biological Mom, how can you harm her like that?\u201d Qiao Zijin was still jealous that Qiao Nan had the opportunity to get close to Zhu Baoguo and did her utmost to malign Qiao Nan.\u201cI am not sure if she is my biological mother, but I am certain that she is yours. Your grades are bad, she spent all the savings at home to let you continue your studies. My grades are never bad, yet she insisted that I quit school and work. Who is the one being owed to in the previous life, who is the one paying the debts?\u201dQiao Nan could not tolerate this any further. She questioned Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin.Even if she really owed Ding Jiayi, she had repaid her enough in her previous life. She was eventually driven to the grave by her own mother \u2013 she had even given her life to Ding Jiayi.\u201cMom, you often say that I\u2019m not good. Let me ask you, Sister is older than me, I do all the household chores at home, what does Sister do? After all, I am the servant waiting on others while Sister is the rich family\u2019s daughter, so you picked me up from the roads, right? Though I didn\u2019t say a word, it doesn\u2019t mean that I do not know. You are biased towards Sister and spent all the money on her, yet you wanted to cajole me to work so that I can help you to mend this hole. Mom, in doing this, don\u2019t you feel guilty?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 \u201d Ding Jiayi was filled with guilt. \u201cYou, what nonsense are you talking about? I, I asked you to work, it\u2019s really for your own good. Even if you do well in your studies, you may not be successful or be able to earn money in future.\u201d\u201cDoing well in school may not give you a successful future, so we might as well join the workforce earlier. Mom, then with Sister\u2019s average grades that are neither here nor there, aren\u2019t you afraid that she will not be able to earn any money in future. Moreover, you dumped such a huge sum of money just to allow her to continue with these useless studies. Mom, I\u2019m fifteen, not five, do you think I believe what you said?\u201dQiao Nan was furious yet amused by Ding Jiayi\u2019s words. Ding Jiayi actually said them \u2013 she was treating her like a three-year-old kid.\u201cBelieve? Do I care if you believe me?\u201d With Qiao Nan\u2019s repeated pressurizing, Ding Jiayi was in a rage and simply spoke from her heart, \u201cLet me tell you, you owe our family. If not for you, your Dad would still be in the army, holding the position of a Battalion Commander. I didn\u2019t even mention myself; before I gave birth to you, I had a cradle-to-grave job. All these \u2013 aren\u2019t they all your fault? Without you, would our Qiao family have turned out like this? This is all because of you \u2013 a jinx. It is because of you that I am unable to lift my head up before others. Tell me, you caused so much harm, you\u2019re useless and only know how to waste the family\u2019s money. If I don\u2019t favor your Sister, then should I favor a jinx like you?\u201dQiao Nan was antagonized and she laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t make it sound so nice. Did I beg you to give birth to a second child? Did you willingly give up all that you mentioned earlier for the sake of me \u2013 your daughter? It is for your son. You can only blame your disappointing womb. After you gave up everything that you were proud of, in the end, you still gave birth to a money-losing daughter. Right?\u201dDing Jiayi not only often called Qiao Nan wretched girl, but also money-losing daughter.\u201cMom, don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know anything. When you pestered Dad to have a second child and persuaded him to leave the army, you said you were willing to do so for the sake of your son. You gave up everything for a son but finally gave birth to me \u2013 can you blame me for this? I can\u2019t neither choose my gender nor my Mom \u2013 it\u2019s the same reasoning!\u201dIf there was a choice, she would not wish to be Ding Jiayi\u2019s daughter, especially the younger daughter.\u201cYou\u2026 How can you say that?\u201d Ding Jiayi raised her hand and slapped Qiao Nan hard, until blood was dripping from the corner of Qiao Nan\u2019s mouth.Ding Jiayi was always thinking how good things would have been if only she had not given birth to Qiao Nan.However, when she heard that the daughter whom she disliked also felt the same way, Ding Jiayi was furious and humiliated.\u201cOld Ding, are you mad?\u201d Qiao Dongliang, who was feeling sullen in the bedroom, heard the argument between Ding Jiayi and Qiao Nan getting worse, and he came out of the room. The first thing that he saw was Ding Jiayi slapping Qiao Nan.Qiao Dongliang pulled Qiao Nan to his side. \u201cDidn\u2019t you give birth to Qiao Nan, how can you beat your own daughter like that?\u201d\u201cDid you not hear what she said earlier, she said I do not treat her as my daughter, does she treat me as her Mom? She doesn\u2019t want me to be her Mom!\u201d Ding Jiayi yelled, her neck straight.\u201cYou have to reflect on your behavior first. Nan Nan was not wrong in what she just said. Me leaving the army and your resignation \u2013 can we blame her for that? Blame yourself, blame me! But Nan Nan, what you just said was also too much. No matter what, she is your mother. How can you say such things to hurt your Mom? Your Mom has a strong temper, her words are as sharp as a knife, but she actually loves and dotes on you.\u201dAfter Qiao Dongliang disciplined Ding Jiayi, he also reprimanded Qiao Nan. Both were biological mother and daughter but they argued as if they were enemies.\u201cDotes on me, Dad, is there a mother that will dote on me so much?\u201d Qiao Nan laughed. Earlier, her Dad was angry, but he still harbored hopes of harmony and prosperity in the family.In this lifetime, she knew how to fight for herself and was not willing to give in. But her dad always wanted to to be the good guy, and play the middleman to the situation.However, between her and her mother, there was an inseparable knot in their hearts. It was no longer possible for them to get along with each other for a single day in this entire lifetime.\u201cDad, I had a fever before school started, do you know what I heard when I was lying on the bed in the bedroom? I heard Mom telling Sister that I have a wretched life, cheap and tough, I won\u2019t die with a fever. As long as I was delayed in enrolling for school, they would cajole me into finding a job. Dad, you should know by now why Mom insisted that I find a job. If I work and earn money, will Mom allow me to save a cent? It is not enough to dump all the family savings on my sister, she still wants me to work and support my sister\u2019s studies? Both are her daughters, why, is this how she dotes on me?\u201dQiao Nan cried as she lamented. Her crying was more miserable than Ding Jiayi. \u201cThat day, my fever was so bad that I could not even get up. But my mother was so good, she bought a watermelon, Sister was hugging half of the watermelon and eating it with a spoon, all by herself. Sure, my mother really doted on me! I was sick and lying in bed, she threw away the medicine and refused to let me take it. I was so thirsty that I could not talk but there was no-one at home that would gave me a single mouthful of water. Dad, can you tell me why Mom dotes on me so much. Such a doting Mom, who dares to want, who has the life to do so?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could not open his mouth to defend Ding Jiayi.The matter regarding Qiao Nan\u2019s fever happened not more than two months ago.Qiao Dongliang could still remember how Qiao Nan retrieved the fever medicine, that had not expired, from the waste bin.That day, his wife insisted that she had given the younger daughter the fever medicine. But thereafter, she said the medicine was gone, expired and thrown away.Did his wife really give the younger daughter the fever medicine?Did they really finish the fever medicine?Or had the fever medicine expired?No, not at all.The more his wife tried to cover up, the matter regarding the passbook \u2013 the wife insisted that the younger daughter quit school to work. Was she really doing this for the sake of the younger daughter or did she have an ulterior motive, would Qiao Dongliang not know?The more Qiao Nan said, the more awkward Qiao Dongliang\u2019s face looked. He breathed and snorted heavily.\u201cDad, there is one matter that I have been keeping from you. I thought that was my hallucination, I too hoped that I was too sick to remember it correctly. The night that I was having fever, wasn\u2019t it raining heavily? I remembered that I had clearly closed the windows to prevent the rain from coming into the room, I clearly recalled that I was covered with my blanket when I slept. In the middle of the night, I vaguely felt that someone entered my room and walked to the windows. When I awoke in the morning, I had a fever, half the blanket was not only at the end of the bed, but also on the floor. Even the windows were opened. Dad, Mom really dotes on me!\u201dQiao Dongliang was shaken and his whole body shivered. He looked at his younger daughter with disbelief. \u201cNan Nan, you, is what you said all true?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking nonsense!\u201d Ding Jiayi\u2019s eyes were red, and her face was even redder. She was angered by Qiao Nan. \u201cYou\u2019re a heartless thing, when did I enter your room and open your windows?\u201dApparently after she woke up that day, Zijin told her that Qiao Nan\u2019s condition did not seem right \u2013 her face was flushed and she looked uncomfortable. She only knew that Qiao Nan was having a fever after she entered Qiao Nan\u2019s room and touched her forehead.\u201cYou, how can you malign me, I, I, I am your real mother!\u201d\u201cOld Qiao, we lived in the same room, you think about it. Did I wake up in the middle of the night that day?\u201d Ding Jiayi was afraid that Qiao Dongliang would believe Qiao Nan\u2019s \u201clies\u201d. She quickly asked Qiao Dongliang to search his memory.This had happened almost two months ago. Qiao Dongliang could not remember so clearly.Qiao Dongliang was in the army and a light sleeper. Usually, when Ding Jiayi woke at night to use the restroom or do other things, Qiao Dongliang would certainly be aware. But this happened too long ago, so Qiao Dongliang did not have much recollection.As Qiao Dongliang looked like he was wracking his brains to recollect this, Ding Jiayi nearly fainted with anger. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it, I didn\u2019t do it. Your health is poor but you think that I opened the windows at night. That room of yours, am I happy to go in? Furthermore, I have to wake up in the middle of the night to do so? If I had really planned for this, I would not have left only half a tablet of fever medicine at home \u2013 to let you find it?\u201dDing Jiayi\u2019s inappropriate words made everyone embarrassed and speechless. Qiao Dongliang did not know how to react.The wife\u2019s words had indirectly admitted that she had intentionally discarded the medicine, and the purpose was to let the younger daughter recover slowly so that she would miss the enrollment deadline.Regardless of whether the window was opened by his wife, the plot of quitting school and working was certainly her wife\u2019s doing.She had spent all the family savings for the elder daughter, yet she wanted the younger one to make up for this wrongdoing.Facing this, Qiao Dongliang was too ashamed to tell Qiao Nan that Ding Jiayi, her mother, could not possibly not love her.As for what Qiao Nan had said, this type of maternal love \u2013 who dares to want it?\u201cMom, Mom, forget it. Didn\u2019t Nan Nan say, she probably remembered wrongly. Perhaps Nan Nan was already feverish at that time and mistook her dreams for real. No matter what, Nan Nan was sick at that time. You you, you try to put yourself in her shoes.\u201d Qiao Zijin, who saw the anger of Ding Jiayi rising, held on to Ding Jiayi and did not want her to continue arguing with Qiao Nan.When Qiao Zijin said this, Qiao Nan opened her eyes and stared at Qiao Zijin.At this time, Qiao Zijin appeared to be sincere in persuading Ding Jiayi to stop making trouble \u2013 was that not strange?Qiao Zijin was never kind to her.After being pushed to the edge by Qiao Nan, Qiao Zijin guiltily turned sideways and hid behind Ding Jiayi.After which Qiao Zijin realized that the action would betray her. Lifting her waist, she stood out with a stiff face. \u201cNan Nan, why are you looking at me like this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Qiao Nan laughed, them she took a long breath.Till now, she had actually thought too lightly of Qiao Zijin.In the previous life, after Qiao Zijin committed adultery, she blamed her divorce entirely on Qiao Nan. When she knew she had uremia and needed a kidney, she wanted Qiao Nan\u2019s.Such a heartless woman, she had actually revealed her fox\u2019s tail at this time.That night, it was true that someone had entered her room. Not only had the person opened her windows, but they had also pulled away her blanket.However, that someone was not Ding Jiayi, it was Qiao Zijin!\u201cDad, I can only say that I am certain that someone came into my room that night. If all of you think that I am dreaming, then continue to do so. Anyway, I didn\u2019t even have water to drink when I was feverish. My mother and sister were happily eating watermelon. They even treated fever medicine as expired ones by discarding them, insisting that I had eaten them. With this, you said my Mom loves me, it\u2019s not surprising that I have that kind of dreams.\u201dQiao Nan let out a huge sigh, she was badly shaken.Having said this, Qiao Nan did not wish to say anything else. She returned silently to her bedroom.The weekend that students always looked forward to had just begun, but Qiao Nan felt that she could not live through it.Was she really a child of the Qiao family?How she wished she could choose not to be!Qiao Nan words were more formidable than 100 slaps, it stunned the rest of the three people on the spot simultaneously and set them thinking.\u201cFight, fight, fight. Argue from day till night. Are you happy now, Nan Nan has become like that, is your heart at ease? I told Nan Nan that you love her, when I think of it now, I feel my face flushed with embarrassment. You have wasted all our family savings and tarnished the relationship with Nan Nan, are you satisfied now? I have said, from now onwards, you take care of Zijin\u2019s matters and I\u2019ll take care of Nan Nan\u2019s. If you dare to treat Nan Nan like this again, always shouting and threatening her to find a job to tidy up your mess, let me tell you, we won\u2019t have a life anymore!\u201dAfter numerous shocks and provocations, Qiao Dongliang could not smile even when he looked at Qiao Zijin who had been quite obedient and sensible all this while.He knew. Was the elder daughter not the source of all these matters?\u201cZijin, let me ask you. Was it yours and Mom\u2019s idea to study in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China?\u201dQiao Zijin did not expect that she would leave such a big loophole. That night, before she opened the windows, she had clearly called Nan Nan a few times and even pushed Nan Nan\u2019s shoulders to ensure that Nan Nan was sleeping like a log. She then daringly opened the windows and removed the blanket from Qiao Nan\u2019s body.She had not expected that Qiao Nan was actually pretending to be asleep.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Suddenly being questioned by Qiao Dongliang, Qiao Zijin was scared out of her wits. She stuttered for a long while and did not manage to respond to the question.\u201cWhy are you shouting, didn\u2019t you just say, I will take care of Zijin\u2019s matters and you will take care of Qiao Nan\u2019s. This matter, you don\u2019t need to ask anymore.\u201d Ding Jiayi\u2019s face was serious. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to misunderstand Zijin. This matter was decided by me.\u201dBut the elder daughter mentioned it first.The elder daughter said that if she could get into a better high school, it would be easier to be admitted to a good university.\u201cFine.\u201d Qiao Dongliang laughed. But this laugh gave Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin\u2019s goose pimples. \u201cExcept for the school fees which we can negotiate, from now onwards, you take care of Zijin\u2019s living expenses alone. Anyway, the savings in the family have all been spent, whether you want to find a job, that\u2019s up to you. You spent 5000 yuan because of Zijin, both are my daughters, it\u2019s not fair to let Nan Nan suffer because of this. So, my money, other than giving it to Nan Nan for living expenses, I will be saving it for her too.\u201dAfter he finished, Qiao Dongliang went back to his room again. He shut the door loudly with a slam.Ding Jiayi sadly slapped her thighs. \u201cIt has come to this, how is she going to live?\u201dIf Old Qiao really was not going to care for Zijin anymore, if Ding Jiayi was going to find a job, how was Zijin going to survive?Ding Jiayi knew that Qiao Dongliang was serious this time. Even if he still cared about Qiao Zijin, he would not treat Qiao Zijin the same as before.The elder daughter was raised by her, Ding Jiayi knew that Qiao Zijin would not be able to endure this type of life. For the sake of her elder daughter, she must find a job.Ding Jiayi did not expect that after fighting for a few months, finally, not only did Qiao Nan not quit school, but also Ding Jiayi, who had been a housewife for 15 years, had to return to society and take a nine to five job. There would not be a moment of leisure.The Qiao family had such a bad fight, all four family members were in terrible moods.Ding Jiayi was washing the dishes at the same time and crying. She was not in the mood to eat, but Qiao Dongliang had to go to work tomorrow, so regardless of whether Qiao Dongliang would eat, she had to prepare the food.\u201cI really owe it to that pair of father and daughter in my previous life.\u201dThe two of them argued with her till they were red in the face and treated her like enemy, but she still had to wait on and feed the two of them. She must have sinned a lot.\u201cMom, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d Qiao Zijin, who never did housework, for the first time, did not pay lip service. She rolled up her sleeves and started helping. \u201cMom, is Dad really going to care only about Nan Nan, and not bother about me anymore?\u201d Having said that, Qiao Zijin\u2019s eyes were red.She was clearly supposed to be her parent\u2019s favorite child.When she saw that her elder daughter had come, Ding Jiayi sniffed and wiped the corner of her eyes with her sleeves. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about this matter. But Zijin, regarding Qiao Nan\u2019s fever, did you do it?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thereafter, her facial expression was awkward. \u201cNo, Nan Nan\u2019s fever had nothing to do with me.\u201d\u201cBut Qiao Nan said?\u201d Ding Jiayi heard what Qiao Nan said. She had definitely not done this, nor had Old Qiao . There were only four people in the house, so it must have been the elder daughter.\u201cIs what Nan Nan said certainly true? Mom, don\u2019t forget that Nan Nan\u2019s fever was so bad that day. She was sick and confused and mistook her dreams for reality. Nan Nan is paranoid, you mustn\u2019t become like her.\u201dQiao Zijin swiped her hands. \u201cMom, think about it, Dad just found out that we spent all the family savings so that I could study at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. If he also knew about Grandpa Li, he would be even more furious. We should try our best not to let Dad get angry again. Just now, Dad did not mention Nan Nan\u2019s dream. You should not take it to heart, nor should you mention it to Dad anymore. There is no such thing, Nan Nan was talking about her dream, don\u2019t blindly believe and get involved. You think there aren\u2019t enough matters to provoke Dad?\u201dOnly God knows that when Qiao Nan mentioned what happened on that rainy night, immediately, Qiao Zijin was so frightened that her heart was in her throat.Fortunately, her father did not continue to pursue this matter. If not, she might let the cat out of the bag.Qiao Zijin was afraid of Qiao Dongliang, but not Ding Jiayi.After Qiao Zijin\u2019s coaxing, Ding Jiayi was no longer bothered about whether Qiao Nan\u2019s words were true.There were enough troubles at home now, there would be no end if they pursued this matter again.Qiao Dongliang heard Ding Jiayi shouting for dinner time. Initially, he was not willing to come out of the room. He was furious with Ding Jiayi.But when he recalled that the doctor said the younger daughter was malnourished, Qiao Dongliang called Qiao Nan out. \u201cNan Nan, you\u2019re at your puberty age, don\u2019t be at odds with your body, the two of us \u2013 let\u2019s go and have our meal.\u201d\u201cOkay, Dad.\u201dQiao Nan immediately agreed. Although she was at odds with someone, no matter what, she should not be at odds with herself.The family of four were seated together. Qiao Dongliang did not cast a single look at his wife or elder daughter. He was only focused on filling Qiao Nan\u2019s bowl with the good dishes, and repeatedly told her, \u201cNan Nan, eat more, you must eat your fill, you\u2019re too skinny.\u201d\u201cI know, Dad. You work so hard, eat more too, don\u2019t shortchange yourself.\u201dQiao Nan also helped herself and filled Qiao Dongliang\u2019s bowl with all the meat and vegetables.In the past, the same plate of meat could feed the family for two or three meals. Now, it was like one meal as Qiao Nan tried her best to eat as much as she could.The whole family scrimped and saved, in the end, the money were all spent on Qiao Zijin. What a waste.When she saw that the Dongpo meat, which she had specially prepared to celebrate her elder daughter\u2019s return, was almost finished by the father and younger daughter \u2013 there were only three pieces left, Ding Jiayi felt the pinch. \u201cZijin, you eat too. You studied hard, and should eat more good stuff.\u201dAs she said that, Ding Jiayi placed one piece of meat into Qiao Zijin\u2019s bowl, added another, then placed the last piece in her own bowl.When she looked at the two pieces of meat in her bowl, Qiao Zijin moved her mouth. She felt very unhappy.It was such a big plate of meat. In the past, most of it would be for her. But today, it benefited Qiao Nan.The matter that was argued about today, most of it had to do with Qiao Zijin. Qiao Zijin did not want to eat the meat.Unexpectedly, her Dad was true to his word about not bothering about her anymore. He cared more about Qiao Nan and gave all the meat to her. If not for her Mom who gave her two pieces of the meat, this time, she might not even have any.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Nan Nan. You studied hard. Have better food when you are in school. Don\u2019t shortchange yourself.\u201d Qiao Dongliang took out five yuan from his pocket and passed to Qiao Nan. \u201cTake this money and spend. Although we should not be extravagant, wasteful, or yearn for things that do not belong to us, but we also should not be harsh to or shortchange ourselves, understand?\u201d\u201cDad, don\u2019t worry. I know.\u201d Qiao Nan helped herself to the money and put it away in her pocket.Qiao Dongliang and Qiao Nan were like a duet, Ding Jiayi\u2019s face was red, Qiao Zijin was so embarrassed that she almost buried her face in the bowl.After returning to his room, Qiao Dongliang thought about it. It was true that his wife was very concerned about the elder daughter but the wife was not familiar with the situation at the school.If the elder daughter had not mentioned anything before his wife, his wife would not possibly have had the idea of admitting her into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.Most importantly, with his wife\u2019s character, it was not possible that she had instantly made the decision to spend the family savings to let the elder daughter switch school.If the wife was so decisive, she could entirely depend on her own ability, leave the Ding family and seek a life of her own.Although the wife had a strong temper. If not for the matter that the Ding family wanted to sell her out, she would have remained in the Ding family and continued to be a slave to them.At the thought of it, Qiao Dongliang understood. He assessed that his elder daughter had taken great efforts in this.He did not blame the elder daughter for thinking of her own future.He could not accept that they had not discussed the matter with him, the head of the family, first. Instead, they had done it without consulting him, and he had to wait until Nan Nan mentioned it before finding out.Ding Jiayi wanted to let Qiao Nan quit school to work but Qiao Zijin did not try to dissuade her mother. Moreover, the root of the matter was because Qiao Zijin had spent the family savings for her studies. At this thought, Qiao Dongliang felt a little uneasy.For the first time, he discovered that, for the sake of her own future, the elder daughter was scheming towards her family members.After placing the pieces of the puzzle together, now, Qiao Dongliang looked at Qiao Zijin and felt extremely awkward and uneasy.His earlier words were entirely for Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin to hear.Qiao Zijin understood the meaning in Qiao Dongliang\u2019s words, she clenched her chopsticks. With her head down, she finished the bowl of rice. \u201cDad, can I talk to you?\u201dCoincidentally, Qiao Dongliang also finished his food at this time.Qiao Dongliang put down his bowl. He was still angry and actually did not feel like talking to Qiao Zijin, but, in the end, he said, \u201cFollow me to the study room.\u201dAs soon as father and daughter left, Qiao Nan immediately put down her bowl of rice and returned to her room.From today onwards, she would not do any household chores if Qiao Zijin was not doing them too.When she saw that all three of them were each more arrogant than the others, Ding Jiayi endured and dared not breathe a word. She could only clean up quietly.After she returned to the room, Qiao Nan stared at a book for a long time. Unfortunately, she did not register a single word in her mind.After while, Qiao Nan took a few deep breaths and told herself to stay calm.As of now, her mother and Qiao Zijin had only committed \u201cpetty crimes\u201d. Qiao Zijin was a smart person. She knew that she could not offend Dad as he was the sole breadwinner in the family. She could not continue to disappoint him.Whatever it was, even if her father was appeased by Qiao Zijin, she no longer needed to be nervous and afraid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She just hoped that she could continue with her studies.As for Qiao Zijin, as long as she did not provoke her, she would not bother about Qiao Nan.Of course, if her mother and Qiao Zijin still tried to bully her like before, then she would definitely retaliate against them as she had done today.After she sorted out her thoughts, Qiao Nan was finally able to read her books.In the study room, father and daughter sat facing each other. Once seated, Qiao Zijin\u2019s head dropped as tears rolled down her face pitifully.Qiao Zijin cried so badly, Qiao Dongliang gave a long sigh. \u201cAlright, don\u2019t cry. Tell me, what are you crying about?\u201dWhen she heard Qiao Dongliang open his mouth to speak, Qiao Zijin felt momentarily relieved. She wiped her tears and said, \u201cDad, I know I was wrong, I was jealous that Nan Nan\u2019s grades were better than mine. Dad, today\u2019s matter, it was not intentional. In fact, in fact I was so anxious today because of the matter regarding the passbook. I know Mom is good to me, she spent all the family savings to let me study at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. I also want to study hard but there are no more books at home, and you discovered those indecent books. Dad, I\u2019m anxious. I\u2019m scared. I am afraid that the family paid so much for me to study but I can\u2019t repay you with anything. The more nervous I am, the more I can\u2019t study well. But Nan Nan\u2026 no matter how bad she does, her grades are better than mine. And Nan Nan is the Vice Class Monitor. She receives awards every year. I have nothing.\u201dQiao Zijin sounded so helpless, like a trapped animal, groaning in pain.Although Qiao Zijin was not quite coherent, Qiao Dongliang understood her words.Basically, Qiao Zijin knew that she had spent too much money for her high school studies, yet her grades were poor during the summer period.In comparison to her own sister at home, the elder daughter was worried that she would make additional mistakes and cause her parents to dislike her.\u201cDad, I really didn\u2019t mean it and I don\u2019t want to be like this. Nan Nan is my real sister, I am the elder sister, It\u2019s only right that I treat her well and take care of her. How can I be inferior because my grades are worse than her. I thought that if I went to The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China where the teachers are better, my grades would improve and I could be as good as Nan Nan. At that time, Dad, you would have two outstanding daughters, and you would be proud to visit Grandpa Li. Dad, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201dAt the sight of Qiao Zijin crying so miserably, Qiao Dongliang could not help but soften. \u201cAlright, don\u2019t cry anymore, your eyes will be swollen if you continue.\u201d\u201cDad, forgive me this time, I won\u2019t dare to do this again. In fact, for today\u2019s matter, I admit that I was trying to let you know that Nan Nan is also an ordinary person, and like me, she will make mistakes. It is also because Nan Nan is my sister, and I am anxious about her. I don\u2019t want to see Nan Nan mix around with people whom she should not be mixing with and go astray. Dad, you have to believe me, on this point, I have good intentions for Nan Nan and don\u2019t mean to harm her. My only fault is that I was too anxious to jump to conclusions from insignificant evidence. I also did not give Nan Nan a chance to explain before I concluded that she was wrong. Dad, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely not do this this anymore.\u201dQiao Zijin admitted her mistake with a good attitude. She even reflected on what she had done wrong. What could Qiao Dongliang say to her?Qiao Dongliang gave a sigh. \u201cZijin, let me ask you, Nan Nan talked about another matter today, what do you think?\u201dQiao Zijin\u2019s gently clenched the fists placed on her knee. Thereafter, her face was innocent and stunned. \u201cDad, which matter are you referring to?\u201d\u201cNan Nan\u2019s fever.\u201d\u201cDad, Nan Nan\u2019s fever has nothing to do with me. I trust that Mom did not do it either!\u201d Qiao Zijin denied on the spot immediately.Even if this was before her mother, she would not admit to this matter.\u201cDo you mean that Nan Nan is lying?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who lied, what I know is that I didn\u2019t do it. Nan Nan and I are biological sisters, I may talk about Nan Nan, but I would never do this kind of thing.\u201dQiao Dongliang sighed another time. He also did not believe that the elder daughter would do such a thing.Qiao Dongliang could remember his younger daughter\u2019s expression and words vividly. It was difficult for him to console himself that the younger daughter\u2019s matter was only her delusion and not what had really happened.\u201cZijin, I\u2019ll say this again. Whatever happened in the past, I can not pursue or ask anymore. However, I don\u2019t want a similar thing to happen a second time. Do you understand what I mean?\u201dQiao Zijin\u2019s fingernails had already created many dents on her hands.Upon hearing this from Qiao Dongliang, Qiao Zijin knew that her father did not fully believe what she had just said.\u201cDad, I know. You watch my behavior in future.\u201d Qiao Zijin forced a smile and replied briefly, \u201cDad, then I shall return to my room to do my homework.\u201d\u201cGo.\u201dWhile Qiao Zijin was returning to her room, she passed by Qiao Nan\u2019s room. Before she open the door of her room, her eyes glared fiercely for a few seconds towards the entrance of Qiao Nan\u2019s room.Qiao Zijin locked the door of her room. Thereafter, she pulled out a notebook and repeatedly wrote a sentence with her pen \u201cQiao Nan the bitch, go and die!\u201dQiao Zijin only felt a little better after she filled a large page of the notebook.Qiao Zijin tore out this page, lit a match and burnt it to ashes. Thereafter, she then took out her homework to continue with it.\u201cOld, Old Qiao.\u201d During night time, Ding Jiayi quietly went in to the bedroom, she stuttered as she called Qiao Dongliang.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Qiao Dongliang asked coldly.\u201cOld Qiao, Zijin will be going to school the day after.\u201d Ding Jiayi\u2019s face stiffened. Having spent half her lifetime with Qiao Dongliang, this was the first time that she felt so awkward to ask him for money. \u201cEven if Zijin\u2019s matters will be solely taken care of by me alone, I also need time to find a job, right? But what about Zijin\u2019s meal expenses?\u201dQiao Dongliang looked at Ding Jiayi coldly. He took out six yuan from his pocket and passed to Ding Jiayi. \u201cTake it.\u201dWhen she saw six yuan, Ding Jiayi pursed her lips. \u201cOnly six yuan?\u201dClearly Old Qiao had given Qiao Nan five yuan. Five yuan for Qiao Nan for that week, but only six yuan for Zijin for two weeks?Furthermore, Qiao Nan was a a junior high school student, and Zijin was in senior high school!\u201cIn the past, you only gave Zijin money. Nan Nan did not get a cent from you. Has Nan Nan said anything? Because of you, Nan Nan can only use and wear the leftovers from Zijin. Did Nan Nan say anything? Six yuan is not much but it\u2019s definitely enough for Zijin to have her meals. If you want to give Zijin more money, then find a job soon. With income, I will not interfere in how you manage Zijin.\u201dSimilarly, Ding Jiayi should not interfere in any matter regarding Qiao Nan. Qiao Dongliang would manage everything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQiao Dongliang said that because he had made up his mind.His wife\u2019s favoritism had not happened over one or two days, and it was very serious. If his wife continued to take care of both of them, the younger daughter would certainly be destroyed at the hands of his wife.The reasons why Qiao Dongliang dared to hand Qiao Zijin over to Ding Jiayi were twofold. First, Ding Jiayi had always been biased towards Qiao Zijin. As such, Qiao Zijin would not be neglected if Ding Jiayi took care of her.Qiao Dongliang was not concerned about Qiao Zijin being rebellious. After all, children would go through this stage during their puberty.By nature, the elder daughter was still a good child and he need not worry that much.Qiao Dongliang had put his words so bluntly, Ding Jiayi could not rebuke. She took the six yuan, and after consideration, she took out and added another two yuan from her own pocket, then passed the money to the elder daughter.\u201cMom, shouldn\u2019t it be 10 yuan?\u201d Qiao Zijin was a little unhappy when she saw the money. Compared to the previous time, the amount was small.Ding Jiayi smiled. \u201cHave you forgotten what your Dad said? Since I have not found a job yet, this family still depends on your Dad. You think eight yuan is little. Your Dad only gave me six and I added two yuan for you.\u201dIn the past, Ding Jiayi was also considered a responsible woman. However, she had been a full-time housewife for 15 years.All of a sudden, she had to return to society to work. Ding Jiayi felt awkward and unhappy.It was because of her elder daughter that she ended up in such a predicament.Qiao Zijin could see that Ding Jiayi was burning with anger inside. She quickly smiled. \u201cMom, don\u2019t be angry. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t know my grades. If I still do not work hard, how can I do better than Nan Nan? There\u2019s a lot of study materials for sale but they are not cheap. Given the situation at home, I don\u2019t mean to ask you for more money. I could gradually save up some of my meal expenses then buy them on my own. It\u2019s just that, all of a sudden, I was short of two yuan. My plan was disrupted and I probably have to buy the study materials later. Mom, don\u2019t be angry.\u201d\u201cIs it really for buying study materials?\u201d Ding Jiayi questioned suspiciously.The earlier matter regarding the novel had left a phobia on Ding Jiayi.If her daughter wanted to buy study materials, Ding Jiayi would use all means to squeeze out the money for her elder daughter.But not for buying those novels that were bad and time-wasting.The lack of family savings had now became the fear of Ding Jiayi.\u201cOf course it\u2019s for buying study materials.\u201d Qiao Zijin nodded her head hard. \u201cBut don\u2019t be anxious, Mom. I can save up a little gradually. But the living expenses cannot be reduced anymore, if not, I don\u2019t think I will have enough to eat, neither will I eat well.\u201dThose who attended The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China were either high achievers or from rich families.There were also quite a number who entered the school in the same way as Qiao Zijin. Most of them did not meet the entry criteria. Hence, the school simply arranged them to be in the same class, so that they do not affect the learning progress of the rest of the students.If not, if her friends were having good food such as protein dishes, Qiao Zijin could not possibly have vegetarian meals.Also, after attending the school, Qiao Zijin realized that there were many rich folk in this world. Her two weeks\u2019 living allowance was not even the one day\u2019s expenditure of the well-to-do students.At the thought of this, Qiao Zijin\u2019s lips pursed tightly, her eyes full of reluctance and jealousy.If Qiao Nan went to work, she could also lead such a life. It was all Qiao Nan\u2019s fault as she insisted on continuing her studies. She did not have any sisterly love for her, neither did she spare much thought for her.She should think of the past \u2013 that year when her mother was pregnant with Qiao Nan, she had to take so much suffering and humiliation.Qiao Nan owed her and it was only right for her to quit school and support her!\u201cAs long as you are sensible, Mom is happy. Don\u2019t worry, Mom will find a job as soon as possible. When Mom has a job, you will definitely be given 10 yuan. But Zijin, you still have to save a little, some of your school supplies can still be used, don\u2019t dump it all on Qiao Nan like you did before. The family\u2019s savings are gone, and Mom has to find a way to save some money. Otherwise, we won\u2019t have money to seek medical treatment if any of us fall sick in future.\u201dNow that there was famine in the family, there was a limit to how much Ding Jiayi could dote on Qiao Zijin now.\u201cI know, Mom.\u201d Qiao Zijin bit her lips and replied with a forced smile.After Ding Jiayi left, Qiao Zijin threw a tantrum and started hitting her own bed.National Day would be in half a month\u2019s time. Her class had thought of having a performance. She had to dance but she was short of a costume now.Qiao Zijin was the lead dancer and she could not be dressed like everyone else. She had her eye on a dance dress which was selling for 10 yuan.Qiao Zijin had really been saving money recently. However, it was not for the revision materials, it was for the dress for the National Day performance.Unless, when Qiao Zijin went to school this time, she missed her meals for two weeks to save up the 10 yuan. If not, she would either have to give up the performance or the lead dancer role.After some consideration, Qiao Zijin stood up and went to knock on the door of Qiao Nan\u2019s bedroom. \u201cNan Nan, are you in, can I come in?\u201dUpon hearing Qiao Zijin\u2019s voice, Qiao Nan put away her books properly. \u201cCome in.\u201dAfter Qiao Zijin pushed opened the door and went in. She did not look good.In the entire Qiao family, Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi\u2019s bedroom was of course the biggest. Qiao Nan\u2019s room was originally Qiao Dongliang\u2019s study room. It was slightly bigger than Qiao Zijin\u2019s room, and the lighting in this room was particularly good.Initially, Qiao Zijin wanted to stay in this room but Ding Jiayi would not allow it.Ding Jiayi\u2019s initial arrangement was, of course, to let the couple have the biggest room. This room with good lighting was for the son, and Qiao Zijin\u2019s current bedroom was supposed to be the study room.Of course, the room where Qiao Nan lived before was not arranged by Ding Jiayi for Qiao Zijin.Just because Ding Jiayi had given birth to Qiao Nan and not a son, Qiao Zijin now had the third-class room, and Qiao Nan the fourth-class room.But who would expect that, at the year that Qiao Nan was 15 years old, although she was obviously not the son, she now lived in the room that Ding Jiayi had once prepared for the son.Qiao Zijin revealed this matter. \u201cNan Nan, do you know, Mom originally prepared this room for her son. She would not allow me to do so when I wanted to stay here.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d Qiao Nan was not affected.Qiao Zijin was stunned. Unexpectedly, Qiao Nan\u2019s reaction was too cold. Shouldn\u2019t Qiao Nan feel as indignant as her and be dissatisfied with her Mom\u2019s biased behavior?\u201cAny matter?\u201d\u201cThere is something.\u201d Qiao Zijin recalled her motive. \u201cNan Nan, I would like to ask you for a favor. I remembered that you have some money. Can you lend it to me? I will return it to you in future?\u201dQiao Nan twisted her eyebrows. \u201cBorrow money? I don\u2019t have any!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere was saying that talking about money hurts relationships, and talking about relationships hurt money.What sort of feelings would she have for Qiao Zijin? In this life, for any money that belonged to her, she would not give a single cent to Qiao Zijin.\u201cWhy not, if you don\u2019t have money, how did you buy the old books? Nan Nan, we are biological sisters, you would rather let the money rot in your hands than to lend it to me, are you so heartless?\u201d Upon thinking, Qiao Zijin softened her tone. \u201cNan Nan, I need it urgently this time, really! I am only borrowing from you. I will definitely return it to you.\u201d\u201cI have said, I don\u2019t have money. I have spent all my money.\u201d Qiao Nan insisted that she had no money. \u201cAlso, what do you need the money for, why are you so hard up? If you need it for a decent purpose, our parents will not shortchange you.\u201dTowards the end of the conversation, Qiao Nan\u2019s eyes flashed a look of sarcasm.Qiao Zijin was the family\u2019s elder daughter. From a young age, she was obedient and well-behaved. She also had a sweet tongue.Qiao Nan knew that her Dad had always thought highly of Qiao Zijin. As they did not have a son, her Dad had even toyed the idea of taking in a son-in-law that would bear the Qiao family\u2019s surname for Qiao Zijin in future.Unfortunately, Qiao Zijin snatched Chen Jun from her. Given Chen Jun\u2019s family background, it was impossible for him to be a taken in as a son-in-law.Qiao Zijin was even pregnant with Chen Jun\u2019s child. Her mother kicked up a big fuss. Her father had no choice but to allow Chen Jun to marry Qiao Zijin.Because of that, her father had once shifted this thought to Qiao Nan.Her mother would not be willing to give all of what the Qiao family had to her. If she had to give it away, she would rather leave it for Qiao Zijin\u2019s children.Knowing her father\u2019s thoughts, Ding Jiayi had been watching Qiao Nan and forbidding her to talk about boyfriend and marriage.Similar to now, Qiao Zijin clearly did so many wrong things and schemed against her umpteen times. But her father still forgave Qiao Zijin. The family\u2019s treatment to Qiao Zijin would not change much.Qiao Nan sighed. Forget it, she did not want to think of this. Anyway, she just wanted to continue with her studies and protect her own interests.As for the other matters, she would let her mother and Qiao Zijin be.\u201cWhy are you like this, obviously I came to you because it\u2019s not convenient to ask Dad and Mom. If I could ask them, would I still need to borrow from you?\u201d All this while, Qiao Nan had acceded to all of Qiao Zijin\u2019s requests. Qiao Zijin had asked her to lend the money but Qiao Nan was as tight-lipped as the shell of a clam \u2013 she would not open her mouth. Qiao Zijin\u2019s anger rose again.Qiao Nan laughed coldly. \u201cYou can say whatever you like. Two words \u2013 No Money.\u201dHaving said that, she continued to read her book and do her homework. She could not be bothered with Qiao Zijin.\u201cIf you don\u2019t give me the money, don\u2019t expect to lead a good life!\u201d Qiao Zijin rudely snatched the book from Qiao Nan\u2019s hands.Qiao Nan looked at Qiao Zijin coldly. \u201cDo you want me to call Dad in?\u201d\u201cCall if you are capable of it!\u201d\u201cDad!\u201dQiao Zijin\u2019s face turned pale the moment that she saw Qiao Nan calling for her father. Yet, she continued to sit in Qiao Nan\u2019s room, seemingly self-assured.\u201cWhy?\u201d When the younger daughter called, Qiao Dongliang looked quite happy when he came over. But he was surprised when he saw that the elder daughter was also present.\u201cDad, nothing much. Nan Nan is still angry with me. I wanted to apologize to Nan Nan but she is not pleased that I disturbed her while she is reading.\u201d Qiao Zijin\u2019s was a smooth talker and she made it sounded like it was all Qiao Nan\u2019s fault.\u201cNan Nan?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was going to reprimand the younger daughter for being so petty. They could not possibly continue their disagreements with each other. But Qiao Dongliang quickly held back.\u201cDad, I can only say that I did not!\u201d Qiao Nan was also angered by Qiao Zijin\u2019s shameless behavior.Qiao Zijin was only 17 years old and she knew how to tell lies without blinking an eye.No wonder. Before her death in her previous life, Qiao Zijin committed adultery and Chen Jun divorced her without giving any marital compensation. But, in the end, she could blame all this on Qiao Nan.\u201cNan Nan, don\u2019t be angry anymore. Actually I am truly concerned about you. I apologize to you, can you forgive me please?\u201d Qiao Zijin played the act as she spoke.Qiao Nan lifted her chin, both amused and angry. \u201cSure, Sister. Isn\u2019t this just a misunderstanding, real sisters do not have enmity overnight. I forgive you. Come, to show that I have really forgiven you, let us have a hug!\u201dQiao Nan came from the 21st century. There was nothing that she had not seen.In the 1990s, Generation Z were more introverted and would never say words such as \u201cI love you\u201d. Neither would they display any physical affection for each other.Without waiting for Qiao Zijin to respond, Qiao Nan opened her arms and gave Qiao Zijin a passionate hug. \u201cSister, I have really forgiven you. We are on such good terms.\u201dQiao Zijin was totally stunned by this sudden action by Qiao Nan. She stood there feeling stiff and did not know what to do.Without waiting for Qiao Zijin to react, Qiao Nan had already let go of her hands and returned to her place.Look who was more thick-skinned and better in acting!Seeing that the two daughters have reconciled, especially that the younger daughter used such an affectionate way to prove it, Qiao Dongliang smiled. \u201cZijin is more like an elder sister now. Nan Nan is also good, not petty, I am not worried now seeing that the two of you have reconciled.\u201d\u201cDad, I\u2019m going to do my homework. Why don\u2019t Sister and you leave the room?\u201d The play was over, it was time to go.\u201cRight, you study hard.\u201d Nothing was more important than the child\u2019s studies. Qiao Dongliang looked at Zijin. \u201cZijin, we will leave. Nan Nan needs to do her homework.\u201dQiao Zijin ground her teeth, to hell with it.In the past, Qiao Nan was obedient and plain spoken. When did she become as slippery as an eel, such that she could not even catch her?\u201cDad, I have homework too. Can I do it together with Nan Nan?\u201d Qiao Zijin took a breath. Anyway, there was no way that she would be getting any money from Qiao Nan today. She might as well disturb Nan Nan these two days.Qiao Zijin was not only shameless, but also wanted to play rogue. Fine, since she wanted to kick up a fuss, so be it!\u201cDad, it\u2019s rare that the three of us, father and daughters, are together. Dad, why don\u2019t you also take a book to sit here and read, I will do homework with Sister. In case we have any questions, we can also discuss with you. Dad, do you think this works?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dAll the while, Qiao Dongliang was not close to his daughters. He wished to be a responsible and steady father who quietly supported his children with a lot of fatherly love.It was rare that the three, father and daughters, could enjoy family time together. Qiao Dongliang did not have any reason to decline. He took a book from the study room and came back to have a seat.Qiao Zijin clenched her fists and secretly glared at Qiao Nan.If Dad was with them, she would not have any opportunity to ask Qiao Nan for money.Qiao Zijin had a plot, Qiao Nan also had her strategy.As a reborn \u201cold woman\u201d who was already more than 30 years old, she would have wasted her life if she could not even win the struggle with a 17 year-old girl.Although being reborn would not give a person more intelligence, it would give the person more life experience and knowledge, especially improvements in the way and attitude that they dealt with problems.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After dawdling for a long time, she had only finished a page while Qiao Nan had almost completed hers.Qiao Dongliang, who was reading a book and silently observing, quietly furrowed his brow.True enough, the elder daughter was probably not cut out for studies.Nan Nan was very focused on completing her homework, she was effective and not distracted at all. But Zijin completely could not do so.Fortunately, Zijin was the elder daughter. When she was older, he could take in a son-in-law that would bear the bride\u2019s family name and move into his house. Under his wife and his watch, Zijin would not be bullied even if her grades were not good.Qiao Dongliang glanced at Qiao Nan again and his eyes shone brightly.Nan Nan was very outstanding and would be promising in future.Qiao Dongliang was aware that whoever was willing to be take the Qiao family\u2019s surname might have lesser qualities, but he could also be an honest and down-to-earth chap.If Qiao Nan found an outstanding man, this man would also certainly not allow his child to take the Qiao surname.At the thought of this, Qiao Dongliang felt that this was quite a good arrangement. Then he continued to read his book.Such a heartwarming atmosphere continued until around nine that evening. Qiao Nan had completed her homework as planned. She closed her books and stretched.\u201cIt\u2019s quite late now, both of you should turn in early.\u201d Once Qiao Nan made a slight movement, Qiao Dongliang started to perk up.Qiao Nan breathed a sigh of relief, she stretched, washed up and went to sleep.Just when Qiao Nan thought that she had been released from this predicament, she saw Qiao Zijin wearing her pyjamas and standing at the entrance of her bedroom. She was hugging a pillow with her hands.Qiao Nan frowned \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d\u201cTonight, I am sleeping with you.\u201d Qiao Zijin smiled. Anyway, she had two days. She did not believe that she could not find a a way to get the money from Qiao Nan.Earlier, she told Qiao Nan that she was borrowing from her. If Qiao Nan had obligingly lent to her, she might really pay back the money when she had it.But after she kicked up such a fuss, Qiao Zijin made up her mind that she would never return the money to Qiao Nan once she received it. It was Qiao Nan\u2019s fault for not agreeing at the beginning.\u201cI remembered that you do not like to sleep with anyone.\u201d At the very least, Qiao Zijin never slept with her before.\u201cYou are my biological sister, how could you be considered as others. Nan Nan, you see, it\u2019s late, let\u2019s sleep.\u201d Qiao Zijin, affectionately pulled Qiao Nan\u2019s hands to return to the room.After they went in the room, Qiao Nan yawned. She knew that Qiao Zijin was set on hounding her until she get the money.Go ahead and hound. Who would be afraid?\u201cAre we sleeping or not?\u201d\u201cSleeping.\u201d Qiao Zijin placed her pillow beside that of Qiao Nan, covered herself with a blanket and proceeded to sleep.However, once Qiao Nan lied down and closed her eyes, Qiao Zijin started talking again. \u201cNan Nan, I\u2019m a little restless, can we lie down and chat with each other?\u201d\u201cSure, what do you want to chat about?\u201d\u201cThat Zhu Baoguo \u2013 is he really your deskmate?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know who my deskmate was, but now I think it is him.\u201d Anyway, she could not recall who her deskmates were in secondary one and two.\u201cHow did you know that Zhu Baoguo would encounter danger, and it was so coincidental that you happen to be at the scene?\u201d Qiao Zijin\u2019s eyes flashed with doubt; that was the part that she could not understand the most.The place that Zhu Baoguo was attacked was definitely not a place that most people would pass by. If not, he would not have suffered such a serious injury and needed to wait for Qiao Nan to call for help.Qiao Nan had her small secret and this was found out by Qiao Zijin long ago.Till today, her mother and her had not been able to find where Qiao Nan hid her books.Qiao Zijin already noticed that, in the recent month when Qiao Nan was studying at home, she had been reading the content of the four volumes of the past two years.So, it was true when Qiao Nan said she had forgotten most of what she had learnt in the past two years.If she could think of a way to get rid of this set of textbooks, Qiao Nan would not be able to revise. With the loss of four volumes\u2019 contents, she do not believe that Qiao Nan would do better than her in the exams.When the time came, Qiao Nan had no choice but to work.At the faint thought of this, Qiao Zijin was full of energy.\u201cIt was a coincidence that I passed by that road.\u201d Qiao Nan turned her head and saw Qiao Zijin with her eyes lit up. She wondered what ideas Qiao Zijin was hatching again.\u201cHappened to pass by, which path was so coincidental?\u201dQiao Nan pursed her lips. \u201cThe quad had only a few paths. Which path can it be? Think yourself.\u201d\u201cNan Nan, Dad has allowed you to continue your studies. Mom could not have a say in this, you can keep those books at home now. Furthermore, Mom did not do it intentionally last time, she was careless and sold your books together with mine. This kind of mistake, she will not repeat for a second time. If you put them somewhere else, it\u2019s kind of troublesome to retrieve it as and when you need it.\u201d\u201cNot troublesome.\u201d\u201cAre you still angry with Mom, she gave birth to and raised us. How hard it was. Nan Nan you can\u2019t be so petty, especially when you keep losing temper with Mom. That year, in order to give birth to you, Mom suffered a lot. You have never met the Ding family. I have seen them before, because Mom gave birth to you, you don\u2019t know how the Ding family laughed and made Mom so angry. She cried. Our grandmother laughed at Mom and said she had sinned in her previous life, that she did not do good in this life, so she could not bear a son and made the Qiao family lose the family line. For this matter, after Mom gave birth to you, she did not even have a proper confinement. Nan Nan, you have to be sensible and do more for Mom. She suffered so much for you.\u201d\u201cNot angry.\u201d There was nothing to be angry about since she had already been driven to the grave by her Mom once.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Don\u2019t be angry. In future, listen more to Mom at home. Just listen to whatever Mom tells you and don\u2019t be stubborn. Mom will be finding a job soon and it will be hard for her. The household chores at home, do as much as you can and lessen Mom\u2019s worries. A family that gets along with one another, that\u2019s the best. Right?\u201dQiao Nan rolled her eyes. Her mother was going to work to support Qiao Zijin, and to support Qiao Zijin\u2019s studies.There was no reason that Qiao Zijin should enjoy all the benefit, while she had to take on the responsibility of all the household chores. Wishful thinking!\u201cNan Nan, are you asleep?\u201d Qiao Zijin did not hear Nan Nan\u2019s response. She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re like a child. Cover yourself properly with the blanket. Don\u2019t kick. If you catch a cold this time, don\u2019t blame it on others again.\u201dQiao Zijin thought that Qiao Nan was asleep. Qiao Nan allowed Qiao Zijin to misunderstand, so that she could really sleep.Qiao Nan, who was really falling asleep, did not know that she had fallen for Qiao Zijin\u2019s ploy.At this moment, Ding Jiayi and Qiao Dongliang were awkwardly pressing their ears to the door of the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen they no longer hear a sound in the room, Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi stopped eavesdropping.Two adults, who had a combined age of almost 100, had to resort to such a way to eavesdrop on their daughters\u2019 conversation. Both of their faces were a little flustered.However, at the thought of the elder daughter\u2019s words, Ding Jiayi was extremely proud. \u201cSee, I told you before that Zijin is an obedient and sensible child. She is so good at heart. Today\u2019s matter about Qiao Nan, she was certainly too anxious but her intentions were good. She doesn\u2019t want her own sister to go astray.\u201d\u201cShe is the elder daughter in the family and should have such a heart and realization.\u201d There was a look of satisfaction in Qiao Dongliang\u2019s eyes.Qiao Zijin\u2019s words earlier had reflected her feelings towards her parents and concern and also expressed her concern and warning for her sister.As an elder sister, she should discipline the younger one.Qiao Dongliang, who was brainwashed by Ding Jiayi, did not realize that although Qiao Zijin was the elder daughter, she just knew how to talk and assign everything to Qiao Nan to do.The elder daughter should not only pay lip service. Why could she not prove it with her actions too?To put it bluntly, she was all talk and no action.\u201cOkay, we should sleep.\u201d As he heard that the daughters were asleep, Qiao Dongliang patted Ding Jiayi\u2019s shoulders and they returned to the room together.When both were lying on the same bed, Ding Jiayi suddenly asked. \u201cOld Qiao, I did not bear you a son. Do you really not mind?\u201dThe words from Ding Jiayi\u2019s mother in the past had become an issue that weighed heavily on her heart.But what Qiao Zijin did not know was the magnitude of the impact of Ding Jiayi\u2019s mother words on her.Ding Jiayi\u2019s mother laughed at Ding Jiayi and said that she could not bear a son as she did not do good. She would be a source of trouble to the family that she was married to. A few months after giving birth to Qiao Nan, Ding Jiayi decided to stop breastfeeding and was prepared to bear a third child for Qiao Dongliang.At the most, they would pay a fine. No matter what, she wanted a son to prove that she was a fortunate person and not one who did not do good.Qiao Dongliang objected and said that after they raised up the daughters, they could take in a son-in-law that bore the Qiao family name, and who would move into the Qiao family after marriage. It would be the same and there was no need to have a son.\u201cI don\u2019t mind. I have said before. Let\u2019s take in a son-in-law for Zijin. Don\u2019t think about this matter anymore.\u201d Qiao Dongliang sighed. His wife was unfortunate to have come from such a family.\u201cOld Qiao, it\u2019s so good to have married you in my life.\u201d Ding Jiayi leaned on Qiao Dongliang\u2019s shoulders and said emotionally.Qiao Dongliang did not say anything. He slept as he placed one of his arms around Ding Jiayi.To Ding Jiayi, this action was more comforting than a thousand words.In Qiao Nan\u2019s room, when Qiao Zijin confirmed that she heard the footsteps leaving, she revealed a smug smile on her face.When Qiao Zijin was washing up, Qiao Zijin had already told Ding Jiayi that she was sleeping in with Qiao Nan. Thereafter, she told Ding Jiayi that she was afraid that Qiao Nan would be furious, drive her out or quarrel with her. It would be bad if they ended up in a fight.Ding Jiayi was afraid that Qiao Zijin would be at a disadvantage, so she dragged Qiao Dongliang from the bed and insisted on finding out about the situation of the two daughters.Thereafter, when Qiao Zijin closed the room of the door, she saw a beam of light emanating from the bottom the door of the Qiao couple\u2019s bedroom. She was thus certain that her mother would drag her father to eavesdrop on them.Qiao Zijin, who was lying sidewards and looking at Qiao Nan sleeping, laughed. \u201cQiao Nan, Oh Qiao Nan, you\u2019re still too green to fight with me!\u201dUpon thinking, Qiao Zijin\u2019s face turned white and she gave Qiao Nan a hard push. \u201cWhy are you sleeping. I have not fallen asleep. Wake up and chat with me.\u201dQiao Nan, who was in already in a daze, was soon awakened by this push of Qiao Zijin. Frowning and sleepy-eyed, she sounded fatigued. \u201cWhat do you want to chat about?\u201d Hadn\u2019t their conversation already ended?\u201cAnything. I can\u2019t sleep anyway.\u201d Qiao Zijin said shamelessly.Qiao Nan pursed her lips and did not say a word.When Qiao Nan was falling asleep again, she was again jolted awake by Qiao Zijin.Qiao Nan, who was in the fit of an anger, unhappily shot a look at Qiao Zijin and realized that Qiao Zijin\u2019s face was full of gloating.Seeing that, Qiao Nan wanted to scold her. Sick, and seriously sick!\u201cNan Nan, do you want to sleep? Do you know why I can\u2019t sleep? Sigh, I\u2019ve been really short of money lately and I have to buy something. Dad and Mom spent so much money on me and I was too embarrassed to ask them for it. Nan Nan, can you help me? As long as my troubles are resolved, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to sleep and then I won\u2019t disturb you.\u201dOnce she got hold of the money, of course, she would not continue to stay in Qiao Nan\u2019s room. She would definitely return to her own room to sleep.\u201cIf my troubles are not resolved, I feel frustrated. I can\u2019t sleep when I feel the frustration. Nan Nan, what do you say?\u201dIf Qiao Nan was a man, she might have crumbled under the spell of Qiao Zijin\u2019s questions, but she was a woman who did not have any good feeling towards Qiao Zijin.Qiao Zijin had made herself clear and Qiao Nan fully understood what she wanted.From the moment that she was reborn, Qiao Nan had told herself that in this life \u2013 she would not let Qiao Zijin take a single cent away from her again.As for her mother, she would still fulfill her duty as a daughter, but damn, she would rather buy her mother things than give her money. The latter would only benefit Qiao Zijin.Qiao Zijin wishfully wanted to get some money from her. There was no way!\u201cI don\u2019t have money. I can\u2019t help you.\u201d Qiao Nan rejected her flatly.Since Qiao Zijin would not let her sleep, she might as well not sleep. She could silently recite in her mind what she had revised today.Not knowing that Qiao Nan was reciting the knowledge in her mind, when Qiao Zijin saw Qiao Nan closing her eyes, she counted the time and started to nudge Qiao Nan again.\u201cWhat?\u201d This time, Qiao Nan\u2019s voice was very clear. There was no sign of fatigue.Qiao Zijin put her hands back resentfully and ground her teeth. \u201cNothing. I just can\u2019t sleep. You have to keep me company. If not, I feel so lonely.\u201d\u201cOkay, keeping you company.\u201d After Qiao Zijin finished revising her maths knowledge, she also recited in her mind a section of the secondary one\u2019s syllabus that required memorization. She almost fell asleep but was nudged by Qiao Zijin again.This time, Qiao Nan simply opened her mouth and said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t sleep. Still keeping you company.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 \u201d Qiao Zijin replied briefly as she was feeling down. Most importantly, this word of Qiao Zijin was faint and she seemed to have some difficulty saying it.After Qiao Nan finished memorizing the last page of the syllabus, she heard that Qiao Zijin, who was beside her, was already snoring.Qiao Nan gave a long yawn and finally went to sleep with ease.The next day, when Qiao Zijin woke up, it was already daytime and Qiao Nan was nowhere to be seen.Qiao Zijin gave a stare and jumped up from the bed anxiously. \u201cMom, where is Nan Nan?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qiao Nan woke up at half past six. She washed her clothes and left. I don\u2019t know where she went.\u201dA family of four but Qiao Nan only washed her own clothes. Of course, Ding Jiayi had to wash the rest of the clothes for the remaining three.In the past, when Qiao Nan helped her everyday, Ding Jiayi did not feel that she was helping her much. Moreover, she felt that Qiao Nan was expected to help.When Qiao Nan stopped helping with the household chores, Ding Jiayi found herself busy all day long. There was never a moment of rest.Just the household matters alone, she wished that she was a superhuman with three heads and six arms. Ding Jiayi was skeptical \u2013 if she went out to find a job today, who would do all the housework?\u201cRight, Zijin, you should wake up and wash up. I need to go out to look for a job. There are some household chores \u2013 why don\u2019t you help out?\u201dDing Jiayi really had no choice. She had to find a job. If not, she would not have money for the elder daughter.\u201cMom.\u201d Zijin woke up quickly, her face of full displeasure. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to do these things, wait for Qiao Nan come back and let her do it.\u201dLast night, she clearly intended to pester Qiao Nan continuously. Unless Qiao Nan gave her the money, she was not prepared to let Qiao Nan sleep.But, in the end, she fell asleep herself and Qiao Nan woke up earlier than her. She was so mad!It was almost 11 o\u2019clock when Qiao Zijin finished her breakfast. \u201cMom, Qiao Nan will definitely be back later. I don\u2019t believe she will not come home for lunch.\u201d\u201cThis is already not the first time.\u201d Ding Jiayi no longer harbored any hopes for the younger daughter.During the last few days of the summer vacation, every morning after Qiao Nan finished her breakfast, she would leave the house and only come back in the evening, when Qiao Dongliang was off work.That wretched girl was emboldened as she had Old Qiao\u2019s money in her pocket.Now that Qiao Dongliang gave money to Qiao Nan directly, Ding Jiayi wondered how much her husband would give Qiao Nan each time. At the thought of this money, she could not help feeling the pinch.\u201cAlright, today, you\u2019re going to be alone at home. I will be out looking for a job. Zijin, it is rare that you are alone at home. Even if you are really reluctant to do the housework, at the very least, please read up more. For your sake, I did everything. But if you still can\u2019t catch up on your academic performance\u2026 \u201dPreviously, Ding Jiayi bit the bullet and was willing to take out all the family savings for Qiao Zijin to attend The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China because Qiao Zijin said that the school\u2019s teachers were more qualified. Hence, she would definitely be able to do well and catch up on her studies.To allow Qiao Zijin to study in a famous high school was not the only reason why Ding Jiayi parted with so much money.Qiao Zijin\u2019s expression changed. She smiled thereafter. \u201cMom, I know, I\u2019ll definitely not let you down. The teachers in our school are so good and I can understand all their lessons. I\u2019ll definitely be serious in my studies. Mom, go and find a job. Since I\u2019m home, I will do whatever chores I can. I will leave those that I can\u2019t finish and read my books thereafter?\u201dStudying was the Achilles\u2019 Heel of Qiao Zijin. In the recent months, Qiao Zijin had put all of her thoughts to the row dance. How could she remember what the teachers had taught in the past month?There were more exams in high school than the experimental high school. She also recalled that when she went to school, the teacher mentioned about an important upcoming exam. At the thought of this, Qiao Zijin felt guilty.At other times, Qiao Zijin would always have ways to appease Ding Jiayi. But when it came to exams, Qiao Zijin\u2019s words would not be more convincing than her grades \u2013 which would stare directly at Ding Jiayi\u2019s face.Qiao Zijin saw Ding Jiayi out personally. When Ding Jiayi was further away from the house, Qiao Zijin then pulled a long face. \u201cDamn Qiao Nan, she thwarts my plans since she was a child. If only\u2026\u201dIf only her parents had not given birth to another daughter \u2013 Qiao Nan. If Qiao Nan, this sister, did not exist, how good would that be?If her parents only had her as the daughter, regardless of how bad her grades were, they parents would definitely do their utmost to nurture her. There would not be a need for her to let the grades speak for themselves.\u201cI don\u2019t believe I can\u2019t find Qiao Nan\u2019s money.\u201d Qiao Zijin snorted and rushed into Qiao Nan\u2019s room angrily. She searched the entire room once, until she was sweaty and panting.\u201cHorrible horrible!\u201d After much sweat, Qiao Zijin, who could not find a single cent, wanted to wreck Qiao Nan\u2019s room.Qiao Zijin sat on the bed and let out a breath, thinking of what to do about her future.During that rainy night, Qiao Zijin was really the one who had removed the blanket from Qiao Nan\u2019s body. She had also opened the windows.Qiao Zijin had everything planned out. Qiao Nan\u2019s grades were so much better than hers. If Qiao Nan wanted to study in a good school, the family would have to spend even more money. Her father\u2019s income alone would not be sufficient for this. Moreover, her father\u2019s income also had to provide for Qiao Nan\u2019s living expenses.If Qiao Nan went to work, the family would have fewer expenses and more income.As such, if there were two people working in the family, she would be able to continue her studies regardless of the situation.Most importantly, Qiao Zijin had long schemed about this \u2013 once Qiao Nan quit school, her grades in the school would no longer matter.Qiao Nan had already quit school. If her family discontinued her studies because of her poor grades, they would never be able to lift up their heads in the quad.To put it bluntly, Qiao Zijin wanted to be the only one. She had to be the only one.Qiao Zijin had it all planned. However, there was a large gap between the ideal and reality.Qiao Nan would not co-operate and stubbornly contended against her. In addition, with Qiao Dongliang\u2019s support, Qiao Zijin\u2019s plan was a fiasco without any success.If not for this, she would not look so awkward and guilty when Ding Jiayi asked her about her grades.The more she thought about it, the more anxious Qiao Zijin felt. She started rubbing her hands on her thigh.It would be too difficult to improve her grades. The teachers in the school were good but the students were better. She was not in the same league of those who entered the school with their own abilities.Also, as she had not built a good foundation in her studies while she was in junior high school, it would not help even if the teachers taught well in the senior high school.If she did not do well for this month\u2019s test again, her parents might really discontinue her studies.Senior high school was not junior high school \u2013 it was not considered as part of the nine years of compulsory education.Qiao Zijin had ants in her pants and she was spinning with anxiety.She had not resolved the matter regarding the dance dress yet. Because of Ding Jiayi\u2019s words, she now had another problem (her studies) to worry about.She could not understand why senior high school had to be different from junior high school. There were four important examinations in senior high school instead of two.Nevertheless, if there were no Parent-Teacher conferences after each month\u2019s examination, she could probably find a way to keep this from her family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was obvious that someone had gone through her room.Qiao Nan twisted her lips and laughed. There was no need for her to ask anything. She knew what Qiao Zijin was up to.Without a word, Qiao Nan tidied up the room that Qiao Zijin made a mess of and read her books quietly.Qiao Nan was moving about tidying her room but Qiao Zijin had yet to come back to her senses. It was only until Qiao Nan finished revising two pages of her book did Qiao Zijin snorted in shock, \u201cWhen did you come back, why didn\u2019t you make a sound, don\u2019t you know how frightening it is to be scared by another person?!\u201dQiao Zijin was startled by Qiao Nan who had popped up right in front of her. Her reaction was much bigger than Qiao Nan\u2019s.Qiao Nan rolled her eyes and said, \u201cI have already tidied my room, when do you think I returned?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Qiao Zijin smiled awkwardly. \u201cI dropped something. But I couldn\u2019t find it. So I searched through your room. I finally found it in the end. Sorry, Nan Nan.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I have tidied the room.\u201d Qiao Nan said pointedly. They all know she was looking for money.\u201cZijin, I am back.\u201d Ding Jiayi sounded tired.\u201cMom!\u201d Qiao Zijin\u2019s eyes brightened and dashed out of Qiao Nan\u2019s room to welcome her. \u201cMom, have you found a job today?\u201d\u201cFound it.\u201d Ding Jiayi dusted off the dirt on her clothes tiredly.Ding Jiayi has been a housewife for years and yet she had to look for a job now. She almost could not bring herself to say that she was on the hunt for jobs.Ding Jiayi had always been very sociable. But when it came to job searching, it was as if her lips were glued together. She just could not bring herself to ask.Given her situation, even if she managed to find a job, it would not be an easy job.After a half day\u2019s work, Ding Jiayi finally realized that it was not easy to make a living. Back then, she was so fortunate.\u201cZijin, why haven\u2019t you tidied up the house?\u201d Ding Jiayi was unhappy when she went into the house and saw that it was still messy.Ding Jiayi had finished washing the clothes before she went out. But the dirty dishes from lunchtime had not been washed. She hoped that the elder daughter could help with the washing and to sweep the floor as well. These were simple household chores the elder daughter should be able to handle.But she never would have imagined that when she came back, the house would still look as messy as when she left in the afternoon.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Qiao Zijin knew that she was in trouble. She was in Qiao Nan\u2019s room, pondering over her exams and her dance costume. She had forgotten all about the household chores.\u201cMom, but I have tidied Nan Nan\u2019s room. Go and take a look if you don\u2019t believe me?\u201dQiao Nan came out from her room to get a drink and overheard Qiao Zijin\u2019s audacious lie.Qiao Nan twitched her lips, did not say a word and poured a drink for herself.Ding Jiayi was tired to death after working for half a day. The look of apathy on her younger daughter\u2019s face made her boil with anger. \u201cWhat kind of attitude is this?!\u201dDespite being yelled at, Qiao Nan did not bother to argue. She said nonchalantly, \u201cMom, you are back. Mom, you must be tired. I am going back to my room to study.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to study? You are all grown up, yet you needed your sister to help you tidy up your room? You are so useless!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this now?\u201d Qiao Dongliang had just stepped into the house and overheard his wife scolding the younger daughter.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even know to be more understanding of her parents who are working and she only know how to enjoy herself. Is that what the books taught you? If that\u2019s true, what\u2019s there to study? If not, what have you learnt all these years?\u201d Ding Jiayi lifted her chin and lamented. She wanted Qiao Dongliang to know of the situation at home.Qiao Dongliang had been used to the house being neat and tidy. He could not help but knit his eyebrows when he realized the house was a little messy. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone tidy up?\u201d\u201cI went out to work.\u201d\u201cI was out studying.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dDing Jiayi and Qiao Nan gave their reasons for not tidying up. But Qiao Zijin was stumped for words.\u201cI\u2026 I tidied up Nan Nan\u2019s room.\u201d\u201cYou took the whole day to do that?\u201d Qiao Dongliang asked incredulously. \u201cBesides, Nan Nan always tidies her own room.\u201d\u201cNan Nan woke up earlier than me, she didn\u2019t tidy the room as I was still sleeping. Dad, I have never done such chores before, hence I am slower. You\u2026 You, please don\u2019t be angry.\u201d\u201cForget it. Anyway it\u2019s not very dirty. Everyone help to clean up the house.\u201d Qiao Dongliang sighed.\u201cI\u2026 I will wash the dishes!\u201d Qiao Zijin immediately volunteered for the easier chore while stealing glances furtively at Qiao Nan.Her only excuse was that she had tidied Qiao Nan\u2019s room. But in fact, Qiao Nan tidied the room herself. Only the both of them knew about this.Qiao Zijin noticed that Qiao Nan was not a pushover like before. She was worried that she might expose her lies in front of their parents.But Qiao Zijin observed Qiao Nan for a while. She did not make any comment. Instead, she took the broom and started cleaning up.\u201cPhew.\u201d Qiao Zijin breathed a sigh of relief. Qiao Nan did have a temper now as compared to before. But deep down inside, she was still a pushover like before. This was good news to her.Qiao Nan laughed dryly when she saw the look of relief on Qiao Zijin\u2019s face. She did not want to argue with Qiao Zijin regarding the room not because she had given in to her, but that Qiao Zijin still had no idea of her importance to her parents.Cleaning the room was just a small matter. If she was to fight for the credit with Qiao Zijin, her Dad might acknowledge it, but he would not be happy at all.Qiao Zijin was at home the whole day, yet she had not done any household chores. Even though this might make their parents realize how lazy Qiao Zijin was, it was not something to be proud of. After all, they were the ones who had brought up this lazy daughter.In fact, her Dad would think that Qiao Nan was too petty-minded. Even if Qiao Nan was the one who did the chores, she should help her out and let Qiao Zijin take the credit.After all they were a family, one should not haggle over every ounce. It was okay to be at a slight disadvantage once in a while.Her father asked the question not because he wanted to make things difficult for Qiao Zijin, in fact he wanted to see her making progress.The eldest daughter, it was such a superior position.Her father might have given up on her in her previous lifetime as she herself did not fight, but the other reason was that her sacrifice was for the good of Qiao Zijin.Otherwise, if her father stood firm, there was no way that her mother would not listen. Back then, she was more submissive. If her mother had not insisted, she would not have quit school and start working.At the thought of this, Qiao Nan sneered. Because of her, her mother lost her job and her father was discharged from the army. In the end, she turned out to be a girl. Actually deep down inside, her father harbored some bitterness towards her.In her previous lifetime, she was always the one to be sacrificed. All the sacrifices she made were for the good of Qiao Zijin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if it was against her father, she would also not budge an inch.Qiao Nan told herself this was the last time that she satisfied Qiao Zijin.Unlike Qiao Zijin, Qiao Nan was nimble and quick in her chores. While Qiao Zijin was still doing the dishes, she was done with sweeping the floor and she had even thrown the dirt away.\u201cForget it, you better stop washing.\u201d Ding Jiayi who was washing the vegetables saw that Qiao Zijin had not done the dishes properly. The bowls were still dirty. She had a splitting headache. She might have to wash the dishes all over again. \u201cQiao Zijin, you make a change with me. You wash the vegetables, I will do the dishes.\u201dLooking at the dirty vegetables, Qiao Zijin had a look of displeasure on her face. But she still changed with Ding Jiayi.But while washing the vegetables, she came into contact with something hairy and soft. She took a glance and shrieked. \u201cMom, Mom, there\u2019s a worm, there\u2019s a worm!\u201dAt Qiao\u2019s house, Qiao Zijin had not seen cockroaches, let alone worms.Whenever there were cockroaches at home, Qiao Zijin would hide somewhere and the remaining three of them would get rid of the cockroaches.\u201cIsn\u2019t it normal for vegetables to have worms?\u201d Ding Jiayi was having a headache. Although she had only worked for half a day, she was not used to working. She felt tired to the bone.She could not even take a rest at home and on top of that Zijin was not being helpful at all. She could not understand why Zijin was kicking up such a big fuss over a tiny worm.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Qiao Dongliang peered in to check. \u201cWhat is the worm that you are talking about?\u201dQiao Dongliang saw on the vegetables crawled a worm and understood what was the commotion all about.\u201cIt\u2019s only a worm, if you are scared, you just have to pick it with the chopsticks.\u201d Qiao Dongliang picked up the worm and threw it away deftly. \u201cDon\u2019t be so flustered and kick up a big fuss. You have to learn from Nan Nan. When she was about seven or eight years old, she was already helping out with the household chores. Old Ding, Zijin is a big lady now. You can\u2019t just teach Nan Nan but neglect Zijin. Didn\u2019t you say that Zijin knew how to do all these chores?\u201dBack then whenever Qiao Nan helped out with the household chores, Qiao Dongliang would ask why the elder daughter was not helping.Qiao Dongliang was a traditional man. He felt that every female should learn to cook.Ding Jiayi would always say that Qiao Zijin knew how to do all the chores. Qiao Dongliang did not give it much thought. But now, after seeing how the elder daughter was scared stiff by a worm, Qiao Dongliang began to doubt her words.\u201cI\u2026 I am just a little scared of worms.\u201d Qiao Zijin knew Qiao Dongliang\u2019s temper. She would not admit that she had never done any household chores before.She was worried that If she admitted that she had never done any household chores, Qiao Dongliang might want her to help out whenever she was at home.She did not want to be like Qiao Nan, treated like a servant and made to do so many chores.\u201cHurry up, Zijin, Nan Nan has already done all her chores and has started her school work. Tonight you shall sleep alone, have a good rest, you still have to go to school tomorrow.\u201dQiao Nan woke up early in the morning, about the same time as Qiao Dongliang. But by the time Qiao Dongliang left for work, Qiao Zijin was still sleeping.Qiao Nan told Qiao Dongliang that last night Qiao Zijin had been chatting with her for the whole night. She might not have slept well, hence she slept in today.Forget about yesterday. Qiao Zijin had to go to school tomorrow. Qiao Dongliang would not allow her to sleep that late anymore.If Qiao Zijin was to develop the habit of sleeping late at night, she would not have enough sleep at night, but had to wake up early in the morning. How would she be able to study well?Qiao Zijin who was washing the vegetables almost plucked out the core of the vegetables.It must be Qiao Nan\u2019s doing!If not judging from her father\u2019s character, he would be more than happy to see the two sisters spend time together. He would not have had any objections at all.\u201cAlright, Dad.\u201d Qiao Zijin had wasted a night on Qiao Nan and yet she still could not get hold of her money. Exams would be coming in two weeks\u2019 time and National Day would be just round the corner. Qiao Zijin eyes reddened. She was all tensed up and filled with anxiety.Why were things not going smoothly?Now Qiao Zijin knew that Qiao Nan was a miser, she would not lend her any money at all. Qiao Nan would not budge no matter what she did. Qiao Zijin finally gave up on getting money from Qiao Nan.\u201cQiao Nan, you are so heartless. We are biological sisters. Since a young age, we played together and I have always protected you. Now when I need your help, you refused to help me. I have seen through you. I shouldn\u2019t have treated you so nicely. From now onwards, I won\u2019t be good to you anymore.\u201d Qiao Zijin snorted.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You can be nicer to yourself. I will also treat myself well.\u201d Qiao Nan smiled, a genuine smile.\u201cDon\u2019t be too happy about it, we shall wait and see.\u201d She believed that one day Qiao Nan would come begging to her.When the time came, she would let Qiao Nan have a taste of her own medicine.Qiao Nan paid no attention to Qiao Zijin\u2019s provocation. She went back to her room and revised the day\u2019s lessons.On the next day, by the time Qiao Zijin woke up, Qiao Nan was already gone. Qiao Zijin left for school before Qiao Nan was back.Qiao Zijin got on the bus and was still fuming mad at Qiao Nan. Was she guarding against her as if she was a thief? She had no idea where Qiao Nan had hidden the money. It was nowhere to be found.She had to come up with another way to get her dance costume.The atmosphere in the her class was odd when Qiao Nan went to school on Monday.Zhu Baoguo had been under observation in the hospital for a week. He did not have other serious injuries and could go back home to rest. He had hurt his rib bones and would need plenty of rest. Even if he was discharged from hospital, it would be best to stay in bed to rest in the first month.As for the school, he applied for as much sick leave as possible so as to have a full recovery.Lots of people crowded around when Zhu Baoguo went back home on Sunday.It was only then that the people from the quad found out that Zhu Baoguo had been beaten up by a group of thugs on the side road on Monday. It was all thanks to the younger daughter of the Qiao family who chanced upon him and asked for help that he was saved in the nick of time. Otherwise, he might not be alive.Everyone had a big shock when they heard the news. The hooligans nowadays were so ruthless, they had almost taken a life?The residents of the quad and the surrounding areas all knew about this.Everyone had children. Moreover, after the national planning policy was launched, for the families who only had one child, be it son or daughter, they all treated their child as their precious jewel.If something similar happened to their child, it would really harm everyone in the family.Therefore, every family was very uptight when they heard of the news.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhu Baoguo was beaten by a bunch of hooligans, and if not for the younger daughter of Qiao family, he would have died.For others, they would think that the younger daughter of the Qiao family was really kind hearted, and was brave enough to help Zhu Baoguo. But for some people, this rumor was bad news.Zhao Yu had cooped herself up in her room since Sunday. She did not wish to go out, and she had enough of her mother\u2019s nagging.\u201cZhao Yu, did you hear that? In the future, do not come home by yourself, walk home with your classmates. Also, if you chance upon such incidents, don\u2019t try to be meddlesome and stay away. That young lady must count her lucky stars, if the hooligans went after her as well, the two of them might have died there.\u201dHer mother kept nagging, she was frightened out of her wits.\u201cMom, that\u2019s enough. I understand.\u201d Zhao Yu rolled her eyes. Not everyone would chance upon incidents like this.So it seemed that Qiao Nan ran into the small road to save Zhu Baoguo?It occurred to Zhao Yu that Qiao Nan was not alone at that time, there were two adults with her.But how would she know that Zhu Baoguo was beaten up by hooligans and that Qiao Nan had gone to seek help to save Zhu Baoguo.If she had known earlier, she would not have let Qiao Nan take all the credit. The person that Qiao Nan saved was none other than Zhu Baoguo!Zhao Yu had not grown up in the quad, but her house was not too far away.As a result, she knew that the children of the quad were the envy of others.Among all the male students in class, the person that Zhao Yu wanted to get close to was Zhu Baoguo. Although his results was not as good as her desk mate Zhou Lei, Zhu Baoguo was actually much more good looking than Zhou Lei.Zhao Yu might still be young, but she knew that it did not matter that Zhou Lei\u2019s results were way better than Zhu Baoguo\u2019s.Because in terms of future prospects, no matter how smart or hardworking Zhou Lei was, he would never be able to compare to the good prospects that Zhu Baoguo had.Zhou Lei could be a good boyfriend, but Zhu Baoguo was good husband material.But in the two years of junior high school, Zhu Baoguo never went to the school. Even if Zhao Yu who was mature for her age had wanted to create a favorable position to get closer to him, to be in his good books and if possible become his childhood sweetheart, there was no way for her dreams to materialize as he never went to school.Zhao Yu would never have thought that she would miss the one and only opportunity.If she had followed Qiao Nan on that day and discovered Zhu Baoguo at the same time as Qiao Nan, she would not have walked off. Instead she would have joined Qiao Nan to save him.If so, she would be Zhu Baoguo\u2019s life savior.Even if she could not have any sort of relationship with Zhu Baoguo, now that the Zhu family owed the Zhao family a debt of gratitude, her parents would be able to ask them for help if they met with any difficulties in their jobs.Such a good opportunity had just slipped away from her fingers. Zhao Yu who had motives towards Zhu Baoguo found it such a pity. As for Qiao Nan, her hatred for her grew even deeper now.To Zhao Yu, if not for Qiao Nan, she would be the one who saved Zhu Baoguo. Qiao Nan had taken the credit for it. But it should be hers in the first place.The news that Zhu Baoguo was injured spread rapidly, so did the fact that it was the younger daughter of Qiao family who had saved his life.When Qiao Nan arrived at school, many students knew that the rumor was not true. Qiao Nan did not hang out with those hooligans.\u201cQiao Nan, everyone now know that it was a misunderstanding. Congratulations, you have been cleared of all suspicion.\u201d Zhao Yu shot a smile at Qiao Nan.Zhao Yu\u2019s words made Qiao Nan felt uncomfortable and displeased. What did she mean by cleared of all suspicion? She was innocent all along, that rumor was fictitious. There was no eyewitness or material witness. How could she be labeled as a suspect?\u201cZhao Yu, regardless of the reasons behind your dislike for me, the feeling is mutual. Just stay away from me in the future, and mind your own business. If you use the cynical tone with me in future again, I won\u2019t be so polite anymore.\u201dQiao Nan looked at Zhao Yu and told her in a very stern expression.Zhao Yu was a spoiled brat. Qiao Nan was the same age as her. There was no reason that she had to give in to her once and again.\u201cMoreover, If I wanted to check, I would be able to find out who started that rumor. Zhao Yu, do you understand my words? I am sure the teachers do not like students who start rumors and create troubles, especially one who does not pay attention to her studies but comes up with ways to frame her classmates. Zhao Yu, do you agree with me?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 What do you mean?\u201d\u201cWhat do I mean? You have to figure it out by yourself. But I won\u2019t allow this kind of incident to happen again. If there\u2019s a next time, I will make sure to get to the bottom of the matter. I have to let Teacher Chen know of the black sheep in our class, who created troubles and affected our relationship.\u201dQiao Nan had purely made a guess when she said those words.When the rumors started to spread, Zhao Yu was the only one who seemed to be very happy, and she could come up with vivid and realistic accounts.Besides, whenever she brought up her suspicions, Zhao Yu would have a guilty look on her face.What Qiao Nan said just now was just to bluff her. But Zhao Yu turned red with fear.\u201cY-you are talking rubbish. I-I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Zhao Yu was so scared that she started to stutter. She took out her essay book and buried her head behind the book. \u201cI won\u2019t waste time on you, I am going to read my book, don\u2019t disturb me.\u201dIt was Zhao Yu who came looking for Qiao Nan, yet now she said that Qiao Nan was disturbing her from reading her book.Zhao Yu was in the wrong yet she put the blame on Qiao Nan. Qiao Nan could not be bothered with her. After all, she had brought the main point across just now.\u201cHa, made a fool of yourself?\u201d Zhou Lei sneered, his smile was full of sarcasm. When bad rumors about Qiao Nan started going around last week, Zhao Yu was the only one in class who carried on spreading the tales around.Secondary three (1) class used to be the best class in school. This incident almost affected the reputation of the class.Zhou Lei had no liking towards people like Zhao Yu, who were not united and did not work as a group.Today was Monday. There would be a flag-raising ceremony.Previously Teacher Chen was still agonizing over ways to clear up the rumor regarding Qiao Nan. After Zhu Baoguo\u2019s incident came to light, Teacher Chen was no longer worried.Teacher Chen had discussed with the school\u2019s management. They have decided that during the flag-raising ceremony today, Qiao Nan would make a speech for acting heroically in a just cause.Teacher Chen had already prepared the speech and had passed it to Qiao Nan. She only had to read it accordingly.Qiao Nan stood onto the stage, all the students and teachers fixed their gazes on her. She faced them with confidence and ease. She had no stage fright at all. She read the speech that Teacher Chen prepared in a calm and steady voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was no one who did not know her.Even when she went to the canteen to have lunch, a male student from secondary two stopped in front of her, said \u201csorry\u201d, and ran off with a red face. Qiao Nan found it ridiculous.Zhao Yu was fuming with anger. Wherever Qiao Nan went, everyone knew her name. It was as if she was a superstar at school.There was nothing to be smug about. Her results had deteriorated so badly and yet she had the time to be concerned about other matters.As a student, what was important was one\u2019s results. Just like the mock exams last time, she would continue to surpass Qiao Nan in the mid-term exams which would be coming in a month\u2019s time.The reasons why all the teachers were nice to Qiao Nan was only because she had good results.As long as she continued to do better than Qiao Nan, the teachers would surely favor her and dislike Qiao Nan.\u201cZhao Yu, hurry up, if not no dishes will be left.\u201d Zhao Yu\u2019s good friend pulled her ahead. \u201cWhy are you standing here in a daze, what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d\u201cNothing much. Mid-term exams will be coming in a month\u2019s time. I have to do well for the exams.\u201d\u201cYou have always been doing well, ranking in the top five in class. If Qiao Nan makes a blunder like before and you work harder, you might be in the top three.\u201d The words of encouragement and concern from her friend did not comfort her at all. In fact, she was offended by them.\u201cHmph, Qiao Nan did not do well last time. I don\u2019t believe that it was just a blunder. That was lagging behind. If not, how could one make such a big blunder? It\u2019s easy to lag behind, but it would not be that easy to catch up. Let\u2019s wait and see, I will definitely do better than Qiao Nan!\u201dWithout waiting for her friend\u2019s response, Zhao Yu walked off in anger.Her friend paused momentarily and grunted, \u201cWhat have I done to anger her? She must be sick. I am tired of coaxing her, I won\u2019t do it anymore!\u201dQiao Nan who was absorbed in her studies had no idea what was happening. But Zhao Yu was determined to fight it out with her.Even if she did know it, she would not give it much thought.As long as Zhao Yu kept her distance and stopped blabbering, she did not care if she saw her as a target and used all sorts of methods to study.In this lifetime, Qiao Nan finally managed to secure her chance to study and was making progress according to the designated routine. But things were different for Qiao Zijin.After pooling all her money and borrowing from her friends, she had barely managed to gather enough money for her costume.She had settled the issue of the dress costume. But she had no idea what to do with her monthly exams.When she came back home after two weeks, gone was the troubled countenance. Instead she was all smiles, a joyful expression on her face.\u201cMom.\u201d\u201cZijin, you are back.\u201d Ding Jiayi who just came back from work was tired to the bone. But she beamed in joy when she saw her beloved elder daughter. \u201cAre you drained from all the studying these two weeks?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Qiao Zijin lifted her chin and said proudly, \u201cMom, we had school exams last week. It\u2019s called monthly exam. Just like the mid-term exams, it\u2019s very important.\u201d\u201cIs that so, how were your results?\u201d This was the first time the elder daughter talked about her results of her own accord. All her tiredness seemed to have vanished, Ding Jiayi was in high spirits now.\u201cMom, I was ranked in the eighth place in class. It\u2019s the eighth place. I would be able to do better in my exams next time.\u201d\u201cThe eighth place, such a good result?!\u201d Ding Jiayi had the intuition that there would be good news today. But she did not know that it would be such a wonderful piece of news.The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China was a good high school. People who enrolled in to the school were all very smart and good in their results.Her daughter could come in eighth place in such a good school among all the outstanding students. This was really a tremendous improvement.As expected, she had spent the money well. Zijin\u2019s results improved by leaps after enrolling in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. The teachers at the school must have adopted excellent teaching methods!Ding Jiayi did not realize that the fact that Zijin could spend money to enroll into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, the school might have other students, who like Zijin, did not do well in their exams but had the money to enroll themselves into the school.Hence, the eighth place that Qiao Zijin had might not be the eighth place among the good students.Naturally, Qiao Zijin would not provide these details to Ding Jiayi. She only had to say that she was ranked eighth place.\u201cZijin.\u201d Ding Jiayi pulled her elder daughter to the kitchen, took five yuan from her pocket and gave it to her daughter. \u201cYou have worked hard, take this money and buy some good food to treat yourself. Don\u2019t shortchange yourself. Later you can get some more money from your Dad, understand?\u201d\u201cAlright, Mom. You are so good to me. When I am successful, I will definitely be filial and treat you well!\u201d Qiao Zijin was elated at the five yuan in her hands.When Qiao Dongliang was back from his work, Qiao Zijin told him the good news that she came in eighth place in her exams. As expected, Qiao Dongliang was all smiles and he gave seven yuan to Qiao Zijin.Both Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi rewarded Qiao Zijin with money. The money added up to twelve yuan.She remembered that Qiao Nan had only taken ten yuan from Qiao Dongliang last time. She could not help but smile that she had two more yuan than Qiao Nan.She had said all along, she was the most important person in the family. Qiao Nan could not match up to her.When her father had forgiven her, he would definitely treat her a million times better than Qiao Nan. After all, it had always been this way.\u201cZijin, have more of the food.\u201d During dinnertime, Ding Jiayi could finally favored Qiao Zijin openly. She put almost all of the meat and fish dishes in Qiao Zijin\u2019s bowl, not leaving a single piece for Qiao Nan.\u201cOld Qiao, did you see? Everything that I have done was for the good of Zijin and the family. The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China was such a good school. Their teachers are very capable. It was not a bluff. Of course, most importantly, Zijin is very smart. She had never ranked eighth in the past. Moreover the students at the school are very outstanding and brilliant. It was not easy for Zijin to rank eighth in class. Look, Zijin has grown thinner, she must be tired from the studying and revision. Old Qiao, I won\u2019t admit it if you insist that I am biased towards Zijin. As compared to lagging behind in the studies, Zi JIn has made such a big improvement, this is what we call a good and positive learning attitude.\u201dDing Jiayi was full of praise for Qiao Zijin. But she did not forget to pour cold water on Qiao Nan.Even if she knew that there was no way that she could have made Qiao Nan quit school and start working, it would be good to pressurize her and make her suffer.Most importantly, she had to make Old Qiao understand that Zijin was the smart daughter in the family. She was the only one who had good future prospects.Even if she spent all the money at home, as long as Zijin made improvements in her studies, it would be all worthwhile. She was not self-assertive, everything that she did was for the family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But if spending all the money would ensure that the elder daughter would catch up on her studies, Qiao Dongliang would naturally be happy.No amount of money could buy a child\u2019s future. The money spent might be all worthwhile.\u201cZijin is good. Nan Nan is not bad as well. Both of my daughters are good. Zijin, bear this in mind, continue to keep up the good work, don\u2019t be overly proud of your results.\u201d Qiao Dongliang was not like Ding Jiayi, who praised Qiao Zijin without forgetting to put down Qiao Nan.But when he heard that Qiao Zijin had made such a tremendous improvement, he was grinning from ear to ear.\u201cDad, don\u2019t worry. I will put in more effort to maintain my results and to strive for better grades.\u201d She was overwhelmed to have the recognition of both her father and mother for doing well in her studies.The atmosphere was really good, to the extent that she almost forgot the truth behind her eighth place in the class. She was placed eighth in her class, but ranked poorly in her overall ranking in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.Qiao Zijin straightened her back, a look of confidence on her face. As expected, as long as she set her sights on it, there wasn\u2019t anything in this world that she would not have.It was alright if Qiao Nan refused to help her. She bought her dance costume and the performance was a success. She also came in eighth in her exams.\u201cThat\u2019s right. There\u2019s still room for improvement for Zijin. As for Qiao Nan, it\u2019s not that I as her Mom wanted to put her down. It does not matter if she did well in junior high school. She had to do well in her middle school exams to be able to enroll in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. Anyway, she should be clear about the situation at home. If she wanted to enroll in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, she would have to rely on herself. We cannot possibly spend all our savings for her again. I have no objections that she wanted to continue her studies. But we cannot afford to have external debts. When she enrols in high school, she would have to be responsible for her own studies.\u201dDing Jiayi had no qualms about insulting Qiao Nan. She felt that it was of no use for Qiao Nan to do well in junior high school. It was more important to be able to do well in high school.Everyone in the family knew that she had spent all the savings to enroll the elder daughter to The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.Ding Jiayi was worried that if Qiao Nan did not do well in a year\u2019s time, and she barely missed the cut off point for enrollment, out of fairness, her husband might resort to borrowing money from outside in order to enroll Qiao Nan into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.Other people might not do it, but there was a possibility that Qiao Dongliang would.It did not make sense that they could do so for Qiao Zijin, yet they would have to shortchange Qiao Nan and deprive her of the chance.Ding Jiayi wanted to give a forewarning to Qiao Dongliang and Qiao Nan.Qiao Dongliang hesitated for a moment. He really could not come up with a good solution for this problem.Although Ding Jiayi had started to work, he harbored no hopes that she would earn lots of money. Her pay might be able to cover part of the daily expenses of the two daughters. But he would still have to provide for their school fees.In the past, he had never dreamed that the elder daughter would do well in her exams. Now that she had made improvements, if she could maintain the standard, she would be able to make it into college.The school fees for junior high school and high school were not as expensive. It was easy to provide for his daughters. But if the two of them made it into college, they might not have enough money to support them.What if Nan Nan did not do well for middle school exams and barely missed the cut off point to enroll into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China?They had depleted all their savings to enroll Zijin into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. If Nan Nan wanted to enroll in that high school, should he agree or not? If he disagree, would Nan Nan blame him for being biased?Qiao Dongliang wanted to treat his two daughters equally, but there wasn\u2019t much money at home.Though Qiao Dongliang did not pour cold water on Qiao Nan, he agreed with what Ding Jiayi said.As they advanced in their studies, it would get more and more difficult. It was simple feat for Qiao Nan to have good results in junior high school since the syllabus was relatively easy. But it would be amazing if one continued to do well in high school.The elder daughter had good prospects, he had to provide for her school fees. But what about the younger daughter?Qiao Dongliang was stumped for words because of the problems with money. He remained silent for a long while.The atmosphere stilled because of Ding Jiayi\u2019s comments. Qiao Nan finished her rice in silence, put down her bowl and said calmly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dad. I know my limitations and abilities. I wouldn\u2019t aim for something unachievable. I wanted to study. I give you my promise, when it\u2019s time for middle school exams, I would enroll in whichever school that my results can take me. I won\u2019t make things difficult for you. Regarding sister\u2019s enrollment in the high school, I won\u2019t take it to heart and won\u2019t say that you are biased towards her. I am content as long as I can continue to study.\u201dShe had mentioned this long ago, her father was biased as well, it was just that he was not as biased as her mother. Moreover, Qiao Zijin\u2019s results seemed pretty good this time.But she remembered that in her previous lifetime Qiao Zijin always did badly in her exams. With that she smirked and shot a meaningful glance at Qiao Zijin.In her previous lifetime, apart from fooling around and being good at networking, Qiao Zijin was not someone who was good at her studies.Only Qiao Zijin knew the actual value behind her results (the eighth place in the class) this time.\u201cBy the way, sister, it has been a month since school reopened. I still didn\u2019t know which class you are at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.\u201d\u201cHigh school year one (8).\u201d\u201cThe High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China has a total of eight classes, is that right? You are in High school year one (8)?\u201d\u201cYes, there are eight classes in total. What does it matter? We are divided into the classes randomly.\u201d Qiao Zijin had no idea why Qiao Nan had so many questions but could not help but explain in detail, not knowing that her explanation in fact revealed what she was hiding.\u201cRandomly?\u201d Qiao Nan arched her eyebrows and smiled. She was not as gullible as her parents.Everyone who knew about the background of The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China would know that there was a special class in the high school. It was to take in people like Qiao Zijin.To put it bluntly, no one in Qiao Zijin\u2019s class was studious. It was not surprising that she came in eighth in her class.\u201cNan Nan, aren\u2019t you going to do some revision? Time is precious, you better start your revision now.\u201dIn the past, Qiao Zijin hated it when Qiao Nan did her studying and would find ways to disturb her. But not today.It had been years since Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi had graduated from school. They would think that it was considered good to have come in eighth in class. But Qiao Zijin looked guilty in front of Qiao Nan.She was worried that if Qiao Nan was to probe, the image of the good daughter and good student that she portrayed would shatter to pieces.\u201cWhat about the bowl?\u201d Qiao Nan smirked. At least Qiao Zijin knew her own limits and stopped bragging about it. If she continued to boast about it, the cat might just slip out of the bag.After another two and a half years Qiao Zijin would need to sit for college entrance exams. She could not imagine the expression on her parents\u2019 faces, when they, who had always thought that their daughter was the top student in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, discovered that she had done badly in her exams.\u201cI\u2014I will wash the bowl. Nan Nan, hurry along to do your schoolwork.\u201d In order to shut her up, Qiao Zijin volunteered to help with the chores that Qiao Nan was supposed to do.\u201cYou do not need to do the washing, I will wash them. You can go to do your schoolwork as well.\u201d Ding Jiayi was still on cloud nine at the elder daughter\u2019s improvement. It would be good if she could devote all her time in her studies and target to do well for her next exams and do her proud.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will keep my promise.\u201d\u201cOld Qiao, you heard Qiao Nan\u2019s words. So, don\u2019t work so hard and cause your health to suffer because of money. Zijin\u2019s grades have improved, in future, she will study in College and our expenses will increase. Health is the source of revolution and wealth. Don\u2019t be rushed when it comes to earning money.\u201dDing Jiayi was worried that, in order to support the two daughters\u2019 studies and to prevent Qiao Zijin\u2019s situation from happening to Qiao Nan, Qiao Dongliang would take up side jobs to save more money.From Ding Jiayi\u2019s perspective, Qiao Dongliang\u2019s attempts to save were futile.All their savings over the years were gone, and she was the one who had asked Uncle Lee to pull the strings to enable Zijin to enter The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.If Old Qiao started to take up side jobs now, regardless of the number of jobs, would he be able to save up the ten years\u2019 savings in just one year?Impossible!The elder daughter was Ding Jiayi\u2019s biological daughter, Ding Jiayi doted on her.Qiao Dongliang was Ding Jiayi\u2019s man, Ding Jiayi also loved him and was afraid that he would work too hard and tire himself out.To Ding Jiayi, only Qiao Nan, who was always suspicious and guarded, was like an outsider in this family.\u201cNan Nan, have you really thought about it carefully?\u201d Qiao Dongliang did not know whether to be happy or guilty about his younger daughter\u2019s sensible character.He had always said that he would treat both daughters the same \u2013 equally well.The family had spent 5000 yuan for Zijin to attend The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, why would the younger daughter be an exception?But if there was a need to bear another 5000 yuan, Qiao Dongliang knew that he was not capable of affording it. He would not be able to come up with the 5000 yuan within such a short span of time even if he sacrificed his life.The more Qiao Dongliang thought about it, the more complicated and confused he felt. He could not stand and face his younger daughter with pride.\u201cYes, I have thought about it. You will look at the results of my middle school examination. I have said that the results will determine which school I go to, I will not regret it.\u201d In this life, it was good to be able to continue her studies. As for other matters, she dared not expect too much, she further dared not expect her parents to give her the same treatment as Qiao Zijin.It did not matter if her parents were biased towards Qiao Zijin. She would favor and love herself more.Qiao Nan, who had her own plan in mind, clearly knew that there was an issue with Qiao Zijin\u2019s ranking in the eighth place. But she did not mention it in front of Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi.If she raised this up, her mother would certainly assumed that she had intentionally woven this lie as she was unhappy and jealous of Qiao Zijin. Her father would also believe this.This type of difficult and thankless matter, she would never do it again in this life.It was still the same saying, Qiao Zijin could create a din as she wished as long as she did not cause trouble before her, she and Qiao Zijin would not interfere with each other. \u201cDad, I\u2019ll go and do my homework.\u201dTo help Qiao Nan strengthen her knowledge and foundation for the past two years, her teachers were very conscientious in retrieving the past years\u2019 examination papers, selecting questions and collating them into test papers for Qiao Nan to complete.So, the test papers and homework on Qiao Nan\u2019s hands were twice as much as that of her classmates.\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Qiao Dongliang, who felt guilty towards Qiao Nan, nodded. After Qiao Nan left, Qiao Dongliang said to Ding Jiayi, \u201cYou also said it just now. I will take care of Nan Nan\u2019s matters, you don\u2019t need to worry about them. In future, if Zijin performs well and you want to praise her, I will not object. But if you use Nan Nan as a raft to stay afloat again, I will not be happy about it. Both are your daughters, even if Nan Nan is only in junior high school now and the curriculum is not as difficult as Zijin, it doesn\u2019t mean that her good grades do not matter. What was said today, I don\u2019t wish to hear it a second time.\u201dQiao Dongliang, who felt guilty, simply gave Ding Jiayi a scolding to lessen the negative feelings in his heart.He thought that he was helping Qiao Nan to seek justice, but he did not know that the more he said this, the more Ding Jiayi hated Qiao Nan and could not see eye to eye with her.\u201cI know. All of you are masters, leaving your dishes on the table after dinner. After a long day of work, I still have to do all the housework. Fine.\u201d Ding Jiayi felt this was unfair.But no matter what, Qiao Nan was finally willing to agree.\u201cMom, I help you to bring them over?\u201d Qiao Zijin stood up and wanted to help Ding Jiayi serve the rice.Ding Jiayi pushed Qiao Zijin away. \u201cNo, quickly, go and do your homework.\u201dHaving said that, Ding Jiayi gave a purposeful glance towards the entrance of Qiao Nan\u2019s bedroom, hinting to Qiao Zijin that she should not be overturned by Qiao Nan again.Qiao Nan was so conscientious. Qiao Zijin had to be even more so.\u201cMom, then I shall go and do my homework.\u201d Qiao Zijin did not really want to do the household chores. The bowls were oily. She did not mind when she was eating with them. But when it came to washing, Qiao Zijin disliked the oily feel in her hands.\u201cGo.\u201dAfter both children had returned to their rooms to do homework and Ding Jiayi was also busy with the housework, Qiao Dongliang, who suddenly had nothing to do, felt a little confused. He did not know if what he had done earlier was right.Such a biased approach, did Nan Nan really accept it wholeheartedly without any feelings of unhappiness?Qiao Dongliang stood up and walked to the entrance of Qiao Nan\u2019s room. He raised his hands and wanted to knock on Qiao Nan\u2019s door but did not do so after a long time.This was because Qiao Dongliang did not know what to say to Qiao Nan. Should he say that he treated her and Qiao Zijin equally well and was not biased?These words, Qiao Dongliang did not have the guts to say.After a long time, Qiao Dongliang gave up and gave a sigh. He returned to his own room.Qiao Nan, who was holding a pen but did not write a single word, heard the sigh and footsteps. She also gave a sigh.Clearly both were biological sisters but they were treated as though one was not. It was not that she did not feel sad or wronged.It was just that she had been too used to the suffering and hurt. Her heart was already numb.If you lean against a hill, it will collapse. If you lean against a person, he will run away. Relying on yourself is the most reliable option in this world.At this thought, Qiao Nan perked up and did her test papers. At the very least, she was not abandoned by all the people in the world. The teachers were very good to her and had high hopes for her.Qiao Nan hoped that she could deliver good grades, to the best of her ability, during the middle school examinations.It might be because of Qiao Zijin\u2019s good grades that the Qiao family was very peaceful this weekend. Ding Jiayi was in a good mood so she did not find find fault with Qiao Nan. Anyway, Qiao Nan had already promised that she would not use more of the family\u2019s money.Compared with having to let Qiao Nan work to make money, Ding Jiayi now had only one thought in mind, that is, she hoped that Qiao Nan would use less of the family\u2019s money. This was good enough.Monday came. When Qiao Nan carried her school bag to school, not long after she sat down, the long empty seat beside her was suddenly occupied by a handicapped person.\u201cHey, you are the Qiao\u2019s family\u2019s Xiao Qiao, are you the one who saved me that day?\u201d The person next to her asked impatiently with a draggy tone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He said in a flippant tone, \u201cNot bad looking. It\u2019s not wrong to call you Xiao Qiao. I have not seen any pretty girls in the Eastern Han Dynasty, but I guessed this Xiao Qiao is passable as one.\u201dHearing that Zhu Baoguo sounded like a hooligan, Qiao Nan pursed the corners of her mouth while sizing up her deskmate.When she looked at Zhu Baoguo, he was opening his eyes uneasily and unable to look her straight in the eye. Most importantly, Zhu Baoguo\u2019s ears actually turned red. Qiao Nan finally understood. The reason that Zhu Baoguo had been saying all this was because he wanted to apologize to her?\u201cIf you are really grateful to me, don\u2019t need to talk so much nonsense. Actually, saying the two words \u201cThank You\u201d is more than enough.\u201d\u201cYou said I was talking nonsense earlier?\u201d Zhu Baoguo stared at her. He was commending her for her good looks just now.In the past, numerous ladies yearned for his praise and he could not even be bothered to glance at them more. Today, his praise had been shunned.\u201cYes, nonsense.\u201d Qiao Nan nodded without giving any face. \u201cNow is the time for early revision, I need to read my books. Whether you are reading or not, I don\u2019t care and can\u2019t control but I hope that you won\u2019t disturb my reading.\u201dBased on her experience in the previous life, Qiao Nan do not wish to get involved with a person like Zhu Baoguo.In those days when she was having a relationship with Chen Jun, Qiao Zijin found out about his family background. Each time she had a date with Chen Jun, Qiao Zijin wanted to tag along. When she did not feel like going, Qiao Zijin even took the initiative to help her arrange the date. Of course, Qiao Zijin would be there as well.In the end, Chen Jun was probably wavered by Qiao Zijin. Qiao Zijin tried to create trouble for her before the date so that she could not turn up, and then she would attend the date on her behalf.Nevertheless, Qiao Zijin was still young now, she had not reached that stage with Zhu Baoguo.But with Qiao Zijin\u2019s stubborn character, she was afraid that the same situation as with Chen Jun would happen again.It was Qiao Zijin\u2019s own issue that she could not pull Zhu Baoguo on her side. Anyway, Qiao Nan would never agree to act as the bridge for her.Having thought clearly about this, Qiao Nan wanted to stay away from Zhu Baoguo.Furthermore, in her opinion, Zhu Baoguo was always absent from class, she was not close to him anyway. Who would have thought that he would attend class today? It was an uncertainty as to whether he would continue to come to class.For the first time in his life, Zhu Baoguo was shunned badly by a girl, he could only wrinkled his eyebrows and watch as he saw this thin and fair pretty lady ignoring him and taking out a book to read.Zhu Baoguo was very unhappy. He snatched the book from Qiao Nan\u2019s hands and blocked Qiao Nan\u2019s view with his face. \u201cIs the book better looking than me?\u201dLooking at the face in front of her which had been magnified many times, Qiao Nan rolled her eyes. \u201cIf I look at your face, my future will be bleak. But if I read the books, I can work hard for my own future.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense, I am only asking you, is my face better looking than the book?\u201d Zhu Baoguo frowned. He did not really like Qiao Nan\u2019s comments.\u201cThe book is better looking.\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d\u201cShameless.\u201d Zhao Yu, who was seated beside them, saw this and was at the top of her anger.Having known Zhu Baoguo for so long, she had never seen him so close to any girls. What was the meaning of this. Did Zhu Baoguo like Qiao Nan and wanted to pursue her to be his girlfriend?\u201cHave you heard it, she said you are shameless. So, can I trouble you to keep quiet?\u201d Qiao Nan looked indifferent as she shifted Zhao Yu\u2019s target of hostility to Zhu Baoguo.\u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201d Zhu Baoguo slammed the table and created a big commotion in the classroom. His pair of round eyes opened widely and stared like the eyes of a tiger, scaring everyone. \u201cWho are you scolding?!\u201dZhao Yu shivered and stuttered. \u201cI I I, I didn\u2019t scold you.\u201d\u201cThen who are you scolding!\u201d\u201cI I, I was scolding her for being shameless!\u201d Zhao Yu pointed her fingers at Qiao Nan clumsily.Zhao Yu thought that Zhu Baoguo would be happy to hear that she was scolding Qiao Nan as Qiao Nan had angered him with her earlier words.However, this time, Zhao Yu had guessed wrongly. Zhu Baoguo sneered. \u201cWhat are you, are you fit to scold her, why is she shameless?\u201d\u201cZhao Yu, are you still going to say that Qiao Nan was in the bad company of the hooligans, and had indecent relationships with them?\u201d Zhou Lei stared at Zhao Yu as if she was crazy. He did not think that Qiao Nan was shameless.\u201cYou, all of you are helping her and bullying me! Zhou Lei, how many times have this been? Do you like Qiao Nan, that\u2019s why you have been helping her to chide me? If you are capable, tell Teacher Chen to allow me to change seats with Qiao Nan. Then you can sit together with your loved one Qiao Nan!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Zhou Lei gave a stare, like a leopard that was furious. Zhao Yu was again frightened. \u201cZhao Yu, do you want a beating? The previous rumors about Qiao Nan \u2013 do you think no one knows how they came about? You\u2019re just jealous that she scored better than you in the exams and purposely weaved such lies to hurt Qiao Nan. And when we know to differentiate right from wrong, it means to you that we are biased towards and like Qiao Nan. Zhao Yu, do you have a problem with your brain? Do you believe that I will tell Teacher Chen? You keep thinking about this everyday and did not concentrate on your studies, no wonder you can\u2019t score better than Qiao Nan.\u201d\u201cYou, you\u2019re talking nonsense. \u201d Of course Zhao Yu would not admit that the rumors started from her, especially in front of Zhu Baoguo. \u201cDo you dare to tell Teacher Chen, Zhou Lei? You\u2019re still into this game when you\u2019re already out of kindergarten, aren\u2019t you childish?\u201d\u201cAs long as this is an effective way, I don\u2019t care if it is childish. Zhao Yu, if you continue to provoke me, don\u2019t blame me for being nasty.\u201dThe usually bright and cheerful Zhou Lei was in such a huge temper that he scolded Zhao Yu straight without any hesitation.16, 17 years old was a sensitive age. When he heard that Zhao Yu said he liked Qiao Nan in front of so many people in class, Zhou Lei really wanted to beat Zhao Yu up.\u201cBut you said something right. This seat should indeed be changed. If I continue to sit at the same table as you, I am unlucky.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, what is going on, why is there another hooligan? Xiao Qiao, is anyone bullying you. Tell brother, brother will support you.\u201d Zhu Baoguo changed his stand and called himself Qiao Nan\u2019s brother, as if he looked upon Qiao Nan as his sister.\u201cI am warning all of you. Qiao Nan is my sister. If anyone dares make trouble for Qiao Nan again, that means you\u2019re not happy with me. Be careful on the roads then, make sure that you have someone accompanying you.\u201dWhen Zhu Baoguo said this, he deliberately started at Zhao Yu a few times. At one glance, he knew that there is nothing good about this woman.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if you do not wish to study, please do not disturb others.\u201d When she saw Zhu Baoguo, who was standing up with one of his legs on top of the chair, Qiao Nan rolled her eyes at Zhu Baoguo. \u201cPut your leg down.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m helping you!\u201d Zhu Baoguo was not pleased, he felt so unappreciated. \u201cDid you really save me that day?\u201dThe situation that day was so dangerous. That group of people who beat him up were completely furious and out of hand, whoever dared to meddle would have to be beaten up as well.Zhu Baoguo could not imagine how such a skinny and petite lady would be so courageous to care about the situation that day. She had even found someone to help out.Particularly, Qiao Nan\u2019s attitude today was really cold and unfriendly towards others. She was even more aloof than him.\u201cThe person I saved that day was covered in blood, I\u2019m not sure if that was you.\u201d Qiao Nan did not dispute. If not for someone who told her that Zhu Baoguo was the one being beaten up, she would not have known who it was.\u201cThen it\u2019s you. Thank you.\u201d After confirming that Qiao Nan was the one who saved him, Zhu Baoguo said a word of thanks awkwardly.\u201cAlright. Sit down, I want to read.\u201dSeeing that Qiao Nan was very cold to him, Zhu Baoguo felt that he was asking for it, he wanted to disturb Qiao Nan a little and trigger her temper. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this question, why don\u2019t you teach me?\u201dZhu Baoguo closed his eyes and pick up a book. He casually pointed to a question for Qiao Nan.\u201cSorry, I am learning too. If you do not understand, you can ask the teacher.\u201d\u201cI am injured. I\u2019m asking you because I don\u2019t want to walk.\u201d Zhu Baoguo shoved the book in front of Qiao Nan and insisted Qiao Nan guide him.Zhu Baoguo did not like to study. He was also unwilling to attend school. However, after this incident, the Zhu family was no longer as lenient and indulging towards Zhu Baoguo. Zhu Chengqi told Zhu Baoguo straight that if he continued to play truant in school and create trouble, he would rather kill Zhu Baoguo himself than to let others do it.Zhu Chengqi gave Zhu Baoguo two options. First, to attend school abidingly.As for his school results, Zhu Chengqi did not harbor any high hopes towards his son.Second, he would break Zhu Baoguo\u2019s pair of legs, if he did not behave properly and get himself into trouble. He might as well let him stay at home and take care of him for the rest of his life.The Lee Family had also changed their attitude towards Zhu Baoguo. Of course, they insisted that Zhu Baoguo had to return to school to continue with his studies. There would not be any other option.Elder Lee even gave his son-in-law, Zhu Chengqi, a bad scolding. Zhu Baoguo was the only son left by his daughter to Zhu Chengqi. Zhu Baoguo had gone astray under the care and teachings of Zhu Chengqi. Would Zhu Chengqi still be able to face his deceased daughter?With pressure from the elders of the two families and Zhu Chengqi\u2019s intimidation, Zhu Baoguo dared not play truant anymore. He could only come to school and sit around.If Zhu Baoguo, who was no longer used to schooling, did not find himself any fun, he could only laze around in his current seat.As such, Qiao Nan became the innocent sacrificial lamb targeted by Zhu Baoguo.Qiao Nan ignored him as she could hear that Zhu Baoguo was not really keen to learn. She continued to read her own books.She was not even afraid of Qiao Zijin, why would she be afraid of Zhu Baoguo?Who would know that Zhu Baoguo was really too bored. Qiao Nan ignored him, so he patted Qiao Nan\u2019s shoulder and nudged her. He even purposely made loud noises by opening his pencil box and moving his chair around.The whole classroom was full of the creaking and raucous sounds created by Zhu Baoguo. It was so noisy that everyone could not read their books but no one dared to chide Zhu Baoguo.Only Qiao Nan was not distracted and concentrated on reading her book. The rest could not do so.Qiao Nan pursed her lips and glared coldly at Zhu Baoguo with her shiny eyes. \u201cDo you have hemorrhoids on your butt, so you have to keep moving?\u201d\u201cPshh\u2026 \u201dMany students in the class heard Qiao Nan\u2019s words, they quickly covered their mouths with their hands to prevent laughing out loud.Zhu Baoguo\u2019s face turned red instantly, like a monkey\u2019s butt. \u201cWho did you say has hemorrhoids, there\u2019s nothing wrong with my butt!\u201d\u201cSince there is nothing wrong with your butt, then sit properly. If you have so much excess energy that you need to vent out, then go and run a few rounds in the field.\u201d\u201cYou, you?\u201d Zhu Baoguo was so angry. \u201cAre you a girl, you keep mentioning the word \u201cbutt\u201d in front of a male. Aren\u2019t you ashamed?\u201d\u201cYou see, I already told you she is shameless!\u201d Zhao Yu smiled and added to the conversation.\u201cDamn your mother, what has this got to do with you?\u201d Zhu Baoguo simply scolded Zhao Yu. It was up to him what he wanted to say. But who was this woman who dare to talk bad about Qiao Nan?\u201cYou deserved it.\u201d Zhou Lei sneered. Zhu Baoguo had a nasty temper. Zhou Lei did not hit girls but it did not mean that Zhu Baoguo would not do so.Qiao Nan had the guts to be so stubborn with Zhu Baoguo. If the other girls dared to be so bullish before him, they were asking to be beaten. Zhao Yu was foolish and asking for it. Her enthusiasm was met with cold shoulders.When Zhu Baoguo scolded Zhao Yu, he slammed the table and kicked the chair, displaying a strong and bad aura, as though a hooligan was making his grand entrance to the school.Many were troubled by his behavior. The class originally had a conducive atmosphere for studies. But when Zhu Baoguo came, the learning atmosphere was completely destroyed. It would be better if he had not come.Zhu Baoguo was not stupid. Also, as his mother was already not around since he was young, Zhu Baoguo\u2019s feelings were more sensitive than others.Initially, he threw a tantrum as he did not see eye to eye with Zhao Yu. But after he created a scene, the whole class disliked and shunned him. Zhu Baoguo was burning with anger inside, his eyes slightly red as if he was an annoyed bull. He straightened his neck and was preparing to leave the classroom.It did not matter if they disliked him. He did not like these classmates anyway. What was the big deal?Seeing that Zhu Baoguo had the intention to leave, most of them were relieved.Zhu Baoguo had just reached the podium, when Qiao Nan, who had been quite silent all this while, suddenly slammed her book hard on the table with a loud slam. \u201cIt\u2019s so early in the morning. Why are you creating a din? Come back!\u201dZhu Baoguo, who was leaving with big steps, was stunned by Qiao Nan\u2019s slam. He stood at the podium and looked at Qiao Nan.\u201cIt\u2019s the morning revision time now. If anyone dares to make noise, get out and stand as a punishment.\u201dThat slam by Qiao Nan, the rest of the class, not to mention Zhu Baoguo, was shocked. Astonished, everyone bowed their heads to carry on with their own stuff. No one dared to place their attention on Zhu Baoguo again.\u201cWhy are you standing there, do you want to sit next to the teacher during the lesson? If you are willing to, I can help you apply for permission from Teacher Chen! Qiao Nan started at Zhu Baoguo whilst raising her chin and pointed towards the seat beside her to signal to Zhu Baoguo to make a choice.\u201cWhy!\u201d After Zhu Baoguo regained his senses, he argued with Qiao Nan again. \u201cWhy should I listen to you?\u201dHe did not even listen to his father all the time. Why would he listen to a young lady who was smaller in build and physically weaker than him? That would be so spineless of him.\u201cWhy?\u201d Qiao Nan laughed. Her laugh gave Zhu Baoguo goose pimples. \u201cFine. Since you like that place, you can sit there in future. Let me help you shift the table. Rest assured, you will know why I said that after Teacher Chen arrives.\u201dZhu Baoguo did not know the situation as he did not come to the school to study.However, the rest of the students in the class knew clearly that although Qiao Nan was the Vice Class Monitor and not the Class Monitor, Qiao Nan\u2019s words were often better heard. Who asked her to be the teacher\u2019s pet?Most importantly, although Qiao Nan had the power and ability, she was not arrogant. Typically, she did not bother about the matters in class, neither would she abuse her powers to undermine others. She would only do whatever she needed to do.As such, it did not matter if Qiao Nan did not say a word. But once she said something, the students in the class were more willing to listen.Zhu Baoguo was the only rash fellow who dared to argue with Qiao Nan.When Zhu Baoguo saw that Qiao Nan was serious in shifting his table to the side of the podium, he was so scared that he hurriedly ran over to hold his table. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to arrange my seat. I sit wherever I like.\u201d\u201cThen are you still going to make noise?\u201d\u201cSince when did I do that!\u201d\u201cThen sit properly if you are not making noise. Stop making a fuss. If you are not willing to read then just sit and doze. You should know how to doze right. In short, don\u2019t cause disturbance to others. Do you understand?\u201dZhu Baoguo lay on his own table and gave a quiet snort. He indeed sat down and did not make strange noises to disturb others, like he did before.Zhu Baoguo was willing to cooperate, the rest of the students in the class had no issues then. The morning self-study time was finally over, but they did not know whether it would be the same tomorrow.When the school bell rang, Zhu Baoguo, who was lying on the table, bored and in a daze, came to his senses and thought of why he should listen to Qiao Nan.Even if Qiao Nan placed his seat elsewhere, he did not wish to study. How would that impact him?Just when Zhu Baoguo just wanted to throw a fit, a few pieces of white paper with questions written on it appeared before him. \u201cComplete these questions.\u201d\u201cWhy should I?\u201d\u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d Qiao Nan looked at Zhu Baoguo, half amused. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that Elder Lee did not tell you about it. When you are in the school, I am in charge of you.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to teach me earlier right?\u201d\u201cYou said it yourself. That was earlier. Do it for me now.\u201dQiao Nan did not want to change her mind. She did not want to meddle in Zhu Baoguo\u2019s affairs but Zhu Baoguo was really too stubborn. If she did not arrange something for him, he would always make trouble. At that time, Qiao Nan\u2019s studies would also be affected?Preciously when Elder Lee requested Qiao Nan to supervise Zhu Baoguo in his studies, Qiao Dongliang simply agreed in the face of Qiao Nan.If Qiao Nan were to completely leave her hands out of this matter, with Zhu Baoguo\u2019s temper, he would not abidingly stay in the school. If he left the school he would certainly get into trouble again. Qiao Nan would not be able to explain to Qiao Dongliang and Elder Lee then.Qiao Nan rubbed her forehead. Her father had really found her a very good job. She had not become a mother, yet, she had to teach and raise a son. How unfortunate!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRegarding Zhu Baoguo\u2019s situation, the Zhu family had already mentioned it to Teacher Chen. So, when Teacher Chen entered the classroom, he was not surprised to see Zhu Baoguo. He even said a few words to the students about this.Zhu Baoguo had not fully recovered from his injuries. The students in the class should take care of him more.Besides this, although Zhu Baoguo came to school, he would not participate in any lesson that required physical activities.Teacher Chen observed Zhu Baoguo for a lesson. He realized that Zhu Baoguo was seated in his own chair, writing and keeping quiet, he did not disturb others or Qiao Nan. Teacher Chen then felt much better.It was lunchtime. Qiao Nan stood up straight, looked at Zhu Baoguo and asked, \u201cAre you settling your own meal or do you need someone to help?\u201d\u201cNo need, someone will bring me my food. You can go by yourself.\u201d With Qiao Nan\u2019s concern, Zhu Baoguo felt at ease.\u201cFine.\u201d Having received this response, Qiao Nan did not dawdle and simply left.When she reached the entrance of the classroom, Qiao Nan saw a male stranger walking towards the classroom.Qiao Nan raised her eyebrows. This seemed to be the person who was delivering the food to Zhu Baoguo.After ascertaining that Zhu Baoguo would not die of hunger, Qiao Nan completely put down her worries and went to eat on her own.\u201cBoss.\u201d After Hou Shan entered the classroom, he said jokingly while taking a glance at the direction where Qiao Nan left. \u201cBoss, you actually attended class obediently, is the sun is rising in the west? That girl is so beautiful, is she my sister-in-law?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. She is my sister. She was the one who saved me.\u201d Zhu Baoguo smiled grimly for a while. \u201cShe\u2019s called Qiao Nan. Help me check if there is anyone plotting against her. How could I allow anyone to bully my sister?\u201dZhu Baoguo was a very sensitive person. Even if Zhao Yu and Zhou Lei did not say much, Zhu Baoguo also guessed a little.He was still injured and it was not convenient from him to investigate, but he had some followers in the school. He could send his follower to handle such small matters.\u201cSo she is Qiao Nan. Boss, you don\u2019t need to investigate this, I already know.\u201d Hou Shan simply told Zhu Baoguo all of what happened recently in the school.\u201cMy sister is so obedient, it\u2019s impossible that she would mix with those people. My sister\u2019s grades are so good and they said she cheated, who made those rumors, I\u2019ll kill them!\u201d Zhu Baoguo revealed a fierce look. After all, if Qiao Nan was dragged into this, it was because of him.Zhu Baoguo understood immediately that rumors were certainly related to the matter of Qiao Nan saving him.After all, before Qiao Nan saved him, he already know that the quad had Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao, but he did not hear anyone talk bad about Xiao Qiao before.If Qiao Nan had contact with those people, the only time would be when she saved him.\u201cBoss, don\u2019t be anxious, this matter has already been cleared. Before the flag-raising ceremony, sister-in-law\u2026 Boss, what do I call her?\u201d Hou Shan felt awkward. If he could not call sister-in-law, what could he address her as? \u201cDo I call her as sister?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my sister, what has this got to do with you?!\u201d Zhu Baoguo of course declined. \u201cYou can call her Qiao Nan.\u201d\u201cOh, Boss. You really dragged Qiao Nan into this. That day, when Qiao Nan saved you, someone with a loud mouth saw it and weaved tales that Qiao Nan was friends with the hooligans. Moreover, they said that Qiao Nan\u2019s grades were always good because the hooligans helped her to steal the test papers. You don\u2019t know how miserable Qiao Nan was at that time, many in the school looked down on her.\u201dQiao Nan was the top student in the school. When people in the school knew that she was a fraud, many took the chance to add salt to the wound.Hou Shan recalled that he also secretly laughed at Qiao Nan at that time.No matter how outstanding she was, all the good grades were the credit of others who \u201cstole\u201d for her. This was worse than a student like him, who scored as much as he deserved.Of course, Hou Shan did not dare to say all this to Zhu Baoguo, as he was afraid of being bashed by Zhu Baoguo.\u201cI\u2019ll assign you a mission \u2013 help to investigate who was the one who started this.\u201d Zhu Baoguo\u2019s eyes were full of hate. The person had the gall of a leopard to dare to do this to his sister.\u201cBoss, don\u2019t worry. I assure you that I will help you to settle this properly.\u201d Hou Shan patted himself on the chest. Previously he was not concerned about this matter, if he wanted to investigate, it would be easy.\u201cWhere\u2019s my food? I\u2019m starving.\u201d\u201cHere.\u201d The brother\u2019s follower, a guy who was always by Hou Shan\u2019s side, brought Zhu Baoguo\u2019s food over. Zhu Baoguo finished up his meal neatly and in the span of a few minutes.When Qiao Nan was back, Zhu Baoguo was already resting his head on the table and napping.Seeing Zhu Baoguo, Qiao Nan was more relieved.In the afternoon, after school, Zhu Baoguo was taken home by the Zhu family.When the Zhu family saw Zhu Baoguo coming out from the school, they heaved a sigh of relief, and sent Zhu Baoguo home as fast as they could.Without Zhu Baoguo\u2019s disturbance, Qiao Nan felt more relaxed. As usual, she went to the Zhai family\u2019s storeroom to change her books.When Qiao Nan just reached, she found the storeroom unlocked. She opened the door and saw a person sitting inside.\u201cZhai, Brother Zhai?\u201d She had not seen Brother Zhai for more than a month. Qiao Nan was used to being like a little mouse in the Zhai family, coming and leaving quietly, when she suddenly ran into a person today, she was feeling a little guilty.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhai Sheng put down the books in his hands. \u201cDo you come here often?\u201dZhai Sheng had given his desk to Qiao Nan. So, when he came back this time, he did not have a desk and he came to the storeroom.To Zhai Sheng, it did not matter where he read, as long as the environment was conducive.What surprised Zhai Sheng was that the storeroom was not only tidy but also very clean. He could see that someone had been cleaning this place often.The Zhai family did not come to the storeroom. The only person that would tidy this place up was Qiao Nan.As a soldier, Zhai Sheng was used to settling everything in a slow and orderly manner, he could not stand messiness and disorder.Qiao Nan was only a girl in her teenage years and the place belonged to the Zhai family. Qiao Nan made the effort to tidy up the place so nicely, Zhai Sheng did not expect this.Zhai Sheng nodded his head with satisfaction.\u201cFrom Monday to Friday when I need to attend school, I will come here to change the books. But I\u2019ll be here every weekend.\u201d Standing before Zhai Sheng, Qiao Nan was as honest as a student with her disciplinary master \u2013 her little feet close together, little hands placed properly, body stiff, a pair of eyes that that looked down at her toes and did not dare to look elsewhere. In particular, she did not dare to look Zhai Sheng straight in the eyes.Each time she stood before Zhai Sheng, Qiao Nan felt very stressed.Since she knew about Zhai Sheng\u2019s success in future, she certainly saw him in a different light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yes.\u201d Qiao Nan was stunned for a while, then nodded.\u201cDon\u2019t be so nervous. Sit down.\u201d When he saw the young lady looking extremely pitiful, similar to when he met her in the summer vacation, Zhai Sheng\u2019s tone softened.Of course, this softened demeanor was solely Zhai Sheng\u2019s assumption. To Qiao Nan, Zhai Sheng\u2019s voice sounded more aloof and frightening.\u201cHow are your grades coming along recently?\u201d\u201cNot not, not th-that good.\u201d Qiao Nan stammered and nearly bit her tongue when she spoke.Qiao Nan\u2019s face was flustered. She turned away and patted her face gently. She felt calmer thereafter and continued to face Zhai Sheng. \u201cAs I did not revise for one summer vacation, I have forgotten some of the knowledge. I I, I have been trying to catch up recently.\u201d\u201cTaken your exams?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat have you been tested on, how many marks did you score?\u201d\u201cChinese, Maths and English. Scored 85 marks for Chinese and Mathematics, and full marks for English.\u201dQiao Nan realized that she had said the wrong things. Her and Brother Zhai\u2019s relationship was not akin to supervisor and subordinate. They were similar to that of parent and child!Zhai Sheng was only older than Qiao Nan by four years, but in terms of aura even Qiao Nan, who had been through two lifetimes, did not feel worthy before Zhai Sheng.\u201cThese grades, do you have the test papers, let me take a look.\u201d\u201cThe papers were already returned to the teacher, I don\u2019t have it.\u201d Qiao Nan shook her head several times. She felt nervous to let Zhai Sheng see the papers.Even when Qiao Dongliang asked about her grades, she did not have this feeling. Before Zhai Sheng, she did not know why she felt so uptight and formal that she did not know where to place her limbs.\u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d Zhai Sheng realised that his several attempts to put down his airs and communicate with Qiao Nan peacefully had failed.Before him, Qiao Nan was like a rabbit who met a tiger. She was so scared that her limbs were wobbly and shivering with no strength to escape.Zhai Sheng could not help asking himself, was he really so scary?\u201cNot not not\u2026 \u201d Qiao Nan wanted to say \u201cnot scary\u201d, but when she stammered \u201cnot\u201d ten times, she changed her mind and said \u201cA little.\u201d\u201cJust a little?\u201d Zhai Sheng did not believe.\u201cMore, a little more?\u201d Qiao Nan showed her fingers, indicating that it was more than a little.Zhai Sheng pursed his lips. His sharp falcon-like eyes revealed a hint of a faint smile. It should be more than a little, otherwise who would dare to play tricks in front of him.\u201cIf I am home, you can look for me if you have any questions.\u201d\u201cNo thanks.\u201d Qiao Nan declined flatly. Zhai Sheng was not an ordinary man, his time was so precious, how could his time be wasted on her?\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me?\u201d\u201cNo, Brother Zhai. You misunderstood me. I mean, if I seek your help, I am wasting your time as you have more important things to worry about.\u201d When she said this, Qiao Nan was quite coherent. \u201cAll my teachers have assigned me homework. If I have any questions, it is sufficient for me to ask them. Brother Zhai, you are destined for greater things in life.\u201dIn the previous lifetime, the Tian Dynasty was able to achieve peace and prosperity, with a wealthy nation and strong people, and Brother Zhai played a crucial role in this.Brother Zhai was an army genius and had a gifted brain. He was an extraordinary man.She remembered that once, there were strange activities at the border of the Tian Dynasty, the local and the bandits colluded and killed the people of the Tian Dynasty. They also framed the people for the crime of smuggling drugs.This matter was very serious and affected a lot of people.The exact situation, process and extent of danger \u2013 Qiao Nan heard about it but she also knew that if the matter was not dealt with properly, there would be countless deaths in the Tian Dynasty. The national interests would suffer greatly.But she also knew that his matter would eventually be fully resolved, with losses recovered, and it was all due to Brother Zhai.To Qiao Nan, Brother Zhai was a great character and a superhero in Qiao Nan\u2019s heart.Since ancient times, the peace and stability of the country depended on a soldier like Zhai Sheng.In her previous life, Qiao Nan did not pursue any idols, she only loved military uniforms and admired the army guys. Zhai Sheng was the leader of the army. He had a few identities that Qiao Nan liked. Hence, Qiao Nan could not help feeling nervous when she saw him.In the lifetime that Qiao Nan was reborn to, the youngsters were already crazy over idols, they would be so excited when they saw them.So, Qiao Nan felt that although she stammered before Zhai Sheng, and she could not make much sense of her words, she was considered well in control.If these words came from others, Brother Zhai might not believe it.However, when Zhai Sheng saw that Qiao Nan\u2019s eyes shone with so much admiration and passion when she said these flattering words, he smiled again.At this sight of Qiao Nan, he could not help but suspect if he had really done something great to be able to receive such a compliment from Qiao Nan.In particular, Qiao Nan looked at him with such passionate and burning eyes, Zhai Sheng was not used to it.\u201cIt\u2019s late now, you should return home.\u201d Zhai Sheng reminded Qiao Nan as he glanced outside and realized that the sun was setting soon.\u201cOh yes!\u201d Qiao Nan slapped her head. \u201cBrother Zhai, I am going home.\u201d Qiao Nan changed one of her books and ran as fast as a rabbit towards the house of the Qiao family.Seeing Qiao Nan, the stiff face of Zhai Sheng seemingly became gentle, the corners of his mouth was slightly curved upwards with a sign of smile, like the beautiful and short moment of the winter\u2019s first snow.Once Qiao Nan left, the storeroom resumed its quietness. There was occasional sounds of Zhai Sheng flipping his books.\u201cDad.\u201d When Qiao Nan reached home, Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi were already off work.Ding Jiayi snorted and went to prepare dinner. Qiao Dongliang asked with concern. \u201cWhy are you home late today?\u201d\u201cTo save someone again.\u201d Ding Jiayi said sarcastically.Qiao Nan laughed. \u201cNo, I went to the place where I kept the books to change them. So, I took the longer route and came back late.\u201dQiao Nan\u2019s words was akin to giving Ding Jiayi a tight slap in the face.Qiao Nan was not a policewoman, how could she save someone everyday. However, the reason why Qiao Nan came home was because she routed to another path to change her books, and Ding Jiayi was the cause of this.Thus, when Qiao Nan was home late, there was only Ding Jiayi, who had done her duty as a mother so well, to blame.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even so, Ding Jiayi still disliked her. Now that Qiao Nan had learned to rebut her words, Ding Jiayi disliked her even more.Qiao Dongliang saw how the younger daughter rebutted her mother. Ding Jiayi was flushed red and at a loss for words. Qiao Dongliang frowned and said, \u201cNan Nan.\u201dAs the saying goes, \u201cParents always have their good reasons\u201d, no matter what, Old Ding was Nan Nan\u2019s mother, Nan Nan should not speak to her in that way.To others, the younger daughter\u2019s words might not mean anything. But Qiao Dongliang could tell that she was digging at her mother.Qiao Nan curled her lips and mocked herself. She knew things would turn out like this.But it was okay. Like she said, she would pamper herself. Though her father did not favor her, she would not ask for more as long as he was not as biased as Mom and only doted on Qiao Zijin, depriving her of the chance to study.\u201cDad, I will return my school bag to the room.\u201dWithout much expression on her face, Qiao Nan returned to her room, never once glancing at her parents. Qiao Dongliang felt uneasy at her attitude.Waiting for Qiao Nan to close door, Qiao Dongliang chided at Ding Jiayi, \u201cNan Nan is not someone who is disobedient and insensible. You knew that she is a good child yet you have to pick on her? Look at her attitude now, if you continue with your cold remarks, she may not treat you as her mother in future.\u201dQiao Dongliang could feel that Qiao Nan had turned cold and aloof towards Ding Jiayi.In the past, Qiao Nan would never disobey Ding Jiayi\u2019s orders. At times, whenever she was free, she would take the initiative to do the household chores. Back then, Ding Jiayi did not have to work and was still a full time housewife.Even if Qiao Nan was not very affectionate and did not always call her Mom, from the way Qiao Nan looked at Ding Jiayi, Qiao Dongliang could sense the longing affection that Qiao Nan had for her mother.But he could no longer see the longing affection in her eyes now.The younger daughter\u2019s expression had turned cold and detached. Qiao Dongliang could not help but be worried.\u201cI gave birth to her. Regardless of whether she treated me as her mother or not, I am still her mother. Even when she is a adult, she still has to obey me.\u201d Ding Jiayi had nothing to fear.She did not wish to listen to Qiao Dongliang\u2019s lectures anymore. She went off to prepare dinner.Ding Jiayi walked into the kitchen. It did not occur to her that she was also brought up by her mother.But when her mother wanted to sell her off, she also did not obey her and married Qiao Dongliang instead.\u201cNan Nan?\u201d Since his wife refused to listen, Qiao Dongliang went to look for his daughter, hoping to talk some sense into her.\u201cDad.\u201d Qiao Nan was writing. \u201cDad, I am doing my homework. Is anything the matter?\u201dQiao Dongliang was embarrassed when he saw that Qiao Nan was really doing her homework. \u201cNothing, carry on with your homework. There\u2019s nothing more important than your studies. You carry on with your work, I won\u2019t disturb you.\u201dWith that, Qiao Dongliang closed the door and left without saying anything.After he left, Qiao Nan sighed in exasperation.As expected, her father liked to see that his daughters were studying. She knew the reason why her father came looking for her, but she did not want to listen.As children, she shouldn\u2019t argue with her parents. But the saying \u201cParents always have their good reasons\u201d was not applicable to her mother.In her previous lifetime she had already paid all the debts and given in to all her demands and requests. In this lifetime, she would not compromise anymore.After that, Qiao Nan tried to avoid Qiao Dongliang at all costs.Qiao Dongliang could not disturb her as she wanted to study. On the second day, everyone in the family went off to work and to school. Qiao Dongliang didn\u2019t have the time to have a word with Qiao Nan for a few consecutive days.This day Qiao Dongliang was back from work. He had just entered the quad when he was led away by Elder Lee\u2019s men.Since Qiao Nan was born, this was the second time that Qiao Dongliang saw Elder Lee. He was very happy to see him, \u201cUncle Lee, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dQiao Dongliang pondered for a few moments and asked, \u201cIs it related to Baoguo?\u201d\u201cXiao Qiao, you should know that my grandson is not good in his studies. So I would like for Nan Nan to tutor him. Is this weekend okay?\u201d Elder Lee smiled and nodded his head.Qiao Dongliang hesitated for a moment. \u201cUncle Lee, it\u2019s not that I do not want to help. Nan Nan\u2019s results have lagged behind recently. Will she be a hindrance to Baoguo? Uncle Lee, actually it might be better if you hire a professional tutor for Baoguo.\u201dQiao Dongliang was worried that Baoguo\u2019s results might deteriorate with his daughter\u2019s coaching. If that happened, he would not be able to answer to Uncle Lee.It never crossed his mind that Qiao Nan\u2019s results might be affected if she tutored Zhu Baoguo. Right now his main concern was how he could mend his relationship with Elder Lee and to repay his debts of gratitude towards him.\u201cNo need, I think Nan Nan is a good choice.\u201d Elder Lee shook his head, rejecting Qiao Dongliang\u2019s suggestion.\u201cUncle Lee, during school hours, Nan Nan could take Baoguo in hand, this\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. No matter what, I would like to thank Nan Nan for this. Nan Nan is the perfect candidate.\u201d Elder Lee understood Qiao Dongliang\u2019s concerns. He laughed, \u201cYou might not know, Baoguo is very stubborn. If he dislikes someone, he would refuse to listen to that person.\u201dHis grandson had in fact sent away several private tutors. At the mention of this, Elder Lee had a splitting headache.\u201cAfter going back to school, I find that Baoguo is much more obedient. He would stay in school everyday. I heard that it\u2019s Nan Nan who keeps an eye on him. I think Nan Nan would be able to keep him in check. As for Baoguo, he is already in secondary three. I do not harbor any hopes that his results would improve.\u201dHis grandson has missed a lot of the classes. Not to mention Qiao Nan, his teachers might not even be able to help him to improve his results.\u201cSo you would like Nan Nan to keep an eye on him?\u201d\u201cYes, Baoguo has not fully recovered from his injuries. But he is so full of energy that he can\u2019t keep still. Nobody can control him.\u201dQiao Dongliang was shocked. He had heard of Zhu Baoguo\u2019s temper; to put it bluntly, he was a bully. When they were still young, all the children in the quad were fearful of Zhu Baoguo. They tried to keep themselves out of his way.Nan Nan might be of the same age as Zhu Baoguo, but they never played together when they were small. Would Zhu Baoguo obey her?\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it might work. Nan Nan is a quiet girl.\u201d Qiao Dongliang thought about it and agreed.\u201cXiao Qiao, have you heard of this saying \u201cTo govern the country (and bring peace to all), one should first be able to govern one\u2019s family\u201d? Recently I have heard quite a lot of rumors about your family. Xiao Qiao, what are your views?\u201d After settling Zhu Baoguo\u2019s matters, Uncle Lee touched upon his main topic.\u201cMy\u2026 My family is doing well.\u201d Qiao Dongliang blushed. Why would Uncle Lee ask this question? Did Nan Nan spout nonsense to Baoguo?One should not wash dirty linen in public. Nan Nan had gone way overboard this time!\u201cGood? It\u2019s good that your wife sold Nan Nan\u2019s books and wanted her to quit school?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why would Nan Nan need to work? Nan Nan\u2019s results are good, yet you wanted her to discontinue the nine years of compulsory education and to start work, is everything alright at home? Did your wife spend all the savings at home when she came to ask me for help to enroll the elder daughter into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China? Xiao Qiao, I always taught you to be pragmatic. As the saying goes, \u201cThere are three hundred and sixty five trades, and every trade has its master\u201d. If she is not good at studying, she can consider other options. Is it appropriate to spend all the hard earned money on the elder daughter and to sacrifice the future of another daughter? It\u2019s useless to reach for what is beyond one\u2019s grasp, instead one should be earnest and down-to-earth. One should act according to one\u2019s ability. Teenagers nowadays are flippant and not down-to-earth. Xiao Qiao, why would you have this shortcoming as well? Don\u2019t forget, you were a soldier!\u201dAfter listening to Uncle Lee\u2019s wise and earnest words, Qiao Dongliang was lost for words.He could understand every single word that Elder Lee said. But when they formed into sentences, they seemed foreign to him.\u201cUncle Lee, it was through your help that Zijin was able to enroll into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China?\u201d Qiao Dongliang paused for a moment before he asked.\u201cXiao Ding came looking for me. She would like me to make a phone call. She was the one who made the other arrangements. Xiao Qiao, you should know my temper, I would never do these things. Even if it was for my son or my daughter. You grew up with them, have I helped them out in similar ways? Xiao Qiao, do you know how disappointed I was in you at that time?\u201dUncle Lee sighed.When Ding Jiayi came looking for Elder Lee to help out with Qiao Zijin\u2019s matters, Elder Lee was not very willing to help. He had always disliked these dealings.Even for his biological son and daughter, he wanted them to carve out a path by themselves. Yet he had to resort to getting in through the back door for someone else\u2019s daughter. Elder Lee really wanted to turn Ding Jiayi down.\u201cElder Lee, I had no idea.\u201d Qiao Dongliang rubbed his face. Old Ding did such a thing behind his back and resorted to these methods to enroll Zijin into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.\u201cI knew you were unaware. If you were aware, you would have stopped Xiao Ding from seeking my help.\u201d Uncle Lee nodded. After all he watched Qiao Dongliang grew up, he knew him well.When Qiao Dongliang heard this, he felt slightly relieved.\u201cBut Xiao Qiao, Xiao Ding is your wife. You had no idea what she is doing or what she is up to. Even when your elder daughter really enrolled into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, you did not say anything. This is what disappointed me the most. Xiao Qiao, you are a soldier. Now that you are no longer in the army, is your heart discharged as well?\u201d\u201cDo you know what was on my mind then? I thought that fortunately you were discharged from the army. Otherwise, if you continued to stay in the army with your mindset, it\u2019s a small matter if you create troubles for yourself, but what if you dragged your comrades down as well? Xiao Qiao, you are the only person who can disappoint me.\u201dOf course, Uncle Lee agreed to help as he had guessed that it was Ding Jiayi who made the decision to look for him.Elder Lee was the one who introduced Ding Jiayi to Qiao Dongliang. If not for Elder Lee, Qiao Dongliang would not have married Ding Jiayi.He had to help since it was Ding Jiayi. No matter how unhappy he was, he had to make the phone call.But he had told Ding Jiayi there and then, that it was the first and only time that he would do her this favor.Qiao Dongliang was furious and upset when he knew that Elder Lee was disappointed with him. He had thought that it was his wife who had created the trouble and it was his younger daughter who told Elder Lee of the situation at home, and that he ended up being so embarrassed all because of them.But after hearing Elder Lee\u2019s words, he realized that he was the real problem. Elder Lee was disappointed by his behavior, it had nothing to do with his family.\u201cXiao Qiao, tell me honestly, regarding what I said just now, did you think that it was Nan Nan who told Baoguo and Baoguo relayed it to me?\u201dAt Elder Lee\u2019s questioning, Qiao Dongliang\u2019s expression turned grave and was red with embarrassment. He was speechless.\u201cLook at you, you do not have the attributes of a soldier. You did not look into it or probe and yet you jump to conclusions and declare Nan Nan guilty. When you were in the army, what did the officer teach you? They say Xiao Ding is biased. To me, you are biased as well. I did hear some stories from Baoguo. But for the rest, it had already spread around in the quad. Xiao Qiao, should you do some reflections?\u201dSince some time ago, the people from the quad came to know that Ding Jiayi sold Nan Nan\u2019s books and because of that she almost could not continue with her studies.Everyone also knew about the fact that Ding Jiayi wanted the younger daughter to quit school and to start working.Lots of the people from the quad saw Qiao Nan coming back with a stacks of old books from the thrift shop.After seeing it with their eyes, the people from the quad all believed what they heard regarding Qiao family.In other words, everyone knew what had happened at the Qiao family these past two or three months. It was a textbook example of what not to do.\u201cSpread?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was dumbfounded. It was no wonder that the people from the quad gave him weird stares whenever he went work.\u201cXiao Qiao, I am really disappointed in you.\u201d Uncle Lee could not hide his exasperation towards Qiao Dongliang. \u201cWhere is your heart? Why are you muddle-headed like a block of wood?\u201d\u201cAlright, it\u2019s late. You should go back. Bao Guo told me that Nan Nan is very quiet at school, her character is just like what you said. This weekend send Nan Nan to my house. You do not have to worry about her meals.\u201dWith that, Elder Lee waved his hands motioning for Qiao Dongliang to leave.He was annoyed and vexed. He did not want to see Qiao Dongliang anymore.Actually when he visited Qiao\u2019s house to thank Qiao Nan, he had noticed the weird atmosphere then.When Zhu Baoguo told him of the bad rumors circulating around the school regarding Qiao Nan, he had sent people to investigate.He was shocked at the results. Lots of things had happened at Qiao family recently, and all were scandals.Before school reopened, Qiao Nan was beaten by Ding Jiayi and dashed out of the house with blood dripping from her nose. After she was sent to the hospital by Qiao Dongliang, the doctor diagnosed that she was malnourished. Elder Lee was speechless when he heard about this.The country was prosperous and the economy was doing well. There wasn\u2019t even famine here, why would Qiao Dongliang\u2019s daughter be malnourished? This was really\u2026Elder Lee clearly remembered that when he saw the two sisters that day, Qiao Zijin was polite, well dressed and good with words. She was someone who was good at networking.One look at her and one could tell that she was doted by her parents. On the other hand, Qiao Nan had been standing behind her, not uttering a single word. If he did not mention, Qiao Nan would be like a shadow, going unnoticed by everyone. It pained Elder Lee to see this.Two daughters, yet one had a plump face and looked radiant, while the other one looked pale and yellowish, silent and reticent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Elder Lee could not understand why Qiao Dongliang would let such things happen at his house.Elder Lee looked weary and tired. Qiao Dongliang did not say a word, stood up and turned to leave.Qiao Dongliang had known Elder Lee for years. Even if it was when he left the army to have a second child, Elder Lee might be disappointed in him, but he had never said such harsh words to him.\u201cNan Nan, you are back.\u201d When Qiao Dongliang reached home, Qiao Nan was already at home.Qiao Nan paused and called \u201cFather\u201d.Qiao Dongliang sighed at the younger daughter\u2019s cold attitude. It seemed like Nan Nan blamed both Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi for what happened.\u201cAre you going to read your books?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Qiao Nan had no idea what Qiao Dongliang wanted to talk to her about. As usual, she refused to communicate with him. No matter what, she would not compromise regarding matters concerning her mother.\u201cThen go ahead to study.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dThe conversation between the father and daughter ended with simple replies.During dinnertime, Qiao Dongliang said, \u201cNan Nan, make a trip to Lee\u2019s house tomorrow.\u201d\u201cLee\u2019s house? Qiao Nan blinked in confusion. \u201cElder Lee\u2019s house?\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t call him \u2018Elder Lee\u2019, call him \u2018Grandpa\u2019.\u201d Qiao Dongliang reprimanded Qiao Nan. \u201cTomorrow Zhu Baoguo will go to Lee\u2019s house. You will help him with his revision. Remember, put in some efforts and teach him well. Do you understand?\u201dQiao Nan pursed her lips and replied coldly.Ding Jiayi was not too happy at this news. But when she saw Qiao Nan\u2019s response, she thought about it and curled her lips into a smile. This time, she did not give her objections.Qiao Dongliang had already promised Elder Lee. Qiao Nan had no other choice. On the weekend, she took her books and went to Lee\u2019s house. Zhu Baoguo arrived earlier than her.\u201cOh, you have arrived.\u201d Zhu Baoguo propped his two legs on the table, leaned back on the chair, twitched his lips and held his pen with his upper lips and nose. He did not look like he was here to study. In fact, he looked like he was on vacation.Seeing this, Qiao Nan frowned and said coldly, \u201cYou have two choices, one, you can\u2019t go out, you will do whatever you want while I read my books; second, put down your legs, you will do what I say.\u201dZhu Baoguo\u2019s legs crumbled under him, he almost fell off from his chair.He never thought that Qiao Nan would be so firm. This was Lee\u2019s house, but it seemed more like Qiao\u2019s house.Since Qiao Nan was here, shouldn\u2019t she talk to him nicely and patiently and only start teaching when he had accepted her?Why did Qiao Nan sound as if she did not care if he wanted to learn or not? If he did not want to study, she was not going to coax him into learning? She would allow him to do whatever he wanted?Grandpa asked Qiao Nan to coach him. Could Qiao Nan say all this?\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Zhu Baoguo was dumbfounded.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Qiao Nan sat at one side and took out her revision notes. Without another look at Zhu Baoguo\u2019s legs that was propped on the table, she started to read her books.\u201cBut my Grandpa asked you to teach me.\u201d Was Qiao Nan\u2019s attitude that of a tutor?\u201cThe teachers were there to teach students. But if you refuse to learn, can they do anything about it? I couldn\u2019t possibly be better than a teacher.\u201d To Qiao Nan who once lost the chance to study, she was very displeased with Zhu Baoguo\u2019s learning attitude. He did not understand how fortunate he was.It was up to Zhu Baoguo whether he wanted to study or not. If he was willing to learn, she would put in efforts to teach.If Zhu Baoguo was unwilling to study, she would just treat it as another place for her to study.Lee\u2019s house was big and spacious and there was no-one to disturb her. If not for the good study environment, she would not have wasted her time on someone who did not want to study.\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to persuade me to study at all? Aren\u2019t you worried that given your bad attitude, I\u2014I might walk off in anger?\u201d Zhu Baoguo stood up, preparing to leave.Zhu Baoguo turned and looked at Qiao Nan while he was on his way out. He was waiting for Qiao Nan to come after him.But he had already reached the door, and he realized that Qiao Nan was still at the table. In fact she seemed to have finished a few problem sums.Zhu Baoguo felt really foolish. Qiao Nan did not pay attention to him at all. She made use of the time to study. He only took a few steps towards the door, but she had already finished a few questions.\u201cHey!\u201d Zhu Baoguo walked angrily to Qiao Nan\u2019s side. When Qiao Nan paid no attention to him, he snatched her books in anger.Qiao Nan squinted at Zhu Baoguo, \u201cI have lots of workbooks. It\u2019s alright if you snatched one of my workbooks. I can change to another workbook. But don\u2019t you find yourself to be very childish?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by this attitude of yours? Do you not want to teach me? Are you looking down on me because I did not have a mother since a young age?\u201d This time, Zhu Baoguo was really furious.He really treated Qiao Nan as his sister. But she had always been cold towards him. Did she think that he was beyond hope and it would be a waste of time to teach him?\u201cLook down? I do not have the right to do that.\u201d Qiao Nan shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I knew it better than anyone else. If you are willing to learn, you would be able to take in what I said. But if you do not want to learn, you would turn a deaf ear to what I said and my studies would be affected as well. It\u2019s not worth it. Do you want to learn or not?\u201dQiao Nan did not use any flowery language, and her words might not carry a deep meaning, but what she said was the plain, simple truth.Qiao Nan was so calm and indifferent. Zhu Baoguo\u2019s outburst of temper did not affect her at all.\u201cYou would teach me if I wanted to learn? Zhu Baoguo asked in some annoyance.\u201cYes, if you want to learn, I will teach you; If you don\u2019t want to learn, I won\u2019t bother you.\u201d\u201cHow do you intend to teach me? I don\u2019t even know what my standard is.\u201d\u201cFinish this first. I will decide on how to teach you after that.\u201d Qiao Nan handed a sheet of paper to Zhu Baoguo. It was a test paper to determine his standards.Zhu Baoguo was appeased when he saw the handwritten test paper. \u201cSo you came prepared.\u201d Qiao Nan actually cared about him.Qiao Nan remained silent about Zhu Baoguo\u2019s demanding character. She was fine as long as he kept quiet.Zhu Baoguo took the handwritten test paper and started working on it while Qiao Nan was busy doing her problems. The room was in total silence, it was a good learning environment.Elder Zhu could not help but worry about his grandson. He decided to take a look.He was not worried that his grandson might bully the young lady. He was anxious that he might not be willing to study, and that he might head off to have fun after throwing a tantrum at the young lady. It would be disastrous if he injured himself again.What he saw came as a surprise to him. When he walked into Lee\u2019s house, his grandson sat quietly at a side, with a pen in hand, writing diligently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHas hell frozen over?Elder Zhu told the people around him not to make a sound and went to look for Elder Lee.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Elder Lee snorted when he saw Elder Zhu. His daughter was so smart, his grandson should be smart as well. Yet he was pampered to such an extent by the Zhu family. It was all the fault of this old man.But the Lee family had not bothered to care about Zhu Baoguo\u2019s affairs, hence he had no right to chide Elder Zhu.\u201cWhy bother with watering the plants? Are you really going to let that young lady teach Baoguo? What can a young lady be capable of? The Zhu family is capable of hiring a teacher. Let me tell you beforehand, if Baoguo\u2019s results is not good even with the tutoring, do not put the blame on the Zhu family.\u201dEven if Elder Lee kept quiet about it, Elder Zhu knew what was on his in-law\u2019s mind.They had brought up their grandson by themselves. For people like Elder Zhu who was conventional in his thinking, they would naturally dote and pamper their grandson.Discipline, Elder Zhu wanted to discipline him but he had no idea how to discipline. On top of that, his grandson had lost his mother at a young age and his father was not by his side to take care of him. It was already very painful for him to be all alone by himself. So Elder Lee could not help but pamper Zhu Baoguo.\u201cLike you said, the Zhu family was capable of hiring a teacher. Didn\u2019t you hire a teacher for Zhu Baoguo before? And what were the results? Look now, Nan Nan might be a young lady, but you have to see Baoguo\u2019s attitude towards her.\u201dElder Lee smirked.The Zhu family had hired several teachers for his grandson, male and female.But when the teachers knew of the identity of his grandson, they dared not offend him. Moreover his grandson was very mischievous. The female teachers all ended up in tears of exasperation, while the male teachers were too frustrated that they quit.For some matters, one could not judge a person\u2019s capabilities by his age or qualifications. One had to judge them based on the person itself.\u201cDo you mean that my grandson has been subdued by that young lady?\u201d Elder Zhu was unhappy. His grandson had been a bully at home. But he was intimidated by this little girl, what did this mean?\u201cBaoguo was willing to be subdued, and Qiao Nan was willing to subdue him as well.\u201d Elder Lee had learned of what happened between Zhu Baoguo and Qiao Nan just now.Elder Lee was slightly annoyed by Qiao Nan\u2019s cold attitude. But he could understand, since he knew of her situation at home.In particular when his grandson asked \u201cAre you looking down on me because I do not have a mother since a young age?\u201d Elder Lee knew that this was hurtful for both his grandson and Qiao Nan.Looking at Ding Jiayi\u2019s temper, having a mother and being without a mother did not make a difference.And though his daughter had passed away at a young age, his grandson still loved and missed his mother. But Nan Nan had no feelings left for Ding Jiayi.\u201cThis young lady was so pitiful?\u201d After hearing about Qiao family\u2019s affairs, Elder Zhu was shocked. \u201cWhat does Qiao Dongliang mean by that? He had a daughter but he did not bring her up well, and he did not say a word when his wife bullied her?\u201d\u201cHe is a traditional man, favoring sons more than daughters. It totally clouded his judgment.\u201d Elder Lee laughed coldly. He had seen through Qiao Dongliang, but he did not spell it out on that day.The reason why Qiao Dongliang did not put in efforts on Qiao Nan was simple \u2013 Qiao Nan was a daughter, not a son.If Qiao Nan was a son, even if Ding Jiayi favored daughters over sons, Qiao Dongliang would know of it if Ding Jiayi did not treat Qiao Nan well.\u201cBaoguo is such a troublemaker and yet you get him a young teacher. Is that suitable?\u201d Elder Zhu was troubled over this.His grandson was very stubborn and had a bad temper, he could not get along well with anyone.Judging from the family that the young lady came from, she must not be someone who was warm hearted.Would a young teacher like her be able to teach his grandson?\u201cI only wanted Nan Nan to coach him in his studies. She is not responsible for his character building. That is Zhu Chengqi\u2019s responsibility.\u201d Elder Lee gave him an angry stare. He was full of complaints at the mention of his son-in-law, Zhu Chengqi.His daughter was no longer around, Zhu Chengqi should bear the full responsibility of teaching and guiding his grandson. Yet look at what Zhu Chengqi had done!It was a fact that his daughter had passed away, but Zhu Chengqi was always not at home, his grandson had been leading his life with the absence of his father.It was Zhu Chengqi\u2019s fault that his grandson was so disobedient and keep getting into trouble.\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough. Let\u2019s not talk about this.\u201d Elder Zhu waved his hands, he did not wish to talk about his son.Both of them were glad that his son and daughter-in-law had deep affections for each other.But who would have known that after the daughter-in-law died, his son would neglect his biological son and failed to take him in hand. Elder Zhu was boiling with anger at the mention of his son.When Zhu Baoguo was sent to the the hospital for emergency treatment, Elder Zhu ordered Zhu Chengqi to come back from the army. As soon as he arrived, Elder Zhu gave him a few punches out of anger and exasperation.Elder Zhu might be old, but he was once a soldier. His fists were still very powerful, it would be painful to be on the receiving end of his punches.\u201cBaoguo has very high self-esteem, he would definitely not accept someone who was warm hearted and compassionate. Instead, Baoguo would listen to Nan Nan who was indifferent and cold. Facts speak louder than words, I think this arrangement would work. I did not expect Baoguo to catch up on his studies, I only hope that he would rein in his temper and stop being so irritable and he would not be bullied by those hooligans. If Baoguo is not good in his studies, I will send him to the army when he graduates from high school.\u201dElder Lee had his grandson\u2019s future all planned out.\u201cAlright.\u201d It was rare to see that his grandson settle down to study. No matter who the tutor was, what was important was that the grandson would listen to her.\u201cYou should make your way back. Baoguo will stay over at my house tonight.\u201d\u201cWhat, how could Baoguo not go home!\u201d Impossible.\u201cWhat do you mean by not go home? Lee\u2019s house is also Baoguo\u2019s home!\u201d Elder Lee fumed in anger. \u201cBaoguo is my biological maternal grandson, why can\u2019t he stay over for a night in my house?\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask Baoguo to stay over in the past? Why did you begin to care for him now?\u201d Elder Zhu would not budge regarding his grandson.Zhu Chengqi was Elder Zhu\u2019s only son, and Zhu Baoguo was Zhu Chengqi\u2019s only son.The saying is very true, \u201cThe first grandson and the last son are the lifeline of the old lady.\u201dThe first grandson, and the only grandson were the lifeline of the grandpa as well.Zhu Baoguo, who had finally settled down to work on the test paper turned green when he heard the loud quarrel between his two grandparents. He looked at Qiao Nan in embarrassment and unease.Qiao Nan remained calm and composed. \u201cWhy are you looking at me? Do your test papers, don\u2019t waste your time. We are in secondary three now, there isn\u2019t much time left for revision, so we have to be efficient.\u201dZhu Baoguo twitched his lips and finally managed to settle down.Before the incident, Elder Zhu and his wife were the only people who cared about Zhu Baoguo. but they had no idea how to discipline and care for him. As for the Lee family, they never asked about him at all.Come to think of it, Zhu Baoguo seldom went to Lee\u2019s house. He knew that they believed that he had caused his mother\u2019s death.Up till now, even if the Lee family had a change in attitude, Zhu Baoguo still found it weird and uncomfortable to be around his grandpa, Elder Lee.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their only wish was that he would mellow his temperament.During the past half month where Qiao Nan tutored him, both of the families never asked about Zhu Baoguo\u2019s performance.This weekend Qiao Zijin was back at home. She realized that Qiao Nan had gone out early on the Saturday morning. She frowned and asked her mother, \u201cMom, where has Qiao Nan gone?\u201dWhere exactly did she read her books?\u201cMom, Qiao Nan seems like a mouse nowadays. She seemed to have lots of mouse holes to go to. She spent the whole of the weekend outside instead of staying at home, you are just letting her be? Where did she keep her books? I don\u2019t suppose outsiders will keep her books for her without any charges?\u201d\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Ding Jiayi prepared breakfast and placed them on the table. \u201cYou better go brush up, have your breakfast and start studying. You must perform better than Qiao Nan. I am going off to work. As for other matters, we will talk later when I am back from work.\u201dDing Jiayi went off to work, not waiting for Qiao Zijin\u2019s response.\u201cHmph, everyone seems really busy.\u201d There was no one but her at home. The house felt so empty. Qiao Zijin felt uncomfortable.In the past, when it was the weekend, her father would be working while Qiao Nan would do the household chores. As for her, she would have a leisure chat with her mother. But now she was left all alone at home.Since she was free and she was not going to study if she stayed at home, why not she go out to look for Qiao Nan? She might discover her secret hiding place.But she had a change of mind when she opened the door and was about to go out. Not to mention the quad, the total area of Ping Cheng was quite significant, where was she going to find Qiao Nan?After some thoughts, Qiao Zijin rolled her eyes and took out the romantic novel that she borrowed from the library out of her bag.Qiao Dongliang had decreased the allowance that he gave Qiao Zijin. Even if Ding Jiayi was working now and would give some money to her, Qiao Zijin still owed some external debts for the dance costume that she bought last time. She had to save up money to return the debts.Hence she has decided if she wanted to read novels, she would not buy them, instead she would borrow them from the library. Not only could she save the money, she could also return the novel after she had finished reading them. In that case, no one would find out that she had been secretly reading these novels.She laid down on her bed and read her favorite novel. A thought came to her mind. It was good to be at home by herself.If Qiao Nan was around, she might come into her room and discovered that she was reading a novel and complain to their parents.\u201cNan Nan, now that I only come home once a fortnight, we don\u2019t have the time to have a proper chat. Where have you been all day long?\u201d During dinnertime in front of everyone, Qiao Zijin asked Qiao Nan this question. \u201cEven if you are to stay out for the whole day, you should come back for lunch.\u201dIn the beginning when there was only Qiao Zijin at home, she was glad that she could have the house to herself and no one would be around to disturb her while she was reading her novels.But Qiao Zijin turned unhappy whenever it was lunchtime.Ding Jiayi was not at home, and Qiao Nan had went out, there was no one around to prepare lunch for her.Unlike Qiao Nan, Qiao Zijin was clueless when it came to household chores. She was already scared out of wits by the worms in the vegetables, there was no way that she could cook for herself.Ding Jiayi who was in a rush did not think of that and had rushed off to work.Qiao Zijin searched through her parents\u2019 room, she found a fifty cent coin and used it to buy instant noodles. That was how she settled her lunch.It was only when Qiao Zijin mentioned lunch that Ding Jiayi remembered that the elder daughter did not know how to cook.But it was inappropriate to ask what the elder daughter had for lunch in front of Qiao Dongliang.Qiao Nan looked up from her bowl and curled her lips mockingly. This weekend was not the first weekend that she had been away. It had already been more than a month since she did not come home on the weekend.Qiao Zijin only cared about her as her mother was off to work and there was no one around to prepare her lunch.\u201cZijin, you don\u2019t have to worry about Nan Nan. She is at the Lee house. She\u2019s fine.\u201d Qiao Dongliang looked embarrassed at the mention of this.Elder Lee specifically ordered that Qiao Nan have her meals at the Lee house. Qiao Dongliang knew that Elder Lee must have heard that she was malnourished.At the thought of that, Qiao Dongliang shot cold stares at Ding Jiayi.Qiao Dongliang was furious when he knew that Ding Jiayi sought Elder Lee\u2019s help to enroll Qiao Zijin into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. But he did not pick a quarrel with Ding Jiayi. There was no use in quarreling, Qiao Zijin already went to that high school to study and she had made tremendous improvements.No matter how he kicked up a fuss, there would be no use. Qiao Dongliang could only keep quiet about this and pretended that he didn\u2019t know anything.\u201cWhy would Nan Nan go to Grandpa Lee\u2019s house?\u201d Qiao Zijin was stunned.\u201cTo help Baoguo with his studies.\u201d\u201cWhat, Nan Nan is helping Baoguo with his studies?\u201d Qiao Zijin shrieked. Her voice was jarring and noisy, sounding like a duck that has been grabbed by its throat. \u201cDad, you must be crazy. Nan Nan is already in junior high, she has to sit middle school exams next year. Her results have lagged behind and there was not enough time to study. Now she still has to tutor Zhu Baoguo, how is she going to sit for her middle school exams?\u201dQiao Nan\u2019s hand paused in the middle of eating. She glanced at Qiao Zijin, her eyes twinkled in surprise.But in the next instant she was back to normal.Indeed, there were risks involved for her to tutor Zhu Baoguo.But what Qiao Zijin said was definitely not out of concern. She must be worried that if Qiao Nan grew closer to Zhu Baoguo, she would have the support of the Lee family and the Zhu family. Her future would be assured and Qiao Zijin could no longer be able to order her around like a slave. This was what Qiao Zijin was anxious about.They were siblings and had been sisters for two lifetimes, Qiao Nan knew what was on Qiao Zijin\u2019s mind.If not for the connections with the Zhu family and the Lee family, Qiao Zijin would not have volunteered to tutor Zhu Baoguo when Elder Lee visited Qiao\u2019s house last time.It was just that more than half a month had passed. Qiao Zijin thought that nothing had been finalized. She never thought that it had been agreed upon and Qiao Nan had already started to tutor Zhu Baoguo.Ding Jiayi who sat beside her gave Qiao Zijin a kick. \u201cQiao Nan and your Dad knew what to do. There\u2019s no need for you to be concerned.\u201dThis child must be stupid. It would be Qiao Nan\u2019s problem if she did not do well in her exams.Since Qiao Nan had already given her promise, if she did not do well in her exams, she would never ask her parents to fork out five thousand yuan to enroll her into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.If she really did badly, she would not be shameless enough to continue with high school or college. It was an excellent idea for her to tutor Zhu Baoguo.Why would Zijin be so foolish?\u201cNan Nan, can you cope with it?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was stunned as well. This had never crossed his mind.But now that he knew about it, Qiao Dongliang was merely paying lip service. He did not seemed to be expecting a negative answer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQiao Nan replied coldly. \u201cI am full, I will go back to my room.\u201d\u201cGo ahead, there\u2019s no one to disturb you at home. Study hard, Dad believe that you can cope well.\u201d Qiao Dongliang now knew that tutoring Zhu Baoguo might affect Qiao Nan\u2019s studies.At the Lee house, Qiao Nan could not concentrate on her studies. But back at her house, she could pay full attention to her revision.Qiao Dongliang had told Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin not to disturb Qiao Nan when she was at home. He also forbade Ding Jiayi from asking Qiao Nan to help out with household chores. He wanted her to have all the time to study.This was Qiao Dongliang\u2019s way of compensating Qiao Nan.Since Qiao Nan could not help out, Qiao Zijin would have to do her share. It seemed like she also had some questions for her mother. \u201cMom, why did you stop me just now?\u201d\u201cYou are usually very bright, why would you do such a foolish thing now?\u201d Ding Jiayi bent down and peeped outside, checking to see if Qiao Dongliang and Qiao Nan had returned to their rooms. She then lowered her voice and said, \u201cZhu Baoguo is known for his bad temper, everyone in the quad who hung out with him before was bullied by him. With people like Zhu Baoguo around, Qiao Nan will not be able to concentrate on her studies. He would not obey her as well. Qiao Nan has given her promise, if she does not do well in her middle school exams, it would be your Dad\u2019s fault. Your Dad cannot possibly blame us for this. As long as she does badly in her exams, I will be able to come up with ways to make her quit school to work. By that time, the three of us will work to provide for your college fees. You can go to the best college in the Celestial Empire.\u201d\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Qiao Zijin pursued her lips in annoyance, with a hint of doubt in her voice. \u201cBut Mom, Grandpa Lee is a good man, he took care of Dad just because he was comrades with Grandpa. If Qiao Nan\u2019s studies fall behind after tutoring Zhu Baoguo, the Lee family and Zhu family would definitely do something about it. In any case, if Qiao Nan really did badly for her exams and wanted to work, it only take one word from Grandpa Lee to get her a good job.\u201dNo matter how hardworking and studious one was, it was useless compared to a word from a influential person. That was why Qiao Zijin did not put efforts in her studies. She felt that it was a waste of time to study.\u201cThat would be wonderful.\u201d Ding Jiayi was beaming with excitement. \u201cIf Qiao Nan landed a good job, she would definitely be paid well. You can concentrate on your studies. I heard that lots of people who had good results went overseas to study. Though the expenses would be higher, if Qiao Nan has a high paying job, she would be able to provide for you.\u201dDing Jiayi painted a beautiful picture in her mind. This was the first time that she felt that it was a good idea for Qiao Dongliang to take on the private job on behalf of Qiao Nan.Qiao Zijin laughed bitterly, go overseas to study?With her current results, not to mention studying overseas, she would have to do well for the next two and a half years so as to get into a good college.\u201cMom, Dad always placed a lot of importance on Qiao Nan and my studies. Why would he make such a decision?\u201d Qiao Zijin could not understand Qiao Dongliang\u2019s attitude.\u201cOthers might not understand your Dad, but I have been living with him for years, I know him inside out. Your Dad is indebted to Uncle Lee. He wanted to repay the debt of gratitude that he owed Uncle Lee. But he was discharged from the army when Qiao Nan was born. This has always been a knot in his heart. Now that he finally had a chance to mend his relationship with Uncle Lee and to repay his debts, your Dad was willing to sacrifice Qiao Nan\u2019s time for revision to help Uncle Lee. If taking the exams for someone else was allowed, he would even ask Qiao Nan to give up on her middle school exams and take the exams for Zhu Baoguo.\u201dHer mother\u2019s words gave her a scare. Qiao Zijin asked in shock, \u201cMy\u2014my\u2014my\u2014Dad will actually do this. If it\u2019s me, will he treat me in the same way?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Ding Jiayi said with confidence.\u201cWhy?\u201d Even if she might be an exception, Qiao Zijin had no confidence at all.When she heard her mother\u2019s words, Qiao Zijin was worried that what if there was a day that she had to be sacrificed in order to return Elder Lee\u2019s favor, her father would treat her in the way that he treated Qiao Nan.\u201cDo you think that it\u2019s only your Mom who favored sons? Your Dad favored sons as well, If not, we couldn\u2019t possibly have a second child. Though he kept silent about it, he wasn\u2019t that pleased after I gave birth to you.\u201dDing Jiayi sighed. After giving birth to the elder daughter, she had been through disappointment and frustration. But she and her husband had stable jobs, the three of them would still be able to lead a happy life.But in about two months after Qiao Zijin was born, Qiao Dongliang started to spend all his time in the army, coming with all sorts of excuses not to go home.If Qiao Dongliang was to stay in the army and worked hard, aiming for promotion, Ding Jiayi would not have anything to complain about.But during that period he committed several mistakes.He was thought to be the most likely candidate to be promoted to battalion commander, but after he committed the mistakes, his promotion was delayed for several years.On top of that, Ding Jiayi was antagonized by her mother for not being able to bear sons. She then decided to give up everything to have a second child, hoping that they would have a son.As expected, after she brought up this suggestion, it didn\u2019t take very long or much persuasion for Qiao Dongliang to agree to leaving the army to have a second child.Qiao Zijin was boiling in anger at the mention of the topic of having sons. But Ding Jiayi\u2019s words that followed after appeased her anger.\u201cAfter giving birth to Qiao Nan, your Dad was so disappointed that he was not in the mood to work. I told him we could always treat you as a son and give you all the support and guidance that we would give to a son. We could take in a son-in-law to bear the bride\u2019s family name. In that case, there would be no difference between a son and a daughter. That\u2019s the reason why you get to wear new clothes every year while Qiao Nan could only wear your hand-me-down and use those that you discarded. Your Dad never said anything about it or take the initiative to buy anything for her. That\u2019s because Qiao Nan would eventually get married and leave the family, but you would be staying with us. But I didn\u2019t know that your Dad would give her some money here and there, and that she would seize the opportunity to save up the money.\u201dQiao Zijin had no idea that there was more to it behind her differential treatment at home.If her mother told her father that Qiao Nan should stay with the family and they would take in a son-in-law for her, would she and Qiao Nan be treated in a vastly different manner now?Luckily she was the child that her mother doted on and Qiao Nan was not.Qiao Zijin hugged Ding Jiayi\u2019s arm and said affectionately, \u201cMom, you are so good to me.\u201d\u201cOf course, you are the only one that I dote on. Don\u2019t disappoint me, keep up the good work. When it\u2019s New Year time, do well in your exams and make me proud.\u201d Ding Jiayi was delighted at her beloved daughter\u2019s affectionate gestures.\u201cMom, don\u2019t worry. I will work hard.\u201d Qiao Zijin smiled, if her father saw her to be as important as a son, even if her results are not satisfactory, her father would not ask her to give up on her studies. This piece of news was akin to granting her amnesty.To think that back then she feared that with her poor results and the lack of money at home, she might be the one who had to quit school and work. Hence she opened the windows in Qiao Nan\u2019s room in the middle of the night, hoping that Qiao Nan would come down with sickness, and she would be the only one at home who was still studying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She swung her barely wet hands and was about to leave.Qiao Zijin turned around and saw Qiao Nan standing by the kitchen doorway with a cup in her hand. She was staring directly at her. Qiao Zijin shrieked in alarm, her heart in her throat. \u201cNan\u2026 Nan Nan, wh-why are you here?\u201dHad Nan Nan overheard the conversation that she had with Ding Jiayi? How much of the conversation did she overhear?Ding Jiayi was also shocked at the sudden appearance of Qiao Nan, not to mention Qiao Zijin.Ding Jiayi might be capable of ruthless and shameless acts, but she could not bring herself to say it or admit it in front of Qiao Nan, especially when she had been caught unawares by her.\u201cI want to pour myself a drink.\u201d Qiao Nan waved at the cup in her hands and shot an aloof look at Qiao Zijin, \u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Qiao Zijin smiled awkwardly. This was not her concern at all. \u201cNan Nan, let me pour you a drink?\u201dQiao Zijin just found out the truth from Ding Jiayi behind her father\u2019s attitude towards she and Qiao Nan. She had a guilty conscience when she saw Qiao Nan and felt sorry for her.\u201cNo need, I am okay.\u201d Qiao Nan was not the least bit happy at Qiao Zijin\u2019s efforts to please her. In fact she had goosebumps all over her.Her experience from the two lifetimes told her that whenever Qiao Zijin treated her with a slightly better attitude, there must be something that she wanted from her.She would rather be treated with arrogance and coldness, than to face Qiao Zijin\u2019s smiling countenance.After Qiao Nan poured herself a drink and left the kitchen, Qiao Zijin asked Ding Jiayi, \u201cMom, do you think Qiao Nan overheard our conversation or not?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think she has overheard our conversation. She would not have had this kind of reaction.\u201d Ding Jiayi breathed a sigh of relief as well.\u201cLuckily she didn\u2019t.\u201d Qiao Zijin patted her chest, she had the shock of her life at seeing Qiao Nan.Ding Jiayi might have nothing to fear regarding Qiao Nan, but it was not the same for Qiao Zijin. She was not ready to lose this younger sister totally.\u201cAlright, you should go and do your schoolwork. I will finish up the chores. Even if that wretched girl did overhear our conversation, it was nothing but the truth. Besides it was all your father\u2019s doing. It has nothing to do with us. Good girl, go back to your room.\u201d Ding Jiayi patted Qiao Zijin on the shoulder. She was no longer preoccupied with Qiao Nan\u2019s attitude.Ding Jiayi had never been affected by Qiao Nan\u2019s attitude.\u201cOkay.\u201d Qiao Zijin returned to her room in high spirits. Even if her results were not as good as Qiao Nan\u2019s, she was the most important person in the house. There was no way that Qiao Nan could compete with her.It turned out that her father was also biased towards her. Though compared to her mother, he might be slightly fairer.At the thought of this, Qiao Zijin felt cool and refreshed, as if she had a glass of spring water in the hot summer.While Qiao Zijin rolled around in happiness on her bed, Qiao Nan as usual was poring over her books, studying conscientiously.The weekend flew past, Qiao Zijin went back to The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, while Qiao Nan stuck to her usual routine \u2013 going to school, the Zhai\u2019s house and Qiao\u2019s house.This day, someone from the reception office informed Qiao Nan that someone had left her a parcel, notifying her to collect it.Qiao Nan was confused. Someone sent her a parcel? Who would that be?That was impossible.Had the staff at the reception office made a mistake? There was only one Qiao Nan in the whole school, but could there be homonyms?Qiao Nan went to the reception office and raised her doubts. But the staff said that the person who made the delivery had gave her name and even stated the class that she was in.Unless there were two persons by the name of Qiao Nan in Secondary three (1) class, this delivery was meant for Qiao Nan.After hearing what the staff from the reception office said, Qiao Nan could only take the parcel with her. When she returned to the classroom, many of the classmates stole glances at her, staring at her while she walked in.The end of the 20th century was unlike the 21st century where parcel delivery was very common. It was very rare that someone sent a parcel and left it at the reception office.\u201cHmph.\u201d Zhao Yu snorted in annoyance. There was nothing to be smug about, it was just a delivery. If she wanted a parcel, she could also ask her mother to send her one.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Her desk mate Zhu Baoguo craned his neck like a swan, with his eyes fixed on Qiao Nan. He was dying to get his hand on the parcel and to see for himself what was inside.\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Unlike people her age who were impatient and fretful, Qiao Nan was calm and composed. She took her time to open the parcel.The parcel was squarish and heavy. Qiao Nan surmised that it might have been books.As expected, when she opened the parcel, there were books inside. In fact, there were revision books.There were revision books for the sciences subjects.Qiao Nan flipped the books open. There were simple explanations and concepts inside the revision books. These books were hard to find in the times now. Most people would not be able to buy them.To Qiao Nan, these books came at an opportune time. She was thrilled to have these books.Qiao Nan had been worrying about her weak foundation in sciences subjects. Despite revising and grasping some of the simple arithmetic concepts, she would be confused whenever she applied all of the arithmetic concepts simultaneously. It was undoubtedly a timely help to Qiao Nan.Qiao Nan was not worried about those questions that required the application of a single concept. Her biggest worry was those complicated questions that required her to apply multiple concepts.In the Celestial Empire, the exams placed a big focus on doing huge amounts of exercises and problem sums. To Qiao Nan, it would definitely be useful to do lots of practises and exercises.\u201cOh, we do not have these books here. There are very popular in the national capital as well, but there aren\u2019t many in stock. Which of your friends is so nice to send you this as a gift?\u201d Zhu Baoguo could tell at one glance that the books were not easily available.Of course, people like him could get their hands on anything they wanted.Zhu Baoguo had a cousin who once flaunted this volume of books to him. His intention was to make him jealous. But Zhu Baoguo was unaffected, he did not even bother to take a glance at the books.\u201cIt was this popular?\u201d Qiao Nan was stunned. She was unfamiliar with the consumer market here.But who would have sent her these books, could it be\u2026Impossible.A person came to her mind. But Qiao Nan shook her head, intuition told her that it could not be him. But if it was not him, Qiao Nan could not think of another person who would do this for her.It was impossible that the relatives of Qiao\u2019s family would buy these books. Her father had no relatives, as for the relatives from her mother\u2019s side, it was all the more impossible for them to buy these books.All her blood relations would not buy it for her. If her closest kin would not put in these efforts, who in the world would be so nice to her?\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d Zhu Baoguo prodded her shoulder, \u201cYou really have no idea who bought you these books?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The reception office might have the wrong person. You had better handle the books with care and do not make any scribblings. If not, you might not be able to pay for the books.\u201d Zhao Yu gloated at the thought. There was no way that someone would give Qiao Nan these books as a present.\u201cIt\u2019s only worth a few yuan, why can\u2019t my sister afford it?\u201d Zhu Baoguo glared at her in anger.\u201cZhu Baoguo, you may be rich, but that\u2019s your business. Qiao Nan did not have the money. Qiao Nan, you are not thinking of using Zhu Baoguo\u2019s money to pay for the books?\u201dThe more protective Zhu Baoguo was of Qiao Nan, the more frustrated Zhao Yu was.Zhao Yu was aware that Zhu Baoguo and Zhu family had lots of money. She could tell from the fact that someone drove him to school every morning.In this school, there were not many students who had a chauffeur to take them to school. Zhu Baoguo came from an established family.\u201cYou do not have to worry about that.\u201d Qiao Nan kept the books. Zhao Yu\u2019s words might be hurtful but they made sense. Even if the staff at the reception office made it very clear that the sender had specified that the parcel was for her, it would not hurt to be careful.Besides, there was no need to make notes on the books. She had lots of rough paper. Her teachers were very generous with rough paper.Zhu Baoguo found it incredulous that Qiao Nan could maintain her composure despite Zhao Yu\u2019s hurtful words. \u201cShe was trying to mess with you, yet you are not angry?\u201d\u201cThat would be a waste of energy and time.\u201d\u201cWhy does she always say that of you? Are you very poor?\u201dQiao Nan who was reading the books paused for a second, \u201cI have always been poor.\u201dIn her previous lifetime, in the eight years of school before she quit and started to work, she had never once used a new eraser or a new pen. All of her stationery was that which Qiao Zijin had no use of.As time passed, her classmates eventually noticed that.In her previous lifetime, part of the reason why Qiao Nan quit school and submitted to Ding Jiayi\u2019s wishes was also due to that.Unlike Zhao Yu who would laugh and tease her to her face, in her previous life, most people would talk behind her back. Qiao Nan had overheard their conversations for a few times.As a child growing up in that kind of environment, this gossiping and badmouthing would hurt one\u2019s feelings, not to mention the fact that children at this age were very sensitive.At that time Qiao Nan was only a child, she could not take all the gossiping and grew to be very quiet in class. Other than her teachers, no one liked her.In this lifetime, Qiao Nan was still used to being alone, she did not intend to make friends. But at the very least she would no longer feel ashamed when people made hurtful remarks just like what Zhao Yu had said to her just now.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have the money.\u201d Zhu Baoguo patted his chest out of loyalty. He had nothing except loads of money.\u201cSilly.\u201d Qiao Nan rolled her eyes at Zhu Baoguo. No wonder he was beaten up by hooligans. What a bad mouth he had. He was not good with words and was not likable at all.\u201cYou are the silly one. Lots of people are queuing up to have my money. But it all depends on my mood. I am offering it to you, yet you reject me?\u201d When Zhu Baoguo was not at school, he would always have a bunch of sidekicks with him.\u201cYou are comparing me with them? Why didn\u2019t these people come to your help when you were beaten to a pulp?\u201d Qiao Nan laughed.Zhu Baoguo was just like a deflated balloon, he was stumped for words. \u201cI wanted to be nice to you.\u201dCupping her chin in her hands, Qiao Nan looked askance at Zhu Baoguo. \u201cYour Mom passed away at an early age, I have a Mom, shall I share my Mom with you?\u201dIf her mother had a son like Zhu Baoguo, she would be thrilled. She would definitely treat him well as if he was her biological son.\u201cYou are courting death!\u201d Zhu Baoguo smashed his fists on the table, his eyes red in anger. \u201cMother\u201d was a taboo for Zhu Baoguo. Whoever said it would be in for trouble.\u201cLook, isn\u2019t it the same?\u201d Other people might be afraid of Zhu Baoguo, but Qiao Nan was not. \u201cI may be poor now, but I will earn lots of money in the future. I do not need your money.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zhu Baoguo could not stay angry but he was also displeased with her words. Looking at Qiao Nan, he could not wait to bite at something to ease his frustration.Zhu Baoguo jumped around in frustration, as if he had ticks on him. Qiao Nan looked at him and sighed, \u201cThis character of mine, I do not know how to get along well with others and would offend others unknowingly. I have a sharp tongue and my words might hurt others.\u201dQiao Nan could sense that Zhu Baoguo was sincere and genuine about making friends with her.It was rare that someone treated her with kindness, she could not bear to shut him out.But this was her personality. There were some habits that she just could not change.To put it bluntly, both of them were problematic kids, it would be difficult to get along with each other.\u201cI am a man, I wouldn\u2019t argue with you.\u201d Zhu Baoguo\u2019s eyes spewed fire. But Qiao Nan\u2019s explanation doused his anger. It was as if ice water was being poured over the blazing fire.Qiao Nan arched her eyebrows in surprise when she saw that Zhu Baoguo had calmed down and was no longer angry with her.Zhu Baoguo was known for his bad temper. Most people would not be able to accept her explanation, yet Zhu Baoguo accepted it. He was a good kid after all.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to look at, didn\u2019t you say that you would rather look at the books than at me? Look at your books!\u201d Zhu Baoguo blushed in embarrassment. He covered Qiao Nan\u2019s face with the books, avoiding her eyes.Qiao Nan laughed. It seemed like Zhu Baoguo would make a worthy friend.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to laugh about? To show off your white teeth?\u201d Zhu Baoguo had relaxed and was no longer angry.Zhu Baoguo knew that those \u201cbrothers\u201d that followed him around in the past were only after his money, they were not sincere in making friends with him. They hung around him for his money, but would be the first to run off when he was in trouble.But Qiao Nan was different. She had saved his life and ever since knowing him, despite his prominent family background, she had never sucked up to him or asked him for favors. Even if he wanted to treat her differently, she also refused vehemently.Zhu Baoguo was not stupid, he could tell if one was sincere or not.If one could have a sincere and loyal friend, no one would like to mix with fair-weather friends. But it was just that Zhu Baoguo had never had the chance in the past.Zhao Yu\u2019s eyes reddened, she was full of anger and jealousy when she saw how unaffected Zhu Baoguo was by Qiao Nan\u2019s blunt words, and that they seemed to be closer than before.She remembered there was once when someone mentioned about Zhu Baoguo\u2019s late mother in front of him, and Zhu Baoguo gave that person a furious kick.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was unfair.Zhao Yu who was thinking about this did not realize that there was no fairness in these things. There was no valid reason behind her enmity towards Qiao Nan as well.No matter how bitter Zhao Yu felt, Qiao Nan and Zhu Baoguo had been getting along well with each other.Time flew past. Qiao Nan had just started to make changes to her sorrowful life that she had in the previous lifetime. But in a blink, half of the semester had passed.Qiao Nan and Qiao Zijin were both preparing for their mid-term exams.Qiao Nan was better prepared compared to the last time. In fact, she was looking forward to the mid-term exams. She wanted to know how her revision was going.Even if the exams might not be an accurate indication of how she did for her revision, at the very least she would have a rough gauge of her standard.As compared to Qiao Nan who was full of anticipation, Zhu Baoguo did not have confidence in the exams. \u201cIf I did not do well, would you\u2026 Would you look down on me?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it normal for you not to do well?\u201d Qiao Nan arched her eyebrows. She had only tutored Zhu Baoguo for about a month, unless he cheated in the exams, if not it was impossible for him to do well.\u201cRight, forget that I said it.\u201d Qiao Nan\u2019s words might seemed like she was looking down on Zhu Baoguo, but what she said was the truth.They had known each other for more than a month. Zhu Baoguo had been used to her way of speaking. She would not beat about the bush and she would always hurt others inadvertently with her blunt truths.School ended earlier as the students were having exams. Qiao Nan did not feel like going home, so she went to the Lee house with Zhu Baoguo to do revision.Elder Lee knew that according to the school schedule, his grandson was in the midst of his mid-term exams.He thought of asking about his exams.Elder Lee had neglected his grandson for years. Now that he wanted to mend their relationship, he realized that he had no idea how to communicate with him.Besides, his grandson never used to put his mind into studying. He should not harbor any hopes of him doing well for his exams.Especially when he saw that as soon as his grandson and Qiao Nan reached Lee house, he did not play around, instead he took out his books and started reading.Upon seeing that, Elder Lee told himself, it was within his expectation if his grandson had done badly for his exams. But even so, he was still happy with his change of attitude.By the time Qiao Nan reached home, everyone was home. Despite a day of work, Ding Jiayi was not tired, she hung around Qiao Zijin, asking about her results for the mid-term exams.Ding Jiayi had a job now and she got to know more people. Moreover she had two daughters, thus she naturally knew that her daughters would be having mid-term exams around this time of the year.\u201cNan Nan is back.\u201d Qiao Dongliang was full of smiles, his tone full of affection.Qiao Nan arched her eyebrows when she saw the attitude of her parents. It seemed that Qiao Zijin had done pretty well in her mid-term exams.It would be a festive mood in the Qiao family whenever Qiao Zijin did well in her exams. But when Qiao Nan had good results, she would only get a \u201cGood\u201d from Qiao Dongliang.\u201cNan Nan, your sister had her mid-term exams. How about you?\u201d Unlike the cold and indifferent attitude of Ding Jiayi, Qiao Dongliang was concerned about Qiao Nan.\u201cI had my exams, I just finished them today.\u201d Qiao Nan put down her bag and poured herself a cup of water.In Elder Lee\u2019s house, their nanny would always serve her tea, but she was used to drinking plain water.\u201cHow do you think you did for your exams?\u201d\u201cNo idea, I have to see the results to know.\u201d Qiao Nan felt good about her exams, she felt more confident compared to her last exams.But it seemed that Qiao Zijin had done well in her exams, hence Qiao Nan did not bother to say too much, lest she dampen her parents\u2019 high spirits.When Qiao Zijin was in the limelight, it would not be good for Qiao Nan to steal her limelight, if not her mother would not let her off.Qiao Zijin was happy at Qiao Nan\u2019s words, she lifted her chin and said, \u201cNan Nan did you flunk your exams like last time? You should have an idea of how you do for the exams. But it\u2019s okay, do not be too anxious. I can catch up on my grades, so can you. Besides your results have always been good.\u201d\u201cYou really flunked your exams?\u201d Qiao Dongliang\u2019s countenance wobbled, could it be that Nan Nan\u2019s results were affected as she had to tutor Baoguo?If so, should she continue to tutor Baoguo?At the next moment, Qiao Dongliang put his heart to rest. If Qiao Nan did not do well in her exams, he would not need to say another word, and the Lee family would get another tutor for Zhu Baoguo. After all, if Qiao Nan\u2019s results were as bad as Zhu Baoguo, she could not help him.By that time, when the younger daughter no longer needed to tutor Zhu Baoguo, she would have more time for revision and would be able to catch up.\u201cI am not too sure. It\u2019s more or less that way.\u201d Qiao Nan did not cherish much hope for Qiao Dongliang. She gave a faint smile and did not say much as usual.\u201cIn terms of studies, as one advances to another level, it gets more and more difficult, but this should be the case. As the saying goes, \u2018A man at five may be a fool at fifteen\u2019, Zijin is so smart and hardworking.\u201d Ding Jiayi felt proud and elated, she could finally hold her head high.Five thousand yuan was nothing. No matter how much it was worth, it was incomparable to the future and prospects of the elder daughter.The teachers at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China were really capable, better than the others.When Ding Jiayi was at work, she would always chat with her colleagues about Qiao Zijin who studied at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.Everyone in Ping Cheng knew about The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. Anyone who managed to enroll into the high school must have been very intelligent and had good future prospects.When her colleagues heard that Ding Jiayi\u2019s daughter was studying at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, they were full of praise for Qiao Zijin, saying that she must be very smart and that she would be successful in the future. Ding Jiayi could be assured that she could lead a good life.Ding Jiayi found it inappropriate to tell them that her daughter did not do very well for her middle school exams and that she spent some money to enroll her into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.If not she would love to tell them that the teachers at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China were really capable. After studying at the high school, Qiao Zijin who was once an average student had improved tremendously and was the top student now.Ding Jiayi had absolute trust in Qiao Zijin\u2019s words. It never crossed her mind that if the teachers at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China were capable of creating miracles, making a silk purse out of a sow\u2019s ear, The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China would be full of top students, no one would have bad results.\u201cDon\u2019t be anxious, since Zijin managed to catch up on her results, Nan Nan can do it as well.\u201d Qiao Dongliang looked at Ding Jiayi in disapproval.\u201cHow could it be the same? How can the teachers at the other schools be comparable to the teachers at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China?\u201d In this life, Qiao Nan could never have the chance of studying at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. Therefore there was no way that she could catch up on her studies.\u201cThat\u2019s simple. Since Zijin can study at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, why can\u2019t Nan Nan?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We do not have so much money at home!\u201d Ding Jiayi turned green with anger. She did not wish to see that Qiao Nan and Qiao Zijin had the same treatment.\u201cI have said before, you will take care of Zijin while I am in charge of Nan Nan. I wouldn\u2019t take the money from our house. If she really did badly, I will think of other ways.\u201d Qiao Dongliang looked at Ding Jiayi with a forced smile on his face. \u201cIf I do not have the abilities, there would be someone who has the abilities.\u201d\u201cMom, I am hungry, shall we make dinner?\u201d Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi were about to break into a fight and the topic made Qiao Zijin uncomfortable. She cut in and tried to stop them.Her mother had spent all the money at home. If her father wanted to send Qiao Nan to The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, he would have to seek Grandpa Lee\u2019s help to fork out a sum of money.Her father would definitely have to borrow that money.Anything borrowed had to be returned.If their family had external debts and had not enough to feed all of them, given her character, her mother would definitely tighten the purse strings and cut down on her allowances so as to save the money to repay the debts.All said, the money that was supposed to be spent on her would then be used for Qiao Nan\u2019s enrollment.Most importantly, when Qiao Dongliang mentioned that he might look for external help, Qiao Zijin was worried that he might seek Elder Lee\u2019s help. He might spill the truth about the secret to her enrollment.Her mother had gathered that the Qiao family and Lee family had not been in contact with each other for ages.Since they had not been keeping in touch, Grandpa Lee would help them on the account that it was the last request that the Qiao family had of him.By then, she would have settled the enrollment problem and her father would not find out the truth. This would be kept a secret forever.But now that Qiao family and Lee family were in contact with each other, if Grandpa Lee was to tell her father about the truth, Qiao Zijin could not imagine the thunderstorms that would be stirred up in her family.After pulling Ding Jiayi to the kitchen, Qiao Zijin said, \u201cMom, stop picking on Nan Nan in front of Dad. We are the ones who would suffer in the end.\u201d In particular her!\u201cAs long as Qiao Nan has agreed to it, it doesn\u2019t matter how Dad thinks about it. But if you continue with your ways and agitate Dad, he might borrow money from Grandpa Lee to get Qiao Nan into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. By then, not only would we have a lot of external debts, Grandpa Lee might mention my enrollment to Dad. What do you think his reaction will be?\u201dEven if there was no way for Qiao Nan to quit school and work, her mother should try to cut down on Qiao Nan\u2019s expenses, lest her father spent too much of his hard-earned money on her.Her mother had always been quarreling with her father. Because of all these quarrels, her father had given the money that was meant for her to Qiao Nan instead!\u201cIf he could seek Uncle Lee\u2019s help for Qiao Nan, he would not dare to raise his voice at me if he finds out that I have been to Grandpa Lee regarding your enrollment. Aren\u2019t they the same?\u201d Ding Jiayi refused to admit defeat, but her tone calmed down. \u201cForget it, I will not pick on that wretched girl on your account. It would be a waste of my time and energy to pick on her.\u201d\u201cMom, it\u2019s good that you can straighten out your thoughts.\u201d Qiao Zijin was relieved that Ding Jiayi was willing to listen to her.Qiao Zijin noticed that whenever her parents quarreled, Qiao Nan would be the one who benefited from it, while she was the one on the losing end.During dinnertime, Ding Jiayi had a change of attitude, she no longer picked on Qiao Nan. Instead she concentrated on praising Qiao Zijin, saying that she would definitely be able to get into a first tier university and study at the capital.When Qiao Zijin found a job, settled down and have a family at the capital, she and Qiao Dongliang would stay with Qiao Zijin at the capital, leading a life of leisure and comfort.Qiao Dongliang\u2019s countenance did not changed when he heard Ding Jiayi\u2019s words, in fact his silence seemed to say that he agreed with her.Qiao Nan buried her face and laughed at her parents\u2019 reaction.In the previous life, Qiao Zijin was married to Chen Jun, she stayed in a small villa and had a limousine. But even so, she did not give a single cent to her parents, in fact, they had to give her money instead.In this life, it sounded amusing and hilarious to say that Qiao Zijin would take care of her parents and let them live in comfort.It reminded her of a popular saying years later: Fantasy is always good, but the reality is always cruel.Qiao Nan who was well aware of Qiao Zijin\u2019s selfishness, could not help but hand it to her when she looked to be in high spirits at her mother\u2019s words.The Qiao Zijin in this life would not have agreed to her mother\u2019s words as well. When her mother said that Qiao Zijin would have to bear the responsibility of taking care of her parents, she could still talk animatedly without batting an eyelid and nodded in agreement to her mother\u2019s words. Qiao Nan smirked, it was no wonder that she was totally defeated by Qiao Zijin in the previous life.Even in this life, she could never match up to the glib-tongued Qiao Zijin.On Sunday, Ding Jiayi sent off Qiao Zijin in high spirits, with hopes that she would bring back good news with her. The next day morning, Qiao Dongliang thought for a while and said to Qiao Nan, \u201cDon\u2019t be too worried or give yourself too much stress. It\u2019s okay if you did not do well. It\u2019s only half of a semester. Besides, there\u2019s still half a year to go. We can take things slowly. Even if you really did badly, as long as you wanted to study, I will definitely support you.\u201dAs for whether he would fork out the money for Qiao Nan to enroll into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China like Qiao Zijin, Qiao Dongliang dared not make a promise right now.\u201cThank you, Dad.\u201d Qiao Nan gave Qiao Dongliang a relaxed smile, took her bag and left before him.\u201cHmph, she is really shameless. She could still smile when she did badly in her exams.\u201d Ding Jiayi had a look of disdain on her face as she watched Qiao Nan left the house.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Qiao Dongliang snarled and chided Ding Jiayi. \u201cHave you forgotten what I said previously? You have no say over Nan Nan\u2019s affairs. Since you don\u2019t wish to take care of her, then you have to relinquish all your authority over her. Not a word from you ever.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d Ding Jiayi muttered grumpily. \u201cI am going off to work, remember to close all the doors and windows before leaving.\u201dShe did not have the time and effort to pick on Qiao Nan.Rather than wasting time on Qiao Nan, she would rather think of ways to work hard and to earn more money so as to send Zijin to the university and for overseas studies.\u201cYou are here?\u201d Zhu Baoguo reached school earlier than Qiao Nan.\u201cYou are so early?\u201d Qiao Nan\u2019s eyes flickered in surprise. \u201cHas hell frozen over?\u201dEver since coming back to school, though Zhu Baoguo did not play truant or arrive late, he was never this early before.\u201cI woke up early today, is there anything wrong?\u201d Zhu Baoguo turned his face sideways, avoiding Qiao Nan\u2019s eyes. Whenever she looked into his eyes, he had the feeling that he could hide nothing from her. It was so strange, after all she was just a young lady.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She knew that if she was to continue, Zhu Baoguo might turn hostile.The first lesson in the morning was the form teacher, Teacher Chen\u2019s lessons, Mathematics. Teacher Chen walked into the classroom in high spirits.Most of the students breathed a sigh of relief when they saw Teacher Chen\u2019s expression. It seemed like they did not do too badly in the exams.It was the mid-term exams after all, the second most important exams in a semester. Very few students could be indifferent towards their results, especially when they were in a good class.\u201cFor this mid-term exams, the class\u2019s results were satisfactory. I am very pleased that some of the students have made improvements.\u201d Teacher Chen cast a glance in the direction of Qiao Nan.Those students who noticed Teacher Chen\u2019s expression make noises at their seats. It seemed that Teacher Chen was in high spirits as Qiao Nan had done well. The teacher was so good to Qiao Nan.\u201cBut everyone must bear this in mind, one must be humble in victory and gracious in defeat. We must continue to work hard and make improvements. I will hand out the papers now. Qiao Nan.\u201dTeacher Chen did not announce the results, but Qiao Nan\u2019s paper was placed on the top of the stack. It was obvious that Teacher Chen had taken a look at the papers before arriving at the classroom.A lot of the students craned their necks trying to get a glimpse of Qiao Nan\u2019s results. But she folded the papers in half as soon as she received it and returned to her seat.Everyone could only see the ticks on the questions, with no indication of any deduction in marks.\u201c100 points?\u201d Zhu Baoguo arched his eyebrows. His desk mate was so extraordinary, her results were truly outstanding.\u201cIt would be good if its 100 points.\u201d Qiao Nan sighed. \u201c98 points.\u201dQiao Nan had a rough gauge of her marks before receiving her papers.She was confident about the new knowledge learned in this semester. But the last question in the \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d section of the Maths paper was much more complicated and difficult. Even though she did not leave it blank, she had no confidence in getting it correct.As expected, she saw a cross on that question, and two marks being deducted.\u201cThat\u2019s a very good result.\u201d Zhu Baoguo said in surprise. \u201cDid you think that it would be that easy to score 90 points and above and that it was that common to score 95 points and above just like in the elementary school?\u201dHe clicked his tongue. For him, it would be marvelous if he could score 89 points, not to mention 98 points.Though Qiao Nan and Zhu Baoguo were whispering to each other, a lot of the students had overheard their conversation. They were all surprised at Qiao Nan\u2019s grade of 98 points.No wonder Teacher Chen said that Qiao Nan had made tremendous improvements. She was only a few marks short of a perfect score. It was not easy to get this result.She was the top student after all. It was only not long ago that she fell below her standard. Yet she had got back on track in such a short period of time.By the time everyone got their papers, Teacher Chen said, \u201cThe highest score in our class for Mathematics was 98 points. But the highest score in the level was 99.5 points. That student left out a period in the answer. We must put in extra efforts and to take this as a learning example, not to commit the same mistake. This deduction of half a point is a pity, isn\u2019t it?\u201dA sheer pity.If not for the period, it could have been a perfect score. There was nothing that was more unjust than this.\u201cAlright let\u2019s analyze the papers now.\u201d Teacher Chen went through the papers quickly, highlighting the parts where most of the students did not answer correctly. Of course, the question in \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d section with a hundred percent failure rate was the main highlight of the discussion.\u201cAlright, the lesson is over.\u201dQiao Nan waited for Teacher Chen to leave the classroom before stretching her hand towards Zhu Baoguo, \u201cDon\u2019t hide it anymore, let me take a look at your paper.\u201d\u201cNo, why should I give my paper to you?\u201d Zhu Baoguo stiffened, he wished that he could tear up his papers right in front of Qiao Nan.As compared to Qiao Nan\u2019s paper which had such pretty results, Zhu Baoguo\u2019s paper was just like the scene of a traffic accident, it was a horrible sight to see.\u201cWould I not know where\u2019s your standard? Do you think I would have other thoughts after looking at your papers?\u201d Qiao Nan sighed. If she was to judge someone based on results, she would not have wasted her time on Zhu Baoguo.\u201cElder Lee only wanted me to keep an eye on you, he did not want me to make sure that you do well for your exams. I wanted to look at your papers as I treated you as my friend. If you do not wish for me to look at your paper, I won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cGo ahead and have a look.\u201d Zhu Baoguo was appeased by Qiao Nan\u2019s words. He relaxed his tight lips and handed the papers to Qiao Nan reluctantly.Qiao Nan was as calm as the dead sea when she looked at her papers, But when she looked at Zhu Baoguo\u2019s papers, she widened her eyes and had a look of surprise on her face.Zhu Baoguo\u2019s face reddened in anger. \u201cYou, you hand it back to me!\u201d Didn\u2019t she say that she would not judge someone based on results. What does Xiao Qiao mean by her expression? Were his results way below her expectations?\u201cZhu Baoguo, I have realized that you are very bright.\u201d Qiao Nan praised him while looking through his papers.\u201cQiao Nan, are you praising Zhu Baoguo or mocking him?\u201d Zhao Yu smirked. Everyone knew where Zhu Baoguo\u2019s standard was, it would have been difficult for someone like him who never turn up for school to pass the exams. How could Zhu Baoguo be associated with being bright?If Qiao Nan wanted to suck up to Zhu Baoguo, she should not have gone to such extremes.Zhu Baoguo glared in anger, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dQiao Nan might not be the type who would mock him, but it would be impossible to praise him.Nobody would praise him for having such a bad result. He could not bring himself to say his own grades.\u201cTake a look at it yourself.\u201d Qiao Nan placed the papers in front of Zhu Baoguo. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been to school for a long time. I went through the new knowledge that was taught in this semester with you. This few questions, and this question, and the other few questions. You have got the answers correctly for most of the questions that tested on the topics that I covered with you. As for those that you answered wrongly, they were all those that I did not go through with you. Zhu Baoguo, you are really quite brilliant. I only went through them once with you, yet you can take in all the information and concepts.\u201dQiao Nan meant it with her sincerest heart when she praised Zhu Baoguo.Zhu Baoguo definitely had the knack for Science subjects.After Qiao Nan\u2019s detailed explanation, Zhu Baoguo knew that Qiao Nan meant it from the bottom of her heart when she praised him.Zhu Baoguo was used to being scolded. As it was the first time someone had praised him, he blushed in embarrassment and felt awkward. \u201cThat, that, as long as I put my heart into it, there\u2019s nothing that I wouldn\u2019t excel in. Of course, you have done a good job teaching me.\u201dCompared to the teachers that his grandpa hired for him previously, other than their temper, they were also not good in teaching. He could not take in what they said at all.\u201cKeep up the good work, you would surpass me and make huge improvements in the future.\u201d Qiao Nan could feel the pressure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was normal for her to improve gradually.But it was different for Zhu Baoguo. He was not the least bit interested, he was dragged into studying by Qiao Nan.He did not put in much effort yet he made tremendous improvements. Compared to her, Zhu Baoguo had the talent for studying.\u201cCome, explain to me how to solve this problem.\u201d Zhu Baoguo lifted his chin, proud of Qiao Nan\u2019s surprised expression.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s bring out your Mathematics book first. Let\u2019s go through some knowledge points before we talk about the solutions.\u201dThe second lesson was Chinese. As compared to the joyous expression on Teacher Chen\u2019s face, Teacher Lee only looked slightly better than last time. \u201cHand out the papers, have a look and do some reflection.\u201dObviously Teacher Lee\u2019s words was directed at Qiao Nan.\u201cTeacher Lee, I will give out the papers.\u201d Zhao Yu smiled. She scored lower than Qiao Nan for Maths, but judging from Teacher Lee\u2019s expression, she definitely scored better than Qiao Nan!She was all thrilled to hand out the papers. She still remembered that previously Qiao Nan scored 85 points while she scored 89 points.\u201cAlright, take them.\u201d Teacher Lee passed the papers to Zhao Yu.Zhao Yu knew which group the students belonged to. She only had to hand the papers to the person sitting in the first row and they would pass down the papers. She was quite efficient in handing down the papers.While handing out the papers, Zhao Yu saw her results\u201488 points, it was not too bad, though her result last time was higher by one mark.She finally reached Qiao Nan\u2019s papers. As soon as she saw Qiao Nan\u2019s name on the papers, her eyes searched for the results. Her smile froze on her face. 92 marks?!Zhao Yu was stunned, she stopped handing out the papers and started to flip through Qiao Nan\u2019s paper. She couldn\u2019t believe that Qiao Nan would score above 90 marks for her Chinese in such a short period of time. The teachers must have made a mistake.She saw that Qiao Nan\u2019s essay had the same score as before, only one mark was deducted from the essay. On the other hand, five marks was deducted from Zhao Yu\u2019s essay. Looking at Qiao Nan\u2019s essay, she felt as if she was being slapped on the face.\u201cZhao Yu, this is Qiao Nan\u2019s paper. Aren\u2019t you going to give them out? The student who sat in front of Nan Nan saw that Zhao Yu stood frozen on the spot with Qiao Nan\u2019s papers and made no move to hand them out. The student said out of impatience, \u201cNo matter how you stare at it, Qiao Nan scored 92 points for her Chinese, it couldn\u2019t be wrong.\u201dThe student\u2019s accusation made a defeated Zhao Yu flush in embarrassment.She clenched her fist and tried to contain the tears swimming in her eyes. She handed out the rest of the papers in silence and returned to her seat.She did not hear a single word of what Teacher Lee said thereafter.When the school bells rang, Zhao Yu sat bent motionless over her desk.When it was time for lessons, her desk mate Zhou Lei noticed that Zhao Yu\u2019s eyes looked red and puffy, as if she had just cried.Zhou Lei twitched his lips. What was there to cry about? She must be sick.Like the last time, the results for the three subjects were out.As compared to last time, Qiao Nan\u2019s total score for the three subjects had increased by 20 points. Her ranking in the level had jumped to the top ten, and she was ranked among the top three in her class. She had gotten back on track, to her usual standard.\u201cYou are really awesome.\u201d Zhu Baoguo was all excited at Qiao Nan\u2019s results. No wonder his grandpa would get him a peer to coach him. He never imagined that Xiao Qiao would do so well for her exams.\u201cIt was average.\u201d Qiao Nan was not really happy. She could have these results as it was only junior high exams.If the exams were on the combined knowledge points of the three years of junior high school, she had no idea how she would fare.Qiao Nan\u2019s focus was on the combined exams, not on the exams right now.The results for the common tests did not matter. What was more important was the final results for the middle school exams.\u201cYou are too modest.\u201d Zhu Baoguo patted Qiao Nan on her shoulder. \u201cYour father and your mother will be thrilled to death when they know of your results.\u201dIf he could have the same results just once, his grandpa and grandma would be extremely happy.Zhu Baoguo grew frustrated at the thought of his cousins. They would always bragged about their results in front of him, teasing him for being a slacker.At first, Zhu Baoguo detested top students like Qiao Nan.But during that time, he heard that Qiao Nan\u2019s results was dropping, moreover she was his life savior, hence he agreed to having her as his tutor.If Qiao Nan had been a top student all along, Zhu Baoguo might have just thanked her for saving his life, and rejected the idea of taking tutoring lessons from her.\u201cThrilled to death?\u201d Qiao Nan was amused at this. Her father would be thrilled, as for her mother it would mean death to her. If she put the two expressions together, it would be \u201cthrilled\u201d to \u201cdeath\u201d.Zhu Baoguo had no idea what Qiao Nan was smiling about. He thought that she was just happy.That night when she reached home, Qiao Dongliang asked about her results. Ding Jiayi pricked her ears and listened carefully.When Qiao Nan told them of her results, Qiao Dongliang was thrilled, while Ding Jiayi pulled down her face and gave Qiao Nan a disdainful stare.But Ding Jiayi had been warned by Qiao Dongliang umpteen times. This time she did not bad mouth Qiao Nan. She snorted disdainfully and went to prepare dinner.Zijin would be back two weeks later. She would definitely do better than Qiao Nan.It was of no use to do well in junior high, what was important was to do well in high school.Doing well in junior high would only get you into a good high school. But doing well in high school could make sure you enter a good college. Upon entering a good college, one could be ensured of a high paying job.\u201cNan Nan, you have done well this time. How about Zhu Baoguo?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was concerned about Zhu Baoguo after he was done asking about Qiao Nan.\u201cHe is pretty smart. He gave the correct answers for all the questions that I taught him.\u201d\u201cHow much did he score?\u201d\u201cHe did not pass.\u201d\u201cThis will not do.\u201d Qiao Dongliang frowned. \u201cNan Nan, since you are tutoring Baoguo, you must make sure you do a good job and help him to improve his results. It\u2019s not good enough that you do well, you must make sure that Baoguo had good results as well. You should know Grandpa Lee took great care of me in the past. You have to repay the debts on my behalf. You have to make sure that Baoguo does well in his exams as well, do you understand?\u201dQiao Nan pursued her lips, looked at Qiao Dongliang for a while and replied coldly, \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cNan Nan, I know that you might find it difficult. But I have my own difficulties as well. You can spend the weekend tutoring Baoguo. You do not need to help out at home. During the weekdays you can make use of your time to study. You must juggle your time between both and place the same importance on these two tasks.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHer father quoted the words of the great leader just to get her to tutor Zhu Baoguo. Qiao Nan twitched her lips and forced a smile on her face. \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cGood, you must make sure to study hard. Dad will not disturb you. Leave all the chores to your Mom.\u201d Qiao Dongliang patted Qiao Nan on her shoulder happily. He then instructed Ding Jiayi not to disturb Qiao Nan when she was studying at home.Ding Jiayi was displeased at his words. \u201cI had a long day at work, I am tired to the bones. There are so many chores to do, why can\u2019t she help me out? Old Qiao, don\u2019t you think you have gone way overboard?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it. Wasn\u2019t it the same for other people?\u201d Qiao Dongliang laughed in anger. In his department there were a lot of his female colleagues who had to work and take care of their children.\u201cThey have in-laws to help them to take care of the children. I had two daughters, nobody was around to help me.\u201d Can other people be compared with her?\u201cBut you are not working at that time. You basically just stayed at home to look after the children, and I helped to bring up Nan Nan as well.\u201d Qiao Dongliang might have kept his silence, but that did not mean that he was unaware or had forgotten about it.If not for the fact that Ding Jiayi complained that milk powder was too expensive, she would not have bothered to breastfeed Qiao Nan.After feeding her for less than half a year, she complained that it was too toilsome on her and had stopped feeding her.Luckily the families nearby reared goats. The goats had just given birth and had milk for its offspring. The families felt that Qiao Nan was very pitiful, and they boiled the goats\u2019 milk and gave it to her.At times Ding Jiayi found it too troublesome, it was Qiao Dongliang who prepared the milk for Qiao Nan.Ding Jiayi did not really do her part in bringing up the child.Even if Qiao Nan had closed her door, she could still hear the quarreling sounds of her parents.Qiao Nan pursed her lips and continued to do her work.In the past she had to help out with household chores and had no time to study.Now that she had to tutor Zhu Baoguo, at the very least she had the weekdays to revise. She stood to gain from this arrangement.Ever since the rebirth, she had learned to set her thinking straight. In this lifetime, she had the chance to study. There was no need to compare herself to Qiao Zijin, she only had to make sure that she led a better life than herself in the previous life.Given that she had five days worth of study time at home and she would no longer need to do housework, as compared to the previous life, this current life was already so much better.In the previous life, she had to work during the day and help out with household chores at night. On the contrary, her mother stayed at home the whole day long. Apart from preparing meals, the rest of the housework was done by Qiao Nan. Sometimes Qiao Nan even had to wash the clothes for the whole family.In this life, besides washing her own clothes, Qiao Nan did not need to do other chores. She had more time for her studies.With that, Qiao Nan felt better.Her weakness was Chinese. Besides Chinese, she also had no confidence in Chemistry as well.But the books that she received previously basically covered almost all of the subjects and topics that Qiao Nan was not good at.Who would have such a clear understanding of her studies, to have given her the exercise books on the topics and subjects that she was weak in?In the beginning, Qiao Nan had doubts about the intended recipient of these books. But after looking at the contents, she was sure that these were for her. If not, it would not be such a coincidence.Maintain your strengths while working on your weaknesses.To get the results, every subject must be tackled.Ding Jiayi had to obey Qiao Dongliang\u2019s words. There was no way that she could make Qiao Nan share the burden of the housework.This weekend, to everyone\u2019s surprise, Qiao Zijin was home.\u201cZijin, aren\u2019t you supposed to be back next week? Why are you back this week?\u201d Ding Jiayi poured her a glass of water and asked her.\u201cOur school is having a sports meet, that\u2019s why I am back. Mom, how did Qiao Nan do in her exams this time? The results should already be out.\u201d Zijin did not forget about Qiao Nan\u2019s exams.\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. What she said that day was purely to hoodwink us. She had gotten back on track with her exams this time. She was among the top ten in the level and the top three in her class.\u201d Ding Jiayi looked defeated at the mention of this.Qiao Nan made such a tremendous improvement. Her results rose and fell just like a rocket.\u201cHow about you? Your results are out as well. How did you do this time?\u201d Ding Jiayi\u2019s eyes sparkled. She was more interested in the elder daughter\u2019s results.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Zijin, how were your mid-term exams?\u201d Qiao Dongliang who just came back overheard their conversation and asked in concern.\u201cSimilar to what I had before, not as much improvement as Qiao Nan.\u201d Qiao Zijin was not quite pleased.\u201cThat\u2019s incomparable. The students at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China are the cream of the crop, can all of the students at Qiao Nan\u2019s school enroll in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China? The ranking is incomparable.\u201d Ding Jiayi praised Qiao Zijin. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, you just have to maintain your standard.\u201dThe High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China was the key high school in Ping Cheng. A significant percentage of their students could make it into the first tier key university.If Zijin could maintain her standard and stay in the top eight places in her class, she should be able to get into the first tier university, if not, a second tier university would be just as good.As for Qiao Nan\u2019s school, one still could not say for sure how many of the students would make it to The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, not to mention getting into a first tier or second tier university.\u201cStill the eighth place in class? Well, it is more than enough.\u201d Qiao Dongliang sounded slightly disappointed. He thought that the elder daughter would improve in her ranking, he did not expect that she would still be ranked eighth in class. \u201cHow was your ranking among your level?\u201dQiao Nan told them her ranking in both the class and the level. Naturally Qiao Dongliang would like to know how Qiao Zijin did in detail as well.\u201cIn our high school, we only have the ranking within the class, we do not ranked the students according to the level. This is not the final year exams.\u201d Qiao Zijin rolled her eyes and thought of an idea.It was the truth that she ranked the eighth place in class. But she was way behind Qiao Nan in terms of her ranking in the level.Qiao Zijin had originally planned to tell her parents of her ranking in the level. But when she heard that Qiao Nan ranked in the top ten, she decided to keep silent about her ranking.If she was to tell them, her poor results would be a stark contrast to Qiao Nan\u2019s good results.Qiao Nan had just entered the house, she laughed to herself when she overheard Qiao Zijin\u2019s words.In junior high school, the students would always be ranked according to the level, so it was amusing that The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China did not rank students according to the level.But seeing that her parents had believed Qiao Zijin\u2019s words, Qiao Nan made no other comments.\u201cDad, I will bathe first.\u201d Qiao Nan put down her stuff in her room, took her clothes and went to bathe.Both Qiao Zijin and Qiao Nan had sports meets in their schools.Unlike Qiao Zijin who only cheered from the sides, Qiao Nan took part in the actual sports events.She knew that there would be questions related to sports and microcomputer experiments in the middle school exams, so her participation would be an added bonus in the exams.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Qiao Dongliang smiled widely at Qiao Nan.Qiao Zijin, who was not too pleased, pouted when she saw how Qiao Dongliang smiled affectionately at Qiao Nan.She knew that the reason behind her father\u2019s change in attitude towards Qiao Nan was that she gave Zhu Baoguo tuition and in a way, helped her father to repay the debt of gratitude towards Grandpa Lee.She could do it as well.\u201cDad, I have no more pens left, I will get one from Nan Nan\u2019s room.\u201dEver since the decrease in her monthly allowance and the money that she spent on her dance costume, Qiao Zijin was more careful in her spending, she could no longer stock up on pens or buy new stationery.If there was not a real need, she would not buy new stuff.Now that she had no more pens, she would just \u201cborrow\u201d a few pens from Qiao Nan. But there was no way that she was going to return them.Qiao Zijin opened Qiao Nan\u2019s bag and made it a point to empty the contents.Qiao Nan had a total of three pens. Their designs were shabby and they all looked the same. It was not the type of pens that she used to buy. Qiao Zijin grunted and grabbed one of the new pens.\u201cOh?\u201d Qiao Zijin chanced upon one of Qiao Nan\u2019s books. There were millions of words on it. Qiao Zijin took a closer look at one of the pages. At one glance she realized that it was an essay. Qiao Zijin had never seen or heard this essay before.Qiao Zijin might not be good at writing essays, but she could tell if it was well written or not.Qiao Zijin thought for a while and twitched her lips. She not only took one of Qiao Nan\u2019s pens, she also tore off the page with the essay.In order not to be discovered by Qiao Nan, Qiao Zijin tore off the empty page connecting to the essay page as well. She made sure to tear it off nicely so that Qiao Nan would not realize it in an instant. With that, she took the two items and left Qiao Nan\u2019s room.By the time Qiao Nan returned to her room from her bath, she saw that her bag was being opened and the contents were scattered all over the room.Qiao Zijin was the only one in the house who was capable of this.If it was her mother, she would rather throw the bag away than wasting her efforts to search through it.\u201cNan Nan, you sister came into your room just now to get a pen from you.\u201d Qiao Dongliang came at the moment to notify Qiao Nan.Qiao Dongliang could not help but frown when he saw the contents of the bag being scattered all around. \u201cYour sister is so insensible. It was just a pen, did she have to make such a mess? Nan Nan, you would have to tidy up later.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Qiao Nan could not think of anything to say.Her father knew that it was wrong of Qiao Zijin to do this, yet he could only make such a remark. What made Qiao Nan speechless was that he could say this to her, but he would not utter a word to Qiao Zijin.Qiao Nan knew that Qiao Dongliang was only paying lip service. He did not really mean it. So she gave her response absentmindedly.In the previous life, after Qiao Zijin committed adultery and left the marriage without any maintenance or marital compensation, she blamed her divorce with Chen Jun entirely on Qiao Nan. Besides her mother who pampered her, her father was also responsible for this temperament of hers.Qiao Nan could only tidy up the mess that Qiao Zijin made and put them in the study room.During dinnertime, Qiao Nan did not notice that Qiao Zijin kept stealing furtive glances at her. It was only when Qiao Zijin was sure that Qiao Nan did not think anything was amiss, that she settled down to eat.\u201cQiao Nan, Teacher Lee wanted to see you in the office.\u201d On Monday at school, Zhao Yu passed the message to Qiao Nan in disgruntlement.\u201cThank you.\u201d Even though Zhao Yu was merely relaying message for Teacher Lee, Qiao Nan was still polite to Zhao Yu. Qiao Nan did what she had to do.Zhao Yu sat down in her chair, puffing in anger. Her good friend leaned in and asked, \u201cWhy would Teacher Lee ask Qiao Nan to go to the office?\u201d Everything except to reprimand her.Even if Teacher Lee was not satisfied with Qiao Nan\u2019s results, Qiao Nan scored 92 points for her mid-term exams. Teacher Lee might be dissatisfied, but it was only because the teacher had high expectations of Qiao Nan.Not everyone would be able to score 90 points and above for Chinese in junior high school.\u201cTeacher Lee said that there is a essay competition in the province and would like Qiao Nan to participate.\u201d\u201cWhat about you, you are the representative of the Chinese subject.\u201d It made no sense that Qiao Nan could participate while Zhao Yu could not.\u201cOf course I would participate.\u201d Zhao Yu arched her eyebrows. \u201cThis is only the preliminary round, the school will hold a selection to cut down to five participants. I am one of the five participants.\u201d\u201cI thought the students can just participate in the essay competition directly?\u201d\u201cOf course not, this is the province essay competition after all.\u201d But there were five slots, her essays were pretty well written. It could not be wrong, she was definitely one of the five participants.\u201cYou must work hard, we have lost out to Qiao Nan in terms of results, we must squash her in the essay competition no matter what. Zhao Yu, you can do it!\u201d\u201cI have to, let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d Her friend was egging her on and Zhao Yu was so boastful and arrogant. Zhou Lei could not help but laugh at them.Like Zhao Yu said, Teacher Lee asked to see Qiao Nan with regards to the essay competition.Teacher Lee and all the teachers in the Chinese team knew that given Qiao Nan\u2019s standard, if she did not participate in the essay competition, there was no one else who would be qualified enough to participate.\u201cTeacher Lee, can I not participate in the competition? You should know my results, I have a lot of knowledge points to revise, it would take up too much of my time to participate in the competition.\u201dOne had to go through one round of selection in school and then proceeded to take part in the province competition, all these rounds would take up too much time.Even when she tutored Zhu Baoguo during the weekend, Qiao Nan spent most of the time doing her own revision.Qiao Nan did not want to waste more of her time.\u201cQiao Nan, I would recommend you to take part in the competition. If you manage to get a prize, it would add points to your middle school exams.\u201d Teacher Lee knew that Qiao Nan was most concerned about the exams and used that to persuade Qiao Nan.Qiao Nan was so concerned about not wasting her time so that she could revise, it was all for the sake of doing well in the middle school exams.She believed that Qiao Nan would take up the offer if she knew that it would add points to the exams.\u201cBut I would have to go through one round of selection in school.\u201d Qiao Nan frowned. \u201cAfter selecting the five students, we would still need to go for essay training?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 let\u2019s do it this way, I will try to make special arrangements for you. You do not need to sit for the preliminary rounds and you do not need to go for essay training as well. You will skip all these and just participate in the province competition. What do you think?\u201d Teacher Lee adjusted the spectacles and said in a steadfast tone.Teacher Lee was confident that these arrangements were feasible.There was no need for Qiao Nan to go for the preliminary rounds. She could just use any two essays of her recent Chinese exams to participate, she would definitely be able to secure one of the five slots.To put it bluntly, Teacher Lee knew that it had been decided that Qiao Nan would be one of the five participants.Even if she agreed to Qiao Nan\u2019s request of not participating in the competition, the other teachers in the Chinese team would not agree to it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although you don\u2019t have to participate in the training, you should also make some preparations.\u201d Teacher Lee was pleased by Qiao Nan\u2019s words.\u201cTeacher Lee, don\u2019t worry, I will definitely be well prepared.\u201dWhen Qiao Nan was back, Zhao Yu glanced at her a few times.As the Chinese Representative, Zhao Yu had seen Qiao Nan\u2019s essay more than once, so she was aware of the standard of Qiao Nan\u2019s essays.If Qiao Nan also took part in this essay competition, it would be difficult for her to win, not to mention to be one of the five participants.At the school\u2019s preliminary round of selection, Zhao Yu was relieved that she did not see Qiao Nan. It turned out that Qiao Nan had declined to participate in the essay writing competition this time. That would be great!Zhao Yu\u2019s essay writing skills were of some standard. Indeed, she managed to grab one out of the five places for the competition.During training, Zhao Yu realized that there were only four attendees although there were a total of five participants.For the sake of doing well during the essay writing competition, Zhao did not inquire further. She was motivated and focused on competing with herself, so that she could produce good essays and win a prize.\u201cIs this woman sick?\u201d Every time Zhao Yu passed by Qiao Nan, she looked like an arrogant rooster who could not wait to lift its tail to the sky. Zhu Baoguo was angered by this. \u201cWhat does she mean by this?\u201d\u201cWhat can she mean, she is happy that she can participate in the essay writing competition.\u201d Qiao Nan did not have a care, she would do whatever she needed to do.Qiao Nan had long heard the words spread by those who were on close terms with Zhao Yu.They were saying that it was useless that Qiao Nan had good grades as she could not even participate in the essay writing competition. In the critical times, the class still had to depend on Zhao Yu to do them proud for the Chinese Language.\u201cWhat about you, you\u2019re not participating?\u201d Zhu Baoguo was not pleased with Zhao Yu\u2019s attitude. It was just an essay writing competition. \u201cIf you wish to participate, I can help you think of a way. I can ensure that the five places are changed to six.\u201d\u201cNo need, I have a place. I am also participating.\u201d Qiao Nan shook her head.\u201cYou too? How come I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see you attending the training?\u201d Zhu Baoguo raised his eyebrows. His sister was so capable and did not even need his help.\u201cTeacher Lee specially granted me an exception for this, but please don\u2019t tell anyone about this.\u201d Qiao Nan also knew that this matter was confidential.Although this matter was decided by Teacher Lee and had nothing to do with her, it was not good for others to know about it.\u201cCow.\u201d Zhu Baoguo also lifted his chin, why was Zhao Yu was acting like a bird? After all, his sister took one of the five places without even the need to take the preliminary test or attend the training.\u201cYes.\u201d Qiao Nan nodded her head, she believed that Zhu Baoguo would not say this to others, there was no point in doing so.Zhu Baoguo would not say, but there were a number of classmates around them. Although the voices of the two of them were not very loud, someone vaguely heard that Qiao Nan would also be participating in this essay competition.One spread to two, two to three, before the lesson ended, Zhao Yu already knew about this matter. \u201cImpossible, Qiao Nan is lying. During the day of the preliminary round of selection, she did not even come. Moreover, she was also not qualified to attend the daily training session, how could she be one of the participants?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Qiao Nan, she dared to say this to save face.\u201d After hearing the insider information from Zhao Yu, who confirmed that Qiao Nan did not join these activities, most people held the mood of watching a show to jeer at Qiao Nan.So what if Qiao Nan\u2019s grades were good, she loved to brag and was not a model student with good moral character. There was nothing to be proud of.\u201cNo hurry, let\u2019s wait till the day to see how she falls on her own face. This lie would not continue for long, we will see how she brag. The more she brags now, the more her face would be hurt on the day of the competition.\u201d Zhao Yu was extremely happy that she could participate, while Qiao Nan weaved these nonsensical stories as she could not do so.Not long after, she would like to see how Qiao Nan would lose her face, how merciless!So, Qiao Nan was also capable of such doing such things.After the Zhao Yu knew about this matter, she became very tolerant. Contrary to usual, she stopped talking bad about Qiao Nan, and would even praise Qiao Nan occasionally in front of others.Upon Zhao Yu\u2019s publicity, besides the Class One of Secondary Three, the whole of Secondary Three knew about this matter. Many were spreading this rumor furiously.\u201cZhao Yu, Qiao Nan\u2019s rumors were so wide-spread, will Teacher help her to clarify, we won\u2019t be able to watch the fun then.\u201d Zhao Yu\u2019s classmate was a little anxious, she was watching the buzz with fun and hoping that there would be more to come.\u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry, even if Teacher Lee clarified, Qiao Nan would also lose her face. Now, the whole secondary three students already knew that Qiao Nan would participate in the essay writing competition. If Teacher Lee clarify now, won\u2019t Qiao Nan also lose her face? Anyway, this time, Qiao Nan will not get away with it. What goes around comes around.\u201d Zhou Yu was overjoyed as she said this.\u201cTrue.\u201d The classmate laughed and returned to her own seat, while waiting for Teacher Lee to expose Qiao Nan\u2019s lies.But to everyone\u2019s surprise, Teacher Lee did not say a word about this matter at all during the whole lesson.Until the bell rang, upon leaving the classroom, most were astonished. Teacher Lee was not going to take a hand in this matter?\u201cI must clarify, I did not breathe a word to anyone about that matter.\u201d Once the class was over, Zhu Baoguo was the first to clarify to Qiao Nan.He was not a busybody, it was enough that he knew about this matter, and there was no need to publicize this to the whole world. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will surely help you find out who was the one who spread the story. I will teach him a lesson!\u201d\u201cNo need, I did not suspect you.\u201d Qiao Nan said nonchalantly while she ignored the classmates who were watching the fun.\u201cYou and me are not the only ones in the class. There is a saying \u201cThe walls have ears\u201d. Let the rumors pass, there is no need to investigate.\u201d\u201cReally not investigating?\u201d Did Xiao Qiao need to be so forgiving, if it were him, he would ensure that the person who treated him this way was dead.\u201cFine, there\u2019s still one more lesson. Get ready to go home after that.\u201d Qiao Nan packed her books and put away all the books that she needed into her school bag.Half a semester passed, Qiao Nan felt more at ease as she had made a lot of progress in catching up with her knowledge.Coupled with the recent receipt of an revision book, Qiao Nan felt that her current learning journey was as smooth as a God-sent gift.Who was so brilliant to have known her situation and bought her such a good book?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qiao Nan put away her school bag. She saw that Ding Jiayi had a look of excitement on her face, both eyes were as bright as the daylight \u2013 did she pick up some money from the streets?\u201cZijin is so capable. A prominent school lives up to its name. The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China is excellent. I feel that I have made the best decision in my life by admitting her into the school.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bad. Have you gotten someone to bring the money over to Zijin?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was all smiles too, with a expression full of glory.\u201dZijin is not at home, today, you should prepare a good meal too, we can celebrate.\u201dThe elder daughter was so capable, Qiao Dongliang was really pleased.\u201cFine!\u201d Ding Jiayi agreed without any hesitation.\u201dGood food today all thanks to Zijin.\u201dWhile saying that, Ding Jiayi shifted her glance to Qiao Nan, if not for the sake of celebrating for Zijin, she also did not wish to prepare a good meal when Zijin was away and benefit the wretched girl.\u201cNan Nan is back.\u201d Qiao Dongliang, who was in a good mood, saw everything positively. \u201cNan Nan, Zijin got a place to participate in the provincial city essay writing competition. Your sister has really improved.\u201d\u201cProvincial city essay writing competition?\u201d Having heard this, Qiao Nan raised her eyebrows. Such a coincidence?But, with Qiao Zijin\u2019s essay, was she qualified to join the competition?\u201cYes, Nan Nan, when you study in the senior high school, like Zijin, you will also have the opportunity to participate in the Provincial city essay writing competition.\u201d At the thought that the younger daughter\u2019s grades were better, Qiao Dongliang believed that she would certainly have the chance to do so in future.\u201cOld Qiao, you don\u2019t need to give Qiao Nan so much pressure, can any Tom, Dick and Harry take part in the provincial city composition competition? Zijin asked someone to passed the message that the whole school only sent 10 people. One out of 10, there are so many students in the school, and all these are good students. Zijin has done us proud!\u201d Ding Jiayi became more excited as she continued. \u201cYou used to control Zijin. Zijin told me that, putting the storyline aside, the writing in the novels that she read previously is good. Reading more will help greatly in essay writing. You see, Zijin did not waste money or read the books without giving any thoughts. She had a reason for reading those books.\u201dWhile drinking her water, Qiao Nan casually asked, \u201cDad, when is Sister going to the competition?\u201d\u201cYour sister will not be back next week, she has to stay in the school for training because the essay writing competition is on the weekend of the week after next.\u201d\u201cOh, same for me too.\u201d\u201cSame?\u201d Qiao Dongliang blinked his eyes. \u201cNan Nan, you are also joining the competition?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat yes, Zijin is participating in the provincial city essay competition, how can it be the same?\u201d Ding Jiayi casted an unhappy look at Qiao Nan.\u201cI am also joining the competition, and at the same timing as Sister, that\u2019s why I said it\u2019s a coincidence.\u201dQiao Nan\u2019s words should be good news for the family, but at that moment, the smiles on the faces of Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi were frozen for a while.Qiao Dongliang was happy, but at this moment he had further thoughts.Qiao Zijin was able to participate in the competition and would not be coming home next week. She specially asked someone to sent a message to request money from the Qiao couple to buy an essay writing book to read.When the child has progressed in her learning, performed well, and wanted to buy a decent and proper essay writing book, there was no reason for the parent to reject this request.So, Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi had come up with 10 yuan and asked the messenger to pass it to Qiao Zijin.There comes the problem. Both daughters would be joining the competition. He had given the elder daughter 10 yuan to purchase learning materials, it would be unfair not to give the same to his younger daughter?Qiao Dongliang, who always like to advocate \u201cFairness, Justice, and Transparency\u201d, was hesitating as he thought about the amount of money in his pocket.There was famine in the family, and without savings, Qiao Dongliang did not feel assured and had been finding ways to save up a little here and there.The 10 yuan earlier was already an extra expense. If he had to give away another 10 yuan, that would be really hard.If he did not give, Qiao Dongliang felt bad about being biased, but if he give, that would be too much expenditure. Qiao Dongliang was feeling the pinch.Ding Jiayi quickly pulled Qiao Dongliang. Qiao Nan was not at home, and was not aware that they had given 10 yuan to Qiao Zijin. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, I am going to prepare dinner, you may return to your room quickly to read your books.\u201dFor the first time, Ding Jiayi was so willing to watch Qiao Nan go to her room without helping in any household chores and read her own books.\u201cYes.\u201d Qiao Nan replied with a word and went to her room, while carrying her schoolbag.Before the couple could breathe a sigh of relief, at the moment where Qiao Nan opened the door of her room, she turned her head and asked. \u201cSister will be joining the competition, did you all give her money to buy the learning materials?\u201dDing Jiayi\u2019s smiling face turned stiff at that instant.Qiao Dongliang was full of embarrassment. He already said, he could not let his child suffer no matter how poor he was or how hard he had to work. Qiao Dongliang bit his tongue and reached into the pocket of his trousers. \u201cYes, I just asked someone to bring 10 yuan for your sister. Qiao Nan, come, take this 10 yuan. If you need any learning materials, go and buy. It is rare to have this opportunity, we have to cherish this.\u201dDing Jiayi wanted to open her mouth to shout when she heard that they were also giving 10 yuan to Qiao Nan.Qiao Dongliang glared at Ding Jiayi. \u201cIf you are not willing to, sure, I will make a trip to Zijin\u2019s school later and retrieve that 10 yuan?\u201d\u201cIs it the same, Zijin is in senior high school and the materials are expensive. 10 yuan is fine. But she is only in junior high school, and joining different competitions, not together. Can\u2019t you just give her a few yuan?\u201d Ding Jiayi was making a lot of noise.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just give one or two cents?\u201d Qiao Dongliang rolled her eyes at Ding Jiayi. \u201cEqual treatment, if Zijin gets 10 yuan, of course Qiao Nan should also get 10 yuan. This matter is decided. Nan Nan, take the money!\u201dLooking at the 10 yuan that was forced into her hands, Qiao Nan initially felt bad but she felt more at ease now.At least her father tried his best to be fair to both Qiao Zijin and her.\u201cDad, I don\u2019t need it. Sister bought so many essay writing books. If I really need it, I will read hers. But next week when we are at the competition outside, 10 yuan is not necessary, but you still need to give me two yuan. I can\u2019t possibly let the teachers treat me to the meals.\u201d After returning Qiao Dongliang 10 yuan, Qiao Nan separately asked for the money.Qiao Nan\u2019s words made Qiao Dongliang felt quite bad. The elder daughter had so many revision materials. In his impression, the younger daughter had never bought any.Fairness, the family had never been fair.But he had no choice. Zijin would be taking in a son-in-law in future. The child of Zijin would bear the surname of Qiao. If he could treat Nan Nan better, he would try his best to do so. \u201cFine, here\u2019s three yuan. Keep it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ding Jiayi secretly breathed a sigh of relief and went to prepare the meal.Looking at Ding Jiayi, Qiao Nan tugged the corners of her mouth with sarcasm.If she had taken the 10 yuan earlier, probably the good news of Qiao Zijin\u2019s participation in the essay writing competition could not save her mother\u2019s loss of appetite.The thought that spending some money on herself would make her mother lose her appetite and suffer insomnia, she had nothing to say.In the blink of an eye, two weeks had passed.On the early morning of Saturday, Zhao Yu was prepared to go to school to wait for the teacher, when the school\u2019s rented car came, she picked a seat and sat.\u201cHey, why are there only four of us today, didn\u2019t our school select five students?\u201d Everyone was quite early, before long, Zhao Yu saw the three students who attended training with her.\u201cNot sure.\u201d The other classmate was also puzzled.\u201cZhao Yu, you\u2019re from Class One?\u201d The classmate seated behind Zhao Yu had a sneer on her face. \u201cDo you really not know or are you pretending not to know?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d She did not provoke her?\u201cQiao Nan\u2019s essay is so good, she scored nearly full marks in the two exams. Who do you think this fifth person will be? Qiao Nan\u2019s participation was already decided by the school long ago. As Qiao Nan\u2019s case was an exception, some people are not happy, but regardless, whoever that has seen Qiao Nan\u2019s essay would be convinced of her ability.\u201dShe was more sensitive than Zhao Yu. Clearly there had been five but only four came for the training. She had already asked the teacher about it.In the end, that was what the teacher told her. She was not convinced and happy initially. But after the Chinese Teacher showed her Qiao Nan\u2019s essay, she had nothing to say.Although she accepted this, she did not feel too good either.When she heard Zhao Yu saying this now, the classmate was even more unhappy.\u201cWhat, Qiao Nan\u2019s participation had long been decided by the school?\u201d Zhao Yu gave a stare. No wonder Qiao Nan was really one out of the five. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t she join the training?\u201d\u201cTeacher Lee.\u201d At this time, Qiao Nan\u2019s voice could be heard from outside the car. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not late?\u201d\u201cNo, the timing is just right, hurry and get on the bus.\u201d Teacher Lee smilingly let Qiao Nan board the bus. \u201cDo you have motion sickness, if you do, it\u2019s best to take the seat in front.\u201dThese were students who would be competing, they had to be in their best form.\u201cTeacher Lee, I do not have motion sickness, I can sit anywhere.\u201dAfter boarding the car, Qiao Nan sat down once she saw an empty seat. It did not matter where the seat was.When Zhao Yu saw Qiao Nan passing by in front of her, her face was white. What about the slapping of own face, lies and bragging? Why did Qiao Nan really come, it\u2019s so unfair!The four of them were selected from the school, and went through half a month of training. On what grounds was Qiao Nan qualified to compete when she did not even attend anything, was that fair to other students?She had these thoughts in her mind. But before the teacher, Zhao Yu ultimately did not dare to raise her doubts, she could only endure this and sit quietly in her seat.When it it was about one and a half hours into the journey, Qiao Nan already finished her nap.Amongst the five students in the car, only Qiao Nan had the mood to sleep. The rest of the four were either constantly revising their essays that had been marked and commented on by the teachers, or reading essay writing books.During the period of training, the teacher gave them many model essay questions to work on. First, it\u2019s a practice. Second, they were in luck if they guessed the question.The four students held the hope that the teacher had guessed correctly, and were doing their utmost to memorize their own essays.However, when they turned and saw Qiao Nan sleeping soundly, with her head wobbling from side to side, they gritted their teeth. This Qiao Nan was really too much!\u201cAll of you should relax too, don\u2019t be too nervous.\u201d When the teachers saw the situation, they all laughed. Qiao Nan was clearly a young lady but was so relaxed, she could still sleep so soundly at this time.But those who sat on a moving car before knew that it was boring to be in the car. It was not conducive to read something and sleeping was the best way to pass time.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cOkay, Teacher Lee,\u201d The four students replied weakly. Who could relax at such a time? If they could attain a good score for this essay writing competition, they would be given merit points for the middle school examinations.\u201d\u201cQiao Nan, wake up. We have arrived.\u201dUpon reaching the location of the competition, it was Teacher Lee who woke Qiao Nan up.\u201cWe have arrived?\u201d Qiao Nan rubbed her eyes. She had put on a little weight recently. She looked so pretty, her tiny face was as rosy as an apple.\u201cYes, we are here.\u201d Teacher Lee\u2019s eyes were gentle, as if she were looking at her own child. \u201cDrink some water and sober up, don\u2019t be sleepy and muddle-headed during the competition.\u201d\u201cOkay, I will wash my face when I go to the restroom later.\u201d Qiao Nan nodded her head and left the car, but she left behind her school bag.After Qiao Nan finished washing up, the teacher was already leading the students to the exam hall.\u201cTeacher Lee, I need to go back to the car, I left my school bag there and the pens are inside the bag.\u201d Qiao Nan told Teacher Lee and hurriedly took her school bag from the car.Zhao Yu, who was standing behind Teacher Lee, saw this and she smiled slyly.\u201cFine, quickly enter the exam hall.\u201d The teachers swiftly settled the students in their respective seats. When the competition starts, the bell rang and all the competing students began to lower their heads and review the question.When she saw the question, Qiao Nan had a little surprise. She had previously written an essay that was appropriate for the subject. This time, she could slack a little.She had only written that essay once, and it still needed a little touch up. This was her second time writing it, with some touching up, there should not be any major issue.After thinking through, Qiao Nan took out her pen and prepared to write. She finished her first word but she could only see the strokes of her writing, without any ink.Qiao Nan blinked her eyes. This was a new pen, how could it be?Qiao Nan, who refused to believe in fate, tried to rub the tip of the pen with paper, just in case the tip was covered with wax. But after a long time, she still could not write a single word.Qiao Nan shook the pen vigorously but to no avail.Qiao Nan quickly took another pen. She brought a total of three pens, but strangely, all three pens that used to be easy to write with could not produce a single word now!Zhao Yu, who was seated behind Qiao Nan, was secretly watching Qiao Nan. When she saw Qiao Nan spent a long time messing with the pen and did not manage to write anything, her smile broadened.This time, she wanted to see how Qiao Nan could compete with her!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can I borrow a pen?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 \u201csaid the teacher awkwardly. \u201cI only have a red pen. Does anyone have a spare pen to lend?\u201dFaced with the invigilator\u2019s question, the exam hall was silent, you could hear a pin drop. Everyone was busy writing their essay and nobody answered. Some students even secretly hid their spare pens in case the invigilator asked.Seated in the same exam hall but only a few would be winners, everybody was a competitor, who would lend their spare pen?At least in this exam hall, nobody was willing to.\u201cWell\u2026 \u201d said the invigilator, faced with this situation, the invigilator was at a loss of what to do. He had to invigilate and could not leave, if the other students were not willing to lend, he could not force them to lend either.Qiao Nan took a deep breath, pursed her lips and said, \u201cTeacher, if there is no other way, could you lend me your red pen?\u201d\u201cThat will not do, this essay\u2019s rules state clearly that it must be written in blue or black ink, red ink will not do,\u201d replied the teacher sympathetically. The teacher pitied Qiao Nan for being so unlucky, she could not participate in the competition she did not have a pen.Qiao Nan\u2019s eyes started to well up. She had not thought of participating earlier but now that she was here at the competition, she was faced the possibility of giving up because she did not have a usable pen. Qiao Nan was very unhappy and unwilling.Most importantly, she had prepared three pens, there was a new one and the rest were her usual pens.The pens were clearly still working last night yet it was broken today. If somebody had told her it was a coincidence, she would never believe it. Somebody must have plotted against her!\u201cTeacher Zhou, what is the matter?\u201d A voice came from the few people standing outside the classroom.\u201cPrincipal.\u201d Teacher Zhou spotted an old man and hurriedly walked over. Teacher Zhou explained, \u201cThat student\u2019s pens are all broken and other students do not have spare pens to lend. At this rate, she will not be able to participate.\u201dThe old principal paused before continuing, \u201cOh my, the children these days. Whilst academic results are important, moral education should also not be neglected.\u201d\u201cUse mine.\u201d Zhai Sheng said rather nonchalantly before taking out a pen. Zhai Sheng had his eyes fixed on Qiao Nan and he noticed her sweating profusely due to the anxiety.Today, Zhai Sheng had come to the school on behalf of his father and unexpectedly met Qiao Nan.Even more surprisingly to Zhai Sheng, Qiao Nan seemed to be very unlucky. In the few times that he has met Qiao Nan, Qiao Nan was always in trouble.However, Zhai Sheng looked at the students in the exam hall and his eyes were filled with disapproval.\u201cI thank you on behalf of that student.\u201d The Invigilator replied with a relief. He had really felt pity for Qiao Nan.Looking at the attention given to Qiao Nan by other teachers earlier, the invigilator deduced that she must be a good student and her essay writing skills should be up to par too.\u201cDo not mention it.\u201d\u201cHere is the pen you wanted, use it quickly without further delay.\u201d The invigilator handed Zhai Sheng\u2019s pen over to Qiao Nan. The invigilator gently reminded Qiao Nan, \u201cThis is a fountain pen, pay extra care when you write. Wait for the ink to dry or else it will smudge when you put your hand over it.\u201d\u201cThank you Teacher!\u201d Qiao Nan\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. The pen was loaned to you from him. When you finished, remember to return it to him.\u201d The invigilator pointed to Zhai Sheng. This pen was quite heavy and had a good feel, it must be pretty expensive.\u201cZhai Sheng?\u201d Qiao Nan had spotted Zhai Sheng. \u201cOkay, teacher, noted.\u201d\u201cAlright, make full use of your time, the other students have already written a lot.\u201d said the invigilator.\u201cOkay,\u201d replied Qiao Nan. She was already late by more than 10 minutes.Fortunately, she had a draft in her mind, otherwise given the situation, she would not be able to continue writing.Qiao Nan actually preferred writing with a fountain pen and coupled with the fact that Zhai Sheng\u2019s pen was of a high quality, it allowed Qiao Nan to write swiftly in tandem with the ink flowing smoothly out from the nib of the pen. It was even faster than if Qiao Nan had used a ballpoint pen.In no time at all, Qiao Nan had caught up with the progress of the other students.Due to the pen incident, the invigilator paid extra attention to Qiao Nan and stood by Qiao Nan for a moment.The invigilator saw that Qiao Nan had written so much in such a short period of time, his eyes lit up as he was taken aback. When he further read the contents, coupled with the elegant writing of the fountain pen, he was genuinely surprised.Before the bell rang, Qiao Nan had already finished with her essay.When it was time to exit the exam hall, some of the students had not finished and were making a scene.Qiao Nan walked out relaxedly and wanted to find Zhai Sheng to return the pen.Qiao Nan had only taken a few steps when Teacher Lee came up and asked, \u201cQiao Nan, how do you think you fared in the competition?\u201dQiao Nan replied, \u201cSimilar to the usual.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Teacher Lee said with a sigh of relief. If Qiao Nan was able to perform normally, she should at least be able to receive a third prize minimally.\u201cQiao Nan, what are you doing here?\u201d A voice rang out from behind Qiao Nan.\u201cI came to participate in the provincial composition competition.\u201d Qiao Nan turned around to face Qiao Zijin.\u201cYou, you also came to participate?\u201d Qiao Zijin stammered, somewhat shocked. She had never heard that Qiao Nan was participating.\u201cHi Zijin, it\u2019s you. You also came here to participate?\u201d Teacher Lee asked. Teacher Lee was somewhat shocked, Teacher Lee knew the standard of Qiao Zijin\u2019s essay. How was Qiao Zijin able to participate? Wasn\u2019t the school afraid of wasting a nomination slot?There were merit points for winning a junior high school essay competition, and of course the same for a high school competition.As such, the high school competition\u2019s nomination slots would be more keenly contested.Qiao Zijin\u2019s words had coincided with Teacher Lee\u2019s. Qiao Nan smiled and replied, \u201cI had heard from Father and Mother that you were participating but I did not expect us to be in the same school participating.\u201dQiao Zijin forced out a smile and said, \u201cSuch is fate. Nan Nan, how did you fare?\u201d\u201cNot too bad,\u201d said Qiao Nan, who raised her eyebrows whilst noticing Qiao Zijin\u2019s increasing discomfort. She deduced in her mind that Qiao Zijin had not performed well in the competition, otherwise why was her face so pale?\u201cAlright, it is getting late, we should get going.\u201d Teacher Lee said whilst patting Qiao Nan\u2019s shoulder. Teacher Lee did not speak much to Qiao Zijin.Qiao Nan followed Teacher Lee, nodded to Qiao Zijin and then simply left.Once Qiao Nan had left, Qiao Zijin\u2019s face turned downcast and quickly went to find her classmates. Qiao Zijin asked, \u201cI heard that for this competition, junior school students are also here, do you know what their essay question was?\u201d\u201cI think it was the same as ours.\u201d The classmate replied before adding, \u201cThe teachers are too lazy, setting the same question for junior school and high school. They did not even make the effort to think up another question.\u201d\u201cQiao Zijin, did you manage to finish your essay?\u201d Qiao Zijin\u2019s Chinese teacher walked happily towards Qiao Zijin. The teacher added, \u201cI read your previous essay, that would have been suitable and you need not think up a new essay. Did you use that essay for submission?\u201dEven the Chinese teacher was surprised by Qiao Zijin.Qiao Zijin\u2019s normal performance was average but she did demonstrate a flair for writing when it came to essays.Otherwise, how would Qiao Zijin be able to participate based on her academic results?\u201cIt was submitted,\u201d Qiao Zijin replied dryly without a hint of happiness.Only heaven knows that when Qiao Zijin saw the essay question, she was so happy that she wanted to let out a scream. The heavens were on her side!She had not expected her luck to be so good. She had used Qiao Nan\u2019s essay for submission earlier and won the nomination slot for the competition. Even more unexpectedly, Qiao Nan\u2019s essay was also suitable for the exam question.She could fully make use of one essay from Qiao Nan!However, once Qiao Zijin saw Qiao Nan, the good mood dissipated.Qiao Nan must be here to participate in the essay competition. Both junior school and high school questions were the same, surely Qiao Nan did not write the same essay?Impossible, she should not have.Qiao Nan had written this casually, surely she would not be able to regurgitate and she would write a new piece?The more Qiao Zijin thought about it, the more guilty she felt. Her mind was hurting from all the thinking. She prayed silently that her essay and Qiao Nan\u2019s essay did not coincide.Qiao Nan was very good at essay writing, she could easily write a new piece. Surely, she would not be so lazy to regurgitate an old piece?After the competition, Qiao Zijin could finally go home. However, on the way home, Qiao Zijin\u2019s mind kept going through the various scenarios, it was very torturous.\u201cZijin, you are back. How was the competition? Are you confident?\u201d Ding Jiayi asked excitedly, warmly welcoming Qiao Zijin home.\u201cMom, where is Nan Nan?\u201d asked Qiao Zijin.\u201cShe is reading in her room,\u201d replied Ding Jiayi.\u201cMom, I have to find Nan Nan first. Talk to you later,\u201d Qiao Zijin replied. Once Qiao Zijin heard that Qiao Nan was back, she threw her schoolbag to Ding Jiayi and went to Qiao Nan\u2019s room. Qiao Zijin said, \u201cNan Nan, I have something to talk to you about.\u201d\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Qiao Nan said. She threw away the three broken pens into the dustbin.When Qiao Nan came back and inspected the pens, she found that the pens had signs of being thrown which led to them being broken.Anyone who uses ballpoint pens knows that once you smash the pens onto the floor, the pens will be broken easily and you cannot write with them anymore. The pens were obviously smashed onto the floor by somebody.Qiao Nan\u2019s schoolbag was on the school bus all this while, the person who did it was surely not from another school and the teacher would not do it either. Could it have been one of the other four people who joined her in the competition today?Such bad behavior at such a young age.\u201cNan Nan, what was your essay question today?\u201d Qiao Zijin asked. If the question was different, then there was nothing for her to worry about.\u201cTeacher Lee told me that the question for junior school and high school is the same\u201d Qiao Nan replied pointedly.It was really the same\u2026Qiao Zijin\u2019s face froze. \u201cNan Nan, what did you write for the competition then?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you really care about me, I can tell you. I feel that I did quite well, you don\u2019t need to worry about me. Sister, you need to work hard too.\u201d Qiao Nan smiled. The more Qiao Zijin asked, the more Qiao Nan refused to answer.\u201cI don\u2019t need you to worry about it.\u201d Qiao Zijin said unappreciatively. \u201cI just wanted to know what you wrote. You can just tell me directly. Won\u2019t that do?\u201d\u201cThen, Sister, why don\u2019t you tell me what you wrote today? We were given the same question. Shall we discuss?\u201dQiao Zijin said a sentence, and Qiao Nan said another. After haggling for a long time, Qiao Zijin did not gather anything useful. Instead, she nearly let the cat out of the bag.Qiao Zijin did not know what to say. \u201cYou are really too much. Just be straight to the point and answer me. Why are you talking crap?\u201d\u201cWhen I asked you, you didn\u2019t reply either.\u201d\u201cQiao Nan, did you do this on purpose?\u201d Qiao Zijin\u2019s heart was in a flurry.\u201cDo what on purpose?\u201d Qiao Nan raised her eyebrows and asked Qiao Zijin to make herself clear.\u201cNo, nothing. Forget it if you don\u2019t want to say.\u201d Qiao Zijin could not continue with the conversation any longer. She could not possibly tell Qiao Nan that she had stolen one of her essays and plagiarized it for today\u2019s competition, then asked Qiao Nan if she had written something else or regurgitated that old piece of work.With nothing in return after trying for a long time, Qiao Zijin was burning with anger inside, yet she could not vent it at Qiao Nan. She could only stamp her feet and left with a pale face.Qiao Zijin had just left Qiao Nan\u2019s bedroom when Ding Jiayi came looking for Qiao Nan in a fearsome manner. \u201cDid you bully your sister just now?\u201d\u201cHow could I bully Sister? During today\u2019s essay competition, I bumped into her. Coincidentally, we were at the same place. Furthermore, the test question for both junior and senior high school were the same, so Sister came and asked me how I fared. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d Qiao Nan was happy. She bullied Qiao Zijin?She would be lucky if Qiao Zijin bullied her less.\u201cIt\u2019s really so simple?\u201d She clearly saw Qiao Zijin looking unhappy when she came out of Qiao Nan\u2019s room.\u201cYes, it\u2019s that simple. Mom, you can ask Sister if you do not believe what I said. You will surely believe whatever Sister said? If I bullied her, would she not let you know?\u201d It would not be Qiao Zijin if she did not complain.\u201cThat better be. If not, I\u2019ll not let you off.\u201d Ding Jiayi was so protective of Qiao Zijin, like a cow shielding her calf, she scolded Qiao Nan even before anything happened.Although Ding Jiayi got a reply from Qiao Nan, she still felt uncomfortable. As such, she specially looked for Qiao Zijin to find out more.Qiao Zijin did not look good when she glanced at Ding Jiayi. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is, Mom. I just finished the competition and feel really tired, I would like to take a break.\u201d\u201cSure, Mom will not disturb you. Rest well. I\u2019ll call you after preparing the meal.\u201d Seeing that the elder daughter seemed troubled, Ding Jiayi dared not disturb, so she quietly left Qiao Zijin\u2019s room, closing the bedroom door along the way.Alone in the room, Qiao Nan took out her essay book and opened it.Qiao Nan touched the page that was missing, her eyes revealing that she was deep in thought.Yesterday, she suddenly found that she was missing a page in this essay book, as if the page had been torn off.To prevent from being discovered, the person had torn away the other side of that page as well.Qiao Nan was not sure who had torn the page. Until today, all her pens were broken, Qiao Nan could not help suspecting that this was the doing of one of her classmates.After all, during the times when she was in school, her schoolbag was not by her side at all times. There would be opportunity for someone to tear the book.However, a while ago, Qiao Nan had finally confirmed the person who tore the page of her essay book.It was not someone else, it was Qiao Zijin.During today\u2019s competition, Qiao Nan had a great shock when she saw the question. For a while, she hesitated and wondered if the person who tore her book would simply copy her work.This idea flashed briefly in Qiao Nan\u2019s head, but she decided to use it eventually as she did not see any reason not to, and it was her own essay.As for the person who would copy her essay, she was too daring!After putting the essay book away, Qiao Nan sneered. Qiao Zijin always thought that she could continue to bully Qiao Nan. Now, starting from this essay book, Qiao Nan would show Qiao Zijin that this was not so.During mealtime, Ding Jiayi dared not ask a word. On the contrary, Qiao Dongliang asked his two daughters how they fared in today\u2019s essay writing.Qiao Nan laughed nonchalantly, \u201cAs usual.\u201d\u201cHow about Zijin?\u201d\u201cNot, not sure.\u201d Qiao Zijin nearly choked on her rice.Initially, in such a situation, Qiao Zijin wanted to proudly proclaim that she had done very well. However, Qiao Zijin was no longer in the mood now. \u201cNot very sure, it will depend on the Teacher\u2019s views.\u201d\u201cNo anxiety, it is extremely good that you can join the competition this time. It will be great if you receive a prize. If you did not, take it as a learning experience.\u201d Qiao Zijin did not sound confident. Hence, Qiao Dongliang dared not harbor high hopes.In comparison to the past where the elder daughter did not have any involvement with such activities, he had obviously seen significant improvements.\u201cBoth of you have worked hard, eat more.\u201d Qiao Dongliang lovingly filled the two daughters\u2019 bowls with lots of protein dishes.Ding Jiayi opened her mouth but did not say a word. She then quickly filled Zijin\u2019s bowls with a few more servings of vegetables with her chopsticks.While Qiao Zijin felt extremely uneasy, the teacher reading the test essays was in a good mood. The teacher of the high school\u2019s language team held an essay in his hand: \u201cThis essay is really good, you all have a look too.\u201d\u201cOh, let me take a look. Yes, it\u2019s really quite good.\u201d\u201cSo good?\u201d After reading it once, all the teachers in the Chinese Language team gave a score to the essay based on their criteria. As expected, the final score was good.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do this?\u201d Set one for the first place, two for the second place, and three for the third place. After picking out six essays, the teacher submitted the list of winners and the respective essays.After the high school department had finalized this, the junior high school team had almost done so too.During the last review, something was wrong.\u201cWhy, you see, this essay is for the first place in junior high school, and this is for the second place in senior high school. The similarity of the two is more than 90 percent, but\u2026\u201d When the two essays were placed together to compare, someone immediately saw the problem.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

True enough, the contents of the two were indeed almost exactly the same, with only some differences in some of the rhetorical writing.As for what the other teacher was referring to when he said \u201cBut\u2026 \u201c, the leader also noticed.The second place essay for the senior high school was not as good as that of the first place of the junior high school. The essay for the junior high school displayed a better style in writing, and succinct phrasing of words.The two essays were identical. There must be a problem here.However, the essay from the senior high school was not better than that from the junior high school, why was this the case?Perhaps the two students did not write these essays, and instead plagiarized them from someone. The difference was that the quality of the essay of the junior high school student was better.The leader removed his spectacles. \u201cFind out immediately the identity of the students who wrote these two essays, and the schools that they are from, then ask their teachers to come. This type of matter has to be dealt with, we must clarify this!\u201dTeacher Lee, who was resting at home during the weekend, received a call from the school\u2019s management asking her to go to the provincial city.\u201cVice Principal, what is happening?\u201d After Teacher Lee prepared the items that were requested by the Vice Principal, when she rushed to the provincial city, she discovered that the Vice Principal had also come.\u201cI heard from the management that Qiao Nan\u2019s essay had a clash of \u201cgarments\u201d with someone else\u2019s essay. The high school had another essay that is almost identical. The similarity is as high as ninety percent. What do you think is the issue?\u201d The Vice Principal was anxious and sweating profusely. If Qiao Nan had copied the work of others, the school\u2019s reputation would be adversely affected. \u201cHow is Qiao Nan as a student? Is there a problem with her essay?\u201dThe Vice Principal knew that one of the five students who participated in the competition was jointly decided by the school\u2019s language team. And this student belonged to Teacher Lee\u2019s class.Thus, the Vice Principal had every reason to suspect that Qiao Nan was that student.Teacher Lee and Vice Principal arrived. The subject teacher and the leader of Qiao Zijin\u2019s school had also arrived.Both parties knew the situation but as education professionals, they were civilized people \u2013 they greeted one another reluctantly before entering the office.\u201cBoth sides\u2019 teachers are here. Take a look at these.\u201d The two essays were placed side by side on the table. Teacher Lee and Qiao Zijin\u2019s language teacher bowed their heads and reviewed them.Upon the sight of the familiar essay, Qiao Zijin\u2019s language teacher said immediately, \u201cLeader, this essay was indeed written by my student \u2013 Qiao Zijin.\u201d\u201cWhat, this essay belonged to Qiao Zijin?\u201d Teacher Lee was surprised.\u201cWhy, this teacher knows both the students?\u201d The leader looked at Teacher Lee. \u201cOh yes, it seems that the two students who wrote the essays bear the same surname \u2013 Qiao?\u201d\u201cIn response to the leader\u2019s question, Qiao Zijin was also from my school. She is the biological sister of my student, Qiao Nan. Both are born from the same parents.\u201d\u201cBiological sisters?\u201d The leader was stunned. \u201cThen did the younger sister copied her elder sister?\u201dHowever, the younger sister\u2019s essay was obviously better than that of the elder sister.The leader read in detail, that younger sister\u2019s essay could also clinch the top place in the senior high school category.It was placed second now because the elder sister\u2019s essay was not as good.\u201cImpossible,\u201d Teacher Lee said with certainty. \u201cQiao Nan would never copy Zijin\u2019s essay.\u201dQiao Zijin\u2019s teacher\u2019s expression changed. If the younger sister did not copy, then it meant that her student had copied her younger sister?\u201cLeader, I have proof that this essay is undoubtedly written by my student Qiao Zijin.\u201d As she said that, Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher took out an essay book. \u201cLeader, see, this was written by Qiao Zijin in the school half a month ago. At that time, I was impressed by the essay and recommended her to join the competition. Coincidentally, this essay was appropriate for the subject of the essay for this competition.\u201dQiao Zijin wrote this half a month ago, the school had the records.\u201cThen, this teacher, what do you have to say?\u201d He saw that Qiao Zijin\u2019s essay, that was written half a month ago, was indeed identical to that essay, just short of a few words and adjectives.\u201cLeader, to tell you the truth, I have not seen this essay from Qiao Nan before.\u201dHearing Teacher Lee\u2019s remark, Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher smiled complacently.Seeing the expression of the teacher, Teacher Lee smiled. \u201cHowever, I still believe in my student. \u201cLeader, I have proof too. My proof are two test papers, one is our first semester\u2019s model exam paper, and the other is the mid-term exam paper administered half a month ago. Leader, you may take a look at the essays written by Qiao Nan before.\u201dShe dared to say that if these two essays were taken to participate in the competition, and were appropriate for the question, they would definitely also be winning essays.The leader took a look at the two test papers. First, the words written on the paper were neat and tidy, and pleasing to the eyes. He also acknowledged the scores given to the essays, but when he read the contents, his eyes lit up. \u201cThis essay, it is well written.\u201dAfter reading one essay, the Leader picked up and read the second one. \u201cThis one is also very good. Both essays\u2019 standards are not bad and similar to the one who clinched the prizes. All the three essays are rather good. Have you thought of submitting the drafts for this student?\u201d\u201cAlso, how old is this student?\u201d It was not easy for a junior high school student to compose an essay of such a high standard. The student is a literacy talent.\u201cIn response to your question, Leader, Qiao Nan is 15 years old. She is younger than her sister by two years, but studied early for a year.\u201d Teacher Lee introduced proudly.\u201cI see.\u201d The leader was again surprised regarding Qiao Nan\u2019s writing and also her young age. \u201cDid you bring the essays written by Qiao Zijin in usual days?\u201dAfter reading Qiao Nan\u2019s essays, the leader did not conclude immediately.\u201cYes, I did\u2026 \u201d Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher\u2019s expression turned awkward. An essay that could gain the liking of the leader was definitely not bad.On the contrary, Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher knew, although Qiao Zijin did not write many essays, the only piece that was brilliant would be the piece that was used to participate in this competition.Initially, she thought Qiao Zijin was suddenly enlightened, and her words flowed smoothly with her feelings, to create this wonderful masterpiece.However, at this juncture, Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher was in doubt.\u201cLet me take a look.\u201dQiao Zijin\u2019s teacher reluctantly passed to the Leader the two other essays written by Qiao Zijin.The leader only glanced at it a couple of times before he passed Qiao Nan\u2019s two essays to Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher. \u201cYou can take a look at these two pieces.\u201dA student\u2019s essay, she might have improved or even progressed rapidly. However, it was impossible for certain situations to occur.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the student had made some progress, the essays that she write would typically stay at a certain standard.The three essays written by Qiao Nan had proved this point.On the contrary, the standard of the essays written by Qiao Zijin\u2019s during the monthly and mid-term exams, especially the latter which was written recently, was too different from the winning essay. They were not that bad, but definitely not comparable.Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher quietly finished reading the two language papers of Qiao Nan, then she turned pale.Both are Chinese teachers. After seeing Qiao Nan\u2019s essays, Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher understood everything.The standard of Qiao Nan\u2019s essays were consistent.Having seen the two essays by Qiao Zijin, it was without a doubt that Qiao Nan was the one who wrote the winning piece.People would believe that Qiao Nan wrote the essay, whereas for Qiao Zijin, logically, no one would believe that Qiao Nan copied the work of Qiao Zijin.Furthermore, both were biological sisters who lived under the same roof.As long as Qiao Zijin had the intention, it would be easy for her to obtain the essay that was written by her sister. There was definitely this possibility.After comparing, it was obvious who was the copycat.\u201cDo you have anything else to say?\u201d Seeing the attitude of Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher, the leader need not say more.\u201cNo, it\u2019s our fault for selecting such a student. Leader, our sincere apologies.\u201d The teacher from The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China quickly apologized to the Leader, Teacher Lee and the rest. After all, the student in the wrong came from the school.Fortunately, Qiao Nan was outstanding. Otherwise, she could be easily disadvantaged in such situations, where others would misunderstood her as the copycat instead of Qiao Zijin.After all, who would believe that the senior high school\u2019s elder sister would copy the essay of her junior high school\u2019s younger sister?Had it not been that the combined competition of the junior and senior high school on this occasion, Qiao Zijin would have received the award even if she had copied Qiao Nan\u2019s essay.\u201cSince the misunderstanding has been clarified, the matter has been decided. Teachers from The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, do you have any other views?\u201d Now that the matter was clear, Qiao Nan would continue to clinch first place, but Qiao Zijin\u2019s second place was gone.Clearly Qiao Zijin had copied her sister. It would not be fair to other students if she won a prize.\u201cNo comments.\u201d Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher\u2019s face was red with embarrassment. She wished that she could dig a hole and bury herself in it.In addition to copying the work of others, her student even had a clash of \u201cgarments\u201d during a competition, and was caught red-handed. This time, the face of the school was entirely lost.At this juncture, Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher was particularly disgusted with her.If not for Qiao Zijin, today\u2019s matter would not have happened.The school\u2019s reputation had always been very good. If the Principal knew about this, she would definitely be criticized and she could forget about receiving her year-end bonus. The reputation of the school and her future had been destroyed by the hands of this one student \u2013 Qiao Zijin!Teacher Lee smiled gently. What could the teachers from the other school say, they were not stupid.What was so great about The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China? Their students were of such inferior standard \u2013 the high school student had to copy the works of the student from their junior high school.As a teacher in the junior high school, would Teacher Lee not know about Qiao Zijin\u2019s academic performance?To say that Qiao Nan would copy Qiao Zijin\u2019s work would be really out of this world. It would be a joke if Qiao Nan, who was a top student, needed to copy Qiao Zijin\u2019s essay. Who did not know that Qiao Zijin entered the school because of money, it was a myth that all the students in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China were outstanding.At the thought of Qiao Zijin losing the prize and Qiao Nan clinching the top place, Teacher Lee\u2019s face was full of pride and glory.The year end bonus of Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher was in tatters, but that of Teacher Lee would probably be better than before.Looking at Teacher Lee who was happy and proud, unlike the miserly state that she was in, Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher was so furious that she wanted to vomit blood.Most of the students in her class joined the school with the help of money, but she did not expect Qiao Zijin would be so unreliable!Regarding this matter, Qiao Nan had no knowledge. On Sunday morning, Qiao Nan took some time to make a trip to the Zhai family, then she went to the Lee family to give tuition to Zhu Baoguo.As usual, when Qiao Nan entered the quiet place of the Zhai family, she felt a little down.After the competition, she did not manage to find Brother Zhai. Thereafter, she was led away by Teacher Lee, when she wanted to return to the quad so that she could return the pen to Brother Zhai, he had already returned to Pingcheng instead of the Zhai family residence.Just when Qiao Nan was hesitating on whether to simply leave the fountain pen in the storeroom, she saw a few new books on the table.Qiao Nan went over to take a look and discovered that the books were similar to to those that she received at the delivery room.Qiao Nan opened the books and they looked extremely new. Most likely, they had just been bought.Did the Zhai family have any children that were studying in high school now? Did Brother Zhai specially buy these for her, so the books that she received previously at the delivery room were indeed from Brother Zhai?In the face of the revision books with neither name nor note, Qiao Nan was in much hesitation.These books would be of great help to her, but Brother Zhai did not leave any notes. If he really wanted to give them to her, should she accept them?Or, similar to the previous books, she would carry them with her but would not write anything in it. If it was a misunderstanding, she could take it that she borrowed from Brother Zhai.\u201cOh, there\u2019s new books again. Say, who was the one who gave them to you?\u201d When he saw Qiao Nan carrying the new books to the Lee family, Zhu Baoguo ran to Qiao Nan\u2019s side to see, as if he was a monkey.Qiao Nan was never stingy with Zhu Baoguo. As long as Zhu Baoguo did not write or draw on the books, she had never decline to lend any of them to him. It was the same this time.\u201cDon\u2019t be such a busybody, I can lend them to you if you wish to read them. Don\u2019t forget the old rules.\u201d Sitting down, Qiao Nan was focused as she opened her school bag to proceed with the revision plan today.Zhu Baoguo mouth twisted; in his entire life, he had not treated the books with such an attitude before. The books in his hands were not books, they were clearly akin to the ancestors that he prayed to three times a day.Although he had these thoughts, Zhu Baoguo dared not provoke Qiao Nan, so he abided by Qiao Nan\u2019s rules when reading.Zhu Baoguo was better at Science than Humanities and Arts subjects. Since both the Zhu family and Lee family had laid down the conditions, Qiao Nan might as well focus on revising the Science knowledge for Zhu Baoguo, and strive to improve his grades in this area.\u201cThese are the test questions that I drafted for you yesterday. Complete these two papers.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDuring almost every weekend, Qiao Nan would come up with a Science test paper that was catered to Zhu Baoguo.\u201cOh.\u201d Already used to the revision method of Qiao Nan, Zhu Baoguo consciously took out his pen and started to work on the questions. Elder Lee, who came downstairs with the excuse of getting some water to drink, saw this and felt very comforted and relieved.After the mid-term exam, when he saw the few test papers that Zhu Baoguo had failed, one could imagined Elder Lee\u2019s huge disappointment.Clearly he had known that his grandson had never learned well. He also told himself more than once that, by letting his grandson learn from Qiao Nan, he just wanted to tame his temper and prevent him from getting into trouble.However, at this juncture, Elder Lee was inevitably hopeful.But dreams are often beautiful and reality cruel. The grandson\u2019s flunking of the tests was undoubtedly a slap in the faces of both the Zhu and the Lee family.For this reason, Elder Lee picked a time to speak to Qiao Nan. \u201cNan Nan, what do you think of Baoguo\u2019s progress, can he catch up?\u201d\u201cElder Lee, Zhu Baoguo is actually quite intelligent. It is not difficult for him to catch up. Judging that at the beginning of next year, most of his results will be improved.\u201d Qiao Nan replied with certainty.Elder Lee smiled bitterly. \u201cNan Nan, you\u2019re still a child. Don\u2019t talk to me so diplomatically like an adult. You also don\u2019t need to comfort me. Tell me the truth. I have heard about Baoguo\u2019s mid-term exam results, he did not pass any subjects.\u201d\u201cElder Lee, I am not comforting you. You don\u2019t know Zhu Baoguo\u2019s situation. That\u2019s why you only looked at his marks. Zhu Baoguo\u2019s mid-term exam grades may be a failure in your eyes but they are no different from scoring full marks in my opinion.\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cZhu Baoguo did not go to school in junior high school. As primary school is not difficult, Zhu Baoguo picked them up very quickly. But picking up the knowledge of junior high school is certainly not as easy. That test paper of Zhu Baoguo, he got every question that I had taught before correct. For those that have not been taught, it is not realistic to expect him to answer them correctly or score well in the test.\u201d Qiao Nan felt that she was in a difficult position. \u201cGrandpa Lee, you may not quite understand, putting aside junior high school, even in primary school, the loss of any knowledge will result in difficulty in catching up, these students are easily given up by teachers. Zhu Baoguo is learning very swiftly now, his IQ is certainly not low.\u201d\u201cGrandpa Lee, did you criticize Zhu Baoguo because of the mid-term exam? If so, then you have wronged Zhu Baoguo.\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Elder Lee was stunned as he listened. He did not expect that a failed test paper could give so much insight.That means that although his grandson failed the exams, he had not done badly; in fact, he had done well. \u201cNan Nan, is what you are saying true, Baoguo is really so smart that you would give him full marks for these few tests?\u201dElder Lee was someone open-minded. He initially did not understand, but after listening to Qiao Nan, he understood.\u201cA full 100 marks. If Zhu Baoguo continued to study seriously from the beginning, his grades will not be bad, and he will be well-liked by the teachers as he could grasp concepts at his fingertips. You know my situation, Grandpa Lee, but I never had the feeling that Zhu Baoguo was wasting my time, Zhu Baoguo can learn things without much effort. Basically, he understood whatever I have taught him just once, and answered the questions correctly.\u201dAnyway, she had never been a teacher, but after teaching Zhu Baoguo, she had never been in a bad mood.Which teacher would not like a student that understood at the first attempt?Elder Lee, who just picked up the responsibility of a grandfather, was grinning from ear to ear, when he heard Qiao Nan\u2019s praise on Zhu Baoguo. \u201cIs Baoguo really so good?\u201dTo put it bluntly, it was the Zhu family who did not know how to bring up the kids. See how good Baoguo is now after being taken in hand by the Lee family.\u201cGood.\u201d Qiao Nan nodded. \u201cActually Zhu Baoguo\u2019s temper is a bit stubborn and he is very sensitive. Grandpa Lee should understand the reason more than me. People like Zhu Bao, you have to use the soft approach and coax him, don\u2019t always question, criticize or look at him with disappointment. This is not fair and will make let Zhu Baoguo feel rebellious. Grandpa Lee, if you have the time, go and buy some books on Teen psychology. I think it hasn\u2019t been easy for Zhu Baoguo.\u201dElder Lee smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re a mature little one, you talk with with logic as though you know more than me. What book? Teen psychology, fine, next time I\u2019ll send someone to buy some for me to read. Baoguo did not have it easy, but you have a more difficult life than Baoguo.\u201dThrough his grandson, Elder Lee already knew that the rescue of his grandson had caused so much trouble for Qiao Nan.Fortunately, the teachers trusted Qiao Nan. Otherwise, Qiao Nan would be criticized instead of commended that day in the school.\u201cNo, I feel that I am living quite well now. My Dad recently\u2026 Grandpa Lee, thank you.\u201d Qiao Nan could feel that his father had been tightening his reign over her mother. Her mother no longer assigned household chores to her to cause her to have less time to study. Most importantly, she also stopped addressing her as the wretched girl, at least before her.In this world, her father was the only person that could suppress her mother, and Elder Lee was the one who made her father realize it.\u201cNan Nan, probably the best thing that I have done for Baoguo, is to have found him a little teacher like you. If you encounter any difficulties in the future, don\u2019t hesitate to come to Grandpa, understand?\u201d Elder Lee, who knew that Ding Jiayi had the notion of wanting Qiao Nan to quit school and work, was afraid that the saga had not ended.\u201cThank you Grandpa Lee. But for the sake of Zhu Baoguo, the things that we talked about today, Grandpa Lee can also let the Zhu family know. You must not only dote on him, but also assure him.\u201d Their conversation ended with this advice of Qiao Nan.Elder Lee went back and thought carefully about Qiao Nan\u2019s words. .The more he thought about it, the more he felt that there was a point.Everyone goes through the stage of being young and foolish, Elder Lee thought how he felt at the time when he was still young, and he really understood the meaning of Qiao Nan\u2019s words.True enough, the Zhu and Lee family co-operated with one another. Even if they were unable to change their attitude towards Zhu Baoguo, they could not deny that under this atmosphere, Zhu Baoguo\u2019s temper had toned down. Unlike the past, he would no longer jump and get angry at the slightest issue.Elder Lee drank his freshly brewed tea and went upstairs at a leisurely pace, avoiding creating any disturbance for the two that were learning.When Qiao Nan finished her tuition with Zhu Baoguo and went home, she did not see Qiao Zijin. Qiao Nan was not surprised. However, even Ding Jiayi was not home. \u201cDad, did Mom send Sister to school?\u201d\u201cNo, the school rang and asked your Mom to make a trip to the school.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What is the matter, is there a Parent-Teacher Conference?\u201d It was strange to hold a Parent-Teacher Conference at this time of the year. She thought that it would be usually be held after the mid-term examination.\u201cNot sure, there\u2019s probably some matter.\u201d When he said this, Qiao Dongliang looked happy.Qiao Nan raised her eyebrows; given the expression of her father, perhaps Qiao Zijin had done a good thing.\u201cThey say it\u2019s regarding Zijin\u2019s participation in the essay competition. It\u2019s probably a good matter.\u201d Qiao Dongliang\u2019s smile deepened. \u201cQiao Nan, your sister has made great improvements recently. If possible, Dad will definitely try to get you into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China as well. Thereafter, Dad will wait for the day when both of you become successful.\u201dSo what if he did not have a son, the daughters he raised were more successful than the sons of others. That was better than anything else.\u201cEssay competition?\u201d Hearing these two words, Qiao Nan smiled with deep thoughts.If the school invited the parent because Qiao Zijin scored well in the mid-term exam, then undoubtedly, she would be praised during the meeting.However, if it was pertaining to the essay competition, unless she guessed it wrong, it was definitely not a good thing that her mother had been invited to the school.Qiao Zijin\u2019s good performance worked like a miracle pill for her mother \u2013 it was more nutritious than the supplement that her mother took.Her mother must have fought for the right to make the trip to the school without her father. \u201cDid Mom say she will go by herself? Dad, you\u2019re not going?\u201d If her father was going, it would be interesting.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, there will be other opportunities in future.\u201d Qiao Dongliang shook his head as if he could not help it but his mood was not sour.When the school called and requested Qiao Zijin\u2019s parents to make the trip, Qiao Dongliang initially wanted to send Qiao Zijin to the school and also to find out why they made the request.But Ding Jiayi said it first, she chided Qiao Dongliang straight, \u201cOld Qiao, we agreed before that I will solely take care of Zijin\u2019s matters, and you will handle Qiao Nan\u2019s matters. Zijin performed well, I will be the one making this trip. If you want to go, wait for Qiao Nan\u2019s turn.\u201dSince Ding Jiayi already said so, Qiao Dongliang had nothing else to say.The elder daughter had done well and this was the first trip to the school to receive some commendation. He regretted that he was unable to be there.Fortunately, the younger daughter\u2019s performance had always been good. The chances of the younger daughter being praised would be higher than that that of the elder daughter. With this thought, Qiao Dongliang did not feel so bad anymore. \u201cIs there a Parent-Teacher Conference for your school?\u201d\u201cTeacher Chen said that there would be one after the final term exams.\u201d\u201cGood, I will attend your Parent-Teacher Conference.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Qiao Nan was laughing secretly. She already knew that it was her mother who grabbed the chance to make the trip to Qiao Zijin\u2019s school. She hoped that her mother could still smile when she was on the way back.Ding Jiayi sent Qiao Zijin to the school early, so it was not particularly late when she came home. However, when she was back, her face was all black. \u201cQiao Nan, tell me, why are you so lazy?\u201d\u201cWho did you say is lazy?\u201d Qiao Dongliang\u2019s face turned black. \u201cDid you forget what I told you!\u201d Without a reason, why was Nan Nan being scolded again?\u201cAfter the trip to the school, why are you furious, what did the teacher tell you?\u201d Logically, Old DIng should be happy if the elder daughter had been commended. But the attitude as as if she had consumed a ton of gunpowder outside and was waiting to explode at home.\u201cWhat did the teacher say?\u201d Ding Jiayi laughed in a strange and sinister manner, she then reached out her hands and tried to pinch Qiao Nan\u2019s arms.Seeing the situation, Qiao Dongliang pulled Qiao Nan behind him without saying a word. \u201cTell me what you have to say, what exactly did the the teacher tell you, did Zijin make a mistake?\u201dIf the purpose of the trip today was to commend Zijin, Old Ding would not have this attitude.\u201cMade a mistake? Zijin is so obedient, how could she make mistakes. She is the one who harmed Zijin.\u201d Ding Jiayi became spiteful when she did not manage to hit Qiao Nan. \u201cYou\u2019re still defending her, you don\u2019t know that she caused harm to Zijin! She caused Zijin to receive a warning in school. Zijin lost all of her face. Qiao Nan, Qiao Nan, tell me why you are so cruel and malicious to hurt your sister this way. You, you, you are really driving me to my grave! Old Qiao, you still want to defend this heartless thing!\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense.\u201d Qiao Dongliang\u2019s face turned black. He was confused by Ding Jiayi\u2019s words. \u201cWhen you stepped into the house, you said Nan Nan was lazy. And now, you said she harmed Zijin. What has Nan Nan\u2019s laziness got to do with harming Zijin? You also scolded Nan Nan for being heartless, how are all these related!\u201d\u201cNan Nan, do you know what is going on?\u201d His wife was not talking sense, Qiao Dongliang could only ask Qiao Nan.Qiao Nan knew what was happening but she could not breathe a word. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cThen tell me, tell me properly, what exactly happened? Didn\u2019t you say that Zijin was doing well in the school recently and was ranked eighth in her studies in class. She even participated in the essay writing competition. Why was she issued with a warning? This, will this affect Zijin\u2019s future?\u201d Qiao Dongliang could not help feeling nervous. Being given a warning was not a small matter.\u201cAsk her!\u201d Ding Jiayi pointed at Qiao Nan\u2019s nose while glaring at her.\u201cMom, what did I do?\u201d\u201cYes, what did Nan Nan do? If you tell me Nan Nan would harm Zijin, I won\u2019t believe it.\u201d Moreover, even if Nan Nan would really cause harm to Zijin, one was in junior high and the other in senior high. It was impossible for Nan Nan to cause harm to Zijin. This was utter nonsense.\u201cDuring the competition, she wrote a piece of essay that was exactly the same as that of Zijin!\u201d\u201cExactly the same?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was stunned. \u201cNan Nan, did you copy your sister?\u201dTwo identical essays appeared in the competition. Qiao Dongliang understood the outcome immediately.If Nan Nan had copied Zijin, then Nan Nan should be the one being warned and not Zijin. Zijin was warned, hence, she was the one who made the mistake and that was the reason for the Parent-Teacher Conference. It meant that Zijin copied Nan Nan!Having understood this, Qiao Dongliang\u2019s face was really black. \u201cZijin copied Nan Nan\u2019s essay and you are scolding Nan Nan?\u201d Coming to the end of the conversation, Qiao Dongliang felt ridiculous.\u201cIf she\u2019s not lazy who is? It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t know how to write. If she had written a new piece during the competition, then there would not be any issue. I heard that Zijin\u2019s essay nearly clinched the second place!\u201d Second place, such an excellent ranking. If Zijin clinched it, she would also receive merit points for the middle school examination!\u201cDon\u2019t you think your words are too ridiculous?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was furious and stunned by the shameless words of Ding Jiayi. Were Old Ding\u2019s words acceptable?If these words got out, they would be a laughing stock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If Zijin is capable, why didn\u2019t she write it herself, why does she have to copy? Nan Nan was being labeled as lazy for using her own essay, what about Zijin who copied Nan Nan\u2019s essay?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was confused, he couldn\u2019t think.The elder daughter copied the younger daughter\u2019s essay and almost copied her way to a prize.When he heard that, Qiao Dongliang had no idea if he should be glad or angry.He was happy that the younger daughter\u2019s essay was good enough to get a prize in high school. There was no way that the same essay would not get a prize in the junior high school competition.But he was furious as the elder daughter used such underhanded methods to copy the younger daughter\u2019s essay and was issued a warning for it.As a sister, she resorted to copying from her younger sister. If he was not trying to keep his temper in check, he wanted to ask the elder daughter, why would she be so shameless?But his wife gave the younger daughter a lecture as soon as she reached home. Qiao Dongliang felt so outraged for the younger daughter.The elder daughter was caught copying from the younger daughter, but the younger daughter was being blamed instead, what right does the elder daughter have to copy from her sister?\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Zijin bought a stack of essay books so as to \u2018learn\u2019, what do we mean by learn, isn\u2019t it similar to copying? Besides, this is our essay, if not for Qiao Nan, nobody would know that it wasn\u2019t Zijin\u2019s idea. She has to be blamed for it.\u201dDing Jiayi was totally brainwashed by Qiao Zijin who bawled her eyes out at school just now. She believed that \u201cAll articles were created by copying\u201d.Besides, there were no outsider involved, how could it be considered copying? Zijin merely borrowed it.If Qiao Nan did not write this essay but wrote another essay, everything would be alright.\u201cWho told you all this? You are so downright shameless. Old Ding, are you really this shameless?\u201d Qiao Dongliang lashed out at her, \u201cThis is not our property, this is Nan Nan\u2019s essay, her own essay! Can Zijin take and use Nan Nan\u2019s property as and when she wish? Who said this?! Nan Nan\u2019s works belonged to her alone, you can\u2019t say that it belonged to the family.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t Zijin her biological sister? Zijin treated her so well, shouldn\u2019t she help her as well?\u201d Ding Jiayi refused to back down, \u201cWe are one family, why do we have to be so calculative? Ha!\u201d\u201cAlright, if that\u2019s the case, does it mean that Nan Nan can use Zijin\u2019s things and has it all for herself?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was boiling with anger at Ding Jiayi\u2019s arrogant and unreasonable behavior. He almost felt like giving a slap to her face.\u201cZijin took credit for Nan Nan\u2019s essay. No matter how we look at it, it\u2019s Zijin\u2019s fault. How can you say that Zijin is being good to Nan Nan? That\u2019s just crap!\u201dQiao Dongliang stretched out his hands to pull at Ding Jiayi. \u201cSince you insist that Nan Nan is at fault, that she shouldn\u2019t be lazy and she should write another essay, go outside with me now. I dare you to repeat what you said to me and Nan Nan just now to the people at the quad. If you dare to do that, Nan Nan and I will admit that it\u2019s our fault. What do you think?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ding Jiayi paled in fright, she slapped at Qiao Dongliang\u2019s hands, refusing to step out of the house.Ding Jiayi felt that it was alright of her to make unreasonable requests to Qiao Nan, and that Qiao Nan was obligated to do according to her wishes.But she felt ashamed to repeat what she said to others.Ding Jiayi dared not tell the others that instead of the person who wrote the essay, the one who copied the essay had the right to use the essay. She dared not tell them such shameless things.\u201cSo you also realized that what you said just now was shameless and you dared not let others know. But why would you treat Nan Nan in this way? You only dare to take it out on the family and to bully Nan Nan? How unlucky Nan Nan must be to have a Mom like you? Do you know that what you said just now will affect the relationship of the two sisters? If they fall out with each other and turn their back against each other, you will have to bear the full responsibility! As you said, Zijin is Nan Nan\u2019s biological sister, if she runs into any troubles in the future, she has no one to seek help except Nan Nan. Yet you want to create troubles!\u201dQiao Dongliang\u2019s words was to serve as a reminder to Ding Jiayi and Qiao Nan.Ding Jiayi did not get it, but Qiao Nan understood.Qiao Dongliang had two meanings to his words.First, Ding Jiayi\u2019s ramblings was all her own doings, it had nothing to do with Qiao Zijin. He wanted Qiao Nan not to have any misunderstandings and not to affect the relationship between the sisters.Secondly, Qiao Dongliang understood that even if the elder daughter has been making improvements, her results was still far behind the younger daughter\u2019s results.In the society now, those who could study would have a brighter future.The younger daughter might have better future prospects as compared to the elder daughter.If the elder daughter ran into any troubles, she could only seek help from the younger daughter.If Ding Jiayi continued with her ways to spoil their relationship, the younger daughter might not be willing to help the elder daughter when she was in trouble?His wife would only hinder the elder daughter.Qiao Nan\u2019s lips dropped, she could no longer feel the surge of warmth when Qiao Dongliang jumped in to defend her just now.That surge of warmth was not enough for her to feel comforted and warm, instead his words were just like pouring a bucket of cold water over her.Her mother wanted her to be the source of income for Qiao Zijin. She would do anything that was beneficial for Qiao Zijin, even if it meant taking everything away from Qiao Nan.As for her father, he wanted Qiao Nan to be Qiao Zijin\u2019s nanny, to take care of her no matter what.\u201cHow am I creating trouble?\u201d Ding Jiayi refused to admit. \u201cZijin was the victim here, you decide what to do!\u201dOld Qiao wanted to take in a son-in-law for Zijin. She did not believe that he would not be anxious that she was being issued a warning.If not for the fact that Qiao Zijin\u2019s teacher had told Ding Jiayi outright that it was only possible that Qiao Zijin copied the essay from Qiao Nan, Ding Jiayi might have dragged Qiao Nan to The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, and forced her to admit in front of the teacher that she had copied from Qiao Zijin.Not only did Ding Jiayi refused to admit her mistake, she acted justified and confident. Qiao Dongliang had a splitting headache, Old Ding was so muddleheaded. \u201cNan Nan\u2026\u201dHe could only work on the younger daughter since his wife refused to listen to reasons.The squeaky wheel gets the grease, Qiao Nan had always been obedient and sensible. Hence Qiao Dongliang was used to the fact that she should give in and suffer in silence, and try to be more understanding towards Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin. \u201cYour Mom has a bad temper, she was muddleheaded to have said those words. Do not take it to heart. She is a good person, it\u2019s just that she cared too much for your sister.\u201d\u201cDad, did you also think that I should let sister copy my essay?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was not as muddleheaded as Old Ding. \u201cBut Nan Nan, you must understand, if there\u2019s peace at home everything will prosper! You should know your Mom\u2019s temper, you can\u2019t possibly ask her to apologize to you?\u201dThey were one family, they could not possibly stay at loggerheads with each other forever?\u201cEven if Mom is wrong, I would still need to obey, listen to her and please her?\u201d Her father did not seem happy when she did that in her previous life.\u201cI am not asking you to obey your Mom\u2026 \u201d Qiao Dongliang had a terrible headache. If Nan Nan was to obey Old Ding in whatever she asked, the house might be even more chaotic.\u201cWhat does Dad want me to do? When Mom reprimanded me for being lazy and that I should have let sister copy my essay, I did not even say a word. Dad, am I not submissive enough? Which areas should I improve on? You can tell me and I will change.\u201d Qiao Nan spoke in an exceptionally calm voice, in a composed manner that was beyond people her age.The more Qiao Nan appeared to be calm and composed, the more Qiao Dongliang felt guilty.Qiao Dongliang used to think that as children, they were obligated to obey their parents. Since Old Ding was muddleheaded, Qiao Nan would just have to suffer in silence.It might sound irresponsible, but it was Nan Nan\u2019s fault to have such a mother.But when he looked into Qiao Nan\u2019s dark eyes, her calm and still expression halted him in his tracks. It was as if his mouth had been glued. No words came out of his mouth.If Qiao Nan threw tantrums and cried in anguish, Qiao Dongliang could chide her for being disobedient and insensible. But Qiao Nan stayed silent all the while, Qiao Dongliang didn\u2019t know what to say.He tried multiple times to persuade Qiao Nan, but he could not make any sound.Given Ding Jiayi\u2019s personality, there was no way that Qiao Dongliang could persuade Qiao Nan. He had reached a dead end.If Qiao Nan was to give in to Ding Jiayi, there would not be any chance that she could continue with her studies. She would be responsible for writing essays for Qiao Zijin to copy.But this was against Qiao Dongliang\u2019s world views. In that case, how could he tell his daughter to obey his wife? And what exactly should she do to obey her?Qiao Dongliang had no answers to his own questions, he was lost in thoughts.After a while, an upset Qiao Dongliang said in disgruntlement, \u201cAll of you have such a bad temper.\u201dWith that he returned to his room.His wife would not listen to him, and his daughter had her own views, she would no longer listen to her parents.He could no longer take his wife and daughter in hand.Qiao Nan could hear the censure from Qiao Dongliang\u2019s words, she twitched her lips in self mockery. No matter what, she would no longer give in to her mother and Qiao Zijin. That was impossible!If her parents knew that she had done the essay incident on purpose, she wondered how her parents would react.But Qiao Nan was not foolish. She would not admit it out of her own accord and invite trouble for herself.She returned to her room right after Qiao Dongliang left.But in a while Ding Jiayi came storming in.Without a word, Ding Jiayi searched through Qiao Nan\u2019s schoolbag, throwing all the contents onto the bed, searching through them book by book.\u201cMom, what are you doing?\u201d Was her mother so furious about Qiao Zijin\u2019s incident that she wanted to tear up her textbooks.\u201cDad!\u201d Qiao Nan knew that there was no way that she could stop her Mom, she could only shout for his help.But Qiao Dongliang was still angry over the incident just now. Upon hearing Qiao Nan\u2019s call for him, he stayed in his room and did not utter a word.\u201cLet me ask you, where\u2019s your essay book?\u201d After searching through all the books, Ding Jiayi could not find the essay book that Qiao Zijin mentioned. She demanded it from Qiao Nan, \u201cGive your essay book to me. From now on, you are not allowed to use any of the essays in your essay book, do you understand? If there\u2019s a next time, I will not let you off. Hurry up, hand me your essay book!\u201dQiao Nan smirked at Ding Jiayi. \u201cI don\u2019t have it!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t have it? I don\u2019t believe you. Give it to me now. If not don\u2019t blame me for being unruly!\u201d\u201cEven so I do not have it with me!\u201d Qiao Nan ran out of the room. \u201cDad, Mom wanted to tear up my books!\u201d\u201cYou wretched girl\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat, Old Ding!!!\u201d Qiao Dongliang bellowed and rushed out. \u201cOld Ding, I didn\u2019t flare up recently but that doesn\u2019t mean that I am good tempered!\u201d\u201cWhen did I say that I want to tear up her books? I merely wanted her to give me her essay book and not to use them in future.\u201d Ding Jiayi glared at Qiao Nan furiously. This wretched girl lied to frame her.\u201cDad, do you think I should hand them over?\u201d Qiao Nan was not afraid of Ding Jiayi, she turned and asked Qiao Dongliang.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to give, don\u2019t give them to her. There are other components besides essays in the college entrance exams. Even if Qiao Zijin could copy Qiao Nan\u2019s essay, there is no way that Qiao Nan could sit for the other exams on her behalf? You are so foolish.\u201d Qiao Dongliang chided Ding Jiayi.\u201cI don\u2019t care. It would be good if Zijin can do better for her essay. When you are in high school, every mark matters. I will do whatever I can to help Zijin. Besides it would not kill her to help her biological sister. Why is she so stingy? That\u2019s the only way that she can be of use at home.\u201d Ding Jiayi refused to listen to reason.\u201cCome out with me.\u201d Since Qiao Dongliang could not talk reason into Ding Jiayi, he could not be bothered to talk sense into her anymore. He stepped into Qiao Nan\u2019s room and dragged Ding Jiayi out with him. \u201cNan Nan, keep an eye on your books in the future, if the worst comes to worst, don\u2019t bring them home.\u201dQiao Dongliang had no other choice. There was no way that his wife would change her ways until she had gotten what she wanted.Qiao Dongliang had a sudden thought, it might be a good idea for Qiao Nan to put all her books elsewhere.Nan Nan could no longer take things lightly. His wife was beyond reasons, she would go ahead to take Nan Nan\u2019s stuff without any reasons.Before this Qiao Dongliang was still angry at Qiao Nan. But after looking at Ding Jiayi\u2019s unruly behavior just now, all his anger had dissipated.Nan Nan was plain unlucky to have such a mother like Old Ding.\u201cOh, I understand.\u201d Qiao Nan was relieved that Qiao Dongliang seemed to have cooled down.Even though her father might be fickle minded at times, but Qiao Nan knew that he was the only one in the family who would defend her. If she enraged and offended him, Qiao Nan would have an even more difficult time at home.Qiao Dongliang dragged Ding Jiayi away after Qiao Nan\u2019s affirmative answer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qiao Nan had no idea why he would want the essay book, but she did not bother to find out.No matter what, Elder Lee was not like her mother, who would give her essay to someone else to copy and forbid the original writer from using it.Her mother was getting way out of hand. No wonder when she was knocked down by the car in her previous life, her mother was happy enough to cry, saying that Qiao Zijin finally had the money and the kidney to cure her illness.After being dragged to her room by Qiao Dongliang, Ding Jiayi ranted at him. \u201cOld Qiao, are you foolish? Instead of giving money to Zijin to buy essay books, we should just let her look at Qiao Nan\u2019s essay.\u201d\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t do. Those were Nan Nan\u2019s essays. They belonged to her. Zijin cannot use them. If others find out about this, Zijin may find it a disgrace. You must consider Zijin\u2019s future. Is she still going in to take in a husband?\u201d Qiao Dongliang said in exasperation.\u201cWe can keep it to ourselves.\u201d\u201cOh, so you do realize that what you are doing is wrong and you do not want others to know about it?\u201d Qiao Dongliang mocked her. \u201cDo you think that we can keep such things under wraps? We have to count our blessings that things didn\u2019t blow up.\u201dZijin had already been issued a warning in school. Of the students in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, at least everyone at her class would have known about it.Qiao Dongliang\u2019s head hurt at the thought of that. \u201cLook at what happened. Now that Qiao Zijin has been issued a warning, do you think she wanted to stay in that class? Will she be looked down upon by others?\u201dIt was so disgraceful to cheat with one\u2019s own sister\u2019s essay. Qiao Dongliang blushed in embarrassment at the thought of that.\u201cNo, they won\u2019t.\u201d Ding Jiayi was lost for words. She stuttered, \u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s only\u2026 besides, the essay is Qiao Nan\u2019s, it\u2019s our family affair, what has it got to do with outsiders? They have no right to look down on Zijin.\u201d\u201cKeep your words to yourself. You should know that Zijin only had a chance to enter the competition because of Nan Nan\u2019s essay. If Zijin did not participate, another student would have the chance to take part. Apart from the other students, how do you think Zijin\u2019s teacher will view her after this incident? Will the teacher be displeased with her? Zijin has been issued with a warning. Her teacher might have been been disciplined for this as well.\u201d\u201cDo you mean that Zijin could have offended her teacher because of this incident? It, it cannot be so serious, right?\u201d Ding Jiayi was shocked. She did not really care about the reactions of other students, instead she was worried that Zijin\u2019s teacher might be displeased with her.\u201cDon\u2019t you know what kind of school The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China is? Even if you kept saying that it\u2019s okay, but that fact that Zijin cheated in the competitions would remain a record in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. Not to mention the teachers, what do you think the principal will think?\u201d\u201cWhat, what should we do?\u201d At home, Ding Jiayi might have insisted that it was normal to copy from one\u2019s sister. But it was a different matter outside.\u201cI have no idea. This is a complicated matter. Why would Zijin be so foolish. As for you, did you even use your brains to think? To think that you wanted to snatch Nan Nan\u2019s essay books. Do you think that Zijin\u2019s reputation in not in tatters yet? Do you want her teachers to dislike her further? Now her teachers are well aware of her standard, if she used Nan Nan\u2019s essay again, do you think they would not find out?\u201dQiao Dongliang had given up on making Ding Jiayi understand that what she did would affect the sisters\u2019 relationship. Instead he tried to make her see the impact of the incident on Zijin. It was only in this way that she would take in his words.\u201cIt, it would turn out this way?\u201d As expected, when Qiao Dongliang pointed out the ramifications of this incident and how it might affect Qiao Zijin, Ding Jiayi was willing to listen to every single word that he said. \u201cThen, then what should we do? I thought it would be useful to Zijin if I gave her Qiao Nan\u2019s essay book.\u201dThat wretched girl, as expected, she was of no use to Zijin at all, not even her essay book could help her.\u201cYou do not need to meddle in this matter. I am not trying to help Nan Nan. Instead what you should worry about is whether what you do would be doing harm to Zijin.\u201d\u201cYou yourself know if you are doing this for Zijin or for Qiao Nan. But as for Zijin, I would have to think about it, if her teacher is displeased with her, what should we do about it?\u201d Ding Jiayi knew that what she could do next was to help Zijin make up for her mistake.An absurd weekend passed by for the Qiao family. On the next Monday at school, Zhao Yu had just sat down when the other classmates crowded around her and said, \u201cRegarding the competition last weekend, do you know what happened to Qiao Nan?\u201dZhao Yu pulled her face. They were obviously rubbing someone\u2019s nose in it.She was boiling with anger when she was reminded of how she passed all the rounds, went for half a month of training, and yet it has been decided that Qiao Nan would be one of the participants. \u201cAlright, stop probing. Qiao Nan was one of the five participants who took part in the essay competition.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d All the students who were hoping to see some fun were dejected.\u201cStop talking about this. I am so frustrated. I am going to read my books.\u201d Zhao Yu placed her books vertically in front of her and buried her face in them.She had thought that since she had broken Qiao Nan\u2019s pens, she had no pens to write her essay and she would have to give up on the competition.Who would have known that some busybody would lend her a pen. Hopefully she did not do well in her essay this time.At the thought of this, Zhao Yu shot Qiao Nan a guilty look. All her pens were broken, would she be suspicious?But nobody was there when she broke her pens. Even if Qiao Nan suspected her, she could do nothing about it.\u201cHere\u2019s your essay book, take it back.\u201d Zhu Baoguo gave Qiao Nan the essay book that she left with Elder Lee.\u201cThank you.\u201d Qiao Nan was relieved when she finally had her essay book back.Luckily she did not bring her essay book home, if not with her mother\u2019s temper, she would have given it to Qiao Zijin.In this life, the money that she earned belonged to her, and it was the same for the essay that she wrote as well. She would never let Qiao Zijin copy another word from her!Because of this, Qiao Nan\u2019s words of gratitude sounded even more sincere and agitated than before.\u201cAre you running a fever?\u201d Zhu Baoguo who was used to her cold attitude was shaken up by the tone in her voice. \u201cHave you taken the wrong medicine?\u201d\u201cGo away.\u201d Qiao Nan shot a disdainful look at Zhu Baoguo. He laughed at her instead, \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201dQiao Nan twinged the corners of her mouth. She did not know that Zhu Baoguo was like that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I am very proud to announce that among the five of them, two of the students were awarded prizes. One of them came in the third place while the other student came in the first place. The student who came in third is from another class. But the student who came in first place is in our class!\u201dTeacher Chen and Teacher Lee were exhilarated. They were very proud to have their student to come in first in the essay competition.Of course, if it was a Mathematics competition, Teacher Chen would be even happier.\u201cThe first place?! Who is it?\u201d\u201cZhao Yu is the only one from our class that participated in the essay competition. It must be her.\u201d\u201cCrap, Zhao Yu is so brilliant. Being awarded the first place in the essay competition, this is much more difficult than coming in the first place in Chinese in school. One really can\u2019t tell that she is so intelligent.\u201dThe students were full of murmuring. Most of them guessed that it must have been Zhao Yu, while Zhu Baoguo lifted his chin and kept his silence as if he knew something.\u201cThe student who came in the first place in the essay competition is Qiao Nan!\u201d Teacher Chen announced in excitement. \u201cQiao Nan did very well for her essays, why didn\u2019t anyone guess that it was her?\u201dThe classroom was in total silence at Teacher Chen\u2019s words. Most of them were in shock.Although there were many rumors that Qiao Nan participated in the essay competition, she did not take part in the preliminary rounds organized by the school nor did she go for the essay training session that was specially organized for this competition. Hence even if there were rumors that Qiao Nan was among the five students who participated, everyone treated it as a joke and wanted to see how Qiao Nan would make a fool of herself.But now the only person to come in first place was Qiao Nan?\u201cThat\u2019s right, Qiao Nan did very well in the two Chinese exams this semester. Teacher Lee even pasted them on the blackboard. I have taken a look. They were really well written, even better than the essay books that I bought.\u201d\u201cYes, Qiao Nan deserved the first place. Zhao Yu was not good enough.\u201dAfter hearing Teacher Chen\u2019s announcement, a lot of the students corrected themselves. Previously they looked at Zhao Yu enviously, but now they only had contempt for her.Zhao Yu paled and bit her lip. She hung her head and sniffed.\u201cEveryone, let\u2019s give a round of applause for Qiao Nan. She has made us all proud this time.\u201d Teacher Chen started to clap, and the students followed thereafter.\u201cQiao Nan, you have to get ready to receive the prize from the principal after the morning exercise.\u201d\u201cTeacher Chen, I understand.\u201dAfter Teacher Chen has left, Zhao Yu glared at Qiao Nan with bloodshot eyes, \u201cQiao Nan, don\u2019t be too smug.\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Zhu Baoguo pulled at his sleeves and gave Zhao Yu a fierce stare.\u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry?\u201d Qiao Nan stopped Zhu Baoguo. \u201cDon\u2019t be too smug? I am going to laugh smugly, I am going to laugh smugly!\u201dWhen she was participating in the essay competition, someone must have broken her pens on purpose. She did not want to pinpoint Zhao Yu, but she was being too obvious.Zhao Yu had told Qiao Nan not to be too smug, yet Qiao Nan sang \u201claugh smugly\u201d at her. Zhao Yu longed to throw her books at Qiao Nan and to scratch at her face. She wanted to see if Qiao Nan would still be able to laugh smugly after that.But before Zhao Yu could do anything, Zhu Baoguo had already pulled Qiao Nan aside. He lifted his chin and looked askance at Zhao Yu. Zhao Yu gritted her teeth and lowered her hand.\u201cZhao Yu, I brought three pens to the essay competition, but they were all broken and could not be used. Do you know who did that?\u201d Qiao Nan arched her eyebrows and looked at Zhao Yu.Eyes flickering around, Zhao Yu could not hide her emotions. She dared not look at Qiao Nan in the eyes. \u201cYour, your pens were broken, it\u2019s none of my business. What do you mean by do I know who did it. Your pens were broken. There\u2019s no one to blame.\u201d\u201cHow could three pens be broken in one go?\u201d Qiao Nan smirked. \u201cCould all the pens have ganged up together?\u201d\u201cThis, this is a coincidence. Why would you ask me, I have no idea at all. You, you are really getting on my nerves. I am done talking to you!\u201d Zhao Yu could feel her heart thumping, she was stuttering and her face was flushed red.At this time the school bell rang. It was time for morning exercise.While the class monitor lined up the students, Qiao Nan stared coldly at Zhao Yu.If Zhao Yu really broke her pens, this was no longer a simple matter of throwing tantrums or playing pranks on other students.If Zhao Yu a junior high school student could come up with the plan of breaking her pens to prevent her from writing her essay, nobody would know if she would do more terrible things next time.\u201cYou just wait and see!\u201d Qiao Nan had gone to line up, but Zhu Baoguo who purposely trailed behind said in a vicious tone when he passed by Zhao Yu. \u201cQiao Nan may not take it to heart, but that doesn\u2019t mean I will let this matter rest. Did you break Qiao Nan\u2019s pens?\u201d\u201cNo, no, I am innocent. Qiao Nan framed me!\u201d Zhao Yu might not be scared of Qiao Nan, but she feared Zhu Baoguo. She was scared of his family status and his gangster attitude.At his command, not to mention outside the school, a lot of the students in the school would be willing to be his hatchet men.By that time Zhu Baoguo would escape unscathed while she was being bullied.\u201cWould I believe you?\u201d Zhu Baoguo smiled coldly and walked off to line up.Zhao Yu was angered and scared at the same time by Zhu Baoguo\u2019s attitude. She stomped her feet in frustration.What should she do now? She thought that no-one would know about the pens and Qiao Nan would suffer in silence.After all, no-one could tell for sure how the pens were broken. She had no idea that Qiao Nan would have guessed that the pens have been broken.So what if the pens were broken, Qiao Nan still managed to borrow a pen and came in first place in the essay competition. What more did she want!During morning exercise, Zhao Yu looked on in anger and frustration when Qiao Nan was called up to the stage by the principal. She received the certificate and prize from the principal and was the center of attention of the whole school.The thunderous sounds of applause was painful to Zhao Yu\u2019s ears. It hurt even more inside her heart.\u201cWhere\u2019s Qiao Nan?\u201d After morning exercise Zhao Yu was anxious when she didn\u2019t see Qiao Nan.\u201cShe seems to have gone to look for Teacher Chen. Zhao Yu, Qiao Nan was in the limelight today. She came in first. I wonder how many marks would be added on to her middle school exams.\u201d The students remarked bitterly.\u201cWhat, she went to look for Teacher Chen? Qiao Nan has gone way overboard!\u201d How could Qiao Nan tell the teacher, it was just pure speculation on her part!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

True enough, Qiao Nan was also there. Zhao Yu\u2019s eyes welled up instantly in front of Teacher Chen.\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d Teacher Chen was shocked that she was crying without an apparent reason. \u201cWhat is wrong, come in\u201d\u201cTeacher Chen, Qiao Nan is maligning me.\u201d Zhao Yu wiped away her tears as she sobbed quietly, looking so pitiful.Qiao Nan shot a glance at Zhao Yu coldly, without saying a word.Obviously, youngsters do have the tendency to lose their cool.\u201cQiao Nan maligned you?\u201d Teacher Chen looked at Zhao Yu strangely. \u201cHow did Qiao Nan malign you, and about what?\u201dZhao Yu did not decipher the meaning of Teacher Chen\u2019s question. She was absolutely certain that Qiao Nan had complained against her. To Zhao Yu, Teacher Chen was interrogating and not questioning her as Teacher Chen had always believed in whatever Qiao Nan said.After all, Teacher Chen had always liked Qiao Nan and treated her exceptionally well.Teacher Chen even gave Qiao Nan a place for the essay competition behind closed doors. It was impossible that Teacher Chen would not believe Qiao Nan\u2019s words.\u201cTeacher Chen, I was wronged. Those pens were not broken by me. Qiao Nan cannot malign others and blame it on me just because her pens were broken.\u201d Unless Qiao Nan had evidence, otherwise, she would never admit to it. Zhao Yu cried in front of Teacher Chen.\u201cI know I have a bad temper and Qiao Nan doesn\u2019t like me. But we are classmates, even if she disliked me, she shouldn\u2019t bully me like that\u2026 Teacher Chen, trust me, I, I really did not do it.\u201dAt the sight of Zhao Yu who was crying miserably, Qiao Nan did not know what happened but she suddenly saw a hint of Qiao Zijin in Zhao Yu.In the previous life, when Qiao Zijin was broke, she cried to her mother in this manner too.When Qiao Zijin was pregnant with Chen Jun\u2019s child, she also sat by the side and sobbed quietly while she watched her mother hit and scold Qiao Nan to force Qiao Nan to give up the relationship.At the time when she was just reborn to this life, her ears were hurt by her mother and Brother Zhai also taught her to use a similar crying tactic on her father. Crying was so handy.\u201cThe pens were broken, all broken?\u201d When Teacher heard this, he felt that something was not right. Although his mood had been dampened by Zhao Yu\u2019s tears, he remained calm and manage to grasp the point made by Zhao Yu. \u201cQiao Nan, what exactly is happening?\u201d\u201cDuring the essay competition, I brought three pens. One is the usual pen that I used, the other two were brand new. However, strangely, none of the pens worked during the competition. Fortunately, someone lent me a pen. Otherwise, most likely I would not have been able to participate in the competition,\u201d Qiao Nan told Teacher Chen honestly.\u201cBorrow a pen, who lent you the pen?\u201d Teacher Chen was alarmed. If Qiao Nan did not manage to borrow a pen, they would have a close brush with the first place, and would have let slip the championship that was already in their hands.\u201cIt was a big brother from my neighborhood. He happened to pass by and lent me a fountain pen. Zhao Yu was in the same exam hall as me, when the invigilator was helping me to borrow a pen, Zhao Yu did not say anything. Zhao Yu also only brought one pen, I can understand this. Zhao Yu, I did not blame you.\u201d Qiao Nan smiled at Zhao Yu amicably.Teacher Chen was not the only one present in the office, and every teacher brought their brains to work.Which student would bring only one pen to participate in the competition or exam. In other words, when Qiao Nan\u2019s pen was broken, Zhao Yu was not willing to lend one to her. This was a fact.Also, the three working pens that were prepared by Qiao Nan were all broken at the same time.This was strange.They thought of Zhao Yu running to the office, crying that she was maligned and emphasizing that she did not do this.At that moment, the teachers in the office had a feeling that Zhao Yu had exposed her own deed.Zhao Yu did not know the teachers\u2019 thoughts. After she heard the conversation between Teacher Chen and Qiao Nan, she was dumbfounded.Hadn\u2019t Qiao Nan come to the office to complain about her to Teacher Chen?Then, whatever she said just now, was it not\u2026Teacher Chen\u2019s face was gloomy. Obviously he was not in a good mood.Teacher Chen\u2019s chest heaved up and down and he looked at Zhao Yu a few times. \u201cZhao Yu, no-one is maligning you. You may return to the classroom.\u201dTeacher Chen\u2019s words were like a double-edged sword. Zhao Yu\u2019s face turned red with embarrassment.\u201cTeacher, Teacher Chen.\u201d\u201cLeave.\u201d\u201cTeacher Chen\u2019s attitude was firm. Furthermore, there were many teachers in the office. Zhao Yu was still young and not thick-skinned enough. When she heard Teacher Chen, she cried more miserably than before and tears rolled from her eyes uncontrollably as she turned and left.\u201cQiao Nan, why didn\u2019t you tell the teachers? Does Teacher Lee know?\u201d Teacher Chen let out a frustrated sigh. He looked at Qiao Nan sullenly. Qiao Nan was good in everything but she was too kind and easily bullied by others.As the form teacher, he knew that Zhao Yu had been making things difficult for Qiao Nan.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Qiao Nan shook her head. \u201cWhen the car arrived, I went to the restroom to wash my face and left my bag in the car. When I came out, everyone was preparing to enter the exam hall. I discovered that all my pens were broken only when I was attempting the question in the hall.\u201dAfter the competition ended, the teachers sent the students home without any ado.Qiao Nan did not have any chance to mention this matter to Teacher Lee.Furthermore, it was difficult for Qiao Nan to say it. She could not possibly tell Teacher Lee that all the three pens that she brought were broken and she suspected that someone had intentionally broken them.Teacher Chen guessed Qiao Nan\u2019s thoughts. \u201cFine, I understand. You have to pay more attention in future. The kids nowadays\u2026 really, they are not as simple as the kids during my generation. They are still so young.\u201dTeacher Chen did not continue further. Anyway, everyone knew what was going on at heart.\u201cTeacher Chen, then I will go back.\u201dAs she left Teacher Chen\u2019s office and passed by the corner, Qiao Nan was held back by Zhao Yu whose eyes were as red as a rabbit due to the crying.Zhao Yu was crying as she choked on her words. \u201cQiao, Qiao Nan you, did you set me up today?\u201dIf Qiao Nan did not look for Teacher Chen in such a hurry, she would not have misunderstood that Qiao Nan was making a complaint about her. After all, Qiao Nan just told Zhu Baoguo about this.\u201cGuess yourself.\u201dZhao Yu was stunned. At this juncture, what was there to guess? \u201cQiao Nan, you did it intentionally. You wanted to malign me. Teacher Chen already favored you so much, why do you still have to smear my reputation?\u201d\u201cThen tell me. How did I set you up? What did I do intentionally, what did I malign you about? If you can narrate the the full story to me from beginning till end, I will pay you respects and apologize to you. Not one thing less.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Was Qiao Nan purposely being unreasonable, would Qiao Nan not know what she was referring to?Didn\u2019t Qiao Nan purposely look for Teacher Chen to cause her to misunderstand that a complaint would be filed, and then made her lose face in front of Teacher Chen and many teachers in the office?\u201cMy classmate Zhao Yu, why are you silent? We should clear up this matter, how did I set you up, what did I malign you about?\u201d Qiao Nan crossed her arms and look coldly at Zhao Yu, while she asked Zhao Yu to explain.\u201cYou know what I mean!\u201d Zhao Yu was so angry that she forgot about crying. She only managed to say one sentence, \u201cYou still dare to instigate Zhu Baoguo to bash me up, Qiao Nan, how can you be so bad!\u201d\u201cFirst, I don\u2019t understand. Second, I didn\u2019t ask Zhu Baoguo to hit you. You\u2019re maligning me.\u201d Qiao Nan laughed. \u201cZhao Yu, don\u2019t say the wrong things next time, I did not malign you.\u201dLeaving these words behind, Qiao Nan walked pass Zhao Yu and returned directly to the classroom.This time, both Qiao Nan and Zhao Yu knew that Qiao Nan did it in purpose when she went to Teacher Chen\u2019s office.Qiao Nan did not talk bad about Zhao Yu in front of Teacher Chen, but she already guessed that Zhao Yu would lose her cool and expose her own deed.If what Zhao Yu said in the office earlier had exposed her own deed, then what Qiao Nan said to Zhao Yu now had the same effect.The only difference was, Zhao Yu was foolish, she also denied her involvement, whereas Qiao Nan was openly mocking Zhao Yu for trying to be smart.Yes, Qiao Nan did it on purpose. What could Zhao Yu do to her?Qiao Nan left. Zhao Yu remained rooted to the spot with a face full of menace. The students who came out of the classroom to make their way to the toilet had a bad fright when they saw Zhao Yu\u2019s menacing look. They nearly turned back. \u201cAren\u2019t you Zhao Yu from Class One, why are you standing here, like being punished, you\u2019re scaring others.\u201dThe other party was a male student, he was utterly shocked by Zhao Yu\u2019s expression.Zhao Yu was quite good looking and talented. Many in the school knew who she was.15, 16 years old were the age where romantic thoughts starts to blossom. It was not uncommon for a few male students to have a crush on a girl like Zhao Yu, and the student in front of her was one of them.However, when he saw Zhao Yu\u2019s expression, all the positive feelings that the student had for Zhao Yu vanished into thin air in a second.The seemingly gentle and crisp looking girl had turned into such a state. It was insane.Zhao Yu had not been treated in this manner by boys before. At this juncture, her expression turned even uglier, scaring the male student who ran away without further thoughts. It was as if a dog was chasing him.\u201cI\u2019m so mad, everyone is opposing me.\u201d Zhao Yu\u2019s face was pale with anger, but to prevent others from seeing this dysfunctional side of her again, she could only revert to her normal self before returning to the classroom.At the thought that she made such a big blunder all because of Qiao Nan, Zhao Yu lifted her eyes and wanted to glare at Qiao Nan.Without waiting for Zhao Yu\u2019s glare, Zhu Baoguo raised his eyebrows and cast an unfriendly look at Zhao Yu. Zhao Yu was so scared that she bowed her head and returned to her seat quietly.\u201cSee, a kind person is liable to be bullied, a tamed horse is often ridden,\u201d Zhu Baoguo snorted and boasted to Qiao Nan. \u201cI know this kind of person well, they bully the weak and fear the strong. She only picks the soft persimmons to pinch. You\u2019re too good-tempered. If it were me, I would bash her till she was toothless!\u201d\u201cI have a good temper?\u201d Qiao Nan was amused. She was not good tempered, she had been stabbed in the back numerous times and as a result, she was now used to playing similar tricks.She did not take revenge on Zhao Yu openly, but she also did not let her off easily.Zhao Yu wanted to be a model student, an obedient teacher\u2019s pet.What Zhao Yu said in Teacher Chen\u2019s office today \u2013 not only Teacher Chen, Teacher Lee would definitely know about it soon.If any of the teachers had a loud mouth, Zhao Yu\u2019s reputation among the teachers in junior high school would be tarnished.However, Zhao Yu was already in Secondary Three and the semester was ending soon.Otherwise, there would really be a good show to watch.At these thoughts, Qiao Nan really did not think that she was a pushover with a weak character.\u201cIf you\u2019re not good, then who is.\u201d Zhu Baoguo rolled his eyes. \u201cXiao Qiao, let me tell you, you can\u2019t be like this, when you enter the society next time, you are designated to be bullied badly by others. People like Zhao Yu has to be dealt with, till she is fearful so that she dare not give you troubles in future.\u201d\u201cI agree with what you said.\u201d Qiao Nan nodded her head.She ignored Zhao Yu previously, but in the end, Zhao Yu broke all her pens before the competition.So the ignoring tactic did not work on Zhao Yu. Zhao Yu was singing a one-man show and was getting more enthusiastic as she went along.Thinking, Qiao Nan took a glance at Zhu Baoguo, the reason that Zhao Yu created so much trouble was probably somewhat related to Zhu Baoguo.The matter regarding the essay competition, as per Qiao Nan\u2019s prediction, after Teacher Chen told Teacher Lee, one of the teachers disseminated this widely and Zhao Yu became infamous amongst the teachers.Nevertheless, as everyone were Teachers and the other party was just a student who, most importantly, did not belong to their class, they passed around the story but did not magnify the matter.Furthermore, Zhao Yu denied that she ever did this and there was no evidence. What could they say?But this was enough to make Zhao Yu embarrassed and uneasy. Moreover, after Zhu Baoguo\u2019s threats, Zhao Yu was fearful everyday and dared not go home alone. She had to pull along a few friends to accompany her before she feel safe to go home.Seeing Zhao Yu, Zhu Baoguo snorted with disdain.The winter in Ping Cheng was especially cold, everyone was already in their thick and padded winter attire, as the north wind blew, the weather was unbearable. During this time, the students who were holding part-time jobs took the hardest hit.\u201cThe weather is so cold.\u201d Qiao Dongliang put away his bicycle while he rubbed his hands and stomped his feet. \u201cNan Nan, is your school having the final year examination soon?\u201d\u201cWe are taking the exam next week.\u201d Qiao Nan poured Qiao Dongliang a cup of hot tea to warm him up.As Qiao Dongliang held the cup of warm tea in his hands, he suddenly felt revived. His frown relaxed. \u201cSo soon, how\u2019s your preparations going along?\u201d\u201cStill fine.\u201d During the past six months, Qiao Nan had caught up with what she had missed.In the coming final year examination, they would mainly be tested on what the teachers had taught them during this semester. Hence, Qiao Nan was more confident.\u201cThat\u2019s good, then how about Baoguo, can he do well?\u201d After asking about Qiao Nan, Qiao Dongliang immediately asked about Zhu Baoguo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those who did not do well usually but performed in the exams, those who did well usually but failed to perform in the exams, or those who have consistent results during the normal days and exam.Qiao Nan was not sure what category Zhu Baoguo belonged to.\u201cNo issue. Before the exams, you can give him another push and help him to guess the questions. At the very least, let him pass his exams.\u201d Qiao Dongliang did not expect too much. Zhu Baoguo failed the last round of exams, he hope that Zhu Baoguo would pass on this occasion.\u201cThat should not be a problem.\u201d\u201cNot a problem, you\u2019re so certain. That\u2019s good.\u201d Qiao Dongliang was delighted. If Baoguo could pass the exams, he would have progressed significantly in his studies.\u201cNan Nan, do you wish to buy anything during the Lunar New Year? Tell Dad. Dad will buy for you.\u201d Qiao Dongliang was rarely generous.\u201cDad, can I have a set of new clothes of my own?\u201d This year, she did not wish to wear the used clothes of Qiao Zijin again.During this time of the year, Qiao Zijin would always pass her unwanted clothes to Qiao Zijin. At the thought of this, Qiao Nan felt sorry for herself.\u201cGood!\u201d Qiao Dongliang was surprised for a while, then he agreed. \u201cAfter you finished your exams, during your vacation, Dad will take you shopping. You can choose what you like, okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYes what yes, don\u2019t buy. There\u2019s so many clothes at home. Don\u2019t waste money unnecessarily.\u201d Ding Jiayi was a spoilsport when she opened her mouth. \u201cYour sister has so many clothes, all good, if you really want, I\u2019ll take a few out to let you choose two.\u201dHaving said that, Ding Jiayi felt the pinch. Thereafter, she would have to think carefully about which were the clothes that Zijin disliked wearing over the recent years.If she gave those that Zijin liked to Qiao Nan, Zijin would most likely throw a fit.\u201cI\u2019m buying and not using your money. Nan Nan\u2019s matters, you don\u2019t need to bother.\u201d Although he knew what Ding Jiayi was thinking, Qiao Dongliang found it embarrassing to scold Ding Jiayi in front of Qiao Nan.The elder daughter had new clothes to wear every year, the younger daughter could only pick up the unwanted clothes of the elder one. At the thought of what Elder Lee told him before, Qiao Dongliang\u2019s face was burning a little with embarrassment.\u201cNo, you can\u2019t waste money like that.\u201d Ding was unhappy. \u201cZijin is studying in high school now, the students in her school are either smart or has good family background. If you\u2019re buying one more set of clothes for Zijin, I can understand. It\u2019s not that Qiao Nan does not have any clothes to wear, why care about this when we are so poor?\u201d\u201cDo you mean that Zijin should wear new clothes, whereas when Nan Nan does so, she is asking for too much?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was angered. \u201cI have said, I will take care of Nan Nan\u2019s matters, you stand aside. You don\u2019t allow me to buy. Nan Nan, let\u2019s go, Dad will take you to buy now. We pick two sets instead of one. You can wear them interchangeably during the Lunar New Year. As for dinner, Dad will take you to the restaurant!\u201d\u201cOkay, I listen to Dad.\u201d Qiao Nan stood near Qiao Dongliang. She intentionally picked a place that was further away from Ding Jiayi.After being hit by Ding Jiayi numerous times, Qiao Nan was accustomed to this type of situations. He mother would definitely be the first to bash her during such times.True enough, when she heard that Qiao Nan was such a spendthrift and refused to listen to advice, Ding Jiayi raised her hand and wanted to hit Qiao Nan a few times, but she could not as Qiao Nan avoided her too well.\u201cNan Nan, let\u2019s go, Dad happens to have money in the pocket today.\u201d Moving away from Ding Jiayi and avoiding her ugly expression, Qiao Dongliang left immediately as he pulled Qiao Nan along to buy her new clothes.Qiao Nan was not sure if this was because Qiao Dongliang was delighted as she assured Qiao Dongliang that Zhu Baoguo would pass the coming examination. He really led Qiao Nan shopping and bought her two full sets of new clothing, from head and toe.At the sight of so many new clothes, Qiao Nan\u2019s mind was blank as blinked her big eyes. She dared not believe what she saw.She thought that her father\u2019s earlier words were said deliberately to anger her mother, never did she think that he would really buy her two sets of clothing.\u201cWhy, too happy?\u201d Qiao Nan looked like she was in awe. This made Qiao Dongliang felt happy yet sour. Ultimately, Qiao Nan had been shortchanged so much.Even if he would be taking in a son-in-law for Zijin, Nan Nan was still his daughter. How could he not dote on her.\u201cYes, I finally have new clothes to wear. I don\u2019t have to wear those unwanted by Sister anymore.\u201dThis simple comment of Qiao Nan was accompanied with sadness.She not only had no chance to wear new clothes, but also had no chance to wear those that Qiao Zijin liked.She could only wear those clothes that Qiao Zijin was sick of and unwilling to wear. Those were akin to a pile of rubbish at home.\u201cThere will be new clothes next time. In future, Dad will buy you at least one set of new clothes every season.\u201d Qiao Dongliang felt very bad.Qiao Dongliang came from the era of poverty and hard life. At that time, the people could not even fill their stomach, not to mention wear good clothes.So, to Qiao Dongliang, he always felt that although the younger daughter was not treated as well as the elder daughter, but she was also clothed and fed, not left hungry or in cold. Hence, he did not feel that he was shortchanging her.However, at this very moment, Qiao Dongliang could no longer maintain this stance.He had made this daughter suffer too much.\u201cNan Nan, all these years, did Dad make you suffer a lot?\u201d\u201cDad, if I coax you and said no, would you believe me?\u201d Having foolishly lived a lifetime, this time, Qiao Nan was not willing to deny and allow herself to continue to suffer.Two lifetimes, she suffered, she suffered so much.\u201cDad, like Sister, I\u2019m also your daughter.\u201dBoth are born to the same parents, but why was she treated so differently from Qiao Zijin? She did not expect equal treatment, but it should not be the way it was now.\u201cYes, both are my daughters,\u201d Qiao Dongliang said. He did not feel good. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the restaurant.\u201dBoth father and daughter ended up eating and drinking to their hearts\u2019 content before going home.Meanwhile, Ding Jiayi was at home facing the cold and quiet house alone. She could only hear her own breathing. She felt so depressed and was close to tears. \u201cThe two of you are so good, do you still take me seriously, do you still treat me like family? Don\u2019t tell me both of you are biological father and daughter, and I\u2019m not your real Mom? Those things that I did, aren\u2019t they for the sake of the family?\u201dAt the sight of Qiao Dongliang and Qiao Nan coming back with bags of new stuff, Ding Jiayi felt the sting in her heart. \u201cThis, this, how much did you all spend, how much did you buy?\u201d From the look of it, it did not look like only one set of clothing and been bought.\u201cNan Nan, take them back to your room and put them away properly. Right, remember to cut away the labels.\u201d Knowing his wife\u2019s character, Qiao Dongliang advised Qiao Nan.Actually, Qiao Nan intended to do this even if Qiao Dongliang did not remind her.If her mother went to return all the new clothes, she would have none to wear. Also, the money from the refund would go in to her mother\u2019s pocket, benefiting Qiao Zijin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She then happily held the clothes in front of herself and even ran to Qiao Dongliang and asked, \u201cDad, do I look good in it?\u201d\u201cNice,\u201d Qiao Dongliang said as he laughed. \u201cIf you like it, you can wear one set to school tomorrow and leave the other for the Lunar New Year.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll listen to Dad.\u201d Although Qiao Nan was not a real 15-year-old, she could not help feeling as happy as a kid as she held the new clothes. Her small face was all red and rosy.The more happy Qiao Nan was, the more jealous Ding Jiayi felt. Her eyes were extremely fierce.\u201cYou actually bought two set of new clothing for Qiao Nan. Then you must buy for Zijin too, buy three for her!\u201d Ding Jiayi made a request.\u201cNo,\u201d Qiao Dongliang rejected flatly. \u201cWe agreed before that you will take care of Zijin\u2019s matters and I will take care of Qiao Nan\u2019s matters. If you wish to buy three sets of clothing for Zijin, sure, I will not stop you. You pay for them yourself.\u201dAfter the depletion of the family savings, Qiao Dongliang had a phobia. He must guard his own money.His wife was too daring. She had spent all the family savings without telling him a thing.He was the head of the family but he only knew about it one to two months after the savings were gone.If she dared to do it once, she would dare to do it again.Their family was already not wealthy and definitely could not afford to spend in this manner.Qiao Dongliang was a little machismo, if not for Ding Jiayi\u2019s spendthrift ways, he would not want to let Ding Jiayi work outside. It would be good enough if she stayed at home and managed the domestic affairs properly.Qiao Dongliang did not interfere in how Ding Jiayi managed her earnings at all, but he must guard his own money.Qiao Dongliang also did not interfere in how Ding Jiayi want to dote on Qiao Zijin. He would not bother about whatever Ding Jiayi spent her money on.However, if Ding Jiayi would like to have his money, Qiao Dongliang was not willing.\u201cThen can you do the same, Zijin is studying in high school and needs to spend a lot more than Qiao Nan. You earn more than me, don\u2019t talk about three sets of clothing, I wanted to buy her ten, you don\u2019t have money?\u201d Ding Jiayi was unhappy.Since Old Qiao found out that she spent all the family savings, although she was also working, Old Qiao had not given her a cent since.Used to managing the household finances, understandably, Ding Jiayi did not feel good when Qiao Dongliang suddenly stopped giving her money.Since she could not get any money, she was hoping that Qiao Dongliang would spend on Qiao Zijin in case he squandered it all on Qiao Nan. But Qiao Dongliang refused. Ding Jiayi was so furious that she wanted to quarrel with Qiao Dongliang.\u201cThat I don\u2019t care, anyway we have agreed before. I know how much you earn. Save a little every month and it would not be difficult for you to pay for Zijin\u2019s tuition fees. You manage your own money and take care of Zijin\u2019s matters. You decide for yourself.\u201d Qiao Dongliang was very shrewd and had it all planned.The younger daughter never had any new clothes but the elder daughter never stopped having them.At this time, Qiao Dongliang realized one thing \u2013 his elder daughter was too extravagant.Previously, Old Ding said that new clothes could last for nine years and that was the norm for all families, so she was not buying any for Qiao Nan. However, her actions were contrary to her words when it came to Zijin.Qiao Dongliang had done an estimation for Ding Jiayi. Her earnings are not more than his but they were sufficient for Qiao Zijin\u2019s living expenses and a set of new clothes per season. With proper savings and management, it would not be a problem to support Zijin till she completed the high school education.Ding Jiayi thought she could have the cake and eat it but Qiao Dongliang had done his calculations.\u201cThat, how can that be the same?\u201d Ding Jiayi was dumbfounded with anger. Why should Zijin and Qiao Nan be treated equally, was Qiao Nan fit to receive the same treatment?\u201cHow is it different?\u201d Qiao Dongliang sneered. \u201cYou tell me, what exactly is the difference?\u201d\u201cYou, you, Old Qiao, why are you so unreasonable?\u201d Ding Jiayi did not know what to say.\u201cRighteousness will see you through all difficulties whereas without it, your progress will be hampered from the very start. Why am I unreasonable, you tell me, who is the one being unreasonable?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was also light headed, clearly Old Ding was the unreasonable one but she blamed it on others. How could she do that?Because of this matter, Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi nearly quarreled.Qiao Nan did not say a word and simply went back to her bedroom. She held the principle of not getting involved and not watching, while she carried on quietly with her own matters.\u201cYou still treat her so well. She saw both of us quarreling but she just left without a care. She\u2019s a heartless thing, you still bought her so many new clothes!\u201d Ding Jiayi pointed at Qiao Nan\u2019s room and yelled at the top of her voice.Ding Jiayi deliberately shouted these words for Qiao Nan\u2019s ears.She hoped that Qiao Nan could come out to mitigate and expel the anger between Qiao Dongliang and her.There was only silence from Qiao Nan\u2019s room as Ding Jiayi\u2019s words fell on deaf ears.\u201cThere is nothing wrong with Nan Nan. The two of us are quarreling, she\u2019s just a kid and should not interfere. Are you hoping that she will help you or are you willing to see her help me to deal with you?\u201d Qiao Dongliang was both amused and angry.To Qiao Dongliang, Qiao Nan was undoubtedly doing the right thing by returning to her bedroom.If Qiao Nan helped him, she would be unfilial to Old Ding. If she helped Old Ding to persuade him, then she was not differentiating what was right from wrong.A child would not be able to interfere in the matters relating to adults. He felt that Nan Nan\u2019s way of handling the matter was appropriate.\u201cYes yes yes. To you, whatever Nan Nan does is always right and whatever I do is always wrong. You no longer care about Zijin, you only have Nan Nan in your eyes. Don\u2019t forget, Zijin is the one who will remain in the family in future. What\u2019s the use of treating Nan Nan so well?!\u201d Ding Jiayi said with much anger and anxiety. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you get this clear?\u201dQiao Nan would eventually be married to another family, Zijin was the one who would stay in this family forever.Giving Qiao Nan more would only benefit others. By doing all these, Old Qiao was favoring an outsider instead of someone of his own?\u201cUtter nonsense.\u201d Qiao Dongliang gasped. \u201cSave your breath. Nan Nan is also my daughter. Why can\u2019t I be good to her? You don\u2019t need to quarrel with me too, anyway, I will not give you money. You better save more, when the school reopens next year, don\u2019t tell me you are unable to pay for Zijin\u2019s tuition fees. I can tell you with certainty now, if that really happens, you have to think of a way out yourself, I will not fork out a single cent.\u201dQiao Dongliang was afraid that Ding Jiayi would not take his words seriously, that she would say one thing and do another by spending all her money on Qiao Zijin during the Lunar New Year, and then expect Qiao Dongliang to pay Qiao Zijin\u2019s tuition fees. He might as well give Ding Jiayi a warning in advance.\u201cYou, by doing this, if Zijin knows about this, she will be so hurt. Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t want Zijin to continue with her studies?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDing Jiayi was dumbfounded. When had Old Qiao become so heartless and indifferent towards Zijin?\u201cZijin still has you, as long as you are able to take care proper care of the finances, I believe Zijin can definitely continue in her studies. Furthermore, the school will not make the student drop out immediately when the school fees are not paid. You can just think of a way to resolve this. But knowing Zijin, she is usually concerned about her face, she will not have any mood to study if the school fees are owing. Heed my advice, manage your money properly and don\u2019t let Zijin be in a difficult position. What happened during the essay competition has already left the teachers with a bad impression of her. Having said this, you should think about what you need to do.\u201dIn the past, he had really indulged Old Ding too much and allowed her to spoil Zijin.Although he would be taking in a son-in-law for Zijin and Nan Nan would be married to another family, both were his own daughters. There was no reason that Zijin could have a few sets of new clothes in a year while Nan Nan could not get any.Uncle Lee was right. He was too muddle-headed in the past.If he continued to let Old Ding manage the household, the family would be in a mess.Qiao Dongliang had made up his mind to suppress Ding Jiayi\u2019s bad temper. Even though the five fingers on one hand are of different length, and favoritism is inevitable in parent-child relationship, Old Ding was too extreme in her treatment towards Nan Nan.Leaving Ding Jiayi behind, Qiao Dongliang washed up and went to bed. He did not bother about Ding Jiayi.This time, Ding Jiayi was really furious and heartbroken. She sat in the living room alone, slouching, and wiping away the tears at the corner of her eyes from time to time, crying silently.For some time, only the sounds of Ding Jiayi\u2019s sobbing and breathing could be heard intermittently from the living room.Ding Jiayi sat alone until she was cold and numb, then she slowly got up and went to the bedroom without even washing her face.Looking at the bump covered by the blanket on the bed, Ding Jiayi sniffed, took off her clothes and got into bed silently.Although the person lying next to her had a high body temperature and she should feel the warmth, Ding Jiayi felt so bitterly disappointed that she was chilled to the bone.She was married to this man for more than decade. For the sake of him, she managed the household affairs and was busy all the time, didn\u2019t she do all these for the family and this man?Ding Jiayi sobbed a few times and gave a long sigh before she closed her eyes and slept.One semester had passed in the blink of an eye, Qiao Nan finished her exams earlier than Qiao Zijin. Qiao Zijin\u2019s exam ended two days later and also reached home late, she finally had a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201cMom, we finished our exams. Today\u2019s weather is good, shall we go shopping for new clothes?\u201d On the next day, Qiao Zijin\u2019s mind was all on shopping for new clothes when she woke up. \u201cMom, the newly arrived clothes for the Lunar New Year are so beautiful. My classmates are all so well-dressed and they have so many clothes, Mom\u2026 \u201dQiao Zijin stretched her tone and spoke like a spoiled child.In fact, Qiao Zijin already knew what she wanted to buy, she had her eyes on four sets of clothes that she liked very much.Qiao Zijin was not confident that her mother would buy all four sets of clothing, but she was sure that she could get at least three sets if she tried hard enough.\u201cHow many sets did you have your eyes on?\u201d Of course, Ding Jiayi understood Qiao Zijin well, she knew what Qiao Zijin was thinking when Qiao Zijin behaved this way.\u201cNot a lot, just, just four sets.\u201dDing Jiayi was asking for the number of pieces, but Qiao Zijin signaled that she was keen on four sets of clothing.Ding Jiayi gasped. When they had savings at home previously, she also did not have the habit of buying four sets of new clothes for Zijin at once. \u201cZijin, I need to let you know a situation, you then consider for yourself how many new clothes to buy this year.\u201dBecause of Qiao Dongliang\u2019s words, Ding Jiayi was compelled to do some calculations on how much money she had on hand.Ding Jiayi doted on Qiao Zijin very much. Whenever Qiao Zijin made a request, she would always accede to them if they were within her means to provide.As such, during the past four months, Ding Jiayi did not save a lot. If she hoped to pay off Qiao Zijin\u2019s tuition fees for the next semester, she would have to work longer and she dared not even take a break from work early to celebrate the Lunar New Year.Hence, Ding Jiayi could not afford to buy any new clothes for Qiao Zijin.Ding Jiayi\u2019s words stunned Qiao Zijin. \u201cNo money, you can ask from Dad.\u201d Her father, not her mother, earned the most in the family. \u201cYou pay for my clothes and then ask Dad for my tuition fees.\u201dIn this way, we could have the best of both worlds.\u201cYour dad already said. I will take care of your matters and he will not interfere. If I am not able to cough up your tuition fees, he will not help and I have to think of a way to settle it myself.\u201d\u201cDad really said that? Impossible! You told me last time that he wanted to take in a son-in-law for me.\u201d As such, how could her father be so heartless and really not care about her.If she knew that this would be the case, she would rather swap with Qiao Nan to let her father manage her affairs while her mother managed that of Qiao Nan.Yes, why hadn\u2019t she thought of that earlier?If she was taken care of by her dad, she need not worry about having no money to spend. If Qiao Nan was managed by her mother, her mother would spend all the money on her anyway.\u201cI heard this from the horse\u2019s mouth. I don\u2019t know what drugs Qiao Nan gave your dad, your Dad only has one daughter in his heart now. If I am unable to pay your tuition fees, he asked me to let it be in arrears, while I think of ways to pay gradually.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want!\u201d Before Ding Jiayi could finish her words, Qiao Zijin rejected this notion. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then I would not be able to face anyone in school. I am already in the bad books of my Chinese Teacher. If this really happens, I, I might as well quit my studies!\u201d\u201cHow can you quit school! If you quit, how are you going to find a good job in future? To put it bluntly, you will have let Qiao Nan have her wish if you quit your studies, because all the money in the family will then be used to support her education. It\u2019s the Lunar New Year period and there are many odd jobs available, I will work for a few more days. It should not be a problem to settle your school fees. But your clothes for Lunar New Year\u2026 I probably cannot afford any.\u201dQiao Zijin frowned instantly. \u201cCan\u2019t we talk about this further? I don\u2019t want four sets now, can I have two instead?\u201d This was one set less than what she had expected. Qiao Zijin was extremely unhappy.\u201cTwo sets?\u201d Ding Jiayi smiled bitterly. \u201cMost likely not even one set, unless you really want to owe the school one semester of tuition fees.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want, if you can\u2019t pay the tuition fees, I will rather not study!\u201d Qiao Zijin\u2019s face turned stiff and said firmly, \u201cWhat about Qiao Nan\u2019s tuition fees?!\u201d\u201cThere would not be a problem for Qiao Nan\u2019s tuition fees. Your Dad had already prepared it.\u201d\u201cMom, this won\u2019t do. We still need to buy the clothes, not two, but at least one set for the Lunar New Year? Regarding the tuition fees, how much are you short of? Can we borrow from Dad? If my Dad won\u2019t lend, then borrow from Qiao Nan, let her pay the tuition fees late.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But when it was about Qiao Nan, she thought it was all right and proper to do that.\u201cQiao Nan that wretched girl has become so stubborn now, she is no longer as submissive as she used to be. I could bring myself to say this, yet Qiao Nan was not willing to obey?\u201d Ding Jiayi was not silly either, she used to dislike this daughter, of course, she still had no likings for her now.But in comparison, Qiao Nan was considered to be a very obedient daughter.If she ordered her to head east, she would not dare to head west; if she ordered her to walk, she would not dare to run.But now, one sentence from Ding Jiayi, and Qiao Nan would rebut her with ten sentences. Even if Qiao Nan kept her silence and did not retort, she would not obey her words either.\u201cMom, Qiao Nan has changed, she was not like this in the past. Why does she have a change in temperament ever since her fever last time?\u201d Qiao Zijin frowned and grunted.\u201cNow that you mention it, it really seems like it.\u201d Ding Jiayi puckered her lips, \u201cDid she discover something?\u201dWith that, Ding Jiayi cast a meaningful glance at Qiao Zijin.Qiao Zijin stomped her feet in anger. \u201cMom, are you referring to the time when Qiao Nan mentioned that someone opened her windows in the middle of the night. I have already told you that it has nothing to do with me!\u201d\u201cAlright, it\u2019s okay. But since that time, Qiao Nan became weird. Is she by any chance possessed? Her temperament is different now, it was unlike who she used to be.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Qiao Zijin nodded. In the past, whenever their parents quarreled, Qiao Nan was so foolish that she would believe Qiao Zijin\u2019s instigations and tried to be the middleman when they were in fierce arguments. She would try ways to maintain her mother\u2019s dignity even if it meant disregarding her own interests.But recently\u2026Qiao Nan did not try to be affectionate to Ding Jiayi in this half year, in fact she was keeping her distance from her. Qiao Zijin found her sister\u2019s behavior to be very weird.\u201cMom, what do you think is wrong with Qiao Nan, she has changed into a different person. If she was still like who she was used to be previously, everything would be fine for us.\u201d Qiao Zijin had absolute confidence in the Qiao Nan who used to be at her beck and call.Back then, Qiao Zijin had never thought highly of Qiao Nan, but in retrospect, she missed the times back then.\u201cHow would I know what\u2019s wrong with her? That wretched girl won\u2019t listen to me anymore. If you mess with her, she would just go to look for her father. I don\u2019t know what to say, your father is biased towards her now.\u201d Ding Jiayi could not bring herself to tell Qiao Zijin that she had quarreled with Qiao Dongliang for this and she had cried through the whole night, not being able to sleep at all.\u201cThen what should we do?\u201d Qiao Zijin grunted. Why did they have to have two children when they could not even bring up a single child well? \u201cI did not ask for much, I only wanted a new set of clothes. Is that too much to ask for?!\u201dEver since Qiao Nan was born, every new year she would have new clothes. Why did this year has to be an exception?\u201cMom, I am not going to be like Qiao Nan who didn\u2019t even have a piece of new clothing for new year. This year I am not going to pass down my clothes to Qiao Nan.\u201d She had no idea if she would be able to get her new clothes, if she did not have new clothes for new year, she would not hand down her old clothes to Qiao Nan either. Qiao Nan would have to suffer with her.\u201cShe has no use of your new clothes anymore. Your father already went with her to buy two sets of new clothes!\u201d Ding Jiayi gritted her teeth.Ding Jiayi was boiling with anger. She had forgotten to be mindful of Qiao Zijin\u2019s feelings.Qiao Zijin turned pale and her eyes reddened. She might not have any new clothes this year, but yet Qiao Nan could have two sets of new clothes! Tears almost spilled from her eyes. \u201cWhy should she have two new sets of clothes while I don\u2019t have any at all?\u201dThis year why did it seem like she and Qiao Nan had reversed their fates? She was being treated unfairly while Qiao Nan was being treated like a princess?\u201cDon\u2019t ask me about this, it\u2019s your father who bought Qiao Nan her new clothes.\u201d Ding Jiayi had a splitting headache. \u201cAlright, Zijin, every year you have quite a lot of new clothes, you bought a few sets this year as well. As for this winter, just give it a miss.\u201dThey could not possibly not hand in Zijin\u2019s school fees for next year just because they wanted to buy new clothes for her?There was no way she could do this, let alone Zijin.Qiao Zijin could not take it lying down after she was sent away by Ding Jiayi.She gritted her teeth and knocked on Qiao Nan\u2019s door. She had lifted her hand in mid air when she remembered that Qiao Nan was not at home.Even when she had finished her exams, Qiao Nan still went to the Lee family residence to tutor Zhu Baoguo.\u201cMom, I am going over to the Lee family residence. Qiao Nan has been intruding on Grandpa Lee for such a long time, as her sister I should thank Grandpa Lee on her behalf.\u201d She also wanted Grandpa Lee to remember that aside from Qiao Nan, her father still had another daughter, and that was her.\u201cFine, do you remember the way there?\u201d Ding Jiayi was more than happy that Qiao Zijin wanted to build good relations with the Lee family.\u201cI remember the way, how could I have forgotten the way to Grandpa Lee\u2019s house.\u201d She did not have any excuses in the past, but now she could use Qiao Nan as an excuse to be closer to the Lee family.The Lee family and the Qiao family all stayed in the same quad, yet the Lee family residence seemed so majestic and grand. Qiao Zijin casted an admiring glance at the Lee family residence. It would be wonderful if she could stay there.\u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d The Lee family residence was not a place that Qiao Zijin could come and go as she pleased, she was stopped by the soldiers at the front door.\u201cI am Qiao Zijin, I am here to look for Grandpa Lee.\u201d Qiao Zijin plastered a sweet smile on her face, and the soldier at the door immediately relaxed his demeanor.\u201cPlease wait here.\u201d The soldier could not let her in at once, he would have to notify the owner first.\u201cI am Qiao Nan\u2019s sister.\u201d Qiao Zijin stiffened. She did not know that it would be such a hassle to enter the Lee family residence. When she used to pass by the house in the past, she would take a few glances, now then she realized that they have a lot of rules and regulations.At the mention of Qiao Nan, the soldier quickly ushered her in. \u201cWell, okay, please come in with me.\u201dThe soldier knew Qiao Nan. When she first came to Lee house, Elder Lee made it a point that all the soldiers must learn to recognize her and instructed them that whenever she came visiting, they should let her in directly.The soldier thought, since Qiao Nan was so close to Chief Lee, Qiao Nan\u2019s biological sister must be on close terms with the Lee family as well.\u201cQiao Nan would drop by every weekend, why haven\u2019t I seen you before?\u201d The soldier looked at Qiao Zijin with curiosity.Qiao Zijin gave a forced smile. She never thought that she was allowed entry to Lee family residence all because of Qiao Nan. \u201cNan Nan is in junior high school now, she has much more free time than me. I stay at the school, I could only go home once or twice a month. So I seldom visit the Lee house.\u201d\u201cSeldom?\u201d The soldier repeated her words, expressing his doubts. Could it be that before he was stationed here, this sister used to come by often?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qiao Zijin might be young, but she knew how to live by her wits.\u201cThen hurry along.\u201d The soldier stepped to one side to let Qiao Zijin in.Qiao Zijin lifted her chin, feeling pleased at the soldier\u2019s attitude towards her. Once she stepped into this door today, her status would no longer be the same as before.\u201cOh, I just felt that this sister looked weird, she was unlike Qiao Nan.\u201d The other soldier frowned in annoyance.Whenever Qiao Nan came to the Lee family residence, even though she was very quiet, she would gave them a smile with a slight nod of her head.But the sister walked in with her chin lifted high up?\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why do you keep picking on the young lady? There\u2019s nothing wrong with her. Aren\u2019t all the young ladies like that? Maybe she had good results in school and that\u2019s why she looked proud.\u201d The soldier knew that Qiao Nan was good in her studies, she was among the top in her school. She even came in first place in the provincial essay competition.With such an outstanding sister, the elder sister must be very brilliant as well.\u201cNan Nan, I am here to see you.\u201d As soon as she stepped into the front door, she was dumbstruck by the furnishings of the Lee family residence. It was ten times that of Qiao family. The hall was very spacious and brightly lit, there was the majestic genuine leather sofa, a big color television as well as other furniture.All these were very new to Qiao Zijin and was something that she desperately yearned for.It would be wonderful if her future house was like this.But if she was to depend on the Qiao family, there was no way that she could dream of leading such a life.\u201cXiao Qiao, who is she?\u201d Zhu Baoguo had never seen Qiao Zijin before. He liked her attitude, since she she was so affectionate to Qiao Nan.\u201cMy elder sister\u2026\u201d Qiao Nan puckered her lips. What was Qiao Zijin doing here?\u201cNan Nan, this is Baoguo?\u201d Qiao Zijin looked at Zhu Baoguo in surprise. Qiao Zijin heard that he was a bully, she always thought that he must be quite ugly looking, or if not, fierce looking, definitely someone not to be trifled with.But when she saw him today, she realized that he was quite good looking.He was just a junior high student, but he was taller than some of the boys in her class.Zhu Baoguo used to spend his days playing under the sun, and as such his complexion was dark. But after staying indoors to recuperate from his injuries for about half a semester, he became much fairer. With his fiery eyes and looks, he would be considered as a hunk.At her high school, Qiao Zijin already had some admirers who were pursuing her. She could not help but blush when she saw Zhu Baoguo.\u201cOh, so it\u2019s Da Qiao, then in the future we will\u2026 \u201d Zhu Baoguo was about to say in the future \u201cwe will be one family\u201d, but he stopped in mid-sentence.Qiao Nan was right about something, Zhu Baoguo was quite smart.Zhu Baoguo thought for a while. He had been spending time with Qiao Nan for half a semester, and she had never brought up this sister of hers, be it praises or complaints.Zhu Baoguo had also heard about the rumors regarding the Qiao family. One minute he was smiling at Qiao Zijin, the next minute his countenance changed. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dZhu Baoguo was all smiles when he saw her, but he had a change of attitude all of a sudden. Qiao Nan must have spoken ill of her in front of Zhu Baoguo!Qiao Zijin shot Qiao Nan an angry stare and said, \u201cI am here to see Nan Nan.\u201d\u201cYou could look at Xiao Qiao when she is back at home, why did you come to Lee house?\u201d Zhu Baoguo had seen all types of people. In particular when he was messing around outside school, there were always a bunch of people who followed him around, Qiao Zijin had the same expression in her eyes as them.\u201cNan Nan has been imposing on Lee family for such a long time, she must have caused Lee family quite a lot of troubles. As her elder sister, I should express my gratitude and my new year greetings to Grandpa Lee in advance. Where is Grandpa Lee?\u201d Qiao Zijin looked around, she did not come looking for Zhu Baoguo, her target was Grandpa Lee.No matter how the Zhu family and Lee family pampered Zhu Baoguo, he still had to obey Grandpa Lee\u2019s words to study and do what he disliked.Qiao Nan and Zhu Baoguo were classmates and desk mates. She must have spoken ill of her in front of Zhu Baoguo.But Grandpa Lee was different. Even if Qiao Nan badmouthed her, Grandpa Lee might not believe her. Maybe she should build relations with Grandpa first.\u201cIt seemed like you were here to suck up to my grandpa.\u201d Zhu Baoguo gave a cold smile at Qiao Zijin for overrating her own abilities. \u201cI have no idea where Grandpa Lee is. But let me warn you, this is Lee house, this is not Qiao house, you had better not wander around, it would not be nice if other people misunderstood your intentions here.\u201dElder Lee was in the study room but Zhu Baoguo refused to tell her. He disliked Qiao Zijin\u2019s attitude. \u201cXiao Qiao, how do we solve this question?\u201d\u201cThe knowledge point to this question could be found at the example question on page 38 of the first volume of Secondary Two textbook. Look through the example question once before you ask me.\u201d Qiao Nan took a glance at the question and could tell where the knowledge point of this question was. She then continued with her revision.Zhu Baoguo gasped in astonishment. Xiao Qiao knew the Mathematics lessons like the back of her hand.Zhu Baoguo was in awed by Qiao Nan\u2019s consciousness. She was really dedicated to her studies.Zhu Baoguo did not go after Qiao Nan for the solution. After hearing her reply, he took out Secondary two Mathematics textbooks and started to flip through them. He searched for the page that Qiao Nan mentioned and finally found the example question of the knowledge point.This was after all a foundation question. Zhu Baoguo studied it and knew how to tackle the question that he had trouble with.Zhu Baoguo went on to the next question after finishing with the current question.Qiao Zijin dared not wandered around at Zhu Baoguo\u2019s stern warning. She sat down quietly by the side, watching the two of them while they did their revision.Qiao Zijin could not help but grit her teeth in frustration when she saw that Zhu Baoguo always did as what Qiao Nan said. He was not the unruly and bad tempered boy that he was known as.If she had known that Zhu Baoguo was so easy to deal with, she would have snatched the task of tutoring Zhu Baoguo for herself.Zhu Baoguo was not good in his studies. With her standard, it was more than enough to tutor him. Who was the one who spread the rumor and made it sound like he was an evil monster?If Zhu Baoguo would listen to her words, it would be easy to tutor him. After all, Lee family and Zhu family did not have high expectation of Zhu Baoguo.\u201cBaoguo, Nan Nan has lagged behind in her studies recently. I am in high school now, and I am studying in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, if you have any questions you can ask me too.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This high school was the best high school in Ping Cheng, Zhu Baoguo would finally know where her standard was.No matter how good Qiao Nan\u2019s results were, she has yet to enroll into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. On the contrary, she was already a student at the high school.Qiao Nan twitched the corner of her lips when she saw the look of arrogance on Qiao Zijin\u2019s face. She would really have to hand it to her to be so obnoxious.\u201cI heard that someone came looking for my Grandpa this year, asking for his help to enroll into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. There\u2019s only a few people who would seek my Grandpa\u2019s help regarding this matter, could that person be you?\u201d Zhu Baoguo was overjoyed, he could not keep his sharp tongue in check.Qiao Zijin who was proud as a rooster flushed red at Zhu Baoguo\u2019s words.She sang her own praises in order to make a good impression in front of Zhu Baoguo, but she had gone a little overboard. She made it sound as if she was just like the other students who entered The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China based on their results.Zhu Baoguo\u2019s words reminded Qiao Zijin of how she managed to enroll into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.But why would Zhu Baoguo know that she enroll into the high school by pulling strings. It must be Qiao Nan!\u201cWho are you glaring at?\u201d Qiao Zijin might be fierce, but she was no match for Zhu Baoguo.Zhu Baoguo stared angrily at her. A young lady like Qiao Zijin could never be his match.Qiao Zijin\u2019s heart shuddered, her voice grew weak. \u201cI, I didn\u2019t glare at you.\u201d She was just frustrated that Qiao Nan spoke ill of her in front of Zhu Baoguo and tarnished her reputation.\u201cAre you allowed to glare at Xiao Qiao?\u201d Zhu Baoguo laughed in anger.When Zhu Baoguo saw Qiao Zijin, he could not help but be reminded of his classmate Zhao Yu.Zhu Baoguo had wanted to settle scores with Zhao Yu, but she was smart, she had anticipated that. She would always be in the company of other students when she went to school or left school, she even dragged a few girls with her when she went to the washroom.Besides Zhao Yu had kept a check on her temper recently. Hence Zhu Baoguo had not laid a finger on her yet.Right now Qiao Zijin resembled Zhao Yu.Zhu Baoguo was puzzled. When he was with Qiao Nan, though she was quiet by nature, when she was angry she would be as fierce as a tigress. Why would other people see her as a pushover and bully her?\u201cQiao Nan is my sister, why can\u2019t I glare at her?!\u201d Qiao Zijin was infuriated. In the past, no one told her off for glaring at Qiao Nan.She not only glared at Qiao Nan, when they were at home she even ordered her around and Qiao Nan could not say no.\u201cNobody say that you can glare at Xiao Qiao as you wish just because she is your younger sister. This is the Lee family residence, you dare to mess with me?\u201d Zhu Baoguo laughed in anger. No one dared to vent their frustration on him.\u201cLet me tell you, I do not have qualms about hitting women. When I see women who deserve a whacking, I would not be lenient!\u201d Zhu Baoguo waved his fists around, he had a ferocious look in his eyes.\u201cYou\u2026 \u201d Qiao Zijin paled, and she started to have regrets.She had wanted to be on close terms with Zhu Baoguo, why did she end up having a quarrel with him? Qiao Nan has to blame for all of these. It was her fault, she was such a jinx!\u201cAlright, don\u2019t be an eyesore here. Judging from your reaction just now, you must be the person who sought my Grandpa\u2019s help. If not for his influences, would you still be able to enroll in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China? You still have the cheek to brag about it. You have no real substance at all.\u201dNo wonder Grandpa asked Xiao Qiao to tutor him instead of this woman right in front of him.Even though they were biological sisters, Da Qiao could not be compared to Xiao Qiao.\u201cHow could you be so sure that it was me and not others?\u201d Qiao Zijin refused to admit that she was the person that Zhu Baoguo was referring to.\u201cWhy not let me ask Grandpa, were you the one who asked him to pull strings for you in order to enroll in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China?\u201d Zhu Baoguo laughed in mockery. If he really wanted to investigate, he could easily find out the truth. It was useless to deny.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Qiao Zijin was so mad that she was rendered speechless. \u201cForget it, since both of you are here to study and I could not be of any help at all, I will go back. Nan Nan, let\u2019s have a very good talk later at home!\u201dQiao Zijin gritted her teeth. She did not manage to pull any strings, instead she was boiling mad at Zhu Baoguo.It seemed like the rumors were true, Zhu Baoguo had a lousy temper.The boys in her class would never treat her in this way.With that Qiao Zijin turned to leave.\u201cOh, is she really your biological sister?\u201d Zhu Baoguo frowned and looked at Qiao Nan with a look of disbelief. \u201cDid she mean that she would settle scores with you later at home? I was the one who was fierce to her, why would she settle scores with you? What did she mean by that?\u201d\u201cShe had the impression that you disliked her as I spoke ill of her in front of you. In that case, she would naturally be after me.\u201d Qiao Nan said matter-of-factly.\u201cAren\u2019t you worried or angry?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no use to worry. If I am angry it would only bring harm to my body. My sister and Zhao Yu belong to the same type of people. If you don\u2019t pay attention to them, they would still be able to kick up a fuss; if you responded to them, they would create a big uproar. No matter what, she did not have the final say over what\u2019s right or wrong.\u201dQiao Nan sensed that Zhu Baoguo was still not over the topic of Qiao Zijin, she raised her eyebrows and said, \u201cYou must be sick of doing the sums and so you started this conversation on purpose? Have you finished all the questions?\u201dNext year would be the last semester of Secondary Three. There was not much time left before middle school exams. Zhu Baoguo was really good at finding excuses to be lazy.Zhu Baoguo twitched the corners of his lips. Why was Xiao Qiao so smart, she was not only good in her studies, she could also see through a person\u2019s mind.But this puzzled him even more. He could not understand why Zhao Yu and Da Qiao picked on someone like Qiao Nan.\u201cStill not concentrating on your studies?\u201d Qiao Nan cast a disdainful look at Zhu Baoguo.In her previous life, she had seen lots of spoilt brat like Zhu Baoguo.She might not have been to the university, but her English was good, she had attained a level six certificate.Other than taking on some translation work at home, she would also give English tuition to students. Hence she could easily tell what\u2019s on Zhu Baoguo\u2019s mind.If Qiao Nan could not see through Zhu Baoguo, she had no right to be a tutor.Zhu Baoguo could find no ways to retort Qiao Nan. He reined in his bad temper and sat down at his seat, took his pen and continued with his questions.Qiao Nan curled the corner of her lips when she saw that Zhu Baoguo sat back down to study. Although he might be a spoilt brat, compared to the children in the 21st century, Zhu Baoguo was already very obedient.By the time Qiao Nan left Lee family residence and went back to Qiao family residence, other than Qiao Dongliang, Qiao Zijin and Ding Jiayi pulled long faces at her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You still remembered that Qiao Zijin is your sister! Why didn\u2019t you think of this when you defamed your sister in front of outsiders?\u201d Ding Jiayi looked at Qiao Nan in mockery and gave Qiao Dongliang a slanting glance. Old Qiao must have realized now that Qiao Nan did not have a conscience at all.Qiao Dongliang frowned, he did not believe that Nan Nan would be like this.Qiao Nan was not the least bit surprised that Qiao Zijin would accuse her. She took a careful look at Qiao Dongliang, she could not sense any reproval from his demeanor. She relaxed slightly. \u201cMom, let\u2019s put aside whether I defamed sister or not, to put it in the least way, what did I defame sister about?\u201dQiao Zijin and Ding Jiayi were rendered speechless by Qiao Nan\u2019s forceful words. Qiao Dongliang was stunned as well.There was a flicker of doubt in Qiao Dongliang\u2019s eyes. When Qiao Zijin came crying to them and said that she had been wronged, he thought that if it was the truth, Nan Nan was in the wrong. But judging from Nan Nan\u2019s character, she did not seem like she would do such things.Now that he thought about it carefully, when did the younger daughter defame the elder daughter?Qiao Dongliang was deep in his thoughts trying to figure out this problem, while Ding Jiayi and Qiao Zijin turned red with anger, as if they had been insulted.\u201cNan Nan, tell me honestly, did you, did you talk about your sister to Baoguo?\u201d Qiao Dongliang pondered for a long time and picked his words carefully, mindful to remain objective.\u201cNo, Zhu Baoguo did not know my sister. When he saw her, he even asked me who she was.\u201d\u201cYou are a liar, if you have never mentioned about me to Zhu Baoguo, why would he hate me to the core? You must have blackened my name in front of Zhu Baoguo. You still don\u2019t want to admit that you defamed me?\u201d Qiao Zijin jumped up in anger, pointing her finger at Qiao Nan\u2019s nose and shouted at her.\u201cSister, you are not the Chinese currency renminbi, why must everyone in the world like you? As for those who don\u2019t like you, does it mean that I have spoken ill of you in front of every single one of them? Do you mean that you are way more popular than the dollar notes? For some people, money means nothing to them.\u201d Qiao Nan replied coldly.In the 21st century, Grandpa Mao had always been the most popular figure.\u201cImpossible, if you did not speak ill of me, why would Zhu Baoguo hate me?\u201d Qiao Zijin felt so ashamed when she was reminded of Zhu Baoguo\u2019s words. He said that she had no real substance at all, she managed to enroll in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China all because of Elder Lee\u2019s connections.\u201cSister, this is so unjust. How would I know why does Zhu Baoguo dislike you? Maybe you just don\u2019t hit if off with him, how could you blame me for that?\u201d\u201cMom, look at this, Qiao Nan refused to admit that she badmouthed me in front of Zhu Baoguo. There\u2019s no way to get the truth out of her. Qiao Nan is so shameless.\u201d Qiao Zijin was at a loss for words.But Qiao Nan still had lots to say. \u201cDad, do you know what happened? Sister went to Lee family residence. She saw that the both of us were studying. So she walked up to Zhu Baoguo and told him that she is a student of The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, and that she can tutor him. Zhu Baoguo then asked her if she was the person who sought Grandpa Lee\u2019s help to enroll in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.\u201d\u201cWhy would he think that it was me?\u201d Qiao Zijin refused to admit defeat. She did not believe that Qiao Nan did not badmouth her in front of Zhu Baoguo.\u201cBecause you mentioned that you are a student of The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. Why would you ruffle Zhu Baoguo\u2019s feathers? If you don\u2019t believe me you can ask Dad. Dad, how\u2019s Zhu Baoguo\u2019s temper? She told him upfront that she could tutor him. That is tantamount to telling Zhu Baoguo with all smiles that you can lend him money when you obviously know that he is short of money. It is no wonder that he is infuriated.\u201dJunior high school students were at a sensitive age. Qiao Zijin\u2019s words were obviously telling Zhu Baoguo that since his results were not good, she could help him with his studies.\u201cZijin, did you really say that?\u201d Qiao Dongliang stiffened. Even if Zijin had been scolded by Zhu Baoguo, she had no one to blame but herself.Qiao Dongliang knew the nasty temper of Zhu Baoguo.When Zhu Baoguo was younger, if someone was to mention the word \u201cMother\u201d in front of him, he would go all out to beat that person to a pulp.In comparison, Zhu Baoguo had been fairly courteous to his elder daughter.For all he knew, Zhu Baoguo was lenient to Zijin on account of Qiao Nan who was his classmate.In fact, the elder daughter escaped from a beating all because of the younger daughter, yet she lodged complaints of her sister to her parents. Qiao Dongliang did not know what to say.\u201cI, I was trying to be helpful.\u201d Qiao Zijin could not help but stutter. She did not know that her words might enrage Zhu Baoguo.Now that Qiao Zijin thought about it, what she said really deserved a whacking.\u201cEven if you want to be helpful you shouldn\u2019t be so tactless.\u201d Qiao Dongliang sighed.\u201cDad, let\u2019s get back to the previous topic. My sister said that I defamed her, let\u2019s talk about whether I defamed her or not. First, I must make it clear that I never mention a single word about my sister in front of Zhu Baoguo. Other than our studies, Zhu Baoguo and I never talked about other topics at the Lee family residence. Now let\u2019s assume that I really said those words. Dad, think about it, which of those words are defamation, and which of them are the truth? When we talk about defamation, it means that they were all lies, but we all know how my sister enroll in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. If my sister was unhappy about it, at most she could scold me for washing dirty linen in public. Besides, it\u2019s perfectly normal if Zhu Baoguo knew that Mom sought Grandpa Lee\u2019s help.\u201d\u201cWhat rubbish are you talking about? Your, your sister\u2019s enrollment has nothing to do with Uncle Lee.\u201d Ding Jiayi flushed, panic in her eyes. \u201cYour, your sister went to The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China as we forked out money for her. It has got nothing to do with Uncle Lee. If you keep on talking nonsense, I might just sew up your mouth!\u201dDing Jiayi gave Qiao Dongliang a panicked look. She was worried that he would take Qiao Nan\u2019s words for real. He might just blow his top and forbid Qiao Zijin to continue with her studies in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.Qiao Dongliang shot Ding Jiayi a cold glance, \u201cAlright, why should you be angry with Nan Nan, I am very clear who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong!\u201dIf Zhu Baoguo used this to put Zijin down, it was no wonder that she was so angry.\u201cSister, did you say these to Zhu Baoguo?\u201d Qiao Nan looked at Qiao Zijin.As expected, she had guessed it correctly. Her father already knew the story behind her sister\u2019s enrolment to The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.After all they wanted to take in a husband for the elder daughter, unlike what her mother thought, her father would not make Zijin transfer out of The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China for the sake of his face.If her father highly valued Elder Lee above everything, she would not have come to this world at all.Qiao Zijin had an important place in her father\u2019s heart, way more than Qiao Zijin or her mother could have imagined.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Which of the words were lies? When did I defame you?\u201d\u201cOld, Old Qiao.\u201d Ding Jiayi still didn\u2019t get it. She stared at Qiao Dongliang with a look of guilt. \u201cYou, you don\u2019t listen to Qiao Nan\u2019s nonsense, Zijin went to The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China\u2026 \u201d\u201cStop it, no one is to mention this again.\u201d Qiao Dongliang pulled a long face, they had no idea who he was angry at.It was Elder Lee who told Qiao Dongliang about his daughter\u2019s enrollment. Hence there was the possibility that Elder Lee could have mentioned this to Zhu Baoguo as well.Besides, before Elder Lee told him the news, he also had no inkling either. Old Ding and Zijin would never let Nan Nan know about this matter, then how did she come to know about it? Zhu Baoguo must have told her.He had to blame himself for being muddleheaded. The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China was such a prestigious school, one might not be able to enroll in the school despite forking out money, one still had to have connections.\u201cZijin, you must study hard, if not I would be so embarrassed.\u201d Qiao Dongliang sighed, because of Qiao Nan he finally could hold his head high in front of Uncle Lee, but his elder daughter had to create this trouble.But luckily the elder daughter\u2019s results had improved after studying in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.As long as Zijin did well for her studies, Uncle Lee would eventually forget about how she enrolled in the high school.Qiao Zijin paled and nodded her head reluctantly.What did this have to do with her results? She was not Qiao Nan.Initially she had wanted her parents to uphold justice for her, but in the end Qiao Nan remained unscathed. Qiao Zijin who was in low spirits pursed her lips and said, \u201cDad, Mom, it\u2019s late, I will return to my room to read.\u201d\u201cZijin, wait. Apologize to Nan Nan.\u201d Qiao Dongliang stopped Qiao Zijin.\u201cWhy?!\u201d Qiao Zijin widened her eyes in disbelief.Why should she apologize to Qiao Nan, Qiao Nan had bullied and defamed her today. She was thinking to make her kowtow and admit her mistakes.\u201cWhat do you think is the reason?\u201d Qiao Dongliang did not explain, he wanted Qiao Zijin to reflect on her own mistakes. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that your actions and behavior just now were too much, shouldn\u2019t you apologize to Nan Nan? Who was the one who framed and badmouthed people? Zijin, you are ambiguous with your words. You meant to mislead us into having the wrong impressions. And yet you ask me why? Is that how a elder sister should behave? Did the teachers in school teach you to behave in this way?\u201d\u201cWhat are you so angry for? It was just a misunderstanding. We are one family, we shouldn\u2019t be so calculating and acting like outsiders.\u201d Ding Jiayi jumped in to defend Qiao Zijin.\u201cCalculating? Acting like outsiders? Then what about the big spectacle that you created just now, as if you wanted to send punitive forces against someone. Isn\u2019t that calculating, isn\u2019t that treating Nan Nan like outsiders?\u201d Qiao Dongliang shot Ding Jiayi an absurd look and turned to face Qiao Zijin. \u201cZijin, you are more educated than your Mom and you are so intelligent, you wouldn\u2019t be like your Mom who can\u2019t tell right from wrong, right? Should you then make this apology?\u201dShe could not have new clothes and now her father wanted her to apologize. Qiao Zijin\u2019s eyes reddened, she was on the brink of tears. \u201cDad, I was too angry that\u2019s why I\u2026 Nan Nan, don\u2019t take it to heart. I meant no harm, it\u2019s just that Zhu Baoguo dissented me and I, I was anxious. I, I did not do anything bad, Nan Nan, I am sorry.\u201dQiao Zijin then returned to her room with red eyes.\u201cOld Qiao, you are too much.\u201d Ding Jiayi stomped her feet and pointed at Qiao Nan, \u201cIt was all because of you. Will you grow more meat just because your sister apologized to you? You, you are so heartless towards your sister!\u201dQiao Nan who has just been through an unexpected ordeal laughed. She might not grow more meat just because Qiao Zijin apologized to her, but she was happy inside.\u201cAlright, why are you always picking on Nan Nan? Is this the differential treatment between family and outsiders? If you continue to pamper Qiao Zijin, can she survive in the outside world with the way she treats others? Instead of persuading her to change her attitude, you sided with her while she bullied Qiao Nan?\u201d Qiao Dongliang chided Ding Jiayi.\u201cYou! Was it me who pampered Qiao Zijin or you who pampered Qiao Nan? Forget it, now you only have eyes for one daughter. It would be useless to talk to you. You can look after Qiao Nan, I will dote on Zijin, she still has her mother who will protect her.\u201d Ding Jiayi could not take it lying down, she said her piece and went off to comfort Qiao Zijin.\u201cWhat a headache, the child acts this way, the adult also acts this way.\u201d From the looks of it, Zijin learned her bad ways from Old Ding.\u201cDad, I will go back to my room.\u201d Qiao Nan had her dinner at Lee family residence before coming back. She decided to have a bath before turning in. After all, it was chilly in the winter.\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Qiao Dongliang gave a faint sigh. Nobody understood his good intentions.Nobody understood?Some did not wish to know, while some pretended not to know. Qiao Nan belonged to the latter.Her father was trying to inculcate the correct values in Qiao Zijin. He noticed her character flaws and wanted to correct them.Qiao Zijin was not willing to learn and her mother did not feel the need for her to change anything.But since it had nothing to do with her, it did not matter if she understood her father\u2019s intentions or not.Ding Jiayi felt sorry that Qiao Zijin had suffered such grievances today and she could not seek justice for her. She could only watch helplessly while Zijin apologized to Qiao Nan. So in the end, Ding Jiayi agreed to buying a set of new clothes for Qiao Zijin and Qiao Zijin was finally appeased with that.Qiao Zijin was all smiles when she received her new clothes. She was so thrilled that she could not contain her smiles.But on the other hand Ding Jiayi had to take on private handiwork at home so as to buy Zijin her new clothes. She spent a lot of the days bent over the dim lights, working on the handiwork till midnight before going to sleep.There was once when Qiao Nan woke up in the middle of the night to have a cup of tea, and she saw a tired Ding Jiayi rubbing at her eyes till they turned red.\u201cYou sure are enjoying your good night\u2019s sleep, didn\u2019t you see that I am still busy with work. Now that you are on holiday, you should help me out.\u201d Ding Jiayi boiled with anger when she saw Qiao Nan walked past with sleepy eyes and flushed face. \u201cFrom tomorrow onwards, you have to help out!\u201d\u201cAlright, I will let Dad know. From tomorrow onwards, I won\u2019t go to the Lee family residence to tutor Zhu Baoguo.\u201d Qiao Nan did not say no, instead she agreed.Ding Jiayi turned red with anger. \u201cAre you stupid?!\u201dIf Old Qiao discovered that Qiao Nan could not go to Lee family residence as she had to help Ding Jiayi with her private jobs, he would tear her apart.\u201cYou do not have to be at Lee family residence for 24 hours a day. You could come home earlier after tutoring Zhu Baoguo and helped me out. Wear your clothes and start working now. Finish them quickly, I have to prepare for new year.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Qiao Nan rejected her coldly. \u201cI am going back to sleep.\u201d With that, she walked off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: Have A Good Year AheadTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosIn order to coax Qiao Zijin, her mother overstretched her own ability to buy Qiao Zijin new clothes, which led to the lack of funds for Qiao Zijin\u2019s tuition fees. Why should she tidy up the mess for them. No way!\u201cYou dare!\u201d Ding Jiayi\u2019s face was red with anger. \u201cAre you still my daughter, am I still your Mom, I work day and night, you don\u2019t even give me any concern and help me to lessen my burden?\u201d\u201cMom, don\u2019t treat me a fool because I am an honest person. You did all this because you wanted to buy Sister clothes, it\u2019s not because of me. For the sake of sister, you work so hard, and then pulled me along to work overnight while Sister continues with her beauty sleep. You are willing but I am not.\u201d Qiao Nan might as well be frank about it.\u201cYour sister must be tired after studying, why do you always drag her in?\u201d She would not let Zijin do this type of chores.\u201cI\u2019m also tired after attending school.\u201d\u201cHow hard can it be for you, you\u2019re in junior high but your sister is in senior high school!\u201d\u201cFine, I can\u2019t talk sense into you, anyway I\u2019m not doing it, you can do whatever you like.\u201d Qiao Nan turned her back from Ding Jiayi and returned to her bedroom.If she knew what would happen, she would not have woken up. She would rather hang on and continued to sleep.Her mother was probably too exhausted recently, she added too much salt when cooking. If not, she would not have felt so thirsty and woke up in the middle of the night.As she prepared to return to her bedroom, Qiao Nan saw the shadow of Ding Jiayi raising her hand, she said coldly without looking back.\u201cMom, I advised you not to touch me, if you hit me, I will definitely call Dad out. If Dad knows that you are staying up late to work so that you can buy sister new clothes, and Sister still sleeps so early everyday, what will he think of Sister?\u201dTrue enough, after Qiao Nan said this, Ding Jiayi put down her hand unwillingly. \u201cYou just don\u2019t want to let your sister have a good life!\u201d\u201cMom, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s that you don\u2019t want me to do well. If I take over this chore, will you still continue, you will definitely go to bed. Mom, don\u2019t always pick on the honest people, you treat Sister like a treasure and disliked me. It\u2019s okay. I will cherish myself.\u201dQiao Zijin was happy and delighted to wear new clothes, while she had to lose her sleep to help Qiao Zijin with her tuition fees next year.In this lifetime, she would never do such a foolish thing again.After she finished with her words, Qiao Nan decisively went back to her room and shut her door. She closed her eyes and slept within five minutes.Ding Jiayi, who had a stomach full of anger, did five wrongly. The rule is that broken items had to be compensated for. As such, she had to pay for the five broken items before receiving her income. Ding Jiayi was nearly driven crazy this night.Eventually she could not take it anymore, it was already one o\u2019clock, Ding Jiayi put down her chores and returned to the bedroom to sleep.The next day, Ding Jiayi had two obvious dark circles under under her eyes, like those of a panda.Seeing Ding Jiayi this way, Qiao Dongliang and Qiao Nan kept silent unanimously.On the contrary, Qiao Zijin was two-faced. On the surface, she thanked Ding Jiayi for working hard. But when Ding Jiayi was working at home, Qiao Zijin did not even attempt to help Ding Jiayi.Qiao Zijin do not feel for Ding Jiayi, neither did she help Ding Jiayi to lessen her burden, what could Qiao Dongliang and Qiao Nan say?It can be said that the punishment is appropriately given by one and willingly accepted by the other, they are truly a perfect mother-daughter match.Qiao Nan was able to let it go but Qiao Dongliang could not.Through this matter, Qiao Dongliang realized that Qiao Zijin only knew how to pay lip service to her parents, but in terms of action\u2026Qiao Dongliang was able to discover the shortcomings of Qiao Zijin after some observation. In the past, Ding Jiayi had been putting in good words for Qiao Zijin, he really thought that Qiao Zijin was a very obedient and sensible daughter. The only thing was that she was not very good in her studies.But after the recent spate of events, Qiao Dongliang knew that, in reality, things were probably different from what he heard.Nevertheless, Qiao Dongliang insisted not to put his hands in this matter.Despite knowing that money was insufficient, the elder daughter insisted on buying new clothes. Furthermore, the wife indulged in the wrong behavior.So, his wife needed to experience some suffering herself to understand this point.Otherwise, in future, his wife would definitely forsake the larger picture in order to satisfy the elder daughter.From the matter regarding the set of new clothes this year, Qiao Dongliang had a premonition.Whatever the elder daughter wants, Ding Jiayi would certainly find a way to satisfy her, regardless of how difficult it could be. She would try to do it even if it was beyond her ability.This was certainly wrong.If he continued to help his wife, the poor habit would not be changed.One did not wish to interfere, the other could not interfere. Both father and daughter maintained this stance, so Ding Jiayi could only grit her teeth and finish up all the work on hand.Having worked so hard, Ding Jiayi fully regretted doing something beyond her ability just to appease Qiao Zijin. She was not angry with Qiao Zijin for not being understanding, but she blamed Qiao Nan for not helping her. With Qiao Nan\u2019s ability, she could handle all this manual work by herself.Qiao Nan could not read her mother\u2019s mind but she guessed a little. Anyway, it had always been this way in the previous life. In this life, Qiao Nan was already numb.In her previous life, she was deeply harmed under such thinking of Ding Jiayi. In this life, it was good that she was no longer bothered by her mother, and would not carry out such thankless chores.Anyway, regardless of whether she did them or not, she was always the bad guy. She would be stupid to do it.Seeing the nonchalant attitude of Qiao Nan, Ding Jiayi was full of hate to the core but she could not make Qiao Nan budge.She finally understood now that Qiao Nan\u2019s heart was as hard as a stone, she not only always bullied her sister, but also disregard her as a mother. She did not care even if she died of fatigue.True enough, she should not have given birth to this daughter. If she had any matter, she would not expect any help from this daughter.\u201cXiao Qiao, you\u2019re an angel. You\u2019re going to heaven for this final term exam.\u201d The day that the class received their report card, Zhu Baoguo ran over to Qiao Nan to congratulate her as soon as she stepped into the classroom. \u201cWith this, you can have a good year.\u201d\u201cNot really, in our family, grades are not everything.\u201d Qiao Nan was the representative of all things. \u201cDid I fare okay?\u201d\u201cWhat okay, you can\u2019t do better than that!\u201d Zhu Baoguo stared. The top student in the school was actually his deskmate. He would be so proud to let others know this.\u201cHow about you?\u201d Qiao Nan was roughly aware of her own grades, but she was more concerned about Zhu Baoguo\u2019s results.Zhu Baoguo suddenly laughed. \u201cI received almost around 80 marks for the few Science subjects that I took.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. Just a few more marks and it would be excellent.\u201d Qiao Nan gave Zhu Baoguo a thumbs up. It was only half a semester\u2019s time, Zhu Baoguo had a brain better than most.\u201cNo no, all thanks to your help. If not for you, how can I achieve such grades?\u201d The moment he knew his grades, Zhu Baoguo was shocked. Even the Zhu family doubted it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please don\u2019t let it be another person with the same first and last name. They would then be overjoyed for nothing.They were not young anymore and could not take such jokes, especially now that the Lunar New Year was arriving.If they showed off the progress of their child to others, and discovered that this was in fact a misunderstanding, that would be so embarrassing.It was until Teacher Chen\u2019s repeated assurance that the grades he announced earlier belonged to Zhu Baoguo, and there was only one Zhu Baoguo in the school, that they knew that this was definitely not a mistake.Until this very moment, the Zhu family then dared to believe that Zhu Baoguo achieved the groundbreaking results.Because of Zhu Baoguo\u2019s academic performance, the Zhu family was so elated that they nearly set off fireworks to celebrate.Initially, with Zhu Baoguo\u2019s poor grades in the mid-term examinations as a reference, both the Zhu family and Lee family only had one wish \u2013 that was for Zhu Baoguo to pass his examination. This would already be considered an improvement.Unexpectedly, Zhu Baoguo not only passed his exams, but also passed with flying colors. He nearly received the excellent grade, there was a triple leap in his progress!Elder Zhu was so happy that he rubbed Zhu Baoguo\u2019s head. \u201cThe blood of the Zhu family really runs in you, you inherited the intelligence of our old Zhu family. As long as you are willing to learn, that is nothing too difficult for you.\u201dElder Lee simply rolled his eyes when he heard that. What did Zhu Baoguo\u2019s achievement have to do with the Zhu family? That was the credit of his Lee family, their genes are good. Without the Lee family, there would not be such a smart Baoguo.The madly elated Zhu Baoguo said after a while, \u201cGrandpa, regarding this, you are the person that I should thank the most. Fortunately you found Xiao Qiao to be my little teacher. Otherwise, I reckon that there will not be such a day.\u201dAlthough it was only one final examination, the atmosphere in both the Lee family and Zhu family was akin to the festive seasons such as Lunar New Year, lively and high.Seeing that so many family members are concerned for him, Zhu Baoguo felt the warmth in his heart, he thought of what Qiao Nan said to him previously. He then thanked Elder Lee emotionally.The two elders were stunned. Elder Lee smiled, \u201cThe words you just said, did Nan Nan teach you to say them?\u201dHe did not expect his obstinate grandson would say something so sensible and heart-warming all of a sudden.Zhu Baoguo\u2019s face turned red. He did not expect to be exposed by Elder Lee so soon. \u201cGrandpa, can you don\u2019t talk as though I am always so insensible?\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re sensible now.\u201d Elder Lee nodded his head happily, then glanced at Elder Zhu proudly. \u201cUnder the influence of Qiao Nan, you really have become more and more sensible. Grandpa is very happy. As long as you can be good, Grandpa is willing to do anything for you.\u201dFacing the boasting by Elder Lee, Elder Zhu rolled his eyes but he did not refute Elder Lee again.After all, when Elder Lee wanted to find his grandson a teacher of his grandson\u2019s age, he was full of objection and doubt.As it was, the fact speaks louder than words. He never thought that a fair, crisp looking and quiet young lady, who would seemingly be bullied by his grandson, was able to teach his grandson so well.Till this moment, Elder Zhu was still in a state of disbelief. \u201cOld Lee, when are you going to invite that child over and let our two families treat her to a meal?\u201dSuch a young lady, she not only saved their grandson, but also transformed him. What she did was really hard to come by.\u201cIf this young lady meet with any problems at home, she can come to both of our families in future. If your Lee family cannot help, our Zhu family can step in.\u201d\u201cI know what to do about this.\u201d Thinking of the situation in the Qiao family, Elder Lee replied briefly without giving a straight answer.Dirty linen should not be aired in public. This was a private matter of the Qiao family, it was not convenient for Elder Lee to help Qiao Nan spread to the whole world her mis-encounters in the family.Elder Lee did not feel for Ding Jiayi, but his heart softened for his nephew, Qiao Dongliang.\u201cGrandpa, please don\u2019t do anything hasty. I will think of how to thank Xiao Qiao myself. I have my own thoughts, you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d Zhu Baoguo was not pleased. He was the one that received help, and should be the one to say thank you too.Hence, as soon as he arrived in school today, Zhu Baoguo told Qiao Nan her grades immediately when he saw her. He also said thank you to her in a very sincere manner.\u201cAlright. If you really want to thank me. Wait for half a year later.\u201d\u201cDo you have so much confidence in me?\u201dZhu Baoguo looked at Qiao Nan in disbelief.Half a year later, that would be the middle school examination. What Xiao Qiao meant was to look at his academic performance for that?Although he scored good grades for the final examination, Zhu Baoguo dared not pin too high hopes on himself. He might not be able to sustain the good grades or achieve better grades.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that I have confidence in you. I have confidence in myself. Haven\u2019t you heard this saying before, in this world, there are no students that don\u2019t know how to learn, there are only teachers who don\u2019t know how to teach?\u201d\u201cI really have not heard of it!\u201dQiao Nan was stunned. Alright. It seemed like she said these words too soon.\u201cBut you are right. There are only teachers who don\u2019t know how to teach in this world. There aren\u2019t any students that don\u2019t know how to learn. I agree.\u201d Zhu Baoguo lifted his chest. His grades were poor in the past as he had not met a good teacher, one that truly knew how to teach. He was really not responsible for it\u201cFine, it\u2019s enough that you know this saying, don\u2019t\u2026 \u201d\u201cDon\u2019t spread, I understand.\u201d Zhu Baoguo nodded his head firmly. \u201cXiao Qiao, no matter what, thank you so much. Thank you for sharing your materials with me. Don\u2019t worry, I have a gift for you in the coming year, I promise that it will be something that you like.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Qiao Nan agreed readily.She did not really want this gift of Zhu Baoguo, but she was more than happy to know that her efforts had been appreciated.Most importantly, based on Qiao Nan\u2019s understanding of Zhu Baoguo, he would probably give her something affordable as a first gift. If she decline, Zhu Baoguo would definitely get something more expensive. The pens that were broken by Zhao Yu previously, the very next day, Zhu Baoguo gave Qiao Nan an imported pen which was obviously not cheap.When Qiao Nan declined, the stubborn Zhu Baoguo nearly stuffed the imported pen into Qiao Nan\u2019s stationery box.\u201cDamn, Qiao Nan\u2019s grades are defying the heavens!\u201d\u201cNo, why don\u2019t Qiao Nan go to heaven. Was she a different person from the beginning of the term?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to get a beating this year again when I go home.\u201dWhen the results were announced based on the rankings and posted on the bulletin board, many people casted their look on Qiao Nan when they saw the name list.In this semester, Qiao Nan was the center of attraction in the entire school.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She left the second place far behind, with a difference of 16 marks between the top and second place.There was only a difference of half a mark between second and third place.Damn, what type of score ratio was this. Qiao Nan was too scary, was she still a human being on the earth?Qiao Nan and Zhu Baoguo would have a good year ahead. However, for some others, they did not look forward to the Lunar New Year as much as before.These were the people who did not score very well. Typically, they could still manage fine, but the exam papers were too difficult this time and many students were not able to perform to their expectations.But compared to Qiao Nan\u2019s grades, these people found it hard to voice their thoughts.Besides Qiao Nan, what was happening to Zhu Baoguo? He was a student who usually ranked one of the last. Now, he had advanced by 100 places and almost reached the level of the outstanding students.Could someone please tell them, what could be done under the sun to make such a poor student become a good one within a short span of time, in half a semester\u2019s time?They also hoped to be like that!\u201cListen to me, Qiao Nan has been giving Zhu Baoguo tuition. Do you think Zhu Baoguo\u2019s results have something to do with Qiao Nan?\u201d\u201cHow is that possible? Many teachers tried to teach Zhu Baoguo but did not succeed. Is Qiao Nan better than the teachers in the school? I don\u2019t believe this.\u201dThe speaker made an unintentional remark, but the listener took it to heart.A group of students standing nearby heard the conversation, they secretly made plans.What if what was said was true? As they belonged to the same class as Qiao Nan, could they make use of their position to seek Qiao Nan\u2019s advice?They did not expect to be like Zhu Baoguo whose grades shot up with the speed of a rocket. But at the very least, they could improve.At this moment, the most dazzling but also the most quiet student, Qiao Nan, was surrounded by many people. It was noisy around her. \u201cQiao Nan, can you help me take a look at this question? We were tested on this but I haven\u2019t figured out the solution.\u201d\u201cLet me see,\u201d Qiao Nan took the question and quietly wrote down the clear and complete solution to the problem on a piece of paper. Her handwriting was exceptionally neat and beautiful, just like her face.Looking at the words of Qiao Nan and then glimpsing her face. Many were lamenting why a person like Qiao Nan, who drew the envy and jealousy of others, existed in this world. These writings could be used for the labeling of altars.\u201cThank you.\u201d The classmate was slightly disappointed that he did not receive a personal explanation from Qiao Nan.But well, it was not uncommon for Qiao Nan, a girl that was pretty and smart, to be a little arrogant and cold.It was only when the student took back the question, that he realized what Qiao Nan wrote had another meaning in it.She had marked the page number where the information could be found in the textbooks.With this, those who asked the questions were not stupid, they could do some research, and eventually understand the solution.\u201cQiao Nan, thank you. \u201d They did not expect that Qiao Nan, who usually seemed arrogant and aloof, was actually quite easy to get along with. She was really willing to answer his question, no wonder Teacher Chen liked Qiao Nan so much.\u201cQiao Nan, I too have a question that I don\u2019t know the solution. Can you teach me too?\u201d With the first example, the rest of the students who held the same thought were more daring to come up to Qiao Nan.Within minutes, those unsociable classmates who once avoided Zhu Baoguo and disliked Qiao Nan were surrounding Qiao Nan in a impenetrable crowd.When these people finally left, Zhu Baoguo looked at Qiao Nan. \u201cIf all of them were like me, with faster progression in their learning, whoever you taught today will become your enemy tomorrow to compete with you for the top place in the school. Why are you so generous? You see if these people are willing to answer you if you ask them questions.\u201d\u201cIf they can take away my first place just because I answer the few questions that they have, then I am a product of imitation. Don\u2019t you think it was good to see Zhao Yu\u2019s expression just now?\u201d\u201cHa ha ha, this is true!\u201d At the mention of Zhao Yu, Zhu Baoguo felt better.In the past, Zhao Yu had always been the popular one. She also enjoyed the attention. But now the person being surrounded by many was the one she hated most \u2013 Qiao Nan. From the beginning till the end of this year, Zhao Yu was absolutely unhappy.\u201cAlright. Next, I will distribute your report card. Keep it properly. Please also give this letter, addressed to your parents, to your parents. I have told you in the beginning of the school term that after the final examination, we will be holding a Parent-Teacher Conference. I hope that all your parents can attend. Next, I will give out the school\u2019s three model student awards, class\u2019s three model student awards and the outstanding class committee member award.\u201dTeacher Chen gave out everything in lightning speed.This time, Teacher Chen was very happy. He had a belly full of words, but these words were not meant for Qiao Nan, they were for her parents.Qiao Nan was not only intelligent, but also very diligent and conscientious in her studies. Her learning attitude was very enthusiastic and positive.Qiao Nan not only improved herself, but also helped Zhu Baoguo to become better. Which student in the world could give the teachers fewer worries than Qiao Nan?The few awards were given out quickly, even Zhu Baoguo received a Good Progress Award. Only Zhao Yu, who held quite an important role of Language Representative, did not receive any award.Seeing that she did not even get the outstanding class committee member award, Zhao Yu nearly stood up to question Teacher Chen. She was clearly very outstanding and had received awards every year. Why was she not given any for this semester?But when she thought of the stupid things that she said when she was in the teacher\u2019s office previously, she very reluctantly shut her mouth and chose to be silent.\u201cCheers!\u201d Holding the School\u2019s Top Three Model Student Award, Qiao Nan did not go home immediately, instead, she went to the Zhai family\u2019s residence.What happened to the previous certificate awards was in the past, but from now onwards, she did not want her mother to treat all her future awards like waste papers and burn them.Who knows, when Qiao Nan opened the door, she was frightened by a tall figure in the room.\u201cBe careful.\u201d Seeing that Qiao Nan was going to fall, Zhai Sheng reached out and grabbed Qiao Nan\u2019s arms.But he did not expect that Qiao Nan was still so light after half a year. With some strength, Zhai Sheng accidentally pulled Qiao Nan directly into his arms.Qiao Nan\u2019s little nose unavoidably hit the chest of Zhai Sheng. It was so painful that tears welled up in her eyes. Prince Charming was indeed Prince Charming, his chest muscles were so firm and developed, this was the real \u201cmurder\u201d weapon on earth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He reached out and tried to help Qiao Nan rub her nose.With the rub, Qiao Na\u2019s pain intensified and she felt like she was being tortured.To prevent Zhai Sheng from torturing her again, Qiao Nan was exceptionally courageous, she grabbed Zhai Sheng\u2019s hands to stop him from moving.When Zhai Sheng sensed that the hands that grabbed him were so soft and seemingly boneless, he felt his heart fluttering a little. What did this feeling mean? Zhai Sheng, who knew nothing about romance, did not really understand.Zhai Sheng, who did not like things to get beyond his control, suppressed the strange feeling he had and calmly retracted his hands. \u201cWhen you came, what were you holding in your hands?\u201d\u201cCertificate of Award,\u201d Qiao Nan\u2019s eyes lit up, she not only showed Zhai Sheng her awards, but also took out her report card, as if she was presenting him with some treasure. \u201cBrother Zhai, see, these are my grades for the final examination. Oh yes, Brother Zhai, I was at the essay competition when you lent me your pen, and I clinched the first place. I heard that I will be awarded some merit points for my middle school examination because of this. But I don\u2019t know how many points.\u201d\u201cNot bad.\u201d Zhai Sheng looked through Qiao Nan\u2019s items one by one, his eyes flashed with satisfaction and approval.\u201cBrother Zhai, here\u2019s your pen.\u201d Qiao Nan had originally placed the pen in the storeroom and intended to let Brother Zhai take it himself when he was back.But a few days after she placed the pen, she saw that it was still there, untouched. She had previously heard from Zhu Baoguo that the pen was quite expensive. Although this was the Zhai family\u2019s residence, she was still afraid to lose the pen. Hence, she took it back and kept it with her.To Zhai Sheng, this pen had a significant meaning, he had always intended to take it back.However, he was in such a hurry that day. After Zhai Sheng lent Qiao Nan the pen, he left the school immediately, before returning to the Zhai family to change his clothes and then quickly made his way to the army.The good thing was that both of them stayed in the same quad, and Qiao Nan usually stored away her books in the Zhai family\u2019s residence. So Zhai Sheng was never worried that he would lose the pen.However, when Zhai Sheng held the pen that Qiao Nan had been treating like a rare gem, he could feel the slight warmth of Qiao Nan\u2019s body temperature and a tinge of her fragrance, his body reacted before his brain could. He tucked the pen back into Qiao Nan\u2019s hands, and said, \u201cTreat this as a reward for your good grades in the exam.\u201dWhen he realized what he had done and said, he was surprised but had no regrets.It was not until many years later, when Zhai Sheng and Qiao Nan used this pen to sign their marriage vows agreement, that he marveled at his wisdom and decisiveness on that very faithful day. With a little pen, he managed to capture the heart of such an outstanding girl to become part of his family.Otherwise, this sweet, young thing would not have fallen into prey into the arms of a big bad wolf like himself, and had little wolves thereafter.\u201cGive it to me? Don\u2019t,\u201d Qiao Nan declined. \u201cAll this while, Brother Zhai had helped me so much, I don\u2019t have the ability now, otherwise I should be the one giving you something, I feel embarrassed to accept your gift.\u201d She was not so thick-skinned.There was no reason for Zhai Sheng to retrieve a gift that was already given. \u201cTake it, when you have the ability, then talk about what you will give me, but on the premise that it would not result in a corruption crime.\u201d\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Under that intimidating look of Zhai Sheng, Qiao Nan became inept at withstanding any pressure, she was totally under the spell of Zhai Sheng. There was absolutely no signs of the tigress demeanor that she usually displayed before Zhu Baoguo. \u201cBrother Zhai, don\u2019t worry, I know that you are a military officer and there are tight rules to follow, I will definitely not put you in a difficult position. If I do that, aren\u2019t I repaying your kindness with ingratitude?\u201d\u201cI will not reject an elder\u2019s request then. I shall keep this pen. Thanks Brother Zhai.\u201dShe knew that Zhai Sheng would not take back the pen. Also, putting aside the monetary value of the pen, Qiao Nan really liked the pen.At most, as per what Brother Zhai said, she would repay his kindness as much as possible when she had the ability in future.But at the thought of the Zhai family\u2019s status and Zhai Sheng\u2019s future success, Qiao Nan\u2019s mouth twinged. She could not think there would be such a day where Brother Zhai needed her help.Zhai Sheng frowned, was this word used appropriately?Qiao Nan called him Brother Zhai, when had he become an elder?If not for the award that he saw just now, he would really suspect how Qiao Nan clinched the first place in the essay competition.\u201cFine, it\u2019s late. You should go home.\u201dQiao Nan was shocked. Everything seemed fine just a while ago, why did Brother Zhai\u2019s face turned black all of a sudden. \u201cBrother Zhai, can I put my award here, if I bring it back, most likely I will not have any left.\u201dBefore Zhai Sheng, Qiao Nan had nothing to hide. Anyway, at the time when she was reborn, Zhai Sheng had seen the few most embarrassing times of her life.\u201cLeave it here.\u201d\u201cThank you Brother Zhai, then I\u2019m going back. See you Brother Zhai. Oh, yes, it\u2019s almost Lunar New Year, I wish you a Happy New Year. Brother Zhai, I\u2019m really leaving now.\u201d Qiao Nan sounded like a machine gun. Before Brother Zhai could say a word, she finished her long string of words and ran away immediately thereafter.Watching the back of Qiao Nan, who was racing off at the speed of a rabbit, Zhai Sheng could not help shaking his head. \u201cTrue enough, she is scared of me.\u201d This was the same as the soldiers under his supervision. Qiao Nan was too timid, no wonder she was always bullied in the Qiao family.However, this was the matter of the Qiao family. In the Zhai family, Zhai Sheng could help Qiao Nan in whatever way he wanted. He could help her prepare a study room, find revision materials and give her a pen. But outside of the Zhai family, especially in the Qiao family, Zhai Sheng would not be able to interfere.\u201cNan Nan, you\u2019re back, how did you fare in the final examination?\u201d Qiao Dongliang had more confidence in the younger daughter.Qiao Dongliang went marketing early in the morning, he was prepared to celebrate. \u201cAlso Baoguo, how did he fare, how many marks did he get, did he pass?\u201d\u201cDad, like I said before, Zhu Baoguo is very intelligent, he not only passed this round of exam but also got 80 marks. If he work harder next year, he may score 85 marks to achieve an excellent grade.This time, when Qiao Nan saw that Qiao Dongliang was seemingly more concerned about Zhu Baoguo, and more interested in Zhu Baoguo\u2019s situation than hers, she did not feel sad. Instead, she felt quite happy.Even if her father did not care about her, or perhaps he was more concerned about others, it did not matter. Wasn\u2019t Brother Zhai quite good to her?In any case, God did not abandon her. God had given her so many opportunities, and even sent her an angel-like Prince Charming like Brother Zhai, Qiao Nan\u2019s heart was filled with contentment all of a sudden.\u201cReally!\u201d Qiao Dongliang said as he was pleasantly surprised.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t tell me that Teacher misreported or got the grades mixed up?\u201dHe was still thinking that it would be a good improvement if Zhu Baoguo managed to pass his exams.\u201cWhen the Zhu family called Teacher Chen about this, they also asked many similar questions. Dad, you don\u2019t need to doubt. These are really Zhu Baoguo\u2019s results. This year, Grandpa Lee invited our family to his house for Lunar New Year. If you bump into Zhu Baoguo there, Dad, please keep your earlier words to yourself, it\u2019s too hurtful.\u201dWhen the Zhu family dared not believe that Zhu Baoguo did so well, Zhu Baoguo could barely accept it.However, the same could not be said for a similar reaction from an outsider. Zhu Baoguo might perceive that the other party looked down on him.With that fiery temper of Zhu Baoguo, even if her father was Zhu Baoguo\u2019s elder, Zhu Baoguo would not be able to control his temper.Others would not dare to do it but not Zhu Baoguo.\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t worry, is Dad someone who is so bad-mannered?\u201d Qiao Dongliang put away this thought. Qiao Nan reminded him well, the question he asked earlier, wasn\u2019t he doubting Zhu Baoguo\u2019s ability and suspecting that Zhu Baoguo cheated in the exams? That will definitely not do.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be happy about. Zhu Baoguo is very smart and he relied on his own efforts,\u201d Ding Jiayi interrupted as she could not bear to see Qiao Dongliang, after hearing Zhu Baoguo\u2019s grades, continuously praising Qiao Nan like she was a divine being. \u201cZhu Baoguo did so well, don\u2019t think that your father would be happy that you pulled up Zhu Baoguo\u2019s grades but deteriorated your own. How many marks did you get, what is your ranking in the class and grade, I don\u2019t even wish to ask you.\u201dQiao Nan was just a child who had limited energy and ability.She needed to learn and progress herself and also assisted Zhu Baoguo to revise.Qiao Nan was just an ordinary person, to make Zhu Baoguo progressed so much, she must have put all her mind and heart on helping Zhu Baoguo. As such, how would she still be able to manage her own studies?Ding Jiayi\u2019s questions were full of gloating as if she was waiting to watch the show. Qiao Dongliang\u2019s expression changed.Did Nan Nan really spend all her efforts and time on Zhu Baoguo and neglected her own learning?\u201cNan Nan, don\u2019t worry, Dad has been saving money. Dad had thought about it, both of you are my daughters, Dad will treat both of you equally. If you did not do well in your middle school examination, Dad will definitely raise a sum of money to admit you into The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. Looking at your sister\u2019s recent situation, this money is certainly worth spending.\u201dOut of guilt, Qiao Dongliang could only compensate Qiao Nan in such ways.Because of Zhu Baoguo, Qiao Dongliang\u2019s reluctance on this matter previously had become full of promises today. Ding Jiayi\u2019s face turned pale when she heard this.Such a large sum of money, could it be saved so easily, how many years of hard work did it take them previously to save this up?You must know, the reason for saving this sum of money was to find an opportunity to build a house.After all, when the two daughters have grown up, especially if they would be taking in a son-in-law for the elder daughter, there would be not be enough rooms for everyone and the grandchildren.If Qiao Dongliang really wanted to pull strings with money and send Qiao Nan to The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, undoubtedly, it was not sufficient to rely on his savings alone. He would have to borrow from someone.At that time, no matter how Ding Jiayi doted on Qiao Zijin, she could no longer dote on her without thinking by satisfying all of Qiao Zijin\u2019s financial wants. She needed to first pay up this piece of debt.To work for the sake of Qiao Zijin, Ding Jiayi was very willing.Previously, for the sake of buying Qiao Zijin new clothes, Ding Jiayi stayed up late everyday until midnight, she did not even complain. But if this situation was for Qiao Nan, Ding Jiayi\u2019s stance was obviously a no. \u201cOld Qiao, are you mad, for the sake of Qiao Nan, you want to drag our whole family down. Are we still going to live? To allow her to enter the school, don\u2019t tell me you want our whole family of four to have porridge and pickles for every meal. We can\u2019t even have a proper meal?!\u201d\u201cMy stand remains. If there is really a need to borrow money, I will do it. I will pay it back in future. You just need to focus on taking a hand in Zijin\u2019s matters, you don\u2019t need to interfere in the affairs on my side.\u201d Qiao Dongliang knew the consequences but he still gritted his teeth and told Qiao Nan with certainty that he would ensure that she studied in The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China and receive the same treatment as Zijin.When Qiao Nan heard that Qiao Dongliang and Ding Jiayi quarreled directly in a furious manner because of this, she helplessly twinged the corners of her mouth. She cast a glance at Qiao Zijin\u2019s door, and said, \u201cDad, I did fine this round. I came out top in my class, as well as in the grade.\u201dAs to how many marks the second and third places lagged behind her, Qiao Nan did not even bother to mention.At that moment, both pairs of eyes were full of exclamation, Qiao Dongliang\u2019s eyes were full of joy, he wanted to rejoice and announce to the whole word.But Ding Jiayi\u2019s were more of resentment and depression.She could not understand, within a short time span of one semester, how did Qiao Nan improve by such leaps and bounds.During the last mid-term examination, Qiao Nan had already regained her previous level of standard, but the results of this exam had simply exceeded her usual standard, it was so much better than before!With this kind of result, there was no need to pull strings to admit her into Qiao Zijin\u2019s school. She was obviously a student that was a perfect match for the school.Ding Jiayi was not willing to spend money to let Qiao Nan enter The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. Nevertheless, Ding Jiayi was also reluctant to not spend a cent for Qiao Nan to enter the school.It was a status symbol to become a student of The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, she could not accept that Qiao Nan and Qiao Zijin were of the same standard. Qiao Zijin went to The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, Qiao Nan should attend another school that was not better.\u201cI say you\u2019re such a mean girl, your Dad doesn\u2019t believe me. Now I can see for myself, you\u2019re a dead girl who sides with outsiders. In the past, you refused to help your sister with her studies and as a result, she did not do well. Because of that, we spent all the savings in the family. If you had helped your sister like you did for Zhu Baoguo, couldn\u2019t we have saved up all those money? The money was not spent by your sister, it was you who wasted it!\u201dDing Jiayi was flustered and exasperated, she immediately linked Zhu Baoguo\u2019s matter to Qiao Zijin.\u201cIt\u2019s the Lunar New Year and you had to create some problem to disturb our peace? I, I\u2019ll kill a jinx like you.\u201d Ding Jiayi raised her hands and wanted to pinch Qiao Nan\u2019s ears.Somehow, Qiao Zijin\u2019s recent words suddenly appeared in Ding Jiayi\u2019s mind, \u201cMom, if Qiao Nan\u2019s fever earlier had damaged her brain and made her a fool, how good will that be, then both Dad and you would not have so much conflict because of Qiao Nan. When she becomes a fool, she will surely obey you and not have so many thoughts of her own.\u201dUnknowingly, Ding Jiayi was like a demon, with only those words in her mind, she seemed suddenly possessed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning ChiefCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIf she was to slap Qiao Nan\u2019s head a few more times, would she turn stupid?She gave birth to Qiao Nan, she would not want her dead. But it would not do that she kept on hindering Qiao Zijin. If Qiao Nan really got into an accident, she believed that Zijin would definitely take good care of her.Qiao Nan would no longer need to work. She would not need to lift a finger and there would be people waiting on her. She would give anything for this kind of life. As her mother, she did not shortchange Qiao Nan.Qiao Nan noticed that her mother looked at her with a dark greenish flicker in her eyes. It was similar to the look in Ding Jiayi\u2019s eyes in the previous life, when she heard from Qiao Zijin that if people were of blood relations, the compatibility level of their internal organs would be better, and there would be lower chances of rejection. Qiao Nan stiffened at the sight of that.But this was clearly unlike what happened in the previous life. Qiao Dongliang noticed that Ding Jiayi lifted her hands and was about to slap on Qiao Nan\u2019s head. Without a word, he pulled Qiao Nan behind him and slapped back at Ding Jiayi\u2019s raised hands. \u201cIt\u2019s the Lunar New Year, I have no wish to quarrel with you. What you said just now, are you crazy? What do Zijin\u2019s poor results have to do with Nan Nan? Is she studying on behalf of Nan Nan, and hence Nan Nan must take responsibility for her results? Are you kidding me?\u201d\u201cDad, who did you say has poor results? My results are not poor.\u201d Qiao Zijin who came back with her results slip overheard this and was displeased.\u201cZijin, you are back?\u201d Ding Jiayi calmed down and ran towards Qiao Zijin.Ding Jiayi who had come back to her senses were shocked at the thought that crossed her mind just now. Why would she have such terrifying and horrible thoughts?Everyone in the quad knew whether Qiao Nan was a simpleton or not. Besides if she and Old Qiao had a simpleton daughter; Zijin had a simpleton sister, it would be bad for their reputation?Besides, people would definitely be suspicious if Qiao Nan suddenly turned into a simpleton. She had no intention of wasting the rest of her life away for Qiao Nan. On top of that, it was impossible for Qiao Zijin to bear the heavy burden of looking after Qiao Nan.Qiao Zijin had come to her rescue at the right time.Ding Jiayi knew that if Qiao Dongliang was to know what she had on her mind just now, Old Qiao would definitely file for a divorce, there would be no chance of them staying as a couple.\u201cZijin, how are your results?\u201d\u201cMom, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Qiao Zijin frowned, slightly displeased. \u201cI did fairly well. Dad, who was blabbering nonsense to you, saying that I did badly?\u201d\u201cWe were talking about your results in the past.\u201d Qiao Dongliang was embarrassed. He never put the elder daughter down when she did badly for her exams in the past, today was the first time that he commented on her results, and yet he was caught by her. \u201cYour Mom was talking nonsense just now, she blamed your bad performance in the middle school exams on your sister. She said that all the money that we spent on you after the middle school exams was your sister\u2019s fault. Zijin, you have been in school for so many years, be our judge, is your mother\u2019s words justifiable?\u201dQiao Dongliang was boiling with anger at the mention of this.\u201cWhat has this got to do with Nan Nan? I am one level higher than Nan Nan, if she could tutor me in my studies, then she must be a genius.\u201d Qiao Zijin said cynically.If other people were to know that her younger sister who was one level lower than her had to coach her in her school exercises, it would be a disgrace for her.\u201cMom, don\u2019t flare up without getting the facts right. It was my problem that I did not do well for middle school exams. If other people overheard your words and had the impression that I did not do well in the exams as Nan Nan did not teach me well, Mom, how would you feel if you were me?\u201dQiao Zijin gave Ding Jiayi a frustrated stare. These days not only did her mother not help her in any way, in fact, she was a hindrance to her.Qiao Zijin felt terrible. She had boasted to everyone about buying new clothes. But when she went to school today, she had to tell everyone that due to her family circumstances, she could only buy one new set of clothes.Every female student in her class had two, three sets of new clothes for Lunar New Year, why was it that she had to be the oddball who could only have one set of new clothes?\u201cMom, I have something to discuss with you.\u201d Qiao Zijin dragged her mother to her room. \u201cI only have one set of new clothes in my class, this is so embarrassing, I will be looked down upon by everyone. Mom, everyone has parents, why can\u2019t you and Dad earn more? I am not asking to lead a better life than my classmates, all I want at the very least is to be on par with them. Though I can\u2019t choose my parents, it\u2019s my fortune to have you as my parents. But Mom, you have to think in my shoes, I have grown up now, I have a sense of pride, I don\u2019t want to be the laughing stock or to be looked down upon by others.\u201dDing Jiayi felt extremely bad at Qiao Zijin\u2019s words. \u201cBut your Mom isn\u2019t capable enough, I can\u2019t make lots of money.\u201dIn the past, she did not even need to go to work.She got herself a job and even took on handiwork back home in order to finance her elder daughter through school.Ding Jiayi felt that she had made up for the years where she stayed at home after having two babies with the huge workload that she had taken on recently.She felt sorry for herself at the thought that she had lost seven, eight kilograms in just two, three months\u2019 time.\u201cMy Dad, it\u2019s all his fault. What does he mean by this? Does he not want to take in a husband for me? Does he not want my children to take his surname? Why didn\u2019t he give me better treatment? Instead he spent all the money on Qiao Nan. She had to be married to someone else eventually, is my Dad muddleheaded?\u201dWhy would anyone spend their money on others?Her father was in fact, spending money on someone else\u2019s wife.\u201cNonsense, how could you say that of your Dad, wasn\u2019t he good to you?\u201d Ding Jiayi gave Qiao Zijin a smack with just the right amount of force. \u201cYour Dad is nice to Qiao Nan as she helped to tutor Zhu Baoguo and in a way helped your Dad to repay the debts of gratitude towards Uncle Lee. Do you know, Qiao Nan that wretched girl has a few tricks up her sleeves, Zhu Baoguo scored 80 points for his exams this time. Not only is your Dad happy, I suppose the Lee family and the Zhu family must be on cloud nine. That wretched girl is lucky.\u201dIn the future, if Qiao Nan had a favor to ask of the Zhu family and the Lee family, they would definitely help her.Qiao Zijin gritted her teeth. She had to cheat to barely score around 80 points, yet with Qiao Nan\u2019s coaching, Zhu Baoguo easily scored 80 points.Qiao Zijin finally understood what her parents were quarreling about just now and why her mother would blamed it on Qiao Nan for her bad performance in the middle school exams. Qiao Nan was an eyesore. She did not help her biological sister, yet she was so earnest in helping an outsider. She must be sick!\u201cMom, this might be a good thing for us.\u201d On second thoughts, Qiao Zijin had other plans.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
